Parasites of vectors - Ixodiphagus hookeri and its
Wolbachia symbionts in ticks in the Netherlands
Ellen Tijsse-Klasen1, Marieta Braks1, Ernst-Jan Scholte2 and Hein Sprong1*

Abstract
Background: Ixodiphagus hookeri is a parasitic wasp of ixodid ticks around the world. It has been studied as a
potential bio-control agent for several tick species. We suspected that the presence of Wolbachia infected I. hookeri
eggs in ticks is responsible for incidental detection of Wolbachia DNA in tick samples.
Methods: The 28S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes of a specimen of I. hookeri was amplified and sequenced. PCR on part of
the 28S rRNA gene was used to detect parasitic wasp DNA in 349 questing Ixodes ricinus ticks from various sampling
sites. Furthermore, the wsp gene of Wolbachia was sequenced from the I. hookeri specimen and a subset of ticks was
tested using this marker.
Results: Several sequences from tick specimens were identical to the Wolbachia sequence of the I. hookeri
specimen. Ixodiphagus hookeri was detected in 9.5% of all tested ticks, varying between 4% and 26% depending
on geographic location. Ten out of eleven sampling sites throughout the Netherlands were positive for I.
hookeri. Eighty-seven percent of I. hookeri-positive but only 1.6% of I. hookeri-negative ticks were Wolbachia
positive. Detection of I. hookeri DNA was strongly associated with the detection of Wolbachia in ticks.
Conclusion: This is the first reported case of I. hookeri in the Netherlands. Furthermore I. hookeri harbours
Wolbachia species and is broadly distributed in the Netherlands. While detection of Wolbachia DNA in ticks might
often be due to parasitism with this wasp, other sources of Wolbachia DNA in ticks might exist as well.

Background

Wolbachia in insects and its unclear role in ticks

Ticks as vectors for disease

Bacteria belonging to the group of Wolbachia pipientis
have been detected in several studies in Ixodes ricinus
ticks [10-13]. Bacteria from this group are known endosymbionts from a high variety of insects, mites and
nematodes. They act, depending on the Wolbachia
strain and host species, as mutualistic, commensalistic
or parasitic symbionts [14-16]. Wolbachia have been
shown to influence the reproduction of infected insects
in various ways, including parthenogenesis, male killing,
cytoplasmic incompatibility and feminization [16]. So
far, the role of Wolbachia in ticks remained unclear
[10,13]. Its prevalence was usually too low to be
explained by obligatory symbiosis and it remained
unclear how the ticks became infected. In the current
study we offer an explanation for the source of Wolbachia sequences amplified from ticks.

Ticks carry numerous microorganisms, ranging from
highly pathogenic bacteria to intracellular symbionts. In
addition to well-known pathogens including Rickettsia
spp., Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and Anaplasma spp., more
and more tick-associated bacteria are discovered with
molecular techniques. Initially, the role of such microorganisms for the tick or in the context of public health
remains unknown. Several examples can be named here,
ranging from probable endosymbionts of ticks like ‘Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii’ to ‘Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis’ which was found recently to be involved
in several cases of severe human disease [1-9].

Ixodiphagus hookeri

Unexpectedly, three wasps hatched in our laboratory from
an engorged nymphal I. ricinus tick. In accordance with
the origin of the wasps we suspected these to be Ixodiphagus hookeri (Howard), a parasitoid of ticks belonging to
the order Hymenoptera and the family Encyrtidae. I. hookeri is known to occur on all continents except for Antarctica and to infest various tick species [17]. So far, it had
not been reported from the Netherlands.
Mating of I. hookeri occurs shortly after emerging from
their tick host [15]. Females then search for a suitable tick
host and oviposit several eggs per tick, for I. ricinus up to
15 wasps per nymph have been observed [18]. In a
European setting unfed nymphs of I. ricinus are preferred
above I. ricinus larvae and fed nymphs [18]. Worldwide at
least 14 ixodid tick species, including several Ixodes spp.,
have been found to be suitable hosts. Suitability, however,
might depend on the I. hookeri strain [17-19]. I. hookeri
has been investigated for its potential as biological tick
control agent with variable results [17,20].
Study question

The discovery of parasitic wasps in Dutch ticks led to the
suspicion that Wolbachia sequences from ticks previously
identified in our laboratory and reported from other studies [10,12,13,21] might in fact be due to Wolbachia endosymbionts of tick parasitoids. We tested this by initially
testing the parasitic wasp for Wolbachia. Ticks were
examined for the presence of parasitoid DNA and Wolbachia by PCR to investigate associations between these two
parameters. Additionally, the prevalence and distribution
of I. hookeri in the Netherlands was investigated by testing
ticks from various sites throughout the country.

Page 2 of 7

blot (RLB) (as described in [12,22]) were selected. Additionally, one Wolbachia negative tick from the matching
study was selected for each positive tick. In order to
determine the distribution and prevalence of I. hookeri in
the Netherlands adult and nymphal ticks from eleven different locations across the Netherlands were tested.
Depending on availability, between 19 and 48 ticks per
location were tested (for one location only 3 ticks were
available). Total DNA was extracted from the ticks by
alkaline lysis as described elsewhere [2].
PCR Ixodiphagus

Several primer pairs (Table 1) targeting the 16S rRNA or
28S rRNA genes were tested on DNA extracted from an I.
hookeri (Howard) specimen. As a positive control, DNA of
Vespula vulgaris was used. PCR products were analyzed
on agarose gels. All primer pairs yielded bands for V. vulgaris DNA and all but the 16S-F1/16S-R1 combination
yielded PCR products for I. hookeri (Howard).
Ticks from the pilot study were tested for the presence
of Hymenoptera DNA by amplification of part of the 28S
rRNA gene using primer pair 28S-F1/28S-R1 and part of
the 16S rRNA gene using primer pair 16S-F2/16S-R1.
Ticks from the prevalence study were tested with primer
pair 28S-F1/28S-R1.
PCR was done using HotStarTaq master mix (Qiagen,
Germany) with the following conditions: 15 min at 95°C,
then cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 65°C, 60 s at 72°C, lowering the annealing temperature by 1°C each cycle until
reaching 55°C, then 35 cycles at this annealing temperature followed by a final elongation step for 7 min at 72°C.
Samples were analyzed on agarose gels.
PCR Wolbachia

Methods
Ixodiphagus source

Three specimens of parasitic wasp hatched from an
engorged I. ricinus nymph that had been collected from
sheep in a nature reserve area in the south-west of the
Netherlands on September 7 th , 2010. Ticks had been
pooled per sheep and stored in 50 ml polypropylene tubes
at room temperature, approximately 80% relative humidity
and a natural day/night cycle. The parasitic wasps hatched
between October 2010 and January 2011 and were discovered on January 10th, 2011. Two specimens were sent to
the Natural History Museum, London, for taxonomic
determination while the third specimen remained in our
laboratory for molecular investigations. Total DNA was
extracted from one specimen by alkaline lysis as described
elsewhere [2].
Ticks tested

Pilot test: From several studies from recent years (20082010) 27 Wolbachia positive ticks tested by reverse line

DNA of the I. hookeri specimen and ticks were tested
for the presence of Wolbachia DNA by amplification of
part of the wsp gene using primer pair wsp81F/wsp691R
(Table 2) [23]. PCR was done using HotStarTaq master
mix (Qiagen, Germany) with the touch down PCR protocol as described above with a starting annealing temperature of 60°C and a final annealing temperature of
50°C.
Sequencing

PCR products were sequenced using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing Ready Reaction kit
(Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems). All sequences were
confirmed by sequencing both strands.
Sequencing of the Wolbachia wsp gene indicated double infections with Wolbachia in some tick samples and
for these specimens additional sequencing primers were
used (wspF2a, wspF2b, wspR2a, wspR2b) (Table 2).
Resulting sequences were compared with sequences in
Genbank using BLAST.

Statistical analysis

Pilot study

Positive and negative predictive values with regard to Wolbachia wsp PCR results as predictors for a positive and
negative PCR results for Hymenoptera DNA were calculated. Additionally the significance of the association
between these two PCRs was tested using Mid-P exact test
[24].

Fifty-four ticks were tested for the presence of I. hookeri
and Wolbachia DNA. Amplification of the 16S rRNA
gene yielded unspecific products, which were not used
for further analysis. Amplified products of 28S rRNA and
wsp genes were sequenced. Most RLB Wolbachia-positive ticks were positive for 28S rRNA as well as wsp
genes. Five ticks of this group were positive for the wsp
gene but delivered no or divergent 28S rRNA sequences.
One tick was I. hookeri positive but did not produce a
wsp amplification product. Four RLB Wolbachia-positive
ticks were negative for either PCR. Twenty-four of 27
ticks from the RLB Wolbachia-negative control group
yielded no PCR products for either 28S rRNA or wsp
genes. Two ticks yielded 28S rRNA sequences different
from I. hookeri and one tick yielded a wsp sequence different from the I. hookeri isolate. Wolbachia wsp
sequences from several I. hookeri positive ticks failed to
be sequenced in adequate length and quality, which was
apparently due to double infection with multiple Wolbachia strains.

Results
Identification of parasitic wasps

The collected parasitic wasps were morphologically identified as Ixodiphagus hookeri (Howard) by John Noyes at the
Natural History Museum, London (Figure 1). This species
had previously not been reported from the Netherlands
and has in the meantime been added to the list of Dutch
Chalcidoidea and the Dutch Species Catalogue [25].
PCR on Ixodiphagus hookeri

The 28S rRNA and 16S rRNA genes of I. hookeri were successfully amplified and sequenced. After clipping off the
primer sites, sequences of 824 bp and 318 bp were
obtained, respectively. BLASTing of the 28S rRNA and
16S rRNA sequences gave closest matches with the hymenopteran parasitoids Plagiomerus diaspidis (accession
code AY599316, 84% identity) and Cotesia flaviconchae
(AJ535921, 80% identity, 89% coverage), respectively.
Sequencing of the Wolbachia wsp gene yielded a
sequence of 573 bp with no indications of double infection. BLASTing of the wsp sequence gave close matches
with a number of Wolbachia endosymbionts of various
insects. A phylogenetic tree based on the wsp gene was
calculated (Figure 2).

Prevalence study

A total of 341 ticks were tested for the presence of I. hookeri PCR amplification of the 28S rRNA gene. Additionally 143 of these ticks were tested for Wolbachia by
amplification of the wsp gene. Ixodiphagus hookeri DNA
was detected in 9.7% (n = 33) of all ticks. Ten of eleven
locations were found positive with a prevalence ranging
from 4% to 26% (Figure 3 and 4). For the remaining site
only 3 ticks were available, which were all negative. Of
the 143 ticks tested for Wolbachia, 10.5% (n = 15) were

found positive (Table 3). Two ticks that had been found
positive for I. hookeri DNA were negative for Wolbachia
and vice versa. A tick positive in the Wolbachia PCR had
a probability of 87% to be positive for I. hookeri as well.
Likewise, a negative Wolbachia result predicted a negative I. hookeri PCR with a probability of 98%. The association between PCR results for Wolbachia and I. hookeri
DNA was statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001).

Discussion
DNA of I. hookeri was detected in ticks collected from
locations broadly distributed across the Netherlands.
Although this is the first notice of this species in the
Netherlands the broad distribution and the cosmopolitan
distribution of this insect indicates that the wasp is a
native species. The prevalence varies strongly with sampling location as had been reported from other studies as
well [26,27]. The prevalence might influenced by biological or climatic factors. Tick density, which in turn is
affected by tick-host abundance, has been suspected to

be a major determinant for the prevalence of I. hookeri
[27]. This corresponds with the finding that the highest I.
hookeri prevalence in this study was found in ‘Duin &
Kruidberg’ (Figure 4), an area with exceptional high tick
density (data not shown). However, another area with
comparable tick density, ‘Kop van Schouwe’, had a much
lower I. hookeri prevalence. Other factors like (micro)climate, vegetation and prevalence of different vertebrate
species in the habitats might play a role, but such data
were not collected during this study.
The molecular data suggest that I. hookeri, as many
other insects, may harbour at least one Wolbachia
strain. The specimen studied here was infected with a
Wolbachia strain similar to that of other Hymenoptera

but also closely matched Wolbachia endosymbionts of
insects from different orders. Although the specimen
hatched in our laboratory was apparently infected with a
single strain, several I. hookeri positive ticks harboured
multiple Wolbachia strains. Multiple infections with
Wolbachia are known to occur in insects [28,29] and
the combination of these might have different biological
impacts on their hosts. Wolbachia have been linked to
parasitoid specialization [30] and different Wolbachia
strains in I. hookeri might be one explanation for apparent differences in its biology in different countries
[18,19,31].
Detection of Wolbachia DNA in ticks in this study is
strongly correlated with I. hookeri infestation. The small
deviation between PCR results might be explained by
different sensitivities of PCRs. On the one hand, some I.
hookeri might have no or only a low Wolbachia load
while others might have a high bacterial load. On the
other hand, the copy number of the 28S rRNA gene,
which was used to detect I. hookeri in this study, is not
known for this species and will influence the PCR sensitivity for this target. Furthermore PCR products from
the prevalence study were not sequenced. Therefore,

Tijsse-Klasen et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:228
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/228

some of the wsp and 28S rRNA positive PCR results
might have been due to environmental contamination of
samples with Wolbachia or insect species not related to
infestation of ticks.
Data on spread and prevalence of I. hookeri around the
world is scarce. The specificity of the I. hookeri PCR could
be increased for future studies by the use of primers with
high specificity, which can now be designed based on the
16S rRNA and 28S rRNA sequence data from this study.
In future, molecular methods can be used to examine the
spread and prevalence of I. hookeri in different tick species
and regions.

Conclusions
We report for the first time the detection of I. hookeri in
Dutch ticks and the presence of Wolbachia in I. hookeri.
This is, to our knowledge, the first reported study investigating the prevalence of I. hookeri in tick populations with
molecular methods. I. hookeri seems to harbour Wolbachia endosymbionts, which can explain previous reports of
Wolbachia isolates from I. ricinus ticks. In case they are
endosymbionts of parasitoids, and not of the ticks themselves, these Wolbachia are unlikely to play a role in
human diseases.
