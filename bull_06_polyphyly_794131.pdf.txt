Abstract
Background: The view that gene flow between related animal species is rare and evolutionarily
unimportant largely antedates sensitive molecular techniques. Here we use DNA sequencing to
investigate a pair of morphologically and ecologically divergent, non-sibling butterfly species,
Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), whose distributions overlap in
Central and Northwestern South America.
Results: In these taxa, we sequenced 30–45 haplotypes per locus of a mitochondrial region
containing the genes for cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (CoI/CoII), and intron-spanning
fragments of three unlinked nuclear loci: triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi), mannose-6-phosphate
isomerase (Mpi) and cubitus interruptus (Ci) genes. A fifth gene, dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) produced
sequence data likely to be from different duplicate loci in some of the taxa, and so was excluded.
Mitochondrial and Tpi genealogies are consistent with reciprocal monophyly, whereas sympatric
populations of the species in Panama share identical or similar Mpi and Ci haplotypes, giving rise to
genealogical polyphyly at the species level despite evidence for rapid sequence divergence at these
genes between geographic races of H. melpomene.
Conclusion: Recent transfer of Mpi haplotypes between species is strongly supported, but there
is no evidence for introgression at the other three loci. Our results demonstrate that the
boundaries between animal species can remain selectively porous to gene flow long after
speciation, and that introgression, even between non-sibling species, can be an important factor in
animal evolution. Interspecific gene flow is demonstrated here for the first time in Heliconius and
may provide a route for the transfer of switch-gene adaptations for Müllerian mimicry. The results
also forcefully demonstrate how reliance on a single locus may give an erroneous picture of the
overall genealogical history of speciation and gene flow.

Background
Introgression can play a key evolutionary role in plants

[1,2], but has until recently been considered rare and controversial in animals [3-5]. This is largely because hybrids

between animal species are rare, but may also stem from
a belief that hybridization and introgression between species is unnatural [1,3,5]. Hybrids are usually rare on a per
individual basis, but species undergoing occasional interpecific hybridization are common. Existing surveys suggest that around 10% of animal species, and 25% of plant
species hybridize [5]: for instance, 9% of bird species [6]
and 11% of European butterfly species [7] are known to
hybridize with at least one other species. Even if occasional, natural hybridization can lead to successful introgression, with important consequences in ecology,
evolution and conservation [3,5]. However, hybridization
in nature does not guarantee that genes will pass between
species, because hybrids are typically selected against, and
may be completely infertile or inviable. To determine
whether hybridization leads to introgression, we must
investigate the patterns of distribution of alleles among
hybridizing species. Shared alleles in descendent species
may have been inherited as pre-existing polymorphisms
from their joint ancestors, as well as via recent gene flow
since speciation. These two routes to allelic sharing, which
both result in genealogical polyphyly at the species level,
are hard to distinguish on the basis of genetic data.
Recently, two classes of molecular methods have been
used to test for introgression. Both rely on the idea that
introgression in some genomic locations will be prohibited by reproductive isolation or divergent natural selection, while at other loci introgressing alleles will establish
more freely. In fact, without heterogeneity of divergence
across the genome, it will typically be difficult to discriminate recent speciation from recent gene flow. The first
method examines genotypic data at multiple low-resolution loci, such as chromosomal morphs, allozymes, microsatellites, amplified fragment length polymorphisms
(AFLPs) or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), for
heterogeneity of divergence in allele frequency. Alleles
that flow freely will have their frequencies homogenised
across species, while alleles whose introgression is
blocked by divergent selection will retain strong frequency
differences. Thus, heterogeneity in allele frequency differences among loci suggests that on-going gene flow as a
likely explanation for similar allele frequencies at some
genes in pairs of taxa that hybridise [8-13]. A second
approach, adopted in this paper, employs DNA sequence
data, coupled with a statistical approach based on gene
genealogies and coalescence theory, to test whether
shared haplotype polymorphisms could have been inherited from a common ancestor or are more likely due to
introgression since speciation [14-18].
Heliconius butterflies are a rapidly radiating, tropical
group, well known for diverse warning colors and Müllerian mimicry [19-22]. Around 35% of the species in this
group are known to hybridize in nature [5,21]. This study

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/11

concentrates on Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene, which
co-occur throughout Central America and the Northern
Andes [23,24]. Although closely related, separating
approximately 1.5 million years ago [24], they are not
classical 'sibling species' (i.e. species difficult to distinguish using morphology). Nor are they host races, ecological morphs or members of a recent island radiation.
Unusually for studies of introgression, we have chosen
two species that are partially sympatric, continental taxa
differing strongly in morphology, as well as in larval and
adult ecology [21,25,26]. These species diverged in colour
pattern due to Müllerian mimicry [27]: Heliconius melpomene mimics the geographically widespread red, yellow
and black H. erato, while H. cydno mimics the black and
white or yellow H. sapho and H. eleuchia [27,28] in the
Northern Andes and Central America. The two are not
even strictly sister species, since a number of other morphologically distinct species, such as H. heurippa, H. pachinus, H. timareta, and H. tristero, appear more closely
related to H. cydno than to H. melpomene [23,29-32].
Nonetheless, natural hybrids occur in most areas of range
overlap. The frequency of hybridization is rare (less than
one in every 1000 individuals [21,27]), but hybrids of
both sexes are viable, and, although F1 hybrid females are
sterile, in accordance with Haldane's Rule, males are fertile and produce viable backcross progeny with either
parental species [33-35]. Furthermore, about half the
hybrids collected from the wild are backcrosses, identifiable by their colour pattern phenotype [35]. Introgression
mediated by fertile hybrids therefore seems likely [5,21].
To test the importance of introgressive gene flow between
the two species, we sequenced multiple haplotypes of four
unlinked loci using a geographic sampling regime
designed to reveal unusual genealogical patterns due to
introgression. We chose sympatric populations of H.
cydno chioneus and H. melpomene rosina from Panama,
which are known from a few specimens to hybridize occasionally in the wild, and an allopatric French Guiana population of H. melpomene melpomene that does not overlap
with H. cydno, and whose mtDNA is also known to be
divergent relative to other H. melpomene populations [23].
The French Guiana population acts as a control for population divergence and the high variance of coalescence
time expected. If introgression were occurring at a particular locus, we would expect sympatric haplotypes to be
unusually similar, while at the same time the allopatric
population of H. melpomene can be used to confirm that
evolutionary divergence occurs normally at the same
locus. We sequenced DNA from four unlinked loci: one
mitochondrial region (cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II
– CoI, CoII; hereafter Co), and intron-spanning regions of
a sex-linked locus Tpi (triose-phosphate isomerase, on the Zchromosome), autosomal Mpi (mannose-6-phosphate isomerase), and Ci (cubitus interruptus); for details see Table

Table 1: Summary statistics and maximum likelihood model parameters for gene regions. Ten individuals were sampled from each of
the three populations, and the same individuals were sequenced for all genes. For nuclear loci, one or two sequences per individual was
obtained via cloning of diploid genes. To investigate introgression, paired datasets for sympatric H. cydno and H. melpomene only from
Panama (10 individuals each) were analysed using the IM Bayesian algorithm [18]; these are the IM dataset, and IM reduced datasets 1
and 2 – the latter have been purged of presumably recombinant sequences by deleting some individuals and by sampling from 5' or 3'
regions of each gene (see methods). Complete alignment data in FASTA format and IM data file format are given in [Additional file 2

1). These loci were selected because it was reasoned that
mitochondrial genes and nuclear non-coding regions
would diverge rapidly enough to provide high resolution
between closely related taxa [36]. The nuclear loci are all
known to be on different linkage groups [37], providing a
scatter of loci across the genome with which to detect
introgression.

Results
The genealogical pattern at each locus
Details of the data and models of evolution are given in
Table 1. As expected if allelic coalescence has occurred
more recently than the split between the two species, the
maximum likelihood genealogy for Co is consistent with
reciprocal monophyly for H. melpomene and H. cydno,
with 2.5–3.0% net divergence between species compared
to < 1.3% uncorrected divergence within populations, and

0.4% net divergence between H. melpomene races (Table
2). There was no evidence for recombination at this locus
(Table 1), as expected for mitochondrial sequences [38].
A previous parsimony study of Co found French Guiana
(MG) and Panama (MP) haplotypes of H. melpomene to be
distinct (as here), and suggested that the French Guiana
clade was sister to a clade including Panama H. melpomene
and H. cydno [23], making H. melpomene paraphyletic with
respect to H. cydno (CP) at this locus. Our results differ in
that although melpomene paraphyly has a marginally
greater likelihood, mutual monophyly cannot be rejected
(SH test: ∆logL = 1.36, P = 0.27). Paraphyly of H. melpomene, as found by Brower [23] using a parsimony analysis, is however strongly rejected by equal-weighted
parsimony bootstrapping on our data. The difference
between the two analyses is probably due to additional
information provided by the greater length of mitochon-

drial sequence we used (1573 bp vs. Brower's 942 bp). We
therefore show the constrained, mutually monophyletic
tree (Fig. 1).
The genealogical pattern for Tpi is somewhat similar in
some respects to that for Co, in that mutual monophyly of
H. cydno and H. melpomene seems likely, with 1.4–2.5%
net divergence between the two species at this locus, compared to 1.3% between races within H. melpomene (Table
2). There are several examples of homoplasious indels in
the tree, as expected if recombination had taken place
within these haplotypes. There is additional evidence
from a statistical test for recombination in both H. melpomene (P = 0.023), and H. cydno (P = 0.004) from Panama. In contrast to Co, Tpi yields an almost reverse
maximum likelihood genealogy in which H. melpomene
forms a monophyletic group within a paraphyletic Heliconius cydno. But again, the evidence for paraphyly does not
stand up: there is less than 50% parsimony bootstrap support for a paraphyletic tree over a monophyly-constrained
tree, and likelihood support for paraphyly is also weak
(SH test, ∆logL = 6.63, P = 0.22). Therefore, we again represent the genealogy as the most likely mutually monophyletic species tree (Fig. 2).
In contrast, Mpi demonstrates a clear lack of reciprocal
monophyly between H. cydno and H. melpomene: net
divergence between these species within Panama (0.03%)
is much less than between French Guiana and Panama
populations of H. melpomene (1.91%, Table 2). Two
indels inferred to be homoplasious are found in French
Guiana H. melpomene, suggesting that recombination
occurs and a test for recombination confirms this (P =
0.004). However, no evidence for recombination was

found in H. melpomene, H. cydno, or combined haplotypes
from Panama (P > 0.25, Table 1). The vast majority of
indels conform to the estimated genealogy, suggesting
recombination is rare (Fig. 3). The maximum likelihood
genealogy suggests that many identical or nearly identical
sequences are shared between the two species in Panama,
both of which populations are strongly differentiated
from H. melpomene from French Guiana (Fig. 3). Four very
short Mpi sequences, with a 280 bp deletion spanning
most of the intron, were also identical across taxa (Fig. 3,
haplotype group III). These sequences are placed basally
by maximum likelihood because of the lack of phylogenetic information. A tree search constrained to be mutually monophyletic between the two species is strongly
rejected (∆logL = 133.24, P < 0.001).
The existence of some very short alleles and high rates of
divergence among haplotype groups within each taxon
might suggest that divergent duplicate loci are being
sequenced. However, a battery of tests confirm that Mpi
acts as a single-copy nuclear, coding marker which can be
mapped readily in crosses (see methods). Similar results
have recently been obtained with the same primers by a
number of other workers, showing that the results here are
not anomalous [24,39].
The genealogical pattern for Ci is more complex. As with
Mpi, net divergence is low between H. cydno and H. melpomene in Panama (0.7%), and rather higher between
geographic races of H. melpomene (3.7%) and between H.
cydno and French Guiana H. melpomene (2.9%). However, there are no fixed differences between any pair of
taxa, and the numbers of shared polymorphisms appear

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/11

so does not contravene the idea that the indel may be a
character found only in H. cydno). These contrasting patterns suggest either multiple ancestral polymorphisms, or
introgression of haplotypes and recombination both
within and between the two species in Panama, but a lack
of gene flow between either of these and H. melpomene
melpomene sequences from French Guiana. Several groups
of Ci haplotypes from French Guiana H. melpomene melpomene form distinct clades, but overall there is strong evidence against mutually monophyletic separation between
cydno and melpomene (Fig. 4, ∆logL = 130.63, P < 0.001).
Thus the pattern seems similar to that for Mpi, but closely
similar or identical haplotypes at this locus are rarer
between than within species. Thus, if introgression
explains similarities among haplotypes of the sympatric
species pair, it may be more ancient than at Mpi.

to be roughly equal between all comparisons, both within
and between species at this locus (Table 3).
Unlike Mpi, Ci shows many inferred homoplasies, both of
single base pairs and of indels: in addition to the apomorphic indels shown, 90 inferred insertion/deletion events
involve 27 homoplasious indels, too numerous to be
shown in Fig. 4. These homoplasious events are presumably mainly due to recombination (significant in all four
separate tests, P = 0.02, P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001; see
Table 1), which negates the validity of representing the Ci
genealogy as a strictly bifurcating tree as in the likelihood
analysis (Fig. 4). Indels are expected to be less prone to
reversal or homoplasy than single-base changes. At the Ci
locus, seven out of 11 indels not subject to homoplasy or
reversal supported groups of French Guiana melpomene
melpomene, while of the remaining three, two are autapomorphic, one supports a (cydno+melpomene rosina) haplotype pair. One indel supports a grouping of H. cydno with
a single associated H. melpomene sequence that lacks the
indel (but which is attached to the base of the clade, and

Bayesian analysis of genealogy and introgression
The strong polyphyly of Mpi and Ci genealogies between
the two species suggests that selective introgression at
these loci may be the cause. To examine this possibility we
employed the Bayesian 'Isolation-Migration' (IM) algorithm of Hey & Nielsen [18]. The IM test deals with pairs
of taxa only, so we examined only sympatric H. melpomene
rosina and H. cydno chioneus from Panama. We carried out
analyses on three modified datasets to conform with the
assumptions and limitations of the IM algorithm (i.e. no
gap polymorphism, no recombination within loci).
Firstly, we obtained a dataset that is as complete as possible obtained by deleting highly indel-laden haplotypes
and indel polymorphic regions (the basic 'IM Dataset') –
for example, the short intronless sequences at Mpi could
not be used in this analysis. Two additional datasets were
sampled from this basic dataset, by removing apparent
recombinant regions or haplotypes ('IM Reduced Dataset
1', and 'IM Reduced Dataset 2' – see methods and Table
1). In the event, all three analyses gave broadly similar
results. We calibrate the analyses via neutral substitution
rates obtained from an insect mitochondrial DNA clock
calibration [32] to obtain approximate per base pair neutral substitution rates (µ) for each locus, times since speciation (t), effective population size measured as a product
of mutation rate and total population size (θ = 4 Nµ), and
per locus bidirectional introgression rates (m). The absolute values of these parameters are of course of some interest, but are highly dependent on the clock calibration of
Brower [32] based on a shorter sequence of mtDNA,
which may therefore be somewhat unreliable. What are of
more interest here are the relative values for introgression
(m) between the species at different loci. The results are
shown in Tables 4, 5, 6 and Fig. 5.

Overall, the results suggest that substitution rates (µ) for
the three nuclear loci are three to four-fold higher than the
rate for the mitochondrial region. This may seem rapid for

have been estimated to be larger if the more divergent H.
melpomene melpomene sequences had been included.
Using the IM reduced datasets as better estimates of population size without recombination within each locus, the
overall inferred effective population sizes correspond to
about 230,000–340,000 individuals for H. melpomene
rosina, and 1.41–1.75 million individuals for H. cydno
using the mitochondrial rate calibration of Brower [32].
Very little information is available to estimate the ancestral population size (θA), as can be seen from the graphs
in Fig. 5.
Of most importance here, bidirectional introgression
rates (m) for each locus apparently identify a single outlier, Mpi, which has m at least an order of magnitude
higher than at any of the other loci. The lower tails of the
posterior probability distributions of m for Co, Tpi, and Ci
are never complete even at the lowest values sampled, so
we follow Hey & Nielsen [18] in inferring a lack of evidence for introgression at such loci.

nuclear genes, but the comparison is between mitochondrial coding sequence and largely intronic nuclear
sequence (Tables 4, 5, 6), and the result agrees approximately with a broader comparative study in Heliconius in
which third base pairs in codons of the Co mitochondrial
region were shown to diverge at approximately the same
rates as intronic sequences in two of the nuclear genes
studied here (Tpi and Mpi), overall, and apparently even
faster at low divergences similar to those found here (1–
2% at Co; see Figs. 1a, b in ref. [24]). Only weak information is available from the genealogical data about time of
divergence, but speciation is inferred to have taken place
more than about a million years ago (Tables 4, 5, 6, Fig.
5) and most likely around 2.0 million years ago. Effective
population sizes (θ) are estimated to be about three to
four-fold larger in H. cydno than H. melpomene rosina,
but the latter species' population size would undoubtedly

The genealogies obtained compared with other available
data
The maximum likelihood genealogy for the Co region,
based on all H. cydno and H. melpomene and outgroup
data now available from GenBank (62 sequences, data not
shown) suggests paraphyly of H. melpomene, but with an
Amazonian/French Guiana clade of H. melpomene outside
a paired sister group consisting of a clade of Western
South American, Central American and French Guiana H.
melpomene, and a clade containing H. cydno. Nonetheless,
monophyly is again not rejected overall (∆logL = 1.74, P
= 0.19), and parsimony bootstrap support for paraphyly
of melpomene is < 50%. Similarly, monophyly is not
rejected at Tpi, even when all available GenBank data for
this locus (101 sequences, data not shown) are taken into
consideration. For Mpi, in contrast, genealogical
polyphyly remains highly supported when we employ
data from the entire GenBank record (92 sequences, data
not shown). For instance, a recent study from a different
laboratory demonstrated sequences from melpomene in
each of the haplotype groups I-II and IV of Fig. 3[39]. The
presence of H. melpomene sequences within haplotype
group I is especially significant as only H. cydno haplotypes are found in this group in the present study (Fig. 3),
almost certainly due to the small number of haplotypes
we sampled in group I. No other data from these taxa are
yet available for the Ci locus. In conclusion, all other
available data lend further support to the genealogical
patterns
we
find
here.

vs. cydno 567A and 552A) in species that split over 1 million years ago. However, lack of divergence seems highly
unlikely, because rates of divergence at Mpi and Ci are
approximately three times faster than rates at CoI/CoII
(Tables 4, 5, 6) as estimated here, and when tested among
more distantly related species of Heliconius [24]. Also
divergence is normal between geographic populations of
H. melpomene – see below. Thus, even if the Mpi haplotype
groups I-IV had been retained as ancestral polymorphisms, we would have expected strong interspecific
divergence within each haplotype group.

and Tpi have done so? Two major explanations seem possible: (1) retention of ancestral Mpi and Ci polymorphism, and lack of its retention in CoI/CoII and Tpi, or (2)
selective introgression of Mpi and/or Ci alleles. Ancestral
polymorphism initially seems plausible because the effective population size (Ne) should be higher for autosomal
Mpi and Ci than for sex-linked Tpi and maternally inherited CoI/CoII. However, given a 1:1 sex ratio, ratios of Ne
among the three gene regions (4:3:1 respectively) are not
large: for example, average coalescence time for Mpi or Ci
should be only 1.33-fold of that of Tpi on this basis. Zero
introgression explanations would also require extremely
low rates of substitution within each ancestral Mpi allelic
group (I-IV in Fig. 3) to explain the presence of identical
and near-identical intron sequences (e.g. Panama melpomene 546B, 531A, 532B vs. cydno 553B; Panama melpomene 811B vs. cydno 809B; Panama melpomene 546A

The second hypothesis, recent introgression at Mpi (and
possibly Ci), but not at the other loci, is on balance more
likely. The most convincing evidence of introgression in
Panama is provided by the comparison between geographic populations within melpomene. At Mpi and Ci, H.
cydno and H. melpomene share haplotype groups and have
low divergence within Panama, while net divergences
between races of melpomene are similar to those at other
loci (Fig. 3, 4, Table 2). The allopatric French Guiana H.
melpomene melpomene population acts as a control for
divergence at these loci, and so the much lower net divergence between H. melpomene rosina and H. cydno in Panama (1/60 at Mpi, 1/3 at Ci) compared with divergence
between either taxon and H. melpomene from French
Guiana is clearly aberrant.
Additional evidence comes from nucleotide polymorphisms (Table 3). The ratio of fixed differences to shared
polymorphisms is expected to increase with time since a
split between populations. For Co and Tpi, our data are
consistent with an ancient split between H. melpomene
and H. cydno, and a much more recent split, or ongoing
introgression between the two H. melpomene races. Only at
Mpi are a large number of polymorphisms shared between
H. cydno and H. melpomene, and then only in sympatric
Panama populations. A G test of homogeneity in the frequencies of shared polymorphisms versus fixed site differences between H. cydno and H. melpomene in Panama
strongly rejects the hypothesis that divergence and polymorphisms accumulated in the same proportions within
each gene, as expected under neutral population divergence in total isolation (Table 3, central two columns, P
<< 0.001). Some loci show many fixed differences and few
local polymorphisms; others show the opposite. This
striking pattern can be explained most simply as a result
of recent or ongoing interspecific gene flow in Panama
only, leading to sharing of Mpi and possibly Ci polymorphisms between species, but not at other genes.
Finally, the IM analysis [18] suggests exchange of Mpi haplotypes between the two species in Panama, but no evidence of gene flow at other loci. Instead of being due to
gene flow, IM suggests that polyphyly in the genealogies

of Ci may be due to ancestral polymorphism inherited
from a common ancestor, or possibly due to Ci haplotype
introgression in the distant past. In only the most reduced
dataset (IM reduced dataset 1) for Ci is there a relatively
flat distribution of posterior probability for higher migration levels (amplified 10 × in Fig. 5 for clarity). In view of
the stronger clustering of Ci haplotypes by species than at
Mpi, a conclusion of little evidence for introgression at Ci
seems warranted. The analysis therefore provides evidence
for introgression only for Mpi haplotypes, where effective
gene flow is about 1.5 × 10-6 per generation (with a 95%
credibility interval of 9 × 10-7 – 4.50 × 10-5, Table 5).
Loci embedded in divergently selected genomic regions
may be less likely to cross the species boundary than others [15]. Our data are consistent with linkage maps and
knowledge of sterility between H. melpomene and H.
cydno. Female hybrids between the two species are sterile
[34], which should prevent mitochondrial transfer.
(Female hybrids between Panama and French Guiana H.
melpomene are also sterile, but in only one direction of the
cross [40], so that mitochondrial transfer should still be
possible between the geographic races, although here
geography is probably the cause of divergence). Tpi may
have a similar genealogy to that of CoI/CoII because the
gene is syntenic with Z-linked female sterility in crosses
[34]. Ci maps to linkage group 18 [37], which also contains an important locus causing fixed colour pattern differences between the two species. Introgression is thus
likely to be inhibited in this locus by strong mimetic selection against intermediate or introgressed colour patterns
[20,27,28]. In contrast, introgression of autosomal Mpi
haplotypes (linkage group 3 [37]) between H. cydno and
H. melpomene may occur more readily because it is
unlinked to any loci known to be associated with sterility
or other divergently selected traits.
The use of a color pattern 'toolbox' of switch genes shared
between multiple species has been suggested as a means
by which similar, homoplasious colour patterns spread
throughout the H. melpomene – silvaniform clade of the
genus Heliconius [24,41]. Many of these species hybridize
in nature [5]. For example, H. timareta, H. tristero and H.
heurippa from the Eastern Andes are considered separate

species, although analyses of mitochondrial sequences
place them with clades of H. cydno [23,24,30,31]. The taxa
in this group are mostly Müllerian mimics of other Heliconius, and may have obtained their red-marked color patterns via hybridization and selective gene flow from local
races of H. melpomene [30,31,41]. Occasional introgression may thus have allowed wholesale transfer of multilocus, ready-made mimetic adaptations. Our finding of
introgressed autosomal haplotypes between two members of this subgroup provides molecular evidence for the
possibility such a claim.
Inferring history and species status from limited sequence
data
The data presented here also illustrate the difficulties of
reconstructing phylogeny of closely related species from
DNA sequences. For this study, finished sequence was
obtained from 30 individuals, and from 43–45 haplotypes for each nuclear gene. For each individual, cloning
stages must be added so that some 10,000 extra bp DNA
had to be sequenced per individual, or about 390,000 bp
total to obtain reliable sequences for just four loci
sequenced in every individual. Of the loci used, two (Co
and Tpi) agree with prior morphologically-based understanding of species delimitation, showing no significant
deviation from reciprocal monophyly. Two loci strongly
reject the same phylogenetic interpretation, of which one
(Ci) shows potential evidence for ancient gene flow and/
or abundant ancestral polymorphism, and the other
(Mpi) shows clear evidence for ongoing introgression
between the species in sympatry and differentiation
between geographic races. Still another locus tried (Dopa
decarboxylase – Ddc, [see Additional file 1]) was inconclusive, although we hypothesise fixed differences and reciprocal monophyly for this locus
too, since H. cydno
apparently lacks priming sites in H. melpomene and other
related taxa. Previous conclusions that H. cydno is nested
within Guiana and Panama melpomene clades [23] appear
on current data to be incorrect, and may result from a lack
of resolution due to the smaller CoI/CoII fragment used
earlier. However, although mutual monophyly is not
ruled out using the Co and Tpi fragments studied here,
maximum likelihood genealogies of both genes suggest
that species paraphyly is as, or more, likely. At the same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/11

time, convincing evidence for polyphyletic genealogies at
Ci and Mpi show that introgression and ancestral polymorphisms within Panama may often mimic patterns
concluded from the earlier mitochondrial data. Whether
H. melpomene and H. cydno are mutually monophyletic is
therefore no longer even a sensible question at the species
level – the answer depends in which part of the genome
we are interested.
Two loci examined here show no evidence for introgression (Co and Tpi). Of the two loci showing potential evidence for introgression via polyphyly, Mpi demonstrates
fixed allelic differences, with no French Guiana alleles
found within Panama clades, and little homoplasy
between haplotypes; at Ci, in contrast, haplotypes are
mixed freely among races of melpomene, as well as between
species, and there is abundant evidence of recombination
among haplotypes both within and between species.
Although we did not expect such strong differences beween loci a priori, it is clear that there are many other differences in the evolution of the introns sampled at the four
nuclear loci. The intron at Mpi is characterised by major
splits between highly divergent haplotype groups maintained as polymorphisms (possibly as a result of balancing selection – see [24]), each haplotype group associated
with particular indels, and showing little evidence of
recombination. Tpi and Ci show many polymorphic
indels, and strong evidence for recombination between
haplotypes. Introns at Ddc, in contrast, [see Additional file

1] show strong sequence conservation, and are readily
alignable even with distantly related species such as H.
himera (a close relative of H. erato), while the highly divergent intronic sequences from Tpi or Mpi are impossible to
align between erato-group and melpomene-group species of
Heliconius [24]. Ddc also has few indels, and shows no evidence for recombination, even in its intronic sequences. A
major finding of this study has been to demonstrate how
idiosyncratically different genes can evolve. In this
respect, our results are concordant with those obtained
both for other sympatric, regularly hybridizing insect
groups (e.g. Anopheles gambiae sensu lato [13,17] and the
Drosophila pseudoobscura group [16,18]) and also in a
largely allopatric radiation of three sibling species
between which hybridization is unlikely and introgression not observed (Drosophila simulans group [42]). A 'species phylogeny' of closely related taxa such as these at best
provides an artificial consensus of multiple conflicting
genealogical patterns, rather than a meaningful representation
of
actual
lineage
diversification.
This study also highlights the difficulty of delimiting species on the basis of limited sequence information. In our
populations, a short mtDNA barcode sequence could be
used to assign individuals to clades each having fixed differences, and these clades could then be labelled as
belonging either to H. melpomene or to H. cydno on the
basis of already established biological, ecological and
morphological traits. However, a priori attempts to define

Thus the recent tendency to split geographic forms into
species based on fixed mitochondrial differences [49,51]
but see [52] is inadequate without investigating a panel of
nuclear genes as well. Oddly, this is similar to the criticism
leveled by Zink [53] himself against the subspecies erected
based on morphological characters: when such markers or
characters are used to delimit taxa, the resulting taxon predicts little about the behaviour of the rest of the genome.
Yet taxonomic inflation caused by elevation of populations to species level based on mtDNA data is surely a
worse problem for taxonomy and conservation than difficulties at the subspecies level [54].

gains and losses on the genealogy). This estimated genealogy

sequence groups were not labeled. MG = H. melpomene melpomene (French Guiana), MP = H. melpomene rosina (Panama), CP = H. cydno chioneus (Panama), NUM = H. numata.

species boundaries on the basis of the mtDNA marker will
normally fail: we might decide that all strongly supported
branches of the mitochondrial tree in Fig. 1 were separate
species (giving 5 taxa), or we might lump all H. melpomene
with H. cydno into a single species. We would be most
unlikely to hit on the biologically relevant current species
classification, which reflects the fact that H. cydno and H.
melpomene are sympatric, morphologically and ecologically differentiated, and show strong mate choice and unisexual hybrid sterility, while French Guiana haplotype
groups form an evolutionary continuum with the Panamanian taxa across the northern coast of South America.
Genealogical paraphyly or polyphyly at individual loci are
simply not very good means of lumping taxa together as
species [5,49].

The considerable interlocus variation in mode of evolution and genealogical history demonstrates that large
numbers of sequenced loci will be needed in order to
investigate and identify phylogeny and species boundaries reliably, and even then will provide only a consensus
of genealogies, because a 'true' species phylogeny is not
possible when genealogies conflict. In particular, taxon
delimitation based on mitochondrial sequences alone
will give little insight into the behaviour of nuclear genes.
It could be argued that Heliconius is a special case, but very
appreciable per species rates of hybridization are found
both in Heliconius butterflies and in many bird groups currently undergoing mtDNA-based species delimitation and
taxonomic inflation [5]. We argue that morphological,
ecological, and behavioural data, coupled with geographical distribution data (particularly sympatry), will remain
superior to DNA sequences for species delimitation [52],
at least until larger numbers of loci can be readily analysed
using a truly 'genealogical genomics' approach.

Conclusion
This work adds to a small but growing body of DNA
sequence evidence showing that genetic material may pass
regularly between closely related animal species in nature,
millions of generations after speciation [16,20]. This work
supports the hypothesis that introgressive hybridisation
could make a significant contribution to adaptive evolution in Heliconius and in animals generally. If it is generally true that closely related, non-sibling, ecologically
distinct animal species are often permeable to introgression, the nature of such species, their ecology, causes of
speciation [1,16], phylogeny reconstruction [43], as well
as conservation issues concerning hybridizing populations [44] all require re-evaluation. In particular, phylogenetic reconstruction and diagnostic tests for species status
employing single genes must be used with great caution
[45-48]. Species boundaries in radiating groups, even in
'normal' continental species such as Heliconius, appear to
remain porous long after divergence.

Methods
Sampling methods and DNA extraction
Thirty wild butterflies were sampled (28 males and 2
females), 10 each of H. melpomene rosina from Panama, H.
melpomene melpomene from French Guiana, and H. cydno
chioneus from Panama. Sequences from H. numata were
used as outgroups. (Genealogies were also checked using
other related Heliconius, as well as H. himera as outgroups;
data not shown). Butterflies were collected in the field,
and preserved in liquid nitrogen. These samples are stored
at -70°C at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in
Panama. From each individual, 1/3 of a thorax was
ground in liquid nitrogen, and genomic DNA was

extracted using the standard phenol-chloroform method
[58].
Loci and primers
A region of mtDNA spanning the 3' end of CoI, leucinetRNA (tRNA-leu), and CoII was selected as a suitable mitochondrial region following work by Beltrán et al. [22,24].
This mitochondrial region has been used in many insect
studies, and a shorter region of CoII included within our
study was used in pioneering molecular phylogenetic
studies of the genus Heliconius [23,59]. Tpi is an important
enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism encoded by a sexlinked nuclear gene in most Lepidoptera [60]. The region

Figure 5 of Panama H. melpomene and H. cydno data
IM analysis
IM analysis of Panama H. melpomene and H. cydno data. The panels show approximate Bayesian posterior probability
distributions for effective population size of H. melpomene (θmel), H. cydno (θcyd), and the ancestor of the two species (θA). The
time since divergence of the two species (t), and the locus-specific bidirectional introgression rates are also shown (m). The
three datasets analysed are the basic IM dataset (blue), and IM reduced dataset 1 (pink) and IM reduced dataset 2 (green). Analysis of the basic IM dataset is compromised by recombination within Tpi and Ci, which is assumed not to occur in the IM algorithm. Reduced datasets containing apparently non-recombined segments of the genes were analyzed to overcome this
difficulty. IM reduced dataset 1 differs only from IM reduced dataset 2 in that a different, shorter, part of the Ci locus is used;
the low sequence information probably explains why there is little information in the former run in the last panel (probabilities
for IM dataset 1 are enhanced 10-fold in this panel only, for clarity). The curves show useful parameter estimation , except in the
case of ancestral population size (θA), the upper tail of the time of divergence (t) and the introgression for Ci for IM reduced dataset 1.

amplified spans a single intron in Heliconius [24], is inherited in a Mendelian manner and is sex-linked in Heliconius
[27,34,37,40,61] and very likely many other Lepidoptera
(e.g. Ostrinia – [62]; and Bombyx – see GenBank accession

AY734490). Mpi also spans a single intron and is encoded
by an autosomal gene. The protein product is highly polymorphic in Lepidoptera, including Heliconius [63-66].
Two other loci, Ci and Ddc were developed because of

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2006, 4:11

their possible involvement in wing pigmentation genetics
of butterflies [61]. Ci is a transcription factor serving to
activate the transcription of wingless [70], and involved in
wing-patterning in some butterflies [71]; the fragment
studied here spanned two introns. Ddc is involved in the
melanin pathway in insects, where it catalyses the conversion of dopa to dopamine [67-69]; the fragment studied
here spanned two introns.
Primers and details of methods for all the loci have been
described earlier [24,37,61,72]; further details are given in
[Additional file 1].
Because of the many insertions and deletions in the
intron-spanning sequences studied here, direct sequencing produced ambiguous base calls in heterozygotes. We
therefore separated the two alleles of nuclear loci by cloning prior to sequencing. Products amplified from genomic
DNA were run in a low-melting point agarose gel (as for
mtDNA) and the bands excised and dissolved in agarase.
The products were cloned to obtain the sequence for each
allele, using pGEM ®-T Easy Vector System II (Promega).
Five or more clones per individual were selected; re-amplified, and again purified on an agarose gel. Positive bands
were excised and dissolved using agarase.
Purification, sequencing and allele editing
Templates from all loci were cycle sequenced using primers and methods already published [24,37]. PCR will generate Taq errors of amplification, and these errors can be
'fixed' when extra steps of cloning and PCR are added [7375]. To correct these errors, we sequenced a minimum of
five clones per individual. These were aligned and sorted
into haplotype classes ('A' and 'B' where shown to be heterozygous), and the consensus sequence was deduced by
assuming that single-base Taq error was likely to occur
only once. During this procedure, we found one individual (CP569) for which one clone had a recombinant Tpi
allele, which matched the A allele for part of its length and
then the B allele for the rest, clearly resulting from Taqinduced recombination during the initial PCR stage. In no
other case could sequenced clones from each individual
be interpreted as belonging to more than two alleles of
Mpi, Tpi, Ci per individual, giving further evidence against
duplicate loci.
Testing for duplicate loci, pseudogenes and other
anomalous sequences
To test for the presence of pseudogenes and other duplicates, we checked our sequences against those already
obtained for related species, and for the stop codons
expected in pseudogene sequences. In no case did we
detect anomalies. At Mpi, there were major divergences in
sequence within species, populations and even individuals (as had already been discovered in Heliconius[24]), and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/11

as the evidence for introgression was strongest at this
locus, it was important to check for the possibility of
duplicate loci. We screened for heterozygosity using Temporal Temperature Gradient gel Electrophoresis (TTGE)
[76]. Mpi clone were run using 8 µl of double stranded
PCR product using the BioRad TTGE 'Dcode' system. Gels
contained 8% acrylamide and 1.75 M tris acetate EDTA
buffer (TAE), and were run from 46 – 53°C at a temperature ramp of 1°C per hour. In no case were more than two
alleles observed in any individual. Several broods were
also tested to verify Mendelian segregation using RFLP
polymorphisms derived from the sequence information,
and all autosomal and sex-linked loci behaved as expected
for single loci in broods mapped using AFLP markers
[34,37]. Haplotypes therefore segregate in the expected
Mendelian fashion and were inherited in complete linkage with the Mpi allozyme locus in broods of H. erato and
himera [61]. We conclude that Mpi behaves as expected for
a single-copy locus, in spite of its high intraspecific variability, which may be related to hybridization and introgression (see below).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic/genealogical
analysis
Chromatograms for all genes were edited, base calls were
checked and aligned manually. Complete original alignments are given in [Additional file 2]. All single base polymorphisms occurring in only one or two individuals
were rechecked against chromatograms to ensure they
were correctly read prior to phylogenetic analysis. All
sequences were translated to check for reading-frame
errors and stop codons. The new haplotype sequences
studied here are deposited under GenBank accessions
AF512970-AF512993 (Co), AF516210-AF516255 (Mpi),
AF545437-AF545469 (Tpi), AY429261-AY429304 (Ci),
and complete alignments are given in [Additional file 2].
Sequences were verified by aligning against Heliconius
cDNA sequences, or other Lepidoptera or Drosophila
sequences for the same gene. An unusual insertion and
deletion in Ci consisting of an approx 270 bp sequence
was found in three clones (melpomene rosina MP 545A and
MP 545B, and cydno CP 809A). This indel aligned well
between these three clones, but was unalignable with any
other sequence, including those from other Heliconius.
The region was clearly homoplasious with the rest of the
genealogy and was deleted prior to analysis. Unalignable
sequences are a widespread problem in molecular evolutionary biology [77], and their deletion can lead to a loss
of information. However, with the insertion included, the
topology was nearly identical, the main difference being
the extremely long branch lengths and similar sequences
of the three problem haplotypes tended to cause them to
group together. Net divergence estimates and shared polymorphism counts were also performed on the data set
with this unalignable region excluded. Apart from these

sequence fragments, the entire sequences were used to
obtain an estimate of genealogy.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed with PAUP* version 4.0b10 [78]. Models of sequence evolution were
compared by means of likelihood ratio tests using ModelTest 3.04 [79]. PAUP* was then used to search for the
maximum likelihood (ML) tree, based on the best fit
model and parameter estimates given by ModelTest
(Table 1) and using a heuristic search with tree bisection
reconnection (TBR). Confidence in different hypotheses
(e.g. constrained to mutual monophyly versus maximum
likelihood) was tested using the bootstrapped Shimodaira-Hasegawa likelihood-ratio test (SH test [80]) as
implemented by PAUP*.
For comparison, maximum parsimony trees were also
obtained using a heuristic search with TBR branch swapping. Confidence in each node was assessed by bootstrapping (10000 replicates also with TBR branch swapping).
Because we were most interested in branch support, we
did not analyse the data using Bayesian methods, because
the very high branch support that this method produces
has come under suspicion, and may be due to great sensitivity of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis to the form of the
prior distribution assumed [81]. In addition to phylogenetic analysis, the data were analyzed to estimate a range
of population genetic parameters. Polymorphism and
divergence estimates (Table 2, 3) were calculated using the
SITES program [82,83].
To estimate the importance of introgression, we initially
attempted to use the Wakeley-Hey (WH) algorithm
[14,83] to test the null hypothesis of equal rates of accumulation of divergence and polymorphisms, but the simulation-based computer implementation (WH) failed to
complete. This appears to be a common situation for data
of this kind where relatively few loci, highly heterogeneous for levels of divergence, are used to estimate ancestral
population sizes [14,17]. In addition, the SITES program
and the WH test are not very appropriate because they
assume an infinite sites model, under which a single site
cannot be substituted twice in the same genealogy. However, polymorphisms with three bases are quite common
in all of the rapidly evolving sequences studied here.
Another problem was that any sites with missing data or
spanned by indels in one or more aligned sequences are
ignored. Our intron data often have indels, so that,
summed over all individuals, much of the sequence may
be spanned by one or more indels leading to a complete
loss of information in SITES analyses.
We therefore analysed the data using the Isolation-Migration (IM) method [18]. The program employs a Metropolis-Coupled Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain (MCMCMC)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/11

algorithm for Bayesian estimation of genealogical parameters related to mutation and introgression in a single pair
of species. The programme has recently been upgraded to
deal with bugs which affected the HKY mutation model
used here (November 2005, Hey pers. comm.); all analyses were re-run with the new executable files. Like SITES,
the program still ignores DNA sites for which any
sequence has missing data, and the program also assumes
no recombination within each sequenced locus. SITES
revealed a certain amount of 'recombinant' sequences,
particularly at the Ci locus, so IM could give misleading
results using our data. However, SITES uses a four-gamete
test for recombination between individual sites, which is
valid only under the infinite sites mutation model, and so
gives a criterion likely to be much too strict for more realistic, HKY-type models of evolution, since repeated
changes at the same site were observed. A better clue to
recombination is the overall pattern of multi-site
sequences, and genealogical homoplasy of indels (Fig. 2,
3, 4), which may be less likely to recur via mutation than
single base pair changes (particularly transitions under
HKY and more complex models). We also tested for
recombination using a model-neutral test based on a
bootstrapped correlation of linkage disequilibrium (R2)
with physical distance [38]. Following Hey & Nielsen [18,
J. Hey pers. comm. 2005], for the IM analysis, therefore,
the data were pared down, firstly to remove any indel
information not analysable by IM, while maximizing the
sequence data (the basic IM dataset), and then subsampled to remove clearly recombinant regions, by sampling
from the 5' region of each gene until a probable recombinant pattern is observed (reduced dataset 1). Because
the 5' apparently unrecombined region of the Ci locus was
very short, we also used a different subset containing
instead the longer 3' unrecombined region of Ci (reduced
dataset 2). 'Inheritance scalars' (per locus constant effective population sizes relative to those for an autosomal
locus) were set at 0.25 for Co, 0.75 for the sex-linked Tpi,
and 1.00 for the other loci. All loci were used in each run
to estimate individual species and ancestral population
sizes θ = 4 Nµ, along with parameters time of divergence
(t), relative mutation/substitution rates rates (µ), and per
locus bidirectional gene flow (m). These parameters were
calibrated to a molecular clock to obtain parameters per
base pair and per generation via Brower's [32] estimate of
insect mitochondrial divergence of 2.3% per million years
(i.e. a neutral substitution rate, µ, of 1.15% per million
years), and with four generations per year assumed in
Heliconius. Neutral mutation (substitution rates) and
migration rates (m) were allowed to vary between loci.
However, to reduce the numbers of parameters, introgression was assumed symmetrical within each locus (using
the terminology of IM, m1=m2, i.e. option -j56). After
optimizing parameter search limits using initial runs, each
of the three datasets were run for at least 30 million steps

after burn-in under the HKY model in IM using 5 chains
per set, with linear heating increment parameters, h of
0.033, and a discarded burn-in of 200,000 steps. Actual
run durations after burn in were 35,729,000 steps for the
IM dataset, 49,769,000 steps for IM reduced dataset 1, and
54,460,000 steps for IM reduced dataset 2. The three IM
datasets used have been provided in [Additional file 2].
