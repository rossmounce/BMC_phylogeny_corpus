Abstract
Background: The most abundant family of insect cuticular proteins, the CPR family, is recognized
by the R&R Consensus, a domain of about 64 amino acids that binds to chitin and is present
throughout arthropods. Several species have now been shown to have more than 100 CPR genes,
inviting speculation as to the functional importance of this large number and diversity.
Results: We have identified 156 genes in Anopheles gambiae that code for putative cuticular
proteins in this CPR family, over 1% of the total number of predicted genes in this species.
Annotation was verified using several criteria including identification of TATA boxes, INRs, and
DPEs plus support from proteomic and gene expression analyses. Two previously recognized CPR
classes, RR-1 and RR-2, form separate, well-supported clades with the exception of a small set of
genes with long branches whose relationships are poorly resolved. Several of these outliers have
clear orthologs in other species. Although both clades are under purifying selection, the RR-1
variant of the R&R Consensus is evolving at twice the rate of the RR-2 variant and is structurally
more labile. In contrast, the regions flanking the R&R Consensus have diversified in amino-acid
composition to a much greater extent in RR-2 genes compared with RR-1 genes. Many genes are
found in compact tandem arrays that may include similar or dissimilar genes but always include just
one of the two classes. Tandem arrays of RR-2 genes frequently contain subsets of genes coding
for highly similar proteins (sequence clusters). Properties of the proteins indicated that each cluster
may serve a distinct function in the cuticle.
Conclusion: The complete annotation of this large gene family provides insight on the mechanisms
of gene family evolution and clues about the need for so many CPR genes. These data also should
assist annotation of other Anopheles genes.

Background
Arthropod cuticle consists predominantly of chitin fibers
embedded in a protein matrix [1]. While chitin is a simple

polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, there is a large number
of cuticular proteins (see [2,3] for review). The vast majority of cuticular protein sequences presently available

belong to a family with the R&R Consensus, first identified by Rebers and Riddiford [4]. An extended version of
the original Consensus has been shown to bind to chitin
[5,6], and the conformation it may adopt has been modeled [7,8]. Throughout this paper, we will use the term,
R&R Consensus, to refer to the extended Consensus and
CPR to refer to the family of genes/proteins with this Consensus. The Consensus, with about 64 amino acids,
almost always begins near a triad of aromatic residues (Y/
F-x-Y/F/W-x-Y/F) and terminates shortly after a uniformly
conserved G-F/Y (Figure 1).
While the R&R Consensus is conserved across arthropods,
its location within a cuticular protein and the nature of
the regions that flank it are highly variable. Understanding of the role of these proteins in forming the insect
exoskeleton and other cuticular structures will be facilitated by defining all of the cuticular proteins of a single
species. Accounts of the cuticular proteins with the R&R
Consensus have now been published for 28 proteins from
Apis mellifera [9] and for 101 from Drosophila melanogaster
[10]. Also 102 CPR proteins have been identified in the

genome of Tribolium castaneum (Beeman and Willis,
unpublished observations). These annotations depended
in large part on computerized genome annotation and
were not systematically verified at the mRNA or protein
level.
In the present study, we have carried out an exhaustive
manual annotation of the CPR family of An. gambiae
based on the whole genome sequence of the PEST strain
[11]. These annotations are being facilitated and verified
by a proteomics analysis of cuticles [[12], He unpublished
observations] and accompanied by an analysis of gene
expression with real-time RT-PCR [13]. In addition,
ambiguous gene models have been confirmed or revised
by sequencing RT-PCR or RACE products. This work has
identified 156 genes coding for CPR proteins. Hence over
1% of the genes of An. gambiae are devoted to just this one
family of cuticular proteins.
An investigation of cuticular proteins in An. gambiae carried out prior to whole genome sequencing was particularly informative for the present annotation study. Dotson
et al. [14] sequenced a 17.4 kb insert in a genomic library
constructed from the Sua strain. This region had three
CPR genes that were at least 98% identical in their coding
regions, yet differed in 5' and 3' UTRs as well as their
introns. Hence, the lesson learned was that virtually identical genes can reside in compact tandem arrays, yet can be
recognized as distinct and not an assembly artefact
because of the differences in the non-coding regions associated with them.
CPR proteins can be divided into groups according to
which variant of the extended R&R Consensus they possess. Two major groups have been named RR-1 and RR-2
while a third group (RR-3) has been identified but from
only a small number of sequences [15,16]. It is unclear
whether RR-3s are an evolutionarily distinct group; for the
present analysis we include RR-3 genes within the RR-1
class. A Hidden Markov Model can be employed at the
cuticle DB web server [17] to assign proteins as RR-1 or
RR-2 [10]. Our analysis confirms that the bulk of RR-1
and RR-2 proteins form non-overlapping clades in An.
gambiae, separated by a small set of long-branch RR-1, RR2, and RR-3 proteins that are probably an artificial group.
In addition to assembling information that supports
annotation, we have analyzed the structure of these
clades, examined patterns of molecular evolution, compared the amino acid composition of the different proteins and identified characteristics of each group. We now
have further appreciation of the complexity of the insect
cuticle and clues about the need for so many CPR genes.

Results and Discussion
Overview
We have annotated 156 genes that have the potential to
code for proteins with the R&R Consensus. RR-2 genes
were 65% of the total. Genes are named in the order in
which they were annotated. (See Methods for further
details.) Their locations on chromosomes are given in Figure 2 and Additional Files 1, 2, 3, 4. We recognized eight
tandem arrays (highlighted in gray) in which genes are
typically spaced a few kb and never more than 20 kb apart.
We also recognized eight sequence clusters, highlighted in
different colors, and named by their order on chromosomes based on Ensembl genomic coordinates, e.g. 2LA,
2LB, and 2LC. Detailed information supporting each
sequence cluster is provided in Cornman and Willis (MS
in preparation). The same highlighting scheme is used for
Figure 2 and on all relevant Tables.
Validation of annotation
The 156 putative genes coding for proteins with the R&R
Consensus is the largest group validated to date for any
species. EST support from public sequence databases
obtained at [18] had to be evaluated carefully, requiring
matches in unique non-translated regions, because of the
similarities within groups of genes. When this was done,
a combination of available EST sequences and RACE and
RT-PCR products sequenced by our laboratory confirmed
55% of the sequences (Additional File 3). A further 42%
were confirmed as unique genes in the G3 strain by
obtaining single-copy kinetics with qPCR on genomic
DNA and confirming their expression with qRT-PCR
(Additional File 3, [13]). Most primers for this analysis
were designed around the stop codon to take advantage of
the higher level of variation in the 3' UTR. Together these
data uniquely confirm the large majority of annotated
genes. Using the SignalP web tool [19], we also confirmed
that each predicted protein had a valid signal peptide, an
essential feature of secreted proteins. The presence of a
TATA box and INR (initiator element) in 93% of the genes
(see below) provided additional confirmation of the reality of these genes. Indeed, these features were important in
several cases where Ensembl had predicted a single gene
with multiple R&R Consensus regions, yet manual annotation revealed that multiple genes were present. A proteomics analysis based on head capsules and pupal
cuticles left behind after a molt and some batch prepared
cuticles [[12], He unpublished observations] revealed
unique peptide(s) for 75 of these genes and shared peptides for an additional 70, having excluded those with
only DGDVVK, a very common peptide. This information
confirms 48% of genes we annotated as authentic components of the cuticle, and if we include proteins with shared
peptides the proportion rises to 93% (Figure 2, Additional
File 3). Finally, a combination of all of the supporting
data has provided at least some support for all 156 CPR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/22

proteins (Additional File 3). Given that our experimental
work was carried out on the G3 strain, not the PEST strain
that was the source of the annotated genome, we were
gratified by the support we found.
Did we identify all of the genes with the R&R Consensus?
We only included three genes on unplaced contigs (i.e.,
on the ''UNKN'' chromosome). We had information
about these three genes that supported their inclusion in
our analysis. Fifteen of the 22 genes we ignored were on
contigs less than 1 kb, and the longest was on a contig of
only 2966 nucleotides. We assumed that these represent
alternative haplotypes present in the PEST strain, which is
reasonable given the level of haplotype variation that has
been observed [11]. In one case, we omitted a tract of five
candidate genes on chromosome 2R that are nearly identical to, but a subset of, another set of genes (CPR115 –
CPR123 and CPR154) approximately 1 Mb away. The
intergenic sequence in this tract was in some regions completely unresolved whereas in other regions it was virtually identical, preventing any direct verification of the tract
by PCR. To ascertain whether all of these candidate genes
were likely to be present in the PEST strain, we performed
qPCR on genomic DNA with a primer set that included
intronic sequences and was complementary to a subset of
the candidate genes in question. We compared the data to
results for a known single copy gene (chitin synthase,
AGAP001748), which indicated that the actual number of
targets was between five and six and not eight as expected
if all of the candidate genes in the assembled genome were
actually present (data not shown). This result was consistent with only the annotated genes being present in PEST;
an identical result was also obtained with the G3 strain.
The coordinates of the omitted sequences (labelled DUPL
A-E) are provided in Additional File 1 for reference, but we
believe there is insufficient evidence of their validity to
warrant their inclusion in the present analysis. Thus, given
the diverse data we used to annotate and confirm the CPR
genes and our exhaustive BLAST searches, it is unlikely
that many genes were missed or are artifacts of assembly
or incorrect annotation. We also identified two pseudogenes as shown in Additional File 1, but we did not
include them as named members of the gene family and
they were excluded from analyses of molecular evolution.
Seventy-six percent of the gene models are modifications
or new genes relative to the Ensembl data available at the
time the annotations were done. See Methods for details
on retrieving all the sequences.
Orthologs
Further verification of the annotation comes from
orthologs in D. melanogaster. The data on orthologs are
summarized in Additional File 5 where obvious differences between pairs are highlighted. Such comparisons
reveal an important complication in the discovery of dis-

tant orthologs, namely that high-scoring reciprocal BLAST
hits may be restricted to the R&R Consensus region with
little conservation of the flanking sequence. This creates
ambiguity as to whether a gene is a genuine ortholog or a
product of parallel evolution or domain shuffling. We
present data in Additional File 5 on sequence identity in
both the Consensus and the total protein and have
retained putative orthologs only in cases where the evidence was compelling or interesting.
We found good orthologs for seven of the 15 proteins that
had over 300 amino acids in their mature form. This indicates that there is something important about their structure that has been preserved for about 250 myr [9].
There are instances where the regions flanking the Consensus are quite different in an ortholog pair, such as
AgamCPR132 and DmelCry, a D. melanogaster lens protein [20]. The An. gambiae protein has a stretch of 20
glutamines in a row, while the D. melanogaster protein
with almost the same percentage of glutamines has no
cluster longer than 7. Given the propensity of glutamines
to form amyloid-like structures, this suggests that the
structure of the cuticle will be somewhat different in the
two species. The length of the longest glutamine repeat
was variable among the more than 50 cDNAs and ESTs
that have been deposited in public databases from different strains (median = 23). Interestingly, while the long
glutamine tracts in Huntington's and other human diseases are based on the expansion of just CAG repeats [21];
the long An. gambiae cluster uses both CAG and CAA
codons. Cry along with AgamCPR132 had numerous
repeats of RREE that may make a contribution to protein
structure comparable to a stretch of glutamines.
Another example is illustrated by AgamCPR152 and the
D. melanogaster protein resilin (CG15920). Resilin is a
cuticular protein that confers elastic properties to specific
regions of cuticle [22]. While the extended Consensus
region of the two has 76% identity, the other regions of
the protein are totally different. AgamCPR152 has 20%
histidine residues, resilin had only 1 histidine. Dmelresilin is 35% glycine, AgamCPR152 only 12%. This is a clear
case where the regions flanking the Consensus are not
related in the two species. So is there a resilin gene in
Anopheles? Lyons et al. [23] have made a recombinant protein with 16 units of a repeat (AQTPSSQYGAP) from an
An. gambiae EST (BX61961) identified in a BLAST search
using the Drosophila gene. When properly cross-linked,
this protein has the same resilient elastic properties as a
comparable multimer made with the D. melanogaster resilin repeat (GGRPSDSYGAPGGGN). The An. gambiae
sequence corresponds to the incompletely annotated gene
AGAP002367. This gene has 10 perfect copies of the
repeat and three additional ones that differ in one amino

acid. It lacks, however, an R&R Consensus even after probable errors in the original annotation were corrected and
no Consensus region lurks in the surrounding 10 kb. This
may well be a situation where domain shuffling has
occurred.
Several other orthologs merit comment. While all other
An. gambiae CPR proteins have only a single R&R Consensus region, there are three versions of it in AgamCPR144
and its orthologs DmelCpr73D and Tribolium
GLEAN_16311. All three share other features.
AgamCPR138 is a clear ortholog of the D. melanogaster
protein l(3)mbn. The latter is longer, but they share two
interesting features, the C-terminal position of the R&R
Consensus and the presence of two cysteine residues that
are rarely found in mature CPRs. We identified orthologs
for two of the six An. gambiae genes that lacked the aromatic triad; one had a diad, the other only a single aromatic residue signifying the start of the R&R Consensus.
Each had an ortholog with the same atypical feature.
Of the six CPR genes on the X chromosome, we identified
orthologs for five, but only AgamCPR129 has an ortholog
that also resides on the X chromosome in D. melanogaster.
The other four orthologs are on 3R and three unrelated
genes with the R&R Consensus are on the D. melanogaster
X chromosome. It was apparent from this limited number
of orthologs, that genes that are on either 2L or 3L in An.
gambiae reside on 3L in D. melanogaster.
Core promoter regions and polyA addition sites
For each gene, we summarized the presence of a TATA
box, the position and sequence of its INR if one could be
identified, and other features (Additional File 3). Analysis
of the core promoter region was possible for 153 genes;
the other three had their 5' region determined by RACE,
since the genomic sequence was populated by a string of
"Ns", an intra-contig gap, in the relevant regions. The vast
majority, 126/153 (82%), of the CPR genes have a conventional TATA box (TATAAA). An additional 19 have a
variant TATA box, including those in sequence cluster 2LC
where 13/16 genes appeared to use TATTTAA. In all 145
cases where a TATA box was used, we were able to identify
a putative INR. Cherbas and Cherbas [24] reported four
common INRs in D. melanogaster, TCAGT, ACAGT,
GCAGT, and TCATT. These sequences comprise 71% of
the INRs we identified. Variants are shown in Additional
File 3, some of which (italicized) were confirmed by 5'
RACE, others were deduced by their distance downstream
from the TATA box and the presence of an adenine in the
third position. For seven of the eight genes with no known
TATA box, we were able to identify INRs and putative
DPEs (downstream promoter elements) [25]. The conventional polyA addition site (AATAAA) was found in 84% of
the CPR genes within the first 500 nucleotides after the

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:22

stop codon. Alternative sites (AATACA, AATATA, AATTAA) have been reported from some Bombyx cuticular protein genes [26,27]. We found the first two types in 14
additional genes. Hence all but 7% of the 153 genes that
had sufficient C-terminal sequence data available had
known polyA addition sites. The presence of appropriate
untranslated flanking regions is further evidence for the
authenticity of the genes we have annotated.
Patterns of gene architecture
As is evident from Additional Files 1 and 2, An. gambiae
CPR genes show considerable variation in exon position
and length. Complete coding sequences from genomic
DNA are obtainable for 154 of these proteins; two others,
with "Ns" in the genomic data, were obtained by sequencing RACE products. Eighteen sequences had only a single
exon, 11 of which were in sequence cluster 2LC; one
sequence had five exons. The majority (55%) had two
exons, with three and four exons present in 25%, and 8%,
respectively. A large majority (86%) of genes with introns
had an interruption in the region coding for the signal
peptide, resulting in short first exons of from 3–36 nucleotides long, excluding the 5'UTR. Both the median and
mode were 12. Short first introns are not unique to CPR
genes but are an obstacle to gene annotation. This is
because several plausible first exons may fit a well-supported gene model and because EST support for first exons
is sometimes lacking. We cloned and sequenced RACE
products from the G3 strain to verify some problematic
first exons (see Additional File 3), but we did not do so
routinely for gene models that were well supported by
similarity to related CPR genes.

Intron number is variable throughout the CPR phylogeny,
suggesting that intron loss or gain has occurred repeatedly. Overall, however, there are general patterns that distinguish the exon structure of RR-1 and RR-2 genes. There
are fewer RR-2 genes with more than two introns than RR1 genes (23% vs. 52%), and exon-intron boundaries are
more strongly biased toward phase 0 (i.e. between
codons) in RR-2 genes (96% of introns) than in RR-1
genes (63%). Furthermore, the interruption of the Consensus region by an intron is less common in RR-2 genes
(15%) than in RR-1 genes (49%). Indels are very rare in
the aligned RR-2 Consensus region and span at most two
codons, whereas the aligned RR-1 Consensus region has
extensive indels, particularly near the center of the alignment. Thus, the two classes differ substantially in the
structural diversity of the R&R Consensus. These architectural differences also suggest that RR-2 proteins may be
more amenable to novel gene formation by transposition
of an intact R&R Consensus domain, although such an
occurrence has not been demonstrated for a CPR gene.

Strain variation in gene number
While there has been no systematic survey of variation in
CPR gene number within a species, serendipitous findings
of gene copy number variation suggest that it may be common, particularly in large tandem arrays. For example,
investigators have identified strain variation in CPR gene
number within D. melanogaster [10,28]. In the present
study, we identified a large tandem array of RR-2 genes on
3R that appears to be particularly dynamic with respect to
gene copy number. Previously, Dotson et al. [14] had
sequenced a 17.4 kb genomic clone from the Sua strain of
An. gambiae and identified 3 CPR genes (Agcp2a,b,c) in
this genomic region. We were able to identify orthologs
for all three genes in the PEST strain, but Agcp2b (CPR97)
is separated from 2c (CPR100) by 24.3 kb rather than 3.5
kb (Figure 3, Additional File 1). That larger region has six
additional CPR genes. Two are in the same sequence cluster, one belongs to another sequence cluster, and three are
single-copy genes. We have not investigated if the additional region or its component genes are present somewhere else in the Sua strain. Whether copy number
variation is prevalent or adaptive in natural populations
remains to be determined.

An inversion on chromosome 2L in some strains of An.
gambiae is of particular interest because one form (2La)
correlates with desiccation resistance and vector competence discussed in Sharakhov et al. [29]. Their careful
mapping of the inversion boundaries enabled us to place
it in the context of the genes we have annotated with the
surprising result that there are 73 CPR genes within the
inverted region (Figure 2, Additional File 1). We used
inversion specific primers [30] to verify that the G3 strain,
which we used for analysis, is heterozygous for the inversion (data not shown).
General protein properties
A summary of protein properties is in Table 1 and Additional File 4. The CPR proteins averaged 169 residues
(minus the signal peptide), with a considerable range,
87–837. The major feature of the CPR proteins is, of
course, the presence of the R&R Consensus (see Figure 1).
In all but six sequences, it began with the aromatic triad
described above; in four cases only a diad was found, and
in two cases a single aromatic residue defined the start of
the Consensus region. The position of the start of the R&R
Consensus ranges from the fourth to the 90th percentile of
the length of the mature protein, and the average position
was just at the start of the second quartile (27th percentile). Glycine and alanine are major amino acids; 26 proteins have over one fourth of their residues as just these
two amino acids. Three RR-1 proteins (CPR79, CPR133,
and CPR153) had over 40% of their residues as a combination of just these two amino acids. Proline is another
major amino acid in many of the proteins, reaching 15%

Example of strain variation in gene number and/or order within An. gambiae. Orthologous genomic regions from
the Sua and PEST strains that contain different numbers of CPR genes are depicted. The Sua clone sequenced by Dotson et al.
[14] contains three CPR genes, two of which, Agcp2b and Agcp2c, are orthologs of the genes CPR97 and CPR100 that we identified in the PEST strain. Due to a duplication event, the other Sua gene, Agcp2a, is orthologous to both the first half of the
pseudogene PseudoA and the second half of CPR96. The intergenic regions between the three Sua genes are also present in the
PEST genome sequence, but there is also an additional 24.3 kb segment containing six additional CPR genes. It is not known
whether this segment is absent in the Sua strain or has simply been rearranged relative to PEST. Diagram is not drawn to scale;

in CPR79; the average was 7%. Both proline and glycineglycine pairs tend to introduce kinks in protein chains and
thereby influence protein chain folding [2]. Both histidine
and lysine have been shown to be involved in sclerotization, the cross-linking of quinone derivatives to the proteins [31]. On average, RR-2 genes have more histidine
residues, 11% vs. 2% (Table 1, Additional File 4).
We used principal components analysis (PCA) of the
amino-acid composition matrix to further investigate patterns of variation in amino-acid content of RR-1 and RR-2
proteins. For this analysis, we excluded cysteine and

methionine because these two amino acids are virtually
absent from mature CPR proteins (Additional File 4),
hence their removal reduces the dimensionality and noise
of the composition matrix. Figure 4 shows a scatterplot of
all CPR proteins along the two major principal component axes, which together explain 57% of the total variation. The labelled vectors represent the relative
contribution of each amino acid to the variation
explained by these two axes. Not surprising given the
composition values mentioned above, alanine, histidine,
and glycine are prominent in discriminating among proteins. Two features of CPR diversity are particularly appar-

Scatterplot representing variation in amino-acid content of all putative An. gambiae CPR proteins. The horizontal and vertical axes are the first and second principal
components, respectively, of the amino-acid composition
matrix after removal of the predicted signal peptide. The
labeled vectors indicate the relative loadings of each amino
acid in the first and second principal components. The amino
acids cysteine and methionine, which are scarce in mature
CPR proteins (0.03 and 0.4% respectively), were excluded
from the composition matrix. The percentage of the total
variation explained by each axis is also given. RR-1 and RR-2
proteins are indicated separately according to the legend. PC
axis 1 and 2 = 33.4 + 23.5 = 57% of total variation. The major
loadings for the first five PC axes (82% of the variation) are:
A, H, G-Q, V, Q-Y. RR-1 and RR-2 are strongly separated on
the second axis and RR-2s have more variation overall.

ent from Figure 4. First, RR-1 proteins show much less
variation in amino-acid composition than RR-2 proteins.
Secondly, RR-1 and RR-2 proteins are strongly discriminated by the second principal-component axis, for which
the proportion of histidine is the most strongly loaded
variable.
Commonly occurring sequence motifs
Within the two major classes of the R&R Consensus
sequence, some common variants are recognizable that
extend the region of alignable sequence in the N- or C-terminal directions for a subset of genes. One common variant found in RR-1 genes has a proline-rich region adjacent
to the defined Consensus (Figure 1), which can be approximated by the expression GFQPQGxHxPxPPP. A second
common variant is found in RR-2 genes at the C-terminus
of the R&R Consensus, approximated by the expression
GFNAVV(HR)RE(GP). Also present in 38 RR-2 genes was
RDGDVVKG. All three of these variants occur in tandem
gene arrays in An. gambiae as well as other Dipterans, indicating that they arose to high frequency by tandem gene
duplication (Cornman and Willis, MS in preparation).
The first two, however, are also present in Apis and Tribo-

CPR genes frequently contain low complexity sequence in
the regions flanking the R&R Consensus, and several common repeats have been recognized (reviewed in [2,3]).
Andersen et al. [2] described a common repeat in cuticular
proteins, AAP(A/V). We identified this repeat or a variant
form, AAPL, in one quarter of An. gambiae CPR proteins
(Additional File 4). To systematically search for more
complex sequence patterns outside of the R&R Consensus, we used the MEME server (see Methods). For this
analysis, we removed the signal peptide and R&R Consensus so that they would not influence the motif search. We
submitted all annotated An. gambiae and Aedes aegypti
CPR genes to achieve the best representation of sequence
variation, and we ensured that no putative motif spanned
the artificial gap created by removing the Consensus. To
eliminate the effect of duplication per se, we ignored any
motifs present only within a single sequence cluster.
Given the high proportion of low-complexity sequence,
we also required that the motif be more than five aminoacids long. Only one motif was found that met these criteria, a 16 amino-acid motif that is present at or very near
the C-terminus of all sequences that contain it. All An.
gambiae genes with this motif are RR-2 genes that occur on
chromosome 2L. A sequence logo representation of
observed matches is shown in Figure 5A. The positionspecific scoring matrix for this motif, which can be used to
search custom datasets via the MAST option of the MEME
server, is presented as Additional File 6. When we compared the motif matches to the full alignment of protein
sequences, it was apparent that a more concise motif
could be obtained (Figure 5B) by removing the first position and allowing single-position indels. It is interesting
to note that this motif is rich in histidine, which is along
with alanine and glycine a major contributor to variation
in amino-acid composition among CPR proteins as discussed above. We show in a later section that this modified motif is under purifying selection.
Phylogeny and genomic organization of CPR genes
In An. gambiae, CPR proteins cannot generally be aligned
outside of the R&R Consensus and signal peptide, consistent with the pattern of insect CPRs generally. We therefore
based our phylogenetic analysis on the region that spans
the R&R Consensus from the fifth position N-terminal to
the tenth position C-terminal of the pfam00379 sequence
(Figure 1). We included these flanking regions because,
while they are not alignable across all An. gambiae CPRs,
they incorporate common sequence variants that are
alignable within large subsets of genes and thus are phylogenetically informative. However, we double-weighted

all positions from the aromatic triad to two positions past
the final invariant glycine (Figure 1) as these positions can
be aligned across all CPRs. We used amino-acid sequence
rather than codon-aligned nucleotide sequence because
mutational saturation of the latter is evident across the
gene family as a whole.
The neighbor-joining phylogeny we recovered identifies
two main groups that constitute the core RR-1 and RR-2
proteins. Figure 6 shows the overall topology of the tree;
detailed phylogenies of RR-1 and RR-2 genes are presented as Figures 7 and 8. The RR-2 clade has much
shorter branch lengths on average than the RR-1 clade
because the former group is dominated by sequence clusters. Several long-branch genes lie between the main RR-1
and RR-2 clades. This group has low bootstrap support
and is probably an artificial group caused by long-branch
attraction. Both RR-1 and RR-2 genes are present in this
group. The group includes five of the six X-chromosome
genes as well as all three genes that match the "RR-3" designation of Andersen et al. [16] which are indicated in Figure 6. Removal of this group of long-branch genes raises
bootstrap support for the core RR-1 and RR-2 clades to
100% (results not shown).
CPR genes are found on all of the chromosomal arms
except for the Y chromosome but have a biased distribution with 51% occurring on 2L and 28% occurring on 3R.
Phylogenetically, genes show a very strong tendency to

cluster by chromosome (Figure 2, Figure 6), indicating
that inter-chromosome duplications are rare. RR-1 and
RR-2 tandem arrays show no overlap on chromosomes
(Figure 2, Additional File 1) and contain few non-CPR
genes.
Evolutionary patterns within the R&R Consensus and
flanking sequence
The pattern of natural selection acting during the evolutionary history of a gene family can be illuminated by
comparing the rate of nucleotide substitutions that
change the protein sequence (Ka) to the rate of nucleotide
substitutions that do not (Ks). Coding sequences that
have a ratio of Ka to Ks equal to one are evolving in a manner consistent with neutrality, that is, nonsynonymous
mutations are as likely to be fixed as synonymous ones.
Ka/Ks greater than one indicates a higher rate of aminoacid substitution than expected under neutrality and
implies that positive selection has driven the divergence
from the ancestral state. Ka/Ks lower than one implies that
changes in protein sequence are selected against on average.

To investigate the possibility of adaptive evolution of the
R&R Consensus during the diversification of CPR genes,
we calculated Ka/Ks within this region for all An. gambiae
paralog pairs and An. gambiae – Ae. aegypti ortholog pairs
that we identified. For this analysis, we used a shortened
version of pfam00379, in which we excluded the first

Detailed phylogenies of the RR-1 and RR-2 clades are presented as Figures 7 and 8. Distances are based on the amino-acid
sequence of the aligned and weighted R&R Consensus as described in the text. We used the JTT exchange matrix [49] as
implemented in MEGA3 [48]. The core group of RR-1 and RR-2 proteins and an intermediate group of RR-1, RR-2, and RR-3
proteins are marked. The sequence clusters defined in the text are also marked. Symbols represent the chromosome arm on

seven positions, to define a more strict R&R Consensus for
An. gambiae. This was done because the alignment of the
first seven sites across all RR-1 or RR-2 proteins was
ambiguous and therefore not useful for analyses of substitution patterns.
One difficulty with the interpretation of Ka/Ks ratios
between functional paralogs is that a finding of increased
Ka/Ks after duplication may be explained by relaxed selection on initially redundant genes or by adaptive evolution
at some fraction of sites within a functionally constrained
sequence, or both successively. Only if Ka/Ks is substantially greater than one is adaptive evolution strongly
implicated, although it remains a possible explanation for
even small increases in Ka/Ks. Codon-based models of
nucleotide substitution are potentially more useful
because they can identify individual sites under selection
within a local region of low Ka/Ks, but their power is
strongly dependent on sample size [32] and the actual
pattern of selection. We used both approaches to investi-

gate the molecular evolution of the chitin-binding R&R
Consensus, which has a well-characterized secondary
structure and both labile and highly conserved positions
[8,33].
Figure 9 shows mean Ka/Ks for all pairwise comparisons
among single-copy RR-1 and RR-2 paralogs, respectively,
for which the Jukes-Cantor corrected Ks is less than 2 (to
reduce the effect of mutational saturation). The Ka/Ks
between ortholog pairs in An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti with
corrected Ks < 2 are also shown for comparison. Ka/Ks is
higher on average among RR-1 paralogs than RR-2. A significant fraction of RR-1 gene pairs have Ka/Ks greater
than 1, whereas RR-2 genes pairs have Ka/Ks almost exclusively below 1. Interestingly, the six CPR genes on the X
chromosome (CPR125 – CPR130) were all among the
genes with the highest average pairwise Ka/Ks (Table 2).
This finding accords with previous work [34] that found a
significant increase in the Ka/Ks of X-linked versus autosomal duplicates in D. melanogaster. The higher rate of

evolution of X-linked duplicates is a theoretical prediction
if one assumes that most advantageous mutations are
recessive and hence more visible to selection when Xlinked [35].
We next used codon- and branch-based tests of selection
to test for positive selection on the R&R Consensus of An.
gambiae CPRs. We used the single-likely-ancestor counting
method, SLAC [32], and GA-Branch method [36] implemented by the DataMonkey web server [37]. The SLAC
method identifies individual codons that deviate from
neutral expectation with respect to nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions, whereas the GA-Branch
method identifies lineages of a phylogeny that differ in
overall Ka/Ks. Subsets of CPR genes were investigated by
submitting well supported interior clades that are likely to
have experienced less mutational saturation and by
removing highly similar gene duplicates. In no case did
we find any positively selected sites within the R&R Consensus at P < 0.05, whereas a large majority of sites were

found to be under negative selection. Conceptually similar but methodologically distinct methods for identifying
sites under positive selection were also implemented with
the codeml program of the PAML package [38] and gave
similar results. Specifically, evolutionary models that
included a category of Ka/Ks > 1 in addition to either a single category of Ka/Ks < 1 or a beta distribution of Ka/Ks <
1 were not significantly more likely than models that did
not include positive selection (codeml model options 2
versus 1 and options 8 versus 7, respectively, 2ΔlnL ≈ 0 for
both comparisons). Thus, diversification of the CPR gene
family does not appear to have been driven by strong positive selection on specific sites within the R&R Consensus.
We estimated the global branch Ka/Ks within the R&R
Consensus under the beta-distribution model (model 7)
of codeml, which was significantly more likely than a single Ka/Ks < 1 category (model 1) for both the RR-1 and
RR-2 clades (P << 0.01), and after removing all but one
haphazardly chosen gene of each sequence cluster. The
evolutionary rate of amino-acid substitutions was more
than twofold higher within the RR-1 clade (Ka/Ks =
0.271) than within the RR-2 clade (Ka/Ks = 0.118).
Although no sites or sites within lineages showed significant evidence of positive selection, the relative rates of
amino-acid evolution are nonetheless variable among lineages, as indicated by Tajima's test [39]. The most notable
example is the branch leading to the 3RB sequence cluster
(Figures 6, 8) compared with the linked sequence clusters
3RA and 3RC (average P < 0.01 across all possible gene
comparisons for the three sequence clusters). Since we
found no support for elevated Ka/Ks occurring along this
or any other lineage as described above, the high rate of
evolution in the 3RB sequence cluster appears to be due to
mutation-rate variation alone. Consistent with this inter-

Page 12 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:22

pretation, the 3RB sequence cluster has a substantially
lower GC content (36.9%) than the other 3R sequence
clusters (46.7%), suggesting divergent mutational histories. This localized difference in GC content is surprising
given the very tight linkage of the genes in these three
sequence clusters (Additional File 1).
We also performed a SLAC analysis on all examples of the
motif identified by MEME (aligned with indels) from An.
gambiae and Ae. aegypti. Ten of fifteen sites were found to
be under purifying selection at P < 0.05, as shown in Figure 5B, and the Ka/Ks for the region was estimated to be
0.42 (95% C.I. 0.39, 0.65). While the motif is evidence of
sequence conservation among paralogs outside the R&R
Consensus, the level of conservation is somewhat less
than what is seen among single-copy orthologs in the two
mosquito genomes (Ka/Ks of 0.08 – 0.33 with the R&R
Consensus removed).
Our analysis of the CPR gene family in An. gambiae reveals
that a high number of paralogs can be retained in insect
genomes with remarkably low rates of pseudogene formation. The retention of these paralogous single-copy genes
or sequence clusters over periods of 100 million years or
more, as evidenced by orthologs in Ae. aegypti (Cornman
and Willis, MS in preparation), implies that there has
been extensive functional diversification of this group. We
do not yet know the nature of this functional diversification, although there is certainly broad variation in the
complement of CPR proteins expressed at different developmental stages and in different tissues as evidenced by
gene expression and proteomic studies ([12,13], He
unpublished data). There are also a few examples from D.
melanogaster of CPR proteins that have been shown to be
essential components of specialized cuticular structures,
such as crystallin in the eyes [22] and resilin in wing tendons, ligaments, etc. [22,23]. Nonetheless, codon-based
analyses of the R&R Consensus of An. gambiae CPR proteins failed to identify any sites under positive selection,
although such tests can have limited power to detect
ancient positive selection and Ka/Ks>1 within gene families is rarely found [40].
Our comparison of the RR-1 and RR-2 classes presents an
interesting dichotomy regarding the diversification of the
R&R Consensus and flanking sequences. The R&R Consensus of the RR-1 class has higher rates of amino-acid
evolution and is structurally much more variable than the
RR-2 family, and a number of RR-1 proteins have average
pairwise Ka/Ks approaching one, many times higher than
the mean Ka/Ks for orthologous pairs in An. gambiae and
Ae. aegypti. To the extent that there has been adaptive evolution of the chitin-binding Consensus, it has probably
been more prevalent in the RR-1 clade. In contrast, the RR2 clade appears to have diversified in terms of amino-acid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/22

composition to a much greater extent than the RR-1 class
and in general there is a higher frequency of histidine residues, which are involved in cross-linking, in this group. It
seems likely that the functional diversification of the RR2 group derives to a greater extent from the properties of
the sequence flanking the Consensus than from any particular changes in the chitin-binding sequence itself.
One of the most remarkable features of this gene family in
An. gambiae, the presence of sequence clusters of highly
similar genes, begs investigation as to the possible selective advantage of increased copy number for these particular genes. A separate analysis of these genes was too
extensive to include here, but our unpublished data indicate that these proteins have complex repeats and unusual
amino-acid compositions relative even to other RR-2 proteins. Furthermore, different sequence clusters appear to
have independently acquired compact gene architectures,
perhaps as a response to selection for increased gene
expression, and concerted evolution in addition to purifying selection appears to be an important mode by which
protein similarity is maintained in these groups.

Conclusion
We have identified 156 genes containing the R&R Consensus in the genome sequence of An. gambiae; many
have been confirmed experimentally. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes reveals three broad groups, the core RR1 and RR-2 groups plus an intermediate, long-branched
group that is probably artificial. The RR-2 class is dominated by sets of highly similar genes that we have termed
sequence clusters. The RR-1 class of the R&R Consensus
has a higher evolutionary rate than the RR-2 class, whereas
the latter group has a greater diversity of amino-acid composition in the flanking sequences. The multiplicity of
almost identical genes within sequences clusters suggests
that their amplification may serve to allow massive protein synthesis during the brief periods of cuticle secretion.
In addition, and perhaps most importantly, differences
among sequence clusters, the rarity of pseudogenes, and
the presence of good orthologs for several single-copy
genes all indicate that the distinct CPR proteins serve
important and unique roles in the cuticle.

Methods
Annotation of sequences
Prior to the availability of sequences from completely
sequenced insect genomes, there were 98 insect cuticular
proteins sequences available that had the R&R Consensus.
Where corresponding genes were known, they were generally simple, with rarely more than two exons. The first
intron frequently interrupted the region coding for the signal peptide. The second exon also began in a relatively
conserved position close to or interrupting the nucleotides that coded for an aromatic triad near the N-termi-

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:22

nus of the extended Consensus [3]. This triad is Y/F-x-Y/F/
W-x-Y/F. These simple and consistent features guided the
annotation of the An. gambiae genome. We also used the
information from [14] that genes that coded for nearly
identical proteins would differ in their 5' and 3' UTRs.
We investigated all gene predictions that contained the
pfam00379 motif by searching the Ensembl Anopheles
Web Site [41] with IPR000618 Additional sequences were
identified when our proteomics project [12] turned up
peptides indicative of belonging to a previously unannotated protein with the R&R Consensus. Additional BLAST
searches and dot-matrix plots were also employed to confirm that we had identified all genes.
We examined each candidate gene to identify essential or
common gene features, namely a TATA box, INR [24], signal peptide (identified by SignalP [19,42], R&R Consensus sequence, and poly-adenylation site (AATAAA or
rarely AATACA). These were manually identified, guided
whenever possible by ESTs available via BLAST searching
[18]. The program Splice Predictor [43] was used to guide
identification of splice sites. In a few cases, putative
orthologs in other species provided valuable clues. For a
few of the more difficult sequences, we used 5' or 3' RACE
or RT-PCR to verify/complete the sequence. (See Additional File 7 for primers used). Such experimental work
was, of necessity, done with the G3 strain as the PEST
strain used for the whole genome sequencing no longer
exists. Once sequences were annotated we used SPIDEY
[44] to locate the coordinates on the appropriate contig.
We present only positions that correspond to the coding
sequence itself.
A summary of all annotated genes, their properties, and
the nature of supporting evidence is given in Figure 2 and
Additional Files 1, 2, 3. Genes in these tables are ordered
by their appearance on chromosome arms. We were
advised not to use chromosome bands for names as had
been done for some of the D. melanogaster genes coding
for cuticular proteins [10], so we settled for naming them
simply as CPR#. When the genes are discussed in the context of genes in other species, their complete name should
be AgamCPR#. Genes were named in the order in which
they were annotated; so many names were added out of
numerical order. We have provided the VectorBase stable
identifiers that begin with AGAP in Additional File 1. A
few genes that are incorrect are noted. CPR150–156 were
not available when the naming occurred and no Ensembl
gene names exist for these.
Definitive gene names, sequences (both cDNA and protein), plus contig locations were submitted to Ensembl
and can be found at [45]. Protein sequences are also available at cuticleDB [17,46].

cDNA cloning
For genes with ambiguous predictions, RT-PCR or RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was performed. RNA
isolation and RT-PCR procedures were described before
[13,47]. All RACE products except for 3' RACE of CPR140
and CPR152 were obtained with the GeneRacer® kit (Invitrogen) using their SuperScript III reverse transcriptase.
The 5' RACE product should reach the transcription start
site. All PCR products were amplified with tag primers
and/or gene specific primers listed in Additional File 7 by
LA Taq or Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and cloned in pGEM-T Easy
(Promega) or pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) plasmid vectors.
For CPR140 and CPR152 3' RACE, first strand cDNA was
synthesized by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with an oligo dT-anchor primer (5'GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGACT23-3'), a modified version of the primer from the Roche RACE kit. A PCR anchor
primer (5'-GACCACGCGTATCGATGTCGAC-3') and
gene-specific primers were used with these two cDNAs.
These modifications were necessary because the 3' RACE
primers provided by Invitrogen frequently amplified
incorrect regions of the An. gambiae genome by priming at
both ends of a sequence. All other gene-specific primers
used are given in Additional File 7.
Phylogenetics and sequence analysis
The R&R Consensus was aligned with ClustalW using gap
penalties of 10 to open and 5 to extend. The alignment
was then manually adjusted to ensure consistency with
pfam00379, particularly at the edges of the alignment,
and to ensure that alignments among sets of highly similar genes were not distorted by the global optimum. The
MEGA3 program [48] was used to calculate genetic distances using the JTT exchangeability matrix [49]. The distance measure is the expected fraction of accepted
mutations scaled such that a distance of 1.0 is equivalent
to 100 iterations of the JTT matrix. All distances were computed with pairwise deletion of indels.

All annotated An. gambiae CPR genes and all annotated
Ae. aegypti RR-2 genes listed in Cornman and Willis (MS
in preparation) were submitted to the MEME server
[50,51] with the extended R&R Consensus and signal peptide removed. We placed no restriction on the number of
motifs per sequence but limited the size to 5 – 25 amino
acids per motif. We investigated the stability of the
MEME-identified motifs by submitting haphazard subsamples of CPR genes from mosquito as well as other
insect CPR genes. This was to ensure that the same motif
definition was recovered when background sequence
probabilities were modulated in this way.
The model of nucleotide evolution for SLAC analysis was
chosen independently for each run using the DataMonkey
model-selection tool [37]. Selected codons were assessed

using a Bonferroni-corrected alpha of 0.05. Pairwise Ka/Ks
ratios were calculated using the method of Nei and Gojobori [52] as implemented by the program DnaSP [53].
The program codeml of the PAML package [38] was used
to assess the likelihood of sequential pairs of evolutionary
models described by Yang et al. [54]. For each pair of
models, the model with the fewest parameters was considered the null hypothesis and was rejected if the alternative
model had a significantly higher likelihood by the chisquared test suggested by Yang et al. [54].
