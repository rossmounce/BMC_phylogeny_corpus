Abstract
Recent technological advances have allowed us to study individual genomes at a base-pair resolution and have
demonstrated that the average exome harbors more than 15,000 genetic variants. However, our ability to
understand the biological significance of the identified variants and to connect these observed variants with
phenotypes is limited. The first step in this process is to identify genetic variation that is likely to result in changes
to protein structure and function, because detailed studies, either population based or functional, for each of the
identified variants are not practicable. Therefore algorithms that yield valid predictions of a variant’s functional
significance are needed. Over the past decade, several programs have been developed to predict the probability
that an observed sequence variant will have a deleterious effect on protein function. These algorithms range from
empirical programs that classify using known biochemical properties to statistical algorithms trained using a variety
of data sources, including sequence conservation data, biochemical properties, and functional data. Using data
from the pilot3 study of the 1000 Genomes Project available through Genetic Analysis Workshop 17, we compared
the results of four programs (SIFT, PolyPhen, MAPP, and VarioWatch) used to predict the functional relevance of
variants in 101 genes. Analysis was conducted without knowledge of the simulation model. Agreement between
programs was modest ranging from 59.4% to 71.4% and only 3.5% of variants were classified as deleterious and
10.9% as tolerated across all four programs.
Background
Identification of genetic variation that affects human
health has resulted in improvements in public health
through the development of better treatments, diagnostics, and preventive strategies. One major source of this
genetic variation is single-base changes in the DNA
sequence, some of which lead to alterations in protein
structure and function. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occur in the genome approximately
once every 1,200–1,500 base pairs and are nonrandomly
distributed [1]. Variants that occur in the protein coding
regions are further classified into synonymous and nonsynonymous variants. Synonymous SNPs are defined as
DNA changes without an associated change in the

amino acid sequence, and nonsynonymous SNPs are
defined as DNA changes that result in an amino acid
substitution or insertion of a stop codon. In one of the
first examples of complete sequence analysis of an individual genome, 10,569 nonsynonymous SNPs were
found, of which only 8,996 had been previously observed
[2]. This discovery of 1,573 novel nonsynonymous SNPs
demonstrates the magnitude of novel information that
can be gained from genome sequencing.
Although it may be difficult to know with certainty
the effect of a single amino acid change on protein function, some understanding can be gained through our
knowledge of protein biochemistry or gene sequence
itself. One sequence-based feature that can be examined
is whether or not the sequence variant results in a
codon change. If a nonsynonymous SNP results in a
stop codon, then the variant is likely to be deleterious,
unless this premature stop occurs near the end of a
gene. The effect of an amino acid substitution can range

from negligible to severe depending on the biochemical
properties of the substituted amino acid. In addition
to examining the amino acids found at the mutation
site, one can use phylogeny to determine conserved
sequences within a gene. Conserved sites are likely to
have arisen because genetic variation in these regions is
not tolerated across species as a result of strong negative
selective pressure against variation in these regions.
Thus variants that occur in nonconserved regions are
more likely to be tolerated.
In the past decade several programs have been developed with the goal of predicting whether or not an
observed sequence variant is likely to have a deleterious
effect on the protein product. These programs combine
data from a variety of sources and use differing computational algorithms to estimate the probability that an
observed genetic variant is deleterious. In this paper, we
compare the findings of four nucleotide- and amino
acid–based algorithms aimed at predicting the effect of
an observed nonsynonymous sequence variation. We
predict functional results for nonsynonymous SNPs
using the nucleotide version of SIFT, PolyPhen-2, VarioWatch, and MAPP. Based on the predictions made by
the various programs, we classify variants as deleterious
or tolerated and calculate the agreement between
programs.

Methods
The data set consists of variants observed in the individual sequences as part of phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes
Project, as released for Genetic Analysis Workshop 17
(GAW17). We selected 101 autosomal genes and analyzed only those nonsynonymous SNPs that caused a
missense mutation in the subsequent amino acid. Overall, 3,781 nonsynonymous SNPs were identified within
these genes. We identified amino acid changes using the
ANNOVAR program [3] by mapping the genomic coordinates of each variant to the RefSeq gene database
(build hg18/36.3). The result was an average of 37.4
nonsynonymous variants (standard deviation: 23.4
variants) per gene. There were 1,867 (49.4%) private
variants (one copy present, minor allele frequency
[MAF] < 0.001), 1,310 (34.6%) very rare variants (0.001
< MAF < 0.01), 371(9.8%) rare variants (0.01 < MAF <
0.05), and 233 (6.2%) common variants (MAF > 0.05).
The functional analysis programs we examined (SIFT,
PolyPhen-2, MAPP, and VarioWatch) fall into two categories: nucleotide-based and amino acid–based. Some
programs provide probabilities, whereas others classify
their predictions into levels of functional threats. To
carry out this analysis, we dichotomize predictions as
either tolerated or deleterious. We also give an overview
of each program.

To compare our results to a gold standard, we examined the entire GAW17 data set to identify variants that
had been previously analyzed in experimental models
providing true functional results. Because the simulated
GAW17 data do not represent true biological function,
the simulated data could not be used as a gold standard.
We identified functional variants by searching for information by gene name for each amino acid change in the
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database
[4] along with the term “functional” using an R program. We were able to identify 19 functional variants
using this method, 13 of which were verified as tested in
mouse or cell line models. We identified an additional
two variants (in BRCA2 and MFTRR) by searching the
literature.
Programs

By querying data from five databases (Ensembl, UCSC
BLAT, Rescue-ESE, Fas-ESS, and SIFT), VarioWatch
provides functional annotation for SNPs. We used the
following criteria, as implemented in the program: (1)
whether or not the mutation affects the protein structure, (2) whether the SNP is in an exon-splicing enhancer or silencer, and (3) whether or not the SNPs abolish
the protein domain [5]. Once VarioWatch is provided
with information on variant location, it returns predictions in terms of high, medium, and low levels of threat
using the three criteria. In our analyses we classified
VarioWatch’s very high and high-level threats as deleterious and its low- and medium-level threats as tolerated.
Multivariate Analysis of Protein Polymorphism
(MAPP) is a phylogeny-based Java-script program that
estimates the average deviation from six physiochemical
properties (hydropathy, polarity, charge, volume, free
energy in alpha-helix conformation, and free energy in
beta-strand conformation) at an amino acid position
across species to assess the effect of a substitution at a
particular amino acid site [6]. Provided with a set of
pre-aligned orthologous protein sequences and a tree
relating the sequences, MAPP can be used to estimate
the effect of a newly detected polymorphism on protein
function. We obtained homologous sequences for the
same 10 species from the UCSC database for each gene
(rhesus, mouse, dog, elephant, opossum, platypus,
chicken, stickleback, lizard, Xenopus tropicalis). For this
analysis, the severe and moderate levels were classified
as deleterious, and the minor level was classified as
tolerated.
The Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) program
is a tool based on sequence homology and physiochemical properties that detects variation from the alignment
and gives a probability score of the mutation being deleterious as a measure of a substitution affecting the

protein function [7,8]. A semiautomated approach
allows the user to input homologous sequences or alignments to improve accuracy. Input includes the reference
and variant nucleotide and their chromosomal position.
SIFT provides binary classification of variants as either
tolerated or deleterious.
The PolyPhen-2 program predicts the effect of a variant using eight sequence-based and three structurebased features previously selected by an iterative greedy
algorithm [9,10]. Sequence-based features include
whether the variant is in an active or binding site and
whether other functionally important regions or motifs
are present. Sequences are pulled from Uniprot. Structural components include whether or not the variant
alters the polarity of the structure, potentially changing
the hydrophobic core of a protein, and whether its interactions are with itself or with other proteins. The functional prediction is determined by a naïve Bayes
classifier into deleterious and nondeleterious groups.
Input is amino acid changes with the reference and variant amino acid and their position in the protein
sequence. The output levels of possibly damaging and
probably damaging were classified as deleterious for this
analysis, with the benign level being classified as
tolerated.

Results
We obtained moderate levels of agreement for the four
programs, with agreement ranging from 59% to 71%
(Table 1). The highest agreement was observed between
MAPP and PolyPhen-2: 71%. The lowest agreement,
59%, was observed between VarioWatch and MAPP.
We also saw trends in the leniency of the predictions
across the 101 genes, with some programs categorizing
fewer variants as deleterious compared to others. To
further examine the correlation between programs, we
calculated the proportion of variants classified as deleterious per program. In addition, we examined the conditional probability that a variant classified as deleterious
by a given program would also be classified as deleterious
in a second program. For example, in Table 2, MAPP
classified 1,472 of the 3,199 variants for which predictions

For the off-diagonal values, this table looks at pairwise agreements between
the four prediction programs in predicting whether a variant is tolerated or
deleterious. For example, 64.6% of the time, MAPP and SIFT agreed on their
prediction, whereas VarioWatch and SIFT only agreed 62.9% of the time. The
highest agreement is between MAPP and PolyPhen-2, and the lowest
agreement is between MAPP and VarioWatch.

were available as deleterious. Of these 1,472, 65.4% were
also classified as deleterious by VarioWatch [i.e., Prob
(deleterious in VarioWatch | deleterious in MAPP)]. Conversely, of the 1,882 variants that were classified as deleterious in VarioWatch (n = 1,882), only 54.6% were also
classified as deleterious by MAPP. Overall, 135 (3.57%)
variants were called deleterious by all programs, whereas
only 414 (10.9%) were classified as tolerant by all four
programs. Of the 3,781 variants examined, 876 were classified as deleterious by three or more programs, and
1,274 were classified as tolerated by three or four programs. This suggests that these programs are more likely
to agree on benign variants than on potentially damaging
variants.
We next compared the predictions obtained from
these four programs to the results of the functional studies conducted on the 15 genetic variants for which
functional data were available. Of these 15 variants, 13
had been demonstrated to result in a loss of function.
However, only 6 of these 13 loss-of-function mutations
were predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein
function by all four programs (Table 3). Interestingly,
even within these known functional variants, no variant
was predicted as benign or tolerated by all four programs. Of the four programs, PolyPhen-2 had the greatest accuracy, predicting the function of 11 of the 15
variants correctly. VarioWatch and SIFT predicted 10
out of 15 correctly, and MAPP predicted 9 out of 15
correctly.

Discussion
Although the four prediction programs did have some
pairwise agreement in identifying deleterious mutations,
only 3.5% of variants were classified as deleterious
and 10.9% as tolerated across all four programs. The
observed differences may be due to different classification cutoff points on the probability of being deleterious
but are most likely due to the different methods used to
classify variants.
Although functional data are not available for most of
the variants examined, they were available for a small
number of variants. However, even for variants with functional data, the programs did not provide consistent
results. We highlight two examples from Table 3. Kuznetsov et al. [11] used a functional assay to determine
that the N991D variant of the BRCA2 gene was a neutral
mutation. A missense variant, N991D was introduced
into the cells using Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
BACs, and the mutant cells were subjected to various
DNA-damaging agents and then compared to control
cells. Kuznetsov et al. [11] found that N991D showed no
difference in its sensitivity to these agents compared with
control cells, whereas cells deficient in the BRCA2 protein were highly sensitive to these DNA-damaging agents.

Each program characterizes a different number of deleterious alleles. The pairwise prediction is calculated by conditioning on the probability of a program
predicting a variant as deleterious, given that the comparison program already has predicted it as deleterious. For example, in the first row, among those 1,472
variants that MAPP classifies as deleterious, only 58% are also classified as deleterious by SIFT.

mothers was analyzed for the presence of this mutation.
Two copies of the mutation in mothers resulted in 5
times the risk of their child having a neural tube defect
compared to mothers lacking two copies of this mutation.
This mutation was predicted to have a deleterious effect
in all the programs (Table 3).
Although all four programs had the same relative success in predicting the functional status of the 15 variants
for which functional data were available, only about twothirds of variants were correctly classified. The small
sample size of variants would have been more informative if any of the programs had been a distinct outlier,
but this was not the case. A more comprehensive look at
functional variants using additional exome sequencing
data is warranted, as several hundred variants may better
discriminate the predictive ability of the programs.
There were some limitations in this study, including a
lack of reference sequence. Therefore we used Build 36
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) to determine the location of each variant.

Thus the N991D mutation was classified as a neutral
mutation. However, MAPP and VarioWatch predicted
the mutation to be damaging, whereas SIFT and PolyPhen-2 tolerated the mutation. This may reflect the different methods, because MAPP relies primarily on
sequence-based features, such as phylogeny and what the
amino acid change is in regards to the surrounding
sequence. On the other hand, both SIFT and PolyPhen-2
rely heavily on structural features, such as how the variant affects the protein’s tertiary structure and its interactions with ligands. Wilson et al. [12] examined the role of
a common mutation at rs1801394 in the gene for
methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) and its association with an increased risk for spina bifida. Fibroblast
lines were isolated from patients with homocystinuria to
isolate and identify mutations in the MTRR gene using
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Wilson and colleagues found that rs1801394 has the substitution I22M, or I49M, depending on the isomer. A

However, this assumption resulted in several instances
in which the variant provided was identical to the reference allele according to the dbSNP database, showing
inconsistencies between the reference sequence for this
data set and the substitute reference sequence used
from the UCSC Genome Browser. To determine the
amino acid changes, we used coordinates of the nucleotide variant that were taken from the GAW17 data, and
the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were taken
from the CCDS sequence. We also likely missed functional variants, given the search terms in OMIM used to
identify functional variants.

Conclusions
The four programs compared in this analysis (SIFT,
MAPP, PolyPhen-2, and VarioWatch) differ greatly in
their predictions of the probability that a SNP variant
will be functionally deleterious. When selecting variants
for experimental or functional follow-up study, a conservative approach, such as SIFT, should be used to minimize false positives. However, if the program is being
used to select variants for further statistical analysis, a
less conservative approach, such as PolyPhen-2, may be
preferred to capture all possible deleterious variants. It
is important to note that these programs have different
methods and discordant results, so we do not recommend using any program as a true substitute for functional assays.
