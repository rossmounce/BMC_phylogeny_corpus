Bioregion heterogeneity correlates with extensive
mitochondrial DNA diversity in the Namaqua rock
mouse, Micaelamys namaquensis (Rodentia:
Muridae) from southern Africa - evidence for a
species complex

Abstract
Background: Intraspecific variation within the diverse southern African murine rodents has not been extensively
investigated, yet cryptic diversity is evident in several taxa studied to date. The Namaqua rock mouse, Micaelamys
namaquensis Smith, 1834 is a widespread endemic murine rodent from the subregion. Currently, a single species
with four subspecies is recognised, but in the past up to 16 subspecies were described. Thus, this species is a
good candidate for the investigation of patterns and processes of diversification in a diverse but under-studied
mammalian subfamily and geographic region. Here, we report genetic differentiation based on mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences among samples collected over an extensive coverage of the species’
range.
Results: Cytochrome b sequences of 360 widely sampled individuals identified 137 unique maternal alleles. Gene
tree and phylogeographic analyses of these alleles suggest the presence of at least eight lineages or haplogroups
(A-H), with varying degrees of intra-lineage diversity. This differentiation is in contrast with the most recent
taxonomic treatment based on cranial morphometrics which only recognised four subspecies. The mtDNA diversity
strongly supports earlier views that this taxon may represent a species complex. We further show statistical support
for the association of several of these lineages with particular vegetation biomes of southern Africa. The time to
the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) dates to the Pliocene (~5 Mya) whereas coalescent-based divergence
time estimates between lineages vary between 813 Kya [0.22 - 1.36] and 4.06 Mya [1.21 - 4.47]. The major
diversification within lineages occurred during the Pleistocene. The identification of several regions of sympatry of
distinct lineages offers future opportunities for the elucidation of the underlying speciation processes in the
suggested species complex.
Conclusions: Similar to other African murine rodents, M. namaquensis radiated during the Pliocene and
Pleistocene coinciding with major periods of aridification and the expansion of savanna habitats. The suggested
species complex is represented by at least eight lineages of which the majority are confined to only one or a few
neighbouring biomes/bioregions. Contrasting intra-lineage phylogeographic patterns suggest differences in
adaptation and responses to Plio-Pleistocene climatic and vegetation changes. The role of ecological factors in
driving speciation in the group needs further investigation.

Background
Globally the order Rodentia represents the richest mammalian diversity [1], yet species and higher level classification within the order remains to be resolved due
to controversies surrounding morphological character
evolution in the group [2-5]. The Old World subfamily
Murinae is the most diverse within the species-rich
family Muridae [3]. Africa is one of the centres of endemism of the subfamily and based on combined mitochondrial and nuclear gene data, it has been suggested
that the major African radiation occurred in the Miocene
(7 - 9 Mya) [3]. The latter and other recent studies [6,7]
of African murids highlighted the impact of Miocene and
Pliocene climatic changes on vegetation and landscape
composition (see also [8]) and linked the rapid radiation
within several taxa to the expansion of savanna habitats.
Murid diversity within the southern African subregion
remains underestimated as few local taxa have been
assessed for intraspecific variation. Most of the earlier
studies were based on traditional morphometrics and/or
qualitative morphology, e.g. studies on species within the
genera Acomys [9], Saccostomus [10], Mastomys [11],
Aethomys [12-15] and Micaelamys (formerly designated
as Aethomys [2]). Recently molecular studies investigated
Otomys [16], Mastomys [17,18], Micaelamys [19], Rhabdomys [20] and Saccostomus [21]. These molecular studies
suggest high levels of cryptic diversity, a feature also
reported for other African murids (cf [6,7]).
In general, small mammals such as rodents have
restricted dispersal abilities [22-24] and many display patchy
distributions. Smaller rodents in particular show adaptation
to specific micro-habitats and would likely be more sensitive to environmental changes [24,25]. Indeed, habitat selection, dispersion and inter-specific competition are proposed
to be amongst the most important factors influencing the
co-existence of species [23,26]. In addition, karyotypic
changes have been implicated in the speciation of several
rodent species (e.g., Otomys [27] and Rhabdomys [20]).
The focus of the present study is the Namaqua rock
mouse, Micaelamys namaquensis Smith, 1834, originally
described from Witwater, Little Namaqualand in the
Northern Cape Province of South Africa [28]. The genus
Aethomys Thomas, 1915 was formerly subdivided into two
African endemic subgenera namely Micaelamys and Aethomys [2]. Recent molecular studies [19,29,30] reported the
paraphyly of the genus and the two subgenera have since
been elevated to full generic rank [2]. The genus Micaelamys Ellerman, 1941 includes M. namaquensis and M.
granti Wroughton, 1908, while Aethomys includes the
remaining nine species. The close relationship between M.
namaquensis and M. granti is evident from dental morphology [31], karyology [32], gross sperm and bacular
morphology [32] and cranial phenetic analysis [33].

Fossil species of Aethomys have been recorded from
Langebaanweg (Western Cape Province, South Africa)
[34]. It is noteworthy that the smaller of the two fossil
species closely resembles the extant M. namaquensis,
which may be indicative of the long-term presence of this
species in the subregion [34]. The oldest known representatives of the genus, A. adamanticola and A. modernis, have been recorded in South Africa and date to
between the Early Pleistocene and Late Miocene [35,36].
Micaelamys namaquensis is widely distributed in
southern African (south of the Zambezi/Cunene Rivers),
but has also been recorded to the north of the subregion
in Angola, Zambia, Malawi and northern Mozambique
[2]. These rodents are catholic in their habitat requirements but where there are rocky outcrops or hillsides
they will use these in preference to any other type of
habitat [2]. The social structure of the species has not
been elucidated but colonies appear to live in rock crevices, in or under fallen logs or in holes in trees [2].
They are mostly granivores [2] and breed during the
warmer spring and summer months [37]. They are
known for unstable population cycles associated with
high mortality and high reproductive potential [38].
Such cycles would likely leave clear ‘footprints’ in the
distribution of genetic diversity in the species.
The Namaqua rock mouse shows considerable geographic variation such as in pelage colouration, tail length
and body size throughout its distributional range
[2,37,39,40]. This variation suggested that M. namaquensis may reflect either a complex of species [40] or subspecies [37,39]. Earlier reports [41,42] recognised 16
subspecies within M. namaquensis (Figure 1). However,
these distinctions were primarily based on a limited number of geographically restricted samples [37,43], with little or no assessment of patterns of geographic variation
over the entire distributional range of the species.
A comprehensive intraspecific morphometric study
within M. namaquensis from southern Africa [15] suggested the recognition of four subspecies differing in
both cranial size and shape: M. n. namaquensis Smith,
1834, M. n. lehocla Smith, 1836, M. n. alborarius Peters,
1852 and M. n. monticularis Jameson, 1909. This study
also suggested that the geographical limits of the proposed subspecies broadly coincide with the major phytogeographical zones of southern Africa [44,45] (Figure 1):
the subspecies namaquensis was shown to be largely
associated with a combination of the Succulent Karoo,
Fynbos and the southern coastal Savanna/Grassland
region of the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and eastern
Mpumalanga Provinces of South Africa, while the subspecies alborarius and lehocla were shown to be associated with the Savanna and Upper/Lower Karoo
biomes, respectively [15]. The subspecies monticularis

was largely confined to the Grassland biome of southern
Africa [15] (see inset in Figure 1).
Given its wide distribution and past indications of
cryptic diversity, we investigated the cyt b variation of
M. namaquensis as a potential model for murine diversification in southern Africa. Our objectives are: 1) to
evaluate the phylogeographic structure in this widespread species; 2) to compare patterns of genetic variation with previously described morphological variation;
3) to evaluate the geographical association between the
observed diversity and environmental features of the
region and 4) to consider the divergence times in terms
of the climatic and vegetation changes characterising
southern Africa over the recent evolutionary past.

Results
The 5’ end of the cyt b gene (631 bp) was sequenced for
360 M. namaquensis individuals. All sequences obtained
were of the mtDNA cyt b gene with conserved domains
and nucleotide composition biases typical of this

mtDNA protein coding gene [46-48]. As expected, most
of the substitutions were silent, with only 36 of the 210
amino acid sites being variable. The 176 variable nucleotide positions defined 137 maternal alleles (Additional
file 1), the allele frequencies and geographic distributions are indicated in Additional file 2. Sequence divergence values based on uncorrected p-distances ranged
from 0.16% to 7.74% between the alleles. Only four
widespread and high frequency alleles were recorded
(NH014, NH100, NH113 and NH115), while most of
the remaining alleles were locality-specific (107 alleles).
The overall nucleotide diversity was 3%, while the allelic
diversity value of 0.91 corresponded to those reported
for other rodents [49].
Unique lineages were defined based on the joint interpretation of a Bayesian gene tree (Figure 2), an ultrametric analysis in BEAST (Figure 3) and an allele
network as estimated in TCS (Figure 4) (see Additional
file 3 for a summary of the comparison). We thus propose the presence of eight lineages (A-H) with varying

degrees of intra-lineage diversity. We do not present
individual lineage phylogeographic patterns in detail but
indicate some of the subdivisions (e.g. in lineages A and
B) and use lineages A2 and D to illustrate heterogeneous and homogeneous diversity patterns, respectively.
The Bayesian phylogram (Figure 2) is characterised by
short internal branches suggesting a rapid radiation of
lineages. This is supported by the relatively short timeframe over which these lineages became established during the Early Pleistocene and Late Pliocene (2.3 - 4.06
Mya) (Figure 3). Two major periods of subsequent
radiation within the lineages is evident at approximately
1.4 - 1.7 Mya (diversification within lineages A, B, C
and H) and from 176 Kya to 1 Mya (lineages D - G).
With the exception of lineage H, the monophyly of
the respective lineages are statistically supported by the
Bayesian posterior probability values (Figure 2). Sister

relationships are not consistent across the phylogenetic
analyses and statistical support is largely lacking (see
Figures 2 and 3 and Additional file 3). However, lineages
A and B and lineages C, D and E are potential sister
clades. In addition, these two clades appear to share a
common history. The BEAST analysis further suggest a
sister relationship between G and H; these two distinctive lineages are consistently placed sister to the remainder of the lineages. The position of lineage F is
inconsistent between the different analyses.
The TCS analysis connected alleles separated by up to
10 mutational steps (95% confidence limit); only lineage
H and a subset of the lineage B alleles (B3) could not be
joined to the remainder of the network (Figure 4). Lineage D shows a star-like pattern of 31 closely related
alleles recorded over a large geographic area. Seven of
the alleles were shared between two to six localities;

DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (cyt b) alleles within Micaelamys namaquensis from southern Africa. Sizes of the circles and squares
represent allele frequencies; each connecting line represents a mutational step and solid black circles indicate un-sampled/extinct alleles (TCS
analysis only connected alleles at the 95% confidence limit, i.e., 10 steps). Squares represent potential ancestral haplotypes as identified by the
TCS analysis. Thick black lines and thinner black lines indicate connections between groups and within groups, respectively.

these included both ancestral and derived alleles, indicative of retention of ancestral polymorphisms as well as
more recent expansions of this lineage. In contrast,
most of the other lineages harboured more divergent
alleles, as evident by the presence of intervening, extinct
or un-sampled alleles. For example, lineage A2 was
characterised by six alleles that were shared between
localities while the remaining alleles were locality specific. Some of these shared alleles were more derived but
some (NH45, NH46, NH51) were still ancestral. The
nucleotide and haplotype diversity estimates within the
lineages are shown in Table 1. Lineages A5 and F

showed the highest within lineage sequence divergences
(0.35% and 0.65%, respectively).
Most lineages form separate geographical units displaying an allopatric/parapatric pattern of distribution
(Figure 5). Major physical features of the southern
African landscape (rivers and mountains) do not appear
to separate the lineages (see inset Figure 5 for the general topography). One exception is the enigmatic lineage
F that appears to be restricted to high elevations of the
Great Escarpment. However, most lineages and in some
instances also the sub-clades within them, appear to be
associated with different vegetation types of southern

Names in parenthesis (for example Nama-Karoo/
Savanna) refer to biomes as indicated in Figure 1. For
bioregion names not referred to in Figure 1 and for
more detailed maps see [45].
In addition to the distributions above, lineages D and
E were also sampled from geographically distant localities (locality 8 for lineage D and localities 90, 91 for
lineage E). Lineage A5 also has a disjunct distribution
including individuals from Fouriesburg (Free State Province, South Africa) and Kasane (Botswana) which are
approximately 1 000 km apart. Lineages A1 and B1
were only recorded from single localities, Koppies Dam
Nature Reserve (Free State Province, South Africa) and
Volksrust (Mpumalanga Province, South Africa), respectively (Figure 5). Several of the lineages were found in
sympatry (Figure 5), for example, lineages A2, C and D
were recorded with several other lineages.
There is good support for the association between
lineages and the major biomes of southern Africa

(see Figure 1) as shown by the ML phylogram (Figure
6). Bootstrap values are indicated and different colours
correspond to different biomes (see figure legend for
details). Alleles within most lineages are associated with
single biomes (e.g. haplotypes NH001 - NH012 of lineage H with Savanna; haplotypes NH073 - NH083 of B3
with Fynbos) or two neighbouring biomes (e.g. all alleles
within lineage A). Although its core association is with
the Nama-Karoo biome, lineage D is geographically the
most widespread (see Figure 5) across several neighbouring biomes.
Figure 5 further allows a comparison between the geographic distribution of previously recognised subspecies
and the distribution of mtDNA cyt b diversity. Four of
the mtDNA lineages (lineages A2, B3, D and H) broadly
correspond with the biome-related distributional patterns of the subspecies monticularis, namaquensis, lehocla and alborarius, respectively proposed by [15] (see
also inset in Figure 1). However, there seems to be a
better correspondence to the formally described subspecies [41,42] (see Figure 1).
A Mantel nonparametric test for lineages identified in
the phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses (see
Additional file 4 for variation) revealed isolation by distance for four of the clades (p-values indicated in bold,
see Additional file 4). In most instances, the standard
normal variate ( g) was smaller than the critical value of

(no association between elements in the two matrices)
could not be rejected. Mantel tests could not be performed for lineages represented by too few individuals.

Discussion
The analysis of the mtDNA cyt b gene in the present
study supports previous suggestions that M. namaquensis from southern Africa is polytypic [15,19,41,42]. The
present analysis, however, reveals a much higher degree
of variation, comparable with other small mammalian
taxa [6,50-52]. This is in contrast to a morphometric
study that proposed the recognition of only four subspecies within M. namaquensis [15]. The detection of partial overlap between intra-lineage and inter-lineage
divergences suggests the need for combined analyses
with nuclear genes and more detailed morphological/
behavioural data to fully resolve species-level diversity

and the biogeographic history of this group of murid
rodents that may represent a species complex.
Levels of variation seen here are comparable to those of
other within-population or within-species comparisons in
muroid rodents. For example, sequence divergence
within Andean mice of the genus Akodon ranged
between 7.3 and 11.7% [53]. There is currently no consensus as to the sequence divergence level associated
with particular taxonomic ranks [54]. While [55] suggested that values of 4% reflect inter-specific differences
in rodents, [56] advocated values higher than 11% at this
level. [57] cautioned against the use of sequence divergence levels in assigning specific status. Possible problems may also arise from interpreting evolutionary
history entirely on the basis of one gene. However, it is
significant that some of the lineages identified in the present study have previously been proposed as subspecies
on classical morphological/morphometric grounds [15].

Consideration of M. namaquensis diversity within a
biological species concept (BSC) framework would
require accurate delineation of the distributional boundaries of the identified lineages and mapping of areas of
overlap through further sampling and genetic analyses.
In areas of either sympatry (e.g. localities 4, 8, 9, 11, 12,
13, 16, 50, 67, 79, 89 and 93) or parapatry (e.g. localities
5 - 7 and 29 - 31), the presence or absence of hybrids
(identified with diagnostic nuclear or cytogenetic characters) could be used to test the breeding integrity of these
groups. Breeding isolation has for example, been shown
between A. chrysophilus and A. ineptus using karyology
and sperm and bacular morphology [32,58-60].
The remarkable karyotypic diversity found in small
mammals suggests that speciation may be associated
with karyotypic changes [61]. This is certainly true for
some rodents that include variation in diploid numbers
[32,60,62,63]. Other examples include southern African
rodent species within the genera Mastomys, Saccostomus
and Otomys where morphologically similar but genetically distinct species complexes have been identified
using karyotypes and/or protein electromorph mobility
[60,61]. A single diploid number (2n = 24) has thus far
been reported in M. namaquensis [32] however, karyotypic variation, in addition to locally adaptive physiological
and/or behavioural responses [64-67] may have played a
significant role in speciation.
Three major periods of diversification were identified
in the present study: 2.03 - 4.06 Mya (the origin of
lineages A - H), 1.25 - 1.7 Mya (deeper divergences
within lineages A, B, C and H), and 176 Kya to 1 Mya
(radiation within the rest of the lineages). The most significant time for M. namaquensis diversification therefore corresponds to the Pleistocene and Pliocene, a
period characterised by major climatic and vegetation
changes with direct and indirect impacts on animal
populations [8,64].
The Early Pleistocene and Pliocene were characterised
by uplifts which raised the interior plateaus of South
Africa more than 1 800 m above the Miocene level [65].
Between 5 and 6.5 Mya, a severe temperature drop (the
Terminal Miocene Event) resulted in a rapid and dramatic sea level drop of over 100 m worldwide. The temperature during the subsequent period appeared to have
fluctuated until between 2.5 - 2.6 Mya. Since then, temperatures have oscillated between glacial and interglacial
conditions at least 17 times during the last 1.7 million
years with individual cycles having a mean duration of
about 100 000 years [66].
These temperature changes had a definite impact on
vegetation and may have contributed to speciation in
southern African mammals [8,67]. The three major periods of diversification of M. namaquensis lineages correspond to periods of aridification (2.4 - 2.9 Mya; 1.6 - 1.8

Page 10 of 16

Mya and 0.8 - 1.2 Mya) that also affected the southern
African environment [8]. These arid periods alternated
with wetter conditions so that populations were shifting
continuously [67]. These cycles could have resulted in
speciation, either through physical isolation (allopatric
speciation) or changes in habitat (sympatric or ecological speciation).
The diversification within the M. namaquensis species
complex also coincides with the timeframe proposed for
the rapid radiation within the African Murinae [3]. Current fossil evidence also suggests that representatives of
the genera Aethomys (A. modernis, A. lavocati, A.
deheinzelini) and Micaelamys (A. adamanticola) were
present in southern Africa since the Late Miocene and
one of these fossils closely resembles the extant M.
namaquensis [34-36]. The expansion and contraction of
savanna habitats across especially the eastern and southern parts of Africa during the Pliocene and Miocene
have been linked to speciation in several other rodent
genera, for example Tatera [68], Hylomyscus [7] and
Praomys [25]. Based on the timing and pattern of diversification in M. namaquensis and these other broadly
co-distributed rodents, we propose that vicariance, dispersal and local adaptation shaped the diverse rodent
fauna of the continent and likely also the southern African subregion.
The chronology (Figure 3) and habitat association
(Figure 6) presented here suggest that the initial radiation within M. namaquensis was in open habitats
(Savanna and Grassland biomes) in the northern parts
of southern Africa and that one of these ancestral
lineages persisted in the drier savanna regions (giving
rise to lineages G and H). The sister lineage diverged
into several arid-adapted lineages mostly centred on the
Savanna and Nama-Karoo biomes (lineages C, D and E)
while the remaining lineages adapted to more mesic
habitats (interior savanna/grassland, fynbos and coastal
habitats; lineages A and B). The origin and affinities of
lineage F, recorded from mesic grasslands of the Great
Escarpment, remain unresolved.
The extant distributions of some of the lineages
remain puzzling. For example, the presence of lineage E
at Bergville, KwaZulu-Natal Province (locality 90; Figure
5, Additional file 2, 5 and 6) and Dwesa Nature Reserve,
Eastern Cape Province (locality 91; Figure 5, Additional
file 2, 5 and 6) may be a result of recent Kalahari sand
flows from north to south [69,70]. Pleistocene sand
deposits have been recorded from the Eastern Cape Province above the Great Escarpment at an altitude of 1
800 m (north of Queenstown, Eastern Cape Province:
31°23"S; 26°41"E) [71]. Other sand sheets have been
reported from the western Free State, Gauteng and
Northern Cape Provinces [72]. As a species’ habitat
expands or shifts, so does the distributional range of

Russo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:307
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/307

that species [69]. This may also be the case with the
occurrence of lineage D at Kasane (locality 8; Figure 5,
Additional file 2, 5 and 6) in Botswana. Some studies
[73,74] have suggested incomplete mtDNA lineage sorting and the retention of ancestral polymorphisms as
possible explanations.
Habitat changes likely also played a key role in shaping the phylogeographic structuring within lineages.
Radiation within lineages did not occur at the same
time and it is clear from Figures 3 and 4 that different
processes have contributed to the levels of diversity
within lineages. As has been reported for other African
mammals [64] different refugia may have existed in
unfavourable climatic conditions and acted as sources
for subsequent range expansions. The typical population
cycles within M. namaquensis [38] and meta-population
dynamics would further have contributed to episodes of
extinction and recolonisation.
Lineage A serves as an example of one of the
lineages with deep phylogeographic subdivision dating
to the mid-Pleistocene (~1.51 Mya). The population
history within lineage A2 has been more complex,
potentially due to waves of colonisation or dispersal
among regions associated with the expansion of grassland and savanna habitats. It is possible that large
population sizes of lineage A2 are responsible for
maintaining both the high nucleotide diversity (1.44%;
Table 1) and the divergent alleles. Six alleles were
shared between localities and the presence of several
unique alleles within localities may reflect evolutionarily old populations, which may have served as core
regions for colonisation.
It has been proposed that Grassland expanded during
the glacial periods due to a colder climate that allowed
for the formation of frost [75,66]. If the association
between Grassland and winter frost, together with the
added effects of fire is significant, it is plausible to suggest that when the area of winter cold expanded periodically in the past, it may have caused an expansion of
grassland at the expense of other vegetation types.
There is evidence from Aliwal North (Eastern Cape Province) and Florisbad (Free State Province) that during
the last glacial maximum (LGM), grassland replaced
other vegetation types [76,77]. The genus Lepus is a
recent arrival in southern Africa associated with the
expansion of grassland over the past million years. Subsequent habitat changes have for example, generated
distinct scrub hare, L. saxatilis phylogroups in the central and northern regions of South Africa [78]. It would
be instructive to compare the observed pattern of M.
namaquensis in the grassland to other co-distributed
small mammal species, as congruence in phylogeographic patterns between independent lineages would
reflect similar vicariant events [79].

Page 11 of 16

At the other extreme, a star-like pattern of closely
related alleles is evident in lineage D, despite large geographic distances between localities (Figure 5). Rare
alleles are more likely to be mutational derivations of
the common alleles [80]. Therefore, the presence of the
closely related alleles within almost all localities within
lineage D reflects a common female ancestry, probably
due to recent range expansion from a source population
(s). In essence, lineage D exhibits limited phylogeographic structure with a relatively low nucleotide diversity (0.37%; Table 1). Similar patterns of low genetic
structuring have been recorded for other small mammals [81-84]. Therefore, different evolutionary processes
have been involved shapping genetic diversity within the
different lineages.

Conclusion
Micaelamys namaquensis displays considerable mtDNA
diversity in contrast with the current taxonomic view
based on morphology/morphometrics. Taken together
with previously reported geographic variation in fur colour, tail length and body size we believe that the taxon
represents a species complex in southern Africa. Given
the strong geographic association of most of the eight
identified lineages with specific biomes or bioregions
our future research will explore processes underlying
ecological speciation in the group.
Methods
Samples (n = 360) representative of the four previously
proposed morphometrically-defined subspecies [15],
from 95 localities spanning the four major phytogeographical zones in southern Africa, were collected from
South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland and Botswana (see
Additional files 2, 5 and 6). Only areas near type localities of six of the originally described subspecies (waterbergensis, calarius, siccatus, auricornis, alborarius and
avarillus; Figure 1) from northern Namibia, western
Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, were not
sampled (Additional file 6). Animals were live-trapped
using Sherman traps (H.B. Sherman Traps Inc. Florida,
U.S.A.) and handled under the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM; http://www.mammalogy.org/committees/index.asp; Animal Care and Use
Committee, 1998) as approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the University of Pretoria (Project number: EC 010417-004). Collection permit numbers are
given in Additional file 7. Some animals were sacrificed
by halothane inhalation, and ear clips from the rest
were either frozen at - 20°C, stored in 70% EtOH, or in
Tissue/Blood Storage Buffer (100 mM Tris, 40 mM
EDTA, 1 M NaCl and 0.5% SDS). Voucher specimens
were prepared using standard natural history museum
procedures for small mammals and were deposited in

Russo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:307
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/307

the mammal reference collection of the Transvaal
Museum (TM) of the Northern Flagship Institution
(NFI), Pretoria, South Africa.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from tissue using
either a standard phenol/chloroform protocol [85] or a
Sigma GenElute™ Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep
Kit (Sigma Aldrich). Some problem samples were
extracted using a Genomic DNA Mini Kit I Multi (Animal/Plant) (Koma Biotech Inc.).
A mouse-specific primer (H15309) was designed in the
tRNA-Thr from a Mus musculus sequence [GenBank:
J01420; [86]]. This primer is a M. musculus version of
H15915 [47] and was used in combination with the shortened universal vertebrate primer L14724 [87] that
anneals in tRNA-Glu, to amplify the cyt b gene of two
M. namaquensis individuals. An A. chrysophilus sequence
[GenBank: AF004587; [50]], together with these
M. namaquensis sequences were aligned in Clustal X
[88] for designing an internal species-specific M. namaquensis primer (H14769, 5’ GTCTGCGTCTGAATTTAG
3’). H14769 was used in combination with the shortened
L14724, or L14841 of [89], to amplify the 5’ end of the
cyt b gene for all individuals in our study. A preliminary
analysis showed that the 5’ end of the cyt b gene yielded
considerable levels of variation within M. namaquensis
and a 631 bp region was used in subsequent analyses.
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) [90] were performed
in a total volume of either 50 μl or 25 μl. Reactions contained approximately 50 - 100 ng genomic DNA template,
1 × buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each of the four
nucleotides (Promega), 2.5 - 5 pmol of each primer and
0.15 U of Super-Therm® DNA polymerase (Southern
Cross Biotechnology). PCR conditions were as follows:
denaturing at 94°C for 5 minutes, 35 cycles of the following: 94°C for 30 seconds, primer annealing at 52°C for
30 seconds and elongation at 72°C for 45 seconds. This
was followed by an extended elongation step for 7 minutes
at 72°C in a Geneamp® PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were purified using the High
Pure™ PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics).
Dye-terminator cycle sequencing was performed for both
the light and heavy strands using the ABI PRISM Big Dye™
Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
Kit (Applied Biosystems). Cycle sequencing products were
subsequently precipitated using a NaAc salt method
(Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI 3130 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems).
The quality of the raw sequence data was evaluated in
Sequencing Analysis, version 3 (Applied Biosystems) or
BioEdit, version 7.0.9.0 (Ibis Biosciences), and a consensus sequence for each individual from forward and
reverse sequences was determined in Sequence Navigator,
version 1.01 (Applied Biosystems) or Vector NTI

Page 12 of 16

Advance 10 (Invitrogen). All sequences were deposited
[GenBank: GQ471959 to GQ472095]. These accessions
represent all unique haplotypes identified in the present
study, including geographical information. Consensus
sequences of all individuals were aligned in Clustal X [88].
We used the results of all phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses to define unique lineages (see also
[91]). Only lineages/haplogroups with support in at least
two of the three analyses were considered as separate
lineages while other subdivisions were treated as variation within these lineages. Further research will test the
taxonomic status of these suggested lineages.
Genetic diversity was estimated for the different
lineages/haplogroups as identified in the phylogenetic
analyses and network. Diversity indices such as haplotype diversity [92] and nucleotide diversity, π [93] were
calculated for the whole sample and individual lineages/
haplogroups excluding missing data using DnaSP,
version 4.10.9 [94].
All phylogenetic and dating analyses were based on
the 137 identified alleles representative of the overall
diversity. Outgroup selection for phylogenetic analyses
within M. namaquensis was problematic due to several
proposed hypotheses of evolutionary relationships
between Micaelamys and other murids [[3,95] and references therein]. In a preliminary analysis A. chrysophilus,
A. ineptus, Parotomys brantsi, Dasymys incomtus, Rattus
rattus, M. musculus, Rhabdomys pumilio and Arvicanthis somalicus were included as outgroups. These
species are distant to the ingroup but given their sister
group relationship (results not shown) and former congeneric status [33], the two Aethomys species were
selected as outgroups in further analyses. However, R.
rattus and M. musculus were used in the BEAST analysis since a fossil calibration point was available (see section on molecular clocks).
A likelihood ratio test as implemented in Modeltest,
version 3.06 [96] was used to determine the best-fit
model of DNA substitution for the 631 bp cyt b
sequences under the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and to estimate the relevant parameters under
this model. The best-fit General-Time-Reversible (GTR)
model of substitution with a gamma correction (Γ =
1.09; [97]), and a proportion of invariable sites (I = 0.54)
was applied in phylogenetic analyses. The Bayesian analysis was conducted using MrBAYES version, 3.1.2 [98].
Four chains were run for 5 × 106 generations using random starting trees and flat priors. Trees and parameters
were recorded every 100 th generation. Two runs were
performed simultaneously and split frequencies were
compared every 100th generation to ensure convergence
of the runs. Both runs used the default heating and
swap parameters. The first 5 000 generations (10%)
were excluded as the burn-in. A 10% burn-in was

Russo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:307
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/307

sufficient to ensure that trees were only sampled from
the region of stationarity.
To estimate a rate of evolution and dates of divergence
between these lineages, a log-normal relaxed-clock analysis was performed using the speciation model: Yule process as implemented in BEAST, version 1.4.7 [99]: three
independent runs of 20 × 106 generations each were performed. A specific rate of change calibrated for murid
rodents was determined since murid mtDNA has been
shown to evolve at a faster rate than other rodents [100].
As a calibration point, sequence data from R. rattus and
M. musculus, with a divergence date estimated at 12 Mya
based on fossil records, was used [101]. In contrast, other
divergence dates (between 10 and 41 Mya) have been
suggested for Rattus and Mus [102-104]. The divergence
date of 12 Mya was followed since it is based on the fossil
record and provided a rodent-specific calibration. The
use of a non-rodent calibration point results in divergence times that are much older than the paleontological
record [102].
Posterior distributions of parameters were approximated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [105]
sampling [99] with samples drawn every 1 000th iteration
over a total of 20 × 106 generations, excluding the first
4 000 generations as the burn-in. Three independent analyses were run and the results were combined using LogCombiner, version 1.4.7 [99]. Independent runs were
combined in Tracer, version 1.4 [106], which provide
options for examining effective sample size (ESS) values
and to evaluate adequate mixing and convergence to the
stationary distribution. This was evaluated by the Bayesian skyline plot [107] as calculated in Tracer, version 1.4
[106]. Posterior estimates for rate and divergence date
estimates were similar between runs. The final tree
created from the three independent runs was viewed in
FigTree, version 1.2.2 [99]. The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) published a timescale chart
in 2009. This chart was used in order to interpret divergence dates as observed in the BEAST analysis (see: strategra http://www.stratigraphy.org).
The minimum number of mutational steps between
M. namaquensis alleles was determined from a distance
matrix using MINSPNET [108] and TCS [109]. Frequencies and geographic distributions of different alleles
were used to depict geographical and potential ancestordescendant relationships among identified allele
sequences. To illustrate contrasting patterns of intraclade structuring, TCS and MINSPNET were also used
to produce minimum-spanning networks for all divergent haplogroups identified.
A Mantel test as implemented in Mantel Nonparametric Test Calculator, version 2.0 [110] was used to
test for isolation by distance within identified lineages/

Page 13 of 16

haplogroups. The test uses a permutation procedure
(1 000 permutations) to determine the significance of
the correlation between genetic versus geographic distances. Some of the groups could not be subjected to
the Mantel test, as too few individuals were sampled.
For purposes of the present study, we follow the
biome/bioregion definitions as defined by [45], although
biome definitions are largely identical irrespective of the
authority. See Figures 1 and 5 for biome information
and [45] for more information on biomes/bioregions.
Maximum likelihood (ML) [111,112] was used to test
for the association between lineages and the major
biomes of southern Africa. ML as implemented in
PhyML, version 3.0 [113,114] was conducted using 100
random addition replicates and was based on a heuristic
search using the tree bisection-reconnection (TBR)
option; the best fit substitution model parameters were
applied. Support values for internal nodes were determined using bootstrap analysis [115] with 100 iterations
performed on a computer cluster.
