Genome-wide transcription factor binding
site/promoter databases for the analysis of gene
sets and co-occurrence of transcription factor
binding motifs

Abstract
Background: The use of global gene expression profiling is a well established approach to understand biological
processes. One of the major goals of these investigations is to identify sets of genes with similar expression
patterns. Such gene signatures may be very informative and reveal new aspects of particular biological processes.
A logical and systematic next step is to reduce the identified gene signatures to the regulatory components that
induce the relevant gene expression changes. A central issue in this context is to identify transcription factors, or
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), likely to be of importance for the expression of the gene signatures.
Results: We develop a strategy that efficiently produces TFBS/promoter databases based on user-defined criteria.
The resulting databases constitute all genes in the Santa Cruz database and the positions for all TFBS provided by
the user as position weight matrices. These databases are then used for two purposes, to identify significant TFBS
in the promoters in sets of genes and to identify clusters of co-occurring TFBS. We use two criteria for significance,
significantly enriched TFBS in terms of total number of binding sites for the promoters, and significantly present
TFBS in terms of the fraction of promoters with binding sites. Significant TFBS are identified by a re-sampling
procedure in which the query gene set is compared with typically 105 gene lists of similar size randomly drawn
from the TFBS/promoter database. We apply this strategy to a large number of published ChIP-Chip data sets and
show that the proposed approach faithfully reproduces ChIP-Chip results. The strategy also identifies relevant TFBS
when analyzing gene signatures obtained from the MSigDB database. In addition, we show that several TFBS are
highly correlated and that co-occurring TFBS define functionally related sets of genes.
Conclusions: The presented approach of promoter analysis faithfully reproduces the results from several ChIP-Chip
and MigDB derived gene sets and hence may prove to be an important method in the analysis of gene signatures
obtained through ChIP-Chip or global gene expression experiments. We show that TFBS are organized in clusters
of co-occurring TFBS that together define highly coherent sets of genes.

Background
The use of global gene expression profiling is a well
established approach to characterize biological states or
responses. One of the major goals of these investigations
is to identify sets of genes with similar expression patterns that may shed new light on the underlying biological process leading to the observed states. A logical and

systematic next step is to reduce the identified gene signatures to the regulatory components that induce the
relevant gene expression states, with the over all goal to
identify the gene regulatory network in operation. A
central issue in this context is to identify transcription
factors, or transcription factor binding sites, likely to be
of importance for the expression of the gene signatures.
A constructive approach in this direction has been to
combine information on specific transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS) with information on gene coexpression as determined by global gene expression

analysis. The first step in this effort is to identify putative TFBSs in a set of gene promoters. This is normally
accomplished by searching the DNA sequence for
matches to generalized sequence patterns obtained from
experimentally characterized binding sites. These
sequence patterns are represented in the form of position weight matrices (PWM) that describe the probability distribution of the four possible nucleotides at each
location in the motif sequence. Several softwares such as
MATCH [1], MatInspector [2], and TESS [3] use PWMs
obtained from JASPAR [4] or TRANSFAC [5] - large
and frequently updated databases that contain PWMs to identify possible binding sites. An inherent problem
with TFBS searches is that the binding motifs are short
and degenerate which lead to high error rates in genome-wide scans. One approach to reduce the error rate
is to limit the search to evolutionarily conserved segments or to evolutionarily conserved binding sites only.
In addition, when working with sets of coordinated
genes the search may be restricted to TFBS shared by
all members in the gene set, or show over-representation. Hence, a productive method has been to select
genes that are significantly changed or show coordinated
expression, and then identify over-represented TFBSs in
the promoters of the selected genes. For example, in the
TOUCAN software [6] Markov background models are
used to identify significant binding sites analytically and
a parametric statistical algorithm to estimate enrichment, whereas in the CONFAC software [7] evolutionarily conserved binding sites are considered significant
and TFBS enrichment is evaluated by a non-parametric
statistical test using a fixed set of reference random
gene lists. An alternative approach to include gene
expression analyses in the protocol is to produce gene
sets based on shared TFBS and investigate the extent to
which genes in the sets show co-expression in published
gene expression data [8]. An extension of this approach
is to score all genes for high quality TFBS and then
investigate to what extent TFBS co-occur with the aim
to identify genes that show a high probability to be
regulated by the same sets of transcription factors. In
these latter approaches efficient means to produce lists
of possible target genes is necessary. In the present
investigation we develop a strategy that efficiently produces TFBS/promoter databases. The resulting TFBS/
promoter databases constitute all genes in the Santa
Cruz database and the positions for all TFBS provided
by the user as PWMs. These databases are then used
for two purposes, to identify significant TFBS in the
promoters of gene sets and to identify clusters of cooccurring TFBS on a genome-wide scale. In the first
application significant TFBS are identified by a re-sampling procedure in which the query gene set is compared with typically 10 5 independent gene lists of

similar size randomly drawn from the TFBS/promoter
database. For these purposes two criteria for significance
are used; significant enrichment and significant presence. We apply this strategy to both published ChIPChip data and to curated gene signatures obtained from
the MSigDB database. In the second application, we
show that several groups of TFBS are highly correlated
and that correlated TFBS define functionally related sets
of genes.

Results
Creating TFBS/promoter databases

To generate TFBS/promoter databases we developed the
SMART (Systematic Motif Analysis Retrieval Tool) software. The SMART software contains an application to
download RefSeqs, mRNA information, and promoter
regions from the UCSC Genome browser database to a
local MySQL database, and hence reduce the need for
frequent interactions with the UCSC Genome browser
database. The SMART software then retrieves each promoter sequence from the local database followed by
scanning for transcription factor binding sites. In this
study we used PWMs from the TRANSFAC v2009.1
database [5]. For the first TFBS/promoter database, core
similarity score (CSS) threshold values of 1.0 and matrix
similarity score (MSS) threshold values of 0.9, were used
to identify putative TFBS [1]. All hits of TFBS for the
same transcription factor, e.g., MYC_01, MYC_02, and
MYC_03, in a given promoter region were then summed
up. A first TFBS/promoter database was produced using
promoter sequences consisting of the - 1500 to +500
genomic interval relative putative TSSs, using the start
of the RefSeq or the mRNA with the most distal TSS
for each gene. Then a second TFBS/promoter database
aimed for phylogenic foot printing analyses was created
by using the corresponding orthologous genes listed in
the NCBI HomoloGene database based on human and
mouse. For each orthologous gene pair the evolutionarily conserved sequences within the - 5000 to +1000 bp
relative the TSS were identified using the BLAST program and the criterion e < 0.001, and TFBS identified as
above. In the present investigation the -1500 to +500 bp
TFBS/promoter database is composed of 18 377 genes
and the - 5000 to +1000 bp database of 13 117 genes.
Estimations of significance using TFBS/promoter
databases as references

We use two measures of significance to identify TFBS
likely to be involved in the regulation of the query gene
sets; significant enrichment (E); an estimation of TFBS
over-abundance in a query gene list, and significant presence (P); an estimation of TFBS promoter over-presence in a query gene list. TFBS enrichment analysis is
based on the observation that genes regulated by a given

Veerla et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:145
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/145

transcription factor tend to have several TFBS for the
factor in their respective promoter regions. To calculate
E the total number of instances of a given TFBS in the
promoters of genes in a query gene list is recorded.
Then the TFBS/promoter database is re-sampled with
replacement to produce randomly selected and independent gene lists with the same number of genes as in the
query list. The number of TFBS instances in each resampled gene list is recorded and then ranked according
to the number of TFBS present (the gene list with the
largest number of instances = rank 1) together with the
results for the query list. The rank of the query gene list
divided by the total number of re-sample instances is
then used as a p value for the probability to acquire the
level of enrichment by chance (PE). The PE value is then
transformed into a score by using the -Log(PE) value.
Assuming that all genes in a given query list are regulated by a given transcription factor TF A , one would
expect that each gene promoter contains at least one
binding site for TFA. The chance to find one instance of
a given TFBS in a promoter is however dependent on
the frequency of the corresponding sequence motif in
promoters. We therefore introduce the “significant presence” measure which is an estimate of the probability
(PP) to find the observed number of promoters with at
least one instance of the TFBS in a randomly selected
gene list of the same length as the query list. The PP is
estimated by a resampling procedure similar to the estimation of PE, and is converted to a score by using -Log
(PP). The fraction of genes (%-presence) in the query list
that contain at least one instance of a given TFBS is
also recorded.
Gene set promoter analysis

To validate the promoter analysis strategy it was first
applied to published ChIP-Chip data and then curated
gene sets from MSigDB. The rationale of using ChIPChip data is that such data is expected to identify gene
promoters that a given transcription factors interact
with physically. The results are either evaluated by a
table containing values for P E , P P , and %-presence,
respectively, or by score graphs produced by plotting
the -Log(PE), -Log(PP), and %-presence, in any combination. An example of a -Log(PE)/-Log(PP) graph is given
in Figure 1A in which the promoters of genes reported
by Boyer et al. to bind E2F4 by ChIP-Chip analysis
(BOYER_E2F4) have been analyzed using the -1500 to +500
bp surrounding the TSS’s and a total of 106 re-samples. The
analysis identified the TFBS E2F, E2F1, E2F1DP1,
E2F4DP2, E2F, E2F1DP1RB and E2F1DP2, among others,
as both significantly enriched and significantly present with
E and P scores of 6 in each case (Table 1). In Figure 1B a
three dimensional representation of the data is shown
based on the -Log(PE) and -Log(PP) scores, and %-presence.

This latter graph identifies E2F, E2F1, CBF, ETF, WHN,
VMYB, ELK1, and CETS1P54 as highly significant binding
sites.
Apart from data on E2F4 binding sites Boyer et al.
also reported ChIP-Chip data on NANOG, OCT4, and
SOX2 binding sites. As no definite PWM exists for
SOX2 in the TRANSFAC database no analyses of this
binding site were performed. The analyses of the genes
reported to bind NANOG or OCT4 using -1500 to +500
portions of the promoters did not indicate any binding
sites for the NANOG and OCT related transcription factors as significant. We then applied a phylogenic foot
printing approach using the -5000,+1000 portions of the
promoters (Additional file 1, Figure S1A and B). In this
case, NANOG and OCT related binding sites were
among the top ranking binding sites with respect to
E- and P-scores in the BOYER_NANOG and the BOYER_OCT4 data sets respectively. NANOG showed E- and
P-scores of 4.7 and 5, respectively, and the OCT related
binding sites OCT4, OCT1, and OCT all showed maximum E- and P-scores of 5 when using 105 re-samples.
Hence in this case positive data was only obtained when
limiting the analysis to evolutionarily conserved segments
of the promoters. The analysis of the BOYER_NANOG_OCT4_SOX2 data set, that contains genes that bind
all three transcription factors, produced top ranking
E- and P-scores for the OCT related bindings site
whereas the NANOG site showed moderate significance
when using the phylogenetic foot printing approach. On
the other hand, the OCT binding sites showed top scores
in the BOYER_NANOG data set (blue in Additional file
1, Figure S1A) and conversely, NANOG showed top
scores in the BOYER_OCT4 data set (blue in Additional
file 1, Figure S1B), indicating, as expected, a significant
overlap in the binding sites for these two transcription
factors. In addition to the BOYER_E2F4 data we also
analyzed the XU_E2F ChIP-Chip data using a 106 resampling procedure in which E2F1, E2F1DP1, E2F4DP2,
E2F1DP1EB TFBS all obtained maximum E- and
P-scores, i.e. equal to 6. The SMEENK_TP53 ChIP-Chip
data did not give as clear cut results as the previous
ChIP-Chip data. The promoter analysis of TP53 binding
genes resulted in the top ranking E-score (~3.3) but not
the top ranking P-score for TP53 (Additional file 1, Figure
S1C) even though the TP53 binding motif was present in
71% of the promoters (Additional file 1, Figure S1D).
We analyzed the ZELLER_MYC ChIP-Chip data in
three different ways. First all genes reported to bind
MYC, then the genes that bind MYC but lack the Ebox,
and then the genes that bind MYC and contain an Ebox
were included in the analysis. In the first analysis the
MYCMAX binding site was the most significant both
with respect to E- and P-scores (Additional file 2, Figure
S2A). The same analysis of MYC binding genes lacking

Ebox showed no significant enrichment of MYC related
binding sites (Additional file 2, Figure S2B), whereas the
analysis of Ebox containing genes showed significant Eand P-scores for all MYC related binding sites (Additional file 2, Figure S2C). In fact all six, NMYC, MYCMAX, MAX, MYC, MAX, and CMYC, as well EBOX,
showed maximum E- and P-scores of 5. In a subsequent
analysis using a 106 re-sample approach NMYC, MYCMAX, MAX, and CMYC, as well as EBOX binding sites
obtained maximum E- and P-scores of 6, underscoring
the enrichment of these sites in the promoters of MYC
binding genes with Eboxes (Additional file 2, Figure
S2D). As this analysis was limited to the -1500 to +500
regions of the promoters one may tentatively conclude
that Ebox containing genes preferentially show MYC
binding sites in the close vicinity of the TSSs whereas
genes lacking Eboxes may bind the MYC transcription
factors outside the -1500,+500 regions, or use an as yet
not identified binding motif.
We then analyzed the ODOM_HNF6_Hepa and
ODOM_HNF6_Panc ChIP-Chip data, Figure 2A and 2B.
In both sets of genes HNF6 binding sites showed topranking E- and P-scores and were detected in 45% of the
promoters in the Hepa and Panc gene sets respectively
(Figure 2C and 2D). Interestingly, the binding sites
CDPCR3HD and CDPCR1 both showed maximum Eand P-scores in both data sets. These sites were present
in 18 and 21% in the HNF6-Hepa and HNF6-Panc

promoters, respectively, indicating these as possible cofactors in a sub set of the genes. The data also indicated
the possible role for HOXA3 in the regulation of this set
of genes. HOXA3 was present in 84% of the promoters
from both cell types and was among the top ranking
binding sites with respect to E- and P-scores in both the
Hepa and the Panc sets of HNF6 binding genes.
To further explore the strategy we analyzed gene signatures obtained from the MSigDB database associated
with induced expression of various transcription factors
or processes (hypoxia) known to involve specific transcription factors. We downloaded four gene sets related
to MYC gene expression, FERNANDEZ_MYC_TARGETS, MYC_ONCOGENE_SIGNATURE, MYC_TARGETS, and LEE_MYC_UP. The genes in the respective
gene sets were analyzed in the -1500,+500 portions of
the promoters using a 105 resampling procedure (Figure
3). All MYC related binding sites, MYCMAX, MYC,
NMYC, CMYC, MAX, and EBOX, showed maximum
E- and P-scores (equal to 5) in the FERNANDEZ_MYC_TARGETS and all but MYCMAX in the
MYC_ONCOGENE_SIGNATURE gene set. All but
CMYC showed maximal E scores in the MYC_TARGETS gene set whereas the P scores were moderate but
still among the top ranking. None of the MYC related
binding sites showed high scores in the LEE_MYC_UP
gene set, in fact all of them showed E- and P-scores
below 1. A possible explanation for the negative results

obtained for the LEE_MYC_UP signature could be that
this signature is dominated by late/secondary MYC targets not directly regulated by the MYC protein. An indication that this may be the case was the finding that
only 27% of the promoters in the LEE_MYC_UP gene
set contained EBOX motifs whereas these were seen in
70% of the promoters in the FERNANDEZ_MYC_TARGETS gene set. Essentially the same results were
obtained when repeating the analysis using the phylogenic foot printing approach, including the negative
results for the LEE_MYC_UP gene set (Additional file 3,
Figure S3). We performed similar analyses of four
hypoxia related gene signatures (Figure 4). The HIF1
binding site was the single site that showed maximum
E/P scores in the MENSE_HYPOXIA_UP gene set. The
HIF1 site showed the top ranking E-score and was
among the top ranking with respect to the P-score in
the HIF1_TARGETS gene set, showed moderate E- and
P-scores (3 to 4) in the HYPOXIA_NORMAL_UP gene
set, and showed low scores (<3) in the MANALO_HYPOXIA_UP gene set. Hence, the analysis indicated HIF1
as the most important binding site in two of the gene

sets. Repeating the analysis using the phylogenic foot
printing approach further emphasized the importance of
HIF1 sites, particularly in the HYPOXIA_NORMAL_UP
gene set, but did not improve the results for the MANALO_HYPOXIA_UP set of genes (Additional file 4, Figure S4). As for the LEE_MYC_UP signature, the poor
results for the MANALO_HYPOXIA_UP gene set could
possibly be explained by the presence of a hypoxia late
response signature. We also noticed that whereas the
HIF1 site was one of the top ranking TFBS in all the
MYC signatures investigated that also showed MYC
targets as top-ranking, MYC TFBSs were not top-ranking in the hypoxia related signatures. The HINATA_NFKB_UP gene set showed top ranking E- and
P-scores for the NFKB, NFKAPPB, and NFKAPPB65
binding sites using the -1500,+500 regions (Figure 5A).
The NFKAPPB50 motif was however not significant.
The importance of the NFKB related TFBS for this set
of genes was further emphasized using the phylogenic
foot printing approach (Figure 5B). Poor results were
however obtained for the HANSON_NFKAPPB_IND
gene set using both approaches (Figure 5C and 5D).
The analysis of the KANNAN_TP53_UP gene signature
indicated P53 as the most significantly enriched binding
site with an E-score close to 4. Even though the P-score
was non-convincing (~1), the TP53 site was present in
close to 80% of the promoters. This type of results i.e.,
moderate E-Scores and low P-scores but high %-presence, was also obtained for the SMEENK_TP53 ChIPChip data and indicates that TP53 binding sites are frequently seen in promoters albeit at low numbers for
each promoter. Additional MSigDB signatures that performed well were E2F3_ONCOGENETIC_SIGNATURE
generating E- and P-scores of 5 for E2F1, E2F, and
E2F1DP1RB site, respectively; HALMOS_CEBP indicating CEBP and CEBPGAMMA as the two top two binding sites with respect to E- and P-scores when applying
phylogenic foot printing, and the BILD_MYC signature,
that included EBOX, MYC, MAX, CMYC, and MYCMAX among the top ten ranking together with USF,
USF2, HIF1, ARNT, and CLOCKBMAL, and BILD_E2F3, that included E2F1, E2F, E2F1DP1, and
E2F1DP1RB among the 15 binding sites with E- and Pscores equal to 5.
Identification of sets of co-occurring TFBS and defining
TFBS based gene signatures

It is well established that most transcription factors do
not act in solitude but in a cooperative fashion with
other factors. Hence, co-regulated genes are expected to
share more than one TFBS in their promoters, as was, e.g.,
seen in the above analyses of the MSigDB gene sets. To
gain new knowledge on such possible combinations
we used the -1500 to +500 TFBS/promoter database to

produce a correlation matrix among the TFBS’s using the
number of instances for each TFBS in each promoter as
variables. This matrix was subsequently re-ordered using
hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA; Additional file 5,
Figure S5). The obtained re-ordered correlation matrix
did indeed show distinct features. Apart from TFBS’s
showing strong and significant correlations, a portion
of the TFBS showed no or very low correlations. In
Figure 6 the analysis has been limited to subset of TFBS
that showed the most varying correlations (indicated in
Additional file 5, Figure S5). Based on the hierarchical

clustering several tentative groups of co-occurring TFBS
could be defined (Figure 6 and 7). Interestingly, strong
negative correlations were also detected in the data, particularly between the TEF1_BACH1, DBP_GATA, and
FREAC_HFH clusters and the GC_WHN and MAZR_IK
TFBS clusters suggesting a selection against the cooccurrence of these groups of TFBS in gene promoters.
No negative correlations were however detected when
the analysis was repeated using the evolutionarily conserved portions of the -1500,+500 promoter regions (data
not shown).

We then produced gene signatures based on groups of
correlated TFBS as defined by the HCA. To evaluate the
coherence of the top ranking genes in the respective gene
lists the top 2000 genes were analyzed for GO category
enrichment. Of the 18 TFBS clusters listed in Figure 8,
twelve showed significant enrichment (Bonferroni corrected p < 0.05) of gene ontology terms (Table 2 and
Additional file 6, Table S1). Hence, most of the TFBS
based gene signatures were significant for specific

biological processes, including as diverse processes as regulation of transcription, intracellular signaling cascade,
and immune response. The above analysis was repeated
with the TFBS/promoter database based on phylogenic
foot printing and the -5000,+1000 portions of the promoters. Again several clusters of co-occurring TFBS was
identified and the most varying TFBS were selected for

diverse as regulation of transcription, cell adhesion, and
neurogenesis.
There are arguments for using relatively short intervals
as the definition of a promoter as well as for longer
intervals but then limit the analysis to evolutionarily
conserved regions. Both approaches have advantages
and limitations. The above analyses of ChIP-Chip and
MSigDB gene signatures, as well as that of co-occurring
TFBS, show that similar but not always identical results

may be obtained using either approach. To capitalize on
the benefits of both approaches we produced a third
TFBS/promoter database that takes into consideration
the -1500,+500 portions of the promoters as well as the
-5000 to -1500 and the +500 to +1000 evolutionarily
conserved portions. This produced a TFBS/promoter
database consisting of 13 096 genes. We used this database to identify co-occurring TFBS using the QT-clust
algorithm, a more stringent method than manual
inspection of HCA dendrograms. This algorithm produced 58 groups of at least two co-occurring TFBS
(Table 3 and Additional file 9, Table S3). Many of these

TFBS hits in each gene promoter were produced and the
top 1300 genes in each TFBS gene signature were subjected to analysis using the Ingenuity software. In Table 4
results obtained for the Ingenuity categories “Molecular
and Cellular Functions”, “Physiological System Development and Function” and “Top Canonical Pathways” are
listed for 10 of the most biologically coherent TFBS clusters. Intriguingly, of the 10 TFBS clusters in Table 4,

three were involved in “Nervous System Development” or
“Function and Axonal Guidance Signaling” and five in
immune response, which may indicate that these processes are orchestrated by a several combinations of transcription factors. Taken together, both the HCA and the
QT-clust formed clusters of co-occurring TFBS that
defined gene signatures with distinct biological properties.

Discussion
The backbone of the present investigation is the construction of the TFBS/promoter databases that we used for two

purposes; as a background files when analyzing promoters
for significant TFBS and as possible sources for investigating relationships among TFBS. As the definition of a promoter may vary from type of investigation and scientific
questions asked, an advantage of the presented tool is that
variant TFBS/promoter databases may be produced readily. In the present investigation we used three types of
databases each based on different promoter definitions;
regions derived from short segments upstream of the TSS,
conserved regions derived from large upstream segments,
and a combination of these two. We used two measures
for significance, significantly enriched (E) and significantly

present (P) TFBS, and rank statistics based on a resampling procedure to estimate the corresponding p-values.
The E and P measures capture two aspects of TFBS significance, the recognition that genes regulated by a specific
transcription factor tend to have several recognition sites
for that particular factor and that genes regulated by a specific transcription factor are expected to have at least one
binding site each for that factor. The advantage of estimating p-values by a re-sampling method is that no assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of TFBS or of
promoter DNA sequences has to be made. Even though
we used a simple rule to score promoters (genes), i.e., the

number of high scoring motifs per promoter, biologically
relevant and intriguing results were obtained. Furthermore, as we use gene sets as the unit for investigation, and
not individual promoters, the inclusion of false positive
sites for individual genes identified with PWMs will have
limited effect on the final results. We showed that the presented strategy could faithfully reproduce several ChIPChip results, and hence validate the strategy. Nonetheless,
there were some ChIP-Chip data that the strategy could
not reproduce, e.g., Palomero et al. [9] (TAL1 targets) and
Reed et al. [10] (SREBP1 targets). There might be more
than one explanation for these discrepancies, e.g., ChIPChip data most likely contain false positives to a varying
degree and the PWM database employed, TRANSFAC,
may not be complete. An indication that the latter may be
the case is the fact that several ChIP-Chip and ChIP/PET
investigations have led to the discovery of new consensus
binding sites e.g., both Smeenk et al. [11] and Wei et al.
[12] present new TP53 motifs based on whole genome
ChIP analyses. It is thus likely that future ChIP-Chip and
ChIP/PET analyses will describe additional motifs for
other transcription factors as well. Discrepant results for
MSigDB derived gene signatures may be caused by several
factors. Apart from the fact that not all possible PWMs
may be present in the TRANSFAC database, an additional
complication is that the response to a given perturbation
may vary with the experimental procedures used, e.g., the
gene signature response may vary with time and thus
include secondary targets to varying degrees. An additional

factor that may reduce the E- and P-scores is that most
signatures in MSigDB have been obtained by micro array
experiments in which not all possible genes were included
in the analysis. Consequently, estimations by rank statistics
using the whole genome as a reference, as was performed,
may underestimate and skew the actual E- and P-scores.
Moreover, in some instances it may be beneficial to use a
reference matched to some characteristics of the gene signature, e.g., GC-content [13]. Nonetheless, several of the
gene signatures from the MSigDB produced consistent
results, again showing the strength of the proposed
strategy.
Apart from using the TFBS/promoter databases as
references when performing promoter analyses the databases were also used as a source for investigating TFBS
co-occurrences. Using hierarchical cluster analysis we
were able to detect several clusters of TFBS. Similar,
and often identical, clusters of TFBS were obtained
when applying the phylogenic foot printing approach as
well as when we used the hybrid TFBS/promoter database and an alternative clustering principle. This indicates that the observed TFBS clusters are to a certain
level robust and not dependent on the algorithms used
to detect them. Some of the obtained TFBS clusters
were most likely caused by the presence of overlapping
binding motifs, e.g., the AML and MYC TFBS clusters,
whereas others may represent true co-occurrence in the
sense that the DNA sequence of the binding motifs are
unrelated. As no criterion for proximity, i.e., minimum

distance between TFBS, was used many of the identified
TFBS patterns are less constrained than so called TFBS
modules, typically 100-300 bp in size. The obtained
results thus suggest that long distance but within promoter combinatorics may operate among transcription
factors. Interestingly, some clusters of TFBS showed
negative correlations. The negative correlations were
however lost when the analyses were limited to the evolutionarily conserved parts of the promoters. This makes
sense if selection against co-occurrence results in disruption of the respective TFBS as this ultimately would
result in a degenerated sequence and no sequence conservation. Such selection could possibly act to minimize

contradicting regulatory signals caused by, e.g., spurious
expression of transcription factor genes, or to keep different cellular states/processes well separated from a
regulatory point of view. The target genes for the
respective TFBS clusters represented in almost all cases
biologically coherent sets of genes, as determined by
GO term enrichment analyses or the Ingenuity software,
and represented highly divergent cellular processes.
Hence, we conclude that the identified TFBS clusters,
and their associated gene signatures, are of biological
relevance.
We are aware of several limitations of the above analyses. For instance, the most appropriate way to identify

have produced target gene lists of varying sizes; an
option that could easily be biologically motivated. As an

Nevertheless, most of the identified TFBS gene signatures were associated with coherent cellular processes
and made biological sense. To facilitate future investigations we will provide the software used in this available

Conclusions
We have provided a flexible tool to produce TBFS/promoter databases. We have described a approach to identify significant TFBS in gene sets by use of a resampling
strategy and the introduction of a new measure of significance, significantly present (P P ). We apply this
approach to several published ChIP-Chip data and
curated gene signatures obtained from MSigDB and
show that the strategy produces consistent results and
hence may be useful in the analysis of gene expression
profiles or ChIP-Chip data. In addition, we have shown
that TFBS form stable clusters of co-occurring TFBS
that in a consorted fashion seems to regulate sets of
genes associated with highly specific cellular processes.
Methods
Data sets

We selected published ChIP-Chip data sets for validation using the criteria that the data should be easy to
access and that approximate positions of the binding
sites relative the TSS of the genes were available. For
E2F4, NANOG, and OCT4 ChIP-Chip target genes we

used the data provided by Boyer et al. [15], named BOYER_E2F4, BOYER_NANOG, and BOYER_OCT4 in the
present investigation. We also included a list of genes
that by ChIP-Chip analysis were shown to simultaneously bind NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 provided by
Boyer at al., BOYER_NANOG_OCT4_SOX2. The analyses were limited to genes that contained targets within
8 kb upstream of the TSS. ChIP-Chip data from Xu
et al. [16] were used to produce a list of genes
(XU_E2F) with strong E2F binding. For MYC ChIPChip target genes we used data provided by Zeller et al.
[17] but only included genes with 5’ locations of ChIPChip targets (ZELLER_MYC). Only genes with reported
ChIP-Chip targets within the -1500 to TSS region were
included. For analyses of HNF6 target genes in hepatocytic and pancreatic cells the data provided by
Odom et al. [18] was used (ODOM_HNF6_Hepa and
ODOM_HNF6_Panc). TP53 ChIP-Chip target genes
were obtained from the Smeenk et al. [11] ChIP-Chip
data (SMEENK_TP53). Two SMEENK_TP53 data sets
were produced, one including genes with ChIP-Chip targets within the -1500 to +500 promoter segment and
one including genes with targets within the -5000 to
+1000 promoter segment. Curated gene sets for various
conditions were obtained from the MSigDB database
[19]. Gene set designations are the same as in the
MSigDB database. Gene signatures for MYC and E2F3
were obtained from Bild et al. [20], BILD_MYC and
BILD_E2F3, respectively.

We used hierarchical clustering with 1-Pearson as a distance measure and average-linkage for agglomeration in
the initial analyses. Groups of TFBS that behaved similarly were identified by manual inspection. We also used
the more stringent QT Clust (Quality Cluster algorithm)
modified from Heyer et al. [21]. QT Clust proceeds by
forming a candidate cluster with the first TFBS as a seed
and grouping TFBS’s with the highest correlation iteratively in a way that minimizes the cluster diameter d,
until no further genes may be added without exceeding a
predetermined d-value. This procedure is performed with
all TFBS in the data set as a seed. The largest cluster is
then retrieved and the procedure repeated with the
remaining TFBS on the list until no further clusters may
be formed. This makes sure that the largest and most
coherent clusters of TFBS are formed. We used a threshold diameter of 0.5 based on Pearson correlation and a
minimal cluster size of 2 members. Identified TFBS cluster gene signatures were evaluated either with the EASE
[22] or the Ingenuity software [23]. To produce gene signatures for groups of correlated TFBS we first normalized
the number of hits per promoter by dividing with the
total number of detected hits for each TFBS. Then the
sum of the normalized hits for gene members in a given
TFBS cluster was calculated for each gene promoter, and
finally the genes were ranked according the sum of normalized hits. This produced gene lists composed of 18
377 genes using the TFBS/promoter database based on
the -1500 to +500 genomic intervals and 13 177 when
using the phylogenetic foot printing approach, in which
the top ranking genes will have the largest number of
normalized hits for binding sites in their promoters.
