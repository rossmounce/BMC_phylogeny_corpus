Abstract
: A recent systematic survey suggested that the YRG (or YawG/YlqF) family with the G4-G5-G1G2-G3 order of the conserved GTPase motifs represents the only possible circularly permuted
variation of the canonical GTPase structure. Here we show that a different circularly permuted
GTPase domain actually does exist, conforming to the pattern G3-G4-G5-G1-G2. The domain,
dubbed cpRAS, is a variant of RAS family GTPases and occurs in two types of larger proteins, either
inserted into a region homologous to a bacterial group of proteins classified as COG2373 and
potentially related to the alpha-2-macroglobulin family (so far a single protein in Dictyostelium) or in
combination with a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain. For the latter protein type, which
was found in a few metazoans and several distantly related protists, existence in the common
ancestor of opisthokonts, Amoebozoa and excavates followed by at least eight independent losses
may be inferred. Our findings thus bring further evidence for the importance of parallel reduction
of ancestral complexity in the eukaryotic evolution.

Findings
One of the evolutionary innovations that may affect a protein fold is the so-called circular permutation [1,2]. This
term refers to a situation whereby the N-terminal part of
one protein is homologous to the C-terminal part of
another protein and vice versa. Circular permutations have
been found in a wide range of proteins [3] and other
examples are definitely to be discovered in the rapidly
growing protein sequence databases. Some authors discriminate between a swap and a circular permutation
[3,4]. The swap is then any mutually altered order of
homologous regions in proteins, while the circular permutation refers to a special case of a swap where swapped

regions cover essentially the whole protein length. We
shall use the term "circular permutation" to describe an
altered order of N- and C-terminal segments of individual
proteins domains, regardless of the actual size and
domain composition of the whole proteins.
P-loop GTPases and related proteins form a vast superclass of globular α/β proteins with the most conserved
and functionally important regions denoted as G1 to G5
motifs [5,6]. One of the many distinct evolutionary lineages of the superclass referred to as YawG/YlqF [5] or YRG
[7] family comprises proteins with a non-canonical order
of the conserved motifs, which are arrayed in a circularly

permuted fashion G4-G5-G1-G2-G3. However, crystal
structures of several representatives [8,9] (Kniewel et al.,
unpublished, PDB accession number 1PUJ) and biochemical studies [7,10] have demonstrated a rather typical
GTPase fold and the expected GTP-binding/GTPase function of these proteins.
A recent systematic search for circularly permuted GTPases
has identified the YRG family as the only group with such
a modification of the GTPase domain [11]. The authors
argued that other possible circular permutations of the
GTPase domain are unlikely owing to structural or functional constrains. For example, according to Anand and
colleagues, the G3-G4-G5-G1-G2 permutation, which
breaks the reverse turn between the strands β2 and β3,
should impair the proper folding of the protein [11].
In the course of our systematic survey of the Ras superfamily, we noted that two large uncharacterised proteins
from Dictyostelium discoideum, EAL68747.1 and
EAL60755.1 (hereafter referred to as DdiCPRas1 and
DdiCPRas2, respectively), contain a putative circularly
permuted GTPase domain with the conserved motifs G1G2 lying downstream of the G3-G4-G5 motifs (Fig. 1A).
At the secondary structure level, the region corresponding
to strand1-helix1-strand2 of a canonical GTPase domain
(here exemplified by the human HRAS) directly follows
the region equivalent to helix5. Based on sequence comparison with available GTPase sequences, the domain in
DdiCPRas1 and DdiCPRas2 could be readily classified
into the RAS family, which consists of mostly small proteins composed of a GTPase domain and a hypervariable
C-terminal tail with a prenylated cysteine residue ensuring
membrane localisation of the protein [12,13]. Except the
circular permutation, the domains in DdiCPRas1 and
DdiCPRas2 are rather typical RAS family GTPase domains
including, for instance, the "TIE" G2 motif (Fig. 1A) characteristic for the family. DdiCPRas1 and DdiCPRas2 thus
define a new subtype of RAS family proteins.
Using MODELLER 9.1 [14] and the human HRAS structure (1ZW6) as a template, we build a 3-D model of the
cpRAS domain of DdiCPRas1 (Fig. 1B and Additional file
1). Because of the circular permutation, the DdiCPRas1
sequence had to be reshuffled so that it could have been
aligned with HRAS and the N- and C-termini of the model
were created artificially by removing the bond between
the strands 2 and 3. The template did not help in elucidating the conformation of the putative loop between the
helix 5 and strand 1, so this loop is not included in the
model. Furthermore, it is likely that the actual appearance
and position of the helix5 and strand1 is slightly different
from that indicated by the model because of the connection between them implicated by the primary structure of
the cpRAS domain. Nevertheless, although experimental

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/21

verification is required, the model and the presence of typical GTPase signature motifs suggest that DdiCPRas1 very
likely retains a GTPase function despite the circular permutation. The GTPase function is also conserved in the
previously described version of a circularly permuted
GTPase domain of the YRG family [7,10], which however
differs from the cpRAS domain in lacking a connection
between the strand3 and helix2 rather than between
strands 2 and 3 (Fig. 1B).
In order to illuminate the evolutionary origin of the
cpRAS domain, we used BLAST [15] to search genome
databases for orthologs of the Dictyostelium CPRas1 and
CPRas2 proteins (see Additional file 1 for details on
sequence data sources). Interestingly, the cpRAS domain
was found in other species, but the phylogenetic distribution of cpRAS is highly scattered, comprising a few metazoans (so far only the lancet Branchiostoma floridae, the sea
urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the sponge
Amphimedon queenslandica), the choanoflagellate Monosiga
brevicollis, the unicellular opisthokont Capsaspora owczarzaki, the amoebozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii, and the
heterolobosean Naegleria gruberi (Fig. 1A, 2A). According
to their domain architecture, these proteins fall into two
groups (Fig. 2B).
The first comprises the Dictyostelium DdiCPRas1 and
CPRas from other species and is represented by proteins of
≈ 840–970 amino acid residues characterised by a poorly
conserved N-terminal region of 40–66 residues without
any recognisable homology to other proteins, the cpRAS
domain, a poorly conserved putative linker region, and a
conserved C-terminal half that contains a domain annotated as "von Willebrand factor (vWF) type A (VWA)"
domain in the SMART collection [16] or as "Sec23/Sec24
trunk" domain (PF04811) in the Pfam database [17]. In
addition, inspection of a multiple alignment suggests that
a type of zinc finger motif including four absolutely conserved cysteine residues may be present in most of these
proteins (except the protein from Acanthamoeba)
upstream the VWA domain, although it receives only high
E-values or is not recognised at all by domain identification tools. The CPRas protein from Naegleria additionally
harbours a RING finger motif fused to the C-terminus.
Interestingly, proteins remarkably similar to the C-terminal half of this CPRas type including the potential zinc
finger but lacking even vestiges of an N-terminal cpRAS
domain can be found in several taxa, namely Dictyostelium, Entamoeba dispar, some metazoans (the mollusc Lottia gigantea, the annelid Capitella sp. I, Strongylocentrotus),
and ciliates (Fig. 2B). Based on the level of mutual similarity, these proteins appear to be a group of their own,
evolutionarily separate from the C-terminal half of CPRas
proteins with the cpRAS-VWA domain arrangement (data
not shown).

a putative loop that is missing from the solved structure. Secondary structure elements in cpRAS and YlqF are labelled according to the equivalent β-strands and α-helices (S1 to S6 and H1 to H5) in HRAS, although their actual position in the polypeptide

are shown in the context of the global eukaryotic phylogeny (based on recent phylogenetic literature). Dashed branches correspond to lineages that seem to have lost the cpRAS domain (genomes examined for the presence of but lacking the domain are
listed in Table S1 in Additional file 1). The question mark indicates that it is unclear whether the absence of the cpRAS domain
in Chromalveolata and Chloroplastida+Rhodophyta is primary or secondary. (B) Domain organisation of CPRas proteins. Blue
zones indicate regions of mutual homology between CPRas proteins (here exemplified by Dictyostelium representatives) and
related proteins lacking a cpRAS domain indicated by BLASTP. Only the C-terminal half of DdiCPRas2 is shown (the N-terminal half does not contain any recognisable conserved domain or motif). The domains with dashed outlines are recognised with
insignificant E-values or are suggested on the basis of visual inspection of a multiple alignment only. For brevity, only a single
representative of a larger family of paralogous VWA domain-containing proteins is indicated for each Tetrahymena and Paramecium.

The large Dictyostelium protein DdiCPRas2 (3933 residues) shares with other cpRAS proteins only the circularly
permuted GTPase domain corresponding to residues
2844–3013, while the rest differs completely (Fig. 2B).
The N-terminal part of the DdiCPRas2 shows no clear
homology to other proteins or domains in searches with
BLASTP, SMART, Search Pfam, or CD-search, but two
large blocks of the protein flanking N- and C-terminally
the cpRAS domain, approximately residues 2140–2771
and 3158 to the very C-terminus, show significant BLASTP
similarity (E-values of 3.10–32 and higher) to a group of
bacterial uncharacterised proteins (in Fig. 2B exemplified
by a protein from Anabaena variabilis) representing the
family COG2373 in the CDD database [18]. The family is
named "Large extracellular alpha-helical protein" [19],
but the basis for this annotation is unclear and should be
treated with caution. This family may actually be homologous to the eukaryotic alpha-2-macroglobulin family of
serum proteins, because a series of domain typical for this
family, specifically the A2M_N (PF01835), A2M_N_2
(PF07703), and A2M_like (cd02891) domains, can be
recognised in COG2373 proteins using Search Pfam and/
or CD-search. These domains appear to be conserved also

in DdiCPRas2, although the A2M_N_2 domain is recognised with insignificant E-value only. The unique and
unusual architecture of DdiCPRas2 among other proteins
with the cpRAS domain might raise doubts about the
accuracy of the respective nucleotide sequence or gene
model. However, an incomplete sequence of an obviously
orthologous gene with potentially the same domain architecture is present in a low-coverage assembly of the
genome of another Dictyostelium species, D. purpureum
(scaffold_491 [20]), confirming the authenticity of the
DdiCPRas2-like type of CPRas proteins.
According to our phylogenetic analysis based on an extensive sampling of the RAS family (168 sequences), all
cpRAS domains are of a monophyletic origin with the
cpRAS domain of DdiCPRas2 nested within the cpRAS
clade, although without support from bootstrap analysis
(data not shown). Given also its much wider phylogenetic
distribution, it seems that the cpRAS-VWA domain organisation evolutionarily precedes the DdiCPRas2-like
domain arrangement. Interestingly, when the DdiCPRas2
sequence excluding the cpRAS domain is used as a
BLASTP query against the NCBI nr database, the signifi-

cant hits comprise sequences from diverse bacteria but
only one eukaryotic entry – another COG2373-like protein (but lacking a GTPase domain) from Dictyostelium
(EAL60755.1). We therefore suggest that the type of
CPRas proteins represented by DdiCPRas2, specifically its
C-terminal part, evolved by insertion of a copy of a cpRAS
domain from a cpRAS-VWA protein into a COG2373-like
protein introduced into the Dictyostelium lineage by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from prokaryotes.

Reviewers' comments
The YRG family is widespread in all Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, and Eukaryota [6,7,11], so the circular permutation that generated the GTPase domain of this family
probably occurred before the last universal common
ancestor (LUCA). By contrast, the cpRAS domain is apparently a much later eukaryote-specific derivative of the
GTPase fold. The scattered phylogenetic distribution of
the cpRAS domain might indicate its origin in a particular
eukaryotic lineage followed by dissemination by HGT.
However, our phylogenetic analysis of the full cpRASVWA protein sequences (see Fig. S1 in Additional file 1)
does not provide any strong evidence for HGT among the
distinct eukaryotic lineages and the results are compatible
with the scenario whereby cpRAS-VWA occurred already
in the common ancestor of Excavata, Amoebozoa, and
Opisthokonta but was lost independently from at least
eight lineages (Fig. 2A). Although sequencing of additional genomes is necessary to test this hypothesis, it is
likely that most cases of the absence of the cpRAS domain
will indeed prove as resulting from secondary losses. The
cpRAS domain thus appears to provide further evidence
for an unexpected complexity of ancestral eukaryotes and
the importance of secondary reduction in the eukaryotic
evolution (see, e.g., [21,22]).
There appear to be no specific or well-defined functions
defined for the domains that physically combine with the
cpRAS domain (the VWA domain and the alpha-2-macroglobulin family domains), so the domain architecture
of CPRas proteins provides little clues as to their possible
cellular roles. Their highly scattered phylogenetic distribution in a disparate set of organisms indicates that they
may be implicated in rather specialised processes. The
CPRas proteins are thus definitely interesting candidates
for experimental characterisation.
In summary, our findings correct the claim by Anand and
colleagues [11] that the G4-G5-G1-G2-G3 arrangement of
the conserved GTPase motifs is „the only possible circular
permutation that can exist in nature" and further add to
the structural variations of the GTPase domain. Future
broader sampling of eukaryotic genomes will reveal more
on the evolutionary origin of the cpRAS domain and functional studies will establish the cellular role of CPRas proteins.

Reviewer 1: Lakshminarayan Iyer, National Center for
Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine,

This is a previously uncharacterized, circularly permuted
subfamily of the Ras GTPases that is sporadically distributed in a wide phyletic range of eukaryotes. The observation merits publication in order to bring attention to this
subfamily of proteins. I have a few points and several editorial suggestions.

Major comments
-The domain architectures need to be precisely described
and defined. There should only be one standard name for
domains. Sec23/Sec24 trunk is the vwA domain.
Authors' response: These two names indeed designate the same
domain. We have revised the respective part of the text so that
this is now clearer. However, because the different names for
this same domain are used variously in standard databases
(SMART, Pfam), we believe it is appropriate to mention both.
COG names are useful when the domain function or fold
is not clear. In the case of COG2373, there is little doubt
as to what it is and it should be correctly represented.
The alpha-2 macroglobulin domain needs to be more precisely described and it definitely is not alpha helical. The
cpRAS domain is lodged within multiple repeats of the
macroglobulin-like domain; this part is not described or
analyzed correctly.
Authors' response: It is true that COG2373 proteins and
DdiCPRas2 share several domains with the alpha-2 macroglobulin family of serum proteins, so we have added details on this
to the respective paragraph and to Fig. 2B. It is possible that
COG2373 proteins are bacterial orthologs of the alpha-2 macroglobulin family, but the similarity is low and to our best
knowledge, no COG2373 protein has been functionally characterised, so the actual nature of these proteins remains uncertain. In addition, the bacterial COG2373 proteins and
DdiCPRas2 exhibit regions of homology extending beyond the
alpha-2 macroglobulin domains and this fact is well captured
by the concept of the COG2373 family as defined in the standard database of conserved domains and families – the CDD

database. We have therefore kept the reference to the
COG2373 family in the revised text, though with doubts
expressed about the annotation of the family („Large extracellular alpha-helical protein").
Please check the architectures, some versions fused to the
vWA have an additional ring finger.
Authors' response: We are very thankful for this point, we
indeed missed a RING finger motif at the C-terminus of the
CPRas protein from Naegleria gruberi. In addition, further
inspection of CPRas protein sequences revealed a possible zinc
finger upstream the VWA domain. We have added a note on
this into the revised text.
- Given its solo presence, could DdiCPRas2 be an artificial
fusion caused by misassembly? Such things are very common with genomic data. Please check and confirm.
Authors' response: A protein with the same domain architecture is encoded by the genome of another Dictyostelium – D.
purpureum. This gene was omitted from analyses described in
the paper, because the sequence available at the moment is
incomplete, but we have made a note on it in the revised manuscript, so the authenticity of DdiCPRas2 is now beyond any
doubt.
- Too much is being made of Anand et al's. statement
about the existence of a single circularly permuted GTPase
family.
Authors' response: We follow the classical Popperian view on
how science works. Anand et al. elaborated a hypothesis
explaining why they had found only the G4-G5-G1-G2-G3 permutation of the GTPase domain (see also the expanded discussion on their claims incorporated into the revised manuscript
upon suggestion of the second reviewer). This hypothesis should
be taken seriously until evidence is found which would falsify it.
This is exactly what our paper does.
Circularly permuted proteins are observed across a wide
range of protein folds and its emergence is solely determined by natural selection. I suggest that, it be mentioned
earlier during the description of discovery of the circular
permutation.
Authors' response: We do not feel there is enough evidence
supporting the notion that the emergence of circularly permuted
proteins is solely determined by natural selection. We are rather
inclined to the view that most such rearrangements are removed
by negative selection and those that survive are mostly selectively neutral. However, it is true that circular permutations
occur widely, so we have inserted a note on this into the first
paragraph.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/21

- I don't see why pathogen defense needs to be invoked as
a specialized process in which the cpRAS is involved and
perhaps some elaboration is needed.
Authors' response: The reviewer may be right in that the speculation on the potential involvement of CPRas proteins in pathogen defence is unsubstantiated. We have deleted the respective
section from the revised manuscript and leave the possibilities
on the function of CPRas proteins completely open.
Other minor and editorial comments for the authors:
- In the description of the swap and the circular permutation, it should be clarified that the definitions are only for
the protein domain and not the whole protein (which
could have multiple domains)
Authors' response: There is probably some misunderstanding
here. The cited papers by the Unger's group [3,4]define the
terms „circular permutations" and „swap" with respect to full
proteins and make no reference to protein domains. We regard
such definitions impractical, because they obscure the fact that
domains are the actual basic units from which proteins are
built. Following these definitions, the relationship between
canonical GTPases (like HRAS) and CPRas proteins would be
called „swap" without the understanding that it is nothing more
than „circular permutations" of one particular domain (the
GTPases domain). That's why we explicitly explain (see the last
sentence of the first paragraph) that we apply the term „circular
permutation" to the level of protein domains.
-Last line of page 1:"..individual protein domains, regardless "of" the ..."
Authors' response: The grammatical error has been corrected.
- Shouldn't RAS be written as Ras?
Authors' response: There is little consensus in the literature
how the names of these GTPases should be written; all the forms
„RAS", „Ras", or „ras" have been used in various sources, often
with different meanings. We keep „RAS family" as a name for
a broader group of GTPases comprising multiple subgroups as
Ras, Rap, Rheb, CPRas etc. The name of the one specific representative of the family, the human HRAS, follows the standard
HUGO nomenclature of human genes/proteins.
- Page 3 last paragraph: Instead of opisthokont, use ichthyosporean as the latter is more precise.
Authors' response: We do not think that it is more precise to
treat Capsaspora owczarzaki as an ichthyosporean. It's true
that it is classified in Ichthyosporea in the NCBI taxonomic
scheme, but other authorities place the organism outside Ichthyosporea as a separate opisthokont lineage (e.g., Adl et al., J Euk

Page 6 of 8

Biology Direct 2008, 3:21

Microbiol 2005, 52: 399–451). We therefore keep the designation „unicellular opisthokont" in the revised text.
- Page 3. last paragraph: What is "global structure?", perhaps "domain architecture" is meant.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/21

With this regard I would change the first sentence of the
abstract to something like "A recent systematic survey
claimed (or suggested) that the YRG (or YawG/YlqF) family with the G4-G5-G1-G2-G3 order of the conserved
GTPase motifs represents the only possible circularly permuted variation of the canonical GTPase structure."

Authors' response: Yes, we meant domain architecture. This
expression is now used in the revised text, as it seems to be more
appropriate.

Authors' response: We have modified the first sentence of the
abstract following the reviewer's suggestion.

- Figure 2B. Revise according to the suggestions above.

- I don't see the point in Table S1. I think the descriptions
are clear enough.
Authors' response: The text and the Figure 1mention only the
whole eukaryotic clades for which evidence for the cpRAS
domain is missing. We believe that it is useful to specify the
actual species lacking the cpRAS domain, so we decided to
retain the Table S1.
Reviewer 2: Fyodor Kondrashov, Section on Ecology,
Behavior and Evolution, Division of Biological Sciences,
University of California at San Diego, USA
This manuscript presents straightforward evidence in support of new RAS-like (cpRAS) domain with a distinct
order of conserved GTPase motifs distinct from what has
been claimed as the only possible arrangement found in
YRG family of proteins. The manuscript also does a good
job with exploring the phylogenetic patterns of the cpRAS
domain and the possible functional implications. The
phyletic pattern, which apparently involves multiple
losses and horizontal gene transfers is intriguing,
although is not unique. It would be interesting to see
whether or not this domain could have evolved multiple
times independently, however, this possibility is unlikely
given that the circular permutation of the GTPase
domains seems very similar between different species.

Authors' response: We actually mention phylogenetic evidence
for a single origin of the cpRAS domain in the text.
It was not clear to me why the other authors decided that
the YGR arrangement of the GTPase motifs was the only
one possible. Perhaps a short discussion would be appropriate for the uninitiated readers.
Authors' response: We have added to the third paragraph two
sentences specifying the argument raised by Anand et al.
against the existence of permutations other than G4-G5-G1G2-G3.
