On origin of genetic code and tRNA before
translation
Andrei S Rodin1,2, Eörs Szathmáry2,3,4, Sergei N Rodin2,5*

Abstract
Background: Synthesis of proteins is based on the genetic code - a nearly universal assignment of codons to
amino acids (aas). A major challenge to the understanding of the origins of this assignment is the archetypal “keylock vs. frozen accident” dilemma. Here we re-examine this dilemma in light of 1) the fundamental veto on
“foresight evolution”, 2) modular structures of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and 3) the updated library of
aa-binding sites in RNA aptamers successfully selected in vitro for eight amino acids.
Results: The aa-binding sites of arginine, isoleucine and tyrosine contain both their cognate triplets, anticodons
and codons. We have noticed that these cases might be associated with palindrome-dinucleotides. For example,
one-base shift to the left brings arginine codons CGN, with CG at 1-2 positions, to the respective anticodons NCG,
with CG at 2-3 positions. Formally, the concomitant presence of codons and anticodons is also expected in the
reverse situation, with codons containing palindrome-dinucleotides at their 2-3 positions, and anticodons
exhibiting them at 1-2 positions. A closer analysis reveals that, surprisingly, RNA binding sites for Arg, Ile and Tyr
“prefer” (exactly as in the actual genetic code) the anticodon(2-3)/codon(1-2) tetramers to their anticodon(1-2)/
codon(2-3) counterparts, despite the seemingly perfect symmetry of the latter. However, since in vitro selection of
aa-specific RNA aptamers apparently had nothing to do with translation, this striking preference provides a new
strong support to the notion of the genetic code emerging before translation, in response to catalytic (and
possibly other) needs of ancient RNA life. Consistently with the pre-translation origin of the code, we propose here
a new model of tRNA origin by the gradual, Fibonacci process-like, elongation of a tRNA molecule from a
primordial coding triplet and 5’DCCA3’ quadruplet (D is a base-determinator) to the eventual 76 base-long
cloverleaf-shaped molecule.
Conclusion: Taken together, our findings necessarily imply that primordial tRNAs, tRNA aminoacylating ribozymes,
and (later) the translation machinery in general have been co-evolving to ‘’fit’’ the (likely already defined) genetic
code, rather than the opposite way around. Coding triplets in this primal pre-translational code were likely similar
to the anticodons, with second and third nucleotides being more important than the less specific first one. Later,
when the code was expanding in co-evolution with the translation apparatus, the importance of 2-3 nucleotides of
coding triplets “transferred” to the 1-2 nucleotides of their complements, thus distinguishing anticodons from
codons. This evolutionary primacy of anticodons in genetic coding makes the hypothesis of primal stereo-chemical
affinity between amino acids and cognate triplets, the hypothesis of coding coenzyme handles for amino acids,
the hypothesis of tRNA-like genomic 3’ tags suggesting that tRNAs originated in replication, and the hypothesis of
ancient ribozymes-mediated operational code of tRNA aminoacylation not mutually contradicting but rather coexisting in harmony.

Background
Genetic Code refers to a nearly universal assignment of
triplets (codons) of nucleotides (nts) to amino acids
(aas), linking hereditary entities to the functional blocks
of life (Figure 1A). In practice, this codon-to-aa assignment is realized through the agencies of 1) the code
adaptor molecules of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) with a
codon’s complementary replica (anticodon) and the corresponding aa attached to the 3’ end, and 2) aminoacyl
tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), the enzymes that actually
recognize and connect proper aa and tRNAs (Figure 1B
and 1C).
Unraveling the origin of the genetic code and translation machinery is an inherently difficult problem [1]. On
one hand, the system that unifies the nt and aa languages must necessarily be highly optimized. On the
other hand, the events shaping the genetic code took
place long time ago, and due to the relative compactness
of the extant genetic code, many alternative scenarios
for its origin are conceivable (and have been put
forward).
Furthermore, the very existence of the two languages
(with the code being a translational intermediary)
implies an evolutionary motivation. This is a great challenge to evolutionists, even at the most abstract conceptual level of reasoning. When seeking, for example, the
arguments for perhaps the most fateful transition in life
history - from ribozymes to enzymes [2] - we cannot
simply fall back on the truism that proteins are more
efficient and versatile catalysts than RNAs. Indeed, proteins constitute a final product in the long chain of reactions performed by the very complex coding and
translation machinery. The very complexity of the translation system inevitably suggests it has been shaped gradually ([3] see also [4-7]). However, the natural selection
works strictly “in the present moment”, right here and
right now, just like a first-aid ambulance [8] - lacking
the foresight of potential future advantages [2,7]. By
contrast, any advantage of proteins over ribozymes
could have materialized only in the very end of the ribozymes-mediated multi-step coding and translation processes. Therefore, just as with any case of step-by-step
evolution towards a more complex system, there should
be an evolutionary rationale behind each intermediate
step. As far as the coding and translation system is concerned, it would seem logical to start with separating
the two “origins” - origin of the code, and origin of
translation [9-11]. Moreover, because life never evolves
with foresight, we inevitably arrive to the hypothesis
that the code emerged before translation - in response
to the needs of the RNA world (ibid).
The detailed treatment of the pre-translational origin of
the genetic code is a whole separate topic that will be
reviewed elsewhere (Szathmáry and Rodin, in preparation).

In this report, we consolidate our arguments for the “pretranslational” code via a closer analysis of:
1. The fundamental veto on “foresight evolution”
2. The recently updated library of direct RNA-aa
binding sites — possibly pointing at the earliest
“(stereo chemical) era” in the history of the genetic
code [12], and
3. Some features of the genetic code per se (Figure
1A), as well as its adaptors (tRNAs) and implementers (aaRSs).

Results and discussion
Origin of the genetic code: the major question

Even before the final deciphering of the genetic code,
the two general ideas were already aboard with respect
to the code’s possible origin(s). The two are radically
different when it comes to the veto on “foresight evolution”. The first ("key-lock”) idea assumes some sort of
direct stereochemical affinity between amino acids and
oligonucleotides that are similar to, or just contain,
anticodons (or codons) [13-16]. Apparently, such an affinity does not depend on translation itself, and so life
might have used it for pre-translational coding regardless of potential foresight adaptations. This observation
leaves open the question of the immediate use of coding
without translation, however (see below for candidate
explanations).
This is clearly not the case with the other ("adaptor”)
idea, stipulating existence of intermediate molecular
agents capable of recognizing both an amino acid and a
corresponding codon in mRNAs simultaneously [17]. The
logical difficulty with this idea is that it does not really
address the issue of the code origin — it simply “passes
the buck” to the aforementioned adaptors. Now we know
that these adaptors are not in the least hypothetical —
they do exist, they are tRNAs (Figure 1C), and it is these
molecules in which one usually looks for the clues towards
elucidation of the code origin.
However, the anticodon and the site of aa attachment
are located on the opposite “poles” of the tRNA molecule
(Figure 1C); therefore, its self-aminoacylation seems very
unlikely. Not surprisingly, twenty aaRSs, one for each aa,
perform this (aminoacylation) function, thus actually
implementing the code. Furthermore, since aaRSs are
proteins, we are faced here with the proverbial “chickenor-egg” paradox that necessarily suggests that primordial
tRNAs have been aminoacylated by r-aaRSs, the ribozymic
iso-functional precursors of protein aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (p-aaRSs). These putative r-aaRSs have one
obvious advantage over p-aaRSs in distinguishing right
tRNAs from wrong ones - the easy and precise (through
complementary base pairing) recognition of anticodons.
This said, the r-aaRSs must have recognized the particular

Figure 1 The genetic code (adopted from [19,24,36,40]). A. The code table. Yellow and blue colors indicate the two modes of tRNA
recognition by aaRSs - from the minor and major groove sides of the acceptor stem, respectively [21,22]. The minor groove side of recognition
represents mostly the class I aaRSs, the major groove side, class II aaRSs. Stop codons are shown in yellow because the known cases of their
“capture” by amino acids are mostly from class I; AGG and AGA are assigned not to yellow Arg’s codons (as they usually are) but to blue Ser’s or
Gly’s codons (as they are in mitochondria) [68]. Lysine is colored in lighter shade of blue because some archaebacteria use class I synthetases for
this amino acid [92]. B. The condensed version of the code representation when complementary codons are put vis-á-vis each other. This
particular “yin-yang” version reveals otherwise invisible rules of the sub-code for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation described in [19,36]. These
rules when applied to the pairs of tRNAs with complementary anticodons flanked by 5’U and R3’ minimize a risk of their confusion by aaRSs.
Symbols: N and complementary И denote all four nucleotides, R purine (G or A), Y pyrimidine (C or U). For details see [19,36]. C. The twodimensional cloverleaf representation of a tRNA molecule (the E. coli tRNAAla with GGC anticodon is shown) [24]. The complementary halves are
colored yellow (5’ half) and blue (3’ half), in accordance with the sub-code for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation (B). Arrows show the two
sides from which the putative ribozymic precursors of class I and class II p-aaRSs recognized the proto-tRNAs.

amino acid, and it would seem logical to position the
recognition site as close as possible to the tRNA 3’ end (in
the r-aaRS-tRNA complexes). And so, the central problem
remains: a tRNA, in its turn, “passes the buck” to the coding-prone sites of aa-RNA interactions in r-aaRSs.
Furthermore, the r-aaRSs, in order to aminoacylate cognate tRNAs, would have required the catalysts of their
own, i.e., “meta-r-aaRSs”, which situation, in turn, would
inherit the same problem and require the catalysts of their
own, etc... ad infinitum [18-20].
Two important discoveries further exacerbate the problem. First, the p-aaRSs appear to be divided in two distinct classes, their structures having nothing in common
(on all, 1D, 2D and 3D, levels). However, they show
sterically mirror modes of tRNA recognition: from
minor and major groove sides of the acceptor stem
[21,22] (Figure 1A). Most likely, this complementarity in
tRNA recognition of class I and class II p-aaRSs reflects
structural complementarity of their genes — the complementarity that becomes obvious in the anti-parallel
(head-to-tail) alignment and, in turn, might point to
their sense-antisense (SAS) origin from complementary
strands of one and the same gene-ancestor [23,24].
Second, in parallel with these presumably ancient
SAS-based inter-gene relationships, both main agents of
the code, adaptors (tRNA) and “implementers” (p-aaRS)
demonstrate the apparent intra-gene modularity. More
specifically, for at least ten amino acids, tRNAs truncated to a small piece of the acceptor arm with the
CCA3’ end have been still able to be charged with a correct aa by cognate p-aaRS [25-27]. Inversely, complete
deletion of the anticodon-binding domain in p-aaRSs
did not deprive them of the ability to link tRNAs with
the anticodon-specific aa (ibid). This amazing anticodon-independent (but still correct) aminoacylation was
interpreted as evidence of there being a second (RNA
operational) code [26,28] embodied mainly in the first
three-four base pairs of the acceptor stem and the
unpaired base-determinator.
This operational code of tRNA aminoacylation might
have been older than the anticodon-mediated ability to
read codons in mRNAs [26], and it is certainly older
than the partition of aaRSs in two classes since ten
“anticodon-independent” amino acids are evenly represented between them: Val, Ile, Met, Tyr, Cys - class I
and Gly, Ala, Ser, Asp, His - class II. In fact, this necessarily implies that the operational code has been initially
implemented by the ribozymic precursors of aaRSs.
This, in turn, indirectly supports the hypothesis that the
classic genetic code (associated in tRNAs with the anticodon) might be a “frozen accident” [29]. At any rate, all
of the above does not eradicate the thesis that “at some
early stage in the evolution of life the direct association
of amino acids with polynucleotides, which was later to

Page 4 of 24

evolve into the genetic code, must have begun” [15].
Consistently, in aminoacylation of tRNAs, p-aaRSs first
recognize and select a particular amino acid, and only
after that the aa-specific tRNAs. Most likely, p-aaRSs
inherited this order of recognitions from r-aaRSs, along
with many other features [19,30].
The aa-binding sites of r-aaRSs might reflect this primary code. The fundamental question is: Does this
putative pre-translational code have anything in common with the actual genetic code used in translation?
This question, again, “passes the buck” back to the main
logical dilemma: whether the codon-to-aa assignment
(Figure 1A) evolved from the aa-binding sites of
r-aaRSs, or if it was, indeed, a frozen accident. The
in vitro selected aa-binding RNAs [12,31] might just
provide an answer.
RNA-amino acid binding sites: Asymmetry in frequency of
anticodons and codons suggests pre-translational origin
of the genetic code

By now, aa-binding RNA aptamers have been successfully “selexed” for eight amino acids. According to [12],
their aa-binding sites are of the three types:
- Sites in which cognate codon and anticodon are
both significantly over-represented, this group
including arginine, isoleucine and (borderline significant) tyrosine.
- Sites in which only cognate anticodons are found
in significant excess, this group including histidine,
phenylalanine and tryptophan.
- Sites in which neither anticodons nor codons significantly dominate, this group including glutamine
and presumably leucine.
Initially, it was thought that codons were overrepresented in such RNA aptamers, although inspection of the
sequences revealed that when there were codons, anticodons were also there almost invariably [10]. The updated
compilation [12] totals 337 RNA aptamers and yet,
remarkably, the group of “codons-only” sites remains
unpopulated. Looking for possible explanation, we have
noticed that in the first (codon + anticodon) group,
codons for Arg, Ile, and Tyr have a self-complementary
palindromic dinucleotide at 1-2 positions, namely: CGN
for Arg (N is U,C,A,G), AUU, AUC, and AUA for Ile, and
UAU and UAC for Tyr. Accordingly, the anticodons have
exactly the same dinucleotides, but at 2-3 positions,
namely: NCG for Arg (N are A,G,U,C), AAU, GAU, and
UAU for Ile, and AUA and GUA for Tyr. Therefore it is
hardly surprising that, for example, inside the Arg-binding
site one base-left shift to its codon CGN would necessarily
bring us to its anticodon NCG. And, the opposite way
around: presence of a NCG anticodon predetermines

finding a CGN codon one-base shifted to the right (Figure
2). Thus, in this group of aa-binding sites, codons might
simply accompany anticodons, or vice versa.
To find out which of the two, anticodon or codon,
was actually involved in selection of independent aabinding RNAs, we first noticed that, formally speaking,
the concomitant presence of codons and anticodons is
also expected in the reverse situation, when codons contain a palindrome-dinucleotide at their 2-3 positions,
whereas anticodons exhibit them at 1-2 positions, i.e. as
if the codons and anticodons switched their places. Figure 2 shows an example: His codon CAU and anticodon
AUG.
Before we move further, we will denote these two cases
of palindromic dinucleotide-containing coding motifs as
codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) and codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2),
or, for simplicity, (1-2)/(2-3) and (2-3)/(1-2), respectively.
Combination of both of these cases is also possible (see, for
example, CGCG tetraplet in Figure 2).
In the complete code (Figure 1A), a number of codons
with any such palindrome at 1-2 positions is equal to
that with the same palindrome at 2-3 positions. One
would then think that these two perfectly symmetrical
cases, (1-2)/(2-3) and (2-3)/(1-2), should have equal
chance to be found in aa-binding sites of selexed RNA
aptamers. Indeed, there are no reasons whatsoever for
the a priori belief that the procedure of RNA aptamers
selection per se — the selection focused on stereo-specific binding of amino acids to particular RNA sequences
— has anything to do with translation (hence, by the

way, the wobbling interface between codon and anticodon at their 3rd and 1st nts, charging tRNAs with cognate amino acids by p-aaRSs, etc.)
However, Table 1 in [12] unambiguously shows that
the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) cases, but not their
codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) “counterparts”, are overrepresented at significant level in Arg-, Ile- and (with
borderline significance) Tyr-binding sites. A closer
inspection of aa-binding RNA aptamer sequences for
these amino acids uncovered a number of fascinating
details. As the control data, we used His- and Leu-binding RNAs, because their codons contain (just at (2-3)
positions), the AU and UA palindromes: CAU (His) and
UUA, CUA (Leu).
Arginine

In the set of 34 Arg-binding sites, NCG anticodons predominate, often together with overlapping CGN codons;
the most frequent motifs being 5’-UCGA-3’, 5’-UCGC-3’
and 5’-GCGG-3’. Importantly, these three are all of the
codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) type.
The motif 5’-CGCG-3’ is of a special interest (Figure 2),
because one can see it in two ways: CGC is a codon(1-2)
for CG palindrome and, simultaneously, it is also a codon
(2-3) for GC palindrome. The overlapping GCG anticodon, in its turn, can be considered as the (2-3) or (1-2)
one for CG and GC, respectively. This ambiguity is
fraught with confusion for coding. Very telling, therefore,
is the fact that Arg-binding sites do not contain the
5’-CGCG-3’ motif at all, in contrast to the above three
motifs of the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) type. This fact

Figure 2 The palindrome dinucleotide-based overlapping of codons and anticodons expected in aa-binding sites of RNA aptamers.
Shown on the left is the CG-based similarity of arginine codons (CGN) and anticodons (NCG). Self-complementarity of the CG dinucleotide
increases probability of finding codon in an Arg-binding site, if anticodon is already there, and vice versa. The same is the case for four other
amino acids that have palindromic dinucleotide-containing codons: AUN (Ile, Met), UAY (Tyr), GCN (Ala). Shown in the middle is a particular
codon of arginine, CGC, which, being CG palindrome-containing at 1-2 positions, is simultaneously GC palindrome-containing at 2-3 positions.
Accordingly, if the next nt is G, one gets the anticodon with the same palindrome GC at 1-2 positions. Thus, one and the same tetraplet, CGCG,
appears as a codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) for palindrome CG, and simultaneously as a codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) for palindrome GC. In contrast,
histidine’s codon CAU (shown on the right) has AU palindrome at 2-3 positions only, hence its anticodon (AUG) appears with the same AU at
1-2 positions.

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

becomes even more telling if we take in account presence
of 5’-CGCG-3’ beyond aa-binding sites ([12]: see, in the
Arg list, cases 17, F2e, F2f, and F2U).
Overall, anticodon UCG significantly outnumbers CGN
codons, suggesting that codons might simply follow
anticodons (like hitch hikers) rather than vice versa. The
only exception is codon AGG (see [12]). However,
among the 34 sites, there is not a single one in which
AGG appears as itself, without concomitant NCG and/or
CGN cognate triplets. Moreover, in the latest compilation set of 127 newly isolated smallest Arg-binding sites
[31], the only significantly over-represented triplet is the
AGG’s complement, arginine’s anticodon CCU. Thus,
when for the same amino acid, arginine, we find in its
RNA-binding sites a cognate, but not-CG-containing,
triplet, it appears to be the anticodon, not codon.
Isoleucine

The available set of Ile-binding RNA aptamers is the
most populous one: 185 sequences. Ile’s three codons
have a palindrome, AU, at 1-2 positions, and one of
these three, AUA, also has another palindrome, UA, at
2-3 positions.
Figure 3 shows the tetraplets which are supposed to
occur in Ile-binding sites if one of its coding triplets,
either AUU, AUC, AUA (codons) or AAU, GAU, UAU
(anticodons) is already there. Out of this extensive
repertoire, only one (5’-UAUU-3’) tetraplet does occur
(and in obvious excess) in numerous independently
selected Ile-binding sites. Note that this motif belongs
to the (1-2)/(2-3) group. The symmetry of (2-3)/(1-3)
motifs suggests competitive presence of the 5’-AUAU-3’
tetraplet, in which AUA can be considered as the Ile’s
codon(2-3), and the overlapping UAU as the Ile’s anticodon(1-2), respectively. However, the whole set of 185
Ile-binding RNA sites (2508 nts in total) does not contain even a single 5’-AUAU-3’. In contrast, beyond the
sites (9915 nts), we can see 28 such tetraplets, one per
354 nts, on average. Proportionally, by chance alone,
one would expect to find seven tetraplets 5’-AUAU-3’ in
Ile-binding sites. Its complete absence may hint at the
selection acting against it. A strong independent evidence for such selection comes from Tyr-binding sites.
Tyrosine

One of tyrosine’s codons, UAU, is a (precise) complementary partner of isoleucine’s AUA. Only three Tyrbinding RNA aptamers are available [12]. However,
these three display exactly the same pattern, as do much
more representative Arg- and Ile-binding ones: the significant excess of 5’-AUAC-3’ tetraplet, which consists
of tyrosine anticodon AUA overlapping with codon
UAC. This is, again, a motif of the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) type. The seemingly equivalent 5’-UAUA-3’ of
the codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) type is not to be found in
Tyr-binding aptamers.

Page 6 of 24

It should be emphasized that the 5’-AUAC-3’, and its
closest homolog 5’-AUAU-3’, are the very motifs that
belong to the codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) group for isoleucine. However, neither is located in the Ile-binding
sites (see Figure 3). Instead (and this is highly unlikely
to be just a coincidence), we find the 5’-AUAC-3’ precisely where the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) “rule” predicts: in binding sites of the Ile’s complementarily
encoded partner — Tyr. It would be hard to find a
more convincing argument for the preference of (1-2)/
(2-3) tetraplets over seemingly symmetric (2-3)/(1-2) in
aa-binding sites of selexed RNAs.
Histidine

This amino acid shows an excess of its GUG (highly significant) and AUG (borderline significant) anticodons in aabinding sites of selexed RNA aptamers [12]. What makes
histidine important for our analysis is the fact that one of
its codons, CAU, happens to be of the (2-3) type, the
anticodon AUG being, complementarily, of the (1-2) type.
Therefore, were the (1-2)/(2-3) and (2-3)/(1-2) motifs had
had equal chances to be selected in aa-specific RNA aptamers, the His’s (2-3)/(1-2) motif 5’-CAUG-3’ would be
found in significant excess within the His-specific binding
sites. However, among such sites (54 independently
selexed RNAs) we do not see even a single 5’-CAUG-3’ —
the absence being all the more telling if one takes into
account the fact that this tetraplet is quite common
outside of the His-binding sites.
Leucine

According to Yarus et al. [12], concentration of cognate
triplets in the aa-binding sites of the independently
recovered (15 times) Leu-specific RNA is not significant.
Yet, it is the Leu’s CUA codon(2-3), which is represented by its UAG anticodon(1-2) (with borderline significance); and again, exactly as with His’s CAU codon
(see above), one observes the corresponding (2-3)/(1-2)
tetraplet 5’-CUAG-3’ outside, but not within, the Leubinding site (ibid).
In summary, we point out that:
1) Anticodons, not codons, are more often significantly over-represented in aa-binding sites of the
RNA aptamers.
2) For amino acids encoded by dinucleotide-palindrome-containing triplets, their binding sites in RNA
aptamers “prefer” the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3)
motifs over the codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) ones in
spite of their seemingly perfect symmetry.
These striking preferences mean that the 3 rd nt is
more important than 1st nt in anticodons (complementarily, the reverse being the case with codons), precisely
as in the real genetic code (Figure 1A). However, since
selection of aa-specific RNA aptamers apparently had

Figure 3 All conceivable tetraplets which are supposed to occur in Ile-binding sites if one of its coding triplets, either AUU, AUC, AUA
(Ile codons) or AAU, GAU, UAU (Ile anticodons) is already there. These tetraplets consist of codon and anticodon overlapping at the
palindrome-dinucleotide. Marked by asterisk are tetraplets in which codon or anticodon represents a different (not Ile) amino acid. A. The
tetraplets expected for palindrome AU at codons’ 1-2 positions and anticodons 2-3 positions, respectively. Shown boxed is the tetraplet 5’UAUU-3’ which one can actually see in all Ile-binding sites of independently selexed RNA aptamers (184 of 185 cases). Remarkably, this highly
conserved motif constitutes the Ile-specific internal loop that seems to be directly involved in function [93]. B. The tetraplets expected for
palindrome UA at codon 2-3 positions and anticodon 1-2 positions. Shown in oval is the ile-specific tetraplet 5’-AUAU-3’ which one would
expect to observe if the UA palindrome in overlapping anticodon UAU and codon AUA was favored by selection of RNA aptamers specifically
binding Ile. Remarkably, in contrast to ubiquitous 5’-UAUU-3’ in the group A (codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) tetraplets), none of Ile-binding sites
contains the motif 5’-AUAU-3’ in seemingly symmetric group B (codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) tetraplets).

nothing to do with translation, it would be more correct
to say that in the interface between interacting aas and
cognate triplets, the 2-3 nucleotides contribute more to
the specificity of interaction, thus determining their
future usage as an anticodon. Furthermore, selection of
aa-specific RNA aptamers had nothing to do with the
translation machinery (in contrast to primary coding). If
so, the revealed strong bias towards anticodon’s 2-3
(and, complementarily, codon’s 1-2) palindromes has
been established very early, before translation, i.e., before
the codon-anticodon interaction in tRNA-mRNA complexes. Consequently, not only the translation machinery
itself, but its coding toolkit, the code-adapting molecules
(tRNA) and aaRSs (initially, advanced ribozymes, then
minimalist primitive enzymes) have been evolving to
‘’fit’’ the probably already basically outlined genetic code
(as opposed to the code co-evolving with tRNAs and
aaRSs to “fit” translation by minimizing translation
errors).
Does this translation-independent preference of (1-2)/
(2-3) over (2-3)/(1-2) triplets suggest some fundamental
left-right, chirality-like, asymmetry, and if it does, could
this asymmetry determine the salient features of coding
and translation? Our (guarded) answer is Yes. However,
the code’s primordial adaptors (tRNAs) and implementers (r-aaRSs) could have simply used the preexisting aatriplets’ affinities in the way that minimized errors of
aminoacylation. That is, the original aa-triplet preferences within the aa-binding sites of RNA catalysts determined the primal pre-translational genetic code with
more important 2 nd and 3 rd nts, whereas 1 st nt was
much less specific. Later, when the code was expanding
in co-evolution with the translation apparatus, the
importance of 2-3 nts of coding triplets “passed” on 1-2
nts of their complements thus distinguishing anticodons
from codons. The fact that codon’s 3 rd nt is more
degenerated than the anticodon’s 1st nt actually serves
as an indirect evidence of in support of this order of
events.
Imprints of the pre-translational code in tRNAs: One
ancestor for two codes

If the code did have a pre-translational origin, one would
look for its imprints in the code adaptors, tRNAs. The
very structure of tRNAs is quite interesting in this regard.
Indeed, anticodons are directly involved in “reading”
mRNAs via recognition of complementary codons, but
the anticodon-to-aa association (the code per se) is indirect, provided solely by the physical linkage of the aminoacylation and codon-reading sites within a tRNA
molecule. This is a crucial point on which, among other
things, the idea of frozen accident [29] hinges upon, and
the anticodon-free charging of many tRNAs with cognate
aas, i.e. the operational code of tRNA aminoacylation,

Page 8 of 24

might still reflect this ancient fortuity [26]. At the same
time, new data on riboswitches in general [32], recent
discovery that in the ribosome the anticodons are selectively enriched just in proximity to their amino acids
[33], an excess of the aa-respective anticodons just in the
aa-binding sites of in vitro “selexed” RNA aptamers [12],
and our own study of these sites (see above) revealing the
striking bias of triplets with dinucleotide palindromes at
2-3 positions towards the real anticodon-to aa assignment - all these facts suggest that the hypothetical
ancient pre-translational code and the real pro-translational code are in fact one and the same code.
Furthermore, the pre-translational stereo-chemical
hypothesis for the code origin [12,16] and the hypothesis of the ancient operational code preceding the canonical one [26] do not contradict but might, in fact,
strengthen each other if the acceptor arm is older than
the anticodon arm, but both have a common ancestor.
It seems reasonable to suppose that hypothetical
r-aaRSs recognized proto-tRNAs by complementary
base pairing. This means that they looked like tRNA
complements additionally endowed with the aa-specific
aminoacylating activity [34]. Accordingly, not just
tRNAs but rather pairs of tRNAs with complementary
anticodons could still retain the imprints of the code’s
earliest (pre-translation) history. Our three previous
findings support this statement:
1) Pairs of tRNAs with complementary anticodons
turn out to be complementary at the 2nd base of the
acceptor stem as well [20,35]. To the best of our
knowledge, this concerted dual complementarity
remains the only evidence (however indirect) for the
anticodon and first three bases of the acceptor stem
possibly having a common ancestor.
2) Two sterically mirror modes of tRNA aminoacylation might have prevented ancestral tRNAs with
complementary anticodons from (otherwise highly
probable) confusion [19,36]. The “rules” that determine which pairs of complementary anticodon loops
should be recognized from the same, and which
ones from the opposite, sides in order to avoid their
confusion (Figure 1B) seem to have been implemented very early, most likely by ribozymic precursors of
the two enzymes (ibid).
3) However, structurally simplest, presumably earliest and complementarily encoded amino acids such
as Gly and Ala seem to never had any risk of their
tRNAs confusion depending on the anticodon loop,
no matter whether the putative r-aaRSs recognized
the two complementary halves of tRNAs (Figure 1C)
from the same or opposite sites [20]. The high risk
of confusion did take place for proto-tRNAs of such
amino acids, but for recognition of their acceptor

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

arms, not anticodons, the acceptor’s second base pair
playing the crucial role in this (ibid).
Figure 4 reveals a possible reason. It shows a common
ancestor of acceptor arms, reconstructed from the phylogenetic trees of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya. The
acceptor’s 5’ strand consists of a triplet that might represent, according to the dual complementarity, a protoanticodon and a quadruplet GCCR that is homologous to
the universal DCCA 3’ tail. Consequently, the 3’ strand of
the acceptor emerges as a short palindrome (11 nts) with
a codon-like triplet in the middle. It is easy to see that in
order to avoid confusion between two acceptor stems
with complementary second bases (as it is in the case of
Gly and Ala), the aminoacylating ribozymes must use the
same groove side; otherwise, they would actually encounter identical targets of recognition. Of two such variants,
the 3’ × 3’ (blue × blue) looks more advantageous than
the 5’ × 5’ (yellow × yellow) due to the unpaired DCCA3’ tail. And it is this variant which has been really chosen
despite the fact that within the anticodon loop three
other variants (5’ × 5’, 5’ × 3’ and 3’ × 5’) were equally
error-proof (see [20] for detail).
Worthy of note, alanine is one of five amino acid
encoded by the palindromic dinucleotide-containing triplets at 1-2 positions, GCN. It would be quite interesting, therefore, to test ala-binding sites of RNA aptamers
on the (1-2)/(2-3) over (2-3)/(1-2) preference. However,
alanine, as well as its complementary partner glycine
and all other blue × blue pairs of “Miller’s” amino acids
(Pro, Thr, Ser), are absent in the library of aa-binding
RNA aptamers [12]. Insensitivity of their tRNA recognition modes to anticodon loops and, on the contrary, a
strong association of the confusion risk with the acceptor arm (Figure 4) may turn out to be very meaningful
in this connection.
Origin of tRNA: From a proto-anticodon and a 5’-DCCA-3’
to a cloverleaf

Pre-translational origin of aa-specific anticodons is consistent with our model of tRNA growth (Figure 5). We
have noticed that the two coding units, a triplet (presumable proto-anticodon) and DCCA (presumable tag
of replication with a coding base-determinator D) would
eventually generate the 76 nt-long cloverleaf if we will
use them as building bricks in the Fibonacci-like iterative process. Literally: 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 7 = 11, 7 + 11 =
18, 11 + 18 = 29, 18 + 29 = 47, and finally 29 + 47 = 76!
This algorithm produces the cloverleaf with periodically
repeated ACCR and YGGU motifs and many of the conservative and largely conservative bases, such as 5’-URG-3’
at 8-10 positions, the anticodon flanking 3’-U and R-5’
bases, the 3’-C of the V-loop which is homologous to the
nearly invariant 3’-C at the 72nd position (see also: [20,35]).

Page 9 of 24

Importantly, in order to arrive at a final “perfect” cloverleaf, one should, in each step “i” of the elongation
process (i = 1, 2,...,6), add to the (i-1)th member not just
the preceding (i-2)th one, but its complementary image.
This actually implies that during the code development
the repertoire of aa-specific triplets has been increasing
not one by one but rather by complementary pairs, in
accord with numerous independent arguments
[18-20,23,24,34-43]. This also implies a self-priming and
self-templating, mechanism of elongation (Figure 5). As
a consequence, the 76-nt long cloverleaf would have
internal sequence periodicity — the hallmark of tRNAs
reported long ago ([44], see also [35]).
The 11 nt-long precursor is a palindrome, which may
serve a template for its perfectly symmetric partner with
a complementary triplet in the center (Figure 5; step 2).
Two other structures, the 29 nt-long hairpin (step 4),
and the eventual cloverleaf (step 6), also show such
complementary symmetry (although less perfect) with
the anticodon mapped right in the middle. (By the way,
the final cloverleaf and its 47 nt-long precursor can be
both represented as a long hairpin, with a few small
bulges, as well (not shown).) Indirectly, this symmetry
also supports the hypothesis that new amino acids
entered translation by complementarily encoded pairs
([37], see also [20,35,38,39]).
The following aspects of the model are worthy of special comments:
First, tRNAs could participate in translation before
they have “reached” the complete cloverleaf. The 29
nt-long hairpin with overlapping acceptor and anticodon domains is an obvious candidate to be such a precursor for code adaptors. tRNA is perhaps the most
important molecule of life, bridging RNA and (RNA +
Proteins) worlds. As Figure 6 symbolically shows, the
two worlds are literally as close as it possibly gets in
this hairpin: the late RNA world with the operational
code actually joins the early (RNA + Proteins) world
with the classic code. In principle, the 18-nt long
acceptor arm also assumes two alternative versions of
combining the 11- and 7-nt long precursors usable in
translation (Figure 7B) or even earlier - in replication
(Figure 7C) with the ribosome functioning as an RNA
replisome and tRNAs loaded with trinucleotides (not
amino acids) and donating them to growing complementary RNA molecules ([45], see [4,5,46,47] for more
comprehensive treatment).
Second, if the primordial operational code of aminoacylation involved many amino acids, the question arises
how their short proto-tRNAs could evolve in unison,
towards the same final shape [35]. The origin of tRNAs
might have been non-monophyletic, indeed [48] — thus
making the above question critical for any model of the
tRNA origin from a smaller precursor. The process of

“prohibited” 5’ × 3’ (blue × yellow) one (adopted from [20]).

Fibonacci-like elongation is quite specific in this regard:
starting from the 5’DCCA3’ quadruplet and different
(including complementary) coding triplets, it brings
them all to the universal 76 nt-long cloverleaf. Of
course, any elongation that took place with a single

proto-tRNA could then be spread across the whole
repertoire of already existing code adaptors by a variety
of mechanisms (see [49] for review), but the Fibonaccilike elongation obviously makes such “coincidental coevolution” [50] much easier.

final cloverleaf-shaped molecule (see also [20]and [35]).

Third, our model (Figure 5) may seem incompatible
with the Di Giulio model (Figure 8A), in which tRNAs
originated from a hairpin with a proto-anticodon in the
3’ strand preceding the unpaired DCCA tail. Two such
hairpins make a cloverleaf if one is shifted along the
other with formation of the unpaired anticodon loop

(and, as a consequence, V loop) as shown in Figure 8A
[51,52]. In this simple and generally elegant model, the
anticodon precursor is positioned in the same place as
in our model — adjacently to the 5’DCCA3’. However,
in the Di Giulio model, the anticodon and its putative
acceptor’s precursor are supposed to be identical

whereas in our model they are complementary to each
other. Note that in consensus and ancestral tRNAs, at
the purine/pyrimidine (R/Y) resolution, second bases of
anticodon and its presumable precursor in the acceptor
are much more often complementary rather than identical [20,35]. Moreover, for the amino acids which (in the
majority of origin scenarios) are supposed to be the very
first ones recruited by emerging code and translation,
i.e. Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Glu, their tRNAs all have complementary second bases in the anticodon and 3’ strand of
the acceptor stem. The same is the case for two tetrads,
[Ala (GGC), Gly (GCC), Val (GAC), Asp (GUC)] and
[Ala (CGC), Arg (GCG), Val(CAC), His (GUG)], which
might have formed the complementary core of the
genetic code (see [18,19,40] for details). And, in convincing contrast, the tRNAs which are consistent with the
“dimerization” model (Figure 8A), all represent relatively
“late” amino acids: Leu, Gln, Trp, Phe and Cys.
Yet, a closer analysis of the “dimerization” model (Figure 8A) reveals its similarity with the model proposed
here (Figure 5). Indeed, Figure 8B clearly shows how
shifting of the 3’ half of one hairpin forms the anticodon
loop and, consequently, V-loop, but necessarily implies
preexistence of the anticodon duplicate (plus UG-3’)
intended to complement the codon triplet (plus 5’-CA)
on the 5’ half of the opposite hairpin. Symmetrically,
this anticodon duplicate in turn suggests preexistence of

the codon duplicate in the original hairpin, etc., - in all,
we get eight coding triplets, four anticodons and four
codons, each with adjacent UG or CA dinucleotide,
respectively - precisely as in our model (Figure 5). It
thus turns out that “simple” dimerization of two identical hairpins with anticodon/codon-like pair at the basis
generates the tRNA cloverleaf with the unpaired anticodon in the center if and only if the hairpin itself originated by complementary duplications of shorter
precursors. Actually, it is the self priming and self templating model of tRNA growth [44] that is at work here,
and our model (Figure 5) is its Fibonacci process-based
version (see also the close variant in [20]). Among other
similar versions (not shown), we would like to mention
here the simple series of six duplications of the original
palindrome (of alternate complementarity) producing
the final 73 nt-long cloverleaf (11 × 7 less the 5’ terminal dGGU tetraplet) and the model of three duplications of the acceptor arm with the additional base “d”
on the 5’ strand, which is complementary to the basedeterminator “D” on the 3’ strand. In this (19 × 4 = 76)
model, the intermediate (19 × 2 = 38) state is in fact
equivalent to the primordial tRNA hairpin in the Di
Giulio’s model (Figure 8A). The (19 × 4 = 76) model
suggests also that ancestral tRNAs might have had in
the acceptor arm a complementary intron preceding the
“d” and, indeed, the majority of tRNAs of histidine do

contain such complementary base-determinator. (Interestingly, His is the amino acid of highest catalytic
propensity [11].)
Fourth, in addition to the typical 37/38-positioned
intron in tRNA genes [53-56], the recent in silico genome-wide search for tRNAs in some archaebacteria and
eukaryotes unexpectedly discovered the great diversity
of disrupted tRNA genes (reviewed in [57]). The collection of encoded-in-pieces tRNAs with an intron at
37/38 site is enriched by the genes with a single intron
at non-canonical positions [58,59], the genes with multiple introns [60], the split genes that separately encode
the 5’ and 3’ halves of tRNAs [61-63], the tri-split tRNA

gene precedents [64,65], and permuted tRNA genes, in
which the sequence coding for 3’ half precedes that for
the 5’ half [66,67].
This impressive diversity is precisely what any model
of gradual tRNA elongation predicts (e.g. Figure 5)
because the anticodon-flanking bases come actually
from the primordial palindrome (Figure 4) as homologs
of the base-determinator “D” and its complement “d”. It
does not mean, of course, that the entirety of the tRNA
splitting diversity that we observe today directly descends from the corresponding intermediate stages of
tRNA growth; certain present-day disrupted tRNA variants might well be the “analogs” rather than the

homologs of the putative tRNA precursors - analogs
that readily emerge simply due to the revealed multiple
modularity of a tRNA molecule. The “homology vs. analogy” uncertainty here is similar to that encountered
with the origin of deviant codes (see [68] for review);

while the phylogeny tells us that they must be late
deviations, we do know that there must have been such
codon-to-aa variations during the origin of the universal
genetic code as well. And yet, it has not escaped our
attention that, most frequently, D is A, d is U, and it is

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

again the invariant A (sometimes G) and U that flank
the anticodon from the 3’ and 5’ sides, respectively.
There is a certain rationale behind the fact that the
major site of introns, splits on minigenes and processing
in permuted tRNA genes is located between the 37 th
and 38th nts. It is this position that is consistent with
the sub-code for two modes of tRNA aminoacylation
(from major and minor groove sides) - the sub-code
that minimizes the risk of confusion for pairs of tRNAs
with complementary anticodons [19,36], especially if we
put the putative aminoacylating ribozymes in introns, in
proximity to the 37th base [9,10,69]. Furthermore, the
sub-code might have already worked in shorter precursors such as the 29-nt long proto-tRNAs with the presumable site of intron also mapped right in the middle
(between 15th and 16th nts), or even 11-mer precursors,
right after the base-determinator D.
According to Di Giulio [48,52,70], the most frequent
intron position right in the middle (37/38) of a tRNA
molecule reflects its origin by hairpin dimerization (Figure 8A). In contrast, as far as other flexible sites of
tRNA disruption are concerned, Di Giulio [71] explains
away all such cases after Randau & Söll [61-63,72] - due
to gained protection against integrative mobile elements.
However, the “main” and “peripheral” introns are processed uniformly, and they are undistinguishable in
everything but location. Therefore, like Randau and Söll
[73], we do not find these two explanations readily compatible. At the same time, the purely “protectionist”
hypothesis of Randau and Söll does not appear to be
entirely convincing, either (see [71]).
There is, however, no need for any ad hoc explanations
of the sort if we accept the models of multi-step selfprimed and self-templated elongation of tRNAs. For
example, in our model (Figure 5), the 37th base has a series
of precursors starting from the base-determinator D in the
original heptamer and 11-mer palindrome. Remarkably,
the additional sites of tRNA disruptions are often mapped
right next to, or one-two bases shifted from, the “D” and
its complementary “d” bases, following or preceding them,
respectively. Thus, our model (Figure 5) uniformly completes the evolutionary interpretation of all tRNAs-inpieces: not only the 37/38-positioned hot spot of tRNA
splits but also the majority of “warm” and “cold” spots
might reflect the deep evolutionary past of tRNAs marking
crucial steps in their development from a coding triplet
and DCCA up to a final cloverleaf. In our model, the 37/
38 position of intact tRNAs is identical to similar positions
of shorter precursors (like the 15/16 position in the 29base long proto-tRNA) as if it “inherited” all previous
stages of tRNAs elongation thus, accordingly, becoming
the major site of possible disruptions.
However, in our opinion, neither the interpretation
limited to the 37/38 site, nor its extension to all other

Page 15 of 24

disruption sites in our model are incompatible with the
Randau’s and Söll’s “anti-parasitic” explanation. After all,
consistently with the “homology vs. analogy” proviso, we
do not see why the preferable targets of intron (or
mobile element) insertions could not coincide with the
junction sites in the step-by-step growing tRNAs rather, this is where one would expect to find them,
right at the “critical points of growth”.

Conclusions
Recently, we have pointed out that probably long before the
origin of translation the genetic code had already fixed such
a fundamental (and, one would think, translation-ineradicable) feature as the tripletness of coding words [20,24]. The
present analysis of aa-binding sites in selexed RNA
aptamers allows us to make an even stronger conclusion:
the degeneracy of 1st position in anticodons (3rd position in
“future” codons) also appears to have originated before
translation.
This conclusion questions many dogmas of the code
and translation origins, including the almost commonly
shared view that the code shaping was driven by minimization of translation errors and, in general, the code
structure reflects its coevolution with tRNAs and aaRSs.
Not completely denying such translation-motivated coevolution, we would like to accentuate the reverse causality. The very logic of tRNA evolution from a short
ancestor to the eventual functionally sophisticated cloverleaf-like molecules might have been dictated by the
“RNA-aa binding: a stereochemical era for the genetic
code” [12]. Consistent with this are our model in which
the coding triplet and DCCA 3’ end for aminoacylation
are present from the very beginning (Figure 5) and previous findings: the dual complementarity [18,20,35] as
an indirect evidence of ancestral anticodon duplication
[51,74,75], and the subcode for two modes of tRNA
recognition by hypothetical aminoacylating ribozymes
(Figure 1B) [19,36]. Apparently, the sub-code for two
modes of RNA aminoacylation could be implemented
for primordial 11 nts-long palindromes, i.e. extremely
early - in response to increasing catalytic and other
challenges of the RNA world.
The bias to codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) tetraplets in
aa-binding sites of RNA aptamers may point to a fundamental interlink between the primordial RNA operational
code (hence the genetic code itself) and a chiral selection
of its components. Indeed, in model ribooligonucleotidesassisted aminoacylation of RNA minihelices, selection of
L-amino acids was determined by a pre-selected D-ribose
[76-78]. With a fascinating mirror symmetry, the artificial
L-ribose-based RNA system exhibits the clear opposite
preference of D-amino acids (ibid). One would then
enquire: What if the chiral-mirror RNA world with Lribose and D-amino acids is just the codon(2-3)/anticodon

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

(1-2) biased? The mirror selexed RNA aptamers could
provide an answer.
It should be noted that, in principle, the hypothesis of
pre-translational origin of the genetic code is consistent
with the hypothesis of its shaping in coevolution with
amino acids biosynthesis proposed in [79,80] and
extended in [81]. Indeed, if the advanced RNA life did
have widely used amino acids (for example as cofactors
of ribozymes [9-11]), then it seems reasonable to assume
that to some extent the earliest shaping of the genetic
code in general, and the order of entering of amino
acids into coding in particular, could recapitulate their
biosynthetic pathways.
The stereochemical affinity between aa and the anticodon-containing aa-binding sites in selexed RNAs does
not preclude, of course, further optimization of codonto-aa assignment. Very telling in this regard is the sparseness of triplet usage in aa-binding sites [12]: usually
for each aa there is only one significantly preferable
anticodon (e.g. see Figure 3). Consistently, for most of
amino acids the number of anticodons is less than that
of codons. This fact points, yet again, to primacy of
anticodons, and not codons, in the genetic code origin.
Obviously, the repertoire of codons was filled out later,
perhaps together with minimization of translation errors
in synthesis of very first proteins, such as heat shock
proteins, “RNA chaperones” [4,5] and proto-aaRS
enzymes ([18-20,22,24,82-86], however, see [7]). And
yet, the current analysis shows that the core of the
genetic code might have emerged much earlier, certainly
before translation.
We propose here a new model of stepwise, Fibonacci
process-like elongation of a tRNA molecule from just
two (triplet and quadruplet) motifs to a 76 nt-long cloverleaf (Figure 5). Importantly, the earliest part of the
molecule, the acceptor arm, already contains the primordial anticodon/codon pair. This means that the two
concepts - the pre-translational code and the more
ancient operational code of tRNA aminoacylation preceding the classic code for reading mRNAs - may tell
actually one and the same story, rather than two different ones. Accordingly, we repeatedly emphasize that the
hypothesis of primal stereo-chemical affinity between
aas and anticodons (or codons) [12,16], the hypothesis
of coding coenzyme handles for amino acids [9,10], the
hypothesis of tRNA-like genomic 3’ tags suggesting that
tRNAs originated in replication [87-89], the hypothesis
of the proto-ribosome having served originally a role in
RNA replication with the help of primordial tRNA
molecules delivering trinucleotides [4,5,45-47] - all four
evidently pre-translational - and the hypothesis of the
ancient RNA operational code, most likely ribozymesmediated and pre-translational as well [26], do not contradict but, on the contrary, strongly support each other.

Page 16 of 24

To conclude, our retrospective analysis of aa-binding
sites in RNA aptamers and the “proto-anticodon ®
cloverleaf” model of tRNA growth add to the fundamental premise: Translation without code does not make
sense, but code without (and before) translation does.

Methods
The common ancestor of acceptor arms (Figure 4) was
reconstructed from the phylogenetic trees of Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya as detailed in [20]. A combination
of manual sequence alignment, Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree reconstruction method with Tamura-Nei
distances and manual Parsimony-based ancestral state
reconstruction was used.
The selected amino acid binding sites, comprising 337
independently derived sequences (18,551 nucleotides in
total) directed at eight amino acids, are described in
[12]. The curated sequence libraries are available directly
from Yarus et al [12].
The statistical significance of over- or under-representation of anticodon/codon triplets was ascertained using
chi-square or similar (G-test, exact binomial) two-sided
statistical tests.

Reviewer Comments

This manuscript addresses arguably the most fundamental and most difficult problem in the study of the origin
of cells: the steps leading to the emergence of the translation system. Any informed discussion of this fundamental enigma is of interest, and this is particularly true
of this exceptionally well written and thoroughly referenced manuscript. I find it equally evident that the decisive breakthrough remains elusive, and even the
direction in which one should proceed to find it is less
than obvious. So does this analysis take us a step closer
to a (the) solution?
In their discussion, Rodin et al. proceed from the
unassailable conclusion that p-aaRS must have been preceded by r-aaRS at the early stage of evolution to an
analysis of the well known data on aptamer recognition
of amino acids, in the hope of elucidating remnants of
the primordial code. Here they make a very good observation that explains the superficially puzzling representation of both codons and anticodons in the aptamers
selected for binding Arg, Ile and Tyr: the codons for
these amino acids are self-complementary palindromes
in positions 1-2 (eg, CGN for Arg), so it is not surprising that, as long as (say) the codon is over-represented
in the aptamer, so will be the anticodon. This I believe

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

solves a “pseudo-puzzle” in the aptamer data. They then
continue with the discussion of the other type of palindromic relationship between codons and anticodons:
codon positions 2-3 vs anticodon positions 1-2. The
conclusion for Arg is that “when for the same amino
acid, arginine, we find in its RNA-binding sites a cognate, but not-CG-containing, triplet, it appears to be the
anticodon, not codon”. And overall: “Anticodons, not
codons, are more often significantly over-represented in
aa-binding sites of the RNA aptamers“. There is also
another, more subtle pattern that comes out of the aptamer analysis: “For amino acids encoded by dinucleotidepalindrome-containing triplets, their binding sites in
RNA aptamers “prefer” the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3)
motifs over the codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) ones in spite of
their seemingly perfect symmetry“. The primary conclusion, of course, is that the 3 rd base of the overrepresented triplet in aptamers is more important in
aptamer-amino acid recognition, so the recognition is
anticodon-based rather than codon-based. The metaconclusion is that this recognition is a relic of the putative primordial, pre-translational code.
I am afraid I am rather skeptical of this entire line of
reasoning - above all, because the aptamer data are
weak, with the possible exception of only two amino
acids, and these amino acids (Arg and Ile) are not the
simplest ones or those that are generally thought to be
primordial. I am just not convinced that the aptamer
data are relevant at all. What is more, assuming there is
some signal there, I am not sure it has anything to do
with either codons and anticodons. The authors themselves are very emphatic on the statements that the primordial code had nothing to do with translation, and
indeed, the classic results on specific aminoacylation of
the CCA-arms (refs. [25,26]) do suggest the existence of
a primordial operational code that might have had nothing to do with the present one.
The rest of the paper is a rather involved discussion of
the potential relics of the pre-translation stages in the
tRNA structures, in part, recapitulating the previous
publications of the authors. The idea with the Fibonacci-like iterative process of tRNA evolution is of
course very elegant and numerologically appealing but
the entire scheme is quite speculative.
So does this paper report progress in our understanding
of the origin and evolution of translation and the code? It
is hard to give a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. The paper ends with
the overall conclusion that “Translation without code does
not make sense, but code without (and before) translation
does”. I think this is good logic. I also applaud with the
authors’ approach of combining many different lines of
evidence in approaching this formidable evolutionary puzzle. However, my overall position is that we still have not
developed the right way to approach this problem, so all

Page 17 of 24

current scenarios are likely to be wrong in most details. In
this situation, what matters is the quality of the discourse,
and in this respect, the current paper will be helpful to any
researcher interested in the problem.
Authors’ Response

We have greatly appreciated the reviewer’s comments
and critique; our response is structured in the following
three sections:
I. On the general relevance of aa-binding RNA aptamers data to the problem of the genetic code origin
Just like the singularity point in the origin and evolution
of universe, the actual start of bilingual life (with nucleic
acids, proteins and genetic code in between) was, is, and
probably will always remain obscure. In such an “agnostic” (in Huxley’s meaning) situation, one of the very few
intellectual pursuits that a theoretician could afford to
accept as not being hopelessly speculative would be to
examine, by all conceivable means (including in vitro
experiments with aa-specific RNA aptamers), the crucial
“key-lock vs. frozen accident” alternative. Naturally, in
vitro selection of RNA aptamers (aimed at an increasingly
more specific recognition of a particular amino acid) has
little, if anything, in common with shaping of the genetic
code that actually took place in early evolution. Apparently, the real code developed stepwise following the classic scheme of gene duplications with subsequent
specifications, regardless of whether it have started with a
very specific stereo-chemical “key-lock”, a true “frozen
accident”, or possibly something in between — a “frozen
stereo-chemical accident” ([16] see also [10]). In contrast,
SELEX experiments of the Yarus type always start with
an absolutely random RNA sequence. But if so, then the
excesses one observes in selexed aa-binding RNA sites —
excess of cognate anticodons in general, and excess of
anticodon (2-3)/codon(1-2) tetraplets in particular — are
all the more impressive.
II. More on excess of anticodons in aa-binding sites of
RNA aptamers Logically, if we accept that p-aaRSs
must have been preceded by r-aaRSs, then we have to
face the problem of interaction between a particular aa
and its cognate r-aaRS, and this, in a nutshell, is the
proverbial problem of the genetic code origin. Specifically, a whole cluster of interrelated questions arises, the
most important (in our estimation) ones being: (1) was
this interaction absolutely random, or stereo-chemically
selective (at least weakly), and (2) did this interaction
have anything in common with the real genetic coding?
The similarity of aa-binding sites in RNA aptamers
independently selexed for a given amino acid casts
doubt on the randomness. Moreover, the significant
excess of cognate anticodons within these sites strengthens the hypothesis of underlying stereo-chemical preference. The RNA aptamer data are statistically compelling
in this regard (see also the detailed analysis in [12]), and

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

the question one might ask is rather how to account for
this striking level of significance by any other means?
Previously, one of us (ES) has formulated this precisely: logic dictates the hypothesis of direct interactions
between RNA and amino acids in the emerging RNP
life, but corresponding binding sites may not have anything to do with the current cognate triplets [9]. In this
case, the codon/anticodon triplets would have been an
early operational code of sorts (in a sense that they
would have been symbolic/conventional, rather than iconic). Then, of course, we should be able to demonstrate
some other sequences being specific binders. The
experiments, first suggested in [90], are now known as
Yarus type SELEX experiments; our analyses thereof
have revealed anticodonic “predominance”, and so we
tentatively conclude that early coding was, so to speak,
iconic and anticodonic.
Two of us (SNR and ASR), just like the Reviewer 1
(and for similar reasons), initially also made light of the
stereo-chemical hypothesis until (1) revealing the subcode for two modes of tRNA recognition by aaRSs (Figure 1B), and (2) noticing that the puzzling confusionprone simultaneous presence of codons in aa-binding
sites of selexed RNA aptamers might have been simply
a hitch-hiking by-product of the anticodon-targeted
selection (discussed in this paper). We feel that this
observation is in fact more important than a mere resolution of the persistent but superficial puzzle — and it
certainly increases the significance of RNA aptamer data
in the context of the problem of genetic code origin. In
principle, the complementarity of codons and anticodons means that there is no difference whether it is the
former or the latter that will prevail in aa-binding sites
of RNAs. However, the fact that it is actually the latter
(and we present not one but many independent pieces
of evidence in support of the anticodon’s prevalence)
tells us a lot about the consistency of the primacy of
anticodons (by origin) with logically necessary primacy
of coding. As a matter of fact, it is mildly ironic that the
aa-cognate triplets in mRNAs were named “codons”
(ensuring their complements in tRNAs being named
“anticodons”). Strictly speaking, it would make more
sense to flip the terms — if anticodons did emerge first,
as the aa-specific triplets in ribozymes of the primordial
RNA life (perhaps long before amino acids were
recruited into translation), they deserve to be named
“codons”. Consequently, triplets in mRNAs would
become “anticodons” (thus reflecting their origin as
complementary copies of aa-specific triplets).
III. On primordial amino acids, operational code and
sub-code for two modes of tRNA recognition by putative r-aaRSs Aminoacylation of a tRNA molecule from
two, major and minor grove, sides (Figure 1C) is supposed to be a very ancient feature of life. By

Page 18 of 24

complementary transformation of the genetic code table
(Figure 1B), we have revealed its internal “yin-yang” pattern (a sub-code of sorts) that minimizes errors of
tRNA recognition by putative r-aaRSs for complementarily encoded amino acids [19,36]. This sub-code implies
primacy of anticodons in the genetic code origin, but
for simplest ("primordial"?) amino acids such as Ala and
Gly, recognition of their proto-tRNAs by putative
r-aaRSs might have been more acceptor- than anticodontargeted, i.e. associated with the ancient operational code
rather than the classic one (see [20] for details of this
seeming “paradox”). Importantly, we do stress that in
actuality there is no “paradox” here, and that in general
the primordial code most likely had little, if anything, to
do with translation (but, of course, not with coding per
se). Quite the opposite, in a series of papers [18-20,35,36]
we pursued the idea (and consolidated the data in support of showing) that (1) the primordial code was actually
operational (and only operational), but nevertheless (2)
these two codes - operational code of tRNA aminoacylation embodied mostly in the acceptor stem [25,26] and
the classic code associated with anticodons by which
cells are reading mRNAs during translation - might have
had a common ribozymes-implemented ancestor
[18-20,35,36]. If so, classic experimental results of proper
specific aminoacylation of tRNAs truncated to mini- or
even micro-helix [25,26] and in vitro selection of aa-specific RNA aptamers [12] complement rather than exclude
each other — which is one of the leitmotifs of the present
paper.
As far as Ala, Gly or any other (presumably) primordial
amino acids are concerned, at this time we are not aware
of any reports stressing not the excess (or deficiency) of
their cognate anticodons (codons) in aa-binding sites
of RNA aptamers, but rather the successful selection of
such RNA aptamers at all. Thus, it remains unclear
whether such excess in fact exists; further, more refined,
experimental attempts with selection of RNA aptamers
for such amino acids would be most welcome.

Reviewer Comments

The origin of genetic code and translation system is a
problem (or two related problems) full of controversies.
The reason is that the translation system is very complicated and the coding principle is not clear (e.g. not clear
as the base-pairing mechanism evolved in the replication
of DNA or RNA, or their interdependent synthesis).
According to the Darwinian Continuity principle (i.e.
“evolution has no foresight”) [7], the emergence of the
complicated system, including its components as well as
the coding principle, should have included quite a few

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

intermediate steps. This manuscript, following the idea
of a previous hypothesis (CCH, Coding Coenzyme Handles [9]), emphasized (with new evidence) that the coding principle should have emerged before translation.
This idea has its intrinsic feature to explain the origin of
the coding principle considering that “evolution has no
foresight”. The evidence came mainly from a detailed
analysis of the updated data in experiments of RNA aaaptamers [12]. Overall, the argument is reasonable, but,
in my opinion, some detailed deductions or assertions
need a more cautiously examination.
Based on the analysis on aptamer data of three amino
acids containing both their anticodons and codons, the
authors asserted reasonably that such cases should be
associated with the palindrome-dinucleotides. Together
with data of other amino acids in [12] and also recent
evidence in [31,33], it is also reasonable to conclude
that anticodons, not codons, are more often significantly
over-represented in aa-binding sites, and that in some
cases, “codons might simply follow anticodons (like
hitch hikers)” This conclusion is “welcome” by the
stereochemical theory on the origin of the genetic code,
considering the previous statement, “both anticodons
and codons are over-represented in aa-binding sites”, is
ambiguous and hard to explain [7].
“For amino acids encoded by dinucleotide-palindromecontaining triplets, their binding sites in RNA aptamers
“prefer” the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3) motifs over the
codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) ones in spite of their seemingly
perfect symmetry.” This conclusion seems also to be supported by the data in [12]. Indeed, the situation could be
interpreted as the 1-2 nucleotides of the codon contribute
more to the specificity of interaction, or the 2-3 nucleotides of the anticodon contribute more to the specificity of
interaction. Then, the latter interpretation could be
accepted considering the above conclusion that it might
be anticodons that actually associated with cognate amino
acids. Thus, a new, interesting assertion, stronger than
that in the CCH hypothesis, could be phrased as “the
degeneracy of 1st position in anticodons (3rd position in
‘future’ codons) also appears to have originated before
translation”. In this context, it is also attractive to attribute
“the fact that codon’s 3rd nt is more degenerated than the
anticodon’s 1st nt” to the cause that anticodons should
have emerged before codons, which would be used only in
the “future” translation system.
“The motif 5’-CGCG-3’ is of a special interest (Figure 2),
because one can see it in two ways: CGC is a codon(1-2)
for CG palindrome and, simultaneously, it is also a codon
(2-3) for GC palindrome. The overlapping GCG anticodon, in its turn, can be considered as the (2-3) or (1-2)
one for CG and GC, respectively.”
I think that this description has some problems. The
corresponding motif should be 5’-GCGC-3’ when CGC

Page 19 of 24

is a codon(1-2) and GCG an anticodon(2-3) for CG
palindrome, while the corresponding motif should be
5’-CGCG-3’ when CGC is a codon(2-3) and GCG an
anticodon(1-2) for GC palindrome.
“This ambiguity is fraught with confusion for coding.
Very telling, therefore, is the fact that Arg-binding sites
do not contain the 5’-CGCG-3’ motif at all, in contrast to
the above three motifs of the codon(1-2)/anticodon(2-3)
type. This fact becomes even more telling if we take in
account presence of 5’-CGCG-3’ beyond aa-binding sites
([12]: see, in the Arg list, cases 17, F2e, F2f, and F2U)”.
Now that aptamers have nothing to do with translation, how comes the ambiguity for coding? The logic is
hard to understand. The true one might be that the 5’CGCG-3’ motif is a representation of codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2), thus not appearing. If so, a directly contrary
motif should be 5’-GCGC-3’ (as I mentioned above),
which should be abundant. However, the analysis or
comment on 5’-GCGC-3’ does not appear in the
manuscript.
Authors’ Response

We found the reviewer’s comments and critique particularly incisive; the two major issues are discussed below.
First of all, one should take into account that for arginine these tetraplets, 5’-CGCG-3’ and 5’-GCGC-3’, are
both codon(2-3)/anticodon(1-2) relative to the GC
palindrome and, simultaneously, are both codon(1-2)/
anticodon(2-3) relative to the CG palindrome, the only
difference being the dinucleotide with which anticodon
GCG and codon CGC overlap — GC in the 5’-CGCG-3’
case, and CG in the 5’-GCGC-3’ case. Accordingly, if
anticodon GCG is a driver, and GC palindrome is under
consideration, then the corresponding tetraplet containing Arg’s codon is 5’-CGCG-3’ (and only 5’-CGCG-3’).
On the contrary, if anticodon GCG is again a driver, but
it is CG palindrome that is under consideration, then
the corresponding tetraplets are 5’-GCGN-3’, including
5’-GCGC-3’.
Importantly, it is the CG at 1-2 positions of codon
(2-3 positions of anticodon) that actually specifies Arg,
whereas the GC at 2-3 positions of codon (1-2 positions
of anticodon) is irrelevant (specifying Ala). It thus
appears that codon CGC might have “formally” accompanied (as a hitch-hiker) anticodon GCG in 5’-CGCG-3’
via the Arg-unrelated GC dinucleotide, and that is precisely why we chose to deliberately focus our description
on 5’-CGCG-3’. The result - absence of this motif in
Arg-binding sites - speaks for itself. Remarkably, in
independently selexed Ile-binding sites we also do not
see (and probably exactly for the same reason) the 5’AUAU-3’ tetraplet in which anticodon UAU supposedly
drives codon AUA as a hitch-hiker but via the central
Ile-irrelevant UA palindrome (in the manuscript, we
stress this fact just after describing the arginine case).

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

Page 20 of 24

Needless to say, from the very beginning we have
checked all possible Arg-related tetraplets including
those, in which anticodon GCG was supposed to be a
driver. The results were (1) excess of 5’-GCGG-3’ and
(2) complete absence of all others, including the
5’-GCGC-3’. Again, one can see exactly the same pattern in Ile-binding sites with anticodon UAU as a driver:
a great excess of the 5’-UAUU-3’ and complete absence
of all others, including the 5’-UAUA-3’ (Figure 9).
Furthermore, the UAU anticodon of Ile is a codon for
Tyr. However, the latter is not significantly overrepresented

in Tyr-specific sites of RNA aptamers. Symmetrically, AUA
is a significantly overrepresented triplet, as an anticodon, in
Tyr-binding sites but not, as a codon, in Ile-binding ones.
Thus, it appears that coding triplets in Ile-binding sites preclude confusion with Tyr (and vice versa) as if the RNAs
selected for direct affinity to a specific amino acid have
already been protected from confusion with its complementarily encoded partner. This is surprising, because the RNA
aptamers have not been specifically selected to avoid noncognate amino acids. We have decided to address this
issue in a more nuanced fashion elsewhere (Szathmáry and

Rodin, in preparation); however, the reviewer’s remarks led
us to restoring the original paragraph of the manuscript
here, in the present discussion.
Tyr-binding sites show overrepresentation of the characteristic 5’-RAUA-3’ motifs (with AUA anticodon): 5’GAUA-3’ and 5’-AAUA-3’, which is a precise complement
of the characteristic 5’-UAUU-3’ motif (with UAU anticodon) that happens to be overrepresented in Ile-binding
sites (see Figure 3 and [12]). This fact is consistent with
our hypothesis of two earliest r-aaRS precursors that have
been complementary to each other [18-20]. Importantly,
these coding tetraplets, 5’-UAUU-3’ and 5’-AAUA-3’, cannot be confused. In contrast, coding tetraplets (in putative
r-aaRSs) formed by complementary anticodon and codon,
are indeed confusion-prone simply because any such tetraplet is a perfect self-complementary palindrome. For
example, Ile’s anticodon UAU and its complement AUA
form the 5’-UAUA-3’ palindrome, the complementary
image of which is, again, 5’-UAUA-3’. Same holds for tyrosine as well as complementarily encoded arginine and alanine. In such cases, the two complementary r-aaRSs might
have had virtually the same aa-coding sites, leading to the
high risk of wrong aminoacylation — accordingly, they
would have been selected against.
Obviously, the correct logical flow should be in
reverse: selection for stereo-affinity of a given amino
acid (for example, Ile) to the oligonucleotides containing
this aa-cognate anticodon UAU within the 5’-UAUU-3’
tetramer automatically entails selection for the presence
of AUA within 5’-AAUA-3’ in the complementary
sequence which happens to be preferred by Tyr - the
Ile’s complementary partner in the real genetic code. Of
course, it is unlikely that the actual shaping of the
genetic code had much in common with this in vitro
multi-step selection of RNA aptamers each time beginning with a random sequence (see our response to
reviewer 1). Therefore, the detection of these mutually
complementary and “non-confusable” tetraplets, 5’UAUU-3’ and 5’-AAUA-3’ (and, on the contrary, complete absence of “confusable” 5’-UAUA-3’ and 5’AUAU-3’) within Ile- and Tyr-binding sites of independently selected RNAs is all the more meaningful. At this
time, we do not suggest any mechanistic explanation for
this somewhat surprising result but it shows us that
there might have been, indeed, certain structural prerequisites for two complementary modes of tRNA recognition by aaRSs, firstly ribozymes then enzymes.
Moreover, this result indirectly supports, in our opinion,
two basic hypotheses: (1) that primary stereo-affinity did
play an essential role in the origin of the genetic code,
and (2) that even before translation amino acids might
have been engaged in coding by complementary pairs
rather than one by one. The above immediately suggests
a relatively simple idea for the selex experiment control

Page 21 of 24

- to use both plus and minus RNA sequences in selection of aa-binding RNA aptamers, so that selection for
one aa-binding site would facilitate starting conditions
for selection of its complementary partners.
To our knowledge, there were no reports of successful
selection of RNA aptamers for Ala, the complementary
partner of Arg (for possible reasons see [20], the main
text and our response to Reviewer 1), whereas the available data on Ile- and Tyr-binding sites are consistent
with this hypothesis. Moreover, as one can see in Figure
9, by substituting C for A and G for U, we move (1) from
the Arg-coding CG palindrome-dinucleotide to the Ilecoding AU palindrome-dinucleotide, (2) from the 5’GCGG-3’ motif, overrepresented in Arg-binding sites, to
the 5’-UAUU-3’ motif, overrepresented in Ile-binding
sites, and (3) from 5’-GCGC-3’, which is completely
absent in Arg-binding sites to 5’-UAUA-3’, which is completely absent in Ile-binding sites. The same result can be
obtained by moving from Ile to Arg, i.e. by replacing A
for C and U for G. We believe that this striking parallelism between coding motifs of such different amino acids
as Arg and Ile sends us an important message about the
origins of the genetic code. In particular, if at some point
in the future the Yarus-type experiments “selexed” for
alanine prove to be successful, we would not be particularly surprised by finding the 5’-CCGC-3’ motif (with
anticodon CGC) in Ala-binding sites of RNA aptamers.
Finally, we must confess that, in turn, we do not quite
understand the reviewer’s perplexity expressed in “Now
that aptamers have nothing to do with translation, how
comes the ambiguity for coding?” The gist of our report
is that the origin of the coding system does not necessarily have to be tied to translation. Furthermore, as coding preceded translation, we do not need (and thus
avoid being caught in the implicit trap of) the foresight
evolution. And, the risk of ambiguous anticodon-to-aa
assignment, while originally of crucial importance for
primordial coding in the RNA world, was of less, if any,
relevance for translation which most likely evolved later.
In the RNA world, errors of RNA aminoacylation might
have been serious enough to be selected against. In conclusion, this remains a high priority task on our agenda
- to find out which component of the genetic coding
ambiguity has been minimized before (and outside of),
and which — after (and in co-evolution with) the development of translation machinery.
Reviewer Comments

“Literally: 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 7 = 11, 7 + 11 = 18, 11 + 18 =
29, 18 + 29 = 47, and finally 29 + 47 = 76!” This seems
to be a coincidence. The Fibonacci-like iterative process
in the model of tRNA growth (Figure 5) is not based on
an explanation of structure-function relationship. For
example, why tRNAs should grow in such a way? or,
what is the driving force for the growth? Without a

Rodin et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:14
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/14

detailed explanation on these intermediate steps, the
model is not presented in a way consistent with the
Darwinian Continuity principle.
Actually, there are quite a lot other interpretations
based on the authors’ previous work that seems to be
problematic because there is not a consideration on
those intermediates steps involve in the origin of translation system, for example, those concerning r-aaRSs
and the operational code. The r-aaRSs ("implementers”)
should be a set of functional RNA molecules in addition
to the set of tRNAs ("adaptors”). If they should have
existed, what is the original source of these RNA molecules before they were recruited into the translation system? In addition, what should their structure be like to
implement their function? Similarly, those interpretations concerning the operational code are also obscure.
If the operational code should indeed have worked in
the RNA world, and have occurred before the emergence of the anticodon loop, what advantage would
drive the later emergence of the anticodon loop? On
these points, I do not mean that the events involved is
impossible, instead, I tend to agree the view of Koonin
and Novozhilov ("Origin and evolution of the genetic
code: the univeral enigma” Iubmb Life 2009, 61: 99-111),
namely, “a real understanding of the code origin and evolution is likely to be attainable only in conjunction with a
credible scenario for the evolution of the coding principle
itself and the translation system”. The extended discussion
in the present manuscript on these events seems to give
readers an impression that there are too many assumptions without a detailed interpretation solidly based on a
scenario according to the Darwinian Continuity principle.
Perhaps a better choice of the manuscript is to focus its
discussion on its formal schemes mentioned above, and
extend the discussion only a little to the issues concerning
the authors’ previously work on r-aaRSs, the operational
code and others.
Authors’ Response

We are certainly aware of the translation problem, and
we are not (at this time, anyway) staking a claim to the
full, comprehensive solution — rather, we suggest a
number of clues to that effect.
As far as possible intermediate advantages in evolution
of the operational code, putative r-aaRSs, and tRNAs are
concerned, we feel that the reviewer might, figuratively
speaking, be asking too much — and not just from the
proposed scenario, but from the field of the genetic
code origin research in general. Moving on to the specifics of the Fibonacci-like iteration coincidence, we
would like to touch briefly on the following two aspects:
First, the internal periodicity of tRNA sequences and
certain other considerations suggest to many investigators that tRNA precursors were at first much shorter

Page 22 of 24

(why would they be longer?), but have grown afterwards.
If so, the following important questions arise: (1) how is
it possible to achieve the same structure in the simultaneously growing molecules? and, (2) how could this
growth reflect the principle of evolutionary continuity,
where the next stage inherits useful functions gained at
the previous stage? For (1), we show how this could be
perfectly possible, and for (2) we demonstrate that the
process of Fibonacci-like iterative growth fits the continuity principle (at least outwardly). To tell the truth, it
was not the yet another example of the golden ratio
implementation in Nature that held particular appeal to
us, but rather the idea of the regularized and coordinated
growth of the initial coding tri- and tetra-nucleotides
“towards” one and the same final cloverleaf, a process
appealingly consistent with the continuity principle.
Second, when studying evolution ab simplecioribus ad
complexiora, it goes without saying that, in order to
make any stepwise evolutionary scenario workable, one
should think about “Darwinian” motivation for each
step. Gradual shaping of code adaptors into the final
tRNA cloverleaf is no exception; however, we can only
guess which specific agents in the “late” RNA world
(with translation already emerging) could drive this process. This said, the tRNA molecule is truly a molecule
“for all seasons” [91] — it could have had many opportunities to do so. We consider this issue worthy of comprehensive treatment, and it will be discussed elsewhere
(Szathmáry and Rodin, in preparation).

Reviewer Comments

This paper is a wonderful piece of detective work that at
the same time synthesizes many separate observations and
theories on the origin of the genetic code and tRNAs. I
really found nothing in here that requires substantial comment or clarification, other than to say it is a thoroughly
interesting read - real food for thought. The analysis of
results of amino acid binding sites in vitro selected RNA
aptamers is thorough, and the Fibonacci process-inspired
model for the evolution of tRNAs is truly insightful and
thought-provoking. Perhaps one of the most interesting
points of this process is that it yields a very precise stepwise model wherein tRNAs can converge independently
from unrelated short RNA aptamers that bind amino acids
upon a common length (and structure), ultimately containing both operational and genetic codes.
Authors’ Response

We are very grateful to Reviewer 3 for this encouraging,
succinct and yet precise formulation of what we have
actually set out to achieve when writing the manuscript.
