Abstract
Background: Many of the available methods for detecting Genomic Islands (GIs) in prokaryotic
genomes use markers such as transposons, proximal tRNAs, flanking repeats etc., or they use other
supervised techniques requiring training datasets. Most of these methods are primarily based on
the biases in GC content or codon and amino acid usage of the islands. However, these methods
either do not use any formal statistical test of significance or use statistical tests for which the
critical values and the P-values are not adequately justified. We propose a method, which is
unsupervised in nature and uses Monte-Carlo statistical tests based on randomly selected segments
of a chromosome. Such tests are supported by precise statistical distribution theory, and
consequently, the resulting P-values are quite reliable for making the decision.
Results: Our algorithm (named Design-Island, an acronym for Detection of Statistically Significant
Genomic Island) runs in two phases. Some 'putative GIs' are identified in the first phase, and those
are refined into smaller segments containing horizontally acquired genes in the refinement phase.
This method is applied to Salmonella typhi CT18 genome leading to the discovery of several new
pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and metabolic islands that were missed by earlier methods.
Many of these islands contain mobile genetic elements like phage-mediated genes, transposons,
integrase and IS elements confirming their horizontal acquirement.
Conclusion: The proposed method is based on statistical tests supported by precise distribution
theory and reliable P-values along with a technique for visualizing statistically significant islands. The
performance of our method is better than many other well known methods in terms of their
sensitivity and accuracy, and in terms of specificity, it is comparable to other methods.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer is an important mechanism for
the evolution of microbial genomes. In 1990, it was first
observed that large blocks of horizontally acquired foreign sequences occur in chromosomes of pathogenic bacteria, and those regions are highly correlated with
pathogenicity [1-3]. Some of these possess mobile ele-

ments consisting of a gene for specific recombinase and
sequences having characteristics of integration sites. Some
others, despite their apparently foreign nature, lack insertion sequences, recombinase genes and specific att sites,
and they may contain only fragments of mobility genes.
In the latter case, the mobility sequences were probably
lost in course of evolution after their integration into the

bacterial genome [1]. The first known foreign DNA blocks
that were proved to be associated with virulence genes of
pathogenic bacteria were named as pathogenicity islands
[4]. Later on, genomes of non-pathogenic bacteria have
been shown to contain foreign gene blocks, which are not
associated with virulence. These gene blocks determine
various accessory functions like secondary metabolic
activities, antibiotic resistance, symbiosis and other special functions related to the survival in harsh environmental conditions [5]. Subsequently, all foreign gene blocks
are collectively named in the literature as genomic islands
(GIs) [5,6]. There is an extensive literature on the study of
GIs in prokaryotic genomes [7,8]. GIs in prokaryotic
genomes often contain horizontally transferred genetic
materials as evident from the presence of integrase, transposons, phage mediated genes, etc. in these islands. Consequently, they are critically important in the study of the
evolution, the pathogenesis and other special features of
prokaryotic genomes.

training data-set that was formed by the authors using the
aggregation of known GIs from different organisms. However, unless there are several organisms with some statistical similarities in their genome sequences as well as in
their known GIs, such an aggregation to form the training
data-set may not be appropriate. Besides, the GIs available
and known a priori for a single organism may be very few
at the beginning of the investigation.

Several methods have been reported and discussed in the
available literature for detecting GIs in prokaryotic
genomes [9-13]. Many of these methods use markers such
as transposons, proximal tRNAs, flanking repeats etc. to
identify GIs [9,11,14]. Mantri and Williams [11] used
tRNA and tmRNA as markers. They further searched for
the phage integrase and passed through different filtration
procedures for the identification of GIs. Ou et al. [9] also
started with tRNA and tmRNA genes as primary markers,
and after passing through different filtration techniques,
the GIs were identified. In another previous study, the
authors have identified the GIs after performing the cluster analysis of the chromosomal fragments, which are
formed by fragmenting the chromosomes based on locations of transposons [14]. Such methods, which are based
on standard markers, are particularly useful for detecting
GIs acquired by a genome from another compositionally
close donor genome or those, which have become compositionally close to the host genome due to the amelioration process. In such cases, the islands may not bear any
compositional signature that can be used to distinguish it
from rest of the host genome. Consequently, identification of such islands has to rely on possible presence of
structural features, like tRNA, direct repeats (DR), integrase gene etc. However, there are limitations of such
methods, which are based on standard markers. Firstly,
only the GIs, which are associated with standard markers,
can be identified by this method. Secondly, there may be
intra-chromosomal rearrangements, and islands may no
longer be in the proximity of those standard markers after
such rearrangements. Consequently, many GIs may not
be detected by marker-based methods [7].

Our method searches for islands in a prokaryotic chromosome using a probing window that slides over the entire
chromosome and also varies in its size. For a given size
and a given position of that probing window, the segment
of the chromosome captured by the window is compared
with the rest of the chromosome by means of statistical
tests. The outcome of each such test is a statistical P-value
that lies between zero and one. A low P-value, which indicates a significant difference between the segments captured by the probing window and the rest of the
chromosome, bears evidence for the probing window
having a substantial overlap with a GI. All these P-values
obtained from statistical tests carried out at different locations and for different sizes of the probing window can be
represented by a 3D plot, which enables visualization of
locations and sizes of GIs in the chromosome. For the
determination of GIs, window based methods have been
used in some earlier studies. The GIs of Pseudomonas putida
KT2440 were determined by analyzing the compositional
bias of the mono-, di- and tetra-nucleotide contents in the
segment of the genome under the probing window of
4000 bp that slides in steps of 1000 bp [16]. These
authors, however, have used windows with fixed lengths,
and there is no objective guideline for how to determine
that length in practice. Zhang and Zhang [10] used a windowless method for displaying the distribution of genomic
GC content, and the cumulative GC profile was used by
them for the determination of GIs. Abrupt jump in cumulative GC profile, which is due to relatively different GC
content of an island, enabled them to identify the GI. But
this was done in a subjective manner and neither clear
quantitative measure nor any formal statistical test for
assessing the abrupt change in the cumulative GC profile
was proposed by these authors.

In an earlier paper [15], the authors used discriminant
analysis, a supervised statistical technique, based on a

In this paper, we have developed a method that does not
use any standard marker when islands are searched in the
genome. Islands identified by this method may, however,
be confirmed subsequently by supporting factors that
include such markers as well as possible presence of
known horizontally transferred genes (e.g., phage mediated genes). This will be clear in the section where we discuss the results. Further, the proposed method is
unsupervised in nature, and it does not require any training data set for its implementation.

Known methods for identifying GIs are primarily based
on GC contents of the islands, their oligo-nucleotide
usage patterns and the codon usage biases in the genes
present in the island [10,12,13,16]. When a fixed segment
under the probing window is compared with the whole
chromosome, which may contain several GIs (in some
cases it might be as large as 20% of the whole chromosome [17]), such a comparison is likely to get influenced
by those islands, and this reduces the resolution of the
comparison. In order to cope with this problem, we have
introduced a refinement phase in our algorithm, where the
fixed segment under the probing window is compared
with randomly selected segments from the chromosome
excluding the parts detected as 'putative GI's' in the first
phase. This will be discussed in detail in the section on
methods.
Various procedures studied in the literature generally lack
a formal and rigorous statistical treatment of the problem
of comparing a segment of the chromosome with the rest
of the chromosome in order to decide whether the segment is the part of a GI or not. Often no formal statistical
test is carried out, and the decision to declare a segment as
part of an island is done in a subjective way as mentioned
earlier. In some other cases, statistical tests have been carried out in a way that is somewhat questionable in the
sense that the determination of the critical values and the
P-values is not adequately justified due to lack of a rigorous statistical distribution theory of the deviance measures used for such tests. Yoon et al. [18] used Mahalanobis
distance to evaluate the deviation of the codon usage of a
gene from the mean of that in the genome. They assumed
normal distribution of codon frequencies without much
justification for it, and converted the Mahalanobis distance into a P-value using the χ2 distribution function.
They have considered a gene as extraneous in codon usage
if its P-value was less than 0.05 [18]. On the other hand,
Zhang and Zhang [10] obtained their results based on
codon usage and amino acid usage biases using different
cut-offs for the P-values. In some earlier studies [19,20],
authors used higher order motifs to capture the compositionally deviating regions from the genome. In another
study by Vernikos et al. [21], authors used variable order
motifs and relative entropy for the detection of compositionally deviating regions. In our method, we have used a
Monte-Carlo statistical test, which is partly motivated by
the idea of the bootstrap method in statistics [22,23] for
comparing the segment under the probing window with
randomly selected segments from the rest of the chromosome. Such Monte-Carlo statistical tests based on randomly selected segments of the chromosome can be
supported by simple and precise statistical distribution
theory.

Methods
Let us denote a whole chromosomal sequence of an
organism by S, and s will denote a given segment of S. In
order to assess whether s differs significantly from the rest
of S, we need a measure of distance that can be used for
quantitative comparison between the given segment s and
any other segment s' of S not having any overlap with s.
Such a distance measure, which we may denote as d(s, s'),
can be based on GC contents of s and s' or their oligonucleotide distributions. For instance, one may use the
absolute distance, the Euclidean distance or Kullback-Leibler divergence computed from oligo nucleotide frequencies. Alternatively, for annotated genomes, one may form
the distance measure d(s, s') by comparing the gene contents of s and s' and their codon and amino acid usage
biases.
Merkl et al. [12] used codon usage analysis of two species
assuming the similarity of codon usage in phylogenetically related species. Weinel et al. [16] analyzed the dinucleotide usage and the tetra-nucleotide usage in sliding
windows and compared them with the di-nucleotide
usage of the whole genome and uniform tetra-nucleotide
usage respectively. In the study by Zhang and Zhang [10],
putative GIs detected by cumulative GC profile were further analyzed by codon usage and amino acid usage of
those regions compared to the whole chromosome S.
Comparison of the codon usage and oligo-nucleotide
usage of the given segment s with those for the whole
chromosome S has some drawbacks because S may contain several GIs. In some cases, the total size of the GIs in
S would be much larger than the length of s, and it can be
as large as 20% of the size of S [17]. This may statistically
contaminate values of various parameters related to GC
content as well as oligo-nucleotide and codon usage
biases when computed for the entire chromosomal
sequence S. This is likely to reduce the resolution of the
comparison. In our algorithm, this issue is carefully
addressed by introducing a refinement phase, which has
been discussed below.
In our method, the comparison between s and the rest of
S is based on N randomly selected segments s1,1, s1,2, s1,3,
.........s1,N from the chromosome S, each of which has the
same length as that of s, and none of them has any overlap
with s. We also choose N random pairs of segments (s2,1,
s3,1), (s2,2, s3,2), (s2,3, s3,3), .........(s2,N, s3,N) from S, where
for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, s2,i and s3,i are independently selected,
and each of them has the same length as the given segment s and no overlap with s. Then, we can compute the
distances (e.g., distances based on oligo-nucleotide distributions as discussed below) d1,i = d(s,s1,i) and d2,i = d(s2,i,
s3,i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ N and form the following two sets of distance values:

D1 = {d1,i|1 ≤ i ≤ N} and D2 = {d2,i|1 ≤ i ≤ N}.
If s happens to be a part of a GI with characteristics very
different from the rest of S, the values in D1 are expected
to be larger than those in D2. Otherwise, the values in the
two sets are expected to be of the same order of magnitudes.
Statistical test for comparing s with the rest of S
In view of the way the distance values in D1 and D2 have
been obtained by random sampling of segments of S, the
values in each of these two sets can be viewed as independent and identically distributed random variables,
and the values in D1 will be completely independent from
the values in D2. The problem of comparing the values in
the two sets D1 and D2 can be formulated as a statistical
testing problem, where the null hypothesis can be taken
as H0: "the expected value of an element in D1 is the same
as that of an element in D2," and the alternative hypothesis would be HA: "the expected value of an element in D1
is larger than that of an element in D2." We set

Then, each of m1 and m2 is approximately normally distributed being an average of independent and identically
distributed random variables by the well-known central
limit theorem in probability theory if N is large. Further,
m1 and m2 are independently distributed, and s1 2/N and
s2 2/N will be the standard estimates for their variances
respectively. Hence, the statistic

Z=

)}

will be approximately normally distributed for large N,
and the mean of that normal distribution will be zero if
H0 is true, and it will be positive if HA is true. The variance
of that asymptotic normal distribution will be one under
both hypotheses. Consequently, Z can be used as a test
statistic for testing H0 against HA in a one-sided test. Here,
the P-value can be computed using the observed value of
Z for the given segment s under the probing window and
the standard normal distribution. This way of assessing
the statistical significance of the evidence for s being part
of a GI in the chromosome S using a Monte-Carlo test
based on random samples of segments from S is partly
motivated by the idea of the bootstrap [22,23]. In the

present study, we have used N = 200. For larger values of
N, the normal approximation will be more accurate for
the distribution of the test statistic, but the corresponding
computation time will also increase linearly with N, and
this might lead to a substantial computational cost when
we want to do the analysis for multiple segments with varying sizes located at different positions in the genome. For
some smaller chromosomes, we have tried values of N up
to 500, but the results did not change significantly.
If for some reasons (e.g., computational constraints), one
is forced to use smaller values of N, the normal approximation for the distribution of Z will not be valid. In that
case, one may work with a different formulation of the
statistical hypotheses as follows. The null hypothesis in
that case can be formulated as H0: "the statistical distribution of an element in D1 is the same as that of an element
in D2", and the alternative hypothesis can be formulated
as HA: "the distribution of an element in D1 is stochastically
larger than that of an element in D2". With these re-formulated hypotheses, one can carry out the test using twosample Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic [24] or WilcoxonMann-Whitney statistic [24-26]. These tests, which are
computationally more expensive than the test based on
normal distribution, have been used by previous authors
[14]. However, the power of such non-parametric statistical tests for detecting GIs tends to be less than the preceding test based on normal distribution, which is applicable
for relatively larger values of N.
Statistical analysis with segments having variable sizes and
locations
In order to identify islands at different locations of the
chromosome and to determine the stretches of those
islands, it is necessary to carry out our statistical analysis
using a probing window that slides across the chromosome and also varies in its size. The statistical test
described above can be implemented for any location and
size of the segment s under that probing window, and the
P-value can be computed. It would be useful to plot these
P-values so that one can visualize possible locations of the
islands in the chromosome as well as their stretches. Such
a plot of P-values would also enable us to assess visually
the statistical significance of the evidence for or against
different segments of the chromosomes to be possible
parts of GIs.

For visual presentation of the 'putative GIs' identified by
the analysis described above, a 3D plot for a chromosome
can be generated. In this 3D plot, chromosomal locations
of the probing window are plotted along the x-axis, corresponding probing window sizes are plotted along the yaxis, and the P-values in gray scale are plotted along the zaxis. Here, the P-value for a specific location and size of
the window is plotted using a gray scale that changes grad-

ually from black to white, where black corresponds to the
extreme P-value = 0, and white corresponds to the other
extreme P-value = 1. The white dots corresponding to
higher P-values become almost invisible in the white
background while dark dots corresponding to low P-values will be prominently visible marking the 'putative GIs'
in the chromosome.
For a specified value of P0 (0 <P0 < 1), one can determine
all the segments of a chromosome that are associated with
a P-value less than or equal to P0. This will lead to the
identification of some 'putative GIs' having varying sizes
and locations in the chromosome that are identifiable
with P-values equal to P0 or smaller. Ranges of the 'putative
GIs' in terms of their chromosomal locations can be determined using the cut-off value P0 and considering a specified number of at least r overlapping windows of variable
sizes having P-values smaller than or equal to P0.
Further refinement of the 'putative GIs' identified by the
first phase of the algorithm
In the first phase of our analysis, the presence of several GIs
in the genome may statistically contaminate the randomly
sampled segments by affecting their oligo-nucleotide distributions. Besides, 'putative GIs' obtained using the first
phase of the algorithm, are always of larger size than what
they are supposed to be because of the presence of many
'false positives' (i.e., segments of the genome that are statistically detected as GIs but are not biologically parts of
any true island). To reduce the false positives and increase
the resolution of our method, a refinement phase with a
sliding probing window w of a fixed size over the regions
detected as 'putative GIs' by the first phase of the analysis
has been performed. Random samples of genomic segments in the refinement phase were chosen from the
genome excluding the regions detected as 'putative GIs' in
the first phase. This substantially reduces the influence of
various possible islands present in S on any statistical
comparison between w and the randomly selected segment, and that in turn increases the resolution of the comparison. The comparison between a probing window w
and the rest of S excluding the regions under'putative GIs'
is again based on N randomly selected segments w1,1, w1,2,
w1,3, .........w1,N each of which has the same length as that
of w. The statistical analysis is very similar to that used in
the first phase. The P-values are generated using MonteCarlo tests carried out at variable locations of the probing
window with a fixed size.

A smaller probing window is recommended for the refinement phase as it will provide a way of precisely detecting
the GIs. Gene order conservation is rarely observed in distantly related species and several rearrangements and
movement of genes occurs frequently. So, some genes,
which are not horizontally acquired from other species,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/150

may be present within a 'putative GI' identified in the first
phase, and to some extent, this problem is taken care of by
the use of a smaller probing window. However, the use of
smaller probing window requires randomly sampled segments from non-contaminated stretches of the genome,
and those stretches are available after running the first
phase. Further, the probing window should not be so
small that it can be dominated by a single gene, which
would increase the effect of codon biases or amino acid
biases related to the level of expression or protein function.
Smaller probing windows are not recommended in the
first phase because it increases the computational cost during the first phase. The use of smaller probing windows
that slide over the genome lead to a large number of statistical tests, and this may produce many false positive
results. Further, there are high chances of substantial overlap of a randomly selected window in the first phase with
an island in the genome containing horizontally acquired
materials.
As in the first phase of the analysis, for a specified value of
P0 (0 <P0 < 1), one can again determine all the segments
of a 'putative GI', which is identified in the first phase, that
are associated with a P-value less than or equal to P0.
The entire methodology is presented in the form of a flow
chart in Fig. 1A, B, and we have named our method as
Design-Island (an acronym for Detection of Statistically Significant Genomic Island).
Choice of different parameters associated with the
algorithm
In the following section, we have presented results
obtained using the absolute distance based on tetra-nucleotide frequencies. Those results are obtained using P0 =
0.05 and r = 5 in first phase and P0 = 0.001 in the refinement
phase. The value of P0 in the first phase was relaxed to 0.05,
and it was chosen in such a way that most of the horizontally acquired stretches of the genome could be captured
by the 'putative GIs' detected in the first phase. After we
obtain the 'putative islands', we would be able to generate
some statistically non-contaminated stretches of the
genome (i.e., genomic regions excluding those putative
islands). Those stretches can be used for random sampling
of segments in the refinement phase. In order to determine
the value of P0 in the refinement phase, we have carried out
a performance assessment of our method for different values of P0 based on a dataset related to Salmonella typhi
CT18 generated by Vernikos et al. [21]. Their method of
constructing the dataset of putative horizontally transferred genes is discussed briefly in the section on results
and discussion. We have calculated the sensitivity (SN),
the specificity (SP) and the accuracy (AC) of our method

for different values of P0 ranging from P0 = 0.05 to P0 =
0.00001 (Fig. 2A). The slopes of the curve for SN, SP and
AC were also plotted for different values of P0 (Fig. 2B). As
this cut-off P-value increases, the specificity and the accuracy increase, but the sensitivity decreases. We have
observed that the specificity and the accuracy increase
steadily up to P0 = 0.001 (Fig. 2A), and then the slope of
each of the two curves decreases (Fig. 2B). The sensitivity
was observed to decreases with the increase in the cut-off
P-value, but in the region from P0 = 0.05 to P0 = 0.001, the
sensitivity decreases slowly, and then it decreases much
more sharply. Alternatively, one can determine the value
of P0 using the ROC curve approach. When we used that
technique with a range of P0 values from 0.05 to 0.00001,
it again led to the same value of P0 as the optimal, and we
have chosen the cut-off P-value as P0 = 0.001 for the refinement phase. It is possible that for some other bacterial
genomes, a different choice of P0 would be optimal

depending on the nucleotide compositions of those
genomes. However, some empirical studies using this
choice of P0 for some bacterial genomes other than S. typhi
CT18 demonstrated reasonable performance of our algorithm.
We have carried out our analysis with distance measures
based on oligo-nucleotides of different orders (i.e., sizes).
The islands detected by methods based on different orders
of oligo-nucleotides did not differ considerably. Only in
some cases either the boundaries of the segments of the
'putative GIs' slightly differed or a single 'putative GI' broke
into two or more segments. In most of the organisms, the
'putative GIs' detected using tetra-nucleotide analysis
include those detected by other analysis based on other
oligo-nucleotides, and the later analysis sometimes
missed some of the important segments of the genomes
containing known horizontally acquired materials. As we

will see in the section containing a comparative study of
different methods, our method outperformed the method
W8 [20], which is a method based on octa-nucleotides, in
many cases.
We have considered three types of distance measure computed using oligo-nucleotide frequencies. These are the
absolute distance, the Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. But all these distances lead to
almost the same result. The 'putative GIs' detected by
methods based on different distances tend to differ in
their boundaries to a small extent. We have finally
decided to use the absolute distance, which is computationally the simplest among all the distances considered.
Before computing the distances, as some authors suggested [27-32], one may normalize higher order oligonucleotide frequencies by lower order oligo-nucleotide
frequencies based on Markov type models.
One may, in principle, use distances computed using
codon usage or amino acid usage biases instead of oligonucleotide distributions. However, that will require the
use of complete annotation of the entire chromosome
and the gene content of each and every randomly selected
segment for our Monte-Carlo test. This makes the implementation of the method computationally challenging,
and we have not pursued that here.

Results and Discussion
We have implemented Design-Island on the chromosome
of Salmonella typhi CT18 obtained from NCBI database
[33]. The co-ordinates of statistically significant genomic
segments detected by Design-Island and their gene contents in the chromosomes of S. typhi CT18 are presented

Salmonella typhi CT18
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi), an aetiological
agent of typhoid fever, is a serious invasive bacterial disease of human. Many S. enterica serovars actively invade
the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence
mechanism. However, S. typhi has evolved the ability to
spread to the deeper tissues of human including liver,
spleen and bone marrow [34]. In S. typhi, thirteen pathogenicity islands (popularly known as SPIs – Salmonella
Pathogenicity Islands) and five islands containing bacteriophages related genes have been reported [21,34].

In S. typhi CT18, Design-Island detected ninety seven 'putative GIs' in the first phase, and after refinement, these
islands are broken into two hundreds and twenty-one statistically significant genomic segments that include all of
the GIs detected in the previous studies. Major genes contained in these segments code for phage proteins, putative
pathogenicity island proteins, virulence associated secretory protein, Vi polysaccharide proteins, integrase, phage
integrase, putative bacteriophage proteins, IS element
transposases, flagellar proteins, UV protection protein,
type III secretion system, type III restriction-modification
system, killing factor KicA and B, different chains of
NADH dehydrogenase and heat shock proteins. Among
the newly detected genomic segments, the major genes
present are those, which code for putative toxin like proteins, putative virulence proteins, putative phage proteins,
integrase, type III restriction modification system, some
pseudo genes, some transporters, flagellar biosynthetic
proteins and several accessory proteins, different chains of
NADH dehydrogenase and ATP synthase, penicillin binding protein, fimbrial subunits, lipopolysaccharide core
biosynthesis protein, heat shock and cold shock proteins.
Two 3D plots generated from the first phase of our algorithm and some representative 1D plots generated from
the refinement phase of the algorithm applied to the chromosome of S. typhi CT18 are shown here in Fig. 3A, B. The
first plot corresponds to the stretch of the chromosome
from the start of the chromosome up to 2.5 Mbp position
(Fig. 3A), and the other plot corresponds to the stretch of
the chromosome from 2.5 Mbp position up to the end
(Fig. 3B). Representative 1D plots for four of the 'putative
GIs' detected in the first phase and enclosed in gray blocks
are shown in the lower panel of the figures. The 'putative
GI' that stretches from 10000 to 52500 is fragmented into
three segments, namely 11000–28000 bp, 30000–41000
bp and 50000–52000 bp. The 'putative GI' that stretches
from 1006250 to 1070000 bp is fragmented into two segments, namely 1008250–1053250 bp and 1059250–

changes gradually from black to white with black corresponding to the extreme P-value = 0 and white corresponding to the
other extreme P-value = 1. The white dots corresponding to higher P-values are almost invisible in the white background while
dark dots corresponding to low P-values are prominently visible marking the GIs in the chromosome. Lower panel in each figure gives some representative 1D plots generated from the refinement phase for some of the 'putative GIs' (enclosed in gray

to 1940000 bp is fragmented into three segments, namely
1872500–1899500 bp, 1903500–1910500 bp and
1911500–1934500 bp (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 3B, the 1D plot
for the 'putative GI' that stretches from 4397500 to
4550000 bp is shown in the lower panel. This 'putative GI'
is fragmented into six segments, namely 4398500–
4401500 bp, 4402500–4407500 bp, 4408500–4441500
bp, 4442500–4510500 bp, 4511500–4542500 bp and
4544500–4549500 bp. The third, the fourth and the fifth
segments of the above mentioned 'putative GI' contain
mainly phage genes, some pseudo genes and the Vi
polysaccharide, which is the major virulence determinant
in S. typhi. After running the refinement phase, the genes
excluded from the above mentioned 'putative GIs' are
mainly DNA polymerase III, theta subunit, transcriptional
activator protein, putative transcriptional regulator, exo-

deoxyribonuclease X, ribosome modulation factor (protein E), possible sulfatase regulatory protein, serine/
threonine protein phosphatase 1, putative ion and/or
amino acid symporter, aminopeptidase N and some
hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins.
Performance comparison with other methods
For performance assessment of Design-Island, a dataset of
1560 manually curated putative horizontally transferred
genes in S. typhi CT18, generated by Vernikos et al. [21]
were used. S. typhi CT18 is a well-studied prokaryote in
terms of its HGT events. Vernikos et al. [21] selected S.
typhimurium LT2 as a sister lineage to S. typhi, and the
genome of E. coli K12 was chosen as an outgroup of S.
typhi and S. typhimurium. Their main idea was that the
genes present in all the three genomes form a set of core
genes, while the rest of the genes represent either species

or strain specific genes, and thus they may be considered
as putative HTGs (keeping in mind the fact that not all the
putative HTGs are horizontally acquired; some putative
HTGs may arise from gene gain in one genome and gene
loss in the other). The sensitivity (SN), the specificity (SP)
and the accuracy (AC) of Design-Island have been compared with those of six other methods available in the literature, namely W8 [20], IslandPath-GC (based on GC
composition), IslandPath-DB (based on di-nucleotide
bias) [35], Islander [11], HGT-DB [36] and IVOM [21].
The results are summarized in Fig. 4 accompanied with its
data table. The sensitivity of Design-Island is the highest
(70%) among the methods considered for comparison,
the second in the list being IVOM (64.9%). Regarding the
accuracy also, the Design-Island is in the highest position
with an accuracy = 76.6%, and IVOM is in the second
position with an accuracy = 76.4%. The third method in
the list is W8 with accuracy = 75.4%. The specificity of
Design-Island (64.2%) is comparable with that of IVOM
(65.3%) and W8 (64.3%). However, the specificity of
Design-Island is low when compared with that of HGT-DB
(78.9%) and Islander (75.5%). Note that Design-Island,
IVOM and W8 predicted a much larger number of putative horizontally transferred genes compared to the
number of such horizontally transferred genes predicted
by HGT-DB and Islander, and this largely explains the
behaviour of different methods in terms of their accuracies as pointed out by earlier authors [21].

Co-ordinates of the detected segments and the percentages of the genome covered by (i) the 'putative islands'
identified in the first phase of the algorithm, (ii) genomic
segments detected after the refinement phase are given in
Additional file 1. Further, in the last column of Additional
file 1, the genes included in our identified segments along
with the percentage of those genes in the entire collection
of genes present in the annotated chromosome are presented. The percentages of HTGs identified by different
methods are reported in Additional file 2.
Ribosomal proteins and many other highly expressed
genes tend to deviate compositionally from the genomic
background. However, those genes may have limited
mobility, and they may not transfer across species [37].
For this reason, ribosomal proteins, other highly
expressed genes with biased compositions and the
stretches with heavy loads of ribosomal proteins are
excluded from the segments obtained in the refinement
phase of the algorithm following a similar approach taken
by some earlier authors [20,36].

Conclusion
The method proposed and discussed in this paper is an
unsupervised method in the sense that it does not require
any training dataset to begin with. The method uses
Monte-Carlo statistical tests that are implemented using
randomly sampled segments, and normal critical values
are used for the test statistic. In many of the earlier methods, no statistical test has been performed, and in some
cases, where statistical tests were carried out, the determination of the critical values and the P-values were not adequately justified due to lack of rigorous statistical
distribution theory. In Design-Island, such difficulties are
effectively overcome by using Monte-Carlo statistical tests
based on randomly selected segments from a chromosome.
We have carried out an elaborate comparative analysis
involving different bacterial genomes, and it demonstrates that the performance of Design-Island is often comparable to many other well known methods in terms of
their sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Further, in some
cases, Design-Island outperforms many of those competing methods.

Design-Island can detect new segments of bacterial
genomes as parts of some GIs that might have been
missed by earlier methods. For example, in the case of S.
typhi CT18, Design-Island has predicted some pathogenic
or pathogenicity related genes like putative virulence proteins, putative phage proteins, integrase as horizontally
acquired materials that were not detected by earlier methods.
