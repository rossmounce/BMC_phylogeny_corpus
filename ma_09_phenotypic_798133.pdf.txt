Abstract
Background: HIV-1 CRF07_BC recombinant previously circulated mainly among the intravenous
drug users (IDUs) in Xinjiang province of China and is currently spreading in the entire country.
The aim of this study is to characterize the genotypic and phenotypic properties of HIV-1
CRF07_BC isolates in comparison with those of the subtype B' (Thailand B) which is prevalent in
the former plasma donors (FPDs) in China.
Results: Twelve HIV-1 CRF07_BC variants were isolated from the blood of the HIV-1-infected
IDUs in Xinjiang province, and 20 subtype B' isolates were obtained from the FPDs in Anhui and
Shanxi provinces of China. All the CRF07_BC viruses utilized CCR5 co-receptor, whereas 12
subtype B' viruses were R5-tropic, and the remaining B' isolates were dual (R5X4) tropic.
CRF07_BC viruses had lower net charge value in the V3 loop and exhibited slower replication
kinetics than subtype B' viruses. The number and location of the potential N-linked glycosylation
sites in V1/V2 and the C2 region of the CRF07_BC viruses were significantly different from those
of the subtype B' viruses.
Conclusion: The HIV-1 CRF07_BC recombinant strains with relatively lower net charges in the
V3 loop exclusively utilize CCR5 co-receptor for infection and exhibit slow replication kinetics in
the primary target cells, suggesting that CRF07_BC may be superior over B' and other HIV-1
subtypes in initiating infection in high-risk population. These findings have molecular implications
for the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 circulating in China and the design of tailored therapeutic
strategy for treatment of HIV-1 CRF07_BC infection.

Background

Results

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
which has high genetic diversity is classified into groups
M, N, and O. The group M viruses that are responsible for
the global AIDS epidemic have been further categorized
into nine HIV-1 genetic subtypes – A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J,
and K, as well as more than 34 circulating recombinant
forms (CRFs) [1]. The recombinants may have enhanced
fitness over their parental strains, resulting in increased
pathogenicity [2,3]. In addition, a high prevalence of
intersubtype recombinants (ISR) has also been reported
in some areas [4].

Sample population
The HIV-1 CRF07_BC and B' isolates were obtained from
the blood of pre-selected HIV-1-infected patients, who
participated in a multicenter AIDS Cohort Study in China
during 2003–2005. All patients signed an individual
informed consent form before blood collection. This
study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics
Committee of Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention in China. To obtain the representative
CRF07_BC isolates, we conducted Neighbor-joining
genetic analysis CRF07_BC env sequences obtained from
the plasma samples of 124 HIV-1-infected patients using

In late 1980s, initial HIV-1 epidemic among intravenous
drug users (IDUs) in Yunnan province, in the southwest
of China, was caused by a mixture of subtype B and Thai
subtype B (B'), but the B' subtype became dominate in the
middle of the 1990s [5]. At the same time, subtype C
viruses from India were also circulating among the IDUs,
causing another HIV-1 epidemic in that region [6]. Due to
the co-existence of the subtypes B' and C, some CRFs of
HIV-1, e.g. CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC, formed and gradually predominated among the IDUs in Yunnan and
Guangxi provinces, in southern China [7]. The appearance of CRF forms of HIV-1 in China indicates that the
viruses are evolving dynamically [8]. Interestingly, the
subtype B' viruses spread from Yunnan province to
Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Shanxi provinces, all located in
central China, among the former plasma donors (FPDs),
while the CRF07_BC viruses spread among the IDUs
along the drug-trafficking routes to Xinjiang province, in
the northwest of China [9]. CRF07_BC was reported to be
responsible for more than 90% of the new HIV-1 infections in Xinjiang province [10]. Subsequently, CRF07_BC
has become one of the most commonly transmitted HIV1 subtypes across the country [6]. The latest national
molecular epidemiology survey (2001–2003) showed
that the prevalence of the HIV-1 CRF_BC has reached over
50%, compared with 30% in the first survey (1996–
1998); whereas the prevalence of HIV-1 B' subtype
showed a decrease from 48% in the first survey to 32% in
the second survey, due to the improvement of blood
safety [11].
The present study aims to characterize the genotype and
phenotype of HIV-1 CRF07_BC strains circulating in Xinjiang province, in comparison with those of the subtype B'
predominating in Anhui and Shanxi provinces. In doing
so, we hope to provide information for understanding the
adaptive evolution of HIV-1 CRF07_BC which could assist
in the choosing of proper antiretroviral therapy regimens
for treating patients infected by HIV-1 stains that are predominantly circulating in China.

PCR technique as previously described [10]. The phylogenetic tree was then constructed (Fig. 1). We selected 19
representative sequences of the viruses without epidemic
link and collected blood samples from the patients who
were infected by the corresponding viruses. From the cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in
these blood samples, we successfully isolated 14 viruses
with in vitro infectivity, but excluded two of them from
this study because these two viruses were obtained from
the patients who had used antiretroviral therapeutics
(ART) before. All the patients are intravenous drug users
(IDUs) from Xinjiang province of China. In a similar way,
we obtained 20 representative subtype B' isolates without
epidemical linkage from the blood samples of HIV-1infected patients who were former plasma donors (FPDs)
from Shanxi province (n = 3) and Anhui Province (n = 17)
of China and who have not experienced ART before. The
average age of the subjects was 36 (range: 27 – 49) years
old. 10 out of 12 (83.3%) patients infected by CRF07_BC
had a CD4 count > 200/l, and 3 of them (25%) had a
viral load < 104 copies/ml. By contrast, only 7 out of 20
(35%) patients infected by subtype B' virus showed a CD4

count > 200/l, and none of them (0%) had a viral load <
104 copies/ml (Table 1).
Genotypic characterization of the CRF07_BC gp120
HIV-1 gp120 sequences from 12 CRF07_BC and 20 subtype B' viruses were compared for their differences in the
number of positively charged amino acid residues in V3
loops, in the glycosylation variations in V3 loops, and in
the potential N-linked glycosylations in other variable
loops.
The CRF07_BC viruses have lower net charge value in the
gp120 V3 loops than those from the subtype B' viruses
The net charge value of the V3 loop in gp120 of the
CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses was calculated by subtracting the number of the negatively charged amino acids
[aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E)] from the number
of positively charged amino acids [arginine (R) and lysine
(K)]. Among the 12 CRF07_BC viruses, all had the GPGQ
motif in the V3 loop. No positively charged amino acid
residues were found at positions 11 and 25. The net
charge value of the V3 loop ranged from 3 to 4 (3.17 ±

0.39), which is in agreement with our previous report
[12]. In the 20 subtype B' isolates, 5 had GPGK (25%), 2
had GPGQ (10%), and 13 had GPGR (65%) in their V3
loops. There were four and one positively charged amino
acids at position 11 and 25, respectively. The net charge
value of the V3 loop was in a range from 3 to 6 (4.5 ±
0.93) for R5/X4 virus and in a range from 3 to 5 (3.92 ±
0.51) for R5 virus (Table 2). Overall, the net charge value
of the V3 loop of CRF07_BC virus was significantly lower
than that in the subtype B' R5/X4 virus (P = 0.0003) and
R5 virus (P = 0.0006). There was no significant difference
in the net charge value of the V3 loop between subtype B'
R5/X4 and R5 viruses (Fig. 2).
There is no significant difference in the frequency of the
potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the gp120 V3 loop
between CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses
The major glycosylation site, NNT, in the V3 loop (N301)
was found in all 12 CRF07_BC viruses and in 19 of the 20
subtype B' viruses (Table 2). These results indicated that
there is no difference in the V3 loop glycosylation sites
between CRF07_BC and B' subtype viruses (P > 0.05).
There is a significant difference in the number and location
of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in C2 and V1/V2
regions of gp120 between CRF07_BC and subtype B'
viruses
The number and location of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the V1–V5 regions in gp120 of the
CRF07_ BC and subtype B' viruses were analyzed. The
results showed that the frequency of the potential N-glyc-

Comparison of the net charge of V3 loops between
CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses. The net charge of
the V3 loop of CRF07_BC virus (3.17 ± 0.39) is significantly
lower than both of the subtype B' R5/X4 virus (4.5 ± 0.93, P
= 0.0003) and subtype B' R5 virus (3.92 ± 0.51, P = 0.0006),

osylation sites in the C2 region, particularly at the positions of N230, N234 and N295, was significantly different
(P = 0.003) between CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses
(Fig. 3 and 4). There was also a significant difference in the
frequency of N-glycosylation sites, including N130, N133,
N136, N144, and N186 in the V1/V2 region between the
CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses (Fig. 5)
Characterization of the CRF07_BC phenotype –
CRF07_BC viruses exclusively utilize CCR5 co-receptor for
infection while subtype B' viruses are R5-tropic or dualtropic
Using GHOST cell-based assay, we detected the co-receptor usage of the CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses. We
found all 12 CRF07_BC viruses used the CCR5 co-receptor
for infection, while 8 out of the 20 subtype B' isolates were
dual-tropic (R5/X4-tropic), and the remaining B' viruses
were R5-tropic. None of the viruses exclusively used the
CXCR4 co-receptor for infection (Table 2).
There is no significant difference in the infectivity between
CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses
The infectivity of the CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses
were compared using a single-cycle infectivity assay with
GHOST cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR4 as previously
described [13]. As shown in Fig. 6, the infectivity of
CRF07_BC strains (mean 10.3% GFP+ cells) was slightly
higher than that of subtype B' with R5/X4 (mean 5% GFP+
cells) and R5 viruses (mean 6% GFP+ cells), but there was
no significant difference among these three groups.
HIV-1 CRF07_BC viruses have slower replication kinetics
than subtype B' viruses
The replication kinetics of CRF07_BC and subtype B'
viruses were analyzed in PBMC cultures. The same viral
input from each isolate was added to the PHA-activated
PBMCs from healthy blood donors. The culture supernatants were collected for detection of p24 production on
days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days post-infection. But for
subtype B' R5X4 virus, no further collection of the culture
supernatants was done after 10 days of viral infection
because the replication of this virus at its peak time
resulted in significant cytopathic effect (CPE) on the
PBMCs in the culture. As shown in Fig. 7, the replication
kinetic of CRF07_BC isolates (peaking at day 21) was significantly slower than that of subtype B' isolates (peaking
at day 7).

Discussion
HIV-1 enters its target cell through a series of steps, including the interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) surface subunit gp120 with the CD4 molecule
and a chemokine co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the
target cell, and the subsequent conformational change of
the Env transmembrane subunit gp41 [14]. The viruses

using CCR5 and CXCR4 are designated R5 and X4, respectively [15]. HIV-1 co-receptor usage is associated with viral
tropism, pathogenesis, and disease progression because
viruses that utilize CCR5 (R5) initiate infections, while
viruses that use CXCR4 (X4) emerge later in HIV-1
infected individuals to herald accelerated disease progression. The molecular alterations associated with the R5-toX4 switch of CRF07_BC recombinant viruses in vivo and
their biological manifestations have been reported[16].
In the present study, we found that all 12 HIV-1 isolates
from the blood of IDUs were CRF07_BC R5 viruses,
including those from patients with low CD4 counts. In
contrast, all 20 isolates from the blood of FPDs were subtype B' viruses, including 12 R5 and 8 dual-tropic (R5X4)
viruses. The net positive charge value of V3 loop in the
gp120 of CRF07_BC was significantly lower than that in
the subtype B' R5 and R5X4 viruses. It is well known that

the net positive charge of the V3 loop plays a critical role
in determining viral co-receptor tropism and pathogenesis. The V3 loops of R5-tropic viruses generally have a
lower net positive charge than those of X4 [17-19]. The
introduction of a few of positively charged residues (e.g.
Arg) in the V3 results in the switch of the viral co-receptor
tropism from R5 to X4 [20], and this switch from R5 to X4
tropism has been associated with more rapid clinical progression to AIDS. Furthermore, the net positive charge of
the V3 loop also plays a key role in the immunological
escape and co-receptor tropism evolution of HIV-1 in vivo
because the viruses with less net positive charges in their
V3 loop become more resistant to the anti-V3 neutralizing
antibodies [21]. This selective force is continuously
enriching the R5 viruses during long-lasting persistent
infection. The relatively low net charge in the V3 loop of
the CRF07_BC strain may contribute to its R5 tropism for

mean ± SD.

CRF07_BC strains (Fig. 2). Particularly, the frequency of
N230 in the B' strains is remarkably higher than that in
the CRF07_BC strains. However, the frequency of N234 in
the B' strains is lower than that in the CRF07_BC strains
(Fig. 3). Notably, more than 80% of the B' strains show
the N295 glycosylation site, while this site was absent in
all CRF07_BC strains (Fig. 3). This observation is consistent with the report by Khan et al. [25] who found that
N295 was absent in the HIV-1 subtype C isolates from
India. Loss of N295 may affect CD4 binding since the
N448-linked G2 glycan is flanked on each side by N295linked and N262-linked glycans, and these three glycans
protrude to form a cluster of sugar recognized by the CD4
molecule. Therefore, loss of the N295-linked glycan may
result in disruption of the binding site for CD4 [26]. It has
been reported that 2G12, a broadly neutralizing human
mAb that specifically binds to a carbohydrate-dependent
epitope on gp120, is generally ineffective against HIV-1
subtype C isolates [27]. The absence of an N-linked glycan
at position 295 is correlated with resistance to 2G12
because replacement of N295 with alanine resulted in a
significant decrease in 2G12 binding affinity to gp120
[28]. This suggests that the HIV-1 B' and CRF07_BC
strains may have different sensitivity to the neutralizing
antibodies that recognize the carbohydrate-dependent
epitopes on gp120.
There is also a significant difference in the number of Nlinked glycosylation sites in the V1V2 regions of the gp120

between the HIV-1 B' and CRF07_BC strains. The frequency of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the
gp120 V1V2 regions (N130, N136, N144, and N186) of
the HIV-1 B' strains is significantly higher than that in the
same regions of the CRF07_BC strains, but the frequency
of N133 in B' strains is markedly lower than that in
CRF07_BC strains (Fig. 4). These results suggest a difference in the number and location of the potential N-linked
glycosylation sites in the V1/V2 regions of gp120 between
the HIV-1 CRF07_BC and B' strains which may be relevant
to their co-receptor usage. Previous studies have shown
the potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the V1/V2
regions and those proximal to the V3 loops of gp120 were
functionally critical because the carbohydrate moieties in
these regions play essential roles in retaining the appropriate conformation of the variable loops for optimal interaction with the receptor and co-receptors [29]. Mutations
in or near V1/V2 may compensate for the deleterious V3
mutations and may need to precede V3 mutations to permit virus survival.
Although no significant difference in the infectivity
between CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses was observed
in this study, the replication kinetic of CRF07_BC variants
is slower than that of subtype B' viruses. The relatively low
replication kinetic of CRF07_BC viruses may not be attributed to its R5-tropism because both subtype B' R5 and
R5X4 viruses have faster replication kinetics than that of
CRF07_BC. It is unclear whether the replication kinetics
and co-receptor usage of CRF07_BC are associated with its
virulence since a majority (10 out of 12) of the patients
infected by CRF07_BC participated in this study had a
CD4 count > 200/l, while only 7 out of 20 patients
infected with subtype B' showed a CD4 count > 200/l.
Further study is warranted to investigate whether the variable frequency of the N-linked glycosylation sties in V1V2
and C2 region may contribute to the difference in the coreceptor usage and the replication kinetics between
CRF07_BC and subtype B' viruses.
In conclusion, this study, for the first time, characterizes
the genotypic and phenotypic properties of HIV-1
CRF07_BC strains circulating in Xinjiang province of
China, in comparison with those of the HIV-1 subtype B'.
The HIV-1 CRF07_BC viruses have lower net charge in V3
loop of gp120, exclusively utilize CCR5 co-receptor for
infection, and exhibit slower replication kinetics than the
subtype B' viruses. This study thus provides important
information for understanding the molecular evolution of
the Env sequences of the HIV-1 strains circulating in different geographic regions in China. This understanding
could assist in the rational design of appropriate therapeutic regimens to treat HIV-1-infected patients in the corresponding regions in China.

Methods
Virus isolation
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood of the HIV-1-infected patients and
healthy donors using Ficoll-Paque gradient (Amersham
Biosciences; Uppsala, Sweden). The patients' PBMCs were
co-cultured with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated
PBMCs from healthy donors. The cell cultures were maintained for 4 weeks in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) containing 20 U/ml of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2), 1%
penicillin and streptomycin (P/S), 2 mM glutamine and
10% FBS and the culture media were changed twice a
week. The culture supernatants were collected for detection of HIV-1 p24 production using a commercial
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Vironostika HIV-1 Microelisa system; BioMérieux; Marcy
l'Etoile, France) and those containing p24 antigen > 1 ng/
ml were aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen until used
[30].
Sequence analysis of the HIV-1 Env gp120
DNA was extracted from PBMCs infected by isolated
viruses using a DNA blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN; Hilden,
Germany). The sequences of the gp120 region were
amplified by a nested polymerase chain reaction (nestPCR) using the Gene Amp PCR System 9700 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) with the external
primers ED5/ED12 (5'-ATGGGATCAAAGCCTAAA GCC
ATGTG-3' and 5'-AGTGCTTCCT GCTGCTCC CA-3') at
94°C, 3 min; 50°C, 1 min; and 72°C, 1.5 min for 3 cycles;
then 94°C, 15 s; 50°C, 45 s; and 72°C, 1 min for 32
cycles, followed by 72°C for 10 min for a final extension.
The second round PCR was performed with the internal
primers ENV7/ENV8 (5'-CTGTTAAATGGCAGTCTAGC3'and 5'-CACTTCTCCAATTGTCCCTCA-3') at 94°C, 2
min; 55°C, 45 s; and 72°C, 1.5 min for 1 cycle; then
94°C, 30 s; 55°C, 30 s; and 72°C, 1 min for 30 cycles, followed by 72°C for 10 min for a final extension. PCR products were identified on an agarose gel by electrophoresis,
purified (Gel Extraction Kit, QIAGEN), sequenced on an
ABI 377 Sequencer (Applied Biosciences), and analyzed
using GCG Sequence Analysis software [31,32].
Detection of viral load (VL) and CD4+ cell count
Plasma VL was measured using an HIV-1 nucleotide fluorescence quantitative assay kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) with a lower detection limit (LDL) of 500
copies/ml. CD4+ cell counts were assessed by FACS analysis with the FACS/Lyse kit provided by BD Biosciences
[33].
Assays for virus co-receptor usage and assessment of
infectivity
GHOST cells that express CD4 and a chemokine receptor
CCR5 or CXCR4 were used for measuring the co-receptor

usage of the isolated viruses. The GHOST-R5 and GHOSTX4 cells (for R5 and X4 viruses, respectively) were seeded
in 24-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Spain) at 6 × 104
cells/well/0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) (HyClone; Logan, Utah, USA) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin plus streptomycin, Geneticin (500 g/ml), hygromycin (100 g/
ml) and puromycin (1 g/ml). On the following day, the
medium was removed, and the monolayers (about 70%
confluent) were infected with virus stocks (200 l/well) in
the presence of 8 g/ml DEAE-dextran to enhance infection efficiency. After 16–18 h incubation in a 37°C and
5% CO2 humidified environment, virus and DEAE-dextran were replaced with 1 ml media. Cells were harvested
4 days post-infection and the cell monolayers were
washed once again with PBS, re-suspended in 300 l of 1
mM EDTA in PBS, and fixed in paraformaldehyde at a
final concentration of 2%. GFP expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry (Elite ESP; Beckman Coulter). For
each test, the GHOST-R5 and -X4 cells infected with or
without SF33 were used as positive or negative controls,
respectively. The infectivity of primary viral isolates was
assessed in a single-cycle infectivity assay with GHOSTR5/X4 cells as described by Bleiber et al. [34]. Briefly, 4 ×
104 cells were infected in duplicate with 2 ng of p24 antigen equivalent of virus. A positive control and negative
control were included in each experiment to assess interassay variation and cell autofluorescence. The infectivity
of the primary HIV-1 isolates was quantified based on the
proportion of GFP-expressing cells determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting at 24 h post-infection [35].
Determination of viral replication kinetics
Replication kinetics of the HIV-1 CRF07_BC and B' isolates were compared. Briefly, each of the viral isolates was
inoculated with an equal viral input (2 ng p24) into 5 ×
106 PHA-stimulated PBMCs obtained from HIV-seronegative blood donors. After incubation at 37°C overnight, the
cells were washed and re-suspended in complete medium
supplemented with recombinant interleukin-2. The cultures were maintained for three weeks and the culture
media were changed twice a week. Culture supernatants
were collected every two to three days for measuring p24
antigen production by using ELISA kits (Coulter Beckman)[30].
Statistical analysis
The gp120 V3 loop positive charges of the different subtypes were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Student's t test was used in the statistical analysis. The difference in glycosylation between subtype B' and
CRF07_BC viruses was compared using the 2 test
(Fisher's exact probability). All P values are two-sided, and
a P value of <0.05 was considered significant. All statistical
analyses were performed with the SPSS10.0 software.
