Evolutionary relationships of the old world fruit
bats (Chiroptera, Pteropodidae): Another star
phylogeny?
Francisca C Almeida1,2,3*, Norberto P Giannini1,4, Rob DeSalle2 and Nancy B Simmons1

Abstract
Background: The family Pteropodidae comprises bats commonly known as megabats or Old World fruit bats.
Molecular phylogenetic studies of pteropodids have provided considerable insight into intrafamilial relationships,
but these studies have included only a fraction of the extant diversity (a maximum of 26 out of the 46 currently
recognized genera) and have failed to resolve deep relationships among internal clades. Here we readdress the
systematics of pteropodids by applying a strategy to try to resolve ancient relationships within Pteropodidae, while
providing further insight into subgroup membership, by 1) increasing the taxonomic sample to 42 genera; 2)
increasing the number of characters (to >8,000 bp) and nuclear genomic representation; 3) minimizing missing
data; 4) controlling for sequence bias; and 5) using appropriate data partitioning and models of sequence
evolution.
Results: Our analyses recovered six principal clades and one additional independent lineage (consisting of a single
genus) within Pteropodidae. Reciprocal monophyly of these groups was highly supported and generally congruent
among the different methods and datasets used. Likewise, most relationships within these principal clades were
well resolved and statistically supported. Relationships among the 7 principal groups, however, were poorly
supported in all analyses. This result could not be explained by any detectable systematic bias in the data or
incongruence among loci. The SOWH test confirmed that basal branches’ lengths were not different from zero,
which points to closely-spaced cladogenesis as the most likely explanation for the poor resolution of the deep
pteropodid relationships. Simulations suggest that an increase in the amount of sequence data is likely to solve
this problem.
Conclusions: The phylogenetic hypothesis generated here provides a robust framework for a revised cladistic
classification of Pteropodidae into subfamilies and tribes and will greatly contribute to the understanding of
character evolution and biogeography of pteropodids. The inability of our data to resolve the deepest relationships
of the major pteropodid lineages suggests an explosive diversification soon after origin of the crown pteropodids.
Several characteristics of pteropodids are consistent with this conclusion, including high species diversity, great
morphological diversity, and presence of key innovations in relation to their sister group.

Background
The family Pteropodidae comprises 186 currently recognized species commonly known as Old World fruit bats
or megabats, and as such constitutes one of the largest
families of the order Chiroptera (Mammalia) [1]. The

some pteropodid species, which can reach over 1 kilogram in weight and have a wingspan of over 1.5 meters
[2]. Pteropodids are almost exclusively phytophagous,
feeding mostly on fruits, although some species are specialized for nectar feeding. As a group, pteropodids are
primary dispersers of pollen and seeds in the Old World

occurring on many islands from the Indian Ocean to the
Western Pacific Ocean, where some species are highly
endangered and in risk of extinction [1,3]. Unlike other
bat families, members of Pteropodidae do not use laryngeal echolocation, instead relying primarily on vision
and olfaction to avoid obstacles and locate food sources.
Phylogenetic relationships of Pteropodidae have been
the source of considerable debate. In the 1990s a controversy developed over whether or not Chiroptera was
monophyletic or instead composed of two different evolutionary lineages (Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera)
that achieved powered flight independently from origins
within different parts of the mammalian family tree (see
[4], and references cited therein). Comprehensive analyses of morphological and molecular data refuted this
hypothesis and confirmed bat monophyly [5-8] but analyses of DNA sequence data revealed a surprise - some
“microbats” were in fact more closely related to Pteropodidae than to the remaining Microchiroptera families
[9,10]. This led to a revision of higher-level bat taxonomy that saw Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera discarded
and
two
new
groups
recognized,
Yinpterochiroptera (for Pteropodidae and its close relatives, echolocating bats of the superfamily Rhinolophoidea) and Yangochiroptera (for the remaining
echolocating bats) [11].
All of these higher-level studies confirmed monophyly
of Pteropodidae, but considerable confusion has
remained concerning relationships within this clade.
Contra traditional classifications (e.g., [12]), early molecular phylogenies of the group discovered that nectarfeeding megabats did not constitute a single monophyletic group, but instead various nectar-feeding genera
were related to different fruit-feeding lineages (e.g.,
[8,13]). These relationships were formally recognized in
the classification of Bergmans [14], who divided the
group into six extant subfamilies and several tribes

Page 2 of 17

(Table 1). Subsequent phylogenetic studies of pteropodids have further questioned or strongly refuted commonly recognized groupings (subfamilies, tribes), and
identified new, novel groupings of taxa [13,15-21]. The
most comprehensive studies to date based on molecular
sequence data included 26 genera and were based
mostly on mitochondrial genes including 12S rRNA, 16S
rRNA and the Cytochrome b gene plus a small sample of
nuclear data (~400 bp of the oncogene cmos) [18,19].
Giannini and Simmons [19] confirmed the monophyly
of Pteropodidae and of many higher-level taxa defined
by Bergmans [14] (e.g., Pteropodini, Macroglossini, Dobsoniini, Epomophorinae, Epomophorini, Myonycterini,
Cynopterinae). Nevertheless, support values for some
nodes were low and resolution was poor in several parts
of the tree. The weakest part of the phylogeny was one
of the most critical parts – the backbone, which ideally
should show how the various higher-level groups are
related to one another [19]. Basal relationships among
subfamilies and tribes were discordant among different
data treatments and generally received low statistical
support. For this reason, questions still remain regarding
relationships within and between major pteropodid
clades.
Lack of resolution along the backbone of a phylogenetic tree can result from sampling bias (or stochastic
bias), systematic bias, or a combination of both [22].
Sampling bias occurs when a data set does not contain
enough information to allow full resolution of taxon
relationships, either due to inadequate taxonomic sampling or lack of phylogenetic signal in the sampled loci
[23-26]. Both factors could have influenced previous
phylogenetic analyses of megabats, which were based
mostly on mitochondrial loci that may be saturated with
substitutions at the tribal/subfamily level [27]. Incompleteness of taxonomic sampling, which may contribute to
poor phylogenetic results particularly at higher

taxonomic levels, clearly could have played a role in
pteropodid analyses, as only 26 out of the 46 pteropodid
genera currently recognized (57%) were represented in
the largest, previous molecular studies. Another type of
bias, known as systematic bias, is caused by non-phylogenetic noise in the sequences such as differences in
base composition (causing unrelated taxa with similar
base composition to erroneously cluster together) and/
or substitution rate (causing long-branch attraction) (e.
g. [28,29]). Because these types of variation violate the
assumptions of most reconstruction methods, they are
also potential causes for inaccuracy and poor resolution
in phylogenetic trees [22,30,31]. Moreover, sampling
bias and systematic bias may synergistically interact,
compounding their effects on the outcome of phylogenetic inference [26]. None of these potential sources of
systematic bias have been addressed in previous phylogenetic studies on megabats.
An alternative explanation for low resolution of relationships on a phylogenetic tree is that, instead of being
a consequence of bias or methodological artifacts, it
reflects the true evolutionary history of the group. Rapid
diversification of a clade over a short period of time
may cause such a phylogenetic pattern, as has been
claimed for the origin of the mammalian [32,33] and
avian orders [34,35]. If diversification took place quickly
and long time ago, there may be little phylogenetic signal because slowly-evolving genes may not have accrued
many changes (due to the short time span) while fasterevolving genes may have initially picked up changes, but
these were then overwritten by subsequent sequence
evolution. Also, short time interval between cladogenetic
events may hinder complete lineage sorting, confounding relationships within that time frame [36]. Such trees,
with very short internal branches connected to the root,
are also known as star phylogenies (e.g. [37,38]).
Here we present a comprehensive study of the phylogenetic relationships among megabat genera based on a
large DNA-sequence dataset. Our focus was on resolving tribal membership and relationships among subfamilies. We attempted to address potential sources of
bias in the phylogenetic reconstruction of this group,
including low number of informative characters, missing
data, poor taxonomic sampling, and sequence bias. This
was accomplished by obtaining new sequences for four
nuclear loci, thus significantly increasing taxonomic
sampling, and by filling in gaps in sequence data from
mitochondrial loci that had been previously sequenced
in megabats by collecting new data from the additional
taxa available to us. The inclusion of additional taxa not
only adds important information on variation but can
also help break up long branches, thus improving phylogenetic accuracy and helping resolve clades that may
remain ambiguous with smaller taxon samples

[23,39-41]. The simultaneous analysis of several genes
has the obvious advantage of increasing the number of
phylogenetically informative characters and balancing
stochastic errors [42-48], but can also reduce the effects
of systematic bias that may affect individual gene partitions, especially when locus-specific substitution models
are employed in a probabilistic framework [31,49-51].
To minimize the effects of various potential sources of
error in our analyses, detailed phylogenetic analyses
were conducted using tests for systematic sequence bias,
different reconstruction methods, optimal data partitioning in maximum likelihood analyses, and topology comparisons based on data simulations. Our results defined
7 well-supported groups for a new, cladistic classification of pteropodids, in several points different from the
last formal classification by Bergmans [14]. The most
basal relationships within Pteropodidae, however, could
not be fully resolved despite the increase in the amount
of data and the use of careful phylogenetic analyses.
This result could not be explained by any source of
measurable sequence bias, pointing to a biological cause
for the observed pattern.

Results
Sequence data statistics

To minimize the effects of missing data on tree resolution [52], we first focused on a dataset that included 51
pteropodid species for which at least four of the six
sequence fragments (RAG1, RAG2, vWF, BRCA1, Cytb,
and 12S16S) used in this study were available (dataset
1). The combined alignment of dataset 1 was 8181bp
long, yielding 2504 parsimony informative sites. Details
of sequence statistics of dataset 1 in the combined and
per loci matrices are shown in Table 2. A saturation
plot of the combined dataset (ingroup only, without taxa
with missing one or more loci) did not show signs of
substitution saturation (Additional file 1), which was
confirmed by a statistical test for saturation (Iss = 0.645,
Iss.cSym = 0.844, p < 0.0001) [53].
Despite differences among genes and codon positions,
we found relative homogeneity in GC content among
pteropodid taxa (Additional file 2). The c2 test failed to

detect significant differences in either entire genes or
individual codon positions. We also checked for similarities and differences in GC content among the principal
clades of Pteropodidae that could bias the resolution of
the relationships among them (Additional file 2). Except
for the 3rd codon position of the Cytb locus, GC content
showed little among clade variation. Rates of nucleotide
substitution were also relatively homogeneous, with only
7 pairwise taxa comparisons showing significant differences. All these comparisons involved an outgroup
taxon compared with an ingroup taxon; no significant
rate differences could be detected within the ingroup
(Pteropodidae). Borderline p values were found in some
comparisons involving Balionycteris maculata, but not
in other pairwise comparisons. This result suggests the
long-branch attraction is not likely to have a major
effect in our phylogenetic results.
Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes

MP and ML analyses were run for each locus separately
(ML trees are available in the Additional file 3). Most
topological differences among resulting trees were seen
in basal relationships, but none was supported by > 60%
bootstrap, which suggests absence of incongruent phylogenetic signal among genes [54]. In a parsimony framework, the pairwise ILD tests did not detect significant
pairwise incongruence. The same result was obtained
with the likelihood based hierarchical test [55].
Maximum parsimony analyses of the combined dataset

The maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of the combined dataset 1 recovered one most parsimonious tree
with 15637 steps and consistency index of 0.334 (Figure
1). This tree showed a monophyletic Pteropodidae with
six well-supported internal clades and one independent
lineage. Some of these clades are congruent with previously proposed subfamilies, such as Cynopterinae [14],
Harpyionycterinae [21], and Nyctimeninae and tribes,
such as Pteropodini, Scotonycterini, Macroglossini, and
Epomophorini [14]. Basal relationships among these
seven main pteropodid groups, however, were resolved
with only low support in both Bremer decay values (<5)
and bootstrap precentages (<80%, Figure 1). To check
whether variation in GC content in 3rd codon position
of the Cytb gene could be affecting the results, we reanalyzed the data eliminating this partition from the
matrix (Additional file 4). The only difference in topology was that the African clade was the third pteropodid
clade to diverge instead of Pteropodini as shown in Figure 1, but basal relationships had even lower support.

compared several alternative schemes under the GTR
model, based on their AIC/AICc and BIC scores (Table
3). The trees obtained with those different schemes
recovered the same principal clades as the MP tree, only
varying the relationships among them (Additional file
5). Given the small improvement in AIC and BIC scores
in partition scheme 7 as compared to scheme 6, we analyzed both schemes under optimal substitution models
for each partition. Optimal substitution models were
selected using AICc for the different partitions in
schemes 6 and 7 (Additional file 6). The analyses based
on partition schemes 6 and 7 resulted in the same
topology, very similar to ML topology B (obtained with
scheme 6 and the GTR+Γ model applied across all partitions, Additional file 5), which we will call henceforth
optimal ML tree (Figure 2). The only difference between
these two topologies is the position of Eidolon: while in
topology B Eidolon appears as the most basal branch, in
the optimal ML tree it appears as the second most basal
branch with cynopterines occupying the most basal
position. Branch support was assessed using partition
scheme 6, since this scheme had fewer parameters and
comparable results in both likelihood scores and topology to those obtained with partition scheme 7. The
basal relationships within Pteropodidae again had no
statistical support. The principal clades and clades
within those, however, received substantial support, with
very few bootstrap values below 80% (Figure 2). Similarly to results in MP analyses, removal of the 3rd codon
position of the Cytb partition did not affect the results
(Additional file 4).
Topology comparisons

The principal Pteropodidae clades were well defined and
supported by all the different phylogenetic analyses we
conducted. However, there was considerable disagreement among analyses concerning relationships among
these clades. To decide whether one particular arrangement could be justifiably preferred to others, we carried
out a series of topology comparison tests. On a MP framework, we found the optimal ML tree (tree length =
15670) to be significantly worse than the MP tree (tree
length = 15636) by both the KH (p = 0.007) and the TN
(p = 0.006) tests. On the other side, neither test distinguished the MP tree from ML topology B (tree length =
15647). We did the same comparisons in a ML framework using the SH and the AU tests, but no significant
likelihood differences were found among the different
hypotheses.

same result (only two nodes at 5% significance; Table 4).
These results are in agreement with the idea that a substantial increase in the amount of data allows resolving
splits that happen in a very short period of time. To
determine how much sequence data would be necessary
to resolve each of the basal nodes we simulated datasets
of 10 kb, 12 kb, and 14 kb based on the best tree, using
the same sequence parameters of the original combined
dataset. The best trees obtained for the simulated datasets were then compared with trees derived from the
best tree but with each of the basal nodes collapsed
separately. Significant resolution of basal nodes as measured by pSH < 0.01 would be obtained with 10 kb for
node D, 12 kb for nodes C and E, and 14 kb for nodes
A and B (Figure 3, Figure 2).
The position of additional genera

Combined dataset 2 included five additional genera for
which data were available for only one or two mitochondrial loci; the dataset thus includes 56 ingroup taxa and
five outgroup taxa. The MP analysis of dataset 2 resulted
in six equally parsimonious trees with 16389 steps. The
consensus tree has again Eidolon as the most basal pteropodid and a polytomy including all other principal clades
as recovered in our analyses of dataset 1 (Figure 4). Most
of the extra genera included in dataset 2 fell in clades
according to expectations based on the most current
classification of Pteropodidae [14,21], with the exception
of Notopteris. Most of the relationships involving the
additional taxa, however, had low or no statistical

support. To analyze dataset 2 using ML methods, we
used partition scheme 6 and the same optimal models as
in our analysis of dataset 1. The resulting tree showed
very similar relationships for the additional taxa as compared to the MP tree (Figure 5). The main difference was
in the close relationships of Pteralopex, although the
principal clade in which it fell was the same.
Biogeographic analysis

The objective of our biogeographic analyses was to infer
ancestral areas for the main pteropodid clades that
appeared consistently across analyses. Because of missing taxa, a thorough analysis of the biogeographic history of pteropodids would not be accurate. Thus, we
used DIVA [56] to infer ancestral areas for the clade
containing all the pteropodids plus the six principal
clades. These results were plotted on the ML tree
obtained for dataset 2 (Figure 5). New Guinea and Melanesia Islands (area H) appear as a possible ancestral
area for most internal clades, with the only exception
being cynopterines. The results for the Cynopterinae
subfamily agree with our previous analyses, indicating
that this clade had its origins most likely in the Sundaic
region [27]. Another interesting result is the origin of
the clade formed by African genera, Rousettus, and
Eonycteris. Although different area combinations have
similar probabilities of being the ancestral area of that
group, the African continent does appear as one of
them, while all other alternatives are area combinations
that include Africa.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships and systematics of
pteropodids

Here we present the most complete ever analysis of the
evolutionary relationships of pteropodid bats using a
number of reconstruction and statistical approaches.
The phylogenetic trees presented here, independently of

the reconstruction method employed or the partition
analyzed (from individual genes to combined data),
almost unanimously recovered six principal clades and
one independent lineage (Eidolon), variously joined by
versions of a poorly supported backbone. By contrast,
relationships of genera within each of those principal
clades were generally consistent and in agreement across

the different analyses performed. Some of the principal
pteropodid clades recovered in our trees are congruent
with previously proposed subfamilies, such as Cynopterinae [14], Harpyionycterinae [21], and Nyctimeninae [14].

The other three main clades, represented by Macroglossini, Epomophorinae + Rousettini, and Pteropodini +
Melonycteris (all groups sensu Bergmans [14]), were in
disagreement with previous classifications into subfamilies. Some of these discrepancies had already been
observed in previous studies, such as the clustering of
Epomophorinae + Rousettini [19].
The phylogeny of the subfamily Cynopterinae was
recently addressed by Almeida et al. [27]. The two
major cynopterine clades recovered in that study also
appeared as supported groups in all topologies recovered in our analyses, suggesting that these groupings are
stable to varying taxonomic sampling and character data
representation. Similarly, a recently recognized and
expanded group of megabats, Harpyionycterinae (see
[20,21]), was also recovered in this study. This heterogeneous group is formed by two clades, the dobsoniine or

Pteropodinae, as proposed by Bergmans [14]. In this study,
Pteropodinae was recovered as a clade composed of one
nectarivorous genus (Melonycteris) associated to flying
foxes and related megabats (Acerodon, Desmalopex,

Mirimiri, Pteralopex, Pteropus, and Styloctenium). The
exclusion of two genera (Mirimiri and Neopteryx) and the
lack of statistical support for some internal relationships
claim for a more detailed study of the pteropodines.

Almeida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:281
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/281

One major clade, including rousettines (excluding
Boneia as discussed earlier) and all African megabats
(excluding Eidolon as discussed earlier) was recovered
consistently and with high support across all analyses in
this study. Versions of this clade, although differing
somewhat in taxonomic sampling, have been consistently recovered since Hollar and Springer [13] first
investigated pteropodid relationships using molecular
methods [16,18,19]. This clade was originally highly controversial because the molecular data joined taxa from
disparate traditionally recognized taxonomic groupings:
rousettines (Eonycteris, Rousettus, and Stenonycteris) and
epomophorines (the remainder of the African, except
for Eidolon) sensu Bergmans [14]. Giannini and Simmons [19], however, demonstrated morphological support for this now expanded “African clade”. It is
noteworthy that two other African genera, Scotonycteris
and Casinycteris, included in the Epomophorinae subfamily by Bergmans [14] and here for the first time
sampled in a molecular phylogenetic study, appeared as
sister to that clade in our analyses. This finding has
important biogeographic implications, pointing to an
African origin of this group as shown in the results of
the biogeographic analysis.
Eidolon is an unusual taxon that was the single megabat genus not linked to any other genera in a major
clade. To some extent, this is a somewhat unsurprising
result as affinities of Eidolon have always been contentious; however, it is remarkable that the observed placement of Eidolon does not seem to be an artifact from
primary data since no significant codon bias nor differences in evolutionary rates could explain this result.
Morphology tends to support an association of Eidolon
and other large megabats in the pteropodine clade [19].
A clade formed by Eidolon + Pteropodini, however, was
not represented in any of the trees obtained with the
combined dataset. This result suggests that the nonoverlapping distribution of Eidolon versus pteropodines
in continental Africa may have ecological and biogeographic rather than phylogenetic origin. Eidolon was
included in the Rousettinae subfamily by Bergmans [14],
but our results strongly suggest it should be in a separate subfamily by itself. It is possible that the Melanesian
genus Notopteris represents another case of independent
lineage, as suggested by the lack of statistical support
for its relationship with other pteropodid genera. As
only mitochondrial sequences were available for this
genus, additional data will be required to resolve the
affinities of Notopteris.
Despite general lack of agreement among partitions
and methods of analysis and statistical support for the
relationships of the principal pteropodid clades, two
groupings seem to be slightly favored. These two groupings received more than 50% bootstrap support in the

Page 11 of 17

optimal ML tree and appeared in a few other recovered
trees. One is the clustering of Macroglossini and Harpyionycterinae as sister clades also obtained in MP tree
and several of the suboptimal ML trees (Figure 4), with
maximum bootstrap support of 73%. The other is the
clade formed by Nyctimeninae and Pteropodini, which
received 64% bootstrap support in the optimal ML tree
and was also recovered in other ML trees (ML topologies B, C, D - Additional file 5), but did not appear in
the MP tree.
Basal polytomy

Evolutionary relationships that cannot be resolved in a
phylogenetic analysis may represent a soft or a hard
polytomy. A soft polytomy is the result of analytical
bias, while a hard polytomy illustrates biological phenomena such as an explosive radiation. Hard polytomies
are so called because can only be broken with a large
amount of data and careful analyses. Before indentifying
a hard polytomy it is necessary first to eliminate possible
bias that could cause a soft polytomy.
We were able to assemble a matrix with a wide genera
representation and relatively little missing data. The
concatenated matrix of six loci showed no signs of substitution saturation, and contained enough phylogenetic
signal to resolve a strongly supported monophyletic
Pteropodidae, the superfamily Rhinolophoidea sensu
Teeling et al. [57], and most ingroup relationships (37
out of 49) with bootstrap > 96% (43 with bootstrap >
70%). Detailed characterization of the data did not
uncover important systematic sequence bias that could
blur phylogenetic signal [58]– megabats were shown to
be relatively homogeneous in nucleotide composition at
most partitions and in evolutionary rates, and no significant conflicting phylogenetic signal was detected among
the different loci used. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses
under the ML framework using specific substitution
models for different partitions of the data most likely
accounted for any minor sequence bias that could have
affected the analyses [31,50,51,54,59].
Instead of having conflicting signal, the different loci
used in this study agreed in a general lack of resolution
at the base of the pteropodid tree. The results of the
SOWH test support that at least some of the basal
(inter subfamilies) relationships have zero-length
branches in one or more gene partitions, some of which
occurring across all partitions. As expected, an increase
in the amount of data (i.e. the combined dataset)
decreased the number of basal branches that could be
simultaneously collapsed without affecting likelihood
scores. Simulations of larger datasets suggest that the
addition of about 6 kb to the Pteropodidae combined
matrix used here would probably allow to resolve all
basal relationships of the family. This result is similar to

Almeida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:281

that obtained in the analyses of the relationships among
bird orders. After being shown to represent a hard
polytomy [34], the intraordinal relationships of Neoaves
could finally be resolved with a 32 kb dataset [35].
Because the radiation of Neoaves is much older than
that of Pteropodidae, it is expected that that group
require more data for phylogenetic resolution. As previously suggested, the older the radiation, the greater
the effect of rapid diversification on phylogenetic resolution [60].

nectarivorous habits and associated morphological adaptations in several of the pteropodid clades. Among the
demographic causes of explosive radiations are small
population sizes (favoring differentiation through genetic
drift) and/or the existence of isolated peripheral populations. Given the flight power of megabats and their geographic distribution on (often isolated) islands,
colonization of underpopulated areas and the existence
isolated peripheral populations could both have contributed for an explosive radiation of megabats.

Explosive radiation of megabats?

Conclusions
Our phylogenetic analyses identified six principal clades
and one additional independent lineage within Pteropodidae. This result points to the need for a new formal
classification of the family based on monophyletic units.
The trees presented here are the most complete ever for
the family in terms of genera representation, and are
robust in terms of providing statistical support for pteropodid relationships. They thus provide a sound phylogenetic framework for the study of the morphologic,
ecologic, and behavioral evolution within this highly
diverse and divergent bat family. In contrast with the
high statistical support obtained for the major pteropodid groups and subordinate clades, relationships among
the seven principal clades were largely unresolved. Congruence in this aspect among different gene trees and
the results of simulations and the SOWH test suggest
that crown pteropodids experienced an explosive radiation soon after their origin. To further evaluate the
hypothesis of an explosive radiation of megabats and
determine the potential processes involved will require a
number of additional analyses including estimates of
divergence times, estimates of diversification rates, and
comparisons with other mammalian families with similar divergence times. A complete genus-level taxonomic
sampling along with complete locus representation will
be important in these future analyses.

Lack of phylogenetic resolution (hard polytomy) even
when a considerable amount of data is used has been
interpreted as evidence of closely spaced cladogenetic
events [32,33,35,60,61]. Pteropodidae has apparently
been distinct from other bat lineages since at least the
early Eocene [10,62] but the crown group is believed to
be of more recent origin. Estimates for the beginning of
crown group divergence range between 31 and 20 million years (My) [10,27]. Using an estimate of 26 My for
the pteropodid radiation and the substitution rates
obtained with our combined dataset, the first three cladogenetic events of Pteropodidae are estimated to have
occurred within approximately 0.5 My.
The results of our phylogenetic analysis, therefore,
suggest that pteropodids experienced an explosive radiation that generated all main lineages representing its
extant diversity. Although a more focused analysis
would be necessary to fully evaluate this hypothesis,
some characteristics of the family Pteropodidae are consistent with the idea that it experienced an explosive
radiation. Explosive radiations are usually associated
with high taxonomic diversity [63] and Pteropodidae is
in fact one of the most diverse bat families. Among the
20 bat families currently recognized, Pteropodidae ranks
second in both genus and species diversity with over 45
genera and over 180 species [1,64].
Explosive radiations can be caused by demographic
factors, intrinsic evolutionary rates, ecological adaptation, or a combination of any or all of these factors [65].
When an explosive radiation is accompanied by ecological adaptation (adaptive radiation), it often involves the
evolution of novel characters (key innovation)
[63,65,66]. Pteropodidae exhibits numerous innovations
when compared to their closest relatives (Rhinolophoidea and Yangochiroptera), including primary phytophagy and predominance of visual over acoustic
orientation (for an extensive list of differences between
megabats and microbats see [67]). Also in accordance
with ecological adaptation as a drive to diversification is
the marked morphological diversity of megabats, such as
the high variance in body size, as compared to the other
bat families [68] and the independent evolution of

Methods
Sampling

The effect of missing data on phylogenetic estimation is
still a matter of controversy [52,69-72]. Our preliminary
analyses using data partitions of the concatenated gene
matrix and maximum likelihood searches showed reconstruction problems when whole partitions were missing
for certain taxa. Accordingly, in order to minimize any
possible effects of missing data, we generated two different data matrices for phylogenetic analyses. In the first
matrix (combined dataset 1), our goal was to minimize
missing data while including as much as possible of the
generic diversity of Pteropodidae. This matrix included
51 pteropodid species, representing 37 of the 46 pteropodid genera (Additional file 8). Among these 51

Almeida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:281
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/281

ingroup samples, 50 had all sequences determined
experimentally by us from tissue samples donated by
several institutions and individuals. Sequences of the
remaining species were obtained from the Genbank
(NCBI-NIH). In this first matrix, 44 of the ingroup taxa
were represented by all eight genes used in the analyses,
four taxa had one missing gene, and one taxon had two
missing genes. Some of the sequences obtained by us
have already been published [20,21,27,73].
A second matrix (dataset 2) was built to include five
additional pteropodid genera for which only a few
sequences are available (Additional file 8). These genera
were mostly represented by two mitochondrial genes,
usually the ribosomal genes 12S and 16S. Most of these
sequences were obtained from the Genbank, except for
those of the genus Latidens, which we sequenced ourselves. Dataset 2 included all currently recognized pteropodid genera except four taxa for which no DNA
sequence is available (Paranyctimene, Mirimiri, Neopteryx, and Plerotes) [1,74].
As outgroups, we used sequences from Genbank of
five non-pteropodid bats. Four of these, Rhinopoma
hardwickii, Hipposideros commersoni, Megaderma lyra,
and Rhinolophus creaghi, belong to the yinpterochiropteran superfamily Rhinolophoidea, which is widely
accepted as the sister group of Pteropodidae [9,10]. The
fifth outgroup species, Artibeus jamaicensis, represents
the other chiropteran suborder, Yangochiroptera.
Molecular methods

Eight genes were sequenced for this study, including
both nuclear and mitochondrial loci. The four nuclear
gene regions included the exon 28 of the von Willebrand Factor gene (vWF, 1230 bp), partial Recombination
Activating Gene 1 (RAG1, 1084 bp), partial Recombination Activating Gene 2 (RAG2, 760 bp), and partial
Breast Cancer 1 gene (BRCA1, about 1370 bp). These
genes have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of
the Chiroptera families and were able to resolve most
interfamilial relationships [9]. Besides, these genes have
been successfully used to resolve relationships at subfamily and genus levels in diverse groups of bats
[21,27,73,75]. The four mitochondrial genes were
sequenced in two fragments: one containing the complete sequence of the Cytochrome b gene (Cytb, 1140
bp) and another including partial rRNA 12S gene (1069
bp), the valine tRNA gene, and partial rRNA 16S gene
(1330 bp), totaling about 2550 bp. The latter fragment
has also proven highly informative at the familial level
in Chiroptera [9]. The combined sequence set encompassed a total of 8181 bp of aligned nucleotides (including indels). Individual ingroup samples in dataset 1 had
concatenated sequences ranging from 6011 bp to 8025
bp in length.

Page 13 of 17

Total DNA was obtained from preserved tissue samples with the DNeasy tissue kit (QIAGEN). PCR amplification was carried out using previously published
primers (RAG1 and RAG2: [9]; vWF: [76]; Cytb: [77];
12S: [78]; 16S: [16,78]). New primers were designed for
the 16S gene: 12l-f (AGAGGAGAYAAGTCGTAMCAAG), 16u-f (AGCCAYCAATTRAGAAAGC), 16q-r
(GTTTGCCGAGTTCCTTTTAC), and 16k-r (ATAGATAGAAACCGACCTGGA); and the BRCA1 gene:
BRCA1-f2
(AACAGATGGGTTGAAACTAAGG),
BRCA1-f3
(AGGYGATTATGTTCAGAAGAAG),
BRCA1-r2 (GAAGGCTAGGATTGACAAACTC), and
BRCA1-r4 (ATTTAATTCTAGTTCCAYATTGC).
Additional sequencing primers were also used for vWF ,
RAG1 [21] and 12S/valine-tRNA [27]. All sequences
were obtained with an automated ABI 3730XL sequencer. Sequence editing and prealignment were done with
the Sequencher 4.2 software (Gene Codes). Genbank
accession numbers and voucher information for taxa
included in this study are provided in the in the Additional file 8.
Sequence statistics

Alignments were done using the program MAFFT [79]
using the default costs for gaps (gap opening penalty =
1.53; gap extension penalty = 0.123). Among the protein
coding genes, only BRCA1 had indels, all of which were
in frame. Gap positioning was adjusted to match amino
acid codon positions with MacClade 4.08 [80]. The fragment containing 12S-valine-tRNA/16S also contained
several indels. This last fragment was treated as a single
partition in our dataset, which totaled six gene partitions: RAG1, RAG2, vWF, BRCA1, Cytb, and 12S/valtRNA/16S (hereafter “12S16S”). Conflicting phylogenetic
signal among partitions was checked using the incongruence-length difference test (ILD) [81] as implemented in PAUP* 4.10 b [82], running 500 searches with
random stepwise addition and 10 replicates per search.
The ILD test has been criticized for being sensitive to
both type I and type II errors [83,84]. As an alternative
test for incongruence, we used the script concartepillar.
py which employs a hierarchical clustering method and
likelihood-ratio tests to identify pairs of loci that have
incongruent phylogenetic signal [55]. In these tests we
excluded taxa for which one or more loci were not
available, so that each alignment had the same set of
taxa.
Substitution saturation in the combined dataset was
checked by plotting number of transition and transversions as a function of GTR distances. Additionally, we
used a saturation test [53] implemented in the program
DAMBE [85]. Base composition bias among taxa was
analyzed for each locus including all codon positions
and for each codon position separately using the c2 test

Almeida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:281
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/281

implemented in PAUP* 4.10 b [82]. Pairwise relative rate
tests were done using HyPhy [86]. In all multiple tests,
significance was corrected for multiple testing using the
sequential Bonferroni criterion.

Phylogenetic inferences were done using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). The MP
searches were run on PAUP* 4.10 b [82], with 1000 random sequence additions followed by tree bisection
reconnection branch swapping (TBR). Gaps were treated
as missing data. Statistical support for clades were
obtained with non-parametric bootstrap using PAUP*
4.10 b and Bremer decay values using TreeRot v.3 [87].
ML analyses were carried out with the program TreeFinder [88]. For the combined dataset 1, we first tried
several partitioning schemes and compared their outcomes to determine the optimal scheme. Seven different
partition schemes based on gene and codon position
were tested, from one that separates all genes and
codon positions, totaling 16 partitions, to non-partitioning of the data (analyzing it as one single partition). In
these analyses, the GTR model was generally applied,
with partition-wide estimates of the rate parameters by
maximum likelihood optimization and empirical nucleotide frequency parameters. The performances of the different partition schemes were evaluated by comparing
the likelihood, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
[89,90], and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) [91]
values of the resulting trees. AICc was used instead of
AIC in cases where the ratio of the number of parameters to the number of bases was equal or less than
40. AIC and BIC correct the likelihood of a model for
the number of the parameters, penalizing overparameterization [92]. The partition schemes with better scores
(lower AIC and BIC values) were then used in ML analysis with optimal substitution models for each partition.
Selection of partition-wide substitution models was
done in Treefinder, using AIC. Statistical support of
branches was obtained with 500 replicas of partitionwise bootstrap.
Alternative topologies were compared in a ML framework using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) [93] and the
Approximately Unbiased (AU) [94] tests as implemented
in TreeFinder. In the MP framework, we used the program PAUP* to run the Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) and
the Templeton non-parametric tests [95,96].
Zero-branch length simulations

To test whether basal, non-supported branches had
lengths significantly different from zero in the individual
gene and combined dataset trees, we compared the best
tree found for that dataset with trees identical to the
best tree but with unsupported branches collapsed. For

Page 14 of 17

that we employed the SH and the AU tests using TreeFinder. To access whether multiple nodes were involved
in a polytomy at the base of the Pteropodidae tree, we
used a similar approach to that proposed by Poe and
Chubb [34]. Briefly, for each best ML gene tree, basal
branches were collapsed one by one simultaneously (up
to 6), and the likelihood of these collapsed trees were
compared with the likelihood of the best tree. Because
typical likelihood comparison tests should not be
employed when multiple branches are collapsed at the
same time [97], we created null distributions for the test
statistic (the difference in likelihood between the best
and the collapsed tree) using simulated datasets as in
the SOWH test [98]. Sequences were simulated based
on trees with collapsed branches using the same evolutionary model and substitution parameters obtained for
the original dataset with the program evolver of PAML
v.4.4 [99,100]. For each of the 100 simulated matrices,
we obtained the best tree over 10 independent runs
using RAxML v7.2.6 [101] and calculated the difference
in likelihood of this tree to that of the collapsed tree
(used to simulate the sequences) using baseml (PAML
v4.4). In this way we obtained a null distribution of 100
likelihood differences between best and collapsed tree
(the null hypothesis tree). In the analyses involving
simulations, only ingroup species for which all genes
were sequenced (44 species) were kept in the matrix
and the GTR+Γ model was generally employed. These
analyses were not done for RAG2, due the low resolution of its gene tree (Additional file 3, Figure S4), and
Cytb, because of the large difference in substitution
rates between the 3rd codon position and the other positions (Additional file 6).
Biogeographic analysis

The biogeographic history of the major pteropodid
clades was analyzed using DIVA (Dispersal-Vicariance
Analysis) [56,102]. Geographic distribution of the pteropodid genera were obtained in Simmons [1] and double
checked with updated information from the http://gis.
miiz.waw.pl/webapps/thebats/iucn/ website. All species
of the same genera were assigned the same distribution
area, except for Roussetus. To remark that the most
basal Rousettus in our tree (R. amplexicaudatus) inhabits the Asian continent, we assigned only its own area
to this species, while to the other two Rousettus species
(R. leschenaultii and R. madagascariensis) we assigned
all areas occupied by species of this genus. The area
units and the geographic distributions of genera used in
the DIVA are listed in the Additional file 9 (Tables S5
and S6). DIVA was based on the ML tree obtained for
dataset 2 (all available pteropodid taxa), using alternatively maxarea=2 or 3. Results obtained with maxarea =
3 option in general contained all the areas obtained with

Almeida et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:281
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/281

maxarea = 2 plus 3-area combinations of those areas.
Hence, we show here only the results obtained with
maxarea = 2.
