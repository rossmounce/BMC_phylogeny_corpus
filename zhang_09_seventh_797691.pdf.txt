The Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC) series,
founded in 2003, is an annual international forum for
exploring research, development and applications of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. The Seventh Asia
Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC2009) was held
at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China during January 13–
16 in 2009. It brought together more than 300 researchers, professionals, industrial practitioners and students
from all over the world for interaction and exchange of
knowledge and ideas in broad areas of bioinformatics and
computational biology. The participants came from 21
nations and regions including (in alphabetical order) Australia, Belgium, Canada, China (the Mainland, Hong
Kong and Taiwan), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, India, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the
USA and Vietnam. This represents the largest submission
and participation in the history of APBC. The conference
program includes 2 keynotes (Drs. David J. Lipman and
Michael S. Waterman), 5 invited talks (Drs. Michael B.
Eisen, Bailin Hao, John Mattick, Pavel Pevzner and Martin
Vingron), 76 selected talks, 4 tutorial sessions and 120
posters.
The titles of the keynote and invited talks are:
• David J. Lipman: Molecular evolution and epidemiology of
seasonal influenza

• Michael S. Waterman: Sequence analysis using Eulerian
graphs
• Michael B. Eisen: Understanding and exploiting the evolution of Drosophila regulatory sequences
• Bailin Hao: Independent verification of 16S rRNA based
prokaryotic phylogeny by composition vector approach
• John Mattick: A new understanding of the human genome
• Pavel Pevzner: Genome Rearrangements: from Biological Problems to Combinatorial Algorithms
• Martin Vingron: Transcriptional regulation: computational
methods, statistics, and coregulation
The topics of the four tutorials are: A structured approach for
the dynamics modeling of biomolecular networks (David R.
Gilbert, Robin Donaldson, Monika Heiner & Rainer Breitling), Natural language processing for biology: BioNLP (Zhiyong Lu & Kevin Cohen), Bayesian methods in genetic
association studies (Matthew Stephens), and Systems biology
based on integrated analysis of functional genomics data (Olga
G. Troyanskaya).
The APBC series had a tradition of emphasis on rigorous
algorithm topics in bioinformatics and computation. In
this year's conference, this hallmark was retained while

the biological contexts of the topics were given more
emphasis. Authors from more diverse backgrounds of
computer science, biology, statistics, electrical engineering, medical sciences, chemistry and physics contributed
to the conference. The selected papers and posters cover a
wide range of themes in current bioinformatics and computational biology. The biological questions studied can
be categorized into the following major fields:

A total of 204 submissions were received and reviewed by
a strong 63-member international Program Committee so
that each submission is reviewed at least by 2 PC members, and more than 30 additional reviewers were invited
by the PC members to provide extra reviews. The selected
talks (all but one are collected in this supplement to BMC
Bioinformatics) represent a 37% acceptance rate, and the
authors have carefully revised the papers according to the
reviews before the publication. A full proceedings of
APBC2009, including all the accepted full papers and
abstracts, is published by Tsinghua University Press.

• Luhua Lai, Peking University
• Tak Wah Lam, University of Hong Kong
• Charles Lawrence, Brown University
• Chris Lee, UCLA
• Doheon Lee, KAIST

In conclusion we express our deep appreciation to the PC
members and the additional reviewers who worked on a
very tight schedule, sharing their valuable time and exquisite expertise in support of the review process. The PC
members are:

• Cheng Li, DFCI/HSPH
• Hao Li, UCSF
• Jinyan Li, Nanyang Technological University

• Tatsuya Akutsu, Kyoto University
