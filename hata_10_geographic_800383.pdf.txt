cultivation mutualism in the Indo-West Pacific

Abstract
Background: On coral reefs, damselfish defend their territories from invading herbivores and maintain algal turfs, from
which they harvest filamentous algae. In southern Japan, intensive weeding of indigestible algae by Stegastes nigricans
results in overgrowth by one filamentous alga, Polysiphonia sp. 1. Because this alga is highly susceptible to grazing and
is competitively inferior to other algae, it survives only within the protective territories of this fish species, suggesting an
obligate mutualism between damselfish and their cultivated alga. The wide distribution of damselfish species through
the Indo-Central Pacific raises the question of whether this species-specific mutualism is maintained throughout the
geographic range of the fish. To address this question, from all 18 damselfish species we conducted comprehensive
surveys of algal flora within their territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific, and identified species of Polysiphonia
using morphological examination and gene sequencing data.
Results: Several species of the genus Polysiphonia were observed as a major crop in territories throughout the
geographic range of S. nigricans. Polysiphonia sp. 1 occurred only in territories of S. nigricans in central areas of the IndoPacific. However, its occurrence was low from the Great Barrier Reef and Mauritius. In contrast, other indigenous
Polysiphonia species, which formed a clade with Polysiphonia sp. 1, occurred in the territories of fishes from Egypt,
Kenya, and the Maldives. The other Polysiphonia species in the clade only inhabited damselfish territories and were
never found elsewhere.
Conclusions: Cultivation mutualism between the damselfish S. nigricans and algae of Polysiphonia was maintained
throughout the Indo-West Pacific, although algal crop species and the mode of cultivation (e.g., presence/absence of
selective weeding, the species composition of algal turfs) varied among localities. This finding implies that damselfish
utilize indigenous Polysiphonia species in newly colonized habitats in different ways, and therefore the algal
composition and means of cultivation have diverged.
Background
Mutualism is widespread in nature, even between potentially antagonistic partners. Cultivation mutualism can be
defined as relationships in which the consumer promotes
the growth and net survival of the species it consumes.
Most species engaging in cultivation mutualism are terrestrial, and these mutualisms usually involve fungi rather
than primary producers (e.g., ant-fungal mutualisms [13]). Mutualisms between primary producers and herbivores, with the exception of crops and humans, typically
involve either protection of a few plants that are much
larger than the herbivores (e.g., ant-Acacia mutualisms

[4,5]) or facilitate pollination (e.g., fig-fig wasp mutualism
[6,7]), and are thus not considered cultivation mutualism
in the strict sense. Therefore, the cultivation mutualism
between the territorial damselfish Stegastes nigricans and
algae of Polysiphonia on coral reefs [8] is noteworthy by
virtue of being marine and because it involves photosynthetic algae.
On coral reefs, damselfishes individually defend territories from invading vertebrate/invertebrate grazers and
maintain algal turfs, from which they obtain all of their
food [9,10]. These algal turfs are rich in biomass [11-14],
are highly productive [12,15], and are dominated by delicate, filamentous rhodophyta, especially members of the
genus Polysiphonia [14,16,17]. These damselfishes
browse mainly on the upright axes of filamentous algae
[18,19], digesting the material with a highly acidic stom-

ach [20,21], and absorbing the digested material in their
long intestine with a slow gut turnover rate [22-25]. They
have neither masticatory organs nor effective endogenous or exogenous carbohydrases for breaking down
algal cell walls, and thus can only digest filamentous algae
that have no cortical layer [19-21,26,27]. The algal turfs of
the territorial damselfish, Stegastes nigricans, are a monoculture of the filamentous red alga, Polysiphonia sp. 1, in
Okinawa, Japan, which is the northernmost range of this
species [14]. The fish intensively defends its territory
against herbivores, weeds out indigestible corticated and/
or calcareous algae, and harvests the filamentous alga. As
a result, algal turfs within their small territories are dominated by only one algal species, Polysiphonia sp. 1, which
is the most digestible alga species for this fish and is thus
harvested by the damselfish as a staple food [19,28]. This
Polysiphonia sp. 1 is susceptible to grazing by territorial
invaders and from competition from other algae, and
therefore, inhabits only the territories of this damselfish
species where other herbivores are chased away and other
algae are weeded out [8,29]. In this way, the fish and the
alga are highly dependent on one another.
Reciprocal interactions between partners often vary
geographically with the partners involved and the benefits received [30]. The alga-farming damselfish, S. nigricans, is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Central
Pacific [31], and it is unclear whether its relationship with
Polysiphonia species is maintained throughout its geographic range. This fish neither sows nor transplants the
algae, and it is proposed that water-borne diaspores (carpospores and tetraspores) of the algae germinate into
sporophytes/gametophytes [32,33]. However, little is
known about the distribution and dispersal ability of
Polysiphonia species. Damselfish larvae can potentially
disperse over long distances, carried by currents during
the pelagic larval stage, which lasts approximately 28 days
[34,35]. However, genetic differentiation has been
observed between populations of damselfish in the Maldives and Guam in Micronesia, suggesting that long-distance dispersal is rare [36]. The broad distribution of S.
nigricans poses a question as to whether the cultivation
mutualism occurring is also widespread. If so, is this partnership conserved throughout the geographical range of
the fish? The composition of S. nigricans algal turfs have
been reported from several sites covering a wide geographic distribution [14,16,37-39], however detailed and
accurate classification of Polysiphonia to species level has
thus far not been attempted. Morphological-based identification of filamentous red algae is highly problematic,
mostly because they have a relatively simple morphology
and exhibit extreme levels of phenotypic plasticity [40].
However, molecular identification using 18S rDNA
sequencing is known to agree with the species taxonomy
based on anatomical data in Polysiphonia algae [41]. The

smallest difference between species was shown to be four
bases in the 18S rDNA sequence [41], and as a result we
used this criterion to distinguish species of Polysiphonia
in this study. Thus, by determining the species identity of
Polysiphonia algae using DNA sequencing data in concert
with morphological characteristics, we explored the geographic pattern of the partnership between the fish and
algal species, and detected the geographic distribution of
the damselfish-algae mutualism.

Results
We surveyed 320 territories of 18 damselfish species and
thoroughly examined algae from each fish territory from
coral reefs in Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, the Maldives,
Thailand, Borneo, the Okinawa Islands, and the Great
Barrier Reef (GBR, Table 1). A total of 21 Polysiphonia
genotypes were found among 211 territories of 15 damselfish species in the Indo-West Pacific (Fig. 1). These
genotypes were different from each other by more than
four bases in 18S rDNA, and therefore were treated as
species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the collected
Polysiphonia species detected four clades: A (including
Polysiphonia sp. 1), B, C, and D, as shown in Fig. 1. Polysiphonia sp. 1, which had previously been found only
within Stegastes nigricans territories in Okinawa, was discovered from territories of this damselfish species in
Mauritius and the GBR, but nowhere else. Polysiphonia
clade A species were seldom found outside territories of
S. nigricans. In contrast, Polysiphonia sp. 3 of clade C
occurred in the territories of 11 damselfish species and
also outside damselfish territories throughout the study
area. On the other hand, multiple species of Polysiphonia
coexisted in the territories of S. nigricans and Hemiglyphidodon plagiometopon in some localities. In general Polysiphonia algae were rarely found outside damselfish
territories. In Okinawa, two species of Polysiphonia
clades C and D occurred in 9.5% and 0.6% of these extraterritorial samples, respectively, although a very closely
related Neosiphonia species that lacks a prostrate axis
occurred in 37.3% of the extra-territorial samples.
Fig. 2 shows the percent composition of algae in the territories of four abundant and widely-distributed damselfish species, S. nigricans, S. lividus, Plectroglyphidodon
lacrymatus, and H. plagiometopon. Algal compositions of
the territories differed among fish species (two-way
ANOSIM, R = 0.51, p = 0.001), and among study sites
(two-way ANOSIM, R = 0.51, p = 0.001). Algal turfs of
these damselfishes were dominated by filamentous rhodophyta including Polysiphonia algae. Instead of Polysiphonia, a mixture of filamentous algae of the genera
Neosiphonia, Herposiphonia, Anotrichium, and Ceramium comprised substantial portions of the algal turfs in
all damselfish territories from all localities except for territories of S. nigricans in Okinawa. However, Polysipho-

indicate the number of DNA samples including partially sequenced samples. Data presented as the scientific names of algae with accession numbers
denote citations from the NCBI GenBank. Black blocks indicate the locations from which the algae were collected (EP, Egypt; KY, Kenya; MR, Mauritius;
MD, the Maldives; TI, Thailand; BR, Borneo; OK, Okinawa; GB, the GBR). Gray blocks indicate areas inhabited by damselfish for which we have no data;
blocks with slashes denote sites inhabited by damselfish where the alga was not found; open blocks indicate areas uninhabited by the fish. The tree
was obtained using the ML method based on 1531 bp of 18S rDNA. Branches that collapse in MP, ML, and/or BI trees are presented as broken lines.
Nodal support was assessed by the bootstrap value of MP and posterior probabilities of BI (above branches, MP/BI, respectively). Four abundant and
widely-distributed damselfish species are listed on the right column, and their localities were linked with inhabitant Polysiphonia algae. Broad and narrow links indicate that the alga occurred in ≥ 50% or ≥ 25% of the territories of the damselfish species at these sites, respectively. Solid and broken
lines indicate that the algal species occurred only within the territories of the fish species or that they also occurred in territories of other fish species
and/or outside the damselfish territories, respectively.

belongs, were consistently the staple species in S. nigricans territories at all study sites, although occupancy varied among study sites. Occupancy was higher in Okinawa
than at the other sites (Tukey-Kramer test, Okinawa vs.
all other sites, all p < 0.05). Polysiphonia sp. 1 (plain red

cans depended exclusively on this algal species, forming
monocultures, whereas in Mauritius and the GBR, Polysiphonia sp. 1 did not always occur in the territories of S.
nigricans and did not dominate where it did occur.
From Egypt, Kenya, the Maldives, and the GBR, other
species of clade A occurred in the algal turfs of S. nigricans. The Polysiphonia species that was dominant in territories of S. nigricans from Egypt was a sister branch of
Polysiphonia sp. 1 (Fig. 1). However, the dominant Polysiphonia species from Kenya and the Maldives were not
closely related to Polysiphonia sp. 1, and they also inhabited the territories of other damselfish species. Other
damselfishes, i.e., Stegastes lividus, Plectroglyphidodon
lacrymatus, and H. plagiometopon, shared Polysiphonia
sp. 3 (plain green bar in Figs. 1, 2) in most localities.

Discussion
Mutualism and other relationships between territorial
damselfishes and algae in the Indo-West Pacific

Throughout its geographical range, the territorial damselfish Stegastes nigricans maintained algal turfs that were
consistently inhabited by local Polysiphonia species
belonging to a single phylogenetic clade (clade A). Polysiphonia sp. 1 of clade A was common in the territories of
S. nigricans from the central Indo-West Pacific, but not

from Egypt, Kenya, or the Maldives, where other indigenous Polysiphonia species of clade A were utilized instead
of Polysiphonia sp. 1 (Fig. 3). Two species of Polysiphonia
that occurred in the territories of S. nigricans from Egypt
and the GBR, and Polysiphonia sp. 1, were found only in
S. nigricans territories. Additionally, two other Polysiphonia species were abundant and almost exclusively inhabited S. nigricans territories from the Maldives and Kenya.
These results suggest that S. nigricans provides these
Polysiphonia species with their sole or primary habitat,
and harvests these filamentous algae as a staple food in all
localities from the Indo-West Pacific. In this way, the
mutualism between S. nigricans and its crop Polysiphonia
species was maintained, but the partner Polysiphonia
species varied among localities. Phylogenetic results suggest that shifts in crop algal species within clade A have
occurred at least a few times in the West-Central Indian
Ocean. Furthermore, the occurrence of Polysiphonia species in clade A in the territories of S. nigricans varied geographically, being highest in Okinawa, where the
damselfish weed out algae other than the crop algal species. From Okinawa, where the relationship between the
damselfish and Polysiphonia alga attains obligate mutualism, a single species of Polysiphonia dominated the territories of S. nigricans to form nearly pure monocultures,

Hata et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:185
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/185

whereas other Polysiphonia species rarely coexisted
within the territories. In the case of fungus-farming ants
and termites, each colony is maintained as a monoculture
of a genetically single cultivar [42,43], and this is thought
to be a key stabilizing factor in the mutualistic interaction
on an evolutionary time scale [44]. In the GBR and Mauritius, the coverage of Polysiphonia sp. 1 in territories was
lower than in Japan, suggesting that the fish utilized not
only this alga but also other algal species, as well as other
resources such as detritus trapped in the algal turf
[16,37].
Conversely, from most locations the algal turfs of three
other species of damselfishes, S. lividus, P. lacrymatus,
and H. plagiometopon, were dominated by filamentous
rhodophyta, and shared a generalist Polysiphonia species.
This discrepancy in the structure of algal turfs between S.
nigricans and other damselfish species is caused by differences in the inherent farming strategies of fishes, that is,
intensive farming and extensive farming. In the intensive
farming method, damselfish defend their small monoculture patch by selective weeding and vigorous exclusion of
invaders. In contrast, in extensive farming, damselfish
defend large but mixed-species algal turfs only by excluding invaders [16,17,28,45].
The algal turfs of most damselfishes are known to be
dominated by filamentous rhodophyta, but the dominant
algal genera shift within the subclass Rhodymeniophycidae with geographic range as well as on much smaller
scales such as reef zones on a coral reef [10,17], and species-specificity has been known only between a damselfish, S. nigricans, and Polysiphonia sp. 1 in Okinawa [8].
Extensive molecular phylogenetic analyses of algae
enabled us to detect patterns between damselfish and
Polysiphonia species at a species level, as this method is
effective in detecting species interactions and coevolutionary processes in other mutualistic systems [46,47].
More intensive research on algal turfs of damselfishes at
each location, and species identifications of Polysiphonia
algae using DNA sequences are needed to understand the
partnerships between damselfish and Polysiphonia algae,
their degrees of specialization in this cultivation mutualism system, and their geographic variations. Other than
our study sites and focus species, Polysiphonia species are
known to be abundant in the territories of damselfishes
all around the Pacific, including those of S. apicalis in the
Gulf of Thailand [48], S. lividus in Guam [49], S. nigricans, Neoglyphidodon nigroris, Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus, and P. dickii in Papua New Guinea [16,17],
Pomacentrus adelus, P. tripunctatus, and P. wardi in the
GBR [17], S. nigricans in Fiji [50], S. fasciolatus in Tonga
[49], and Microspathodon dorsalis in the Gulf of California [51], and even in the Atlantic (S. planifrons in
Jamaica) [52]. Studies of these species and locations

would improve our understanding of mutualism between
herbivorous fish and red algae on coral reefs.
Geographic structure of the damselfish-red alga mutualism
systems

The mutualism between a marine herbivorous fish, S. nigricans, and the filamentous rhodophyte Polysiphonia
showed an asymmetric species-specific pattern in which
indigenous Polysiphonia species exclusively inhabited the
territories of S. nigricans, but not necessarily dominated
the territories except in Okinawa. This mosaic pattern in
the cultivation system is thought to be caused by differences in the history of interaction and coevolution
between the fish and the algae and in the community of
interacting organisms at each coral reef. Selective weeding by S. nigricans is a fundamental trait mediating this
mutualism, and this maintains a near monoculture of
Polysiphonia sp. 1 in Okinawa [8]. Weeding behavior by
S. nigricans has been observed 0.5 times per 10 minutes
in Okinawa [19], and 0.7 times per 10 minutes in Kenya
(n = 3 individuals, 1 observation each, our primary observation). In Kenya, however, three species of Polysiphonia
coexisted with each other and with other algae in the territories. On the other hand, weeding behavior was not
observed from the Maldives at least in our observation (n
= 5 individuals, 1 observation each, our primary observation) where territories of S. nigricans were inhabited by
two species of Polysiphonia. Further study on the variation in weeding behavior, its efficiency in local conditions, and its genetic basis are needed to explain this
discrepancy among localities. With respect to local environments, sea urchins were more abundant inside territories of S. nigricans in Okinawa than in Kenya and the
Maldives, and in Okinawa invading herbivores were also
much more abundant than in Kenya (Additional file 1:
Fig. S1). Additionally, twelve species of territorial damselfishes coexist on reefs in Okinawa (Table 1). Therefore,
the density, diversity, and composition of competitors
may drive the selection mosaic [30]. Further studies on
population genetics of damselfishes and Polysiphonia
algae, and measurement of fitness under interactions in
each locality in this geographic range will reveal how geographic variation is structured and whether the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is valid [53].
Geographic variation in the partnership and specialization between the cultivation mutualism participants has
also been reported between a fungus-growing termite
and its crop fungus [54,55]. In this system, Microtermes
termites are generalists and utilize genetically diverse
symbiont fungi in South Africa, whereas the Microtermes
species in western Africa (Senegal and Cameroon) are
specialists and are associated with a single narrow lineage
of fungi. The geographic patterns of mutualism are not

obvious in fungus-growing attine ants or ambrosia beetles [56], but may be generally structured as observed
from plant cultivation systems in humans [57].

Conclusions
This study revealed that the intensive-farming damselfish
Stegastes nigricans maintains similar algal turfs dominated or subdominated by a clade of Polysiphonia species
throughout a wide geographic range, but that the crop
alga species varies among distantly isolated localities.
These Polysiphonia species inhabited territories of fish
species exclusively or nearly exclusively. Therefore, cultivation mutualism between S. nigricans and Polysiphonia
algae was maintained throughout the geographic range of
S. nigricans, with some algal shifts in crops occurring
from the West Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. This damselfish-alga mutualism is a model system through which
we can approach the origin, establishment, and coevolutionary processes of the cultivation system.
Methods
Sampling

We collected Polysiphonia spp. and other algal species
from the territories of 18 damselfish species from coral
reefs at eight sites in the Indo-West Pacific from 2003 to
2006: Egypt (the Red Sea), Kenya, Mauritius, the Maldives, southern Thailand (the Andaman Sea), Sabah in
Borneo, the Okinawan Islands in southern Japan, and the
GBR in Australia (Table 1). Each algal sample was collected from each territory of damselfishes. We defined
damselfish territory as the place where the territory
holder fed on algae and defended against conspecific and
heterospecific herbivores [58]. Whether a site was located
within or outside of a damselfish territory was determined by 20 min of observation immediately prior to
sampling. To facilitate thorough sampling of algae from
outside the territories of fishes in Okinawa, Japan, we set
line transects from the beach to offshore areas, perpendicular to the shoreline, at 2, 4, and 10 reef flats around
Okinawa Island (N 26°04-52', E 127°38'-128°19'), Ishigaki
Island (N 24°19-36', E 124°04-20'), and Iriomote Island (N
24°15-25', E 123°40-55') [6]. We set 1 × 1 m quadrats outside the territories at 50-m intervals along each transect
and used a knife to scrape all of the algae and seagrass
within the quadrats into mesh bags. In total, 158 samples
were collected from outside damselfish territories.
Algal samples were immediately preserved in 100% ethanol. In the laboratory, samples were rinsed with distilled
water, and all Polysiphonia algae were sorted under a
microscope. Polysiphonia algae, including the small thalli
of the algae, were classified into species using molecular

Page 8 of 10

data (see below). The percent composition of Polysiphonia species in algal turfs was quantified by spreading the
algal samples evenly in a Petri dish marked with a grid,
identifying the algae on fixed 100 crossing points using
molecular data when necessary, and counting the occurrence of each algal species.
Molecular methods

We extracted total DNA from field-collected, ethanolpreserved algae using Ampdirect® Plus (Shimadzu, Japan).
A fragment of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers 5'ACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAG-3' and G07, and was
directly sequenced using these two primers and four
additional primers [59]. Polysiphonia species can be classified at the species level using 18S rDNA sequences [41].
All sequences were deposited in the DDBJ database
[accession nos. AB505058-74].
Phylogenetic analyses

Maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses were conducted using PAUP* 4.0b10 [60],
and Bayesian inference (BI) was conducted using
MrBayes 3.2 [61]. MP analyses employed the heuristic
search option with TBR branch-swapping and 1000 random-taxon-addition replicates, identifying the 40 most
parsimonious trees of length = 447, C.I. = 0.593, and R.I.
= 0.770. Heuristic MP bootstrap analysis consisted of
1000 pseudoreplicates with 10 random-taxon-addition
replicates per pseudoreplicate. The likelihood ratio test
implemented in ModelTest 3.06 [62] found the TrN + I +
G model best fitting the sequence data, and this model
was employed in a heuristic ML analysis. A heuristic
search with 10 random-taxon-addition sequences and
TBR branch swapping was performed. BI was performed
based on the model HKY + I + G, which was selected by
MrModeltest 2.3 [63], with 2,000,000 generations, sampling every 100 generations. The first 500 trees were discarded as burn-in after confirming chain stationarity
from plots of likelihood against generation. The average
standard deviation of split frequencies after 2,000,000
generations was 0.0033.
Statistical analyses

Algal composition of damselfish territories were analyzed
using two-way ANOSIM [64] with fish species and study
site as factors. The percent composition of Polysiphonia
species and that of Polysiphonia clades in the territories
of Stegastes nigricans were compared among locations
using a Tukey-Kramer test. ANOSIM was conducted
using PRIMER 6 (Plymouth Marine Laboratories, UK).
