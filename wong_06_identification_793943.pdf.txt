Abstract
Background: Statistical methods for identifying positively selected sites in protein coding regions
are one of the most commonly used tools in evolutionary bioinformatics. However, they have been
limited by not taking the physiochemical properties of amino acids into account.
Results: We develop a new codon-based likelihood model for detecting site-specific selection
pressures acting on specific physicochemical properties. Nonsynonymous substitutions are divided
into substitutions that differ with respect to the physicochemical properties of interest, and those
that do not. The substitution rates of these two types of changes, relative to the synonymous
substitution rate, are then described by two parameters, γ and ω respectively. The new model
allows us to perform likelihood ratio tests for positive selection acting on specific physicochemical
properties of interest.
The new method is first used to analyze simulated data and is shown to have good power and
accuracy in detecting physicochemical selective pressure. We then re-analyze data from the classI alleles of the human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and from the abalone sperm lysine.
Conclusion: Our new method allows a more flexible framework to identify selection pressure on
particular physicochemical properties.

Background
Traditionally, the nonsynonymous to synonymous rate
ratio (the dN/dS ratio, also known as ω) is a measure of the
strength of selection acting on a protein coding nucleotide
sequence. When the nonsynonymous substitution rate is
higher than the synonymous substitution rate at a particular codon site, this site is assumed to be undergoing positive selection, i.e. selection in favor of new
nonsynonymous mutations. Conversely, if the nonsynonymous substitution rate is lower than the synonymous

substitution rate at a codon site, it is interpreted as evidence for negative selection, i.e. selection against mutations.
It is well-known that the rate of substitution between
amino acids at a particular site depends on both its location in the protein (e.g. [1]) and the physicochemical
properties of the amino acids involved (e.g. [2-6]). Site
specific models have been successful in identifying particular residues, or codon sites, that have been targeted by

positive selection (e.g. [7-9]). However, relatively little has
been known regarding the particular physicochemical
properties that have been subject to positive selection.
Site-specific information regarding the physicochemical
properties that have been subject to positive selection is of
great interest in many systems. For example, in viral genes,
site-specific information regarding physicochemical properties targeted by selection may shed evolutionary light on
the biochemistry underlying mutational evasion of an
immune response (e.g. [10]). Therefore, it would be very
helpful to have statistical methods that can determine the
physicochemical properties subject to selection at specific
sites.
Sainudiin et al. (2005) [11] conducted a study to detect
selection acting on the physicochemical properties at individual codon sites using the maximum likelihood framework by [12] and [13,11] generalized the concept of the
nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio by replacing it
with the property-altering to property-preserving rate ratio
(γ) that is invoked by a partition of the amino acids
according to the physicochemical properties of interest, to
explore the physicochemical properties that were targeted
by positive selection. A major limitation of their model is
that it divided substitutions into two groups: (1) synonymous mutations and property conserving nonsynonymous
mutations,
and
(2)
property
altering
nonsynonymous mutations.
In this paper, we generalize the idea proposed by [11] by
allowing three categories of mutations: synonymous
mutations, property conserving nonsynonymous mutations, and property altering nonsynonymous mutations.
The rate of the latter two types of mutations, each of which
is scaled relative to the rate of synonymous mutations, is
denoted by ω and γ, respectively. This allows us to investigate the selective pressure acting on any physicochemical
property of interest using γ, while simultaneously
accounting for the non-specific selective pressure at the
amino acids level using ω. We also develop a set of new
mixture models that allows site-specific inferences of
selection acting on specific physicochemical properties.
Finally, we illustrate the method on both simulated and
real data sets.

Results
Implementation
Modeling physicochemical pressure
In order to test whether there is selective constraint or
preference acting on a particular physicochemical property at the amino acid level, we introduce a new parameter
γ within the framework of the continuous-time Markov
chain models of codon evolution proposed by [14] and
[15]. The state space of the model, assuming the universal
genetic code, is given by the 61 sense codons. The 61 × 61
rate matrix Q = {qij} gives the rate of transition from
codon i to codon j. The transition rate from codon i to
codon j is assumed to be proportional to the stationary
distribution of codon j. Here we propose two modifications to the basic model to allow selection to act on specific physicochemical properties.

In Model A, if codon i and j differ by exactly one nucleotide, then
if i ≠ j by a synonymous transversion

In both models qij equals 0 if codon i and j differ in more
than one position, and qii = −∑ j ≠ i qij . The parameter κ
is the transition/transversion rate ratio and codon bias is
accounted for by incorporating the stationary distribution
of codon j. Notice that ω no longer can be interpreted
directly as the nonsynonymous/synonymous (dN/dS) rate
ratio, because this ratio also depends on γ.

model [14]. In model B, however, ω accounts for the background nonsynonymous codon substitution rate and
hence γ is the nonsynonymous substitutions rate between
codons encoding for different physicochemical properties
compared to the rate of other nonsynonymous substitutions. Once again, model B reduces to the Goldman and
Yang 94 model [14] when γ = 1.
The two models can be used to address different biological questions. For instance, we can test the hypothesis that
the nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio between
codons encoding for amino acids with different properties
is greater than 1 (positive selection) with model A (i.e.
testing if γ>1). On the other hand, model B can be used to
determine if there is an elevated rate of substitution
between codons encoding different physicochemical
properties compared to the rate of generic nonsynonymous mutations (i.e. testing if γ>ω). Since our main interest here is to look for positive selection in the more
conventional sense (nonsynonymous to synonymous rate
ratio >1), we will analyze simulated and real data sets with
model A.
We will construct models that allow site-specific variation
by assuming that ω and γ can each have two rate classes:
ω0 = 1, ω1>1 and γ0 = 1, γ1 >1 and therefore, there are 4
possible site classes to which each codon site can belong.

Although it is a gross simplification of the underlying
biology to assume that amino acid mutations can be
divided into two categories (property altering and property preserving), models based on this simplification provide considerable computational efficiency while
allowing the effect of various physicochemical properties
to be explored. The original models by [14], and the models by [16] allow a more complex relationship between
rate of substitution and physicochemical properties of the
amino acids; they do not, however, simultaneously allow
for site-specific variation of these properties in the way the
models we propose do.
Models A and B are similar in that the new parameter γ
appears as a product in the rate of codon substitution
when the two codons encode for amino acids of different
physicochemical properties. In model A, γ measures the
increase/decrease in the rate of nonsynonymous substitution between codons of different properties compared to
the synonymous substitution rate. In this model, ω is the
nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio of
codons encoding amino acids with similar physicochemical properties. It is worth noting that when ω = γ in model
A, it is reduced to the original Goldman and Yang 94

(iii) : ω1 > 1,γ 0 ≤ 1

Mixture models can then be constructed by allowing each
codon site to be in each of these classes with a certain
probability, that can be estimated from the data. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) can be constructed by comparing
models with only a few site classes to models with more
site classes. For example, we can test whether selection
favors substitution that alter the specified physicochemical properties with the null mixture model A with only
two site classes, namely (i) and (iii) (i.e. only allowing the
site classes with γ ≤ 1) against the alternative mixture
model A that allows for all four site classes. We refer to
these models as model A2 and A1, respectively (Table 1).
Various likelihood ratio tests can also be constructed. For
instance, we can obtain evidence for the presence of a significant number of sites in site class (ii) (i.e. the null
model has site classes (i), (iii) and (iv) against the full
model).
Notice that model A1 allows positive selection both on
the particular physicochemical property of interest (when
γ>1) as well as on all other nonsynonymous substitutions

that do not alter the physicochemical property of the
encoded amino acids (when ω>1). In contrast, model A2
does not allow positive selection with respect to the physicochemical property of interest (since ω<1). We can set
up a likelihood ratio test by comparing twice the log likelihood difference between Model A1 and Model A2 to a
2
χ 3 -distribution. Here we ask the question if there are

some sites with γ>1, i.e. whether there is a significant
amount of positive selection acting on the physicochemical property of interest.
We make the standard assumptions of the codon-based
likelihood framework (e.g. [13]); (1) we assume the true
topology of the tree is known and (2) each codon site in
the sequence is independent of the others. Then we calculate the log likelihood of the data given the topology of
the tree and the model by summing up the log-likelihood
of each site. The likelihood is optimized by the BFGS algorithm in Numerical Recipes in C [17]. After the maximum
likelihood estimates (MLEs) are obtained, we use the
Empirical Bayes approach [12] to assign sites to site
classes. The source code of the C program which implements both of the models (EvoRadical) has been deposited to sourceforge.net [18] and is licensed under the GPL
[19].
Data analysis
In order to investigate the performance of the model we
analyze both simulated and real data sets. The simulated
data sets were generated using a modified version of
Evolver in the PAML 3.13d package [20]. The parameters
used for simulation were ω = 0.4 and γ = 4 for data set 1,
ω = 4 and γ = 4 for data set 2, ω = γ = 0.4 for data set 3 and
ω = γ = 4 for data set 4. The transition/transversion ratio κ
was set to 4 for all data sets. We used the volume partition
for all four simulated data sets, by dividing amino acids

into 2 groups: large volume (I, L, M, F, Y, Q, W, H, K, R,
E), and small volume (V, A, G, P, T, C, S, N, D). A 15 taxa
tree was used (Figure 1). We analyzed the data with both
volume and hydrophobicity partitions under both Models A1 and A2 using the previously described methods,
and obtained maximum likelihood estimates of the
branch lengths of the tree, ω0, ω1, γ0, γ1, κ, the proportions
of each category, and the posterior probabilities of each
site belonging to each site class. The results are summarized in Table 2.
We re-analyzed the MHC class I data set from [21]
([22,23]) with Model A. [21] found numerous positively
selected sites and showed that most of them are Antigen
Recognition Sites (ARS). The same data set was also used
in [11], to examine if the new method identifies the same
sites as the original method. We also analyzed the abalone
sperm lysin data from [23], with regard to the hydrophobicity, volume, polarity and charge physicochemical
properties. We specified each of the four physicochemical
properties: volume, hydrophobicity, charge, and polarity
partitions with both Model A1 and A2 in these analyses.
Simulated data
The result of the simulation analysis is summarized in
Table 2 and Figure 2. When the correct partition was used,
both the LRT and the posterior Bayesian categorization
were very accurate. When simulated data set 1 (with ω≤1
and γ>1) was analyzed using the volume partition (the
same partition that the data was simulated from) and
there was positive selection acting only on codon substitutions that altered the volume of the encoded amino
acids, 99% of the sites were correctly identified as being in
the ω≤1, γ>1 category. Moreover, the LRTs performed
between Model A1 versus Model A2 on the 100 replicates
were all significant. When the data was simulated with
ω>1 and γ<1 (data set 2), 97% of the sites were classified

in the correct site class, and none of the LRTs between
Models A1 and A2 were significant, as expected.
Amino acids that differ in volume may also differ in other
physicochemical properties. Positive selection on another
physicochemical property may then be inferred, even
though selection may have truly targeted volume. To illustrate this concept and better understand its effect, we
repeated the data analysis with other physicochemical
properties. We partitioned the amino acids into those
with high (A, C, I, V, L, M, F, Y, W, H, T, K, R) and low (R,
G, S, D, E, N, Q) hydrophobicity. In each replicate, data
was simulated assuming selection only targeted volume,
but was analyzed under the hydrophobicity partition. In
this case the resulting LRTs were all significant for both

data set 1 and data set 2 (ω>1 and γ>1). The results were
significant for data set 1 when the hydrophobicity physicochemical property was used due to some volume altering
codon changes that are hydrophobicity altering as well
(52 out of the 99 distinct amino acid pairs that differ in
volume). Likewise, since there are some volume conserving nonsynonymous codon changes that are hydrophobicity altering (44 out of the 91 distinct amino acid pairs
that differ in hydrophobicity), the LRTs were significant
for data set 2 as well. Thus, the extent of overlap between
two sets of distinct amino acid pairs, where each set contains pairs that differ with respect to one of the two given
physicochemical properties, ultimately determines our
ability to distinguish between the two properties, in terms
of being exclusively targeted by positive selection. None-

theless, our method can reliably identify the true physicochemical property in addition to other properties that
have considerable overlap with the true property.
Data sets 3 and 4 were simulated with ω = γ, in which case
our model reduces to the original Goldman and Yang 94
model [14]. Our method classified = 99% of the sites correctly with respect to both volume and hydrophobicity
partitions for both data set 3 (ω≤1 and γ≤1) and data set 4
(ω>1 and γ>1).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of the posterior probabilities for the correct site class classification in each of the

probabilities close to one indicating that assignments of
the sites into their site classes can be done with high confidence.

of Model A2 against Model A1 were significant in all the
partitions examined; indicating that a significant amount
of positive selection is acting on the codon substitutions
that change the physicochemical property under study.
We also found that, for each partition, there are a fair proportion of sites that are in the (ω<1, γ>1) category, suggesting positive selection acting on the particular
physicochemical property.
However, when we looked at the sites that were identified
in the previous study [11] with high posterior probabilities of being positively selected with respect to a particular
physicochemical property; we found that some of these
sites were positively selected regardless of the physicochemical property of the amino acids they code for (Table
4). For instance, almost all the posterior probability mass
of the 3 sites that were identified for positive selection
with respect to the volume partition (63, 67, 93) were
more likely to be in the categories with ω>1; and the posterior probabilities of being in the (ω≤1, γ>1) category
were almost 0. The same was observed for the polarity par-

tition. Nevertheless, the posterior probabilities of being in
the (ω≤1, γ>1) category were relatively high at sites 45,114
and 156 (sites that were previously identified to be positively selected with respect to charge), although they were
still more likely to be in the (ω>1, γ>1) category. The main
reason for this discrepancy between our study and that of
[11] is due to the manner in which physicochemical selection is defined and measured. [11] defined the parameter
gamma to be the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions
that alter the property of the encoded amino acids and
scale it relative to the rate of all other codon substitutions
pooled together, i.e. both synonymous substitutions and

property-conserving nonsynonymous substitutions.
However, we extended their model to allow for a separation of the pooled scaling rate into rates of nonsynonymous property-conserving substitutions and synonymous
substitutions. This naturally implies that our parameter
gamma is not equivalent to their gamma even if the
underlying physicochemical property is the same. However, our parameterization is biologically more realistic
since it allows a more sensible scaling with respect to the
synonymous substitution rate.

The abalone sperm lysin dataset
The results of the analysis of the abalone sperm lysin data,
when amino acids are categorized according to hydrophobicity, volume, polarity and charge are shown in Table 5.
1) The charge partition
Our method identified sites belonging to all 4 classes with
high posterior probabilities. We compared with the
results obtained by [23] (M3 in Table 4) using the PAML
software [20]. We found that all sites in the (ω≥1, γ≥1) site
class were also classified as positively selected sites (posterior probabilities > 0.95) by [23] using model M3 of the
standard framework. On the other hand, none of the sites
in the ω<1 site classes (ω<1, γ<1 and ω<1, γ≥1) were classified as positively selected in their study. Thus, our results
identified additional categories of putatively positively
selected sites in which selection seems to have favored

substitutions that alter specific physiochemical properties
of the amino acids.
Figure 3 illustrates that positively selected sites tend to
cluster together in the 3-dimensional protein structure.
Although some sites in the (ω≥1, γ<1) site class were identified previously as being positively selected, there are 12
sites (Sites 30, 47, 63, 71, 75, 79, 80, 81, 99, 116, 121 and
124) that were not (See Figure 3). These sites were probably under positive selection as well but under the constraint that they had to maintain the same charge. Our
method may have more power than the original model to
identify positively selected sites when positive selection is

only targeting a particular physiochemical property while
the site remains conserved with respect to other properties.
2) The volume partition
There are a number of sites that are targeted for positive
selection with respect to the volume property (ω≤1, γ>1),
however none of the positively selected sites are conserved
under this partition. This may indicates that volume is an
important property targeted by positive selection. It is
worth mentioning that most of the sites in the (ω≤1, γ>1)
site class are adjacent in the 3D structure to a positively
selected site previously identified by [23]. For instance,
sites 40, 73, 114, 131 are adjacent to sites 41, 74, 113, 132
(Figure 4), and site 127 is adjacent to 126. It is possible
that, as [11] pointed out earlier on the basis of the vast
site-directed mutagenetic literature, substitutions involving volume change of the residues may slightly change the
structure of the peptide which in turns improves the ability to incorporate new mutations.

Discussion
A major limitation of the current approach is that the correct partition cannot be directly inferred from the data.
The method cannot statistically identify which amino acid
property is being targeted by positive selection without
input from the user, however, the program can be used to
explore pre-defined hypotheses regarding positive (or
negative) selection. Our simulation study showed that
when the correct partition has been specified, the method
can accurately detect positive selection acting on the associated amino acid property.
We note that the similarities between amino acids are
probably better described by continuous functions. Much
work has been done on continuous models (e.g. [14,16])
in the context of codon-based likelihood models. However, in the framework of mixture models that allow variation across sites, these approaches are not
computationally tractable and require a discrete approximation over many categories in multiple dimensions. Our
new method provides more information than previous
methods and yet maintains computational efficiency.
We also want to note that the regularity conditions for the
χ2 approximation are not satisfied with the LRT between
A2 and A1. This is because when either of the parameters
p3 or p4 hit the boundary of the parameter space (i.e. when
p3 = 0 or p4 = 0), either ω1 or both ω1 and γ1 is non-identifiable.

physicochemical property may also differ with respect to
other properties, it is not possible with the current
method to exclude that selection has been targeting other
properties over the one specified by the user.
Positive selection inferred by the new method informs the
user that there are more substitutions between amino acid
in the chosen partition than expected under neutral evolution. A clear advantage of our method over methods
that do not take physicochemical properties into account
is that it can detect positive selection when selection is
only acting on some particular subset of nonsynonymous
substitutions, while conserving others. Thus, positive and
negative selection acting on the same protein residue can
be inferred simultaneously for any specified physicochemical property in a site-specific manner.
This method can also be used to examine the pattern of
negative selection in proteins that may not be under positive selection. In many cases, it would be interesting to
explore which residues are conserved predominantly with
respect to a particular physicochemical property. Site specific models of physicochemical selection provide a more
statistically rigorous framework for finding sites that are
under selection than method that are based on calculating
amino acid content in particular sites without taking the
underlying phylogenetic tree into account.

Conclusion
We see this new method as a step forward in incorporating
information regarding physicochemical properties into
studies of positive selection, as well as a step towards
methods that allow identification of selection acting on
particular amino acid properties, without any prior specification by the user of which properties to examine. Models that allow site-specific selection on different amino
acid properties will be an important tool in studies of
molecular evolution and should help bridge the gap
between structural biology and molecular evolution.
