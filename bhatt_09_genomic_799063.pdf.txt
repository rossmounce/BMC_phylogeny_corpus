Abstract
Background: Plasmodium parasites are causative agents of malaria which affects >500 million
people and claims ~2 million lives annually. The completion of Plasmodium genome sequencing and
availability of PlasmoDB database has provided a platform for systematic study of parasite genome.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are pivotal enzymes for protein translation and other vital
cellular processes. We report an extensive analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum genome to identify
and classify aaRSs in this organism.
Results: Using various computational and bioinformatics tools, we have identified 37 aaRSs in P.
falciparum. Our key observations are: (i) fraction of proteome dedicated to aaRSs in P. falciparum
is very high compared to many other organisms; (ii) 23 out of 37 Pf-aaRS sequences contain signal
peptides possibly directing them to different cellular organelles; (iii) expression profiles of Pf-aaRSs
vary considerably at various life cycle stages of the parasite; (iv) several PfaaRSs posses very unusual
domain architectures; (v) phylogenetic analyses reveal evolutionary relatedness of several parasite
aaRSs to bacterial and plants aaRSs; (vi) three dimensional structural modelling has provided
insights which could be exploited in inhibitor discovery against parasite aaRSs.
Conclusion: We have identified 37 Pf-aaRSs based on our bioinformatics analysis. Our data reveal
several unique attributes in this protein family. We have annotated all 37 Pf-aaRSs based on
predicted localization, phylogenetics, domain architectures and their overall protein expression
profiles. The sets of distinct features elaborated in this work will provide a platform for
experimental dissection of this family of enzymes, possibly for the discovery of novel drugs against
malaria.

Background
Aminoacylation is the process of adding an aminoacyl
group to the 3' end (CCA) of the tRNA molecule. tRNA is
aminoacylated with a specific amino acid by aminoacyltRNA synthetase (aaRSs). aaRSs are responsible for attaching correct amino acid onto the cognate tRNA molecule in
a two-step reaction. The amino acid is first activated with
ATP forming an aminoacyladenylate intermediate. Once
activated, this amino acid is transferred to the 3' end of its
corresponding tRNA molecule to be processed during protein synthesis. All aaRSs require divalent cation MgCl2 for
their aminoacylation reaction [1,2].
Reaction:
1. amino acid + ATP → aminoacyl-AMP + PPi
2. aminoacyl-AMP + tRNA → aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP
The aaRSs are divided into two major classes based on
structural topology of their active sites. Class I aaRSs represent 11 amino acids, including Arg, Cys, Gln, Glu, Ile,
Leu, Lys, Met, Val, Trp and Tyr. Class II aaRSs includes 10
amino acids - Ala, Asp, Asn, Gly, His, Lys, Phe, Pro, Ser
and Thr. Core domains of class I enzymes are characterized by a Rossmann fold which consists of α-helices and
β-pleated sheets. This domain contains two conserved
motifs ('HIGH' and 'KMSKS') which are directly involved
in ATP binding. Catalytic domain of class II enzymes has
a unique fold with a central core of anti-parallel β strands
flanked by α helices [3]. There are three weakly conserved
motifs, two of them are involved in ATP binding while the
third one plays a role in homo dimerization. Class I
enzymes bind ATP in an extended conformation while
class II do so in a bent conformation. The two aaRS classes
have different modes of aminoacylation - class I enzymes
aminoacylate the 2'OH of the cognate tRNA whereas class
II enzymes aminoacylate 3'OH of the tRNA (with the
exception of PheRS) [4]. All known aaRSs are multidomain proteins with complex modular architectures [5]. In
addition, eukaryotic aaRSs are distinguished by the presence of appended domains at either the N- or C-terminus
which are generally absent from their bacterial/archaeal
counterparts [6]. These appendages to the catalytic cores
of several aaRSs are non-catalytic and instead function to
mediate protein- protein interactions or act as general
RNA-binding domains [7-9].
In mammalian cells, some aaRSs are present as a larger
multi- aaRS complex (MSC) composed of nine synthetases (arginyl-, aspartyl-, glutamyl-, glutaminyl-, leucyl-, lysyl-, isoleucyl-, methionyl- and prolyl-tRNA
synthetases) [10-12]. The MSC is composed of a mixture
of class I and class II aaRSs along with three non- aaRS
proteins p38, p43 and p18. It is not clear why certain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/644

aaRSs exist as a complex while some are in free form. MSC
might help in efficient protein synthesis by preventing
mixing of charged tRNAs with cellular pool and by
increasing local concentration of tRNA near the site of
protein synthesis [13].
The accuracy of tRNA aminoacylation reaction is critical
in ensuring fidelity in protein translation [14]. To achieve
this accuracy, some aaRS enzymes possess a proofreading
(editing) mechanism that hydrolyzes tRNAs aminoacylated with the non-cognate amino acid [15]. For example, editing domains may be found attached to alanyltRNA synthetase (AlaRS), leucyltRNA synthetase (LeuRS)
and so on [16-21]. In other cases, the editing domain is
not attached to aaRS but rather functions as an individual
protein [22,23]. For example, YbaK protein from Haemophilus influenza is capable of efficiently editing Cys-tRNAPro [24]. ThrRS has been shown to have another editing
domain called NTD which can cleave the bond between
D-amino acid and tRNA [25].
Recently it has been shown that aaRSs are not only
involved in protein synthesis but also perform many noncatalytic and non-canonical roles in RNA processing/trafficking, apoptosis, rRNA synthesis, angiogenesis and
inflammation [26-30]. These versatile properties of aaRSs
are the outcome of their differential cellular localization,
nucleic acid binding properties, protein-protein interactions and collaboration (fusion) with additional
domains. In case of malaria parasite, apicoplast proteins
and pathways have already received particular attention as
drug targets [31]. In this work we present a study of aaRSs
from P. falciparum - the most virulent agent of human
malaria. Our aim for this study was to use bioinformatics
tools to (a) discover special and unusual modules present
in parasite aaRSs which are potentially absent from
human homologues, and (b) to identify potential new
drug targets based on this protein family.

Results and Discussion
Sequence extraction and analysis
We exploited current annotation available in PlasmoDB
[32] to identify the repertoire of aaRSs in P. falciparum
genome. According to Enzyme Commission (EC) 37 proteins in PlasmoDB (see additional file 1) are annotated as
belonging to the EC group 6.1.1. (EC number provided
for aaRSs). Although in many cases current annotations
allow an assignment to Class I or II of aaRSs, for some
annotations are still preliminary. Due to this, we used
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for identifying aaRSs in
P. falciparum. For each aaRS a set of known sequences was
utilized to construct 20 HMMs (see methods for details).
For each database search a score distribution was obtained
and 4 cutoffs were considered to identify aaRS. Results are
reported in Table 1. We observed that 2 proteins anno-

tated as belonging to EC group 6.1.1.- in PlasmoDB are
not found by HMMs - PF14_0401 annotated as MetRS is
instead a generic tRNA binding protein as elucidated in
the genome re-annotation process, while the second one
(PFC0470w) is still mis-annotated as ValRS. A total of 18
Pf-aaRSs can be classified within the 10 aaRSs that define
class I. All members of this class are represented in the P.
falciparum proteome. The annotations of these sequences
are summarized in additional file 1. Similar to class I PfaaRSs, the class II Pf-aaRSs have a total of 18 sequences for
10 different amino acid synthetases. Four genes are
present in P. falciparum for PheRS but these likely encode
for 1 heterodimeric and 2 monomeric versions of PheRS.
In order to carry out comparative analyses of aaRSs of P.
falciparum with those of other species we considered aaRS
sequences from several organisms representing three
domains of life (see methods section). As expected, we
found variable number of aaRSs in different species. M.
jannaschii (archaebacteria) and M. tuberculosis (bacteria)
have the lowest aaRSs count amongst other organisms like
E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. discoidium, P. falciparum, O. sativa,
R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. Human
bears the highest number of aaRSs in this analysis (Figure
1a). Our analysis also shows that P. falciparum has the
highest aaRS fraction (relative to its proteome size) when
compared with bacteria, yeast and human counterparts
(Figure 1b). The number of individual aaRS varies in different species. For example, when individual aaRSs from

human and P. falciparum were compared it was evident
that AlaRS and ThrRS were higher in number in humans
(Figure 2). Presence of more than one copy of each aaRS
in an organism may indicate additional biological, temporal or spatial roles for these enzymes as several aaRSs
also perform non-canonical functions [33]. In this work
we describe in detail the 37 Pf-aaRSs.
Indirect pathways of aminoacylation
It was earlier believed that 20 aaRSs were necessary for the
incorporation of 20 amino acids in proteins. But surprisingly, some archaea, bacteria and chloroplasts lack GlnRS
and AsnRS enzymes [34-38]. Interestingly, these organisms use an alternate pathway based on tRNA dependent
amino acid transformation. A non-discriminating GluRS
charges tRNAGln with glutamic amino acid and then a second enzyme called tRNA-dependent amidotransferase
(AdT) amidates glutamate to make glutamine. A corresponding reaction occurs in case of asparagine residues. In
case of P. falciparum, occurrence of glutamate-tRNA synthetase (PF13_0257, MAL13P1.281) and amidotransferase subunit A (PFD0780w) & subunit B (PFF1395c)
together indicates presence of both direct and indirect
pathways for aminoacylation [39,40]. Both subunits of
amidotransferase have apicoplast targeting signals suggesting an indirect pathway for aminoacylation in P. falciparum apicoplast. The expression of Pf-AdT subunit A is
predicted in all life cycle stages of parasite based on proteomic and microarray data. We therefore feel that this

expressed at asexual life cycle stages of P. falciparum. A
mitochondrial targeting signal was also predicted for parasite p43 but the role of p43 in parasite remains to be
explored experimentally.

pathway must also be active in the parasite apicoplast. We
could not find sequence homologues of enzymes
involved in indirect aminoacylation of cysteine residues
[41-43] in the proteome of P. falciparum.
The multi-synthetase complex (MSC)
In mammalian cells, some aaRSs are present as a larger
multi-aaRS complex (MSC). A constituent of the MSC protein p43 - has sequence homologue (PF14_0401 EMAP-II-like cytokine) in P. falciparum although there is
no evidence for presence of MSC in malaria parasites.
Interestingly, p43 is not only required for stability of the
MSC complex but also functions as a proinflammatory
cytokine [44-46]. Role of p43 homolog in P. falciparum is
unknown, but evidence from other organisms indicates
that MSC functions in protein stability, efficient protein
translation and protein elongation [47]. Sequence identity between P. falciparum p43 and its human homolog is
~24% and based on microarray data p43 seems to be

Targeting of aaRSs in the parasite
aaRSs are not only involved in protein synthesis but also
in various other cellular activities including intron splicing, translational regulation and tRNA channeling. Diversified roles for aaRSs necessitate their presence (transit)
into various cellular compartments. We therefore analyzed P. falciparum aaRS sequences for presence of putative signal sequences predicted by MITOPROT,
PredictNLS and PATS for mitochondria, nucleus and apicoplast respectively. We found that 23 P. falciparum aaRSs
have signal peptides, possibly for directing them to different cellular organelles. Another 14 aaRSs from P. falciparum may be resident in the parasite cytoplasm (Figure
3a). Apicoplast is known to have protein synthesis
machinery which may use aaRSs [48]. Trafficking of
nuclear encoded aaRSs to the apicoplast may explain why
~20 out of 37 Pf-aaRSs have apicoplast targeting signals.
Our data indicate that out of total ~20 Pf-aaRSs bearing
apicoplast targeting signals, ~12 aaRSs may be exclusive to
this organelle. Others are predicted to be shared between
apicoplast, nucleus and mitochondria (Figure 3b). It has
been earlier shown that some tRNAs need to be aminoacylated in the nucleus before they can be exported to the
cytoplasm, an observation indicating occurrence of aminoacylation reaction (mediated by aaRSs) inside the
nucleus [49]. In P. falciparum, we found 10 aaRSs with
nuclear localization signals but only one is predicted to be
exclusively resident in the nucleus (PFA0480w- PheRS).
Interestingly, we found no Pf-aaRS sequences with specific
PEXEL (Plasmodium export element) motifs. This motif is
found in parasite proteins that are exported beyond the
parasitophorous vacuole membrane [50,51].
Expression profiles of P. falciparum aaRSs
In order to study expression of aaRS during life cycle of the
malaria parasite, we took advantage of available transcriptomics and proteomics data from PLASMODB. Firstly, we
analyzed proteomic data from several independent experiments and compared them with transcriptomics data by
Le Roch [52]. The latter sets of data were obtained using
the affimetrix technology and hence provide a quantitative measure of mRNA levels in the parasite. Our results
are provided in Table 2. Interestingly, we found that
mRNA levels of potential apicoplast proteins (AP in the
table) are lower on average (mean1 = 44.6; mean2 = 41.5;
gam = 91.3; spor = 58.1) than those of potential cytoplasmic proteins (mean1 = 259; mean2 = 264.8; gam = 174.8;
spor = 73.8). Proteomic data confirmed that while the
cytoplasmic aaRS are found in almost all stages, the apicoplast aaRS are rarely found in the parasite. This could be
in part due to experimental limits in the identification of

apicoplast proteins by mass spectrometry. Indeed, when
we carried out a chi-quadro test we found that proteins
predicted to be targeted to apicoplast are significantly less
represented (p < 10-4) in the sample of proteins identified
by mass spectrometry. For these reasons we limited analysis of gene expression profiles only for putative cytoplasmic proteins. We considered trascriptomics data for sexual
stages and asexual stages [52,53]. We considered a
reduced set of the time course gene expression data (22
time points instead of 48) and normalized data by Le
Roch (see methods for details). This allowed us to analyse
the expression of aaRS genes along all the intra-erythrocytic life cycle of the parasite (Table 2). Further observations of the protein expression profiles indicated that
some aaRSs were exclusively detected at specific stages
like, LeuRS (PF08_0011) and AspRS (PFE0715w) in sporozoites; IleRS (PFL1210w), SerRS (PF07_0073), GlnRS
(PF13_0170),
HisRS
(PF14_0428)
and
PheRS
(PFA0480w) in merozoites; AsnRS (PFE0475w), PheRS
(PF11_0051) and HisRS (PFI1645c) in trophozoites and
TrpRS (PF13_0205) in gametocyte stages (Figure 4).
Domain architecture of P. falciparum aaRSs
aaRSs are multi-domain proteins typically consisting of a
conserved catalytic domain and an anti-codon binding
domain. In addition, some aaRSs have RNA binding and
editing domains that cleave incorrectly aminoacylated
tRNA molecules [54]. Additional functional domains may
be appended to aaRSs in the course of biological evolution [55,56]. Careful examination of 37 identified P. falciparum aaRSs using Pfam database showed that most of
them have a generic modular architecture that adheres to
prototypical aaRSs (Figure 5). The remaining P. falciparum
aaRSs or related proteins like PF14_0423 (protein having
serine-threonine kinase domain in fusion with an anti-

codon binding module) have complex domain architectures. In several, concatenation of unusual domains such
as Ybak, GST, Ser-Thr kinase and DNA binding domains is
evident (Figure 5). The functional relevance of these additional domains fused to typical aaRS in P. falciparum
needs to be experimentally addressed. Intriguingly, two of
the four Pf-PheRS subunits contain DNA binding domains
(PF11_0051, PFA0480w). It is likely that the PheRS, in
addition to its aminoacylation function, influences other
cellular processes via DNA binding [57]. Consistent with
its potential DNA binding property, the P. falciparum
PheRS (PFA0480w) has a nuclear localization signal. The
CysRS of B. subtilis (which also contains a DNA binding
domain) is believed to play a role in initiating chromosomal replication [58]. Therefore, functional roles for P.
falciparum PheRSs may extend from aminoacylation to
DNA recognition and replication - a suggestion that
requires experimental investigation. Similarly, it has been
shown that GST or GST homology domains can help in
complex formation of aaRSs with multifunctional factors
(p38, p18) [56,57]. Additional data show that deletion of
GST homology domain from the C-terminal region of p38
results in the dissociation of EPRS (Glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA
synthetase) and MetRS from the MSC complex [59]. Mammalian ValRS associated with elongation factor subunits
also contain the GST homology domain [60-62]. Thus,
the presence of GST domains might be a crucial feature of
aaRSs. P. falciparum proteome has two such proteins with
GST domains appended to MetRS (PF10_0340) and
GluRS (PF13_0257). We also found a most interesting
fusion of anticodon binding domain with a serine-threonine kinase (PF14_0423) in P. falciparum. This unusual
kinase seems to be expressed throughout the life cycle of
parasite (microarray data) and interestingly is predicted to
be localized to the parasite nucleus. Clearly, the presence

of unusual domain fusions in P. falciparum aaRSs suggests
multiple functional roles for many of these P. falciparum
enzymes as has been shown in other organisms.
Phylogenetics
Overall the percentage identity between matching human
and P. falciparum aaRS domains varies from 17 to 51.
Clearly, Pf-aaRSs which have low sequence identity with
human counterparts might serve as good drug targets. In
order to study evolutionary relationships of P. falciparum
aaRSs with other species, phylogenetic trees were developed in PHYML using maximum likelihood method. For
each type of P. falciparum aaRS a separate tree was constructed (see additional file 2). aaRS sequences from 102
different species were used for multiple sequence alignments. As an example, phylogenetic tree of TyrRS from
various species (including two sequences from P. falciparum) was constructed. Interestingly, one Pf-TyrRS

(MAL8P1.125) clustered with human TyrRS whereas the
second Pf-TyrRS (PF11_0181) clustered with bacterial
TyrRS indicating different evolutionary origins (Figure
6a). Based on distance matrices, several P. falciparum
aaRS sequences clustered as being closer to plants (A. thaliana) or to bacteria (E. coli) (Figure 6b). It is already
known that apicomplexan parasites like P. falciparum
house a secondary endosymbiotic plastid, possibly
hijacked by lateral genetic transfer from an alga. Therefore, the P. falciparum aaRS sequences which are evolutionary close to bacteria and plants are likely to be the
outcome of horizontal gene transfer from the plastid. P.
falciparum contains ~12 such aaRS sequences which cluster with bacterial or plant sequences. Functional and
structural characterization of these bacterial/plant-like
aaRS may be relevant in focusing efforts at using aaRS as
drug targets.

Homology modeling and structure comparisons
To date, no crystal structures have been obtained for any
aaRS from P. falciparum. Hence, we performed homology
modeling of several P. falciparum aaRSs using homologous structures available in PDB. Known structural templates (≥ 40% identity) were used for molecular modeling
of several P. falciparum aaRSs including the two TyrRSs
(PF11_0181, MAL8P1.125), the PheRS (PFA0480w),
ThrRS (PF11_0270), LysRS (PF13_0262), MetRS
(PF10_0340) and TrpRS (PF13_0205). The program
Align2D (sequence alignment module in Modeller) was
used to perform dynamic programming-based global
alignments of the target and template sequences. This program uses variable gap penalty for structural loops and
core regions using information derived from template
structures. We found key differences in the conserved
motifs in various aaRSs. For example, the class I motif
'KYSKS' in P. falciparum TyrRS (PF11_0181) and 'KMSKS'
in MAL8P1.125 differs from 'KLGKS' of human mitochondrial TyrRS (2PID) and 'KMSSS' of human cytoplasmic (1N3L) respectively. Similarly, class I motif 'HIGH'
has subtle sequences variations between P. falciparum and
H. sapiens TyrRSs (Figure 7a, Table 3). Using the above
procedures, we could generate structural models for several Pf-aaRSs. Stereo-chemical qualities of the generated
protein models were assessed using PROCHECK (85-90%
residues are in allowed regions of Ramachandran plot).
The overall superimposed three-dimension models were
visualized in CHIMERA and PYMOL (Figure 7b). Many
sequence insertions were observed for P. falciparum
enzymes when compared to their homologous [63]. Location of insertions in P. falciparum TyrRS between well-con-

served secondary structures suggests ability of TyrRS
anticodon binding core to accommodate larger sequence
inserts with minimum disruption to the catalytic domain.
Direct comparison of modeled P. falciparum aaRSs with
human aaRSs revealed several other important structural
differences. For example, numerous insertions are present
in the loop regions linking various α-helices (α10 to α13)
in anticodon binding domain of P. falciparum TyrRSs
(PF11_0181 and MAL8p1.125) when compared to its
human homologous (2PID and 1N3L) respectively. Structural differences between TyrRS (from P. falciparum) and
human counterparts are summarized in Table 3 and
shown in Figure 7c. These subtle structural changes that
manifest as partial conservation of important motifs in P.
falciparum aaRSs reflect evolutionary divergence, and may
be useful for exploitation of parasite-specific features as
drug targets.

Conclusion
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) link RNA with protein translation. Besides their key role in protein synthesis,
aaRSs are also integral to various other cellular processes.
aaRS enzymes have been the focus for antimicrobial drug
discovery [64,65]. An example of clinical application of
an aaRS inhibitor is provided by the antibiotic mupirocin
(marketed as Bactroban), which selectively inactivates
bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase [66]. Similarly, it has
been shown that the broad-spectrum antifungal 5-fluoro1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole
(AN2690)
inhibits yeast cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase by
blocking editing site of the enzyme [67,68]. Therefore,
presence of distinct or tinkered P. falciparum aaRS lends an

opportunity for their exploitation as new drug targets
against malaria. In this study, we have extensively analyzed aaRS sequences from Plasmodium species in terms of
their mRNA/protein expression profiles, their cellular
localization, their organelle targeting and their unique
sequence/domain attributes. We have discovered several
distinct aaRSs in P. falciparum with no clear human counterparts in terms of their overall domain structures. We
have also highlighted deviations of some highly conserved sequence motifs and active site sequence clusters.
Our analyses clearly show that a larger fraction of P. falci-

parum proteome is devoted to aaRS when compared with
many other organisms. The phylogenetic data hint at evolutionary closeness of some Pf-aaRSs to bacteria and
plants - this further supports the fact of secondary endosymbiosis in this apicomplexan. We hope that our indepth phylogenetic, protein targeting, domain architecture, protein expression profiling and homology modeling data on Pf-aaRSs can be used as a platform for
experimental studies of this important protein family in
malaria parasites.

were obtained based on sequence similarity via NCBI
BLAST [69] and ENSEMBL [70] databases. Known
sequence motifs of aaRSs have been used as templates to
retrieve sequences of aaRS from other organisms. Some
aaRS sequences were manually annotated based on the
presence of signature motifs. Protein domains and motifs
in the predicted aaRSs were identified using following programs - Superfamily [71], SMART [72] and MotifScan available at expasy web server. The following databases - Pfam
[73], TIGR, PIR, EBI and PlasmoDB were also extensively
used. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each of the 20
aaRS were constructed by the software package Sequence
Alignment and Modeling System version 2.2.1 (SAM) [74]
exploiting sequences in the aaRS database [75]. HMM profiles were then used to carry out database search vs P. falciparum proteins. A score was assigned to each protein by
calculating the probability that the corresponding sequence
is generated by the HMM model, hence for each database
search a score distribution was obtained. The score distributions were normalized and 4 ranges of values were considered to identify aaRS (c > 5, 10 < c < 20, 20 < c < 50, c < 50).
Expression and Localization
The prediction of signal sequences for cellular localization
in P. falciparum was performed using various available
online web-servers - MITOPROT [76], PredictNLS [77]
and PATS [78] for mitochondria, nucleus and apicoplast
respectively. PEXEL motif prediction was been carried out
by querying PlasmoDB. To identify specific gene expression profiles, we have combined information from different data sets. For the spotted oligonucleotide array data,
only half of the 48 time points of the intra-erythrocytic
cycle are shown for simplicity, and ratios (versus a common reference) were log2-transformed prior to cluster
analysis. For the photolithography data, CEL files were
downloaded from website and transferred into Bioconductor package for analysis using a robust multi-array
averaging algorithm (RMA) for background adjustment
and quantiles normalization [79]. Genes whose expres-

sion level was less than 10 (too close to background) or
the logP was greater than -0.5 (too few probes per gene)
were removed from dataset. Total intensity values for each
time point were converted to mean-centered ratios by
dividing the total intensity by the average intensity for that
gene across all experimental conditions and were then
log2-transformed prior to clustering. These data manipulations were necessary because the oligo-nucleotide array
data was collected as the intensity ratio between the experimental sample and a common reference, while the photolithography data was collected as the total signal
intensity at each spot. Gene expression patterns where the
minimum percentage of existing values was less than 80%
were eliminated from rest of the analysis. The remaining
missing values were replaced by using the KNN-imputation method [80].
Phylogenetic analysis
To explore the evolutionary relationships amongst aaRSs
phylogenetic analyses were performed for each P. falciparum aaRS on an expanded set of 102 sequences. Multiple sequence alignments of these sequences were
obtained from CLUSTALW with default parameters (performed locally) in PHYLIP format [81]. These MSAs were
used as seed sequences to run PHYML_v2.4.4 using JonesTaylor-Thornton (JTT) model [82]. The resulting file was
further used in MEGA4.2 for visualization of trees [83].
Model Building and Validation
We used Sali's Modeller8v2 [84] tool for building various
P. falciparum aaRSs models. The stereo-chemical quality of
modeled proteins was verified by PROCHECK [85]. Structural mapping of active site residues and other motifs was
performed using CHIMERA [86] and PYMOL [87].
