Evolutionary patterns of two major reproduction
candidate genes (Zp2 and Zp3) reveal no
contribution to reproductive isolation between
bovine species
Shanyuan Chen, Vânia Costa, Albano Beja-Pereira*

Abstract
Background: It has been established that mammalian egg zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins are responsible for
species-restricted binding of sperm to unfertilized eggs, inducing the sperm acrosome reaction, and preventing
polyspermy. In mammals, ZP apparently represents a barrier to heterospecific fertilization and thus probably
contributes to reproductive isolation between species. The evolutionary relationships between some members of
the tribe Bovini are complex and highly debatable, particularly, those involving Bos and Bison species for which
interspecific hybridization is extensively documented. Because reproductive isolation is known to be a major
precursor of species divergence, testing evolutionary patterns of ZP glycoproteins may shed some light into the
speciation process of these species. To this end, we have examined intraspecific and interspecific genetic variation
of two ZP genes (Zp2 and Zp3) for seven representative species (111 individuals) from the Bovini tribe, including
five species from Bos and Bison, and two species each from genera Bubalus and Syncerus.
Results: A pattern of low levels of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence was detected for the
two sequenced fragments each for Zp2 and Zp3. At intraspecific level, none of neutrality tests detected deviations
from neutral equilibrium expectations for the two genes. Several haplotypes in both genes were shared by
multiple species from Bos and Bison.
Conclusions: Here we argue that neither ancestral polymorphism nor introgressive hybridization alone can fully
account for haplotype sharing among species from Bos and Bison, and that both scenarios have contributed to
such a pattern of haplotype sharing observed here. Additionally, codon-based tests revealed strong evidence for
purifying selection in the Zp3 coding haplotype sequences and weak evidence for purifying selection in the Zp2
coding haplotype sequences. Contrary to a general genetic pattern that genes or genomic regions contributing to
reproductive isolation between species often evolve rapidly and show little or no gene flow between species,
these results demonstrate that, particularly, those sequenced exons of the Zp2 and the Zp3 did not show any
contribution to reproductive isolation between the bovine species studied here.

Background
It is widely recognized that mammalian egg zona pellucida (ZP) plays critical roles during oogenesis, fertilization, and preimplantation development [1-3]. Initially,
three glycoproteins (ZP1-3) were identified and characterized in the mouse egg ZP [4], but recently an

additional ZP glycoprotein (ZP4) was also discovered in
several mammalian species, such as the laboratory rat,
human and primate species [5,6]. Over past two decades, extensive experimental studies have been conducted to assess the role of individual ZP glycoproteins
in mediating gamete recognition during fertilization. For
instance, ZP3 and ZP2 have been reported as primary
and secondary sperm receptors in mice [7]. Some studies further identified a region of mouse ZP3 that possesses sperm receptor activity and defined this region as

the ‘sperm combing-site’ located in the polypeptide
encoded by mouse Zp3 exon-7 [8-10]. However, some
other studies highlight a three-dimensional ZP structure
necessary for sperm binding, rather than individual proteins [11-13]. A recent study reveals that sperm-egg
recognition in mice depends on the cleavage status of
ZP2, but is unaffected by the ZP3 mutations at the
sperm combining-site (i.e., the Zp3 exon-7) [14].
Although the relative contribution of individual ZP
glycoproteins remains arguable, a large body of evidence
has established that mammalian ZP glycoproteins are
responsible for species-restricted binding of sperm to
unfertilized eggs, inducing the sperm acrosome reaction,
and preventing polyspermy [8,9]. There is no doubt that
mammalian egg ZP represents a barrier to heterospecific
fertilization [1], and thus probably somehow contributes
to reproductive isolation between species.
It is well known that proteins involved in reproduction, such as those mediating sperm-egg interactions,
often have undergone adaptive evolution, driven by positive natural selection [15-18]. Among those ZP glycoproteins in mammals, evidence for rapid evolution
resulted from positive selection has been found for both
ZP2 and ZP3 [19-22]. In addition, several amino acid
sites from both ZPs were identified to be under positive
selection [19-22]. Most strikingly, some of positively
selected sites in ZP3 are adjacent to or within the sperm
combing-site that is essential for binding activity. These
results provide support to several nonexclusive hypotheses including sperm competition, cryptic female choice,
sexual conflict, reinforcement, avoidance of heterospecific fertilization, and pathogen resistance, to interpret
this widespread phenomenon of rapid evolution in
reproductive proteins [15,18,23].
In mammals, earlier studies on molecular evolution of
reproductiveproteins primarily concentrated on diverged
species [e.g., [16,21,24]], while more recent studies have
shifted to examine genetic variation of reproductive proteins at both intraspecific and interspecific levels [e.g.,
[25-27]]. Such intra- and inter-specific studies would provide important insights into not just how genetic information flows from generation to generation within
species, but also how it has flowed from ancestral species
(i.e., the most recent common ancestor) to descendants.
Strikingly, there is so far an apparent lack of studies on
molecular evolution of reproductive proteins in a group
of closely related mammalian species, except for small
rodents [19,22,27]. Only few single nucleotide polymorphisms from reproduction-related loci have been
reported in several mountain ungulate species [28,29].
Herein we report genetic variation and evolutionary
patterns of two egg ZP glycoproteins (ZP2 and ZP3) at
both intra- and inter-specific levels in seven representative large mammalian species from the Bovini tribe.

The members of this tribe include large animals of great
economic and cultural significance to humans such as
domestic cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus), Asiatic
water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), and the yak (Bos grunniens), as well as some of the larger grazers including
African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), European bison or
wisent (Bison bonasus), and American bison (Bison
bison). Despite their importance, the naming of these
species from the Bovini tribe is still debatable and for
that reason we adopted the classification system suggested by Wilson and Reeder’s taxonomic reference
[30], complemented by the names of wild versus domestic animals [31]. Indeed, speciation between species
from Bos and Bison is considered incomplete as interspecific hybridization is still occurring [32-36]. The
degree of fertility of hybrids or crosses between Bos and
Bison species varies depending on which species pairs
are crossed. For instance, both female and male hybrids
between B. taurus and B. indicus are completely fertile,
whereas for interspecific hybridization between other
Bos and Bison species female hybrids are fertile and
male hybrids are sterile. Thus, these bovine species
apparently represent a good model system to test
whether ZP glycoproteins contribute to reproductive
isolation between such large mammalian species.

Methods
Samples and Genomic DNA Extraction

We analyzed a panel of bovine samples including:
domestic cattle (B. taurus and B. indicus), domestic yak
(B. grunniens), gayal (B. frontalis, supposed to be a
domestic form of gaur), European bison or wisent
(B. bonasus), Asiatic water buffalo (B. bubalis), and African buffalo (S. caffer). Tissue samples were collected
from countries across three continents: Yemen
(B. taurus, n = 9), Turkmenistan (B. taurus, n = 4;
B. indicus, n = 2), Kyrgyzstan (B. taurus, n = 5), Kazakhstan (B. taurus, n = 5), Mongolia (B. taurus, n = 3;
B. indicus, n = 1), China (B. grunniens, n = 11; B. bubalis, n = 4), India (B. indicus, n = 31; B. bubalis, n = 1),
Myanmar (B. frontalis, n = 6), Egypt (B. taurus, n = 3),
Morocco (B. taurus, n = 15), Kenya (S. caffer = 9), and
Portugal (B. bonasus = 2). Moreover, two individuals
each of domestic goat (Capra hircus) and sheep (Ovis
aries) were also included as outgroups. An endeavor was
made to avoid sampling related individuals. Genomic
DNA was extracted by DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
(QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany).
PCR Amplification and Sequencing

The primer pair Zp2-X8F (5’-CCA TCT CTA CAT
GGT GCC TCT-3’) and Zp2-X9R (5’-TTG TTT TGA
GGA GAG TTT TGC T-3’) was used to amplify a fragment spanning the exons 8-9 of Zp2 gene, whereas the

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:24

primer pair Zp3A-X3F (5’-TGC CAT TCA GGA CCA
CAG T-3’) and Zp3A-X4R (5’-GGA AGT CCA CGA
TGG TGT G-3’) was used to amplify a fragment spanning the exons 3-4 of Zp3 gene. Both primer pairs were
designed and tested to be polymorphic across several
closely related wild goat species [28]. PCR reactions
were performed in a 20 μl volume containing 10X PCR
Buffer, 3 (for the Zp2 primers) and 1.5 (for the Zp3 primers) mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 μM each primer,
0.4 U Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen), and
approximately 30 ng genomic DNA. The PCR mixture
underwent 10 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C,
30 s at 64 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, and final 10 min at
72 °C on GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR products were purified and sequenced for both strands, at the HighThroughput Genomics Unit (HTGU), Department of
Genome Sciences, University of Washington (http://
www.htseq.org/). Sequence trace files were checked and
aligned using software package DNASTAR v7.1 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). All sequences generated
for this study have been deposited in GenBank with
accession numbers HM631669-HM631711.
Data Analyses

Haplotype phases from sequences with heterozygous
sites were reconstructed by DnaSP v5.1 [37], which
exactly implements a coalescent-based Bayesian method
by PHASE 2.1.1 [38,39]. Five independent runs with
default options were initially performed to check for
consistency between runs and an additional run, with 10
times longer iterations, was conducted to obtain final
results. All diversity measures and neutrality tests such
as Tajima’s D [40], Fu and Li’s D and F [41], and Fay
and Wu’s H [42] were calculated at species level, using
DnaSP v5.1 [37]. The significance for these neutrality
tests was obtained using 10,000 coalescent simulations
in DnaSP. The average pairwise differences among seven
bovine species for the Zp2 and the Zp3 sequence data
were calculated by Arlequin v3.11 [43].
Phylogenetic relations among haplotype sequences
(including non-coding and coding) of the Zp2 and the
Zp3 were independently reconstructed by Bayesian
approach as implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2 [44]. The
prior best-fitting nucleotide substitution models were
separately selected for the coding and non-coding parts
of the Zp2 and the Zp3, respectively. Each model was
selected by Modeltest 3.7 [45] based on likelihood ratio
tests. The Kimura-2-paramter (K80) model (nst = 2,
rates = equal) with different ‘TRatio’ values was selected
for the coding and non-coding parts of the Zp2; The
K80 model with different ‘TRatio’ values and ‘Rates’
were selected for the coding (nst = 2, rates = gamma)
and non-coding (nst = 2, rates = equal) parts of

the Zp3. We applied the selected models with commend
‘unlink TRatio = (all) Statefreq = (all)’ to the coding and
non-coding partitions for both the Zp2 and Zp3 in
MrBayes analyses. Two independent analyses starting
from different random trees were performed, and four
MCMC chains were run for six million generations with
sampling every 100 generations. Six thousand trees were
discarded as burn-in, after checking for convergence.
Moreover, for the Zp2 and the Zp3 coding haplotype
sequences, we also constructed median-joining networks
[46] with program NETWORK version 4.510 (http://
www.fluxus-engineering.com/) to display relations
among haplotypes.
In addition, we calculated the number of synonymous
substitutions per synonymous site (dS) and the number
of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous
site (d N ) and their variances using bootstrap method
with 1000 replications in MEGA4.1 [47,48], for sequence
pairs of the Zp2 and the Zp3 coding haplotypes. With
this information, we tested the null hypothesis of neutrality (dN = dS) versus alternative hypotheses of positive
selection (d N > d S ) or purifying selection (d N < d S )
using a Z-test [47,48]. To further detect the presence
and the location of selection, the codon-based sequence
alignments of the Zp2 and the Zp3 coding haplotypes
were subjected to the sitewise likelihood-ratio (SLR) test
[49], guided by a neighbor-joining tree constructed
under p-distance model in MEGA4.1 [48].

Results
Sequence Polymorphism and Divergence

For the Zp2 gene, a 310-bp sequence fragment was
obtained after trimming the primer sequences, including 64 bp of the exon 8, 88 bp of the intron 8, and
158 bp of the exon 9. There were 26 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) (11 in non-coding region, 15 in
coding region) detected among all sequences including
the outgroup species, defining 11 haplotypes (see Additional file 1). Without the outgroup species, there was
a total of 15 SNPs (7 in coding region) in seven bovine
species.
For the Zp3 gene, a 279-bp sequence fragment was
obtained after trimming the primer sequences, including
43 bp of the exon 3, 81 bp of the intron 3, and 155 bp
of the exon 4. There were 37 SNPs (18 in noncoding
region and 19 in coding region) identified among all
sequences including the outgroup species, defining 20
haplotype sequences (see Additional file 2). After
removal of the outgroup species, there was a total of 25
SNPs (12 in coding region) in seven bovine species.
Notably, a two-codon repeat (or a 6-bp insertion of
CACACT) in the exon 4 was detected in one individual
of taurine cattle from Morocco (African lineage of
B. taurus).

Low levels of intraspecific polymorphism were found
in seven bovine species for the Zp2 and the Zp3
sequence fragments (Table 1). For example, no any single SNP was detected in 18 chromosomes of African
buffalo for the Zp2 and in 22 chromosomes of the yak
for the Zp3, respectively. Moreover, there was also no
any single SNP in four chromosomes of the European
bison for the two genes. At species level, four neutrality
tests based on the frequency spectrum were used to test
for deviations from neutral equilibrium expectations.
Despite the fact that different neutrality tests focus on
different aspects of the frequency spectrum (e.g., Tajima’s D on rare mutations, Fay and Wu’s H on high frequency mutations), but we found that none of the tests
was significant for the Zp2 or the Zp3 sequence data
across all species, where tests were applicable (Table 1).
As expected, we also observed low levels of sequence
divergence among seven bovine species (Table 2).
Among five species from Bos and Bison, the average
pairwise differences ranged from 0.033 to 1.395 for the
Zp2 and from 0.100 to 4.000 for the Zp3. Most distinctly, several haplotypes were shared by multiple species from Bos and Bison.
Phylogenetic Analyses

The Bayesian trees were constructed to display phylogenetic relations among the haplotype sequences (including non-coding and coding) for the Zp2 and the Zp3
genes (Figure 1). The branching pattern was nearly identical between the two phylogenies. Most noticeably, the

haplotype sequences from the same species were not
monophyletic. As expected, the five species from Bos
and Bison formed a monophyletic clade, but with unresolved internal relationships. The buffalo (Bubalus and
Syncerus) species versus non-buffalo (Bos and Bison)
species formed reciprocally monophyletic groups in the
Zp3 phylogeny, being similar to the phylogenetic tree by
MacEachern et al [50].
Network Analyses of Coding Haplotypes

There were eight coding haplotypes from the 222 bp
coding sequence fragment of the Zp2 gene, of which the
haplotypes Zp2cdh1 and Zp2cdh2 were predominant
and shared by four and five bovine species, respectively
(Figure 2a). Noticeably, only three haplotypes were identified in 194 chromosomes of five species from Bos and
Bison. For the Zp3 gene, 15 coding haplotypes were
defined by 19 coding SNPs (plus the two-codon repeat)
in the 198 bp coding sequence fragment, of which one
predominant haplotype Zp3cdh1 occurred 155 times,
shared by B. taurus, B. indicus and B. frontalis (Figure
3a). Interestingly, there was no any single nonsynonymous mutation detected in, at least, 10 mutation steps
from the Zp3cdh1 to the two outgroup species, i.e., the
domestic sheep and goat (Figure 3a).
Codon-based Tests of Selection

The Z-tests rejected the null hypothesis of neutrality (dN
= dS) in favor of the alternative hypothesis of purifying
selection (d N < d S ) for the Zp2 and the Zp3 coding

and the Zp3 (66 codons) coding haplotypes. In SLR test,
ω value <1 indicates purifying selection, while value >1
indicates positive selection [49]. We detected four
codons (corresponding to the amino acid positions 176,
179, 185 and 204 of the bovine ZP3 glycoprotein) under
purifying selection in the Zp3 data, showing ω values <
1 with a cutoff >95%, after correcting the SLR test for
multiple comparisons. However, no any specific codon
was detected to be under purifying selection in the Zp2
data.

eight Zp2 coding haplotypes, 14 were significant at the
5% level for Z-tests, but mainly confined in those
sequence pairs with the two outgroup species (see Additional file 3). However, 62 of 91 sequence pairs from the
14 Zp3 coding haplotypes were significant at the 5%
level for Z-tests, of which 37 were from sequence pairs
among seven bovine species (see Additional file 4).
Although evidence for purifying selection has been
revealed by Z-tests for both the Zp2 and the Zp3 coding
haplotype sequences, it remains unknown which sites
(or codons) have been under purifying selection. We
used the SLR method to further calculate the d N /d S

Discussion
Our study examined both intra- and inter-specific
genetic variation of two sequence fragments each from
reproductive genes Zp2 and Zp3, in seven representative
species from the Bovini tribe. A general pattern of low
levels of sequence polymorphism and divergence has
been detected for those two sequenced fragments
(Tables 1 and 2). Due to small sample size for some
species studied (e.g., 2 individuals for European bison),
the low level of intraspecific variation could be, at first
sight, attributable to the effect of sample size. In fact,
such a pattern of low polymorphism and divergence was
not really ascribed to the sample size, except for an
extreme case of European bison, but to the sequence
conservation of those two sequenced fragments. Several

observations provided strong support to this scenario.
First, the sample sizes for domestic cattle (44 for
B. taurus, 34 for B. indicus) were not such small, but
the pattern of low levels of intraspecific variation still
remained (Table 1). Second, the codon-based Z-tests
revealed evidence for purifying selection in pairwise
comparisons of the Zp2 and the Zp3 coding haplotype
sequences (see Additional files 3 and 4), suggesting the
evolution of the sequenced fragments of the two genes
under functional and structural constraints. Finally, the
sequenced fragments of the Zp2 (from amino acids 238
to 311) and the Zp3 (from amino acids 164 to 229) are
located at zona pellucida domains, which have been
demonstrated to be well conserved in a wide variety of
mammalian species [51,52].
It is worthy of note that several haplotypes were
shared by multiple bovine species for both genes, for
instance, the haplotype Zp2H2 (or Zp2cdh2) shared by
five species from Bos and Bison (see Figures 1, 2a, and
3a). There were, at least, eight coding SNPs shared by
species from Bos and Bison for the two genes, segregating from the outgroup species, i.e., the domestic goat
and sheep (Figures 2a and 3a). Such a pattern of haplotype sharing can be explained by either introgressive
hybridization or retention of ancestral polymorphism
[53]. The hypothesis of introgressive hybridization is
plausible in that interspecific hybridization among species from Bos or Bison often occurs [32-36]. However, a
recent study attempting to reconstruct phylogeny of the
Bovini tribe revealed that shared haplotypes among
bovine species might be the result of the retention of
ancestral polymorphism [50].
To test whether retention of ancestral polymorphism
contributed to haplotype sharing among species from
Bos and Bison and to identify specific shared polymorphisms, we looked into patterns of mutations at
both sequenced fragments of the Zp2 and the Zp3
genes. A fixed coding mutation (G > A) at position 5463
of the Zp2 was segregated between non-buffalo (Bos and
Bison with ‘A’) species and buffalo (Bubalus and Syncerus with ‘G’) species or the outgroup species (Goat
and sheep with ‘G’) (see Additional file 1); A fixed noncoding mutation (G > A) at position 3270 and a fixed
coding mutation (C > T) at 3418 of the Zp3 were also
completely differentiated between non-buffalo (Bos and
Bison with ‘A’ at 3270 and ‘T’ at 3418) species and buffalo (Bubalus and Syncerus with ‘G’ at 3270 and ‘C’ at
3418) species or the outgroup species (Goat and sheep
with ‘G’ at 3270 and ‘C’ at 3418) (see Additional file 2).
It is clear that those three shared polymorphisms among
Bos and Bison species were derived from their most
recent common ancestor after divergence from buffalo
(Bubalus and Syncerus) species, but were retained during divergence and evolution of Bos and Bison species.

Page 8 of 11

Thus, such shared polymorphisms provide unequivocal
evidence that haplotype sharing among Bos and Bison
species can be, at least, partially attributed to retention
of ancestral polymorphism.
In reality, it is difficult to determine whether these
shared haplotypes are remnants of ancestral polymorphism or traces of recent introgression events [54], but a
recent study suggests that geographic distribution of
shared haplotypes would help to disentangle introgression from ancestral polymorphism [55]. To further
define a specific shared haplotype due to one of two
hypotheses, we mapped all coding haplotypes of both
genes on their geographic distribution (Figures 2b and
3b). For the Zp2, the shared haplotypes Zp2cdh1 (equal
to Zp2H1, Zp2H3 in Figure 1a) and Zp2cdh2 (equal to
Zp2H2, Zp2H6 in Figure 1a) are found in samples of
multiple Bos species across Africa (Morocco and Egypt),
Middle East (Yemen), Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan), South Asia (India and Myanmar), and Northeast Asia (Mongolia and China). For the
Zp3, the shared haplotype Zp3cdh1 (equal to Zp3H1,
Zp3H2, and Zp3H9 in Figure 1b) is also found in samples of multiple Bos species across Africa, Middle East,
Central Asia, South Asia, and Northeast Asia. However,
the shared haplotype Zp3cdh3 (equal to Zp3H4 in
Figure 1b) is only detected in B. indicus from India and
B. frontalis from Myanmar, while the shared haplotype
Zp3cdh4 (equal to Zp3H5, Zp3H8, and Zp3H10 in
Figure 1b) is only present in B. indicus from India and
B. grunniens from China. Given that, interspecific hybridization between Bos species mainly occurs in South
Asia and Central Asia [32-35], and therefore the shared
haplotypes Zp3cdh3 and Zp3cdh4 can be simply
explained by hybridization events. Since there is no
clear evidence for hybridization between Bos species and
European bison (B. bonasus), although well-documented
evidence for hybridization between B. taurus and American bison (B. bison) exists [36], the haplotype Zp2cdh2
shared by Bos and Bison species is most probably due to
retention of ancestral polymorphism, rather than to
introgressive hybridization. When scrutinizing phylogenetic relations among coding haplotypes of both genes
as shown in networks (see Figures 2a and 3a), both the
shared haplotypes Zp2cdh1 and Zp3cdh1 are located at
external nodes of network, compared to the outgroup
species through buffalo (Bubalus and Syncerus) species.
Based on the assumption that on average the external
haplotypes in the haplotype networks should be younger
than those internal ones [54], the haplotypes Zp2cdh1
and Zp3cdh1 shared by multiple Bos species represent
relatively recent derived haplotypes at high-frequency,
being compatible with a scenario of recent hybridization.
Indeed, the recent worldwide spread (less than 10,000
years) of domesticated Bos species (and their haplotypes)

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/24

mediated by humans may have potentiated this scenario.
Taken together, none of the two hypotheses alone can
fully interpret the presence of shared sequences in the
Zp2 and Zp3 genes among Bos and Bison species.
Indeed, these two hypotheses are reciprocally nonexclusive and therefore both hypotheses can account for
our observations of haplotype sharing in the Zp2 and Zp3
genes among Bos and Bison species. Our observations of
haplotype sharing suggest that adaptive alleles can flow
into domestic cattle gene pools from other bovine species
via introgressive hybridization, and highlight South Asia as
the diversity hotspot for bovine species.
A general genetic pattern of rapid evolution driven by
positive nature selection has been revealed for reproductive proteins [15,17,18]. This pattern has also been
detected in the ZP2 and the ZP3 glycoproteins of some
mammalian species [19-22]. In contrast, we found evidence for purifying (or negative) selection in the
sequenced fragments of the Zp2 (from amino acids 238
to 311) and the Zp3 (from amino acids 164 to 229)
genes, rather than positive selection. The molecular signatures of negative selection detected in this study can
be easily explained by functional and structural constraints acting on the two sequenced fragments each of
the two genes, both of which are located at the conserved ZP domains [51,52].
It should be aware that previous evidence of positive
selection in ZP glycoproteins of mammalian species is
not robust and consistent among different studies. For
instance, a reanalysis of Mus Zp3 data from Jansa et al.
[19] showed no evidence for positive selection after
removal of the outgroup sequences [22]. Berlin and
Smith [56] analyzed a Zp3 data set of 15 mammalian
species including those eight species analyzed by Swanson et al. [21] and found no evidence for positive selection in Zp3 gene of those 15 species. In addition,
simulation analysis by Berlin and Smith [56] showed
that the likelihood ratio test (LRT) comparing M7-M8
that was used by Swanson et al. [21] suffers false positives under fairly simple scenarios, suggesting that the
M7-M8 LRT alone does not provide solid evidence for
positive selection. It should also be noticed that the M0M3 LRT used by Swanson et al. [21] is no longer
recommended to test evidence of positive selection [57].
To further test whether evidence of positive selection in
mammalian Zp3 and Zp2 genes is robust and consistent,
we applied the CODEML site models in PAML version
4.4 [57] to two data sets each for mammalian Zp3 (15
species) and Zp2 (10 species) full coding sequences, collected from GenBank database (see Additional file 5).
Both data sets of Zp3 and Zp2 genes include those eight
mammalian species analyzed by Swanson et al. [21].
Most strikingly, we also found no evidence of positive
selection in the Zp3 data of 15 species, by the three

Page 9 of 11

LRTs comparing M1a-M2a, M7-M8, and M8a-M8 models, respectively (see Additional file 6), being in line with
previous results by Berlin and Smith [56]. When considering only those eight species analyzed by Swanson
et al. [21], both the M1a-M2a and M8a-M8 LRTs were
not significant, whereas the M7-M8 LRT was significant
(2ΔlnL(M7-M8) = 7.194, p = 0.027). However, for the
Zp2 data of 10 species, the M7-M8 and M8a-M8 LRTs
were significant (2ΔlnL(M7-M8) = 9.474, p = 0.009;
2ΔlnL(M8a-M8) = 5.030, p = 0.025), but the M1a-M2a
LRT was non-significant (2ΔlnL(M1a-M2a) = 3.432, p =
0.180). Likewise, when focusing on only those eight species analyzed by Swanson et al. [21], three LTRs yielded
similar results as those from the Zp2 data of 10 species
(see Additional file 6). Moreover, we identified one site
(at 174) in the Zp2 data set of 10 species and four sites
(at 38, 117, 174, and 342) in the Zp2 data of eight species under positive selection with posterior probabilities
> 90%. Our analyses on real data sets of both mammalian Zp3 and Zp2 genes are congruent with previous
simulation analyses showing that the M1a-M2a and
M8a-M8 comparisons are more robust than the M7-M8
comparison [56,58]. Taken these observations into
account, we conclude that there is no evidence of positive selection in Zp3 gene of these mammalian species
studied, and that there is some (not strong) evidence of
positive selection in Zp2 gene of these mammalian species studied. It is therefore not strange to find evidence
of purifying selection in the sequenced fragment of Zp3
gene in bovine species.
We also noticed that evidence for positive selection
was detected in Zp3 gene of New Guinean and Australasian murine species, by using three LRTs comparing
M1a-M2a, M7-M8, and M8a-M8 models [20]. In addition, three amino acid sites (at 324, 325, and 341) within
the polypeptide (residues 309-355) encoded by mouse
Zp3 exon-7 were identified to be under positive selection. The polypeptide encoded by mouse Zp3 exon-7
containing sperm combing-site of ZP3 has been demonstrated to be essential for sperm-binding activity by in
vitro functional experiments [8-10]. However, when considering only Australasian murine species, three LRTs
were not significant at all [20]. These results from murine rodents suggest that there is lack of a general pattern of rapid evolution driven by positive selection in
Zp3 gene across mammalian species. Contrary to mammalian ZP3, we found evidence of positive selection in
mammalian ZP2 with several positively selected amino
acid sites (at 38, 117, 174, and 342), indicating that
mammalian ZP2 might have played a more important
role in sperm-egg interaction than previously thought.
Although, some authors still support sperm-binding
model mediated by ZP3 [2,3,59], such model has been
called into questions and is gradually replaced by a

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:24
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/24

three-dimensional ZP structure model [11-13]. The latter model is further supported by a recent study showing that sperm-egg recognition in mouse depends on
the cleavage status of ZP2, but is unaffected by the ZP3
mutations in the sperm combining-site [14].

Conclusions
Previous studies have demonstrated that genes or genomic regions (such as speciation genes) that contribute to
reproductive isolation between species often evolve
rapidly and show little or no gene flow between species
[60,61]. If this postulate is true, then our findings suggest that these two ZP genes may not play an important
role in reproductive isolation between the bovine species
as it was defended in a recent functional study [14].
Nonetheless, future experiments comparing sperm-binding capacity between bovine species pairs with different
degrees of fertility of hybrid offspring are needed. Alternatively, our findings can also be interpreted as the
exception to the fast-evolving patterns that were
revealed from genes related to reproductive isolation in
previous studies. If the latter is true, then our data
would appeal a re-evaluation of the ZP evolutionary
rates in other mammalian lineages.
