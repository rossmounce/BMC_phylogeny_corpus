Genomic scale projects have compounded the need for
rapid and reliable functional annotation methods. Traditional experimental approaches have become outpaced
resulting in an ever-increasing proportion of missing
annotations. Computational approaches, including those
based on sequence, expression, interaction and tertiary
structure, have the potential to impact the growing annotation deficit.
Despite a recent increase in the number and variety of prediction methods, the computational annotation of protein function remains difficult. This stems from a
combination of issues such as the inherent limitations of
current tools and databases, the difficulty of assessing the
predictive power of different methods and more fundamental problems related to the ambiguity of the definition of function itself.

genomics research. The importance of standardized functional dictionaries capable of incorporating a range of
function definitions, such as those implemented by the
popular Gene Ontology (GO) project [1], the Structural
Classification of Proteins (SCOP) [2] and the Enzyme
Classification (EC) system [3,4] was made apparent
throughout the meeting, by their pervasive usage in the
implementation and assessment of protein function prediction methods. Discussions of the need for reliability
indicators and blind validations of the various methods
led to consensus agreement on the value of conducting a
community wide assessment of protein function experiment (a-là CASP [5] for assessment of protein structure
predictions and CAPRI [6] for the assessment of protein
interactions). For this supplement we have chosen nine
studies presented at AFP 2006 to be published as fulllength articles.

These and related themes were addressed at the second
Automated Function Prediction (AFP) conference, which
took place at the University of California, San Diego campus in late August 2006. AFP2006 attracted more than
100 participants and extended over three days with 8 keynote presentations, 19 contributed talks, 20 posters and a
panel discussion. A broad range of function prediction
methods were presented, focusing on the development of
new techniques as well as the thorough utilization of the
spectrum of data being produced by genomics and post-

Most computational methods for functional annotation
rely on the transfer of knowledge accumulated in
sequence and structure databases to related proteins.
These methods can be distinguished by the manner in
which the 'relatedness' of proteins is defined: some
employ sequence similarity and structure similarity measures, others gene order conservation, co-occurrence across
genomes and even shared interaction partners. The first
seven papers in this supplement describe new developments for each of these methods.

Homology-based methods are underpinned by the conservation of functionally important residues, and employ
sequence and/or structure similarity to identify functionally related proteins.
Melvin and colleagues [7] describe SVM-Fold, a new
method for remote homology detection and fold recognition. The method employs a support vector machine algorithm with kernels based on PSI-BLAST [8] profiles, as
described in [9]. A novel multi-class classification algorithm, termed adaptive codes, is employed to exploit the
hierarchical information contained within the SCOP [2]
database. The authors show that, in comparison with PSIBLAST and their previously described algorithm, SVMfold improves remote homology detection and significantly improves fold recognition.
In related work, Audit and colleagues [10] detail the application of their previously described probabilistic framework for homology-based annotations [11] to the
ENZYME database [4]. This framework combines the pairwise similarity scores between query sequence and all
members of a functional class to measure the relationship
between protein and class. It then employs a Bayesian
procedure to compute the likelihood that a new sequence
belongs to that functional class. ENZYME re-annotations
are thus assigned a probability value measuring the reliability of each prediction. Among the different classes,
error rates range from 0 to 13.6%, mostly reflecting the
inability of sequence similarity search procedures to
detect substrate specificity.
Marti-Renom and colleagues [12] introduce two new programs, AnnoLite and AnnoLyze, which add functional
content to the previously established DBAli database of
protein structure alignments [13]. The AnnoLite program
utilizes structural alignments to transfer functional annotations using the recognized vocabularies of SCOP [2],
CATH [14], EC [3,4], GO [1], InterPro [15] and Pfam [16].
The AnnoLyze program utilizes structural alignments to
transfer ligand binding site and domain interaction patch
annotations from LigBase [17] and PIBASE [18], respectively. Importantly, for both tools, the authors define
annotation specific cutoffs of sequence and structure similarity for confident transfer of annotations between proteins.
Henschel and colleagues [19] present a collection of hidden Markov models of protein-binding and ligand-binding interfaces. The models are generated using a multiplemotif approach to represent binding sites as a collection
of small HMMs, each derived from sequence segments
that constitute structural features of the interaction site.
The authors use cross-validation and comparison to literature-curated interactions to show that a significant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S4/S1

number of their protein-protein interaction models can
be used to recognize protein-protein interaction sites. In
addition, they validate the protein-ligand interaction
models through comparison with PROSITE motifs
[20,21] associated with ligand binding sites.
Genome context analysis methods are based on shortrange genome co-linearity and conservation of gene regulation, and use gene order and localization to identify
functionally related proteins. Li and colleagues [22]
describe SynFPS, a new method that uses genomic context
to predict function. SynFPS differentiates itself from other
methods by its ability to detect gene correspondence
among genomes of weakly related organisms, thus eliminating the requirement of prior knowledge of the relationship among them. This is achieved through genome
clustering based on gene distribution, followed by support vector machine training for function prediction. The
system is shown to be particularly effective in the analysis
of bacteriophage genomes, where the phylogenetic relationship among organisms is far from established.
Proteins with similar functions are often observed to cooccur across genomes and thus possess similar phylogenetic profiles. Cokus and colleagues [23] define a new
heuristic for the application of phylogenetic profile analysis that accounts for the relationship among organisms
in a computationally efficient manner. This is achieved
through an all-versus-all comparison of phylogenetic profiles and the subsequent re-ordering of those profiles
according to the established relationships. The authors
show that accounting for the number of runs, or consecutive matches, between ordered profiles improves the identification of functionally related proteins, by
distinguishing conservation within closely related organisms from conservation across more divergent species.
Protein-protein interaction based methods rely on the
emerging protein-protein interaction datasets and exploit
interaction partners to identify functionally related proteins. Chua and colleagues [24] employ the previously
described FS-Weighted Averaging method [25], which
makes functional inferences based on indirect interaction
partners and topological weighting, to annotate seven
genomes from a diverse range of organisms with GO
terms [1] from all three ontologies. Despite the different
numbers and types of protein-protein interaction datasets
available for each of the genomes, the annotations are
shown to be robust against noisy data and complementary to homology based methods.
The remaining two papers chosen for this supplement do
not rely on annotation transfer from related proteins, but
instead tackle the difficult question of de novo identification of ligand binding sites in protein structures. This

form of annotation has assumed greater emphasis as the
majority of structures solved by structural genomics
projects are of unknown function and bear no sequence or
structure based similarity to any proteins that have a
known function.
Xie and Bourne [26] describe a new algorithm for the prediction of ligand-binding sites based on a simplified
shape description of protein structure. The method partitions protein space with two boundaries: an environment
boundary, containing both protein and potential ligand
binding pockets, and a protein boundary. Clusters of
atoms at the intersection of these boundaries are identified as potential binding sites and their distance and orientation in relation to the environment boundary are
used to compute a novel measure, termed geometric
potential. The authors show that the geometric potential
can be used to distinguish ligand binding from non-ligand binding sites, is minimally affected by conformational changes and is sufficiently fast to be applied in
large-scale calculations.
In related work, Yoon and colleagues [27] report the
extension of the FEATURE method [28-32] to enable the
discovery of unknown functional sites in protein structures. FEATURE vectors describe microenvironments
around active sites and binding sites of proteins as normalized counts of physical and chemical properties
within sets of concentric shells. The authors show that kmeans clustering of these environments, using a weighted
version of the Hamming distance between vectors, enables the discovery of microenvironment clusters highly
enriched with known functional sites. Analysis of such
sites will allow the calibration of size and inter-cluster distances, thus enabling the discovery of novel functional
sites.
In the introduction to his keynote presentation, Christos
Ouzounis (CERTH) commented: "I have been trying to
escape this field because it is so hard... but it keeps haunting us, and [thus we] keep revisiting the problems [it
presents]". Function prediction is indeed a challenging
endeavor that is further hampered by the lack of a standard assessment framework [5,33]. It was inspiring to see
that a vibrant community of researchers from varied backgrounds, reflected in the variety and scope of papers showcased in this supplement, is focusing on this important
problem. We hope to see this trend continue for the third
annual AFP meeting, which will be held in Vienna Austria,
July 19 to 20 of 2007.
