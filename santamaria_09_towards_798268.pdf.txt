Abstract
Background: A standardized and cost-effective molecular identification system is now an urgent
need for Fungi owing to their wide involvement in human life quality. In particular the potential use
of mitochondrial DNA species markers has been taken in account. Unfortunately, a serious
difficulty in the PCR and bioinformatic surveys is due to the presence of mobile introns in almost
all the fungal mitochondrial genes. The aim of this work is to verify the incidence of this
phenomenon in Ascomycota, testing, at the same time, a new bioinformatic tool for extracting and
managing sequence databases annotations, in order to identify the mitochondrial gene regions
where introns are missing so as to propose them as species markers.
Methods: The general trend towards a large occurrence of introns in the mitochondrial genome
of Fungi has been confirmed in Ascomycota by an extensive bioinformatic analysis, performed on
all the entries concerning 11 mitochondrial protein coding genes and 2 mitochondrial rRNA
(ribosomal RNA) specifying genes, belonging to this phylum, available in public nucleotide sequence
databases. A new query approach has been developed to retrieve effectively introns information
included in these entries.
Results: After comparing the new query-based approach with a blast-based procedure, with the
aim of designing a faithful Ascomycota mitochondrial intron map, the first method appeared clearly
the most accurate. Within this map, despite the large pervasiveness of introns, it is possible to
distinguish specific regions comprised in several genes, including the full NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 6 (ND6) gene, which could be considered as barcode candidates for Ascomycota due to

their paucity of introns and to their length, above 400 bp, comparable to the lower end size of the
length range of barcodes successfully used in animals.
Conclusion: The development of the new query system described here would answer the
pressing requirement to improve drastically the bioinformatics support to the DNA Barcode
Initiative. The large scale investigation of Ascomycota mitochondrial introns performed through
this tool, allowing to exclude the introns-rich sequences from the barcode candidates exploration,
could be the first step towards a mitochondrial barcoding strategy for these organisms, similar to
the standard approach employed in metazoans.

Background
Among the living organisms with the largest effect on
human society health and development, Fungi are very
widespread. Indeed, man has learned to employ them to
produce and transform food, agricultural and industrial
resources, drugs and cosmetics or, in certain cases, to fear
them as toxic contaminants. In particular, despite the
huge progress in feed technology, the contamination of
food due to some species, frequently belonging to Fungi,
present in natural environment or accidentally introduced
during incorrect fabrication or storage procedures, is however possible. In this scenario, the achievement of an
effective, rapid and cheap monitoring system of contaminant species to preserve the food quality and foresee possible risks is strongly required. A deeper knowledge of the
classification of fungal species and the possibility to discriminate them in an efficient way could strongly support
this urgent task. At the same time this is a very challenging
mission: Fungi include a broad range of taxa presenting a
great variety of morphologies, ecologies and life strategies
[1]. Indeed, of the 1.5 millions species belonging to the
Fungi kingdom assumed by Hawksworth (1991) [2],
fewer than 10% have been formally described. Although
Ascomycota harbour a large range of morphologies it is
quite difficult to determine distinct and unambiguous
species boundaries on the basis of these differences. The
difficulty of a morphology-based determination and the
wide involvement in human health and life quality of
these organisms strongly emphasize the necessity to integrate the classical species identification methods with a
taxonomic discrimination system based on DNA [3], a
method so rapid and practical to be used easily by both
researchers involved in "Fungi species definition challenge" and by non-experts for practical uses. Indeed it is
possible to imagine how much this new approach could
improve many practical applications, such as the diagnosis of pathogens and invasive species in agriculture or of
new species associated to pathological conditions, the
identification of dangerous contaminants in food and the
revealing of commercial frauds and illegal activities.
At present the possibility to apply DNA barcoding to the
identification of fungal species has recently been suggested [3-5]. Moreover new barcode data could provide a

definite contribution to fungal phylogeny knowledge
even if this kind of research would require integration of
additional sequence information [4] (see AFTOL – Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life – initiative for a promising
start: http://aftol.org/).
Obviously the idea of using a DNA marker to classify taxonomical relationships is not that recent, especially
within the Fungi, but, until now, scarce attention has been
paid to standardization of the marker to be used. On the
contrary, the use of a standard marker is, perhaps, the
main innovation of the ambitious DNA Barcode Initiative
[6-8], whose aim is to unequivocally identify a species in
a particular domain of life, on the basis of a short DNA
fragment taken from a standardized portion of the
genome [9]. This protocol, potentially very effective and
high-throughput in the assignment of unknown specimens to known species, could be applied to all kingdoms
of life, being based on DNA, whose language and techniques are universally shared [3]. In general the high
degree of standardization promoted by the DNA barcoding approach extends to its entire methodology: the same
PCR amplification primers for a defined set of molecular
markers would be adopted, the same protocol for
sequence data analysis would be used and a common
database inclusive of all species barcoded and the same
annotations format could be created, allowing also nonspecialists to identify species in a fast and cheap way.
Currently, the molecular identification of species in Fungi
is based primarily on nuclear DNA markers, such as
"nuclear large ribosomal subunit" (LSU rDNA) [10],
"nuclear small ribosomal subunit" (SSU rDNA) [11],
"internal transcribed spacer (ITS)" [12], "β-tubulin
(BenA)" [13], "elongation factor 1-α (EF-1-α)" [14] and
"second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2)"
[15], but the potential use of mitochondrial markers has
also been considered due to their favorable features,
among which, above all, their high copy number, the possibility of an easier and cheaper recovering of their
sequences and the paucity of repetitive regions which
could produce misleading results owing to the comparison of non-orthologous sequences pairs. Moreover, the
results presented by Seifert et al. (2007) [3], would

strongly suggest that a mitochondrial gene could really be
a good species molecular marker for Fungi, thanks to its
appropriate intra and inter-species variability features.
Unfortunately, a serious difficulty in the PCR and bioinformatic surveys is due to the presence of mobile introns
in almost all the fungal mitochondrial genes [16]. The aim
of this work is to verify the incidence of intron occurrence
in Ascomycota, a phylum with a large economic impact
both as pests and as beneficial organisms, and to identify
one or more mitochondrial gene regions where introns
are missing so as to propose them as barcode candidates.
In this work we demonstrate that a very effective way to
build a map of Ascomycota mitochondrial introns is to
extract the information about their positions directly from
the annotations of a huge and rich database of nucleic
acids, such as Genbank. Reaching this goal is not an ordinary issue since the conventional retrieval system typically
used often does not allow fetching specific information
included in certain fields of a classical database entry. The
design and development of a new query system implemented within a database federation system has allowed
overcome the limitation of standard retrieval system. The
accuracy of this new tool has been evaluated comparing
the results deriving from its use with those obtained from
a more classical approach of database similarity searching.

Methods
The distribution and size of introns in 11 of the 13 protein
coding genes and 2 rRNA specfying genes, belonging to
Ascomycota mitochondrial DNA, available in public databases, has been assessed using two bioinformatic methodologies: a Blast-based approach and a Query-based
approach. ATP synthase F0 subunit 8 (ATP8) and NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 4L (NDH4L) genes were discarded from the analysis because we considered them too
small compared to the standard size of barcode markers.
Indeed in literature the barcodes have generally a size
larger than 400 bp whereas the coding region maximum
size is 340 bp and 150 bp for NDH4L gene and ATP8
gene, respectively. Designing conserved primers for such
small regions would probably produce small amplified
regions sizes (probably less than 250 bp for NDH4L gene
and less than 50 bp for ATP8 gene) which, even considering some exceptions [26], could have a decreased taxonomic discrimination power. However further analysis is
needed to confirm that this assumption is correct for the
two genes mentioned above.
Blast-based approach
The information retrieval system SRS [17], available at the
EBI website, has been used for a rigorous extraction of all
the mitochondrial Ascomycota sequences from the EMBL
database [18] obtained by placing in the searching field
"Organelle" the word 'mitochondrion' and in the searching field "Taxon" the word 'Ascomycota'. Then, a Blast

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S15

similarity searching tool [19] has been applied to the
extracted sequences to select orthologous mitochondrial
genes, using as probes the sequences of each protein or
rRNA coded by the mitochondrial genome of four species
scattered across the phylogenetic tree of Fungi: Aspergillus
niger, Ustilago maydis, Neurospora crassa, and Rhizopus
oryzae. In the case of the protein coding genes, the probes
used were the amino acidic sequences and the blast procedure was performed using the tblastn algorithm. In the
case of the rRNA genes, the probes were nucleotide
sequences and the blast protocol used was blastn.
For each gene, the Blast results obtained using the gene
probes belonging to all the four species were compared
and, in all the cases, it was possible to verify that the
results set of at least one search were inclusive of all the
sequences found in the others. Thus it was not necessary
to integrate the result sets but, simply, to select the most
complete one for each gene (see additional file 1 for the
final non-redundant list of the EMBL accession numbers
of the 4385 sequences obtained with the described procedure and used to perform the following analysis). The
local alignment obtained by Blast was used to infer the relative position of the intron sequences for each gene. This
approach was based on the assumption that all the nucleotides in the subject sequences lying between two different HSP (High-scoring Segment Pair) need to be
considered as introns. In order to control possible errors
caused by an excess of divergence among the exon
sequences, a python script, designed to score the blast output, performed several control steps before showing the
putative presence of an intron. At first, the script would
check if the group of HSPs found in a subject sequences,
using a given query sequence, were co-linear between
query and subject and that they all laid on the same strand
on the subject. Furthermore, the script checked if the
space between HSPs was present only on the subject
sequence, indicating a possible intron, or an equivalent
space was found on the query, indicating a stretch of variable sequence. It is known that both blastn and tblastn
need a minimum length of similar sequences to detect an
HSP (High-scoring Segment Pair), and consequentially
small exons may not be detected, but this limitation does
not have any influence on the localization of large coding
areas free of introns as the ones sought in this work.
Query-based approach
The task of retrieving an exhaustive set of pieces of information concerning introns of mitochondrial genes in
Ascomycota by means of classical query systems leads to
non-trivial issues due to both some limitations of these
tools and to a quite large and unquantifiable degrees of
freedom in annotating records of the primary databases
[20]. Especially the latter reason makes difficult to accomplish the research goal exposed in this paper through clas-

sical retrieval tools, where functionalities such as term
normalization by means of specialized dictionaries, analysis of unstructured information, conditional retrieval
and analysis are not available [21,18].
In order to carry out our analysis a hybrid solution has
been put in place, in which we coupled the powerful
query and retrieval abilities of a relational database with a
custom analysis algorithm appositely developed. In this
case the relational database used is the LIBI (International
Laboratory of Bioinformatics) federated database (LIBI
DB) [22]. Although this database has been conceived and
set up to solve, within the LIBI platform, the important
issue of integrating dislocated and heterogeneous data
sources [23], in this work it has been just used as a relational interface to send queries against the primary database GenBank. The LIBI DB has been implemented over
the IBM DB2 DBMS (Database Management System) and
the IBM WebSphere Federation Server products that allow
to access and integrate diverse data and content sources as
if they were a single resource, regardless of where the
information resides [24].
In our implementation, GenBank federation is achieved
through a web-services wrapper interfacing the web-services exposed at NCBI [23]. Fig. 1 shows the relational representation of the GenBank information as extracted from
the overall schema of the LIBI federated database. Deducing correspondences between the fields of the relational

structure in Figure 1 and those of a GenBank record [25]
is straightforward. In the same figure the GenBank fields
containing information useful for our analyses are starmarked. These pieces of information are extracted by
means of the SQL (Structured Query Language) Query A
shown in Figure 2. This query involves 3 tables from
which values for 7 fields are extracted; the WHERE clause
is essentially built upon the criteria of extracting records
related to "Ascomycota" as Organism, with gene belonging
to the mitochondrial genome, that contain one term as
{"CDS" -coding sequence-, "tRNA" -transfer RNA-,
"rRNA"} in the field feature key, and one of {"gene",
"product", "note", "translation"} in the field qualifier
name.
Due to both the database "noise" reported before (lack of
normalization, poor standardization in feature descriptions, etc.), and complex evaluations to be performed to
extract pieces of information relevant for our analysis, a
custom algorithm has been designed and implemented in
order to evaluate automatically retrieved data. The main
steps of the algorithm are depicted in Figure 3 and
described in detail below.
The algorithm starts sending Query A against the federated
database. The retrieved result set is managed by the algo-

sequences corresponding only to the coding part of each
gene.

step (1'a): this ensures that it is related to a target gene.
Step (1'a) evaluates the qualifier value field in order to
identify the gene name. This piece of information is
extracted from the field qualifier value corresponding to a
qualifier name with value "gene" (or "product", if "gene" is
missing). In order to avoid gene name synonymy, a suitable dictionary has been used to normalize the gene name
the tuple corresponds to (e.g. gene names "coxII" or
"cox2", have been normalized to "co2"). Step (1'b) gives
also the possibility to extract the protein sequence from
the qualifier value field (when available) if requested by
the analysis.

rithm in order to obtain refined data organized in a tabular way; this is a suitable format for the statistical analyses
conducted later. To each tuple of the result set obtained by
Query A the four steps (see Figure 3) specified by the algorithm are applied. A tuple is an annotation item retrieved
by the SQL query. In this specific case it represents an
annotated ORF.
Step (1) analyzes the qualifier name and the qualifier value
fields in order to verify if the tuple refers to a significant
Open Reading Frame (ORF). This check is performed evaluating if the qualifier value field contains a pattern
included in a predefined list of intron gene qualifier (e.g.
"intronic ORF", "ORF in an intron", "unnamed protein
product", etc.). If the tuple matches a pattern, it is discarded (step 1'A); otherwise the tuple will be handled by

The whole step (2) is devoted to analyze the feature location field. Step (2') infers the correct strand on which the
feature lays by checking on the feature location for the word
"complement". Then, step (2") infers the gene completeness by checking on the presence of special characters
(such as "<" or ">", meaning that the start/end sequence
position is not defined) in the feature location field. Step
(2"') evaluates the presence of introns inside the gene and
extracts information about them by searching for the
word "join" in the feature location. If this word is not
present, we mark the gene as lacking introns and the algorithm proceeds with the step (2"'A) in order to calculate
the start and end position of the gene; if the word "join"
is present, the gene contains introns, so the following
three steps are performed: step (2"'a) extracts from the feature location field the start and end positions for each
intron; finally, the start position of the first exon [step
(2"'b)] and the end position of the last exon [step (2"'c)]
are extracted.
Step (3) is responsible for the analysis of the feature key
field in order to extract the DNA sequence of the genes
specifying rRNA or encoding proteins. So the feature key
field is checked for the words "rRNA" or "CDS"; if the gene
refers to rRNA or CDS a new query, named Query B in Figure 2, against the federated database is performed [step
(3')] to extract the DNA sequence of the gene without
introns. Query B is compiled using the SQL user-defined
function COMPL_REVERSE we appositely built to complement
and

the
DNA
sequence
<sequence_without_introns> depending on the
annotated strand. In Query B the DNA sequence
<sequence_without_introns> is reconstructed by
means of some of the pieces of information we gathered
in the previous steps, while the value of <accession> is
that related to the tuple under evaluation.
Finally, step (4) summarizes all extracted information in
a file where the data are formatted as comma separated
values (CSV).

The performance of such an approach to query GenBank
in order to extract relevant information for the analysis of
introns in mitochondrial genes in Ascomycota can be
effectively evaluated by taking into account some of the
quantities reported in Table 1. This table confirms the fact
that a custom algorithm, simply constructed over the data
extracted by SQL queries sent against the federated database, is suitable to automate the processes of data extraction, normalization and evaluation. Table 1 shows that
starting from a large number of tuples such that extracted
from the Query A (12499) the number of tuples, such as
genes, relevant for our study is 11037. The algorithm had
been able to extract automatically and correctly all the
information contained in the entries' features for about
the whole set of the tuples except for 17 of them, for
which human examination was requested. However these
numbers allow us to state the algorithm accuracy to
99.8%. The 17 records were found in a cross control procedure between assignment proposed by gene name and
that suggested by gene description.
Finally of the 7234 Genbank entries obtained using the
described procedure, 5802 have been selected since they
concerned the 13 target genes (11 of the 13 protein coding
genes and 2 rRNA coding genes), belonging to Ascomycota mitochondrial DNA, used in this work. See additional file 2 for the final list of the Genbank accession
numbers associated to these 5802 entries.
The developed query system at present is not publicly
available, however we are evaluating a solution to make it
available as a service that researchers could use through
the internet.

Results
Introns position and size by Blast-based approach
The results of the Blast-based approach, shown in Figure
4, reveal the pervasiveness of introns across almost all the
Ascomycota mitochondrial genes included in the analysis,
namely cytochrome oxidase subunit I (CO1), cytochrome
oxidase subunit II (CO2), cytochrome oxidase subunit III
(CO3), cytochrome b (CYTB), ATP synthase F0 subunit 6
(ATP6), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), NADH

dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2), NADH dehydrogenase
subunit 4 (ND4), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5
(ND5), large subunit ribosomal RNA (lRNA) and small
subunit ribosomal RNA (sRNA), even if the distribution
density and the size of these non-coding regions can vary
remarkably between them. Particularly CO1, CYTB and
the two ribosomal genes show the maximum density of
introns. According to these results, the CO1 gene, designated as the core barcode region for animals, has to be
reconsidered in Fungi, due to the potential complication
in PCR-based surveys related to the massive presence of
introns, as observed by Seifert et al. in 2007 [3]. On the
other hand, at least three other protein coding genes, or
part of them, could be reasonably considered barcode
candidates because of their scarcity of introns, namely
ND3, ND4 and ND6. The ND3 gene, with a length of
approximately 400 bp, seems to be too short to be considered as a barcode marker however, several recent studies
demonstrated that reducing species marker length has a
profound effect on the accuracy of the resulting phylogenetic trees, but surprisingly the species discrimination is
still effective [4,26].
Looking at the distribution of intron sizes (The results of
our analysis are shown in Figure 5), the values range
between 500 and 3000 bp, with few exceptions, the
median value is 1269 and the estimated mode is
1240.457. An intrinsic problem of the Blast-based
approach, which is based on the recognition of sequence
similarity (the similarity score between the probe and
each sequence in the database depends on the fraction of
identical residues and on the lengths of the matching
regions), is that small exons could not be identified and
several introns could be joined together producing erroneous results, as shown in Figure 5 where unrealistic
introns about even over 25000 bp emerge. For this reason,
a query-based approach seemed to be immediately desirable in order to calculate the intron positions and sizes
directly from database annotations.
A summary of number of records and different species
retrieved for each gene is displayed in Figure 6.

Ascomycota mitochondrial gene, revealed by the Blast-based approach, are blotted. The coloured dots show the insertion
positions and size (hue of colour) of putative introns. The height of the profile indicates the number of EMBL records that
matched with each site of the probe. The introns positions are relative to the sequence of one of the four reference species
probes used. In particular the species for which the results set included all the sequences found with all the other three probes

Introns position and size by Query-based approach
The Query-based approach generally confirmed the
results obtained with the Blast-based one, but it seems

more accurate in recognizing also small exons (almost the
totality of intron sizes are lower than 3500 bp). Indeed, as
shown in Figure 7, the intron sizes are still included in a

range between 500 and 3000 bp, with few exceptions. The
majority of them are found in a range between 1000 and
2000 bp and the unrealistic intron sizes revealed by the
Blast approach are not found any longer. Figure 8 displays
that CO1 and CYTB genes show again a high density of
introns. As for the rRNA genes, the situation is not clear:
the large amount of introns highlighted through the Blast
method disappeared almost completely as a result of the
Query-based method. Therefore, further investigation of
the ribosomal RNA genes is required. The ND3 gene does
not appear to be completely intron-free as found with the
Blast-based approach. Finally, even if several Ascomycota
mitochondrial genes show a low incidence of introns,
such as ND3, ND4 and the terminal 3' of ND5, ND6
appears to be completely intron-free and thus it constitutes the best potential barcode candidate. A summary of
a number of records and different species retrieved for
each gene is displayed in Figure 9, respectively. See additional file 3 for the original data about the presence and
the position of introns in the totality of mitochondrial
Ascomycota records present in Genbank used to obtain
the graphs reported in Fig. 8.

Intron size distribution as estimated by the Blastbased protocol. The distribution of size in each gene (genes
acronyms are marked on the left size of the graph) is shown
with a so-called "barcode graph", in which each small vertical
bar represent the size value of a given intron and each dot on
the top of the vertical bar represent further introns which
have the same size. From the distribution of intron sizes one
record (AY955840 and its equivalent from full genome collection NC_007935) was removed because its size value was
too large (>50000 bp) to be easily drawn on the graph.

crimination of Ascomycota species. At the same time, an
accurate methodological test, in which two alternative
bioinformatics approaches to reveal intron size and position has been performed. The Query-based approach,
developed as part of a database federation system, including public (such as Genbank) and private resources, has
allowed to characterize precisely the intron position and
size, performing a data retrieval directed only to obtain
specific information usually present in the entries of a biological database, but hardly selectable through the classical query systems. Indeed, the commonly used databases
query systems such as SRS (http://srs.ebi.ac.uk) or Entrez
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery, although giving the possibility to carry out complex research in which
several criteria are combined and the false positives minimized, appear rather ineffective when it is necessary to
retrieve selected information contained in particular fields
of the entries. This problem is particularly evident when
we wish to extract the data included in the so-called Feature Tables which, in a typical entry of a nucleic acids database, contain a detailed description of the various
functional and structural portions of the sequence. The
new query system, implemented in the LIBI platform, has
been very useful for a rigorous extraction of only introns
start and end positions data, present in the lines of the
Feature Tables and it has allowed focusing of the query
only on the mitochondrial entries of the Ascomycota
annotated in Genbank.

Discussion
The study described here has allowed an evaluation of the
impact of the mitochondrial introns in the development
of a mitochondrial barcode system for the molecular dis-

The Blast approach provided only an approximation of
the intron position localization but it has the advantage to
be independent from the database entry annotations

which could be incorrect or absent. Then, even if the query
approach seems most accurate in determining the exact
start and end intron positions, we should also consider
the results obtained using the Blast approach.
The results obtained from both the Blast and Query methodologies confirm the high frequency of mobile introns
[16] in almost all the mitochondrial genes of Ascomycota
indicating that only few genes, primarily the ND6 gene,
seem not plagued by the presence of introns and could be
reliably amplified to be successfully used as barcode species markers in this phylum. On the basis of this pure bioinformatic analysis, beside the ND6 gene, the ND3 gene
and the terminal 3' of the ND4 and ND5 genes, appear to
be good barcode candidates due to the scarcity of introns
in a considerable part of their sequence. Nevertheless further tests are indispensable to evaluate the possibility to
design pairs of conserved primers, working in a wide taxonomic range, that would produce an amplified fragment
which still harbours enough species discrimination
power.
According to the results obtained performing the query
approach, also the two rRNA genes contain some large
regions (until 2400 bp long in lRNA and 500 bp long in
sRNA) free from introns which could be considered good
barcode candidates but, in this case, the results of Blast
approach strongly contradict this observation requiring
further investigations to understand if the intrinsic frame

shift mistakes in the rRNA nucleotide alignment performed by Blast lead to false interruptions of the CDS, as
strongly suggested by the dimensions of the majority of
introns (<100 bp).
The comparison of the two approaches used in the analysis presented above show a higher efficiency of the Querybased system, giving that it aims directly to the information annotated in the database and avoids a series of
alignment and retrieval stages based on the similarity calculation which inevitably produce false positives and negatives in the final results. In conclusion we were not able
to claim that the Blast approach can be a watchdog of the
query approach, as illustrated by the case of the huge
number of introns found in the large and small ribosomal
RNA genes and the problem of excessive intron length in
the protein coding genes shown in Fig. 5 but expect that
in some occasions Blast could point out some annotation
errors.
The idea of using a mitochondrial gene as a barcode
marker in Fungi, just as it adopted in animals, derives
from several simple considerations. First of all, the general
favorable features of mitochondrial DNA, suitable for the
role of a taxonomic marker, have to be considered.
Among them, above all, there are the high copy number,
the possibility of an easier and cheaper recovering and the
paucity of repetitive DNA which makes the assessment of
the homology, both at the level of loci and at the level of
a single site, quite simple. Indeed comparative studies on
mitochondrial coding genes are not plagued by doubts on
the orthology of a particular locus compared between different samples as it could occur for nuclear genes,
although the accidental amplification of nuclear mitochondrial (NUMTs) pseudogenes could lead to problems
[27-29]. In addition the good results obtained in the animal kingdom, where a region of the CO1 mitochondrial
gene of about 650-bp provides a high resolution to discriminate species in almost 95% of taxa belonging to various animal lineages [30-32], encourage to extend the test
of the same marker also to the other kingdoms, including
Fungi. This aspect becomes extremely noteworthy if we
consider the barcode Initiative efforts towards a high level
of protocols standardization [33]: to use a universal barcode gene to identify species in all kingdoms would be
ideal for DNA barcoding, producing many benefits thanks
to the subsequent improvement of rapid, simple and inexpensive applications for both researchers involved in basic
biodiversity studies and non-expert interested in several
practical issues. Two important questions about the evolutionary dynamics of the mitochondrial genes immediately arise. The first one concerns the commonly accepted
idea that a good barcode should exhibit sufficient variability to allow discrimination between species and low
variability within individuals belonging to the same spe-

cies [34]: could a single gene sequence, selected as a barcode marker, have the appropriate molecular evolution
dynamics along the evolutionary lineages of an entire
kingdom? The second question is: can the variability features of a certain marker be comparable among distant
taxa, such as those belonging to separate kingdoms, or different dynamics have to be considered when the genetic
distances are calculated and compared? These could seem
commonplace questions, but they acquire an urgent and
crucial sense in the scenario of a fast developing initiative,
such as the DNA barcode, whose ambition is a very large
scale discrimination of world biodiversity at the species
level. Indeed, we don't know yet if evolutionary dynamics

of mitochondria are radically different between Fungi and
metazoa and we don't know if the profound difference
between these organisms in life style and reproduction
mode could be reflected in their evolutionary dynamics
and, if so, in which way [35]. In the case of metazoans, the
good species discrimination capacity of mitochondrial
CO1 gene could be foreseen on the basis of some theoretical considerations and previous experimental analysis
[36-38], but it is difficult to use the same theoretical argumentations in Fungi above all given the latter very different reproduction system. Some recent data suggest that,
despite these differences between animals and Fungi, the
patterns of barcode variation are quite comparable

between the two groups. In particular the 5' end of the
CO1 gene provided an excellent resolution at the species
level also in Fungi [3,4]. Two important problems disturb
the use of CO1 or other mitochondrial sequences as barcodes in this group of organisms. First, there are only five
protein-coding genes (CO1, CO2, CO3, CYTB and ATP6)
common in all fungal mitochondrial genomes available
[4]. Obviously this statement reduces consistently the candidates list to be investigated for the role of "universal barcode" suitable for all Fungi taxa and, in particular, it
excludes just the genes which, according to our analysis in
Ascomycota, are less pervaded by introns. The presence of
mobile introns itself represents the other serious difficulty
concerning the use of a mitochondrial gene as barcode
unless an alternative laboratory methodology is taken in
account, such as the amplification of mRNA using RT-PCR
[39] or the use of COI sequences in particular members of
some taxa, such as the Penicillium subgenus Penicillium,
which has an unusual scarcity of introns, indicating that a
small fraction of CO1 sequences could be stripped of
introns for part of their life cycle [3]. Unfortunately this
would result in both a decrease of easiness and quickness
of the protocol and a strong limitation of the field of
action of barcode from the point of view of taxonomic
range and life-stage which could be analysed. Our analysis
suggests that the intron problem in the CO1 gene should
not be underestimated and many tests have to be performed in different genera of Fungi to obtain more general rules and common solutions.
In conclusion, it seems difficult to identify a "universal
barcode" able to resolve species in all Life, even if encouraging results come from the numerous studies in animals,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S15

where the CO1 gene seems successful in many taxonomic
groups [34,40]. In Fungi the effectiveness of an approach
including a single species-level molecular marker has to
be verified yet. This concerns both mitochondrial and
nuclear candidates, indeed several studies have demonstrated that each candidate could work correctly in definite species ranges, while being quite ineffective in other
ones [41,42,3]. Our preliminary studies concerning the
power of mitochondrial ND6 gene to discriminate species
in Fusarium, a genus belonging to Ascomycota phylum,
confirm this trend (data not shown) and suggest that
designing a multi-locus approach where mitochondrial
and nuclear markers were integrated could really help to
reach a profound discrimination of the terminal nodes of
fungal phylogeny.

Conclusion
The Barcode of Life Initiative represents an innovative
resource for the world biodiversity knowledge at the level
of its basic units: the species. This original and emergent
system is opening the way to new and inspiring applications both in basic research and practical issues due basically to its high degree of standardization. The huge
amount of data which have to be produced and analysed
along this massive project unquestionably requires a
strong bioinformatics support and the improvement of
experimental and practical methodologies working effectively on a large scale. A contribution in this sense could
be given by the development of a new query system able
to extract and manage specific information, hardly selectable with the classical retrieval systems, from Genebank. In
particular, this system has been applied to generate a very
accurate and detailed map of Ascomycota mitochondrial
genome introns in order to recognize one or more
regions, free or poor of introns, which could be easily used
as barcode markers in this phylum. Indeed, the non-coding sequences interrupting quite all the Fungi mitochondrial genes could represent one of the most serious
difficulties in amplifying and analysing a taxonomic
molecular marker. The encouraging results obtained testing this new bioinformatic query tool suggest that it could
represent a preliminary step towards a mitochondrial barcoding strategy for Fungi, similar to the standard
approach routinely employed in metazoa, allowing to
choose as barcode candidates those mitochondrial
genome regions not perturbed by the "intron problem".
