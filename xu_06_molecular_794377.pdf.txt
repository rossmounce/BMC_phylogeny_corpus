Abstract
Background: Pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), a member of the serpin family, regulates
cell proliferation, promotes survival of neurons, and blocks growth of new blood vessels in
mammals. Defining the molecular phylogeny of PEDF by bioinformatic analysis is one approach to
understanding the link between its gene structure and its function in these biological processes.
Results: From a comprehensive search of available DNA databases we identified a single PEDF
gene in all vertebrate species examined. These included four mammalian and six non-mammalian
vertebrate species in which PEDF had not previously been described. A five gene cluster around
PEDF was found in an approximate 100 kb region in mammals, birds, and amphibians. In ray-finned
fish these genes are scattered over three chromosomes although only one PEDF gene was
consistently found. The PEDF gene is absent in invertebrates including Drosophila melanogaster (D.
melanogaster), Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), and sea squirt (C. intestinalis). The PEDF gene is
transcribed in all vertebrate phyla, suggesting it is biologically active throughout vertebrate
evolution. The multiple actions of PEDF are likely conserved in evolution since it has the same gene
structure across phyla, although the size of the gene ranges from 48.3 kb in X. tropicalis to 2.9 kb
in fugu, with human PEDF at a size of 15.6 kb. A strong similarity in the proximal 200 bp of the
PEDF promoter in mammals suggests the existence of a possible regulatory region across phyla.
Using a non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio we show that mammalian and fish
PEDFs have similar ratios of <0.13, reflecting a strong purifying selection of PEDF gene. A large
number of repetitive transposable elements of the SINE and LINE class were found with random
distribution in both the promoter and introns of mammalian PEDF.
Conclusion: The PEDF gene first appears in vertebrates and our studies suggest that the
regulation and biological actions of this gene are preserved across vertebrates. This comprehensive
analysis of the PEDF gene across phyla provides new information that will aid further
characterization of common functional motifs of this serpin in biological processes.

Background
The large supergene family of serpins encodes two groups
of proteins. One group comprises the predominant family
of protease inhibitors in mammals and regulates cascades
such as inflammation, blood coagulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The second group represents a substantial number of serpins that, though structurally
similar, are not thought to be inhibitors of specific proteases but have important functions in a wide range of cellular processes.
Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF) is a member
of the second group of serpins. It is not known to target
any specific protease but is associated with two important
cellular processes: proliferation and survival. By shifting
the balance between proliferation and differentiation,
PEDF slows the expansion of tumor cells [1-3]. In cultured
fibroblasts PEDF promotes exit from the cell cycle and
movement into a GO phase [4]. PEDF also inhibits the
growth of endothelial cells that form new blood vessels in
cancers and in some neovascular diseases, particularly in
the eye [1-3,5-7]. More recently PEDF has been shown to
promote self-renewal of adult stem cells [8].
In addition to its effects on proliferation, PEDF increases
survival of neurons. It interferes with progression of neurodegenerative cascades promoted by axotomy, glutamate
excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress in many types of neurons (reviewed in [9]). Similarly, this serpin protects vertebrate photoreceptor cells from damage induced by
removal of trophic support [10,11] or exposure to chronic
bright light [12].
The multiple biological roles of this serpin have been confirmed in PEDF null mice that show epithelial hyperplasia, increased endothelial cell proliferation, and increased
microvessel density in several organs [13]. We have previously identified potentially important functional
domains in the PEDF molecule, several of which have
been tested in both in vitro and in vivo experimental
models [14-16].
PEDF is a 50 kDa secreted protein and is widely distributed in human tissues [17-19]. Characterization of the
human gene for PEDF [19,20] paved the way for the derivation of its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.85Å [21].
Serpins have been organized into 16 clades based on the
sequence similarities of the proteins and exon-intron
organization of the genes [22,23]. PEDF falls into the serpin Fl clade based on the few mammalian sequences
available. In this study, we have used computational tools
to identify PEDF, and other serpin, genes in a variety of
additional species. Comparison of the structure of the
PEDF gene, and the surrounding genes, in various species

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/248

has extended our early work on the evolutionary conservation and genomic structure of PEDF [19]. Using computational tools we have identified PEDF genes in 10
additional species and 20 additional serpin genes. We
have confirmed that many of these additional PEDF
sequences are expressed by RT-PCR. These new sequences
have allowed the refinement of the serpin phylogenetic
tree and show the relatedness of PEDF to other serpins.

Results
PEDF coding sequences is present only in the vertebrates
PEDF sequences have previously been described from
human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), cow (Bos
taurus), and rat (Rattus norvegicus). We obtained the PEDF
coding sequences for chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, [GenBank:BK005454]), chicken (Gallus gallus, [Genand
fugu
(Fugu
rubripes,
Bank:BK005453])
[GenBank:BK005455]) from genomic databases, and
have used other databases to identify or assemble the coding sequences for medaka (Oryzias latipes, [GenBank:BK005456]), pig (Sus scrofa, [GenBank:BK005457]),
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, [GenBank:BK005458]), African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis, [GenBank:BK005459]),
western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis, [GenBank:BK005463]), zebrafish (Danio rerio, [Genand
dog
(Canis
familiaris,
Bank:BK005460]),
[GenBank:BK005764]) PEDF. In total we have identified
the PEDF sequence in an additional three mammalian
and seven non-mammalian species. We did not find a
PEDF gene in the fly (D. melanogaster) or worm (C. elegans) genome databases, or in the sea squirt (C. intestinalis) the closest invertebrate to the vertebrate lineage.
Serpin F2 and C1 inhibitor are the closest relatives of PEDF
As might be expected, alignments of the PEDF DNA
sequences reveal few homologies. However, when these
sequences are compared pairwise, the relatedness within
each phylum is very clear (Table 1).

The phylogenetic relationships of many serpins have been
described previously [22]. As a by-product of searching for
PEDF genes we identified 13 homologues of other serpins
in many vertebrates, and 7 serpin homologues in sea
squirt, one of the invertebrate species with closest relationship with vertebrate. Previous studies also have identified a number of serpin genes in both fly and worm. Our
phylogenetic analysis shows that none of these invertebrate serpins are orthologous to the PEDF gene. A few
show some relationships with other clades of human and
mouse serpins (Fig. 1). The data strongly suggest that the
PEDF gene first appeared in vertebrates.
The phylogenetic relationships among PEDF and other
vertebrate serpins are shown in Figure 2 (full list in Additional file 1). Although some parts of the phylogenetic

tree are not reliable enough, with a bootstrap score less
than 50, the sub-tree consisting of PEDF sequences and
their close relatives are validated by most scores above 50.
The PEDF sequences maintain the expected phylogenetic
relationships among the species. For example, the fish and
the mammalian PEDFs are both clustered appropriately
within their respective phyla. In previous phylogenetic
trees constructed from a smaller number of sequences, the
serpin most closely related to PEDF (serpin F1, clade F1)
is Serpin F2/alpha-2-antiplasmin (clade F2), which is
adjacent to PEDF on chromosome 17 (Fig. 2). The next
closest PEDF relative is complement C1 inhibitor (clade
G1) that maps to chromosome 11ql2-q13.1. With the
additional sequences we have identified, this region of the
tree is now reorganized and shows that Serpin F2 and CI
inhibitor appears to be more closely related to each other
than to PEDF though they are still the closest relatives of
PEDF.
The PEDF gene is transcribed in many vertebrate species
To ensure that the DNA sequences we found were transcribed in the different species, we amplified cDNAs prepared from fresh tissue or cultured cell lines where these
were available. Primers for the various species were based
on our predicted mRNA sequences. PEDF sequences were
amplified from dog, pig, chick, African clawed frog,
zebrafish, fugu and medaka (Fig. 3). We also amplified
African clawed frog serpin E2, fugu serpin F2, and pig serpins B2, Cl and F2. In each case we were able to amplify a
band of the predicted size, confirming that the genes we

detected in the genome databases are transcribed in adult
animals.
PEDF gene organization is conserved in vertebrates
The PEDF gene in all species examined contained 8 exons
and 7 introns (Fig. 4), although there are variations in the
lengths of these among the species as indicated in Table 2.
Differences in exon sizes are much smaller than those
observed for the introns, and one, exon 4, is identical in
size across all phyla. The most significant changes in the
structure of PEDF appear in fugu, with the largest exon
size variations seen in the non-coding regions of exons 1,
2, and 8. In general the fish have smaller PEDF introns.
The largest size variation in introns is seen in intron 1 with
variations ranging from 683 bp in fugu to 27,524 bp in
frog.

The complete genome sequences of human, mouse, chick,
fugu, western clawed frog and zebrafish were used to
examine the conservation of exon-intron splice junctions
among the species. The 5' ag and 3' gt intron/exon splice
junctions were conserved in all the species (Additional file
2). Statistically significant sequence similarities in the
PEDF exons are seen between human and mouse, and
between mammals and chick in exons 3–7, but no significant sequence homologies were detected in PEDF introns
(data not shown). From this analysis we predict that a
functional PEDF protein is produced in each of these species.

A 200 bp proximal PEDF promoter region is conserved in

We found no significant homologies between human and
non-mammalian species when sequences 5' to the PEDF
genes were compared. The more detailed analysis was,
therefore, confined to mammals. In Figure 5A, we present
pairwise comparisons of sequences that are 5 kb upstream
of the PEDF transcription start site for human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat. As expected, human and chimpanzee
are almost identical. Similarly, mouse and rat show exten-

sive regions of homology throughout the 5 kb region. On
the other hand, pairwise comparisons of human with
mouse and human with rat indicate that there are very
limited regions of similarity in the PEDF promoter. The
only substantial homologous region is the 200 bp immediately preceding the transcription start site. We scanned
the first 200 bp of the PEDF promoter upstream of the
transcription start site in human and mouse using TANSFACT DNA-binding matrix and identified putative DNA
binding sites for the transcription factors HNF4, CHOP,

and USF. These are clustered together within a 70 bp
stretch of the promoter (Fig. 5B). Further upstream, there
are isolated blocks of homology but these differ in position among the species. It is probable that the regulation
of PEDF in vertebrate is controlled by this 200 bp promoter region.
SINE and LINE transposable elements are present in the
introns, exons, and promoter sequences of the mammalian
PEDF gene
Alu's are mobile DNA elements inserted in genomic DNA
shown to be rich in binding sites for transcription factors.
A regulatory role for Alu sequences in differention and
development has been established for several developmental genes where Alu was shown to act as an enhancer
or silencer of gene expression [24]. Alu elements were first
noted in the promoter region of the human PEDF gene
[25]. A more extensive analysis of repetitive elements in
the PEDF promoters and gene for four species is presented
in Figure 6. In human PEDF, all the repeats are of the short
interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) class, which are usually derived from tRNAs. Most of the PEDF SINE class
repeats are of the Alu family but there are also a few Mir
family repeats in the gene. In mouse, the elements were
more varied. Many SINE class repeats were identified but
there were also some long interspersed nuclear element
(LINE) class repeats present. We have not been able to
find any repetitive sequences in the chick PEDF gene or its
promoter region using the available knowledge of repeat
sequence structure in this species. We found only two
short stretches of simple repeats in the fugu PEDF introns
but have no information regarding repeats in the promoter because this region is less well-defined. In human
and mouse, the repetitive elements in the promoters were
extensive but sufficiently varied in length and position, as
well as type, to substantially alter the overall structure of
the 5' region. Within the PEDF gene, all the repetitive elements are located in the introns but again there were differences between human and mouse in length, position,
and type of elements (Fig. 6).

Conservation of order of genes flanking the PEDF
sequence
Gene order conservation is a useful genomic measure for
predicting functional interaction and relatedness among
genes within a cluster. Selective processes are essential to
preserve the organization of these clusters in closely
related species. Conservation of the gene cluster is
believed to be associated with the integrity of the cell and
the functional relatedness of the genes comprising the
cluster. In addition to the human and mouse, we obtained
the sequence of the PEDF gene and surrounding region for
chick, frog and several fish species from the genomic databases. Examination of an approximately 100 kb region of
the human 17pl3.3 region shows that PEDF is immediately flanked by Serpin F2 (a2-antiplasmin) and WDR81
at the 5'end (Fig. 7). These three genes are separated by
intergenic distances of 6.7 kb and 6.4 kb, respectively. At
the 3' end, PEDF is flanked by SMYD4 and RPA1 at intergenic distances of 1.9 kb and 0.3 kb respectively. Mouse,
chick and frog all showed the same arrangement of these
five genes, although the intergenic distances varied substantially (Fig. 7). The results indicate that the genes
immediately surrounding PEDF, are syntenic among species across three phyla.

In the fish species, however, the organization of the
regions around the PEDF gene was very different from that
of human (Fig. 8A). In fugu and tetraodon (Tetraodon
nigroviridis) the genes appear to be distributed among
three chromosomes (Fig. 8B). On one chromosome
FLJ33817 – SerpinF2 – (1.5 kb) – RPA1 – RTN4RL1 were
identified. The PEDF gene is located on a different chromosome while Smyd4 and another RPA1 gene are
mapped to a third chromosome. In zebrafish the genes are
also arranged on 3 different chromosomes, although not
identical to the other fish species (Fig. 8C).
PEDF dN/dS ratio in mammals and fishes show that the
gene is under strict purifying selection
The approach of non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio is widely used to detect positive selection
(directional selection), neutral selection and negative
selection (purifying selection) [26]. We have analyzed the

dN/dS ratios between PEDF genes in three groups from
different species: mammals (human, chimpanzee, pig,
mouse and rat), fishes (fugu, tetraodon, and trout), and
frogs (X. laevis and X. tropicalis). The dN/dS pairwise analyses show that the ratios between mammalian PEDFs are
around 0.11 and the values between fish PEDFs are
around 0.13, respectively (Table 3). No significant difference in dN/dS ratios was found between mammal and
fish groups. The ratio between two frogs is 0.25. We also

used the two-value model to test the difference between
these two groups and the result was consistent with the
ratios observed above, indicating that PEDF genes in
mammals, fishes, and frogs are under strict purifying
selection.

tors so far described, is neuroprotective to cells in many
parts of the nervous system, regulates the kinetics of exit
from stem cell pools and inhibits growth of a number of
tumors [8,9,27-30]. There is evidence that these diverse
functions may be due to the activation of multiple signaling cascades in a cell type and microenvironment specific
manner [15,31,32].
PEDF is only found in vertebrates
We found a single PEDF gene in all vertebrate phyla examined from fish to mammals. We did not find PEDF homologues in fly, worm, or the sea squirt even though these
species have many other easily detectable serpin genes.
Recent phylogenetic analyses of genomic data indicate
that tunicates, which comprise sea squirts, appendicularians and salps, are the closest living relatives of vertebrates
[33]. Thus, it is likely that the PEDF gene evolved after the
separation of the vertebrate lineage about 550 million
years ago but before the separation of the major vertebrate
phyla, at least 300 million years ago.

Several differences in structure and development between
invertebrates and vertebrates may explain the need for regulatory factors such as PEDF. Most invertebrates develop
largely in a strict lineage from a limited set of precursors.
Vertebrates tend to rely more on generation of a pool of
stem cells and from which differentiated progeny arise.
PEDF plays an important role in this by regulating the size
of the pool of stem cells [8]. As vertebrates evolved a vascular system, genes such as PEDF may have become essential to maintain the structural and functional integrity of
the newly formed vessels. In human neovascular diseases,
there is evidence that regulation of the balance between
vascular quiescence and vascular proliferation is critical.
Two factors implicated in maintaining this equilibrium
are the antiangiogenic PEDF and the proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [27,32]. VEGF
homologues are found in insects where they function as
regulators of hematopoetic cell production [34,35]. In
early vascular evolution, the activity of VEGF could have
been modified to promote vessel growth. At the same

time, PEDF could have evolved to provide a counteracting
influence essential to safeguard against abnormal vascular
proliferation caused by VEGF. PEDF is also neuroprotective and it is possible that this function became important
in vertebrates as they developed longer lifespans and a
need to protect neurons against a variety of environmental insults.

Differences in genes flanking PEDF between fish and other
vertebrates
Hierarchical clustering of serpin genes confirms that the
two most closely related to PEDF are serpin F2/a2antiplasmin and serpin G1/C1 inhibitor. Serpin F2 is part
of the same clade of serpins defined by the exon/intron
organization [23,36]. Like serpin F2/a2-antiplasmin, ser-

pin G1/C1 inhibitor is a classical protease inhibitor. This
cluster of three genes is thought to have arisen from a
common ancestor and is an example of ancestral serpins
diverging into inhibitory and non-inhibitory subgroups.
A common ancestral gene could have duplicated to give
rise to the precursor of PEDF and the precursor of serpin
G1/C1 inhibitor and serpin F2/a2-antiplasmin. The latter
precursor then could have duplicated to allow the independent evolution of serpin F2/a2-antiplasmin and serpin G1/C1 inhibitor.
The PEDF region is syntenic in mammals, birds and
amphibians, arguing for strong conservation of this gene
cluster for a considerable evolutionary time. There are at
least two possible mechanisms that maintain the integrity
of this gene cluster. First, selective pressure on one gene in
the region could create linkage disequilibrium that would
effectively reduce structural alterations, which could disrupt the synteny. Second, the existence of rapidly evolving
repetitive elements in this region may decrease the probability of chromosome rearrangements. Bony fish can be
classified into two groups, the lobe-finned fish and the
ray-finned fish. Lobe-finned fish are considered to be the
probable ancestors of all land vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, avians, and even amphibians. Ray-finned
fish are the dominant group of vertebrates, with over
27,000 species ubiquitous throughout fresh water and

marine environments. It has been proposed that a whole
genome duplication occurred in the ray-finned fish lineage after its separation from lobe-finned fish about 450
Myr ago [37,38]. The fish species we examined all belong
to the ray-finned fish group. The dispersal in fish of the
cluster of genes around PEDF is probably a result of the
whole genome duplication. Interestingly, each of the
three fish species examined has retained only one copy of
PEDF gene. One explanation of this is that PEDF expression is tightly regulated and that it will be very difficult to
precisely control it by two separate promoters.
PEDF could play similar roles in all vertebrates
In general, if one gene is under pure natural selection,
which removes deleterious mutations from a population,
then its dN/dS ratio will be less than 1.0. The smaller is
this ratio means more critical functions the gene plays in
the organisms. It stands in contrast to positive selection
that means this gene is optimizing its function or even
adopting a new function which will give the organism
some advantage in the environment, and the dN/dS ratio
will be greater than 1.0. In this study, the lower dN/dS
ratio of mammals, fishes, and frogs analysis suggests that
all PEDFs genes through vertebrates are under strict purifying selection, even though the dS and dN rates in fishes
are obviously greater than in mammal, but the dN/dS
ratios in these two groups are very close. These observa-

tions suggest that PEDF genes play critical roles in all vertebrates, and it is also very likely that they work in the
same biological processes in the vertebrates.

decrease with senescence, elevated oxygen tensions, and
during ischemia (reviewed in [9]), but the regulatory elements responsible for these changes are not yet known.

Conservation of PEDF gene structure through vertebrate
species
All PEDF genes show structural conservation of 8 exons
and 7 introns, with no evidence of exon shuffling or
duplication. There are, however, some interesting size differences between these elements. The overall gene size
varies from 2.9 kb in the condensed genome of fugu to
43.8 kb in frog. This variation is, in large part, due to differences in intron sizes. The greatest variability in size relationship was observed in frog, zebrafish, and fugu exons.
Five of the exons, consisting entirely of coding sequence,
were of identical lengths in human, mouse and chick.
Only two exons of fugu PEDF were identical in size to
those of the other species. The others had small reductions
in length and result in a predicted protein that is only 18
amino acids shorter than human PEDF. The high conservation of the PEDF protein sequence in such distantly
related species argues for conservation of the PEDF function throughout evolution. It is possible that the reduced
intron sequences of fugu represent the minimum essential
component of the gene structure that allows for functional activity of the PEDF gene.

The varying numbers and positions of repetitive elements
in the 5' region may cause a variable positioning of important regulatory regions such that they cannot be detected
by routine homology searches. The Alu elements themselves may be another regulatory component of the
human PEDF gene. Alu elements are a feature of primates
only and related but different sequences are seen in the
mouse PEDF promoters. Alu elements, once considered
genomic junk, are now believed to contain genetic information important to primate evolution and gene regulation [46]. These elements are peppered throughout the
human genome and contain a unique sequence that can
be mutated at a single base to create a new splice site and
give a different version of a protein [47]. Although Alu
sequences are a significant proportion of the human PEDF
promoter and introns, PEDF splice variants have not been
identified. As with other serpins, one function of these
repetitive elements may be to attach the PEDF gene to the
nuclear matrix [48].

The conservation of the PEDF gene does not extend into
the promoter region. Analysis of approximately 5 kb of 5'
DNA sequence revealed that only limited regions of
homology exist even between mouse and human PEDF.
The conserved proximal region does have promoter activity, as judged by transfection experiments [39]. A small
group of conserved transcription factor binding sites was
identified in the proximal promoter of PEDF. HNF4,
hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, controls expression of specific
genes in hepatocytes [40], and is involved with accumulation of hepatic glycogen stores, organization of the sinusoidal endothelium [41], and maturity onset diabetes of
the young (MODY) [42]. CHOP/C/EBP homologous protein/DNA damage-inducible gene 153 serves as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the transcription factors C/EBP
[43], controls endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis, and plays a central role in neuronal apoptosis during brain development [44]. USF is a
ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulating factor and a
member of the basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-Leucine Zipper
transcription factor family with high affinity for cognate
E-box regulatory elements. USF controls lipid and glucose
metabolism and regulates genes involved in stress and
immune responses [45]. Because of the strong conservation of these transcription factors in the mammalian
PEDF promoter, we predict that the PEDF gene is under
the control of these molecules in mammals and linked to
their biological actions. PEDF levels increase in injury and

In summary, we have derived the structure and sequence
of the PEDF gene from a range of vertebrate species. We
have assembled PEDF sequences from 10 additional species and these can now be used to help us further understand the structural, regulatory, and functional
conservation of this molecule. These new sequences also
provide the necessary information to develop specific
probes with which to study the expression and function of
PEDF in these species. There is strong conservation in
defined regions of the PEDF gene suggesting that these
conserved sites are critical for function. Knowledge of the
evolutionary dynamics of PEDF could be a valuable predictor of the function of this gene and provides the opportunity for understanding the genetics, regulation, and
biologically essential domains of this molecule.

Methods
Data sources of cDNA and protein sequences
The human, mouse, and rat PEDF cDNA sequence were
obtained from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site
[49]. A blastp search in a database of predicted genes was
performed to detect the PEDF gene in fugu [50]. The nonredundant sequence database and EST database in NCBI
were used to perform blastp searches to collect entire or
partial cDNA sequences of PEDF and other serpin genes in
species of chimpanzee, cow, pig, chick, trout, medaka,
zebrafish, African clawed frog, western clawed frog, and
dog [51].

Data source of genome sequences
PEDF genomic sequences for mouse, rat, dog, western
clawed frog, zebrafish and fugu were assembled using the
BLAT tool in the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site [49].
Genomic information for other species was obtained by
blastn search of Genome WGS (Whole Shotgun
Sequence) database of each species [52].
Phylogenetic tree analysis
Protein sequences of serpin genes (annotated or nonannotated) for species of sea squirt, fly and worm came
from Ensembl database [53]. These sequences and other
protein sequences of typical serpin genes in human and
mouse were used to construct the phylogenetic tree of serpins. We also used protein sequences of all available PEDF
and other serpins in vertebrate species to construct the
phylogenetic tree.

All phylogeny trees were constructed using "MEGA", a
molecular evolutionary genetics analysis software [54].
All protein sequences were aligned by clustal alignment
function, then the bootstrap concensus tree was
contructed by UPGMA method.
Sequence similarity comparison between species
DNA Block Aligner was used to align DNA sequences in
promoter region between species [55]. The subsequent
model was a 3-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

Program 'fasta34' was used to pairwisely compare the
exon sequences between two species [56]. Then the matrix
in Table 1 was constructed by our python codes based on
the result came from fasta program.
Sequence repetitive analysis and other software
RepeatMasker [57] was used for repetitive element analyses on PEDF genomic sequences of various species. The
EMBOSS package [58] was used for routine manipulation
of sequences.
Promoter analysis
The promoter sequences of PEDF gene from human and
mouse genomes were obtained from UCSC Genome Bioinformatics website [49] and the possible transcript factor
binding sites were examined in the -200 to +1 bp of each
promoter sequence using the positional weighting matrices which are from TRANSFAC databases [59]. The footprints of sequence conservation between human and
mouse promoters were generated by program Dna Block
Aligner came from software package Wise 2.0 [55].
Semi-quantitative PCR
Total RNA isolation was performed essentially as
described before [60]. Primers designed for different species are shown in Additional file 3. cDNA was subjected to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/248

semiquantitative PCR using the PEDF primers listed
below. PCR conditions used were: denaturing, 95°C for 1
min, annealing, 56°C for 1 min and elongation, 72°C for
1 min, for 30 cycles. PCR amplification products were
electrophoresed on 4% agarose gels and bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. GAPDH or b-actin
gene fragments were amplified as controls to determine
PCR and cDNA loading efficiencies.
dN/dS non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate
ratio analysis
CDS sequences for PEDF genes in species were obtained
from NCBI. We assembled all CDS sequences and protein
sequences of PEDF in three groups from different species:
mammal, fish, and frog and stored into different files
respectively. These CDS sequences were aligned by our
home-made python program according to the alignment
of their protein sequence. A program based on maximum
likelihood algorithm was used to calculate the rate of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution (program
codeml, from Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) website [26,61].

We run the program codeml in pairwise mode (runmode
= -2) to calculate the dN/dS ratio between any two species
in the same groups. The result was collected and formatted by our own python program and shown in Table 3.
We also run the program codeml in two-value branch
mode (runmode = 0, mode = 0; all mammals for one ratio
value and all fishes for another ratio value) to calculate
the average dN/dS ratio in each group from different species.
GenBank submission
A total of 23 new serpin sequences, including 10 PEDF
genes, were identified and submitted to NCBI GenBank as
