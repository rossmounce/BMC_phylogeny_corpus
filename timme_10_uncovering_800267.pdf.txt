Abstract
Background: The large and diverse land plant lineage is nested within a clade of fresh water green algae, the
charophytes. Collection of genome-scale data for land plants and other organisms over the past decade has
invigorated the field of evolutionary biology. One of the core questions in the field asks: how did a colonization event
by a green algae over 450 mya lead to one of the most successful lineages on the tree of life? This question can best be
answered using the comparative method, the first step of which is to gather genome-scale data across closely related
lineages to land plants. Before sequencing an entire genome it is useful to first gather transcriptome data: it is less
expensive, it targets the protein coding regions of the genome, and provides support for gene models for future
genome sequencing. We built Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) libraries for two charophyte species, Coleochaete
orbicularis (Coleochaetales) and Spirogyra pratensis (Zygnematales). We used both Sanger sequencing and next
generation 454 sequencing to cover as much of the transcriptome as possible.
Results: Our sequencing effort for Spirogyra pratensis yielded 9,984 5' Sanger reads plus 598,460 GS FLX Standard 454
sequences; Coleochaete orbicularis yielded 4,992 5' Sanger reads plus 673,811 GS FLX Titanium 454 sequences. After
clustering S. pratensis yielded 12,000 unique transcripts, or unigenes, and C. orbicularis yielded 19,000. Both
transcriptomes were very plant-like, i.e. most of the transcripts were more similar to streptophytes (land plants +
charophyte green algae) than to other green algae in the sister group chlorophytes. BLAST results of several land plant
genes hypothesized to be important in early land plant evolution resulted in high quality hits in both transcriptomes
revealing putative orthologs ripe for follow-up studies.
Conclusions: Two main conclusions were drawn from this study. One illustrates the utility of next generation
sequencing for transcriptome studies: larger scale data collection at a lower cost enabled us to cover a considerable
portion of the transcriptome for both species. And, two, that the charophyte green algal transcriptoms are remarkably
plant-like, which gives them the unique capacity to be major players for future evolutionary genomic studies
addressing origin of land plant questions.
Background
The ancestry of all living land plants (embryophytes) can
be traced back to a single colonization event from a
charophyte green alga. In other words, the tremendous
diversity we see in land plants today--from mosses to redwoods and orchids--all descended from a single common

ancestor that colonized land 430-470 million years ago
[1,2]. Uncertainty remains concerning the precise relationships between embryophytes and their algal relatives
[3-8], but there is no serious doubt that the origin of land
plants occurred from within the charophytes. There are
six orders of charophyte green algae that, when embryophytes are included, comprise the Streptophyta sensu lato
(s.l.) [9]: the Mesostigmatales, Chlorokybales, Klebsormidiales, Zygnematales, Coleochaetales and Charales.

Both phylogenetic and fossil evidence suggest that these
orders are extremely old lineages, comparable in age to
the land plants [2]. Therefore, an understanding of the
biology of land plants based on comparative genomics
would benefit greatly if data were available from these
organisms. Unfortunately, in most cases the genome size
is poorly characterized, the tools of molecular genetics
are not well developed, or cultures are difficult to maintain. Consequently, the acquisition of genomic data from
these organisms has lagged other lineages. To move
toward comprehensive genomic analysis of charophytes,
we undertook EST analysis of two representative charophytes, Spirogyra pratensis and Coleochaete orbicularis.
Despite there being significant genomic resources
available for the broader group of green algae, including
Chlorophyta, there is only one published EST library to
date that directly bears on the charophytes, that of
Mesostigma viride [10]. Mesostigma is a unicellular,
monotypic genus that in some analyses is placed as sister
to the rest of streptophytes [6,11-14], although other
studies have placed it as a sister to all other green algae
[15,16]. In either case, its EST library is a valuable
resource for this study. Most taxonomic and ecological
diversity in the green algae resides in the Chlorophyta, a
large clade sister to the streptophytes. Among the important organisms in this sister clade are the model organism
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the ecologically significant Ostreococcus tauri. Both of these organisms have
fully sequenced and published genomes [17,18].
According to Darwin's centralizing theme of descent
with modification, one would predict that all land plant
genes should have a homolog in the charophytes unless
there was horizontal gene transfer from a non-plant
organism, or unprecedented neofunctionalization. However, any one lineage of charophytes might be expected to
have lost or modified some of these in the 500 million
years or more of independent evolutionary history that
separates each lineage from embryophytes. In this context, it is to be expected that land plant genes and their

associated molecular pathways either originated in the
charophytes or, if more ancient, were retained along these
green algal lineages leading up to the colonization of land.
Thus, it is important to sample broadly among the charophytes if the homologs of key embryophyte genes are to
be identified.
In recent years PCR-based approaches have been used
to fish out specific land plant genes of interest in the
charophyte lineages, but advances in sequencing technologies have now made it far more efficient to gather highthroughput genomic data and work backwards, using
plant gene models to annotate the putative homologous
genes. Sequencing expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is an
efficient first pass at gathering a large portion of the
genomic coding regions. We undertook here an analysis
of two distantly related charophyte taxa: Spirogyra pratensis Transeau (Zygnematales) and Coleochaete orbicularis Pringh. (Coleochaetales). Both of these lineages are
essential to understanding the placement of land plants in
the context of their nearest living green algal relatives. In
addition, evidence of land plant molecular pathways,
such as the ethylene response pathway, in the charophytes would reveal the origins of key plant molecular
processes.

clustered by Agencourt. The 454 assembly along with the
raw Sanger reads were then clustered together using our
in-house pipeline (Figure 1). This two-stage clustering
method reduced the demand on computational power for
the final assembly (CAP3 run on a desktop with 10 GB of
RAM was not enough memory to cluster all the raw data
together). It also allowed for careful tracking of each
sequencing effort contributing to the final assembly. The
average length of unigenes (contigs + singletons) in the
combined 454 and Sanger sequence assembly was 813 bp
for C. orbicularis and 571 for S. pratensis.
Summarizing the composition of the clustered ESTs is
complex due to our two-step assembly procedure (the
454-only assembly followed by a combined 454 + Sanger
assembly) (Table 2). Results from the Coleochaete orbicularis CAP3 assembly produced 19313 unigenes: 3,854
contigs and 1,549 singletons with the average length of
contigs at 1,313 bp and singletons at less than half of that
at 688 bp. The Spirogyra pratensis-combined assembly
resulted in 12,191 unigenes: 1,707 contigs (average length
1,265 bp) and 10,490 singletons (average length 458 bp).
The singletons category actually comprised several types
of data: 454-only contigs from the first assembly, single
454 reads and single Sanger reads. Most of the singletons
were in fact 454-only contigs for both EST libraries (numbers in Table 2). The number of reads per unigene was
low on average, with the vast majority of unigenes comprising only one to five reads (Figure 2). A few contigs
had higher numbers of reads, the most numerous being
one S. pratensis contig with 258 reads.
Because ESTs are, by definition, sequences derived
from messenger RNA, it follows that they should all contain at least a portion of protein-coding sequence, but
several forms of contamination are possible. Our
sequencing effort included 5' Sanger sequencing plus 454
sequencing, which is generated from sequencing shorter
reads from sheared cloned inserts. Due to this strategy,
we expected to recover the 5' (and possibly the 3') UTR
and some portion of the coding sequence. However, in
addition to mRNA, there is a chance of contamination in
the EST library from non-coding nucleic acids, such as

rRNA, tRNA and genomic DNA. These contaminants
were removed from the final unigene set after ESTscan
determined the putative coding regions in the sequences.
By definition only the putative protein coding sequences
were included in the final unigene set. Out of 12,191 total
unigenes in Spirogyra pratensis, 25%, or 2,076, had no
coding region detected. Coleochaete orbicularis had a
lower percentage of non-coding contaminants, at 16%, or
3,080 sequences in which no protein-coding region was
detected.
Taxonomic Assignment

Although every attempt was made to produce axenic cultures, including streaking and isolation off agar plates,
antibiotic treatments, and zoospore isolation, we settled
on "very clean" cultures. Because of this we anticipated a
few contaminants based on low bacterial contamination
observed when we grew the culture on agar plates. For
this reason, the unigenes (all nucleotide sequences for the
unique contigs and singletons) were BLASTed against the
NCBI non-redundant (nr) nucleotide database using
BLASTx for taxonomic lineage assignment. Eight major
taxonomic categories were recovered as top hits for each
Spirogyra pratensis and Coleochaete orbicularis: Archaea,
Viruses, Bacteria, Fungi, Chlorophyta, Streptophyta, various other Eukaryotes, and unigenes with no significant
hits (Figure 3). The proportion of hits for each species
was very similar and therefore will be summarized
together. About 10% of hits were possible contaminants
(Bacteria, Fungi and various other Eukaryotes) and
roughly 2-3% were hits to the other lineage of green algae,
Chlorophyta (several chlorophyte genomes were present
in GenBank at the time of this analysis). The remaining
~85% were split fairly evenly between the top hit being a
streptophyte (mostly land plants) or no hits returned at
all (e-value < 0.0001). A significant percentage of ESTs
received no hits at all: 41% and 48% for S. pratensis and C.
orbicularis, respectively. In this class of unknown unigenes, a significant portion of the sequences did not contain
a protein prediction using ESTScan [19]. About half of
the Spirogyra "no hits" and one-third in the Coleochaete
"no hits" category were not included in the predicted protein set of unigenes, which means they are most likely a
mixture of genomic and non-coding RNA contaminants.
That leaves about 20% and 28% of putative novel genes in
S. pratensis and C. orbicularis, respectively.
Because GenBank does not have uniform taxon sampling across the tree of life, it is important not to place too
much significance on the BLAST based lineage assignment for the unigenes. For example, a small fraction of
hits to metazoan taxa (included in the "various other
Eukaryotes" category) most likely represents either a conserved protein domain or an ancestral gene lost in land
plants, and not a metazoan contaminant. Likewise,

BLAST hits to bacteria and fungi, unless evaluated individually, should be treated with caution. On the contrary,
this means that up to 10% of the ESTs from each of these
species could be derived from bacterial and fungal contaminants and not from the charophyte for which it's
assigned. The analyses in this manuscript were largely
focused on the unigenes that had similarity to land plant
genomes, so it is unlikely that contaminant unigenes
affected any of our major conclusions.
Orthologous Genes

The results of the lineage assignment introduced the
question of how many genes in each EST library are actually shared with chlorophytes vs. streptophytes. To
address this question, the protein predicted unigenes for
Coleochaete orbicularis and Spirogyra pratensis, plus
complete proteins from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a
chlorophyte) and Arabidopsis thaliana (a streptophyte)
were included in an all-vs-all pair-wise BLASTp. The
reciprocal best hits (RBHs) between any two, three or
four species were interpreted to be orthologs if all pairwise possibilities in the ortholog set were each other's
reciprocal best hit. All RBH overlaps are displayed in a
Venn diagram (Figure 4). The total number of unigenes
(or, proteins, in the case of the two reference genomes)
for each species can be obtained by adding up all the
numbers in the respective ovals. For example, a set of 718
unigenes are RBHs for all four species. A different set of
114 unigenes are RBHs for the charophytes + Chlamydomonas, but not for Arabidopsis.
Although there are many overlaps to report, the most
interesting results from this analysis concerns the overlap
between our species of interest and its overlap with chlorophytes vs. streptophytes. Looking at pair-wise comparisons only, C. orbicularis shares 1,707 orthologs with
Arabidopsis vs. 562 with Chlamydomonas. Spirogyra
pratensis has a similar pattern, with 1,030 shared Arabidopsis orthologs and 318 shared Chlamydomonas
orthologs. This pattern holds up with three-way RBHs: C.
orbicularis + S. pratensis share 553 orthologs with Arabi-

dopsis verses 114 with Chlamydomonas. (A list of RBHs
shared by the charophytes + Chlamydomonas are
included in Additional File 1.)
A list of genes hypothesized to be important in early
land plant colonization, or "green genes," was generated
from Graham et al. [20]. Each of these genes had at least
one hit between the two libraries, except for the MADS
domain, which had no hits in either library (Table 3). The
following genes had at least one hit in both Coleochaete
orbicularis and Spirogyra pratensis: RSW1 (cellulosic cell
wall), GEM1/MOR1 (cytokinetic phragmoplast), CTR1
(plasmodesmata), and MERISTEM LAYER1 (multicellular sporophyte body). WUSCHEL and GNOM (asymmetric cell division) were only found in C. orbicularis and
the expansins were only found in S. pratensis. A moss
(Physcomitrella patens) and a chlorophyte (Chlamydomonas reinhartii) were included as references. Although all
of these are significant BLAST "hits" (e-value < 1e-20)
they can only be interpreted as genes of interest. Any
orthology determination would need a more vigerous follow-up analysis.
Gene Ontology

The Gene Ontology (GO) categories recovered from
Blast2GO analyses were summarized by the proportion
of unigenes annotated in each GO level 3 category (Figure 5). The complete set of proteins for Arabidopsis thaliana was included in the analysis as a relative proportional
measure since the GO assignments were all derived from
A. thaliana annotations. Overall, Spirogyra pratensis and
Coleochaete orbicularis unigene sets were remarkably
similar in relative proportions, but they deviated from A.
thaliana in several categories. Three categories stood out
in biological processes (BP): both green algae were underrepresented in cellular metabolic process and regulation
of biological quality (p < 0.001; p < 0.001 for S. pratensis
and C. orbicularis respectively), but they were overrepresented in the biosynthetic processes category (p < 0.001;
p < 0.001). For molecular function (MF), the green algae
unigenes were overrepresented in transferase activity (p <

Discussion
Both charophyte EST libraries are very land plant-like.
More specifically, most of the transcriptome is more similar to embryophytes (land plants) than to other green
algae in the chlorophyte lineage (the other green algal lineage sister to the streptophytes). There are some exceptions, however, which are interesting. Looking just at
BLAST hits against NCBI's non-redundant (nr) protein
database, 2% (214 unigenes) and 3% (488 unigenes) of the
transcriptome had a top hit to a chlorophyte in Spirogyra
and Coleochaete, respectively. While this is only a small
fraction of total unigenes, it suggests possible shared
ancestral genes between the chlorophyte and streptophyte lineages that were lost along the land plant lineage.
For example, there are flagellar-associated proteins in
both Spirogyra (two) and Coleochaete (13) that have top
BLAST hits to Chlamydomonas and Ostreococcus, but
that have no hits to Arabidopsis or any other land plant.
Plants lost their flagellate cells in the Gymnosperms,
which left Angiosperms with no motile cells. It follows
that the flagellar-associated proteins would also be lost in
flowering plants, infact, analysis of the much more ances-

tral moss genome revealed a loss of flagaller associated
genes [21] that are found in other green algal and animal
genomes[18]. The fact that there are no significant land
plant hits suggests that these proteins were lost or underwent substantial sequence divergence in the early land
plants. Also interesting is the mere presence of flagellarassociated proteins in Spirogyra, which lacks motile cells
entirely. Containing genes for an absent structure further
supports the evolutionary placement of this lineage as
being derived from flagellate ancestors. An earlier
hypothesis had the Zygnematales grouped with other
non-flagellate organisms in a separate phylum defined by
lack of motility [22], which our data clearly reject.
The overwhelming similarity to land plants also is
revealed in a separate analysis in the identification of
orthologous genes between our two green algae, Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis, as shown in the Venn diagram
(Fig.4). The charophytes share two to three times as many
orthologs with Arabidopsis than they do with Chlamydomonas. Both the BLAST analysis and the ortholog
identification reinforce the overall similarity between
these lineages of green algae and land plants. Of course, a
robust phylogeny of any given gene is needed before firm
conclusions can be made regarding its gain or loss along
the plant lineage. The point here is that even a simple
BLAST analysis or ortholog identification can reveal key
genes to target for follow-up study.
There are a large number of putative novel genes in
both EST libraries (20% and 28% for Spirogyra pratensis
and Coleochaete orbicularis, respectively). The term
'novel' is being used here to refer to genes with no obvious
similarity to a model-organism sequence: i.e. new to scientists, not necessarily to the charophytes. We are classifying the unigenes as novel if they satisfy two criteria:
they contain a protein-coding region predicted by ESTScan [19] and no BLAST hits returned against the NCBI
non-redundant protein database. The closest fully
sequenced genomes to the charophytes at the time of this
publication are several embryophyte genomes, including
Physcomitrella patens and Arabidopsis thaliana (which
have at least 450 million years divergence with the charophytes) and Chlamydomonas or Ostreococcus in the chlorophyte lineage (which have 700-1,000 million years
divergence) [2]. Because of the relative distance between
charophytes and their nearest sequenced organisms, it is
not surprising that they would contain genes with no
obvious similarity to the current published genome-scale
sequences. There are two alternative explanations for the
enlarged amount of "ESTs without BLAST hits". First, the
short sequences may represent non-conserved portions
of genes, and, second, independent 454 sequence
stretches may correspond to the same novel gene, but
they do not overlap due to their limited sequence length.
This last caveat would apply across the entire set of clus-

CDSs of noted genes were BLASTed against protein databases of two reference genomes, Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas reinhartii,

tered set of ESTs for both species. Aside from these concerns, most of these novel sequences do appear to be
unique, at least within the available data. A pair-wise
BLAST between the S. pratensis and C. orbicularis sets of
novel unigenes only revealed a small amount of overlap:
out of 2,661 S. pratensis novel genes, only 24 had a hit in
C. orbicularis. In addition, the reciprocal BLAST revealed
only 27 hits in the reverse direction. None were reciprocal best hits.
The Gene Ontology analysis presents a summary of
transcript diversity relative to the annotated gene diversity in Arabidopsis. Where there are significant differences in the proportion of genes in a category, the
determination cannot be made whether there were fewer
genes expressed or that there are actually fewer genes
encoded in the genome--and the same goes for the relative over-expression. The observation that both charophyte green algal ESTs were so proportionally similar in
their gene expression categories suggests that we are not
missing any major class of gene expression and that we
have captured a fairly wide range of transcript diversity
representing the source genome's diversity. Spirogyra and
Coleochaete are separated in evolutionary time by 500700 million years and they do not share a similar gross
morphology. But the fact that they are so alike in transcript proportion, as compared to a flowering plant, is
interesting in terms of their evolutionary placement in
the streptophyte lineage. The green algae showed signifi-

cant difference with respect to Arabidopsis in most GO
categories, but only a few were markedly divergent.
The under representation of charophyte genes in some
of the Biological Process categories (Figure 5a) is not surprising. Although biological complexity is not easily
defined, it seems clear that embryophytes have a larger
number of cell types and are adapted to a wider range of
environmental conditions than are charophyte algae, and
consequently would be expected to have a higher proportion of genes expressed in categories involving organismal complexity. Both charophytes were significantly
underrepresented in their proportion of cellular metabolic process transcripts compared to Arabidopsis.
According to the Gene Ontology Consortium's (GOC)
description of this category --the chemical reactions and
pathways by which individual cells form chemical substances [23]--it stands to reason that the diversity and
abundance of transcripts in this class would be higher in
an organism with more diverse cell types, such as the
flowering plant taxon, Arabidopsis. The same interpretation goes for other underrepresented categories including
cell communication, response to endogenous stimulus
and regulation of biological quality. The latter category
had the most extreme underrepresentation of the Biological Processes categories and consequently may be one of
the more interesting categories in the study of the origin
of land plants. Biological quality is defined by GOC as "a
measurable attribute of an organism or part of an organ-

Figure 5 Gene Ontology. The relative proportion of Gene Ontologies for both charophyte ESTs shown against Arabidopsis thaliana proteins as a relative measure. Each graph represents 100% of the GO annotations for each species. The x-axis contains the GO categories, the y-axis shows the proportion of genes in each category. Fisher's exact test (based on a hypergeometric distribution) was used to calculate significance levels for
overrepresentation or underrepresentation of each charophyte verses the reference, A. thaliana (* p < 0.01, ** p < 0.001).

ism, such as size, mass, shape, color, etc." The charophyte
transcripts annotated to this category were similar to
genes involved in cell shape, such as DIMINUTO [24],
and various expansins [25]. It is logical to expect that the
proportion of genes associated with cell quality would
increase with organism complexity and our results are
consistent with this prediction.
The explanation becomes less clear in cases where
there is overrepresentation of charophyte genes in a given
Biological Process category relative to Arabidopsis.
Because we are comparing proportions of genes present
and not the actual number found, it is possible that there
might be a greater number of genes in Arabidopsis compared to one of the charophytes. But the proportion relative to the other categories is lower in our analysis. That
said, one of the more extreme overrepresentations (over
twice the proportion) of charophyte genes occurs in the
biosynthetic process category, which is defined by "the

chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of substances; typically the energy-requiring part of
metabolism in which simpler substances are transformed
into more complex ones" [23]. Examples of charophyte
genes that are annotated in this category are ribosomal
proteins, EF-1-alpha-related GTP-binding proteins, replication proteins, translation initiation factors and ATP
binding proteins. These are all core functioning genes
and therefore are not expected to diversify with increasing complexity. It is likely the case that the charophyte
transcriptomes contain a larger proportion of core functioning genes when compared to Arabidopsis, simply
because they are lacking diversity in the other classes.
Another way to look at it is that Coleochaete and Spirogyra cells are analogous to plant parenchyma and are
enriched for the kinds of metabolic processes that occur
in parenchyma, and not due to any trend towards increasing diversity of genes in charophyte biosynthetic pro-

cesses. This probably also holds true in the
photosynthesis category, where both charophytes show a
significant overrepresentation of genes relative to Arabidopsis. An alternative hypothesis would be that, lacking
structural complexity, charophytes have evolved a
broader range of biochemical responses to the environment. As with most EST studies, we cannot rule out the
possibility that the apparent over-representation might
be a sampling artifact due to non-normalized cDNA or
incomplete coverage.
Ontology by Cellular Compartment (Figure 5c) reveals
one extreme difference in the membrane category
whereby the charophytes are extremely underrepresented. It follows that parenchymatous tissue (i.e. the
plant tissue of Arabidopsis) would involve an increased
level of cell-to-cell communication requiring many more
membrane proteins than would a filamentous organism,
like Spirogyra, or a two-dimensional disk-shaped form,
like Coleochaete.
Ultimately, we are interested in specific genes that
allowed a lineage of charophytes to colonize land so successfully and give rise to land plants. Because the experimental approach was a survey, and because the work
reported here constitutes just a part of the overall effort
to gather transcriptome data for all of the charophyte
orders, we are highlighting genes of interest to follow up
for further study. It is encouraging that most of the genes
identified by Graham et al. [20] as likely to have been
important in the colonization of the land have solid hits
and perhaps even true orthologs in both Coleochaete
orbicularis and Spirogyra pratensis (Table 3). A couple of
the more interesting genes associated with asymmetric
cell division (WUSCHEL and GNOM) have hits in Coleochaete, but not Spirogyra. This is consistent with the morphology of the organisms; Spirogyra, an unbranched,
filamentous alga does not have asymmetric cell division,
but Coleochaete definitely does. No significant BLAST
hits of the Graham et al. genes were found in the ESTs of
the earliest diverging streptophyte, Mesostigma virde.
Another interesting finding is the presence of ethylene
biosynthesis and signalling pathway genes (Table 4), long
thought to be unique to land plants. This finding suggests
that ethylene might be utilized in the charophytes. Wang
et al. [26] showed that Chara spp. (also a charophyte)
showed ethylene binding activity similar to that of land
plants, so it is not too surprising that these genes should
be present in other charophyte lineages. However, to the
best of our knowledge, evidence of ethylene-signalling
genes in charophytes has not been shown before this
study.

laris as a first step toward complete genome analyses.
Algal cultures were grown and collected in various life
stages as well as at different times during the day. All of
these factors were part of an effort to maximize the total
number of transcripts available for each pulled EST
library. We combined both Sanger and 454 sequencing
technologies to obtain as much sequence coverage as
possible. Both of the resulting EST libraries gave a nice
diversity of transcripts (unigenes), with the 454
sequences contributing to most of that transcript diversity. This is especially pronounced when looking at the
sequencing source of the singletons: Sanger reads only
contributed a small fraction of the total singletons in both
EST libraries (Table 2), and the 454 data alone covered
most of the sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing.
Although there have been just a few 454 transcriptome
sequencing efforts to date [27-31], our results suggest
that for studies of this type, 454 sequencing alone could
largely replace traditional Sanger Sequencing. In summary, the specific genes we mention in this paper (Tables
3 and 4), along with the Gene Ontology analysis and
ortholog identification, reinforce our finding of the overall genomic similarity that these two charophytes have to
land plants.

Methods
Algal sampling and material collection

The following criteria were used for our taxon sampling:
the availability of cultures and ease of cultivation, the
presence of a sizable research community, the history of
research with this organism, the perceived potential for
development of advanced molecular tools, and their key
evolutionary positions in two major charophyte orders.
Spirogyra pratensis Transeau (UTEX LB 928) (Zygnematales) and Coleochaete orbicularis Pringsh. (UTEX LB
2651) (Coleochaetales) were grown up in Guillard's
Woods Hole medium [32] at 18°C and a 12:12 LD photoperiod with a photon flux of 180-200 μmol s-1 m-2. Cultures were harvested during log phase growth in a variety
of conditions to maximize the diversity of transcripts: at
intervals at 7 am, 12 pm, 4 pm and 9 pm; after sitting in a
dark enclosure for 24 hours; and after being exposed to
20 min of -20°C. Spirogyra pratensis filaments were
removed from the medium using a sterile glass hook,
wicked to remove excess moisture, dropped in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Coleochaete orbicularis cultures were scraped from the culturing flask, pelleted at 4000rpm, dropped in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.

to 2 × RNA extraction buffer as described in La Claire
and Herrin [33], in which case a modified version of this
protocol for RNA isolation was followed. After each isolation, the nucleic acid concentration and OD ratios (260/
280 and 260/230) were quantified with a NanoDrop
(Thermo Scientific NanoDropTM 1000 Spectrophotometer, Wilmington, DE) and the quality of RNA, or the
degree of degradation, was determined by running 1 μg of
total RNA on a 1.2% agarose MOPS/formaldehyde gel
(Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX) stained with
ethidium bromide, then examining the rRNA banding
patterns. High-quality, clean RNA was pooled until 1 mg
of total RNA was reached.
cDNA construction

Total RNA (1 mg) was shipped on dry ice to Agencourt
Bioscience
Corporation
(Beverly,
MA)
where
Poly(A)+RNA from total RNAs was isolated by two
rounds of oligo(dT) selection with oligo(dT) coated magnetic particles (Seradyn, Inc.). From the poly(A)+RNA,
cDNA libraries were constructed by using an oligo dT
primer-adapter containing a Not I site and Moloney
Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV
RT) to prime and synthesize first strand cDNA. After the
second strand was synthesized, the double stranded
cDNA was size fractionated (< 1.2 kb), cloned directionally into the pExpress 1 vector and grown up in T1 phage
resistant E. coli.
DNA sequencing

DNA sequencing for Spirogyra pratensis and Coleochaete
orbicularis included both 5 prime Sanger reads and 454

sequencing technologies: S. pratensis had a targeted
10,000 Sanger read plus a full plate of GS FLX Standard
454 sequences generated; C. orbicularis had a targeted
5,000 Sanger reads plus a full plate of GS FLX Titanium
454 sequences generated.
Sanger sequencing

DNA from the clones was purified using Agencourt's
proprietary large-scale automated template purification
systems using solid-phase reversible immobilization
(SPRI). The purified DNA was then sequenced using ABI
dye-terminator chemistry and then run on ABI 3730 × l
(Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA) machines.
454-sequencing

3-5ug of isolated DNA was nebulized to a mean size
range of 3-500 bp, followed by a size selection of fragments >300 bp by column exclusion and Ampure™ (Agencourt Bioscience, Danvers, MA) isolation. The correct
size selection was confirmed on an Agilent DNA 1000
LabChip. Adapters were ligated onto the fragments and
selected using library capture beads. The single stranded
fragments were isolated with 0.125 N NaOH, followed by
neutralization with acetic acid, and purified. Single
stranded library was validated qualitatively by Agilent
RNA Pico 6000 LabChip and quantitatively by Invitrogen
Ribogreen assay. Standard library dilutions were made
according to published protocol. The library was amplified onto DNA capture beads by emulsion PCR (emPCR).
DNA capture beads were collected by washes with isopropanol, Roche 454 emPCR collection reagents, and filtered syringes. Sequencing primer was annealed by
thermocycler. Collected beads were quantified by count-

ing on Beckman Multisizer. Beads for each genome were
placed on the picotitre plate, sequenced on the Roche 454
GS FLX instrument, and analysed with base-calling software using default parameters.
EST Analysis

The clustering was preformed in a two-step process.
First, 454 library construction adapter sequences were
trimmed, then the reads were clustered using MIRA vs
2.9.43 [34,35] with 454 EST assembly specific parameters.
Second, the raw Sanger reads were combined with the
454 contigs + singleons (along with their respective quality scores) and were cleaned and clustered using the
EST2uni pipeline [36]. (See Fig. 1) This pipeline used
Phred [37,38], SeqClean [39], Lucy [40], and RepeatMasker [41] to remove low-quality sequence, vector contamination and low complexity regions. It then clustered the
clean reads with CAP3 [42] using a 100 bp plus 95 percent identity of overlap. ESTscan [19] predicted the protein-coding regions in the contigs and singletons using
the score matrix from Arabidopsis thaliana. At this point,
the unigenes (contigs plus singletons) were available in
three forms: raw nucleotides, predicted amino acids and
nucleotide coding sequences (cds). Annotation of the
unigenes was determined in a variety of ways. To screen
for contamination, we BLASTed nucleotide unigenes
against NCBI's non-redundant protein database (nr) (evalue < 0.0001), producing a lineage assignment for each
EST. Taxonomic ID and lineage information for each
BLAST hit was retrieved from NCBI Entrez using inhouse perl scripts. Gene annotation was performed by
BLASTing the predicted amino acid unigenes against the
model plant, A. thaliana (TAIR8) (e-value < 10-6). The
top hit was extracted with an in-house perl script and
used for the EST unigene annotation.
The putative orthologs between our two charophytes,
Spirogyra and Coleochaete, a land plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, and a chlorophyte, Chlamydamonas reinhartii were
determined using the reciprocal best hit (RBH) criterion
[43]. An all-by-all BLASTp (e-value < 1e × 10-6) was preformed on the proteins from each of the four taxa. In
house perl scripts were used to parse the blast hits,
extract the RBH pairs, and expand the pairs to include
RBHs for multiple genomes/transcriptoms. The RBHs
between any two, three or four species were interpreted
to be orthologs if all pairwise possibilites in the ortholog
set were each other's reciprocal best BLAST hit.
The BLAST results against Arabidopsis thaliana were
also used for Gene Ontology (GO) annotation by importing the .xml BLAST results into the program Blast2GO
[44]. Gene Ontology assignments were performed as follows: first, associated GO terms were mapped to the top
hits of the BLAST search (against A. thaliniana) and, by
extension, to the EST unigene; select GO annotations
were chosen from the mapped group of GO terms; and

Page 11 of 12

finally, a combined graph analysis for Biological Processes, Molecular Function and Cellular Compartment
resulted in a level three GO distribution. Arabidopsis
thaliana GO analysis was included in the bar graph for
reference and a Fisher's exact test (based on a hypergeometric distribution) was used to calculate significance
levels for overrepresentation or underrepresentation of
each charophyte vs. the reference, A. thaliana.
Arabidopsis genes of interest in early land plant evolution were obtained from http://www.arabidopsis.org/
then BLASTed against both Coleochaete orbicularis and
Spirogyra pratensis (BLASTx, e-value < 1e-20). The number of BLASTx hits with e-values below this threshold
were considered possible homologs for the plant gene of
interest.
The individual reads comprising each EST library were
deposited in GenBank. The Sanger reads are located in
dbEST under the following accession numbers: Coleochaete orbicularis (GenBank: GW591203-GW595666),
Spirogyra pratensis (GenBank: GW595667-GW602960).
The 454 sequences are in the Sequence Read Archive
(SRA): C. orbicularis (GenBank: SRX017046.2), S. pratensis (GenBank: SRX017045.2). The clustered ESTs are
available for download on the author's webpage [45].
