Abstract
Background: In general shell-less slugs are considered to be slimy animals with a rather dull
appearance and a pest to garden plants. But marine slugs usually are beautifully coloured animals
belonging to the less-known Opisthobranchia. They are characterized by a large array of interesting
biological phenomena, usually related to foraging and/or defence. In this paper our knowledge of
shell reduction, correlated with the evolution of different defensive and foraging strategies is
reviewed, and new results on histology of different glandular systems are included.
Results: Based on a phylogeny obtained by morphological and histological data, the parallel
reduction of the shell within the different groups is outlined. Major food sources are given and
glandular structures are described as possible defensive structures in the external epithelia, and as
internal glands.
Conclusion: According to phylogenetic analyses, the reduction of the shell correlates with the
evolution of defensive strategies. Many different kinds of defence structures, like cleptocnides,
mantle dermal formations (MDFs), and acid glands, are only present in shell-less slugs. In several
cases, it is not clear whether the defensive devices were a prerequisite for the reduction of the
shell, or reduction occurred before. Reduction of the shell and acquisition of different defensive
structures had an implication on exploration of new food sources and therefore likely enhanced
adaptive radiation of several groups.

Background
Very often, non-shelled gastropods are considered to be
slimy and non-attractive. This connotation usually refers
to terrestrial species of the Stylommatophora belonging to
the well-known Limacidae or Arionidae and in particular
to garden snails, which do have negative effects on our
horticulture. However, the Opisthobranchia are beautifully coloured "slimy" gastropods and exclusively occur in
marine habitats. Non-scientists only meet these animals

while diving for pleasure. One group of opisthobranchs,
however, has become very famous throughout natural
and even medical sciences: Aplysia californica Cooper,
1863, the sea hare, belonging to the subgroup Anaspidea
(Fig. 1E). It is a classic example for neurobiological investigations, involving behaviour. It was E.R. Kandel, who
performed many of his investigations on learning and
memory on this animal [1]. He created the basic understanding of nerve functioning and learning in human

beings and was awarded the noble prize of medicine in
2000 for his life time research on these animals.
Only in very few species of Opisthobranchia, the shell is
big enough so that the animal can withdraw completely.
In most species the shell is reduced in size, internalised or
lost completely. Opisthobranchs are much less diverse in
species numbers (5000 to 6000) than the terrestrial Stylommatophora (about 30000 species), or the shelled
marine gastropods, in former times named "Prosobranchia" (60000 species), but they show many biological features that are unique or rare in the animal kingdom
and that are often related to foraging or defensive strategies [2]. These include incorporation and usage of intact
chloroplasts from algal cells for feeding strategies
(Sacoglossa, Fig. 1D) [3], or storage of intact cnidocysts
from cnidarians for defence (Aeolidoidea, Fig. 2E, G, H)
[4]. Some of them are able to synthesize toxic compounds
or to uptake these secondary metabolites from their food
in order to use them as repellents (Nudibranchia, Chromodorididae, Fig. 2C) [5]. Many of these biological phenomena are hardly understood because investigation of
biological data is scarce. Evolution of different strategies is
not known, because of the lack of well-supported phylogenetic analyses.
Knowledge on the different subgroups of the Opisthobranchia differs according to their availability and spectacular appearance. For example, many more data on
feeding strategies and other biological features are available for the beautifully coloured Nudibranchia (Fig. 2),
than for the tiny and inconspicuous Acochlidacea. The
authors have worked on different aspects of the biology of
the Opisthobranchia for many years, trying to promote
our understanding of this peculiar group. Although the
Opisthobranchia is a rather small taxon, this group is
ideal for evolutionary studies. Recently, Wägele reviewed
potential key characters that might have enhanced radiation within the Opisthobranchia [2]. She has used a working hypothesis on opisthobranch phylogeny and
published data on different strategies to deduce her proposals. She discussed the gizzard in Cephalaspidea, kleptoplasty in Sacoglossa, kleptocnides in Aeolidoidea,
symbiosis with unicellular algae in Phyllodesmium Ehrenberg, 1831 and mantle dermal formations in Chromodorididae. Cimino and Ghiselin [6] and Cimino et al. [7]
discussed the loss of the shell and the acquisition of toxic
substances as a driving force in the evolution of
Sacoglossa. Glandular structures and acquisition of chemical defence is subject of several reviews [8-13]. In the
present review, our knowledge on Opisthobranchia is
briefly summarized with emphasis on reduction of the
shell and its implications on life history, especially regarding foraging and defence. Additionally new results on several glandular structures are presented. Some glands are

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/3

described here for the first time. We point to a new aspect
in the evolution of defensive devices. Their primary function as excretory or detoxification organs should be taken
into consideration. It is beyond the scope of this review to
include all new data on morphology, histology and phylogeny, as well as the literature published on the Opisthobranchia. The intention is to draw attention to a
fascinating group of animals with a species number of
manageable size, and in which similar evolutionary traits
occurring in different groups at the same time and their
implications can be analysed.

Results
Figure 3 represents a preliminary phylogenetic tree of the
Opisthobranchia, as well as a few members of the Pulmonata and basal Heterobranchia. This tree is based on data
obtained by morphological and histological analyses.
Characters are listed in table 1 (see additional file 2) and
the data matrix in table 2 (see additional file 1). A complete discussion of characters and obtained trees is in
preparation. In the tree presented here, all characters are
treated as unweighted and unordered (see methods
below). A similar comprehensive tree of the Opisthobranchia, based on 18S and 28S genes is published by
Vonnemann et al. [14]. These authors did not include
basal Heterobranchia, Pteropoda and enigmatic forms,
e.g., the Rhodopidae (Fig. 4). Comparison of these two
most recently obtained morphological and genetic trees
shows that nearly all major opisthobranch subgroups are
monophyletic, but the position of some of these groups
differs between the cladograms. These differences mainly
concern the position of the Acteonoidea, Tylodinoidea
and Acochlidacea (highlighted in both Figs. 3 and 4 by
bold bars). Nevertheless evolutionary traits concerning
the fate of the shell can be detected within well-defined
clades (see Figs. 3 and 4: shell internalisation is indicated
by grey arrows, shell loss by black arrows). Several groups
included in the trees will not be considered in this study,
because they are not assigned to the Opisthobranchia.
These groups are the basal Heterobranchia, Pyramidellidae and Pulmonata. Furthermore, this discussion focuses
more closely on the morphology-based tree, because
more taxa are included there.
Description of monophyletic groups
Acteonoidea
The families Acteonidae and Hydatinidae form sistergroups, the position of the debatable monophylum is
under discussion. All acteonoids have a shell that resembles that of many prosobranchs (Fig. 1A). Some of the
members are able to withdraw completely into the shell
and to close the shell with an operculum, e.g. Acteon tornatilis (Linné, 1758). Acteonidae and Hydatinidae are carnivorous and mainly feed on polychaetes. No defensive
strategies are known from these animals although

histological investigations show a highly glandular area in
the mantle cavity and the mantle rim. The mantle rim
glands, for example, are very conspicuous. These comprise
large epithelial cells that are filled with a non-staining vacuole (Fig. 5A). The glandular area is highly folded. The
cells appear to lie subepithelially due to their size. They
alternate with small ciliated cells. The hypobranchial
gland in the roof of the mantle cavity is small and consists
of violet-staining epithelial cells indicating acid mucopolysaccharides (Fig. 5B).
Pteropoda
This group living exclusively in pelagic waters comprises
two major clades, the herbivorous Thecosomata and the
carnivorous Gymnosomata. Many thecosomates still have
a shell whereas the Gymnosomata have lost it. The latter
feed on the former. Many morphological adaptations
have occurred due to their life in pelagic waters. Defensive
mechanisms are hardly known from pteropods. Whereas
the Thecosomata do not show specialized defensive glandular structures in the outer epithelium, peculiar structures of rather unknown function can be found in the two
species of Gymnosomata investigated here. Both species
show single large glandular cells, with one vacuole and a
larger nucleus. The contents of the vacuoles only stain in
smaller, probably immature, cells. In larger cells they are
translucent (Fig. 5C).
Cephalaspidea
Members of following families have been included in this
analysis: Smaragdinellidae, Haminoeidae, Retusidae, Cylichnidae, Bullidae, Philinidae, Aglajidae, Gastropteridae
and Diaphanidae. Monophyly on family level was not
recovered for the Diaphanidae and Cylichnidae. Furthermore, the Cephalaspidea (Acteonoidea excluded) is not
monophyletic due to the inclusion of the Anaspidea. In
our analysis, the gizzard-bearing groups form one clade,
representing the Anaspidea (Fig. 1E) and the Cephalaspidean families Smaragdinellidae, Haminoeidae, Retusidae,
Cylichnidae (Fig. 1B), Bullidae and Philinidae. Runcina
Forbes & Hanley, 1853 and a yet undescribed Philinoglossa
Hertling, 1932, both with a gizzard, are not part of that
monophyletic group. The gizzard is a muscular oesophagus with 3 to 10 large gizzard plates that function like a
grinding mill (Fig. 6A). Feeding strategies are highly
diverse within these different groups. Herbivory is known
only from cephalaspids with gizzard plates, whereas carnivory is widely spread within all other cephalaspidean
groups with or without a gizzard. Prey items are mainly
polychaetes, bivalves and in a few cases congeners.
Runcina and Philinoglossa feed on diatoms.

Whereas many herbivorous slugs still have an external
shell, e.g. Bulla Linné, 1758, Haminoea Turton & Kingston,
1830, Retusa Brown, 1827, Cylichna Lovén, 1846, etc.,

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/3

only a few carnivorous cephalaspids have retained a large
shell (e.g. Scaphander Montfort, 1810) (Fig. 1B). Many
have an internalized shell (Fig. 1C, Chelidonura Adams,
1850, Gastropteron Meckel in Kosse, 1813) or have lost it
all together (Siphopteron Gosliner, 1989). Cephalaspideans have several glandular structures, although their function is hardly understood. The hypobranchial gland is
composed of epithelial cells staining violet (Fig. 5E). This
gland can be very voluminous (e.g. in Haminoea callidegenita Gibson & Chia, 1989) or can be reduced (in many
cephalaspids with small and reduced mantle cavity, e.g.
Chelidonura tsurugensis Baba & Abe, 1959). In many
Cephalaspidea single glandular cells can be observed that
stain bluish and open to the outside by a small duct (Fig.
5E, glandular cells above hypobranchial gland). These
glands usually are confined to the mantle cavity roof. A
special type of single gland is present in very few members
of the Cephalaspidea, namely the Blochmann's glands.
One characteristic is the duct leading to the outside that is
composed of a few small cuboidal cells. The contents of
these glands do not stain (Fig. 5D).
Anaspidea
This group, which is mainly characterized by two pairs of
head tentacles (Fig. 1E), is closely related to the gizzard
bearing cephalaspids. Nearly all species have a reduced
shell or no shell at all (none of the latter species are
included in the analyses presented here). In general,
Anaspidea feed on red, brown and green algae. The group
is known for their defensive habits, by using an ink gland
when disturbed. The glands are typical Blochmann's
glands already described for Cephalaspidea. Another
gland is also widespread in Anaspidea and assumed to be
an additional defensive gland, the so-called gland of
Bohadsch, or opaline gland (Fig. 5F). It is composed of
large cells containing a large nucleus. In general they are
considered to be special forms of the Blochmann's gland
[8,15]. The glands open at the bottom of the visceral cavity and stain violet. In a few species single glandular cells
are arranged around a single opening. Additionally, the
single blue-stained subepithelial glandular cells already
described in Cephalaspidea (see Fig. 5E) are present in the
dorsal mantle cavity.
Tylodinoidea
This tiny group is characterized by a rather large foot, and
the umbrella-like shell covering the viscera, but not the
foot (Fig. 1F). Data on biology of this small group are
scarce. Probably all of them feed on poriferans. The Mediterranean Tylodina perversa (Gmelin, 1791) fosters the
secondary metabolites from its exclusive food, the sponge
Aplysina aerophoba Schmidt, 1862 [16]. Becerro et al. [17]
demonstrated that the slug actively selects for sponges
with a high concentration of cyanobacteria, whereas
sponges without these bacteria (e.g. A. aerophoba from

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:3

deeper waters, or A. cavernicola) were neglected. Histological investigation show that the Tylodinoidea have several
peculiar glands. In the dorsal mantle tissue of Umbraculum
umbraculum (Lightfoot, 1786), many tubules of a highly
ramifying gland (Fig. 5G) lead to one or two main ducts
that open to the outside in the anterior mantle rim above
the mouth. Tylodina perversa has glandular tissue in the
same area as U. umbraculum, but it has several ducts leading to the outside, all lying at the anterior dorsal mantle
rim (Fig. 5H).
Sacoglossa
This group is monophyletic. In the morphological tree
presented here (Fig. 3), the non-shelled Elysia species
appears as the most basal one, whereas shell-bearing
sacoglossans, like Cylindrobulla, are more derived. External
morphology of sacoglossan species shows a high diversity.
A rather primitive large and coiled shell is present in Cylindrobulla Fischer, 1857 and Ascobulla Marcus Ev., 1972.
Others, like Oxynoe Rafinesque, 1814 and Lobiger Krohn,
1847, have tiny shells, whereas the shell is lost in all Elysiidae (Fig. 1D). A peculiar bivalved shell is present in the
family Juliidae. Many sacoglossans feed on green algae
(Ulvophycea) by piercing the algal cells with their radular
teeth and by sucking the contents into their digestive tract.
Defensive glands are not so obvious, but cryptic appearance obtained by an uptake and storage of chloroplasts is
evident for many species as can be seen for Elysiella pusilla
Bergh, 1872 feeding on the alga Halimeda Lamouroux,
1816 (Fig. 1D). Investigated Sacoglossa are characterized
by many subepithelial glands with violet-stained contents
(Fig. 7A). But the quantity of these cells differs to a great
extent among species. Placobranchus ocellatus van Hasselt,
1824, a shell-less slug, is unique in having many globular
structures arranged along the edge of the mantle rim (Fig.
7B). These structures have a diameter of nearly 1 mm and
are composed of many cells each with a large vacuole. The
contents of the vacuole stain bluish.
Pleurobranchoidea
Shells, when present, are internalised (Fig. 1G). Pleurobranch species feed on different prey items, but they are
all carnivorous, some even feed on congeners. Typical for
the group is a huge acid gland lying in the visceral cavity
and opening into the oral tube next to the mouth. The
gland is composed of huge cells with non-staining vacuoles (Fig. 7C). Additionally, several species show a highly
glandular notum epithelium with huge subepithelial
glandular follicles composed of cells with non-staining
vacuoles (Fig. 7D). Several members, like Tomthompsonia
Wägele & Hain, 1991, have spicules in their notum (Fig.
6D).

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/3

Nudibranchia
All members of the monophyletic Nudibranchia have lost
the shell completely (Fig. 2A–H). This taxon, with about
3000 species and a high diversity in shape and in biology,
is the largest opisthobranch group and comprises about
half of the known opisthobranch species. Two monophyletic clades can be recognized, the Anthobranchia (Fig.
2B, C, F) and the Dexiarchia (Fig. 2A, D, E, G, H). The
former mainly feed on Porifera, Bryozoa and Tunicata, the
latter on Cnidaria, mainly on octocorals. Defensive strategies are very diverse in the Nudibranchia and comprise
different techniques. Many species of the Anthobranchia,
especially those feeding on sponges, have spicules in the
notum (Fig. 6E). Many species are characterized by a
highly glandular epidermis (Fig. 7E). Nearly all members
of the very species-rich family Chromodorididae (Fig. 2B)
have so called mantle dermal formations (MDFs) lying in
the mantle tissue (Fig. 7G). These are globular structures
with a diameter of up to 1 mm. MDFs are composed of
cells with huge non-staining vacuoles.

Many Dexiarchia species are also characterized by a glandular epidermis. Especially members of the Dendronotoidea (here Tritonia Cuvier, 1798 and Dendronotus Alder &
Hancock, 1845) are characterized by epithelial glandular
cells in which the vacuole is filled with homogenously
stained contents (Fig. 7F). Aeolidoidea have so called cnidosacs at the tip of their notal cerata that represent the apical parts of the digestive glandular tubes running within
the cerata. In these cnidosacs, the cnidocysts from their
cnidarian prey are stored and can be used against potential enemies (Fig. 6B).
Other groups in the cladogram
According to the phylogeny presented in Fig. 3, several
taxa are united in a monophylum. Systematic relationships of some groups have been discussed for a long time
(Acochlidiacea, Rhodopidae), others have been considered to belong to the Cephalaspidea (Philinoglossidae,
Runcinidae). Their sister-taxon relationship is not solved
yet and the presented cladogram is debatable.
Nevertheless they have in common some evolutionary
traits, e.g. the complete loss of the shell, their small size
compared to other opisthobranchs and their food preference for diatoms and detritus. According to histological
results, no particular defensive glands could be detected
and defensive strategies probably lay in habits. Many of
them burrow in sand and/or are cryptic in colour.

Discussion

Pleurobranchoidea,
Nudibranchia,
Anthobranchia,
Cladobranchia). Concerning relationships of major
groups, several congruencies with former analyses can be
observed: The sister-taxon relationship of the Nudibranchia and Pleurobranchoidea [14,24] is found in
nearly all analyses. This group nowadays is called Nudipleura Wägele & Willan, 2000. A further consistent grouping is formed by Cephalaspidea s.str. and Anaspidea. This
relationship was already discussed by Mikkelsen [20,23].
All other presented groupings are still under debate. In
our morphology-based tree, Elysia represents the most
basal taxon within the Sacoglossa. This contradicts other
available phylogenetic analyses and has to be considered
with care. Jensen presented a thorough phylogenetic analysis on Sacoglossa [25]. According to her results, taxa with
a shell are more basal and shell reduction occurred at least
twice within the Sacoglossa. In the discussion below, we
follow the results of Jensen and Mikkelsen and consider
the shell-bearing sacoglossans as more basal [23,25].
Despite these incongruities, a discussion of shell reduction in the different groups and its implications on life
history (habitat, feeding and defensive strategies) can be
undertaken, and will serve as a guideline for further
investigations.
Implications on life style
A shell is generally considered to be a protection against
predators, such as fish, crabs and other vagile organisms.
"If the shell of a whelk (e.g. Buccinum, a "prosobranchiate" caenogastropod, annotation of the authors) is broken
away and the soft animal is then offered to a hungry cod,
it is eaten readily." (p: 115) [26]. Reduction, internalisation or loss of the shell within Opisthobranchia implies
other defensive strategies. Shell reduction within molluscs
is uncommon, and occurs mainly in the highly mobile
cephalopods. In gastropods, shell loss is rare in
paraphyletic prosobranchs, and known only from few
groups of Pulmonata, e.g., the Gymnomorpha and the
stylommatophoran groups Arionidae and Limacidae.
However, shell reduction occurred many times within the
different subgroups of Opisthobranchia. Here, an internalization or complete loss occurs within the Cephalaspidea s.str, Anaspidea, Sacoglossa, Acochlidiacea and
Pleurobranchoidea (Fig. 3). Whereas complete loss of the
shell is not known from any member of the small taxon
Tylodinoidea (about 15 species), this character state
occurs in the stemline of the Nudibranchia and Gymnosomata. When estimating species numbers with no shell
or a rather tiny internal shell and comparing this to the
number of species with a larger external shell, the former
outnumber the latter by far.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/3

shell. Advantages probably lay in the exploration of new
habitats, which are more difficult to reach when being
protected by a shell. This can be observed e.g. in a subgroup of the Cladobranchia. The Aeolidoidea are able to
graze on fragile hydrozoans (Fig. 8E). This kind of prey is
used by few other invertebrates, e.g., Solenogastres, members of the Pycnogonida and of the Amphipoda [27-29].
Burrowing forms with a shell, e.g., Scaphander or Acteon
Montfort, 1810, have an elaborate cephalic shield that
partially covers the shell and renders them streamlined.
Loss of the shell probably enables slugs to search for food
in sandy or muddy habitats more easily. This is the case
for members of the Cephalaspidea s.str. and
Acochlidiacea.
Basal members of the Sacoglossa have retained a shell, but
more derived ones have lost it. Shell loss allowed evolution of a phenomenon that is unique in the animal kingdom. Sacoglossa in general feed on algae by piercing the
cells with their tooth and sucking out the contents of the
cell. The cytoplasm is digested, but in many species (e.g.
Elysia timida (Risso, 1818), Placobranchus ocellatus) the
chloroplasts are stored in distinct branches of the digestive gland. Here they are stored for a period of several days
to months [30]. For this phenomenon, the term "cleptoplasty" is used by several authors [25]. The functioning
chloroplasts continue with photosynthesis within the slug
and provide nutritional metabolites for the metabolism of
the gastropod [3,13,31,32]. Penetration of light into the
slug would be hindered by the possession of a shell. A
similar system is observed in members of the
Nudibranchia, e.g., in Phyllodesmium jakobsenae Burghardt
& Wägele, 2004, or Melibe bucephala Bergh, 1902) [33,34].
Here unicellular algae (zooxanthellae) from the coral
food or from the free water column are stored in the digestive system and metabolites of these zooxanthellae are
used for the slug's own purposes [35-37]. According to
published phylogenies and to our own results (unpublished data of both authors) on Sacoglossa and Nudibranchia, it can be assumed that uptake of chloroplasts or
zooxanthellae first enhanced crypsis (Fig. 1D) [25]. The
short-term storage allows a continuation of the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts within the slug. Storage over
a longer period allowed the reduction of food uptake with
the possibilities to search for new and/or less frequent
prey organisms [2,38]. The most effective symbiotic relationships are known for the sacoglossan Elysia chlorotica
Gould, 1870, which can survive eight months without
food [3], the aeolid Pteraeolidia ianthina (Angas, 1864)
and the dendronotoidean Melibe bucephala, both of which
survived in our aquaria for 10 months without food
(Burghardt & Wägele unpublished data).

Loss of the shell therefore can be assumed to have advantages compared to the presence of a protective but heavy

Implications on defence
Loss of a shell as a protective structure led to an array of
different defensive structures. Some of these traits can be
observed as a combination in one and the same species.

Crypsis can be observed in many groups and is very often
achieved by incorporation of the same dyes from the food
(Fig. 8C, Phyllidia flava Aradas, 1847). Cryptic appearance
also is achieved by mimicking the same patterns or even
outline of the substrate. Corambe pacifica MacFarland &
O'Donoghue, 1929 perfectly mimics the colour patterns
of its prey, the bryozoan Membranipora de Blainville,
1830. Phyllodesmium jakobsenae mimics the feathered polyps of the soft coral Xenia Lamarck, 1816, on which it lives
[33], whereas the cerata of P. briareum (Bergh, 1896) are
smooth like the tentacles of its prey, the soft coral Briareum Blainville, 1830 (Fig. 8D). Zebra effects are
achieved by patterns with blotches like that in Peltodoris
atromaculata Bergh, 1880 (Fig. 8A) or by stripes. Looking
like unpalatable sponges (Fig. 8B, Jorunna tomentosa
(Cuvier, 1804)) is very common in spicule-bearing
dorids. According to Gosliner [39], the cryptic species are
rather basal taxa, whereas the taxa with aposematic colour
patterns are more derived – a hypothesis that has yet to be
proven by thorough phylogenetic analyses that include all
species of the subgroup in question.
A unique defensive strategy within animals is the storage
of cnidocysts ("cleptocnides"), which is typical for nearly
all members of the cladobranch Aeolidoidea [4,9,40].
This group mainly feeds on cnidarians, with priority on
Hydrozoa. The mechanisms of the uptake of cnidocysts,
so that explosion is not triggered during consumption, are
still not understood. It is assumed that the slug exudes a
mucus to hinder explosion [9,26]. Investigated aeolids,
like Aeolidia papillosa (Linné, 1761), have a highly glandular oral tube (Fig. 6C) that supports this hypothesis.
Another theory implies that there occurs a kind of acclimation process, similar to that discussed between sea
anemones and anemone fish [41]. According to the investigations of Greenwood and Mariscal [42] only immature
cnidocysts are stored in the cnidosac, whereas mature
ones are digested. But, histological investigation of many
aeolids directly collected from their food have not
revealed high numbers of exploded cnidocysts in the
stomach (unpublished data of HW). Only Notaeolidia
schmekelae Wägele, 1990 from the Antarctic Ocean has
been observed to have many exploded cnidocysts in its
digestive tract [43].
Presence of spicules in the notum as a defensive strategy
was discussed by several authors [10,44]. Spicules are
present in many shell-less Anthobranchia and Acochlidiacea, but also in members of the Pleurobranchoidea, which
sometimes have an internalised small shell. Spicules never

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/3

occur in opisthobranchs with a larger shell. CattaneoVietti et al. investigated the mineral composition of dorid
spicules and found calcite (CaCO3) and brucite
(Mg(OH)2) [45]. Smaller spherules are composed only of
calcite. Harris described feeding experiments offering various opisthobranchs to specimens of Navanax Pilsbry,
1895 (Cephalaspidea), who is a ferocious predator on
opisthobranchs [10]. This species rejected all spiculose
dorids.
Another evolutionary trait for defence, and discussed as a
prerequisite for shell reduction at least in sacoglossans
[13], is the uptake or de novo synthesis of secondary
metabolites that are toxic to possible predators [5,46].
Uptake by feeding on toxic prey (mainly algae, Porifera,
Bryozoa, Tunicata and Cnidaria) is the major source of
compounds, whereas de novo synthesis is known only
from few taxa [5]. When dietary derived, Avila called these
cleptochemicals, following the terms cleptoplasts and
cleptocnides for incorporation and use of chloroplasts in
Sacoglossa and cnidocysts in Aeolidoidea [5]. Literature
on chemical compounds in opisthobranchs is numerous.
Some reviews summarize our knowledge [5,7,46-49].
Compounds mainly belong to the terpenoids, especially
the insoluble sesquiterpenoids and diterpenoids. Little is
known about the function of the biological compounds,
although their defensive tasks are very often postulated [57,46]. Few feeding experiments have been performed in
the past, demonstrating a toxic effect on crustaceans and/
or fish [26,50]. Also the translocation from prey into the
slug, and the transformation by changing the chemical
structures either by degradation through digestion, or by
an active mechanism into a more effective chemical, is
hardly understood [5,7]. Location of the compounds is
investigated only for few species, by analysing certain
parts of the body [51], or even by isolating larger organs,
like the MDFs [52]. Tracing the compounds within the
tissue, or even cells, using immunohistochemical methods has never been done. Therefore, it is not possible to
correlate chemical bioactivity with certain histological
structures, except for the mantle dermal formations in the
species Hypselodoris webbi (Chromodorididae) [52].
Inorganic compounds, like sulphuric acid are produced in
few groups. Their function and location is better known
due to the extensive work of Thompson [53-55]. He analysed the production of sulphuric acid in different members of Gastropoda, including members of the
Pleurobranchoidea, Cephalaspidea and Dorididae. The
exudated acid contains inorganic chloride and sulphate
anions, and traces of organic substances. He was able to
localize the acid by histochemistry within the large vacuoles in the median buccal gland (Fig. 7C) and the subepithelial glands of Pleurobranchoidea (Fig. 7D). There, the
acid is held in active form [53]. Gillete et al. investigated

Page 14 of 18

Frontiers in Zoology 2005, 2:3

the role of the central nervous system and peripheral
nerves for exudation and showed positive feed back [56].
Broad histological investigations of the Opisthobranchia
show that many species are characterized by a large array
of glandular structures [8,11,57-59]. These comprise single glandular cells lying in the outer epithelia, or subepithelially. Glandular follicles composed of several cells
usually lie subepidermally and open via a duct to the outside. Larger organs are the MDFs, or the glandular tubules
of the median buccal gland in the Pleurobranchoidea.
Some of these structures have been known for a long time
and their defensive tasks were discussed in more detail by
Hoffmann [8]. Well known are the ink gland (Blochmann's glands) and the opaline gland (Bohadsch gland)
in the Anaspidea. Both glands exude substances that have
been shown to be toxic to cnidarians [1]. Probably these
substances also caused severe damage of the liver of a 40year-old man, who ate Aplysia kurodai Baba, 1937 [60]. By
experimental studies it was shown that the repellent substance in the ink gland is a monomethyl ester of phycoerythrobilin and is derived from phycoerythrin from the
consumed red algae [61]. The role of the opaline gland is
less known. According to Carté, the prosteroglandine with
the highest known biological activity is Dolastatin 10, a
natural product extracted from the anaspidean Dolabella
auricularia (Lightfoot, 1786) [62]. This large species of
more than 10 cm lives on the intertidal flats in the tropical
Indo-Pacific, where it would represent an ideal food for
birds and fishes, if not for that highly toxic chemical. This
substance is already applied in medical treatments (see
http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), and seems to be one of the
most potent anticancer agents.
Information on other glandular structures are rare, and
nearly nothing is known about their contents and their
functions. At the moment we are not able to trace the different substances in these glands to find out whether there
are any constraints concerning structure (and therefore
function) and the stored chemicals.

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/2/1/3

Ghiselin also mentioned that handling and utilization of
a particular kind of defensive metabolite allowed the
switch to food with similar compounds quite easily, and
therefore has driven adaptive radiation [46]. As an example they named the dorids and in particular the family
Chromodorididae, which show a large array of usage of
biochemicals from different sponges. Again, the bio-synthesis of compounds, as observed in Dendrodoris Ehrenberg, 1831, is considered to be the most derived form of
defence within the Anthobranchia.
Information on defensive strategies, as listed above, is
available now for several groups of the Opisthobranchia.
More and more reliable phylogenies are becoming available, which allow the identification of well-supported
branches and stemlines. Combining this knowledge, it
becomes evident that several defensive systems evolved
before the loss of the shell (several glandular structures, e.
g., the hypobranchial gland, mantle rim glands, Bohadsch
gland). Here we would like to extend the hypothesis of
Cimino et al. by addressing the problem of excretion [7].
It can not be ruled out that certain glandular structures
evolved as a kind of excretory system to get rid of ingested
toxic substances. Therefore it is not storage in special
organs that preceded the use of toxic substances, but the
necessity to expel them. By analysing phylogeny, it is evident that many defensive structures evolved after the
internalisation or loss of shells (e.g. acid glands in the
notum, cleptocnides, MDFs).
But we still have to identify the location of the compounds for a better understanding of the evolutionary history concerning the acquisition of toxicity, which certainly
was a driving force in the evolution of these fascinating
opisthobranchs. New techniques, e.g., the oligonucleotide aptameres, could help to solve this question [64].
We also have to keep in mind that chemical substances
might not only play a role in defence (allomones), but
also in reproduction and development (pheromones).

Conclusions
Only few hypotheses are formulated concerning acquisition of toxicity and loss of the shell. Faulkner & Ghiselin
assumed that chemical defence based on metabolites
derived from food preceded the reduction of the shell and
that chemical defence has been a driving force behind the
evolution of Opisthobranchia [13,46,63]. Cimino et al.,
by analysing the different compounds and their origin,
came to the conclusion that evolution within the
Sacoglossa started with the uptake and storage of
sesquiterpenoids from algae in species still having a shell
[7]. Within the shell-less members of the family Elysiidae,
diterpenoids from the algae were stored, whereas in
highly evolved forms, like Elysia timida, the slugs switched
to a de novo synthesis of polyproprionates. Cimino &

In this review it is shown that shell loss led to the evolution of a wide array of defensive strategies in Opisthobranchia. Nevertheless, it is not ruled out that some
defensive mechanisms have evolved prior to complete
loss of shell. This is evident when analysing the Acteonoidea. Members of this taxon have a rather thick and large
shell, but also different glandular structures along the
mantle fold, as well as in the mantle cavity. One working
hypothesis for future research is that defensive glands
evolved from simple storage organs while feeding on toxic
prey. Evolution of special structures where toxic substances could be stored without further effect on the body
and that functioned as a kind of excretory system could
have been the prerequisite for employing these structures

as defensive devices. To solve this question, thorough
phylogenetic analyses are needed. Tracing toxic substances from the food into the different organs or glands
by histochemistry or new analytical methods like
aptameres will help to understand the tasks of these
glands, and their role as excretory or as defensive organs,
or as pheromone-producing organs involved in reproduction and development. Additional field and laboratory
experiments with potential predators from the natural
surroundings are necessary to understand the functioning
of chemicals in the slugs.

Methods
Material collection
About 300 different species of Opisthobranchia have been
collected and investigated by the authors in the past 20
years. Collecting was performed from the intertidal (e.g.
Australia, Helgoland), to the sublitoral zones (e.g. Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic, tropical waters in the Red
Sea, Australia and others) down to depth of 1000 m (Antarctica). Collecting techniques comprised hand collecting
in the intertidal and while diving, or using trawls, like the
Agassiz trawl in Polar Seas. Specimens were preserved in 4
– 10 % formaldehyde/seawater for histological investigations, or 96% ethanol for molecular investigations.
Investigation techniques
Investigation of morphology and anatomy was performed
by macroscopical and histological techniques. For histological investigations, entire animals (when small in size)
or parts of the animals were embedded in hydroxyethylmethacrylate for serial sectioning (2 µm). Sections were
stained with toluidine blue and investigated by lightmicroscopy. Toluidine blue stains acid mucopolysaccharides in various shades of red to violet, whereas neutral
mucopolysaccharides are staining in blue colours. Observation of living animals aided the understanding of external characters and life strategies. Data used for the
phylogeny comprise 79 taxa and 110 characters based on
morphology and histology. Polarity of characters was
obtained by outgroup comparison with Littorina littorea.
Due to some trivial characters, an all-zero outgroup was
chosen. The characters are explained in full detail by
Wägele & Klussmann-Kolb (in prep). Analyses were performed by PAUP 4.0 beta 3a (Swofford, 1999) [65].
Parameters of maximum parsimony analyses were:
ACCTRAN, all characters unordered and unweighted;
heuristic search options: stepwise addition = random,
branch-swapping option = TBR.
