Abstract
Background: Anesthetic-induced CNS depression is thought to involve reduction of glutamate
release from nerve terminals. Recent studies suggest that isoflurane reduces glutamate release by
block of Na channels. To further investigate this question we examined the actions of isoflurane,
TTX, extracellular Ca2+, CNQX and stimulus voltage (stim) on glutamate-mediated transmission
at hippocampal excitatory synapses. EPSPs were recorded from CA1 neurons in rat hippocampal
brain slices in response to Schaffer-collateral fiber stimulation.
Results: Isoflurane (350 µM; 1 MAC) reversibly depressed EPSP amplitudes by ~60% while
facilitation increased ~20%. Consistent with previous studies, these results indicate a presynaptic
site of action that involves reduced excitation-release coupling. EPSPs were depressed to
comparable levels by TTX (60 nM) or lowered stim, but facilitation was not changed, indicating a
simple failure of axonal conduction. Similarly, partial antagonism of postsynaptic glutamate
receptors with CNQX (10 µM) depressed EPSP amplitudes with no change in facilitation. However,
EPSP depression by low external Ca2+ (0.8 mM) was accompanied by an increase in facilitation
comparable to isoflurane. Isoflurane depression of EPSP amplitudes could also be partly reversed
by high external Ca2+ (4 mM) that also decreased facilitation. Isoflurane or low Ca2+ markedly
reduced the slopes of fiber volley (FV)-EPSP input-output curves, consistent with little or no effect
on FVs. By contrast, TTX didn't alter the FV-EPSP curve slope, indicating that EPSP depression
resulted from FV depression. FVs were remarkably resistant to isoflurane. Somatic spike currents
were unaffected by 350 µM (1 MAC) isoflurane as well. The EC50 for isoflurane depression of FVs
was ~2.8 mM (12 vol. %; 8 MAC).
Conclusion: Isoflurane appears to depress CA1 synapses at presynaptic sites downstream from
Na channels, as evident by the increased facilitation that accompanies EPSP depression. Fiber
volleys did not exhibit depression by isoflurane, as has been reported for other brain regions.

Background
A longstanding controversy in the anesthesia literature
concerns whether general anesthetics exert their actions
primarily by depression of synaptic transmission or by

blocking nerve conduction like local anesthetics. Thesleff
[1] first proposed that general and local anesthetics share
a common mechanism to block Na conductance [cf. [24]]. Alternatively, other early studies yielded evidence that

volatile anesthetics preferentially depress synaptic potentials rather than axonal conduction [5,6]. At present, most
studies of volatile anesthetic molecular targets are directed
toward synaptic ligand-gated ion channels, as these sites
appear more sensitive to volatile anesthetics than voltagegated channels [7]. However, other studies have shown
that volatile anesthetics depress axonal conduction or
block voltage-gated Na channels. Berg-Johnsen and Langmoen [8] reported that 1 MAC isoflurane (1.5 vol. %) produced an 18% depression of fiber volley amplitudes
recorded from small unmyelinated fibers in the hippocampal CA1 region. More recently, Mikulec et al. [9]
reported that 1 MAC halothane depressed Schaffer-collateral axon fiber volleys by 18%. These findings and others
support a presynaptic action of volatile anesthetics to
depress axonal excitability.
Glutamatergic synapses are of particular interest with
regard to anesthetic mechanisms. These excitatory synapses are distributed across the neural axis and are especially abundant in telencephalic structures such as
hippocampus and cortex [10,11]. Volatile anesthetics
have long been recognized to depress glutamatergic neurotransmission, with evidence for both pre- and postsynaptic sites of action, including actions to depress
excitability [12-14]. Some specialized glutamatergic synapses have enabled investigators to specifically look at
anesthetic actions in electrically isolated presynaptic
structures. Wu et al. [15] reported that isoflurane at clinical concentrations produced small reductions in spike
amplitudes in the calyx of Held. The nonlinearities in coupling of excitability to Ca2+ influx and vesicle fusion produced a proportionally larger action of isoflurane to
reduce transmitter release. Ouyang et al. [16] found that
isoflurane inhibited Na channels in isolated neurohypophyseal nerve terminals. In addition, Sandstrom [17]
reported that isoflurane reduced presynaptic excitability
in the phylogenetically distant larval Drosophila glutamatergic neuromuscular junction – an effect that is also consistent with Na channel inhibition.
We sought to address the question of whether isoflurane
inhibits voltage-gated Na channels to depress glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Earlier investigations found that isoflurane depressed glutamate
release from synaptosomes by inhibiting voltage-gated Ca
channels [18], although P/Q and N-type Ca channels
don't appear to be directly targeted [19,20]. Volatile anesthetics may directly act on presynaptic Na channels to
depress neurotransmission. Studies in the hippocampus
will help to ascertain whether volatile anesthetics generally inhibit Na+ conductance in the CNS or if this action is
more specifically associated with the specialized synapses
where it has been best documented [15,16].

Results
Tetrodotoxin depresses neurotransmission without effect
on facilitation
Fiber volley (FV) and EPSP amplitudes were measured
with a minimum-to-baseline (MTB) algorithm and compared with a measure of the rate of change for the initial
waveform slope (dV/dt). Figure 1A shows an averaged
EPSP with the two methods represented by dashed lines
(MTB) and solid lines (dV/dt, slopes). The two measures
were compared for variability by linear fits when plotted
as functions of the stimulus voltage over a 3 V range (Fig.
1A, right panels). In both cases the data obtained by the
MTB algorithm had a higher correlation coefficient than
the slope data, especially at low voltages as in the case of
FVs. This trend is also evident in Fig. 1A, (lower left) that
shows a greater scatter of slope measurements at lower
stimulus voltages at the start and end of the experiment.
Facilitation was plotted in the same panel (solid line) and
remained constant across large changes in EPSP amplitudes.

Isoflurane produced a reversible depression of EPSP
amplitudes, accompanied by an increase in facilitation as
previously reported [12,21,22]. Figure 1B shows the time
course of a typical experiment in which 350 µM isoflurane
(1.5 vol %; 1 MAC) depressed EPSP amplitudes. The conditioning (1st) EPSP was depressed by ~60%. The test
EPSP (2nd) was depressed by a smaller amount, which
increased facilitation by ~20% (n = 5). The actions of isoflurane on glutamatergic neurotransmission follow the
same pattern as when extracellular Ca2+ is reduced from 2
mM to 0.8 mM (Fig. 1C). Low external Ca2+ depressed
both conditioning and test EPSPs while facilitation
increased. By contrast, TTX (60 nM; Fig. 1D) depressed
EPSPs to about the same level as isoflurane or low Ca2+,
however TTX did not change facilitation.
Isoflurane depressed glutamatergic EPSPs over a wide
range of stimulus voltages (Fig. 2A). EPSPs uniformly
decreased in amplitude after exposure of the slice to 350
µM isoflurane (inset). Figure 2A (right) shows the relation
between FV and EPSP amplitudes. FV-EPSP relations were
obtained over a 5 V stimulus range in 0.2 V increments.
The results show isoflurane depressed EPSPs independently of the FV amplitudes (Fig. 2A, right). Isoflurane
shifted the apparent slope of the FV-EPSP relation (Fig.
2A, blue circles), which would be expected for depression
of EPSP amplitudes with no or little action on FV amplitudes. This trend was also observed for experiments with
reduced external Ca2+ (0.8 mM) in which EPSPs were
reduced in amplitude and the FV-EPSP slope was shifted
in a similar manner (Fig. 2B). However, the FV-EPSP relation obtained with TTX (60 nM) was entirely dependent
on FV amplitudes (Fig. 2C). While EPSPs were depressed
by TTX, the FV-EPSP slope relation in the presence of TTX

release coupling. On the other hand CNQX, an AMPA/
kainate receptor antagonist, also reduced the FV-EPSP
slope, presumably by a postsynaptic action. Reduction of
the stimulus voltage by 50% left the FV-EPSP slope
unchanged, which is consistent with an exclusively axonal
action and comparable to TTX treatment (Fig. 3, middle
panel).
Isoflurane significantly increased paired-pulse facilitation
(p < 0.001) as did low Ca2+ (p < 0.001) when compared
with TTX (ANOVA, Fig. 3, lower panel). By comparison,
facilitation was largely unaffected by 10 µM CNQX or
reduced stimulus voltage. Isoflurane (350 µM) depressed
the first EPSP by about the same amount as when external
Ca2+ was reduced to 0.8 mM (Fig. 3, top panel, no significant difference, ANOVA, n = 6). However, in the same
experiments (Fig. 3, lower panel), isoflurane's action to
enhance facilitation was significantly less than low Ca2+ (p
< 0.001, ANOVA, n = 6). Because facilitation is increased
when synaptic release probability is reduced [23,24], the
actions of isoflurane appear to involve additional sites
besides those related to excitation-release coupling or
Ca2+ ion influx.

was unchanged (Fig. 2C, right) since all of the EPSP
depression produced by TTX was due to depression of FV
inputs.
Figure 3 shows the results of these experiments summarized in a bar graph. Also shown are experiments involving perfusion with 10 µM CNQX or reduced stimulus
voltage. The FV-EPSP slope (middle panel) was reduced
significantly by isoflurane and low external Ca2+ compared with TTX (p < 0.001 in each case, ANOVA). Depression of FV-EPSP slopes suggests an effect on excitation-

Partial reversal of isoflurane depression of EPSPs by high
external calcium
Since low external Ca2+ produced a depressant effect like
isoflurane on glutamatergic neurotransmission, we were
interested in whether raising external Ca2+ would reverse
the actions of isoflurane. We recorded EPSPs during perfusion of isoflurane in ACSF with high Ca2+ (4 mM). Figure 4 shows that isoflurane depression of the first EPSP
was reversed in high Ca2+ ACSF. The reversal was significant (Fig. 4, lower left). However, isoflurane delivered in
high Ca2+ ACSF still exerted a depressant action on the second EPSP and facilitation was significantly decreased
from isoflurane in standard ACSF (Fig. 4, lower right).
Minimal fiber volley and somatic Na spike depression by
isoflurane
Fiber volleys represent a summation of many action
potentials that arrive at the CA1 region following Schaffer
collateral stimulation. Due to the difficulty of patching
nerve terminal fibers to study action potentials directly,
we decided to study isoflurane actions on somatic Na currents recorded from whole cell patches on cells in the CA1
pyramidal cell layer. The perforated patch method
allowed us to reliably obtain access to the cell interior
while patching blind [25]. Currents were activated by a
voltage step to -30 mV from a holding potential of -70
mV. A 100 ms depolarizing pulse was delivered every 10
s. Representative currents in Fig. 5, left show a decrease in
amplitude and a slight delay after a 15 minute exposure of
the slice to 60 nM TTX. In a separate experiment, currents
recorded 10 minutes after exposure to 350 µM isoflurane

were indistinguishable from controls (Fig. 5, right). These
results are in general agreement with our field recording
experiments, although somatic Na channels may have different properties than those in terminal fibers.
Because fiber volleys are partially occluded by EPSPs (Fig.
6A), the dose-dependent action of isoflurane on fiber vol-

leys was investigated following block of glutamate receptors with 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; NMDA
receptor blocker, 125 µM) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; AMPA/kainate receptor blocker,
8.6 µM). This treatment eliminated EPSPs leaving only
FVs (Fig. 6A, lower panel). Observable block of FVs only
became apparent with high (3 vol %) or supraclinical (5
vol %) isoflurane (Fig. 6C). At these concentrations isoflurane produced a reduction of FV amplitudes in a manner
comparable to, but not as great as 60 nM TTX (Fig 6B). FV
amplitudes were depressed in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 6D) with an EC50 of ~2.8 mM (12 vol. %; 8 MAC)
estimated from a least-squares fit extrapolation. But at
clinical levels, 350 µM (1 MAC) isoflurane only depressed
FV amplitudes by 1.2 ± 4.3% (n = 8). This is in contrast to
the volatile anesthetic halothane, which depressed FV
amplitudes by ~18% at 1 MAC [9], using identical recording conditions.

Discussion
Volatile anesthetics are known to depress glutamatergic
synaptic transmission, although the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Wu et al. [15] reported that isoflurane
inhibited presynaptic action potentials in the calyx of

Held to reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission. We were
interested in further study of the presynaptic action of isoflurane, as Wu et al. [15] did not compare isoflurane and
TTX effects, nor did they look at effects on facilitation. To
test the generality of isoflurane depression of action
potentials, we studied the effects of isoflurane in comparison with TTX on EPSPs in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus and on FVs recorded from presynaptic
Schaffer-collateral fibers. TTX blocks all brain Na channels, including those in the calyx of Held [26,27]. We
found that clinical concentrations of isoflurane had little
to no inhibitory action on FV amplitudes, although EPSPs
were strongly depressed and facilitation was increased.
Somatic Na currents were also unaffected by 350 µM isoflurane. On the other hand, TTX reduced FV amplitudes
and EPSP amplitudes but had no effect on facilitation.
TTX also had no effect on the slope of the FV-EPSP relation. The actions of TTX likely resulted in part from nerve
fiber conduction block. Fewer conducting fibers would
reduce responsiveness to the stimulating electrode and
account for the similar actions of TTX and reduced stimulus voltage on paired-pulse facilitation and the FV-EPSP
relation (Fig. 3). TTX could also reduce Na spike amplitudes and decrease fiber conduction velocity [28] (Fig.
6B).
Unlike TTX, isoflurane at clinical concentrations doesn't
appear to inhibit Na channel activity in hippocampal
Schaffer-collateral fibers. Depression of EPSPs and
enhancement of facilitation by isoflurane likely results
from actions downstream from Na channels at sites that
contribute more directly to excitation-release coupling, as

(Fig. 2).
Fiber volleys in Schaffer collateral fibers represent a summation of closely-timed multiple action potentials. Their
close temporal coordination is reflected by the short duration of the fiber volley, which is typically about 5–8 ms.

FV-EPSP relations typically show an asymptotic decrease
at higher FV amplitudes (Fig. 2, right panels), which contrasts to the accelerating relation of the action potential –
EPSC relation in the calyx of Held [15]. However, Wu et al
[15] obtained their EPSC data by use of a scaled action
potential as a voltage command while we obtained EPSP
data by changing the stimulus voltage. Our methodology
reflects an experimental focus on the properties of a population of synapses, with results that show a broad insensitivity of terminal fiber Na channels to isoflurane. Further
study is needed at individual CA1 synapses to determine
whether a subpopulation may be more sensitive to conduction block by isoflurane.

It is important to note that not all volatile anesthetics may
target the same molecular sites. Our results with isoflurane differ from the reported actions of halothane on synaptic transmission. Like isoflurane, halothane depresses
EPSP amplitudes in rat hippocampal slices at clinical concentrations [13]. However, halothane also depresses
Schaffer-collateral axon fiber volley amplitudes [9].
Unlike TTX, halothane has no effect on conduction velocity but does increase facilitation of EPSPs [9]. While the
dissimilar pharmacological profiles for halothane and
isoflurane are inconsistent with a unitary model of
anesthesia, both can be understood within a multi-site
model of volatile anesthetic action [38-40].

Elevated external Ca2+ reversed isoflurane depression of
the first EPSP. This is likely related to the enhanced release
of transmitter by increased Ca2+ influx during nerve terminal depolarization. Elevated external Ca2+ may also
enhance NMDA receptor currents. However, this contribution to the EPSP is likely to be small, as the proportion
of the NMDA receptor current carried by Ca2+ is fractional,
e.g. 17% of the total NR1/NR2A current [29].

The weak depressant action of isoflurane on Schaffer-collateral FVs indicates that presynaptic actions of isoflurane
are not homogeneous in the brain – especially when contrasted to the results reported by Ouyang et al. [16] and
Wu et al. [15]. Furthermore, Baudoux et al [35], who studied Ca2+ transients in CA1 pyramidal cell axons, concluded that general anesthetics are unlikely to interfere
with action potential propagation even in fine axon collaterals. Factors that could affect regional variability in
action potential depression include the degree of terminal
fiber myelination [cf. [8]; although see [5]] as well as the
diversity of voltage-gated Na channel expression and subcellular distribution [41]. Five TTX-sensitive Na channel
α-subunits have been reported to be expressed in hippocampal neurons: NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.3, NaV1.6 and
NaV1.7 [42], with complex patterns of expression even
between different neurons. On the other hand, Leão et al.
[27] reported that Na channels are absent from the calyx
of Held. Their immunocytochemical data show NaV1.6
but not NaV1.2 was expressed at the axonal heminodes
from which action potentials passively invade the calyx
[27,43]. These data taken together suggest that the expression pattern of Na channel α-subunits in neurons can
influence anesthetic sensitivity. In addition, α-subunits
are frequently associated with a β1 subunit that can modulate Na channel gating [44]. So it appears that there are
numerous possible isoforms of Na channels that are
expressed heterogeneously in the CNS. The degree to
which these isoforms differ with respect to volatile anesthetic sensitivity is presently unknown.

Voltage-gated P/Q type Ca channels are localized at synaptic terminals in many central neurons [30], including
the mature calyx of Held where they closely associate with
synaptic vesicles [31] and appear to have an important
role in paired-pulse facilitation [32]. High external [Ca2+]
will increase Ca2+ influx when Ca channels open in
response to depolarization. The result would likely
increase the synaptic release probability [33] and tend to
reduce facilitation, as we observed (Fig. 4). While P/Q Ca
channels are not strongly inhibited by volatile anesthetics
[19] there remains the possibility that volatile anesthetics
may reduce calcium-induced calcium release from internal stores, as described in dendrites of hippocampal
pyramidal cells [34] and suggested as an anesthetic mechanism for pentobarbitone [35].
Another possible site includes the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex. The SNARE complex is involved in vesicle docking
and fusion at most synapses. Disruption of SNARE proteins with Botulinum toxins A and F can each reduce the
initial release probability. However, Botox F doesn't produce facilitation unless external [Ca2+] is lowered [36].
Our results showing partial reversal of isoflurane effects
on neurotransmission with high external [Ca2+] suggest
the SNARE complex may warrant further study as targets
of volatile anesthetics. In fact, isoflurane and halothane
have recently been reported to bind to syntaxin and the
SNARE complex at clinical concentrations [37], although
the binding sites on the SNARE proteins have not yet been
characterized.

Conclusion
We conclude that for glutamatergic hippocampal neurons, isoflurane depresses transmission downstream from
Na channels. Unlike TTX, isoflurane simultaneously
increased facilitation and depressed EPSPs with only a
minimal reduction of fiber volley amplitudes. Consistent
with previous studies, a likely mechanism of isoflurane
action is to reduce presynaptic Ca2+ levels following nerve
terminal depolarization and/or to disrupt the vesicle
release process.

Methods
The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at Stanford University and
adhered to the published guidelines of the NIH, the Society for Neuroscience and The American Physiological
Society. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with
diethyl ether (22 vol. % in air). The animals were killed by
decapitation. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in
ice-cold (5°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) that
was pre-gassed with carbogen (95%-O2/5%-CO2). The
ACSF had the following composition (in mM): 124 NaCl,
3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4,
and 10 D-glucose. Whole brain coronal slices (400 µm)
were cut with a Vibratome Model 1500 (Technical Products International, Inc., O'Fallon, MO). The brain slices
were equilibrated for at least one hour at room temperature (22°C) in a humidified chamber partially filled with
ACSF and continually bubbled with carbogen. Individual
slices were transferred to a recording chamber, submerged
in ACSF and equilibrated for an additional 10 minutes
prior to electrophysiological recording. All experiments
were conducted at room temperature. Brain slices were
continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF at a flow
rate of ~1.5 ml/min.
The inhalation anesthetic isoflurane was mixed with carrier gas (95%-O2/5%-CO2) in a calibrated commercial
vaporizer (Fluotec 3, Fraser Harlake, Orchard Park, NY)
and bubbled into the ACSF reservoir that perfused the
brain slices. This system has been previously calibrated for
delivery of volatile anesthetics [45]. In some experiments
the perfusion solution included 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; NMDA receptor blocker, 125 µM) and
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; AMPA/
Kainate receptor blocker, 8.6 µM) to block EPSPs.
Bipolar tungsten microelectrodes were placed on Schaffercollateral fibers to electrically stimulate inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Glass micropipettes (Garner Glass, Claremont, CA) were pulled with a resistance of
2–5 MΩ, filled with ACSF and placed in stratum radiatum
to record stimulus-evoked fiber volleys and excitatory
postsynaptic potentials. Paired stimulus pulses (3–6 V,
300 µs duration; 80 ms interpulse interval) were delivered
by a Grass stimulation isolation unit from a two-channel
stimulator at a stimulus rate of 0.05 Hz. The field potentials were amplified, low-pass filtered at 20 kHz and sampled at 25 µs.

responses were normalized as a percent of control, based
on average amplitudes from a 20 min recording immediately before drug perfusion. We used InStat 3 (GraphPad
Software, Inc.) to compare anesthetic effects between
groups of time-matched experiments (two-way analysis of
variance; ANOVA).
Perforated patch recordings
Whole cell currents were recorded from patches in the
pyramidal cell body layer of the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. Slices were perfused with ACSF as described
above. Patch electrodes were pulled from Garner KG-33
glass. The recording micropipette resistances ranged from
4–6 MΩ and seal resistances ranged from 1–5 GΩ. The
patch electrode-filling solution contained (in mM) 140
potassium gluconate, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 0.10
CaCl2, 2 Na2-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP (pH 7.4; free Ca2+ ~100
nM). To obtain perforated patches, a stock solution of 100
mM amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was
prepared in DMSO and stored at -20°C. The stock solution was diluted (1/1000) into the pipette solution and
sonicated for ~30 s to obtain a final amphotericin B concentration of 100 µM. Before seal formation, the voltage
offset between the patch electrode and the bath solution
was adjusted to produce zero current. Whole cell currents
were recorded with an Axon Instruments MultiClamp
700A amplifier and PClamp software (Molecular Devices,
Union City, CA). All experiments were performed at room
temperature (~21–23°C).

All responses were measured with DataWave or PClamp
software and analyzed with IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake
Oswego, OR). Fiber volley and EPSP amplitudes were
measured from peak negative voltage to baseline (minimum-to-baseline) or alternatively, their initial slopes
were measured between 20% and 80% of minimum. All
