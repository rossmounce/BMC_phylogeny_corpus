Abstract
An infectious bronchitis virus Arkansas DPI (Ark DPI) virulent strain was sequenced, analyzed and
compared with many different IBV strains and coronaviruses. The genome of Ark DPI consists of
27,620 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and comprises ten open reading frames. Comparative
sequence analysis of Ark DPI with other IBV strains shows striking similarity to the Conn, Gray,
JMK, and Ark 99, which were circulating during that time period. Furthermore, comparison of the
Ark genome with other coronaviruses demonstrates a close relationship to turkey coronavirus.
Among non-structural genes, the 5'untranslated region (UTR), 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and the
polymerase (RdRp) sequences are 100% identical to the Gray strain. Among structural genes, S1
has 97% identity with Ark 99; S2 has 100% identity with JMK and 96% to Conn; 3b 99%, and 3C to
N is 100% identical to Conn strain. Possible recombination sites were found at the intergenic
region of spike gene, 3'end of S1 and 3a gene. Independent recombination events may have
occurred in the entire genome of Ark DPI, involving four different IBV strains, suggesting that
genomic RNA recombination may occur in any part of the genome at number of sites. Hence, we
speculate that the Ark DPI strain originated from the Conn strain, but diverged and evolved
independently by point mutations and recombination between field strains.

Findings
Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a pathogen of
domestic chickens that causes acute, highly contagious
respiratory disease [1]. IBV is a member of the Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [2] and its genome consists of a 27.6
kb single stranded positive-sense RNA molecule that
encodes for four structural proteins; the spike (S) glycoprotein, the small envelope (E) protein, the membrane
(M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [3,4].

Six subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed from the IBV
genome in virus-infected cells. The mRNA 1 contains two
large overlapping open reading frames, encoding two
polyproteins 1a and 1b [5], among which 1b is produced
as 1ab polyprotein by ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism [6].
Many serotypes have been described for IBV, probably
due to the frequent point mutations that occur in RNA

viruses and also due to recombination events demonstrated for IBV [7-9]. For this reason, the characterization
of virus isolates existing in the field is very important. The
Ark DPI strain was first isolated from Delmarva Peninsula
broiler flock [10,11] and it is currently being used as a vaccine in the USA and Europe. In this study, we characterized the entire genome of virulent Ark DPI strain (embryo
passage 11) and compared it with other IBV strains and
coronaviruses from all over the world.
The Ark DPI virus was inoculated into 9-day-old SPF
chicken eggs and allantoic fluid was collected 72 h post
inoculation. The fluid was clarified by low speed centrifugation and clear supernatant was stored at -80°C.
Genomic RNA was extracted from virus-infected allantoic
fluid with Qiagen RNAeasy kit, following the manufacturer's instructions, and stored at -80°C until further use.
Oligonucleotides were designed based on consensus
sequence of the following IBV strains: Cal 99 [GenBank:AY514485], Mass 41 [GenBank:AY851295] and BJ
[GenBank:AY319651]. Overlapping primers were
designed in a manner such that each pair of primer covered approximately two kb of genome. The RT-PCR was
carried out as described earlier [12] and the RT-PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen, CA). Plasmid DNA from various clones was
sequenced by dideoxy chain termination method, using
an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA).
Three independent clones were sequenced for each amplicon to exclude errors that can occur from RT and PCR reactions. The assembly of contiguous sequences and multiple
sequence alignments were performed with the GeneDoc
software [13]. The pair-wise nucleotide identity and comparative sequence analyses were conducted using Vector
NTI Advance 10 software (Invitrogen, CA) and BLAST
search, NCBI. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted
using the MEGA4 program [14].
The GenBank accession number for the Ark DPI sequence
is EU418976. The complete genomes of following strains
are obtained from GenBank: TCoVMG10, NC_010800;

The genome of Ark DPI consists of 27,620 nucleotides
(nts), excluding poly (A) tail, and comprises ten open
reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5' (528 nts) and 3' (507
nts) untranslated regions (UTRs). The genome organization is ORF1ab (529–20360), ORF2 (20311–23820),
ORF3abc [3a, (23820–23993), 3b (23993–24187), 3c
(24168–24491)], ORF4 (24469–25140), ORF5ab [5a
(25500–25697), 5b (25694–25942)] and ORF6 (25885–
27114).
The details of genome organization of Ark DPI are shown
in Fig. 1. IBV polyprotein is cleaved into 15 cleavage products, among which first two N-terminal products are
cleaved by PLpro and rest of the C-terminal products are
cleaved by 3CLpro [15]. The putative domains and their
cleavage sites (Fig. 1) are predicted by comparison of
amino acid sequences of each non-structural protein
(nsp) of Ark DPI with those of IBV-Beaudette which is
available in Coronavirus Database (CoVDB) [16]. The
nucleotide and the amino acid identity of Ark DPI with
other IBVs and coronaviruses are listed in Tables 1, 2, 3.
The whole structural gene of Jilin is 100% identical to Ark
DPI, which suggests that Jilin strain is actually Ark DPI,
which is currently used as a vaccine in China [17]. The
whole genome comparison of IBV strains reveals a close
relationship of Ark DPI with Cal 99 (96% identity), as
shown in Fig. 2. Earlier studies have shown that Cal 99
probably evolved from Ark DPI [18].
The complete genome sequence analysis of Ark DPI strain
shows striking similarity to the Conn, Gray, JMK, and Ark
99 IBV strains, which were circulating during that time
period [1,19-21]. The 5'UTR, PLpro, Mpro and RdRp
sequence analysis demonstrates that Ark DPI is 100%
identical to Gray strain, except for PLpro which has 87%
identity, as shown in Table 1. It was suggested that PLpro

gene has high genetic variation because of selection pressure [22]. From this analysis, it appears that genetic mutation may have occurred at PLpro gene level. The modern
strain GA98 maintains 100% identity with Ark DPI in replicase proteins and because of unavailability of sequence
information for rest of the genome; we speculate that
GA98 may be a derivative of the Ark DPI strain.
Analysis of the structural region of Ark DPI clearly demonstrates that it is a chimera of three strains. The S1 gene of
Ark DPI is probably derived from Ark 99 (97% identical)
and because of genetic mutations in the S1 region, Ark
DPI may have evolved independently. There is an A-T rich
sequence TGTGTTGATTATAAT (Fig. 3) at the 3'terminus
of S1 gene (~300 nts upstream from the end of S1 gene)
which is conserved among most of the IBV strains. The S1
gene of Ark 99 maintains its identity with Ark DPI up to
this conserved region, but from this point onwards to the
end of S2, the nucleotide sequence is 100% identical to
JMK strain. The recombination between JMK and Ark 99
had taken place presumably between above mentioned
conserved region and intergenic (IG) region of S gene,

which is located 49 nts upstream of start codon of S gene.
It is speculated that IG sequences serve as "hot spots" for
recombination because of its consensus nature [23]. Gray
and JMK strains share 99% homology both in the S1 and
S2 genes of Ark DPI, but JMK shows greater identity than
Gray strain, as shown in Table 2. It is interesting that very
few residues in the S1 gene make the Gray strain nephrotropic, whereas JMK is pneumotropic [24].
Out of 174 nts of gene 3a of Ark DPI, last 74 nts are 100%
identical to Conn, whereas first 100 nts are only 86%
identical. Even though it is not clear whether the 5'-end of
3a was derived from Conn or JMK, but it is evident that
the recombination event may have occurred between JMK
and Conn at gene 3a. The 3b gene of Ark DPI and Conn
differed only by two nucleotides and both share 99%
identity, suggesting that 3b belongs to Conn strain. From
gene 3c to N gene, Ark DPI shares 100% identity with
Conn. It is obvious that the entire structural genome,
except spike, belongs to Conn strain. Cross protection
studies carried out by Gelb and coworkers [11] demonstrated that the birds immunized with Ark DPI showed

95%, 90% and 63% protection against Conn, Ark 99 and
JMK strains, respectively. Indeed, these results suggest that
major part of Ark DPI genome was derived from Conn.
The level of protection for JMK is 80%, when Ark 99 was
used as immunogen [25]. On the other hand, Conn and
JMK immunization induces inadequate immunity against
Ark-type IBV challenge, suggesting that Ark cross-immunity to JMK and Conn is a one-way relationship
[10,11,26].
Recombination hot spots have been demonstrated for IBV
isolates by many researchers. These hot spots have been
detected in the IG region [23], S1 gene [27], 3' terminus of
S2, N and between N gene and 3'UTR [8,28]. Some earlier

sequencing studies had provided circumstantial evidence
of recombination events in field isolates of IBV [7,29,30].
More or less recombination sites were detected over the
entire genome of coronavirus [31]. Based on these results,
we speculate that the Ark DPI strain originated from the
Conn strain, but diverged and evolved independently by
point mutations and recombination between field strains.
These findings suggest that there is high level of genetic
diversity among currently circulating IBV serotypes. Most
of them come from genetic changes which already exist in
the IBV field strains and from IBV live vaccines. So frequent monitoring is highly essential to track the emergence of new variants and is mandatory to develop
efficient vaccination strategies to control and prevent IB.

Schematic presentation of the structural region of Ark DPI
Schematic presentation of the structural region of
Ark DPI genome. Entire genome of Ark DPI was analyzed
for its similarity with other IBV strains. Top panel: 5'UTR &
ORF1. Shadowed regions were used for comparative analysis. 5'UTR-5'-untranslated region; PL1-papain like
proteinase1; Mpro-main or 3C-like proteinase; RdRp-RNAdependent-RNA polymerase. Bottom panel: ORF2 to 3'UTR.
Structural genes and their ORFs are marked by (●). Conserved sequence TGTGTTGATTATAAT in S1 gene is
shown; ᭜ denotes plausible recombination site in Ark DPI.
