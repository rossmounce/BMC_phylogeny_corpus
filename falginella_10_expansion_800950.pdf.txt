Abstract
Background: Flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylases (F3’5’Hs) and flavonoid 3’-hydroxylases (F3’Hs) competitively control the
synthesis of delphinidin and cyanidin, the precursors of blue and red anthocyanins. In most plants, F3’5’H genes are
present in low-copy number, but in grapevine they are highly redundant.
Results: The first increase in F3’5’H copy number occurred in the progenitor of the eudicot clade at the time of
the g triplication. Further proliferation of F3’5’Hs has occurred in one of the paleologous loci after the separation of
Vitaceae from other eurosids, giving rise to 15 paralogues within 650 kb. Twelve reside in 9 tandem blocks of
~35-55 kb that share 91-99% identity. The second paleologous F3’5’H has been maintained as an orphan gene in
grapevines, and lacks orthologues in other plants. Duplicate F3’5’Hs have spatially and temporally partitioned
expression profiles in grapevine. The orphan F3’5’H copy is highly expressed in vegetative organs. More recent
duplicate F3’5’Hs are predominately expressed in berry skins. They differ only slightly in the coding region, but are
distinguished in the structure of the promoter. Differences in cis-regulatory sequences of promoter regions are
paralleled by temporal specialisation of gene transcription during fruit ripening. Variation in anthocyanin profiles
consistently reflects changes in the F3’5’H mRNA pool across different cultivars. More F3’5’H copies are expressed at
high levels in grapevine varieties with 93-94% of 3’5’-OH anthocyanins. In grapevines depleted in 3’5’-OH
anthocyanins (15-45%), fewer F3’5’H copies are transcribed, and at lower levels. Conversely, only two copies of the
gene encoding the competing F3’H enzyme are present in the grape genome; one copy is expressed in both
vegetative and reproductive organs at comparable levels among cultivars, while the other is transcriptionally silent.
Conclusions: These results suggest that expansion and subfunctionalisation of F3’5’Hs have increased the
complexity and diversification of the fruit colour phenotype among red grape varieties.

Background
Flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylases (F3’5’Hs) and flavonoid
3’-hydroxylases (F3’Hs) are versatile enzymes that accept
several phenylpropanoid substrates [1]. Of particular
interest for anthocyanin pigmentation is the 3’,5’- or
3’-hydroxylation of naringenin and dihydrokaempferol.
F3’5’Hs and F3’Hs compete for substrate recruitment
and deliver their 3’5’- or 3’-OH products into the parallel synthesis of delphinidin and cyanidin [2], the precursors of blue and red anthocyanins in grape berries,
respectively. Variation in anthocyanin profile within and

between grape varieties is associated with differences in
the ratio of F3’5’H to F3’H expression [3,4].
Anthocyanin biosynthesis takes place over 8-10 weeks,
from shortly after berry softening (~60 days after
blooming) until harvest [5]. F3’Hs are expressed at comparable levels in both anthocyanin-pigmented and
green-skinned varieties, before and after the onset of
ripening [6,4]. However, regulation of F3’5’Hs is largely
genotype-specific and responsive to environmental cues
[3,7]. The breadth of diversity in fruit colour among different grapevine accessions suggests a fine regulation of
F3’5’H expression. Dark blue cultivars transcribe F3’5’Hs
at higher levels than light red cultivars, which nevertheless maintain traces of 3’5’-OH anthocyanins and barely
detectable F3’5’H transcripts. In green-skinned cultivars,
F3’5’H transcripts are completely absent [8,9]. The

invariant presence of some 3’5’-OH anthocyanins in red
pigmented grapes contrasts with many other flowering
plants such as roses, carnations, chrysanthemums, lilies,
gerbera, and Arabidopsis, which accumulate anthocyanins but do not synthesise 3’5’-OH derivatives.
The lack of grapevines with F3’5’H loss-of-function
genotypes could be explained either by selection, which
acted against knockout mutations, or by gene redundancy, which obscured the effect of single-gene loss/
silencing. The observation that an absence of 3’5’-OH
anthocyanins is generally tolerated in plants disfavours
the first hypothesis. Furthermore, gene redundancy of
F3’5’Hs is commonplace in grape genomes [10,11], contrasting with most other species that have single or twocopy F3’5’Hs, or none at all. We have previously shown
that F3’5’Hs are highly duplicated, with multiple copies
arrayed in clustered contigs of the ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’
physical map [10]. The genome assembly of the nearlyhomozygous line PN40024 [12] allows a deeper investigation into the structure of the F3’5’H locus and into
the evolutionary events that caused their proliferation in
grapevine.
Expansion of gene families is common in plant genomes [13], and results from various mechanisms of
duplication: whole-genome duplication (WGD), segmental duplication, tandem duplication, and transpositional
duplication [14,15]. WGDs have repeatedly occurred
over evolutionary time in the common ancestor of eudicots and in specific lineages [12,16]. Segmental duplications occur over chromosomal regions, which may
undergo subsequent rearrangement. Tandem duplications generate nearby gene copies [13]. Small-scale
duplications may also cause transposition of one of the
duplicate genes to an ectopic site. In this paper, local
duplications of small fragments (<10 kb) containing a
single gene are referred to as tandem duplications.
Duplication of DNA blocks >10 kb are referred to as
segmental duplications.
Retention of duplicate genes results from a stochastic
process, in which the effect of the earliest mutation
occurring after duplication governs the fate of extra
copies. Deleterious mutations occur much more frequently than mutations resulting in novel and favourable
functions [17]. Following this assumption, gene disruption would largely prevail, with genomes populated by
vestiges of ancient duplicates. This raises the question as
to why intact duplicates are maintained and expressed
much more frequently than expected by chance. According to the duplication-degeneration-complementation
(DDC) model [18], degenerative mutations promote preservation of duplicate genes. Deleterious mutations in
regulatory regions could eliminate different cis-elements
in either duplicate, making both copies necessary to provide the full-complement of the expression profile of the

Page 2 of 18

ancestral single copy [19]. This kind of partitioned
expression among duplicate genes is referred to as subfunctionalisation, and includes differential expression
among organs and developmental stages, or in response
to environmental cues [20-25].
Duplicate genes involved in secondary metabolism or
that are responsive to environmental stimuli appear to be
more frequently maintained [26-28], and have more
highly diverged transcriptional patterns and intraspecific
variation in expression [29] than duplicate genes in other
categories. The pioneering study of [30] provided a paradigmatic case of duplication and transcriptional diversification in members of the stilbene synthase gene family in
grapevine. It is generally assumed that maintenance of
duplicate genes provides a foundation for consolidation
and refinement of established functions, particularly in
secondary metabolism, by preserving extra copies that
guarantee a gene reservoir for adaptive evolution, free
from the constraints of purifying selection [31-33].
In this paper, we present (i) the evolutionary path that
led to the structural architecture of the F3’5’H gene family
in grapevine, (ii) the transcriptional sub-functionalisation
of duplicate copies among organs and developmental
stages, and (iii) the extent of variation of expression patterns in four cultivars with divergent anthocyanin profiles.

F3’5’Hs and F3’Hs in grapevine: genomic location and
phylogeny

Sixteen copies of F3’5’Hs are present in the PN40024
genome. Each F3’5’H copy is referred to as F3’5’Ha
through F3’5’Hp, with the alphabetical order reflecting
their genomic coordinates [see Additional file 1]. Fifteen
of them (F3’5’Ha-o) reside in a tandem array within a
650-kb region on chromosome (chr) 6. This chromosomal region is syntenic with the homoeologous chr1 and 9
in poplar, and with supercontig157 in papaya (Figure 1a).
An isolated F3’5’H copy (F3’5’Hp) resides on grapevine
chr8, a chromosome that was homoeologous to chr6 in
the paleohexaploid ancestor [12]. However, other genes
in a 100-kb interval around F3’5’Hp are single-copy, and
not collinear with genes in the region on chr6 surrounding the other F3’5’Hs [see Additional file 2]. F3’5’Hp is an
orphan gene that lacks orthologues in other sequenced
dicots and in EST databases. In poplar, one or both
homoeologous loci syntenic with the grapevine F3’5’Hp
region, which are present in the homoeologous chr6 and
chr16 generated by the Salicoid WGD [34], have maintained the collinear genes present in grapevine, except
for F3’5’Hp (Figure 1b).
Seven F3’5’Hs on grapevine chr6 (F3’5’Hd, -f, -j, -l, -m,
-n, -o) and F3’5’Hp on chr8 encode full-length proteins.
In the haplotype of PN40024, the remainder gene models are either gene fragments without homology outside

of conserved regions, or coding regions interrupted by
transposable elements (TEs) or frameshift indels [see
Additional file 3].
Grapevine contains two copies of F3’H (F3’Ha and
F3’Hb) located in a 25-kb interval on chr17 [see Additional file 4a]. F3’Hs reside in two blocks of ~5 kb, which
share 93.5% identity over 4.3 kb of conserved sequence,
separated by ~16 kb largely consisting of repetitive elements. Both F3’Hs encode full-length proteins. F3’Ha
and F3’Hb share 97% amino acid identity, but their genomic sequences differ extensively due to a large indel in
the terminal intron [see Additional file 4]. Other genes
surrounding the two F3’H copies on chr17 are not collinear with genes surrounding F3’Hs on chr6 or on chr8.
F3’5’H and F3’H gene phylogeny was analysed using
translated sequences from six completely sequenced
plant genomes and samples from other species, totalling
33 angiosperms and one gymnosperm (Figure 2). All
F3’5’Hs split from F3’Hs. All grapevine F3’5’Hs are highly

conserved within the F3’5’H group. All of those located
in the gene array on chr6 tightly group into a single
major cluster. The more divergent F3’5’Ho, which resides
at the distal side of the array on chr6, and the orphan
F3’5’Hp on chr8 lie in deep-node branches (Figure 2).
Subclades were identified within the major cluster based
on maximum parsimony analysis of the coding sequences
[see Additional file 5a]. Timing of divergence among
duplicate F3’5’Hs was estimated by four-fold synonymous
third-codon transversion values (4DTV) (Figure 3a,b).
The earliest duplication that gave rise to F3’5’Hp and the
founder of all other F3’5’Hs on chr6 occurred synchronously with the event of g hexaploidisation (4DTV 0.361
± 0.035). In the chr6 array, F3’5’Ho has extensively
diverged from the progenitor of adjacent F3’5’Hs, with
4DTV between gene pairs at 0.178 ± 0.034. Most of the
recurrent duplications in the array have occurred much
more recently, generating two groups of copies that
diverged at 4DTV ~0.046 containing highly similar

copies within each group (4DTV ~0.003-0.006). F3’5’Hk
likely arose by illegitimate recombination between two
paralogues that diverged at 4DTV ~0.046, as reflected by
its intermediate 4DTV value (~0.026) and by the asymmetric distribution of 4DTV sites along F3’5’Hk, when
compared with members of either group (Figure 3b,c).
The two copies of grapevine F3’H grouped tightly
(Figure 2). F3’Hs are consistently present in one or a
few copies across fully sequenced plant species.

Evolution of the F3’5’H locus on chromosome 6

The pattern and mode of gene duplication were characterised through several approaches: (i) dot plot selfcomparison of the entire locus, (ii) conservation of
non-coding sequences, TE patterns, and sequence
divergence between long terminal repeats (LTRs) of
retrotransposons in duplicate blocks, (iii) level of identity between 10-kb windows around each F3’5’H, (iv)
intron divergence between the most recent duplicated

F3’5’Hs, and (v) conservation of duplicate F3’5’Hs
across the family Vitaceae.
A dot plot self-comparison of the locus identified 9
blocks of DNA ranging in size from 35 to 55 kb, each
containing one or two copies of F3’5’H at the forefront
of the block (Figure 4). The remaining F3’5’H copies in
this locus (F3’5’Hm, F3’5’Hn, and F3’5’Ho) are located
downstream of the segmental duplications. Duplicated
blocks do not contain genes other than F3’5’Hs and are
largely composed of repetitive DNA (Figure 4 and 5).
Blocks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 share 90-99% nucleotide
identity, and each contain a CACTA and a Gypsy TE
(Figure 5 and [see Additional file 6]). The ubiquitous
presence of this Gypsy element across these blocks and
the nucleotide substitution rate of 0.092 ± 0.023
between its LTRs date the Gypsy insertion to the ancestral single-copy sequence, recently in the evolutionary
history of Vitaceae. The present-day block 6 is more

Page 6 of 18

reminiscent of the ancestral state of the sequence that
initiated segmental duplications than blocks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,
and 8, as evidenced by the wide conservation of block 6
sequences among all of the other blocks, and by the fact
that all of the other blocks resemble block 6 with various structural modifications. Blocks 1 and 2 resemble
block 6 except for vestiges of a Gypsy element in the
middle of the block. Block 3 is nearly identical to block
6, except for a recent Gypsy insertion into the shared
Gypsy element. Sequence divergence between LTRs of
this nested Gypsy is 0.003. Block 5 has undergone the
most rearrangements, including hAT and Gypsy insertions at the extremities of the block, and two Gypsy
invasions upstream and downstream of the proximal
CACTA with low divergence between their LTRs
(0.068). Block 7 has ~17 kb of extra DNA with respect
to block 6 due to a Copia insertion and a nested Gypsy
insertion into the shared CACTA. With respect to block

6, block 8 has an additional CACTA. Blocks 4 and 9 differ extensively from all other blocks and share 94.5%
identity with each other (Figure 5 and [see Additional
file 6]). A Mutator insertion predated the duplication of
their common ancestor. In block 4, a Gypsy element has
moved into the Mutator shared with block 9, and a
Copia with 0.068 divergence between its LTRs has

invaded the distal side. Block 9 was invaded by a Gypsy
element with identical LTRs and by a Copia with 0.018
genetic distance between its LTRs.
Sequence conservation in a 10-kb window surrounding
each F3’5’H copy supports the hypothesis that most of
the copies were generated by duplications of the entire
segment in which they reside [see Additional file 7],

Falginella et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:562

with the following exceptions. Downstream of the segmental duplications, sequence similarity between the
nearly identical copies F3’5’Hm and F3’5’Hn does not
extend more than ~ 2 kb beyond each side of their coding regions. F3’5’Hk and -l are both located upstream of
block 9. F3’5’Hl and its 5’ non-coding region are dissimilar from the paralogous F3’5’H in duplicate blocks 4
and 9, as though F3’5’Hl originated from a small scale
duplication of F3’5’Hg, -m, or -n. F3’5’Ho, the copy at
the far extremity of the locus, shares low similarity only
upstream of the coding region with F3’5’Ha, -b, -c, -d,
-e, and -h. F3’5’Hp, the copy on chr8, has no similarity
outside of the coding region with other F3’5’Hs.
Intronic sequences of highly similar paralogous
F3’5’Hs reflect the relatedness of the entirety of the
duplicated block in which each F3’5’H resides [see Additional file 5b]. The few F3’5’Hs that lie in pairs at the
forefront of a duplicate block (F3’5’Ha and -b; F3’5’Hc
and -d) are less similar within the pair than with a
member of a different pair. Thus, paired F3’5’Hs at the
forefront of blocks 1 and 2 originated from an ectopic
duplication before the duplication of the corresponding
segment. The absence of intronless F3’5’Hs excluded a
role for retroposition in the process of gene duplication.
Conservation of duplicate F3’5’Hs in the family Vitaceae was assayed by PCR with copy-specific primers.
The orphan F3’5’Hp gene on chr8 was detected in the
genera Parthenocissus and Vitis, while it was faintly
amplified in Ampelopsis, likely due to more divergent
priming sites [see Additional file 8]. In contrast, only a
few primer pairs that amplified the most recent duplicate genes in Vitis genomes yielded amplicons in
Parthenocissus or Ampelopsis. A wide sample of cultivars and species within the genus Vitis bears the marks
of that expansion [see Additional file 8], including wine
and table cultivars of Vitis vinifera, Asian and American
Vitis species, and the muscadine grape.
Prediction of functional domains among duplicate F3’5’Hs

According to [35] and [36], six functional domains in
the F3’5’H enzyme are important for the determination
of substrate specificity and 3’ vs. 3’5’-OH activity (substrate recognition sites, SRS; candidate region, CR1).
F3’5’Ha, -c, -e, and -h are truncated in the PN40024
genome, and lack one or more functional domains [see
Additional file 9]. All other grapevine F3’5’Hs except
F3’5’Ho have invariant amino acids specific for 3’5’hydroxylation activity. In plants, F3’5’Hs are conserved
at three critical positions in the CR1 (positions 1, 3, and
10, which correspond to amino acids 178, 180, and 187
in the Osteospermum F3’5’H reference sequence used in
[36]) and at two positions in the SRS6 (positions 5 and
8, which correspond to amino acids 484 and 487 in
Osteospermum F3’5’H) [see Additional file 9]. All

Page 8 of 18

grapevine F3’5’Hs that diverged less than 4DTV ~0.046
show complete amino acid conservation at the CR1 and
SRS6 domains. F3’5’Hp on chr8 and F3’5’Ho, -m, and -n,
the most divergent copies in the F3’5’H array on chr6,
have a Met-to-Ile substitution at CR1 position 3 with
respect to other paralogues. This substitution is shared
with F3’5’Hs in grasses. F3’5’Ho also has an Ala-to-Thr
substitution at SRS6 position 8, which is shared with
corn and sorghum F3’5’Hs, as well as with most of the
F3’Hs. F3’5’Hp has an Ala-to-Val substitution at the
same position, which is uniquely shared with F3’5’Hs
from orchids. F3’5’Ho has extensively diverged from all
other F3’5’Hs at SRS1 and SRS2, while F3’5’Hp has
peculiar amino acid substitutions at SRS2, SRS4, and
SRS5.
Variation in promoter regions of duplicate F3’5’Hs

Duplicate F3’5’Hs have originated from segmental duplications of large DNA blocks, which included the coding
sequences and several kilobases of the surrounding
DNA. In some cases, reorganisation of promoter regions
within 2-kb upstream of the start codon occurred via
TE insertion, for example Copia and hAT elements in
the common ancestor of the present-day F3’5’Hc and -e
duplicates. In other cases (Figure 6), structural variation
in the promoter was caused by insertions/deletions of
DNA segments of variable length up to a few hundred
nucleotides, which do not belong to any annotated class
of repetitive elements. These inserted/deleted portions
are neither detected by algorithms of repetitive DNA
search such as ReAS, nor are they duplicated elsewhere
in the genome based on blastN searches. Structural variation in the promoters of F3’5’Hs often occurred in a
complementary fashion among gene copies, with a segment of one promoter having been lost in one duplicate
but maintained in another, and vice versa. Comparison
among triplets of promoters indicated that those segments were more often conserved in two F3’5’Hs and
absent from the third one than vice versa. All of this
evidence excludes a mechanism of copy-and-paste insertion in the promoter of either duplicate gene, and
favours the alternative hypothesis that structural deletions in the promoters of daughter copies have progressively degenerated the original sequence of the ancestral
single-copy gene, partitioning the full complement of
the regulatory information among copies.
Deletions may have asymmetrically erased cis-elements
from regulatory regions of duplicate F3’5’Hs. Thus, the
2-kb promoter regions of duplicate F3’5’Hs were
searched for DNA-binding motifs (Figure 6). Segments
that were alternatively maintained in either promoter
contained binding sites for Myb-type transcription
factors, light-responsive and drought-inducible ciselements, motifs sensitive to ABA and methyl-jasmonate,

and heat stress responsive motifs. Relatedness between
the alignable regions of duplicate promoters was also evident from a phylogenetic tree [see Additional file 5c].
Spatial expression patterns of duplicate F3’5’Hs and F3’Hs

Expression analyses were conducted on nine out of the
sixteen F3’5’H copies for which primer pairs could individually distinguish each paralogue and that passed the
thresholds of PCR efficiency as set in the Methods
section.
Duplicate F3’5’Hs are asymmetrically expressed across
organs (Figure 7) [see Additional file 10]. The orphan
copy F3’5’Hp is highly expressed in all vegetative organs
(leaf, petiole, tendril, flower, and shoot) and very weakly
in fruit. The highly duplicated F3’5’Hs that reside in segmental duplications on chr6 are preferentially expressed
in berry skin. Expression of F3’5’Hm, -n, and -o, three
copies located outside of the segmentally duplicated
region on chr6, was detectable in some vegetative
organs, but not in berry skin during ripening in all cultivars tested [see Additional file 11]. In fruit, none of the
F3’5’Hs that are expressed in cultivars accumulating
anthocyanins (‘Aglianico’, ‘Marzemino’, ‘Grignolino’, and
‘Nebbiolo’) are expressed during ripening in the greenskinned cultivar ‘Tocai’ (data not shown).
F3’Ha is widely expressed in many organs [see Additional file 4b]. In berry skins, F3’Ha expression increased
2-fold at full veraison, and then remained constant during the later stages of ripening [see Additional file 4d].
Transcripts of F3’Hb were never detected in the organs
analysed in this study [see Additional file 4c] and weak
expression of this copy was detected exclusively in
adventitious roots of ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ [37].

Expression of the F3’5’H gene family and variation of
anthocyanin profiles across different cultivars

Berries of four cultivars were sampled at eight developmental stages in order to quantify cumulative expression
of the F3’5’H gene family and relative contribution of individual F3’5’H copies, and to determine anthocyanin profiles. The accessions ‘Aglianico’, ‘Grignolino’, ‘Marzemino’,
and ‘Nebbiolo’ were chosen for their contrasting phenotypes of fruit colour, based on literature reports [4,9].
As a whole, expression of the F3’5’H gene family
levelled off before veraison [see Additional file 12], in
step with other genes of the flavonoid pathway [5].
F3’5’Hs became increasingly more expressed at 10% veraison, peaking at full-veraison and ten days after fullveraison. Expression then declined two weeks before
harvest and at harvest, but remained at higher levels
than those detected before the onset of ripening.
Cumulative expression of all duplicate F3’5’Hs indicated that the cultivar ‘Aglianico’ had significantly
greater F3’5’H expression during ripening than other
cultivars. Cumulative F3’5’H expression in ‘Aglianico’
was 3-fold higher than in ‘Marzemino’, and almost 20fold higher than in ‘Grignolino’ and ‘Nebbiolo’. ‘Aglianico’ and ‘Marzemino’ yielded dark grape skin extracts
(Figure 8a), with the highest concentrations of anthocyanins (Figure 8b), and their anthocyanin profiles were
predominantly composed of 3’5’-OH anthocyanins (9394%) (Figure 8c). ‘Grignolino’ and ‘Nebbiolo’ produced
reddish skin extracts, with anthocyanin profiles depleted
in 3’5’-OH anthocyanins (15% and 45%, respectively).
The level of expression of every F3’5’H copy was highly
variable in berry skin of different cultivars (Figure 9). As
a result, the contribution of individual gene copies to the

Figure 7 Expression of duplicate F3’5’Hs in organs of two grapevine cultivars. Semiquantitative Q-PCR was performed upon cDNA
normalisation with the housekeeping Ubiquitin gene.

F3’5’H transcript pool was unique to each cultivar. PCR
efficiency differences across cultivars are inherent when
dealing with four heterozygous grapevine accessions of
unrelated pedigree, due to possible nucleotide divergence
across the eight haplotypes. For each F3’5’H primer pair
we assessed that the standard deviation of PCR efficiency
among cultivars is less than 10%, and it is therefore unlikely to explain these results. A two-way ANOVA identified significant differences in relative transcript levels
among duplicate F3’5’Hs within each cultivar. F3’5’Hf was
the predominately expressed copy in ‘Aglianico’. PCR
efficiency for this copy in ‘Aglianico’ was 96.2%, which is
within the bounds of the standard deviation of the average PCR efficiency of this gene family in the same cultivar (92.9% ± 4.6%). F3’5’Hi was the predominately
expressed copy in ‘Nebbiolo’, and also in ‘Grignolino’
together with F3’5’Hf. In contrast, F3’5’Hj expression predominated in ‘Marzemino’. F3’5’Hg, -h, -l, and -p were
consistently expressed at lower levels across all cultivars,
despite the observation that PCR efficiencies of their primer pairs were not lower than other F3’5’H copies in the
accessions under study. Traces of transcripts of the
copies F3’5’Hm, -n, and -o were never detected in the
preliminary semiquantitative PCR screening at any stage
of berry ripening in any of the accessions tested, even
when PCR products were stained with silver nitrate for
high sensitivity. Thus, they were excluded from further
investigation by qPCR.
A three-way ANOVA was used to decouple and test
the significance of three factors that contributed to the
observed variation of expression patterns: gene-copy, cultivar, and developmental stage [see Additional file 12]. All
three factors were significant, as well as the interactions:

gene-copy × developmental stage, gene-copy × cultivar,
cultivar × developmental stage, and gene-copy × cultivar ×
developmental stage (P < 0.00001).
Distinct temporal expression patterns of duplicate F3’5’Hs
during ripening

Individual gene copies were differentially regulated during ripening. Differences in the expression pattern of
individual F3’5’Hs with regard to developmental time
were statistically significant in each of the four varieties,
separately analysed by one-way ANOVA and when averaged across cultivars (Figure 10). F3’5’Hi and -j were
expressed early, and attained a peak of expression
between full-veraison and ten days post-veraison, consistently among cultivars. Late in ripening, F3’5’H expression was predominated by transcripts of F3’5’Hf, -g ,-h,
and -l.

Discussion
Expansion of the F3’5’H family in grapevine

Gene-copy number of F3’5’Hs has increased in the grapevine lineage through recurrent cycles of duplication. The
most ancient duplication resulted in two F3’5’H loci. One
of these, F3’5’Hp, has been maintained as a single-copy
gene on chr8 in grapevine and other Vitaceae but lost
from other dicot genomes. The other was the founder of
the present-day F3’5’H gene array on chr6, orthologous to
the F3’5’Hs expressed in other dicot species and syntenic
with the F3’5’H loci found in poplar and papaya (Figure 1).
The 4DTV distance between F3’5’Hp and other F3’5’H
copies is close to the peak of 4DTV distances between
grape paleologues observed by Tang and coworkers [16]
(Figure 3). Timing of the earliest F3’5’H duplication is

reside are indeed paleologous chromosomes [12].
The orphan copy F3’5’Hp is predominantly expressed
in grape vegetative organs, in contrast with the F3’5’H

copies on chr6, which are predominantly expressed in
fruit (Figure 7). Several amino acid substitutions in
F3’5’Hp are shared with F3’Hs and monocot F3’5’Hs.
For instance, F3’5’Hs are present in many monocot species, but in all cases studied, their transcription is

uncoupled from the expression of other genes in the
anthocyanin pathway. As a result monocots seldom
accumulate 3’5’-OH anthocyanins [38]. For example,
seed coats of rice varieties with dark red pigmentation
contain exclusively 3’-OH anthocyanins, and the same
holds true for sorghum and purple corn. 3’5’-OH anthocyanins are also absent in blue flowers of Dendrobium
and Phalaenopsis orchids, albeit the detection of 3’5’OH flavonols provides evidence for F3’5’H activity [39].
Expansion of F3’5’Hs on chr6 occurred in the Vitaceae
lineage after the separation from other dicots. Indeed,
F3’5’H genes are present in low copy number in other
fully sequenced plant genomes, if not lost. F3’5’H is
absent from Arabidopsis, single-copy in rice and papaya,
and dual-copy in poplar and sorghum. In poplar, the two
copies of F3’5’H were generated by the Salicoid WGD
[34]. The presence of a single-copy gene in the syntenic
locus of poplar and papaya (Figure 1), and molecular dating of grapevine paralogues favour the hypothesis of lineage-specific gene duplications. The estimated age of
F3’5’H duplications based on transversion rate at fourfold synonymous third-codon positions predicts most
duplicate copies having diverged by less than 4DTV
~0.046 (Figure 3). If the molecular clock in grape is
approximately calibrated by comparing the evolutionary
rates in perennial dicots, the 4DTV distance of ~0.046 in
grape is roughly half of the median 4DTV distance
(~0.091) observed in poplar between duplicate genes that
arose from the 60-65 myr-old Salicoid duplication [34].
However, grape has evolved more slowly than poplar,
and the distances between paleologous genes that arose
from the g triplication are lower in grape (median Ks,
1.22) than in poplar (median Ks, 1.54), as estimated by
[16]. Thus, recalibrating the mutation rate in grape, the
4DTV distances between F3’5’H in the chr6 array suggest
that most duplications occurred within the past ~40 myr.
Molecular dating based on rate of nucleotide divergence is consistent with the conservation of duplicate
gene copies across lineages in the family Vitaceae. While
most of the 4DTV ~0.046 copies are conserved among
Vitis species, they failed to be amplified from the DNA
of related genera Ampelopsis and Parthenocissus. Conversely, the paleologous F3’5’Hp was conserved among
these genera. Fossil records from the Late Cretaceous
dates the radiation of Vitis, Ampelopsis, and Parthenocissus genera back to ~65 mya [40], confirming that most
of the F3’5’H expansion occurred in an ancestor of the
Vitis lineage, after the separation from the related
lineages Ampelopsis and Parthenocissus.
The founder of the array of F3’5’Hs on chr6 was initially duplicated through tandem gene duplication. Subsequently, different F3’5’H copies were involved in
reiterated segmental duplications of large DNA blocks

Page 13 of 18

in which they resided, generating 9 blocks that range in
size from ~35 to 55 kb (Figure 4 and 5). This modular
structure suggests that unequal crossing-over between
mispaired blocks was the most likely force that shaped
the locus. Subsequent reorganisation via TE insertion,
deletion, etc., resulted in structural variation among
blocks, which might have reduced illegitimate recombination between adjacent blocks, thus resulting in the
maintenance of the number of duplicates within the
current bounds. Although our data suggest that most of
the F3’5’H copies are maintained across grape varieties,
at least in a heterozygous state, the extent of structural
variation among haplotypes remains to be determined.
Regulatory diversification within the F3’5’H family and
anthocyanin profiles

Transcriptional subfunctionalisation has widely occurred
within the F3’5’H family and is detectable even between
some of the most recent duplicates that diverged less
than 4DTV ~0.046. This is evident, for instance, among
F3’5’Hf, -j, and -l, which have retained >94% amino acid
identity, and among F3’5’Hf, -g, and -l, which show conservation at the CR1 and SRS6 domains for 3’5’-OH
activity. Transcriptional subfunctionalisation is therefore
one of the forces, if not the predominant one, that is
responsible for the retention of the most recent duplicate
F3’5’Hs in grapevine. The extensive structural variation
found in their 5’ regulatory region, and the observed partitioned expression among organs and developmental
stages might have promoted the diversification of duplicates shortly after their origination, and thus the preservation of both duplicates. These pieces of evidence fit
well into the DDC model. Deletion of regulatory modules
is expected to occur by chance in promoters of duplicate
genes, eliminating different cis-elements in either duplicate and diversifying their expression profiles [18].
Alternatively, a gene dosage model may also explain
retention of duplicate F3’5’Hs [41], under the assumption that a fitness advantage is provided by extra F3’5’H
copies. F3’5’H gene products compete with F3’H gene
products for the enzymatic transformation of flavonoid
substrates into delphinidin or cyanidin precursors. Copy
number variation is a common cause of altered stoichiometry of concerted enzyme activities within metabolic
pathways, which results in phenotypic variation [42].
Unbalanced phenotypes with increased levels of 3’5’-OH
anthocyanins might have increased fitness, due to dissipation of high-energy blue wavelengths, attenuation of
UV-B radiation, or conspicuousness of fruits to seed dispersers [43-46].
Regulatory modules alternatively maintained in the promoter of either F3’5’H duplicate contain binding sites
for Myb-type transcription factors, drought-inducible

Falginella et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:562
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/562

cis-elements, and motifs responsive to ABA, methyljasmonate, light, and heat stress (Figure 6). The nature of
these putative cis-elements correlates well with those
factors shown to regulate F3’5’H expression. Myb-type
transcription factors are activators of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, including F3’5’Hs [47-50]. Light and water
deficits promote F3’5’H expression in the grape berry [3,7].
ABA and methyl-jasmonate are sucrose-dependent inducers of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes [51-53]. High temperatures restrict anthocyanin accumulation by promoting
pigment degradation and transcriptional repression of
anthocyanin genes [54,55].
Transcriptional regulation of duplicate F3’5’Hs in
berry skin is largely dependent on genotype, consistent
with the observation in other plants that tandem duplicates have highly variable expression patterns [29]. In
the present work, differential expression within the
F3’5’H gene family between different cultivars was associated with the differential accumulation of 3’5’-OH
anthocyanins. In the field, F3’5’H gene expression has a
functional impact on anthocyanin biosynthesis that persists during fruit ripening. Different copies of duplicate
F3’5’Hs have also become temporally specialised for different developmental stages of berry ripening (Figure
10). The question remains as to why these nuanced
expression patterns have been maintained evolutionarily.
One hypothesis is that copy-specific cis-elements confer
unique, adaptive patterns of expression and environmental responsiveness by increasing the ratio of F3’5’H/
F3’H enzyme concentration (and thus 3’5’-OH anthocyanins) under circumstances when accumulation of this
class of metabolites is advantageous.

Conclusions
Expansion in copy-number and transcriptional specialisation of F3’5’Hs have increased the regulatory complexity of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit colour among
red grape varieties. Most duplications occurred rather
recently within this gene family, long after the Vitaceae
lineage had separated from other dicot lineages. Among
duplicate copies, accumulation of structural variation in
promoter regions was more significant than divergence
in coding regions. Transcriptional subfunctionalisation
across organs and along developmental stages in ripening fruit was commonplace among gene copies, in addition to the extensive variation in gene expression among
different cultivars. Transcriptional differences within the
F3’5’H gene family in different accessions were paralleled by significant changes in the major metabolites
synthesised by the F3’5’H gene products. In berry skin,
the abundance of different anthocyanins that modulate
the pigmentation of red grapes and wines was greatly
affected by these transcriptional variations.

Methods
Sequence analyses

F3’5’Hs and F3’Hs were identified in grapevine (on chr6,
chr8, and chr17 sequence assemblies deposited under the
NCBI accession no. FN597024, FN597027, FN597042 as
of 25 November 2009), poplar (version 1.0, [34]), Arabidopsis, rice, papaya, and sorghum (version of the genome
assemblies available at Phytozome [56] as of November
2009) by tBlastN homology, using cytochrome P450
monooxygenases of the CYP75A subfamily (accession no.
AAP31058, AB078781, AJ011862, Z22544, BAA03439,
BAA03440) and the CYP75B sub-family (AY117551,
BAD00189, AF155332) as a query. Matches were retained
at thresholds of E<e -20 and amino acid identity >50%.
Each sequence was extended on each side until the next
gene and annotated using GenScan, FgenesH, GeneMark,
and Geneid. Sequence alignments were carried out using
ClustalX. Exon-intron structure was predicted by comparison with ESTs and amino acid sequences from other
plants. Trees were constructed using MEGA. Nucleotide
substitution rate was calculated using DNAsp 4.0. 4DTV
values were calculated and corrected for possible multiple transversions according to [16]. Gene models other
than F3’(5’)H were given the predicted function of their
best match in the NCBI protein database. Syntenic
regions were identified using the Genome Evolution tool
[57]. Transposable elements were annotated according to
the grape genome browser information [58]. LTRs in
Copia and Gypsy retrotransposons were identified by dot
plot analysis. Global DNA alignments of chromosomal
segments were performed using LAGAN [59] in a window of 100 bp with a minimum identity of 70%. Dot
plots of segmental duplications were made using Dotter.
Alignments of 2-kb promoter regions were performed
with DiAlign2, using a minimum HSP length of 10 bp
and visualised with GEvo. DNA binding motifs were
predicted by PlantCARE [60].
Selective amplification of F3’5’Hs and F3’Hs paralogues

Selective primers were designed across dissimilar exonic
DNA stretches or using a 3’-terminal SNP between the
perfect match of the target gene-copy and the mismatched annealing site of paralogous sequences [see
Additional file 13]. Absence of illegitimate cross-amplification of other paralogues was validated by amplification
of genomic DNA, Sanger sequencing of the PCR products, and detection of variable sites inside of primer
sequences that distinguished the target gene-copy from
other paralogues. qPCR efficiencies in amplifying the
DNA of PN40024 (from whose genome sequence genecopy specific primers were designed) and of the mixed
haplotypes of every heterozygous cultivar used in the
present study were calculated using the equation

Falginella et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:562
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/562

E = 10-1/slope of the standard curve. The standard curve
was constructed with five 10-fold serial dilutions, using
cDNA from organs and developmental stages in which
the specific gene-copy was expressed or, if not possible,
genomic DNA. Paralogue-specific primers with a PCR
efficiency comprised between 90 and 110% in PN40024
were considered acceptable, and were used for qPCR if
the standard deviation of their PCR efficiencies among
the accessions under study was less than 10%. PCR primers that distinguished individual paleologous copies, as
well as highly similar paralogues, and passed the thresholds set for the qPCR experiment, could be developed
for nine out of the sixteen F3’5’H copies. The remaining
copies were either highly identical in sequence or contained only a few polymorphic sites within DNA segments unsuitable for primer design. The range of
variation in average PCR efficiency of primer pairs
among the accessions tested was within the bounds of
87% in ‘Marzemino’ and 102% in ‘Nebbiolo’, with a
similar average efficiency of 93% in ‘Aglianico’ and
‘Grignolino’. This excluded a substantial cultivar effect
of the efficiency of primer annealing during qPCR on
the estimation of transcript levels of the whole gene
family among cultivars, caused by possible SNPs in the
annealing sites across haplotypes.

Page 15 of 18

A one-way ANOVA was used to assess the same effect
in each cultivar, as well as the differences in metabolite
content and composition among cultivars. Statistically
significant differences were determined using the Student-Newman-Keuls test (P < 0.05).
Anthocyanin profiling

Anthocyanins were extracted by sonication of 200 mg
berry skin in 1.8 mL of 1:1 methanol-H2O for 30 minutes.
After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, samples were
filtered with a 0.2 μm cellulose membrane (Phenomenex,
Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). Anthocyanins were separated by
an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a C18
Purospher RP-18 (5 mm, 250 × 4 mm) column (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany), according to the procedure reported
by [9], and detected at 520 nm by a UV-detector (Agilent
Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Calibration
curve was obtained with oenin-chloride (Extrasynthese,
Genay, France). Total anthocyanins were expressed as malvidin 3-glucoside equivalents and included monoglucoside,
acetyl-glucoside, and p-coumaroyl-glucoside fractions. The
anthocyanin profile was calculated for the monoglucoside
fraction as the percentage of 3’5’-OH derivatives.
Transcript profiling

Experimental design and statistics in expression and
metabolite analyses

Variation in anthocyanin profile and in transcriptional
level of duplicate genes among developmental stages
and cultivars was studied using a complete randomized
design, and tested for significance using ANOVA run by
COSTAT statistical package (CoHort Software, Monterey, CA, USA). Each plot consisted of 10-in-a-row
clonally replicated plants in north-south oriented rows.
Vines were grown at the germplasm repository of
Vivai Cooperativi Rauscedo, northeastern Italy (46°04’
N; 12°50’ E; 110 masl). Vines were trained using the Sylvoz system. Three biological replicates of 20 berries per
cultivar were collected at each developmental stage [see
Additional file 14]. Berries of each replicate were collected in the vineyard on both sides of canopy by random sampling on every plant within each plot. Samples
were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80°C until processed. Skin of each biological replicate
was peeled from frozen berries, powdered in liquid
nitrogen, and split to obtain a 100 mg aliquot for RNA
extraction and a 200 mg aliquot for anthocyanin extraction. A three-way ANOVA was used to partition the
factors that contributed to expression divergence in
ripening fruit: gene-copy, cultivar and developmental
stage, and their interactions. A two-way ANOVA was
used to assess the effect of gene-copy and developmental stage on expression level, regardless of the cultivar.

Total RNA was extracted as described in [61], treated with
RNase-Free DNase I Set (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy), and
purified with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup (Qiagen S.p.A.,
Milan, Italy) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Complete removal of gDNA was assessed by direct use of
treated RNA as a template for PCR reactions using the
gene VvUbiquitin1. Absence of PCR products was visually
inspected in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Absence of gDNA in reverse-transcribed samples
was further confirmed by the melting curve performed
during qPCR cycling using the intron-flanking primers for
the normalisation gene VvUbiquitin1. The integrity of
treated RNA was verified by electrophoresis in 1% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide. RNA purity (A260/A280
nm) and quantification were estimated using a Nanodrop
1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Wilmington, DE, USA). cDNA was synthesised using 2 μg
of treated RNA, 0.5 μM (dT)18 primer, 0.5 mM dNTPs
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA Cat# U1240), and 100 U of
M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA Cat# N1701) in a 20 μL reaction volume supplemented with 20 U of RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA Cat# N2611) and incubated at 37°C
for 90 min. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on a
DNA Engine Opticon2 (MJ Research, Waltham, MA,
USA) in a 20 μL reaction volume containing 5 μL of 20fold diluted cDNA, 0.4 U of HotMaster Taq polymerase,
4.0 mM Magnesium acetate, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1X SYBR

solution (5 PRIME GmbH, Hamburg, Germany, Cat#
2200800), and 200 nM of each forward and reverse primer. Thermal cycling parameters were: initial denaturation
at 95°C for 3 min, followed 40 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 61°C
for 20 s, and 68°C for 30 s, plate read at 78-82°C depending on each primer pair for 1 s, melting curve from 65°C
to 95°C, read every 1°C, hold 1 s, and a final extension at
68°C for 5 min. Threshold cycle (Ct) was determined using
the Opticon Monitor analysis software (version 2.02, MJ
Research, Waltham, MA, USA) with a threshold level of
fluorescence signal detection of log -1.7. Aliquots from the
same cDNA were run in duplicate in the qPCR assay.
Intra-assay repeatability between technical replicates was
below 1 Ct. All assays included no-template controls. Relative gene expression of the target gene was calculated with
the 2-ΔΔCt method, using the constitutive expression of the
housekeeping Ubiquitin gene (VvUbiquitin1) [6]. VvUbiquitin1 has been widely used in qPCR experiments conducted in grapevine across various organs by several
research groups, in particular for berry samples. Semiquantitative PCR was performed upon cDNA normalisation based on VvUbiquitin1 expression and visualised in a
1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide, or on
SSCP gel stained with silver nitrate.

target F3’H, but has a mismatch at the 3’-terminal nucleotide with the
paralogous F3’H. Selectivity of primer pairs for either F3’Ha or F3’Hb was
validated by amplifying PN40024 genomic DNA and by Sanger
sequencing of the PCR amplicons. Selectivity for either F3’Ha or F3’Hb
was also confirmed by assessing the size of the amplified genomic DNA
(vs. the size prediction of 523 bp and 370 bp astride the second intron
in F3’Ha and F3’Hb, respectively) and, for the expressed F3’Ha, by inferring
intron size from the comparison between amplicons from genomic DNA
and cDNA. Expression of F3’Ha was assessed by semi-quantitative PCR

using cDNA from leaf, petiole, tendril, flower, shoot, and berry skin and
flesh, in two grapevine cultivars (’Merlot’ and ‘Aglianico’). Expression of
F3’Ha was also assessed in berry skin of four cultivars (’Aglianico’,
‘Marzemino’, ‘Grignolino’, and ‘Nebbiolo’) at four stages of fruit
development. cDNA was normalised using the constitutive gene
VvUbiquitin. Transcripts of F3’Hb were never detected under the same
experimental conditions. In section d, expression of F3’Ha was assessed
by quantitative PCR in berry skin at 8 developmental stages in the
cultivars ‘Aglianico’, ‘Marzemino’, ‘Grignolino’, and ‘Nebbiolo’. Transcript
levels of F3’Ha increased at full-veraison (stage of 100% coloured berries)
by approximately 2-fold in all cultivars, with substantial differences
among cultivars only at harvest. Transcript levels are expressed as
arbitrary units, normalised using the constitutive gene coding for
VvUbiquitin. Bars represent the standard deviation of three biological
replicates. Letters above the histograms indicate significant differences
between means, based on a Student-Newman-Keuls test (P < 0.05).
Additional file 5: Evolutionary relationships among grapevine
F3’5’Hs. Phylogenetic trees are inferred using the Maximum Parsimony
method and are based on (a) mRNA sequence alignments of all grapevine
F3’5’Hs and (b) intron sequences of F3’5’Hs that reside in duplicate blocks
on chr6. The most parsimonious tree was obtained using the CloseNeighbor-Interchange algorithm with search level 3, in which the initial
trees were obtained with the random addition of sequences. The
rectangular and radiation trees are drawn to scale, with branch lengths
calculated using the average pathway method, and are expressed in units
of the number of changes over the whole sequence. There were a total of
419 positions in the mRNA dataset, out of which 39 were parsimony
informative, and 1546 positions in the intron dataset, out of which 180
were parsimony informative. For each gene, tree topology is compared to
genomic location. Bootstrap values >70 are reported above the
corresponding branch. DNA sequences were aligned with ClustalX and
trees were obtained using MEGA4. (c) Tree based on LAGAN alignments
of 5’ regulatory sequences 2-kb upstream of the translation start codon.
Additional file 6: Multiple alignments of non-coding DNA within
each of 9 tandemly duplicated blocks in the F3’5’H locus on chr6.
On top of each page, coloured bars indicate annotated TEs in the
PN40024 genome; sequence gaps (Ns) in the genome assembly are
indicated by dotted red lines. Plots of sequence identity range from 50
to 100% on the y-axis in the LAGAN multi-panels. The number of base
pairs shared by each duplicated block with the reference block (on top)
is given on the right-hand side, with the average nucleotide identity.
Additional file 7: Multiple alignments of non-coding DNA in 10-kb
surrounding duplicate F3’5’H genes. In the panel on top of each page,
F3’5’H exons are indicated as thick blue bars, introns are thin blue
connectors. Coloured boxes indicate annotated TEs. Plots of sequence
identity range from 50 to 100% on the y-axis in the LAGAN multi-panels.
Additional file 8: Conservation and SSCP polymorphisms of
duplicate F3’5’Hs in the family Vitaceae. PCR amplicons were obtained
from genomic DNA using copy-specific primers. DNA samples included
the ornamental grapevines Virginia creeper Parthenocissus quinquefolia,
native to Northeastern-America, and the porcelain berry Ampelopsis
brevipedunculata, native to temperate areas of Asia (segment A), wild
grapevines (segment B) including the 2n = 40 Muscadinia rotundifolia,
two North American species V. riparia and V. candicans, two Asian
species V. armata and V. romanetii, and a spontaneous ecotype of V.
vinifera ssp sylvestris collected in woods of Northeastern Italy; red-skinned
cultivars of the domesticated V. vinifera ssp sativa (segment C); whiteskinned cultivars (Pinot bud sports with mutations for skin colour are
shown beside Pinot blanc) and the nearly-homozygous line PN40024
(segment D). PCR amplicons were run in agarose gel (section a) and in
denaturing gel for detecting single-strand conformational polymorphisms
(section b). Among F3’5’Hs, the isolated gene copies F3’5’Hp, -o, -m, and
-n showed the lowest levels of conformational polymorphisms, while
segmentally duplicated F3’5’Hs were more variable across taxa.
Additional file 9: Amino acid alignment of substrate recognition sites
(SRS) and functional domains for hydroxylation activity (CR1) in plant
F3’5’Hs. Amino acid positions crucial for 3’ vs. 3’5’-hydroxylation in CR1 and
SRS6 are indicated by black arrows; significant amino acid substitutions in
grapevine F3’5’Hs are in green background. Relevant amino acid

substitutions within domains putatively involved in substrate recognition
are highlighted in grapevine F3’5’Hs by blue background when they are
unique with respect to all other plant F3’5’Hs or when they are shared
exclusively with either monocot F3’5’Hs or other plant F3’Hs, as possible
remnants of ancestral transition stages in the evolution of dicot F3’5’Hs.
Additional file 10: Transcripts of duplicate F3’5’Hs detected in various
organs of two grape cultivars by semiquantitative PCR. Bold + indicates
high expression of PCR amplicons visualised on agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide (see Figure 7), regular + indicates weak expression
detected only by the more sensitive silver staining, - indicates lack of
detectable transcripts.
Additional file 11: Expression of duplicate F3’5’Hs in berry skin of
four cultivars accumulating 3’5’-OH anthocyanins detected by
semiquantitative PCR. Berry skin was sampled at four developmental
stages. cDNA was normalised using the housekeeping Ubiquitin gene. UFGT
was used as a marker for anthocyanin gene expression. Even though the
pre-veraison berries were sampled over green bunches immediately before
visible colour transition, expression of UFGT had already been triggered in
‘Aglianico’ and was barely detectable in ‘Nebbiolo’. Either primer of the
oligonucleotide pairs targeting the F3’5’Hi and -l copies anneals to either
exon of the corresponding gene model. The corresponding PCR bands
obtained from gDNA are approximately 400 bp longer than the cDNA
amplicons shown in the stripes of the electrophoresis gel of this figure.
