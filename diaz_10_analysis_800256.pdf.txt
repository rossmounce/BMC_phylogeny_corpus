using the roof rat as outgroup

Abstract
Background: Certain mutations in the vitamin K epoxide reductase subcomponent 1 gene (vkorc1) mediate rodent
resistance to warfarin and other anticoagulants. Testing for resistance often involves analysis of the vkorc1. However, a
genetic test for the roof rat (Rattus rattus) has yet to be developed. Moreover, an available roof rat vkorc1 sequence
would enable species identification based on vkorc1 sequence and the evaluation of natural selection on particular
vkorc1 polymorphisms in the Norway rat (R. norvegicus).
Results: We report the coding sequence, introns and 5' and 3' termini for the vkorc1 gene of roof rats (R. r. alexandrinus
and R. r. frugivorus) from Uganda, Africa. Newly designed PCR primers now enable genetic testing of the roof rat and
Norway rat. Only synonymous and noncoding polymorphisms were found in roof rats from Uganda. Both nominal
subspecies of roof rats were indistinguishable from each other but were distinct from R. losea and R. flavipectus;
however, the roof rat also shares at least three coding sequence polymorphisms with R. losea and R. flavipectus. Many of
recently published vkorc1 synonymous and non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Norway rats
are likely SNPs from roof rats and/or other Rattus species. Tests applied to presumably genuine Norway rat vkorc1 SNPs
are consistent with a role for selection in two populations carrying the derived Phe63Cys and Tyr139Cys mutations.
Conclusion: Geographic mapping of vkorc1 SNPs in roof rats should be facilitated by our report. Our assay should be
applicable to most species of Rattus, which are intermediate in genetic distance from roof and Norway rats. Vkorc1mediated resistance due to non-synonymous coding SNPs is not segregating in roof rats from Uganda. By using the
roof rat sequence as a reference vkorc1, SNPs now can be assigned to the correct rat species with more confidence.
Sampling designs and genotyping strategies employed so far have helped detect candidate mutations underlying
vkorc1-mediated resistance, but generally provided unsuitable data to test for selection. We propose that our
understanding of vkorc1-mediated evolution of resistance in rodents would benefit from the adoption of sampling and
genotyping designs that enable tests for selection on vkorc1.
Background
The roof rat (Rattus rattus) is one of the most abundant
and geographically widespread mammals [1]. It has
prominently influenced human history by acting as a carrier of disease, most prominently the plague, which
remains a concern for public health particularly in Asia
and Africa. The roof rat and numerous closely related
species are important agricultural pests. Damage to
structures in urban areas and devastating effects on
endemic fauna on islands or otherwise endemic habitats

are also areas of great concern. Pest management of roof
rat populations is a global task [1].
Anticoagulant rodenticides target vitamin K epoxide
reductase (VKOR) [2], an essential enzyme for the vitamin K cycle (c.f. [3] for review and additional references).
Inhibition of VKOR by the rodenticides prevents production of functional blood coagulation factors, such that
susceptible rodents that consume the bait succumb to
lethal internal hemorrhage (c.f. [4] for review and additional references). A warfarin-sensitive subcomponent of
VKOR is encoded by the vitamin K epoxide reductase
complex subunit 1 (vkorc1) gene [5,6].
In vivo and in vitro studies showed that certain singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region of
the vkorc1 confer resistance in Norway rats (R. norvegi-

cus), mice (Mus musculus spp.) [7] and R. losea [8]. Moreover, SNPs in both the coding and 5' non-coding regions
of the gene are associated with warfarin (a.k.a. coumadin)
responsiveness in humans [9]. However, the physiological
response to anticoagulants can also be affected or modified by other genes, including cytochrome P450 genes in
roof rats from Japan [10] and in humans (cytochrome
P450 2C9) (e.g. [9]). Nevertheless, while other genes
might modify physiological tolerance levels and possibly
resistance, this phenomenon is currently investigated in
rodents mainly with respect to SNPs in the vkorc1 gene
[11]).
Anticoagulant rodenticides remain the tool of choice to
control infestations by many species of rodents [12].
However, unlike in the Norway rat and the mouse, it is
not known whether roof rat populations carry SNPs in
vkorc1 that might render them tolerant or resistant to
anticoagulant rodenticides. As for Norway rats and house
mice, variation in tolerance towards rodenticides has
been observed for the roof rat [e.g. [10,13]]. Geographic
mapping of vkorc1 SNPs in this species across the globe is
required, especially in areas where the roof rat is considered a nuisance species. Such genetic testing could identify individuals or populations that merit more conclusive
but also more labor- and cost-intensive in vitro and/or in
vivo laboratory testing for resistance [7,11]. The detection
of vkorc1-mediated resistance in roof rats would also be
interesting from an evolutionary perspective, because it
would provide additional evidence for convergent evolution of vkorc1-mediated poison resistance in multiple
rodent species. However, while the vkorc1 genes of the
Norway rat and house mouse have been sequenced as
part of genome sequencing projects and population
sequencing surveys, the vkorc1 sequence of the roof rat
remains unknown. Consequently, there is no genetic toolkit presently available that can be used to conduct genetic
testing of the roof rat.
The identification of many vkorc1 SNPs in Norway rats
has revealed direct links for some of these to resistance in
this species, most notably at amino acid position 139 of
the protein [6,7,11]. When mutated, it was shown that
this position confers resistance in vivo and in vitro [7,14].
However, as evidenced from alignments among Drosophila, fish and mammals, the vkorc1 gene is highly conserved. Thus, the large number of SNPs in the vkorc1
gene of the Norway rat has motivated biological interpretations, including the presence of mutational hotspots
and selection [7].
Population genetic theory predicts that most SNPs in a
finite sample of sequences are detrimental or neutral [15].
The finding of numerous vkorc1 SNPs in a finite sample
of Norway rats suggests that these must be frequent or
else they would not have been found in the small samples
analyzed to date for the Norway rat [7]. This has

prompted speculation that these SNPs must be adaptive,
possibly in the context of fifty years of warfarin selection
[7]. However, we suggest that, in layman's terms, the
degree of polymorphism reported for the Norway rat
seems biologically implausibly high. This prompted us to
reevaluate vkorc1 SNPs that have been published for the
Norway rat using the outgroup sequence of vkorc1 from
the roof rat obtained as part of our study reported here.
Except for a few studies based on microsatellite data
[16,17] no other population genetic tests for selection at
the vkorc1 have been conducted. The published SNP data
for the Norway rat should be subjected to rigorous analyses, however such analyses require appropriate outgroup
sequences to determine which SNPs are ancestral and
which ones are derived. The latter group more likely represents SNPs that mediate resistance to rodenticides. The
vkorc1 sequence of the roof rat could provide such a
needed outgroup perspective. Moreover, the published
SNP data have yet to be explored in terms of the plausibility of selection on the vkorc1 arising from widespread use
of warfarin and other anticoagulant poisons. Such explorations of currently published vkorc1 SNPs might illustrate the need to apply different sampling strategies from
those currently used to enable population genetic tests
for selection. For example, published vkorc1 SNP data
generally appear to have been collected following nonrandom sampling designs of rats, which, essentially,
focused on strains or populations where resistance was a
priori known or suspected to be present, and thus, the
likelihood of detecting non-synonymous candidate mutations in vkorc1 underlying resistance was high. Moreover,
preference was given to sampling designs that included
few individuals each but from many locations worldwide.
Thus, in general, published vkorc1 SNPs are from nonrandom samples of few individuals.
Here we report the complete genomic sequence of the
vkorc1 gene from the roof rat. Our study is set within the
context of ecological and parasitological surveys of roof
rats and other rodents in the West Nile region of Northwest Uganda, where the bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic forms of the plague still occur [18]. The
management of non-native roof rat populations and
other native rodent species that can carry and/or transmit diseases is considered within this context, as is the
need for genetic testing of roof rats for the presence of
vkorc1 SNPs that might interfere with rodent control.
We provide primers for PCR amplification and DNA
sequencing, namely a genetic testing strategy for the
presence of SNPs in vkorc1 that is applicable to roof rats.
However, we show that the strategy can also be applied to
the Norway rat, thereby eliminating the need to apply
species-specific strategies in areas where both species are
found. Furthermore, we designed the approach so it can
be tested on the many rat pest species that are intermedi-

ate in genetic distance to the roof and Norway rats. We
present polymorphism data on the two putative subspecies R. r. alexandrinus and R. r. frugivorus, and show that
the vkorc1 sequence of R. rattus is distinct from the partial sequences reported for R. flavipectus and R. losea. We
illustrate the value of the roof rat vkorc1 sequence by
reanalyzing published SNP data for the Norway rat, both
in terms of species identification and the possibility of
selection on the gene.

Results and Discussion
The vkorc1 sequence of the roof rat
Amplification of vkorc1 in rats

The primer combinations Rr1-F/R, Rr2-F/R and Rr3-F/R
amplified the 5' and 3' noncoding regions (I and IV), both
introns (II and III) and all three exons (E.1-E.3) for the
roof rat (Figure 1A) and the Norway rat, but the primers
are unsuitable to amplify corresponding regions from
mouse DNA (e.g. here M. m. domesticus collected in
Western Germany) under standard conditions (Figure
1B). The primer combination Rr1-F/R, Rr2-F/R and Rr3-

F/R should be useful for screening roof rat populations
for vkorc1 polymorphisms.
We designed the genetic assay in order to provide a test
that is applicable to the many other pest species of Rattus
(e.g., R. losea and R. exulans) that are intermediate in
genetic distance between the roof and Norway rats,
which diverged ~2.8 million years ago [19,20]. This would
enable the application of one assay even in populations
where numerous Rattus species occur together, in particular the many locations where the cosmopolitan species
(roof rat and Norway rat) are sympatric. However, as we
explore below, this raises issues regarding correct assignment of SNPs in the vkorc1 that emerge from genetic testing in areas where the roof and Norway rats are both
found, or in other assemblages of rat species [21].
Uniqueness of the roof rat sequence

Inspection of the vkorc1 coding sequence showed one
fixed synonymous substitution (T280C) between the roof
rat and R. losea/R. flavipectus; the remaining polymorphisms in the roof rat are shared among the three species
(Additional file 1 for protein coding sequence data and
Additional file 2 for 5'UTR/intron sequence data). This is

testament to their recent common ancestry (~0.45 million years ago, [19]), and/or that the incipient species
resulting from the recent if not ongoing radiation of the
R. rattus species complex (a group of dozens morphologically highly similar and often indistinguishable species
including R. argiventer, R. tiomanicus, R. sikkimensis, and
others [1]) may continue to interbreed when in sympatry
[22]. Unexpectedly, because of the considerable evolutionary time (~2.8 million years ago) that separates the
roof rat and Norway rat, we observe zero fixed differences (divergent sites) between the two species if published SNP data by Ref. [7] are used (Additional file 1).
This implies that the two species cannot be distinguished
based on their vkorc1 coding sequences. Below we examine whether some coding sequence SNPs published for
the Norway rat in fact might belong to the roof rat.
Genetic variation in the vkorc1 of roof rats from Uganda

R. r. alexandrinus and R. r. frugivorus trapped at our study
sites in Uganda, Africa (see Methods) are not genetically
distinguishable at the level of the vkorc1 coding sequence
(Additional file 1) and non-coding sequences (Additional
file 2). We identified at least 5 vkorc1 genotypes (H1-5),
but none of these was specific to one or the other nominal subspecies. DNA barcoding based on the cytochrome
oxidase 1 (CO1) mtDNA gene (DNA barcoding)
sequences confirmed that our samples are R. rattus (Figure 2).
No barriers to gene flow between these morphs (a.k.a.
subspecies) were supported. First, genetic differentiation
(as measured as FST) was non-significantly different from
zero. Second, sequences H1-5 clustered together during
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3). Thus we predict that if
any vkorc1-mediated resistance were detected in one of
the color morphs or nominal subspecies, interbreeding
would transmit it between the two morphs in our study
area in Uganda. The absence of non-synonymous poly-

morphisms in the individuals/populations studied by us
so far suggests that resistance does not segregate as a
vkorc1-mediated trait at present in the study area in
Uganda, or that it is too rare to be detected. Among three
silent genetic polymorphisms in exon sequences of the
roof rat, a synonymous SNP (Gly60Gly, Additional file 1)
has not been documented before in rodents. The lack of
differentiation at vkorc1 between subspecies lends support to those who argue against the legitimacy of subspecies classifications in roof rats based on coat color, which
was shown to segregate within crosses between subspecies [23].
The value of the roof rat vkorc1 sequence as a reference
and outgroup
Detection of SNPs of uncertain species origin

Tabulation of sequence differences between sequences of
the Norway rat and roof rat revealed polymorphism to
divergence ratios for synonymous and non-synonymous
sites that deviate from expectations (Table 1). Specifically,
only 10 and 14 polymorphic synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs, respectively, were observed in the original data on SNP variation in the Norway rat [7].
Synonymous and non-synonymous divergent sites, however, were not observed (Additional file 1).
One or two sites were divergent between the roof rat
and R. flavipectus or R. losea, respectively. The lack of
divergence between the roof rat and Norway rat thus is
unexpected, given that the two species have diverged
much longer ago (~6 times) than the species triad composed of roof rat, R. flavipectus and R. losea. This observation is also unexpected in terms of evolutionary rate
calculations. Assuming ~2.2 × 10-9 substitutions per site
we would expect ~3 divergent sites in vkorc1 protein coding region between roof rat and Norway rat.
In addition to the unexpected lack of divergence, we
observed peculiar patterns of SNP sharing between samples analyzed previously [7] and our newly obtained roof
rat sequences (Additional file 1). For instance, the
reported genotypes derived from a series of amino acid
substitutions in the USA (Santa Cruz), Argentina (Buenos
Aires) and the Azores (Terceira) corresponded to those of
the roof rat, not the Norway rat (Additional file 1).
To investigate this issue in more detail, we reconstructed genealogies for the vkorc1 coding regions from
the roof rat, R. flavipectus, R. losea, and Norway rat
sequences (Figure 3). We observed that 23 sequences
obtained from 95 samples grouped with the Norway rat
reference sequence (bootstrap value 95%). In contrast, 10
vkorc1 sequences obtained from 29 samples, all presumed
to be Norway rats, did not cluster with the reference
sequence of the Norway rat obtained from Ensembl or
Genbank (Additional file 1). Instead, four of these
grouped significantly with our newly obtained roof rat

sequences H1-H5 (bootstrap value 91%), or grouped
loosely together outside the clades of roof rat and Norway
rat.
We noted the presence of similar such sequences
resembling the roof rat or roof-rat like vkorc1 in a study
conducted in France [24], 'designated as 'haplotypes C
and D' in that study. Therefore, vkorc1 SNPs as reported
in Ref. [7] obtained from rats in the USA, Argentina and
the Azores appear to be vkorc1 SNPs from roof rats mistakenly assigned as SNPs from the Norway rat, and other
SNPs presumed to be of Norway rat origin from the
Azores, Indonesia, Thailand and, possibly France (as
reported in Ref. [24]), may be of roof rat origin and/or of
uncertain species origin in need of verification. Such

sequences could either be divergent lineages of the roof
rat, which is paraphyletic with respect to other species of
the Rattus-species complex [19], or could be other species of Rattus that occupy an intermediate position in
evolutionary/phylogenetic terms (c.f. [19] for possible
such species). However, we are confident stating that
those sequences that co-cluster outside the R. norvegicus
clade in Figure 3 are, in fact, not Norway rats as claimed,
and that sequences that cluster together with our R. rattus sequences indeed seem to be roof rats. Again, uncertainties remain regarding the species origin of 'roof ratlike' sequences. DNA barcoding of these samples would
be needed to determine the species (for DNA barcoding
protocols applicable to rats refer to [19]).

Notably, roof rats emerged as a genetically heterogeneous group of R. rattus lineages [25]. Some samples
from Asia might be common pest species in this region.
These would be species that are closely related to the roof
rat or considered roof rats, depending on the taxonomy
employed [1,25], such as R. argiventer, R. tiomanicus, or
R. sikkimensis. We suggest that the patterns we observed
in Figure 3 (c.f. also Additional file 1) can best be
explained by misclassification of samples collected in the
field. The roof rat and Norway rat do not produce viable
offspring when crossed [26], thus excluding the possibility that the pattern can be explained by hybridization.
Cross-contamination between DNA samples and/or PCR
reactions in the laboratory is a remote yet possible risk
factor to studies.
We reassessed the patterns of polymorphisms and
divergence between the Norway rat and roof rat (Table 1)

while accounting for the presence of SNPs of questionable (i.e. possible R. rattus or R. rattus-like) species origin
in the published data [7]. Questionable origin of SNPs
was judged based on the results of phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 3). Their removal from the data set resulted in
polymorphism/divergence ratios that are consistent with
expectations (Table 1). Note that the number of divergent
synonymous sites (n = 4; Table 1, middle) now is consistent with the expected approximate divergence between
roof rat and Norway rat (~3 sites in the vkorc1 gene, see
above). We conducted one-tailed tests to assay for excess
polymorphisms specifically. Two-tailed tests were also
non-significant. This result indicates further that there is
no evidence that vkorc1 has evolved under selection
(Table 1).
The presence of singleton polymorphisms in datasets
can render the Macdonald-Kreitman test insensitive to

Díaz et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/43

selection. These singletons artificially inflate the polymorphism category, in that a large proportion is expected
to be deleterious and thus not expected to attain higher
frequencies and fixation [27]. Moreover, due to the sampling design underlying the discovery of the published
vkorc1 SNPs (see above) we expected an excess of singleton SNPs in the data. If we account for the presence of
such deleterious mutations that segregate at low frequency, then the polymorphism/divergence ratios remain
consistent with expectations (Table 1). Thus, based on
the analysis of polymorphism to divergence ratios, no evidence for selection on the global sample of Norway rat
vkorc1
sequences
can
be
established.
Overall, we suggest that published SNP data for the
Norway rat require closer inspection. As selection is not
apparent in the global sample of vkorc1 polymorphisms,
evidence for selection is perhaps best sought by studying
vkorc1 polymorphisms at a local scale, namely within
deeply and randomly sampled populations that have
experienced selection with warfarin or other anticoagulants. The possibility of species misclassification must be
excluded before the population genetic data on the vkorc1
gene are interpreted in light of selection with warfarin
poison.
Researchers conducting genetic testing often receive
only tail clips for analysis. Also non-invasive genotyping
[28] as applied to rodent droppings [29] provides larger
samples for genetic tests of resistance in rodent populations. Thus the risk of species misclassification should
not be underestimated, even though the Norway rat and
the roof rat are quite different in appearance. The availability of the roof rat vkorc1 sequence will further aid in
detecting misclassification errors. If in doubt, i.e. when
studying populations where more than one rat species
occurs, then we encourage DNA barcoding as well as the
use of non-coding vkorc1 sequences to obtain more informative DNA nucleotide positions for species assignment.
Tests for selection at the local scale

One important hypothesis surrounding vkorc1 sequence
polymorphisms in rodents posits a role for selection with
anticoagulant
rodenticides
such
as
warfarin
[7,10,11,17,30,31]. In particular, tests for selection on specific mutations that occur in a population may provide
further support for their roles in mediating anticoagulant
resistance. In fact, warfarin selection and its influence on
polymorphisms at the warfarin resistance locus have
attained high profile status as an exemplary case for rapid
microevolution in a mammal [32,33].
Selective sweeps have been documented in warfarinresistant populations of rats in Germany [16,17]. In an
attempt to recapitulate the results for the published data
(Table 1 in Ref. [7]) we analyzed vkorc1 polymorphism
data. After removing SNPs of questionable species origin
(i.e., excluding R. rattus and other roof rat-like sequences;

Page 7 of 11

see Figure 3 and Additional file 1) only the samples from
England, Hungary, and Korea appear suitable for formal
analysis. The population from Chicago, USA is a strain
maintained in a laboratory, which is not suitable for analysis.
We found no statistical support for a recent selective
sweep in the population from Korea (Tyr139Phe). More
extensive sampling might increase the power for the analysis of this population. Moreover, we found no evidence
for a selective sweep in the combined sample from England. However, the sample from Cambridge/Essex in England (Phe63Cys), if analyzed separately, emerged as
significant (Tajima's D = -1.84; p < 0.001; Fay & Wu's normalized H = -3.27, p = 0.007).
Finally, an exploratory analysis of the population from
Hungary (Tyr139Cys) is used here to illustrate the difficulties in conducting rigorous tests for selection based on
vkorc1 SNP data as commonly collected and reported
(e.g., Refs. [7,24]). Specifically, for a portion of the rats in
the Hungarian sample, synonymous SNPs were not
assayed (9/12 rats; [7]). We used the information that
three out of three rats assayed for synonymous SNPs carried an Ile82Ile synonymous SNP. Amongst these was one
rat with the Tyr139Cys variant. In Figure 4 we plot Fay
and Wu's normalized H versus additional genotyping
efforts needed to obtain sufficient synonymous variation
data to enable tests for the signature of a selective sweep
at vkorc1. We show that a total of seven rats would need
to carry the derived Ile82Ile synonymous variant to
obtain marginal significance for Fay and Wu's H statistic.
Genotyping of at least an additional 4-12 rats for synonymous variation likely would have been sufficient to detect
these, and thus, to document a selective sweep in the
population (Fay and Wu's normalized H = -2.112, p =
0.0506; Figure 4).
In summary, it appears that the SNP variation data for
vkorc1 in a number of populations are indicative of selection at the local (population) scale. The high frequency
attained by a number of non-synonymous SNPs (e.g., aa
position 139; c.f. Additional file 1) is further indicative of
a selective advantage for particular SNPs [7,24]. Moreover, if interpreted in conjunction with in vitro studies
showing VKOR activity in the presence of rodenticide, a
selective advantage of rats carrying particular SNPs in
vkorc1 can be hypothesized. However, to firmly establish
selection on particular vkorc1 mutations we suggest that
future studies need to consider larger numbers of rats
collected at random from local populations. Moreover,
both non-synonymous and synonymous/intronic SNPs
should be assayed to enable tests for genetic hitchhiking.
Species misclassification must be ruled out before analyzing and interpreting SNP data.

genomic position where the resistance gene (i.e. vkorc1)
has been mapped [16,17]. The identification of the vkorc1
as the molecular target for anticoagulants [5-7,11] now
should enable the design of studies to verify selection at
the resolution of individual nucleotide sites, but such
studies need to be designed such to enable the application
of rigorous test for natural selection.

Hungary using the Fay and Wu normalized H statistic. Ref. [7] obtained synonymous variation for 3 of 12 rats available for that study.
Ile82Ile was detected in 3/3 of those rats. The non-synonymous polymorphism at high frequency is Tyr139Cys, occurring in 10/12 rats. We
simulate the number of additional rats with Ile82Ile that need to be
identified in the nine remaining unanalyzed rats to yield significance
for a selective sweep in this population. Significance levels 0.05 and
0.01 are indicated.

Conclusion
We have developed a PCR-based strategy to obtain
genomic sequence of the vkorc1 gene from the roof rat (R.
rattus). The primers developed should facilitate isolation
of the corresponding region in most rat species because
our approach worked equally well for the Norway rat, one
of the most divergent Rattus species. In addition to the
value of having the roof rat vkorc1 sequence available for
the design of genetic testing studies, we report examples
that illustrate the value of this sequence for the interpretation of SNPs that have been published for the Norway
rat. Inclusion of the roof rat sequence as a reference and
outgroup enabled the detection of SNPs in vkorc1 that
may not be of Norway rat origin but rather from roof rats
or other Rattus species.
The outgroup perspective provided by the roof rat
sequence allowed for exploration of selective neutrality
for vkorc1 polymorphisms. The SNP-based evidence
accumulated so far is insufficient to conclude with certainty that selection has acted upon any particular SNP in
the gene even though previous work based on microsatellite data had shown that the classical case of selection for
the resistance phenotype in rats can be detected at the

Animal material (tails stored in 70% ethanol) was collected from five small villages located within an ~30 km
radius in the area bordering the Arua and Nebbi Districts,
located ~300 km northwest of Kampala, Uganda, by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (Fort Collins, CO,
USA). We obtained nine rats (four R. rattus alexandrinus
and five R. r. frugivorus) from Jupakonja, nine rats from
Mawa/Angenja (5 R. r. al., 4 R. r. fr.), six rats from Oyaragada (3 R. r. al., 3 R. r. fr.), one R. r. fr. from Paganza and
one R. r. al. from Anyiku Villages. All animal-handling
procedures were performed according to protocol ACUC
#07-014 under which the field research is conducted as
approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Vector-Borne Diseases.
Two nominal subspecies of roof rat that are distinguished by their coat color were represented in our sample: R. rattus alexandrinus (R. r. al.; n = 13) with a brown
back and grey belly and R. rattus frugivorus (R. r. fr.; n =
13) with a brown back and cream belly. While subspecies
status based on coat coloration in roof rats has been
questioned [23,34], we nonetheless considered the presence of the two color morphs for two reasons. First, coat
color variation is evidence for genetic variation segregating in the population; therefore, by collected both
morphs we minimized the possibility of collecting an
inbred subset of the population with no expected SNPs in
the vkorc1 gene. Second, we investigated the possibility
that color morphs might be genetically differentiated
with respect to vkorc1-mediated tolerance.
DNA extraction and amplification

Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy® Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's
instructions. We observed that PCR from genomic DNA
isolated from tails often was of low yield or failed, which
was due to high concentrations of collagen in the DNA.
Samples worked satisfactorily by increasing the volume of
MgCl2 (to 3.3 μl) in the PCR mix and removing the skin
prior to DNA extraction. For initial PCR amplification of
the vkorc1 genomic region, five pairs of primers were
designed. Primer design was based on an alignment of
1000 bp upstream and downstream of the vkorc1 gene
from R. norvegicus (GenBank accession no. NC_005100)

and M. musculus (NC_000073). Forward (F) and reverse
(R) primers are as follows: VK1-F (5'-TGC AGC CTC
TCC AAC TAC AAT-3'), VK1-R (5'-ATG TGC CAC
CTC ACA AAC AA-3'), VK2-F (5'-GCC CTC TCA CTG
TAC GCA CT-3'), VK2-R (5'-TGG TGG AAG TGA AAG
AAS CA-3'), VK3-F (5'-GAG CCM TCK CAC CAA CTC
CT-3'), VK3-R (5'-CAA CCT GGA ATG TCT CC-3'),
VK4-F (5'-CTT TAG GTT TAG GTA GCC AGA GG-3'),
VK4-R (5'-CYA AGG CAA AGC AAG TYA KG-3'), VK5F (5'-TTK GGA GAC ATT CCA GGT TGA-3'), VK5-R
(5'-GTG YCA GGT TTT GCT GAC TA-3'). Using this
set of primers we obtained sufficient sequence data to
build contiguous consensus sequences of vkorc1 from R.
rattus. However, the process was inefficient in terms of
amplification and tedious in terms of the number of
amplicons and sequencing reactions required to cover the
genomic region.
The alignment of R. rattus (our data) and R. norvegicus
enabled the design of improved primers that more effectively and economically amplify the entire vkorc1
genomic region of R. rattus and R. norvegicus in three
overlapping segments (Rr1-F/R, Rr2-F/R and Rr3-F/R
primers; Figure 1).
PCR cycling conditions for primer pairs Rr1-F/R, Rr2F/R and Rr3-F/R were as follows: 94°C for 2 min 30 s, 31
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min, followed by an extension time of 72°C for 5 min, and idling
at 4°C for storage until processing. Each PCR mixture
contained 3 μl 5× Green GoTaq® (Promega, Madison WI,
USA), 0.5 μl of each 10 mM stock of F and R primer, 0.3 μl
dNTP (10 mM), 0.07 μl Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison WI, USA), 10 μl sterile deionized water, 1.8 μl DNA
and 1.8 μl MgCl2 (25 mM). PCR samples were cleaned
using ExoSAP-IT® (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH,
USA) prior to sequencing on an ABI Prism genetic analyzer sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA).
To confirm that our rat samples are roof rats (R. rattus)
we obtained sequences of the COI mtDNA gene (DNA
barcoding) for one sample of each nominal subspecies.
We followed the DNA barcoding protocol as described
[25]. CO1 sequence information for R. rattus (EF186585),
Norway rat (NC_001665), R. tanezumi (EF186623) and
the mouse (M. m. domesticus; NC_006914) were
retrieved from GenBank.

Sequences were assembled using the software package
LASERGENE 7.2 [35] and SNPs were confirmed by manual inspection. Finalized sequence alignments were generated using the Muscle algorithm [36] at standard
settings as implemented in the software package

and
HM181986-HM181987 (COI).
Protein sequence information for R. norvegicus
(NM_203335), R. losea (EF028346), R. flavipectus
(FJ868832), R. rattus (this study) and the house mouse
(M. musculus; BC031732) were retrieved from GenBank.
In addition, SNP data for 124 rats (presumed to be Norway rats; see Results) were downloaded (c.f. Table 1 for
SNP accession numbers) and assembled into sequences
assuming that data published in [7] represent haplotypes/
homozygous genotypes. Unfortunately no information
(e.g., heterozygosity of SNPs) was provided to enable better-informed inferences from published sequence data.
Gene trees were reconstructed for the vkorc1 coding
region and CO1 using the Bayesian method as implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2. The Bayesian inference utilized
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations in
combination with the best Model (HKY+G) [38] in
MODELTEST 3.7 [39]). Four chains were set to run
simultaneously for 1,000,000 generations during the
MCMC process, with trees being sampled every 100 generations. After eliminating the first 1,000 trees as burnins, a majority-rule consensus tree was constructed with
nodal values representing the posterior probability.
Population genetic analyses were conducted with the
software package DnaSP v5. [40] and Arlequin 3.0 [41].
These included analysis of genetic differentiation/gene
flow calculated as FST, the MacDonald-Kreitman test for
selection and basic and composite measures of polymorphism data (θ, π, Tajima's D). If an outgroup perspective
was needed the Norway rat was used to polarize mutational change in the roof rat, and the roof rat was used to
polarize mutational changes in the Norway rat. As we
describe in the Results section, we used the findings from
the phylogenetic analysis to detect contamination of the
vkorc1 SNP dataset for the Norway rat with SNPs that
must originate from roof rats.
The Fay and Wu test [42],; http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/jflab/htest.html, accessed March 2010] was
performed with 5000 coalescent simulations, assuming
no back mutation and recombination. Under these
parameter settings the test is particularly sensitive to
detect selection. We opted for these parameter settings
because the data are too limited to apply less sensitive
and more conservative parameter settings at this time.
We suggest that future studies testing for selection on
more comprehensive samples should apply more conservative parameter settings, namely, they should consider
recombination.

Additional material
Additional file 1 DNA nucleotide variation in the vkorc1 protein coding region. Shown are variable (polymorphic/divergent) amino acid positions (aa position) and variable nucleotide positions (nt position provided
relative to the start codon) for the coding region (E1-E3) of vkorc1. Non-synonymous mutations are labeled as nucleotide change followed by resulting
amino acid change. We provide the consensus amino acid and DNA
sequences for the roof rat, as deduced from five genotypes (H1-H5)
obtained by sequencing the specimens assigned, based on coat color, as
two nominal subspecies R. rattus alexandrinus or R. r. frugivorus. The
sequences of R. flavipectus and R. losea are provided. Note three polymorphisms in R. losea (Ser35Cys, Ser58Gly, Cys96Cys) are not depicted.
Sequences reconstructed from SNP data for the published vkorc1 coding
sequence [7] are shown as part of a group we call R. rattus/other Rattus and
R. rattus-like and as R. norvegicus. The published sequence from R. norvegicus, as retrieved from GenBank and Ensembl, was used to aid identification
of 'genuine' R. norvegicus sequences/SNPs. These groupings were defined
based on phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3). The mouse sequence (M. musculus domesticus) is provided for reference. The bottom panel (ss#) lists the
SNP accession numbers [7]. Note the Ser56Pro SNP was not published
(Table 1 in [7]) but was reported as a SNP in R. norvegicus without referring
to the source population analyzed. A SNP underlying the Leu120Gln variant
has been published [11], but for a population not included in the previous
study [7]. Sample origins are denoted as follows [7]: USA/Santa Cruz
