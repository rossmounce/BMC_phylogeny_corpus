Abstract
Background: Kocuria, previously classified into the genus of Micrococcus, is commonly found on
human skin. Two species, K. rosea and K. kristinae, are etiologically associated with catheter-related
bacteremia.
Case presentation: We describe the first case of K. kristinae infection associated with acute
cholecystitis. The microorganism was isolated from the bile of a 56-year old Chinese man who
underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He developed post-operative fever that resolved readily
after levofloxacin treatment.
Conclusion: Our report of K. kristinae infection associated with acute cholecystitis expands the
clinical spectrum of infections caused by this group of bacteria. With increasing number of recent
reports describing the association between Kocuria spp. and infectious diseases, the significance of
their isolation from clinical specimens cannot be underestimated. A complete picture of infections
related to Kocuria spp. will have to await the documentation of more clinical cases.

Background
Kocuria is a member of the Micrococcaceae family and consists of nine species. It was previously classified into the
genus of Micrococcus, but was dissected from Micrococcus
based on phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analysis [1].
The organism is widespread in nature and is frequently
found as normal skin flora in humans and other mammals. Documented cases of infections due to Kocuria spp.
are limited. The type species K. rosea has been reported to
cause catheter-related bacteremia [2]. Another member of
the genus, K. kristinae (previously known as Micrococcus
kristinae), was first described in 1974 [3]. This organism is
an aerobic, gram-positive coccus occurring in tetrads, and

the majority of strains are non-pathogenic. Clinically similar to K. rosea, a single case of catheter-related bacteremia
due to K. kristinae has been reported in a patient with
ovarian cancer [4]. Here we report the first case of K. kristinae isolated from bile in a patient with acute cholecystitis.

Case presentation
A 56-year old Chinese man, who had a known history of
asymptomatic gallstones, presented with right upper
quadrant abdominal pain for five days associated with
fever. Laboratory investigations showed neutrophilia, but
the liver function test was normal. Ultrasound examina-

tion of the abdomen revealed distended gallbladder associated with multiple gallstones, prominent intrahepatic
ducts and enlarged lymph nodes at the porta hepatitis
region. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed for a
diagnosis of acute cholecystitis showed distended and
gross thickened gallbladder and omental adhesions. The
bile was turbid and two stones were found impacted at the
Hartmann's pouch. The cystic duct was normal. The
patient developed post-operative fever and intravenous
levofloxacin at a dosage of 500 mg daily was started as
empirical treatment. Bile culture subsequently yielded a
pure growth of K. kristinae (see microbiology diagnosis).
Fever resolved readily after levofloxacin therapy, which
was continued orally at the same dosage for a total duration of 14 days. He made an uneventful recovery.

Microbiological diagnosis
Culture of bile from gall bladder was performed with
sheep blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar.
The plates were incubated at 35°C for 48 hours. Anaerobic culture was performed using Schaedler blood agar and
incubated at 35°C for 48 hours. Gram-positive cocci
arranged in tetrads were isolated from pale cream colonies
after two days incubation. The organism was non-hemolytic, catalase positive, coagulase negative and nonmotile. Identification was performed using Biomerieux
ID32 Staph ATB system and BD Phoenix PMC/ID-13 system. The isolate was identified as Kocuria kristinae with a
probability of identification of 99.9 % and confidence
value of 99% for the ATB system and Phoenix system
respectively. Identification of the isolate was confirmed
using 16S rRNA sequencing (MicroSeq™, Applied Biosystems, USA), as misidentification of coagulase-negative
staphylococci as Kocuria species has been described [5].
Analysis of nucleotide sequence with BLAST programs
showed 100% DNA sequence homology with K. kristinae.
Antibiotic sensitivity test was performed using the disc diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (formerly NCCLS) guidelines for Staphylococcus. The isolate was sensitive to penicillin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, linezolid, trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and levofloxacin.

Discussion
Members of the genus Micrococcus are found as normal
flora of the skin and mucosa. Infections related to Micrococcus spp. are uncommon but are recognized, especially in
immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases.
The organism M. luteus has been described as the causative
agent in meningitis [6], intracranial abscess [7], arthritis
[8], pneumonia [9] and catheter-related sepsis in patients
undergoing hemodialysis [10] or leukaemia treatment
[11]. Other infections associated with Micrococcus and
related organisms include continuous ambulatory dialysis
peritonitis [12], endocarditis [13] and infection of cere-

brospinal fluid shunts [14]. More recently, Micrococcus
spp. is implicated in central venous catheter infection in
patients with pulmonary hypertension receiving continuous epoprostenol infusion [15,16].
Kocuria is previously classified as Micrococcus and, being
inhabitants of the skin, it is not surprising that K. rosea
and K. kristinae have been incriminated as pathogens
causing catheter-related bacteremia [2,4]. Misidentification of coagulase negative staphylococcus as Kocuria using
standard biochemical analysis is not uncommon due to
phenotypic variability [5]. The utilization of genotypic
assay such as 16s rRNA is required to confirm species
identity as in the present case may be required, particularly for unusual clinical scenarios. The K. kristinae organism isolated in our patient was sensitive to most of the
commonly used antibiotics. A report in the literature on
219 strains of Kocuria and Micrococcus shows that most
strains are sensitive to doxycycline, cetriaxone, cefuroxime, amikacin, and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, but
most are resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin [17].
The duration of therapy in general depends on site and
severity of infection. If bacteremia is present or likely,
duration of 10 – 14 days is commonly employed.
Bile cultures are sterile in 25 – 50% of acutely inflamed
gallbladders. Bacterial infection in acute cholecystitis is
usually a secondary event, and is most commonly due to
enteric bacteria. A recent study from the Netherlands on
microbes isolated from bile after cholecystectomy [18]
showed a predominance of Escherichia coli, followed by
Klebsiella spp. and Streptococcus spp. Significantly, two studies on infective complications after open [18,19] and
laparoscopic cholecystectomy showed no correlation
between positive bile culture and post-operative infection.
These findings, together with the lower incidence of
wound infections after laparoscopic cholecystectomy,
would cast doubt on the use of routine antibiotics prophylaxis as recommended for biliary surgery. However, the
development of post-operative fever in our patient necessitated the use of empirical antibiotic cover. Levofloxacin
used in the present case is a third generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity,
which has been shown to give adequate serum and gallbladder tissue concentrations in biliary tract surgery [20].
We describe the first case of K. kristinae infection associated with acute cholecystitis. Interestingly, a related skin
commensal Staphylococcus aureus has been recognized as
the primary pathogen in unusual cases of acute cholecystitis [21]. S. aureus associated acute cholecystitis might be
encountered in the clinical setting of bacteremia due to
infective endocarditis or nosocomial acquisition in
patients with chronic medical conditions [21]. While
unfortunately a blood culture was not taken in our

patient, the presence of gallstone, good pre-morbid status
and prompt resolution of fever after antibiotics would
point against a possible endovascular focus of infection.

Conclusion
Although previously regarded as an innocuous microorganism, there have been a number of recent reports
describing the association between Kocuria spp. and infectious diseases. The complete clinical spectrum of infections caused by this group of bacteria will be more
apparent after the report of more cases. The physician
should not therefore underestimate the importance of K.
kristinae when isolated from clinical specimens.
