Identification of one critical amino acid that
determines a conformational neutralizing epitope
in the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2
Li P Huang, Yue H Lu, Yan W Wei, Long J Guo and Chang M Liu*

Abstract
Background: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome
(PMWS) in pigs. Currently, there is considerable interest in the immunology of PCV2; in particular, the
immunological properties of the capsid protein. This protein is involved in PCV2 immunogenicity and is a potential
target for vaccine development. In this study, we identified one critical amino acid that determines a
conformational neutralizing epitope in the capsid protein of PCV2.
Results: One monoclonal antibody (mAb; 8E4), against the capsid protein of PCV2, was generated and
characterized in this study. 8E4 reacted with the genotype PCV2a (CL, LG and JF2) strains but not PCV2b (YJ, SH
and JF) strains by an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and a capture ELISA. Furthermore, the mAb had
the capacity to neutralize PCV2a (CL, LG and JF2) strains but not PCV2b (YJ, SH and JF) strains. One critical amino
acid that determined a conformational neutralizing epitope was identified using mAb 8E4 and PCV2 infectious
clone technique. Amino acid residues 47-72 in the capsid protein of PCV2a/CL were replaced with the
corresponding region of PCV2b/YJ, and the reactivity of mAb 8E4 was lost. Further experiments demonstrated that
one amino acid substitution, the alanine for arginine at position 59 (A59R) in the capsid protein of PCV2a (CL, LG
and JF2) strains, inhibited completely the immunoreactivity of three PCV2a strains with mAb 8E4.
Conclusions: It is concluded that the alanine at position 59 in the capsid protein of PCV2a (CL, LG and JF2) strains
is a critical amino acid, which determines one neutralizing epitope of PCV2a (CL, LG and JF2) strains. This study
provides valuable information for further in-depth mapping of the conformational neutralizing epitope,
understanding antigenic difference among PCV2 strains, and development of a useful vaccine for control of PCV2associated disease.

Background
Porcine circovirus (PCV) is the smallest virus that replicates autonomously in mammalian cells. The viral genome consists of a covalently closed, circular, ambisense,
single-stranded DNA molecule [1]. Two types of PCV (1
and 2), have been characterized to date [2]. PCV1 is a
persistent contaminant of porcine kidney (PK)-15 cell
lines and it is not considered to be pathogenic [3]. In
contrast, PCV2 has been detected consistently in pigs

with PCV-associated diseases such as post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [4].
The genome of PCV2 contains at least two open reading frames (ORFs) with known functions: ORF1 codes
for two replicase proteins, and ORF2 for the structural
capsid protein [5]. The capsid protein is the only structural protein and the major protein involved in immunogenicity. At least five overlapping conformational
epitopes of PCV2 capsid protein, within residues 47-85,
165-200 and 230-233, have been mapped in chimeric
PCV1 and PCV2 [6]. The conformational epitopes
recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing activity against PCV2 have been determined in
the transfected PK-15 cells, and residues 231-233 participate in the formation of conformational epitopes [7].

Phylogenetic analysis distinguishes three genotypes of
PCV2 (a, b and c) [8]. PCV2a and PCV2b are found in
many countries, whereas PCV2c is only found in Denmark [9]. Recent epidemiological studies in many countries have linked a shift from infection with PCV2a to
PCV2b [9-12]. Although several studies have indicated
that PCV2b is not more pathogenic than PCV2a [13],
field experience suggests that the PCV2b genotype is
more virulent [11]. However, to date, there are no confirmed conclusions about which genotype is more
pathogenic.
Mouse mAbs directed against PCV2 have shown some
differences in reactivity with different PCV2 strains
[7,14]. MAbs (with different reactivity with different
strains) have been used to identify critical amino acids
of conformational epitopes [15,16]. However, other critical amino acids of the conformational epitope with neutralizing activity against PCV2 capsid protein have not
been identified.
In this study, one mAb against the capsid protein of
PCV2 was produced and characterized. Meanwhile, one
key amino acid constituent of the conformational epitope was identified by using chimeras and mutants of
PCV2a/CL and PCV2b/YJ strains.

PCV2a/LG strain was produced by Liu et al. [17]. Six
different PCV2 strains adapted to PK-15 cells were used
in this study. Their origins, genotypes and GenBank
accession numbers are shown in Table 1. A recombinant virus designated as recPCV1/G was rescued from
the infectious clone (data not show). The genome of
this virus was amplified from contaminated PK-15 cells
by PCV1. GenBank accession number of this virus is
JN398656.
Porcine serum with antibodies against PCV2a/LG
(PCV2-positive serum) and porcine serum with antibodies against recPCV1/G (PCV1-positive serum), along
with porcine serum lacking specific antibodies against
PCV1 and PCV2 (PCV negative serum) were derived
from Huang et al. [18]. It was confirmed that mAb
6F10, against the epitope in the nuclear location signal
region of PCV2 capsid protein, did not react with PK-15
cells infected with PCV2, and did not have the capacity
to neutralize PCV2 [18,19].
Preparation of mAb against PCV2 capsid protein

The production of one new mAb against the capsid protein of PCV2 was performed as described previously
[18]. The isotype of the mAb was determined using a
Mouse MonoAb-ID Kit (HRP) (Invitrogen).

Methods
Cells, viruses and antibodies

Western blot analysis

Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), used for expression of the recombinant capsid protein of PCV2a/LG, were grown in Grace’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA-Strasse, Pasching, Austria) and 0.26% trypsin phosphate bean soup
(Sigma-Aldrich, NY, USA) at 27°C. PCV1-free PK-15
cells, grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, were used for virus
propagation. SP2/0 cells, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, were used for preparation of
mAbs.
A high-titer seed recombinant baculovirus that
expressed recombinant capsid protein derived from

The reactivity of mAb 8E4 to PCV2a/LG strain was
determined by western blot analysis as described previously [18]. MAb 6F10 and the supernatant of SP2/0
cells were used as positive and negative controls,
respectively.
Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA)

The IPMA was used to detect the reactivity of mAb 8E4
to six PCV2 strains and one PCV1 strain. Briefly, the
96-well IPMA plates containing cells infected with
PCV2a/LG, PCV2a/CL, PCV2a/JF2, PCV2b/YJ, PCV2b/
SH, PCV2b/JF, recPCV1/G, and mock-infected cells,
were produced and stored at -20°C as described by Liu
et al. [17]. The staining procedure was similar to the

IPMA technique described previously [18]. MAb 8E4
was used as primary antibody. PCV2- or PCV1-positive
serum and mAb 6F10 (with no reactivity to PCV2infected cells in the IPMA) were used respectively as
positive and negative controls. The results were examined under an inverted light microscope. The IPMA was
performed in triplicate.
Serum neutralization assays

To detect the neutralizing activity of mAb 8E4, a serum
neutralization assay was adapted from the method of
Lefebvre et al. [14]. Briefly, 104.3 × TCID50 (50% tissue
culture infective dose) of PCV2 in a volume of 200 μl
was incubated for 1 h at 37°C, with an equal volume of
undiluted hybridoma supernatant containing mAb
against the PCV2 capsid protein. After incubation, this
mixture was added to semi-confluent monolayers of
PCV-negative PK-15 cells in four wells of a 96-well
plate. After 1 h at 37°C, the cell cultures were washed
twice with RPMI 1640 and fresh medium was added.
The cell cultures were incubated for a further 36 h at
37°C, then detected using the IPMA as described by Liu
et al. [17] with PCV2-positive serum. Assays were performed with six different strains of PCV2 (PCV2a/LG,
PCV2a/CL, PCV2a/JF2, PCV2b/SH, PCV2b/YJ and
PCV2b/JF) and recPCV1/G. PCV2-positive sera and
mAb 6F10 (with no neutralization to PCV2) were used
as positive and negative controls, respectively. The number of infected cells per well was determined by light
microscopy. The neutralizing activity of the hybridoma
supernatant was expressed as the percentage reduction
in the number of infected cells in comparison with
negative control. A mAb was considered to have neutralizing ability when its mean neutralizing activity was >
50%.
Capture ELISA

To develop a PCV2 antigen capture ELISA, the PCV2positive serum and the supernatant of mAb 8E4 were
purified using protein A Sepharose™CL-4B (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), respectively. The purified mAb
8E4 was labeled using a peroxidase labeling kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ELISA plates (Nunc, Glostrup,
Denmark) were coated with purified PCV2-positive
serum (5 μg/ml) in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6)
overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed three times
with PBS-T and blocked with 100 μl of PBS-T with 10%
horse serum for 1 h at 37°C. One hundred microliters
of the PCV2 strain cultures diluted in PBS-T to a final
105 TCID50/ml were distributed in each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After washing with PBS-T, 100 μl
mAb (8E4) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) diluted (1:500) in PBS-T was added, and the

plates were incubated at 37°C for 45 min. After the
plates had been washed three times, the colorimetric
reaction was developed for 20 min by adding 0.21 mg/
ml 2,2-azino-di [3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid] in
0.1 M citrate (pH 4.2) containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (substrate ABTS). The reaction was stopped by
adding 50 μl 1% NaF. The optical density (OD) was
measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Assays were performed with cultures of six different strains of PCV2 (PCV2a/LG,
PCV2a/CL, PCV2a/JF2, PCV2b/SH, PCV2b/YJ and
PCV2b/JF), recPCV1/G and mock-infected PK-15 cells
(negative control). The capture ELISA was performed in
triplicate. A P (virus strain)/N (negative control) value >
2.1 was considered positive.
Analysis of ORF2 from different strains

Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences in the capsid protein of six strains of PCV2 (PCV2a/LG, PCV2a/
CL, PCV2a/JF2, PCV2b/SH, PCV2b/YJ and PCV2b/JF)
were performed using Clustal W within the DNASTAR
software (version 7.0).
Construction of PCV2-ORF2-CL/YJ chimeras and mutants

Plasmids pMD18/PCV2a-CL, pMD18/PCV2b-YJ and
pMD18/PCV2a-LG, containing the complete genomic
sequences of the PCV2a/CL, PCV2b/YJ and PCV2a/LG
strains, were constructed as described previously [20,21].
Plasmid pMD18/PCV2a-JF2 containing entire genomic
sequences of PCV2a/JF2 strain was constructed as
described by Guo et al. [20] with primers Q-R and Q-F
(Table 2). A series of chimeric pMD/PCV2- ORF2-CL/
YJ (Figure 1a) containing regions deletion of pMD/
PCV2-CL-ORF2 fused with the corresponding ORF2
regions of YJ-ORF2 were constructed by fusion PCR or
mutation PCR. Briefly, the pMD18/PCV2a-CL templates
were respectively PCR-amplified using primers A-F and
A-R, C-F and C-R, E-F and E-R, or G-F and G-R (Table
2) according to the instructions that accompany the
KOD-plus kit (Toyobo, Japan). Those PCR products
that did not contain regions (aa 47-72, 80-94, 110-154
or 190-210) of PCV2a/CL capsid protein were respectively gel purified, and subsequently served as the templates for fusion PCR using primers B-F and B-R, D-F
and D-R, F-F and F-R, or H-F and H-R (Table 2), which
inserted the corresponding regions of PCV2b/YJ capsid
protein. The fusion PCR products were then used to
transform Escherichia coli strain Top10 according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (Takara, Dalian,
China). The resulting chimeric plasmids were verified by
sequence analyses (BGI, Beijing, China) and were
respectively designated as rCL-YJ-1, rCL-YJ-2, rCL-YJ-3
and rCL-YJ-4 (Figure 1a). Mutations were introduced
into the pMD/PCV2a-CL-ORF2, pMD/PCV2a-LG-

identified with the Mouse MonoAb-ID Kit (HRP). It was
determined that the isotype and light chain of 8E4 was
IgG2a and l type, respectively.
The reactivity of mAb 8E4 with PCV2a/LG strain purified by ultracentrifugation was determined by western
blot analysis (Figure 2). MAb 6F10 (positive control)
gave a strong and specific reaction with the 28-kDa capsid protein of PCV2. However, mAb 8E4 did not give a
positive reaction. No reaction was observed with the
culture supernatant of SP2/0 cells, used as a negative
control.
Reactivity of mAb 8E4 with different PCV2 strains

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of PCV2 ORF2 chimeras and
mutants and their reactivity with PCV2-positive serum and
mAb 8E4. (a) PCV2 clones rCL-ORF2 and rYJ-ORF2 contained the
complete 233 aa sequence of PCV2a/CL-ORF2 and the 235 aa
sequence of PCV2b/YJ-ORF2, respectively. Five chimeras that
consisted of aa 47-72 (rCL-YJ-1), 80-94 (rCL-YJ-2), 110-154 (rCL-YJ-3),
190-210 (rCL-YJ-4) and 230-235 (rCL-YJ-5) of the PCV2a/CL capsid
protein were replaced with corresponding regions of the PCV2b/YJ
capsid protein. (b) For the second set of constructs, four mutants
containing single amino acid mutations of PCV2a/CL-ORF2 at
positions 51 (rCL-YJ-1-51), 57 (rCL-YJ-1-57), 59 (rCL-YJ-1-59) and 63
(rCL-YJ-1-63) were substituted for the corresponding amino acids of
the PCV2b/YJ capsid protein at the same position. (c) PCV2 clones
rLG-ORF2 and rJF2-ORF2 contained the complete 233 aa sequences
of PCV2a/LG-ORF2 and the 236 aa sequences of PCV2a/JF2-ORF2,
respectively. The PCV2 mutants rLG-YJ-1-59 and rJF2-YJ-1-59
contained a single amino acid mutation from alanine to arginine at
position 59 (A59R) in the capsid protein of PCV2a/LG and PCV2a/
JF2, respectively. The last mutant rYJ-CL-1-59 contained a single
amino acid mutation of arginine for alanine at position 59 (R59A) in
the capsid protein of PCV2b/YJ. The IPMA reactivity between each
antibody and PK-15 cells transfected with each PCV2 construct is
indicated next to each construct. The IPMA reactivity of the
constructs in transfected PK-15 cells was demonstrated by PCV2positive serum and mAb 8E4. +: Positive; -: Negative.

The IPMA was used to examine the reactivity of mAb
8E4 with six different PCV2 strains and recPCV1/G.
The PCV2-positive serum stained all the PCV2 strains
(Figure 3a, odd numbers), whereas the PCV1-positive
serum stained the recPCV1/G antigen. MAb 8E4 stained
PCV2a/LG, PCV2a/CL and PCV2a/JF2 antigens, and did
not stain PCV2b/SH, PCV2b/YJ, PCV2b/JF antigens
(Figure 3a, even numbers) or the recPCV1/G antigen.
A serum neutralization assay was used to determine
the neutralizing activity of mAb 8E4. 8E4 possessed neutralizing activity for PCV2a/LG, PCV2a/CL and PCV2a/
JF2. Figure 3b shows the percentage neutralization of
8E4 against different PCV2 strains and recPCV1/G. A

subsequently transfected into PK-15 cells (80-90% confluency) in each well of a 24-well plate, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Mock-transfected PK-15 cells were regarded
as the negative control. After incubation for 6 h at 37°C,
400 μl RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS was added to each
well and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. At 48 h post
transfection, the cells were tested in the IPMA with
PCV2-positive serum and mAb 8E4.

Figure 3 Reactivity of six PCV2 isolates with mAb 8E4 by the IPMA, serum neutralization assay and capture ELISA. (a) IPMA reactivity of
PK-15 cells inoculated with PCV2a/LG (1 and 2), PCV2a/CL (3 and 4), PCV2a/JF2 (5 and 6), PCV2b/YJ (7 and 8), PCV2b/SH (9 and 10) and PCV2b/
JF (11 and 12), against PCV2-positive serum and mAb 8E4. Odd numbers represent PCV2-positive serum, whereas even numbers show mAb 8E4.
(b) The neutralizing activity of mAb 8E4 was expressed as the percentage reduction in the number of infected cells in comparison with negative
control. A mean neutralizing activity of > 50% was considered to represent neutralization. Error bars represent the standard deviations. (c) For
the capture ELISA, cultures of six PCV2 isolates, recPCV1/G and PK-15 cells were tested with HRP-conjugated 8E4. P/N > 2.1 was regarded as a
positive result. Error bars represent the standard deviations.

mAb was considered to be neutralizing when its mean
neutralizing activity was > 50%. MAb 8E4 that reacted
equally with three PCV2a strains in IPMA demonstrated
neutralization of PCV2a/LG (up to 96%), PCV2a/CL (up
to 96%) and PCV2a/JF-2 (up to 97%). However, mAb
8E4 did not neutralize the other three PCV2b strains or
recPCV1/G.
A capture ELISA was used to determine whether mAb
8E4 reacted with virions of different PCV2 strains.
Among the six PCV2 strains, three (PCV2a/LG, PCV2a/
CL, and PCV2a/JF2) produced a positive signal (P/N≥25),
whereas PCV2b/SH, PCV2b/YJ, PCV2b/JF and recPCV1/
G produced a negative signal (P/N < 2.1) (Figure 3c).
Analysis of ORF2 from different PCV2 strains

The similarity of the capsid proteins of six different strains
used in this study was determined using pairwise alignments and the Clustal W method. There was high amino
acid identity of the capsid protein among isolates of
PCV2a (≥95.7%) and PCV2b (≥96.6%) respectively, while
there was only 88% - 90.2% amino acid identity of the capsid protein between PCV2a and PCV2b (Table 3). On the
basis of the alignment shown in Figure 4, five regions (aa
47-72, 80-94, 110-154, 190-211 and 230-235) were chosen
for construction of PCV2-ORF2-CL/YJ chimeras that
included amino acids that differed between them.

serum recognized the antigens produced by all four
clones and thus served as a positive transfection control.
However, mAb 8E4 did not react with the antigen produced by clone rYJ-ORF2 (Figure 1). These results
demonstrated that mAb 8E4 reacted with the capsid
protein of PCV2a (CL, LG and JF2), but not PCV2b/YJ.

To identify the antigenic sites recognized by mAb 8E4
on the capsid protein of PCV2a/CL further, four PCV2ORF2-CL/YJ mutants (rCL-YJ-1-51, rCL-YJ-1-57, rCLYJ-1-59 and rCL-YJ-1-63), in which the amino acids 51,

Reactivity of chimeras with PCV2-positive serum and mAb
8E4

To identify the antigenic sites (corresponding to mAb
8E4) on the capsid protein of PCV2, four PCV2-ORF2CL/YJ chimeras and one mutant were constructed in
which the five regions of PCV2a/CL-ORF2 were
replaced with the corresponding regions of PCV2b/YJORF2 (Figure 1a). The IPMA reactivity of these chimeras with PCV2-positive serum and mAb 8E4 is
shown in Figure 1a. PCV2-positive serum reacted
strongly with all of the chimeras. MAb 8E4, which
recognized the PCV2a/CL capsid protein, reacted with
chimeras rCL-YJ-2, rCL-YJ-3, rCL-YJ-4 and rCL-YJ-5,
but not with rCL-YJ-1 (Figure 5b-e and 5a). When residues 47-72 of PCV2a/CL-ORF2 in chimera rCL-YJ-1
were replaced with those of PCV2b/YJ-ORF2, mAb 8E4
lost its reactivity with the rCL-YJ-1 chimeric capsid protein. This indicates that aa 47-72 are important for the
recognition of mAb 8E4.

57, 59 and 63 of PCV2a/CL-ORF2 were replaced,
respectively, with the corresponding amino acid of
PCV2b/YJ-ORF2, were constructed (Figure 1b). The
reactivity of PCV2-positive serum and mAb 8E4 to
these mutants in the IPMA is summarized in Figure 1b.
PCV2-positive serum produced strong signals with all of
the mutants, which indicates that the mutants are infectious and can replicate in PK-15 cells. MAb 8E4 reacted
strongly with mutants rCL-YJ-1-51, rCL-YJ-1-57 and
rCL-YJ-1-63, but did not react with rCL-YJ-1-59 (Figure
5f, g, i and 5h), in which alanine (A) at position 59 of
PCV2a/CL-ORF2 was replaced with arginine (R) of
PCV2b/YJ-ORF2.
In order to determine whether the amino acid residue
A at position 59 is important for the binding of mAb
8E4 to the capsid protein of the other two strains of
PCV2a (PCV2a/LG and PCV2a/JF2), two mutants (rLGYJ-1-59 and rJF2-YJ-1-59) that contained a single mutation of A to R at position 59 in the capsid protein of
PCV2a/LG-ORF2 and PCV2a/JF2-ORF2, respectively,
were constructed (Figure 1c). The reactivity of PCV2positive serum and mAb 8E4 to these mutants in the
IPMA is summarized in Figure 1c. PCV2-positive serum
produced strong signals with the two mutants, whereas
there was no reactivity with mAb 8E4 (Figure 5j and
5k).
Another mutant was then generated in the PCV2/YJORF2 background that contained a single mutation of R
to A at position 59 of capsid protein (Figure 1c, rYJ-CL1-59). The PCV2-positive serum produced a strong signal with the mutant, however, mAb 8E4 did not produce a positive reaction (Figure 5l).

Discussion
Several studies have suggested that genetic differences in
PCV2 are associated with the geographical region from
which the isolates originated, and a classification system
that has been proposed divides PCV2 into three genotypes (a, b and c); a and b are the two major genotypes
of PCV2 [8,22-26], but c is only isolated in Demark [9].
Therefore, PCV2c was not used in the present study.
Until now, only one serotype has been identified among
strains of PCV2. However, mAbs directed against PCV2
(except PCV2c) have shown some differences in reactivity with different PCV2 strains [7,14].
MAb 8E4 generated in the present study reacted with
PCV2a (LG, CL and JF2), by the IPMA and capture
ELISA, and had the capacity to neutralize PCV2a (LG,
CL and JF2). Therefore, using mAb 8E4, three strains of
PCV2a could be differentiated from three PCV2b
strains. However, mAb 8E4 did not give a positive reaction by western blot analysis. Thus, the above results
suggest that mAb 8E4 recognizes a conformational epitope in the capsid protein of PCV2.

There were several regions of diversity identified by
alignment of the amino acid sequences of the capsid
protein between PCV2a and PCV2b strains in the present study. The first 46 residues at the N terminus of
the capsid protein are probably not involved in the formation of conformational epitopes. This region contains
residues rich in basic amino acids and thus may be
involved in the formation of the interior surface of the
virion, and may interact with the negative charges of
genomic DNA during virus assembly, as reported for
many icosahedral viruses [27-29]. Amino acids from
residue 47 to the C terminus within the capsid protein
may be important for formation of PCV2 capsid protein.
Several epitopes in the PCV2 capsid protein that are
involved in reactions with antibodies are also within this
range [6,7,30]. Therefore, five regions (aa 47-72, 80-94,
110-154, 190-211 and 230-235) were chosen for construction of PCV2-ORF2-CL/YJ chimeras that included
amino acids that differed between PCV2a and PCV2b.
A chimera in which 230PLKP233 of the C terminus of
PCV2a/CL-Cap was replaced by 230PLNLNE235 of the C
terminus of the PCV2b/YJ-Cap was constructed to analyze whether elongation of the C terminus affected the
conformational neutralizing epitope against mAb 8E4.
Elongation of the C terminus by two amino acids did
not change the reactivity of mAb 8E4 against PCV2a/CL
in the IPMA (Figure 1a). Furthermore, rJF2-ORF2,
derived from PCV2a/JF2, in which the C terminus was
elongated by three amino acids, had the same reactivity
with mAb 8E4 as rCL-ORF2 and rCL-YJ-5 in the IPMA
(Figure 1c).
In previous studies, analysis of the reactivity of PCV1/
PCV2 chimeras has suggested that the amino acid
sequences from aa 47-62 and 165-200, as well as the
last four C-terminal amino acids of the capsid protein,
are likely to be in close proximity and may form a cluster of conformational epitopes on the surface of the
PCV2 virion [6]. In the present study, the replacement
of an amino acid residue (A59R) in the capsid protein
altered the reaction of PCV2a (LG, CL, and JF2) with
mAb 8E4. Therefore, it could be concluded that the alanine at position 59 was a critical amino acid in the conformational neutralizing epitope recognized by mAb
8E4. Alanine is a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid with
a molecular weight (MW) of 89 Da, whereas arginine is
a polar basic hydrophilic amino acid with a MW of 174.
Due to the differences in size, charge and hydrophobicity between alanine and arginine, this may have major
consequences on the secondary and tertiary structure of
the PCV2 capsid protein. Therefore, it could be concluded that the replacement of an amino acid residue
(A59R) in the capsid protein of PCV2a (CL, LG and
JF2) disrupted the binding of mAb 8E4 completely.
Furthermore, the amino acid at position 59 is located

Huang et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:188
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/188

on loop BC of the capsid protein [31]. This loop
together with loop DE and HI are on the exterior surface of the PCV2 to form the highest protrusion [31].
Therefore, this position may be more easily recognized
by B cell receptor and with a high possibility to become
a conformational B cell epitope.
It was confirmed that another mutant (rYJ-CL-1-59),
which contained a single amino acid mutation of R to A
at position 59, did not have the ability to react with
mAb 8E4. We suggest that the amino acid at position
59 of capsid protein is a necessary but not sufficient
residue for epitope recognition by mAb 8E4. The 3D
structure of capsid protein and mAb 8E4 complex
should be studied to gain full knowledge of the conformational epitope against mAb 8E4.

Conclusions
In summary, a mAb (8E4) with neutralizing activity
could be used to differentiate PCV2a strains (CL, LG,
and JF2) from other PCV2b strains (YJ, SH and JF).
These results confirm that there are antigenic differences among PCV2 strains [14]. Furthermore, reverse
genetics were used to explore the genetic basis of the
different reactions of PCV2a/CL and PCV2b/YJ with
mAb 8E4. Evidence is presented that the amino acid at
position 59 of PCV2a (CL, LG, and JF2) capsid proteins
is a critical amino acid in the conformational neutralizing epitope recognized by mAb 8E4. This study may
provide valuable information for further in-depth mapping of the conformational neutralizing epitope, understanding antigenic difference among PCV2 strains, and
development of a useful vaccine for control of PCV2associated disease.
