Abstract
Background: Rapidly accumulating genome sequence data from multiple species offer powerful
opportunities for the detection of DNA sequence evolution. Phylogenetic tree construction and
codon-based tests for natural selection are the prevailing tools used to detect functionally
important evolutionary change in protein coding sequences. These analyses often require multiple
DNA sequence alignments that maintain the correct reading frame for each collection of putative
orthologous sequences. Since this feature is not available in most alignment tools, codon reading
frames often must be checked manually before evolutionary analyses can commence.
Results: Here we report an online codon-preserved alignment tool (OCPAT) that generates
multiple sequence alignments automatically from the coding sequences of any list of human gene
IDs and their putative orthologs from genomes of other vertebrate tetrapods. OCPAT is
programmed to extract putative orthologous genes from genomes and to align the orthologs with
the reading frame maintained in all species. OCPAT also optimizes the alignment by trimming the
most variable alignment regions at the 5' and 3' ends of each gene. The resulting output of
alignments is returned in several formats, which facilitates further molecular evolutionary analyses
by appropriate available software. Alignments are generally robust and reliable, retaining the
correct reading frame. The tool can serve as the first step for comparative genomic analyses of
protein-coding gene sequences including phylogenetic tree reconstruction and detection of natural
selection. We aligned 20,658 human RefSeq mRNAs using OCPAT. Most alignments are missing
sequence(s) from at least one species; however, functional annotation clustering of the ~1700
transcripts that were alignable to all species shows that genes involved in multi-subunit protein
complexes are highly conserved.
Conclusion: The OCPAT program facilitates large-scale evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses
of entire biological processes, pathways, and diseases.

Background
Multi-species comparisons offer a powerful way to identify functionally important DNA elements that are associated with the evolution of human phenotypes (e.g., the
expanded neocortex, language production, and bipedal
gait) and diseases that occur mostly in humans (e.g., preeclampsia) [1]. Rapidly accumulating whole genome
sequence data from vertebrate species provide unprecedented opportunities for evolutionary analyses of protein
coding genes. A necessary step in such analyses is the construction of in-frame multiple sequence alignments.
Commonly used alignment tools such as CLUSTAL and TCOFFEE [2,3] do not retain reading frame information,
thus the achievement of in-frame alignments usually
requires manual curation, which is impractical at a
genome-wide scale. Moreover, genomic tools such as
threaded blockset aligners [4] derive the reading frame
from a single species and allow the others to have frameshifts, which can affect downstream calculations of DNA
substitution rates that are based on codon models. Therefore, none of these tools is wholly appropriate for phylogenetic analyses based on protein-coding models of
sequence evolution [5]. To infer non-synonymous and
synonymous substitutions for a large gene set, tools that
automate codon-preserved alignments are required.
To address these issues, we developed a tool to automate
gene alignments on a genome-wide scale with the reading-frame preserved for each set of putatively orthologous
coding sequences. The tool is called OCPAT (Online
Codon-Preserved Alignment Tool).

Implementation
The OCPAT pipeline is composed of 1) a user interface
[6], 2) a CGI program to handle queries, 3) a genomic
database to store sequences, and 4) the main program to
generate alignments. Output is stored on a server and
users are notified through email of URLs containing their
results.
The current version of OCPAT aligns genes from Homo
sapiens (human) [7], Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) [8],
Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaque) [9], Mus musculus
(mouse) [10], Rattus norvegicus (rat) [11], Oryctolagus
cuniculus (rabbit), Canis familiaris (dog) [12], Bos taurus
(cow), Dasypus novemcinctus (armadillo), Loxodonta africana (elephant), Echinops telfairi (tenrec), Monodelphis
domestica (opossum) [13], Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus), Gallus gallus (chicken) [14], and Xenopus tropicalis
(frog). mRNA and/or cDNA files are downloaded from
the RefSeq mRNA databases [15], the ENSEMBL cDNA
databases [16], and the NR (Non-redundant) mRNAs
[17]. mRNA/cDNA sequences are then sorted by species
and formatted and indexed using the "formatdb" program
[18]. The GenBank formatted human mRNA and protein

http://www.scfbm.org/content/2/1/5

sequences are downloaded from RefSeq as well [19]. For
the analysis described, data were updated on November 2,
2006.
The procedure for obtaining and aligning sequences is
executed using multiple available tools linked to one
another through perl modules and scripts [see additional
file 1]. OCPAT implements the following steps (Fig. 1):
1. Submission: Submits a list of human RefSeq IDs (e.g.,
NM_002425, NM_181814) in single-column format.
Users can choose which (or all) of 14 additional taxa will
be included in alignments.
2. Ortholog extraction: Retrieves mRNAs or CDs from the
other species by BLAST [20] search of respective cDNA or
mRNA databases using the human CDs as the query. In
the case of multiple sequences from one organism showing high similarity to the human CDs (i.e. less than 5%
difference between paralogs in the nonhuman organism),
the annotations (e.g. gene symbol) of those genes are used
to choose the putative ortholog. OCPAT defines putative
orthologs solely by sequence similarity. OCPAT also
measures sequence concordance, which is a measure of
the relative proportions of subject to query alignment
length. Sequence concordance is calculated where Concordance = 2 * matched sequence length/(query sequence
length + aligned subject sequence length). Aligned
sequences shorter than half the length of the queried
human sequence are eliminated from further consideration.
3. Error correction: Pre-aligns sequences using CLUSTALW [3]. Searches these alignments for possible places
where only one or two sequences has a frame shift introduced by nucleotide insertions or deletions while all the
other sequences are perfectly aligned to each other. Indels
causing gaps in these multiple sequence alignments are
filled with "N"s so the subsequent translation does not
cause frame shifting.
4. Determination of reading frame: Obtains a human
peptide for the queried RefSeq directly from the
human.rna.gbff file. Translates putative orthologous gene
sequences into peptides and determines the reading frame
of each gene by aligning the translated sequence to the
human peptide using the bl2seq program [21]. An "X" is
used for amino acids derived from codons containing
ambiguous nucleotides. Each sequence is then trimmed
so codons correctly begin with the first nucleotide position. Peptides for the orthologous gene sequences are
aligned using the CLUSTALW program [3]. Aligned peptides are then "translated" back to their corresponding
cDNA sequences by sequence mapping in which the
"reverse translation" is directed by correlated CDS and

Figure 1
Workflow of OCPAT
Workflow of OCPAT. The pipeline implements the steps as shown in the figure. The human RefSeq mRNA serves as the initial query by default. Putative orthologs are defined by sequence similarity and gene symbol. Frameshift causing substitutions
are masked, and OCPAT does not distinguish true frameshifts from sequencing errors. Unlike other alignment tools, a RefSeq
golden peptide sequence record guides OCPAT alignments rather than the predicted amino acid sequence derived from the
mRNA record.

peptide positions (e.g., the Nth amino acid in the peptide
maps back to the 3N-2, 3N-1, 3N nucleotides in the CDS),
thus avoiding the problem of codon degeneracy. This
translation, alignment and "reverse translation" procedure generates alignments that preserve the codon reading
frames.

5. Core alignment: Evaluates the cDNA alignment for the
core alignment region, in which the suboptimal alignments at the beginning and end of genes (often due to
poor predictions or sequence errors) are removed. A sliding window of three consecutive amino acids, beginning
from the 5' end, is moved across the multiple sequence

alignment. The "identical count" is determined by calculating the number of identical amino acids at each position in a three-amino-acid window. For a multiple
sequence alignment of N sequences, the maximum "identical count" per window is 3N. When the "identical count"
reaches 2.2N, the first amino acid in the sliding window is
marked as the start point of the core alignment. This represents slightly over 70% identity in the alignments. The
same sliding window strategy trims the 3' end of the core
alignment. Large, single species insertions are also
removed from the core alignments. The remaining "core
alignments" always begin with the first nucleotide within
a codon and end at the third nucleotide within a codon
6. Output: Produces NEXUS-, PHYLIP-, and CLUSTALformatted files, which can be utilized by a variety of phylogenetic programs including PAUP*, MacClade, PAML,
and Mr.Bayes [5,22-24]. Additional output files include
standard error files and a summary file (ocpat.align.sum).

Results
Using OCPAT we generated 20,658 multiple sequence
alignments derived from human mRNA RefSeq IDs.
Among these alignments 10,258 included 10 or more species. The pairwise numbers of alignable putative orthologous sequences is shown in Table 1, and a recent version
of alignment files for putative orthologous sequences are
available at [25]. All putative orthologs are considered
provisional, and certainly there are some non-orthologous sequences included in individual gene alignments
due to genome assembly errors, lineage specific gene
duplications, and ascertainment errors. As expected, we
obtained a greater number of putative human orthologs
from species more closely related to human (e.g., chimpanzee, macaque) than from more distantly related species (e.g., chicken, frog). We also found that mammal
species whose genomes were sequenced at 2-fold coverage
had fewer recovered orthologs than did mammals with

higher quality sequences. Despite these limitations, there
are 1,698 human RefSeqs for which we were able to
obtain putative orthologs from all taxa queried (N = 13;
the platypus Genebuild was not available as of Nov. 2,
2006). Phylogenetic analyses have been conducted on
these genes using parsimony, distance, likelihood, and
Bayesian methods [26].
To explore the biological significance of the genes found
in all species we conducted a functional annotation clustering analysis using the default settings of the DAVID
package [27]. The results of this analysis indicated a statistically significant over-representation of genes that encode
proteins found in multi-subunit complexes (n = 263 RefSeqs; p = 5.0E-39). Other overrepresented annotations in
functional clusters include one comprised of ribosomal
proteins and one containing proteins in the histone core.
We consider the genes with putative orthologs for all species to be a good indicator of conservation (i.e., more
identifiable orthologs indicates more functional constraint on the protein). Taken together, these results suggest that protein-protein interactions in multi-subunit
complexes are under considerable evolutionary constraint. Therefore, mutations in these proteins are possibly
more likely to be harmful when they occur.

Discussion
In silico gene prediction algorithms often fail at the 5' and
3' ends of a gene. Consequently, the 5'end and the 3'end
of the predicted ORFs are error prone. This can lead to
low-quality alignments in the 5' ends and the 3' ends of a
given gene. OCPAT trims the low-quality alignment
regions at the ends. The remaining high-quality core
alignments in the middle of the gene may be less "noisy"
than whole alignments. We also found that many of the
genes predicted for opossum, chicken, and frog have large
insertions when compared to genes from placental mammals. Therefore, if only one species has a big insertion

while all the others do not, OCPAT removes the insertion.
This treatment is most effective when there are other
sequences that partially overlap the insertion. By removing these large insertions, the smaller overlapping regions
are not "lost" as alignment gaps in subsequent phylogenetic analyses. If, after the initial run, the user finds the
inclusion of one species disrupts the alignment due to factors such as poor gene prediction and short length, the
user can re-run OCPAT for that gene and eliminate any
disrupting sequences.

Conclusion
In summary, we provide a simple tool for aligning genes
with the protein coding frames preserved. Alignments are
formatted so they can be applied to evolutionary analyses
using appropriate software. The tool is effective for creating alignments on a genome-wide scale. Future versions of
OCPAT will use the genome sequences of additional species.
