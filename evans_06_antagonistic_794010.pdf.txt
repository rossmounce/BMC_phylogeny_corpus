Abstract
Background: Honey bees, Apis mellifera, face many parasites and pathogens and consequently rely
on a diverse set of individual and group-level defenses to prevent disease. One route by which
honey bees and other insects might combat disease is through the shielding effects of their
microbial symbionts. Bees carry a diverse assemblage of bacteria, very few of which appear to be
pathogenic. Here we explore the inhibitory effects of these resident bacteria against the primary
bacterial pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae.
Results: Here we isolate, culture, and describe by 16S rRNA and protein-coding gene sequences
61 bacterial isolates from honey bee larvae, reflecting a total of 43 distinct bacterial taxa. We
culture these bacteria alongside the primary larval pathogen of honey bees, Paenibacillus larvae, and
show that many of these isolates severely inhibit the growth of this pathogen. Accordingly,
symbiotic bacteria including those described here are plausible natural antagonists toward this
widespread pathogen.
Conclusion: The results suggest a tradeoff in social insect colonies between the maintenance of
potentially beneficial bacterial symbionts and deterrence at the individual and colony level of
pathogenic species. They also provide a novel mechanism for recently described social components
behind disease resistance in insect colonies, and point toward a potential control strategy for an
important bee disease.

Background
Insects, like many eukaryotes, can be strongly affected by
the microbes they harbor. Bacterial associates of insects
are implicated in the degradation of plant materials and
other foods, regulation of pH, synthesis of vitamins and,
in relatively rare cases, induction of disease [1]. Insectbacteria associations range from facultative short-term
interactions to highly codependent symbioses [2]. Social
insects provide unique resources for microbial symbionts,
thanks to the high density of individuals within colonies,
sharing of food and other resources, and the coexistence

of colony members from multiple generations. Not surprisingly then, symbioses between social insect species
and microbial species are common and often highly coevolved. Many species of termites and ants, for example,
are obligately tied to specific microbes for their nutritional
needs [3-6].
Honey bees, Apis mellifera, support a diverse microbial
biome [7]. Recent surveys from adult bees indicate the
presence of dozens of bacterial taxa, ranging from grampositive bacteria to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacPage 1 of 9

teria [7,8]. While a few of these bacterial species are clearly
pathogenic, most have never been associated with honey
bee disease and their impacts on each other and their
honey bee hosts are unknown.
Now is an ideal time to explore the diversity of insect
endosymbiotic bacteria. First, an immense library of
sequence data for 16S rRNA loci and other robust markers
allows the precise identification of many associated species, even those that resist cultivation [9]. Over 200,000
bacterial entries exist currently for 16S rRNA, and 16S
sequences can place most surveyed bacterial taxa securely
into genera, if not species. Additionally, genomic studies
of diverse bacterial species allow new insights into the
mechanisms of maintenance and growth for these
microbes as well as their potential impacts on the health
of their insect hosts [10-12]. Finally, recent communitylevel surveys of bacterial diversity across different arthropods [13-18] allow a comparative approach toward
understanding roles played by bacteria during different
host life stages, and in different organs of the body.
Recently, we described four honey bee bacterial symbionts with clear bacteriostatic effects against the most virulent and widespread honey bee pathogen, the grampositive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae larvae [19]. Here,
we present a more complete survey of bacterial species isolated from honey bee larvae: the life stage at which they
are most susceptible to invasion by pathogenic bacteria.
We used 16S universal bacterial primers to identify bacteria and in vitro inhibition assays to quantify the abilities of
each of these isolates to inhibit P. l. larvae. We present
wide-ranging taxa capable of inhibiting this pathogen and
show considerable variation within and across colonies in
the distribution of inhibitory taxa. The results have general implications for the expression of bacterial virulence
in insects and for the maintenance of both beneficial and
disease-associated bacteria in social insects. They also
point to new avenues for the prophylactic or therapeutic
treatment of honey bee diseases.

reflected a broad range of haplotypes with matches to
members on each extreme of the cereus group (Fig. 3).
Outside of the cereus group, the remaining Bacillus spp.
matched B. fusiformis, B. flexus, B. mycoides, and B. niabensis (Table 1). Three additional Bacillus isolates showed
<97% sequences similarity to deposited sequences in
GenBank and as such were not reliably assignable to species. However two of those three isolates fell in a clade
with B. fusiformis and the last isolate extended off the B.
cereus clade (Fig 2). 10 isolates were indistinguishable
from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Table 1). Although all
three isolates of Acinetobacter fell into one clade in the 16S
tree, BLASTN only matched one of the three isolates to a
species while the remaining were matched solely to a
genus. Seven isolates were placed into the genus Brevibacillus, with close matches to Br. formosus (n = 4), Br. centrosporus (n = 1), and Br. brevis (n = 1). The final Brevibacillus
isolate did not match particularly closely to a taxon in the
16S database. None of the genera represented in this survey matched genera found in a previous 16S survey of bacteria from adult honey bees [8], suggesting that bacterial
sequencing in bees will continue to identify novel taxa.

Results and discussion

Diversity of inhibitory species
Inhibition zones, when present, ranged from a <10 mM
radius around the isolated bacteria to complete inhibition
of P. larvae across the dish. A total of 23 bacterial isolates
consistently inhibited P. larvae. Isolates that inhibited P.
larvae were evenly distributed across the sampled taxa
(Fig. 2). Out of 43 Bacillus sp. isolates, ten showed consistent inhibition while seven additional isolates showed
conditional inhibition. These seven all fell into the Bacillus cereus group. Of the ten Bacillus isolates with consistent
inhibition, 8 were B. cereus and two were B. fusiformis.
Thus, by the current in vitro assay, B. niabensis, B. circulans,
B. flexus, and B. mycoides isolates were not inhibitory of P.
larvae. All isolates that were matches with Brevibacillus formosus consistently inhibited the pathogen, while a single
isolate placed with B. centrosporus did not inhibit. All isolates tied to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia consistently
inhibited P. larvae, while two of three Acinetobacter isolates
showed inhibition.

Species distribution
Sequenced isolates (n = 61) were placed by 16S rRNA
sequence similarity into four bacterial genera: Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, and Stenotrophomonas. A total
of 43 16S haplotypes representing a minimum of 15 bacterial taxa were identified from the survey (Table 1, Fig. 2).
Most isolates fell within the genus Bacillus (n = 41). Of
these, 29 belonged to the B. cereus group and differed only
slightly at 16S. While 16S rRNA fails to confidently resolve
this species group, 26 showed best matches to B. cereus s.s.
isolates, while three were closest to B. thuringiensis. Additional resolution of this group was provided by GLyP and
PyC sequencing for a subset of isolates. These sequences

Distribution across individual bees and colonies
More bacteria and bacterial species were isolated, per individual, from 7-day-old larvae than from one-day larvae
(28 of 55 larvae at 7 days, 28 of 306 larvae at 24 hr, G test,
p < 0.0001; Table 2). Since larvae for both incubation
lengths were collected at the same time from the colony,
this difference does not reflect a greater chance for larvae
to be inoculated in the nest as they age. Instead, the differences presumably reflect quantitatively higher bacterial
loads in older individuals, such that these bacteria were
more readily cultured. There was no apparent difference
in species type or overall diversity between young and

older larvae, nor was there a significant difference in the
likelihood that a collected bacterial species was inhibitory
toward P. larvae (likelihood ratio, p = 0.2).
There was a significant difference across sites in the frequency of resident, cultivable, bacterial species. Two sites
had very low bacterial levels. One of these sites had been
established shortly before collections took place. In this
site (LID), only 4 out of 136 larvae (from 4 out of 34 colonies) showed bacterial growth. A second site, (Poultry)
showed similarly low rates of cultivable bacteria (2.2%, n
= 45 larvae). By contrast, measurable bacterial loads were
present in 13% (n = 63) and 24% (n = 46) of larvae from
the Parasitology and Meadow sites, respectively. Within
sites, there was significant variation across colonies in the
tendency of their larvae to harbor bacteria (nested
ANOVA, p < 0.001), and in the specific bacteria found in
certain colonies. More widespread surveys will be useful
for defining colony-level bacterial 'signatures', an important step in determining the impacts of symbiotic bacteria
on colony health.

Conclusion
We describe wide-ranging endogenous bacterial taxa that
are capable of inhibiting an important honey bee pathogen and show considerable variation within and across
colonies in the distribution of these taxa. The results have
general implications for the expression of bacterial virulence in insects and for the maintenance of both beneficial and disease-associated bacteria in social insects. They
also point to new avenues for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of honey bee diseases. None of the genera represented in this survey matched genera found in a
previous 16S survey of bacteria from adult honey bees [8],
although they do mimic, broadly, the microbial biome
measured in bee colonies to date (as reviewed by Gilliam,
[7]).
Most of the bacteria cultivated in this study belonged to
the genus Bacillus, a result that is consistent with the high
frequency of isolates placed in this genus by Gilliam and
colleagues [7]. Among the Bacillus species, the majority
fell into the Bacillus cereus group. Both 16S rRNA sequenc-

ing and multi-locus sequencing (GlyP, PyC) indicate that
these isolates represent several distinct taxa from this
group, although interference with P. larvae did not fall out
with species identification. The high frequency of bees
harboring bacteria from the B. cereus group suggests a stable symbiosis between bees and this taxon, perhaps helping to explain the fact that bees are more tolerant than
many other insects toward B. thuringiensis [20]. Curiously,
isolates from this group which shared both 16S haplotypes and sequence identity at the two protein-coding
genes differ substantially in their ability to inhibit P. larvae. This variation could result from undetected genetic
variation within subspecies, conditional activation of
inhibitory substances, or a role for plasmids or other
mobile elements in inhibition. Future experiments will
help resolve the causes of conditional inhibition by Bacillus cereus subspecies.
There is a growing appreciation for the potentially beneficial roles of bacteria in honey bee colonies. Evans and
Lopez [21] recently showed that non-pathogenic bacteria
can stimulate the innate immune response of honey bee
larvae, perhaps helping bees survive exposure to pathogens. Further, Reynaldi et al. [22] recently showed that
bacteria isolated from bees in Argentina are inhibitory of
the important bee fungal pathogen, Ascosphaera apis. It
will be interesting to determine whether these species, in
addition, are also inhibitory toward P. larvae, and to contrast the microbes associated with bees across different
continents.
Bacterial symbionts likely play roles in individual and colony fitness across the social insects. Sharing of symbiotic
bacteria is notoriously important for termite nutrition,
and it is increasingly clear that both obligate and facultative symbioses are widespread in social insects. Recent evidence for a socially communicable defense against
pathogens in termites [23] might indeed reflect sharing of
bacteria among termite colony members, rather than the
proposed induction of host-specific physiological
changes.
Perhaps, as is apparent in the termites and ants [24,25],
honey bees have evolved behavioral or physiological
mechanisms to enhance the transmission of beneficial
microbes, while battling those species which are pathogenic. This would indicate a delicate balancing act for bees
and other social insects, allowing for the encouragement
of beneficial species while maintaining barriers against
exploitation by pathogens. If so, discrimination at the levels of behavior and individual immune responses might
be used to bias the microbial biome within insect colonies
toward mutualists and against parasites and pathogens.
Beneficial symbionts can potentially be fed to developing
bees as a prophylactic against disease [21], and can regard-

less be used to better understand the complexity of interactions between the microbial biota of bees. It will, in this
vein, also be important to look more closely at transmission mechanisms of microbes within and between bee
colonies.

Methods
Organisms
Bacteria were cultivated from a total of 341 honey bee larvae collected from four apiaries near the USDA-ARS Bee
Research Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, USA from JuneAugust, 2003 (Fig. 1). These larvae were collected from
both mature honey bee colonies (n = 217 larvae in 51 colonies established at least one year prior to collection) and
from colonies that had been newly established (134 larvae from 34 colonies). First-instar larvae were collected
and reared for 24 h or 7d using an aseptic artificial diet,
controlled temperature (34°C) and high humidity as
described [19]. Larvae were frozen at -80°C prior to the
cultivation and isolation of bacteria.
Inhibition assays
Individual larval bees were ground in 40 ul sterile H2O at
room temperature, using a disposable pestle. A filterpaper disk was impregnated with 20 ul from the resulting
suspension. Each disk was centered on a standard Petri
plate (100 × 15 mm) consisting of Brain-Heart Infusion
(Difco) agar media containing 0.1 mg/ml thiamine
hydrochloride as described [26]. Prior to placement of
these disks, plates had been inoculated with a lawn of
approximately 1 × 108 viable spores of P. larvae. These
spores were isolated from diseased honey bee larvae collected in 2002 from a single bee colony in Berkeley, CA,
U.S.A (BRL sample 230010; [25]). After 24 h incubation
at 34°C, plates were scored for both bacterial growth and
inhibition toward P. larvae. Bacterial growth was
described as any bacteria on or contiguous to the paper
disks that was atypical for P. larvae. Inhibition was defined
as the radial distance between these paper disks and the
first line of P. larvae growth. P. larvae inhibition was only
observed in conjunction with growth of larval-derived
bacteria (e.g., there were no signs of inhibition resulting
from the larvae themselves by this assay). Inhibition was
confirmed in all cases by replating collected bacterial cultures against a fresh lawn of P. larvae.
DNA extraction and sequencing
All bacterial colonies on or alongside paper disks were collected with a sterile wand. Approximately 10 mg vegetative cells of each sample was suspended in 300 ul of 30%
glycerol solution then kept at -20°C. To isolate DNA, 50
ul from this suspension was mixed with 50 ul 10%
Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), then incubated at
72°C for 10–20 minutes before being placed on ice.

16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR using universal
eubacterial primers eu27.F and eu1495.R [27]; sequences
5'- gagagtttgatcctggctcag-3' and 5'- ctacggctaccttgttacga-3',
respectively). Reaction mixes included 2 ul bacterial
extract, 2 U Taq DNA polymerase with recommended
buffer (Boehringer, Indianapolis, IN), 1 mM DNTP mix, 2
mM MgCl2, and 0.2 µM of each primer. PCR was carried
out on an MJ-Research PTC-100 thermal cycler using 30
cycles of 93°C 1 min, 54°C 1 min, 72°C 1 min. Bands of
an appropriate size were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, then PCR products were purified directly (Gene
Pure). Products were sequenced using Big Dye 2.0
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) end-terminal cycle
sequencing, followed by separation and analysis on an
Applied Biosystems 3130 DNA Analysis machine.
Sequencing was carried out in one direction from the 5'
(eu27.F) end.
Sequence analyses
Sequences were checked and trimmed using the software
program Sequencher (Gene Codes), then were aligned
using the CLUSTALW algorithm, invoked by Omiga 2.0
(Oxford Molecular). Alignments also included a diverse
array of bacterial species, including all of those previously
identified from bees and representative members of the
major bacterial clades. Alignments were exported to PAUP
4.0b10 (Sinauer) to generate phylogenetic hypotheses
using a heuristic maximum-parsimony algorithm. Trees
were generated for the entire data set, and for a data set
limited to species found in the genus Bacillus. Sequences
were also compared directly to all 16S rRNA sequences
deposited in GenBank [28] using BLASTN, in August,
2005.
Multilocus sequences for Bacillus isolates
A large fraction of sequenced isolates were placed into the
Bacillus cereus group by 16S rRNA similarity. To better
resolve members of this group, isolates were sequenced at
two protein-coding loci that offer informative sequence
variation within this group [29]. Glycerol uptake factor
protein (PCR and sequencing primers Glyp.F GCG TTT
GTG CTG GTG TAA GT and GlyP.R CTG CAA TCG GAA
GGA AGA AG) and Pyruvate carboxylase (primers PyC.F
GCG TTA GGT GGA AAC GAA AG and PyC.R CGC GTC
CAA GTT TAT GGA AT) genes were amplified by a threestep PCR regime of (94 30 s, 58 30 s, 72 1 m) × 30 and
sequenced via Big-Dye N terminal sequencing as
described above. Sequences were aligned with each other
and voucher sequences from the Multilocus sequencing
database http://pubmlst.org/bcereus/ using CLUSTAL,
then were analysed by maximum parsimony using PAUP
4.0b.
