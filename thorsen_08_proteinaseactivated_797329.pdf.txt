Abstract
Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), activated by trypsin and other serine proteinases, is a key
initiator of inflammatory responses in the intestine of mammals. Atlantic salmon fed diets with
standard qualities of soybean meal (SBM) show enteritis of the distal intestine as well as increased
activity of trypsin in both luminal contents and wall tissue. Luminal trypsin activity may possibly be
involved in immune related disorders of the intestine also in Atlantic salmon via activation of PAR
2. In the present study our aim was to investigate if PAR-2 play a role in SBM induced enteritis. We
performed multiple alignments based on nucleic acid sequences of PAR-2 from various animals
available from public databases, and designed primers for use in cloning of the Atlantic salmon PAR2 transcript. We further cloned and characterized the full length sequence of Atlantic salmon PAR2 and investigated the expression in both early and chronic stages of SBM induced enteropathy.
Two full length versions of PAR-2 cDNA were identified and termed PAR-2a and PAR-2b.
Expression of the two PAR-2 transcripts was detected in all 18 tissues examined, but most
extensively in the intestine and gills. A significant up-regulation in the distal intestine was observed
for the PAR-2a transcript after 1 day feeding diets containing SBM. After 3 weeks of feeding, PAR2a was down-regulated compared to the fish fed control diets. These findings may indicate that
PAR-2a participates in inflammatory responses in both the early and later stages of the SBM
enteropathy. In the chronic stages of the enteropathy, down-regulation of PAR-2a may indicate a
possible desensitization of the PAR-2a receptor. Expression of PAR-2b was not altered in the first
7 days of SBM feeding, but a significant up regulation was observed after 3 weeks, suggesting a
putative role in chronic stages of SBM induced enteritis. The expression differences of the two
PAR-2 transcripts in the feed trials may indicate that they have different roles in the SBM induced
enteritis.

Introduction
By ingesting feed, the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) is
presented to food components and microorganisms carried with the feed exposing the organism to allergens and
pathogens that can cause disease and hence affect animal
welfare. The GI tract is one of a few major entry points for

microorganisms and pathogens, and hence, animals have
well developed physical and chemical barriers in combination with an effective mucosal immune system [1]. The
mucosal and chemical barriers can be breached by microorganisms and pathogens, and once breached, circulating
innate immune cells will form a second important basis

for defence. The gut immune apparatus represents therefore a major element in the defence of an animal, and is
considered the largest immunological organ in man [2]. A
well functioning immune apparatus in the gastrointestinal tract is therefore of utmost importance for the function and wellbeing of all animals.
SBM induced enteritis
Standard qualities of soybean meal (SBM), the most
important and cheapest protein rich feedstuff on the
world market, can only be used at limited levels in salmonid diets because it challenges the gut immune systems
and fish health. Salmon, when fed diets with standard
qualities of SBM develop an inflammation like condition
(enteritis) in the distal intestine characterized by inflammatory infiltrate in the intestinal mucosa, atrophy of primary and secondary mucosal folds and decrease of
epithelial vacuolization [3-5]. A previous study investigating the development of the enteritis using a 33% SBM feed
showed minor changes in intestinal histology in some of
the samples after two days of feeding [3]. After 7 days of
feeding SBM the fish displayed all the signs present in the
fully developed condition including increased width and
marked reduction in height of simple mucosal folds as
well as increased cell infiltration of the lamina propria [3].
Further, upon feeding SBM for 14–21 days the enteritis
was fully developed in all the fish examined [3]. The SBM
induced enteritis may also be a key factor in the decrease
in growth as well as nutrient digestibility and absorption
observed at higher inclusion levels [6-9] and has been suggested to have a negative effect on disease resistance [10].
Salmonids fed diets with standard qualities of SBM show
elevated activity of trypsin-like enzymes [11,12] suggesting that trypsin might be involved in the development of
SBM induced enteritis. Further, studies with partly fractionated soybean extracts have shown that the feed substances participating in the enteropathy in salmon are
soluble in alcohol [13,14]. Later studies has suggested that
saponins, present in the soy alcohol extract, is a compound that may cause some, but not all, of the intestinal
alterations seen in Atlantic salmon fed soybean meal [15].
Saponins are known to increase permeability of intestinal
tissue and thereby increase exposure to immune stimulants [16]. But still, more than 18 years after the SBM
induced enteritis was reported, the causative molecular
agents present in SBM responsible for the pathogenesis
have not been identified.
PAR-2 receptors and inflammation
Several studies in mammalian species have shown that
activation of cell surface receptors termed proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) are key activators of inflammatory
responses in a wide range of tissues including the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and airways [17-23]. These cell surface
receptors are G-protein coupled and belongs to a family of

http://www.journal-inflammation.com/content/5/1/18

seven transmembrane receptors that can be activated by
serine proteinases, such as trypsin. So far, four proteinaseactivated receptors have been cloned and studied in man
[24-27], but to our knowledge no proteinase-activated
receptors have been studied in teleost fish. Activation of
PAR-2 (proteinase-activated receptor 2) in mammals is
achieved by proteolytic cleavage of an extracellular peptide sequence hereby exposing an N-terminal tethered ligand domain that binds to and activates the receptor
[28,29]. Upon activation of the PAR-2 receptor in mammals, the receptor is internalized and targeted to lysosomes for degradation [30,31]. To resensitize the cells
from the irreversible receptor cleavage new receptors are
mobilized by large Golgi stores as well as synthesis of new
receptors [30]. The PAR-2 receptor has been detected in
various diverse tissues such as brain, eye, airway, heart, GI
tract, pancreas, kidney, liver, prostate, skin and in cells
such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, as well as in
immune cells such as T-cells, neutrophils, mast cells and
eosinophils [32,33]. Some of the PAR-2 mediated effects
on leukocytes involve leukocyte rolling and adhesion [34]
as well as leukocyte migration in vivo [35]. Activation of
PAR-2 by serine proteinases have been shown, in vitro, to
stimulate bone marrow progenitor cells to develop into
dendritic cells [36]. Hence, serine proteinases might participate in adaptive immune responses in vivo. Activation
of PAR-2 by trypsin in luminal colonocytes in mice affect
the permeability and hence could play an important role
in pathogenesis of different mammalian gastrointestinal
disorders [22]. In humans, elevated colonic luminal serine proteinase activity of irritable bowels syndrome (IBS)
patients has been suggested to involve PAR-2 activation
and mediate epithelial barrier dysfunction and pathogenesis of IBS [37].
Mechanisms of immune responses in fish, whether stimulated by dietary components or pathogens are not well
described. A better understanding of these responses is
expected to lead the way to develop healthier and more
productive diets and found the basis for improvements in
disease prevention and treatments.
The reported importance of PAR-2 activation in mammalian inflammatory diseases motivated the cloning,
sequencing and expression analysis of the PAR-2 transcript in Atlantic salmon fed SBM diets. The data presented indicates a possible role of PAR-2 as a mediator of
inflammatory responses in the distal intestine of Atlantic
salmon.

short term trial (1–7 days) and a long term trial (21 days)
were collected.
Short term trial
Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmobreed strain), weighing
214 g (average) on the termination of the experiment,
were kept in fibreglass tanks (1 × 1 × 0.6 m, water depth
40–50 cm) containing running seawater (salinity 32–34 g
L-1) under 24 h light conditions. The water temperature
was between 8–10°C during the experimental period.
During the experiment the fish were fed either a fishmeal
(FM) diet or a diet containing 46% SBM (Table 1) for 1, 3
or 7 days. Prior to the feeding trial the fish were allocated
in the fibreglass tanks and fed the fish meal diet for 27
days. Further details on formulation, chemical composition and production of the diets are given in [38]. The
experiment was done at AKVAFORSK, The Institute of
Aquaculture Research in Sunndalsøra (Norway).
Long term trial
Farmed Atlantic salmon with an initial weight of approximately 176 g were distributed into fibreglass tanks (1 × 1
× 0.6 m, water depth 40–50 cm) containing running sea
water (5.6°C). The fish were fed either a FM diet or a diet
containing 30% SBM for 3 weeks (Table 1). Before the
start of the trial the salmon were fed a commercial diet
(Skretting AS, Stavanger, Norway). Further details on formulation and chemical composition of the diets as well as
fish and rearing conditions are given in [12]. The experiment was done at AKVAFORSK, The Institute of Aquaculture Research in Sunndalsøra (Norway).

Collection of tissue samples
Fish were randomly selected, anesthetized in tricaine
methansulphate (MS222), weighed, measured and killed
with a sharp blow to the head followed by abdominal
evisceration. The intestines were cleaned of all fatty tissue
and intestinal content prior to collection of samples. The
intestinal regions were defined as follows: the pyloric
intestine (PI) included the intestine with the caeca; the
mid intestine (MI) included the intestine between the
most distal pyloric caecum and the appearance of transverse folds of the luminal surface and the increase in intestinal diameter; the distal intestine (DI) included the
intestine between the distal end of the MI and anus.

For characterization of PAR-2a and PAR-2b mRNA expression in various tissues 300 mg of the following tissues
were sampled from one fish fed a FM based diet: oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, PI, MI, DI, liver, head kidney, kidney, heart, spleen, thymus, brain, eye, gill, gonads, muscle
and skin. All samples except for pancreas were stored in
RNAlater® (Ambion Inc.) at -20°C until RNA isolation.
Pancreas was collected as follows: approximately 300 mg
of pancreatic tissue, i.e. diffuse pancreas embedded in the
fatty tissue surrounding the pyloric caeca, was gently
scraped off with a spatula and immediately snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen then transferred to ten times the volume
of RNAlater®-ICE (Ambion, Inc.) and stored at -80°C until
RNA isolation.
For quantification of PAR-2 mRNA expression approximately 300 mg of the DI from the short-term and the
long-term trial was collected and stored on RNAlater®
(Ambion Inc.) at -20°C until RNA isolation. The following diets and points of time were collected from the shortterm trial: from the FM group (control fish) 2 fish were
collected on day 1, 3 and 7 respectively (6 in total); from
the SBM group 6 fish were collected at day 1, 3 and 7
respectively (6 fish per day). Nine DI samples were collected from the FM and SBM group respectively in the
long-term trial.
Total RNA extraction
Total RNA was isolated from oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, PI, MI, DI, liver, head kidney, kidney, heart, spleen,
thymus, brain, eye, gill, gonads, and muscle using Trizol
(Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A modified protocol was used for pancreas with three times the volume of reagents.
First strand cDNA synthesis
cDNA was generated from five microgram of total RNA
using PowerScript™ Reverse Transcriptase (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, primed with a mixture of oligo dT (25
ng/μl) and random hexamer primers (2.5 ng/μl).

Cloning and sequencing of PAR-2 mRNA sequences
Multiple DNA sequence alignments was performed from
Homo sapiens [GenBank:NM_005242], Danio rerio [GenBank:XM_678622], Hippoglossus hippoglossus [GenOncorhynchus
mykiss
Bank:EB034068],
[GenBank:BX861951] and Xenopus laevis [GenBank:BX850546] PAR-2 sequences using the publicly
available web browser based bl2seq (Blast 2 Sequences,
[39]). From these alignments we manually designed one
degenerated (PAR-2R_Deg) and one regular PCR primer
(PAR-2F) based on the identification of potential nucleic
acid conservation of PAR-2 sequences. All PCR products
amplified with Advantage 2 PCR enzyme mix (Clontech,
Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan) were used in a post-amplification procedure with addition of 2 U of Taq polymerase
(Biotools, B&M Labs, Madrid, Spain) in 1× PCR buffer
(Biotools) for 15 min at 72°C before use in TOPO TA
cloning (TOPO TA Cloning® Kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). The PAR-2 primers and cDNA generated from the
distal intestine were used in PCR amplification using
Advantage 2 PCR enzyme mix (Clontech) in a total reaction volume of 25 μl with the following cycling parameters: 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 30 s. A positive PCR product of 149 bp was cloned
using TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturers' instructions. From the cloning, five clones
were selected and grown for 16 h at 37°C in Luria-Bertani
media containing 50 μg/ml ampicilin. Plasmid DNA was
isolated (E.Z.N.A plasmid miniprep kit I, OMEGA BioTek, Inc, GA, USA) and sent for sequencing (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany). From the PAR-2 sequence
obtained we manually designed specific PCR primers
unique for each PAR-2 versions for use in 5' and 3' RACE
(rapid amplification of cDNA ends). mRNA was isolated
from total RNA following the manufacturers instructions
(MicroPoly(A)Purist™ Kit, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and
approximately 1 μg of was used for reverse transcription
using SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification Kit (Clontech).
The PCR reactions were performed using the Advantage 2
PCR enzyme mix (Clontech) with the following touchdown PCR setup; 3 min at 94°C followed by: (30 s at
94°C, 3 min at 72°C) × five cycles, (30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
70°C, 3 min at 72°C) × five cycles, (30 s at 94°C, 30 s at
68°C, 3 min at 72°C) × 32 cycles. From each transformation, 8 clones were selected and grown for 16 h at 37°C in
Luria-Bertani media containing 50 μg/ml ampicilin, plasmids were isolated (E.Z.N.A plasmid miniprep Kit I) and
sequenced (GATC Biotech). The sequence chromatograms were imported to the free software ContigExpress
(Vector NTI Advance 10, Invitrogen), trimmed for vector
and RACE primer sequences and assembled into contigs.

were subjected to DNase treatment using a TURBO DNAfree™ kit (Ambion) in accordance with the manufacturer's
recommendations.
First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 0.8 μg
total RNA from each sample using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and Oligo(dT)20 primers (Invitrogen) in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions.
Real-time RT-PCR primers for the two PAR-2 transcripts
were designed based on the full-length sequence using the
free available software FastPCR [40]. Real-time RT-PCR
primers for the housekeeping genes were designed using
Primer3 software [41]. PCR reactions were performed in a
total volume of 10 μl using the LightCycler FastStart DNA
MasterPLUS SYBR GREEN I kit (Roche Diagnostics) using
4.5 μl PCR-grade water, 0.5 μl of each PCR primer (10
μM), 2.5 μl (6.25 ng) cDNA template and 2 μl master mix.
The following program was used: Denaturation (10 min
at 95°C), amplification and quantification program
repeated 40 times (10 sec. at 95°C, 15 sec. at the appropriate annealing temperature for the gene specific primers
(Table 2) and 10 sec. at 72°C with a single fluorescence
measurement), melting curve program (60°C to 99°C
with a heating rate of 0.1°C/sec.) and cooling program
down to 40°C.
For determination of the crossing point (CP) the "second
derivative maximum method" measuring maximum
increase rate of newly synthesized DNA per cycle was used
on the basis of the LightCycler software 4.0 (Roche Diagnostics). To confirm amplification specificity the PCR
products from each primer pair were subjected to melting
curve analysis and manual inspection of PCR products
after each run by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Relative quantification analyzes
The relative expression ratio of target mRNAs was calculated using the LightCycler software 4.0 (Roche Diagnostics) with calibrator-normalized relative quantification
and PCR efficiency correction based on a linear regression
fit. RNA from tissues of a fish from the FM group was used
as calibrator. Four reference genes; Elongation factor 1
alpha, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S
RNA and β-actin (Table 2) were analyzed for stability of
expression in the samples intended for relative quantification analyses using the geNorm software [42]. Relative
standard curves were generated on the basis of cDNA
pooled from 2 samples from each diet and sample time,
diluted in 5-fold or 10-fold dilution steps to cover the
expected detection range of the target and housekeeping
genes.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from DI as previously described.
Prior to reverse transcription, total RNA from all samples

Phylogenetic analyzes
To examine the evolutionary relationship of the cloned
Atlantic salmon sequences we aligned them with published PAR-2 sequences from a set of animal species using
MEGA 4 [43], and used Jalview [44] to visualize the
aligned sequences. The following sequences were used;
human [GenBank:NM_001992, GenBank:NM_005242,
GenBank:NM_004101, GenBank:NM_003950], dog
[GenBank:XM_546059, GenBank:XM_546057, GenBank:XM_844773, GenBank:XM_541962] mouse [GenGenBank:NM_007974,
Bank:NM_010169,
GenBank:NM_010170, GenBank:NM_007975], rat [GenGenBank:NM_053897,
GenBank:NM_012950,
Bank:NM_053313, GenBank:NM_053808], zebrafish
[GenBank:XM_694943], frog [GenBank:NM_001085783,
GenBank:NM_001086070]. In MEGA 4 we produced a
cladogram using Neighbor-joining with the following settings; bootstrap = 10000 seed = 38877, complete deletion
for gaps/missing data, Poisson correction for amino acid
substitution and uniform rates among sites.
Statistics
The Shapiro-Wilk W test was used to test conformity with
the normal distribution. Student's t test was used to compare the relative expression of the respective genes
between diets in the three week feed trial. To correct for
multi comparisons of means, analysis of variance was followed by Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)
test. All results are presented as mean values with bars representing SEM. All tests were carried out two-tailed, with a
significance level of 5%. The statistical analyses were per-

formed using JMP 5.0.1 software package (SAS Institute
Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

Results and discussion
Full-length cloning of PAR-2 transcripts
Using cloning and sequencing we identified two fulllength PAR-2 mRNA transcripts termed PAR-2a [GenBank:FJ184031] and PAR-2b [GenBank:FJ184032] respectively, with 78% nucleic acid identity to each other in the
deduced open reading frame (ORF). The large difference
between the two transcripts indicate that they are likely to
be derived from two genes, probably caused by divergence
of the duplicated genome of Atlantic salmon [45]. Several
expressed genes have previously been shown to be duplicated in Atlantic salmon [46-49], but little is known about
what fraction of the reported duplicated genes are functional. Deduced amino acid similarities of the two PAR-2
receptors were compared to other species by performed
multiple alignments with known PAR-2 sequences from
Homo sapiens and Danio rerio (Figure 1). To visualize the
phylogenetic sequence relations we produced a cladogram using Neighbour joining with BLOSUM62 matrix
(Figure 2). From the alignments and the cladogram, both
deduced Atlantic salmon PAR-2 sequences show similarity to other known PAR-2 sequences. However, the PAR2a sequence show more similarity to Danio rerio PAR-2
sequence than to the alternative Atlantic salmon PAR-2b
sequence, which may indicate PAR-2a as the putative
ancestral gene. We also observed considerable differences
in the first 1–45 and 200–229 aa (amino acids) of the two
deduced Atlantic salmon PAR-2 proteins. These regions of

the protein represent the putative N-terminal domain and
extra cellular loop 2 region, both being essential in the
activation of this receptor in mammals. Both deduced
Atlantic salmon PAR-2 protein sequences have a serine
proteinase cleavage site in the N-terminal part of the protein (Figure 1) in a comparable position of the serine proteinase site in the human PAR-2 protein.
Expression studies of PAR-2 transcripts
Thorough testing of the PCR primer pairs with diluted
plasmid templates for both PAR-2 genes in real-time RTPCR experiments showed high specificity for the two PAR2 transcripts (data not shown). Expression of both PAR-2
transcripts was seen in all the tissues examined, with
about 10–100 fold higher expression in gills, pyloric-,
mid-, and distal intestine (Figure 3). Our findings are similar to reports of high expression of PAR-2 in the colon
and small intestine of man [25,50]. In man, PAR-2 has
been demonstrated to mediate infiltration of leukocytes

http://www.journal-inflammation.com/content/5/1/18

as well as hyperreactivity in allergic inflammation of the
airway [23]. Hence, the high expression of the PAR-2
receptor transcripts observed in the gills of Atlantic
salmon could point to analogous functions in the respiratory organ of fishes.
Transcription level for PAR-2a showed a rapid and significant up-regulation at day 1 in fish fed diet with SBM
whereas no expression differences was seen at day 3 or 7
(Figure 4). For PAR-2b there was no significant expression
change during the first 7 days in fish fed diets containing
SBM (Figure 4). Histopathological changes in the distal
intestine of the fish fed the SBM diets showed similar features as previously described in another study [3]. No histopathological changes were observed after one day of
feeding SBM, and only minor changes in some fish were
seen at day three (results not shown). However, after 7
days most fish displayed the features of SBM induced
enteritis (results not shown). Most fish fed SBM diet for 21

investigations as been reported previously [12]. Interestingly, at three weeks feeding a diet containing SBM, a significant down-regulation was seen for PAR-2a, and a
significant up-regulation was detected for PAR-2b com-

pared to fish fed the control diet. Even though many
duplicated genes in Atlantic salmon might be classified as
pseudogenes, the observed response for the two PAR-2
genes may suggest involvement of both genes in the SBM
induced enteritis. Overexpression of PAR-2 has been

observed in biopsies from IBD (inflammatory bowels disease) patients and PAR-2 could play an important role in
the development of colonic inflammation in man [20]. A
pro-inflammatory role for PAR-2 was first shown in the
colon of mice where acute PAR-2 activation led to an
increase in epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation [17]. Patients with ulcerative colitis treated with a
tryptase inhibitor shown relieved symptoms or remission
of the disease [51], suggesting involvement of PAR-2 and
tryptase in the gastrointestinal disease in these patients.
Luminal proteinases has been demonstrated to regulate
colonic paracellular permeability in mice, and that bacterial flora influences the degranulation of mucosal mast
cells [22]. Further, it was suggested that the increased
expression of PAR-2 observed in colonocytes is influenced
by increased luminal proteinase activity rather than the
release of proteinases such as tryptase [22]. Increased
luminal trypsin-like activity in the distal intestine of
Atlantic salmon fed diets with SBM [11,12] may suggest a
similar mode of PAR-2 activation by serine proteases in
fish.
In mouse colon and small intestine a higher expression of
PAR-2 has been reported in the surface epithelial cells lining the upper two thirds of the villi compared to cells
located in the crypt region [50]. An increased proliferative
compartment length as well as lower mucosal fold height
have been reported in fish fed SBM feed for three weeks or
more [52]. As a consequence, the observed reduction of
PAR-2a expression after 3 weeks on a SBM diet may be
caused by a reduced number of proliferated cells expressing PAR-2 towards the tip of the villi compared to the control fish. If the two PAR-2 transcripts in Atlantic salmon
are not expressed equally in the same cell populations, the
increased expression of PAR-2b in fish fed SBM feed for 3
weeks might be caused by the number of proliferated cells
or the reported leukocyte infiltrate in fish fed diets containing SBM. The expression profile of the two transcripts
in different cell populations of the intestine needs to be
further investigated.
Recent studies have shown that inflammation of the gut
disrupts the normal microbiota and dramatically boost
colonization of pathogenic bacteria in man [53,54]. An
inflamed gut is therefore an open invitation to several species of pathogenic bacteria further promoting the inflammation and a factor in causing disease. The microbiota in
Atlantic salmon changes upon exposure to SBM and a
more diverse population of adherent bacteria has been
reported after 3 weeks feeding a diet containing SBM [52].
The change of PAR-2a expression detected after one day of
exposure to feed containing SBM suggest PAR-2 receptor
activation and could therefore be responsible for an initiation of inflammation. Such an inflammation in concert
with the new feed components could allow colonization

http://www.journal-inflammation.com/content/5/1/18

of new bacteria and ultimately changing the normal
microbiota. It is not known however if the microbiota of
Atlantic salmon fed feed containing SBM is altered as early
as one day after feeding, and a putative involvement of
bacteria in the early phases of the development of enteritis
merits further investigation.
The putative role PAR-2 seems to have in intestinal
inflammation in fishes makes it a potential important
marker for enteritis. Soybean meal appears as a promising
tool for studies of PAR-2, intestinal inflammation
responses as well as intestinal cell populations in Atlantic
salmon.

Conclusion
In our study we have demonstrated that Atlantic salmon
have putative duplicated gene versions of the PAR-2 receptor. Both transcripts are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and the gills. In Atlantic salmon fed inclusion
levels of SBM the expression of the two PAR-2 transcripts
is altered. We have shown that PAR-2a has a significant
change of expression after one day of feeding diets containing SBM, but that the expression is significantly
decreased in a three week feeding trial. The expression of
PAR-2b did not show altered expression in the first seven
days of feeding but a significant increase in expression is
observed after three weeks. The altered expression of the
two PAR-2 transcripts in the gut of fish fed diets containing SBM suggests that PAR-2 may have an important role
in inflammation in fishes and other lower vertebrates. The
identification of the PAR-2 genes in Atlantic salmon, a
known initiator of inflammation in the gut of mammals,
opens up for future studies to further shed light on molecular causes of the SBM induced enteritis observed in salmonids.
