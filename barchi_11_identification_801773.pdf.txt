Abstract
Background: The eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) genome is relatively unexplored, especially compared to those
of the other major Solanaceae crops tomato and potato. In particular, no SNP markers are publicly available; on the
other hand, over 1,000 SSR markers were developed and publicly available. We have combined the recently
developed Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) approach with Illumina DNA sequencing for rapid and mass
discovery of both SNP and SSR markers for eggplant.
Results: RAD tags were generated from the genomic DNA of a pair of eggplant mapping parents, and sequenced
to produce ~17.5 Mb of sequences arrangeable into ~78,000 contigs. The resulting non-redundant genomic
sequence dataset consisted of ~45,000 sequences, of which ~29% were putative coding sequences and ~70%
were in common between the mapping parents. The shared sequences allowed the discovery of ~10,000 SNPs
and nearly 1,000 indels, equivalent to a SNP frequency of 0.8 per Kb and an indel frequency of 0.07 per Kb. Over
2,000 of the SNPs are likely to be mappable via the Illumina GoldenGate assay. A subset of 384 SNPs was used to
successfully fingerprint a panel of eggplant germplasm, producing a set of informative diversity data. The RAD
sequences also included nearly 2,000 putative SSRs, and primer pairs were designed to amplify 1,155 loci.
Conclusion: The high throughput sequencing of the RAD tags allowed the discovery of a large number of DNA
markers, which will prove useful for extending our current knowledge of the genome organization of eggplant, for
assisting in marker-aided selection and for carrying out comparative genomic analyses within the Solanaceae
family.

Background
Eggplant (Solanum melongena L., 2n = 2x = 24) is a
species belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is
assumed to have been first domesticated in South and
East Asia [1], and brought to Europe by Arab traders
and immigrants around 600 CE [2]. In production
terms, eggplant is the third most important Solanaceae
crop species (after potato and tomato; http://faostat.fao.
org), and is cultivated all over the world, but most
intensively in China and India. About 2.4% of world
production in 2009 is sited in Europe, with Italy being
the single largest producer.
The estimated genome size of eggplant is 1.1 Gbp [3].
Knowledge of its genome organization is rather limited

compared to that of either tomato or potato (http://solgenomics.net/, http://www.potatogenome.net). Genetic
maps based on both inter-specific [4,5] and intra-specific [6-9] crosses have been developed. The most recent
inter-specific map [5] is constituted of 347 COS and
RFLP markers spanning 1,535 cM, while the most
recent intra-specific maps were constructed by Barchi et
al. [9] and Nunome et al. [8] and comprise 238 markers,
spanning 718.7, and 236 markers, spanning 951.4 cM,
respectively. Nevertheless the level of marker saturation
is still low in the context of both fine mapping and
genomic synteny. A small set of SSR markers was developed by Stagel et al. [10] from genic DNA sequence
lodged in public access databases, while Nunome et al.
[7] reported the identification of over 1,000 SSR markers
from a screen of enriched gDNA and cDNA libraries.
Many of these latter proved informative for intra-specific mapping and have been used to generate what is

currently the best available genetic linkage map. More
recently, Fukuoka et al. [11] have published a dataset
containing a large number (~16,000) of transcript
sequences, but these have yet to be mined for either
SSR or SNP markers.
The so-called “Restriction-site Associated DNA”
(RAD) method was proposed by Miller et al. [12] as
providing a reliable means for genome complexity
reduction. The concept is based on acquiring the
sequence adjacent to a set of particular restriction
enzyme recognition sites. The application of high
throughput sequencing technology has allowed significant progress in developing a RAD genotyping platform
[13]; specifically, large volumes of polymorphism data
can be now generated by applying massively parallel
sequencing and multiplexing with RAD tag libraries.
In this report we describe the generation of genomic
RAD tags from the two parents of an F 2 segregating
population used to generate an intra-specific eggplant
genetic map [9]; the RAD tags were sequenced using
the Illumina platform and then annotated/categorized.
These data allowed the discovery of a large number of
SNP, indel and SSR markers, and some of the SNPs
have been tested against a panel of eggplant accessions.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing and contig assembly

The sequencing procedure (Figure 1) generated 10.90
million reads for ‘305E40’ and 12.12 million for ‘67/3’,
parents of an F2 intra-specific mapping population (see
methods section), equivalent to ~13.3 Mb of sequence
for ‘305E40’ and 13.8 Mb for ‘67/3’. After editing/trimming, ~17.5 Mb high quality sequence was available.
Raw data have been made available through the

Page 2 of 9

Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repository at NCBI
(SRA035360.1). The reads were assembled into 77,876
contigs (38,935 from ‘305E40’, 38,941 from ‘67/3’); the
‘305E40’ assemblies were of mean length 351 bp (range:
218-585 bp; N50: 362 bp), and those from ‘67/3’ of
mean length 368 bp (range: 218-579 bp; N50: 382 bp).
The SM-I (Solanum melongena-Illumina) dataset finally
comprised 45,390 sequences, including 31,635 sequences
(12.5 Mbp) in common between the two mapping parents (Table 1), and formed the basis of the subsequent
annotation and functional categorization (Additional file
1). The SM-I dataset was also screened for the occurrence of repetitive elements. About 6.7% (1.1 Mbp) of
the sequence database showed some similarity with
known plant mobile elements and was thus filtered out
for SNP mining procedures.
Sequence annotation

In all, 6,411 sequences (14.1%) of the SM-I dataset
matched 4,761 entries in the Fukuoka 16 K eggplant
annotated unigene dataset (later referred as 16 K) [11].
A BlastN search of the SGN Cornell unigene database
(http://solgenomics.net/) produced significant hits from
9,476 (20.9%) of the SM-I sequences matching 8,244
SGN unigenes, of which ~47% originated from tomato,
~38% from potato, and ~11% from tobacco. Combining
the 16 K and SGN hits produced 12,315 unique
sequences; a total of 9,976 sequences were properly
annotated, of which 2,123 were annotated in both the
SGN and 16 K databases, 6,440 only in SGN, and 1,413
only in 16 K. Some 35,414 SM-I sequences were unrepresented in either of these two databases, and these
were used as a batch BlastX query against the TAIR9
Arabidopsis thaliana protein database to allow a putative assignment of function. In all, 2,798 sequences
(7.9%) produced a hit with an E value of < e -15 ,

corresponding to 1,853 A. thaliana genes. This rather
small number of hits presumably reflects sequence
divergence between eggplant and A. thaliana orthologs,
although it has been recognized that the BLAST algorithm can be rather inefficient in identifying homologous sequences when short reads are involved [14].
Globally, therefore, the SM-I dataset consists of some
12,774 annotated sequences which match 7,191 A. thaliana loci (Additional file 2).
GO categorization

The annotated SM-I sequences were functionally
assigned using their A. thaliana orthologs as input (AGI
codes) (Additional file 2), these functions were then
arranged into GO slim categories (Figure 2) [15]. Since
a given gene product can be associated with more than
one GO term, the total number of GO terms exceeded
that of the unigenes [14,16]. The eggplant SM-I
sequences resolved into 24,522 GO terms associated
with “biological process”, 15,137 with “cellular component” and 12,144 with “molecular function”. The
“response to biotic stimulus” category applied to 492
sequences (290 GO terms), among which the majority
was related to the defense response against bacterial

Page 3 of 9

(22.1%), nematode (10.3%) and fungal (9.3%) infection.
These sequences, especially the fungal response ones,
are of particular interest, as ‘305E40’ carries a major
gene conferring resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
melongenae [9,17]. Among the “response to abiotic stimulus” sequences (937 sequences, 737 GO terms),
19.5% were associated with the response to salinity
stress, 12.3% to low temperature and 7.7% to high temperature. Globally, the sequences were assigned to a
wide range of gene ontology categories, indicating that a
wide representation of transcripts was originally present
in the RAD tags. Since about 12,000 SM-I eggplant
sequences were annotated, it seems plausible to assume
that we were able to capture a consistent fraction of the
eggplant gene space.
SNP identification

Just over 10,000 SNPs were identified between the mapping parents, involving 5,179 of the 31,635 shared
sequences (later referred as 10 K, Additional file 3), as
well as 874 indels (Table 1). To minimize false positives
with respect to the SNPs, paired-end reads and SNP
calling based on deep multiple alignment (minimum 6x
coverage) were applied. The global inter-samples SNP

frequency was 0.8 per Kb, and the indel frequency 0.07
per Kb. We report the current SNP frequency as mostly
belonging to the un-transcribed portion of the eggplant
genome since we adopted two endonucleases recognizing GC-rich sites, being one methylation sensitive
(SgrAI). This SNP frequency is lower than has been
detected in potato (11.5 per Kb; [18]), grapevine (2.5 per
Kb in coding and 5.5 in non-coding sequence; [19]),
barley (6.3 per Kb in coding sequence; [20]), maize (8.9
per Kb in coding sequence; [20]) and Citrus spp. (6.1
per Kb; [21]), but is similar to that found in tomato (0.6
per Kb; [22]), sweet pepper (1.0 per Kb; [23]), rice (1.7
per Kb; [24]) and confirmed the low level of intra-specific genetic polymorphism previously observed in eggplant [9]. As pointed out by Schneider et al. [25],
however, inter-specific comparisons of SNP frequency
are problematic, given that polymorphism is germplasm, genomic context- and mating system-dependent.
About two thirds of the SNPs proved to be transitions
(Figure 3), which have generally been found to be the
predominant type [23,25-27]. The transition/transversion ratio has been suggested to be high in a situation
where a low level of genetic divergence applies, decreasing as the genetic distance between the comparator genomes rises [28,29]. The relatively high ratio of 1.65
probably therefore reflects the overall low level of polymorphism between the two mapping parents, as is generally the case within the cultivated gene pool of
eggplant [10]. A rather high frequency of C/T alleles
was observed, as also noted for bean [30], maize [27]
and Citrus spp. [21,31]. In about 25% of the SNP loci,
there was no additional sequence variation in either the
upstream or the downstream 60 bp and almost all of
them (2,354 out of 2,435) were associated with a quality
score > 0.4 (the minimum threshold for the GoldenGate
assay) and 2,201 produced a score of > 0.6. The identification of > 10,000 potential SNPs is clearly a major
advance for eggplant genotyping; incorporation of a
sample of the 2,354 high quality SNPs into a GoldenGate assay would certainly saturate the ‘305E40’ × ‘67/3’

linkage map, while many of the remaining ~8,000 SNPs
could be assayed by other technologies, such as the
Affymetrix SNP chip or the High Resolution Melting
technique [32].
The successful identification of a large number of SNP
(and indel and SSR) markers highlights the utility of the
RAD approach for uncovering genome-wide polymorphisms, especially in materials with low polymorphism
[33]. The versatility of the method lies in the ease with
which different samples of the genome can be accessed
merely by changing the identity of the restriction
enzyme(s) used to cleave the genomic DNA; its particular advantage in the context of SNP discovery lies in the
ease of aligning short DNA fragments between contrasting templates. Note also that the application of Illumina
sequencing allowed for the identification of polymorphic
sites outside of the restriction enzyme recognition site
[13].
Genetic diversity revealed by SNP markers

A sample of 384 of the 2,201 highest quality SNPs
(score > 0.6) was assembled into a GoldenGate assay,
which was then applied to genotype 23 S. melongena
templates (Table 2), a representative panel of eggplant
germplasm which captured a large part of variation with
respect to fruit shape and colour (including ‘305E40’

and ‘67/3’), together with one accession of S. aethiopicum. Of these, 343 produced non- ambiguous data, a
percentage in agreement with that previously reported
in maize [34] and soybean [35]. The two duplicated genotypes included as internal controls gave consistent
calls, indicating that the assay was highly robust. The
frequency of missed calls was ~ 0.6% among the eggplant templates, but was 16.0% for the S. aethiopicum
template. PIC values ranged from 0.29 to 0.5 (mean
0.43), with 240 of the markers producing a PIC value >
0.4, a level which is suitable for genetic diversity analyses. The phylogeny of the germplasm accessions based
on these SNPs suggested the presence of two major
clades (Figure 4); one included ‘305E40’ together with
its progenitors ‘Dourga’, ‘Tal1/1’, ‘DR2’ and S. aethiopicum, while the second included ‘67/3’. Within each of
these major clades, a number of sub-clades correlated
with fruit shape could be recognized. Thus, the phenotypic divergence between the pair of mapping parents
appears to be representative of the genetic variation present within the cultivated gene pool.

Identification of SSRs

A screen of the SM-I dataset resulted in the identification
of 1,797 sequences containing 1,877 putative SSRs. A
small number of these SSRs (22) were discarded as they
had already been previously identified [7,10,11]. The SSR
was present in both mapping parents for 1,145
sequences, in ‘305E40’ alone for 381 sequences, and in
‘67/3’ alone for 329 sequences. At least 1,119 sequences
permitted the design of PCR primers, leading to the generation of 1,155 putative markers (Additional file 4).
About 4.1% of the SM-I sequences contained an SSR
(equivalent to a density of one SSR per 9.0 Kb), which is
comparable to the success rate recorded from ESTs of
eggplant [7,10] and tomato [36], somewhat higher than
in potato [36] but lower than in either coffee [36] or
sweet pepper [36,37]. Thus the RAD technique appears
to offer an effective means of discovering SSRs, especially
given the understanding that SSRs are more common in
transcribed rather than in genomic sequences [38].
The most abundant repeat motif among the RAD
SSRs were trinucleotides (34.6%), followed by dinucleotides (18.6%) and pentanucleotides (16.6%) (Table 3),
consistent with the observations of Stagel et al. [10].
The most common di- and tri-nucleotide motifs were
AT (9.6%) and AAC (19.0%) (Table 4), in contrast to
the observation in a previous study, where AG and
AAG were the predominant motifs [10,14,36-39]. On
the other hand Shirasawa et al. [40] showed that among
tomato genomic SSRs, AAT is the most abundant trinucleotide and AT the most abundant dinucleotide motif,
while in wheat, AAC is the predominant trinucleotide
SSR motif [41]. SSRs composed of either AGG and
CCG repeats were rather rare, as reported by Stagel et
al. [10] in eggplant but also in other recent studies on
Epimidium sagittatum [14] and Vigna radiata [42].
These particular motifs are relatively uncommon in
dicotyledonous plant genomes [14,36], although they do
feature in monocotyledonous ones [38,43]. Among the
160 mononucleotide SSRs detected, 151 were A/T; these
loci have been suggested as providing a means of filling
gaps in linkage maps constructed with higher order
SSRs [36].

Conclusions
The RAD method was highly successful for the rapid
and large-scale discovery of DNA markers, even in a
species recognized to be low polymorphic. Applied to a
pair of eggplant mapping parents, the approach was able
to define over 10,000 SNPs, 1,600 indels and 1,800 putative SSRs. The current eggplant genetic maps are far
from saturated, and as such have had little impact on
breeding. The early maps were based on a wide cross, as
this was considered necessary to achieve a sufficient
level of polymorphism for the markers then available.

With the rapid advances being made in sequencing
technology, it is now possible to work with intra-specific
crosses which are more relevant to the breeder. The
present study has generated a large number of SNP,
indel and SSR assays, which should permit the rapid
saturation of the best available intra-specific genetic
map [9].
Our primary goal was the identification of SNP markers, however data from RAD tags sequencing made it
also possible the identification of SSR motifs and respective primers pairs for their amplification. The multi-allelic SSR markers are currently widely applied for both
genetic mapping and diversity analyses, despite their cost
for development and their limited throughput capabilities
[44]. During the last few years the exploitation of publicly
available EST sequences leaded to the identification of
several thousands of new SSRs markers in a wide range
of vegetables species like tomato, pepper, globe artichoke,
Brassica, as well as eggplant [10,36,37,39,44,45]

The GoldenGate SNP array was highly robust for S.
melongena germplasm, but also has potential for a widecross population as 84% of the loci were scorable in a
contrast between cultivated eggplant and its relative S.
aethiopicum. Since these DNA markers define a specific
position in the eggplant genome, they should be useful
for merging the various genetic linkage maps currently
available, some of which include loci related to important agronomic traits. Finally, the markers are very
informative for the analysis of genetic diversity, as well
as for comparative studies across species within the
Solanaceae family.

Methods
Plant materials and DNA isolation

DNA was extracted from the two eggplant lines ‘305E40’
and ‘67/3’, which are the parents of an F2 intra-specific
mapping population [9]. The female parent, double-haploid line ‘305E40’, produces long, highly pigmented dark
purple fruit. The parent ‘305E40’ is an introgression line
derived from the somatic hybrid S. melongena cv.
‘Dourga’(+)S. aethiopicum [46] which was backcrossed
with a tetraploid plant of the eggplant line ‘DR2’ and
then subjected to anther culture; an anther-derived
dihaploid plant was backcrossed 4 times with the line
‘Tal1/1’, then selfed two times and, finally, made completely homozygous through anther culture [17,44]. The
male parent, line ‘67/3’, was an F 8 selection from the
intra-specific cross cvs. ‘Purpura’ × ‘CIN2’. Its fruit is
round and violet coloured. The DNAs extracted from a
set of 23 accessions (including the two mapping parents)
representative of the S. melongena gene pool (Table 2),
together with an accession of S. aethiopicum (a progenitor of ‘305E40’) were tested with a subset of the newly
developed SNP assays. All DNA samples were extracted
from young leaves, using the GenElute™ Plant Genomic
DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
RAD library preparation, sequencing, assembly

The RAD library was constructed at Floragenex Inc.
(USA), according to the protocol described by Baird
et al. [13], as follows. Genomic DNA (300 ng) was

digested for 60 min at 37° C in a 50 μL reaction containing 20 U each of SgrAI and PstI (New England Biolabs, Beverly MA, USA). The reactions were stopped by
holding at 65° C for 20 min. The P1 adapter (a modified
Illumina adapter, see Baird et al. [13] was ligated to the
products of the restriction reaction, and the “barcoding”
of the various samples was achieved with a set of index
nucleotides in the P1 adapter sequence. A 2.5 μL aliquot
of 100 nM P1 adapter was added to each sample, along
with 1 μL 10 mM ATP (Promega), 1 μL 10 × NEB Buffer4, 1 μL (equivalent to 1,000 U) T4 DNA ligase (Enzymatics, Inc) and 5 μL water, and the reaction was
incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then
heat-inactivated (20 min at 65° C). The reactions were
then pooled and the products randomly sheared to a
mean size of 500 bp using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). The
material was electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose
gel, and the DNA in the range 300-800 bp isolated
using a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The
dsDNA ends were treated with end blunting enzymes
(Enzymatics, Inc) to remove overhangs, and the samples
purified by passing through a MinElute column (Qiagen). 3’-adenine overhangs were then added by the addition of 15 U Klenow exo- (Enzymatics), followed by an
incubation at 37° C for 10 min. Following re-purification, 1 μL 10 μM P2 adapter (a modified Illumina adapter, see Baird et al. [13]) was ligated, as described above
for P1. The samples were then purified as above, and
eluted in a volume of 50 μL. Following quantification
(Qubit fluorimeter), 20 ng were taken as the template
for a 100 μL PCR containing 20 μL Phusion Master Mix
(NEB), 5 μL 10 μM P1 adapter primer (Illumina), 5 μL
10 μM P2 adapter primer (Illumina) and water. The
Phusion PCR settings followed product guidelines (NEB)
over 18 cycles. The amplicons were gel purified, the size
range 300-700 bp was excised from the gel, its DNA
content adjusted to 3 ng/μL. RADs from each parent
were sequenced on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, San
Diego, CA) using paired end 54 bp sequence reads. The
paired end sequences from each parent were pooled and
segregated by single read RAD sequences. Velvet [47]
was used to assemble consensus LongRead contigs from
the paired end data. Repetitive element occurrence was
searched via CENSOR, a software tool which screens
query sequences against a reference collection of repeats
(http://www.girinst.org/censor; [48]), adopting default
parameters and considering Viridiplantae as target
database.
Sequence annotation

CAP3 [49] algorithm was used to identify sequences in
common between the mapping parents using default
parameters with some modifications (overlap length cutoff = 80 and overlap percent identity cut-off = 95). The

Page 7 of 9

resulting dataset (SM-I; Solanum melongena-Illumina)
included singlets from ‘67/3’ and ‘305E40’ as well as
contigs deriving from both RAD rounds. A stand-alone
BLAST tool was used to provide the optimal annotation
for each dataset.
A BlastN search was performed against the SGN Cornell unigene database (http://solgenomics.net/), using as
cut-off parameters 90% identity and a minimum alignment of 100 bp. A second BlastN search was made
against the 16 K Fukuoka eggplant unigene dataset (in
the article referred as 16 K, http://vegmarks.nivot.affrc.
go.jp[11]), using as cut-off parameters 95% identity and
a minimum alignment of 100 bp. A BlastX search was
carried out against the TAIR9 dataset (http://www.arabidopsis.org), adopting a threshold E-value of e-15. The
annotated sequences were assigned a function based on
the Gene Ontology tool available at TAIR (http://www.
arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/), using A. thaliana orthologs as input (AGI codes), and mapped to higher level
categories (plant GO Slim) using GOSlimViewer [50]
according to the three principal GO categories “molecular function”, “biological process” and “cellular localization” [15].
SNP discovery

SNPs were called using a short read alignment algorithm [51] which aligned non-assembled 50 bp Illumina
reads from ‘67/3’ against the ‘305E40’ assembly, by analogy with the MAQ style sequence pileup [52] at a minimum coverage of 6x; to call indels, an SSAHA-based
alignment strategy [53] was applied. Both SNPs and
indels were regarded as true polymorphisms, when each
allele was observed at least three times.
Each SNP was assigned a designability score via a
dedicated “assay design tool” (http://www.illumina.com),
which identified SNP loci free of other polymorphisms
60 bp either upstream or downstream. A quality score,
based on the probability of good performance using the
Illumina Golden Gate assay, was assigned to each SNP,
where a score > 0.6 indicated a high probability of
success.
Genetic diversity assessment based on the GoldenGate
assay

The GoldenGate assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was
used for SNP genotyping at the UC Davis Genome Center. Automatic allele calling for each locus was obtained
by GenCall software (Illumina). As an internal control,
two duplicate templates were included in each run. An
estimate of PIC (Polymorphism Information Content)
was made following the suggestion of Anderson et al.
[54]. Each SNP locus was scored in binary fashion. A
co-phenetic distance matrix based on co-dominant markers was generated, as described by Smouse et al. [55]

and used to construct a UPGMA-based dendrogram as
implemented within NTSYS software package v2.10 [56].

SSR identification

SSR motifs were identified by SciRoKo software [57].
Both perfect and imperfect mono, di-, tri-, tetra-, pentaand hexanucleotide motifs were targeted. Primer pairs
were designed from the flanking sequences using PRIMER3 software [58] in batch mode, as implemented in
the SciRoKo package. The target amplicon size range
was set as 125-250 bp, the optimal annealing temperature 60° C, and the optimal primer length 20 bp.
