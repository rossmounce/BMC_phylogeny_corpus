Abstract
Background: Aseptic meningitis is a relatively frequent childhood disease and virologic data
suggest that enteroviruses are the commonest etiologic agents. We evaluated the epidemiologic
characteristics of aseptic meningitis in Daejeon, South Korea from 1987 to 2003.
Methods: 2201 medical records of children with aseptic meningitis admitted to The Catholic
University of Korea, Daejeon St Mary's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.
Results: Outbreaks of aseptic meningitis were observed in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1997, 2001 and 2002.
The age distribution of cases was relatively uniform, with a higher incidence in those aged < 1 year
and 4–7 years. The male-to-female ratio was 2:1. There was a higher incidence of disease in the
summer (May to August, 74.1% of total). Comparison of the largest epidemics in 1997 and 2002
showed significant differences in the incidence in those < 1 year (11.8% vs. 4.4%, respectively; P =
0.001). Neurologic sequelae were observed in 0.7% of the patients.
Conclusion: Aseptic meningitis, rare before the 1980s in Korea, has since become a common
clinical entity. Since 1990, outbreaks of aseptic meningitis have occurred every 1 to 3 years in
Daejeon in keeping with Korea-wide epidemics. The frequency of disease affecting children less
than one year of age may reflect herd immunity to the epidemic strain.

Background
Aseptic meningitis is a relatively common disease of childhood and recent data suggest that it is most frequently
caused by enteroviruses [1,2]. Although globally aseptic
meningitis occurs year-round, there is a marked seasonality, with an incidence peak in the summer months in temperate climates. In Korea, epidemics of aseptic meningitis
have occurred approximately every 3 years since the early

1990s. Whilst there have been a number of studies
addressing the clinical characteristics and the causative
agents of these epidemics [3-15], long term epidemiologic
studies of aseptic meningitis are rare. A variety of enteroviruses have been suggested as the predominant causative
agents for each Korean epidemic, with enterovirus 71 or
echovirus 30 in 1990 [6], echovirus 9 in 1993 [7], echovi-

ture and latex particle agglutination test. Studies to identify viral pathogens were not routinely undertaken in
these hospitals, especially during epidemics, as the available data suggests that causative agents other than enteroviruses are relatively rare [6,7,11-15]. Other nonenteroviral causes of meningitis occurring during the
study period were excluded from the current analysis.
These included cases of mumps meningitis (n = 66; 1989–
1998) [16], bacterial meningitis (n = 40; 1992–2002) [17]
and herpes meningo-encephalitis (n = 3). We analyzed
the age and gender of patients, together with monthly and
annual frequency. In addition, we evaluated the frequency
of neurological complications among the patients hospitalized for more than 10 days. The epidemiologic features
of the patients from the two years with the highest incidence, 1997 and 2002, were also compared.

In this study, we describe the epidemiologic characteristics of pediatric aseptic meningitis during a 17 year period,
from 1987 to 2003, in Daejeon, South Korea, with particular emphasis on the two largest epidemics, in 1997 and
2002.

Methods
We retrospectively analyzed a total of 2201 medical
records of pediatric patients with aseptic meningitis
patients admitted to The Catholic University of Korea,
Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital from January 1987 to December 2003. Daejeon, located in central Korea, is one of the
largest cities with a population of over 1.4 million. The
majority of the patients with aseptic meningitis were
admitted to one of four general hospitals in Daejeon.
There were no significant changes of medical facilities or
the social environment during the study period. Epidemic
years were defined as those with more than 100 patients
per year and at least a two-fold increase in cases compared
to the previous year. The diagnosis of aseptic meningitis
was made on the basis of: (i) clinical symptoms and signs
of meningitis, such as fever, vomiting, headache, and
meningeal irritation, (ii) cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (≥ 5 leukocytes/mm3) with normal CSF protein
and sugar levels and (iii) negative results on bacterial cul-

Age and sex distribution
2201 children fulfilled the study criteria. The mean age
was 6.0 ± 3.9 years (range 2 weeks to 15 years). The highest incidence was in those aged 4 to 7 years (44.1% of total
cases) and in those less than 1 year old (10% of total),
with the remaining cases evenly distributed across the
remaining ages (Fig. 1). There were 1470 males and 731
females, giving a male-to-female ratio of approximately
2:1. Although enteroviral studies were not performed routinely during the study period, enteroviruses were identified in a proportion of patients in the 1997 and 2002
epidemics (Table 1). The mean duration of hospitalization was 5.5 ± 1.7 days. There were no fatalities.
Annual incidence
The number of aseptic meningitis cases per year ranged
from 17 (0.8% of total cases) in 1987 to 489 (21.7%) in
1997; the average was 129 cases per year. The greatest
number of cases were observed in 1997, 2002 and 1993,
with 489 (21.7%) of total, 366 (16.6%) and 257 (11.7%)
patients, respectively. Outbreaks occurred approximately
every three years in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1997, 2001 and
2002 (Fig. 1).
Monthly and seasonal frequencies
There was a striking seasonal pattern, with almost three
quarters of cases occurring during the summer months
(May to August) (Fig. 2). Of the total of 2201 cases, 540
(24.5%) presented in June, 378 (17.2%) in July, 371
(16.9%) in May, and 341 (15.5%) in August (Fig. 2).
Comparison of epidemiologic features of the epidemics in
1997 and 2002
1997 and 2002 had the largest epidemics of aseptic meningitis in the study period. There was no significant difference between in these two large epidemics in the age of
children and the monthly distribution. However, in 1997,

there was a higher frequency in those < 1 year of age than
in 2002 (11.8% vs. 4.4%, P = 0.001, X2 test) (Fig. 2).
Neurologic sequelae
Medical records of the 127 children hospitalized for ≥ 10
days were analyzed for possible complications. Although
other complications of the gastrointestinal or respiratory
system were noted, only neurological complications were
evaluated in this study. Neurological complications were
noted in 16 patients (0.7% of total). All children with
neurological complications had abnormal mental status
or abnormal neurological symptoms and signs following
their aseptic meningitis and had been neurologically normal previously. Seizures were observed in 5 children, of
whom two developed status epilepticus. Transient amnesia was observed in 2 children; one had antegrade amnesia, and the other had retrograde amnesia. One child had
an inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone and
mild hydrocephalus. One child showed transient signs of
quadriplegia. Thirteen of the 16 children with neurological complications were followed up for at least 2 months.
No permanent neurological sequelae were observed.

Discussion
Although there have been a number of studies of aseptic
meningitis in Korea [3-15], there are few epidemiologic
studies of this scope and duration. Historically, aseptic
meningitis appears to have been relatively unusual in
Korea prior to the 1980s, but this may partly reflect ascertainment bias and diagnostic methods. Chung et al.
described 104 cases of childhood meningitis from 1960–
1967, with 41 cases of aseptic meningitis cases and 63
bacterial meningitis cases [3]. Rheu et al. reported an
increasing incidence of aseptic meningitis in the Wonju
area of Korea from 1966 to 1983; among the total of 200
cases of aseptic meningitis, there were 1–3 cases per year
from 1966–1971, 6–23 cases per year in 1972–1982, and
40 cases in 1983 [4]. Similar findings are reported from
Busan during the 1980s, with 5–19 cases annually
between 1980 and 1988, 30 cases in 1989 and 56 cases in

1990 [5]. These results suggest that the nationwide epidemics of aseptic meningitis in Korea started in the early
1990s. The striking change in epidemiology at this time,
with the occurrence of epidemics, may partly reflect
improved diagnosis and increased awareness. In addition,
changes in herd immunity may have contributed to an
increased population susceptibility to epidemics of virus
transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Public health improvements that accompanied this period of marked economic
growth in Korea may have reduced sporadic exposure to
enteroviruses and led to a large non-immune population.
Similar patterns have been observed in the rapidly declining seroprevalence of hepatitis A in Korea. Hepatitis A,
which is a kind of enteroviruses and also spread by the
fecal-oral route, currently has a seroprevalence in Korean
children < 15 years old of almost zero [18,19].
In this study, epidemics of aseptic meningitis in Daejeon
mirrored the nationwide epidemics in 1990 [5,6], 1993
[7,8], 1996 [9], 1997 [10], 2001 and 2002 [12-14]. A
nationwide study of 5090 patients in 1993 showed that
the epidemic of aseptic meningitis commenced in the
southern regions in spring, and then gradually moved to
the northern regions (including Seoul), reaching a peak
incidence in summer and then waned by late fall [8]. Similar patterns have been observed in other epidemics in
Korea [5,6] and may reflect the geographical and social
environment with a large and mobile population contributing to the nationwide spread of the disease. Aseptic
meningitis is generally commoner in males with a maleto-female ratio of 1.2–2.3 to 1 [4-13], as observed in the
current study.
Globally the age distribution during epidemics of aseptic
meningitis varies, possibly due to different causative
agents and specific herd immunity that results from varying socio-economic environments and other factors. For
example, in the United States, the peak age for children
with aseptic meningitis is reported to be < 1 year old
[1,2,20], whereas in five South African epidemics in the

both infants and adults suggests a new epidemic strain
with low herd immunity.
Previous studies in Korea have reported that enteroviruses
predominate in each nationwide epidemic (Table 1).
Enteroviruses include more than 70 serotypes, but only a
few serotypes typically cause aseptic meningitis in any
given community and during any given year. This may be
due to differences in the background rate of infection in a
community (herd immunity), in host immunity and possibly in the viral strain's neurotropism. Recently, echovirus 13 meningitis epidemics have been reported in Europe
in 2000 [24,25], in the United States in 2001 [26], and in
Korea in 2002 [12-14]. The genotype of echovirus 13 isolated in Korea in 2002 is almost identical to that isolated
in Japan and Germany [14]. Thus, aseptic meningitis epidemics from an enteroviral strain may spread globally.

Comparison of age distribution between in 1997 and in 2002.

1980s, the mean age of children with echovirus meningitis was 4–5 years of age, whereas those with coxsackie B
meningitis were most commonly <1 year old [21]. In
Japan, Yamashita et al. analyzed 8595 cases of aseptic
meningitis from 1981–1991. There were two peak ages of
< 1 year and 4–7 years, with varying age distributions
according to the causative virus in each epidemic [22].
Although Korea and Japan have similar geographical,
racial and socio-economic environments, the period of
marked Korean economic growth occurred later than in
Japan. The Korean epidemiologic data from the 1990s is
similar to those from the 1980s in Japan [22,23], possibly
reflecting similar changes in important determinants of
epidemiology.
The pattern of age distribution in an aseptic meningitis
epidemic may reflect herd immunity from past infection
with the same causative virus. Aseptic meningitis is rare in
younger adults in Korea, whereas adults aged 20 and 40
years have an incidence similar to children in the United
States [20]. In addition, there were differences in incidence in infants (< 1 year old) with each epidemic, suggesting that herd immunity from previous infections with
enteroviruses is reflected in protective transplacental antibodies. Maternal (transplacental) antibodies are detected
in over half of the infants aged 6 months, and may persist
for up to 12 months after birth. Thus a high incidence in

Children with enteroviral meningitis generally recover
without complications, but rarely the disease can cause
neurologic sequelae [1,2,8]. The clinical manifestations
and outcome may differ with the enterovirus serotype. For
example, a more severe clinical course and worse outcome
with enterovirus 71 infections have been reported both in
Korea and in other countries [27,28]. In the current study,
16 children (0.7%) with aseptic meningitis had neurological complications; 2 children in 1990, 4 in 1993, 4 in
1997, and 1 child each in six other years. No single epidemic resulted in a significantly larger number of neurologic sequelae, although the denominator was small as
the outcome was generally excellent.

Conclusion
Aseptic meningitis appears to have been a rare disease in
Korea during the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1990, outbreaks
of aseptic meningitis have occurred every 1–3 years in
Daejeon in keeping with nation-wide epidemics. The
changing epidemiology may reflect improvements in
public health, characteristics of the predominant etiologic
agents and changes in herd immunity. In particular, the
incidence of aseptic meningitis in children less than one
year of age in each epidemic may be indicative of the
agent-specific immunity of the parental generation.
