Abstract
Background: Genomic islands (GIs) are clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes of probable
horizontal origin. GIs are disproportionately associated with microbial adaptations of medical or
environmental interest. Recently, multiple programs for automated detection of GIs have been
developed that utilize sequence composition characteristics, such as G+C ratio and dinucleotide
bias. To robustly evaluate the accuracy of such methods, we propose that a dataset of GIs be
constructed using criteria that are independent of sequence composition-based analysis
approaches.
Results: We developed a comparative genomics approach (IslandPick) that identifies both very
probable islands and non-island regions. The approach involves 1) flexible, automated selection of
comparative genomes for each query genome, using a distance function that picks appropriate
genomes for identification of GIs, 2) identification of regions unique to the query genome,
compared with the chosen genomes (positive dataset) and 3) identification of regions conserved
across all genomes (negative dataset). Using our constructed datasets, we investigated the accuracy
of several sequence composition-based GI prediction tools.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that AlienHunter has the highest recall, but the lowest measured
precision, while SIGI-HMM is the most precise method. SIGI-HMM and IslandPath/DIMOB have
comparable overall highest accuracy. Our comparative genomics approach, IslandPick, was the
most accurate, compared with a curated list of GIs, indicating that we have constructed suitable
datasets. This represents the first evaluation, using diverse and, independent datasets that were not
artificially constructed, of the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI predictors. The
caveats associated with this analysis and proposals for optimal island prediction are discussed.

Background
Bacteria are the most abundant Domain of life that exists
on earth (based on biomass) [1]. The species we see today
are highly diverse, reflecting adaptations to a wide range
of environments over billions of years. One of the major
sources of adaptability for bacteria is the ability to obtain
genes horizontally from other sources, including other

prokaryotes, viruses, and even eukaryotes [2]. Analysis of
bacterial genomic sequences has indicated that many of
the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events observed in
bacteria involve clusters of genes. Collectively, these
genomic regions are referred to as genomic islands (GIs)
[3]. GIs, which range in size from ~5–500 kb, have
become of significant interest, since they are frequently

observed to encode genes involved in particular adaptive
functions of medical and environmental importance
[4,5]. The concept of GIs was derived from the term pathogenicity island, which was initially coined by Hacker and
colleagues to describe a genomic region of uropathogenic
Escherichia coli that harbours clusters of virulence factors
that can be spontaneously deleted [6]. These regions also
exhibit other sequence and annotation features that can
be used to distinguish them from the rest of the genomes,
as described below [3]. Subsequently, the term GI was
adapted to describe genomic regions that contain similar
features as PAIs but encode gene products of other functions. Reflecting the wide variety of genes found in GIs,
function-specific terms such as "antibiotic resistance
islands" (encode antibiotic resistance genes), "fitness
islands" and "metabolic islands" (encode adaptive metabolic properties such as phenolic compound degradation)
have been invented to describe different types of GIs [3].
Previous characterization of GIs has identified many
sequence and annotation features that are frequently associated with GIs, such as differing sequence composition
(%G+C, dinucleotide bias, codon usage bias, etc.), flanking direct repeats, and the presence of mobility and tRNA
genes in the region [4,7-9]. Computational tools have
therefore been developed to aid the identification of
islands in genomic sequences that are based on sequence
composition analysis [10-16]. These tools rely on the
observation that different organisms exhibit different
nucleotide pattern preferences that constitute their
genome signatures. More closely related organisms are
assumed to share similar preferences and, therefore, have
more similar signatures. As a result, for a gene-cluster
whose signature deviates from the genome signature, a
plausible explanation is that this gene cluster has a foreign
origin and its signature reflects that of the original donor.
The tools, therefore, in general calculate the frequencies of
oligo-nucleotides (typically ranging from 2 to 9) for a subregion of a genome and compare these results with the
expected frequencies from that genome. One advantage of
this approach is that GI prediction can be made from a
single genome sequence. However, GI predictors based on
sequence composition may lead to false positive GI predictions due to other factors causing a bias in sequence
composition, such as high gene expression level [17]. Furthermore, these approaches may miss the identification of
GIs that have been acquired from genomes with similar
sequence composition or more ancient GI acquisition
events that may have ameliorated to the host genome
sequence composition over time [18].
An alternative approach that is independent from
sequence composition-based approaches is to use comparative genomics to identify genomic regions that have a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329

clear phyletic pattern of non-vertical inheritance. In these
methods, putative GIs are often defined as clusters of
genes in one genome that are not present in a related
genome. They are based on the observation that GIs are
sporadically distributed among closely related species or
strains and can sometimes be found between very distantly related species as judged by the degrees of sequence
divergence in 16S rRNAs or other orthologs [19]. Until
recently, this approach could only be performed manually
for a few species that had enough similar sequenced
genomes [20-25]. However, recent research has started to
utilize the increasing number of completely sequenced
genomes by constructing tools that can perform largescale genomic comparisons, such as MobilomeFINDER
[26] and MOSAIC [27]. MobilomeFINDER uses whole
genome alignments to identify GIs, but is similar to
Islander [13], such that it is limited to identifying only
islands that have inserted in disrupted tRNAs. Although
MOSAIC identifies strain specific regions that have not
necessarily inserted into a tRNA, it can mistakenly identify
inversions and translocations between genomes as strainspecific regions. In addition to these limitations, all current comparative genomics based GI prediction tools
require the manual selection of both the query and the
comparative genomes as input, which may result in
inconsistent selection criteria due to the unfamiliarity of
different phylogenetic distances within genera.
We now report here the development of "IslandPick", the
first completely automated comparative genomics
approach to identify GIs. Starting with all sequenced bacterial genomes as input, we use stringent but potentially
flexible criteria, with distance cutoffs, to select query
genomes that have a sufficient number of suitably related
species or strains to conduct an analysis of GIs. We used
this IslandPick method to identify datasets of GIs from
several genomes as well as a dataset of conserved backbone genomic regions that are probable non-GIs. We evaluated how well these datasets agreed with GIs reported in
the literature. We also evaluated how well these datasets
agreed with those predicted using previously published
sequence composition-based GI tools since our comparative genomics based method is independent of sequence
composition-based methods. Analyses of GI/HGT prediction tools have been previously published, but have used
either artificial datasets or real data from only a few species [15,28]. Our IslandPick method reported here focuses
on developing robust positive and negative datasets that
can be used as an independent non-artificial benchmark
for previous and future GI prediction tools. Moreover, as
additional genome sequences become available, IslandPick can be applied to those genomes to expand the
benchmark dataset in a consistent and automated fashion.

Results
Genomic island predictions
In order to evaluate the sensitivity/recall of previously
developed GI predictors based on sequence composition
bias, we constructed a dataset of putative GIs based on a
high-throughput comparative genomics approach that we
developed. GIs were identified as regions that were
present only in the genome being queried when compared to multiple genomes from closely-related species or
strains (see Methods: Detecting GIs using comparative
genomics). Of the 675 completely sequenced microbial
genomes, 736 chromosomes were initially used as queries
in our pipeline (Fig. 1). 377 of these did not have at least
3 related species/strains while many others did not meet
our stringent criteria to do a comparative analysis. However, as more genome sequences become available, the
number of genomes matching our criteria is expected to
improve. We found that 173 chromosomes met our
requirements for the prediction of GIs and conserved
backbone sequences. A subset of 134 chromosomes contained GIs while our method did not detect GIs using our
method in the other 39 chromosomes [see Additional file
1]. Many of these 39 genomes may contain GIs that are
smaller than 8 kb or have other cases of HGT that were not
being targeted by our approach. The dataset was further
reduced to 118 chromosomes, because a negative dataset
could not be predicted for 14 chromosomes and the GI
prediction tool SIGI-HMM gave errors on another 2 chromosomes (see below). In total, we identified 771 GIs,
comprising 12.4 Mb and ranging in size from 8–31 kb,
within 118 chromosomes from 117 different strains and
22 genera [see Additional file 2]. These putative GIs contained a total of 11,404 annotated genes with an average
of 14.8 genes/GI and 97.5 genes/strain [see Additional file
3].
Negative Dataset
In order to evaluate the specificity/precision of previously
developed GI predictors we constructed a dataset of
genomic regions that were not likely to contain GIs. We
adapted our GI prediction pipeline to identify large
genomic regions that were conserved in several genomes
(see Methods: Detecting highly conserved regions (nonGIs)). These conserved genomic regions were identified
for the same 134 query genomes that we used for prediction of GIs. We could not identify any conserved regions
larger than 8000 base pairs for 14 of these chromosomes,
using our conservative criteria, and so these were removed
from both the positive and negative datasets. The resulting
negative dataset was about 4 times larger than our dataset
of GIs, containing approximately 50.6 Mb over 3770 separate genomic regions [see Additional file 4]. The size difference between the negative and positive datasets was
expected since the proportion of HGT versus conserved
backbone in a genome is normally much smaller [29-31].

Pipeline 1 how single query genome as input of GIs are
Pipeline of how negative and positive datasets of GIs
are derived given a single query genome as input. A
pre-computed genome distance matrix using CVTree is
required as input as well as the query genome A). If there is
enough suitable reference genomes selected for comparison
with the query genome then the query genome and reference genomes are used in a Mauve multiple genome alignment and all conserved regions are extracted into a negative
dataset of GIs B). The positive dataset is constructed by taking each query genome and aligning it pair-wise with each reference genome. Then all unaligned overlapping regions found
in the query genome from the pair-wise alignments are filtered using the NCBI BLAST to ensure that they are truly
unique to the query genome C).

Comparison with previous literature
Although, there is no gold standard dataset of GIs, we
wanted to examine how previously published GIs overlapped with our datasets. We identified 5 strains from our
list of 117 that had published GIs [21-25]. As with the
analysis of the sequence composition based GI predictors
(see Results: Comparison to sequence based approaches),
we calculated the overlap of the published GIs against our
positive and negative dataset. We found, potentially due
in part to the similar manual comparative genomics
methods sometimes used to identify GIs in the literature

dataset, that the literature GIs had the most agreement
with our datasets (versus the GI predictors evaluated
below). Literature GIs had the highest precision, recall,
and overall accuracy of 100, 87%, and 96%, respectively,
when using IslandPick-predicted islands as the text dataset
(Table 1).
Comparison to sequence composition based approaches
The GIs and the non-GIs identified from our comparative
genomics approach were used as positive and negative
datasets, respectively, to evaluate the accuracy of several
previously published sequence based GI prediction tools
[8,12,15,16,29]. The tools were run using their default
parameters on the same 118 chromosomes and any overlapping regions with the negative dataset were considered
false positives while overlapping regions with the positive
dataset were considered true positives [see Additional file
5]. The following accuracy calculations were measured
using the number of overlapping nucleotides [see Additional file 6]; although results were not significantly different when counting only GIs with greater than 50%
overlap (data not shown). We found that the precision
and recall for the tools evaluated varied considerably
(Table 1). SIGI-HMM performed the best with 92% precision (though only 33% recall) whereas AlienHunter had
the best recall at 77% (though only 38% precision). SIGIHMM and the IslandPath/DIMOB tool had comparable
overall highest accuracy of 86% with IslandPath-DIMOB
more suitable for analyses requiring a slightly higher recall
(precision of 86% with a recall of 36%). All of the tools
had similar overall accuracies ranging from 82–86% (but
with differing emphasis on precision versus recall) except
for AlienHunter, which had an accuracy of only 71%. This
appeared to be primarily due to the large number of predictions being made by AlienHunter (1264.8 kb of GI/
genome) versus the other methods (163.2 to 444.2 kb of
GI/genome).

For completeness, we also calculated the accuracy of each
tool using every other tool as the benchmark [see Addi-

tional file 7]. The average accuracy measurements over all
benchmarks for each tool were very similar to those calculated using only our datasets indicating that the datasets
generated using our comparative genomic approach may
be an appropriate reference dataset for future use. These
positive and negative GI datasets, and the source code for
development of these datasets, are available at http://
www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandpick_GI_datasets.
Comparison of sequence composition based approaches
using additional GI datasets constructed with more relaxed
criteria
IslandPick defaults can be modified to allow the prediction of GIs with more ancient origins, and so we created
two additional datasets based on the selection of more
divergent genomes for use in GI and non-GI prediction
(see Methods). The first "relaxed" dataset had approximately 46% more GIs predicted per genome, while as
expected the negative datasets stayed about the same size
with a 3% increase in the relaxed dataset. Notably, accuracy relative to the literature dataset went down slightly
[see Additional file 8 and Additional file 9], indicating
that our IslandPick defaults do most accurately reflect literature-based GI data. The sequence composition-based
tools also all had a relative decrease in accuracy using this
more relaxed dataset: Accuracy decreased between 4.5 and
6.6% for all methods, with the exception of Alien Hunter
(the method with highest recall but lowest precision)
which showed the smallest decrease of 0.6% [see Additional file 8 and Additional file 9]. Using a second more
relaxed dataset of parameters resulted in yet another
decrease in predicted accuracy of the GI tools and the
accuracy relative to the literature-based dataset also
decreased further (data not shown). While the use of more
relaxed criteria for GI prediction may still have its uses,
our results indicate that the default settings of our IslandPick method are most appropriate for predicting islands
that most closely resemble what is reported in the literature. Also, the sequence composition-based methods

appear to perform best when using the default IslandPickpredicted GI datasets for evaluation.

Discussion
We have introduced and outlined, IslandPick, a novel
automated method for predicting GIs using comparative
genomics. We have used IslandPick, with its stringent
default criteria, to generate test datasets of GIs and non-GI
regions that are used to evaluate the accuracy of multiple
sequence composition based GI predictors. This represents the first evaluation of GI predictors based on real
(non-artificial) GI data from several different strains of
bacteria [15,28]. For organisms that have suitable
sequenced genomes for comparison, we identified very
probable GIs and genomic regions that were very probable non-GIs. By developing separate negative and positive
datasets that were independent of sequence composition
based approaches we were able to assess the accuracy of
several GI predictors.
According to our analysis, SIGI-HMM has the highest precision and shares comparable overall accuracy with
IslandPath/DIMOB which has higher recall at the expense
of precision. SIGI-HMM is the only tool tested that measures codon usage and notably it also identifies codon
usage associated with highly expressed genes and then discards such genes from the analysis. While more study is
needed, this suggests that regions displaying codon usage
bias of a pattern that is not associated with highly
expressed genes are more likely to be GIs. Consistent with
this, the IslandPath/DIMOB method that requires both a
dinucleotide bias and the presence of a mobility gene for
a GI prediction does much better than the IslandPath/
DINUC method which measures only dinucleotide bias.
The latter can result in false positives from highly
expressed genes but higher predictive recall/sensitivity.
AlienHunter had the lowest precision (38%); however, it
had by far the highest recall value (77%) with more than
twice as many predictions as any other tool.
Based on these results we suggest the use of SIGI-HMM for
making very precise predictions where a high confidence
dataset of GIs is preferred while AlienHunter can be used
as a first-pass tool to capture most GIs for further refinement. If suitable comparative genomes are available,
IslandPick would be a top choice for GI prediction, however it should be emphasized that IslandPick is at this
time really designed for generating robust island datasets
for evaluating GI predictors, rather than being a GI predictor itself. Its utility as a GI predictor could increase though
as more genome sequences, suitable for a comparative
genomics approach, are made available. If comparative
genomes are not available, the results generally suggest
that by combining multiple features of GIs, as in the
IslandPath/DIMOB dataset, and accounting for highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329

expressed genes, which SIGI-HMM does and IslandPath/
DIMOB does indirectly, a better overall predictor could be
created. More analysis of the differences in sequence composition between true positives and false positives in this
analysis could be insightful.
Our results show that all GI predictors had a decrease in
overall accuracy when trying to predict more ancient
islands. Considering that sequence composition based
predictors would have trouble detecting significant signals
in older GIs due to amelioration to the host genome, it
was not surprising that the overall accuracy for all tools
decreased [18]. Alien Hunter had the lowest decrease in
overall accuracy however it still maintained the lowest
precision and overall accuracy for the prediction of this
dataset and SIGI-HMM still out performed the other
sequence composition-based tools for predicting these
more divergent islands. It is possible that the accuracy of
some of these sequence composition-based tools could be
improved by optimizing their parameters. However, out
of all the tools, SIGI-HMM and Centroid were the only
ones with a clearly defined sensitivity/statistical parameter
and even for these there were no recommend suggestions
besides the default. Although default parameters for all
tools are presumably maximized to result in the best overall accuracy, some fine tuning may improve their results.
Of course there are clear limitations to predicting GIs
using comparative genomics in order to produce the GI
dataset used in our evaluation. The choice of reference
genomes for comparison to each query genome can result
in differences in the positive and negative datasets. In our
genome selection we use several distance cutoffs to minimize this bias as much as possible (example given in the
next paragraph). GIs could be present in the negative dataset if a GI was inserted before the divergence of all
genomes being examined. To minimize these in our datasets we require that at least 3 reference genomes be used
for each query genome and that at least one reference
genome is at least some minimal distance away from the
query genome. Similarly, we minimize the number of
false positives in our positive dataset by requiring that the
putative GI is present only in the query genome compared
to all reference genomes. Therefore, a deletion of the same
genomic region would need to occur independently in 3
or more strains for it to be mis-predicted as a GI in our
analysis. Similarly, a GI that inserted into multiple
genomes would have to be conserved in all of the diverse
genomes studied to be improperly placed in the negative
dataset. Although using several rules in our genome selection process results in very stringent datasets of GI and
non-GI regions, it does limit the number of organisms
that can be used by IslandPick. Relaxing the genome selection process by the removal of some of these cut-offs
would allow our approach to be applicable to more

Page 5 of 10

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:329

genomes. For example, by requiring only 3 genomes
within a certain maximum distance we would increase the
number of chromosomes usable by IslandPick from 173
to 359, based on the currently available genome
sequences. It should be emphasized that IslandPick was
not developed to be a GI prediction tool that would
replace sequence-based composition tools, which can be
used on any genome without the requirement of having
several other comparative genomes; rather, our IslandPick
approach allows the testing of these tools and in certain
cases can also be used for GI prediction (cases that should
increase notably in the future, as more and more genomes
are sequenced).
The absence of large islands (> 30 kb) in our positive dataset is probably due to the fact that only a few similar genes
between genome regions would cause our method to split
a large island into two smaller ones. Considering that as
an island gets bigger there is a greater chance of detecting
some similarity between the genomic regions being compared, we would expect that very large GIs may be split
into smaller ones. As indicated in recent research, this limitation could be improved in the future by spanning
together islands that are interrupted by only small regions
of low similarity [28]. It must also be appreciated that the
GI regions identified represent a set of GIs that were
acquired within a particular window of divergence of the
strains being examined. Any genomic regions that did not
have clear evidence of GI or non-GI status were not
included in either of the datasets so that tools that predicted such possible/uncertain GIs were not penalized.
This would include GIs that have inserted into multiple
strains or those that have partial similarity with other
genomic regions. Rather, our methodology penalizes
tools that falsely predict GIs in highly conserved backbone
regions that very likely do not contain true GIs, and also
the method penalizes tools that don't predict a subset of
GIs that are very likely true positives. In fact, our approach
produced the smallest dataset of GIs compared to all of
the methods we used in this study [see Additional file 5]
and the proportion of the genomes that are covered in
both of our positive and negative datasets combined,
ranges from 10%–30% per genome. Therefore, we do not
make predictions for the majority (70%–90%) of the
genome, reflecting the high accuracy of our positive and
negative datasets using our cutoffs. Also, our comparative
genomics-based GI datasets had the highest agreement
with the smaller curated, literature-based dataset.
As an example of the IslandPick approach, when Salmonella enterica Typhi CT18 is used as a query genome to
identify islands using our default cutoffs, very closely
related genomes including S. enterica Typhi Ty2 and S.
enterica Paratyphi A str. ATCC 9150 were excluded from
comparison. Therefore, we identify GIs that have inserted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329

after the divergence of S. enterica Typhi CT18 and the next
most related genome that has been sequenced, which is S.
typhimurium LT2. Islands that inserted before the divergence of CT18 and LT2 would also not be included in our
positive dataset, using these stringent cutoffs. However,
we require that at least one genome be a certain distance
from the query genome (Shigella dysenteriae Sd197 in this
example), so that these more ancient GIs are not improperly included in the negative dataset. We assume that any
sequences shared between the query genome (e.g. Salmonella enterica Typhi CT18) and the comparative genomes
including those that meet the single distant genome cutoff
(e.g. S. dysenteriae Sd197) are sufficiently stable and can
be considered as the conserved genome backbone. Again,
distance cutoffs can be modified in IslandPick to detect
more ancient islands or those acquired more recently.
Similar to other GI prediction tools we do not try to identify the origins or the methods of horizontal transfer for
these GIs. Indeed future research on many of these large
regions of HGT will likely allow them to be sub-classified
into known mobile elements such as conjugate transposons, integrated plasmids, integrons, and prophage;
and will depend on robust prediction tools and knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Also, new
sequence composition based GI prediction tools will
likely combine components from previous methods to
maximize both precision and recall [9]. Comparative
genomics studies like this one, will aid in these areas by
providing an independent method for GI prediction. As
more genomes are sequenced, the distance cutoffs used in
this method should be re-evaluated, but this overall
approach should only increase in utility as the number of
completely sequenced microbial genomes increases into
the thousands. This analysis of the accuracy of composition-based GI predictors should aid both development
and use of such predictors, which are becoming of increasing importance as the critical role of GIs in microbial evolution becomes more apparent.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated, through the comparison of our
IslandPick method with a reference literature dataset of
GIs, that the prediction of GIs can be performed using a
fully automated comparative genomics approach. We
produce reference GI datasets (positive and negative)
using IslandPick that allow an independent analysis of the
accuracy of several previously published sequence composition-based GI prediction tools. Our analyses of the accuracy of GI predictors should aid researchers in formulating
an appropriate approach to identify GIs, based on
whether they prefer high recall/sensitivity or precision/
specificity. Such GI predictors are likely to become of
increasing importance in bacterial genome analysis, as

appreciation grows of their significant role in adaptations
of medical and environmental importance.

Methods
Genome data source
All 675 complete bacterial genome sequences available at
the time of this study were obtained from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) FTP server
[32] and stored locally as of May 4, 2008. These genome
sequences comprised a total of 1225 replicons of which
736 were chromosomes. All 736 chromosomes were
treated as independent units from each other in all analyses.
Automated comparative genome picking
An overview of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1. We
used an external application called CVTree, which infers
evolutionary relatedness based on oligo-peptide content
of complete predicted proteomes, to establish relativephylogenetic distances between organisms. The source
code for CVTree [33] was obtained and used to calculate
the 270,480 distances between every pair of bacterial
chromosomes; requiring approximately 526 hours (or ~7
seconds per calculation) of computation time (based on a
single Intel Xeon 2.8 GHz machine) or ~4 hours on a 130
node cluster. The distances outputted by CVTree are on a
scale and range between 0 and 0.5. To ensure that CVTree
was behaving suitably, we compared these distance calculations to those produced by more conventional phylogenetic distance measures using PHYLIP [34], using carB
and omp85 genes as reference sequences, as we have used
previously for phylogenetic analysis of species [35]. Other
approaches were tested to calculate evolutionary distances, such as SHOT [36], however CVTree was found to
give the most consistent results (data not shown).

Several CVTree distance cutoffs were formulated by us to
ensure that appropriate "reference" genomes were
selected for comparison to the query genome (Fig. 1A, Fig.
2). These parameters were selected using known groups of
strains that are within the proper distance for comparative
genomics (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherishia coli
strains). In addition, the alignments were inspected to
ensure that the alignment results were not too sparse or
too similar to gain any useful information. A "Maximum
Distance Cutoff" of 0.42 was used to remove any genomes
that were too distant from the query genome. We
observed that at such cutoff, often less than 5% of the
genomes can be aligned. A "Minimum Distance Cutoff" of
0.1 was used to remove very closely-related strains that
would not provide any additional information and may
prevent us from identifying some notable islands that
were shared between such closely related strains (Fig. 2A).
In addition, by allowing for a larger span of insertion
time, this parameter ensures that our method is not lim-

Figure cutoffs on a sample genome tree

Effect of cutoffs on a sample genome tree. First, for
each query genome any genomes that are too distant to the
query genome or too closely related to each other are
removed (dotted lines) A). Second, we ensure that at least
one genome (bold line) is close enough so that the GIs we
identify were inserted from similar time frames and are not
biased by the genomes that are currently available B). Also,
we require that at least one genome is distant enough from
the query genome (bold line) to ensure that the backbone
sequences we identify were not inserted recently C). Finally,
we require that there be a minimum of 3 reference genomes
that have met all other criteria D). The reference genomes
that have passed all the cutoffs are used for comparison with
the query genome.

ited to identifying only very recently inserted GIs. At least
one reference genome must have a distance less than 0.30
from the query genome to ensure that identification of
GIs are all within a similar evolutionary time (Fig. 2B). In
addition, to ensure that the stable backbone regions identified are ancient enough to be reliable, at least one reference genome must have a distance greater than 0.34 from
the query genome (Fig. 2C). Lastly, we require that there
be at least 3 suitable reference genomes for each query
genome to be used for further analysis (Fig. 2D).
All of these cutoffs can be changed to permit prediction of
GIs acquired from different time frames. For example, by
increasing the "Minimum Distance Cutoff" and the "Single Close Genome Cutoff" we effectively change the
period of time that GI acquisitions are detected, by choosing more divergent genomes for the analysis. Although
the inclusion of more ancient GIs could lead to a more
comprehensive dataset, it would likely result in an

increase in false positives since the proper identification
of older evolutionary events can be easily mistaken. However, we did use two additional "relaxed" sets of parameters to determine the effect on GI prediction of changing
the default parameters. These relaxed parameters should
identify GIs with more ancient origins. The first relaxed set
had the same cutoffs as above, except that the "Minimum
Distance Cutoff" was changed to 0.15 and the "Single
Close Genome Cutoff" changed to 0.34. The second set of
parameters was even more relaxed by increasing the "Single Close Genome Cutoff" to 0.20, with all other parameters being the same as the first relaxed set.
Overall, the parameters, in particular the default parameters, were selected to ensure high confidence in the positive and negative datasets, so that they could be used to
fairly evaluate the accuracy of several sequence composition based GI prediction tools (see Methods: Comparison
of GI tools). The parameters were not changed to maximize the accuracy scores of any GI prediction tools that
were evaluated, however default parameters resulted the
highest apparent accuracy when GI datasets were compared with a curated, literature-based dataset.
Detecting GIs using comparative genomics
We used the command line program mauveAligner from
the Mauve 1.2.3 software package with its default settings
to do all of our whole genome alignments (Fig. 1C) [37].
Mauve allows for genomic insertions, deletions, inversions, and rearrangements and has been used by several
researchers for prokaryote genome alignment [38,39]. The
query genome was aligned pair wise against each of the
reference genomes in the dataset. We used pair wise alignments instead of a single multiple alignment because
Mauve 1.2.3 only aligns regions that are present in all
genomes. For each pair wise alignment, we extracted
regions longer than 8000 nucleotides from the query
genome that could not be aligned. Overlapping regions of
the query genome that were not aligned in any of the pair
wise genome alignments were retained for additional filtering as described below.

One caveat of Mauve is that it enforces a one-to-one alignment so if a duplication event occurs in one of the input
genomes only one of the copies will be aligned. We
excluded these possible genome duplications and ensured
that our putative genomics islands were truly unique to
only the query genome, with respect to the reference
genomes, by using BLAST similarity search as an additional filter. Each "unique" region was searched against
the query genome and all reference genomes using BLAST
[40], with default parameters except for an e-value of 1
(instead of 10). All similarity search matches (hits) less
than 700 nucleotides were discarded while remaining hits
were clustered together if they were less than 200 base

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/329

pairs a part. Any unique regions that contained clustered
hits that covered more than half of the minimum island
size (8 kb) were removed and the remaining regions were
considered to be putative GIs.
Detecting highly conserved regions (non-GIs)
In order to develop a negative dataset of regions that do
not contain GIs, we identified regions that were conserved
across multiple genomes (Fig. 1B). These regions are likely
to form the stable backbone of the genomes and are
unlikely to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer among
the strains considered. A multiple genome alignment of
each query genome and all reference genomes previously
selected (see Methods: Automated comparative genome
picking) was performed using Mauve with minimum
backbone length and maximum gap size parameters set to
8000 and 300, respectively. The regions that were conserved across all genomes were extracted from Mauve's
backbone output file. Genomic segments that were neither in the positive nor the negative datasets were
excluded from further analyses as the origin of these
regions are less certain. This helped ensure that whenever
we found that a GI predictor made a false GI prediction
(i.e. false positive), it was truly very likely false, or whenever it didn't make a prediction, that it was very likely a
true GI that it should have predicted (i.e. false negative).
Comparison of GI tools
Each tool for composition based prediction of GIs was
downloaded and if necessary compiled on a computer
running a Linux operating system. The tools PAI_IDA
[12], AlienHunter [15,29], SIGI-HMM (as part of the
Colombo package) [29], Centroid [16], and IslandPath
(included both DIMOB and DINUC methods) [8,11],
were all run with default values on the query genomes.
The precision, recall and overall accuracy of each tool
including our own positive and negative datasets was
measured using each tool as the "benchmark" dataset.
True positives (TP) were counted as any nucleotides that
were contained in both the benchmark dataset and the
predicted islands. False positives (FP) were those islands
that were not predicted by the benchmark (or those overlapping with the negative dataset). False negatives (FN)
were counted as all nucleotides within the benchmark
dataset that were not in the predicted islands. Precision or
specificity was calculated using the standard formula TP/
(TP + FP) and recall or sensitivity was calculated using TP/
(TP+FN). The equation, (TP + TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) was
used to measure the overall accuracy.
