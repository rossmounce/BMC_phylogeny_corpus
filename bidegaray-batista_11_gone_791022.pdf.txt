Gone with the plate: the opening of the Western
Mediterranean basin drove the diversification of
ground-dweller spiders
Leticia Bidegaray-Batista* and Miquel A Arnedo

Abstract
Background: The major islands of the Western Mediterranean–Corsica, Sardinia, and the Balearic Islands–are
continental terrenes that drifted towards their present day location following a retreat from their original position
on the eastern Iberian Peninsula about 30 million years ago. Several studies have taken advantage of this welldated geological scenario to calibrate molecular rates in species for which distributions seemed to match this
tectonic event. Nevertheless, the use of external calibration points has revealed that most of the present-day fauna
on these islands post-dated the opening of the western Mediterranean basin. In this study, we use sequence
information of the cox1, nad1, 16S, L1, and 12S mitochondrial genes and the 18S, 28S, and h3 nuclear genes, along
with relaxed clock models and a combination of biogeographic and fossil external calibration points, to test
alternative historical scenarios of the evolutionary history of the ground-dweller spider genus Parachtes
(Dysderidae), which is endemic to the region.
Results: We analyse 49 specimens representing populations of most Parachtes species and close relatives. Our
results reveal that both the sequence of species formation in Parachtes and the estimated divergence times match
the geochronological sequence of separation of the main islands, suggesting that the diversification of the group
was driven by Tertiary plate tectonics. In addition, the confirmation that Parachtes diversification matches welldated geological events provides a model framework to infer substitution rates of molecular markers. Divergence
rates estimates ranged from 3.5% My-1 (nad1) to 0.12% My-1 (28S), and the average divergence rate for the
mitochondrial genes was 2.25% My-1, very close to the “standard” arthropod mitochondrial rate (2.3% My-1).
Conclusions: Our study provides the first unequivocal evidence of terrestrial endemic fauna of the major western
Mediterranean islands, whose origin can be traced back to the Oligocene separation of these islands from the
continent. Moreover, our study provides useful information on the divergence rate estimates of the most
commonly used genes for phylogenetic inference in non-model arthropods.

Background
The estimation of the timing of evolutionary events
from DNA sequence information has become a major
research topic in evolutionary biology. Although the use
of molecular data to estimate divergence times goes
back to the mid 60’s of the past century [1], the number
of studies that include time estimation has increased
rapidly over the last decade due to the ever increasing
amount of DNA sequence data and the development of
new algorithms that relax the limiting assumptions of

the molecular clock (see reviews of [2-4]). Information
on timescales has shed light not only on the origin of
taxonomic groups but has also allowed for the testing of
biogeographic and climatic hypotheses, the estimation of
rates of species diversification, and the investigation of
rates of molecular evolution, among other topics [5].
Genetic distances are transformed into absolute divergence times by incorporating calibration points. The
choice of a specific calibration date is therefore potentially crucial to accurately infer molecular dates (e.g.,
[6]). Biogeographic and paleoecological data are among
the main sources of information for dating phylogenetic
nodes, either as a complement to the fossil record, or as

the only available evidence in poorly preserved organisms. The use of geologic and paleoclimatic evidence,
however, has been criticised on the basis of their limited
accuracy and unwarranted assumptions (e.g., [7-9]).
Therefore, the appropriate use of biogeographic events
to calibrate phylogenies requires a well-documented
geochronology and the demonstration that the assumed
barriers constitute a true obstacle to dispersal for the
focal group.
The complex geological evolution of the western Mediterranean region, located at the edge of the converging
African and Eurasian plates, is relatively well understood
[10-17] and has been extensively used for molecular dating (e.g., [18-24]) as well as to explain present-day species distributions (e.g., [25]). The opening of the western
Mediterranean basin started during the Alpine orogeny,
when an eastward tectonic extension occurred between
the African and Eurasian plates due to a subduction
rollback between the oceanic and the continental slab
(back arc extension). As a result, at the beginning of the
Oligocene (~30-25 million years ago, Ma), several continental microplates that formed part of the Hercynian
belt (Corsica, Sardinia, Balearic Islands, Calabro-Peloritan massif, including northern Sicily, the Kabylies and
the Beatic-Rift Cordillera) broke off and started drifting
from the eastern Iberian Peninsula and southern France
to their present-day location (Figure 1(A)). During the
first stage of the back arc extension, the northern microplate assemblage (Sardinia, Corsica and Calabro-Peloritan massif) started drifting counter-clockwise with
respect to the Eurasian plate, whereas the southern
assemblage (the Balearic Islands and Great Kabylie)
drifted clockwise relative to Iberia. The movement of
the northern microplates resulted in the opening of the
Ligurian Sea, the Valencia Trough and the Gulf of Lyon.
Corsica, Sardinia and the Calabro-Peloritan massif collided with the Apulian plate around 20-18 Ma, completing the formation of the Gulf of Lyon. There is no
general consensus on the time of separation of Corsica
and Sardinia, although it almost certainly occurred during the Corsica-Sardinia rotation. This rotation has been
dated to approximately 21-15 Ma [13,26] based on
paleomagnetic data and is further corroborated by the
presence of early Burdigalian marine sediments in
southern Corsica [27]. Likewise, there are doubts about
the time when the exotic blocks of the Calabro-Peloritan
massif drifted off from Sardinia to their present-day
positions, although it is generally accepted that it
occurred during the formation of the Tyrrhenian Sea
[10,17]. According to Rosenbaum & Lister [28], the Tyrrhenian Sea started opening 10-9 Ma in the northern
and western part, finishing around 5-4 Ma in the southern part. The same geological processes that generated
the Tyrrhenian Sea also broke off the land connection

Page 2 of 15

between the Maghrebides and Sicily, opening the Strait
of Sicily [12]. The Provençal and the Algerian basins are
both older than the Tyrrhenian Sea, and originated during the Early-Middle Miocene (21-15 Ma), when the
Kabylies block broke off from the Balearic Islands (~21
Ma) and started drifting southward until they collided
with the African margin (18-15 Ma). The formation of
the Alboran basin is a matter of debate because the original position of the Rif-Betic mountain range is uncertain [12,15]. Some authors suggest that during the
Oligocene, the Rif-Betic mountain range formed a continuous orogenic belt together with the western Alps,
Calabria, Corsica and the Kabylies blocks [12]. At the
time of the main subduction rollback, the Rif-Betic
block drifted southwest up to its present location (~10
Ma), completing the formation of the Alboran basin.
Although the formation of the main western Mediterranean islands has been used to date evolutionary divergence times and to explain species ranges, most studies
using independent calibration points or substitution
rates estimated from related organisms have concluded
that the origin of present-day fauna in the region greatly
post-dates the opening of the basin [29-33]. In particular, the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) has been
pointed out as one of the main drivers of local diversification. The late Miocene (8 Ma) marine corridors in
southern Iberia and northern Morocco closed about
5.96 Ma, isolating the Mediterranean Sea from the
Atlantic Ocean and causing a large reduction in Mediterranean water levels and the emergence of land connections between North Africa, Corsica, Sardinia and
Eurasia and between the Balearic Islands and Iberia
[34,35,16]. The opening of the Strait of Gibraltar about
5.3 Ma restored the water exchange between the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, reestablishing effective
isolation of the island ecosystems [36,37]. To date, the
plant family Araceae constitutes the only case reported
of Mediterranean organisms in which diversification has
been shown to correspond to the Oligocene break-off of
the Hercynian belt [38].
The ground-dweller spider genus Parachtes Alicata,
1964 (Araneae, Dysderidae) is a promising candidate for
a terrestrial animal whose diversification may have been
shaped by western Mediterranean plate tectonics. This
genus is restricted to the western Mediterranean, where
it exhibits a disjunct distribution [39]. It currently
includes 12 species: P. ignavus Simon, 1882 and P. inaequipes Simon 1882 from Corsica, P. limbarae Kraus,
1955 from Sardinia, P. siculus Caporiacco, 1949 from
Sicily, P. romandiolae Caporiacco, 1949, P. vernae
Caporiacco, 1936, P. latialis Alicata, 1966 and P. andreinii Alicata, 1966 from the Italian Peninsula, and P. cantabrarum Simon, 1914, P. teruelis Kraus, 1955, P. loboi

from the Iberian Peninsula. Two new species, one endemic to Majorca (Balearic Islands) and another to the Italian Peninsula (Lazio), have been recently discovered
and are awaiting formal description (Arnedo, unpublished data). Parachtes shows a remarkable uniformity in
its somatic morphology and most species’ diagnostic features are restricted to the male and female genitalia [39].
Parachtes species are nocturnal wandering hunters,
usually found in leaf-litter, under dead logs or stones
and in dark and humid habitats at mid to high altitudes
(> 500 m). These spiders do not build webs, and ballooning (i.e., aerial dispersal by means of silk threads)
has been reported neither in the genus nor in the whole
family. The low vagility and habitat preferences suggest
limited opportunities for overseas dispersal, although
transport by floating islands has been proposed to
explain colonisation of the oceanic Canary Islands by
the closely related genus Dysdera [40].

Here, we investigate the role of the major geological
events associated with the opening of the Western Mediterranean basin in shaping diversification of the spider
genus Parachtes, by inferring a molecular phylogeny
based on eight mitochondrial and nuclear genes from a
thorough taxonomic sampling of the genus and its close
relatives. Relaxed clock models in combination with
multiple, independent biogeographic and fossil calibration points are further used to reconstruct the temporal
framework of species diversification.

Results
Samples and sequences analysed

The specimens and sequences analysed in the present
study are summarised in Additional file 1. The alignment of the non-protein coding genes, including informative gap characters coded as absence/presence
characters (see Additional file 2 for details), were

Bidegaray-Batista and Arnedo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:317
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/317

merged with the protein-coding genes (cox1 = 1257,
nad1 = 358 and h3 = 327 characters), resulting in a
combined matrix of 4454 characters for the “default
alignment”, 4462 for the “gappy alignment” and 4447 for
the “compressed alignment”. Gap characters were
included in the parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses but excluded in maximum likelihood and divergence time analyses.
Phylogenetic analyses

Preliminary analysis using parsimony conducted on the
concatenated matrices of the default, gappy and compressed alignments resulted in almost identical topologies and similar jackknife supports, although jackknife
values were slightly higher for the default alignments
(Figure 2). The 12S and 16S-L1 genes were the most
variable and hence the most sensitive to changes in the
alignment parameter values, recovering slightly different
topologies. Differences, however, involved unsupported
alternative positions.
Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses
were only conducted on the default alignment concatenated matrix, because no remarkable differences were
found among the resulting topologies of each alignment.
The selected substitution models for each gene and
gene partition are shown in Additional file 3. Phylogenetic analyses under the three inference methods and
partition strategies resulted in almost identical topologies, summarised in Figure 2.
All methods support the monophyly of Parachtes and
its sister group relationship to the western Mediterranean species of Harpactocrates. As suspected [41], the
eastern European species currently included in Harpactocrates did not form a clade with its western counterparts. The most basal split in the genus Parachtes
separates species of the Iberian Peninsula (Iberian clade)
from those of the western Mediterranean islands, Italy
and the Betic species (Hercynian-Italian clade).
Although all analyses support this basal split, the support for the Hercynian-Italian clade was moderate to
low (parsimony jackknife 67%, Bayesian posterior probability 0.95, maximum likelihood bootstrap 51%), and
the AU topology test could not reject the alternative
topology where all Iberian and the Balearic species
formed a clade sister to the remaining species (p =
0.464, 0. 469, 0.473, for P1, P2 and P3, respectively).
Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses
conducted on P2 and P3 partition schemes, however,
increased support for the Hercynian-Italian clade (72/
0.96 and 84/0.98, respectively, see Figure 2). The Hercynian-Italian clade was further resolved into two clades,
one clade including the Balearic and Betic species, and a
second clade where the Italian species form a monophyletic group sister to Corsica, with both of them in turn

sister to Sardinia. All of the former clades were highly
supported.
Temporal framework of Parachtes diversification

Bayes factor analysis provided decisive support for
selecting relaxed clock models against the strict clock,
but could not discriminate between the two Bayesian
relaxed clocks. The lognormal model, however, yielded
the highest harmonic mean likelihood and was used in
subsequent analyses. Likewise, BEAST analyses using
Yule as tree prior yielded the highest likelihood harmonic means, but provided no strong evidence as compared to the more complex birth-death models. Finally,
Bayes factors indicated decisive evidence in favour of
the P3 partition scheme over the alternative schemes
(Bayes factors summarised in Additional file 4).
The chronogram with corresponding confidence intervals obtained with the preferred analysis options is
shown in Figure 3. The time of the split between the
Iberian clade and the Hercynian-Italian clade was estimated at 23.16 Ma (31.81-15.32 Ma), while the time of
divergence between the Balearic-Betic clade and the Sardinian-Corsican-Italian clade was estimated at 19.17 Ma
(26.63-12.24). The Baleares and the Betic clades split at
9.73 Ma (16.14-4.09). Sardinia split from the CorsicanItalian clade at 14.34 Ma (20.81-9.00), and the Corsican
lineage split from the Italian clade at 11.27 Ma (16.286.65), similar to the estimated time of divergence of the
two Iberian species P. loboi and P. teruelis, 11.09 Ma
(17.39-5.50). The southern Italian species P. andreinii
diverged from the remaining Italian species at 8.80 Ma
(12.93-4.96). Italian P. siculus and P. vernae split from
P. romandiolae and P. n. sp. at 5.90 Ma (9.14-3.23). The
most recent species splits correspond to the two former
pairs, at 3.20 Ma (5.40-1.26) and 1.69 Ma (3.14-0.56),
respectively.
The substitution rates inferred for each gene partition
were (mean pairwise divergence My -1 ): 3.5% (nad1),
2.5% (cox1), 1.7% (12S), 1.3% (16S-L1), 0.22% (h3) and
0.12% (28S) (Table 1). The 18S substitution rate could
not be estimated due to low genetic variability and limited phylogenetic resolution. All genes evolved in a nonclocklike manner, as indicated by ucld.stdev values and
the high coefficient of variation, which reflects heterogeneity in substitution rates along tree branches. The
nuclear gene 28S showed higher deviation from the
strict clock, as ucld.stev and the coefficient of variation
were greater than 1. Moreover, the 95% HPD interval of
the covariance values span zero in all genes, which
means that there is not evidence of autocorrelation of
rates in the phylogeny (see BEAST user manual).
The lineage age estimates obtained in r8s under the
preferred method selected by cross-validation analyses
for the different partition schemes are summarised in

estimation methods and partition strategies at different
phylogenetic levels were assessed by monitoring the
following clades: the Dysderidae node, the Parachtes
node, and the Corsican-Italian node. The analyses performed with r8s and BEAST yielded similar estimates
for the Parachtes and the Corsica-Italian nodes, but

differed greatly for the deeper Dysderidae node (see
Figure 4).

also investigated estimates based on alternative, widelyused smoothing methods. The results showed that time
estimates of Parachtes diversification are consistent
across methods and data partition schemes. The two
time estimation methods, however, greatly differed at
older time splits, suggesting that there could be

Page 7 of 15

incorrect assumptions under certain analytical conditions. Smoothing methods differ from Bayesian methods,
as implemented in BEAST, by the use of fixed topologies and roots and by assuming rate autocorrelation
between ancestral and descendant branches [2-4,42]. To
date, there has been a limited advance in evaluating the
strengths and weaknesses of both methods, because
direct comparisons between them are hampered by their
numerous differences [3]. Finding out the causes of the
reported discrepancies are beyond the scope of this
study, but our results recommend exerting caution
when trying to estimate ages close to the root.
The tree topology and estimated divergences identify
the opening of the Western Mediterranean basin as the
main driver for the diversification of Parachtes species
(Figure 2, 3 and 5). The estimated age for the split of
the Parachtes stem group closely matches the geochronology of the Hercynian belt break-off, and these node
age estimates are robust to alternative analytical procedures and to partition schemes (Figure 4). Therefore,
our results reject previous suggestions for a Quaternary
origin of the genus [39], mostly based on the absence of
these species from the Rift and Kabylies regions in
northern Africa. Indeed, the absence of Parachtes in
northern African exotic terrains poses a challenge to the
Miocene origin hypothesis. It may be argued that biotic
surveys of the region are far from complete, and that,
hence, the presence of the species cannot be completely
ruling out. Alternative explanations, such as species
extinction due to unfavourable climatic conditions seem
unlikely given that other humid fauna with northern
Mediterranean affinities, such as the Salamandra newts
[43] or Alytes toads [44], are still found in northern
Africa. Evidence of absence is always hard to prove, and
further exhaustive, systematic biotic surveys of northwestern Africa will be necessary to discard the presence
of Parachtes in the region.
Most current evidence indicates that Corsica, Sardinia,
northern Sicily, the Balearic Islands, and the Kabylies
microplates were part of a single block by the time of
the onset of the back arc extension (~30-25 Ma), when
the microplates broke and drifted off the Iberian Peninsula [10,12,14,15,28,17]. Nevertheless, the actual location
of the Rift-Betic block is still controversial. It has been
suggested that the internal part of the Rift-Betic belt
was laid near the Balearic Hercynian microplates (see
Figure seven of [15]). Some authors go further and propose that the Balearic microplate, together with the
Betic belt, formed a Betic-Balearic domain, which suffered a WNW progressive thrust sheet stacking during
the back arc extension, ending approximately at the
time of the Middle-Miocene (16.4-11.2 Ma) [45,46]. The
existence of a Betic-Balearic corridor during the Langhian-Serravallian marine regression (Middle Miocene,

Figure 5 Reconstruction of the paleobiogeographic scenario for Parachtes diversification. Scenario 1, 2, 3 and 4 represent main geological
events that occurred during the opening of the western Mediterranean Basin. Contemporary areas of species distribution are indicated as
follows: Ib, Iberian microplate; Co, Corsica; Sa, Sardinia; Ca, Calabria; Ba, Balearic Islands; Be/Rif, Betic/Rift microplate and Ap, Apulian microplate.
Current species distribution is indicated at the tips of the inferred topology, and the colours correspond to areas previously defined. The putative
geological event involved in the diversification process is indicated at each node.

c. 14.2 Ma) has been proposed to explain the origin of
some Balearic mammalian fossil remains [47]. Alternatively, the Betic-Balearic clade could be the result of a
later colonisation facilitated by the land bridge connections between the Balearic Islands and the continent
established during the Messinian Salinity Crisis [21,48].
However, our much older time estimates disagree with
this scenario.
The sister group relationship of the Sardinian lineage
with the remaining Thyrrenian and the Italian species
together with the divergence time of these two lineages
(14.34 Ma, 20.81-9 Ma) are consistent with the time
frame of the separation of Corsica from Sardinia, dated
at 21-15 Ma [12]. A similar phylogenetic pattern, i.e.,
Sardinia as a sister group of Corsica and Italy, has also
been reported in the subterranean aquatic stenasellid
isopods [20] and the terrestrial isopod Helleria brevicornis [32], although in the latter case time estimates suggest an Early Pleistocene split of Corsica and Sardinia.
The close relationships between Corsican and northern Italian species revealed in Parachtes have also been
recovered in a diverse assemblage of arthropods, including cave crickets, wasps or isopods [20,49-51,32]. In
most cases, these links originated as a result of active
dispersal during the Pleistocene glacial cycles (2-0.5
Ma), when recurrent marine regressions led to the formation of land bridges between Corsica and Tuscany or
when the Tuscany archipelago could have been used as
stepping-stones. Our results, however, point towards a
deeper split between the Corsican and Italian lineages
(11.27, 16.26-6.68 Ma), which matches the onset of the
opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. About 10-9 Ma, Corsica,
Sardinia and the Calabro-Peloritan massif separated

from the Apennines, after having progressively collided
with the Apulian plate at around 20-18 Ma [12,28].
The basal split of Italian P. andreinii was estimated at
about 9 Ma. Similar divergence times were found
between northern and southern Italian species of the
Salamandrina spectacled salamanders [52]. However,
the finding of Miocene-age Salamandrina fossils in Sardinia led some authors to propose a double origin for
the Italian Salamandrina: the ancestor of the northern
species would have colonised the Peninsula from Corsica/Sardinia, while the southern one would have drifted
eastward from Sardinia on the Calabro-Peloritan massif.
The double-origin hypothesis put forward for Salamandrina does not match the topology inferred for Parachtes. Italian Parachtes are monophyletic, and thus a
double colonisation scenario would require extinction
events on both the islands and the continent. Indeed,
the lack of direct links between the Sardinian and any
Italian lineage seems to be at odds with geological
expectations, given that Sardinia was connected to the
Apennines until the opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea [28]
and given the biogeographic links such as those reported
in cave salamanders of the genus Hydromantes [53] and
Discoglossus toads [21].
With the exception of P. andreinii, the estimated
timeframe suggests that the diversification of Parachtes
in the Italian peninsula was mostly driven by Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles, as already predicted by Alicata
[39]. The key role of geographic isolation due to Quaternary climatic oscillations seems to explain the origin
of other components of the Italian fauna, such as frogs
and snakes [54-58]. Further comprehensive phylogeographical studies on Italian and Iberian Parachtes species

are, however, needed to gain detailed insight into their
evolutionary history and to fully expose the factors
responsible for their diversification.
Recent studies have suggested that divergence time
estimates under recently developed multilocus coalescent methods may provide younger time estimates than
the standard concatenated approach conducted in the
present study (see [59]). Although, this issue is still little
explored in the literature, the amount of disagreement
seems to be particularly significant at shallow divergence
times. In fact, it has been argued that the younger estimates obtained with coalescent approaches may be the
results of unaccounted recent gene flow [59], since most
multilocus coalescent methods of species trees inference
assume incomplete lineage sorting as the single source
of gene tree incongruence (e.g., [60-62]).
Estimates of substitution rates

In the absence of fossil or biogeographic calibration
points, the extrapolation of substitution rates from independent analyses provides the only information for
inferring absolute timeframes. The confirmation that
tectonic evolution of the Western Mediterranean shaped
Parachtes diversification opens the possibility of using
this model system to characterise substitution rates in
molecular markers of interest.
The use of extrapolated substitution rates for one lineage and markers to date another may be compromised
by the variation in rate of molecular evolution among
lineages [63]. In the present study, the estimated average
substitution rate for the mitochondrial genes estimated
(2.25% My-1) closely matches the “standard” arthropod
mitochondrial DNA clock estimated at 2.3% My-1 [64],
one of the most widely used universal rates. These
results are surprising, given that the analytical procedures and assumptions used to estimate rates widely differ in the two studies. Nevertheless, Papadopoulou et al.
[65] have reached similar conclusions by using another
well-dated geological event, the formation of the MidAegean Trench on the eastern Mediterranean, dated at
9-12 Ma, (from 2.39 to 2.69% My -1 , 3.54% and 1.06%,
for mtDNA, cox1 and 16S, respectively). These results
may be viewed as a further support for the geological
scenario proposed for Parachtes diversification.
The few spider rates available in the literature are significantly higher than the ones obtained here. Bond and
collaborators [66] estimated a substitution rate for 16S
of 4% My -1 in the trapdoor spider Aptostichus simus,
while phylogeographic studies in woodlouse hunter spiders endemic to the Canary Island have reported cox1
rates as high as 9.8% My -1 [67] or 10.2% My -1 [68].
Interestingly, the former rates were derived from population-level comparisons, which have been shown to
produce higher estimates of mutation rates as compared

Page 9 of 15

to substitution rates inferred in phylogenetic (specieslevel) studies (Ho et al. [69]; however, see Emerson [7]).
The slower estimates found in cox1 (1.75% My-1) in a
species-level phylogeny of eastern Canarian Dysdera [70]
supports this last contention.
Our study provides valuable information on the substitution rates of the handful of markers commonly used
to infer phylogenies in non-model arthropods. Nextgeneration sequencing approaches promise to expand
the range of molecular markers amenable to phylogenetic inference for organisms such as spiders. Until
then, however, rigorous and thorough sampling of phylogeny of non-model organisms may rely on the set of
genes used in the present study. In this context, our
estimates could be an alternative to obtain absolute time
estimates in the absence of calibration points when
using such standard sets of molecular markers. Additionally, Parachtes may serve as a model system to gain
further insights into the rate of molecular, morphological, and ecological trait evolution through time.

Conclusions
The pattern and timing of species formation in the spider genus Parachtes match the geochronological
sequence of the opening of the western Mediterranean
Basin. Therefore, Parachtes spiders provide one of the
first and unequivocal pieces of evidence for endemic terrestrial taxa whose origins can be traced back to the
separation of the major western Mediterranean islands
from the continent (Figure 5). Our results confirm that
early Oligocene tectonics played a key role in generating
the diversity of the Earth’s most populated biodiversity
hot-spot [34,71].
Methods
Taxonomic sampling

A total of 49 specimens were analysed in the present
study (Additional file 1). We included 9 of the 12 currently known Parachtes species, along with two new
species awaiting formal description: one from Majorca
and one from the Italian Peninsula (Figure 1 (B)). The
missing species included the Iberian P. cantabrorum,
the Corsican P. inaequipes and the Italian P. latialis. P.
cantabrorum from an undetermined locality in the Pyrenees [72] has not been collected since its original
description (some females assigned to P. cantabrorum
by Denis are most likely a misidentification, [73]). P.
inaequipes is known from a single locality in southern
Corsica (Bonifacio). One of the specimens included in
the present analysis is an unidentified juvenile collected
near the P. inaequipes type locality (Porto Vecchio, 23
km). Finally, P. latialis is known from the Italian district
of Lazio. After visiting this area, all collected specimens
turned out to constitute a new species.

Bidegaray-Batista and Arnedo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:317
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/317

Half of the Parachtes species were represented by single individuals, two by specimens sampled from 2 populations, 2 from 3 populations and one, P. teruelis, from
6 populations (Figure 1(B)). We sampled 14 additional
species from 5 genera of the same subfamily (Dysderinae) and two genera of the subfamily Harpacteinae,
which is also in the family Dysderidae. The genus Segestria, a member of the family Segestriidae closely related
to Dysderidae and part of the same superfamily Dysderoidea, was included as an outgroup to root trees. The
length of the most basal branch in a rooted tree with
molecular clock not enforced is trivial and therefore has
to be removed before estimating the divergence times
using smoothing methods (see below). The most recent
common ancestor of Dysderoids, however, provided a
calibration point and, therefore, a specimen belonging to
Caponiidae, the putative sister-family to Dysderoidea
[74], was included to root analyses and preserve the
Dysderoid node.
Most specimens were collected in the field by the
authors; some were kindly provided by colleagues. Specimens were preserved in 95% ethanol and stored at
-20°C in the Department of Animal Biology of the University of Barcelona. Some specimens had been preserved in suboptimal 70% ethanol, but extraction yielded
reasonable amounts of DNA for specimens collected
within the past 10 years.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing

Genomic DNA was extracted from specimens using the
DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Partial fragments of the mitochondrial
genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1), the 12S
rRNA (12S), a fragment spanning the 3’ half of the 16S
rRNA ribosomal subunit (16S ), the complete tRNA leu
(L1) and the 5’ half of the NADH deshydrogenase subunit I (nad1), and the nuclear genes 28S rRNA (28S), 18S
rRNA (18S) and Histone H3 (h3), were amplified using
the following primer pairs: [cox1] C1-J-1490 [75] and
C1-N-2776 [76], alternatively as two overlapping fragments using primer pairs C1-J-1490 or C1-J-1718 [77]
with C1-N-2198 [75] or C1-N-2191 [77] and CI-J-2183
[77] with C1-N-2776; [16S, L1, nad1] LR-N-13398 [77]
and N1-J-12350 (Crates: 5’-CCTARTTGRCTARARTTRGCRSATCARCCAATTG-3’) or N1-J-12373
[70], or as two overlapping fragments using primers
pairs LR-N-13398 with LR-J-12864 [40] and LR-N12945 [78] with either N1-J-12350 or N1-J-12373; [12S]
12SR-J-14199 and 12SR-N-14594 [79] or 12SR-J-14215
(Viera: 5’-AGGGTGACGGGCGATATG TGCAC-3’)
and
12SR-N-14522
(Forlan:

[18S] 5F and 9R [80]; [h3] H3a F and H3a R [81]. PCR
conditions were as follows: 2 min. at 94°C followed by
35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at
42-52°C for 35-45 s (depending on the primers, see
below), and extension at 72°C for 30-60 s (depending on
the length of the fragment), with a final single extension
step at 72°C for 5 min. For the cox1, 16S-nad1 and 12S
gene fragments, a successful amplification was achieved
with an annealing temperature of 42°C or 45°C for 45 s.
For the 18S and 28S, a single annealing temperature of
52°C for 35 s was optimum. Finally, h3 was amplified
using a “touchdown” strategy consistent in beginning
the annealing at 60°C for 35 s and lowering proportionally the temperature 1°C in each cycle (during 19
cycles), until reaching a constant temperature of 42°C,
keeping this annealing temperature during the following
16 cycles. Amplifications were carried out in a 25 μl
reaction volume for a final concentration of 1.25 U Taq
polymerase (Promega), 2.5 mM MgCl 2 (Promega), 0.2
mM of each dNTP, 0.2 μM of each primer and about 2
μl of DNA sample and the amount of Taq buffer recommended by the manufacturer. PCR products were purified using MultiScreen PCR μ96 cleanup filter plates
from Millipore. PCR products were cycle-sequenced in
both directions using one of the PCR primers and the
BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystem) and sequenced in an ABI 3700 automated
sequencer at the Scientific and Technical Services of the
University of Barcelona [82]. DNA sequences were edited using Geneious v.5.0.3 [83].
Phylogenetic Analyses

The alignment of the cox1, nad1 and h3 gene sequences
was trivial because there was no evidence for insertion/
deletion events and sequences were adjusted manually.
Conversely, 12S, 16S-L1, 18S and 28S sequences showed
length polymorphism, and gaps had to be included to
retain positional homology. Sequence alignments of
each variable length gene were constructed using the
online version of the automatic alignment program
MAFFT v. 6 [84,85]. The alignment was constructed
using the manual strategy option set to Q-INS-i, with
default options (Gap opening penalty (GOP) = 1.53 and
Offset value, which works like a gap extension penalty
(GEP) = 0.0). Two additional alignments were constructed to explore the sensitivity of the phylogenetic
results to alternative alignment parameter values. The
parameter options were set as follows: GOP = 3 and
GEP = 0, to obtain a “compressed alignment”, and GOP
= 1 and GEP = 0.5, to obtain a “gappy alignment”. Gaps
were recoded as separate presence/absence characters
following Simmons & Ochoterena [86]. Treating gaps in
this manner allows the incorporation of gap information
in the analyses while minimising the effect of increasing

Bidegaray-Batista and Arnedo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:317
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/317

the weight of overlapping multiple non-homologous
gaps that result from scoring gaps as an additional state
[87]. In addition, absence/presence gap scoring is amenable to Bayesian inference analyses. The program GapCoder [88] was used to facilitate the automatic recoding
of the alignments based on the simple method proposed
by Simmons et al. [89]. Gene matrices were concatenated using WINCLADA v.1.00.08 [90]. Non-sequenced
fragments were scored as missing data.
Concatenation of genes evolving at different rates to
resolve phylogenetic relationships among taxa across a
wide range of divergence times has been the paradigm
in phylogenetic inference for the last two decades. The
use of concatenation is based upon the assumption that
individual gene trees are congruent among themselves
and to the species tree. However, it is well known that
different genes may support incongruent topologies due
to processes such as horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, gene duplication or incomplete lineage sorting
[91-94]. This last problem is especially pervasive when
dealing with closely related species, and has recently
received a great deal of theoretical and methodological
attention. A whole new generation of multispecies coalescent inference methods have been developed to deal
with the effects of the stochasticity of the genealogical
process. In the present study, however, we have decided
to use a concatenation approach based on two main
considerations: (1) we did not observe any instance of
topological incongruence among individual gene trees,
which lead us to assume that none processes know to
cause gene incongruence had a major impact on our
data, and (2) that our time window of interest (Oligocene/Miocene divergences) minimized the effect of coalescent stochastic errors (i.e. incomplete lineage sorting)
in the sampled markers. Moreover, from a practical
standpoint, the use of multiple coalescent approaches to
infer species trees in the present study would have
resulted in losing power to infer topology and branch
lengths, given the taxonomic sampling (some species
were represented by single individuals), and the low
variability of the nuclear markers employed (slow evolving 18S, 28S and h3 exon).
Parsimony analyses of the individual genes and concatenated matrices were conducted with the program
TNT v. 1.0 [95]. Each heuristic search consisted of 1000
iterations of Wagner trees constructed with the random
addition of taxa and subsequent TBR branch swapping,
holding five trees per iteration and culminating in a
final round of branch swapping holding up to 10000
trees. When the number of replicates finding optimal
trees was less than 10%, the number of replicates was
increased by 1000. Clade support was assessed via jackknife resampling [96] using 1000 replicates with individual heuristic searches consisting of 20 iterations of

Page 11 of 15

Wagner tree construction using the random addition of
taxa, holding 5 trees per iteration up to 10000 trees.
Bayesian inference analyses were conducted with
MRBAYES v.3.1.2 [97] and were run remotely at the
Bioportal computer resources of the University of Oslo
[98]. The combined matrix was analysed under three
scheme partitions: by gene (P1), by gene and mitochondrial protein coding genes 1 st + 2 nd positions vs. 3 rd
positions (P2), and by gene and protein coding genes
(both mitochondrial and nuclear) 1st + 2nd positions vs.
3 rd positions (P3). Nucleotide substitution models
selected by the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [99],
as implemented in jMODELTEST v.0.1.1 [100,101],
were specified for each partition, and a standard discrete
model was defined for the gaps scored as absence/presence data [102]. The substitution parameters were
allowed to vary independently between each partition.
Two independent runs of 10 million generations, sampling each 1000 generations, with six simultaneous
MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) chains, each starting from random trees, were carried out simultaneously.
The program TRACER v. 1.5 [103] was used to ensure
that the Markov chains had reached stationarity by
examining the effective sample size (ESS) values and
also to determine the correct number of generations to
discard as a burn-in for the analysis (first 10%). Chain
convergence was monitored by ensuring the standard
deviation of the split frequencies of these two runs
dropped below 0.01.
Maximum likelihood analyses of the concatenated data
matrix were conducted with the software program
RAxML v. 7.0.4 [104] and run remotely at the CIPRES
portal [105]. The same three partition schemes
described above were analysed with independent GTR
+G substitution models for each partition. The best likelihood tree was selected out of 100 iterations of the random addition of taxa. Non-parametric bootstrap support
values were drawn from 100 resampled matrices. Finally,
confidence values were mapped onto the best topology.
Trees were visualised and manipulated with the program FigTree v. 1.1.2 [106].
The Approximately Unbiased (AU) topology test [107]
implemented in the computer program CONSEL v.0.1i
[108] was used to investigate whether alternative topologies could be statistically distinguished (see Results).
Estimation of divergence times and substitution rates

The use of multiple calibration points results in better
and more reliable estimations, while minimising associated uncertainty [109,110]. Absolute ages were thus
estimated by incorporating both fossil and biogeographic
calibration points, which provided minimum and fixed
or maximum ages, respectively. The oldest fossil of the
family Segestriidae has been found in Lebanese amber

Bidegaray-Batista and Arnedo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:317
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/317

from the Lower Cretaceous [111]. Therefore, the minimum time of separation for the families Segestriidae
and Dysderidae was set at 125 Mya. The Harpacteinae
fossil genus Dasumiana Wunderlich, 2004 from Eocene
Baltic amber [111] shows close morphological affinities
in the male bulb with the present day genus Holissus
(Arnedo, pers. obs.). This information was incorporated
into the analysis by placing the minimum age estimate
of the common ancestor of Harpactea and Holissus at
35 Mya. The closely-related genus Dysdera provided
several biogeographic constraints. The split of the Iberian and Moroccan populations of Dysdera inermis was
assumed to have been caused by the opening of the
Strait of Gibraltar and therefore their time of divergence
was set at 5.3 Mya. The time of a volcanic island formation provides a maximum age for the lineages inhabiting
the island [112]. Dysdera has undergone local diversification in the volcanic archipelago of the Canary Islands,
and inter-island populations of two endemic Canarian
Dysdera species were used as additional biogeographic
calibration points. The age of emergence of La Palma (2
Mya) and El Hierro (1.2 Mya) [113] placed maximum
age estimates for the divergence time between the populations of La Palma and La Gomera of the species D.
calderensis and for the divergence of the populations of
El Hierro and La Gomera of the species D. gomerensis.
Minimum and maximum constraints were included as
uniform prior distributions to estimate absolute time in
a Bayesian framework (see below). Uniform prior distributions for fossil calibration were preferred over more
explicit distributions (e.g., lognormal) as a conservative
approach, given the limited information available to
decide upon the shape of the distribution [114]. For
island calibration points, upper bounds were set to the
island age and lower bounds to zero. For fossils, the
lower bound was set to the latest fossil age and the
upper bound was set to 392 Mya, which is the age of
the oldest Uraraneida, the putative sister taxon to spiders [115]. The opening of the Gibraltar strait was set as
a fixed calibration point following a normal distribution,
with mean = 5.3 and sd = 0.15. The effect of using a
fixed constraint on time estimates was explored by running additional analyses without this constraint.
Lineage ages were estimated using a Bayesian framework as implemented in BEAST v1.5.4 [116,103] and
using multiple rate methods as implemented in r8s v.
1.71 [117]. Species were represented by single specimens
(Additional file 1) to avoid very short or zero-length
branches, which may negatively influence the performance of the algorithms in r8s [117], and to ensure that
only speciation processes as tree prior were included in
BEAST estimations.
A preliminary cross-validation analysis was conducted
to select the best clock method and, if required, the best

Page 12 of 15

smoothing parameter value [118] in r8s analyses. Analyses were conducted using the node constraints
described above. Branch lengths were re-estimated with
RAxML after taxon removal, enforcing the preferred
topology under the alternative partitions schemes
described above (P1, P2 and P3) and two additional
schemes: gene partition with 3 rd codon positions
removed (P4) and gene partitions with mitochondrial
3rd codon positions removed (P5). Some concerns have
been cast on the simultaneous use of invariants and
gamma distributions in evolutionary models [119].
Therefore, branch lengths were reestimated under models with and without invariants for each partition model.
Confidence intervals for the time estimates were constructed by generating 100 trees with identical topology
by bootstrapping branch lengths, using RAxML.
We used an iterative strategy to select the best clock,
partition and speciation model for conducting analyses
in BEAST. Alternative schemes were compared using
Bayes Factors, as calculated by the program TRACER
v1.5. First, lineage ages were estimated under the strict
and the two relaxed uncorrelated clocks (exponential
and lognormal) using the partition scheme P1 (see
above) and selecting the Yule speciation process as tree
prior. Once the best clock model was identified, lineage
ages were reestimated using the best clock and partition
scheme P1, but selecting the Birth-death speciation process as a tree prior. Finally, lineage ages were estimated
again by selecting the best clock and speciation process
prior, under the three alternative partition schemes (P1,
P2, and P3, see above). The best substitution model for
each partition was assessed by AIC as implemented in
jMODELTEST. An additional run was conducted without considering invariants in the nucleotide substitution
models (P1NOINV) under the partition scheme P1. Substitution rates were estimated for each gene under the
uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock, the Yule speciation process and the fixed topology in BEAST.
The ultrametric trees estimated with r8s were used as
starting trees in BEAST analyses to ensure that time
constraints were not violated. Two independent runs of
100 million generations, sampling every 10000 generations, were performed for each analysis. The convergence and mixing of each MCMC chain was assessed
with TRACER. Both independent runs of each analysis
were combined with LogCombiner after a 10% burn-in,
and TreeAnnotator was used to summarise the information from the sampled trees.
