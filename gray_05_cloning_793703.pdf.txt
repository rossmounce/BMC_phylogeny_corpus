Abstract
Background: One of the many ascribed functions of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in
vertebrates is insulation of genes via enhancer-blocking. Insulation allows genes to be shielded from
"cross-talk" with neighboring regulatory elements. As such, endogenous insulator sequences would
be valuable elements to enable stable transgene expression. Recently, CTCF joined Su(Hw), Zw5,
BEAF32 and GAGA factor as a protein associated with insulator activity in the fruitfly, Drosophila
melanogaster. To date, no known insulators have been described in mosquitoes.
Results: We have identified and characterized putative CTCF homologs in the medicallyimportant mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. These genes encode polypeptides with
eleven C2H2 zinc fingers that show significant similarity to those of vertebrate CTCFs, despite at
least 500 million years of divergence. The mosquito CTCFs are constitutively expressed and are
upregulated in early embryos and in the ovaries of blood-fed females. We have uncovered
significant bioinformatics evidence that CTCF is widespread, at least among Drosophila species.
Finally, we show that the An. gambiae CTCF binds two known insulator sequences.
Conclusion: Mosquito CTCFs are likely orthologous to the widely-characterized vertebrate
CTCFs and potentially also serve an insulating function. As such, CTCF may provide a powerful
tool for improving transgene expression in these mosquitoes through the identification of
endogenous binding sites.

Background
CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) was originally identified as
a transcriptional repressor in studies of the chicken lysozyme silencer [1] and the regulation of the chicken c-myc
gene [2]. Since that time, CTCF has been extensively characterized in vertebrates as a ubiquitously-expressed,
highly-conserved, multivalent transcription factor that
utilizes different zinc finger (ZF) combinations to specifically bind diverse nucleotide sequences, resulting in the
repression or activation of target genes, creation of hor-

mone-responsive silencers and the formation of
enhancer-blocking boundary elements (reviewed in [3]).
Multiple, independent studies have established vertebrate
CTCF as a central player in the regulation of gene expression via its association with every known vertebrate insulator [3-5]. Further characterization of these proteins
revealed their insulator function to be central in three contexts: (a) constitutive insulation of the chicken β-globin
gene at the 5'HS4 site [6,7] and the human apolipoprotein B gene at the 5' boundary [8], (b) imprinted

insulation via methylation-sensitive binding to the Igfr2H19 control locus [6,9-14], the DM1 locus [5] and the
DLK1/GTL2 locus [15], and (c) as part of a more complex,
multipartite insulator regulated by ligand binding [16].
Most recently, CTCF-dependent insulators have been
identified in transitional chromatin, with high levels of
H3 acetylation and essentially no CpG methylation,
between escape and inactivated genes on both mouse and
human inactivated X chromosomes [17]. Finally, Tsix and
CTCF have been proposed to comprise a regulated epigenetic switch for X-inactivation in mammals [18]. Clearly,
CTCF plays a pivotal role at multiple levels of gene regulation and genome organization in vertebrate organisms.
Long thought to be exclusive to vertebrates, a CTCF orthologue was recently characterized in Drosophila melanogaster
with domain structure, binding site specificity and transcriptional repressor activity similar to that of vertebrate
CTCF [19]. Significantly, these researchers also demonstrated that a known Drosophila insulator, Fab8, mediates
enhancer-blocking via CTCF in both Drosophila and vertebrate cell lines. We have cloned and characterized two
mosquito CTCF-like cDNAs encoding polypeptides with
significant similarity and insulator binding properties to
both the vertebrate and Drosophila CTCFs. Analysis of
available genome sequence from numerous invertebrate
species yields promising candidates for additional CTCF
orthologues. Clearly, this versatile protein has much more
ancient roots than once thought.

Results
Cloning of Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae CTCF-like
cDNAs
A BLAST search using the human CTCF protein sequence
[20] as a query uncovered a cDNA from D. melanogaster
[AAL78208], subsequently characterized by Moon et al.
[19] as an orthologous CTCF factor. This sequence was
then used to query the An. gambiae genome assembly at
the Ensembl database [21], resulting in a highly significant
hit
of
the
predicted
novel
gene
ENSANGG00000015222 (e-139). These two dipteran
sequences were aligned with known vertebrate CTCF
sequences from Gallus gallus [22], Mus musculus and Homo
sapiens [20], Rattus norvegicus [NP_114012.1] and Xenopus
laevis [23] using the ClustalW algorithm (Vector NTI™
Suite 8, InforMax, Inc., 1999). This multiple sequence
alignment was used for degenerate PCR primer design.
Degenerate PCR amplification, using Ae. aegypti larval
cDNA as a template, yielded a single PCR product of 504
base pairs, corresponding to a 168 amino acid polypeptide containing six of the eleven predicted zinc-finger
domains. PCR amplification was initially performed with
an An. gambiae larval cDNA template and primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the predicted novel coding sequence. This yielded a single product of 2040 base

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/6/16

pairs, corresponding to a translated polypeptide of 680
amino acid residues. Subsequent 5' and 3' RACE (rapid
amplification of cDNA ends) in both species yielded putative full-length cDNAs of 2616 and 4544 base pairs for Ae.
aegypti (AY935523) and An. gambiae (AY939827), respectively. Alignment of the corresponding polypeptide
sequences with both the D. melanogaster and H. sapiens
CTCFs revealed significant differences in the N-terminal
and C-terminal regions of the protein, however there was
38% identity and 56% similarity across all eleven zinc finger domains (Fig. 1). Furthermore, 68% of the critical
binding residues were conserved, despite at least 500 million years of divergence between invertebrate and vertebrate species [24].
CTCF appears widespread in Drosophila species
Available genome sequence for multiple drosophilid species was queried at Flybase [25] using the An. gambiae
amino acid sequence and the tBLASTx algorithm. All species searched produced single hits of very high significance, ≤ e-126. Each of these was submitted as a BLASTp
query of the non-redundant database at NCBI [26] and
confirmed to be a significant match to known CTCFs.
Sequences with complete zinc finger regions were
trimmed to the zinc-finger region plus five flanking amino
acid residues and aligned with the corresponding region
of CTCFs from H. sapiens, G. gallus, X. laevis, Danio rerio
[NP_001001844], Tetraodon nigroviridis [CAF99566], and
Fugu
rubripes
(Ensembl
novel
gene
SINFRUG00000147322). The corresponding region of
zinc finger protein 2 from Caenorhabditis elegans
[NP_500033], a protein that contains 11 C2H2 zinc finger
domains, a coil-coil region and predicted nuclear localization sequence, was also included in the alignment and
used as an outgroup in the subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Two consensus distance-based trees, Neighbor-Joining [27] (Fig. 2) and Fitch-Margoliash [28] (data not
shown), were generated with 5000 bootstrap replicates
using the Phylip software package [29,30]. Additionally, a
maximum-likelihood tree generated by 200,000 iterations of Tree-Puzzle [31] (data not shown) and a Bayesian
analysis tree generated by 200,000 cycles of BAMBE [32]
with 20,000 cycles of burn-in (data not shown), yielded
identical branch topologies.
Mosquito CTCF is expressed constitutively in all
developmental stages and is upregulated in early embryos
and the ovaries of blood-fed females
Reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR amplifications of RNA
isolated from embryos, ovaries, larvae, pupae and adults
shows CTCF expression across all stages of development
and in the ovarian tissues of both Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster (Fig. 3). Early Ae. aegypti embryos and ovarian tissues from both species clearly show increased expression
levels.

CTCF protein.

Discussion

Mosquito CTCF binds in-vitro to both the chicken 5'HS4
and the Drosophila Fab8 insulators
As we were unable to express the full-length mosquito
CTCF protein in bacteria, whole cell lysates were prepared
from the An. gambiae Sua4 [33] cell line and used in an
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to assess
whether mosquito CTCF could bind known CTCF-associated insulator sequences (Fig. 5). The intensity of the
shifted bands increased with application of greater
amounts of protein lysate. The detectable complex was
competed by cold, unlabeled probe, indicating that binding was indeed specific. In addition, all reactions con-

Vertebrate CTCFs, from fish to human, are ≥ 98% identical across the entire zinc finger core of the protein. Comparison of the three dipteran CTCFs reveals 54% identity
and 68% similarity within this same region. In addition,
amino acid residues considered critical for DNA binding
[34] are 89% conserved among these three insect species.
This apparent discrepancy can be partially addressed by
investigating the molecular substitution rate heterogeneity among vertebrates and invertebrates. Recent maximum
likelihood analysis of a set of 50 nuclear genes for vertebrates and dipterans, with Arabidopsis as an outgroup, suggests that the rate of vertebrate molecular evolution

slowed considerably with respect to that of dipterans,
prior to the origin of the crown-group, Osteichthyes [24].
The much shorter generation times of dipterans have
undoubtedly facilitated significant differences in their
genome sizes (ranging from 179 Mb in D. melanogaster
[35] to 813 Mb in Ae. aegypti [36]) and gene organization
patterns, attributable primarily to the number and distribution of repetitive sequences [37]. This would perhaps
result in predictions of even greater sequence divergence
than is observed in the CTCF genes. It seems likely that at
least some of the many attributed vertebrate functions of
CTCF are ancestral.
Each of the species examined yielded a single, extremely
significant match followed by numerous matches of lesser
significance, suggesting a single copy locus. Significant

divergence in available N-terminal or C-terminal
sequence supports the earlier observation that dipteran
genomes have evolved very quickly, and thus these
regions may not be critical to the conserved ancestral function(s) of this gene. Additionally, these regions may be
more directly involved in protein-protein interactions
with other proteins having likewise undergone evolutionary adaptation. High bootstrap support and essentially
identical trees generated by four independent methods
establishes the tree presented in Fig. 2 as representative of
the evolution of this gene sequence. Less bootstrap support in the vertebrate clade is more indicative of the
homogeneity of the sequence, rather than uncertainty as
to where these species should be located in the tree.
Clearly, CTCF is present in vertebrates from fish through
mammals and is highly conserved. Of interest is its consistent presence in all Drosophila species queried. The relatedness of the protein sequences mirror the accepted
taxonomic relationships among these species as presented
at FlyBase [25], likely indicative of a conserved critical
function. Significant EST evidence from the flour beetle,
Tribolium castaneum, the honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the
silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, suggests the presence of
CTCF-like genes in multiple insect orders.

The RT-PCR data from both mosquito and fly are consistent with one another, repeatable, and in agreement with
both in-situ hybridization data [38] posted for the fly at
the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project website [39] and
fly microarray data summarized at Yale University's Drosophila Developmental Gene Expression Timecourse
website [40]. In-situ hybridization shows high-levels of
Drosophila CTCF transcript ubiquitously distributed
throughout stage 1–3 embryos. mRNA levels then
decrease until approximately stage 9 where they then
increase primarily in the developing nervous and sensory
tissues. The neural-specific expression pattern also corresponds to findings in X. laevis where in-situ hybridization
with staged embryos revealed weak homogeneous
staining prior to stage 14, with subsequent upregulation
in neural tissues and the sensory organs of the head [23].
Furthermore, over-expression of CTCF in mice during
early embryogenesis resulted in decreased expression of
the highly conserved homeobox gene Pax6, causing ocular
defects [34]. Microarray data analysis clusters fly CTCF
(CG8591) with genes exhibiting a single peak in expression during development, those showing significant
expression increases in early embryogenesis, genes with
expression changes of at least four-fold across development, and those expressed in the female germline [41].
Taken together, these expression data and the corresponding functional data from vertebrates suggest that CTCF
may indeed also be multi-functional in insects. Some possible roles include the regulation of homeobox genes like
Pax6, the facilitation of chromatin organization during
early development and the establishment and/or maintenance of heterochromatic and euchromatic regions.
The EMSA data support a role for CTCF in endogenous
mosquito insulator function and confirm recent findings
that the insulator function of CTCF is conserved from
invertebrate to vertebrate species [19]. Currently, position
effect and position-effect variegation complicate efforts to
establish stable transgenic lines in Ae. aegypti and other
mosquitoes. Particularly problematic is the highly
repetitive nature of much of the intergenic sequence, as
well as the compact nature of the genome, which places
regulatory elements from neighboring genes in close proximity to one another, where they may inappropriately
impact the transgene of interest. The ability to flank transgenes with short, conserved endogenous insulator
sequences could significantly improve observed expression levels, and possibly increase the frequency of recovery of transgenic individuals.

the zinc-finger region. Constitutively expressed in all life
stages, mosquito CTCFs are highly upregulated in early
embryos and in the ovarian tissues of blood-fed female
mosquitoes. Finally, mosquito CTCF specifically binds
both the chicken 5'HS4 β-globin and the fly Fab8 insulator
sequences. Further characterization of these CTCFs and
their binding sites will provide a promising avenue for
insulating transgenes in these medically-important mosquito species.

Methods
Isolation of RNA and preparation of cDNA by reversetranscription
Total RNA was isolated from ~30 mg each of Ae. aegypti
and An. gambiae larvae using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by DNase I-treatment with
DNA-free™ (Ambion, Austin, TX) and was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using the SuperScript II™ reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the
manufacturer's instructions. In order to increase the efficiency of the reverse-transcription reaction, 150 ng/µL of
T4 Gene 32 Protein [42] was added to the 1st strand buffer.
Isolation of Ae. aegypti CTCF by degenerate PCR

The amino acid sequences of all known and predicted
CTCFs
[EAA11339.1,
AAL78208,
AAG40852,
NP_031820, NP_114012, P49711 and Q08705] were
identified using the BLAST search algorithm at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and aligned using
the ClustalW algorithm in the Vector NTI™ Suite (InforMax, Inc., 1999). Two completely nested and degenerate
PCR primer pairs were designed to a highly-conserved 168
amino acid region using CODEHOP [43,44]. A 504 base
pair nested PCR product was obtained from Ae. aegypti larval cDNA using G-1F and K-1R primers in the first PCR
reaction, followed by a nested reaction with primers G-2F
and J-1R. Each reaction was performed with 2 mM MgCl2,
0.2 µM each primer, 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µL cDNA or 1st
reaction product and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Continental Lab Products, San Diego, CA). The following
touchdown PCR conditions were used: 96°C for 4'; 2
cycles of 96°C for 20", 72°C for 1'; 11 cycles of 96°C for
20", 71°C -1.0°C/cycle for 15", 72°C for 45"; 25 cycles of
96°C for 15", 59°C for 15", 72°C for 45"; final extension

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) in Ae. aegypti
and An. gambiae
Total RNA was prepared from freshly collected and snapfrozen larvae using the RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen) and
immediately DNase I-treated with DNA-free™ (Ambion)
according to the manufacturers' instructions. The BD
SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Palo
Alto, CA) was then used to prepare first-strand cDNA and
to amplify 5' and 3' RACE products according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gene-specific primers (GSPs)
used for each species were: AedesGSP1 5' gtctgtcttgcgcccacatgttg 3', AedesGSP2 5' cgaaagcacgtttacaacttctgg 3',
AnophelesGSP1 5' ccacaggtcgtcgggcagagtttgca 3', Anopheles
GSP2 5' caatcggagtaagattgtccgaagaaaggtct 3'. GSP1 indicates the primer used for 5' RACE reactions while GSP2
indicates the primer used for 3' RACE reactions. Reaction
conditions were as follows: 94°C for 5'; 5 cycles of 94°C
for 10", 72°C for 3'; 5 cycles of 94°C for 10", 70°C for
10", 72°C for 3'; 25 cycles of 94°C for 10", 68°C for 10",
72°C for 3'; final extension at 72°C for 8'.
Cloning and sequencing of PCR and RACE products
Products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel, gel purified,
cloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) and had
their DNA sequence determined using an ABI 3100 capillary sequencer with M13 (-20) and M13 Reverse primers
followed by primer walking. At least 3 different clones
were analyzed for each PCR or RACE product. The resulting sequences have been deposited in the NCBI GenBank
database and have the following accession numbers:
[AY935523] (Ae. aegypti) and [AY939827] (An. gambiae).
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were trimmed to the 11 ZF region plus five
flanking amino acid residues and aligned using MultAlin
[45] with the Blosum62 model, a gap opening penalty of
35, a gap extension penalty of 0.5 and no end gap penalty.
The resulting alignment was analyzed using the Phylip
software package [29]: bootstrapped (5000 replicates)
with Seqboot, a distance matrix computed using Protdist
(5000 datasets), the matrix submitted to Neighbor or
Fitch (5000 trees), a consensus tree determined using

Reverse-Transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis/developmental
profile
Total RNA was prepared from freshly collected and snapfrozen samples, DNase treated and the reverse-transcription reaction performed as described above. PCR reactions were assembled with 100 ng cDNA template, 10X
buffer, 1.5 µL 10 mM dNTPs, 0.2 µM each primer (Table
1) and 1 µL Advantage2 Taq Polymerase (Clontech) in a
total volume of 50 µL. Reaction conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5'; 20, 25 or 30 cycles (see Fig. 3) of 95°C
for 15", 55°C for 15", 72°C for 30"; final extension at
72°C for 2'. Products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, destained with
ddH2O and imaged. The constitutively expressed D. melanogaster Rp49 gene (153 bp product) and Ae. aegypti S17
gene (200 bp product) were used as controls. Primers
were as follows: AedesRT-Forw 5' gtgtttcattgcgagctttgcc 3',

Generation of polyclonal antisera against An. gambiae
CTCF
The coding sequence for a C-terminal region (amino acid
residues 444–680) was PCR amplified and cloned into the
pET-30 plasmid (Novagen, VWR International, Bristol,
CT), expressed in E. coli (BL21-DE3) and His-tag purified
on a Ni-NTA column (Novagen). The purified protein was
used to immunize two New Zealand white rabbits following standard procedures.
Immunoblotting
Sua4 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris,
pH 7.8; 150 mM NaCl; 1% IGEPAL CA360 (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO)) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and 1 mM PMSF. Total cell
lysate protein was quantitated using the BCA Protein
Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), aliquoted and frozen at 20°C. Total cell lysate was separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gel
and electroblotted to a PVDF membrane in 1X Towbin
buffer according to standard protocols. Upon completion
of the protein transfer, the gel was washed twice for 10
minutes in 1X TBS buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150
mM NaCl). It was then blocked in blocking buffer (1.5%
non-fat dry milk (NFDM), 1.5% fraction V Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA), 1X TBS, 0.05% Tween-20) with 20% 5X
casein (Novagen), in a sealed bag overnight at 4°C. The
blot was then washed twice for 10 minutes in 1X TBSTT
and once for 10 minutes in 1X TBS and was incubated for
1 hour at room temperature on an orbital shaker with
CTCF polyclonal antisera diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer
without casein. After antibody binding, the blot was

washed twice in 1X TBSTT (1X TBS, 0.05% Tween-20,
0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 minutes and once in 1X TBS for
10 minutes. Anti-Rabbit IgG (Fc) AP conjugate (Promega,
Madison, WI 53711) was diluted 1:7500 in blocking
buffer without casein and incubated with the blot for 1
hour at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The blot
was then washed for 10 minutes five times in 1X TBSTT.
Finally, it was developed for 1–10 minutes in SigmaFAST™ (Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO
63178) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
Sua4 cell lysates were prepared and the total protein quantitated as described above. Probes for EMSA were amplified and simultaneously labelled with α-32P (Amersham)
by PCR using the following primers: 5'HS4Forw 5' gagctcacggggacagcccccc 3', 5'HS4Rev 5' aagctttttccccgtatccccc 3',
Fab8Forw 5' ggcacaatcaagttaatgttgg 3', Fab8Rev 5'
gcaagcgaagagttccattc 3'. The chicken 5'HS4 fragment (250
bp) was amplified from pJC13-1 [46] and the Drosophila
Fab8 fragment (309 bp) was amplified from Drosophila
genomic DNA. The binding reaction protocol was
adapted from Filippova et al. [20]. Approximately 10 fmol
of labelled probe was incubated for 15 minutes on ice
with 0, 1.5, 7.5 or 15 µg of total cell protein in binding
buffer (1X PBS with 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnSO4, 1 mM
DTT, 0.1% IGEPAL CA360 (Sigma), 10% glycerol) in the
presence of a mixture of non-specific, cold, doublestranded competitor DNAs (500 ng polydI· polydC, 500
ng polydG· polydC, 500 ng SpI oligos, 500 ng Egr1 oligos). The SpI and Egr1 ds oligos contain strong, C/G-rich
binding sites for the zinc-finger proteins SpI and Egr1
respectively. Sample 5 contained 150-fold excess unlabeled specific competitor. For the supershift, anti-sera
against the An. gambiae CTCF was then added and the
reactions incubated an additional 15 minutes on ice.
Complexes were separated from the free probe on a 5%
native PAGE gel in 0.5X TBE. The gel was run for 3.5 hours
at 4°C at 10 V/cm.
