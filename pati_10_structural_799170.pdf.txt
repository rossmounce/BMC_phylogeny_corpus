(c-Kit) interaction with tyrosine phosphatase-2
(Shp-2): An in silico analysis

Abstract
Background: Stem cell factor (SCF) receptor c-Kit is recognized as a key signaling molecule, which transduces
signals for the proliferation, differentiation and survival of stem cells. Binding of SCF to its receptor triggers
transactivation, leading to the recruitment of kinases and phosphatases to the docking platforms of c-Kit catalytic
domain. Tyrosine phosphatase-1 (Shp-1) deactivates/attenuates ‘Kit’ kinase activity. Whereas, Asp816Val mutation in
the Kit activation loop transforms kinase domain to a constitutively activated state (switch off-to-on state), in a
ligand-independent manner. This phenomenon completely abrogates negative regulation of Shp-1. To predict the
possible molecular basis of interaction between c-Kit and Shp-1, we have performed an in silico protein-protein
docking study between crystal structure of activated c-Kit (phosphorylated c-Kit) and full length crystal structure of
Shp-2, a close structural counterpart of Shp-1.
Findings: Study revealed a stretch of conserved amino acids (Lys818 to Ser821) in the Kit activation domain, which
makes decisive H-bonds with N-sh2 and phosphotyrosine binding pocket residues of the phosphatase. These Hbonds may impose an inhibitory steric hindrance to the catalytic domain of c-Kit, there by blocking further
interaction of the activation loop molecules with incoming kinases. We have also predicted a phosphotyrosine
binding pocket in SH2 domains of Shp-1, which is found to be predominantly closer to a catalytic groove like
structure in c-Kit kinase domain.
Conclusions: This study predicts that crucial hydrogen bonding between N-sh2 domain of Shp-1 and Kit activation
loop can modulate the negative regulation of c-Kit kinase by Shp-1. Thus, this finding is expected to play a
significant role in designing suitable gain-of-function c-Kit mutants for inducing conditional proliferation of
hematopoietic stem cells.

Findings
Research hypothesis

The c-Kit controls major signaling cascades in hematopoietic stem cells. Earlier study indicated that the catalytic domain of c-Kit consists of many important loop
regions, such as catalytic loop (786-796), activation loop
(810-839) and substrate-binding loop (829-837), which
play crucial role in the activation of Kit kinase domain
[1]. Transformation of c-Kit kinase domain from an
inactive to hyperactive state is reported to occur on the
basis of three distinct molecular phenomena. These are
(i) binding of ATP to glycine rich loop residues (596* Correspondence: ashok@nii.res.in

601), (ii) release of self-inhibitory interaction between
substrate binding loop and activation loop, and (iii) loss
of intramolecular H-bonds between Lys818-Asp816 and
Asn819-Asp816 [1].
Binding of stem cell factor (SCF) to its receptors triggers dimerization coupled transphosphorylation of c-Kit
catalytic domain [2-4], which then emerges with a dual
phosphorylated tyrosine containing conserved motif
(Y 568 V 569 Y 570 ) in human c-Kit [5]. Interestingly, this
motif acts as a common docking site for SH2 and SH3
domain containing proteins [6]. The adaptor protein
APS, Src family of kinases and Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase bind to Y568. Similarly, Shp-1 tyrosine phosphatase
and the adaptor protein Shc bind to Y570; whereas, Cterminal Src homologous kinase (Chk) and the adaptor

Shc bind to both Y568 and Y570 [7]. Shp-1 is known as a
negative regulator of various receptors in hematopoietic
cells, including c-Kit kinase [8,9]. Shp-1 and Shp-2 share
both sequence and structural homologies [10]. Previous
studies have shown that a gain of function mutation,
Asp816 to Val816 (a molecular representative of mastocytosis) in Kit activation loop leads to extensive degradation of Shp-1, indicating disruption of Shp-1 and cKit interaction [11,12].
Though SH2 domains of both Shp-1 and Shp-2 are
known to interact with c-Kit, the molecular basis of this
interaction has not been elucidated. The present study
suggests some important residues in Kit activation loop
and N-sh2 domain that play crucial role in negative regulation of c-Kit kinase.

Results
Multiple sequence alignment of c-Kit kinase related
protein

Activated Kit kinase, triggered either by ligand-dependent or ligand-independent manner, generates several
phosphorylated tyrosine containing docking motifs in its
juxtamembrane domain. Multiple sequence alignment
study showed a conserved regulatory motif “EEINGNNYVYIDP” in juxtamembrane domain of Kit kinase (Fig.
1). Further analysis of “EEINGNNYVYIDP” by Motif
scan showed a conserved dual tyrosine residue, which is
positioned as Y568V569Y570 in human c-Kit (Additional
file 1). These two tyrosine residues, Y 568 and Y 570 at
positions +1 and +3 act as docking molecule for various
kinases as well as SH2 and SH3 domain containing proteins. Amongst SH2 and SH3 domain containing proteins epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet derived
growth factor receptor, PLCg, N/C-sh2, Abl kinase, Src
family kinases and phosphatases (Shp-1 and Shp-2) are
important [13-15]. The alignment study also revealed
deletion in the above motif (YV deleted at +1, +2 positions) in transforming tyrosine-protein kinase Kit (Swiss
prot ID P04048), normally synthesized as Gag-Kit-Pol
polyprotein. The crystal structure data of c-Kit also
expose Y568 and Y570 as the primary dual tyrosines to
get phosphorylated following in vitro trans-phosphorylation reaction [5]. So they predominantly act as primary
docking site in vivo to the downstream signaling molecules. These two residues belong to juxtamembrane
switch motif of c-Kit (stretched in 560-571 residues)
and is also a part of auto inhibitory JMD (spanning
from 553 to 663), which makes a putative a helix. This
juxtamembrane segment in c-Kit makes a wedge that
stabilizes inactive conformation by preventing rotation
of the small kinase lobe towards the large kinase lobe to
generate active kinase conformation. Point mutations in
this motif are associated with gastrointestinal stromal
tumors, as they abolish the regulation of Kit kinase

activity [16,17]. In Gag-Kit the deletion of “YV” in
“EEINGNNYVYIDP” motif and other deleted auto-inhibitory JMD residues before the same motif suggest two
possible reasons for its transformation. The first reason
could be due to the abrogation of Shp-1 mediated negative regulation, as Shp-1 can not be recruited to YVY.
The second reason may be due to change of JMD
mediated auto-inhibition of kit kinase to its hyper-activated state [18-20].
Multiple sequence alignment of the ligand: Shp-2 and
Shp-1 with SH2 domain containing proteins

To identify the crucial residues in Shp-2 and Shp-1 that
can interact with tyrosine kinases, multiple alignments
of SH2 domains of phosphatases with other SH2
domain family proteins was performed. The SH2
domains of p85 subunit of PI3 kinase, LCK, HCK, Src
and c-ZAP showed conserved phosphorylated tyrosinebinding pockets (PY pockets) comprising of “FLARPS”
in N-sh2 and “FLVRES” in C-sh2 domains phosphatases
(Fig. 2). PY pockets represented three fully conserved
amino acid residues: F, L and R. The functionally important residues in this motif initiate strong decisive interactions between guanidinium group of invariant arginine
residue at a conserved position in SH2 and anionic PY
phosphate group, as shown in structure of p85 subunit
of PI3 kinase [21]. This PY pocket showed 100% conservation of Phe and Arg at +1 and +4 positions, 85% conservation of Leu at +2 and 71% conservation of Ser at
+6 positions, respectively in N-sh2 domain containing
proteins (Fig. 2). This explains positive role of PY residues in N-sh2 domain interaction. Whereas, LCK and
HCK contain 23%, 27%, 25% and 29% conservation of
Phe, Arg, Leu and Ser at + 1, +4, +2 and +6 positions,
respectively in C-sh2 domain. The position of this PY
pocket was then identified in crystal structure of Shp-2
and displayed in Rasmol prior to docking (Additional
file 2A). The recognition of phosphorylated tyrosines in
c-Kit by SH2 domain, and binding of these tyrosine residues to SH2 domain may occur in a typical “plug and
socket” manner. It is similar to SH2 domain bound
phosphotyrosine peptides complexes, as shown by NMR
and X-ray structural studies [21,22].
Docking of Shp-2 and c-Kit cytoplasmic domain

The protein docking study was performed using activated/phosphorylated crystal structure of Kit cytoplasmic domain and Shp-2 (which mimics interaction of
ligand-dependent or independent activated Kit Kinase
with Shp-1 in vivo) [8]. The bound ligand-substrate
complexes were generated on the basis of different
repulsion values used in the programme and the best
chosen values were 6.6 and 6.4A° (Table 1). We also
plotted different repulsion values against the distances
measured between N-sh2 domain of Shp-2 and an activation loop residue Asp816 (Table 1 and Fig. 3A), as it

conserved Y568V569Y570 stretch of residues in “EEINGNNYVYIDP” motif, which is used as a docking platform for SH2 and SH3 domain containing
proteins.

show conserved PY pockets, such as “FLVRES” in C-sh2 and “FLARPS” in N-sh2 domains of both Shp-1 and Shp-2. Percentage of sequence
identity, conservation of residues in PY pockets as well as sh2 domains are shown as change in color intensity. PY pocket is found to be highly
conserved in N-sh2 domains, in comparison to C-sh2 domains.

plays crucial role in maintaining closed or open conformation of Kit kinase domain. The data showed that
Ile571 and Val569 of “EEINGNNYV 569 YI 571 DPTQ”
came into close vicinity of Asp26 and Tyr100 of N-sh2
domain, whereas Asp816 stayed predominantly closer to
Tyr100 of N-sh2 by 4.7A° (Additional file 2B, 3A, 3B).
Thus we propose that there can be a possible mode of
interaction between N-sh2 and activation loop residues

containing Asp816, relevant to the modulation of conformation in activation loop.
Checking of errors in docked complexes

Examining the substrate-bound complexes of Shp-2 is
extremely essential while determining the distances
between residues of interacting domains. The analysis
showed negligible inter-atomic clashes, zero bumping
into each other, and very few intramolecular constraints

in Tyr100 of N-sh2. To verify hydrogen bonding, we
changed the torsion angle from -156.66 to -116.66
between amino group of Tyr100 and the carboxyl group
of Asn819, which showed that the hydrogen bonding of
4.76A° converted to 3.67A° (Additional file 3B).
Analysis of protein-protein interaction

The most striking feature observed in Shp-2 bound Kit
complex was the presence of a catalytic cleft like structure made of important residues, like Lys786 to Cys
788, Lys818, Asn819, His 790, Asp792, Thr847, Phe 848,
Leu 912, Thr916, Lys 918 and Tyr646, which are highly
conserved among c-Kit related kinases (Fig. 3B). These
residues were found to be in very close proximity to
Tyr100, Ala75, Gly76, Glu79, Met82, Gly83 and His85

of N-sh2, therefore expected to interact to form a stable
conformation.
Evaluation of hydrogen bonding between catalytic cleft
and SH2 domains

Shp-2 bound activated Kit kinase complex mimics the
physical interaction between autophosphorylated Kit
kinase domain with the SH2 domains of Shp-1, both
in vitro and in vivo (Fig 4A). We have detected that
certain N-sh2 terminal residues, like Ser28, Ala75,
Gly76, Glu79, Met82, Gly83, His85, Tyr100 and
Pro101 (Fig. 4B, displayed in red colored balls and
sticks) are making distinct hydrogen bonding with the
c-terminal Kit kinase lobe residues (Fig. 4B, displayed
in violet color balls and sticks). These results showed

848 (blue), Thr847 and His790 (green), Asn787, Asp786 and Lys 918 (white), Lys786, Leu 912 and Tyr646 (mauve color), contribute in making a
catalytic cleft like structure in c-Kit.

that residues from Lys818 to Ser821 in Kit catalytic
cleft make distinct hydrogen bonding with both PY
pocket and N-sh2 domain, for example Lys818 and
Asn819 with Tyr100, Asp820 with His85, and Ser821
with Met82 (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Residues from 649653 of N-terminal Kit kinase lobe were found to make
hydrogen bonding with the C-sh2 domain residues.
These interactions were detected specifically in surrounding of c-terminal kinase groove (Fig. 4B, in
golden yellow) made of Leu783 as the tunnel-making
residue inside groove. All the hydrogen bonding
detected between conserved catalytic cleft and Kit
kinase domains are at 2-3A° in distance. The earlier

homology modeling study on Kit kinase has shown
that release of auto-inhibition of activation loop is largely dependent on the disruption of intramolecular
hydrogen bond interactions between Asp816 with the
peptide backbones of Lys818 and Asn819, which transits the activation loop into a more flexible conformation [1].
Our study suggest that subsequent loss of the above
intramolecular hydrogen bonding, Lys818 and Asn819
of Kit activation loop might be interacting with conserved PY pocket residue (Ser28 and conserved Tyr100
of N-sh2 domain) for physical blocking of activation
loop motifs for further interaction.

interacted with Kit catalytic residues (stretch of violet color). The golden color displays the groove like structure in Kit catalytic domain. B. Hbonds are detected between SH2 domains and Kit cytoplasmic domain. Discontinuous white lines appear as the H-bonds between SH2 domain
residues (red color ball and sticks) and Kit kinase lobe (pink color ball and sticks) residues. The white background displays important hydrogen
bonding between Kit activation loop residues comprising Lys818 to Ser821 and N-sh2 domain residues.

Discussion
The activity of c-Kit is controlled through two important mechanisms: either by juxtamembrane segment
auto-inhibition or by phosphatases mediated inhibition.
The c-Kit is auto-inhibited by its juxtamembrane segment as it forms a V-shaped loop, inserted directly into
the kinase lobes and displaces aC helix of Kit [23]. Subsequent to the activation of Kit kinase, the intramolecular H-bonds between Lys818-Asp816 and Asn819Asp816 are disrupted, which further destabilizes the
activation loop, releasing the steric hindrances associated with the rearrangement of the lobes. This phenomenon allows correct positioning of residues in and
from active site, thus opening up the activated structure
of Kit kinase (Additional file 4).
On the basis of our investigation, we propose that in
activated c-Kit, the residues Lys818 and Asn819 make
intermolecular hydrogen bonding with N-sh2 domain
residues “Tyr100 and Ser28” as a result of the disruption
of intramolecular hydrogen bonding with Asp816 (Fig.
5). The constitutive change of Asp816 to Val may also
lead to deleterious effects by disrupting these H-bonds
with Lys818 and Asn819, as Asp816 has the capability to
stabilize a positively charged a helical dipole by virtue of
negative charge in its side chain and also serving as an
amino-terminal capping to Ile817, Lys818, Asn819 and
Asp820. So a point mutation to hydrophobic or aromatic
amino acid would potentially destabilize this interaction,
thereby forcing activation loop to transit from inactive to
active confirmation, disrupting the Shp-1 association.
This leads to an enhanced ubiquitinin-mediated degradation of Shp-1 [12]. Strikingly, Asp820 signature molecule
of systemic mast cell disorder (SMCD) [represented as
Asp820Gly] forms a hydrogen bond with the His85 of N-

sh2 domain [24,25]. This also explains the role of Asp820
in Shp-1 binding. So it is considered that, Kit activation
loop residues play a critical role in Shp-1 mediated negative regulation of Kit kinase.

Conclusion
In summary, our study has revealed that certain activation loop residues in c-Kit are crucial for interaction of
kinase with Shp-1, which may play a vital role in Shp-1
mediated down-regulation of c-Kit kinase activity. We
propose that point mutation in Lys818 to Ser821 and
Thr847 to Glu849 residues in Kit catalytic domain may
lead to the generation of hyperactive functional variants
of c-Kit. These may be implicated as efficient gene therapeutic candidates for conditional over-expression in the
regeneration of hematopoietic compartments.
Methods

by modular signaling domains, phosphorylated by protein Ser/Thr- or Tyr-kinases or mediate specific interactions with phospholipid ligands to initiate c-kit
mediated cell specific signaling [27].

docking to determine the best fit complexes (Fig. 3).
These repulsion values in A° were determined by three
factors, r ij (distance between ligand and receptor), U
(energy of repulsion) and R, “range” of the potential (the
grid step) using the mathematical relationship [29,30],
as shown in the Additional file 5. Distances lesser than
10A°, between important residues (within the predicted
interactive zones), decided the best positioning of two
proteins for further analysis (Fig. 3). We have used crystal structure of Shp-2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase),

a resolution of 2A°) [13] and activated crystal structure
of human c-Kit cytoplasmic domain (PDB: 1pkg; solved
at a resolution of 2.9A° as ligand and substrate) [5].
Analysis of models for the number of inter/intra-molecular clashes, formation of hydrogen bonding and visualization of model images were done by VMD

Additional file 4: Figure S4. Interaction of c-Kit with various downstream signaling molecules. Lys818 and Asn819 make intramolecular
hydrogen bonding with Asp816 in inactive c-Kit, making a closed
conformation of c-Kit kinase. Upon binding of SCF, a chain of molecular
events take place, comprising disruption of above intramolecular Hbonds and recruitment of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases at
the respective phosphorylated tyrosine containing docking sites at c-Kit
catalytic domain.
