Abstract
Background: The X-linked SRPX2 gene encodes a Sushi Repeat-containing Protein of unknown function and is mutated
in two disorders of the Rolandic/Sylvian speech areas. Since it is linked to defects in the functioning and the development
of brain areas for speech production, SRPX2 may thus have participated in the adaptive organization of such brain regions.
To address this issue, we have examined the recent molecular evolution of the SRPX2 gene.
Results: The complete coding region was sequenced in 24 human X chromosomes from worldwide populations and in
six representative nonhuman primate species. One single, fixed amino acid change (R75K) has been specifically
incorporated in human SRPX2 since the human-chimpanzee split. The R75K substitution occurred in the first sushi
domain of SRPX2, only three amino acid residues away from a previously reported disease-causing mutation (Y72S).
Three-dimensional structural modeling of the first sushi domain revealed that Y72 and K75 are both situated in the
hypervariable loop that is usually implicated in protein-protein interactions. The side-chain of residue 75 is exposed, and
is located within an unusual and SRPX-specific protruding extension to the hypervariable loop. The analysis of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate (Ka/Ks) ratio in primates was performed in order to test for positive selection
during recent evolution. Using the branch models, the Ka/Ks ratio for the human branch was significantly different (p =
0.027) from that of the other branches. In contrast, the branch-site tests did not reach significance. Genetic analysis was
also performed by sequencing 9,908 kilobases (kb) of intronic SRPX2 sequences. Despite low nucleotide diversity, neither
the HKA (Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé) test nor the Tajima's D test reached significance.
Conclusion: The R75K human-specific variation occurred in an important functional loop of the first sushi domain of
SRPX2, indicating that this evolutionary mutation may have functional importance; however, positive selection for R75K
could not be demonstrated. Nevertheless, our data contribute to the first understanding of molecular evolution of the
human SPRX2 gene. Further experiments are now required in order to evaluate the possible consequences of R75K on
SRPX2 interactions and functioning.

Background
Evolution studies have been undertaken to identify those
genetic changes that underlie human-specific features
such as susceptibility to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, bipedalism, a large brain, and higher-order cognitive
functions.
Several
phenotypic
differences
distinguishing human from other great apes species obviously rely on cerebral activity. Large-scale studies in
human and chimpanzee using either genome comparisons [1,2] or brain transcriptome analyses [3-5] have led
to the identification of a subset of genes that may have
contributed to the evolution of human brain anatomy
and activity from a common primate ancestor. An important complementary approach has relied on the study of
candidate genes selected on the basis of their importance
in specific human phenotypes. Consequently, several
genes involved in the structure and/or functioning of the
human brain have been associated with recent positive
selection: ASPM [6,7], MCPH1 [8-10], GLUD2 [11],
MAOA [12,13], SHH [14], and the "speech gene" FOXP2
[15-17]. More recently, accelerated evolution of noncoding sequences has also been shown [18,19].

200 000 years ago, or that there has been no episode of
positive selection on SRPX2.

Results and discussion
One single amino acid substitution (R75K) has been fixed
in human SRPX2 since the human-chimpanzee split
In silico screening of publicly available databases followed
by phylogenetic analysis showed that SRPX2 belongs to a
family of five genes: SRPX2 itself (sushi-repeat-containing
protein, X-linked 2), SRPX (sushi-repeat-containing protein, X-linked), SELP (selectin P precursor), SELE (selectin
E precursor), and SVEP1 (selectin-like protein) gene (Fig.
1; Additional file 1). This family emerged during vertebrate evolution. In order to trace the recent evolutionary
history of SRPX2, all coding exons were sequenced from a
subset of primate species that represent key evolutionary
steps: human [Genbank: NM_014467], chimpanzee
[Genbank: EF369515], gorilla [Genbank: EF369516],
orangutan [Genbank: EF369517], gibbon [Genbank:
EF369518], macaque [Genbank: EF369519], and baboon
[Genbank: EF369520]. Sequence comparison (Fig. 2)

The Rolandic and Sylvian fissures divide the cortex hemispheres of primates into their main anatomical structures.
In human, these areas participate in speech production
under the control of the Broca's area. We recently identified the SRPX2 gene as being responsible for two related
disorders of the Rolandic and Sylvian speech areas
[20,21]. Since it is linked to defects in the functioning and
the development of such brain regions, such as epileptic
seizures, oral and speech dyspraxia, or bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria, SRPX2 may be one of the specific
genes whose evolution at the DNA-level may have participated in the recent emergence of higher-order cognitive
functions, including the adaptive organization of brain
areas for speech production.
In this study, we have examined the molecular evolution
of the SRPX2 gene. One single, fixed amino acid change
occurred in the first sushi domain (also known as CCP –
complement control protein – module, or short consensus repeat) of SRPX2 after the human-chimpanzee split.
Three-dimensional modeling showed that both this evolutionary mutation and a previously identified diseaseassociated mutation [20] lie within a hypervariable loop
shared by all sushi modules and that has been implicated
in some cases in protein-protein interactions [22]. Using
the branch models, the synonymous/non-synonymous
analysis was consistent with accelerated evolution in the
human lineage but this could not be confirmed when the
branch-site models were used. Population genetics tests
did not reach statistical significance, indicating either that
a selective sweep may have occurred more than 100 000–

mosomes tested here, and in the 624 Caucasian control Xchromosomes previously screened [20].
K75 is situated in the hypervariable loop that is usually
implicated in protein-protein interactions
The R75K human-specific modification occurred in the
first sushi domain of the protein. Sushi domains have
been identified in several proteins of the complement system and in the selectin family of proteins [24]. They may
serve in protein-protein interactions [22], as demonstrated in the case of the neurocan-L1 interaction [25].
R75K occurs only three amino acid residues away from
the tyrosine residue (Y72) that is mutated in a patient with
rolandic seizures and bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria
and in his female relatives with mild mental retardation
[20]. The amino acid residue at position 75 may thus participate in the proper function of the first sushi domain of
SRPX2.

To further address this issue, three-dimensional modeling
of the first sushi module of the human SRPX2 protein (i.e.
sushi 1) was undertaken by homology with a known sushi
domain (CCP module) structure (Fig. 3; Additional file
2). Sushi domains are characterised by a compact hydrophobic core, containing an almost invariant Trp residue,
which is enclosed in a framework of five extended seg-

detected only five amino acid variant sites (1.1%; 5/465).
One discrepancy between the protein [Genbank:
ABN46998] predicted from the five chimpanzee SRPX2
sequences obtained here (see Methods section), and the
chimpanzee SRPX2 protein [Genbank: XP_521170] predicted from the genomic sequence at the UCSC database
[23], was detected (D429 in ABN46998; N429 in
XP_521170). This likely corresponds to an error in the
chimpanzee genome sequence previously available,
although it may be due to chimpanzee polymorphism.
The only amino acid substitution specific to the human
lineage is an Arg to Lys change at position 75, corresponding to a 224A>G mutation within exon 4 of SRPX2. The
possible importance of the R75K substitution in the evolution of the human species was indicated by the conservation of R75 in all SRPX2 orthologues, from nonhuman
primates to ray-finned fishes, as well as by the fixation of
K75 in human, as demonstrated by the lack of any variation at position 75 in silico, in the 24 worldwide X-chro-

ments that form β-strands for all or part of their lengths.
The extended segments are aligned with the long axis of
the module and are held together by two strictly conserved disulfide bridges [24]. In a previously performed
cluster assignment exercise undertaken for more than 240
sushi domain sequences [26], the first sushi domain of
SRPX (which is highly similar to sushi 1) fell into clusterD, which also includes many modules found within the
selectin family of proteins.
In almost all sushi domains, a region that is highly variable in length, sequence and conformation, and commonly referred to as the hypervariable loop [27], is
inserted within the second extended region. Depending
on its length this projects laterally from the module and
forms an obvious candidate surface for protein-protein
recognition. Indeed, the hypervariable loop has been
implicated as a "hot-spot" for several protein-protein
interactions and disease-causing mutations in CCP-containing complement proteins [22,28-30]. In the sushi 1
model (Fig. 3) an additional disulfide bridge (cysteine residues C71-C87), atypical of the classical sushi domain
fold, is evident. Cys71 lies at the beginning of the hypervariable loop that is exceptionally long in sushi 1. The
hypervariable loop is thus forced to form a prominent
protrusion extending towards the N-terminus of the module. This feature has neither been seen in any experimentally determined sushi module structure to date, nor is
predicted to occur in other members of the D-cluster
except SRPX.
The Y72S mutation is largely solvent exposed and located
within the hypervariable loop, adjacent to the cysteine residue (C71) that participates in the non-typical, third,
disulfide bridge. This change from a large aromatic sidechain (tyrosine; Y) to a small, polar one (serine; S) at position 72 will have a profound effect on the surface properties of this region that is close to the aforementioned
prominent protrusion. K75 is located nearby, within the
protrusion, and its side-chain is exposed (Fig. 3). It is reasonable to suggest that the unique structure formed by the
hypervariable loop of sushi 1 performs a role that is specific to the SRPX2 protein. Presumably, it is not a coincidence, that it is also the site of the human-specific change.
An R75K substitution is a conservative one; the substitution of one exposed, positively charged residue for
another can easily be accommodated by small atom shifts
in surrounding side-chains, and is not likely to affect the
structure of the sushi domain. Such a change might have
a small but not a dramatic functional effect. Conservative
substitutions are thought to play a role in adaptive change
[31]. Moreover, conservative R-to-K and K-to-R substitutions can result in the altered properties of either secreted
proteins [32] or the extracellular domains of some plasma

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/72

membrane proteins [33,34], including a member of the
selectin family [35].
Analysis of non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate
ratio in primates
Human-specific modifications with putative functional
consequences may sustain positive selection since the
human-chimpanzee split. The ratio of non-synonymous
(Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution rates was then calculated for each branch on the primate phylogenetic tree
(Fig. 4). Using the branch models, the Ka/Ks value in the
human lineage differed from all other branches with statistical significance (p = 0.027) (Additional file 3). In this
model, the calculated Ka/Ks ratio has an infinite value, as
no synonymous change has accumulated between the
human and the chimpanzee. However, this elevated Ka/
Ks ratio was not statistically >1 (p = 0.371) (Additional
file 3). Using the branch-site tests, model A indicated that
the K75 site might be under positive selection in the
human lineage. However, model A did not differ from the
null hypothesis with statistical significance (p = 0.089)
(Additional figure 3). Overall, positive selection in the
human lineage could not be clearly demonstrated, as the
branch-site analysis did not confirm the data obtained
using the branch models. This may be due either to the
actual absence of any positive selection, or to the lack of
power of the tests due to the low number of genetic variations within SRPX2.
Population genetics analysis
Evidence for positive selection can also be found by analyzing the intra-specific variation in DNA sequences subjected to a selective sweep. DNA sequences adjacent to an
advantageous allele should display lower-than-expected
levels of diversity. The levels of polymorphism and diver0/1 Baboon

gence were estimated by sequencing a total of 9,908 kb of
intronic sequences surrounding exon 4 of SRPX2 in the 24
X-chromosomes mentioned above. Polymorphic sites are
shown in Table 1. Nucleotide diversity at the SRPX2 locus
(π = 0.00036) was 76% of the estimated nucleotide diversity on chromosome X (π = 0.00047) [36]. The divergence
between humans and chimpanzee for SRPX2 (D =
0.0075) was nearly identical to the average divergence calculated for X-linked intronic regions (D = 0.0072) [37].

sian women were tested. Moreover, no polymorphism
had been detected in the 198 unrelated patients previously screened for disease-causing mutations in the coding sequence of SRPX2 [20]. It is also noteworthy that
while no synonymous polymorphism was found in silico,
one non-synonymous variation was detected in silico
[dbSNP:rs17851822]. Although the existence of a rare
DNA variation cannot be ruled out, this change was
detected in one single IMAGE clone only [Genbank:
BC020733; IMAGE:4769946]. This is more likely to correspond to a clone artifact, as we indeed detected a large
proportion of clones carrying artifactual mutations within
SRPX2 inserts, using various Escherichia coli strains
(unpublished data).

The McDonald-Kreitman test [38] that measures the fraction of site under positive selection pressure by comparing
the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence
and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism, was useless in the case of SRPX2 because of the
very few number of inter- and intra-species DNA variations: no synonymous mutation and only one non-synonymous mutation has occurred since the humanchimpanzee split, and neither non-synonymous nor synonymous polymorphisms were detected when 24 human
SRPX2 entire coding sequences from two sub-Saharan
African, three Asian, three Maghrebian, and four Cauca-

The HKA (Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé) test [39] was then
used in order to compare the intra- and inter-specific variations between the SRPX2 locus and control loci assumed
to be under neutral selection, but did not yield significant
results (Table 2). The Tajima's D test was also applied to
the SRPX2 intron data. Tajima's D was clearly negative (D
= -0.646) but did not reach significance (p > 0.05). As in

the case of the ASPM gene that is involved in human brain
expansion [6], the present intra-specific analyses did not
show significant evidence against neutral expectations.
The lack of statistical significance may indicate that no
selective sweep has ever occurred in the human lineage.
However, it should be mentioned that a selective sweep
can be detected by intra-specific studies only for a short
period (< 0.5 N generations, where N is the effective
human population size, i.e. approximately < 100 000–
200 000 years ago) after fixation of the advantageous variant [40,41].

Conclusion
In this study, we have examined the molecular evolution
of the SRPX2 gene that causes brain disorders of the
speech areas. One single, fixed amino acid change (R75K)
occurred in the first sushi domain of SRPX2 after the
human-chimpanzee split. Neither the primate analysis
nor the population genetics separately demonstrated the
existence of positive selection of SRPX2. Whether the single human-specific R75K mutation has sustained positive
selection thus remains an open question. However the 3D location of R75K right within an important functional
domain of the SRPX2 protein, in the immediate vicinity of
a pathogenic mutation, indicates that this evolutionary
mutation may have functional importance. Because R75K
occurred in a domain implicated in protein-protein interactions, it is possible that qualitative or quantitative
changes in the interaction with one or several putative
SRPX2 partners have been modified. Despite the present
lack of any knowledge on either the actual function of
SRPX2 or the proteins it interacts with, it is obvious that
the comparison of the properties of the human and chimpanzee SRPX2 orthologues will help determine in the
future if and how new functions were acquired. From this
viewpoint, our study represents a first important step
towards the analysis of the consequences of R75K on
SRPX2 functioning and protein interactions.

Methods
DNA samples and sequencing
All human and nonhuman primate DNAs were extracted
using standard procedures and according to the appropriate ethical committees and animal' care rules, respectively.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments representing
9,908 kb from introns 3 and 4 were sequenced with specific primers in 12 human females from the major continental populations (two sub-Saharan Africans, four
Europeans, three Asians, and three Maghrebians). Each
exon of the full-length coding region of SRPX2 was amplified by PCR and sequenced in the same 12 women and in
six nonhuman primate species, using inter-specific consensus intronic primers. The nonhuman primates were of
the hominidae, pongidae, hylobatidae, and cercopithecidae families: three chimpanzees (one male and two
females; Pan troglodytes); one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla); one
orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), one gibbon (Hylobates sp.),
one macaque (Macaca mulatta) and one baboon (Papio
sp.). The primer sequences are listed in Additional file 4.
Sequencing was performed using standard dye terminator
chemistry. Sequences were analysed and polymorphisms
detected using the Genalys 3.0 software [42]. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW
program [43].
Modeling analyses
Modeling of the first sushi module of human SRPX2 was
undertaken based upon its closest homologue in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [44,45]: the highest resolved X-ray
structure of the first sushi module of complement receptor
type 2 (PDB ID: 1LY2) [46], which was identified with a
BLAST search [47,48]. The target and template shared
29% sequence identity from N- to C-terminal cysteines.
The program Modeller release 8 version 1 [49] was used.

The alignment between the target and template sequences
was based on an initial multiple sequence alignment of
several individual human sushi-module sequences
assigned to cluster-D (with the addition of template
sequence CR2 module 1), using the program ProbCons

Page 6 of 9

BMC Genetics 2007, 8:72

[50] to help position indels more appropriately (see Additional file 2 for target-template alignment). Cluster-D
members, according to the recently published convention
of sequence assignment [26], are characterized by the
presence of a six-cysteine residue motif, forming three
putative disulfide bridges. The target-template sequence
alignment was subjected to further, minor manual editing
guided by positioning of secondary structure elements
more appropriately between the target and template
sequences; secondary structure was predicted by the server
PsiPred version 2.4 [51,52] for the target sequence, or
identified by DSSP [53] for the template structure. The
additional putative disulfide bridge present in the target
(absent in its corresponding template) was restrained during model building. Twenty-five models were generated,
and the one with the lowest objective function score [49]
selected as the representative model. The loop KGGNY in
the hypervariable loop region of SRPX2, for which CR2template-derived restraints were largely absent was subsequently remodeled under SYBYL version 6.9 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO, USA) after we conducted a loop
search for that region against a high resolution subset of
the PDB, in order to select the best root-mean square fitting matching loop conformation for that region.
Non-identical side-chain residues of the representative
model were optimized using the side-chain replacement
program SCWRL version 3 [54]. The model was then protonated and subjected to energy minimization using the
Tripos forcefield [55] (20 steps steepest descent followed
by 20 steps conjugate gradient) under SYBYL to remove
clashes and bad geometries. The model structure was
finally checked for valid stereochemistry using PROCHECK version 3.5.4 [56].
Evolution data analyses
The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the phylogenomic analysis pipeline available in the FIGENIX [57]
automated genomic annotation platform [58] with the
human SRPX2 protein sequence [Genbank: NP_055282]
as input and the NCBI nr or the Ensembl databases for
BLAST searches (Additional file 1). The synonymous/non
synonymous analyses were conducted in primates assuming the following unrooted tree topology: (Baboon,
Macaque, ((((Chimpanzee, Human), Gorilla), Orangutan), Gibbon)). Ancestral sequences were reconstructed
with the pamp and codeml programs in the PAML package [59,60], using the parsimony method and the maximum likelihood method, respectively. From these data,
the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions and the Ka/Ks ratios were estimated using the
DnaSP 4.0 package [61]. The codeml program from the
PAML 3.15 packages was used to test for positive selection, using the branch models and the branch-site models, as previously described [62,63] (Additional file 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/72

The DnaSP 4.0 program was also used for all population
genetic analyses. Nucleotide diversity (π) and Watterson's
θ were computed as described [64]. The neutral evolution
hypothesis for the SRPX2 intronic polymorphisms was
checked with the HKA (Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé) test
[39], using available data on worldwide polymorphisms
in non-coding reference (neutral) autosomal and X-linked
regions of the human genome (Table 2), as previously
described [16].
