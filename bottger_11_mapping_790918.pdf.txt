Mapping of the minimal inorganic phosphate
transporting unit of human PiT2 suggests a
structure universal to PiT-related proteins from all
kingdoms of life
Pernille Bøttger1,2,4 and Lene Pedersen1,2,3*

Abstract
Background: The inorganic (Pi) phosphate transporter (PiT) family comprises known and putative Na+- or H
+
-dependent Pi-transporting proteins with representatives from all kingdoms. The mammalian members are placed
in the outer cell membranes and suggested to supply cells with Pi to maintain house-keeping functions. Alignment
of protein sequences representing PiT family members from all kingdoms reveals the presence of conserved amino
acids and that bacterial phosphate permeases and putative phosphate permeases from archaea lack substantial parts
of the protein sequence when compared to the mammalian PiT family members. Besides being Na+-dependent Pi
(NaPi) transporters, the mammalian PiT paralogs, PiT1 and PiT2, also are receptors for gamma-retroviruses. We have
here exploited the dual-function of PiT1 and PiT2 to study the structure-function relationship of PiT proteins.
Results: We show that the human PiT2 histidine, H502, and the human PiT1 glutamate, E70, - both conserved in
eukaryotic PiT family members - are critical for Pi transport function. Noticeably, human PiT2 H502 is located in the
C-terminal PiT family signature sequence, and human PiT1 E70 is located in ProDom domains characteristic for all
PiT family members.
A human PiT2 truncation mutant, which consists of the predicted 10 transmembrane (TM) domain backbone
without a large intracellular domain (human PiT2ΔR254-V483), was found to be a fully functional Pi transporter.
Further truncation of the human PiT2 protein by additional removal of two predicted TM domains together with
the large intracellular domain created a mutant that resembles a bacterial phosphate permease and an archaeal
putative phosphate permease. This human PiT2 truncation mutant (human PiT2ΔL183-V483) did also support Pi
transport albeit at very low levels.
Conclusions: The results suggest that the overall structure of the Pi-transporting unit of the PiT family proteins has
remained unchanged during evolution. Moreover, in combination, our studies of the gene structure of the human
PiT1 and PiT2 genes (SLC20A1 and SLC20A2, respectively) and alignment of protein sequences of PiT family
members from all kingdoms, along with the studies of the dual functions of the human PiT paralogs show that
these proteins are excellent as models for studying the evolution of a protein’s structure-function relationship.

Background
Phosphate is needed by any living cell for structural and
metabolic purposes. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) has to be
actively transported across the cell membrane against a
chemical and electrical gradient. In mammalian cells

this task is managed by the type III sodium-dependent
Pi (NaPi) symporters, PiT1 and PiT2, which utilize the
free energy provided by the Na+ concentration gradient
as the driving force for uphill import of Pi[1-3], reviewed
in [4].
The mammalian type III transporters are part of the Pi

retrovirus genus [7-13]; thus, PiT1 and PiT2 are proteins with dual functions. The PiT family also comprises
non-mammalian members, e.g., fungus Pho-4+ (Neurospora crassa (N. crassa)) [14] and yeast Pho89 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)) [15] as well as the
proton (H +)-dependent Pi transporters from bacteria,
PiTA and PiTB (Escherichia coli (E. coli)) [16], and plant
Pht2_1 (Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana)) [17].
Furthermore, there is an increasing number of entries in
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) protein database (URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/) that show similarity to the known members of the
PiT family and therefore are denoted putative phosphate
permeases; and PiT family members have been found in
all kingdoms [18], reviewed in [19]. Altogether, this suggests that the PiT proteins developed very early in evolution and that this family of proteins has important
function(s) in all kingdoms of life.
The first membrane topology model of PiT proteins
was based on Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plots. Analyses
of human PiT1 and Pho-4+ protein sequences predicted
10 transmembrane (TM) domains, 9 loops (here referred
to as L1 to L9) hereof 5 extracellular, internal N- and Cterminal ends, and a large hydrophilic domain (L6)
intracellularly positioned between the putative 6th and
7 th TM domains [20]. Due to profound similarity
(approx. 62% amino acid identity) between the human
PiT paralogs, the same membrane topology model was
proposed to also apply for human PiT2 (Figure 1) [8].
The model was, moreover, supported by the experimental assignment of the large intracellular domain of rat
PiT2 to the cytoplasmic space [21]. Other topology
models have, however, been proposed for PiT1 [22,23]
and PiT2 [24] (Figure 2); please see legend to Figure 2
for more details. Nevertheless, we have shown that
exchanging as little as 12 or 15 amino acids in the fungal PiT protein, Pho-4 + , with human PiT1 or human
PiT2 sequences, respectively, results in proteins that
support infection by human PiT1 or PiT2 cognate
gamma-retroviruses [25,26]; results, which suggest that
these transporters are structurally highly related.
Analyzing human PiT1 and Pho-4+ sequences, Johann
and coworkers discovered an internal sequence repeat,
which they suggested had originated from an ancient
gene duplication [20]. Both regions were shown to harbor a ProDom domain, PD001131 (Figure 1) [27]
(human PiT2 I11-L161 and V492-V640), characteristic for
all members of the PiT family. Interestingly, all amino
acids in human PiT2 (i.e. D28, E55, S113, D506, E575, and
S593) and in human PiT1 (S128 and S621) identified to be
critical for P i transport function are located in these
ProDom domains (Figure 1) [18,27-29]. It should be
noted, that, the ProDom domain PD001131 has changed
and now consists of what corresponds to human PiT2

I53-L127 http://prodom.prabi.fr (Figure 1). In an attempt
to narrow down a PiT family trait, Saier aligned the Nterminal protein sequences from 17 members representing all kingdoms [6,30]. The author noted the existence
of an 11-amino-acid-long sequence in the N-terminal
region containing the conserved core sequence [GANDVANA] and proposed it to be a signature sequence for
the PiT family [6,30]. However, refined studies of the Nand C-termini of 109 protein sequences representing
PiT family members from all kingdoms revealed that
these proteins harbor a 12-amino-acid-long PiT family
signature sequence - with the common core consensus
sequence [GANDVANA] - within each of the PD001131
ProDom domains proposed in 2004 [18]. Furthermore,
D28 and D506 shown to be critical for PiT2 Pi transport
are placed in either of the PiT family signature
sequences [18].
To further investigate the importance of the PiT
family signature sequences, we have analyzed the human
PiT2 histidine, H 502 , located in the C-terminal PiT
family signature sequence, and we show that it is indeed
critical for the Pi transport function but dispensable for
infection by PiT2 cognate gamma-retroviruses. The
human PiT2 H 502 is the second amino acid in this
sequence to be identified as critical for P i transport
function. In addition, we also show that the human
PiT1 glutamate, E70, located in the PD001131 ProDom
domain, is critical for the Pi transport function but dispensable for infection by PiT1 cognate gammaretroviruses.
We have, moreover, combined studies of the gene
structure of the human PiT genes (SLC20A1 and
SLC20A2), alignment and TM domain prediction of protein sequences of PiT family members from all kingdoms of life, and studies of the dual functions of the
human PiT paralogs as Pi transporters and gamma-retroviral receptors, and we found that these proteins are
excellent as models for studying the evolution of protein
structure-function relationship. Specifically based on the
observation that bacterial and archaeal PiT family members are substantially smaller than eukaryotic members
[18] and our alignment (Additional File 1 Figure A), we
analyzed truncation mutants of human PiT2. Our results
clearly show that the large intracellular domain of
human PiT2 is dispensable for P i transport function,
and that a fully functional Pi-transporting unit can be
created by the 10 TM domains and the small loop
sequences connecting them (human PiT2ΔR254-V483). A
further truncated human PiT2 protein with the 5th and
6 th TM domains and the large intracellular domain
removed resembles the structures of as well a putative
phosphate permease from archaea as of PiTA from bacteria (Archaeoglobus fulgidus (A. fulgidus) and E. coli,
respectively). This mutant (human PiT2ΔL183-V483) was

Figure 1 Putative topological model of human PiT2 and mutants. Putative membrane topology model of human PiT2 on which the mutant
proteins investigated in the present paper are based; the model was originally proposed by O’Hara and coworkers [8,20]. The numbers of the
TMs are indicated above the model. Other membrane topology models have been proposed for PiT1 [22,23] and PiT2 [24], which suggested
diverging topology for the two paralogs; the alternative PiT2 model is shown in Figure 2. The amino acids previously identified in human PiT2 as
being critical for Pi transport function are highlighted with black filling and pointed out with arrows; D28, E55, S113, D506, E575, and S593[18,27,28].
In human PiT1, the amino acids S128 (PiT2 S113) and S621 (PiT2 S593) have previously been identified as being critical for PiT1 Pi transport function
[29]. In the present study, human PiT2 H502 (situated in the PiT family signature sequence) and human PiT1 E70 (equivalent in position to human
PiT2 E55) are also identified as critical for Pi transport function (see Figure 3). The grey-filled sequences (L11-L161 and V492-V640), represent the Nand C-terminal, respectively, ProDom domains (PD001131) published in 2004 defining the PiT family members [27]. The dark grey-filed sequence
(I53-L127) represents the most recent ProDom domain defining the PiT family members http://prodom.prabi.fr/.

an excellent gamma-retroviral receptor [31], and we
here show that it can support low levels of Pi transport.
Altogether, these results suggest that the overall structure of the Pi-transporting unit of the PiT family proteins has remained unchanged during evolution.

Methods
Sequence alignment

Protein sequence alignment of nine PiT family members
representing all kingdoms was made using the ClustalW
alignment program version 2.0.12 available at the European Bioinformatics Institute server (URL: http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/clustalw2/) [32]. The Swiss-Prot protein
sequences were retrieved from the NCBI Protein server
(URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/). Accession
numbers are: Homo sapiens (H. sapiens) PiT2 [SwissProt:Q08357], H. sapiens PiT1 [Swiss-Prot:Q08344],
Caenhorabditis elegans (C. elegans) putative phosphate

permease [Swiss-Prot:Q17455], Drosophila melanogaster
(D. melanogaster) putative phosphate permease [SwissProt:Q9VTG0], N. crassa Pho-4+ [Swiss-Prot:P15710],
Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) putative phosphate permease [Swiss-Prot:Q9N930], A. fulgidus putative phosphate permease [Swiss-Prot:O29467], A. thaliana
Pht2_1 [Swiss-Prot:Q38954], and E. coli PiTA [SwissProt:P37308]. All sequences encompass two 12-aminoacid-long sequences, which based on comparison of 109
sequences, were identified in PiT proteins and related
proteins and suggested to be PiT family signature
sequences [18]. We, however, observed that the C-terminal PiT family signature sequence of E. coli PiTA did
not group together with the C-terminal PiT family
signature sequences of the eight other species in the
alignment (data not shown). In order to group all the Cterminal PiT family signature sequences together, the
alignment was adjusted manually after an alignment of

Figure 2 Alternative topological model of human PiT2 and mutants. Membrane topology model for human PiT2 suggested by Salaün and
coworkers [24]; the TMs are shown as grey-filled sequences and their numbers are indicated with roman numbers above the model. This model
shares some similarity to a membrane topology model for PiT1 proposed in 2002 [22]. Based on the cellular location of C-terminal tags, the Cterminal ends of PiT1 and PiT2 were predicted to be extracellular [22,24]. And based on the cellular location of an N-terminal tag on PiT2 and
glycosylation of a site in human PiT1 and partly glycosylation of the same site in human PiT2 although oddly not in hamster PiT2, the N-termini
of PiT1 and PiT2 were suggested to be extracellular [22,24]; due to a suggested additional TM after TM3 in Figure 1 (TMIV in this figure), this did
not influence the orientation of the large intracellular domain in these models compared to the model in Figure 1. The PiT2 model shown in
Figure 1 and this figure, respectively, and the PiT1 model proposed in 2002 [22] were later compared by us [18]. In 2009, Farrell and coworkers
proposed a modified model of human PiT1 based on substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis [23]. The recent model of PiT1 shows more
resemblance to the PiT2 models shown in this figure and in Figure 1 concerning the length and position of the large intracellular domain (L6)
than the model from 2002. The amino acids identified in human PiT2 and human PiT1 as being critical for Pi transport function are highlighted
with black filling and pointed out with arrows; for references see legend to Figure 1. Compared to the PiT2 model in Figure 1, the PiT2 model
proposed by Salaün and coworkers (this figure) and the PiT1 model proposed in 2009 by Farrell and coworkers do not affect the placement of
PiT1 D43 (PiT2 D28), PiT1 E70 (PiT2 E55), PiT1 H530 (PiT2 H502), PiT1 D534 (PiT2 D506), PiT1 E603 (PiT2 E575), and PiT1 S621 (PiT2 S593) in either a TM
domain or a loop sequence [23,24] (compare Figure 1 and this figure). However, PiT1 S128 (PiT2 S113) placed in loop regions in the PiT2 models
(this figure and Figure 1), is in the PiT1 model from 2009 suggested to be placed in a TM domain [23].

H. sapiens PiT2 amino acids S 422 -V 652 [Swiss-Prot:

the PiT family members, see Additional File 1 Figure A.
Prediction of TM domains in the PiT family members and
related proteins

Putative TM domains were predicted using the
TMHMM Server v. 2.0 available at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark (URL: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/),

and the Dense Alignment Surface (DAS) Transmembrane Prediction server available at the Stockholm
Bioinformatics Center, Stockholm University (URL:
http://www.sbc.su.se/~miklos/DAS/). TMHMM is based
on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that is cyclic with
seven types of states for helix core, helix caps on either
side, loop on the cytoplasmic side, two loops for the
non-cytoplasmic side, and a globular domain state in
the middle of each loop [33], and DAS is based on lowstringency dot-plots of the query sequence against a collection of non-homologous membrane proteins using a
previously derived special scoring matrix [34].

Bøttger and Pedersen BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/21

In general, the predictions using both servers correspond well to each other when compared (data not
shown), however, the DAS server tends to predict
shorter TM domains in agreement with the tendency
for prokaryotic TM domains to be shorter in length
when compared to the length of eukaryotic TM
domains [35]. Therefore, we chose to use the DAS server over the TMHMM server when predicting TM
domains in the prokaryotic protein sequences for E. coli
PiTA and A. fulgidus putative phosphate permease. The
predicted TM domains are shown in Additional File 1
Figure A.
Intron-exon border analysis of human PiT genes SLC20A1
and SLC20A2

The SPIDEY mRNA-to-genome DNA alignment program version 1.40 available from the NCBI homepage
(URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/spidey/index.html)
[36] was used to determine the location of intron-exon
borders in the human PiT genes. SPIDEY takes as input
an mRNA sequence and the corresponding genomic
sequence, and it generates an alignment that establishes
the gene structure. The GenBank mRNA sequences
were retrieved from the NCBI nucleotide server (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/). Accession numbers
are: H. sapiens PiT1 mRNA [GenBank:NM_005415] and
H. sapiens PiT2 mRNA [GenBank:NM_006749]. The
genomic GenBank sequences were retrieved from the
NCBI human genome server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/projects/genome/guide/human/). Accession numbers are: H. sapiens chromosome 2 (SLC20A1) [GenBank:NC_000002] and H. sapiens chromosome 8
(SLC20A2) [GenBank:NC_000008]. The intron-exon
borders are shown in Additional File 1 Figure A on the
protein sequence alignment of nine PiT family members.

instructions. A mutation creating E70K as well as a Dra
I restriction enzyme cleavage site was introduced into a
pAlter-1 vector (Promega) harboring the Pst 1 - Hind
III fragment of pOJ75 (the nucleotide sequence encoding the N-terminal part of the human PiT1 protein)
using the primer 5’-GACAGAGCCCACTGTTTTAAAGATGCTAGCTAG-3’. Finally, this construct was
digested with Kpn I and Hind III generating a fragment,
which was used to replace the corresponding fragment
in pOJ75 resulting in the desired plasmid.
The plasmid encoding the human PiT2ΔL 183 -V 483
mutant has previously been described [31]. The plasmid
encoding the human PiT2ΔR254-V483 mutant was made
using a pAlter-1 vector harboring the Pst I - Hind III
fragment of pOJ74 (the nucleotide sequence encoding
the N-terminal part of the human PiT2 protein) as template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the forward primer 5’CTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTTTGTT
TATTTAA3’ and the reverse primer 5’GAGGACCTGGAGGAAATGGAACAGGAGGTGTGATAAAGCACC
TTCTTTTTG3’; the latter primer was used to create
the link between the 5’ sequence encoding KEGALS253
and the 3’ sequence encoding H484LLFH (Figure 1). The
amplification product was digested with Sse 8387 I and
Hind III and used to replace the corresponding fragment in pOJ74 resulting in the desired plasmid.
The authenticities of all the nucleotide sequences were
confirmed.
The plasmids were purified using either cesium chloride (CsCl) according to the protocol described by Maniatis and coworkers [38], or using Nucleobond
(Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) or Qiagen maxiprep
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell cultures

Expression plasmids

The pcDNA1ARtkpA-derived expression plasmids pOJ74
and pOJ75 (Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Pearl River N.Y.,
USA) encoding human PiT2 and PiT1, respectively,
have been described [37].
The plasmid encoding the human PiT2 H502A mutant
was made by using the QuickChange® XL site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Besides the mutations creating H 502 A, the forward primer 5’TTCGGGTCCTTTGCTGCCGGCGGCAATGACGT-3’
and reverse primer 5’-ACGTCATTGCCGCCGGCAGCAAAGGACCCGAA-3’ also generated, by introduction
of a silent mutation, an NgoM IV restriction enzyme
cleavage site in pOJ74, which was used for screening.
The plasmid encoding the human PiT1 E 70 K mutant
was made by using the Altered sites II kit (Promega,
Madison WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s

Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, CHO K1 (ATCC CCL61) and dog osteosarcoma cells, D17 (ATCC CCL-183),
were cultivated as described [37]; Mus dunni tail fibroblasts, MDTF (ATCC CCL-2017) were cultivated in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100IU per mL of penicillin (P), and 100 μg of streptomycin (S) per mL (DMEM/FBS/PS). A-MLV (4070A isolate), 10A1 MLV,
and Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV, SEATO) pseudotypes of the b-galactosidase-encoding transfer vector
G1BgSvN [39] were obtained from the producer cell
lines PA317GBN, PT67GBN, and PG13GBN, respectively [40-42]. PT67GBN was established as described
[28]. All packaging cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) and PS
(D-MEM/NCS/PS). Feline leukemia virus subgroup B
(FeLV-B) vector pseudotypes carrying the G1BgSvN
transfer vector were made essentially as described [43].

Bøttger and Pedersen BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/21

Vectors were harvested as supernatants from confluent
producer cells, and the vector containing supernatants
were filtered (0.45-μm pore size) and stored at -80°C.
Transient transfection and infection assay

Transient transfection-infection assays were performed
essentially as described [37]. Briefly, CHO K1 cells
seeded in 60-mm-diameter dishes at 8 × 104 cells per
dish were transfected with 2 μg per dish of plasmid
DNA encoding human PiT2 (pOJ74), human PiT1
(pOJ75), human PiT2 H 502 A, human PiT1 E 70 K, or
equimolar amounts to human PiT2 of human
PiT2ΔR254-V483 or human PiT2ΔL183-V483. Mock treated cells were transfected with empty vector DNA
(pcDNA1ARtkpA). Three independent precipitates were
made per construct. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
approx. 4 to 8 × 104 10A1 MLV or A-MLV pseudotypes
carrying the G1BgSvN transfer vector were added per
dish in the presence of Polybrene. Forty-eight hours
later, the dishes were stained and evaluated. Infection
was analyzed by counting the number of b-galactosidase-positive (infected) cells per dish. Analyses for
FeLV-B and GALV receptor functions were performed
on MDTF cells using 1.5 × 104 cells and approx. 1.5 to
3.0 × 104 vector pseudotypes per dish. Numbers of vector pseudotypes used in the experiments were calculated
from the number of b-galactosidase-positive colonies
per mL obtained on D17 cells as described [37].

Pi transport assay

Female Xenopus laevis (X. laevis) frogs were obtained
from Nasco (Nasco, Modesto CA, USA) and kept and
handled according to guidelines from the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate. Oocytes were isolated
from frogs anesthetized in a 0.1-0.2% MS.222 (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester) (Sigma, St. Louis MO, USA)
solution for 10-30 minutes. A 1-1.5 centimeters incision
was made in the abdomen and several ovaries were
removed surgically by authorized personnel. The oocytes
were manually dissected and subsequently collagenase
(Sigma, St. Louis MO, USA) treated and maintained in
modified Barth’s solution [88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl,
0.82 mM MgSO4, 0.4 mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2,
2.4 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 IU
per mL penicillin, 100 μg per mL streptomycin] at 18°C
as described [28]. The following day, the oocytes were
used for cRNA injection and subsequent analyses of 32Pi
uptake essentially as described previously [28]. Briefly,
cRNAs were prepared from Apa 1 (Figure 3A) or Bln 1
(Figures 3B and 6) linearized plasmid preparations
applying the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion,
Austin TX, USA). Stage V-VI oocytes were microinjected with 12.5 ng of cRNA (or H2O as negative control) and incubated at 18°C. After two to three days, the

Page 6 of 16

oocytes were washed in phosphate-free uptake solution
[100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,
10 mM HEPES-Tris pH 7.5], and hereafter incubated in
uptake solution containing 0.1 mM KH232PO4 (2 mCi
per mL, New England Nuclear, Boston MA, USA) at RT
for 1 hour. The oocytes were washed in ice-cold uptake
solution containing 5 mM KH2PO4 and the 32Pi uptake
of each oocyte measured in a liquid scintillation counter
as described previously [28]. It should be noted that factors coupled to the health and husbandry of the female
X. laevis frogs can influence the oocyte batches. These
factors include nutrition, season of the year (light cycle),
water temperature, salinity and hardness of the water,
water contaminants or toxins, and diseases [44], and the
impact is that different batches of oocytes injected with
cRNAs encoding the same proteins exhibit different
average transport capacities.
Statistical analysis

The null hypothesis that two mean values are identical
was tested by a two-tailed Student’s t-test. The test
compares the actual difference between two mean values
in relation to the variation in the data (expressed as the
standard error of the difference between the mean
values). The null hypothesis was rejected, e.g., the mean
values were considered different when P<0.05.

Results and discussion
Human PiT1 E70 and human PiT2 H502 are critical for Pi
transport function but dispensable for gamma-retroviral
receptor function

In a former study, we identified the putative 2 nd -TM
domain-positioned human PiT2 E55 as being critical for
PiT2 Pi transport function (Figure 1) [28]. The human
PiT2 paralog, human PiT1, harbors a corresponding glutamate in position 70, E70. To investigate whether this
conserved residue was important for PiT1 Pi transport
function, it was mutated to a lysine generating the
mutant human PiT1 E70K. In the experiment shown in
Figure 3A, oocytes injected with cRNA encoding human
PiT1 supported a 32 P i uptake of 119.86 ±28.16 pmol/
oocyte-hour at pH 7.5 in agreement with previous
results obtained addressing the Na32Pi uptake function
of human PiT1 in X. laevis oocytes [45]. The Pi transport function of human PiT1 E 70 K was severely
impaired when compared to that of wildtype PiT1 (P =
0.002, 2.78 ±0.74 pmol/oocyte-hour (PiT1 E70K)) (Figure
3A); see Additional File 2 for data and statistics to
Figure 3.
Besides being Pi-transporting proteins, the mammalian
PiT proteins also serve as gamma-retroviral receptors,
and this dual-function allows for analyzing whether a
mutated PiT protein is properly processed, folded and
translocated to the cell surface [18,28]. The human PiT1

Figure 3 Analysis of human PiT1 E70K and PiT2 H502A for Na32Pi uptake and gamma-retroviral receptor function. A-B X. laevis oocytes
were injected with H2O (Mock) or cRNA of the indicated constructs. Three days later, a 32Pi uptake assay was performed and the 32Pi uptake in
individual oocytes was measured. Data are the mean value of (n) numbers of oocytes ±SEM, see Additional File 2 for data and statistics.
Experiments A and B were made independently of each other, and the experiments were repeated and similar results obtained. C CHO K1 cells
were transfected with CsCl-purified PiT1- or PiT1 E70K-encoding plasmid or empty vector DNA (Mock). Three independent precipitates were
made for each construct. Forty-eight hours after transfection, approx. 8 × 104 10A1 MLV pseudotypes were added per dish. The average
numbers (±SEM) of blue (infected) cells per dish from three dishes receiving independent precipitates are shown, see Additional File 2 for data
and statistics. D-E were made in parallel using the same protocol as in (C) with the exception that Nucleobond-purified plasmids encoding PiT2,
PiT2 H502A, or empty vector DNA were used. The dishes were challenged with approx. 4 × 104 10A1 MLV pseudotypes (D) or A-MLV
pseudotypes (E). The average numbers (±SEM) of blue (infected) cells per dish from three dishes receiving independent precipitates are shown,
see Additional File 2 for data and statistics.

E70K mutant was therefore analyzed for gamma-retroviral receptor function using a transient transfectioninfection assay [37]. For the infection assay, retroviral
vectors harboring a b-galactosidase encoding transfer
vector and carrying viral surface proteins responsible for
receptor recognition were used; vectors carrying, e.g.,
10A1 MLV surface proteins are referred to as 10A1
MLV vector pseudotypes. Eukaryotic expression

plasmids encoding human PiT1 and human PiT1 E70K
mutant protein were transfected into CHO K1 cells
non-permissive for infection by 10A1 MLV vector pseudotypes (Figure 3C) [28]. The abilities of these proteins
to support infection by 10A1 MLV vector pseudotypes
were analyzed; the infection levels were evaluated as the
number of b-galactosidase positive (blue) cells per 60mm-diameter dish. CHO K1 cells expressing human

Bøttger and Pedersen BMC Biochemistry 2011, 12:21
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/12/21

PiT1 were permissive for infection by 10A1 MLV vector
pseudotypes (Figure 3C) in agreement with PiT1’s welldescribed receptor function for 10A1 MLV [10]. Moreover, the human PiT1 E70K mutant supported wildtype
PiT1 levels of 10A1 MLV infection (884 ±146 blue cells
per dish (PiT1), 767 ±42 blue cells per dish (PiT1 E70K),
P = 0.48) (Figure 3C). Besides being a receptor for 10A1
MLV, PiT1 is also a receptor for GALV [7] and for
FeLV-B [13]. The human PiT1 E70K protein was analyzed in parallel for receptor function for vector psedotypes of these two viruses in non-permissive Mus dunni
tail fibroblasts and found to sustain wildtype PiT1 infection levels of GALV (2087 ±780 blue cells per dish
(PiT1), 1992 ±273 blue cells per dish (PiT1 E70K), P =
0.91) and FeLV-B (1424 ±346 blue cells per dish (PiT1),
1715 ±527 blue cells per dish (PiT1 E 70 K), P = 0.67).
The wildtype receptor functions of PiT1 E70K confirm
that the overall membrane topology is preserved and
that the processing to the cell surface was unaffected by
the E70K-mutation.
The glutamate E 70 in human PiT1 is conserved in
eukaryotic PiT family members as are the other two
human PiT1 residues (S128 and S621) (Additional File 1
Figure A) previously shown to be critical for Pi transport
function [29]. Since the corresponding glutamate and
serine residues in human PiT2 have already been identified as being critical for Pi transport function [27,28],
this demonstrate that equivalent glutamate or serine
residues in the human PiT paralogs both are critical for
their Pi transport functions. These observations illustrate
that it is highly likely that the other conserved amino
acids identified in human PiT2 as being critical for Pi
transport function also are important for the transport
function of human PiT1 and other PiT family members.
The histidine residue, human PiT2 H502 is positioned
in the 7th TM domain according to the Johann topology
model (Figure 1) [20]. It is, moreover, located in the Cterminal PiT family signature sequence and conserved
in eukaryotic PiT family members [18] (Additional File
1 Figure A). Moreover, analysis of 60 sequences of bacterial PiT family members revealed only 5 sequences
without the histidine residue illustrating that this residue
is also highly preserved in the C-terminal PiT family signature sequence of PiT family members belonging to
this kingdom [18] (Additional File 1 Figure A). Since the
conserved aspartic acid in the C-terminal PiT family signature sequence, that is human PiT2 D506, is critical for
P i transport of PiT2 [18], we hypothesized that other
conserved amino acids in this motif might be critically
involved in P i transport function of human PiT2 and
other members of the PiT family as well. Mutation of
human PiT2 H502 to alanine created the mutant denoted
PiT2 H502A. This mutant was analyzed for 32Pi transport
function in X. laevis oocytes (Figure 3B) and 10A1 MLV

Page 8 of 16

and A-MLV receptor functions in CHO K1 cells (Figures 3D-E).
In the experiment shown in Figure 3B, oocytes
injected with cRNA encoding human PiT2 supported a
32
Pi uptake of 44.96 ±0.46 pmol/oocyte-hour at pH 7.5
in agreement with former studies addressing the Na32Pi
uptake function of human PiT2 in X. laevis oocytes
[18,28,45]. The Pi transport function of human PiT2
H502A was severely impaired when compared to that of
wildtype PiT2 (P = 0.002, 2.36 ±0.56 pmol/oocyte-hour
(PiT2 H502A)) (Figure 3B).
To analyze whether the human PiT2 H502A mutant is
properly folded and processed to the cell surface, it was
also analyzed for gamma-retroviral receptor function
using the transient transfection-infection assay [37].
Eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding human PiT2
and human PiT2 H502A mutant protein were transfected
into CHO K1 cells non-permissive for infection by AMLV and 10A1 MLV vector pseudotypes (Figures 3D-E)
[28,37]. CHO K1 cells expressing human PiT2 were permissive for infection by both A-MLV and 10A1 MLV
vector pseudotypes (Figures 3D-E) in agreement with
PiT2’s well-described receptor function for A-MLV and
10A1 MLV [8,10,37]. Moreover, the human PiT2 H502A
mutant supported wildtype PiT2 levels of 10A1 MLV
infection (63,940 ±8076 blue cells per dish (PiT2), 50,408
±4005 blue cells per dish (PiT2 H502A), P = 0.23) (Figure
3D) and A-MLV infection (13,624 ±862 blue cells per
dish (PiT2), 12,235 ±1189 blue cells per dish (PiT2
H502A), P = 0.48) (Figure 3E). These results demonstrate
that the overall membrane topology of human PiT2
H 502 A is preserved, and that the processing of human
PiT2 H502A to the membrane surface is unaffected by the
mutation. Thus, histidine 502 in the 7th TM domain is
the second amino acid - besides D506 - in the C-terminal
PiT family signature sequence [HGANDVQNAIGP],
which has been shown to be essential for human PiT2 Pi
transport function. While the exact role of the histidine
residue in the C-terminal signature sequence still needs
to be revealed, its critical role for human PiT2 Pi transport function emphasizes the importance of the C-terminal PiT family signature sequence in the physiological
function of the PiT proteins.
Besides human PiT1 E 70 and human PiT2 H 502 , six
conserved amino acids in human PiT2 and two corresponding positions in human PiT1 have previously been
identified as being critical for P i transport function
[18,27-29]. All these amino acids are located in the ProDom domains (PD001131) suggested in 2004 to define
members of the PiT family (Figure 1) [27]. Therefore it
is likely that sequences outside these two domains
might be dispensable for the Pi transport function of the
PiT proteins, and that a minimal Pi-transporting unit of
the PiT proteins can be identified.

Alignment of protein sequences of PiT family members
from all kingdoms

A previously published alignment of human PiT1 and
human PiT2 protein sequences shows that the L6 loop the large intracellular domain - is the region where
these sequences diverge the most [8] (Additional File 1
Figure A). Moreover, alignment of human PiT1 and N.
crassa Pho-4+ shows that the large intracellular domain
(L6) is smaller in Pho-4+, whereas the rest of the Pho-4+
protein sequence aligns well with the protein sequence
of human PiT1 [20] (Additional File 1 Figure A). To
further address this, we counted the number of amino
acids in the large intracellular domain (L6) of nine different PiT family members and plotted the lengths
according to their phylogenetic relationship in Figure
4A. The figure shows that PiT family members from
archaea and bacteria harbor the shortest L6 loops
whereas the PiT-proteins from chordates harbor the
longest L6 loops (Figure 4A, see also Additional File 1

Figure A). Note that the L6 loop of the C. elegans putative phosphate permease is unexpectedly short (73
amino acids), and according to the plot we would have
expected a L6 loop length for this protein in the interval
between 175 and 232 amino acids (Figure 4A). The
observed differences in the L6 loop lengths of PiT family
members from different species thus suggest that the L6
loop evolved from being a regular loop to become a regular domain during evolution. In order to address this
issue, we counted the number of amino acids in all
loops (L1 to L9) in the nine PiT family members and
plotted the average loop lengths ±SEM in Figure 4B.
The figure shows that the L6 loop in average is much
larger than all other loops (L6: >131.7 ±32.8 amino
acids, Figure 4B); see Additional File 2 for data to Figure
4B. The figure also shows that the variation in the L7
loop lengths is substantial (42.9 ±14.7 amino acids), see
Figure 4B legend for discussion. Thus, with 95% confidence the longest regular loop is the L3 loop with a

family members; see alignment in and legend to Additional File 1 Figure A (AF 1 A). The maximum limit of a loop length (42 amino acids)
estimated in Figure 4B is indicated on the figure. It illustrates that loop lengths at 1 to 42 amino acids define a loop sequence and loop lengths

amino acids given with 95% confidence (38.6 ±3.4 amino acids ~ 35 to 42 amino acids). Note that the 95% confidence interval for L7 is 42.9
±28.8 amino acids, illustrating that this loop length is subjected to high uncertainty because of an unusually long L7 in E. coli PiTA. The 95%
confidence interval for L7 calculated when excluding L7 E. coli PiTA is 28.3 ±2.4 amino acids. The topology model indicates the positions of L1
to L9; stippled loops indicate the observed variable lengths of L6 (the large intracellular domain).

maximum length of 42 amino acids, see legend to Figure
4B for discussion. The definition of the maximum
length of a loop also has the impact that the L7 of E.
coli PiTA consisting of 160 amino acids (Additional File
1 Figure A) has to be considered a domain. In summary,
analysis of the sizes of the loop sequences L1 to L9 in
nine PiT family members from all kingdoms led to the
determination of a limit of maximum 42 amino acids in
a regular loop sequence - and sequences longer than 42
amino acids are highly likely domains. In support of our
calculations of the maximum loop length for PiT-proteins is a previous study of 243 transmembrane domaincontaining sequences, with 146 sequences being multitransmembrane spanning, showing that ~90% of the
loops are shorter than 40 amino acid residues [46].
Another study supporting our finding is the analysis of
loops in 79 existing 3D structures of transmembrane
proteins showing that the majority of loops connecting
transmembrane domains are shorter than 50 amino acid
residues [47].
The proteins in Figure 4A with L6 loop sizes smaller
than 42 amino acids are the archaeal putative phosphate
permease and the bacterial PiTA protein, implying that
single cell organisms without nuclei that rarely harbor
membrane-bound organelles cope without the large
intracellular domain, whereas single cell animals (protozoan’s) with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles
have distinct L6 domains as shown for the T. brucei
putative phosphate permease (Figure 4A). Altogether
this suggest a role(s) for the large intracellular domain,
which is not directly related to Pi transport per se, and
it also suggest that the large intracellular domain (L6)
may have increased in length during the evolution from
archaea to chordata as a consequence of adaptation to
more complex environments.
Besides a difference in the lengths of L6, a difference
in the number of TM domains in the PiT family members was observed (Additional File 1 Figures A and B).
The illustration of TM domain conservedness (black
boxes) and TM domains, which are suggested by us to
be present but not predicted by protein sequence analysis using the TMHMM server (red boxes, see argumentation in legend to Additional File 1 Figure A),
shows the following conservedness of TMs: TM 4, TM
8, TM 10 (fully conserved) > TM 5, TM 6 (fully conserved in eukaryotes) > TM 1, TM 2, TM 3 > TM 9 >
TM 7 (least conserved) (Additional File 1 Figure B).
The most prominent observation is that E. coli PiTA
and A. fulgidus putative phosphate permease both lack
the 5th and 6th TM domains (Additional File 1 Figures
A and B). This in addition to the previous observation
that these two proteins also lack the L6 domain (Figure 4A), suggest that the 5th and 6th TM domains and

Page 10 of 16

the L6 domain are dispensable for P i transport function, and that a basic P i -transporting unit of the PiT
family members can be identified. This unit would
consist of regions flanking the large intracellular
domain (L6) but highly likely also be devoid of the 5th
and 6th TM domains. Interestingly, in support of this
theory, drawing of the putative topology models for
human PiT2, E. coli PiTA, and A. fulgidus putative
phosphate permease based on the alignment in Additional File 1 Figure A, shows that the bacterial and
archaeal proteins have a predicted eight TM backbone
where the N-terminal PiT-family signature sequence is
placed in the 1 st extracellular loop (L1) and the Cterminal PiT family signature sequence is placed in the
3rd extracellular loop (L7) (Figure 5). In comparison, the
drawing of the putative topology model for human PiT2
shows a backbone of 10 TM domains where the Nterminal and C-terminal PiT-family signature sequences
are placed in the 1st extracellular loop (L1) and the 4th
extracellular loop (L7), respectively (Figure 5). An interpretation of these drawings could be that the intraprotein locations of the N-terminal and C-terminal
PiT-family signature sequences are of importance, and
that TM 1 to TM 4 and TM 7 to TM 10 constitute a
core sustaining the P i -transporting function whereas
TM 5 and TM 6 and the large intracellular domain (L6)
constitute a regulatory unit. Finally, the amino acids
identified as being critical for Pi transport function are
located in the ProDom domains suggested in 2004 (TM
1 to TM 4 and TM 7 to TM 10) [27] (Figure 1) in agreement with the 5 th and 6 th TM domains and the large
intracellular domain (L6) might be dispensable for the
Pi transport function.
Design of human PiT2 truncation mutants

To identify the minimal Pi-transporting unit, two human
PiT2 truncation mutants were analyzed. They were
designed to address the Pi transport function and the
gamma-retroviral receptor functions of: 1) A human
PiT2 mutant protein, which consists of the 10 TM
domains and a L6 loop of 18 amino acids (human PiT2
P236-S253) creating the mutant human PiT2ΔR254-V483.
The human PiT2ΔR254-V483 mutant does not resemble a
naturally occurring homolog found in lower species, and
it is merely designed to address if the large intracellular
domain is dispensable for Na + -dependent P i -uptake
(Figure 1), and 2) A human PiT2 mutant protein that
resembles an archaeal and bacterial homolog with
respect to protein composition, i.e., lacking the 5th and
6 th TM domains and the large intracellular domain
(L 183 -V 483 ) (human PiT2ΔL 183 -V 483 ) (Figure 1). Note
that in the Salaün model the 5th and 6th TM domains
correspond to TMVI and TMVII (Figure 2).

mutants PiT2ΔL183-V483 and PiT2ΔR254-V483 (Figure 1)
were analyzed in X. laevis oocytes (Figure 6).
Oocytes injected with cRNA encoding human PiT2
supported a 32P i uptake of 79.61 ±17.74 pmol/oocytehour (Figure 6A) and 44.96 ±0.46 pmol/oocyte-hour
(Figure 6B) at pH 7.5 in agreement with previous results
[18,28,45].
The 32Pi transport activities of the PiT2 mutant lacking
the major part of the large intracellular domain, human
PiT2ΔR254-V483, (47.38 ±6.59 pmol/oocyte-hour (Figure
6A) and 38.74 ±3.73 pmol/oocyte-hour (Figure 6B)) were
indistinguishable from those of PiT2 (P = 0.119) (Figure
6A) and P = 0.553 (Figure 6B)); see Additional File 2 for
data and statistics to Figure 6. Thus, the large intracellular domain of human PiT2 but 18 amino acids (fragment
R254-V483) is dispensable for its Pi transport function.
The 32Pi transport activity of the human PiT2 mutant

Viral receptor function of mutant PiT2 proteins

Using the transient transfection-infection assay, we analyzed whether the deletions in human PiT2 affected
their viral receptor functions for A-MLV and 10A1
MLV. Eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding human
PiT2 and the mutant proteins were transfected into
CHO K1 cells. As expected, human PiT2 transfected
cells were permissive for infection by both 10A1 MLV
and A-MLV vector pseudotypes (Table 1). While the
human PiT2 truncation mutant lacking the large intracellular domain, human PiT2ΔR254-V483 (Figure 1) was
a fully functional Pi transporter (Figure 6), it only supported low levels of PiT2 cognate gamma-retroviral
infection (Table 1). Note that human PiT2ΔR 254-V483
was tested once for A-MLV receptor function and twice
for 10A1 MLV receptor function. The A-MLV study
was done in parallel to a 10A1 MLV receptor function
study using the same set of plasmid precipitates. Interestingly, the human PiT2 truncation mutant lacking the
5th and 6th TM domains in addition to the large intracellular domain, human PiT2ΔL183-V483 (Figure 1), supported substantial levels of PiT2 cognate gammaretroviral infection (Table 1) [31] showing that its low
levels of Pi transport function were not due to incorrect
processing of this mutant to the cell surface.
PiT2 regions directly involved in receptor function for
10A1 MLV and A-MLV have also been identified by
expression of chimeric proteins in CHO K1 cells and
were found to be located in the putative extracellular

loops 2 (L3) and 4 (L7) (Figure 1) [26,37,48,49]. Both of
the human PiT2 mutants, PiT2ΔR 254 -V 483 and
PiT2ΔL183-V483, harbor extracellular loops 2 (L3) and 4
(L7) according to the Johann PiT2 model (Figure 1).
Based on their - here identified - Pi transport abilities, it
is unlikely that PiT2ΔR254-V483 is less expressed at the
cell surface than PiT2ΔL183-V483, and the observation
that the less truncated human PiT2 mutant protein is a
worse gamma-retroviral receptor than a more heavily
truncated human PiT2 mutant protein might instead
reflect a disturbance of the folding and/or conformation
of the extracellular loops 2 (L3) and 4 (L7) due to the
sole presence of the extracellular loop 3 (L5) without
the large intracellular domain in PiT2ΔR254-V483.
Intron-exon borders of the human PiT genes SLC20A1 and
SLC20A2

The human PiT proteins are encoded by genes that
localize to different chromosomes. The human gene,
SLC20A1, encoding the PiT1 protein is located on chromosome 2 at position q13 [50,51], and the human gene,
SLC20A2, encoding the PiT2 protein is located on chromosome 8 at position p11.2 [8,52,53].
To analyze the gene structure of SLC20A1 and
SLC20A2, the intron-exon borders in each of the genes
were determined using the SPIDEY mRNA-to-genome
DNA alignment as described in “Methods”. The intronexon borders are marked with stars (✰) and vertical
lines in the PiT1 and PiT2 protein sequences in the
alignment of nine PiT family members in Additional
File 1 Figure A.
Eight out of nine intron-exon borders (labeled ✰ a to
e and ✰ g to i on PiT1 and PiT2 in Additional File 1

homologous. One intron-exon border (labeled ✰ f 1
(SLC20A2) and f2 (SLC20A1)) are displaced giving a gap

corresponding to 12 amino acids (~36 nucleotides).
These two borders are placed in the middle of the genome sequences, which encode the large intracellular
domain (L6) of the human PiT proteins. As seen from
Additional File 1 Figure A, the alignment between the
human PiT proteins in this region is poor and the gap
highly likely reflects this, and not a significant difference
in intron-exon structure between SLC20A1 and
SLC20A2.
Interestingly, in support of the theory that the 5th and
th
6 TM domains can be dispensable for P i transport
function, is the observation that these TM domains are
encoded by two different exons, see Additional File 1
Figure A (✰ labeled c to d, and ✰ labeled d to e), and
therefore the possibility exists that the sequences in
these two exons have entered later in evolution.
Specialized functions of the mammalian PiT proteins

Mammalian PiT proteins are expressed in all tissues
investigated and due to their broad expression profiles,
they have been suggested to accommodate house-keeping functions, i.e., supplying cells with Pi to maintain
basic cellular functions [2,20,54]. However, in recent
years additional specialized functions of the PiT proteins
have been reported. These include roles for PiT2 in
proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption [55], and for
PiT1 in regulation of parathyroid gland PTH production
[56,57], cell proliferation [29,58,59], and in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced apoptosis [60]. Recent studies
also indicate that both the PiT proteins function as Pi
sensors [27,56], reviewed in [61]. Interestingly, some of
these functions, that is, PiT2’s suggested role in Pi sensing [27] and PiT1’s role in cell proliferation and TNFinduced apoptosis [29,59,60] have been shown to be
independent of the P i transport functions of the
proteins.
PiT1 has also been implicated in normal chondroblastic and osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization
processes [62-66], as well as trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells to cells with characteristics of
chondro-/osteoblasts in the pathologic process of vascular calcification at hyperphosphatemia [67]. More rodent
in vivo models have been used to study the role of PiT1
in normal bone formation and/or embryonic development. Rats with transgenic overexpression of PiT1
showed no major bone deformity during skeletal development [57]. However, these rats displayed a slight but
significant decrease in the bone mineral content of the
whole skeleton together with a reduction albeit non-significant in the total bone area [57]. The role of PiT1
during embryonic mouse development has been studied
by two different groups employing early conditional
excision of SLC20A1 Exons 3-4 [68] and SLC20A1 Exon
5 [59], which resulted in homozygous embryonic

Page 13 of 16

lethality. Both studies find that the embryos are anemic
and do not survive past E12.5, at which stage the morphology shows reduced growth [59,68]; the anemia was
found to be due to severe defects in liver development
[59]. Comparison of wildtype mice to mice with low
(15%) expression of PiT1 mRNA showed that some of
the latter mice displayed impaired bone mineralization
at birth, while 15-days old mice showed no major differences in mineralization [59]. Interestingly, in embryos
(E11.5) lacking PiT1 expression Beck and coworkers
found an upregulated PiT2 expression, which however
could not rescue the embryos past E12.5, and the
authors therefore suggest that the critical non-redundant
role of PiT1 in development is not Pi-uptake [59]. Altogether, the in vivo studies do not exclude a role for
PiT1 in normal bone formation, although they imply
that PiT1 is not critical for the early skeletal developmental processes.
The alignment and analyses of exon structure together
with the observed P i transport functions of the PiT2
deletion mutants presented here might suggest that the
regions of the PiT proteins involved in the Pi-transport
independent functions map to sequences in the 5th and
6 th TM domains and/or in the large intracellular
domain. In line with this, we are currently investigating
the function of the large intracellular domain of the
human PiT2 protein and our results support the
hypothesis that the large intracellular domain has other
functions than Pi transport.

Conclusions
Investigation of the Pi transport and retroviral receptor
functions of the human PiT proteins has allowed for
identification of a histidine residue (human PiT2 H502)
in the C-terminal PiT family signature sequence as
being critically involved in Pi transport function. Moreover, we show that a PiT1 glutamate residue (human
PiT1 E 70) positioned in the 2nd TM domain is critical
for Pi transport function in agreement with the former
identification of the equivalent glutamate in human
PiT2 (human PiT2 E55) as being critical for Pi transport
function [28].
We have shown that a human PiT2 mutant consisting
of the 10 TM domains and minor loops (human
PiT2ΔR254-V483) transports Pi as wildtype PiT2, proving
that the large intracellular domain (L6) is dispensable
for P i transport function. A further truncated human
PiT2 mutant consisting of the 1 st to 4th TM domains
linked to the 7 th to 10 th TM domains and the minor
loop sequences connecting the TMs (human PiT2ΔL183V 483 ), and which resembles archaeal and bacterial
homologs, sustained low levels of Pi transport. This protein harbors the ProDom domains defining the PiT
family members and, moreover, harbors all the amino

acids so far identified as being critical for Pi transport
function.
The above results showing that truncated human PiT2
mutant proteins - one of which resembles a phosphate
permease from bacteria and a putative phosphate permease from archaea - support Pi transport, point to the
conclusion that the overall structure of the PiT family
proteins has remained unchanged during evolution and
that a basic Pi-transporting unit exists.

sequences, which we based on either too small length to comprise a TM
or due to suggested extracellular position (see above) found were noncompatible with regular TM domains; however, these sequences might
instead “dip” into the membrane lipid bilayer. It should be noted that
these sequences are counted as being part of the loop sequences in
Figure 4. A star (✰) (labeled a to i) and a vertical line indicate the
position of an intron-exon border in each of the human PiT genes
determined by use of the SPIDEY mRNA-to-genome DNA alignment as
described in “Methods”. Below the alignment, the names, species, phylas,
kingdoms, Swiss-Prot accession numbers, and the amino acid lengths of
the nine proteins are given. B The server-predicted TM domains (black
boxes) and the by us suggested TM domains (red boxes) for each of the
nine PiT family members are depicted in order to illustrate the
conservedness of the TM domains: TM 4, TM 8, TM 10 (fully conserved) >
TM 5, TM 6 (fully conserved in eukaryotes) > TM 1, TM 2, TM 3 > TM 9 >
TM 7 (least conserved). The white asterisk indicates a prediction of a
unique TM domain in the unusually long N-terminal sequence of A.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Protein sequence alignment of nine PiT family
members from all kingdoms. A The 10 putative TM domains according
to the Johann topology model are shown on the human PiT2 sequence
using black boxes with white filling [8,20]; the putative large intracellular
domain (L6) of human PiT2, according to this model, spans the amino
acid sequence: P236-V483. The N-terminal and C-terminal PiT family
signature sequences [18] are shown on the alignment in black boxes
with grey filling. Human PiT1 E70 in the 2nd TM domain and human PiT2
H502 in the 7th TM domain are indicated with circles. The TMHMMpredicted TM domains of the eukaryotic protein sequences for PiT family
members and the DAS-predicted TM domains of the prokaryotic protein
sequences for PiT family members are shown in black bold. The red bold
sequences represent TM-domains, which we suggest exist, however, they
were not predicted by the servers: N. crassa Pho-4+ TM 1 (sequence Q5I24) is suggested to be homologous to the TM 1 predicted in the C.
elegans putative phosphate permease protein sequence. The presence of
Pho-4+ TM 1 is also based on the assumption that the N-terminal PiTfamily signature sequences should be placed equivalently (extracellularly
in L1) in all PiT family members. A. thaliana Pht2_1 TM 2 (sequence A187G211) is suggested to be homologous to the TM 2 predicted in the T.
brucei putative phosphate permease protein sequence. The presence of
Pht2_1 TM 2 is also based on experimental assignment of the L6 for rat
PiT2 to the cytoplasmic space [21], and Pht2_1 therefore requires a TM 2
to fulfill this criteria. H. sapiens PiT2 TM 3 (sequence T83-A105) is
suggested to be homologous to the TM 3 predicted in the H. sapiens
PiT1 protein sequence. Investigation of a human PiT1/PiT2 chimera
where the PiT1 backbone harbors the human PiT2 sequence G120-V141
showed that this sequence conferred A-MLV receptor function upon
human PiT1 [48], and the G120-V141 sequence is therefore highly likely
extracellular in both human PiT paralogs and this requires the presence
of TM 3 in human PiT2. TM 7 domains in putative phosphate permeases
from C. elegans (sequence Q330-A349), D. melanogaster (sequence M472G491), T. brucei (sequence Y346-A365), and N. crassa Pho-4+ (sequence Y318A337) are suggested to be homologous to the TM 7 predicted in H.
sapiens PiT2 and PiT1 sequences. The presence of TM 7 in putative
phosphate permeases from C. elegans, D. melanogaster, T. brucei, and N.
crassa Pho-4+ is also based on the assumption that the C-terminal PiTfamily signature sequences should be placed equivalently (extracellularly
in L7) in all PiT family members. Moreover, investigation of a Pho-4
+
/human PiT2 chimera where the Pho-4+ backbone harbors the human
PiT2 sequences C117-I143 (stretch in L3) and L512-A531 (stretch in L7)
showed that these sequences confer A-MLV receptor function upon Pho4+[26], and these sequences are therefore highly likely extracellular and
this requires the presence of a TM 7. Similarly, investigation of a Pho-4
+
/human PiT1 chimera where the Pho-4+ backbone harbors the human
PiT1 sequence L545-S556 (stretch in L7) showed that these sequences
confer GALV receptor function upon Pho-4+[25]. H. sapiens PiT2 TM 9
