Comprehensive expression analysis suggests
overlapping and specific roles of rice glutathione
S-transferase genes during development and
stress responses
Mukesh Jain*, Challa Ghanashyam, Annapurna Bhattacharjee

Abstract
Background: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are the ubiquitous enzymes that play a key role in cellular
detoxification. Although several GSTs have been identified and characterized in various plant species, the
knowledge about their role in developmental processes and response to various stimuli is still very limited. In this
study, we report genome-wide identification, characterization and comprehensive expression analysis of members
of GST gene family in crop plant rice, to reveal their function(s).
Results: A systematic analysis revealed the presence of at least 79 GST genes in the rice genome. Phylogenetic
analysis grouped GST proteins into seven classes. Sequence analysis together with the organization of putative
motifs indicated the potential diverse functions of GST gene family members in rice. The tandem gene
duplications have contributed a major role in expansion of this gene family. Microarray data analysis revealed
tissue-/organ- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns of several rice GST genes. At least 31 GST
genes showed response to plant hormones auxin and cytokinin. Furthermore, expression analysis showed the
differential expression of quite a large number of GST genes during various abiotic stress (20), arsenate stress (32)
and biotic stress (48) conditions. Many of the GST genes were commonly regulated by developmental processes,
hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses.
Conclusion: The transcript profiling suggests overlapping and specific role(s) of GSTs during various stages of
development in rice. Further, the study provides evidence for the role of GSTs in mediating crosstalk between
various stress and hormone response pathways and represents a very useful resource for functional analysis of
selected members of this family in rice.

Background
Glutathione transferases (GSTs, EC 2.5.1.18), formerly
known as glutathione S-transferases, are the enzymes
involved in cellular detoxification by conjugating the tripeptide (g-Glu-Cys-Gly) glutathione (GSH) to a wide
variety of substrates such as endobiotic and xenobiotic
compounds [1]. GSTs have been identified in all the
organisms, including plants, animals, fungi and bacteria
analyzed to date [2,3]. Although most of GSTs exist as
soluble enzymes, distantly related mitochondrial Kappa

GSTs and microsomal GSTs have also been identified in
animals [4]. GST proteins are represented by a multigene family in plants similar to other organisms [5-7].
Several GSTs have been identified and characterized in
various plant species with differential and overlapping
substrate specificities [5,8,9]. Based on the predicted
amino acid sequences, the soluble GSTs in plants have
been grouped into several classes, including Phi, Tau,
Lambda, dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), Theta,
Zeta, elongation factor 1 gamma (EF1G) and tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase (TCHQD). Among these
classes, Phi, Tau, Lambda and DHAR classes are plant
specific [10].

Plant GSTs have been a focus of attention because of
their role in herbicide detoxification. Some evidences
showed that GSTs are present at every stage of plant
development from early embryogenesis to senescence
and in every tissue type examined [5,7,11]. GSTs have
been found to be differentially regulated by a variety of
stimuli, including abiotic and biotic stresses, plant hormones such as auxins, cytokinins and ABA, heavy
metals, GSH and hydrogen peroxide [12-15]. Despite
their suspected crucial role in stress responses and significant efforts made, the specific role(s) of GST
enzymes have not been elucidated. The role of plant
GSTs has also been proposed in the transport and metabolism of secondary compounds [16-18]. Plant GSTs
can also act as glutathione peroxidases [19,20], protect
cells from oxygen toxicity [21] and suppress apoptosis
[22]. Some of plant GSTs were originally identified as
auxin- and cytokinin-binding proteins [23-25], pointing
their role in hormone signal transduction pathways as
well.
Among GSTs, the members of Tau and Phi classes are
most studied in plants. The reason may be attributed to
their larger number. They are dimeric and catalyze the
conjugation of a diverse range of xenobiotics and detoxify selective herbicides [10]. Theta GSTs have limited
transferase activity towards xenobiotics but are highly
active GSH-dependent peroxidases [10]. Zeta class GSTs
have been shown to differ from other GSTs in showing
no GSH conjugating or GSH peroxidase activity, rather
these are involved in GSH-dependent tyrosine catabolism [26,27]. The recently discovered DHAR class GSTs
are monomeric and act as GSH-dependent oxidoreductases [8]. EF1G class of GST proteins encodes g subunit
of eukaryotic translation elongation factor. It has been
proposed that the N-terminal GST domain present in
this class of proteins may be involved in mediating the
assembly of EF1 and regulation of formation of multisubunit complexes containing EF1 [28]. Another recently
identified GST from Arabidopsis closely resembles the
TCHQD enzymes from prokaryotes [10]. The functional
characterization of this protein has not been reported.
Although quite a few GST proteins have been characterized in rice, the functions of majority of members in
this family remain unknown. In the first identification
and classification of GST family in rice based on analysis
of EST database and unfinished genomic sequence, a
total of 61 members were identified and their expression
patterns analyzed by querying EST databases [7]. In this
study, the members of GST family in rice have been reanalyzed based on complete genome sequence and annotation, and a total of 79 putative GST genes were
identified. In addition, a comprehensive expression analysis during various stages of development, hormone
treatments, abiotic and biotic stress conditions, have

been performed. The results reported in this study will
provide a very useful reference for further functional
analysis of members of this family in rice.

Results and Discussion
Identification of genes encoding GST proteins in rice

GSTs are represented by multigene family in plants.
Several members of GST family have been identified
and divided into different classes in Arabidopsis, maize
and soybean [5,6]. Soranzo et al [7] reported the presence of 61 members of GST family in rice based on
analysis of EST database and unfinished genomic
sequence and divided them into four classes. In this
study, we performed domain search for the proteins
containing GST N-terminal domain (PFAM domain
PF02798) in the Rice Genome Annotation Project
(RGAP) database (release 5) or HMM profile search
against the downloaded proteome of rice. Subsequently,
the proteins which did not show the presence of
GST_N domain (characteristic of GST proteins) in
SMART analysis were eliminated. Taken together, a
total of 79 non-redundant gene loci were predicted to
contain GST_N domain and encode putative GST proteins in rice. The number of GST proteins predicted in
this study is 29.5% greater than the previously reported
number in rice (61) [7]. A comparative analysis showed
that 52 among the 61 ESTs/cDNA clones encoding GST
proteins in rice reported by Soranzo et al [7] correspond
to the gene loci predicted in this study. The sequences
for five genes (NM_1903851, OsGSTF11; P0493G01.11,
OsGSTF13; OJ1006_F06.6, OsGSTF16; OSJNBa0033P04.19, OsGSTU36 and OSJNBa0018H01.7,
OsGSTMU37) could not be retrieved as they have
become obsolete entries in NCBI, OsGSTU6 (AF379376)
represents a viral sequence, OsGSTT2 (AY541762) has
been annotated as a ty1-copia subclass retrotransposon,
OsGST35 (AY533125) did not show the presence of
GST_N domain and OsGSTU7 (AF402794) was redundant with another GST gene OsGSTU18 (AF402805). In
total, this study reports 27 new gene loci encoding GST
proteins in rice as compared to Soranzo et al [7]. The
locus ID, open reading frame length, protein length and
chromosomal location of all the 79 GST genes are given
in Additional file 1.
To reveal the evolutionary relationship among the rice
GST proteins, a phylogenetic tree was generated using
their full-length protein sequences (Additional file 2).
The results suggested that the rice GST family can be
classified into seven classes (Additional file 2). Based on
the protein sequence alignments and evolutionary relationship, largest number of GST genes (52) were
included in Tau class followed by 17 genes in Phi, four
in Zeta, two in DHAR, two in EF1G and one each in
Theta and TCHQD classes. The members included in

Jain et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/73

Tau, Phi, Zeta, DHAR, EF1G, Theta and TCHQD
classes were designated as OsGSTU, OsGSTF, OsGSTZ,
OsDHAR, OsEF1G, OsGSTT and OsTCHQD, respectively, followed by a number (Additional file 1). To keep
the nomenclature of GST family consistent, the name of
reported genes has been retained and the systematic
names of the genes reported previously but not identified in this study were assigned to newly identified
members (Additional file 1). All the newly identified
members within a class were named according to their
sequential position on rice chromosomes from top to
bottom.
The pairwise comparison of GST protein sequences
showed considerable sequence diversity with overall
identity ranging from 8% to 92%. However, relatively
high identities were found among the members of same
class, for example, the sequence identity among the
members of Tau class varied from 27% to 92% and for
Phi class members from 24% to 84%. The multiple
sequence alignments of full-length GST protein
sequences showed that N-terminal is highly conserved,
which contains active site serine residue fundamental to
GST activity and GSH-binding site. The active site serine residue (position 15 in OsGSTU1) was conserved in
all but 10 of the GST proteins. OsGSTU45, U47, U52,
F11, F13, T1, DHAR1, DHAR2, EF1G1 and EF1G2 lack
essential active site serine residue. An arginine residue
(position 20 in OsGSTU1) was also conserved in most
of GST proteins. In addition, serine residue (position 69
in OsGSTU1) in the GSH-binding domain was essentially conserved in all the GST proteins except OsGSTF9
and OsTCHQD1. The additional putative conserved
motifs in GST proteins were investigated using Multiple
Em (Expectation Maximization) for Motif Elicitation
(MEME) program. We identified ten highly significant
(<e-100) putative conserved motifs of more than 10
amino acids in length present in at least ten of the GST
proteins (Fig. 1, Additional file 3). The motifs 1, 4, 5
and 7 formed a part of GST N-terminal domain.
Among the ten predicted putative motifs, some were
specific to the members of a particular class and others
were conserved in two to many classes. Motifs 1, 2, 3
and 8 were specific to Tau class only; motif 4 was present in members of Tau and DHAR class and motif 6 in
Tau and Zeta class members. Motif 5, which harbors
the active site serine residue, was present in most of
members of Tau, Phi, Zeta and TCHQD classes. The
members of Phi, Zeta, Theta, EF1G and TCHQD harbors motif 7. Motif 9 was present in Phi, EF1G and
TCHQD classes, whereas motif 10 was present in members of Phi, EF1G and DHAR classes. These putative
conserved motifs may provide diversity in functions of
the GST proteins.

Tandem duplications are responsible for the family
expansion

The rice genome has undergone several rounds of genome-wide duplication events, including polyploidy,
which has great impact on the expansion of a gene
family in the genome. To investigate the contribution of
gene duplication in the expansion of GST gene family,
the chromosomal location of each GST gene was determined based on the information provided by RGAP
(Additional file 1). The chromosomal localization of all
members of this family indicated a non-random distribution (Fig. 2). Chromosome 8 was devoid of GST
genes whereas chromosome 10 encoded highest number
(32 of 79, 40.5%) of the GST family members followed
by chromosome 1 (20 of 79, 25.3%). A total of six clusters of tandemly arranged GST genes were observed on
different chromosomes. Chromosome 1 harbors three
clusters of GST genes, first cluster of seven members of
Phi class, second cluster of two members of Tau class
and third cluster of six members of Tau class. The
fourth cluster of 4 members of Phi class was present on
chromosome 3. The fifth and largest cluster localized on
chromosome 10 contains 28 Tau class GST genes present in tandem at a single locus. The two Zeta class
GST genes formed the sixth cluster on chromosome 12.
This data suggested the major contribution of tandem
duplications (51 of 79, 64.6%) to the GST family expansion. On the other hand, we found eight members of
GST family located on the segmentally duplicated
regions. Since the number of GST genes located on segmentally duplicated regions is much smaller than those
present in tandem, the localized gene duplications
appear to have contributed a major role in expansion of
this gene family.
Rice genome encodes significantly higher (79) number
of GST genes as compared to Arabidopsis (54). To
explore the expansion of GST gene family members in
rice vis-Ã -vis Arabidopsis, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the multiple sequence alignment of
their full-length protein sequences (Fig. 3). The phylogenetic tree showed that GST proteins from rice and Arabidopsis belonging to the same class were clustered
together. In addition, GST proteins of rice and Arabidopsis within a class were usually clustered in speciesspecific manner. This indicates that GST proteins of
each class existed before the divergence of monocots
and dicots and later on expanded independently in species-specific manner. This type of species-specific expansion of other gene families has been observed as well
[29,30]. Furthermore, the degree of expansion of Tau
class varied significantly in rice and Arabidopsis. Only
28 members of Tau class have been predicted in Arabidopsis, whereas this class is comprised of 52 members

Figure 1 Putative motifs predicted in rice GST proteins. Significant motifs (e-value <e-100) of more than 10 amino acid length present in at
least 10 GST proteins were predicted by MEME search. The consensus sequence, length (amino acids), number of GST proteins containing the

in rice. It seems tandem duplication events have contributed significantly towards evolution of Tau class
GST genes in rice. The analysis of phylogenetic tree
revealed that a major group of GST proteins comprised
of 30 proteins within Tau class present in rice was
absent in Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). It may be speculated that
these GST proteins were lost in Arabidopsis or evolved
in rice after divergence of monocots and dicots and may
perform monocot specific functions. Likewise, the

expansion of Phi, Zeta and DHAR classes is more in
rice as compared to Arabidopsis. Although the Zeta and
Theta class GSTs have been suggested to represent
ancestral genes, they are poorly represented in plants
[14]. Surprisingly, on the other hand, the presence of
plant-specific Phi and Tau class GSTs is more numerous. This could be explained due to the rapid evolution
of Phi and Tau class GSTs in plants, which may perform
diverse plant-specific functions.

Figure 2 Chromosomal distribution of rice GST genes. The chromosome number is indicated at the top of each chromosome. GST genes
localized on duplicated chromosomal segments are connected by lines. The genes labeled on left side are oriented from bottom to top and
those on right side are oriented from top to bottom on rice chromosomes. Six clusters (three on chromosome 1 and one each on chromosome
1, 10 and 12) of tandemly arranged GST genes are indicated in boxes. Exact position of each GST gene on rice chromosome pseudomolecules is
given in Additional file 1.

Differential expression of GST gene family members in
various tissues/organs

Although the roles of GSTs have been explored in various stress responses, the evidences for their role in
plant growth and development are very limited. The
overlapping and tissue-specific expression patterns of
GST genes have been observed in some plant species,
including rice, by querying EST databases [5,7,9]. The
study of gene expression patterns of all the members of
a gene family provides insight into their functional
diversification. The expression evidence for 62 of the
rice GST genes was found in terms of the availability of
their corresponding full-length cDNA and/or EST evidence. We surveyed the transcript accumulation of GST
genes across a wide range of tissues/organs and developmental stages of rice employing two approaches. In the

first approach, we used the data from rice Massively
Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) database to quantify the expression of individual GST gene. MPSS technology provides a quantitative measure of transcript
accumulation of virtually all the genes in a tissue sample
in terms of number of small signature sequences corresponding to each gene [31]. The survey of 22 rice MPSS
libraries [32] representing 18 tissue samples showed that
at least 77 GST genes have corresponding 17 base signatures, suggesting that most of the GST genes are
expressed in rice. However, significant signatures (that
uniquely identify individual GST gene) were found for
61 GST genes (Additional file 4). The number of tags
(in tpm, tags per million) for rice GST genes varied significantly, indicating marginal (1-3 tpm) to strong
(>250) expression. In addition, the number of tags

revealed differential expression patterns of individual
GST genes in various rice tissues/organs.
Microarray represents a high throughput means to
analyze the gene expression of all the members of a
gene family and to identify genes involved in a particular
biological process. In the second approach, we used the
microarray data for various tissues/organs and developmental stages available at GEO database under the
accession numbers GSE6893 and GSE7951. The series
GSE6893 includes microarray data from 45 hybridizations representing three biological replicates each of 15
different tissues/organs and developmental stages [30],
whereas series GSE7951 includes the microarray data
from 12 hybridizations representing 9 different tissue
samples [33]. Because three biological replicates were
available only for stigma and ovary in the series
GSE7951 dataset, only these data were used in this analysis. All the tissues/organs and developmental stages for
which microarray data was analyzed in this study are
summarized in Additional file 5. The probe sets representing GST genes on the Affymetrix array were identified using Rice Multiplatform Microarray Search Tool.
A total of 71 GST genes were represented on the Affymetrix arrays. There was no probe set on the arrays corresponding to the remaining GST genes. The average
log signal values of 71 GST genes were extracted after
whole-chip data processing for all the tissue samples
using Genespring GX software (Additional file 6). We
used TIGR Multi Experiment Viewer to perform hierarchical clustering analysis of the expression of 71 GST
genes based on their average log signal values (Fig. 4A).
Distinct transcript abundance patterns of GST genes
were readily identified in the microarray data analyzed.
Many of the GST genes showed preferential accumulation of transcripts in a given tissue/organ or developmental stage. We grouped GST genes roughly in 16
clusters (cluster I-XVI) with similar expression patterns
(Fig. 4A). The number of genes varied from one (cluster
III and XI) to 11 (cluster I) in these clusters. Cluster I
include 11 GST genes which are highly expressed and
cluster VIII include six very lowly expressed GST genes
in all the tissues/organs or developmental stage analyzed. Ten genes included in cluster X also exhibited
very low expression in all/most of the tissues analyzed.
The GST genes which showed very low expression in
various tissues and/or developmental stages analyzed
might express in specific cell-type(s) or tissue/condition
other than those included in this study. Other reason
for detection of very low expression of these GST genes
may be attributed to the improper/hampered hybridization of their fragmented RNA molecules to the oligos
represented on the chip because of the presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in the rice varieties used for microarray experiments. However, other

Page 7 of 17

GST genes exhibited transcript abundance in one or
more distinct tissue/organ or developmental stage analyzed. The expression of few GST genes was restricted
to a particular tissue/organ/developmental stage,
whereas other GST genes exhibited preferential expression in narrow to wide window of developmental stages.
Four genes in cluster II are expressed preferentially in
root and stages of panicle development. Seven GST
genes (OsGSTF10, U26 and U30 in cluster V at high
level and OsGSTF17, U5, U37 and U41 in cluster IX at
low level) are expressed exclusively in root. The expression of OsGSTF12 is restricted to seed development
stages (S1-S5). Two genes from cluster VII, OsGSTF7
and U14, were preferentially expressed during P5 stage
of panicle development and the expression of OsGSTU46 was restricted to stigma and ovary. Four genes
(two each in clusters XII and XVI) are expressed preferentially in vegetative tissues, late stages of panicle development and seed development stages. These genes may
perform specific roles in these tissues/organs or developmental stage. The validation of differential gene
expression of selected GST genes in various tissues/
organs and developmental stages by real-time PCR analysis showed very good agreement with the microarray
results (Fig. 4B). These results suggest the involvement
of GSTs in various developmental events in rice.
The expression of eight Tau class GST genes (OsGSTU9, 22, 25, 27, 31, 32, 33 and 34) for which microarray data was not available, was explored in terms of
availability of their corresponding FL-cDNA, EST and/
or MPSS tags. We found all these evidences of expression (FL-cDNA, EST and MPSS tags) for three GST
genes (OsGSTU9, U27 and U34) and one GST gene
(OsGSTU22) had corresponding FL-cDNA/EST available. Although MPSS tags were available for other four
GST genes, significant (that uniquely identify individual
gene) tags were available for two (OsGSTU31 and 33) of
them. Among these GST genes, OsGST9 was expressed
in a wide range of tissues, whereas OsGSTU27, 31, 33
and 34 were preferentially expressed in stressed and/or
non-stressed young roots (Additional file 4). Taken
together, our results indicate that all the 79 GST genes
identified in this study are expressed in one or the other
rice tissue and exhibit overlapping and/or specific
expression patterns with quantitative differences.
Duplicated GST genes exhibit redundant and divergent
expression patterns

As discussed above, we found quite a large number of
duplicated GST genes in rice. Gene duplication raises
the question about their functional redundancy and also
serves as a mechanism to increase functional diversity.
After duplication, genes may undergo diversification of
gene function such as neo-functionalization, sub-functionalization, non-functionalization or hypo-

functionalization [34-36]. The expression patterns of
duplicated genes indicate their evolutionary fates. The
functional diversification has been proposed to be
important for the retention of duplicated genes. To
reveal the functional redundancy/diversification of duplicated GST genes, their expression patterns were analyzed. Among the four GST gene pairs localized on
duplicated chromosomal segments, two pairs OsGSTF6/
F14 and OsEF1G1/EF1G2 exhibit similar expression patterns, whereas other two pairs OsGSTF12/F17 and OsGSTU51/U52 showed divergent expression patterns (Fig.
5, Additional file 7). In fact, one of the members in
these gene pairs is expressed at very low level in all the
tissues/organs examined suggesting their non/hypofunctionalization. Among the six clusters of tandemly
duplicated GST genes, the two genes included in each
of cluster 2 (OsGSTU39/U40) and 6 (OsGSTZ1/Z2),
exhibited highly similar expression patterns with some
quantitative differences (Additional file 7). The GST
genes included in other four clusters exhibited similar
to highly diverged expression patterns indicating the
events of neo-, sub-, and non/hypo-functionalization
(Fig. 5, Additional file 7). The results suggest the evolution of GST gene family has occurred by gene duplication followed by retention due to sub- or neofunctionalization of the duplicated genes.
To investigate the probable explanation for divergence
in expression patterns of duplicated GST genes, we analyzed their promoter sequences 1 kb upstream of translational start site. The putative cis-regulatory elements
were identified using PLACE (a database of plant cisacting regulatory DNA elements) search. This analysis
revealed that the regulatory elements are more conserved in duplicated GST genes with similar expression
patterns (for example, OsEF1G1/EF1G2 and OsGSTF6/
F14) as compared to the GST genes with divergent
expression patterns (for example, OsGSTF12/F17 and
OsGSTU51/U52). The considerable difference in the
regulatory elements of duplicated genes might explain
their divergent expression patterns. However, experimental validation is required to reach this conclusion.
Further, the existence of some other regulatory mechanism, which is responsible for divergent expression patterns and/or non-functionalization of one of the
duplicates, can not be ruled out.
Differential expression of GST genes during hormone
treatment

Some of the plant GSTs are induced by plant hormones
auxins and cytokinins. The transcript level of GST genes
is induced very rapidly in the presence of auxin [37,38].
In this study, we used two microarray datasets to assess
the effect of auxin and cytokinin on the expression profiles of GST genes. First dataset includes microarray
analysis of 7-day-old rice seedlings treated with indole-

Page 9 of 17

3-acetic acid (IAA) and benzyl aminopurine (BAP) up to
3 h each [38]. Second dataset includes microarray analysis of root and leaf tissues of two-week-old seedlings
treated with trans-zeatin (tZ) for 30 min and 120 min
[39]. The data analysis showed that a total of 31 GST
genes exhibit significant differential expression under at
least one of the conditions analyzed (Additional file 8,
9). Interestingly, majority (27) of them belonged to Tau
class. Quite a large number (14) of GST genes showed
differential expression in the presence of auxin. All but
one (OsGSTF10) of these 14 genes were up-regulated
significantly. A total of 24 genes were differentially
expressed in the presence of cytokinin. Three genes
which showed up-regulation in the presence of BAP in
first dataset did not show any differential expression in
the presence of tZ in second dataset. Among the 21
genes which showed differential expression in the second dataset, 11 genes were differentially expressed in
roots as compared to 15 in leaf. Five genes showed differential expression both in roots and leaf, whereas six
and ten genes were unique to root and leaf, respectively.
These results suggest the differential response of rice
GST genes with respect to age of seedlings, tissue-type
and/or cytokinin type. The differential expression of
some representative genes in the presence of IAA and/
or BAP has also been validated by real-time PCR analysis (Additional file 8).
Differential expression of GST genes during abiotic stress

Many GSTs have been implicated in various abiotic
stress responses in plants. The differential expression of
several Arabidopsis GSTs in response to ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, hydrogen peroxide and 2, 4dichlorophenoxy acetic acid have been reported [6,40].
To study the effect of various abiotic stresses (desiccation, salt, cold and arsenate) on the expression profiles
of GST genes, microarray data available under series
accession number GSE6901 [30] was analyzed. Differential expression analysis for rice seedlings treated with
different abiotic stresses (desiccation, salt and cold) as
compared to mock-treated control seedlings was performed. This analysis showed that at least 20 GST genes
(16 of Tau class, two of Phi class and one each of Zeta
and TCHQD class) were differentially expressed significantly under at least one of the abiotic stress conditions
analyzed. Among these, three GST genes were differentially expressed in all the stress conditions (Fig. 6A,
Additional file 10). Other 11 genes were differentially
expressed in any two stress conditions. However, six
genes showed differential expression under only specific
stress condition. One gene (OsGSTU10) which was
down-regulated by desiccation stress was up-regulated
by cold stress. Similarly, we analyzed the microarray
data for arsenate stress from an earlier study [41]. The
data included expression analysis from rice varieties

Azucena (arsenate-sensitive) and Bala (arsenate-tolerant)
grown in the presence or absence of 13.3 Î¼m sodium
arsenate for 7 days. The data analysis showed that a
large number (32) of GST genes (25 of Tau class, five of
Phi class and one each of Zeta and DHAR class) showed
significant differential expression in response to arsenate
stress as compared to other abiotic stress (20) (Fig. 6B,
Additional file 11). A total of 27 GST genes were significantly up-regulated, whereas four genes were downregulated in Azucena. In Bala, 23 genes were up-regulated and four genes were down-regulated. Twenty two
GST genes were significantly up-regulated and four
were down-regulated both in Azucena and Bala.
Furthermore, 13 GST genes were commonly differentially expressed under various abiotic and arsenate stress
conditions analyzed in this study. The real-time PCR
analysis confirmed the differential expression of representative GST genes during various abiotic stress conditions and arsenate stress (Fig. 6C).
Differential expression of GST genes during biotic stress

GSTs have been shown to be differentially regulated
upon pathogen attack in several plant species [6,42].
One of the most serious and widespread diseases of rice

is blast caused by the ascomycete fungus Magnaporthe
grisea. Recently, a transcriptome analysis of a fully susceptible infection of rice (cultivar Nipponbare) by a
compatible M. grisea isolate (FR13) was performed to
understand the molecular mechanism involved in their
interaction [43]. We analyzed this data to have inkling
about the role of rice GST genes in this host-pathogen
interaction. The data includes microarray analysis of
two-week-old rice seedlings (cultivar Nipponbare) treated with M. grisea (virulent isolate FR13) spore suspension on gelatine or gelatine alone after 3 days (3 dpi,
without disease symptoms) and 4 days (4 dpi, with disease symptoms) post inoculation. The data analysis
revealed that quite a large number (34) of GST genes
are differentially expressed more than 2-fold (Fig. 7,
Additional file 12). Among these, only 11 genes showed
differential expression at 3 dpi, whereas 32 genes at 4
dpi (nine genes showed differential expression at both 3
and 4 dpi).
Striga hermonthica is an obligate root hemiparasite of
rice and other cereals that causes severe loss of yield.

level, global gene expression profiling was performed by
Swarbrick and colleagues [44]. We took advantage of
the availability of this data to study the expression profiles of rice GST genes in roots of susceptible (IAC165)
and highly resistant (Nipponbare) cultivars in response
to infection with S. hermonthica after 2, 4 and 11 dpi.
The data analysis revealed that at least 17 genes were
significantly up- and down-regulated by more than 2fold in Nipponbare as compared with 28 genes in susceptible IAC165 cultivar (Fig. 7, Additional file 12). In
IAC165, 15 and 13 genes were up- and down-regulated,
respectively, whereas nine and eight GST genes were
up- and down-regulated, respectively, in Nipponbare.
Twelve GST genes showed differential expression in
both cultivars. Among the total 48 GST genes differentially expressed in two datasets, 30 genes belonged to

Tau class, 12 to Phi, two to Zeta, two to EF1G and one
each to DHAR and TCHQD classes.
Overlap of GST responses to various stimuli and
developmental processes

The overlap of response of GST genes to various stimuli, including hormone, abiotic stress (including
arsenate stress) and biotic stress, and developmental
processes was analyzed. A global figure including the
expression profiles of all the 71 GST genes for which
microarray data was available, during various stages of
development and under various environmental stimuli
analyzed in this study, was generated (Additional file
13). It is noteworthy that among a total of 53 GST
genes, which were differentially expressed in the presence of any of these three environmental stimuli (hormone, abiotic stress and biotic stress), 22 genes showed

response to all of these stimuli (Fig. 8). Other 21 GST
genes responded to any of the two stimuli. However, 15
GST genes showed response to specific stimuli (Fig. 8).
Some of the GST family members were induced by multiple stresses, while others showed response to few to
unique stress condition(s). For example, OsGSTF5, U3,
U4, U6, U37, U39, U40 and U50 were induced by abiotic, arsenate and biotic stresses analyzed in this study.
However, OsGSTU18, U36, TCHQD1 exhibited response
to abiotic and biotic stresses, but were non-responsive
to arsenate stress. Likewise, OsGSTU14 responded specifically to abiotic stress, OsGSTU21 and U48 to arsenate
stress and OsGSTF1, F13 and U35 to biotic stress. In
general, the members of Tau class appeared to show
response to various stimuli more frequently. However,
71% (12) of Phi class GST genes responded to biotic
stress as compared to 58% (30) of Tau class. The
expression of two GST genes of Tau class, OsGSTU3
and U4, was found to be induced by heavy metals,
hypoxic stress and salt stress [45]. We also found that
the transcript levels of these genes are induced by desiccation, salt and cold stress. In addition, our analysis
revealed that the transcript levels of these genes are
induced in the presence of arsenate and biotic stress as
well, indicating their role in broad spectrum stress
responses.
Given that plant GSTs are induced by a plethora of
environmental factors, it was proposed that GST expression is universally induced by the production of stressassociated active oxygen species (AOS) signaling molecules, which in turn counteracts the adverse effects of
AOS by their GSH-dependent peroxidase activity [12].
However, our study showed that, although several GSTs
are commonly regulated, many of them exhibit differential and specific response to various stresses as well.
Similar observations have been reported in other studies
too [6,15]. These results indicate that the induction of
GST family members occurs via multiple and independent pathways and a subset of which may involve AOS
as signaling molecules. It has been reported that GSTs
are induced very rapidly by pathogens and typically precede the induction of well-known defense genes such as
pathogenesis-related proteins [42,46,47]. Based on analysis of mutants, this rapid induction of GSTs has been
found to be dependent on combined SA- and ethylene
signaling [47]. This was further supported by the
increased production of SA and ethylene by the plants
inoculated with pathogen [47]. This clearly indicates a
cross-talk between various signaling pathways.
Many evidences show crosstalk between various developmental processes and environmental stimuli
[30,38,48]. We also found relation between tissue-/
developmental stage-specific expression pattern and
stress responses of few GST genes. For example,

stages of seed development and was also found to be
highly up-regulated by plant hormones, abiotic stress,
arsenate stress and biotic stress conditions. Likewise,
OsGSTU5 and OsGSTU37 are preferentially expressed
in root and are also up-regulated by auxin and various
stress conditions. The OsGSTF10 was specifically
expressed in root and was down-regulated by most of
the environmental stimuli analyzed in this study. Other
GST genes, OsGSTU10, U18 and U36, which were preferentially expressed in root, were also down-regulated
by one or more of the stimuli. These commonly regulated GST genes might mediate plant growth responses
to various environmental stimuli in specific tissues/
organs and/or developmental stage.

Conclusion
This study provides not only an updated annotation and
nomenclature of the GST family in rice, but also the
identification of several tissue- and/or developmental
stage-specific, hormone-responsive and abiotic and biotic
stress-responsive GST genes included in various classes.
Considering the fact that a very limited number of GST
genes have been characterized till date, our results provide a very useful framework and starting point for
revealing the function(s) of GST family members in rice,
especially those involved in specific developmental processes, hormone response and stress tolerance.

Methods
Database search and sequence analysis

GSTs were identified by keyword, domain name and
HMMER searches of rice proteome available at Rice
Genome Annotation Project [49] database using the
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile (build 2.3.2) of
GST_N domain (PF02798) downloaded from PFam. The
presence of GST_N domain in individual protein was
further confirmed by SMART analysis. Multiple
sequence alignment analyses were performed using
ClustalX (version 1.83) program. The GST genes present
on duplicated chromosomal segments were identified by
segmental genome duplication of rice available at RGAP
with the maximum length distance permitted between
collinear gene pairs of 500 kb. The GST genes separated
by a maximum of five genes were identified as tandemly
duplicated genes. The unrooted phylogenetic trees were
constructed by neighbor-joining method and displayed
using Treeview program. Putative conserved motifs were
identified using MEME (version 4.1.0) program [50].
Plant growth

The tissue samples of mature leaf, Y leaf and various
stages of panicle and seed development were collected
from field grown rice (Oryza sativa ssp. indica var.
IR64) plants as described [30]. Roots were harvested
from 7-day-old seedlings grown hydroponically. For salt,
desiccation, cold and arsenate stress treatments, 7-dayold light-grown rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica var.
IR64) seedlings were transferred to a beaker containing
200 mM NaCl solution, dried between folds of tissue
paper at 28 Â± 1Â°C, kept at 4 Â± 1Â°C and, transferred to a
beaker containing 50 Î¼M sodium arsenate solution,
respectively, each for 3 h. Likewise, 7-day-old lightgrown rice seedlings were transferred to a beaker containing 50 Î¼M solution of indole-3-acetic acid and 50
Î¼M solution of benzyl aminopurine for auxin and cytokinin treatment, respectively. The control seedlings were
kept in water for 3 h, at 28 Â± 1Â°C.
Microarray data analysis

The microarray data publicly available at GEO database
under the series accession numbers GSE6893 (expression data for reproductive development), GSE7951
(expression profiling of stigma), GSE6901 (expression
data for stress treatment), GSE4471 (expression data
from rice varieties Azucena and Bala grown in arsenate),
GSE5167 (expression data for auxin and cytokinin
response), GSE6719 (expression data for cytokinin
response), GSE7256 (expression data for virulent infection by Magnaporthe grisea), and GSE10373 (expression
data for interaction with the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica) were used for expression analysis of rice GST
genes. The entire microarray experiments used in this
study are listed in Additional file 5. The Affymetrix CEL

Page 14 of 17

files were imported into Genespring GX (version 10)
software (Agilent Technologies). The normalization and
probe summarization was performed by Gene Chip
Robust Multi Array (GCRMA) method. We performed a
stringent statistical analysis consisting of one-way
ANOVA over all the samples in a series and the Benjamini-Hoschberg multiple testing correction was applied
to the data (P â¤ 0.05).
The IDs of probe sets present on the Affymetrix rice
genome array representing the GST genes were identified using Rice Multi-platform Microarray Search [51]
tool. The data for only one probe set for each GST gene
was used for expression analysis. This resulted in identification of probe sets for 71 GST genes that were represented on the Affymetrix rice genome array. After
normalization and log transformation of data for all the
rice genes present on the chip, the log signal intensity
values for rice probe IDs corresponding to GST genes
were extracted as a subset and all the subsequent analyses were done on this subset only. The genes that are
up- or down-regulated equal to or more than two-fold
with a P-value of at least 0.05 were considered to be differentially expressed significantly. We generated tabdelimited files for average log signal values for development data and fold-change values for abiotic stress, biotic stress and hormone treatments and imported them
into TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV) [52] to carry
out clustering analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed based on Euclidean distance matrix and Complete Linkage rule.
Real-time PCR analysis

To confirm the differential expression of representative
GST genes in various rice tissues/developmental stages
and stress/hormone treatments identified by microarray
data analysis, real-time PCR analysis was performed
using gene-specific primers as described earlier [53].
The primer sequences are listed in Additional file 14. At
least three biological replicates of each sample and three
technical replicates of each biological replicate were analyzed for real-time PCR analysis. The expression of each
gene in different RNA samples was normalized with the
expression of the suitable internal control gene, UBQ5
[53] to ensure the equal amount of cDNA used for individual reactions. The mRNA levels for each candidate
gene in different tissue samples were calculated using
the ÎÎCT method.
MPSS data analysis

Expression evidence from MPSS (Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing) tags was determined from the Rice
MPSS project [32,54]. The signature was considered to be
significant if it uniquely identifies an individual gene and
shows perfect match (100% identity over 100% of the
length of the tag). The normalized abundance (tags per

Jain et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:73

million, tpm) of these signatures for a given gene in a
given library represents the quantitative estimate of
expression of that gene. MPSS data for 17-base signatures
from 22 mRNA libraries representing 18 different tissues/
organs of rice (Additional file 4) were used for the analysis.
