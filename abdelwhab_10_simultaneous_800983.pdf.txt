Abstract
Background: The endemic status of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 in Egypt
continues to devastate the local poultry industry and poses a permanent threat for human health. Several
genetically and antigenically distinct H5N1 lineages co-circulate in Egypt: Strains of clade 2.2.1 proper replicate
mainly in backyard birds causing the bulk of human infections, while a variant lineage within 2.2.1 (2.2.1v) appears
to be perpetuated mainly in commercial poultry farms in Egypt. Viruses of the 2.2.1v lineage represent drift variants
escaping from conventional vaccine-induced immunity and some of these strains also escaped detection by
commercial real time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) protocols due to mismatches in the primers/probe
binding sites.
Results: We developed therefore a versatile, sensitive and lineage-specific multiplex RT-qPCR for detection and
typing of H5N1 viruses in Egypt. Analytical characterization was carried out using 50 Egyptian HPAIV H5N1 strains
isolated since 2006 and 45 other avian influenza viruses (AIV). A detection limit of 400 cRNA copies per ml sample
matrix was found. Higher diagnostic sensitivity of the multiplex assay in comparison to other generic H5 or M-gene
based RT-qPCR assays were found by examination of 63 swab samples from experimentally infected chickens and
50 AIV-positive swab samples from different host species in the field in Egypt.
Conclusions: The new multiplex RT-qPCR assay could be useful for rapid high-throughput monitoring for the
presence of HPAIV H5N1 in commercial poultry in Egypt. It may also aid in prospective epidemiological studies to
further delineate and better control spread of HPAIV H5N1 in Egypt.

Background
The incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
(HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 of phlyogenetic clade 2.2,
subclade 2.2.1 [1], into Egypt in 2005/2006 caused
severe economic losses in the commercial (previous
total annual production of 850 million birds) and backyard sectors (250 million birds) of poultry production in
this country [2]. The virus also possesses considerable

zoonotic potential. Human cases of HPAIV H5N1 infection, characterized by a high fatality rate, started to
occur due to virus exposure of humans at the poultryhuman interface which is highly fissured in Egypt [3]. In
order to restore poultry production capacities and to
mitigate risks of an emergence of new virus variants
with increased pandemic potential in the human population, efforts to control HPAIV H5N1 were given a high
priority [4].
Despite intense control measures including blanket
vaccination, surveillance and depopulation of infected

poultry holdings, HPAI H5N1 has gained endemic status
in Egyptian poultry populations [5] and continuous,
year-round circulation of HPAI H5N1 virus has been
reported [6-8]. This is at least in part due to the highly
divergent evolution of H5N1 viruses in Egypt which
seems to be accelerated and shaped by vaccine-induced
selection pressure leading to the emergence of genetically and antigenically distinct viruses [9]. Strains of the
parent subclade 2.2.1 proper (2.2.1p) are reported to circulate nationwide mainly in unvaccinated birds, particularly waterfowl from backyard holdings [7]. The vast
majority of human infections (34 fatalities out of 109
infected cases until 22nd June 2010 [10]) is attributable
to viruses of this group. Since 2007, viruses of a variant sublineage emerged from clade 2.2.1. These
viruses, which will here be referred to as lineage 2.2.1v,
originated from and circulate predominantly in vaccinated commercial chickens [8]. These antigenically
drifted strains were shown to escape immunity induced
by standard H5 vaccination and are prevalent mainly
in Lower Egypt, particularly in the Nile Delta
[7,8,11,12]. Knowledge of the epidemiology, especially
the transmission pathways, of those two lineages
between commercial farms, backyard birds, feral birds
and humans is incomplete but urgently required to
improve control measures. So far, assignment of
viruses to either lineage requires virus isolation and
antigenic characterization by hemagglutination inhibition or sequencing and molecular analysis. No rapid
typing tools are currently available.
A number of RT-qPCR assays for diagnosis and characterization with respect to subtype and pathogenicity of
HPAIV H5N1 have been published. These assays target
the matrix gene [13,14], the nucleoprotein gene [15,16],
the neuraminidase and the hemagglutinin [17-23]. Egypt’s
surveillance program embarked on the H5-specific
RT-qPCR assay [23], which is recommended by the
World Organization of Animal Health (OIE). The assay
was initially highly successful in detecting H5N1 infections in Egypt [5,7]. Since 2007, however, an increasing
number of strains in Egypt escaping detection by this
assay was reported [24]. Therefore, the aim of this study
was to develop a sensitive multiplex RT-qPCR able to
detect all HPAIV H5N1 variants of clade 2.2 currently
circulating in Egypt and, simultaneously, to distinguish
between conventional 2.2.1p strains and the 2.2.1v lineage of vaccine-driven escape variants.

Results
A multiplex RT-qPCR assay was designed to detect
HPAIV H5N1 viruses and simultaneously differentiate
the main two major lineages circulating in Egypt; classic
2.2.1p viruses and the newly evolving clade 2.2.1v of
antigenically drifted variant viruses. A single reaction

assay using multiplexed primers and probes (three colours) was developed. Analytical characterization of the
assay was carried out using 50 Egyptian HPAIV H5N1
strains and other avian pathogens. Diagnostic performance was examined with 63 swab samples from
experimentally infected chickens and 50 avian influenza
virus (AIV)-positive swab samples obtained from different host species in the field in Egypt.
Real-Time RT-PCR optimization

Two strategies were combined to sensitively detect and
distinguish viruses of clade 2.2.1p from 2.2.1v escape
strains (Figure 1). Lineage-specific primers had disparate
nucleotides at their most 3’-positions whereas lineage
specific-probes were distinguished by two nucleotide
positions towards the centre of the probe. Locked
nucleotide chemistry was used to further increase the
specificity of certain probes. Optimization runs were
carried out using log10 dilution series of RNA extracted
from A/chicken/Egypt/0879-NLQP/2008 (clade 2.2.1v),
A/chicken/Egypt/NLQP-0918Q/2009 (clade 2.2.1p) and
A/Whooper swan/Germany/R65/2006 (European clade 2.2)
(data not shown). The concentration of primers and
probes was optimized to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of amplification to final values shown in table 1.
The lowest Ct values and highest ΔR n values for the
multiplex RT-qPCR were observed using the following
thermoprofile and the SuperScript III RT/Platinum Taq
Mix chemistry: 30 min at 50°C and 2 min at 94°C, then
42 cycles of 94°C, 56°C and 68°C for 30 seconds each.
No significant differences in sensitivity were evident
when running the three RT-qPCRs separately indicating
that the multiplex approach produced no relevant detrimental effects on amplification efficacy (data not
shown).
Analytical characteristics

The current protocol was found to have a detection
limit of approximately 2 - 5 RNA copies/reaction which
amounts to 400 - 1000 copies per ml sample matrix
when using cRNA as a copy-based standard. The dynamic
ranges of target detection are summarized in figure 2.
A total of 50 HPAIV H5N1 isolates from Egypt obtained
between 2006 and 2010 for which nucleotide sequences of
the HA gene were available, were examined by the multiplex assay which assigned 33 of them to clade 2.2.1p
(HEX-positive) whereas 15 isolates reacted like 2.2.1v
strains (FAM-positive) (Additional file 1, Table S1). An
exactly similar clustering was achieved for these strains in
a phylogenetic analysis based on full length HA sequences
(7, 8 and Additional file 1, Table S1). In addition, two isolates reacted positive for both 2.2.1p and 2.2.1v lineages.
All 50 isolates were also detected by the ROX probe of the
multiplex RT-qPCR (Additional file 1, Table S1). For 40

Figure 1 Localization of primers and probes. Localization of primers and probes as mentioned in table 1 along the HA gene is depicted. Two
target regions (P1, P2) were chosen. Primers and probes were selected with specificity for the HA of Egyptian HPAIV H5N1 viruses either of
lineage 2.2.1p (proper) or 2.2.1v (variant). Triangles (2.2.1p) and squares (2.2.1v) distinguish nucleotide positions specific for either lineage.
Labelling of hydrolysis probes was with FAM (F, 2.2.1v), HEX (H, 2.2.1p) or ROX (2.2.1p+v).

isolates a comparison with the generic H5 RT-qPCR validated by Slomka et al. [23] was performed showing markedly lower Ct values, corresponding to a higher sensitivity,
for the ROX probe assay.
In addition, several, but not all, non-Egyptian H5
viruses could also be detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR
with equal or slightly lower sensitivity compared to the
generic H5 protocol described by Slomka et al. [23].
Negative results (no measurable Ct obtained [> > 40])
were generated with all non-H5 AI viruses as well as with
other avian viral or bacterial pathogens (Additional file 2,
Table S2).
Diagnostic performance

Swab samples (n = 63) originating from SPF chickens
which were experimentally infected with A/chicken/Egypt/

0879-NLQP/2008 (clade 2.2.1v) or A/chicken/Egypt/
NLQP-0918Q/2009 (clade 2.2.1p) were examined by the
multiplex RT-qPCR and compared to Ct values obtained
with an H5-specific assay described by Slomka et al. [23].
Results are shown in Additional file 3, Table S3, and Figure 3. Swabs collected from individual birds were selected
on basis of Ct values obtained by a generic M gene-targeted RT-qPCR (14, not shown) so as to represent a wide
range of samples with low to high concentrations of AIV
RNA. Special emphasis was put on samples with Ct-values
around 35. The multiplex assay assigned the correct lineage within clade 2.2.1 for all samples. One sample (#15,
Additional file 3, Table S3) yielded a weak false-positive
signal (Ct 39.03) in the 2.2.1v specific assay although the
sample came from a chicken that was infected by a 2.2.1p
proper virus. However, upon repeated RNA extraction and

analysis of the sample, this false-positive reaction was not
reproducible which indicates a possible spill-over contamination possibly during the previous extraction procedure.
No significant differences in Ct values were evident
between the 2.2.1p specific assay (HEX) of the multiplex
RT-qPCR and the Slomka H5 RT-qPCRs (Figure 3a).
However, both the 2.2.1v specific assay (FAM) and the
new Egyptian H5.specific assay (ROX) of the multiplex
mixture were significantly more sensitive (p = 0,027 and p
≤ 0,001) than the generic H5 RT-qPCR (Figures 3b-c).
Oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs were also sampled in
commercial farms (n = 11) and backyard poultry holdings (n = 39) in Egypt. A total of 50 samples pretested
by M-specific RT-qPCR [14] to be positive for AIV was
examined using the H5 multiplex RT-qPCR assay and
the generic H5 protocol [23]. The multiplex RT-qPCR
found all 50 samples positive for subtype H5 (ROX).
Among them, 32 were assigned to clade 2.2.1p and
15 to lineage 2.2.1v (Additional file 4, Table S4, and

figure 4) while three samples were positive for both.
Only 45 samples tested positive in the generic H5 RTqPCR using the original protocol by Slomka et al. [23],
and on average the Ct values produced with the newly
developed multiplex assay were significantly lower (p <
< 0,001) than those obtained in both the M and the H5
generic RT-qPCRs (Figures 4a-c).

Discussion
We report here the development of a multiplex RTqPCR assay for detection and differentiation of Egyptian
H5N1 HPAI viruses of clade 2.2.1 proper (p) and the
emerging 2.2.1 lineage of viruses which escape standard
vaccine-induced immunity (designated here 2.2.1v). The
assay was shown to have a detection limit of 2-5 cRNA
copies per reaction. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of
50 isolates tested [7,8], the assay is fully specific with
regard to assigning the Egyptian H5N1 isolates to either
phylogenetic cluster. No unspecific reactivity with either

non-H5 AIV or other avian pathogens was evident.
However, the assay can not be used for generic detection of subtype H5 viruses as a large percentage of nonEgyptian H5 subtype strains could not be detected.
In terms of diagnostic performance regarding the
HPAIV H5N1 strains currently circulating in Egypt, the
multiplex assay was at least equal to standard RT-qPCRs
targeting the M gene of AIV and superior to a generic
H5 RT-qPCR [23] when examining swabs which
originated from experimental infections or from field
samples of poultry holdings in Egypt. The generic H5specific RT-qPCR assay described by Slomka et al. [23]
apparently missed five Egyptian field samples, possibly
due to mismatches in binding regions of primers and/or
probes; one of the missed samples was assigned to lineage 2.2.1v while four of them belonged to 2.2.1p. In
three field samples the multiplex assay detected both
clades with almost similar Ct values (Additional file 4,
Table S4, #9, #17, #18). The field samples analysed were
derived from pooled swabs of five birds of each holding;
as such it can not be excluded that infections with both
clades occurred simultaneously at these holdings. Work
is in progress to clarify these cases by sequencing clones
of HA gene fragments. A similar situation was also
encountered with two isolates (Additional file 1, Table
S1, #3, #18); alignment of primer and probe sequences
with the published sequences of these isolates, however,
did not yield any hint for an unspecific reactivity. A
contamination of these isolates can only be excluded by
sequencing clones of HA gene fragments.
Reducing the amount of circulating HPAIV H5N1
virus by concerted actions of rapid and specific testing,
culling and vaccination of poultry is the key to mitigate
the risk of human infections and fatalities in Egypt.
Controlling the endemic HPAIV H5N1 situation in
Egypt is particularly painstaking because of [1] the concentration of the majority of commercial and backyard
poultry business in a very small part of the whole country (Nile valley and, particularly, Nile delta), [2] the
integration/contacts of backyard birds within small
commercial poultry farms (farms with 5.000-20.000
birds represent circa 75% of the poultry production), [3]
the marketing system (random uncontrolled movement
of birds to/from live bird markets), and [4] day
labourers at commercial farms usually raise backyard
birds in their houses. In addition, continuing viral evolution which is even further accelerated and skewed by
vaccination pressure remains a daily challenge for diagnostic measures which are at the root of all efforts to
control the situation. Characterization of currently circulating strains and, if required, adaptation of amplification-based diagnostic tools, such as introduced here, is
essential to improve the situation.

Conclusions
The necessity to update commercial and generic
H5-specific RT-qPCRs for the Egyptian situation has
been stressed recently [24]. The current assay provides
this update. The assay is tailored to suite the special
Egyptian situation. Therefore, the multiplex assay is not
recommended for use elsewhere, particularly in areas
where non-clade 2.2 HPAIV H5N1 are prevalent. Also,
should new lineages of HPAIV H5N1 be introduced
into Egypt, such as the 2.3.2 subclade viruses which
already escaped from Central and South-eastern Asia to
South-eastern Europe earlier in 2010, the current assay
will need updating again. In addition to detection of
clade 2.2.1p H5 HPAIV the multiplex assay also allows
the positive identification of the 2.2.1v lineage of vaccine
escape mutants. This lineage probably evolved in commercial chicken farms where vaccination using standard
LPAIV H5 strains was practiced. Recent studies have
shown that new vaccines might be required to efficiently
induce protective immunity against lineage 2.2.1v viruses
in poultry [11]. The multiplex assay therefore may also
be instrumental in decision-making regarding the type
of vaccine to be used for the specific outbreak situation.
Methods
Reference viruses and bacteria

A panel of 50 HPAIV H5N1 strains isolated in SPFchicken eggs in the National Laboratory for Quality
Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) in Egypt was
used for determination of the analytical specificity and
sensitivity of the PCR assays (Additional file 1, Table S1).
In addition 42 further avian influenza viruses of subtypes H1 [4], H2 [5], H5 [22], H6 [5], H7 [3], and H9
[3] from the repository of German National Reference
Laboratory for Avian Influenza, Friedrich-Loeffler
Institute, were analysed (Additional file 2, Table S2).
Non-orthomyxoviruses and several bacterial species
were used to further determine the specificity of the
assay.
Primer/probe design

A collection of 316 near full length H5 gene segment
sequences of H5N1 viruses circulating in Egypt between
2006 and 2010 was retrieved from the public GenBank
data base. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [25]
and manually edited. Primers and probes design were
selected from a variable region of the HA2 gene for detection of an 85 bp fragment and a more conserved region in
the HA1 gene region for detection of a 106 bp fragment
(Table 1, Figure 1). Primers P1FW-Standard-EGY, P1RVEGY and probe PRO1a-Standard-EGY were used for
detection of the clade 2.2.1p strains (HEX channel).
Primers P1FW-Variant-EGY, P1RV-EGY and probe

Abdelwhab et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:260
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/260

PRO-Variant-EGY (FAM channel) were used for detection
of the clade 2.2.1v variant strains. Primers P2FW-Standard-EGY, P2FW-Variant-EGY, P2RV-Standard-EGY and
P2RV-Variant-EGY and probe PRO2-EGY were used for
detection of both lineages via the ROX channel.
Real time RT-PCR optimization

The concentration of primers and probes was optimized in separate PCRs (two primers, one probe) and
re-adjusted when combined in the multiplex RT-qPCR
to increase the efficiency of amplification. Likewise,
different annealing temperatures ranging from 50 to
60°C and different chemistries (SuperScript III OneStep RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase [Invitrogen]; Quantitect One step kit; [Qiagen])
were evaluated. Reactions were carried out in a 25-μl
volume on an MX3005P real time PCR machine
(Stratagene).
Quantitative analysis

For preparation of standard controls, the cloned H5
gene segment from A/chicken/Egypt/0879-NLQP/2008
(clade 2.2.1v) and A/chicken/Egypt/NLQP-0918Q/2009
(clade 2.2.1p) was used for generating cRNA in vitro by
run-off transcriptions performed as previously described
[18]. Detection limit of the RT-qPCR was determined
using 10-fold serial dilutions (101-107 copies) of cRNA.
Samples from experimentally infected chickens

All animal experiments were conducted following official German animal welfare regulations (LALLF M-V/
TSD/7221.3-2.1-031/09). Six weeks old SPF chickens (n =
10, each) were infected by the oculo-nasal route with a
dose of 106.0 TCID50 of A/chicken/Egypt/0879-NLQP/
2008 (clade 2.2.1v) or A/chicken/Egypt/NLQP-0918Q/
2009 (clade 2.2.1p) (Grund et al., unpublished). RNA was
extracted from mixed oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs
collected from individual birds 2 or 7 days post infection
(dpi). RNA was used in quantitative RT-qPCRs described
in this study and compared to M and H5 based RT-qPCR
assays as previously described [14,23].
Field samples

Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected both from
poultry at commercial farms (n = 11) and backyard
holdings (n = 39) in the frame of the national surveillance scheme in poultry sectors in Egypt from 2008 to
2010. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from five birds
were pooled for RNA extraction and PCR analysis.
Nucleic acid extraction

Extraction of RNA from 140 μl of allantoic fluid (RNA
viral isolates) or swab fluid (field samples, experimental

Page 7 of 8

infections) was carried out using the QIAamp viral RNA
mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was eluted from the
columns with 50 μl of DEPC-treated water and used
immediately or after storage at -80°C. Likewise, DNA
was extracted from bacterial species and DNA viruses
(Additional file 2, Table S2) using the QIAamp DNA
mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Statistics

In addition to the descriptive evaluation of the test
results, the technical sensitivity of the new multiplex
RT-qPCR was investigated by comparing positive Ctvalues with those of the standard H5-specific RT-qPCR
test recommended by Slomka et al. [23]. For this purpose, Fisher’s exact tests were applied considering the
one-sided hypothesis of achieving lower Ct-values by
the multiplex RT-qPCR than by the standard test. All
statistical calculations have been performed using R,
Version 2.8.1 (2008-12-22) [26].
