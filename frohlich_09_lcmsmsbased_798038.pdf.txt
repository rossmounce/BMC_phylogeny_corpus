Abstract
Background: Daphniids, commonly known as waterfleas, serve as important model systems for
ecology, evolution and the environmental sciences. The sequencing and annotation of the Daphnia
pulex genome both open future avenues of research on this model organism. As proteomics is not
only essential to our understanding of cell function, and is also a powerful validation tool for
predicted genes in genome annotation projects, a first proteomic dataset is presented in this article.
Results: A comprehensive set of 701,274 peptide tandem-mass-spectra, derived from Daphnia
pulex, was generated, which lead to the identification of 531 proteins. To measure the impact of
the Daphnia pulex filtered models database for mass spectrometry based Daphnia protein
identification, this result was compared with results obtained with the Swiss-Prot and the
Drosophila melanogaster database. To further validate the utility of the Daphnia pulex database for
research on other Daphnia species, additional 407,778 peptide tandem-mass-spectra, obtained
from Daphnia longicephala, were generated and evaluated, leading to the identification of 317
proteins.
Conclusion: Peptides identified in our approach provide the first experimental evidence for the
translation of a broad variety of predicted coding regions within the Daphnia genome. Furthermore
it could be demonstrated that identification of Daphnia longicephala proteins using the Daphnia pulex
protein database is feasible but shows a slightly reduced identification rate. Data provided in this
article clearly demonstrates that the Daphnia genome database is the key for mass spectrometry
based high throughput proteomics in Daphnia.

Background
During the last two decades, genome sequencing efforts
are providing us with complete genome sequences from

researchers in almost every field of modern biology. In
addition they provide the basis for powerful technologies
to quantitatively analyze the gene expression profile on
the mRNA-level using DNA microarrays [1,2]. However, it
has to be considered that mRNA molecules are only intermediate products towards the production of functional
proteins and that protein abundance is not necessarily
reflected by the amount of the corresponding mRNA transcript [3,4]. The concentration of individual proteins at
the cellular level or in biological fluids mainly depends on
four completely different processes: (i) protein synthesis,
(ii) protein processing, (iii) protein secretion and (iv) protein degradation. As a consequence, systematic quantitative predictions of protein populations are impossible to
deduce from genomic or transcriptional data. Moreover,
proteins frequently undergo post-translational modifications (PTMs) crucial for their function, activity, and stability and they often play major roles in regulatory networks
[5]. Comprehensive datasets addressing the protein level,
therefore, are indispensable for a functional and biochemical characterization of both cells and organisms. The field
of high-throughput identification and quantification of
proteins using systematic approaches is commonly
referred to as proteomics. Recent developments in mass
spectrometry have revolutionized the field and dramatically increased the sensitivity of protein identification
compared to classical techniques like Edman sequencing.
As a consequence, large proteome investigations have
been established covering, e.g., human plasma [6],
human brain [7] and human liver [8] as well as model
organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans [9] and Drosophila melanogaster [10].
This, in turn, has led to the realization that proteomics is
not only essential to our understanding of cell function,
but in addition is a validation tool for genes predicted in
genome annotation projects. Recently published results
demonstrate that peptide mass spectrometry complements gene annotation in Drosophila [10] and humans
[11,12].
Although a multitude of whole-genome sequencing
projects ranging from microbial (e.g. [13]) to vertebrate
genomes [14] have been initiated in the last decade, no
complete genome sequence is available for crustaceans, a
species-rich taxa with additional high economical impact.
Hence, the Daphnia Genomics Consortium (DGC; http://
daphnia.cgb.indiana.edu) was founded in 2003 to
develop the waterflea Daphnia, a small planktonic crustacean, as a further model system in genomics, but with the
added advantage of being able to interpret the results in
the context of natural ecological challenges. Even though
the ecology and ecotoxicology of Daphnia has been well
studied, because they are a major link between limnetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/171

primary production and higher trophic levels, less work
has been done on the genetics of this organism. Nevertheless, their clonal reproduction, short generation times,
and their transparent body also make them well suited for
experimental molecular research.
In this special series of papers published in BMC journals,
the first description of the Daphnia pulex draft genome
sequence http://wFleaBase.org is described. Besides investigation on the DNA and mRNA level, the availability of
the Daphnia genome sequence opens the door to investigate the proteome of this fascinating species. In this article
we present the generation of a first data-set consisting of
701,274 peptide tandem-mass-spectra derived from
Daphnia pulex. In order to demonstrate the impact of the
Daphnia genome sequence on proteomics based studies
we compared the number of identified proteins using the
Daphnia protein database with the number of identifications obtained by searching against the Swiss-Prot and the
Drosophila melanogaster protein database http://fly
base.org/. To validate the utility of the Daphnia pulex
genome for research on different Daphnia species, additional 407,778 peptide tandem-mass-spectra derived
from Daphnia longicephala were generated and evaluated.
In addition, the peptides identified in our approach provide the first experimental evidence for the translation of
a broad variety of predicted coding regions within the
Daphnia genome.

Results
Sample preparation
To generate protein lysates suitable for SDS gel electrophoresis, pools of about 300 waterfleas (Daphnia pulex
and Daphnia longicelphala respectively) were homogenated. The protein concentration of the obtained lysates
(2 mL) was 2.6 mg/mL for Daphnia pulex and 2.3 mg/mL
for Daphnia longicephala corresponding to a total protein
yield of 17 g and 15 g per Daphniid, respectively.
SDS-gel pre-fractionation of Daphnia proteins
50 g of total protein from either Daphnia pulex or Daphnia longicephala, was separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis.
To evaluate the quality of the electrophoretic separation,
the gels were stained with Coomassie. An image of SDSgels derived from both Daphnia species is shown in Fig. 1.
Both samples showed sharp distinct bands, indicating
that the performed electrophoreses had good separation
strengths. To generate 10 protein fractions of each sample,
the corresponding gel lanes were cut into 10 pieces as outlined in Fig. 1. To get samples suitable for LC-MS/MS,
each gel slice was subjected to the in-gel digestion procedure described in the Methods chapter.

LC-MS/MS analysis of Daphnia pulex proteins
For the qualitative analysis of the Daphnia pulex proteome,
two samples were fractionized by SDS-gel electrophoresis
(as described in the above paragraph) and subjected to
LC-MS/MS analysis. Each of the 10 gel fractions was separated with one-dimensional reversed phase (RP) liquid
chromatography (1D-LC) and a combination of strong
cation-exchange (SCX) with RP chromatography (2D-LC)
respectively. From the 1D-LC-MS/MS runs 100,462 spectra could be collected and from the 2D-LC-MS/MS runs
600,812 spectra were acquired. All MS/MS spectra were
searched against the non-redundant filtered models database of Daphnia v1.1 gene builds (July, 2007) http://
www.jgi.doe.gov/Daphnia/ and evaluated using the PeptideProphet software. Applying a false discovery rate of =
1%, 7973 MS/MS spectra could be assigned to peptides
within the Daphnia database, of which 1654 were unique.
The assignment of peptides to proteins using the ProteinProphet algorithm led to the identification of 186 proteins with the 1D-LC-MS/MS approach and 524 proteins
with the 2D-LC-MS/MS startegy (false positive discovery
rate = 1%). As shown in Fig. 2, all except seven proteins
identified in the 1D-LC approach could be found in the
2D-LC-MS/MS dataset as well. Further analysis of the data
revealed that a significant fraction of proteins could be
identified in more than one gel slice, as summarized in

Ontology analysis of the identified proteins
To analyze the ontology of the identified Daphnia pulex
proteins the entries of the filtered models database were
BLASTp-searched http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
in the Swiss-Prot database http://www.expasy.ch[15]. We
chose the Swiss-Prot database because of its high level of
annotation, including entries about protein function,
posttranslational modifications as well as a direct link to
the Gene Ontology (GO) databases [16]. From the 531
sequences derived from the filtered models database, 499
homologue (E-values < 0.01) protein sequences could be
found. The corresponding protein Swiss-Prot IDs were
subjected to ontology analysis using the PANDORA server
http://www.pandora.cs.huji.ac.il/. The results of this
ontology analysis are shown in Fig. 4. In the "cellular
component" GO database only 139 proteins of the 499
proteins were listed. Their classification analysis revealed
that the majority (65%) are of intracellular origin and the
fraction of the particularly interesting class of membrane
proteins comprises 27%. The "molecular function" GO
revealed 350 proteins the majority of which were classified as proteins with catalytic activity. From these fractions
141 were enzymes from which 68 could be classified as

could be classified from which 175 were associated with
metabolism, 55 with cell growth and/or maintenance, 18
with cell communication, 15 with response to external
stimulus and 9 with developmental processes.
Searches of MS/MS data in the Swiss-Prot and Drosophila
melanogaster protein database
To investigate the benefit of the Daphnia pulex filtered
models database on the MS based identification of Daphnia proteins, cross-species identification, as suggested by
several authors [17,18], was performed using the Metazoa
subset of the Swiss-Prot database (Release 54.2, 78,385
entries) and the Drosophila melanogaster database from FlyBase (20,726 entries). Using the MS/MS spectra obtained
with the 2D-LC-MS/MS runs of the Daphnia pulex sample,
71 Daphnia proteins could be identified with the Drosophila database and 92 with the Swiss-Prot database with
a false-positive identification threshold of = 1%.

LC-MS/MS analysis of Daphnia longicephala proteins
To determine the suitability of the non-redundant filtered
models database of putative Daphnia pulex proteins for the
MS-based identification of proteins from other Daphnia
subgenera, a Daphnia longicephala protein lysate was generated. (A scanning electron micrograph from both, Daphnia pulex and Daphnia longicephala is shown in Fig. 5. For
the protein identification exactly the same separation
strategy as for D. pulex was used. Using this SDS-PAGE –
2D-LC-MS/MS combination and the non-redundant filtered models database of putative Daphnia pulex proteins,
we were able to identify 671 unique peptides (PeptideProphet, false discovery rate = 1%) which could be
assigned to 317 Daphnia longicephala proteins (ProteinProphet, false discovery rate = 1%). As shown in Fig. 6, 86
of these proteins could exclusively be identified in Daphnia longicephala samples but not in Daphnia pulex samples.

Discussion
General remarks
For a comprehensive functional and biochemical characterization of organisms, an inventory of their proteins and
protein modifications is a prerequisite. In the work presented here, we performed a liquid chromatography –

mass spectrometry based qualitative proteome approach
with the goal to generate a first protein catalogue of Daphnia pulex, the genome of which is presented in this special
issue. To complement gene sequences, the generation of a
broad dataset of tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra derived
from Daphnia peptides is particularly interesting for two
main reasons:
i) High throughput MS/MS protein identification is based
on the comparison of experimentally acquired peptide
MS/MS spectra with in silico generated theoretical spectra
deduced from protein databases. With a large set of MS/
MS spectra it can be tested if the Daphnia filtered models
protein database is suitable in its current form for proteomics approaches, which are mostly based on protein
identification by MS/MS.
ii) The generation of MS/MS spectra derived from Daphnia
peptides will lead to the creation of a catalogue of identified daphniid peptides. This will be one of the first data-

sets giving experimental evidence for a variety of so far
only predicted proteins. The Daphnia filtered models protein database in its current form consists of more than
30,000 entries. The corresponding genes were either
found by EST sequencing, by homology searches, or ab
initio by gene prediction algorithms. However, for the
broad majority of database entries, there is so far no experimental evidence that the corresponding genes are in fact
translated and the resulting proteins persist in the organism.
Experimental strategy
Among all presently available proteomic techniques, the
application of liquid chromatography (LC) as a separation tool combined with electrospray ionization (ESI)
[19] tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as an identification tool has the highest performance in terms of protein
identifications per time unit. This technique is referred to
as LC-MS/MS and has proven its efficiency in many studies [20-22]. Since eukaryotic proteomes consist of highly

complex mixtures, the reduction of complexity by prefractionation on the level of intact proteins prior to LCMS/MS analysis is mandatory. The number of identifications usually increases with the overall extent of prefractionation efforts. Because of its high separation strength
we choose 1D-SDS-gel electrophoresis for pre-fractionation on the protein level. In this pilot study a number of
10 gel fractions were chosen. To determine the impact of
two versus one chromatographic steps on the number of
identified peptides, we compared the results obtained
with one-dimensional reversed phase (RP) liquid chromatography (1D-LC) versus a combination of strong cation-exchange (SCX) with RP chromatography. The major
advantage of the SCX – RP combination is the removal of
salt ions from the SCX fractions in the RP step, which
would otherwise interfere with the MS-analysis of peptide
ions. For reasons of performance, we choose a fully automatic online setup, where SCX fractions are directly eluted
onto a RP trap column. This RP trap column is then
switched into the RP chromatography system to finally
separate the peptides. The SCX flow through as well as 6
salt fractions from each of the 10 gel slices were captured
and analyzed by LC-MS/MS; leading to a total number of
80 1D-LC-MS/MS runs (10 gel slices × 1 RP-LC run + 10
gel slices × 7 SCX fractions × 1 run 1 RP-LC run). From this
workflow, 701,274 MS/MS spectra were obtained.

Results obtained with LC-MS/MS
Using SDS-PAGE combined with 1D-LC-MS/MS, we identified 186 entries whereas the SDS-PAGE – 2D-LC-MS
combination led to the identification of 524 entries from
the non-redundant filtered models database of putative
Daphnia proteins demonstrating the benefit of a second
chromatographic step. In total, we were able to identify
531 non-redundant filtered models database proteins of
putative Daphnia pulex proteins. The overall list of identified proteins can be downloaded as additional file 1.

Considering that the main goal of our experiments was to
test the benefit of a dedicated Daphnia protein database
for LC-MS/MS-based proteomics, this result is promising
with respect to the straightforward design of this pilot
study. As recently demonstrated by [10], an extensive prefractionation on the level of the biological sample (e.g.
selection of different development stages), on the cellular,
on the subcellular level as well as on the level of proteins
and peptides had to be performed to get a catalogue of
thousands of experimentally identified proteins from Drosophila. Our results clearly demonstrate that LC-MS/MS
analysis combined with the usage of the Daphnia filtered
models database is able to identify hundreds of Daphnia

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:171

proteins with a high confidence level in a very efficient
way. Therefore, this methodology combined with further
pre-fractionation steps will lead to an increased analytical
depth of the Daphnia proteome.
Determination of false positive ratios
The general strategy to identify peptides by high-throughput MS/MS experiments is a probability based comparison of experimental spectra with theoretical spectra
calculated from protein databases deduced from DNA
sequences. The software algorithms determine the closest
match and a score indicating the reliability of the result.
Although this identification strategy has proven its
strength in many studies, cut-off values for the obtained
scores must be chosen carefully to minimize false-positive
identifications [23,24]. Unfortunately, there are no general rules for the confidence of given scores, because their
reliability depends on the experimental setup as well as on
the database used for the search. In our study, we applied
the commonly used Mascot [25] search engine, returning
a so called "ions score" for each peptide (for details see
http://www.matrixscience.com/. However, special care
must be taken when peptides spectra are used as evidence
for the existence of corresponding proteins. Since a given
peptide sequence can be present in multiple proteins,
these shared peptides can lead to an overestimation of the
number of identified proteins as well as to an under-estimation of the false discovery rate. An overview of this
issue was given by Nesvizhskii et al. [26]. Therefore, to validate the Mascot search results we used the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline [27] downloadable from the Seattle
Proteome
Center
http://tools.proteomecenter.org/
TPP.php. This software package includes PeptideProphet
http://peptideprophet.sourceforge.net/ to compute probabilities for identified peptides [28] and ProteinProphet
http://proteinprophet.sourceforge.net/ to address the
issue of shared peptides and to calculate the probabilities
of corresponding protein identifications [29]. To further
confirm the false positive ratio given by the Trans-Pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/171

teomic pipeline we generated a so-called decoy version of
the Daphnia pulex filtered models database consisting of
random sequences with the same average amino acid
composition. This decoy database was attached to the
original database and then used to search our MS/MS
spectra as proposed by Elias et al. [30]. Any protein hit
derived from the decoy part of the combined database was
regarded as false-positive identification. The number of
four hits from the decoy part of the database is in accordance with the 1% false discovery rate calculated by the
Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.
Proteolytic activity
The analysis of the data revealed that a significant fraction
(34%) of proteins could be identified in more than one
gel slice, as summarized in Fig. 3. A heterogeneity of
molecular masses is frequently observed in this kind of
approaches [31,32]. and may be caused by posttranscriptional events such as alternative splicing, posttranslational
modifications or proteolytic processing. While, inadequate separation strength of the gel can be excluded due
to the presence of sharp distinct bands (see Fig. 1), proteolysis of these proteins prior to electrophoresis may contribute to this heterogeneity. Proteolysis can be caused by
Daphnia proteases from the intestinal tract. The proteolytic activity of Daphnia magna gut protease was previously
described [33,34]. In preliminary studies in which we performed 2D-gel electrophoresis of Daphnia magna and
Daphnia longicephala lysates, we tried to eliminate this proteolytic activity with several commercially available protease inhibitor cocktails. The list of tested inhibitors,
including the used concentrations, is shown in Table 1.
However, the obtained spot patterns of all prepared 2Dgels still reflected significant protein degradation (Data
not shown).

As the efficient inhibition of Daphnia proteases plays a
crucial role in further quantitative proteome studies, we
screened our catalogue of identified Daphnia proteins for

proteases. In total, we have identified 19 different proteins
out of the Daphnia database showing significant homology (BLAST E-value < 0.01) to known proteases with exoas well as endopepdidase activity (Table 2). In the case of
the Daphnia trypsin proteases identified, the masses of the
detected peptides did not fit with the theoretical peptide
masses of the porcine trypsin used for digestion of the
samples. Hence, these peptides clearly originate from
Daphnia proteins. The list of Daphnia proteases in Table 2
provides a basis for further sophisticated experiments, e.g.
determination of cleavage specificities and screening for
protease inhibitors.
Usability of the D. pulex filtered models database for
proteome research on other Daphnia subgenera
In phylogenetics, the genus Daphnia is split into three subgenera, Daphnia, Hyalodaphnia and Ctenodaphnia.
Sequence divergence between those subgenera indicates
an origin in the Mesozoic [35]. Evolution under different
environmental conditions such as UV radiation, salinity
or predator regimes was certainly a key factor for diversification in this genus. To validate the utility of the Daphnia
pulex genome sequence for proteome research on differing
Daphnia species, we generated LC-MS/MS data of D. longicephala samples. D. longicephala was chosen due to the fact
that it belongs to the taxon of Ctenodaphnia, in contrast to
D. pulex which is grouped in the subgenus Daphnia. Moreover, D. longicephala is one of the most prominent examples for morphological plasticity [36] and provides an
ideal model organism for future work on the genetic basis
of the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity.

For the proteome analysis of D. longicephala, identical
amounts of total protein and the same 2D-LC-MS/MS
strategy outlined for D. pulex was used. We were able to
identify 317 proteins from the non-redundant filtered
models database of putative Daphnia pulex proteins. The
difference in number of identified proteins in D. pulex
(524 in 2D-LC-MS/MS) may well mirror the genetic divergence between both Daphnia subgenera. This finding
reflects the fact that even a single amino acid exchange in
a given peptide mostly impairs its automatic identification by MS/MS search algorithms. Nevertheless, the
number of identifications obtained from D. longicephala
samples demonstrates the suitability of the D. pulex filtered models database for proteome investigations with
other Daphnia subgenera.
Another finding is that 86 proteins were exclusively found
in the Daphnia longicepha samples as illustrated in Fig. 6.
This result might reflect different concentrations of a given
protein in lysates of D. pulex and D. longicephala, e.g.
through different metabolic activity and/or differences in
their cellular assembly. On the other hand, this result may
be due to undersampling, i.e., in highly complex samples,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/171

the number of co-eluting peptides exceeds the number of
MS/MS spectra which can be acquired by the instrument.
Therefore in individual LC-MS/MS runs, different lowintensity peptides may be selected for MS/MS analysis by
the instrument software. The overall list of identified proteins can be downloaded as additional file 2.
The impact of the D. pulex filtered models database for
proteome research of Daphniids
Although several genome projects on crustaceans are in
progress, only expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries (e.g.
[37]) or the sequence of the mitochondrial genome [38]
are available in other crustacean species. In cases where
only few protein sequences are known, it is a common
strategy to search MS/MS-data against databases of the
most related species in order to identify identical peptides
within the homologous proteins.

To estimate the impact of the D. pulex filtered models
database for high-throughput proteomics of Daphniids,
we compared the results obtained with the Daphnia database with the results obtained by searching our MS/MS
dataset against two additional databases: As a species specific database we selected the Drosophila melanogaster database from FlyBase [39] (Release 5.2; http://flybase.org/)
consisting of 20,726 protein sequences. We chose this
species because D. melanogaster, belongs to the taxon of
Hexapoda (Insecta and relatives) and is the closest relative
of Daphnia pulex with a characterized complete genome
sequence [40]. Both arthropod species belong to a group
called Pancrustacea, although monophyly of this group is
still discussed [41].
The Pancrustacean hypothesis, which is supported by
molecular analysis (e.g. [42]), queries that Myriapoda are
the closest relatives to Hexapoda but renders crustaceans
and hexapods as sister taxa. Given that the latter have
likely diverged 550 to 650 million years ago [43] and have
evolved in completely different habitats – crustaceans predominantly in aquatic, insects in terrestrial environments
– it is expected that protein expression should reflect these
evolutionary challenges. Even though some crustacean
gene families, such as genes responsible for embryonic
development are shared with Hexapoda [44], several
Daphnia genes show no sequence similarity to other
arthropods [45]. Therefore, gene transcripts different from
those of D. melanogaster might reflect adaptations to
aquatic habitats such as chemoreception, oxygen uptake
or osmoregulation.
As a protein database of a broad variety of species we
chose the Metazoa subset of the Swiss-Prot database
(Release 54.2, 78,385 entries) providing a minimum of
redundancy. To facilitate a comparison of the results
obtained with the different databases, searches of MS/MS

spectra were performed using exactly the same parameters. Setting a false-positive identification threshold of
1%, only 71 Daphnia proteins matched to the Drosophila
database and 92 to the Swiss-Prot database. This finding
clearly demonstrates that the D. pulex filtered models
database in its current form increases dramatically the
number of MS-based identifications and represents an
indispensable tool for high-throughput proteome experiments in daphniids. However, many proteins may still be
missing in the database. Therefore, yet unassigned spectra
in our data set can help to find undisclosed coding regions
within the Daphnia genome. Suitable algorithms comprise searching against the entire Daphnia genome
sequence or de-novo sequencing – MS BLAST approaches
as described by Shevchenko et al. [46]. Finally, the database supports detailed 2D gel analyses to quantify and
identify proteins. The application of the latter technique
allows the determination of isolelectric points and molecular weights of the proteins and enables the detection of
protein isoforms by comparison of experimentally determined IPs with theoretical IPs from database analysis.

Methods
Daphnia cultures
We used a laboratory-cultured clonal line of Daphnia pulex
and Daphnia longicephala for our experiments. The Daphnia pulex clone "The Chosen One" picked by the Daphnia
Genomics Consortium for the sequencing project was isolated from an ephemeral pond in Oregon (USA) whereas
Daphnia longicephala was isolated from Lara Pond (Australia).

Age-synchronized cohorts of both Daphnia species were
grown prior to the experiments by collecting mothers with
freshly deposited eggs. We cultured the latter in 30 L plastic buckets in the laboratory under constant conditions in
a temperature-controlled room at 20°C ± 0.5. Fluorescent
light was used to simulate a day-night rhythm (16 h day:
8 h night). The daphnids were fed daily with Scenedesmus
obliquus at a concentration of 1.5 mg C L-1 to avoid food
limitation. A synthetic medium based on ultra-pure water,
trace-elements and phosphate buffer, was changed weekly
[48]. 300 randomly chosen adult daphnids were collected
prior to proteome analysis.

Conclusion
Given that Daphnia is an important model organism, for
instance to test for deleterious effects of pollutants or environmental changes, the implementation of state of the art
techniques in molecular biology such as LC-MS/MS is an
auspicious opportunity to unravel mechanisms triggering
those critical environmental issues.
Our study is the first applying a LC-MS/MS based proteomic approach in Daphnia that reflects the utility of the
Daphnia genome database for molecular works on this
multifaceted model organism in several fields of biological research. Since a variety of Daphnia species are used for
different scientific approaches, for instance to elucidate
the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity in daphniids
[47] at least 20 species have been investigated intensively,
it is essential to know the reliability of the Daphnia pulex
genome sequence for studies on other species. We give
experimental evidence for the translation of a broad variety of predicted coding regions within the Daphnia
genome by using high throughput MS/MS protein identification in two Daphnia species. Our data demonstrates
the applicability of proteomics research in D. pulex as well
as in other Daphnia species. This will stimulate work on
hypothetical functions for yet unclassified proteins followed by functional experiments in this new model
organism. Moreover, proteomics techniques allow to
identify proteins linked to biological phenomena such as
induced predator defenses, host parasite-interactions or
stress responses to toxic substances.

Sample preparation
The medium containing the daphnids was filtered
through a fine sieve (mesh aperture 125 m) and immediately grounded in a pre-cooled ceramic mortar containing liquid nitrogen. For lysis, the following chemicals
were added to final concentrations of 8 M urea, 4%
CHAPS, 40 mM Tris, 65 mM DTE. If pre-fractionation by
SDS PAGE was performed, 400 M TLCK and 400 M
TCPK protease inhibitors were added.
SDS PAGE
Prior to SDS-PAGE the samples were mixed with 5× sample buffer. SDS-electrophoresis (overall gel size 7 cm (L) ×
8.5 cm (W) × 0.75 mm) was performed using a 1.5 cm 4%
stacking gel (0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% acrylamide-/bisacrylamide (37.5/1), 0.1% w/v SDS, 0.05% w/v APS, 0.1%
v/v TEMED) and a 12% separation gel (1.5 M Tris-HCl pH
8.8, 12% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (37.5/1), 0.1% w/v
SDS, 0.05% w/v APS, 0.05% v/v TEMED) with a mini-ProteanTM II device (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Gels were run
for 15 min at a constant voltage of 100 V and for additional 60 min at 200 V in SDS running buffer (25 mM Tris,
192 mM glycin, 0.1% w/v SDS). The gels were stained
overnight (50% v/v methanol, 0.05% w/v Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, 10% v/v acetic acid) and destained for at
least 8 h (5% (v/v) Methanol with 7% (v/v) acetic acid).
Gel slicing and tryptic in-gel digest
Prior to gel slicing, the gels were washed twice in water.
After washing, each gel line was cut into 10 slices using a
scalpel. Each slice was transferred in a 1.5 mL reaction
tube and equilibrated twice with 50 mM NH4HCO3 for 10

min. To reduce and block the cystein residues, the gel
slices were incubated for 45 min in 50 mM NH4HCO3/10
mM DTE at 65°C, followed by a 30 min incubation step
in 50 mM NH4HCO3 with 55 mM iodacetamide. Prior to
digestion, gel pieces were washed twice for 15 min in 50
mM NH4HCO3 and minced with a pipette tip. Tryptic
hydrolysis was performed overnight at 37°C in 30 L 50
mM NH4HCO3with 1 g porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, USA) per gel slice. The supernatant was collected and
preserved. The peptides were further extracted with 50 L
50 mM NH4HCO3 and a subsequent treatment using 50
L 80% ACN. Both extraction steps were performed for 5
min under sonification (Sonorex RK100, Bandelin, Berlin,
Germany). The ACN supernatant and the NH4HCO3 fractions were combined and concentrated to a volume of 10
L using a SpeedVac concentrator (Bachover, Vacuum
Concentrator). Prior to 2D-LC-MS/MS analysis the peptide were desalted using Pepclean C-18 spin columns
(Pierce) as described by the manufacturer.
1D-LC separation
The 1D-nano-LC separation was performed on a multidimensional liquid chromatography system (Ettan
MDLC, GE Healthcare). Peptides were loaded on a RP trap
column with a flow-rate of 6 L per min (Loading buffer:
0.1% formic acid; Trap column: C18 PepMap 100, 5 m
bead size, 300 m i.d., 5 mm length, LC Packings) and
subsequently separated with an analytical column (C18
PepMap 100, 3 m bead size, 75 m i.d.; 15 cm length, LC
Packings) with a 72 min linear gradient (A: 0.1% formic
acid, B: 84% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of
260 nL/min.
2D-LC separation
The 2D-nano-LC separation was performed on a multidimensional liquid chromatography system (Ettan
MDLC, GE Healthcare). An online salt step configuration
was chosen, in which 10 g of the desalted peptide mixture was injected onto a 50 × 0.32 mm SCX column (BioBasic, Thermo Electron) and eluted at a flow rate of 6 L/
min with 6 discrete salt plugs of increasing salt concentration (10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 800 mM NH4Cl in 0.1%
formic acid and 5% ACN). The eluted peptides were
bound on a RP trap column (C18 PepMap 100, 5 m, 300
m i.d. 5 mm, LC Packings) and subsequently separated
on the second-dimension RP column (C18 PepMap 100,
3 m, 75 m i.d. 15 cm, LC Packings) with a 72 min linear
gradient (A: 0.1% formic acid, B: 84% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 260 nL/min.
Mass spectrometry
Mass spectrometry was performed on a linear ion trap
mass spectrometer (Thermo LTQ, Thermo Electron)
online coupled to a nano-LC system. For electrospray ionization a distal coated SilicaTip (FS-360-50-15-D-20) and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/171

a needle voltage of 1.4 kV was used. The MS method consisted of a cycle combining one full MS scan (Mass range:
300–2000 m/z) with three data dependant MS/MS events
(35% collision energy). The dynamic exclusion was set to
30 s.
Database search and data analysis
The MS/MS data were searched with Mascot Version:
2.1.03 (Matrix Science, Boston, USA) using the following
parameters: i) Enzyme: Trypsin, ii) Fixed Modification:
Carbamidomethyl (C), iii) Variable modifications: Oxidation (M); iv) Peptide tol. 2 Da, v) MS/MS tol. 0.8 Da, vi)
Peptide charge 1+, 2+ and 3+, vii) Instrument ESI-TRAP
and viii) Allow up to 1 missed cleavages. Mascot results
were further validated with the open source software
"Trans-Proteomic Pipeline" (TPP) V3.5 freely available
from the Seattle Proteome Center http://tools.proteome
center.org/TPP.php. Therefore the Mascot DAT files were
first converted to mzXML, merged and evaluated on the
peptide level with the built-in PeptideProphet tool. To
generate the list of identified proteins (false positive discovery rate of = 1%) the ProteinProphet tool was used.
Furthermore, randomized versions of the applied databases were appended to the original databases using the
decoy perl script (Matrix Science, Boston, USA) downloadable
at
http://www.matrixscience.com/help/
decoy_help.html. The number of false positive identifications (randomized sequences) using the Mascot/TPP
combination and the corresponding probability thresholds was determined.
Ontology analysis
Protein entries from the Daphnia filtered models database
v1.1 were BLASTp-searched http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
/BLAST/ in the Swiss-Prot database http://www.expasy.ch.
Homologue protein entries (E-values < 0.01) were subjected to ontology analysis using the PANDORA server
http://www.pandora.cs.huji.ac.il/.
