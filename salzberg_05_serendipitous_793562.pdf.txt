Background: The Trace Archive is a repository for the raw, unanalyzed data generated by largescale genome sequencing projects. The existence of this data offers scientists the possibility of
discovering additional genomic sequences beyond those originally sequenced. In particular, if the
source DNA for a sequencing project came from a species that was colonized by another organism,
then the project may yield substantial amounts of genomic DNA, including near-complete genomes,
from the symbiotic or parasitic organism.

Large-scale sequencing projects continue to generate a growing number of new genomes from an ever-wider range of species. A rarely noted and unappreciated side effect of some
projects occurs when the organism being sequenced contains

an intracellular endosymbiont. In some cases, the existence of
the endosymbiont is unknown to both the sequencing center
and the laboratory providing the source DNA. Fortunately,
many genome projects deposit all their raw sequence data
into a publicly available, unrestricted repository known as the

interactions

Conclusions: The results of this study reveal an unexpected benefit of depositing raw data in a
central genome sequence repository: new species can be discovered within this data. The
differences between these three new Wolbachia genomes and the previously sequenced strain
revealed numerous rearrangements and insertions within each lineage and hundreds of novel genes.
The three new genomes, with annotation, have been deposited in GenBank.

Results: By searching the publicly available repository of DNA sequencing trace data, we
discovered three new species of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis in three different
species of fruit fly: Drosophila ananassae, D. simulans, and D. mojavensis. We extracted all sequences
with partial matches to a previously sequenced Wolbachia strain and assembled those sequences
using customized software. For one of the three new species, the data recovered were sufficient
to produce an assembly that covers more than 95% of the genome; for a second species the data
produce the equivalent of a 'light shotgun' sampling of the genome, covering an estimated 75-80%
of the genome; and for the third species the data cover approximately 6-7% of the genome.

Trace Archive [1]. By conducting large-scale searches of the
Trace Archive, one can discover the presence of these endosymbionts and, with the aid of bioinformatics tools including
genome assembly algorithms, reconstruct some or most of
the endosymbiont genomes.
The amount of endosymbiont DNA present in a genome
deposited in the Trace Archive depends on several factors: the
number of sequences generated by the project, the size of the
host genome, the size of the endosymbiont genome, and the
number of copies of the endosymbiont present in each cell of
the host. Because the copy number varies among cell types,
the amount of endosymbiont DNA also depends on the preparation method used to extract host DNA; for example, the
use of eggs or early-stage embryos will yield much greater
amounts of Wolbachia from its hosts, because the bacterium
occurs in much higher copy numbers in egg cells than in other
cell types [2]. If the host genome is 200 million base-pairs
(Mbp) in length, and the endosymbiont is 1 Mbp, and if there
is one endosymbiont per host cell, then 0.5% of the sequences
from a random sequencing project of the host will derive from
the endosymbiont. The critical factor is the copy number per
cell: regardless of genome size, if there is one endosymbiont
genome per cell, then the endosymbiont will be sequenced to
the same depth of coverage as the host, and the genome
assembly will, in theory, cover both genomes to the same
extent.
The search for these hidden genomes is aided greatly by the
availability of a complete genome of a related species. Fortunately, the complete genome of Wolbachia pipientis wMel, an
endosymbiont of D. melanogaster [3], is available to aid the
search. Wolbachia species are common obligate intracellular
parasites that infect a wide variety of invertebrates, including
not only fruit flies but also mosquitoes, arthropods and nematodes [4,5].

Results and discussion

Using the 1,267,782 bp wMel genome as a probe, we searched
the Trace Archive entries of seven recently sequenced Drosophila species, each of which was sequenced to approximately eightfold coverage. For three of these species, we
found clear evidence of Wolbachia infections in the host.
From the 2,772,509 traces of Drosophila ananassae [6], we
retrieved 32,720 sequences that either matched the wMel
strain or were paired with sequences that matched wMel (see
Materials and methods). Our assembly of these sequences
yielded a new genome, Wolbachia wAna, containing
1,440,650 bp in 329 separate scaffolds, at approximately
eightfold coverage. At this coverage depth, we estimate that
98% of the wAna genome is included in the assembly. The
alignment of the wAna scaffolds to wMel covers approximately 878 kbp (70%) of the 1.27 Mb wMel genome. A map-

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/3/R23

ping of all the individual wAna reads to wMel gives greater
coverage - 1.11 Mbp (87%) of the wMel genome.
From the 2,214,248 traces of D. simulans [7], we retrieved
and assembled 3,727 sequences. The resulting genome fragments of Wolbachia wSim cover 896,761 bp of wSim at twofold coverage, which we estimate to cover 65-80% of wSim.
The comparative assembly (see Materials and methods)
resulted in 388 contigs plus 241 singleton sequences, and a
separate scaffolding program further grouped 273 of these
contigs into 84 scaffolds. The alignment between wSim and
wMel covers 861 kbp (65%) of the wMel genome.
From the 2,445,065 traces of D. mojavensis [6], we retrieved
101 sequences matching wMel, plus another 13 sequences
that did not match wMel but were paired with the matching
sequences. The sample is too small for assembly, but even so
it represents approximately 87 kb (6-7%) of the Wolbachia
wMoj genome.
No Wolbachia sequences were found in the other Drosophila
species currently available: D. pseudoobscura, D. yakuba, D.
virilis and D. melanogaster.
Wolbachia has previously been described to infect multiple
strains of D. simulans, and a fragment of the 16S ribosomal
RNA gene has been sequenced (GenBank ID AF312372) [8].
It has also been described in D. ananassae [9], but has not
been previously reported in D. mojavensis (and no sequences
can be found in the Wolbachia database maintained at [10]).

Genome organization
Comparison of the wAna and wMel species indicates extensive rearrangements between the genomes. This is best illustrated with the longest scaffold in wAna, which contains
455,845 bp, approximately one-third of the genome. Figure 1
shows a map of this scaffold compared to the wMel genome.
The scaffold spans more than a dozen rearrangements that
have occurred since the divergence of these species. We also
found evidence of rearrangements within our wAna
sequences (see Materials and methods), indicating that the D.
ananassae strain may have been infected with two or more
divergent Wolbachia strains. The rearrangements shown in
Figure 1 are typical of the interstrain alignments; breakpoints
occur even among the very sparsely sampled wMoj
sequences. Although only 101 sequences matched wMel,
seven of these spanned either insertions or large-scale rearrangements in the wMel genome.

Genome comparisons
In these assemblies, approximately 464, 92 and 6 genes were
discovered in the wAna, wSim and wMoj genomes, respectively (see Additional data file 1), that were not found in the
previously reported W. pipientis wMel genome. Of these
novel genes, 343 were conserved hypothetical proteins, 81
transposases, 13 phage-related proteins and seven ankyrin

The wSim genome was assembled using the comparative assembler, AMOS-Cmp, and scaffolded using Bambus. The wAna genome was assembled
using the Celera Assembler, as described in Materials and methods. Note that the high gene count for wAna is likely due to fragmentation of
individual genes across separate contigs.

We aligned all genomes to one another to find those
sequences shared by all four strains. Because W. pipientis
wMoj comprises the smallest sample, we used the 114
sequences from that strain as a query to search the other three
strains, and found 90 sequences shared among all strains. We
then created four-way multi-alignments for each of these 90
sequences (see Materials and methods). Excluding the large
insertions and deletions discussed above, the strains are
highly similar, as summarized in Table 2.

information

As the table shows, the two most closely related strains are
wAna and wSim, which are nearly identical at the DNA level.
Both wMel and wMoj are approximately equidistant from
these two strains, at just over 97% identity, but are more distant from one another. Note however that because the wMoj
sequences are single reads (that is, single-pass sequencing),
the error rate in these sequences is substantially higher than

Region A includes the 3'-region of the WO-A phage and the
region directly downstream. It includes the interval containing genes WD0289-WD0296, which encodes four
hypothetical proteins - three ankyrin repeat domain proteins
and a conserved hypothetical protein. The absence of
WD0289-WD0292 is interesting because it may suggest
some variation in the phage 3'-region. Although WD0289WD00291 is unique to WO-A, a protein homologous to
WD0292 has been found in the previously described Wol-

refereed research

Two large gene clusters in W. pipientis wMel were not identified in the wSim and wAna assemblies (Figure 2). This could
suggest absence or divergence of these regions. The lack of the
recovery of two of the regions (A and B) is interesting as both
regions contain genes that have been suggested to affect hostendosymbiont interactions [3].

Region B includes WD0509-WD0514, which encodes a DNA
mismatch repair protein MutL-2, a degenerate ribonuclease,
a conserved hypothetical protein, two hypothetical proteins
and an ankyrin repeat domain protein. This region is of further interest since WD0511-WD0514 is found only in W. pipientis wMel and not the related sequenced Anaplasmataceae,
Rickettsiaceae or α-Proteobacteria. In W. pipientis wMel,
this region is flanked on the 3'-end by an interrupted reverse
transcriptase and an IS5 transposase, supporting the hypothesis that it was acquired horizontally. The absence of MutL-2
might not be functionally important since wMel, wAna, and
wSim all have a copy of MutL-1.

deposited research

Consistent with the observation that novel genes in the new
Wolbachia strains tend to be hypothetical proteins, genes
present in wMel that are absent in the wAna assembly are
also predominantly hypothetical proteins. Of the 347 wMel
genes not found in wAna, 207 were hypothetical proteins,
with the next highest category being mobile elements and
extrachromosomal elements, with 37 genes. This suggests
that as much as 27% of the predicted genes in wMel could be
highly variable.

bachia phage [3,11]). Variation in the Wolbachia phage could
facilitate the introduction of novel genes [12]. As ankyrin
repeat proteins, WD0291, WD0292, and WD0294 are all of
interest as they have been proposed to be involved in hostinteraction functions [3]. This could provide a means by
which the phage could cause different host-interaction
phenotypes.

domain proteins. Of the remaining 118 genes, 34 are proteins
from the wAna assembly of insect origin, which are likely to
represent Drosophila contaminants as a result of chimeric
inserts in the original sequencing library. Another 51 predicted genes are shorter than 300 bp and may not constitute
real genes. The remaining 33 genes have similarity to known
genes and include genes that have tentatively been identified
to be involved in transport, DNA binding or regulation, and a
variety of other functions. Many of the unique genes have
anomalous GC content, suggesting horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), with 12 genes displaying a GC content greater than
50% as opposed to the typical 35% GC content found in these
genomes and wMel (Table 1).

assemblies are marked on the outside (regions A, B).

Ankyrin repeat domain proteins
Ankyrin repeat proteins showed considerable variability
among the four Wolbachia strains. It has been proposed that
ankyrin repeat proteins may influence the host by regulating
host cell cycle, regulating host cell division, and interacting
with the host cytoskeleton [3]. These genes and their relationship to cell cycle, and therefore reproduction, are likely candidates for involvement in host interactions like cytoplasmic
incompatibility, male killing, parthenogenesis and
feminization.
There were four ankyrin repeat proteins absent in wAna and
wSim in the Regions A and B above. There were also seven
new ankyrin repeat proteins identified in wAna, wSim, and
wMoj. In order to infer a relationship between the ankyrin
repeat proteins, all the ankyrin repeat-containing proteins
greater than 120 amino acids in length were aligned and
clustered using ClustalW. The amino-acid sequences were too
diverse to permit the construction of a reliable phylogenetic
tree. But a tree was drawn that clustered similar proteins and
allowed for the classification of families of conserved ankyrin
repeat domain proteins within the Wolbachia lineage (Figure
3). From this tree, several classes of proteins can be determined that are highly conserved between two or more of these
Wolbachia lineages with greater than 95% similarity at the
nucleotide level. In addition, ankyrin repeat domain proteins
unique to a particular lineage can also be identified. These
differences in the complement of ankyrin repeat domain proteins may affect host-endosymbiont interactions.

Comparison with other obligate intracellular bacteria
The variability of genome content and synteny identified here
with Wolbachia is in contrast to that observed for other obligate intracellular bacteria. Comparative analysis of the
Chlamydiaceae shows that the genomes of these organisms
are highly conserved in terms of content and gene order, with
relatively small differences in the genomes [13]. This is
despite the fact that the chlamydial genomes sequenced thus
far span four distinct species from various hosts and cause
different tissue tropism and disease pathology.
Similarly, rickettsial genomes have a high degree of synteny
and gene conservation with the exception of numerous
unique sequences in the genome of Rickettsia conorii [14].
Although R. conorii maintains synteny with Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi, it has 560 unique genes relative to
the other two. In contrast, the sequencing of R. typhi revealed
only 24 novel genes.
Wolbachia genomes seem to have little synteny [3] and large
variations in genome size and genome content. This may
reflect the levels of intraspecies contact in vivo. Wolbachia
are abundant in nature, are able to co-infect arthropods
[15,16], and are propagated by vertical and horizontal transmission [17]. Phylogenetic analysis of the WO-B phage shows
that under conditions of co-infection, Wolbachia from different supergroups will share the same WO-B phage [12]. These
factors may promote genetic exchange between Wolbachia
species. In addition, the Wolbachia lifestyle of facilitating its

own transmission by host reproductive modification may
then promote the successful transmission of genetically
diverse strains. Other obligate intracellular bacterial genera
may find the series of events involving successful co-infection, exchange of genetic information, and then propagation
more challenging and therefore less likely.

Horizontal gene transfer
The presence of endosymbionts within host cells, particularly
germline cells, may offer opportunities for HGT, although in
general such transfer between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is
extremely rare [18]. However, a number of studies have
clearly documented cases of transfer of mitochondrial DNA
into the nuclear genome [19], in species as diverse as yeast
[20], Arabidopsis thaliana [21] and other plants [22], and
human [23]. The mitochondrial organelle itself is widely
believed to derive from an ancestral endosymbiont [19,24].
Although we do not here provide evidence for HGT from Wolbachia to Drosophila, at least one recent study claims that a
Wolbachia endosymbiont has transferred genes to the X
chromosome of an insect, the adzuki bean beetle [25]. The
analysis of the wMel genome examined this question, but did
not find any evidence for HGT into the D. melanogaster host
[3].

Conclusions

The discovery of these three new genomes demonstrates how
powerful the public release of raw sequencing data can be.
Although none of these projects had as its goal the sequencing
of bacterial endosymbionts, we now have as a result three
partial genomes - one nearly complete - of this biologically
important species. The differences between these genomes
and the completed wMel strain demonstrate extensive
genome rearrangement and divergence among these Wolbachia endosymbionts. And although it is a small sample,
when taken together the presence of these three new genomes
indicates that Wolbachia endosymbionts appear to be quite
common in the Drosophila lineage. Multiple future Drosophila sequencing projects are planned, several of which are
already underway, as are projects to sequence other invertebrates, many of which may host Wolbachia or other endosymbionts. Our results suggest that new screening methods,

97.3

such as those described here, may yield unexpected discoveries from the data in the Trace Archive.

Materials and methods

We downloaded from the Trace Archive at NCBI [1] the following numbers of raw sequences from each Drosophila species: 2,772,509 sequences from D. ananassae; 2,445,065
from D. mojavensis; 2,214,248 from D. simulans; 2,061,010
from D. yakuba; 3,359,782 from D. virilis; 2,590,703 from D.
pseudoobscura; and 3,663,352 from D. melanogaster. For
each project, we downloaded sequences, quality values, and
ancillary data (containing clone-mate information, clone
insert lengths, and sometimes trimming parameters),
comprising approximately 2-3 gigabytes (GB) of compressed
data per genome.
For each genome, we used the nucmer program from the
MUMmer package [26-28] to search the complete genome of
W. pipientis wMel against the files containing the sequences.
We pulled out any single sequence ('read') with at least one
30-bp exact match to wMel, and with an extended match that
spanned at least 65 bp. We then retrieved the 'clone mates' of
each sequence: most of the reads in whole-genome sequencing projects are obtained via a double-ended shotgun method,
meaning that both ends of each clone insert are sequenced.
The Trace Archive contains a link to the clone mate for each
read; we used this information to extract any mates that were
not contained in our original screen. For example, the D.
ananassae data yielded approximately 5,000 additional
reads when we pulled in the mates from the original set.
We then assembled the Wolbachia reads in two different
ways: with the Celera Assembler [29], treating it as a normal
(de novo) whole-genome assembly, and with the AMOS-cmp
assembler [30], which assembles a genome by mapping it
onto a reference. For the reference genome we used wMel.
We used Celera Assembler on the relatively well-covered
wAna strain; although we ran it on the wSim reads as well,
the sequence coverage was too light to yield a good assembly.
The high degree of sequence identity, at 95-100% across most
regions that are shared between strains, allowed for an excel-

searches were used to determine what genes are absent in the
wAna, wSim, and wMoj assemblies. DNA sequence matches
at 80% identity for 80% length of the smaller of the genes
were determined to be conserved and are plotted in Figure 2.
Regions A and B in Figure 2 were identified in this manner.
To identify the unique genes in the wAna, wSim, and wMoj
assemblies, all predicted proteins were searched against the
wMel proteins using Blastp. Proteins in the new genomes
were considered unique (or highly divergent) when the best
match in wMel had an E-value greater than 10-15.

All ankyrin repeat domain proteins identified by automated
annotation were compiled and an alignment and tree were
constructed using ClustalW [35]. The ankyrin repeat domain
is a degenerate repeat [36], so no attempt was made to cluster
proteins where the ankyrin repeat motifs were removed.

refereed research

The whole-genome shotgun assemblies, with annotation,
have been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the
project
accession
AAGB00000000
(wAna)
and
AAGC00000000 (wSim). The versions described in this
paper are the first versions, AAGB01000000 and
AAGC01000000. The sequences and annotation for wMoj
have consecutive accessions AY897435 through AY897548.
The unassembled wMoj reads are also available from the
Trace Archive and from the Additional data files for this
paper.

deposited research

The wAna assembly presented special challenges because of
what appear to be a large number of rearrangements and polymorphisms within the sequences. The number of Wolbachia
reads provided very deep coverage, which in principle should
have produced a scaffold that covered nearly the entire
genome. However, a large number of clone-mate links were
inconsistent with one another, indicating that the reads may
have been drawn from a population in which many of the
individuals had genome rearrangements with respect to one
another. We also found locations spanning hundreds of
nucleotides where four or five individual reads had one nucleotide and the same number had a different nucleotide. These
polymorphisms made it difficult to create many consistent
large scaffolds. We created multiple assemblies in which we
removed many of the inconsistent links, and eventually settled on the assembly presented here as the best representative
of the genome possible given the diversity in the data. The
wAna assembly has three large scaffolds of 460 kb, 157 kb,
and 121 kb respectively, with all remaining scaffolds less than
20 kb in length. We also include a list of all the individual
sequences, including those not incorporated into contigs, in
our Additional data files.

To create the multiple alignments of the 90 sequences that
were shared by all four organisms, we searched the 114
sequences in wMoj against the wMel, wAna, and wSim
genome assemblies, again using nucmer. We used the output
of nucmer to extract from each genome the appropriate
matching sequence, and we fed the results to the overlapper
(hash-overlap) from the AMOS assembler [30] to generate all
pairwise sequence alignments.

reports

For wAna, when we compared the de novo and comparative
assemblies, we observed that there were multiple rearrangements in the wAna genome as compared to wMel. Our conclusion was that a comparative assembly, which relies on the
genome structure of the reference, may be less accurate than
a de novo assembly in the presence of extensive rearrangements, so we used the latter for our analysis.

reviews

The AMOS-cmp assembly of wSim contains 388 contigs plus
another 241 singleton reads, covering 896,761 bp (see Table
1). The largest contig contains 16,701 bp. Note that AMOScmp produces contigs but not scaffolds. The contigs can easily
be aligned to the reference genome to produce scaffolds, with
the caveat that any rearrangements will invalidate such scaffolding information. To avoid such problems, we ordered and
oriented the contigs separately with Bambus [31], a standalone genome scaffolding program, using only the clone-mate
information from the original shotgun data. Bambus created
84 multi-contig scaffolds that joined together 273 of the 388
contigs, with the largest scaffold containing 50,851 bp and
spanning (including estimated gaps) 54,207 bp.

information

To annotate the resulting sets of contigs, we used Glimmer
[32,33] to make initial gene calls and BLAST [34] to search
those calls against a comprehensive protein database.
Regions with no gene calls were searched as well in all six
reading frames using Blastx.
