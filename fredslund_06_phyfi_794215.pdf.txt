Abstract
Background: The need to depict a phylogeny, or some other kind of abstract tree, is very
frequently experienced by researchers from a broad range of biological and computational
disciplines. Thousands of papers and talks include phylogeny figures, and often during everyday
work, one would like to quickly get a graphical display of, e.g., the phylogenetic relationship
between a set of sequences as calculated by an alignment program such as ClustalW or the
phylogenetic package Phylip. A wealth of software tools capable of tree drawing exists; most are
comprehensive packages that also perform various types of analysis, and hence they are available
only for download and installing. Some online tools exist, too.
Results: This paper presents an online tool, PHY·FI, which encompasses all the qualities of existing
online programs and adds functionality to hopefully eliminate the need for post-processing the
phylogeny figure in some other general-purpose graphics program. PHY·FI is versatile, easy-to-use
and fast, and supports comprehensive graphical control, several download image formats, and the
possibility of dynamically collapsing groups of nodes into named subtrees (e.g. "Primates"). The user
can create a color figure from any phylogeny, or other kind of tree, represented in the widely used
parenthesized Newick format.
Conclusion: PHY·FI is fast and easy to use, yet still offers full color control, tree manipulation, and
several image formats. It does not require any downloading and installing, and thus any internet user
regardless of computer skills, and computer platform, can benefit from it. PHY·FI is free for all and
is available from this web address: http://cgi-www.daimi.au.dk/cgi-chili/phyfi/go

Background
Many researchers from a wide range of biological and
computational disciplines have a recurrent need for
depicting trees of various forms, e.g. phylogenies. Often,
the tree is represented as a text string or file in the parenthesized Newick format. This is true for phylogenies produced by software such as the Phylip package [1] or
ClustalW [2]. For example, when performing a multiple
alignment of sequences with ClustalW, apart from the

alignment itself a dendrogram file is produced with extension .dnd, and this file contains a Newick representation
of the phylogeny inferred from aligning the sequences.
From the rather incomprehensible textual description of a
Newick tree, humans can learn little about the overall tree
structure or of the relationship between particular nodes:

57):0.54939,Mouse:1.2146);
Hence, for full comprehension of the tree structure,
researchers will need a graphical image of the tree to benefit from the information it encodes. This paper presents
PHY·FI, a new tool for drawing such Newick trees. The
strengths of PHY·FI are these:
• It is web based; i.e., no need to download and install
anything. It works from any computer connected to the
internet, and the user has the tree in seconds, displayed in
the browser.
• The tree can be manipulated directly in the browser:
Nodes (subtrees) can be collapsed and expanded.
• The image can be downloaded in the most common formats. (By request, new formats can easily be added).
• The user-interface is self-explanatory.
• The user has full color control over nodes, labels, etc.
• Several other graphical parameters can be modified by
the user.
• The user can redraw the image and immediately observe
the changes after tuning the parameters.
There is a wealth of existing software programs which can
draw phylogenies. Some of these programs are full phylogenetic inference packages which include the facility to
draw trees, while others are developed specifically for tree
drawing. Before going into depth with PHY·FI, I will give
a brief overview.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/315

such trees by collapsing and expanding nodes interactively. There is an online version, too (which has not been
maintained and currently seems not to be functional, but
the author offers to update it upon demand): In order to
explore one's own trees rather than the given example
trees, one must give read access to one's home directory to
the program Java applet (in general, this would constitute
a somewhat liberal security policy) and create a new directory with a specific name which must hold the trees.
It is also possible to create phylogeny figures from within
several programming environments such as the statistical
computing programming language R [19], the text
processing system LaTeX through G. Savva's Newick tree
package [20], and BioPerl using the cladogram drawing
module developed by G. Valiente [21].
For all of the above, one needs to at least do some downloading and installing – and in many cases one needs to
write computer code – to draw a phylogeny. A few programs, however, do have a web interface and are as such
directly comparable to PHY·FI. Phylodendron by D. G.
Gilbert [22] presents the user with several choices of tree
style and appearance as well as different formats for the
output image. Not all combinations of parameter settings
seem to be fully implemented, though. The images are in
black and white and have no branch length labels (only a
rule).
V. Veeramachaneni has written a program with the name
TreeDraw [23]. It presents a simple user interface,
although one needs to manually type in a color encoding
if one wants the leaves in the tree to be colored. The program can produce images in the PS, PDF and PNG formats, but again branch lengths have to be judged by visual
inspection with the help of a ruler. The user has no control
over the image size and cannot paste a Newick string
directly on the web page.

Most existing programs are for download and local installation only. Some are very elaborate and allow user postprocessing through interaction and reshaping of the tree
via mouse clicks in the produced image; others are more
straight-forward and have fewer degrees of freedom.
Sophisticated programs for download and local installation include TREEGRAPH [3], Bosque [4], ATV [5],
TREEVIEW [6], NJplot [7], MEGA [8], Mesquite [9], Phylodraw [10], TreeIllustrator [11] and the commercial programs Paup [12], MacClade [13] and TreeMe [14]. Arbor
3D [15] and Walrus [16] are tools for visualizing and
interacting with trees in three dimensions. A simpler program, also for download, is DrawTree [17] by T. Mailund.

Drawtree [24], written by R. Ree, also has a web interface
where you can paste a Newick string and create a black
and white PDF or EPS image with little control over the
result.

The elaborate program TreeWiz [18] can handle huge
trees with up to 50,000 leaves and lets the user explore

T-Rex [26] is an elaborate analysis program which offers
sophisticated functionality in terms of, e.g., tree inference.

J. Felsenstein's Phylip software [1] also includes the web
tool Drawtree [25]. This program lets the user draw black
and white images of trees in the PS format and numerous
other printer-friendly formats; however, branch length
labels seemingly cannot be added to the trees, and the
resulting tree image is not immediately shown but has to
be downloaded and viewed with some other appropriate
application.

When it comes to displaying trees, it offers several different graphical tree shapes, it allows limited control over the
coloring of labels and branches (colors are chosen from a
fixed list), and per default it cleverly scales the image to fit
the browser window. However, the user cannot upload a
Newick tree file but has to paste the string in a text field
directly (which is less than optimal for large trees); there
is no control over font or font size; branches seem to be
drawn with the same length even though in the Newick
string, all nodes must have given (not necessarily identical) lengths in order for the parser to work; and finally,
not all correctly formatted Newick strings seem to pass the
parser.
Lastly, PhyloView [27] is a web based visualization tool
which can illustrate the potential differences between the
deduced phylogeny of a protein sequence alignment and
the taxonomic relationship of the species of the
sequences. The user uploads a Newick tree and can then
decide any taxonomic partition for the species and choose
a coloring. Thus, the aim of the program is not merely displaying Newick trees, and therefore no further control
over the tree image is possible.
Implementation
The web based program PHY·FI presented here is an
attempt to combine the tree drawing facilities of all these
tools into one fast, easy-to-use web tool. On the very simple front page (shown in Figure 1), the user either uploads
a Newick tree file or pastes a Newick string directly (or
chooses the available demo file), and after clicking the
"draw" button, within a few seconds the user is presented
with the resulting image. Figure 2 shows the Newick string
quoted in the previous section as it may be illustrated by
PHY·FI.

The tree is drawn left-to-right with leaf nodes on the right,
and such that no branches will cross. The image height is
initially calculated from the number of leaves to ensure
that the labels will be readable – for large trees, this leads
to large images, and of course the user may choose to
change the image height (as described below). The length
of a branch is written directly beside it at an angle which
can be set by the user; the user may also choose to instead
indicate branch lengths by a rule (drawn in the lower left
corner) if the branch labels disturb the overall image. The
branches, leaf nodes, internal nodes, node labels, branch
labels, rule, and collapsed subtrees (described in the next
paragraph) all have their own colors which are set to
pleasant, readable defaults, but which may be altered by
the user. Colors are chosen in a very intuitive way by clicking with the mouse in two color palettes indicating color
hue/value and saturation. By the click of one button, the
user may also use greyscale colors (as prescribed by some

journals). Figure 3 shows a screen shot of the color choice
menu.
After the image is displayed, the user has the opportunity,
on the same page, to modify several parameters (as shown
in Figure 4). The first group of parameters concerns the
image in general: Image width and height (which resizes
the tree since the drawing will scale to fit the chosen image
size), the font, and the download format (the format of
the image file which can be subsequently downloaded to
the user's computer; PNG, JPG, GIF, TIF, PDF, EPS). The
second group of parameters concerns the nodes: The node
size and the node label font size. The third group concerns
the branches: Branch thickness, whether and how branch
lengths should be shown (by labels and/or by a rule) and
the angle in which branch labels are written, and the font
size of branch labels. Lastly, the user may choose a name
which will be given to the next collapsed node; to collapse
and rename a node rooting some subtree, the user types
the name to be given to the node in the text field, presses
the 'Enter' key, and then clicks on the node directly in the
image. This has been done in Figure 4. Collapsed subtrees
may be re-created (expanded) by clicking their root nodes
again.

Thus, if the image is initially not quite satisfactory, e.g. if
some of the node labels appear too close to one another,
or if some part of the tree is irrelevant for the user's specific
purpose, or if the colors are not quite right, the user simply performs a few modifications by tuning parameters
and collapsing nodes, and then clicks the "redraw" button. [See Additional file 1 for more technical details]. After
drawing the tree with the desired download format
selected, the user clicks the 'download' button to download the image to his/her own computer.

Results and discussion
PHY·FI has been extensively tested on Windows, Linux,
and Mac platforms using Firefox 1.0, Internet Explorer
6.0, Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.7.12, and Safari 2.0.3. Trees
with up to 3600 nodes were uploaded (for a tree of this
size, the image is produced within about 13 seconds).
Very large trees yield very large images initially, but the
assumption is that the user in such cases intends to collapse parts of the tree in order to get an apprehensible fig-

ure out of it. To be able to pinpoint and click specific
nodes to collapse them, the user needs to be able to read
the labels, and so rather than use some smaller default
image height, I have chosen to let the initial height be proportional to the number of leaves in the tree (within a
limit of 20,000 pixels, corresponding to an image file size
of about 1 Megabyte). The user can always decrease (or
increase) the image height and width if (s)he wishes, for
instance after creating more empty space by collapsing the
irrelevant parts of the tree. Thus, a satisfactory result
should always be reachable. Hopefully, the collapse/
expand feature may, in conjunction with the regular
graphical parameters, relieve the user of any need for postprocessing of the image in some other general graphics
application.
From the PHY·FI homepage, there is a direct hyperlink to
a page describing the Newick standard [28] which the
parser expects the input string to follow. According to this
standard, internal nodes can be named. Instead of provid-

To use the new colors, the user clicks the 'redraw' button. Otherwise, (s)he may click the 'cancel' button – or the 'greyscale'
button to use greyscale colors.

ing string names for (internal) nodes, the user may of
course put bootstrap values. PHY·FI does not distinguish
between node names and bootstrap values; both are written next to the relevant node in the same color. Thus, to
avoid confusion, users should probably not upload input
strings in which some nodes have bootstrap values and
others have labels.
Several programs, e.g. [22,26], offer various tree drawing
styles, such as cladograms and radial trees, rather than just
one. PHY·FI only displays trees in one style (phylograms). In the next version, I plan to include several others
depending on users' wishes.

Conclusion
PHY·FI is purely a visualization tool. It has no tree inference capabilities; the user must obtain the Newick string
from somewhere else. With this tool I aim to provide
other researchers with the possibility of obtaining a readable, aesthetically pleasing and customized tree image in
the graphics format of their own choice, all in the matter
of seconds or minutes. No download instructions or technical documentation pages stand between the user and
the desired phylogeny figure; no extra plug-ins need be
installed. The program is meant to be self-explanatory, yet
still it presents enough control and interaction to meet
most needs. Thus, PHY·FI is very well suited for quickly
making a tree figure for, e.g., a paper, a presentation or
teaching.
