<p>The identification and characterization of 42 families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses and a comparison to their human
Chimpanzeedescribed.</p>

Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons, the most abundant and widespread class of eukaryotic
transposable elements, are believed to play a significant role in mutation and disease and to have
contributed significantly to the evolution of genome structure and function. The recent sequencing
of the chimpanzee genome is providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional
significance of these elements in two closely related primate species and to better evaluate their
role in primate evolution.

deposited research

Results: We report here that the chimpanzee genome contains at least 42 separate families of
endogenous retroviruses, nine of which were not previously identified. All but two (CERV 1/
PTERV1 and CERV 2) of the 42 families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses were found to
have orthologs in humans. Molecular analysis (PCR and Southern hybridization) of CERV 2
elements demonstrates that this family is present in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and old-world
monkeys but absent in human, orangutan and new-world monkeys. A survey of endogenous
retroviral positional variation between chimpanzees and humans determined that approximately
7% of all chimpanzee-human INDEL variation is associated with endogenous retroviral sequences.

refereed research

Conclusion: Nine families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses have been transpositionally
active since chimpanzees and humans diverged from a common ancestor. Seven of these
transpositionally active families have orthologs in humans, one of which has also been
transpositionally active in humans since the human-chimpanzee divergence about six million years
ago. Comparative analyses of orthologous regions of the human and chimpanzee genomes have
revealed that a significant portion of INDEL variation between chimpanzees and humans is
attributable to endogenous retroviruses and may be of evolutionary significance.

Retrotransposons are the most abundant and widespread
class of eukaryotic transposable elements. For example,
>30% of the mouse genome [1], >50% of the maize genome
[2] and >60% of the human genome [3] are composed of ret-

rotransposon sequences. This group of transposable elements
is made up of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs),
long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons/endogenous retroviruses,
all of which replicate via reverse transcription of an RNA

and genome evolution (for example, [8-10]).

utilize RT activity from autonomous, full-length endogenous
retrovirus in order to replicate. Many of the chimpanzee
endogenous retrovirus families contain truncated, nonautonomous as well as full-length elements.

The recent sequencing of the chimpanzee genome has provided an unprecedented opportunity to not only compare the
full complement of retrotransposons in two closely related
primate species but to gain insight into the role these elements may have played in human evolution. We have combined the use of an LTR retrotransposon search algorithm,
LTR_STRUC [11], with a systematic series of iterative
TBLASTN searches to identify the endogenous retroviruses
present in the Ensembl chimpanzee database [12]. Since
LTR_STRUC searches for LTR retrotransposons/endogenous retroviruses based on structure rather than homology,
elements are often identified that go undetected in traditional
BLAST searches (for example, [11]).

Of the 42 families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses
identified in this study, 40 were found to have orthologues in
the human genome, including 9 that were identified in this
study for the first time [14] (see Additional data file 1). Two
previously identified chimpanzee endogenous retrovirus
families do not have human orthologues (Table 2).

LTR_STRUC is designed specifically to find full-length LTR
retrotransposons/endogenous retroviruses, that is, ones having two LTRs and a pair of target site duplications (TSDs) [11].
Thus, we complemented our search by using reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from LTR_STRUC-identified elements as query sequences in an iterative series of TBLASTN
searches. This allowed us to identify structurally aberrant elements not directly detected by LTR_STRUC. Finally, a series
TBLASTN searches were carried out using, as query
sequences, previously reported human RT sequences for
which orthologues were not identified by our previous two
searches.

Results and discussion
The chimpanzee genome contains at least 42 families
of endogenous retroviruses
Using the procedure described above, we identified a total of
425 full-length chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses. This is
certainly an underestimate of the number of endogenous retroviruses in the chimpanzee genome because we consciously
excluded any sequences that could not be unambiguously
identified as an endogenous retrovirus. The majority of these
endogenous retroviruses (395/425 or 93%) were identified
directly by LTR_STRUC or by homology to LTR_STRUCidentified elements.
ClustalX [13] was used to build a multiple alignment of the RT
domain of these 425 elements together with the RT domains
of 16 previously described LTR retrotransposons/retroviruses representative of the three major classes of retroviral
elements (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis of the RT regions of
the 425 full-length elements revealed the presence of at least
42 independent lineages of endogenous retroviruses in the
chimpanzee genome that we here define as families (Figure
1). Non-autonomous endogenous retroviruses are elements
that lack an RT open reading frame (ORF) and are required to

Consistent with the consensus nomenclature used for human
endogenous retroviruses (HERV) [4], we here refer to the
chimpanzee endogenous retroviral families by the acronym
CERV (for chimp endogenous retrovirus). Distinct families
are indicated by number (for example, CERV 1 to CERV 42).
In the single instance where the CERV acronym refers to a
previously named element/family, we include the pre-existing nomenclature as well (CERV 1/PTERV1). In those cases
where a CERV family has an orthologue in humans, the name
of the orthologous HERV family is given in parentheses (for
example, CERV 3(HERVS71)).

Endogenous retroviral families of the chimpanzee
genome
LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses are grouped into
three major classes [15]. Class I contains elements related to
the gammaretroviruses (for example, Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV; accession no. AF033811), gibbon ape
leukemia virus (GALV; accession no. M26927) and feline
leukemia virus (FeLV; accession no. M18247)). Class II elements are related to betaretroviruses (for example, mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV; accession no. NC_001503),
rabbit endogenous retrovirus (RERV; accession no.
AF480925)). Class III elements are distantly related to spumaviruses (for example, human foamy virus (HFV; accession
no. Y07725), feline foamy virus (FeFV; accession no.
AJ223851)). Of the 42 chimpanzee families identified in our
study, 29 belong to class I, 10 to class II and 3 to class III (Figure 1).
While there is a precedence for classifying human endogenous retroviruses into families based on their tRNA primerbinding sites (for example, HERV K (lysine tRNA binding
site)) [4], we find that such groupings do not accurately
reflect the phylogenetic groupings of CERVs. For example,
some members of the CERV 21 family have a proline tRNA
binding site whereas other members of this same family utilize threonine tRNA as a primer. Conversely, phylogenetically
divergent CERV families may share the same tRNA binding
site (for example, members of the CERV 27 (HERV I) and
CERV 30 (HERVK10) have lysine tRNA binding sites) (Table
2). Thus, primer binding sites appear to be an evolutionarily
labile feature and thus not a reliable indicator of phylogenetic
relationships among chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses. A

Full-length CERVs are typically between 7,000 and 10,000
base-pairs (bp) in length. Consistent with what has been
reported for LTR retrotransposons/endogenous retroviruses
in other species [17-19], CERV target site duplications (TSDs)

range in size from 4 to 6 bp in length. With the exception of a
few mutated copies, CERVs have the same canonical dinucleotides terminating the LTRs as have been reported for LTR
retrotransposons/endogenous retroviruses in other species
(TG/CA) [17-19]. CERV LTRs are typically 400 to 600 bp in
length, although some LTRs are variant in size due to
INDELs. For example, the LTRs of a member of the CERV 4

this lineage. The following is a more detailed characterization
of the three classes of CERVs.

age estimates, at least to a first approximation (for example,
[25]). Using this method, we estimate that the age of fulllength class I CERV elements ranges from 0.8 to 82.9 million
years (MY).

Class I: families 1 to 29

Full length elements representing at least three class I CERV
families, CERV 1/PTERV1, CERV 2 and CERV 3 (HERVS71)
have been recently transpositionally active as indicated by the
presence of an unoccupied pre-integration site at the corresponding locus in humans. Inconsistent with this view is the
fact that one of the chimpanzee-specific CERV 3 (HERVS71)
insertions located on the Y chromosome displays an atypically high level of LTR-LTR sequence divergence (9%), indicative of it having inserted about 28 million years ago (MYA).
However, the clear absence of this insert, both in the
sequenced human genome (pre-integration site in tact) and
in the genomes of several randomly sampled ethnically and
geographically diverse humans (data not shown), indicates
that this element most likely inserted after the chimpanzeehuman divergence (about 6 MYA) and that the exceptionally
high level of LTR-LTR sequence divergence is due to an interelement recombination or conversion event [23,24]. All other
class I CERV elements are much older and have not been
reproductively active since well before chimpanzees and
humans diverged from a common ancestor.

The CERV families 1 through 29 group with the class I retroviruses (Figure 1; Additional data file 2). The average size of
full-length class I CERVs is 8,443 bp. These elements range in
size from 2,268 to 13,135 bp in length. Much of this variation
is due to INDELs associated with non-functional elements.
The average size of LTRs associated with full-length class I
CERV elements is 544 bp (range 195 to 1,591 bp). Class I
CERV elements display considerable variation in their tRNA
binding sites, even within families (Table 2). The most frequently used tRNA primer for class I CERV families (28%) is
proline tRNA.
Because the LTRs of endogenous retroviruses are synthesized
from a single template during reverse transcription, they are
identical at the DNA sequence level upon integration [4].
Using the primate pseudogene nucleotide substitution rate of
0.16% divergence per million years [20,21], the relative integration time or age of CERV elements can be estimated from
the level of sequence divergence existing between the
element's 5' and 3' LTRs. The Jukes-Cantor model was used
to correct for the presence of multiple mutations at the same
site, back mutations and convergent substitutions [22].
Although caution must be taken when using LTR divergence
to estimate the age of individual elements because of confounding processes such as recombination and conversion,
(for example, [23,24]), the method is able to provide useful

Class II: families 30 to 39
The CERV families 30 through 39 group with class II retroviruses (Figure 1; Additional data file 3). All Class II CERV families have orthologues in humans. The average size of fulllength class II CERVs is 7,670 bp. This class of CERV elements range in size from 2,564 to 12,803 bp in length. As with

HERV K22 be renamed HERV M to reflect its distinct primer

elements. The average size of LTRs associated with full-length
class II CERV elements is 544 bp (range 243 to 1,139 bp).
Consistent with the fact that class II CERVs are orthologous
to human HERV K elements, all but one family of class II
CERV elements have lysine tRNA binding sites. The sole

Insertion of a member of the CERV 30 (HERVK10) family in chimps
Figure 2
Insertion of a member of the CERV 30 (HERVK10) family in chimps. The insertion occurred in the LINE element present in chromosome 10 of the
chimpanzee genome. The orthologous LINE element is present in chromosome 12 in humans. In chimpanzees target site duplications (ATTAT) are
identified. A single copy of TSD (ATTAT, the pre-integration site) is found inside the LINE element in humans. The LTRs of the element are 99.4%
identical.

The estimated age of full-length class II CERV elements
ranges from 2 to 97 MY. A member of only one class II family,
CERV 30 (HERV K10), has been transpositionally active since
the divergence of chimps and humans from a common ancestor. The LTR sequence identity of one of the identified CERV
30 (HERVK10) elements is 99.4%, indicating that this element inserted into the chimpanzee genome about 2 MYA. We
have verified that this CERV 30 (HERV K10) insertion is
absent in humans (Figure 2). It has been previously reported
[27,28] and we found in our INDEL analysis (see below) that
at least 8 full-length copies of CERV 30 orthologue HERV
K10, inserted into the human genome after the divergence of
chimpanzees and humans from a common ancestor. In addition, two CERV 30 (HERV K10) insertion polymorphisms
have been identified in human populations [29]. Thus, CERV
30 (HERV K10) family members and their human orthologues have been transpositionally active in both human and
chimpanzee lineages since these species diverged from a common ancestor about 6 MYA.
CERV 36 (HERV K11D) is the second oldest family of class II
CERV elements. We estimate that CERV 36 (HERV K11D)
elements have not been transpositionally active for about 25
MY. We found that several members of the CERV 36 (HERV
K11D) display the same deletion within the gag-pol regions of
their genomes, suggesting that this deletion occurred prior to
their transposition. Thus, this subfamily of CERV 36 (HERV
K11D) elements comprised, at one time, non-autonomous
elements and acquired essential replicative functions in
trans.

Class III: families 40 to 42
The CERV families 40 (HERV S), 41 (HERV 16) and 42
(HERV L) group with class III retroviruses and are related to

spumaviruses [4] (Figure 1; Additional data file 4). All class
III CERV families have orthologues in humans. The average
size of full-length class III CERVs is 6,758 bp. This class of
CERV elements range in size from 2,980 to 13,271 bp in
length. Again, much of this size variation is due to INDELs in
this uniformly non-functional class of CERV elements. The
average size of LTRs associated with full-length class III
CERV elements is 446 bp (range 254 to 831 bp). CERV 40 elements have a serine tRNA binding site while CERV 42 elements have a leucine tRNA binding site (Table 2). Due to
sequence ambiguities, we were unable to determine the tRNA
binding site for CERV 41 elements (Table 2). Class III CERV
elements are the oldest group of endogenous retroviruses in
the chimpanzee genome. The estimated age of these elements
ranges from 30 to 145 MY.

Two CERV families have no human orthologues
CERV 1/PTERV1
With more than 100 members, CERV 1/PTERV1 is one of the
most abundant families of endogenous retroviruses in the
chimpanzee genome. CERV 1/PTERV1 elements range in size
from 5 to 8.8 kb in length, are bordered by inverted terminal
repeats (TG and CA) and are characterized by 4 bp TSDs
(Table 2). The LTRs of the CERV 1/PTERV1 family of elements range from 379 to 414 bp in length. CERV 1/PTERV1
elements have a proline tRNA primer binding site (Table 2).
LTR sequence identity among CERV 1/PTERV1 elements
ranges from 97.1% to 99.7%.
Phylogenetic analysis of the LTRs from full-length elements
of CERV 1/PTERV1 members indicated that this family of
LTRs can be grouped into at least two subfamilies (bootstrap
value of 99; Figure 3). The age of each subfamily was
estimated by calculating the average of the pairwise distances

comment

We found that a number of CERV 1/PTERV1 elements with
high (>99%) LTR-LTR sequence identity have large (1 to 2 kb)
deletions within the RT encoding region of their genomes. It
is likely that these are non-autonomous elements that have
inserted relatively recently by acquiring RT functions in
trans, presumably from autonomous CERV 1/PTERV1 elements. Instances of recently inserted LTR retrotransposons/
endogenous retroviruses lacking RT-encoding functions have
previously been detected in the genomes of humans [32] and
other species of both plants [18,33] and animals (for example,
[16]).

Phylogenetic analysis of solo LTRs and LTRs from full-length
elements revealed that CERV 2 elements group into at least
four subfamilies (bootstrap values >95; Figure 4). We estimated the ages of two of the more abundant subfamilies by
calculating the average of the pairwise distances between all
sequences in each subfamily. The estimated ages of the two
subfamilies were 21.9 MY and 14.1 MY, respectively. As was
the case for the CERV 1/PTERV1 family, these age estimates
are inconsistent with the fact that no CERV 2 orthologues
were detected in the sequenced human genome. Again, we
were able to detect pre-integration sites at those regions in
the human genome orthologous to the CERV 2 insertion sites
in chimpanzees, effectively eliminating the possibility that the
elements were once present in humans but subsequently
excised.

between all sequences in a given subfamily. The estimated
ages of the two subfamilies are 5 MY and 7.8 MY, respectively,
suggesting that at least one subfamily was present in the lineage prior to the time chimpanzees and humans diverged from
a common ancestor (about 6 MYA). This conclusion,
however, is inconsistent with the fact that no CERV 1/
PTERV1 orthologues were detected in the sequenced human
genome. Moreover, we were able to detect pre-integration
sites at those regions in the human genome orthologous to the
CERV 1/PTERV1 insertion sites in chimpanzees, effectively
eliminating the possibility that the elements were once
present in humans but subsequently excised. Consistent with
our findings, the results of a previously published Southern
hybridization survey indicated that sequences orthologous to
CERV 1/PTERV1 elements are present in the African great
apes and old world monkeys but not in Asian apes or humans
[30]. These results suggest that some members of the CERV
1/PTERV1 subfamily entered the chimpanzee genome after
the split from humans through exogenous infections from
closely related species and subsequently increased in copy
number by retrotransposition. The unexpectedly high level of
LTR-LTR divergence could be due to variation accumulated
during the viral transfer [31] or possibly due to an inter-element recombination or conversion event subsequent to integration. Similar results were obtained when only the solo
LTRs or both solo LTRs and LTRs from full-length elements

Subfamily 2
Average Pairwise distance : 1.6%
Estimated age: 5.0 MY

This is the second family of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses with no orthologue in the human genome. We identified
ten solo LTRs and eight full-length copies of CERV 2 elements
in the chimpanzee genome although, because of incomplete
sequencing, we could identify the LTRs for only four of the
eight full-length elements. CERV 2 elements are typically
larger than CERV 1/PTERV1 elements, ranging in size from 8
to 10 kb in length. CERV 2 elements are bordered by inverted
terminal repeats (TG and CA), have 4 bp TSDs (Table 2) and
a proline tRNA primer binding site (Table 2). The LTRs of the
CERV 2 family of elements range from 486 to 497 bp in
length. Based on their LTR sequence identity (98.07% to
99.6%), we estimate that full-length CERV 2 elements were
transpositionally active in the chimpanzee genome between
1.3 and 6.0 MYA. Thus, the majority of CERV 2 elements were
biologically active after the divergence of chimpanzees and
humans from a common ancestor.

experiments were carried out on DNA from species that gave
negative PCR results to eliminate the possibility that the PCR
primer binding sites have diverged in distantly related species
within the CERV 2 RT and gag regions complementary to the
designed probes (Figure 5b). The combined PCR and Southern analysis indicate that CERV 2 like sequences are present
in chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla and old world monkeys but
absent in human, orangutan, new world monkeys and

prosimians (Figure 5c). This distribution of CERV 2 elements
among primates is identical to the above described
distribution of CERV 1/PTERV1 elements [30]. It is worth
noting that although the probes used in Southern hybridization were designed from chimpanzee element sequence, the
strength of hybridization is higher in old world monkeys than
in chimpanzees (Figure 5b), suggesting a higher copy number

refereed research

Gap sequences were divided into two types: 'Mosaic type' gap
sequences are defined as those composed of more than one
category of interspersed repeats (for example, endogenous
retrovirus inserted within a LINE element); and 'Single type'
gap sequences are defined as those composed of only
sequences homologous to endogenous retroviruses. Single
type gap sequences were further divided into two categories:
category 1 comprises those gap sequences composed entirely
of an endogenous retroviral sequence; and category 2 comprises those gap sequences composed of endogenous
retrovirus and non-interspersed repeat sequences. The above
categorizations are useful in distinguishing gaps due to deletions in one species from the gaps due to insertions in the
other species. Instances of mosaic type and single type category 2 gaps are deletions in that species while the gaps that
belong to single type category 1 are either deletions in that
species or insertions in the other species. Because endogenous retroviruses do not excise precisely [4] from the insertion sites, these later gaps can be further characterized as the
result of insertions or deletions.

deposited research

Of the 41 instances where an endogenous retroviral sequence
is present in chimpanzees but lacking in humans, 29 were due
to novel insertions in chimpanzees while 12 were deletions in
humans (Tables 3 and 4; Figure 6a). Of the 31 instances where
an endogenous retrovirus is present in humans but absent in
chimpanzees, we found that 8 were due to novel insertions in

Since solo LTRs and fragmented endogenous retroviral copies are typically ten to a hundred times more abundant than
full-length elements in humans [14,41], we extended our
survey to determine the extent to which INDEL variation
between humans and chimpanzees is associated with solo
LTRs and/or fragmented endogenous retroviral sequences.
We again utilized datasets (human gaps and chimp gaps)
available at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web site [36].
We used 'Repeat Masker' (AF Smit and P Green, unpublished
data) to identify all interspersed repeats, that is, all transposable elements present in the datasets, and to subsequently
extract endogenous retroviral homologous sequences.

reports

The presence of an endogenous retroviral sequence in chimpanzees that is missing at an orthologous genomic position in
humans can be due to a novel insertion in chimpanzees or
deletion of the element in humans. Similarly, the presence of
an endogenous retroviral sequence in humans that is missing
at an orthologous genomic position in chimpanzees can be
due to novel insertion in humans or due to deletion of the element in chimpanzees. Because endogenous retroviruses do
not precisely excise from insertion sites [4], it is possible to
distinguish between these two possibilities. If a region in
humans orthologous to the position of an endogenous
retroviral insertion in chimpanzees contains a remnant of
endogenous retroviral sequence (for example, fragmented
element or solo LTR), we score the gap as a deletion in
humans. If the orthologous region contains no remnant of the
endogenous retrovirus but the pre-integration genomic
sequence can be clearly identified, we score the gap as an
insertion in chimpanzees. The same rules apply for the analogous dataset of the endogenous retroviral sequences present
in humans but absent in chimpanzees.

humans while 23 were deletions in chimpanzees (Table 4;
Figure 6b). Of the 29 novel insertions in chimpanzees, 25
belong to the CERV 1/PTERV1 family, 2 to the CERV 2 family,
1 to the CERV 3 (HERVS7 1) family and 1 to the CERV 30
(HERVK10) family whereas all the 8 novel insertions in
humans belong to the CERV 30 (HERVK10) family (Tables 3
and 4). Thus, four families of endogenous retroviruses have
been transpositionally active in the chimpanzee lineage,
resulting in full-length insertions, since chimpanzees and
humans diverged from a common ancestor while only one of
these families (CERV 30 (HERVK10)) has been active in
humans (Tables 3 and 4). However, the family that is active in
both humans and chimpanzees (CERV 30 (HERVK10)) generated eight novel full-length insertions in humans as
opposed to only one novel insertion in chimpanzees since
they diverged from the common ancestor (Tables 3 and 4).

reviews

Comparative analyses of orthologous regions of the human
and chimpanzee genomes has revealed a number of instances
where relatively large spans of sequence present in one species are not present in the other [34,35]. It has been proposed
that these gaps or INDELs may be of evolutionary significance (for example, [9]). To determine the proportion of
these gaps (human gaps are sequences present in chimpanzees but absent in humans; chimpanzee gaps are sequences
present in humans but absent in chimpanzees) involving
endogenous retroviruses, we utilized the human gap and
chimpanzee gap datasets available at the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web site [36] that were generated by aligning the
chimpanzee genome with the human genome build HG16
[37,38]. These datasets include gaps of sizes ranging from 80
bp to 12.0 kb. Gap sequences from the datasets >5,000 bp
(1,330 sequences), the typical length of full-length LTR retrotransposons/retroviruses, were blasted against the NCBI
non-redundant protein database [39] using BlastX [40].
BLAST was used to identify species-specific full-length
endogenous retroviral insertions in humans and chimpanzees. A total of 41 chimpanzee gap sequences and 31 human
gap sequences were found to have significant similarity (e <
0.01) with retroviral sequences.

higher in old world monkeys than in chimpanzees, suggesting a higher copy number of CERV 2 elements in old world monkeys than in chimpanzees. Below

Consistent with the copy number of CERV 30 (HERVK10)

[45]) gene evolution. The recent sequencing of the chimpanzee genome is providing a unique opportunity to conduct
comparative genomic analyses of primate transposable
elements.
Retrotransposons are the most abundant class of transposable elements. For example, retrotransposons comprise at
least 60% of the human genome [3] and results presented
here and elsewhere [34] suggest that the number of endogenous retroviruses in chimpanzees may be higher than in
humans. In this paper, we present the results of the first systematic search for endogenous retroviruses in the chimpanzee genome. We have identified 425 full-length endogenous
retroviruses in the chimpanzee genome that can be grouped
into 42 independent lineages or families (Figure 1). All but
two families of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses were
found to have orthologues in humans (Table 2). In contrast,
we have found that all known families of human endogenous
retroviruses have orthologues in chimpanzees. The two CERV
families without orthologues in the human genome display a
patchy distribution among primates (Figure 5) and our data
suggest that at least some members of both families have been
transpositionally active in the chimpanzee lineage after the
divergence of chimpanzees and humans from a common
ancestor.
We estimate that chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses range
in age from about 0.8 to 145 MY. Nine families of chimpanzee
endogenous retroviruses have been transpositionally active in
chimpanzees while two families of human endogenous retroviruses have been transpositionally active in humans since
they diverged from a common ancestor (Table 5). Thus, while
some families of endogenous retroviruses have not been
transpositionally active within the primate lineage, others
have and continued to be active since chimpanzees and
humans diverged from a common ancestor.

It has been estimated that 3.5% of the sequence differences
between chimpanzees and humans is due to INDELs [34,35]
and that this INDEL variation may be of particular evolutionary significance [9]. We have determined that approximately
7% of all chimpanzee-human INDEL variation is attributable
to the presence or absence of endogenous retroviral
sequences. The potential biological/evolutionary significance
of this variation is currently under investigation.
Emerging evidence indicates that retrotransposons have
played a significant role in gene and genome evolution (for
example, [8-10]). The identification, characterization and
comparative genomics of chimpanzee endogenous retroviruses presented in this report should not only help contribute
to our understanding of the functional significance of these
elements in chimpanzees but to a better appreciation of the
role of endogenous retroviruses in primate evolution.

Materials and methods
Initial dataset scanning
The 2.73 GB chimpanzee genomic sequence [12] obtained
from the Ensembl database was scanned for the presence of
endogenous retroviruses using a structure based program,
LTR_STRUC (LTR retrotransposon structure program) [11].
LTR_STRUC scans the genomic sequence for the presence of
similar regions of length typical for LTRs (LTR pairs) and
within the expected size of a full-length LTR retrotransposon/
endogenous retrovirus. If the putative LTRs are found, the
program then searches for additional retrotransposon features, such as primer binding sites (PBSs), poly-purine tracts
(PPTs), target site repeats (TSRs), and assigns a reliability
score to the hit based on the presence or absence of each of
these features. A total of 2,056 hits were reported as the putative endogenous retroviruses in the chimpanzee genomic
sequence, of which only 97 encoded RT.

Identification of full length elements

The full-length elements were grouped into families based on
the bootstrap values generated in the phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetically well supported clusters with high boot strap values were used to group the elements into families (Figure 1).
The most recent element that is still intact is used as the representative element for each family (Table 2).

Identification of the primer binding site
A 100 bp region downstream of the 5' LTR of full-length elements was searched against the chimp tRNA database downloaded from [50,51] using the program FASTA [52]. The 3'
end of tRNA that matched with the reverse complement of the

information

The 1,088 RT sequences identified in the TBLASTN searches
were checked for the presence of LTRs on either side of the RT
as a criterion for full-length elements. This was done by
examining the DNA sequences 7,000 bp on either side of the
RT sequence, aligning them against each other using the program BLAST2SEQ and manually checking the hits for the
presence of canonical dinucleotides, target site repeats and

Grouping the elements into families

interactions

The 25 RT sequences obtained from sequence analysis were
augmented by conducting exhaustive sequence similarity
searches using these sequences as queries against the 2.73 GB
chimpanzee genomic sequence [12] using the TBLASTN program [40,48] to obtain an extensive set of endogenous retroviruses in the sequenced genome. Around 2,000 RT
sequences were obtained by automatically parsing the
TBLASTN search results for the hits above a threshold of 70%
identity and covering a length of one-third of the query
sequence using a perl script. After removing duplicates
obtained during automatic parsing, we were left with 1,088
RT sequences.

A multiple alignment was constructed from the DNA
sequences of the RT region of 425 full-length elements
together with representative members from the three classes
of vertebrate retroviruses/LTR retrotransposons (Table 1) [4]
using the program ClustalX [13]. We chose to use DNA
sequence in making the multiple alignment and building the
phylogenetic tree rather than amino acid sequence because of
the presence of numerous frame shift mutations and stop
codons in the elements. The multiple alignment was manually
adjusted in the MEGA alignment browser [49]. A neighbor
joining tree was generated from the alignment using MEGA2
with p-distance and pairwise deletions as parameters and
bootstrap values were obtained from 1,000 replicates.

The 97 putative elements for which the presence of RT
sequence was reported by LTR_STRUC were subjected to
sequence analysis to identify the RT coding region. Briefly,
sequence analysis involves aligning the amino acid sequence
of the three reading frames reported by the search algorithm
(the strand encoding RT protein is determined based on the
presence of PBSs and PPTs) with previously annotated retroviral proteins using ClustalX [13] followed by manually
checking of the three ORFs for the RT conserved motifs
previously described [46,47]. From this sequence analysis we
were able to identify RT conserved motifs for 25 hits.

other LTR characteristic features. LTRs were identified for
395 of the 1,088 elements that had RT sequences. Thirty elements from previously reported human RT sequences for
which orthologues were not identified in the above searches
were added to our dataset, resulting in a total of 425 elements.

Southern hybridization

Molecular analysis: PCR and Southern hybridization

Primate DNA was restriction enzyme digested, transferred to
a nylon membrane and hybridized as described previously
[54]. Nested PCR amplified products in RT and gag regions of
CERV 2 elements were radioactively labeled and used as
probes for hybridization. The same amount of DNA was
loaded in all the lanes, with DNA samples in the order: human
(Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), orangutan
(Pongo pygmaeus), crab eating monkey (Macaca fascicularis), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatto), red-chested mustached tamari (Saguinus labiatus), ring-tailed lemur (Lemur
catta), pig tailed monkey (Macaca nemestrina), black
headed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), wooly monkey
(Lagothrix lagotricha).

Primate DNA samples were purchased form Coriell cell
repository (catalog no. PRP00001 and PRP00003) (Coriell
institute for medical research, Camden, NJ, USA).

Additional data files

Mulitple alignment was generated from the LTRs for each
family using ClustalX [13]. A neighbor joining tree was generated from the alignment using MEGA3 [49] with Jukes-Cantor model [22] and pairwise deletions as parameters and
bootstrap values were obtained from 1,000 replicates. The
age of each subfamily was estimated by calculating the average of pairwise distances between all sequences in that subfamily and using the primate pseudogene nucleotide
substitution rate of 0.16% divergence per million years
[20,21].

Polymerase chain reaction
Primers were designed in the conserved RT, gag, LTR and env
regions of the CERV 2 element using the program PRIMER3
[53]. PCR amplification conditions were as follows: initial
denaturation for 4.5 minutes at 94Â°C, 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94Â°C, 30 s annealing at 57Â°C, 40 s elongation at
