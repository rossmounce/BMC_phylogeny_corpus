Complete mitochondrial DNA sequence of the
European flat oyster Ostrea edulis confirms
Ostreidae classification
Gwenaelle Danic-Tchaleu, Serge Heurtebise, Benjamin Morga and Sylvie Lapègue*

Abstract
Background: Because of its typical architecture, inheritance and small size, mitochondrial (mt) DNA is widely used
for phylogenetic studies. Gene order is generally conserved in most taxa although some groups show considerable
variation. This is particularly true in the phylum Mollusca, especially in the Bivalvia. During the last few years, there
have been significant increases in the number of complete mitochondrial sequences available. For bivalves, 35
complete mitochondrial genomes are now available in GenBank, a number that has more than doubled in the last
three years, representing 6 families and 23 genera. In the current study, we determined the complete mtDNA
sequence of O. edulis, the European flat oyster. We present an analysis of features of its gene content and genome
organization in comparison with other Ostrea, Saccostrea and Crassostrea species.
Results: The Ostrea edulis mt genome is 16 320 bp in length and codes for 37 genes (12 protein-coding genes, 2
rRNAs and 23 tRNAs) on the same strand. As in other Ostreidae, O. edulis mt genome contains a split of the rrnL
gene and a duplication of trnM. The tRNA gene set of O. edulis, Ostrea denselamellosa and Crassostrea virginica are
identical in having 23 tRNA genes, in contrast to Asian oysters, which have 25 tRNA genes (except for C. ariakensis
with 24). O. edulis and O. denselamellosa share the same gene order, but differ from other Ostreidae and are closer
to Crassostrea than to Saccostrea. Phylogenetic analyses reinforce the taxonomic classification of the 3 families
Ostreidae, Mytilidae and Pectinidae. Within the Ostreidae family the results also reveal a closer relationship between
Ostrea and Saccostrea than between Ostrea and Crassostrea.
Conclusions: Ostrea edulis mitogenomic analyses show a high level of conservation within the genus Ostrea,
whereas they show a high level of variation within the Ostreidae family. These features provide useful information
for further evolutionary analysis of oyster mitogenomes.

Background
Because of its typical architecture, inheritance and small
size, animal mitochondrial (mt) DNA is widely used for
phylogenetic studies. Combined with these characteristics, its typically maternal inheritance contributes to a
fast rate of evolution. Nucleotide changes combined
with gene order and rearrangement data can provide
valuable information on major evolutionary changes at
different taxonomic levels. Typically, animal mtDNA is
a compact molecule (14 to 17 kb), though some
mtDNA can be vastly larger (e.g., Plactopecten magellanicus [1]), and usually encodes 13 proteins, 22 transfer

RNAs (tRNAs) and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) [2].
There are often few intergenic nucleotides except for a
single large non-coding region generally thought to contain elements that control the initiation of replication
and transcription [3]. Size variation in mtDNA is usually
due to the different length of the non-coding regions.
Gene order is generally conserved in most taxa,
although some groups show considerable variation. This
is particularly so in the Mollusca phylum, especially in
Bivalvia and Scaphopoda [4]. In addition to the fact that
phylogenetic relationships among major molluscan
groups are not well understood, the species classification
of some of the most common mollusks remains difficult.
A case in point is oysters, for which a plastic growth
pattern is a major feature, resulting in a wide range of

overlapping ecophenotypic variants [5,6]. Oysters are
bivalve molluscs that are widely distributed in the
world’s oceans. As benthic, sessile filter-feeders, they
play an important role in estuarine ecosystems. Moreover, some species are of economic importance, like the
Pacific cupped oyster, which is grown in 27 countries
and is the most highly produced mollusc species in the
world. Oysters have been introduced all over the world
for culture and many species are sympatric. Numerous
species (30-40 according to the classifications) of oysters
of the genus Ostrea have been described. Their geographical range is particularly wide in warm and temperate
waters of all oceans, although they have a predominantly
tropical distribution [6,7]. In Europe, along the Atlantic
and Mediterranean coasts, the European flat oyster,
Ostrea edulis, is an important economic marine
resource: in 2009 almost 3000 tons were produced in
the world, mainly (91%) in Europe (Spain, France, Ireland ...) [8].
During the last few years, there have been significant
increases in the number of complete mitochondrial
sequences available for all species. The number has
more than doubled for molluscs in the last three years
[9], so that 98 complete mollusk mitochondrial genomes
are now available in GenBank, mainly from gastropods
(43), bivalves (35) and cephalopods (14). Among
bivalves, the sequenced genomes represent 6 families
and 23 genera. In the Ostreidae, the genus Crassostrea
has been thoroughly studied, with 7 representatives (6
Asian oysters and 1 American oyster) [10]. In contrast,
there is only one representative of the genus Saccostrea
(Saccostrea mordax), and one of the genus Ostrea
(Ostrea denselamellosa). Recent studies have provided a
more comprehensive picture of the cupped oyster genome, showing an unusually high conservation of mitochondrial gene order in Asian Crassostrea species [11].
Even though molecular tools, such as mitochondrial or
microsatellite markers, already exist for the European
flat oyster and allow population genetics [12] or quantitative genetics [13] studies, the complete characterization of its mtDNA will allow a better study to be made
of phylogenetic relationships among members of the
genus, especially between the closely-related species O.
edulis and O. angasi [14], to improve classification of
the Ostreidae family within the Bivalvia.

(16 532 bp for S. mordax to 22 446 bp for C. iredalei),
and is within the size range of the Pteriomorphia mt
genomes published to date: from 16 211 nt for Argopecten irradians [15] to 32 115 nt for Placopecten magellanicus [1].
In the mt genome of O. edulis, a total of 965 bp of
non-coding nucleotides is spread over 21 intergenic
regions (each over 5 bp) including a major non-coding
region (MNR) of 695 bp. A large non-coding region
suggests a putative control region based on its AT content of 74.4% [16]. In contrast to typical animal mitochondrial genomes, the O. edulis genome may lack the
protein-coding gene atp8, although some recent studies
have found a good candidate for atp8 gene in Mytilidae
and possibly in some Ostreidae [17]. Furthermore, O.
edulis genome also has duplications of three tRNAs:
trnM, trnS and trnL. The rrnL gene is split into 2 fragments, a phenomenon previously observed in the Ostreidae [11]. The rrnS is not duplicated (also in O.
denselamellosa, S. mordax and C. virginica), in contrast
to Asian Crassostrea.
The molecule has an overall A+T composition value of
64.9% and the size of the coding region is 15 379 nt in
length, accounting for 94.2% of the whole genome. The
AT content is slightly higher than those of Pectinidae
(55.3 to 59.6% [18]) or Mytilidae (61.5 to 61.8%). The AT
composition of O. edulis is, therefore, within the AT content range of the Ostreidae: the lowest known AT content is 60.7% in O. denselamellosa, while the highest is
65.3% in C. hongkongensis [19]. In S. mordax, the AT
content is 64.4% which is very similar to O. edulis.
As observed in O. denselamellosa (16 277 bp), S. mordax (16,532 bp) and C. virginica (17 244 bp), the lack of
duplicated rrnS in O. edulis, added to the lack of 2
tRNAs (not duplicated trn-K and trn-Q) compared to
Asian Crassostrea may account for the difference in
length compared with other Crassostrea (C. gigas 18225
bp, C. hongkongensis 18 622 bp).
The genome composition of O. edulis is, thus, identical to O. denselamellosa (except for AT composition)
and close to S. mordax in terms of complete genome
size, AT content and the non-duplicated rrnS. More
mitochondrial genome sequences from Ostrea and Saccostrea will be needed to assess relationships between
the Ostrea, Crassostrea and Saccostrea genera.

Results and discussion

Gene arrangement

Genome composition

Animal mt gene order is relatively stable within major
groups and generally variable among groups [2]. Bivalve
species show variability in terms of mt genome size,
gene arrangement and tRNA number [20]. As observed
in four Pectinidae (A. irradians, M. yessoensis, C. farreri
and P. magellanicus), gene arrangement can be very different despite species being members of the same family

The complete mitochondrial genome of Ostrea edulis
[GenBank: JF274008] is 16 320 nt in length and encodes
37 genes, including 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2
rRNAs and 23 tRNAs on the same strand (Figure 1 and
Table 1). This size is very close to that of O. denselamellosa (16 277 bp), shorter than that of other Ostreidae

abbreviations. The one letter amino acid code is used for tRNA (red) designation. The major non-coding region (MNR) is shown in grey.

[15]. In contrast, in Mytilus congeners M. edulis, M.
trossulus and M. galloprovincialis, PCGs are arranged in
an identical order, but tRNA, rRNA and control regions
are also almost the same [21]. The mt gene order of O.
edulis is identical to that of O. denselamellosa (Figure
2). The arrangement of PCGs in O. edulis is cox1, cox3,
cytb, cox2, nad2, atp6, nad4, nad5, nad6, nad3, nad1,
nad4L and is nearly identical to that of Crassostrea,
except for the inversion of two PCGs nad2 and atp6.
Among the six Asian Crassostrea and their Atlantic sister species C. virginica, only protein-coding gene order
is identical [10]. Besides, gene order of Crassostrea differs significantly from S. mordax. Ostreidae share three

PCG blocks cox1-cox3-cytb-cox2, nad5-nad6 and nad3nad1-nad4L. Moreover, the nad2-atp6-nad4 block of O.
edulis is inverted in S. mordax (Figure 2), but the
remaining genes are extensively rearranged. The major
non-coding region (MNR) is located after trnD (Figure
1), while this region is found between trnG and trnV
near atp6 and nad2 in Crassostrea. If tRNAs and rRNAs
are considered, there are six blocks conserved within the
Ostreidae: cox3-trnI, cox2-trnM, trnM-trnS, trnY-atp6,
trnH-nad4 and trnF-trnA-nad1-nad4L. Between O. edulis and Asian Crassostrea, seven blocks are shared: cox3trnI-trnT-trnE-cytb, cox2-trnM-trnS, trnM-trnS, trnYatp6, trnH-nad4, nad5-nad6-trnQ-nad3 and trnL-trnF-

trnA-nad1-nad4L-trnW; while between O. edulis and S.
mordax, seven blocks are also shared but these are different: trnG-cox3-trnI, trnE-cytb-cox2-trnM, trnM-trnStrnL-trnP-rrnL(5’end), trnF-trnA-nad1-nad4L, rrnL
(3’end)-nad5-nad6, trnH-nad4 and trnY-atp6. It should
be noted that rrnL is in one piece in Saccostrea but not
within Crassostrea.
In terms of gene arrangement, it is thus clear that O.
edulis is more similar to Crassostrea than to S. mordax
when comparing PCGs. As shown in Figure 2, the

complete genome arrangement of O. edulis is similar to
that of Asian Crassostrea while it appears completely
reorganized from trnY to the end of mt genome when
compared with that of S. mordax.
Protein-coding genes

All PCGs are encoded on and transcribed from the
same strand. Twelve open reading frames (ORFs) were
detected for the thirteen typical PCGs (cox1-cox3, cytb,
nad1-nad6, nad4L, atp6 and atp8). Although we

carefully looked for candidate regions for atp8 gene, we
could not identify any, as in all Pteriomorphia complete
genomes already published. However, a recent publication [17] suggests that a putative ORF represents a good
candidate to start an atp8 gene in most bivalve mt genomes. Within the invertebrate mt code there are three
standard initiation codons (M-AUG, M-AUA, and IAUU), but mt genomes often use a variety of non conventional start codons [22]. In this study, most of PCGs
use conventional initiation codons: ATA is used for
cox3, nad4, nad6 and atp6; ATG is used for cox1, cox2,
nad1, nad3, nad4L and nad5; ATT is used for nad2,
but cytb uses the alternative start codon CTA (as in C.
gigas and C. angulata [10]). Eight protein-coding genes
were terminated by a stop codon (TAA and TAG).
Transfer and ribosomal RNA genes

In total, 23 tRNA coding genes were identified in the
size range of 63 to 71 nucleotides, based on typical secondary structure (Additional file 1). An additional trnM
was detected as found in C. gigas, C. hongkongensis [9],
C. virginica [16] and Mytilus [23]. Two serine and two
leucine tRNA genes were also differentiated in O. edulis
by their anticodons (UCA Ser1, AGA Ser2, and CUA
Leu1, UUA Leu2) as found in O. denselamellosa [24],
Crassostrea and some other species (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis and Argopecten irradians). The anticodon
usage of O. edulis was congruent with the corresponding tRNA genes of other molluscan mtDNAs.
Identification of both the small and the large ribosomal RNA genes in O. edulis was accomplished by
BLAST comparison with other published ribosomal
RNA genes, especially O. denselamellosa [GenBank:
HM015199], S. mordax [GenBank:FJ841968] and C.
gigas [GenBank:EU672831]. Although putative gene
boundaries for the two rRNA genes have been found,
these cannot be precisely determined until transcript

mapping is carried out. Besides rrnS of O. edulis is 935
bp in length and flanked by nad4 and rrnL 3’end.
The rrnL gene is split into two segments: one segment, of the 5’ end (matches with rrnL 5’end from O.
denselamellosa and Saccostrea), is 575 bp long and
positioned between trnP and nad2; and the other segment, of the 3’ end, is 708 bp and located between
rrnS and nad5. The length of the rrnS is similar to
that of most bivalves, but smaller than that of O. denselamellosa (1017 bp) and that of Crassostrea (946 to
1207 bp) [10]. The size of rrnL (1283 bp in all) is similar to that of O. denselamellosa (1299 bp), but smaller
than that of other bivalves. This bias may be due to
the method (BLAST) used to compare the rRNA
sequences because this method only checks the identity between a few sequences and because it’s easier to
compare sequences from same species as they show
higher identity.
Non-coding regions

As in most bivalves, O. edulis mtDNA contains a large
number of unassigned nucleotides. There are as many
as 21 non-coding regions (> 5 bp) up to 965 nucleotides
found throughout the O. edulis mitochondrial genome.
Eight of these non-coding regions are more than 50 bp
in length. Among these regions, the major non-coding
region (MNR) has been identified and located, that
remains the most promising region in which to find regulatory and/or gender-specific sequences [25]. The O.
edulis mtDNA MNR is positioned between trnD and
cox1 and is 695 bp in length, similar to that of O. denselamellosa (689 bp), making it the longest MNR within
the Ostreidae apart from C. virginica (832 bp) and C.
ariakensis (716 bp). It has an A+T content of 74.4%
which is higher than the remainder of the mt genome
(64.4%), as it includes several (A)n and (T)n homopolymer tracts, features which are typically used for

identification of the mitochondrial control region and
thought to contain the replication origin [2].
Phylogenetic analysis

In recent years there have been many phylogenetic studies on the taxonomy and evolution of the Ostreidae
based on molecular data, especially mitochondrial DNA
[26-30]. However, most of these previous studies have
been based on partial sequences and incomplete molecular information. Recently, Ren et al. [11] have compared 7 complete mt genomes from Asian oysters.
In the present study’s aa-based tree built with twelve
concatened PCGs from 19 mitochondrial genomes in
Pteromorphia (Figure 3), we can observe that, at the
Ostreidae level, O. edulis is first clustered with O. denselamellosa as congeneric species. Then this group of species falls into a highly supported clade with S. mordax.
Ostrea and Saccostrea are then clustered with the Crassostrea species group. In this latest clade, the single
American oyster C. virginica falls at the base of a nested
clade that contains the Asian oysters. Very similar
results were obtained with a nucleotide phylogenetic

tree with low differences of bootstrap values. In Figure
4, more Ostreidae species are included as more numerous cox1 sequences are available in Genbank. The same
phylogenetic relationship between Ostrea, Saccostrea,
and Crassostrea is observed, especially the first grouping
of Ostrea and Saccostrea, but not between Ostrea and
Crassostrea, with however far less robust nodes. This
same result was observed when considering the evolution of the tRNA anticodons in marine bivalve mitochondrial genomes, where the relationship presented are
also based on concatenated nucleotide sequences of 12
protein-coding genes by Bayesian inference analysis [24].
However a recent study [31], based on cox1 and 16S
sequences, showed a closer relationship between Ostrea
and Crassostrea, than with Ostrea and Saccostrea. However, for the cox1 analysis, only one Ostrea sequence
was included, and for the 16S analysis, much more
Ostrea sequences were included but the bootstrap value
was between 50 and 80%. Those comparisons seem to
indicate that phylogenetic analyses are more powerful
when including several sequences as the 12 concatened
PCGs.

Finally, the phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 3,
which includes mt genomes from all published Pteriomorphia, reinforces the taxonomic classification of the 3
families Ostreidae, Mytilidae and Pectinidae [32,11].

Conclusion
In conclusion, the complete mitochondrial genome of O.
edulis is 16 320 bp in length. A common phenomenon
is that mitogenomes of most bivalves contain two trnM
genes and most metazoan mitochondria have a set of 22
tRNA, including two trnL and two trnS. However the
tRNA gene sets of O. edulis, O. denselamellosa and C.
virginica are identical in having 23 tRNA genes. Another
important characteristic is that the rrnS gene is not
duplicated in O. edulis, a feature shared with O. denselamellosa, S. mordax and C. virginica and which contrasts
with Asian Crassostrea.
The phylogenetic analyses confirm the relationships
between each family (Ostreidae, Mytilidae and Pectinidae), but also within each genus (Ostrea, Saccostrea and

Crassostrea). Within the Ostreidae, phylogenetic analyses show that Ostrea are closer to Saccostrea than
Crassostrea, although gene arrangement may show a
closer relationship between Ostrea and Crassostrea, indicating that several types of information are needed to
infer relationships between genome species as evolution
is acting at different levels of the genomes. As many
questions remain unanswered on the phylogeny of
Ostreidae, especially between Ostrea and Saccostrea, it
would be desirable to increase the resolution by adding
samples of more taxa in order to extend molecular
information among the major lineages of the Ostreidae
and within the Pteriomorphia as a whole.

Methods
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing

Adductor muscle from three O. edulis collected in
Quiberon Bay (Bretagne, France) was used in this
study. Total genomic DNA was extracted using a
Wizard ® DNA Clean-up System (Promega). The

mitochondrial genome was amplified in 4 overlapping
fragments using species-specific primers (Additional
file 2). PCR was performed in 25 μl reaction volumes
in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Each reaction
contained 13.3 μl dH2O, 5.0 μl buffer 5× (Promega),
2.0 μl MgCl2 (25 mM), 2.5 μl dNTP (2 mM), 0.5 μl of
each primer (20 μM), and 0.2 μl GoTaq ® DNA polymerase (5U/μl, Promega). PCR cycling conditions were
94 °C for 2 min; then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 sec, 57
°C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 2 min; and finally a step of
72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were verified by electrophoresis (1% agarose gel) and purified using Montage®PCR Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore). Purified
products were then used directly as templates in cycle
sequencing reactions with dyelabeled terminators (Big
Dye 3.1, Applied Biosystems). Specific primers were
designed and used for primer walking sequencing,
which was performed for both strands of each sample
on an ABI 3130XL/Genetic Analyser (ABI).
Sequence analysis and gene annotation

During the processing of large fragments and those from
primer walking sequencing, regular and manual examinations were used to ensure there was reliable overlapping and correct genome assembly.

Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes were firstly
identified using BLAST [33] searches at GenBank, and
then by alignment with previously published mt genomes from species of Crassostrea, Saccostrea and other
closely-related molluscs. Amino-acid sequences of protein-coding genes were inferred with ORF Finder [34]
using invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. Transfer
RNAs were identified using DOGMA [35]http://dogma.
ccbb.utexas.edu/, and tRNAscan-SE [36]http://selab.janelia.org/tRNAscan-SE/ using mito/chloroplast genetic
code and default search mode, or setting the cove cutoff
score to 1 when necessary. Assembly of the genome and
gene map of the mitochondrial genome of Ostrea edulis
was performed using CLC Main Workbench (CLC bio).
Phylogenetic analysis

To date, 20 Pteriomorphia mt genomes are available in
GenBank [37] and we used 19 of these (excluding Argopecten irradians irradians that is very close to Argopecten irradians: 99% similarity) in our phylogenetic
analysis, together with O. edulis mt genome obtained in
this study (Table 2). The blacklip abalone Haliotis rubra
(Gastropoda) was used as the outgroup. The nucleotide
and amino-acid sequences from all 12 PCGs (proteincoding genes) were concatenated for each genome and

aligned using MUSCLE [38]. The size of the concatenated alignment nucleotides varied from 10 411 bp for
M. yessoensis to 11 240 bp for P. magellanicus). To the
alignments, we applied a Maximum Likelihood (ML)
phylogenetic reconstruction approach using 100 bootstraps with MEGA5 [39]. A second phylogenetic analysis
was performed using 5 additional cox1 genes from
Ostrea (Ostrea angasi [GenBank:AF112287.1], Ostrea
aupouria [GenBank:AF112288.1], Ostrea chilensis [GenBank:AF112289.1], Ostrea puelchana [GenBank:
