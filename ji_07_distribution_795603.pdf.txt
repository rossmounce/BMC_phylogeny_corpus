Background: Extant life depends greatly on the binding of small molecules (such as ligands) with
macromolecules (such as proteins), and one ligand can bind multiple proteins. However, little is
known about the global patterns of ligand-protein mapping.

Life is essentially a molecular network, not only in the individual sense but also at the ecosystem level [1,2]. The network

depends greatly on the binding of small molecules (for example, ligands and cofactors) with macromolecules (for example, proteins). Small-molecule ligands not only participate in

Conclusion: These findings have significant implications for evolution and drug discovery. First,
the chronology of ligand-protein binding can be inferred by the power-law feature of ligand-protein
mapping. Some nucleotide-containing ligands, such as ATP, ADP, GDP, NAD, FAD, dihydronicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide
phosphate
(NDP),
nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide
phosphate (NAP), flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and AMP, are found to be the earliest cofactors
bound to proteins, agreeing with the current understanding of evolutionary history. Second, the
finding that about 30% of ligands are shared by two or more domains will help with drug discovery,
such as in finding new functions from old drugs, developing promiscuous drugs and depending more
on natural products.

Results: By examining 2,186 well-defined small-molecule ligands and thousands of protein domains
derived from a database of druggable binding sites, we show that a few ligands bind tens of protein
domains or folds, whereas most ligands bind only one, which indicates that ligand-protein mapping
follows a power law. Through assigning the protein-binding orders (early or late) for bio-ligands,
we demonstrate that the preferential attachment principle still holds for the power-law relation
between ligands and proteins. We also found that polar molecular surface area, H-bond acceptor
counts, H-bond donor counts and partition coefficient are potential factors to discriminate ligands
from ordinary molecules and to differentiate super ligands (shared by three or more folds) from
others.

many basic enzymatic reactions (as coenzymes or substrates)
to build metabolic networks, but also act as extra- and intracellular signals to help construct regulation networks [3-9].
The great potential of small-molecule ligands to make links
between different proteins means that one ligand can bind to
diverse targets [10-13]. In fact, some ligands are extremely
powerful in contacting proteins, which are termed hubs of
biochemical networks [14-17]. However, little is known about
the global patterns of ligand-protein mapping, which stimulated our interest to do a comprehensive analysis and explore
the biological and chemical bases underlying the mapping
patterns. Since ligand-protein binding is one of the most basic
biochemical processes, the present study has significant
implications for tracing the important events in the origin of
life and as well as for understanding the new paradigms in
drug discovery.

Results
Distribution patterns of ligands in the protein universe
Although considerable efforts have been devoted to constructing ligand databases [18-26], it is still a great challenge
to select clearly defined ligands from them. Thanks to the
endeavor of Rognan and co-workers, a well-defined ligand
database, the Annotated Database of Druggable Binding Sites
from the PDB (sc-PDB), was released recently [27]. For this
database, the ligands were collected according to the following criteria: only host proteins with high-resolution (<2.5 Å)
crystal structures were considered; water molecule, metal
ions and other 'unwanted molecules' (for example, solvents,
detergents and covalently bound ligands) were removed; only
small-molecular-weight ligands (ranging from 70 to 800 Da
for heavy atoms) were selected; and only ligands with a limited solvent-exposed surface (that is, less than 50% of their
surface exposed to the solvent) were picked. In addition, the
corresponding binding sites were also extracted and were
defined by all of the protein residues with at least one atom
within 6.5 Å of any ligand atom. Taken together, the clear definition for the ligands in sc-PDB guarantees the repeatability
of the present analysis, which gives sc-PDB an advantage over
other ligand databases.
Through searching sc-PDB, 2,186 small-molecule ligands
were selected, which are bound by 5,740 domains (the
domains were counted at a non-redundant level and constituted domain space; Additional data file 1). According to
SCOP 1.69 [28,29], these domains were classified into 591
folds. As one fold may cover multiple domains and bind more
than one ligand, the fold occurrences amounted to 3,224,
which constituted the fold universe.
As shown in Additional data file 1, ligands do not distribute
evenly in the domain space. A few ligands cover 100+
domains, 681 ligands (31.2%) are shared by 2 or more
domains and 1,505 (68.8%) bind only one. Moreover, ligands
also populate unevenly in the protein architecture universe.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R176

For instance, 1,833 ligands (83.9%) are bound by only one
fold, 185 (8.5%) by two, while 24 ligands (1.1%) are bound by
10+ folds (Additional data file 1). The most common ligand,
ATP (adenosine-5'-triphosphate), is shared by 35 folds. As
illustrated in Figure 1, the number of ligands (N) decays with
increasing number (L) of domains and folds that bind the ligand and follows the power law N = aL-b (P < 0.0001). It is
interesting to note that most of the widely shared ligands
(such as those shared by 15+ folds; Additional data file 1) are
hubs of metabolic networks [14-16] and are vital to metabolism (especially energy metabolism).

information

It has been widely accepted that protein folds are among the
most conserved elements of life [35-37]. However, the
present analysis indicates that 353 ligands (16.1%) are shared
by 2 or more folds and 104 ligands (4.8%) can cover 3+ folds,
which suggests that ligand binding is not constrained by the
global architecture of proteins. This finding is consistent with
a recent concept that the local structures around an active site
are more basic than folds to describe a protein's biological
space (binding site for potential ligands) [38]. This phenomenon can be elucidated, at least in part, in terms of the struc-

interactions

Chemical basis underlying the power-law behaviors of
ligand-protein binding

From the factor loadings, we see that the first factor, explaining 52.8% of the variance, contains high loadings (>0.9;
shown in bold in Table 1) from constitutional properties (such
as total molecular surface area, total molecular volume,
molecular weight, total bond counts, number of non-hydrogen atoms and number of carbons atoms) and topological
properties (such as Kappa topological indices, subgraph topological counts, Kier and Hall Chi connectivity indices and
Zagreb topological Index). In comparison, the second factor,
explaining 12.7% of the variance, contains important contributions (with loadings of higher than 0.8; shown in bold in
Table 1) from electronic properties, such as polar molecular
surface area, H-bond acceptor counts (whose loading is
0.799), H-bond donor counts and partition coefficient (measured by AlogP98 and LogP).

refereed research

We used factor analysis to visualize the diversity of the molecules. Factor analysis is widely used to study the patterns of
relationship among many dependent variables, with the goal
of discovering something about the nature of the independent
variables (called factors) that affect them [48,49]. In the
present analysis, two factors, which can explain 65.5% of the
variance, were extracted by principal component analysis and
rotated by the Varimax method [50] to chart the two-dimensional chemical space of small molecules. The factor loadings
(Varimax normalized) are listed in Table 1.

deposited research

As the quantity of bio-ligands is limited, to guarantee statistical significance, the 128 bio-ligands were classified into only
two categories: first, 70 early ligands, which are owned by
both prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic (yeast or
higher) species; and second, 54 late ligands, which are owned
only by eukaryotic (yeast or higher) species (4 ligands failed
in age assignment) (Additional data file 3). It is interesting to
note that early ligands cover 7.1 folds on average, in contrast
to late ligands, which cover only 1.2 folds on average, and that
all (100%) super ligands (shared by 3+ folds) originated early,
while most (64.8%) ordinary ligands (bind to 3 or less folds)
appeared late. All of these findings strongly suggest that the
preferential attachment principle still holds for ligand-protein binding to a large extent.

reports

The chemical space is composed of 2,176 ligands derived from
sc-PDB (due to the lack of atomic parameters, 10 of the 2,186
ligands failed to go through the descriptor calculations) and
2,184 small molecules randomly selected from ACD-SC
(Available Chemicals Directory-Screening Compounds, Version 2005.1, Molecular Design Ltd. Information Systems Inc.,
San Leardo, CA, USA; which collects chemicals that are commercially available and is broadly regarded as a source of
ordinary molecules [45]). Seventy descriptors characterizing
the structural features of these molecules were calculated, of
which 13 were calculated by Sybyl (Tripos Inc., St Louis, Missouri, USA [46]), 49 by Cerius2 (Version 4.10L, Accelrys Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA [47]) and 8 by an in-house program written in Perl (Table 1).

reviews

As a large part of the sc-PDB-derived ligands are synthetic, to
explore the applicability of the preferential attachment principle to protein-ligand binding, we extracted bio-ligands from
the ligand dataset. To do this, the MetaCyc database (9.5; a
metabolic-pathway database that contains 5,253 metabolites)
[34] was employed to filter the non-metabolic ligands. As a
result, 128 bio-ligands were obtained, which bind to 1,662
domains (counted at a non-redundant level). According to
SCOP 1.69 [28,29], these domains were classified into 207
folds. As one fold may cover multiple domains and bind more
than one ligand, the fold occurrences amounted to 574.
Although these ligands are only metabolism-relevant, they
also follow power-law distribution in the protein universe
(Additional data file 2).

comment

Although power law is a central concept in network sciences
and has been implicated in most biological networks [14-16],
it is a challenge to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
rule. The most popular theoretical models resort to preferential attachment principle, which attributes the different connections of nodes to their different emerging orders, that is to
say, the more connected nodes originated earlier than the less
connected nodes [30]. Although the preferential attachment
principle has been justified for protein networks [31-33], it
remains unclear whether it can be applied to protein-ligand
binding.

ture-function relationships of proteins. First, binding sites
and ligands are quite flexible and plastic [39-41], and therefore, binding-site selection is, to certain extent, ligand
dependent [42-44]. Second, ligand binding is governed by a
few conserved residues and, thus, is a local rather than a global property of proteins [10,11]. However, the structural factors underlying the strong protein-binding ability of the super
ligands still remain unknown. In addition, it is also of interest
to explore the structural features discriminating ligands from
ordinary molecules. Therefore, the chemical space consisting
of ligands and ordinary molecules was charted to reveal the
relationship between the ligand distribution patterns in the
protein universe and in the chemical space.

In the chemical space formed by the two factors (Figure 2),
one can find some differences between the distribution patterns of ligands and ordinary molecules. That is, ligands (in
red) occupy the relatively upper part of the space, while ordinary molecules (in blue) hold the relatively lower part, which
implies that it is the second factor that discriminates ligands
from ordinary molecules. As a consequence, it can be deduced
that polar molecular surface area, H-bond donor counts, Hbond acceptor counts and partition coefficient are likely
responsible for the differences between ligands and ordinary
molecules, which agrees well with the current understanding
of the chemical basis of ligand-protein binding that electrostatic interactions (including H-bond) and hydrophobic

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R176

interactions make major contributions to the binding. More
interestingly, as shown in Figure 3, super ligands (in blue and
red) do not distribute randomly in the chemical space, but
concentrate in the relatively upper part of the space, which
suggests that polar molecular surface area, H-bond donor
counts, H-bond acceptor counts and partition coefficient are
also key factors discriminating super ligands from others.
To shed more light on the above findings, the average values
of descriptors characterizing polar molecular surface area, Hbond donors, H-bond acceptors and partition coefficient were
calculated for ordinary molecules, ligands and super ligands.
From Table 2, it can be seen that there indeed exist correla-

Discussion

Since ligand-protein binding is one of the most basic biochemical processes, the present findings have broad biological and medical implications.

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R176

information

Recently, through examining the conformational diversity of
some very common ligands (that is, ATP, NAD and FAD)
bound to proteins, Stockwell and Thornton [41] suggested
that molecular flexibility is important for ligands to bind
diverse proteins. This opinion is partially supported by the
present analysis. Although the contribution from the number
of rotatable bonds (RotBonds) to the second factor is not very
strong (the loading is 0.428; Table 1), there is a correlation
between the protein-binding ability of ligands and index Rot-

Bonds. As listed in Table 2, the average RotBonds for ligands
is significantly higher than that for ordinary molecules
(independent samples t-test shows that P < 0.0001), and it is
clear that the more folds the ligands cover, the higher the
average RotBonds are for the ligands.

tions between protein-binding ability and the four kinds of
parameters. The protein-binding potential of ligands is positively correlated with polar molecular surface area, H-bond
donor and acceptor counts, and negatively correlated with
partition coefficient (measured by AlogP98 and LogP).

(shared by 3+ folds; in blue), especially those that are shared by 10+ folds (in red), concentrate in the relatively upper part of the space (the area of the
circle is directly proportional to the number of folds that bind the ligand), which suggests that polar molecular surface area, H-bond donor counts, H-bond
acceptor counts and partition coefficient are responsible for the strong protein-binding potential of the super ligands, which is supported by the different
average values of the four kinds of parameters for ligands with different protein-binding potentials (Table 2).

Implications for tracing the chronology of ligand
binding to proteins
The most challenging issue in life sciences may be elucidating
how organisms originated from inorganic scratches (gases,
water and clays), during which one of the most important
missions is to establish the chronology of the important biological events. Thanks to the continuing efforts of chemists
and biologists, the chronologies of the evolution of amino
acids and proteins have been established in principle [37,51-

55]. However, as many proteins bind ligands that are essential for their functions and the ligands are likely to have originated independently of proteins [56-59], the binding of
ligands with primordial proteins would also be a critical step
in the origin of life. Thus, it is intriguing to explore the chronology of ligand-protein binding and answer the following
questions: which ligand was first recognized by a protein and
what kind of architecture did the host protein have. Nevertheless, since there is no fossil of the last universal common

ancestor, let alone the more ancestral organisms, it is a great
challenge to trace the protein-binding history of early ligands.

deposited research
refereed research

To get a deeper insight into the evolutionary features of ligands, the building block usage of 128 bio-ligands was analyzed. As shown in Additional data file 5, nucleic acid bases
are the most frequently used building blocks, followed by
carbohydrates and amino acids, which is in accordance with
Nobeli et al.'s [67] finding that nucleic acid bases are the most
common fragments of metabolites. More interestingly, many
early bio-ligands (45.0%) contain nucleic acid bases; in particular, the nine earliest bio-ligands all contain one or more
bases. In contrast, carbohydrates or amino acids are contained by only a small proportion of early bio-ligands (25.0%
and 7.5%, respectively). This provides further evidence to
support the notion that early ligands are vestiges of the RNA
world [56].

4, Table 3). It is interesting to note that the predicted earliest
hosts for the nine bio-ligands appeared in roughly the same
order as the protein structures deduced by a phylogenomic
analysis (that is, c.37 is the earliest, followed by c.2, c.23, c.3
and c.26, all of which belong to the α/β class) [37,53,54].
Although no consensus has been reached on the exact temporal order of protein architectures, α/β is generally considered
to be the most ancient protein class [37,53,54,60-62]. In addition, based on an extensive analysis of sequences and structures of numerous proteins, Trifonov and co-workers [63-65]
also inferred that some P-loop ATP-binding domains represent the most ancient proteins. Recently, through a phylogenomic analysis on protein architectures of modern metabolic
networks, Caetano-Anollés and co-workers [66] indicated
that enzymes with the P-loop hydrolase fold engaged in
nucleotide (especially purine) metabolism may be the most
primitive members of metabolic systems. Through examining
the structures and functions of these members, we found that
most (approximately 80%) of them need ATP to work normally. Therefore, the present speculations on the chronology
of ligand-protein binding are self-consistent and are in line
with the up-to-date knowledge on protein evolutionary
history.

reviews

A close inspection of ATP's host proteins reveals that
although ATP covers 35 folds and 97 domains, most domains
belong to a small group of folds, indicating that power law is
still effective (Additional data file 4). According to the
preferential attachment principle of fold usage [37], it is reasonable to infer that the most prevalent fold, P-loop hydrolase
(c.37), was employed by ATP's first host (Table 3). Interestingly, c.37 is the most ancient fold predicted by a
phylogenomic analysis of protein architectures [37,53,54].
Similar analyses allowed us to deduce the most ancestral host
proteins of the other eight early ligands (Additional data file

comment

As stated above, through determining the protein-binding
ages of ligands, a rough temporal order (early or late) for
ligand-protein binding can be inferred (as shown in Additional data file 3). However, considering the fact that fold distribution pattern in the sequence universe helps greatly to
reveal the chronology of the evolution of protein architecture
[37,53,54], we speculate that the power-law distribution of
ligands in the protein universe may implicate a more explicit
temporal order for ligand-protein binding. In fact, the preferential attachment principle underlying the power-law behavior of ligand-protein mapping suggests that the more widely a
ligand is shared, the earlier it bound to proteins. As protein
architecture is more conserved than sequence [35-37], the
fold-based inference is believed to be more robust than the
domain-based one. Therefore, the nine bio-ligands that are
most popular in the fold universe (covering 15+ folds; Table
3) are considered to have bound their host proteins relatively
earlier than others and to follow the order (from early to late):
ATP, ADP (adenosine-5'-diphosphate), GDP (guanosine-5'diphosphate), NAD (nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide),
FAD (flavin-adenine dinucleotide), NDP (dihydro-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate), NAP (nicotinamideadenine-dinucleotide phosphate), FMN (flavin mononucleotide) and AMP (adenosine monophosphate).

As mentioned above, the presently revealed chronology of
early ligands' host proteins is roughly in line with the previously deduced evolutionary history of protein architectures
[37,53,54]. Thus, it is interesting to ask: is the accordance
between both events fortuitous? Our answer is maybe not.
Considering the prevalent ligand-induced protein folding
[68-72], we conjecture that early ligands might have facilitated protein formation as catalysts (to assemble amino acids
or peptide segments), as molecular chaperons (to help
protein folding) and/or as selectors (because of the important
functions of the early ligands), which naturally resulted in the
accordance between both events. This conjecture implicates
that the origin of primitive proteins benefited from ligand
binding, which is reasonable in terms of the thermodynamics
of ligand binding and protein folding.

revealed in the present study have important implications for
understanding these new drug discovery strategies.

It has been found that some early ligands, such as ADP and
GDP, can bind proteins related to the very old P-loop hydrolase fold (for example, preprotein translocase SecA (1M74),
ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 3 (1FZQ) and GTP-binding protein (1A4R)) with an affinity (free energy) of 10-15
kcal/mol [73], which is just in the range of the free energy loss
(10-20 kcal/mol) during protein folding [74,75]. Thus, the
free energy release during ligand binding may meet the free
energy demand during protein folding. It is tempting to
examine the conjecture of ligand-induced formation and/or
folding of primordial proteins through experimentation. To
do that, in vitro selection may be an appropriate methodology
[76]. It is interesting to note that in vitro selection of proteins
(consisting of 80 residues) targeted to bind ATP has been performed [77]. The randomly generated proteins indeed belong
to the α/β class, but are not related to P-loop hydrolases fold
[78]. However, considering the fact that the shortest protein
sequence for the P-loop hydrolase fold contains 94 residues
(according to the Protein Databank), we suggest that to
explore whether the formation of the most ancient proteins
was induced by ATP, one should adopt longer protein
sequences in the in vitro selection experiments and use small
amino acids as building blocks, because in the primordial
world only these amino acids were available [51,55].

Since most human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, heart
disease, arthritis and neurodegenerative diseases, involve
multiple pathogenetic factors, the more-investment-less-outcome predicament is attributed in part to the limitations of
the current one-drug-one-target paradigm in drug discovery
[79,86]. Therefore, more and more efforts are devoted to
finding new therapeutics aimed at multiple targets [86],
which is becoming a new paradigm in drug discovery. To hit
the multiple targets implicated in complex diseases, two
strategies are conceivable. One is called the multicomponent
therapeutic strategy, which incorporates two or more active
ingredients in one drug [86-89], as was applied in some traditional medicines (in China and many other countries) and
in recently developed drug cocktails. The other is to hit the
multiple targets with a single component, which is termed the
one-ligand-multiple-targets strategy or promiscuous drug
strategy [89-99]. Compared with the former strategy, the latter might take advantage of lower risks of drug-drug interactions and more predictable pharmacokinetic behaviors
[91,92] and thus has been paid more and more attention. The
feasibility of the one-ligand-multiple-targets strategy is supported by the present findings, because a certain proportion
of ligands do indeed bind to two or more domains (even
folds). In addition, the presently revealed structural features
of super ligands are of significance for selecting and/or
designing multipotent agents. Of course, the new strategy
should be treated with wariness, because of the potential side
effects of the promiscuous ligands.

Implications for understanding the new paradigms in
drug discovery
Nowadays, the pharmaceutical industry is facing an unprecedented challenge. Global research funding has doubled since
1991, whereas the number of approved new drugs has fallen
by 50% [79,80]. To meet the more-investment-less-outcome
challenge, some novel drug discovery strategies have
appeared in recent years, which include finding new functions from old drugs, developing promiscuous drugs rather
than selective agents and depending more on natural products than on combinatorial libraries of synthetic compounds
to derive drug leads. Since the essence of drug action is the
binding between drugs and target biomolecules (most of
which are proteins), the ligand-protein binding features

As indicated above, approximately 30% of ligands are bound
by two or more domains (this number gets ~15%, if counted
on fold level), which suggests that if a ligand can bind to a protein, it has great potential to bind to others. Considering the
fact that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
approved approximately 2,000 drugs (chemical entities) and
there exist only 2,000-3,000 druggable genes and 600-1,500
drug targets [81,82], it is truly possible to find new functions
from these old 'safe' drugs, which supports an increasingly
shared notion in drug development that the most fruitful
basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old
drug [83-85].

Another feature of the recent drug discovery paradigm shift is
that more attention has been given to natural-product repositories rather than combinatorial libraries of synthetic compounds for finding novel drug leads [100,101]. Due to their
biosynthetic origin, natural products are natively bound to
proteins (synthases). In light of the present findings, one can
conclude that natural products have more potential than synthetic compounds to bind proteins, including those of human,
which helps to understand the natural product-based drug
discovery strategy. In addition, it can be inferred that it is
rather easy to build a protein-ligand network on the basis of

Data selection/collection

An early bio-ligand is defined as that owned by both prokaryotic (E. coli) and eukaryotic (yeast or higher) species, while a
late bio-ligand is defined as that owned only by eukaryotic
(yeast or higher) species. As there is no direct information on
ligand ownership, we used the information of their host proteins to deduce their ages. That is, a ligand is early, provided
that at least one of its host proteins is owned by both E. coli
and yeast (or higher species); and a ligand is late if none of its
host proteins is owned by E. coli but at least one is owned by
yeast or higher species. During the age-assigning process, not
only the host proteins recorded in sc-PDB were checked, but
also the corresponding homologous proteins retrieved from
Swiss-Prot [104] were considered.

Seventy descriptors characterizing the structural features of
2,186 ligands selected from the sc-PDB and 2,184 small molecules randomly selected from ACD-SC were calculated by
Sybyl (13 descriptors) [46], Cerius 2 (49 descriptors) [47] and
an in-house program written in Perl (8 descriptors). Then, the
calculated data were linked together with Perl for further
analysis. Because of the lack of atomic parameters for ten ligands (that is, 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol, 2-amino4-oxo-4,7-dihydro-3h-pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile, 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-l-thyronine, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline2,3-dione, 9-hydroxy aristolochic acid, 3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4hydroxyphenyl)-4h-chromen-4-one, 5-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-benzofuran-7-carbonitrile, 3,3',5,5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid, 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone and radicicol),
some descriptors could not be calculated for these molecules.
Hence, only 2,176 ligands went through the calculation. However, as each of the ten ligands covers only one fold, their
absence has no impact on the conclusion of the present study.

Descriptor calculation

SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was employed to do
the factor analysis. The factors were extracted by means of
principal component analysis [48,49] and the parameter settings were as follows: a correlation matrix was used; and two
factors were extracted to visualize the two-dimensional
chemical space of ligands and ordinary molecules. In order to
simplify the interpretation of the extracted factors, factor
rotation was performed, during which the most popular
orthogonal rotation method, Varimax, developed by Kaiser
[50], was employed. For other variables, default parameters
were adopted.

reports

Since sc-PDB is a subset of the PDB, one may be concerned
about the robustness of the conclusions derived when using
it. However, considering the facts that the present inferences
were made mainly on the level of protein fold and that folds
are much more conserved than domains, and thus fold
increase is much slower than that of domains in the PDB
[103], it is believed that the present conclusions are solid. In
fact, even if the latest data of the sc-PDB (containing 396 new
ligands and 827 new domains, which were kindly provided by
Dr Rognan and have not been uploaded on the website) are
considered, all of the present conclusions still hold.

Factor analysis

reviews

Until June 2006, 2,721 ligands had been recorded in sc-PDB.
As our interest was focused on non-peptide ligands, 433 peptides were eliminated. After removing 102 repeated ligands
(which have the same structures to others but were given different release names), 2,186 small-molecule ligands
remained (Additional data file 1), which bind to 5,740 nonredundant domains (to remove the redundancy of domains,
only one domain was chosen from each species). Domain is
defined as an independently folded unit within a protein,
often joined by a flexible segment of the polypeptide chain
[102]. For a small proportion of ligands that are shared by two
domains, both domains were counted. According to SCOP
1.69 [28,29], these domains were classified into 591 folds. As
one fold may cover multiple domains and hold more than one
ligand, the fold occurrences amounted to 3,224.
