species: the concentrations of ppGpp and RpoS
are strain-specific in Escherichia coli

Abstract
Background: Sigma factors and the alarmone ppGpp control the allocation of RNA polymerase to promoters
under stressful conditions. Both ppGpp and the sigma factor sS (RpoS) are potentially subject to variability across
the species Escherichia coli. To find out the extent of strain variation we measured the level of RpoS and ppGpp
using 31 E. coli strains from the ECOR collection and one reference K-12 strain.
Results: Nine ECORs had highly deleterious mutations in rpoS, 12 had RpoS protein up to 7-fold above that of the
reference strain MG1655 and the remainder had comparable or lower levels. Strain variation was also evident in
ppGpp accumulation under carbon starvation and spoT mutations were present in several low-ppGpp strains. Three
relationships between RpoS and ppGpp levels were found: isolates with zero RpoS but various ppGpp levels, strains
where RpoS levels were proportional to ppGpp and a third unexpected class in which RpoS was present but not
proportional to ppGpp concentration. High-RpoS and high-ppGpp strains accumulated rpoS mutations under
nutrient limitation, providing a source of polymorphisms.
Conclusions: The ppGpp and sS variance means that the expression of genes involved in translation, stress and
other traits affected by ppGpp and/or RpoS are likely to be strain-specific and suggest that influential components
of regulatory networks are frequently reset by microevolution. Different strains of E. coli have different relationships
between ppGpp and RpoS levels and only some exhibit a proportionality between increasing ppGpp and RpoS
levels as demonstrated for E. coli K-12.

Background
Sigma factors direct RNA polymerase to various sets of
promoters, and are at the centre of complex networks
regulating gene expression in bacteria such as Escherichia coli [1,2]. Sigma factors are highly conserved in
comparison to more specific regulators [1], but does
genetic conservation imply functional conservation at
the core of cell regulation? This is an important question in light of current systems biology efforts to construct models of regulatory behaviour [3-5]. There are
instances where regulation differs between closely
related bacteria [6-8] so how conserved is regulation,
especially global regulation, within a species? We
approach this question by measuring the concentration

of two cellular components with global regulatory roles
in multiple members of the same species. We focus on
two factors with complementary functions in switching
between vegetative growth and stress-related gene
expression. The RpoS sigma factor (s S ), responds to
stress and shifts transcription away from vegetative
growth and towards stress resistance [9-12]. Higher
levels of RpoS in stressed or stationary-phase cells alter
expression of several hundred genes [13,14]. The alarmone ppGpp [15] also accumulates in bacteria undergoing stress, such as amino acid, carbon or phosphate
limitation [16-19]. Accumulation of ppGpp triggers the
stringent response and a radical decrease in ribosome
and protein synthesis, even leading to growth arrest
[20,21]. ppGpp and sS co-operate both mechanistically
and strategically under stress and expression of s S controlled genes is partly dependent on ppGpp [22,23].
The level of ppGpp also controls the amount of sS in

the cell, as ppGpp increases by several-fold the cellular
concentration of sS during nutritional stress or in the
stationary phase. The absence of ppGpp impairs or
severely delays the accumulation of sS [9] and ppGpp
positively affects the efficiency of rpoS translation under
stress conditions as well as rpoS basal expression under
conditions of optimal growth [24,25]. The response to
phosphate starvation additionally involves stabilisation
of RpoS protein sensed through SpoT [19]. At several
levels then, ppGpp is intertwined with rpoS regulation
and here we investigate the conservation of the level of
these regulators across the species E. coli.
This study was prompted by several indications that
RpoS and ppGpp were subject to strain variation. The
rpoS gene is polymorphic in isolates of E. coli [26].
Recently, variations in ppGpp levels were also observed
between laboratory strains of E. coli due to spoT mutations [21]. However, the assumption that rpoS is subject
to extensive variation has been challenged [27]. These
authors claimed that the endogenous RpoS levels are
actually fairly conserved in E. coli. They also noted that
the trade-off hypothesis was originally based on only
two high-RpoS strains in [28].
Here, we study the hypothesis that stress-related gene
expression is variable across the species E. coli because it
involves a trade-off in the expression of genes related to
stress resistance and vegetative growth [11]. The equilibrium between metabolic capacity essential during vegetative growth and stress resistance, the so-called SPANC (Self
Preservation and Nutritional Competence) balance [11], is
subject to selection in laboratory culture [28]. High levels of
sS impair the growth of E. coli on poor carbon sources or

under nutrient limitation [28]. Stress resistance is not constant amongst all E. coli strains [28-30] also indicating possible variation in gene expression relating to RpoS and/or
ppGpp. We demonstrate here that strain variation in
ppGpp is one of several factors that contribute to the difference in the level of sS across the species E. coli and discuss
the polymorphisms at the core of bacterial regulation.

Results
The goal of this study is three-fold: to provide evidence
that rpoS polymorphism and variation in sS levels are
widespread in the species E. coli; to show that the genes
that control ppGpp synthesis and degradation are also
subject to variation and finally to demonstrate that the
different levels of RpoS are at least partially dependent
on variability of endogenous ppGpp.
Strain variation in RpoS levels in the species E. coli

To test the extent of variation in RpoS levels, we analysed 31 strains from the ECOR collection of E. coli isolates from various locations and environments [31]. The
72 ECOR strains are divided into five phylogenetic
groups (A, B1, B2, D and E). Nine of the strains tested
here belonged to group A, 7 to group B1, 10 to group
B2 and 5 to group D. The K-12 strain MG1655 was
used as a control reference. As shown in Figure 1, the
cellular content of RpoS was highly variable in standardised overnight cultures. Nine isolates had no detectable
RpoS, another five had RpoS level 3 to 7-fold above that
of the laboratory K-12 strain MG1655. The remainder
of strains had levels within a 2-fold range around
MG1655. The absence of RpoS from the nine strains

measurements were normalised against ECOR 56 to which was assigned 100 units. Relative values represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three
independent experiments.

The PCR product covering the rpoS gene was of differing size, consistent with variation in the rpoS-mutS region in the species E. coli [34]. The 1.3 Kb fragment

was confirmed by screening for sS-related phenotypes
(glycogen accumulation [32] and catalase activity [33];
results not shown).
rpoS sequences in ECOR strains

Variation in the rpoS locus was already indicated by
the observation that PCR amplification of the rpoS
region resulted in fragments of three different sizes, as
shown in Table 1. These differences were consistent
with the genomic variation in the rpoS-mutS region in
the species E. coli [34]. The size of fragments and
sequence matches correspond to previously described
rpoS regions, with the 1.3 Kb fragment like that in E.
coli K-12, and the 4.2 Kb and 3.4 Kb products similar
to those found in [35] and [36] respectively. Sequencing of the rpoS gene in 22 ECOR strains (Table 1)
representing high, low and null RpoS phenotypes indicated highly deleterious mutations (nonsense or frameshift) resulting in stop codons in rpoS in all ECORs
with no detectable RpoS. That nearly a third of strains

carried mutations in rpoS is striking, but not inconsistent with previous data with other E. coli strains. Bhagwat et al. [37] found that an introduced plasmid with
wild-type rpoS was able to restore resistance in 20
acid-sensitive isolates amongst 82 pathogenic E. coli
isolates tested. Similar results were obtained by [38].
Hence rpoS-defective strains consistently constitute 2030% of natural isolates.
The strains with high levels of RpoS were also
sequenced for rpoS, but were mainly similar to the K-12
sequence. As shown in Table 1, several contained the
commonly observed Q33E difference found amongst
many K-12 strains but which has similar functional
activity [39]. There is a G126 substitution to E or V in
two of the five strains with high RpoS, but the significance of this is not clear. Two isolates with very low
RpoS levels (ECOR2, ECOR22) had the same amino
acid sequence as the strain with highest protein
(ECOR69) so the structural gene is not the essential
cause of RpoS variation. Given the many regulatory

Figure 2 The rate of acquisition of rpoS mutations in nutrient-limited chemostats. ECOR strains were inoculated into glucose-limited
chemostats and culture samples were withdrawn every 24 h for 4 days as previously described [32]. The aerobic chemostat populations were
supplied with 0.02% glucose at a pH of 7, a temperature of 37°C and operating at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1. The lines represent the proportion of
wild-type bacteria, and the error bars on points show the standard deviations between two replicate chemostats with each strain. RpoS levels of
tested strains (data from Figure 1): ECOR5 (67.1); ECOR50 (14.5); ECOR55 (15.5); ECOR63 (10.5); ECOR66 (90.8); ECOR69 (107.0).

inputs affect RpoS protein levels [40], this is not altogether surprising; for example an rssB mutation can elevate RpoS level in some lab lineages [41].
RpoS loss in ECOR strains

The high level of sS in K-12 strains such as MC4100TF
is associated with a measurably greater incidence of
rpoS mutations in nutrient-limited populations than
found with low- sS strains like MG1655 [28]. To see if
the elevated RpoS in ECOR strains increased the selection pressure for rpoS mutations under nutrient limitation, the spread of rpoS mutations was followed in
chemostat cultures limited by glucose, with all cultures
growing at the same rate (μ = 0.1 h -1 ). The rate of
enrichment of rpoS mutations in Figure 2 showed that
strains with higher levels (ECOR66, 69) accumulated
significant numbers of rpoS mutations within three days
of continuous culture. With some intermediate-level
strains, rpoS mutations still proliferated in the culture,
but more slowly. There was no absolute relationship
between RpoS level and rate of rpoS sweeps because one
strain (ECOR5) had fairly high sS but the culture accumulated mutations slowly, while another (ECOR55) had
low- sS levels but the culture rapidly accumulated rpoS
mutations. As in earlier data, MG1655 did not accumulate mutations in rpoS under these conditions [28].
Hence it is evident that mutational changes can

generally reassort RpoS levels in certain environments
but differences between the strains besides RpoS levels
need to be invoked to explain the extent of rpoS
changes under glucose limitation. A possible difference
is in the level of other global regulators affecting s S
synthesis or degradation; below we investigate the variation in ppGpp as a possible contributor to RpoS
variation.
Strain variation in ppGpp levels in the species E. coli

Recent experiments with laboratory strains [21] suggested that ppGpp levels were under SPANC selection
and likely to be subjected to frequent microevolution
under stress or under nutrient limitation. Initial experiments on some ECOR strains showed the kinetics of
accumulation of ppGpp upon amino acid starvation (elicited by serine hydroxamate [42]) and carbon starvation
(elicited by the addition of the inhibitor methyl-aglucoside (a-MG [43]) were distinct. Amino acid starvation mainly operates through RelA and the level of
ppGpp accumulation was quite similar in all strains
(Figure 3b). In contrast in Figure 3a, it is evident that
ppGpp response under carbon starvation was much
more heterogeneous, consistent with variations in SpoT
or its regulation by carbon starvation.
Based on the kinetics in Figure 3, the level of ppGpp
appeared to stabilise at around 30 min (in agreement

with [44]) and a 30 min point was used to survey other
ECOR strains. The levels of ppGpp measured under carbon starvation and amino acid starvation respectively
are shown in Figure 4a and 4b. Overall, the stringent
response with amino acid starvation was present and
relatively constant in all strains (collective mean = 0.78,
SD = 0.06, SD/mean = 0.08). On the other hand, the
ppGpp levels triggered by a-MG addition varied over a
much greater range (collective mean = 0.24, SD = 0.07,

SD/mean = 0.29), consistent with the more heterogeneous kinetics in Figure 3.
DNA sequencing of the spoT gene from four high- and
four low-ppGpp strains in Figure 4 revealed a mutation
common in several low-ppGpp strains. A T13N substitution not present in lab strains or high-ppGpp strains was
found in ECOR50, 51, 53 and 63. Although there is no
direct evidence implicating these substitutions in altered
ppGpp levels, these polymorphisms and those found in

laboratory strains [21] are possibly consistent with spoT
being subject to microevolutionary pressures.
The relationship between ppGpp and RpoS levels in the
species E. coli

As shown in Figure 5a, a plot of the measured ppGpp
and RpoS levels in all the strains does not give a simple relationship in which RpoS concentration is proportional to ppGpp inside cells, as would be expected
from extrapolating data on one K-12 strain [9].
Not surprisingly, strains with undetectable RpoS
have various ppGpp levels. Some strains, such as
ECOR44,36,5,56,17,66 and 69 do exhibit a proportionality between the two measured entities, unlike
ECOR14,55,58,65,54 and MG1655, which fall on a plateau with a limited amount of RpoS. This separation of
responses in the ECORs was reinforced by multivariate
analysis, which identified the relationship between
three groups of strains (Figure 5b).

Discussion
Sigma factors are high in the hierarchy of transcriptional
regulators and are influenced by multiple environmental
sensing pathways [45,46]. Molecules like ppGpp

contribute to altering the pattern of transcription
through sigma factors [15] and affect many important
bacterial characteristics [20,47-49]. We address the
question of the constancy of s S and ppGpp function
across a species, beyond an individual lab strain.
The variation in sS levels and their physiological consequences across E. coli strains has been demonstrated
earlier [28], and led to the idea of a trade-off between
stress resistance (in high-RpoS strains) and nutritional
capability (better in low-RpoS strains) [11]. This conclusion has been questioned [27]. Based on measurements
of RpoS levels in six E. coli isolates these authors found
a six-fold difference in RpoS level, with the highest
RpoS only 1.49-times the MG1655 level. They noted
that the trade-off hypothesis was originally based on
only two high-RpoS strains in [28]. The variation of
RpoS levels therefore needed a deeper analysis. Here we
show that there is a much larger range of variation in
sS amongst the ECOR isolates than Ihssen et al. found
with fresh-water isolates. Further, we detected here
sequence polymorphisms that would not have been
observable in the earlier comparative genome hybridisation analysis [27]. Our conclusions are also consistent
with results on RpoS variation in other laboratories

[30,39] and recent indications that RpoS levels are
highly variable within clinical populations of E. coli [50].
The variation in s S levels is not simply a result of
differences in rpoS sequence. Variation in ppGpp was

also evident in ECOR strains, revealing a possible
diversifying influence on RpoS level and function
[9,10]. ppGpp levels in ECOR strains showed dissimilarity particularly in response to carbon starvation.

Ferenci et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/62

Variation in ppGpp levels was less with amino acid
deprivation, consistent with greater variation in spoT
than relA function. The conservation in relA function
is not surprising, since the main role of RelA and the
stringent response is to control the translational
machinery of the cell in response to intracellular
amino acid availability. This regulation is likely to be a
universal need and hence widely conserved. In contrast, the response to extracellular nutrient availability
and carbon starvation, mediated through spoT, is subject to fluctuating environmental inputs.
The spoT gene is central to the ppGpp-dependent
response of bacteria to changes in growth rate and
nutrient starvation [20] so it was interesting to find
that it is subject to polymorphism both in laboratory
strains [21] and ECOR isolates of E. coli. It is probably
no accident that spoT variations were already noted in
some lab lineages [51]. Further genomic comparisons
in a BLAST search followed by a global alignment
showed that 15 of 50 E. coli commensal and pathogenic strains currently in the sequence database have
one or two amino acid substitutions in SpoT and two
K-12 derivatives carry a QD insertion at position 84,
the same insertion that is present in MC4100 [21]. In
contrast, we found variation in only four out of 50
RelA sequences and three of them have only a single
amino acid substitution between similar amino acids.
Distinct mutations in spoT were also found in E. coli
after thousands of generations of laboratory growth on
glucose [52], suggesting spoT is subject to selection
under repeat-batch culture conditions as well.
The strain variation in the concentration of ppGpp
was more extensive than the genetic variation in spoT.
Our results suggests that, as with rpoS, differences in
ppGpp between natural isolates can be due to polymorphism in extragenic regulatory genes or in stress
signal processing, as well as polymorphisms in spoT
itself. For example, the steady-state level of ppGpp is
increased in a cgtA mutant [53], but the accumulation
of ppGpp during amino acid starvation is not affected,
exactly as we find in some ECOR strains. CgtA interacts
with SpoT and is thought to maintain low ppGpp levels
when bacteria are growing in a nutrient-rich environment [54]. Further work on genomic and signal processing changes is needed to define all the influences
leading to ppGpp variation in ECOR strains.
Traxler et al. have recently shown that increasing concentrations of ppGpp during the progression of amino
acid limitation precisely activate genes related to the Lrp
and RpoS regulons at a different stages [55]. According
to these authors full induction of RpoS-dependent genes
requires high concentrations of ppGpp. However, accumulation of RpoS is not due simply to increased ppGpp,
once a ppGpp0 strain still accumulates almost normal

Page 8 of 11

amounts of RpoS, although with a considerable delay
[9,25]. It is therefore conceivable that as an alternative
to ppGpp regulation another redundant mechanism
operates to induce RpoS. This redundancy may explain
the difficulty in establishing a clear relationship between
ppGpp and RpoS and the consequent imperfect relation
between ppGpp and RpoS described here. This is even
more true for a heterogeneous set of strains as the
ECOR collection, with its wide genetic heterogeneity.
Due to the number of strains tested, a growth-independent system for eliciting starvation was used to
induce relA and spoT-dependent ppGpp accumulation.
Hence the serine analogue SH and glucose analogue aMG were used to induce amino acid and carbon limitation respectively. It is believed that a-MG acts through
competition with glucose, thus limiting its utilisation.
However, a recent study challenged this idea and proposed an alternative mechanism for a-MG toxicity
resulting in growth arrest [56]. This explanation is based
on the toxicity of a-MG phosphate, which accumulates
in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, whether growth arrest is
caused by a-MG toxicity and/or competition with glucose, ppGpp accumulation due to a-MG is dependent
on SpoT, because it occurs in both wild-type and relA
mutants [44]. Furthermore, ppGpp accumulation following phosphate exhaustion with selected ECOR strains
resulted in similar differences to the ones observed for
a-MG treatment (results not shown).
As described for the spoT+ and spoT variants of E. coli
K12 [21], the nature of the spoT allele present in E. coli
simultaneously influences the level of sS, stress resistance
and nutritional capabilities of E. coli. The environmental
influence on ppGpp regulation is affected by the same
dichotomy already observed and discussed for RpoS [11],
namely the fluctuating needs of the cell in response to
nutrient limitation and stress resistance. Indeed, the variation in spoT resembles the polymorphisms in rpoS,
which are, if anything, even more extensive [26,39].
These new results suggest that one or more of the genes
involved in ppGpp synthesis and degradation is subject
to the same kind of selective pressures as is rpoS. In this
respect, spoT and rpoS are both involved in SPANC balancing within a bacterium in response to changes in the
immediate environment and hunger for nutrients.

Conclusions
Two of the cellular components that control the allocation of transcriptional resources are strain-specific, since
ppGpp and s S levels are potentially non-uniform in E.
coli under identical growth conditions. A significant complication in the systems biology of E. coli is that even the
regulatory relationship between ppGpp and RpoS is nonuniform across the species. The data from K-12 studies
suggests ppGpp should stimulate RpoS synthesis, but the

Ferenci et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:62
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/62

level of RpoS is not equally stimulated by high ppGpp in
all ECOR isolates. As shown in Figure 5, there appear to
be three groups of strains based on ppGpp/RpoS relationships, and in only one of these there is a discernible proportionality between ppGpp and RpoS concentrations. So
not only is there likely to be variation in individual components, but also variation in the interaction of components
of global networks. The new results suggest that the genes
involved in ppGpp synthesis and degradation are also subject to the same kind of selective pressures as is rpoS. This
has major consequences for the universality of the pattern
of expression of hundreds of genes controlled directly or
indirectly (by competition) at the level of RNA polymerase. The species-wide variation in the cellular concentration of two global directors of gene expression has
significant implications for systems biology, because these
regulators control many metabolic genes as well as gene
expression networks [5,14]. Equally importantly, many of
the numerous traits controlled by ppGpp [20,47-49] are
also likely to be subject to strain variation.

Methods
Strains and media

The origins of the ECOR strains is described in [31] and
the reference K-12 strain MG1655 was used for
comparisons.
T-salts is a Tris-buffered minimal medium supplemented with different concentrations of glucose and
KH2PO4 [18]. Minimal medium A (MMA) and L-agar
plates were as in [57].

ppGpp assay

ppGpp was extracted from cells growing at 37°C in
minimal medium containing 100 μCi/ml 32P-KH2PO4.
For ppGpp extraction from C-starved ECOR strains,
exponentially-growing cells were resuspended in T-salts
supplemented with 0.1% glucose, 0.25 mM 32P-KH2PO4
and all 20 amino acids (30 μg/ml each) and grown for
another 60 minutes. Methyl a-glucoside (a-MG) was
then added at a final concentration of 2% and samples
were withdrawn after 30 minutes in the single-point
experiments or at several time intervals in the kinetic
experiments.
Extraction of ppGpp from amino acid-starved cells
was as above except that amino acid starvation was
started by adding 1 mg/ml serine hydroxamate (SH) to
the cultures.
The labelled samples were mixed immediately with
0.5 volume of cold formic acid and stored overnight at
-20°C. The extracts were centrifuged for 5 minutes at
10,000 rpm to precipitate cell debris, and 3-5 μl were
applied to PEI-cellulose TLC-plates. The labelled
nucleotides were resolved by one-dimensional TLC
using 1.5 M KH2PO4 as solvent. The amounts of ppGpp
on the chromatograms were estimated by measuring the
radioactivity of the spots in a Phosphor-Imager (Molecular Dynamics) and calculating the level of ppGpp relative to that of GTP + ppGpp [58]. The densitometric
analysis was performed with the help of the Image J free
software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
Steady-state growth conditions in chemostats

Sequence analysis

The rpoS gene from different ECOR strains was amplified using the “universal” primer pair RpoS-F2 (5’CCAT AACGACACAATGCTGG) and RpoS-R2 (5’-CG
ACCATTCTCGGTTTTACC). PCR products were purified directly with Wizard DNA Preps DNA purification
system (Promega). The nucleotide sequence of the rpoS
gene was determined using either primer RpoS-F1 (5’TGATTACCTGAGTGCCTACG) or RpoS-F2 for the
first half and primer RpoS-I (5’- CTGTTAACG
GCCGAAGAAGA) for the second half of gene.
For the sequencing of the spoT ORF, DNA was amplified by PCR using primers spoTF1 (5’-CAGTATCAT
GCCCAGTCATTTCTTC) and spoTR2 (5’-GGTAGT
ACTGGTTTCGCCGTGCTC). Sequencing analysis of
both DNA strands were performed with primers
spoTF1, spoTF2 (5’-AAAAGCGTCGCCGAGCTGGTA
GAGG), spoTF3 (5’-TGATCGGCCCGCACGGTGT
GCCGG), spoTF5 (5’-TGATCGGCCCGCACGGT
GTGCCGG), spoTR1 (5’-TGCACCATCGCCATAAT
CATCTTGC), spoTR2 and spoTR3 (5’-CTTGATTTC
GGTGATGAACTCCTG). All sequence reactions were
done at the Australian Genome Research Facility.

T-salts supplemented with 0.02% glucose and 1.0 mM
KH2PO4 was used to set up a 80 ml chemostat culture
as described [32]. The dilution rate was set to 0.1 h-1.
Daily samples were taken to monitor the rpoS status of
members of the population. The rpoS status was determined by diluting the culture, growing the colonies on
LB plates and staining with iodine (see below).
Detection of rpoS status by iodine staining

The level of rpoS was qualitatively assessed by staining
glycogen with an iodine solution as described [59].
Patches of bacteria or diluted chemostat samples were
grown overnight on L-agar plates, stored at 4°C for 24 h
and then flooded with iodine. The intensity of the
brown colour varies according to the level of sS in the
cell [28,60]. rpoS+ strains stain brown to dark brown.
Quantitation of RpoS blots

Bacteria cultures were grown overnight in LB medium at
37°C. LB medium possesses a limiting amount of amino
acids that serve as main carbon sources. E. coli stops
growing following overnight growth due to carbon depletion [61]. Culture volumes corresponding to 2. 109 cells

were then centrifuged, resuspended in 200 μl application
buffer (0,5 M Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol,
10% glycerol and 0,01% bromophenol blue) and boiled
for 5 minutes. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a
12,5% gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(GE HealthCare) by capillary force. Following blocking
with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with
2,000-fold diluted monoclonal anti-RpoS antibodies
(Neoclone) and 20,000 fold diluted peroxidase conjugated
anti-mouseIgG (Pierce). The Super Signal West Pico kit
(Pierce) was used to detect the RpoS bands as recommended by the manufacturer. The membrane was
exposed to X-ray films for various periods of time and
the signal intensities on the autoradiograms were
scanned and computed using the Image J software.
