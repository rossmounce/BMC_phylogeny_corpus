Abstract
Background: While the gene flow in some organisms is strongly affected by physical barriers and geographical
distance, other highly mobile species are able to overcome such constraints. In southern South America, the Andes
(here up to 6,900 m) may constitute a formidable barrier to dispersal. In addition, this region was affected by cycles
of intercalating arid/moist periods during the Upper/Late Pleistocene and Holocene. These factors may have been
crucial in driving the phylogeographic structure of the vertebrate fauna of the region. Here we test these
hypotheses in the burrowing parrot Cyanoliseus patagonus (Aves, Psittaciformes) across its wide distributional range
in Chile and Argentina.
Results: Our data show a Chilean origin for this species, with a single migration event across the Andes during the
Upper/Late Pleistocene, which gave rise to all extant Argentinean mitochondrial lineages. Analyses suggest a
complex population structure for burrowing parrots in Argentina, which includes a hybrid zone that has remained
stable for several thousand years. Within this zone, introgression by expanding haplotypes has resulted in the
evolution of an intermediate phenotype. Multivariate regressions show that present day climatic variables have
a strong influence on the distribution of genetic heterogeneity, accounting for almost half of the variation in
the data.
Conclusions: Here we show how huge barriers like the Andes and the regional environmental conditions imposed
constraints on the ability of a parrot species to colonise new habitats, affecting the way in which populations
diverged and thus, genetic structure. When contact between divergent populations was re-established, a stable
hybrid zone was formed, functioning as a channel for genetic exchange between populations.

Background
Current molecular genetic methods allow the understanding of the genetic structure underlying different
populations of a species with previously unforeseen
resolution [e.g. [1-3]]. As a result, it is possible to undertake fundamental investigations in ecology and evolution, like the study of the influence of past and current
environmental conditions, together with ecological barriers, in shaping the population structure of wild animal
species. These studies provide a unique opportunity to
understand how species have evolved and how they are

organised across landscapes [4]. The constraints that
heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. barriers, resource distribution) and environmental conditions (e.g. climate)
impose on the ability of animals to colonise new habitats have genetic implications affecting the structure,
dynamics and persistence of populations [e.g. [5-9]].
Thus, significant genetic structuring can be expected
among populations where gene flow is restricted
[e.g. [5,10]].
However, when contact between divergent populations
is re-established, hybrid zones can form with resultant
consequences for the evolutionary trajectories of the
interbreeding populations [e.g. [11]]. Two scenarios
could potentially occur: if hybrid fitness is high, introgression will be widespread and hybridising populations

may become panmictic over time, replacing the original
populations [12]; but if interbreeding is limited in geographical range, hybridising populations may experience
genetic exchange without panmixia [e.g. [13]]. Under
such circumstances hybrid zones may persist over time
and function as channels for genetic exchange between
the populations, increasing overall levels of genetic and
phenotypic diversity [e.g. [14-17]].
Although Pleistocene climate conditions played an
important role in initiating major phylogeographical
structuring in today’s fauna [18], very little is known
about their effects on southern South American terrestrial vertebrates. Phylogeographic studies in this region
are scarce and have been conducted on rodents [19-21],
lizards [22-24], amphibians [9,25], and a bird species
[26]. Several of these studies suggested that the phylogeographic patterns observed, such as past fragmentation, range expansion, and secondary contact, could in
part be understood in light of Pleistocene climate conditions. There is evidence of several cycles of more arid
conditions intercalated with moist periods during the
Pleistocene and Holocene of Southern South America
[e.g. [27-30]], which were related to glaciation events
[31], influencing the vegetation distribution [32] and the
fauna depending on it.
One species that may allow hypotheses about gene
flow both across a heterogeneous distribution, and into
hybrid zones to be tested is the burrowing parrot (Cyanoliseus patagonus) (Aves, Psittaciformes). This species
is distributed in a particularly heterogeneous arid to
semi-arid landscape, across an extensive ~1,000,000 km2
range in Chile and Argentina. A previous study [33]
suggested that precipitation and temperature restrict
burrowing parrot distribution in Argentina. According
to this study [33], burrowing parrots are restricted to an
area with median annual precipitation up to 600 mm,
and annual average temperatures of no less than 8°C.
However, this topic merits further research, as the study
[33] was based on outdated distributional data and on
the plain interpretation of maps, without detailed statistical analyses. The most dominant feature of this region
is the high Andes, a mountain range that attains an altitude of up to 6,900 m and appears to separate burrowing parrot populations in Chile from those in Argentina.
The predominant ecosystem on the Chilean side of this
region is the ‘Matorral’, where vegetation is adapted to
the generally dry conditions of a Mediterranean climate
zone [34-36]. On the Argentinean side the semi-desert
scrubland known as the ‘Monte’ is predominant, and
this occurs from Patagonia to the North-west of Argentina [[37] and references therein]. Even though there are
no extrinsic barriers to parrot dispersal in Argentina,
more than 2,300 km separate the southernmost and
northernmost burrowing parrot populations there. In

addition, burrowing parrots breed in sandstone, limestone or earthen cliffs or “barrancas” (gorges or ravines),
where they excavate nest burrows and form colonies [e.
g. [37]]. These cliffs are heterogeneously located in the
driest parts of the burrowing parrots range, being commonly found along permanent or temporary rivers, lakeshores, and the seacoast. Given the dryness of this
environment, burrowing parrot colonies are never far
from freshwater on which they are completely dependent, as they need to drink several times per day [37,38]
(Figure S1). These specific requirements for nest sites,
which are spread over thousands of square kilometres,
and water, together with the colossal barrier of the
Andes, may favour the isolation of burrowing parrot
breeding sites and a complex population structure driven by genetic drift.
Due to the heterogeneity of habitats within this species’ range, four burrowing parrot sub-species have been
proposed, three of which are found in Argentina: C. p.
patagonus in Patagonia, C. p. andinus in the Cuyo
region to the west and north-west, and C. p. conlara
ranging in the San Luis region between the former two
(hereafter patagonus, andinus, conlara) [34,39,40]. The
sub-species C. p. bloxami (hereafter bloxami) is found
on the Andean foothills of Central Chile [34,41]. Three
of the sub-species, namely andinus, patagonus and bloxami, are clearly morphologically distinct (size and plumage coloration) [34], while some authors [34,40,42]
considered conlara a hybrid, owing to its intermediate
geographic location and phenotype, between patagonus
and andinus. Little is known about the genetic structure
of burrowing parrots and how this corresponds to the
morphological sub-species described above. A previous
study [43] attempted to address this using seven microsatellite markers and suggested moderate differentiation
between bloxami and all other subspecies, but differentiation within Argentinean samples was not detected.
Analysis of a larger sample using a uniparental marker
such a mitochondrial DNA may increase the resolution
of genetic structure in this species.
Burrowing parrots are currently threatened by intense
collection of birds for the pet trade [37], unjustified persecution as a crop pest [41,44] and strong habitat loss
and degradation, particularly in the Monte ecosystem
[45]. The latter could strongly reduce connectivity
among the populations, enhancing isolation. As key species in the Monte, any negative impact on burrowing
parrots could potentially affect other species since their
abandoned and semi-collapsed nests provide breeding
space to many other cavity nesters (such as insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals) [46].
Given the marked phenotypic differences between the
populations on both sides of the Andes we hypothesise
that gene flow across this high mountain range, the

Masello et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:16
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/16

largest barrier in the region, must be severely restricted.
We tested this hypothesis using three mtDNA loci, in a
large scale sampling effort covering almost the entire
species range. We also aimed to uncover the underlying
population structure of this species, determine their geographic origins and suggest possible routes of colonisation. We also used these data to determine if an
andinus-patagonus hybrid zone exists. Lastly, considering the conservation value of this key species, its potentially restricted distribution with respect to climatic
factors, and the unchecked degradation of their preferred habitats, we aim to ascertain the extent to which
ecological and climatic factors influence their population
structure.

Methods
Samples

Recently, various aspects of the breeding biology of this
species have been investigated extensively, providing the
necessary framework for this study [e.g. [37,38,47-57]].
Fieldwork was carried out from November to December
2007 (Argentina), February 2008 (northern Chile) and
from October to November 2008 (Argentina). Thirtythree colonies and eleven roosting places of the four
previously proposed sub-species (bloxami, andinus, conlara and patagonus) were visited and naturally moulted
feathers were non-invasively collected (Figure 1). Since
burrowing parrots moult their primary feathers at the
beginning of their breeding season, from November
onwards [38,58], collection is usually straightforward, as
feathers tend to accumulate at the bottom of the cliffs
with colonies. Taxonomic assignment of colonies was
conducted following previous studies [34,39]. The southernmost populations of bloxami in Chile were not
accessible.
Molecular methods

DNA was extracted from the feather quill, for a subset
of 3 - 29 individuals from each of 44 populations using
the DNAeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany).
Mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (cytb), cytochrome
oxidase subunit I (COI) and ATPase subunits 6/8 were
amplified via PCR using the following mitochondrialspecific primers: L15424 5’- ATCCCATTCCACCAT
ACTACTC, H15767 5’- ATGAAGGGATGTTCTACTACTGGTTG-3’( cytb, 586bp) [59], COI-F 5’CCTGCAGGAGGAGGAGAYCC-3’, COI-A 5’- AGTATAAGCGTCTGGGTAGTC-3’ (COI, 455bp) [60], and
CO2GQL 5’- GGACAATGCTCAGAAATCTGCGG-3’,
CO3HMH 5’- CATGGGCTGGGGTCRACTATGTG-3’
(ATP6/8, 818bp) [61]. PCRs were conducted in 20µl
reaction volumes containing 100 ng DNA template, 10
mM of each primer, 10 mM dNTPs (Roth, Karlsruhe),
3.125 mM MgCl, 5 U Taq Polymerase (Qiagen Taq

Page 3 of 16

Polymerase Core Kit) in a 1× PCR reaction buffer. PCR
commenced with denaturation at 94°C for 3 minutes,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 45 s,
annealing at 55°C (CO1, ATP6/8) or 52°C (cytb) for 45
s and extension at 72°C for 45 s. A final extension step
(10 min at 72°C) concluded the PCR. Products were
checked on a 1% agarose gel and purified of primers
and excess dNTPs using either exonuclease-shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas Life Sciences) or the
MinElu-te PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), following the
manufacturers specifications. PCR products were then
sequenced in both directions by either Qiagen (Qiagen
GmbH, Sample & Assay Technologies, Hilden, Germany) or by using Big Dye chemistry (Applied Biosystems) and run on an AB 3130xl genetic analyser
(Applied Biosystems). Sequences were checked, edited
and aligned in CLC DNA Workbench 5.5 (CLC bio). A
total of 150 individuals from 41 of the attempted 44
locations were suitable for downstream analyses (Table
1, 2, 3 and 4; see also Additional file 1 Table S1).
Analyses

Genetic variation was quantified as the number of haplotypes, nucleotide and haplotype diversity per population, and was determined using DnaSP v5 [62]. The
degree of population structuring was ascertained using a
Bayesian population assignment model that assumes noadmixture and that loci are linked BAPS 5 [63]. Unlike
other clustering algorithms, this BAPS module allows
the assumption of linkage between loci, thereby enabling
population assignments using multilocus mtDNA data.
The simulation was run ten times for K max values of
five, ten and 20 potential populations.
Phylogenetic structuring among haplotypes was investigated by maximum likelihood (ML) in Treefinder
[64,65], which first determined the best-fit substitution
model for each gene partition. ML analyses was carried
out assuming the HKY+G (cytb), HKY+I (CO1) and J2
+G (CO2/3) models, each optimising rate, frequency
and heterogeneity parameters directly from the data.
Models including a rate-heterogeneity parameter (+G)
assumed five gamma categories. The significance of
nodal bi-partitions was determined by 1,000 bootstrap
replicates, from which an 80% majority rule consensus
tree was constructed. We also constructed a medianjoining network using Network 4.5.1.6 [66] for a graphical representation of the unrooted relationships and frequency of haplotypes.
Demographic parameters based on the coalescent can
be useful in testing hypotheses of population history. In
particular, statistics based on the distribution of pairwise differences (mismatch distribution) [67] between
individuals in a population as well as the detection of
selection among selectively neutral loci may be used as

signatures of past population expansion events. We used
Arlequin 3.5 [68] to calculate the mismatch distributions
and Fu’s Fs for all populations identified by the clustering and phylogenetic methods above.
We roughly dated each node using a fossil calibration
technique that incorporates rate smoothing for lineages
with unequal rates of evolution. By constraining the tree
topology to that of the 80% majority rule consensus tree

calculated previously, we generated a range of node
height estimates by running a bootstrap analyses 1,000
times in Treefinder, using the original starting parameters. The variance in node height was then taken as
the spread of this variable in our data set. The fossil
record for C. patagonus is extremely scarce, with three
known fossils dated to 126 kyr [69-72]. A much earlier
fossil that can also be attributed to the genus

Cyanoliseus dates back to 750 kya [70-73]. However,
since the nearest outgroup taxon for which molecular
data were available belonged to the genus Diopsittaca, it
was not possible to utilise the older fossil date in our
calibration. We therefore assumed a minimum or latest
date of 126 kyr for the coalescence of all C. patagonus
lineages. We then performed the calibration analysis in
Treefinder and, due to the availability of a single calibration date, we used local rate minimum deformation
rate-smoothing, to account for the possibility of differing
rates of lineage evolution within the phylogeny. 95%
confidence intervals were generated from the spread of
node heights.
We investigated the possibility of differing mutation
rates among the three gene partitions in order to independently date each node using available mutation rates.

However, since reliable mutation rates are currently
only available for the avian cytochrome b gene [74], we
partitioned the sequence data into cyt b and CO1+CO2/
3 and performed identical analyses in BEAST 1.5.0 [75],
using the parameter-rich GTR+G+I model (with 5
gamma categories) to check if cyt b mutation rates may
be applied to other mitochondrial data. Plotting the
resulting cyt b node heights against those of CO1+CO2/
3 returned a correlation co-efficient (R2) value of 0.5858
(p < 0.001, data not shown), suggesting significantly differing rates of evolution between the two gene partitions. As a rate-smoothing option is unavailable in
BEAST, we proceeded with only the cytochrome b data,
using both the average avian mutation rate (µ) of 2.1%/
million years (myr) and a Psittaciform-specific rate of
3.4%/myr [74].

Given the possibility of a relatively recent divergence
and the apparent reliance of burrowing parrots on their
habitat and associated climate [33,37], we also investigated the extent to which taxonomic, ecological and climatic factors influenced the distribution of genetic
heterogeneity in the data. We fitted a linear model to
our data using DISTLM 5 [76], thereby testing the influence of 32 variables (4 taxonomic, 7 ecological and 21
climatic; Table 5 and Table S1) using multiple matrix
regressions. The climatic variables were selected taking
into account the possible restriction of burrowing parrots distribution to certain temperature and precipitation ranges as suggested in a previous study [33]. The
21 temperature- and precipitation-related climatic variables were obtained, for each of the burrowing parrot
colonies, with DIVA-GIS 7.1.7.2. [http://www.diva-gis.
org], which are based on the WorldClim database
[http://www.worldclim.org], version 1.3, at 2.5 minutes
resolution [77]. We first assessed the marginal genetic

variation explained by each set of variables separately.
Since some of these variables are likely to co-vary with
geography (latitude and longitude of sample locations),
we controlled for this influence by also reporting the
conditional residual variation remaining after the influence of geography was subtracted. Still controlling for
geography, we then tested all variables together using a
forward selection approach [78], which sequentially
determines the variables that explained the majority of
the marginal variation in the data. The significance of
all DISTLM regressions was determined by 9,999
permutations.
To explore the influence of the geographic landscape in
more detail, we used a spatial clustering algorithm, implemented in Tess 2.3.1 [79]. This method performs Bayesian clustering given a set of input sampling locations.
The program constructed Dirichlet cells around each
sampling location to produce a Voronoi tessalation. Multilocus DNA sequences were then used to statistically

infer population structure based on this Voronoi neighbourhood system using a hidden Markov random field
prior. Parameter space was explored by Markov chain
simulations. We ran the program ten times again with a
K max of five, ten and 20, assuming no-admixture at
50,000 sweeps each, with a burn-in of 10,000 sweeps. We
also included 23 dummy points, well outside the extant
distribution C. patagonus, in order to restrict the simulation to within the species range. The resulting hard-clustering image represents the geographical clustering of
individuals in landscape space, given their sampling origins and their multilocus genotypes. To allow the optimal
tessalation to be viewed in geographic space, the hard
clustering image with the lowest deviance information
criterion (DIC) score was imported into ArcGIS 9.3, and
superimposed onto a map of the region.

Results
Genetic variation

Complete sequences for all three mitochondrial fragments were obtained for 150 individuals from 41 locations (Tables 1, 2, 3 &4, and Additional file 1 Table S1),
representing 7 ecoregions and encompassing the entire
species range. However, since the quality of DNA isolated from shed feathers was low, this number was less
than half of the 327 individuals from which DNA was
extracted. Genetic variation was also low, with only 81
polymorphic sites from a concatenated sequence of
1,859 bp, resulting in 51 unique haplotypes (Tables 1, 2,
3 &4, and Additional file 2 Table S2). This was reflected
in a species-wide haplotype diversity of 0.943 and
nucleotide diversity of 0.00530 (Table 4), and given
varying locality samples sizes these values ranged from
0.500 - 1.000 and from 0 - 0.0360 respectively (Tables 1,
2, &3). Considering taxonomic designations, conlara
was found to have the highest nucleotide diversity. Nonconlara sampling localities, contained similar levels of
diversity, with the exception of eight localities with a
nucleotide diversity of less than 0.001. This is reduced
to only four localities, if we exclude those with fewer
than 3 individuals.
Genetic structure

Despite low diversity, Bayesian clustering consistently
structured the entire sample into four population clusters regardless of the Kmax prior, and the distributions
of these are depicted in Figure 1. One of the four populations corresponded exactly to the bloxami phenotype,
and was found exclusively on the Chilean side of the
species range (inset, Figure 1). Within Argentina, only
two members of the northern andinus phenotype did
not fall within an Andinus population cluster, and the
patagonus phenotype was divided into two populations,
hereafter called Patagonus1 and Patagonus2. There was

Page 8 of 16

no support for the existence of the intermediate conlara,
as this phenotype clustered either within the Andinus or
Patagonus2 populations, with a single conlara clustered
within Patagonus1.
Maximum likelihood analysis recovered a fully
resolved haplotype phylogeny (Figure 2A) again showing
four population groups, but with Bloxami as basal and
distinct from all other populations. Within Argentina,
the northern Andinus forms a sister relationship with
the entire Patagonus population, with the two most
ancestral haplotypes of the latter sampled in the Cuyo
region (locations 3 to 9, and 16, Figure 1), among phenotypically andinus populations. In Patagonia, the patagonus subspecies is divided into the genetically distinct
populations Patagonus1 and Patagonus2, yet without
distinguishing phenotypic characteristics. A median-joining haplotype network (Figure 2B) confirmed the large
divergence separating populations on either side of the
Andes, but also demonstrated that all three Argentinean
populations contain star-shaped haplotype clusters in
which several less-frequent haplotypes are very closely
related to a single common haplotype. Both phylogeny
and network showed that individuals identified as conlara or “undetermined” (where phenotype could not be
assigned to andinus or patagonus with certainty)
belonged to either the Andinus (11/33 individuals; 5/14
haplotypes) or Patagonus (Patagonus1: 1/55 individuals,
1/15 haplotypes; Patagonus2: 18/51 individuals, 6/16
haplotypes) populations (Figure 2 A/B), confirming a
hybrid origin for this phenotype. The six undetermined
individuals (5 haplotypes) that were sampled within the
conlara range from a population near the town of San
Luis and from the Quinto river were most closely
related to confirmed conlara haplotypes on the medianjoining network (Figure 2B), showing that both populations are admixed and therefore belong within conlara.
Population History

Mismatch distributions of pair-wise nucleotide differences (Figure 2C) showed largely unimodal distributions
among Argentinean populations, but was multimodal
within the Chilean Bloxami. Bloxami was also the only
population where the hypothesis of a sudden population
expansion was rejected (p(SSD) = 0.0290). Furthermore,
negative and significant Fu’s Fs values, also indicating
population expansion, were recovered for Andinus, Patagonus1 and Patagonus2, with the slightly negative value
for Bloxami not significant. Assuming a fossil calibration
of at least 126 kyr for the coalescence of all C. patagonus lineages, we estimated dates for all population
nodes to between 9 and 55 kya (Additional file 3 Table
S3). Applying the average avian mutation rate (µ =
2.1%/myr) to the cytochrome b data returned higher
nodal divergence estimates with much larger 95%

confidence intervals. However, the psittaciform-specific
mutation rate (µ = 3.4%/myr) yielded estimates very
similar to those of the fossil calibration method. Owing
to the larger variance of BEAST estimates, the 95%
interval of almost all fossil calibration dates was contained entirely within the psittaciform-rate interval
(Additional file 3 Table S3). The only exception being
node E, although both fossil and µ estimates did overlap.
Indeed, if a divergence time (T) of 126 kyr for all burrowing parrots was substituted into the equation µ =
node height/2T, a mutation rate of 3.5%/myr would
result, implying that the cytochrome b gene evolves
more rapidly among psittaciform species. The 95% confidence intervals of the fossil calibrated population
nodes reflect the stochasticity in the maximum likelihood estimation and the lack of internal calibration
nodes. Their accuracy, therefore, relies heavily on that
of the 126 kyr fossil estimate, for which there exist three
independently dated fossils [69-72]. In contrast, the
much larger variance of BEAST estimates may reflect
the limitations of using only a third of the total available
data. We therefore continue with the more accurate fossil calibrated estimates (Figure 2A), and we view these
as the latest range of dates by which each lineage splitting event could have occurred.
Influences on genetic variation

Since extant burrowing parrot populations appear to
have evolved relatively recently, one might expect to
find genetic structure to be associated to present-day
ecological and environmental variables. The amount of
marginal variation explained by predictor variables was
highest for the suite of 21 climatic variables (85%) followed by phenotype (22%) and lastly ecoregions (0.81%).
This pattern held true even when the variation attributable to geography was removed in conditional tests
(Table 5). When each climatic variable was tested individually, temperature seasonality, isothermality, temperature annual range, mean temperature of warmest
quarter and maximum temperature of warmest month
could all account for more than 15% of the conditional
variation in the data set. When autocorrelations between
these variables were taken into account in sequential
tests, only temperature seasonality (28%) and precipitation seasonality (11%) were found to explain more than
10% of the genetic variation (Table 5).
The 44% of genetic variation explained by geography
was partitioned into the four already-defined population
clusters by TESS software. The optimal tessellation cluster was obtained consistently for all runs and for all
starting Kmax values and this partitioned Chilean from
Argentinean populations, as have previous analyses (Figure 2). Spatial structuring within Argentina describes

Page 10 of 16

genetically Andinus haplotypes in the Cuyo region, to
the north of the species range, whereas in Patagonia,
Patagonus1 inhabits the entire Atlantic coast and a thin
wedge between southern limit of Andinus and the north
of the Río Colorado valley (Figure 3). The Patagonus2
population occupies a non-contiguous area along the
entire course of the Río Colorado and except for a
population in which Patagonus1 is particularly dominant, also the entire course of the Río Negro until just
before it enters the Atlantic Ocean. Some Patagonus2
haplotypes also range north into the San Luis region,
which is the southern-eastern end of the Andinus distribution, where hybridization with Andinus results in the
conlara phenotype.

Discussion
Origins and gene flow across the Andes

Although we were not able to access populations to the
south of the Bloxami range in Chile, it is nevertheless
apparent that very limited gene flow across the Andes
has rendered the Bloxami populations both genetically
and phenotypically distinct from all other burrowing
parrots. This further corroborates a previous study
using microsatellite loci that showed a clear separation
between Chilean and Argentinean populations, but no
structure within Argentina [43]. By contrast, cluster
analyses of 3 mitochondrial fragments suggest a complex population structure for burrowing parrots in
Argentina. Since the Bloxami split is at the root of the
species phylogeny, and that this is the only population
to not bear any of the signatures of a recent population
expansion (Figure 2B/C), we suggest a Chilean origin
for this species, with a single migration event across
the Andes that gave rise to all extant Argentinean
mitochondrial lineages (Figure 3). Although the
sampled Chilean lineages coalesce to only 12 - 34 kya,
their southern range was not sampled and the Bloxami
mismatch distribution (Figure 2C) suggests a population with no significant changes in effective population
size over time. Furthermore, the network of Bloxami
lineages (black circles, Figure 2B) describes a population with several haplotypes in low frequency, none of
which are related to each other by fewer than two
mutational steps, implying that intermediate and other
more distant haplotypes, that could have increased the
Bloxami coalescence time, were either lost or not
sampled.
In contrast, the histories of all populations in Argentina are characterised by recent (between 9 - 55 kya)
expansion (Figure 2 B/C). The migration event across
the Andes therefore dates roughly to between 55 - 126
kya, to a time when the southern and central reaches of
that mountain range were heavily glaciated [e.g.

Argentina. A model for the colonisation and diversification events that have shaped mitochondrial population structure is also depicted. Each

graphical representation of the high Andes in the region has been added (in light brown) together with the exact location of all known passes
in the region.

[28,31,32,80]], making a crossing over the lower (< 2,500
m) passes in these areas impossible for want of water
and shelter until at least 14 kya [80]. Instead, we suggest
a crossing over one of the few intermediate (2,500 4,000 m) mountain passes to the north of the presentday species distribution (Figure 3). Although rare, recent
evidence of exactly such a crossing from Chile into the

Mendoza region of Argentina by a Peruvian pelican
(Pelecanus thagus), where all passes are higher than
2,500 m, shows that bird migration across the high
Andes is biologically possible [81]. The resulting founder
effect of an Andean crossing may also help to explain
the contrasting size and plumage differences that exist
between bloxami and andinus [34].

Gene and phenotype divergence in Argentina

The initial divergence of Andinus-Patagonus mitochondrial lineages during the late Pleistocene 34 - 55 kya
represents a clear asynchrony between genetic and phenotypic divergence times within this species. The two
most ancestral haplotypes assigned to the Patagonus1
population (Figure 2A/B) are phenotypically andinus
individuals, sampled among andinus locations in the
Cuyo region, at least 500 km from the andinus-patagonus hybrid zone in San Luis. Since older Patagonus haplotypes were not detected, despite a sample of 106
patagonus individuals from across their entire distribution, we propose that phenotypic divergence between
Andinus and Patagonus lagged genetic divergence, by 3
- 41 kyr, which is the minimum-maximum time difference between the initial Andinus-Patagonus and the
Patagonus1-Patagonus2 divergences. Further evidence
that phenotypic differences take longer to evolve in this
species is the genetic diversification of Patagonus1 from
Patagonus2 within Patagonia, which occurred no later
than 9 kya, yet the two populations still remain phenotypically indistinguishable from each other. This lag in
phenotypic divergence may result from greater lineage
sorting among mitochondrial genomes, and whether it
holds true for slower evolving unlinked regions such as
nuclear introns remains to be investigated.
Colonisation and diversification

Summarising the results and available information, we
propose a model for the colonisation and diversification
events to have shaped the distribution of genetic variation in burrowing parrots (Figure 3). The presence of
ancestral Patagonus haplotypes within the range of andinus implies that genetic diversification of these two
populations occurred in the Cuyo region, with phenotypic diversification occurring later (after 21 kya, see
Figure 2A) as Patagonus expanded south-east (see
model, Figure 3). Since burrowing parrots are completely dependent on water and suitable strata in which to
form nests [e.g. [37]], we predicted the population structure to be a product of isolation and hence local genetic
drift. Our results suggest, rather, a low degree of isolation since most sampling localities are similarly diverse,
indicating gene flow between them. This is most likely
owing to suitable habitats being continuously distributed
along river courses and because burrowing parrots are
able to make one to four foraging trips to a distance of
up to 66 km from their colonies in a single day [37].
Hence, we conclude that the south-eastern expansion of
genetically Patagonus individuals probably followed the
courses of the Bermejo-Desaguadero-Atuel, Colorado
and Negro river systems, which were already in existence by that time [28,82]. By 14 - 31 kya, Patagonus
was established along river courses, and along the

Page 12 of 16

Atlantic coast of Patagonia (Figure 3). The end of the
last glacial maximum (LGM) ~14 kya saw the establishment of wetter, more suitable habitats in north-western
Patagonia [e.g. [27-30,80]] and possibly promoted
further diversification into Patagonus2 between 9 - 21
kya. Spatial clustering shows that the Holocene expansion of Patagonus2 lineages has rendered this population
dominant in much of north-western Patagonia, between
the Andes and the Atlantic (Figure 3), especially along
and to the south of the Río Negro, where only few
populations contain Patagonus1 haplotypes in high
frequency.
Secondary contact

Our results convincingly demonstrate the existence of a
hybrid zone in the San Luis region, where Patagonus
(Patagonus2 in all but one case) haplotypes expanding
into the south-eastern range of Andinus resulted in the
evolution of an intermediate phenotype: conlara, and
this is also the most genetically diverse of the four burrowing parrot taxonomic groupings. The dynamics of
hybrid zones are of great interest, especially their potential to give rise to new species or populations [e.g. [11]].
While our results warrant a thorough study of the Andinus-Patagonus hybrid zone using nuclear DNA markers,
mitochondrial data reveal several processes of interest.
We found no significant difference between the proportion of conlara individuals belonging to Andinus and
Patagonus2 (c2 = 0.003, df = 1, P = 0.960) and Andinus
and all Patagonus (c2 = 2.7, df = 1, P = 0.102) suggesting, firstly that there is no sex bias in dispersing Patagonus individuals, and secondly that there was no bias by
resident Andinus against the choice of invading Patagonus individuals as potential mates. From our phylogeny
(Figure 2A), we also conclude that the observed level of
introgression resulted from at least four, possibly independent, migration events by Patagonus individuals.
Within the Patagonus2 clade, four conlara-undetermined haplotypes comprise an entire sub-clade, suggesting that they resulted from a single successful migration
event, and given the depth of this sub-clade, Patagonus2
introgression may date back to at least the latter half of
the Holocene (inference, Figure 2A). Similarly, the most
ancestral of Andinus haplotypes was carried by a conlara individual and dates back to the coalescence of the
Andinus clade (14 - 34 kya). Together with the morphological conformity of the conlara phenotype within its
range [83], this result strongly suggests a hybrid zone
that has remained stable for several thousand years. The
inability of seven polymorphic microsatellite loci to discriminate among Argentinean populations [43] also suggests a hybrid zone that has remained stable long
enough for homoplasy to mask phylogeographic signal
in hypervariable markers. Since phenotypic variation

Masello et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:16
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/16

across the andinus-conlara-patagonus continuum,
appears to be discretely, rather than continuously partitioned, implying that gene flow out of the hybrid zone is
lower that gene flow into it, the possibility of the conlara phenotype being selectively advantageous in the
San Luis region cannot be ruled out.
The effect of climate

Our data show that up to 48% of the genetic variation
can be accounted for by present-day climatic variables,
considerably greater than the variation accounted for
phenotype and ecoregions. This is even more surprising
since ecoregions would normally be expected to co-vary
with climate. This lack of variation attributable to ecoregion might be explained by the fact that the two major
constraints on burrowing parrots habitat suitability,
namely availability of water and cliffs, are not included
in ecoregion definitions. Even the significant correlation
with present-day climate appears counterintuitive since
climatic conditions in the past are more likely to have
had an influence over population structure. However, if
we consider that the majority of the haplotypes within
Patagonus1/2 and Andinus most likely evolved after the
LGM 14 kya or more recently (Figure 2A), and that
local climatic conditions have remained relatively similar
in the last 8 kyr [e.g. [28-30,80]], this result is less surprising. Conservation implications of this are particularly
important in the present-day reality of climate change.
Conservation implications

The lack of gene flow makes the high Andes an important barrier to migration in burrowing parrots, and possibly in other bird species [e.g. [81]]. This also renders the
isolated Bloxami population genetically and phenotypically distinct. This evolutionary significance is important
from a conservation and management perspective. Burrowing parrots are listed as ‘’threatened’’ species in the
vertebrate red list of Chile and as such are legally protected [84]. This is because only 5,000 - 6,000 bloxami
are distributed in the IV and VII regions of the country
[41,85]. The size and uniqueness of this population
means that further reductions should be avoided.
The situation differs considerably in Argentina, where
burrowing parrots are officially considered an abundant
agricultural pest (National Law of Defence of Agricultural Production 6704/63), despite agricultural damage
occurring only locally [40,86], with very little actual crop
damage recorded [37,44]. Owing to its persecution as a
pest species [[37] and references therein], several colonies have been destroyed or severely reduced in size,
including the extirpation of the largest known colony
of some 50,000 nests [87]. Collection of burrowing
parrots for the pet trade was also encouraged [88]
and population reductions continued to reach levels

Page 13 of 16

considerable enough for the regional government of the
Río Negro province to ban all hunting and trade (resolutions 23-DF-2004, 24-DF-2004, Dirección de Fauna de la
Provincia de Río Negro, Argentina), thereby extending
legal protection to all but seven Patagonian colonies.
This protection effectively includes the bulk of the Patagonus population, approximately 40,000 nests, where
genetic diversity is partitioned into two genetically distinct, yet phenotypically indistinguishable populations,
which are impossible to manage separately. It should be
noted, however, that 37,000 of these nests are located in
a single colony - El Cóndor (sampling location 39, Figure 1) [37], which is located in an area undergoing habitat degradation that is estimated to be ten times higher
(3.7% annually) [45] than the world average of 0.4%
[89]. The continued existence of the burrowing parrot
in Patagonia is therefore uncertain.
A negative side effect of the recent protection of
Patagonian populations is the noticeable increase in
commercial value of Andinus populations in the Cuyo
region. All available data from this study (Tables 1, 2
&3) and the literature [90], together with unpublished
data of 1 colony for which we did not obtain sequences,
La Manga stream, La Rioja, 290 nests) show that the
total Andinus population numbers no more than 2,000
nests. In contrast to Patagonus, where individuals are
genetically but not phenotypically distinguishable, Andinus populations are distinctive both genetically (Figures
2 and 3) and phenotypically [34] from Patagonus, comprising an evolutionary significant unit that appears to
be kept isolated by the Andes to the West and a stable
hybrid zone to the South-east. We suggest a complete
stop of trade in the Cuyo region and the development
of conservation measures, particularly of the cliffs
with colonies, which are crucial for the survival this
population.
Most alterations in the environment, like climate
change, are potential sources of new or intensified directional selection on traits important for the fitness of the
species living in it [e.g. [91]]. Evolutionary responses
take place on a time scale comparable to that of changes
in climate, but the degree of adaptation will depend on
the interplay of natural selection with processes such as
gene flow, genetic drift, mutation and demography [e.g.
[92]]. The tight link between genetic variation and climatic variables here reported, in light of the present-day
reality of climate change, could lead to important conservation implications in burrowing parrots. Climate
change is likely to impose selection pressures on traits
important for fitness [e.g. [91]], thus affecting the
chances of persistence of this species. Furthermore, climate change could differently affect the four population
clusters detected throughout the species range and, in
addition, the populations could vary in the rate of

Masello et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:16
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/16

adaptation. Consequently the outcome of climate
change, on top of other environmental constraints (e.g.
presence of water and Monte vegetation, occurrence of
cliffs), could be particularly important for some of the
populations, in particular the currently endangered
Bloxami and Andinus populations. Under added selection pressure, such as that imposed by ongoing climate
change, populations can respond in roughly three ways:
1) by shifting in abundance and distribution, 2) by going
extinct, or 3) by evolving [93]. Even if predicting which
one, or even which combinations of them, will occur is
difficult [92,93], some likely scenarios can be expected
for the burrowing parrot population clusters. Shifts in
the distribution could be possible in the case of Bloxami,
distributed in Chile. Due to intensive poaching, several
cliffs along the historical distribution of the species (Figure 1), which traditional contained colonies, have been
found to be empty at present [41,85] (JFM pers. observ.).
Provided that water and natural food items are still
available in those places, and that the current small size
of Bloxami is not further reduced, these colonies could
be reoccupied by burrowing parrots. The situation
appears to be quite different for the size-reduced Andinus population in the Cuyo region of Argentina (Additional file 4 Figure S1). In this area, only few suitable
breeding places (high cliffs close to water and Monte
vegetation) are available, leaving this population only
two possibilities in case of strong or too sudden climate
change: going extinct or evolving. For Patagonus1 and
Patagonus2, two genetically distinct, yet phenotypically
indistinguishable populations, the situation appears to
differ again. In a few occasions, individuals from several
colonies of these populations were found to breed in
nests dug in human-build structures like shafts of
mines, abandoned adobe buildings and wells for collecting water for cattle [94]. Additionally, some suitable
breeding places are available in the southernmost as
well in the easternmost areas of the historical distribution of the species. Provided the future occurrence of a
more benign climate in the South and a release of
human-induced pressure in the East, some of those
areas could be used by burrowing parrots. However, the
currently rapid habitat degradation in the region inhabited by Patagonus1 and Patagonus2 (see above) makes
this possibility very uncertain, as in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation of the populations
and dramatically alter their genetic composition [95].
Altogether, how closely adaptation can be expected to
accommodate climate change and the additional pressure of habitat loss and fragmentation, remains a question for further research.
