Abstract
Background: The exceptionally diverse species flocks of cichlid fishes in East Africa are prime
examples of parallel adaptive radiations. About 80% of East Africa's more than 1 800 endemic
cichlid species, and all species of the flocks of Lakes Victoria and Malawi, belong to a particularly
rapidly evolving lineage, the haplochromines. One characteristic feature of the haplochromines is
their possession of egg-dummies on the males' anal fins. These egg-spots mimic real eggs and play
an important role in the mating system of these maternal mouthbrooding fish.
Results: Here, we show that the egg-spots of haplochromines are made up of yellow pigment cells,
xanthophores, and that a gene coding for a type III receptor tyrosine kinase, colony-stimulating factor
1 receptor a (csf1ra), is expressed in egg-spot tissue. Molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that the
extracellular ligand-binding and receptor-interacting domain of csf1ra underwent adaptive
sequence evolution in the ancestral lineage of the haplochromines, coinciding with the emergence
of egg-dummies. We also find that csf1ra is expressed in the egg-dummies of a distantly related
cichlid species, the ectodine cichlid Ophthalmotilapia ventralis, in which markings with similar
functions evolved on the pelvic fin in convergence to those of the haplochromines.
Conclusion: We conclude that modifications of existing signal transduction mechanisms might
have evolved in the haplochromine lineage in association with the origination of anal fin eggdummies. That positive selection has acted during the evolution of a color gene that seems to be
involved in the morphogenesis of a sexually selected trait, the egg-dummies, highlights the
importance of further investigations of the comparative genomic basis of the phenotypic
diversification of cichlid fishes.

Background
Cichlid fishes in general, and the species flocks of cichlids
in the East African Great Lakes in particular, are premier
examples of animal adaptive radiations [1-4]. The cichlid

species flocks of Lakes Victoria, Malawi and Tanganyika
are an excellent model system to study the genetic basis of
organismal diversity, because of their enormous phenotypic diversity, their species-richness, their close relatedPage 1 of 13

ness and the repeated occurrences of evolutionary
parallelisms (see e.g., [2,3,5,6]). About 80% of East
Africa's endemic cichlid species, and all species of the species flocks of Lakes Victoria and Malawi (plus one lineage
from Lake Tanganyika) belong to a particularly successful
lineage of cichlids, the haplochromines [7-9]. Only a few
synapomorphies of the haplochromines have been identified to date. All taxa appear to have a similar type of
upper pharyngeal bones [10]. Two additional characteristic features of the haplochromines are a polygynous and/
or polygynandrous mating system and maternal mouthbrooding, with only females incubating the eggs in their
buccal cavities, as well as 'egg-dummies' (ocelli) in the
form of ovoid markings on the anal fins of males that
mimic real eggs in size, color and shape [7,11-16] (Figure
1).
The males' yellow to orange egg-spots play a crucial role
in the haplochromines' mating system in that they serve
as intra-specific sexual advertisement to attract females
and to maximize breeding success [11,16,17], possibly as
a response to predation pressure from con-specifics [18]:
A female with ripe eggs initiates breeding by approaching
a territorial courting male, which responds with a lateral
display in the form of quivering and fluttering the
unpaired anal, caudal and dorsal fins, thereby exposing its
bright coloration. The female lays a small batch of eggs
(Figure 1b), circles around, and picks them up in her
mouth (Figure 1c) before fertilization. Attracted by the
egg-spots on the males' anal fin, the female attempts to
ingest these dummies and brings her mouth into close
proximity to the males' genital opening – this is when the
male discharges sperm (Figure 1d; see Additional file 1).
In this way, the fertilization of the eggs takes place within
the females' mouth [11,12,14,15]. We note that some variations from this general procedure have been reported.
For example, in some species the eggs are fertilized before
being picked up by the female [19]. Haplochromine
females were shown to prefer males with egg-spots over
males where the dummies had been removed [17] or
manipulated experimentally [20], and it has been suggested that sexual selection on egg-spot morphology
could lead to speciation [21].
Haplochromine egg-dummies begin to form in the juvenile stage of males and start out from the edge of the anal
fin [12], though they only begin to brighten when the
young males reach sexual maturity. Haplochromine species differ greatly in egg-spot number, arrangement and
morphology. Anal fin egg-dummies are, however, not an
exclusive male characteristic. In some species, females also
show ovoid markings on their anal fins, but these are typically much less conspicuous than the egg-spots of males.
A typical haplochromine egg-dummy is characterized by a
conspicuous yellow to reddish central area and a more or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/51

less transparent outer ring [11,12,14]. This type of eggdummy is found in most riverine and rock-dwelling haplochromines, while other species, such as more ancestral
riverine taxa or pelagic and sand-dwelling species in Lake
Malawi, sometimes show a more amorphic blotch pattern. Additionally, a small number of extant haplochromines lack egg-spots entirely, and it has been
suggested that they have lost their dummies secondarily
[7].
Yellow blotches that also act as egg-dummies are also
known from a few species of the Lake Tanganyika tribe
Ectodini, which are only distantly related to the haplochromines (see e.g., [22]). However, the ectodines' eggdummies are morphologically less complex than those of
the haplochromines and they are found on the paired pelvic fins instead of the unpaired anal fins as in haplochromines. Finally, some mouthbrooding Tilapia species
have evolved filamentous arborescent appendages at their
genital papillae, so-called genital tassels, which act as eggdummies [11,14].
Here, we report on the identification of a gene that is
likely to play a role in the development of the yellow xanthophores in the haplochromines' egg-spots. We hypothesized that a previously isolated xanthophore-related
color gene might be involved in the formation of xanthophores in the egg-spots: The colony-stimulating factor 1
receptor a (csf1ra) gene, coding for a type III receptor tyrosine kinase [23,24], is known to be expressed by cells of
the xanthophore lineage in zebrafish; it is essential for
recruiting xanthophores from their precursors, and it is
indirectly involved in the organization of the dark melanophores [25,26]. Zebrafish mutants for csf1ra (panther)
exhibit disrupted stripe patterns and lack xanthophores
[25], and it has been shown that some species in the genus
Danio vary in their csf1ra pathway during pigment pattern
formation [27]. csf1ra is, thus, not only an important
marker for the xanthophore lineage in zebrafish, but is
also involved in xanthophore development and, possibly,
color patterning. In addition to its role in body coloration,
csf1ra is expressed in the macrophage and osteoclast cell
lineage in zebrafish [25]. We performed RT-PCR and in
situ hybridization experiments in several haplochromine
cichlid species in order to confirm the expression of csf1ra
in the males' egg-spots. For detailed evolutionary analyses, we determined the DNA sequence of this gene locus
in 19 East African cichlid species and tested for the signature of adaptive evolution in the haplochromine lineage.
Finally, we also tested for csf1ra expression in the ectodine
species Ophthalmotilapia ventralis, which has egg-dummies
at the end of the paired pelvic fins.

Haplochromine evolution in Africa
Haplochromine evolution in Africa. (a) Consensus phylogeny of East African cichlids based on mitochondrial [7] and
nuclear DNA markers (this study). The haplochromines are derived from the much older cichlid species assemblage of Lake
Tanganyika. In only about two million years of evolution, the haplochromines gave rise to spectacular adaptive radiations in
Lakes Tanganyika (~30 species), Malawi (up to 1000 species) and Victoria (~500 species), as well as in other lakes and rivers in
Africa (up to 200 species) [1,3,7–9]. Evolutionary innovations are mapped onto the phylogeny [7]. Note that mouthbrooding
evolved several times during cichlid evolution, but only the haplochromines show a characteristic polygynous maternal mouthbrooding system with egg-spots as sexual advertisement [7,11–14,17]. (b-d) The egg-spots on the anal fins of male haplochromines play a crucial role in the haplochromines' reproductive system. Three main phases of the spawning cycle are shown:
(b) the female lays a small batch of eggs in the territory of a male. (c) The female takes up the eggs into her mouth. (d) The
male presents its conspicuous egg-spots on his anal fin. The female is attracted by these egg-dummies and tries to pick them up,
thereby bringing her mouth close to the male's genital opening, through which sperm is released.

Results
Gene expression assays
By applying a fluorescence-based detection method, we
first confirmed that the yellowish center of the haplo-

chromines' egg-spots consists of a particular class of pigment cells, the xanthophores (Figure 2). The subsequent
RT-PCR experiments from egg-spot tissue of A. burtoni
were positive for the xanthophore-related color gene

csf1ra. This was further confirmed by in situ hybridization
experiments documenting csf1ra expression in the males'
egg-dummies in all tested haplochromine species that displayed these ovoid markings (Figure 3a–k). In Astatotilapia
burtoni males, which have up to a dozen egg-spots that are
organized in two or more rows, we detected csf1ra expression in the developmentally younger and still growing
egg-spots in proximity to the edge of the anal fin (Figure
3a–d), which is exactly where new egg-dummies begin to
form [12]. Males of the Pseudotropheus sp. 'bicolor' population used for this study show a single egg-spot only, in
which csf1ra is also expressed (Figure 3e–h). Similarly,
csf1ra expression was detected in the yellow markings of
Thoracochromis brauschi (Figure 3i–k), a member of a basal
riverine haplochromine lineage [7] with rather unstructured yellow blotches. The egg-spot free anal fins of P.
multicolor [7,12], however, do not show csf1ra expression
(Figure 3m–p). This is not due to the use of a heterologous
probe designed on the basis of csf1ra from A. burtoni, as
other patterns in P. multicolor skin revealed csf1ra positive
results (see below). Female anal fins and negative controls
did not show any labeling (Figure 3). Furthermore, we
determined csf1ra expression in the pearly spot pattern in
the dorsal fin of A. burtoni and P. multicolor (Figure 3q–u)
and in the posterior part of the anal fin of T. brauschi (Figure 3l). Expression of csf1ra was also detected in the tassels
at the tips of the conspicuously elongated paired ventral
fins of males of the non-haplochromine Tanganyikan species Ophthalmotilapia ventralis, where these yellow markings also function as egg-dummies [14] (Figure 3v–x), but
not in the similarly elongated female ventral fins of O.
ventralis that lack egg-dummies (Figure 3y, z).
Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses of the
csf1ra locus
We sequenced more than 7 000 bp of the csf1ra locus of
19 cichlid species representing the phylogenetic diversity

of cichlids in East Africa (Figure 4a–c). Our phylogenetic
analyses, based on the intron sequences of the csf1ra locus
(> 4 000 bp; Figure 4d), confirmed previous phylogenetic
hypotheses by placing the representatives of the Bathybatini and Trematocarini as sister group to a clade comprised by the substrate spawning lamprologines
(represented by A. calvus, L. teugelsi, and T. bifrenatus) and
the East African mouthbrooding cichlids (remaining taxa)
[7,22,28]. The haplochromines (yellow box in Figure 4d)
form a strongly supported monophyletic clade within
these mouthbrooders, with P. multicolor, T. brauschi and A.
alluaudi branching off ancestrally to the exceptionally species-rich 'modern haplochromines' represented by A. burtoni, C. moorii, H. bloyeti, H. obliquidens, P. sp., and X.
phytophagus [7]. The bootstrap values were generally high,
except for the branches connecting the four main lineages
of haplochromines. Just as in our previous molecular phylogenetic analysis [7], the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test did
not favor a particular phylogenetic hypothesis with
respect to the interrelationship of the four main lineages
of haplochromines.
The ancestral state reconstructions using a consensus tree
on the basis of this newly-generated phylogenetic hypothesis (Figure 4d) and a previously published mitochondrial phylogeny [7] revealed that both the particular
mating system and the egg-dummies on male anal fins are
likely to have evolved only once in the ancestral lineage of
the haplochromines (see Figure 1a). Thus, the lack of eggspots in a few haplochromine species is most likely due to
secondary loss.
We then tested for the existence of a signal of adaptive
sequence evolution in the coding region of csf1ra. This
gene consists of 21 exons with a combined length of 2 928
bp, and is made up of a cysteine-rich extracellular ligandbinding domain composed of five immunoglobulin-like

In situ hybridization experiments showing csf1ra expression in cichlids. (a-d) In male Astatotilapia burtoni (a), which
typically have more than 10 egg-spots arranged into two or more rows (b), we could detect csf1ra expression in the forming
(c) as well as in the growing egg-dummies (d; the position of the yellowish inner circle, ic, and the transparent outer ring, tr, is
indicated). Note that the yellow pigments of the egg-spots are removed during tissue processing. (e-h) In male Pseudotropheus
sp. 'bicolor' (e), for which we used a morph with only one egg-spot (f), csf1ra expression was detected throughout the entire
egg-spot (g), and it appears that the dark melanophores arrange around the center of csf1ra expression (h), just as reported for
zebrafish, where csf1ra is indirectly also responsible for melanophore organization [25]. (i-l) In male Thoracochromis brauschi (i),
csf1ra is expressed in the yellow blotches of the anal fin (j, k), and also in the pearly spots ('Perlfleckmuster') on the posterior
part of the anal fin (l). (m-p) In the basal riverine haplochromine Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor (m), the male anal fins do not
exhibit egg-spot like blotches (n) and no csf1ra expression could be detected either (o, p). (q-u) csf1ra is expressed in the yellowish/orange areas of the pearly spot pattern on the dorsal fins of male A. burtoni (q-s) and P. multicolor (t, u). (v-z) csf1ra is
expressed in the egg-dummies on the tassels at the tips of the conspicuously elongated pelvic fins of the ectodine cichlid Ophthalmotilapia ventralis (v-x). Female fins of O. ventralis (y) do not show csf1ra expression (z). The control experiments show that
csf1ra is not expressed in female anal fins or in the "sense" control. Arrowheads refer to identical points in sequential images.

kinase I domain (TK I) a glycine-rich region (GLY-rich) and a conserved leucine (LEU) is found, the tyrosine kinase II domain
(TK II) contains a conserved tyrosine (TYR). The asterisk indicates that in one species, X. phytophagus, the otherwise conserved cysteine at amino acid position 450 has been replaced by a tryptophan. (d) Maximum likelihood phylogeny based on

branches not supported by high bootstrap values or a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test. (e) Branch-scaled tree showing the dN/dS

domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular
domain with two separate tyrosine kinase domains
[23,29] (Figure 4a, c). A sliding window analysis with
DNASP [30] uncovered several sections in csf1ra of haplochromines with a dN/dS ratio greater than one (Figure
4b), which would indicate that positive selection has
acted to shape the protein. These regions were primarily
located in the first 1 551 bp of the gene (amino acid positions 1 to 517) corresponding to the extracellular ligandbinding domain of Csf1ra. In this domain, there are in
total more non-synonymous substitutions than synonymous ones in the haplochromines (see amino acid alignment in Additional file 2), but not in the more basal
cichlid lineages that are without anal fin egg-dummies.
The maximum likelihood reconstructions of dN/dS ratios
in this domain of csf1ra revealed that the only internal
branch with a dN/dS >> 1 is the one representing the common ancestor of the haplochromines (dN/dS > 5; Figure
4e). Such a signal of adaptive sequence evolution specific
to the haplochromine lineage could not be detected in a
segment of the extracellular domain of kita, another type
III receptor tyrosine kinase with a known function in pigment patterning [31], which we have sequenced in the 19
cichlid species as a control. Also, in kita there was no indication that the segment of the extracellular domain would
have evolved under a different selection regime as compared to a segment in the intracellular domain (Additional file 3).
We also analyzed a genomic region of approximately 1
000 bp upstream of csf1ra in the 19 cichlid species, to
investigate sequence differences in putative gene regulatory regions. The only mutation common to all haplochromines, distinguishing them from the more ancestral
and less species-rich cichlid lineages, involves a mutation
in a putative transcription factor-binding site, a TATA box,
about 130 bp upstream of csf1ra.

Discussion
csf1ra is expressed in egg-dummies of haplochromine
cichlids
Egg-dummies on the male anal fins play an important role
during the breeding behavior of the female mouthbrooding haplochromines (see e.g., [7,13,14]). Phylogenetic
and character state reconstructions corroborate that these
egg-dummies evolved only once in the ancestral lineage of
haplochromines [7] (Figure 1a), and that the absence of
ovoid markings on the anal fins of some haplochromine
species is due to secondary loss, e.g. because of reasons of
camouflage or as an adaptation to the deep-water habitat
and visual environment where these markings would not
be easily visible.

Haplochromine egg-spots vary in size, shape, number and
arrangement in different species. Figure 3 provides some

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/51

examples of the diversity of egg-spots found in haplochromines. A typical egg-dummy consists of a conspicuous yellow to reddish central area and a more or less
transparent outer ring [11,12,14] (see Figure 3b, f),
although a number of species only show amorphic
blotches (see e.g., Figure 3j). The brightly colored inner
circle is, as we have shown (Figure 2), made up of xanthophores. Yellowish, orange, or reddish xanthophores also
occur in cichlid fins other than the anal fin (see e.g., Figure
3q–u) and in skin tissue, where substantial differences in
densities – depending on coloration patterns – can be
found (Clabaut, Salzburger and Meyer, unpublished
results). However, nowhere (not even in yellow colored
fish) could we identify a higher density of xanthophores
than in the egg-dummies of haplochromine males.
We applied a candidate gene approach in order to test
whether the previously isolated xanthophore-related
color gene csf1ra [25,26] is expressed in haplochromine
egg-spots. Our in situ hybridization experiments indeed
corroborate csf1ra expression in the egg-dummies of all
tested haplochromine species (Figure 3). We detected
csf1ra expression in the younger and still growing eggspots of A. burtoni (Figure 3a–d), in the single egg-dummy
of P. sp. 'bicolor' (Figure 3e–h), and in the relatively
unstructured male anal fin blotches of T. brauschi (Figure
3i–k), which is a member of an ancestral riverine haplochromine clade. The simple orange blotches of T. brauschi
(Figure 3j) again illustrate (see above) that not all types of
egg-dummies show a clear-cut separation into a brightly
colored inner circle and a more or less transparent outer
ring. In this specific case, it could, however, be argued that
because of the phylogenetic position of this species, the
undifferentiated spots of T. brauschi represent an intermediate character state in the evolution of egg-dummies.
That csf1ra is expressed in egg-spots of younger males and
the smaller and still developing egg-spots of adult males
might indicate that csf1ra is required for xanthophore
recruitment from pigment cell precursors during egg-spot
formation, just as has been reported for the formation of
stripes in zebrafish [25,26]. This would need to be tested
in future experiments.
In view of the fact that csf1ra is expressed in both patterns,
the comparative in situ hybridization experiments also
seem to support the earlier suggestion that egg-spots of
haplochromines are likely to be derived from the 'Perlfleckmuster' found in unpaired fins of haplochromines
and many other cichlid species [11,12]. Specifically, we
show that csf1ra is expressed in pearly spots on dorsal fins
of A. burtoni and P. multicolor (Figure 3q–u). As such
pearly spots are also found on anal fins of some (ancestral) haplochromine lineages (see Figure 3l for csf1ra
expression in the pearly spots on the posterior part of the
anal fin of T. brauschi), a co-option of at least some aspects

BMC Biology 2007, 5:51

of the molecular basis of the pearly blotch pattern for the
formation of egg-dummies appears likely.
Adaptive sequence evolution in the extracellular domain
of csf1ra in haplochromines
In order to investigate the molecular evolutionary history
of csf1ra we sequenced large fractions of the locus in 19
representative cichlid species (Figure 4a). The comparison
of haplochromine with non-haplochromine species
revealed that several regions in csf1ra show a dN/dS ratio
greater than one (Figure 4b), indicating that positive selection (adaptive sequence evolution) has acted to change
the protein in haplochromines. Positive Darwinian selection often only acts on particular domains of a gene,
whereas other sections remain subject to purifying selection. Also, adaptive evolution is expected to act only at
particular times during the evolution of a lineage. In our
case, we found that the regions showing a dN/dS > 1 are
located in the part of the gene that encodes the extracellular domain. The Csf1ra protein functions as membrane
spanning cell surface receptor [29,32], and is characterized by a cysteine-rich extracellular ligand-binding
domain composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains
containing growth factor binding sites, a transmembrane
domain, and two separate tyrosine kinase domains
[23,29] (Figure 4c). A maximum likelihood reconstruction of dN/dS ratios revealed that the extracellular domain
of csf1ra underwent adaptive evolution in the common
ancestor of the haplochromines (Figure 4e) – simultaneous to when the egg-dummies are likely to have evolved.
The occurrence of adaptive changes in the amino acid
sequence in the ligand-binding portion of csf1ra (Figure
4e, Additional file 2) seems to suggest that novel modifications of existing signal transduction mechanisms
evolved in the haplochromine lineage that were associated with the evolution of egg-spots, or, possibly, other
color patterns involving xanthophores. Functional assays
(see e.g., [33]) are now required to test whether the
observed differences in the coding sequence of csf1ra have
any effect on ligand-receptor interactions. Similarly, a
more thorough comparative analysis of the upstream
region of csf1ra is necessary to test the possibility that regulatory elements also underwent evolutionary changes in
the ancestor of haplochromines, as is suggested by the
observed haplochromine-specific mutation in a putative
transcription factor binding site and the differential
expression of csf1ra between haplochromine and nonhaplochromine cichlids. In addition, csf1ra expression
should also be investigated in other tissues and cell lineages. Although it is not apparent how e.g., macrophages or
osteoclasts (in which csf1ra is also expressed [25]) could
contribute to the evolutionary success of haplochromines
but not of other cichlids, the remote possibility remains
that the signal of adaptive sequence evolution is due to
functions other than coloration.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/51

To date, evidence for accelerated protein evolution in haplochromines has been found in the bone morphogenetic
protein 4 (bmp4) that is hypothesized to be involved in
jaw formation ([34]; see also [5,35]), in a color perception
gene, the long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin [36], and
in a putative color gene, the F-box-WD-repeat hagoromo
[37]. The finding of signatures of adaptive sequence evolution in a jaw-related gene, as well as in color and colorperception genes, seems to corroborate the hypothesis
that both the particular architecture of the cichlids' jaw
apparatus and the haplochromines' mating system are
important traits that have contributed to the evolutionary
success of cichlid fishes in general and of haplochromines
in particular [7,13,14,38]. The adaptive advantage of the
mating system of the haplochromines (with coloration
and egg-spots as sexual advertisement) might be the facilitation of sexual selection through female choice (see e.g.,
[7,16,21]). Sexual selection has been suggested as a major
cause for the explosive origin of new species of cichlids in
species flocks [3,13,39,40].
csf1ra is also expressed in egg-dummies of ectodine
cichlids
One of the most fascinating aspects of cichlid evolution is
the repeated occurrence of evolutionary parallelisms
[1,41-43]. This has led to the question of whether natural
selection alone is sufficient to produce parallel morphologies or whether a developmental or genetic bias has
influenced the direction of diversification [6]. Because of
their independent origin in at least two lineages of mouthbrooding cichlids (not counting the genital tassels of
some Tilapia species), egg-dummies on cichlid fins are
likely to represent another example of evolutionary parallelism in the adaptive radiations of cichlids in East Africa
– in this case involving a rather complex ethomorphological trait.

The function of egg-dummies in mimicking eggs to attract
females is known from haplochromines and also from
ectodines such as O. ventralis [14] (Figure 3v). Nevertheless, the dummies of O. ventralis (and its congeners) and
those of haplochromines are of independent evolutionary
origin, and they show different degrees of complexity.
Most importantly, the two kinds of egg-markings are
found on different anatomical structures, leading to substantial differences in the spawning behavior. In male
haplochromines, the often numerous egg-spots are situated on the anal fin and, hence, are in close proximity to
the genital opening to which the female's mouth is supposed to be guided (Figure 1). In O. ventralis (and its congeners) two blotches each are found on the tassels at the
tips of the paired pelvic fins, which are conspicuously
elongated (Figure 3v, w). Spawning in O. ventralis takes
place in huge sand bowers of a diameter of up to half a
meter in size, which are built by the territorial males in

order to attract females. An interested female lays a few
eggs in the center of the bower and picks them up into her
mouth, after which the male displays its ventral fins with
their yellow markings at the egg-laying spot. The female
takes up the tassels into her mouth. The tips of the pelvic
fins are put into close proximity to the male's genital
opening, which discharges sperm [14].

Methods

lid species were collected in East Africa in autumn 2004.
We included representative species of the main haplochromine lineages [7]: Astatotilapia burtoni (Lake Tanganyika and surrounding rivers), Astatoreochromis alluaudi
(lakes and rivers of the Lake Victoria region), Cyrtocara
moorii (Lake Malawi), Haplochromis bloyeti (East African
rivers), Haplochromis obliquidens (Lake Victoria), Pseudotropheus sp. 'bicolor' (Lake Malawi), Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor (East African lakes and rivers; Nile system),
Thoracochromis brauschi (Congo drainage), and Xystichromis phytophagus (Lake Kanyaboli; belongs to the Lake
Victoria region superflock) (Table 1). The non-haplochromine representatives were: Altolamprologus calvus,
Bathybates minor, Limnochromis auritus, Ophthalmotilapia
ventralis, Oreochromis tanganicae, Plecodus straeleni, Telmatochromis bifrenatus, Trematocara unimaculatum, and Xenotilapia spiloptera (all belong to the Lake Tanganyika species
assemblage), and Lamprologus teugelsi (Congo drainage)
(see [44] for taxonomic information, and [7,8,22], and
this study for phylogenetic assignments). The animals
were anesthetized with MS222 (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) prior to manipulations.

Cichlid fish
Cichlids for in situ hybridizations and molecular evolutionary analyses were reared in the Tierforschungsanlage
at the University of Konstanz, Germany under standard
conditions (12 h light/12 h dark; 26°C). Additional cich-

fins, we used a modified version of the method described
in [45]. Amputated anal, dorsal and ventral fins of haplo-

Here, we provide evidence that the same gene is expressed
in both kinds of egg-dummies. Just as in the haplochromine species examined, csf1ra is expressed in the yellow blotches on the tassels at the tips of the paired ventral
fins of males of O. ventralis, whereas females do not show
csf1ra expression (Figure 3y, z). This observation primarily
indicates that both kinds of egg dummies are made up of
xanthophores, for which csf1ra is a good marker gene. The
two kinds of independently evolved egg dummies might,
in the future, serve as model system to test whether the
same genetic pathways are involved in the morphogenesis
of a complex ethomorphological trait.

chromine cichlids were mounted in 5% methylcellulose
(500 μl) with dilute ammonia (25 μl), and β-mercaptoethanol, pH 10 (1 μl). Digital images were taken with a
Zeiss AxioCam Mrc digital camera using a Zeiss Axioplan2
stereomicroscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Reverse transcriptase mediated PCR
Prior to in situ hybridization experiments, we confirmed
expression of csf1ra in the haplochromine egg-spots by
means of a reverse transcriptase mediated PCR. We amplified and sequenced a 540-bp fragment of csf1ra from
cDNA that was transcribed from mRNA extracted from A.
burtoni egg-spot tissue, using the primers F_1986 5'-GCTGCCCTACAATGAAAAGTG-3' and R_2186 5'-TTGACGATGTTCTGGTGGTGA-3'.
In situ hybridization experiments
A 1 233-bp fragment of csf1ra was amplified by PCR from
A. burtoni cDNA using primers F_1986 5'-GCTGCCCTACAATGAAAAGTG-3' and R_3199 5'-AYTGRTAGTTRTTGGKCTTCA-3'. The amplified fragment was cloned into
the pCRII vector using the TA Cloning Dual Promoter Kit
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The orientation of
ligated inserts with respect to Sp6 and T7 promoters was
determined by direct sequencing on an ABI 3100 capillary
sequencer using the BigDye terminator reaction chemistry
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). For in situ
hybridization experiments, DIG-labeled (Roche) antisense RNA was transcribed from a linearized fragment
using DIG-labeled dNTPs.

Four rounds of in situ hybridization experiments were performed. In total, five male anal fins (plus two female anal
fins) were studied from P. sp. 'bicolor' and seven male
anal fins (plus one female and one dorsal fin) from A. burtoni. Furthermore, we used six anal fins (plus one dorsal
fin) from P. multicolor, three male anal fins from T.
brauschi, and three male plus two female ventral fins from
O. ventralis. Amputated fins were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer saline (PFA/PBS) at 4°C overnight, washed twice in PBTw (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, 0.01
DEPC), and stored in 100% methanol. Then, fins were
rehydrated (PBTw washed and post fixed in 4% PFA/PBS)
and treated with proteinase K (Roche) for 10 min at a final
concentration of 14 μg/ml (see [46]). After PBTw washing,
cichlid fins were prehybridized (50% formamide, 5 × SSC,
1 mg/ml tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, 0.1 % Tween-20, 9 mM
citric acid, pH 6.0) and hybridized at 69°C overnight in
hybridization buffer plus 1/10 volume of labeled probe.
Fins were gradually transferred to PBTw and blocking
solution (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany).
Anti-(DIG-AP) antibody (Roche) in 0.5% blocking solution and BCIP/X-phos (Roche) were used to visualize target RNA. The tissue was finally fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and
stored in 70% glycerol/PBS. As negative control, we

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/51

applied labeled sense RNA to male fins of A. burtoni and
P. sp. 'bicolor'. Photos of live fins and stained tissue were
taken with a Zeiss AxioCam Mrc digital camera using a
Zeiss Axioplan2 and Stemi SV11 APO stereomicroscopes.
Photos were processed with AxioVision 3.1 (Zeiss) and
Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe) software; the background of
images was modified with Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe, San
Jose, California, USA).
Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing: the
csf1ra locus
For PCR amplification of genomic DNA of 18 East African
cichlid species, we used the primers listed in Table 2 that
had been designed against a reference sequence from A.
burtoni (GenBank accession number: DQ386648; [24]).
We also resequenced the A. burtoni locus with these primers. Exon1 and the relatively large introns 1, 16, and 19
were not sequenced. The primers for amplification of the
upstream region of csf1ra were 26M7_3F 5'-CTCACCTCTGCGGATGTTTC-3' and 26M7_3R 5'-GCCACAGCATAAGGAAGGAC-3'. For the determination of the cDNA
sequence of csf1ra from a normalized library ("pinky")
made from different A. burtoni mRNA pools [47], we additionally used the primers listed in Table 3. For comparative analyses, we also determined, for the same set of
species, two segments of another type III receptor tyrosine
kinase, kita. This pigmentation gene plays an important
role in melanophore development [31]. It is therefore
another candidate for being an important color gene in
cichlid fishes. We determined a ca. 300 bp segment in the

standard conditions on ABI 9700 thermocyclers (Applied
Biosystems). PCR products were purified with Qiaquick
spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing
reactions were performed with forward and reverse primers (see above for details) using the BigDye terminator
reaction chemistry (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences
were detected on ABI 3100 automated capillary DNA
sequencers (Applied Biosystems).
Molecular evolutionary analyses: the csf1ra locus
DNA sequences were quality trimmed with Phred [48]
and assembled with Sequencher 3.0 [49]. Sequences have
been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers
(csf1ra)
and
EU042637–
EU042675–EU042749
EU042674 (kita) (note that the segment spanning exons
17 to 19 in csf1ra could not be amplified for T. unimaulatum). Exon/intron boundaries were identified using a reference sequence from A. burtoni (DQ386648) and
checked by homology comparison with reference
sequences from pufferfish (U63926), zebrafish
(AF240639) and trout (AJ417832). The protein structure
of Csf1ra and the functional domains were identified
from homologous sequence motifs in zebrafish (using the
Protein families database Pfam [50]) and pufferfish [23].
MatInspector from Genomatix [51] was used to identify
putative promoter modules in the upstream regions of
csf1ra.

Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses with 19 cichlid taxa were performed with
Paup * 4.0b10 [52]. The appropriate model parameters
for the maximum likelihood analysis were determined by
means of a likelihood ratio test with Modeltest version 3.6
[53]. For the maximum likelihood tree search based on
the non-coding section of the csf1ra locus (4 171 bp), we
used the general time reversible model of molecular evo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/51

lution (six types of substitutions) with a proportion of
invariable sites of 0.4714 and a gamma substitution correction (α = 0.8669). An unweighted heuristic maximum
parsimony search was performed with the same dataset
(50 replicates). Bootstrap analyses were performed with
100 replicates under the maximum likelihood criterion
and with 1 000 replicates for maximum parsimony analysis. Alternative branching orders at critical branches
within the haplochromines were evaluated by means of a
nonparametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa test under a resampling-estimated log likelihood with 1 000 bootstrap replicates as implemented in Paup*: The optimal maximum
likelihood topology with Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor as
sistergroup to Thoracochromis brauschi and all remaining
haplochromines was tested against trees in which T.
brauschi or Astatoreochromis alluaudi were forced to occupy
the most ancestral position within the haplochromines
(see also [7]).
Sliding window analyses for calculating the nucleotide
diversity (π) in the coding region of csf1ra in haplochromines versus non-haplochromines were performed
with DNASP 4.0 [30]. We used a window size of 50 bp
and an overlap of 10 bp. We also used DNASP for the calculation of the dN/dS ratio in haplochromines compared
to non-haplochromines using the same 50-bp windows
(overlap: 10 bp). We then used HyPhy [54] for the reconstruction of dN/dS ratios, based on maximum likelihood,
on the branches of the phylogeny obtained before (see
above), analyzing the entire dataset as well as the first 1
551 bp only, which correspond to the extracellular ligandbinding domain of csf1ra. We applied a site-to-site variation model with two independent gamma distributions
and the MG94 model, and tested for relevant internal
branches in the tree. The reconstructed dN/dS ratios were
visualized in form of a branch-scaled tree applying the
Suzuki-Gojobori derived adaptive selection tool implemented in HyPhy. We also used DNASP for sliding window analyses in kita and HyPhy to plot dN/dS ratios for
the two segments of kita on the maximum likelihood tree.
Character state reconstructions
The characteristic egg-dummies of the haplochromines
have been identified as a potential key evolutionary innovation that might be directly related to the evolutionary
success of this most species-rich group of cichlid fishes [7]
(but see [55]). As some ancestral (but also some derived)
species of haplochromines do not show egg-dummies on
male anal fins, we intended to reconstruct the evolutionary origin of these markings based on the new phylogenetic and comparative morphological data now available.
Specifically, we wanted to evaluate the hypothesis that
these characteristic egg-spots evolved only once in the
ancestor of the haplochromines and that the missing
ovoid markings on anal fins of males of some species are

due to secondary loss. We used Mesquite 1.03 [56] for
maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony ancestral
state reconstructions of the evolutionary origin of eggdummies on male anal fins, on the basis of a consensus
phylogeny of East African cichlid fishes. We also mapped
the evolutionary origin of the characteristic polygynous
mating system with maternal mouthbrooding involving
egg-spots on that phylogeny. The consensus tree was built
using a previous mitochondrial phylogeny [7] as well as
the present phylogenetic hypothesis that is based on
nuclear DNA. Note that the ancestral polytomy between
the Pseudocrenilabrus, the Astatoreochromis, the Congolese/
South African lineage, and the modern haplochromines
[7] remained unresolved in all available phylogenetic
hypotheses.
