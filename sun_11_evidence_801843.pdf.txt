Evidence for acquisition of virulence effectors
in pathogenic chytrids
Guiling Sun†, Zefeng Yang†, Tiffany Kosch, Kyle Summers and Jinling Huang*

Abstract
Background: The decline in amphibian populations across the world is frequently linked to the infection of the
chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). This is particularly perplexing because Bd was only recently
discovered in 1999 and no chytrid fungus had previously been identified as a vertebrate pathogen.
Results: In this study, we show that two large families of known virulence effector genes, crinkler (CRN) proteins
and serine peptidases, were acquired by Bd from oomycete pathogens and bacteria, respectively. These two
families have been duplicated after their acquisition by Bd. Additional selection analyses indicate that both families
evolved under strong positive selection, suggesting that they are involved in the adaptation of Bd to its hosts.
Conclusions: We propose that the acquisition of virulence effectors, in combination with habitat disruption and
climate change, may have driven the Bd epidemics and the decline in amphibian populations. This finding
provides a starting point for biochemical investigations of chytridiomycosis.

Background
A recent report by IUCN indicates that amphibians are
the most endangered group of vertebrates worldwide,
with 32 percent listed as threatened with extinction and
159 species already believed to be extinct [1]. Among
the several factors often linked to the decline in amphibian populations is the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis (Bd), the causative agent of chytridiomycosis. Ever since the discovery of Bd in 1999 [2], numerous cases have been reported for the destruction
associated with chytridiomycosis [3,4]. The destructive
path of chytridiomycosis fits all of the descriptors of a
novel epidemic (i.e. sudden appearance, strong virulence,
and rapid transmission) [5]. Investigations of museum
specimens collected from as far back as 1902 in Japan
[6] and 1938 in Africa [7] have detected Bd in skin
cross sections. On the other hand, long-term population
studies since the 1900’s had no records of mass mortalities until the late 1970’s when the first Bd epidemics
were reported [8]. This leads to an interesting question
about how pathogenesis suddenly evolved in this previously benign organism.

Many disease organisms existed in non-virulent/commensal forms until they acquired some novel traits
allowing them to exploit new niches [9]. Among the
several possible underlying mechanisms, horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) is the most rapid way for an organism
to gain novel phenotypes [10] and it has contributed to
the origin and spread of pathogenesis in numerous bacteria [9,11] and occasionally in eukaryotes [12,13]. In
this study, we show that homologs of two large families
of known virulence effector genes were likely acquired
by Bd. These families have been rapidly duplicated after
their acquisition in Bd and evolved under strong positive
selection. We hypothesize that the acquisition of these
virulence effector homologs may partly explain the evolution of chytridiomycosis.

Results and Discussion
Phylogenomic analyses identified homologs of two large
families of known virulence effectors in Bd, including
serine peptidases and CRN proteins (Table 1; Additional
file 1). Of these, members of the serine peptidase family
have been implicated as virulence effectors in Bd
because of their potential role in degrading host antimicrobial peptides [14]. Previous microarray data also indicated that many serine peptidase genes in Bd are highly
expressed in the sporangia stage, which is associated

with the infection of keratinized host tissue [14]. Our
analyses show that at least 32 serine peptidase genes are
present in the Bd genome (Additional file 1). Other
identifiable homologs of Bd serine peptidases are only
found in bacteria, where they are more broadly
distributed.
The CRN protein family consists of cytoplasmic virulence effectors only known in oomycete plant pathogens
[15,16]. These effectors are referred to as “crinkler” proteins because of their association with cell death and leaf
crinkling, which parallels the effects of Bd on amphibian
skin [17]. In oomycete pathogens, the N-terminal region
of CRN proteins contains a highly conserved LFLAK

domain that is characteristic of all CRN proteins. The Cterminal region is diverse in domain and motif structure,
based on which 24 subfamilies were identified in the
oomycete Phytophthora infestans [16]. The C-terminal
region of CRN proteins also controls virulence and, when
expressed in plant cells, may induce cell death [16]. Our
analyses identified 84 genes encoding CRN protein
homologs in Bd (Table 1). These genes are present in
genomes of both Bd isolates (JAM81 and JEL423) and
include eight of the 24 subfamilies of CRN proteins
known in oomycetes (Table 2).
Compared to oomycetes, the number of genes in each
subfamily is often higher in Bd. In particular, the DXX-

Homologs are present in green plants. All other subfamilies are solely
restricted in Bd and oomycetes.

DHA subfamily of CRN proteins is highly duplicated in
Bd and contains 30 and 44 gene copies from the two
respective genomes, many of which show very little
sequence variation. The homology of CRN proteins from
Bd and oomycetes is most obvious in the C-terminal
effector region, with a sequence identity of up to 46.5%.
The N-terminal LFLAK domain characteristic of oomycete CRN proteins also is largely conserved in some identified CRN homologs in Bd (Additional file 2). As in
oomycete pathogens [16,18], only a fraction of CRN
homologs identified in Bd are predicted to contain signal
peptides (Table 1). However, almost all other identified
CRN homologs in Bd have short N-terminal extensions
of about 20 amino acids in positions corresponding to
signal peptides (Table 1 and Additional file 2).
The observation that a gene is uniquely shared by distantly related organisms can be attributed to multiple
possible scenarios, in particular differential loss and
HGT [19,20]. Although differential loss and HGT can
always be invoked as alternative explanations to each
other, each scenario becomes increasingly less likely if it
requires considerably more corresponding (gene loss or
HGT) events [19,21]. In the cases of serine peptidases
and CRN proteins, because chytrids and oomycetes
belong to opisthokonts and heterokonts respectively, the
gene loss scenario entails numerous independent loss
events in related taxa. A more parsimonious and plausible scenario is the occurrence of HGT between Bd and
oomycetes. To further investigate the number and the
direction of potential HGT events involved, we performed phylogenetic analyses on serine peptidases and
each of the eight CRN subfamilies shared between Bd
and oomycetes. Our analyses indicate that all serine
peptidase homologs in Bd form a weakly supported
clade (Figure 1A). Given that serine peptidases are more
widely distributed in bacteria, it is most likely that serine

peptidases in Bd are derived from a single HGT event
from bacteria, followed by gene duplication. Analyses of
CRN subfamilies show that, in most cases, sequences
from Bd form a distinct clade whereas those from
oomycetes form another, suggesting independent HGT
for each CRN subfamily. With paralogous sequence
clades as outgroup, our analyses of the DN17 subfamily
also show that Bd sequences were likely acquired from
oomycetes, though the support is still modest (Figure
1B). Such low support is expected given the short length
of sequences used in our phylogenetic analyses. Additional evidence consistent with the direction of HGT
from oomycetes comes from their higher CRN gene
diversity. The fewer CRN subfamilies in Bd (8 versus 24
in oomycetes) are in line with the transfer from oomycetes, as we would expect the recipient organism to
receive a subset of the gene repertoire of the donor.
Nevertheless, for both serine peptidases and the CRN
family, we were unable to determine the timing of these
HGT events because of the paucity of sequence data
from other chytrids and oomycetes.
Because both the serine peptidase and CRN families
are highly duplicated in Bd, we reasoned that they may
confer important functions and, therefore, investigated
the possibility that strong selection has been involved in
their evolution. The estimate of d N /d S for the serine
peptidase family in Bd is 0.46, while this value is 0.01 in
bacteria. Similarly, dN/dS for each of seven CRN subfamilies (with more than three sequences) is significantly
higher in Bd than in oomycetes (Table 3). These results
indicate that both the serine peptidase and CRN families
evolved faster in Bd than in oomycetes and bacteria. We
further used three likelihood tests (M2a vs. M1a, M8 vs.
M7 and M8 vs. M8a) [22] to identify the role of positive
selection on the serine peptidase family and seven CRN
subfamilies in Bd and in oomycetes or bacteria, respectively. A priori we stipulated that evidence for positive
selection will be sufficient only if all three tests performed show statistical significance. In total, all eight
families and subfamilies in Bd show strong evidence of
positive selection (Table 3; Additional file 3). In contrast, we found that only four subfamilies of CRN proteins (DX8, DXX-DXV, DXX-DHA, and DN17) evolved
under positive selection in oomycetes. For the subfamilies that were influenced by positive selection in both
Bd and oomycetes, the improved branch-site model [23]
was used to identify positive selection specifically on the
diverging Bd lineages. The genes in Bd were used as
foreground branches and those in oomycetes were used
as background. Except for the subfamily DXX-DHA,
likelihood tests for the other three CRN subfamilies
show statistically significant support for positive selection in the Bd branch (Additional file 3). Furthermore,
multiple positively selected amino acid sites were

identified using the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) estimation procedure [24], suggesting that positive selection
acted specifically on certain amino acid sites of the serine peptidase family and the CRN subfamilies after their
acquisition by Bd.
Most genes of the serine peptidase family in Bd were
assigned to two clades in the phylogeny with strong
bootstrap support (Figure 1A). We estimated the coefficients of both type I (a site-specific shift in evolutionary
rate) [25] and type II functional divergence (a clusterspecific shift of amino acid property) [26] between
them. The results showed that only the type I coefficient
of functional divergence is significantly greater than zero
(θ I = 0.5744 ± 0.0589, LRT = 220.3270, p < 0.01). These
results suggest that site-specific selective constraints
have been altered for most of the members of this
family, leading to group-specific functional evolution
after their diversification. Furthermore, 26 amino acid
residues were found to be critical for type I functional
divergence with a posterior probability higher than 0.95
(Additional file 3), indicating that the evolutionary rates
for these sites have shifted between these two clades.
Some amino acid residues in the region of the Peptidase_S41 domain may also have contributed to the

functional divergence, as there are 11 critical residues
that are located in this region.
The acquisition of the serine peptidase and CRN
families followed by rapid duplication and positive selection suggests that these acquired genes are likely important in the adaptation of Bd. Because both families are
known virulence effectors, their presence in Bd provides
a starting point for biochemical investigations of chytrid
pathogenesis. If members of these two families are
indeed related to Bd virulence, their acquisition may at
least partly explain the emergence of chytridiomycosis.
Peptidases are ubiquitous tools of bacterial parasites that
enable host infection, and have also been identified as
key factors in fungal pathogenesis. For example, Microsporum canis, a dermatophytic fungal parasite, infects
keratinized tissue (e.g. skin and nails) in mammals. This
fungus secretes dipeptidyl peptidases, which are homologous to serine peptidases of the S9 family in bacteria
[27]. These and other proteases enable the fungus to
obtain nutrients from the complex network of insoluble
proteins that comprise keratin-rich tissues. As mentioned above, serine peptidases were identified as a class
of proteins that are associated with virulence in Bd
using microarray expression analyses [14]. The CRN

hypothesize that the acquisition of virulence effectors, in
combination with habitat disruption and climate change,

populations. Further investigations are warranted to

genes were previously only known in oomycetes, which
themselves also are important pathogens. Although
most attention has been paid to oomycete plant pathogens, there is also a diverse group of oomycetes that
infect animals [28]. Some of these pathogens are responsible for epidemics in aquatic animals such as crayfish
[28]. The oomycete parasite Saproglenia may induce
high mortality in salmon populations, both in aquaculture and in the wild [29], with effects similar to Bd [30].
Hence, the oomycete lineage is well adapted to parasitize vertebrate hosts. It is not surprising that oomycetes
have an arsenal of genes associated with parasitism and
that the acquisition of such genes may help convert a
commensal chytrid to a parasitic pathogen.

Conclusions
Our data show that two large families of known virulence effector genes, CRN proteins and serine peptidases, were likely transferred to Bd from oomycete
pathogens and bacteria, respectively. These acquired
virulence effector homologs have been under rapid gene
duplication and strong positive selection, suggesting that
they may play an important role in the adaptation of
Bd. Given that pathogenesis is the outcome of microbehost interactions, the impact of any virulence effector is
likely more severe when the host becomes stressed. We

Methods
Data source and genome screening for HGT candidates

Phylogenomic analyses used a customized database
combining sequences from the NCBI non-redundant
(nr) database, dbEST, the Taxonomically Broad EST
Database (TBestDB) [31] and additional eukaryotic genomes. Annotated protein sequences of the heterokont
Aureococcus anophagefferens, haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi, green algae Chlorella sp. and C. vulgaris, metazoans
Daphnia pulex, Capitella sp. and Lottia gigantea were
obtained from the Joint Genome Institute http://www.
jgi.doe.gov. The annotated genome of the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae was downloaded from the Cyanidioschyzon merolae Genome Project http://merolae.biol.
s.u-tokyo.ac.jp, and those of fungi Rhizopus oryzae, Allomyces macrogynus, and Spizellomyces punctatus were
obtained from their sequencing projects at the Broad
Institute of Harvard and MIT http://www.broadinstitute.
org. Detailed sources for annotated protein sequences
and ESTs of two Bd isolates and seven oomycetes used
in our analyses are shown in Additional file 4. A comprehensive database was created using above data.
Genome screening for horizontally acquired genes was
performed using AlienG [32]. AlienG is based on the
observation that sequence similarity is correlated to
sequence relatedness, where sequence similarity is measured by BLAST bit scores. A query sequence is considered to be a candidate of HGT-derived gene if it is
significantly more similar to homologs from a potential
donor (Sd) than to those from closely related taxa (Sr).
Specifically, a bit score ratio S d /S r = 1.5 was used as
threshold to identify candidates of HGT-derived genes
in Bd. To eliminate potential artifacts, only candidates
with expression evidence from ESTs or located in contigs containing more than 5 genes are retained for
further analyses.
Identification of serine peptidase and CRN protein
families in Bd and oomycetes

Phylogenomic analyses identified homologs of serine
peptidases and CRN proteins among the HGT candidates. To retrieve other CRN and serine peptidase
homologs in Bd, we first downloaded bacterial serine
peptidases and annotated oomycete CRNs from both
GenBank and oomycete genome projects [16,18]; these
downloaded sequences were then used as queries to
search (BLASTP) against Bd JAM81 annotated protein

Sun et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:195
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/195

sequences. All hits with E-values lower than 1 × 10 -5
were retained. To classify the retrieved CRN homologs
in Bd, we followed the criteria used for the oomycete P.
infestans [16], which is based on the structures of Cterminal specific domains. As a result, eight subfamilies
of CRN homologs were identified in Bd. To further estimate the copy numbers for homologs of serine peptidases and each CRN subfamily in Bd, we first
constructed profiles for the Bd serine peptidase domain
and the C-terminal specific domain regions of each
CRN subfamily using HMMER [33]. The generated profiles were used to search the Bd genome, and sequences
with E-values lower than 1 × 10 -5 were retrieved and
further aligned using conserved domain regions as references. Extremely divergent or partial sequences were
removed from further analyses. The remaining genes
were considered to be putative serine peptidases or
CRN proteins. To exclude the possibility of contamination in Bd JAM81, the same process was also used to
identify genes in the isolate Bd JEL423. Because the
CRN protein family from four oomycetes (P. infestans,
P. sojae, P. ramorum, and Pythium ultimum) have been
well annotated [16,18], we also used their C-terminal
specific domain regions as references to identify CRN
proteins in other oomycete datasets, including the P.
capsici genome and ESTs for three other oomycetes (P.
brassicae, P. parasitica, and Aphanomyces euteiches).
Partial sequences were excluded and the remaining
genes were regarded as CRN proteins. Secretion signals
of serine peptidases and CRN proteins were identified
using three tools (SignalP [34], TargetP [35], and
iPSORT [36]) with default settings. The conserved Nterminal profiles were generated using WebLogo http://
weblogo.berkeley.edu.
Phylogenetic analyses

Protein sequence alignment was carried out using MUSCLE [37] and clustalX [38], followed by visual inspection
and manual refinement. Gaps and ambiguously aligned
sites were removed manually. The most appropriate
protein substitution matrix, rate heterogeneity and
invariant sites were determined using ModelGenerator
[39] for serine peptidases and each of the eight CRN
subfamilies identified in Bd. Phylogenetic analyses were
performed with a maximum likelihood method using
PHYML [40] and a distance method using neighbor of
PHYLIPNEW v.3.68 [41] in EMBOSS package [42].
Bootstrap support values were estimated using 100
pseudo-replicates. For distance analyses, maximum likelihood distances were calculated using TREE-PUZZLE
v.5.2 [43] and PUZZLEBOOT v.1.03 (A. Roger and M.
Holder, http://www.tree-puzzle.de. The models used in
TREE-PUZZLE/BUZZLEBOOT to calculate the maximum likelihood distances were the same as those

determined by ModelGenerator. All other parameters in
the analyses used default settings.
Detection of positive selection

The d N /d S values for the serine peptidase family and
seven CRN subfamilies (with more than three members
in Bd) were estimated both in Bd and in oomycetes or
bacteria, respectively. Genes with partial sequences were
removed from the analyses. The program PAL2NAL
[44] was used to convert protein sequence alignments
into the corresponding codon-based DNA alignments.
The program CODEML [22] was then used to calculate
the dN/dS values.
Maximum likelihood analyses of selective constraints
on the serine peptidase family and seven CRN subfamilies were performed using PAML [22] with their phylogenies and the codon alignments as input. For the
serine peptidase family and each CRN subfamily, we
firstly used the site-specific models [22,45,46] to identify
positively selected codon sites in Bd and in oomycetes
or bacteria, respectively. In this analysis, we compared
models M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs. M8 to
identify positive selection. To assess whether positive
selection acted on the evolution of each group, the log
likelihood values for each pair of nested models were
compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT). In the
LRT, twice the log likelihood difference (2Δ/) between
the two models was compared with the c 2 statistics,
with degrees of freedom (DF) equal to the difference of
the number of parameters. The DFs were 3, 2, and 1 for
comparisons M1a vs. M2a, M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs. M8,
respectively. If the LRT was statistically significant and
d N /d S estimate greater than 1, evidence for positive
selection would be considered sufficient for the genes
analyzed. Then, the Bayes Empirical Bayes method [24]
was used to determine the amino acids most likely
responsible for positive selection.
The improved branch-site models [23] were also used
to search for positive selection for the serine peptidase
family and each CRN subfamily. In these tests, we compared the null model A (model = 2, NSsites = 2, with ω
fixed to 1) with the alternative model (model = 2,
NSsites = 2). For each family or subfamily, the Bd
branch on the phylogeny was used as foreground, while
the oomycetes or bacteria branch used as background.
When the LRT suggests positive selection under this
model, the codon sites likely evolved under positive
selection can be identified through posterior probability
from Bayes Empirical Bays method [24].
Analysis of functional divergence

The program DIVERGE [47] was used to estimate the
coefficients of both type I (θ I) and type II (θ II) functional divergence between serine peptidase clades A and

Sun et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:195

B. Because subfamilies with fewer than four sequences
cannot be analyzed using this method, three other serine
peptidase proteins were excluded from this analysis. A
likelihood ratio test was performed to test the null
hypothesis θ = 0 using c 2 distribution with 1 DF. A significant θ I indicates that site-specific altered selection
constraints after the divergence of clades, while a significant θ II means site-specific shift of amino acid physiochemical property [25,26].
