Abstract
Background: Singapore has been certified malaria free since November 1982 by the World Health Organization
and despite occasional local transmission, the country has maintained the standing. In 2009, three clusters of
malaria cases were reported in Singapore.
Methods: Epidemiological, entomological and molecular studies were carried out to investigate the three clusters,
namely Mandai-Sungei Kadut, Jurong Island and Sembawang.
Results: A total of 29 malaria patients, with no recent travel history, were reported in the three clusters. Molecular
analysis based on the msp3a and msp1 genes showed two independent local transmissions: one in Mandai-Sungei
Kadut and another in Sembawang. Almost all cases within each cluster were epidemiologically linked. In Jurong
Island cluster, epidemiological link remains uncertain, as almost all cases had a unique genetic profile. Only two cases
shared a common profile and were found to be linked to the Mandai-Sungei Kadut cluster. Entomological
investigation found Anopheles sinensis to be the predominant Anopheline in the two areas where local transmission
of P. vivax was confirmed. Anopheles sinensis was found to be attracted to human bait and bites as early as 19:45 hrs.
However, all Anopheles mosquitoes caught were negative for sporozoites and oocysts by dissection.
Conclusion: Investigation of P. vivax cases from the three cluster areas confirmed the occurrence of local
transmission in two areas. Although An. sinensis was the predominant Anopheline found in areas with confirmed
transmission, the vector/s responsible for the outbreaks still remains cryptic.

Background
Singapore has been certified malaria free since November
1982 by the World Health Organization [1] and despite
occasional local transmission, the country has maintained
the standing due to its comprehensive system that prevents the re-establishment of malaria viz. vector surveillance and control, early case detection, and aggressive
preventive and remedial actions upon detection of cases
[2,3]. The incidence of reported malaria declined substantially from 8.0 per 100,000 population in 1977 to 2.0
per 100,000 population in 2007. In recent years, incidence has been maintained at between 2.0 and 2.6 per
100,000 population. Most infections were caused by

Plasmodium vivax (66-78%), and Plasmodium falciparum
(19-31%) [3]. Some 91-98% of all reported cases were
imported, with 90% of them originating from neighbouring endemic countries in Southeast Asia and from the
Indian subcontinent. These imported cases included foreign workers on employment pass, local residents who
contracted the disease abroad, foreigners seeking medical
treatment in Singapore, and foreign tourists [3].
Singapore’s vulnerability to malaria is accentuated by
its status as a trade and travel hub, high dependency on
foreign workers from neighboring endemic countries,
and increased regional travel to and from malarious
areas. It has been reported that 60% of vivax malaria
cases occur in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific,
and that India contributes substantially to this regional
disease burden [4]. The presence of pockets of Anopheles
vectors further render Singapore receptive to malaria.

Through studies conducted in the 1960s, malaria vectors
of Singapore were established as Anopheles epiroticus
(sundaicus) and Anopheles maculatus [5]. Anopheles letifer has also been suspected to be a vector [6].
To reduce the threat of outbreaks, the National Environment Agency has identified specific malaria receptive
areas for regular Anopheles surveillance and control [2].
Between 1983 and 2007, a total of 29 outbreaks involving 196 local cases were reported. These outbreaks had
median size of three cases. Half (14) of these outbreaks
were identified on the main island, while the rest
occurred on off-shore islands. Either An. sundaicus or
An. maculatus were found in 13 outbreaks, while no
vectors could be determined in the others [3]. In 2006,
13 vivax malaria cases involving foreign workers from
endemic countries were reported at the Jurong island
[7]. Larvae surveillance and adult trapping did not yield
any Anopheles mosquitoes.
For vivax malaria, difficulties exist in differentiating
relapsed cases from local transmission. In May-Aug
2009, 29 cases of vivax malaria were again detected at
three different cluster locations in Singapore. This
report highlights the use of entomologic and molecular
techniques to assist in epidemiologic investigations.

Methods
Human blood samples and molecular confirmation of
diagnosis

Between May and July 2009, a total of 29 vivax malaria
cases were identified as working/living in three separate
cluster locations in Singapore with no overseas travel
history of note. They comprised 16 cases at MandaiSungei Kadut (1°24’23.15"N, 103°45’28.88"E), 9 cases at
Jurong Island (1°15’42.49"N, 103°40’37.68"E), and 4 cases
at Sembawang (1°27’10.42"N, 103°49’58.13"E) (Figure 1).
A total of 20 residual blood samples from the three cluster locations (7 from Jurong Island, 10 from Mandai-Sungei Kadut, and 3 from Sembawang) were obtained from
various hospitals for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
As part of the national public health programme, DNA
was extracted from whole blood using QIAamp DNA
blood kit (QIAGEN, USA), following the manufacturer’s
recommendations, and subjected to molecular analysis.
Nested PCR assay for detection of malaria parasites was
carried out as previously described [8,9]. In addition to
testing the four human malaria parasite species, the samples were also tested for Plasmodium knowlesi.
Molecular analysis of malarial parasites
Restriction fragment length polymorphism of msp3a of
P. vivax

The polymorphic region of msp3a gene of P. vivax was
amplified by PCR as previously described [10]. PCR
amplification for each sample was carried out in 50 μl

Page 2 of 11

reaction mixture containing 1× reaction buffer, 2 mM
MgCl2, 200 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate,
0.25 μM each of primers, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, USA) and 5 μl of extracted genomic
DNA was used for each reaction. PCR cycling were carried out using the Veriti™ thermal cycler (Applied Biosystem, CA, USA) using the following parameters: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 10 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 1
min, 56°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min 30s, followed
by a final extension step of 68°C for 10 min. Five μl of
PCR product of msp3a gene was digested individually
with restriction enzyme AluI and HhaI (Promega, USA)
in 20 μl reactions and incubated at 37°C for 4 hr. The
digested DNA fragments were then analysed by agarose
gel electrophoresis.
Cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of msp1
gene of the parasite

The msp1 gene of P. vivax was PCR amplified as
described previously [11]. The PCR amplified msp1 gene
fragment was cloned into TOPO Zero Blunt vector (Invitrogen, USA). Ten to thirty clones were sequenced with
M13 primers. Each of the msp1 gene sequence obtained
was compared with those from the Genbank database
using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX [12] and phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA4 programme
[13]. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method based on Kimura 2-parameter distance matrix including transitions and transversions.
Reliability of the phylogenetic tree was accessed using the
bootstrap methods with 1000 replicates.
Adult mosquito collection

Larval surveillance was performed by the public health
officers from the National Environment Agency’s regional
offices. Adult mosquito collections, by the same field officers and laboratory based officers from the Environmental
Health Institute (EHI), were performed from 7 pm to 1
am. Collections were done using bare-leg catch method
[14] and the human baited net trap [15]. All mosquitoes
were brought into the EHI laboratory for identification
and examination. Entomological investigation at MandaiSungei Kadut was performed from 30 May to 26 August,
which was initiated about two weeks after the onset date
of the first case and ended four weeks after the final
reported case. At Jurong island, the surveillance was performed from 26 May to 2 September, while onset of
reported cases were from 3 May to 26 July. The surveillance at Sembawang was from 29 July to 1 September, in
response to cases with onset dates from 12 June to 12 July.
Mosquito identification and examination
Morphological identification

Taxonomic keys of Harrison and Scanlon; Reid [16,17]
were used for the morphological identification.

constructed using the method described for molecular
analysis of malarial parasite.

Molecular identification - sequencing of internal transcribed
spacer 2 (ITS2) region

Results

All mosquitoes that could not be identified accurately,
due to missing pertinent taxonomic features were subjected to molecular and phylogenetic analysis. DNA was
extracted from the legs of the Anopheles mosquitoes
using the DNeasy tissue Kit (Qiagen USA) following the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The rDNA ITS2 was
amplified using a previously described protocol [18].
PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products were
purified using Purelink™ PCR Purification kit (Invitrogen, USA). Sequencing was done by a commercial
laboratory according to the BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) protocol.
Consensus sequence from each mosquito was
obtained by assembling a contiguous sequence from raw
sequencing data using Seqman software (Lasergene,
DNASTAR, USA). Sequences obtained from each mosquito were aligned with ClustalW using Megalign software (Lasergene, DNASTAR, USA). The ITS2 gene
sequences obtained from this study were phylogenetically compared to other members of the Anopheles hyrcanus group in GenBank. The phylogenetic trees were

Using nested PCR assay, P. vivax was confirmed to be the
only malaria parasite present in all 20 samples sent to EHI
for further analysis. The Mandai-Sungei Kadut cluster
comprised 14 foreign workers and two local residents who
developed onset of symptoms between 16 May and 1 July
2009. Mandai and Sungei Kadut are two adjacent industrial estates located in the northern part of Singapore adjacent to a tropical rainforest. At the time of the outbreak,
there were ongoing earthworks for the construction of a
subway line. The foreign workers were from four different
countries viz. India, Thailand, Bangladesh and Malaysia.
The Jurong Island cluster comprised nine foreign
workers who developed onset of symptoms between 3
May and 26 July 2009. Jurong Island, located southwest
of the mainland, is a 32 km2 island that houses major
petrochemical industries. The cases, all men aged 24-46
years, were from India and Bangladesh but none of
them could furnish a history of past malaria infection.
Epidemiologic investigations traced an earlier imported
case (designated as J4), who was ill on 4 April 2009 and
had previous malaria in India in Jun 2008 to be the
likely source of infection for the local cases.

The Sembawang cluster comprised three local residents and one foreign worker (an Indian national) who
developed onset of symptoms between 12 June and 12
July 2009. Sembawang is a semi-rural location in the
north of Singapore that is lined by shophouses and
grass nurseries adjacent to a tropical rainforest.
Molecular epidemiology - analysis of P. vivax msp3a and
msp1 genes

The PCR-RFLP analysis of the msp3a gene demonstrated that P. vivax parasites in samples from Jurong
Island, Mandai-Sungei Kadut and Sembawang were

Page 4 of 11

highly diverse. Ten unique patterns of the PCR-RFLP
profile were observed among the 20 samples analyzed
(Figure 2). Moreover, the sum of RFLP fragments size
derived for most Mandai-Sungei Kadut cases (M9, M11,
M108, M84, M71, M99, M82 and M80) and a Jurong
Island case (J68) was greater than the size of corresponding undigested PCR product, indicating the presence of multiple haplotypes of msp3a in each of these
samples. Each of the plausible haplotypes was visually
elucidated from the RFLP pattern and assigned an
alphabet: A-J and the possible msp3a haplotypes for
each case were scored in Table 1.

Each alphabet for msp3a RFLP pattern represents a unique genotype based on analysis of fragment size.

The analysis of the gene encoding the C-terminal 42
kDa fragment (1,230 bp) of P. vivax msp1 in 17 cases
from Jurong Island (n = 4), Mandai-Sungei Kadut (n =
10) and Sembawang (n = 3) further confirmed the
results derived from the RFLP of msp3a gene. An average of 7 clones were sequenced from each case (Additional file 1). Based on the msp1 gene sequences, all
except 4 samples had multiple genotypes (2-5 genotypes
per individual) of P. vivax. As expected, cloning and
sequencing of the msp1 gene provide a higher resolution
analysis as multiple msp1 haplotypes were also identified
in samples detected as having single P. vivax genotype
by RFLP method (Table 1). Sequence alignment revealed
30 haplotypes of msp1 gene, characterized by specific
point mutations (Figure 3). Additional file 1 provides
details on the haplotype of each clone sequenced.
Mandai-Sungei Kadut cluster

Analysis of 10 samples taken from Mandai-Sungei Kadut
showed that eight samples, including two local Singaporean cases (M11 and M99) had an identical PCRRFLP pattern, which was generated by at least 2 haplotypes (C and D) (Table 1). For the other two samples,
M93 pattern appeared to comprise C only, while M5
was completely different (as revealed by the HhaI
digest). The suspected index case, M5, was thus molecularly found to be unrelated to the cluster. The msp3a
PCR-RFLP finding was supported by msp1 sequencing,

which revealed that all Mandai-Sungei Kadut cases,
except M5 shared haplotypes 1 and/or 2 (Table 1). This
molecular data strongly supports the epidemiological
finding of local transmission of P. vivax malaria at Mandai-Sungei Kadut, and suggested that M5 was not the
index case of the outbreak and was not linked to the
outbreak.
Jurong Island cluster

Analysis of seven samples from Jurong Island revealed
seven unique PCR-RFLP patterns (Figure 2). Analysis of
the msp1 sequences of six cases also revealed distinct
haplotypes among the cases (Table 1). Interestingly, two
cases (J10 and J68) had the C and CD RFLP pattern of
msp3a, that were characteristic of Mandai-Sungei Kadut
cases. The possible link between these two cases with
the Mandai-Sungei Kadut outbreak was again substantiated by the msp1 sequences, where haplotypes 1 and 2
were found in the two cases (J10 and J68) (Table 1).
Sembawang cluster

Analysis of samples from Sembawang revealed two unique
RFLP patterns (msp3a) that were distinct from those
sampled in Jurong Island and Mandai-Sungei Kadut. Two
samples (S68 and S69), which belonged to local Singaporeans had identical RFLP pattern, while the foreigner (S66)
had a different haplotype. Based on this analysis, it is
highly possible that local transmission of P. vivax was

taking place in Sembawang but none of the cases were
associated with the malaria clusters in Jurong Island and
Mandai-Sungei Kadut. Case S66, though living in the area,
was not linked to the cluster in Sembawang. The results
from msp1 sequence analysis were consistent with that of
msp3a RFLP. Haplotype 10 was shared between the two
local residents (S68 and S69), while S66 had no common
haplotype with any of the two.
Phylogenetic analysis of parasite genes

Phylogenetic analysis based on the msp1 gene showed
that P. vivax parasites from these three malaria clusters
can be subdivided into three distinct clades, each with a
strong bootstrap support (Figure 4). Two most common
haplotypes (haplotypes 1 and 2) that were shared among
samples from Mandai-Sungei Kadut and two of Jurong
Island cases fell into two separate clades (I and III). Haplotype 1 (clade I) was most closely related to P. vivax
from Indonesia, whereas the closest relatives of haplotype
2 (clade III) were those previously reported in Thailand.
For samples from Jurong Island, most haplotypes
branched out independently and clustered with P. vivax
strains from various countries such as India, Brazil and

Thailand. This further supports the diversity of lineages
among the samples from Jurong Island. Although multiple haplotypes of msp1 of P. vivax were found in samples
from Sembawang, they were notably distinct from those
found in Jurong Island and Mandai-Sungei Kadut. The
Sembawang P. vivax msp1 haplotypes formed a tight
clade (clade II) and grouped with the Thai and Brazilian
strains of P. vivax. Though the source of the parasite cannot be concluded from the molecular study, the results
suggest that the P. vivax within these three malaria clusters were derived from parasite lineages that were commonly circulating within this region.
Entomological investigation

All adult mosquitoes caught from the malaria cluster
area and larval samples collected from various breeding
places were identified morphologically (Additional File
2). The predominant anopheline mosquitoes caught in
Mandai-Sungei Kadut and Sembawang were An. sinensis. Due to the wide morphological variations observed
in An. sinensis and the presence of several species
belonging to the An. hyrcanus group in Singapore, all
adult mosquitoes caught belonging to this species group

that have the pertinent taxonomic characteristic missing
(e.g. scales fallen off), were subjected to molecular analysis and were all confirmed to be An. sinensis (Figure 5).
Phylogenetic analysis inferred from the NJ method
showed that the ITS2 genes of adult An. sinensis caught
at the cluster areas formed a monophyletic clade with
other An. sinensis caught in other parts of Singapore
and those in Japan, South Korea, China and Thailand.
Percent divergent of An. sinensis caught in Singapore
ranges from 0.5 to 1.3% when compared to the same
species caught elsewhere.
In Jurong Island, adult mosquito surveillance yielded
only Culex species and no Anopheles; and larval surveillance detected Aedomyia species, Culex species and An.
separatus within 1 km around the living quarter of the

Page 8 of 11

cases. However, one breeding with two larvae of An.
sinensis was detected in a drain in a vacant land more
than 1 km away from the living quarters.
In Mandai-Sungei Kadut and Sembawang, a total of
98 adult Anopheles mosquitoes were obtained from the
cluster areas as shown in Additional File 2. In MandaiSungei Kadut, An. sinensis was the predominant anopheline mosquito (n = 67) and one An. karwari was
also caught. Larvae surveillance around the residence
and workplace of cases that spread across 3 km, yielded
four breedings of An. sinensis and one of a member of
the An. barbirostris complex. Anopheles sinensis was
found in drains, ground puddle, and disused quarry
filled with water; and An. barbirostris was found in
ground puddle.

In Sembawang, An. sinensis was the only adult Anopheline caught (n = 30). Larval surveillance also found
17 An. sinensis breedings in earth drains and ground
puddles, within 1 km from the implicated location of
transmission. No other Anopheline larvae were found.
Man biting/seeking An. sinensis was caught along the forest fringe. Interestingly, in Mandai-Sungei Kadut, they were
also caught biting men beside well-lit busy major asphalt
road. In Sembawang, they were caught in dimly lit open-air
restaurants. They were found to bite humans as early as
19:45 hour and were active till midnight. All anophelines
were negative for oocyst and sporozoites by dissection.
Parous rate, life expectancy and vectorial capacity of
Anopheles sinensis

The efficiency of a mosquito as a vector depends on how
long it lives and how frequently it feeds on humans. The
gonotrophic cycle of An. sinensis is three days [19]. The
parous rate of An. sinensis was 26.9 and 34.8 in MandaiSungei Kadut and Sembawang respectively as shown in
Table 2. The life expectancy of An. sinensis was determined using the formula of Garrett-Jones and Grab [20].
The vectorial capacity of An. sinensis using the formula
of Garrett-Jones and Shidrawi [21] was 0.04 and 0.17 for
Mandai-Sungei Kadut and Sembawang respectively as
shown in Table 2. From these results, it is evident that
only 1.3 and 2.8% of the mosquitoes would be expected
to live the 10 days necessary for the sporozoites to be
formed. Those surviving the 10 days would have a further
life expectancy of less than 1 day.
Though the most direct measurable index of transmission is the entomological inoculation rate, the rate cannot be determined, as these surveys yielded no infected
mosquito.

risk of malaria transmission in Singapore demands

continuous vigilance [2,3,22,23]. However, with the possibility of relapse of vivax malaria cases among the large
population of foreign workers from endemic countries,
determining if a cluster is due to local transmission can
be challenging. The hypnozoite stage of P. vivax can be
dormant in infected liver cells for months or years and
relapse of vivax cases are well known and documented. A
study in India has shown that the northern P. vivax
population was highly polymorphic and a high relapse
rate of 40% has been observed [24]. In Singapore, some
recent local transmissions, such as the incidents in Jurong
Island in 2006 and 2009 involved Indians and Bangladeshis only, and hence, despite the absence of any past
medical history of malaria infection, the contribution of
relapsed cases to these clusters remained uncertain.
The use of molecular techniques was instrumental in
confirming two of the local clusters (Mandai-Sungei
Kadut and Sembawang) to be outbreaks. Among the
Mandai-Sungei Kadut local cases, RFLP analysis of the
msp3a gene revealed that all, except one, shared the
same RFLP profile, which is generated by at least two
genotypes. Further cloning and sequencing of the msp1
gene confirmed the epidemiological link among all the
cases, and the multiple genotypes carried by each individual case. The same situation was found in Sembawang.
However, both the msp3a RFLP and msp1 sequence
analysis of Jurong Island cases showed that only two
cases were molecularly linked, and they were also linked
to the Mandai-Sungei Kadut outbreak.
In contrast to the outbreaks at Mandai-Sungei Kadut
and Sembawang, events at Jurong Island presented a
more interesting enigma. There were nine cases that
tested positive for P. vivax and detailed inquiry revealed
no recent travel history. However, molecular epidemiology revealed unique PCR-RFLP patterns among the
cases and vector findings showed only evidence of Anopheles separatus, a non-vector, as the only Anopheline
found within 1 km from the cases. A similar incident
occurred in 2006 in the same area, when 13 cases were
found among foreign workers from malaria endemic
regions, and no Anopheles was found in that location.
The molecular and entomological data suggest a possible coincident relapse among the cases at Jurong Island,
and data are in agreement with epidemiologic data,
which showed that only foreign workers from endemic
countries were involved in the Jurong island cluster.
Alternatively, this may reflect the limit of the molecular
techniques in finding common haplotypes when only a
single blood specimen was obtained from each worker.
The dynamics of disease transmission at Jurong Island
are still not fully understood and clearly warrant further
entomologic and molecular studies.
Interestingly, where there was substantial molecular
evidence of local transmission, adult An. sinensis was

Ng et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:305
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/305

predominant, and multiple breedings of the Anopheline
were found around the vicinity. There are no reports of
An. sinensis being a vector in Southeast Asia. In the
Malayan region, including Singapore, An. sinensis has
not been considered a vector, since it was found to be
more zoophagic and no malaria parasite sporozoites
have been found in the mosquito [16,25]. In Thailand,
An. sinensis has been considered only as a refractory
vector with weak transmission capability [16,26]. However, An. sinensis has been incriminated as a vector of
malaria in Northeast Asia viz. Korea and China [27-32].
In a recent experiment carried out on the susceptibility
of different strains of An. sinensis towards Korean and
Thai strains P. vivax, it was found that An. sinensis from
Korea was able to develop oocysts and sporozoites
against local strain of P. vivax and those from Thailand.
On the other hand, when fed with P. vivax (Thailand
strain), An. sinensis from Thailand failed to develop
sporozoites [33]. This clearly demonstrated the possible
variation in terms of the susceptibility of the different
geographical strains of An. sinensis to malaria parasites.
Park and co-workers reported that the sequences of
ITS2 and COII among 10 Asian An. sinensis strains
from China, Japan, Korea and Thailand were almost
identical to one another with very small sequence variation (< 1.5% in both regions), despite its relatively wide
geographical distribution range of > 2000 mi [34]. In
this current study, the local strains of An. sinensis has
also been found to be very similar (genetic divergent 0.5
to 1.3%) to the single cosmopolitan species concluded
by Park and coworkers. Despite the varying vectorial
status of the species demonstrated by laboratory experiment and field epidemiological evidences, current molecular techniques are not able to discriminate between
vector strain and non-vector strain. Genetic features
that better represent vector status should be of research
interest.
In the two recent Singapore outbreaks in Mandai and
Sembawang, An. sinensis has been the predominant species and its apparent intrusion into the urban setting
that fringes the rainforest may suggest some level of
adaptation. Furthermore, its biting period appeared to
coincide with the period (7:45 pm to 12 am) of human
activity. Whether An. sinensis is a malaria vector in Singapore, facilitated by the adaptation, remains elusive and
the vector of the two small concurrent outbreaks
remains cryptic.
Studies in Korea have shown that human biting rate of
An. sinensis has been 87.5 bites/man/night and the vectorial capacity was 0.081 [19]. In our brief study, though
the vectorial capacity was similar in Singapore (0.04 and
0.17), the bites/man/night was much lower, below 5. It
thus seems that the high transmission potential may be
due to the high human biting rate of the mosquito.

Results from this investigation strongly suggests that
An. sinensis, which has never been implicated as a vector in Singapore, was the predominant Anopheline in
Mandai-Sungei Kadut and Sembawang. In these areas,
there was substantial molecular evidence of local transmission and multiple breedings of the Anopheline were
found. Currently, work is ongoing to determine the vectorial status of An. sinensis. The human blood index is
not known and no sporozoites have been found. The
implication of An. sinensis as a vector would be significant, as this may result in the need to redefine boundaries of malaria receptive areas which are presently
based on the geographical distributions in Singapore of
An. maculatus and An. epiroticus (= An. sundaicus) [5].
Since it is critical to detect early any local transmission for control measures to be effective, the precautionary principle is applied by the public health authorities
such that every clustering of cases in place and time is
deemed to be a local outbreak until proven otherwise.
Molecular tools and techniques can elucidate the parasite genotype or strain and the data can be used to track
and link cases in an outbreak, but these techniques take
time to be developed and validated. Meanwhile, interviews to determine case movements and previous infection remain the mainstay in outbreak prevention and
control. Moving forward, this study shows how entomologic and molecular tools can be applied in epidemiologic investigation to provide an understanding of
outbreaks. If conducted promptly and regularly, the data
can be useful for assessment and mitigation of
transmission.
