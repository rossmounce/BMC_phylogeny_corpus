genome puzzle: comparative BAC-mapping and
low coverage shotgun sequencing

Abstract
Background: Food supply from the ocean is constrained by the shortage of domesticated and selected fish.
Development of genomic models of economically important fishes should assist with the removal of this
bottleneck. European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax L. (Moronidae, Perciformes, Teleostei) is one of the most
important fishes in European marine aquaculture; growing genomic resources put it on its way to serve as an
economic model.
Results: End sequencing of a sea bass genomic BAC-library enabled the comparative mapping of the sea bass
genome using the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus genome as a reference. BAC-end sequences
(102,690) were aligned to the stickleback genome. The number of mappable BACs was improved using a two-fold
coverage WGS dataset of sea bass resulting in a comparative BAC-map covering 87% of stickleback chromosomes
with 588 BAC-contigs. The minimum size of 83 contigs covering 50% of the reference was 1.2 Mbp; the largest
BAC-contig comprised 8.86 Mbp. More than 22,000 BAC-clones aligned with both ends to the reference genome.
Intra-chromosomal rearrangements between sea bass and stickleback were identified. Size distributions of mapped
BACs were used to calculate that the genome of sea bass may be only 1.3 fold larger than the 460 Mbp
stickleback genome.
Conclusions: The BAC map is used for sequencing single BACs or BAC-pools covering defined genomic entities by
second generation sequencing technologies. Together with the WGS dataset it initiates a sea bass genome
sequencing project. This will allow the quantification of polymorphisms through resequencing, which is important
for selecting highly performing domesticated fish.

Background
Teleost fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates,
with approximately 28,000 species, which have colonized
a range of aquatic environments and display a variety of
biochemical, physiological and morphological adaptations [1,2]. Because of this diversity and their position at
the base of the vertebrate phylogeny, some species are
considered good models of evolution, development and
human diseases [3-6]. For this reason, teleost species
were among the first vertebrate genomes to be
sequenced: the green spotted pufferfish, Tetraodon
nigroviridis [7]and the fugu Takifugu rubripes [8] for
their relatively small compact genome; the medaka

Oryzias latipes [9] and the zebrafish Danio rerio [10] for
their value as developmental models, short life cycle,
ease of maintenance and amenity to genetic manipulations [11,12]; and the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus http://www.ensembl.org as a model for
evolution [13]. However, no representative of the Perciformes, the most advanced and diverse group of teleosts
has been sequenced and genomic resources for this
taxonomic group are relatively limited. Furthermore, no
aquaculture fish species has had its genome sequenced
until now. Although sequences from model teleost fish
genomes are a valuable tool for comparative approaches
to elucidate the genomics of phylogenetically related
non-model teleost [14-17], they are selected for the
opposite reasons of aquaculture species, which generally
have large body mass and long reproductive cycles.

The European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax L. (Moronidae, Perciformes, Teleostei) is a major fisheries and
aquaculture species in the Mediterranean and Atlantic
coasts of Europe and North Africa. Its industrial production has steadily grown over the past two decades
and in 2008 it reached at least 105,900 metric tonnes
http://www.globefish.org. Worldwide, basses and other
perciform fish, which include the tunas, breams and tilapias, account for over 3.5 × 106 metric tonnes and USD
7 × 109 [18]. With the need to feed a growing population, an interest in healthy foods and the collapse of
wild fisheries stocks, aquaculture has acquired a great
importance [19,20]. Intensification of fish cultivation has
largely targeted selection of faster growth rates and better feed conversion ratios. Fish feeds rely heavily on wild
caught fish meal and oils, which puts further pressure
on fish stocks and are a source of eutrophying pollutants [19-21]. The development of cultivation methods
and new strains with increased productivity but at the
same time the ability to digest alternative sources from
plant material are therefore desirable objectives of the
industry. They should decrease the dependency on capture fisheries [22]. Other objectives are strains with
improved resistance to pathogens and tolerance to stress
[23]. However, and although classical selection methods
have an important role to play, genomic technologies
can improve the genetic and biological basis of traits
and allow direct selection on the genotype [23].
Economic and resource management interests have
led to increased research efforts to develop genomics
resources for European sea bass [24,25], including a >12
× coverage BAC-library [26], hundreds of microsatellite
[27] and SNP markers [28], ESTs (Passos et al., unpublished), a genetic linkage map [29,30] and a radiation
hybrid map (Senger, Galibert et al., unpublished). The
European sea bass nuclear DNA content has been estimated at 1.55-1.58 pg [31] approximately twice that of
T. rubripes [32], which, despite of advances in sequencing technologies, remains a large financial and logistic
hurdle.
With time strategies for full de novo sequencing of
large eukaryote genomes have shifted from whole genome shotgun (WGS) Sanger sequencing of cloned genomic DNA [8] to a combination of mapped large insert
clone and WGS sequencing [33,34]. Today, with the
evolution of second generation sequencing technologies,
the re-sequencing of eukaryote genomes by massive parallel WGS sequencing is feasible [35]. It is expected that
second generation sequencing technologies and especially pyrosequencing, which has been shown to cut
costs and speedup the de novo sequencing of microbial
genomes [36] will further contribute to reducing costs
and time to sequence large genomes of higher
eukaryotes.

In a pilot study for sequencing the genome of Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar) by Quinn et al. [37] pyrosequencing was useful for the generation of a draft sequence of
a megabase sized genomic region. It also turned out
that repeat richness in eukaryote genomes is the major
problem for de novo sequencing with second generation
technologies. Sequence-repeats resulted in a large
amount of gaps in the assembly as they could not be
resolved with reads shorter than the repeat itself, even if
paired-end tags were used to scaffold the assembled
contigs. A “first map, then sequence” strategy improves
this situation as large genomes can be split into smaller
subunits, which is one argument for genome mapping
with large insert clones. Moreover hybrid assembly of
Sanger sequencing data and short read data benefits
from both technologies, finding a good balance of cost
and quality [38].
Here we describe a comparative BAC-map and low
coverage draft of the European sea bass genome
obtained by high-throughput Sanger-sequencing of
BAC-libraries and whole genome shotgun plasmid
libraries as well as the exploitation of the synteny
between D. labrax and G. aculeatus. The dataset represents the first whole genome sequencing of a fish
belonging to the order of Perciformes and of a cultivated fish species, and sets the basic conditions for complete genome sequencing by second generation
techniques in the near future.

Results
BAC-end sequencing

After quality clipping (> 300 Q20 bases) and removal of
vector contamination, 102,690 BAC-end sequences (ES)
with an average read length of 670 bp remained for analysis (sequences were submitted to EMBL nucleotide
database [EMBL:FN436279 - EMBL:FN538968]. For a
total of 44,836 BAC-clones, paired end sequences (BACES) were determined, while for 13,018 BAC-clones only
one ES was obtained. The estimated genome size of D.
labrax based on diploid nuclear DNA content [31] is
approximately 763 Mbp, suggesting that with an average
insert size of 164 kbp per BAC, the genome coverage of
paired end-sequenced BACs is about 9.6 fold. Clones
that were sequenced only from one side sum up to an
additional 2.8 fold genome coverage (see Table 1).
For comparative mapping, a subset of 10,000 BAC-ES
was chosen to perform BLASTN searches with an evalue cut-off of 1e -5 against the genomes of D. rerio
[10], T. nigroviridis [7]], O. latipes [9] and G. aculeatus
http://www.ensembl.org. The genomic sequence of T.
rubripes [8]] was not used as the genome assembly has
not been assigned to chromosomes. The highest number
of matches was obtained against G. aculeatus (4,359 ES
matches), followed by O. latipes (2,702), T. nigroviridis

phylogenies, with D. rerio (superorder Ostariophysii) distantly related to the other candidates (all from the
superorder Acanthopterygii) [39].
Whole genome shotgun sequencing

Sequencing of whole genome shotgun libraries yielded >2
× 106 reads with an average Q20 read length of 673 bp
comprising ~1.4 Gbp and approximately twofold coverage
of the D. labrax genome. Assembly of WGS-reads and
BAC-ES yielded 273,453 contigs and 217,926 singlets covering ~580 Mbp. The N50 contig size was 2,891 bp and
the largest contig was 15,629 bp. A part of this dataset,
namely 36,166 contigs were useful to anchor additional
BAC-ES to the stickleback genome (see below). These
contigs have been submitted to EMBL nucleotide database
[EMBL:CABK01000001 - EMBL:CABK01036166].
Comparative mapping

The whole BAC-ES dataset was aligned with the fully
assembled stickleback genome. Further sorting and
screening yielded 25,845 BAC-ES where only one end
was sequenced or matched the stickleback genome and
13,996 BACs matched both ends to the same chromosome in stickleback. 18,013 BACs were matching weakly
and were excluded (mostly due to repetitive motifs or
possible chimeric BACs). BACs with both ES aligned
were essential for comparative mapping and could be
subdivided into 12,076 BACs with correct orientation
and distance of aligned ES and 1,920 BACs not matching these consistency criteria due to possible rearrangements, miss-alignments or assembly failures in the
stickleback genome. Plotting the frequency distribution
of insert size of consistently mapped BACs resulted in a
Gaussian-like distribution with a maximum at 115 kbp.
This reflects a compression of the stickleback genome
compared to the D. labrax genome, as the average insert
size published for D. labrax is about 164 kbp [26] (see
Fig. 1).
D. labrax BACs that were consistently positioned in
the stickleback genome were used to calculate a minimal tiling path of overlapping BAC-clones resulting in
816 BAC-contigs that cover 78.1% of the 400.8 Mbp
stickleback chromosomes and consisted of 3,629 BACs.

The minimal tiling path of the largest BAC-contig comprised 52 BACs and covered 5.03 Mbp on G. aculeatus
linkagegroup VI. N50 BAC-contig size was 0.53 Mbp. In
the chromosomal regions covered by comparatively
mapped BACs 77.5% of annotated genes assigned to
stickleback chromosomes can be found (see Table 2,
Table 3 and Table 4/values in brackets).
Comparative mapping was improved by aligning BACES containing contigs from the WGS and BAC-ES
assembly to stickleback chromosomes. This strategy
yielded 20,635 BACs matching consistency criteria, an
improvement of about 71% compared to comparative
mapping using only BAC-ES data. The re-calculated
minimal tiling path reduced total contig number to 588
and N50 contig number to 83 while increasing N50
BAC-contig size to 1.2 Mbp and coverage of stickleback
chromosomes to 87% (see Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and
Fig. 2, a complete list of ordered paired-end aligned
BAC clones on stickleback chromosomes may be downloaded [Additional file 1]).
Moreover the higher coverage with BACs enabled the
identification of potential intra-chromosomal rearrangements between sea bass and stickleback (or failures in
the stickleback assembly). A number of 214 potential
chromosomal breakpoints spanned by BAC-clones were
identified [Additional file 2]. To check if rearrangements
were artefacts, the order of calculated BAC-contigs was
cross-checked by alignment to the medaka genome (see
Fig. 3). In total 139 cases (65%), had a neighbouring
position at that site and thus confirmed the consistency
of the identified BAC-clone on the second reference
genome.
Fig. 4 shows PCR results that support the bioinformatic
data on rearrangements between sea bass and stickleback. All of the seven rearrangements that were checked
by PCR have been confirmed. For each of these rearrangements we found at least 2 BAC clones that gave positive results in the PCR, the average number of BAC
clones spanning a rearrangement was 4.6 and the maximum number was 7 clones.
The consistently mapped BACs were also uploaded to
the Ensembl genome browser and may be viewed in a
user friendly format alongside the annotated stickleback
chromosomes (see Fig. 5)

insertsize [bp]

Figure 1 Comparison of BAC insert size frequency distributions. Insert sizes calculated by sea bass BAC-ES, consistently mapped to
stickleback chromosomes, show a shift to lower insert sizes compared to the observed insert size of the library published by Whitaker et al. [26].
This observation can be explained by genome size evolution in teleosts. As the genome of sea bass is known to be larger than the stickleback
genome the lower insert size of mapped BACs reflects the average size difference of orthologous loci. By dividing the insert sizes at the maxima
of the distributions, it can be concluded that the sea bass genome is about 1.3 fold larger than the stickleback genome.

Discussion
Recently BAC-end sequencing has been a tool for scaffolding large eukaryotic genome assemblies and thus
became important in the final phase of sequencing projects. Today as the number of eukaryotic genomes in
the databases is steadily increasing, comparative mapping approaches will change that picture. In the case of
Dicentrarchus labrax BAC-end sequencing started
before a whole genome project was even planned and
enabled a fast and cost-effective mapping of the genome.

thus detecting possible overlaps of clones that subsequently can be combined into contigs. This strategy has
been successfully applied to closely related organisms
such as chimpanzee and human [44] and also to more
distantly related organisms like cattle and human [45].
Comparative mapping has some advantages for automated analysis over the methods mentioned above, as
established pipelines for high-throughput sequencing
and bioinformatics can be used.
BAC end sequencing results

Comparative mapping compared to other mapping
strategies

Since publication of the first BAC-vector [40] several
strategies for the construction of physical genome maps
from BAC-libraries have been published. Among these
methods BAC-filter hybridization [41], BAC-fingerprinting [42] and PCR screening [43] have been applied most
frequently. Comparative mapping approaches are likely
to replace these methods because many genomes of
higher eukaryotes have been published. Comparative
maps are built by aligning paired end sequences of large
insert clones (e.g. BACs) to a reference genome and

Sanger sequencing of BAC-ends remains restricted to a
96 well format in many sequencing centers, because of
low template yields and large amounts of template used
for the sequencing reactions. Thus the successful development of an automated DNA purification process to
purify BAC-DNA from 384 well plates was a crucial
step to enable the comparative genome mapping of D.
labrax. With an average read length of 650 bp on 36
cm and 750 bp on 50 cm capillaries the read length of
BAC-end sequences was substantially higher than
reported in comparable projects [45]. Failed reactions
were less than 11%.

represent results of improved mapping using BAC-ES together with whole genome shotgun data.

Reference genomes

Besides read quality, the choice of a suitable reference
genome is influencing mapping success and quality. Several sequenced genomes of model teleosts are available
(e.g. D. rerio, T. nigroviridis, T. rubripes, O. latipes and
G. aculeatus). With the highest number of mappable
reads, the stickleback genome sequences shared the
highest homology to D. labrax, making it the genome of
choice for a comparative approach. The stickleback and
the European sea bass belong to the superorder Percomorpha, and the evolutionary related orders of Gasterosteiformes and Perciformes, respectively [46].
Additional beneficial features of the stickleback genome
sequence is the high sequencing coverage (~12 fold) and
the mapping of most scaffolds to chromosomes.
The comparative map

After BAC-ES data for sea bass became available, a
first comparative BAC-map was built. Results were
already usable to render megabase sized contigs and to
screen for BACs covering genes of interest. Subsequently with a WGS dataset of the sea bass genome
available, BAC-ES sequences and WGS data were

combined by assembly. If a BAC-ES alone could not
be matched with the reference earlier on, the length
extension of the BAC-ES by aligned WGS reads now
increased the probability to find matches with good
alignments to the reference genome. Final mapping
(Fig. 2) shows in green that most of stickleback chromosomes are covered by D. labrax BACs with consistent orientation and distance (87% of reference
genome), while red regions have a weak mapping,
where no or only one BAC-end sequence could be
matched. These regions may be either due to highly
repetitive fragments, gaps and/or failures in the assembly of the sticklebackgenomic sequence or regions that
are underrepresented in the BAC-library. It is obvious
that especially centromeric and telomeric regions,
known for the problems mentioned above, account for
weakly mapped regions.
Calculating the genome size of D. labrax

When comparing the insert size distribution of consistently mapped BACs on the reference genome with the
published insert size distribution of the D. labrax BAClibrary (Fig. 1), a shift to lower insert sizes is observed.

Rows (A) show a summary of the 21 reference chromosomes (stickleback assembly: BROAD S1, Feb 2006) and the known corresponding genetic linkage groups
of sea bass according to Chistiakov et al. [30]. Rows (B) summarize consistently mapped BAC-ES, BAC-contigs and reference genome/chromosome coverage of
the minimal tiling path. Rows (C) focus on inconsistently mapped BAC-ES, which where further analysed for potential intra-chromosomal rearrangements and
compared to the medaka genome as a second reference genome. Rows (D) display the number of annotated genes in stickleback and the percentage of them
covered by the sea bass BAC-map. Values in brackets “()” show results for a comparative map that was built by using only BAC-ES data, while all other values
represent results of improved mapping using BAC-ES together with whole genome shotgun data.

An explanation for this may be found in the evolution
of genome size. It has been shown that teleost genomes
tend to accumulate most indels in intergenic or intronic
regions leading towards large differences in genome size,
while synteny of genes is conserved [47]. Thus one may
conclude that the ratio of the maxima in the insert size
distributions of BAC-clones equals the ratio of genome
sizes. From this calculation one may conclude that the
D. labrax genome is about 1.3 fold larger than the 460
Mbp of the G. aculeatus genome. The calculated haploid genome size of 600 Mbp is smaller than the estimated haploid genome size of 763 Mbp derived from
flow cytometric measurements of diploid nuclear DNA
content [31]. A smaller genome size is also suggested by
the first assembly of our twofold coverage WGS dataset
(see WGS sequencing results). Nevertheless, genome
size estimates from sequencing may be biased towards
the euchromatic portion of the genomes and different
results of the methods may be explained by underrepresentation or different size evolution of heterochromatic
regions.

Comparing the BAC and the linkage map of D. labrax

BAC contigs represented by green regions in Fig. 2 are
considered blocks with a high level of synteny between
D. labrax and G. aculeatus. Nevertheless it is questionable whether neighbouring BAC-contigs on the reference
genome are really neighbours in the D. labrax genome or
whether chromosomes have undergone extensive interchromosomal rearrangements during evolution. To
decide either whether a rearrangement has taken place or
the order of BAC-contigs is consistent in both genomes,
it is helpful to compare results from the D. labrax genetic
linkage map and the radiation hybrid map of the closely
related sparid Sparus aurata (gilthead sea bream). Such
comparisons with stickleback have been done by Chistiakov et al. [30] and Sarropoulou et al. [16] and showed
synteny of complete chromosomes between these species.
Chromosome identity and re-shuffling are common features among closely related organisms. The different
chromosome number of G. aculeatus (n = 21) and D.
labrax (n = 24) is a common feature between related taxa
and can be explained by fusions/fissions of complete

orthologous groups. Thus it is unlikely that BAC-contigs
mapped to one G. aculeatus chromosome are not located
on a single D. labrax chromosome. These results also
allow assigning the comparatively mapped BAC-contigs
to D. labrax linkage groups (Table 2A, Table 3A and
Table 4A).
Comparison of the D. labrax linkage map with the G.
aculeatus genome has suggested some intra-chromosomal rearrangements [30]. Due to the higher resolution
of the comparative BAC-map, it is possible to pinpoint
potential rearrangements by focussing on inconsistently
mapped BACs that connect two BAC-contigs at their
boundary regions. Since BAC-libraries are known to
harbour some chimeric clones, the location of potentially neighbouring BAC-contigs was confirmed by
cross-checking their position in the medaka genome. If
BAC-contigs connected by a rearrangement spanning
BAC were located next to each other in the medaka
genome, a true rearrangement was considered (Fig. 3).
In this way 139 BACs spanning rearrangements between
the reference and D. labrax genome were identified.
Seven rearrangements between chr III of stickleback and

the corresponding sea bass linkage group 10 were also
tested by means of PCR. All of them could be confirmed
(Fig. 4).
Applications

The main advantage of BAC-maps over other mapping
methods, like genetic linkage maps or radiation hybrid
maps, is the possibility to access defined portions of a
genome for subsequent analysis by common methods of
molecular genetics. As the comparative BAC-map covers
about 85.4% of predicted G. aculeatus genes, it is now
possible to easily access orthologous D. labrax genes by
selecting a BAC-clone that covers the genomic region of
interest. As proof of principle, we have successfully
identified and shotgun sequenced 10 overlapping BACclones that cover a 1.3 Mbp genomic region on sea bass
linkage group 5 (Negrisolo et al. in preparation). The
BAC map was also used to analyze two clones that contain a novel immune-type receptor (NITR) gene cluster
[48] and to sequence the fatty acid delta-6 desaturase
gene in European sea bass (Santigosa et al. in
preparation).

Figure 2 Visualization of comparative sea bass BAC map on 21 stickleback chromosomes. Green regions represent BAC-contigs, which are
covered on average 5.25 fold by consistently mapped BAC-clones. In total 87.0% of the stickleback chromosomes and 85.4% of annotated genes
are covered by the BAC-contigs. Regions with weak mapping results are shown in red and mainly due to repetitive regions like centromeric or
telomeric regions, where it is hard to consistently align both BAC-ES. Nevertheless BACs having good matches with one end may be found in
these regions. Most of the stickleback chromosomes can be assigned to sea bass genetic linkage groups (see Table 2A, Table 3A and Table 4A).

Conclusions
The comparative approach enabled a fast and cost effective mapping of large genomic portions of the D. labrax
genome; it was further refined by adding WGS data
from the early stage sequencing project. Both, WGSand BAC-end sequencing data now represent a solid
basis for sequencing the complete genome in a “first
map, then sequence” approach with second-generation
techniques, such as pyrosequencing. The BAC-map
allows splitting the genome into smaller BAC-pools (e.g.
covering single chromosomes). This will facilitate the
sequence assembly as short reads are a major problem
of new sequencing technologies, when sequencing
repeat-rich eukaryotic genomes.
The integration of linkage [30], radiation hybrid (Senger,
Galibert, in preparation) and BAC-mapping (this study) of
sea bass will certainly result in a high quality physical map
of the genome. It sets the scene for quantifying polymorphisms and genomic architecture. These are powerful
resources for quantitative trait loci mapping, which can be
eventually applied in selective breeding using marker
assisted selection or introgression [24]. There is also the
possibility of genome wide association mapping, based on
massive resequencing, to identify genomic regions affecting the phenotype [49,50]. Therefore it sets the basic

conditions for research to improve the sustainability of sea
bass aquaculture in the Mediterranean basin and (shell)
fish aquaculture in general.

Methods
BAC end-sequencing

The Dicentrarchus labrax BAC-library constructed by
Whitaker et al. [26] was obtained from the German
resources center for genome research (RZPD, Berlin,
Germany). The library comprises pCC1BAC-clones
arrayed in 180 × 384 well microtiter plates. The total
genome coverage of the library is >12 fold with an average insert size of 164 kbp per BAC-clone. For end
sequencing, BAC-clones were inoculated in 2 × 384
deep well plates containing 190 μl of 2YT media and
12.5 mg/l chloramphenicol and cultivated for 18 h at
37°C with rigorous shaking at 1100 rpm in Titramax
1000 incubators (Heidolph Instruments). BAC-DNA was
purified by an automated process that was developed at
the MPI for molecular genetics. The process applies size
selective precipitation in polyethylene-glycol 6000/2-propanol mixtures and a final washing step with ethanol
70% (v/v).
BAC-templates were end sequenced using ABI BigDyeV3.1 Terminator chemistry and T7 or SP6 primers.

Figure 3 A closer look at potential intra-chromosomal rearrangements. (A) For each stickleback chromosome, sea bass BAC clones can be
determined whose BAC-ES pairs are inconsistently aligned in terms of distance or alignment orientation. If these pairs are incorporated in the
mapping visualization as black lines, it can be found that edges of BAC-contigs are connected by these clones. It is very likely that these clones
represent candidates that span intra-chromosomal rearrangements between stickleback and sea bass. (B) To increase significance of
rearrangements and exclude rearrangements that were proposed due to chimeric BAC clones, the position of edges of BAC contigs was crosschecked on medaka chromosomes. For chromosome III we found that most of the rearrangements between sea bass and stickleback could be
confirmed by comparison with medaka as a second reference genome. In total 214 potential rearrangements between sea bass and stickleback
chromosomes could be pinpointed; about 65% of these were confirmed by comparison with medaka (see Table 2C, Table 3C and Table 4C). For
visualizations of all chromosomes see supplemental data section. Rearrangements that were evaluated by PCR are labelled with the
corresponding lanes in Fig. 4. For a detailed view of BACs ordered between 8.47 Mbp and 9.47 Mbp see Fig. 5.

Figure 4 Evaluation of seven potential rearrangements between stickleback chr III and the corresponding sea bass linkage group 10
by means of PCR. Primers were designed on sea bass BAC-ES representing the ends of BAC contigs that seem to be connected by a
rearrangement spanning BAC-clone. PCR was performed on the connecting BAC to proof the overlap with both BAC contigs and on genomic
DNA to check that the PCR product was a unique marker in the sea bass genome. The amplified markers are shown above, for each
rearrangement the first and second lane represents the markers amplified on the rearrangement spanning BAC, the third and fourth lane shows
the same markers amplified on genomic sea bass DNA. Lane 1-4: bassbac140-o20/stickleback chr III 6.6 Mbp <> 2.66 Mbp. Lane 5-8: bassbac137j6/stickleback chr III 14.06 Mbp <> 16.65 Mbp. Lane 9-12: bassbac-1g24/stickleback chr III 16.14 Mbp <> 10.6 Mbp. Lane 13-16: bassbac38h23/stickleback chr III 0.5 Mbp <> 10.55 Mbp.

seven BACs had overlaps with the two BAC-contigs predicted by the comparative mapping approach. 12 out of 14 markers were unique in the
sea bass genome. 2 markers (Lane 20 and 28) could not be amplified using genomic DNA as a template.

After post-sequencing cleanup by ethanol/NaAcetate
precipitation, sequence analysis was performed on
ABI3730 × l capillary sequencers with either 36 cm or
50 cm capillary arrays. Processing of raw sequencing
data was done by the PHRED basecaller [51], quality
clipping and vector-clipping by LUCY [52].
Whole genome shotgun sequencing

For the construction of WGS plasmid libraries of Dicentrarchus labrax, we obtained genomic DNA isolated
from the same specimen (male 57 originating from the
Adriatic clade) that was used for BAC-library construction (kindly provided by A. Libertini, CNR, Venice, Italy
through J. B. Taggart, University of Stirling, UK).
Genomic DNA was sheared by ultrasonic sound and size
selected for fragment sizes of 0.9 - 1.5 kbp and 1.5 - 4 kbp.
Fragments were polished by T4-DNA-polymerase/DNApolymerase I (Klenow) and ligated with T4-DNA-Ligase
into SmaI digested pUC19 sequencing vector. Competent
E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen) were transformed by electroporation, plated on 22 × 22 cm agarplates (Nunc) containing LB media with 110 mg/l Ampicillin, X-GAL and
IPTG. After 16 h of incubation at 37°C white colonies
were arrayed into 384 well microtiter library plates by a
picking robot (Q Bot, Genetix). These plates (media: LB

+HMFM+Ampicillin) were again incubated for 16 h at 37°
C and stored at -80°C. Plasmid DNA preparation was
done as described for BAC-DNA with the difference that
the final washing step with 70% (v/v) ethanol was not
necessary and a single 384 deepwell microtiter plate filled
with 190 μl of 2YT + 110 mg/l Ampicillin yielded enough
template amounts for several sequencing reactions.
Sequencing, sequence analysis and sequence processing of plasmids was done as described above using ABI
BigDyeV3.1 Terminator chemistry and M13(-40) or
M13(-28) primers.
Alignment of BAC-ES to reference genome

BAC-ES were aligned by BLAST [53,54] algorithms to
genomic sequence of G. aculeatus (Assembly: BROAD
S1, Feb 2006, http://www.ensembl.org). To minimize
computational time BLAST searches were done incrementally beginning with stringent parameters (Megablast, word size 20, and nucleotide mismatch penalty
-1). Results were filtered for alignments that matched
with an e-value equal or lower than 10-5. Additionally,
alignments were only submitted to further analysis, if
the second best alignment resulted in an e-value that
was at least 105-fold larger than the e-value of the best
alignment. Sequences with alignments not matching

Kuhl et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:68
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/68

these criteria were extracted by notseq [55] and subsequently aligned by BLAST searches with lower stringency. Stringency in the following rounds was adjusted
by choosing word sizes of 15, 11 and 7.
The number of BAC-ES with alignments meeting our
criteria was further improved by adding sequences from
whole genome shotgun sequencing of D. labrax. All
sequences available were assembled by the Celera
Assembler [56]. Contigs that contained BAC-ES were
filtered and again aligned to the G. aculeatus genome as
described above. Match coordinates of contigs on G.
aculeatus chromosomes were corrected by position of
the BAC-ES in the contigs and assigned to the corresponding BAC-ES.
Calculating and visualizing the comparative map

Resulting BLAST-tables of both approaches were
screened for BACs that were aligned with both ends.
These BACs were further screened for matches to the
same chromosome in G. aculeatus and then checked for
consistent orientation and distance.
BACs that matched all consistency criteria were chosen for the calculation of a minimal tiling path. Starting
with a first BAC-clone, BAC-contigs were constructed
by choosing BACs that were overlapping and maximizing the contig in length. These analyses were done by
common spreadsheet software and scripting language.
BAC-contigs arranged on the 21 G. aculeatus chromosomes were visualized by passing coordinates to a vector
graphics application (CorelDRAW version 11, Corel
corp., Ottawa, Canada). To view the BAC map alongside
the annotated stickleback genome the mapping coordinates were uploaded to the ensembl genome browser as
a GFF formatted textfile.
Dealing with possible rearrangements and checking them
on a second reference genome

The subset of BAC-ES that aligned to the same chromosome but did not match consistency criteria could be
due to intra-chromosomal rearrangements between
stickleback and sea bass. These clones were visualized as
black arcs on the stickleback chromosomes. If these arcs
were starting not at the edge of contigs they were
manually removed. To check if the rearrangement spanning BAC-ES have a consistent order in the medaka
genome, we exploited stickleback and medaka synteny
of orthologous genes. Using the biomart tool a table was
prepared that showed the genes annotated to stickleback
with their orthologous position in medaka. Furthermore
the coordinates of contig starts and ends from the sea
bass BAC-map were implemented in the table. In this
way the position of sea bass contig starts and ends on
medaka could be mapped to stickleback chromosome
coordinates. BAC-contig edges that are located next to

Page 11 of 13

each other in medaka were subsequently visualized by
arcs, in many cases confirming a connection between
contigs that was also found before by non-consistent
matching sea bass BAC-ES.
Evaluation of several rearrangements by means of PCR

Seven potential rearrangements between stickleback chr
III and the corresponding sea bass linkage group were
checked by means of PCR. Primers for PCR were
designed on BAC-ES representing the end of BAC-contigs that seem to be connected by a rearrangement
spanning clone. Subsequently amplification of the chosen markers was carried out using the rearrangements
spanning clones as templates. If both BAC-contig end
markers can be amplified on a rearrangement spanning
BAC, the overlap and therefore connection of the two
BAC-contigs in sea bass is confirmed. Additionally markers were amplified on genomic DNA of sea bass to
check that they are unique markers in the genome. The
PCR was set up as 50 μl reactions. For amplification of
BAC-templates we added 2 μl of overnight culture to
the PCR, while amplification of genomic DNA was carried out by adding 2 μl DNA with a concentration of 45
ng/μl to the PCR. Composition of PCR was as follows:
0.3 μM for each primer, 300 μM dNTPs, 75 mM TRISHCl, pH 9, 20 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.01% Tween 20, 2.5
mM MgCl2, 0.1 U/μl Taq-DNA-polymerase and 0.5 M
Betaine. Thermocycler profile was: Step I: 5 min at 94°
C. Step II: 30 s at 94°C. Step III: 30 s at 55°C. Step IV: 1
min at 72°C. Step V: 7 min at 72°C. Step VI: hold at 4°
C. Steps II-IV were repeated 25 times. PCR products
were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels and stained with
ethidium bromide.
