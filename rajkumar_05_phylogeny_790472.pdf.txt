Abstract
Background: Analysis of human complete mitochondrial DNA sequences has largely contributed
to resolve phylogenies and antiquity of different lineages belonging to the majorhaplogroups L, N
and M (East-Asian lineages). In the absence of whole mtDNA sequence information of M lineages
reported in India that exhibits highest diversity within the sub-continent, the present study was
undertaken to provide a detailed analysis of this macrohaplogroup to precisely characterize and
unravel the intricate phylogeny of the lineages and to establish the antiquity of M lineages in India.
Results: The phylogenetic tree constructed from sequencing information of twenty-four whole
mtDNA genome revealed novel substitutions in the previously defined M2a and M6 lineages. The
most striking feature of this phylogenetic tree is the recognition of two new lineages, M30 and M31,
distinguished by transitions at 12007 and 5319, respectively. M30 comprises of M18 and identifies
a potential new sub-lineage possessing substitution at 16223 and 16300. It further branches into
M30a sub-lineage, defined by 15431 and 195A substitution. The age of M30 lineage was estimated
at 33,042 YBP, indicating a more recent expansion time than M2 (49,686 YBP). The M31 branch
encompasses the M6 lineage along with the previously defined M3 and M4 lineages. Contradictory
to earlier reports, the M5 lineage does not always include a 12477 substitution, and is more
appropriately defined by a transversion at 10986A. The phylogenetic tree also identifies a potential
new lineage in the M* branch with HVSI sequence as 16223,16325. Substitutions in M25 were in
concordance with previous reports.
Conclusion: This study describes five new basal mutations and recognizes two new lineages, M30
and M31 that substantially contribute to the present understanding of macrohaplogroup M. These
two newly erected lineages include the previously independent lineages M18 and M6 as sub-lineages
within them, respectively, suggesting that most mt DNA genomes might arise as limited offshoots
of M trunk. Furthermore, this study supports the non existence of lineages such as M3 and M4 that
are solely defined on the basis of fast mutating control region motifs and hence, establishes the
importance of coding region markers for an accurate understanding of the phylogeny. The deep
roots of M phylogeny clearly establish the antiquity of Indian lineages, especially M2, as compared
to Ethiopian M1 lineage and hence, support an Asian origin of M majorhaplogroup.

Background
During the last few years a surge in information on mitochondrial DNA control region sequence has been
observed along with information from coding region substitutions in diverse populations of the world to understand their genetic diversity, structuring and origins [111]. More recently, mt DNA sequence data has been used
to explore the peopling of Asia and to comprehend various population demographic parameters [12-20]. From a
human genetics perspective India assumes importance in
Asia because (1) the extensive diversity of populations
residing in the sub-continent, which are biologically and
culturally differentiated among themselves, (2) a clear distinction exists between non-tribal and tribal populations,
autochthonous to the sub-continent [15,21], lastly and
more importantly this expanse is believed to be one of the
early regions of settlement of modern humans [20]. Of
the four major matrilines identified till date L, M, N and
R, about 60% of Indians trace their maternal roots in
Indian specific branches of haplogroup M that is reported
to have emerged from the African haplogroup L3. With
the exception of the M1 lineage that is confined to Ethiopia [22], all the other branches of this macrohaplogroup
including M*, C, D, G, E and Z haplogroups are observed
in Asia [12,14,23,24]. The lineages M2, M3, M4, M5, M6,
M18 and M25 are exclusive to India, with M2 reported to
be the most ancient lineage in the sub-continent with an
age estimation of 60,000 yrs-75,000 yrs. Furthermore, the
frequencies of these clades among the different geographic, linguistic phyla and social strata have been investigated in detail, yet the fundamental question regarding
origin of this super-haplogroup still remains unanswered
[15,20]. While some authors have suggested a southwest
Asian origin of M macrohaplogroup, followed by a back
migration to Africa [15], others support its African ancestry [25]. One major drawback in arriving to a conclusion
is the limitation of control region sequences in providing
reliable estimate of phylogeny owing to homoplasy and
recurrent mutations [23,26].
Complete mitochondrial genome sequencing has gained
importance in resolving phylogenies and understanding
human evolution. Extensive genome sequencing studies
have been carried out in different lineages of L, N and M
major- haplogroups across different global populations.
Though the phylogenies of East Asian counter parts of M
lineages: M7, M8a, M8C, M8Z, M9, E, D, G have been
resolved in detail, but till date no similar studies have
been attempted on the sub-lineages of the Indian M haplogroup [9,27-33]. The complete mt DNA sequence information from Indian M lineages will not only help answer
questions regarding the origin and antiquity of this haplogroup, and resolving the phylogeny to finer branches but
would also be highly relevant in understanding various
parameters of population genetics, mitochondrial disor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/26

ders and disease diagnosis and to some extent in forensic
work [[28] and references therein].
The present study was undertaken to construct an unambiguous phylogeny for the M macrohaplogroup and to
estimate its antiquity. Mitochondrial genomes were initially classified on the basis of their HVSI and coding
region motifs, followed by complete sequencing of
twenty-three samples representing different M
matrilineals.

Results
We have found seven group defining basal substitutions
and described fourteen lineages in detail from complete
mt DNA genome sequence information, which would be
helpful in further resolving some of the Indian M lineages.
The M trunk differs from revised Cambridge reference
sequence (rCRS) with substitutions at A73G, A263G,
T489C, A750G, A2706G, A1438G, A4769G, C7028T,
A8701G, A8860G, T9540C, A10398G, C10400T,
T10873C, G11719A, C12705T, C14766T, T14783C,
G15043A, G15301A, A15326G and C16223T. The coding
region mutation sites analyzed in the present study were
different from those observed in the sister M1 lineage
found in Ethiopia. The M phylogenetic tree constructed
on whole mt sequence information of twenty four samples belonging to different M lineages and their sub-types
including M1, M2, M2a, M2b, M30, M30a, M18, M*, M3,
M4, M5, M6, and M25 is provided in Figure 1.
M2 lineage
The complete sequencing of five mt DNA genomes
belonging to M2 and its sub-lineages, M2a and M2b, indicated that coding region mutations T477C, T1780C,
A8502G were associated with HVSI motifs C16223T and
G16319A, which formed the root of M2 lineages. In case
of M2a, we report a novel basal substitution at site
T9758C in addition to previously reported transitions at
G5252A and A8396G. Screening of T9758C site in twenty
seven Indian individuals possessing M2a specific HVSI
and coding region motifs, clearly establishes this mutation as a marker of this sub-lineage. The M2b sub-lineage
having HVSI motif G16274A and T16357C, in addition to
M2 defining mutations sites did not share any coding
region substitutions with M2a. Overall, M2 lineage
presents the maximum number of coding region mutation sites than any other analyzed lineage in this study.
M30 lineage
A new lineage M30 was recognized in the M macrohaplogroup, comprising of seven mt genomes, six of whose
HVSI motifs did not correspond to any of the earlier established M lineages and one that was recently identified as
M18 lineage (represented as shaded region in Fig 1). Since
lineages of M have already been catalogued from M1 to

Phylogenetic tree of M macrohaplogroup based on complete mt DNA genome sequences
Phylogenetic tree of M macrohaplogroup based on complete mt DNA genome sequences. Numbers along links refer to substitutions at nucleotide positions with respect to rCRS. Suffixes are transversions. Grey colour represents potential new lineage.
Asterisk denotes unclassified lineage. The M haplogroup differs from the rCRS at sites: 73, 263, 489, 750, 2706, 1438, 4769,
7028, 8701, 8860, 9540,10398, 10400, 10873, 11719, 12705, 14766, 14783, 15043, 15301, 15326, 16223.

M25, this potential new lineage is designated as M30 to
avoid any ambiguity in classification of M macrohaplogroup. This branch arises from the main M trunk with
transition at site G12007A. Finer resolution of this lineage
was achieved by further clustering four complete
sequences with mutation at two sites, T195A and
G15431A into a sub-lineage designated as M30a. A total
of eighteen Indian individuals belonged to M30a lineage.
Three mt DNA genomes further branched out from M30
lineage, possessing only G12007A substitution. Interestingly, the newly described M18 (C16223, A16318T) matriline is one of the branches that directly emerged from
M30 lineage. Sequence analysis of ten M18 mt DNA
genomes showed the presence of G12007A transition.
Eighteen Indian individuals were identified from our
mtDNA database as possessing a HVSI motif (C16223T,
A16300G) similar to the Saora sample, which arose as an
offshoot of M30 lineage. All eighteen individuals tested
positive for G12007A transition, suggesting that it might
be acceptable to place M18 under M30 lineage.
M5 lineage
The basal motif T12477C, G16129A and C16223T
describes M5 lineage of majorhaplogroup M. Whole
genome sequencing of three samples with similar HVSI
motif, G16129A and C16223T, revealed that only one
sample (I. B306) exhibited the T12477C mutation, and

designated as M5a sub-lineage (Fig 1). This site was nevertheless absent in the other two samples, one of which had
a similar HVSI motif as M5a mt DNA genome, while the
other exhibited an additional site G16048A in its control
region motif. Our study identifies a transversion at
C10986A, shared by all the three samples, suggesting that
these sequence types branched out from a common root.
Analysis of C10986A substitution in seven Indian samples
possessing HVSI motif, G16048A, G16129A and
C16223T, confirms our finding that different branches
emerged from M5 lineage. It is, however, important to
note that G16129A might not be important in defining
M5 and C10986A marker remains confined to this lineage
until tested in a sufficiently large number of undefined
M*samples.
M25 lineage
The M25 lineage has been recently described by the presence of G15928A and T16304C. It differs from the M
halogroup by five coding region substitutions and arises
directly from the M trunk with no additional group defining motifs.
M31 lineage
The present analysis defines another new lineage that
emerged from the main trunk of M macrohaplogroup,
with a substitution at A5319G. Keeping in succession with

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:26

the numbering of lineages, we designate this lineage as
M31. This branch comprises of the previously welldefined M6 lineage along with M3 and M4 lineages.
The two M6 matrilines completely sequenced, harbor the
characteristic group defining mutations at site T16231C,
T16362C and C3539T. Our analysis deciphered another
novel substitution at site A5301G in this lineage.
Whole sequencing of two M3 genomes (defined by
T16126C transition) demonstrated a lack of similarity in
their coding region substitutions. Since both T16126C
and C16311T are fast mutating sites, we propose the nonexistence of M3 and M4 lineages in the M phylogeny.
Three mt DNA genomes could not be differentiated in the
study and were left designated as M*. One of the M*
genomes was previously characterized as M3 lineage and
differed in its coding region substitutions from the other
M3, currently placed under M31 lineage. The matrilineal
type possessing C16223T and T16325C as HVSI motif has
been observed in relatively high frequency in Indian populations. Contrary to our expectation, full sequencing of
this mt DNA (Ho69), did not exhibit the presence of
G12007A mutation site that was observed in other unidentified M lineages analyzed in this study. Similar results
were observed after complete sequencing of the HVSI
motif type C16223T and C16251T.
The newly described phylogeny based on twenty-three
Indian specific mt DNA sequence information radiates
from the trunk of M macrohaplogroup with limited
number of branches, differing in their basal motifs with
one or more coding region substitutions. The branching
pattern displayed by M2, M30, M31 and their sub-lineages mirrors the expansion model, indicating that most of
the lineages described on basis of their control region
sequence, occupy peripheral positions of the phylogeny.
M2 is estimated to be the oldest lineage with an age of
49,686+/- 10,903 years before present (YBP). Furthermore, sub-lineage M2a differs from M2 by a minimum of
six coding region substitutions, reiterating the antiquity of
M2. The newly defined M30 and M31 lineages differ from
the root of M by six to eight substitutions and hence, display similar expansion ages of approximately 33,042+/7,840 YBP.

Discussion
Analysis of short stretches of mt DNA HVSI and HVSII
region have significantly aided in clearly discriminating
some of the M lineages. With the aim of understanding
migration routes of diverse Indian people, more control
region sequences are being generated without much support from coding region sites, resulting in an increasing
number of conflicts within the classification of its line-

ages. We report a phylogenetic tree constructed from the
whole genome sequencing of twenty-three Indian and
one Ethiopian M lineage to resolve some of the anomalies
occurring due to recurrent mutations in control region.
The control region sequences have exhibited the presence
of an array of M lineages in India [12,16,20], despite
which, complete mt DNA sequencing suggests that most
of these lineages arose as limited offshoots of the main M
trunk. The newly constructed M phylogeny displays difference in the branching patterns of lineages, with total
number of substitution sites varying even within a lineage. Substantial variation in branch length within a lineage is indicative of the existence of further branching that
could probably be delineated with generation of additional data. The M2 genome and its sub-lineages, more
specifically M2a, have been well described in Indian population. Nevertheless complete sequencing of M2a demonstrated the presence of a novel site T9758C, which is
characterized as a diagnostic marker for M2a sub-lineage,
in addition to the previous reported, G5252A and
A8396G transitions [15]. This finding reinforces the
importance of sequencing a large number of individuals
belonging to a lineage for describing a detailed phylogeny. The study was unable to trace any specific marker for
M2b sub-lineage. In the absence of any lineage specific
marker for M2b till date, it might be suggested that this
sub-lineage is not a distinct clade of M2 lineage but is an
M2 with additional HVSI motif (G16274A, T16357C).
However, more M2b genomes need to be completely
sequenced before reaching this conclusion and though
HVSI sequences are not very reliable for constructing phylogenies, this cluster can well differentiate individuals
with only one or both mutations and in turn resolve the
phylogeny to its finer sub-lineages. M2 lineage is the oldest M lineage found in India with an estimated age of
approximately 50,000 YBP, using only coding region
motifs estimation, opposed to the expansion date of
60,000â75,000 yrs calculated from control region
sequence information [15].
Although the G12007A substitution has been previously
identified in other haplogroups, besides the M lineages
[29], this study presents a novel lineage M30 that was differentiated to include mitochondrial genomes possessing
G12007A substitution. The erection of M30a sub-lineage
with its root at T195A and G15431A may help in further
classifying M* samples that have yet to be identified
owing to the absence of any characteristic HVSI motif.
Mitochondrial genomes possessing the 16223, 16300
motif appear to be a promising new sub-lineage arising
from M30. Additional complete mtDNA sequencing of
similar sub-types may further help in precisely defining
this branch. The M30 lineage was relatively younger than

Page 4 of 8

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:26

the M2 lineage with an expansion age of approximately
33,000 YBP, calculated on the basis of its coding region
sequence information.
An important contribution of this study is placement of
M18, M6 and previously defined M3 and M4 lineages in
the M phylogeny. In the absence of a coding region
marker for M18 lineage [20], G12007A substitution provides a stable root to M18 type, which is defined only on
basis of the HVSI motif A16318T. The recognition of M31
lineage with an A5319G basal transition further reduces
the number of branches arising from the trunk of M lineage. Since M6 is already well characterized, we propose
that it remain as a sub-lineage of M31. However, it is
essential that previously defined M3 and M4 lineages be
completely removed from the phylogeny. Furthermore, it
might be realized that the newly defined M4a lineage [20],
might in fact be a sub-lineage or independent lineage by
itself.
The M phylogenetic tree has largely aided in resolving the
position of M5 lineage. Until recently, transition at
G16129A along with basal motif of M, was used to characterize this lineage [34] and is currently described by the
presence of coding region mutation at T12477C [20]. The
phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of complete mt
DNA genome sequencing provides evidence to support
our finding that at least two sub-lineages arise from M5
that share a transversion at site C10986A and may or may
not possess T12477C transition. Presence of T12477C
transition in only one of the two M5 mt DNA genomes
sharing an identical HVSI motif, C16223T and G16129A,
further substantiates the importance of coding region
markers in precisely identifying mitochondrial phylogenies. Even though G16048A, HVSI motif has not been
included under M5 owing to absence of T12477C, this
study includes this motif under M5 lineage. However,
prior to defining G16048A, G16129A and C16223T cluster, it is imperative that more samples representing this
HVSI motif be completely sequenced. The age of M5 lineage is estimated to be 34,095+/- 6,425 YBP, indicating
that M5 and its sister lineages M30 and M31 probably
branched out from M haplogroup around the same time.
The newly defined M25 lineage did not share mutation
sites with any other lineage and independently arose from
M trunk with G15928A and T16304C substitutions.
The moderately high frequency of C16223T, T16325C
HVSI motif types in Indian samples suggests that there
might be a potential new lineage, which might be more
accurately described once additional genomes possessing
this motif are fully sequenced. In the absence of this
sequence information, no attempt was made to classify
this sequence type in to a lineage and hence, designated as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/26

M*. The other M* lineages bearing the control region
motif, C16223T, T16126C and C16223T, C16251T,
C16267T could not be resolved further for similar
reasons.
Although, this study presents only a preliminary view of
the M phylogeny, yet the emerging data may be highly
useful in resolving the long-standing debate on Asian origin of M macrohaplogroup. Since M macrohaplogroup is
derived from L3, which finds its roots in East Africa, it is
believed that presence of M1 in Ethiopia further substantiates an African origin of M. A similar hypothesis had
been drawn for the U6 lineage that is autochthonous to
North Africa although U haplogroup displays its maximum diversity in Near East [35]. The authors of this study
prepared an in-depth phylogeography of U6 to infer a
back migration of this lineage from West Asia to North
Africa. In the absence of a detailed M1 phylogeny, we have
focused our attention on M2 to estimate the place of split
of M from L3 as Africa or Asia. Interestingly, a single M2
genome differs in its coding region from the root of M at
ten sites as compared to M1, which possess only four substitutions. Also, sub-lineages of M2, M5, M30 and M31
show long branch lengths, highlighting the deep roots of
these lineages. Considering the antiquity of M2 and other
East Asian specific M lineages [33], Ethiopian M1 lineage
is by far a relatively newer branch. Our study on M1 and
M2 mitochondrial genomes clearly established the Asian
origin of M macrohaplogroup, followed by a back migration to Africa. We further suggest that as more M1 mt DNA
genomes are sequenced, there is a possibility that this lineage might find its root in one of the peripheral branches
of Asian M lineage.

Conclusion
This study presents the, first ever, phylogenetic tree constructed for the M lineages predominant in India. The
phylogenetic tree emerged from the present study consists
of seven branches. A significant achievement of this
endeavor is the recognition of M30 and M31 lineages,
which encompass seven and three sub-lineages respectively. While the previously defined lineages, M18 and M6
are now found to be sub-lineages of M30 and M31; our
study suggests the non-existence of M3 and M4 as independent lineages. Thus, the present analysis also determines the roots of few previously undefined mt DNA
genomes, reinforcing the importance of screening lineage
defining coding region substitutions before describing a
lineage. Another significant conclusion emerged from this
study is substantiating the Asian origin hypothesis of M
macrohaplogroup. This study would provide baseline
information for precisely describing the macrohaplogroup M, as more complete mt DNA sequence information is generated. Furthermore, it establishes the
superfluousness of control region diversity reported in the

M macrohaplogroup by suggesting that most of M lineages might in fact be derived from limited basal branches.

Methods
Amplification and sequencing of HVSI and coding region
motifs
Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard Phenol/chloroform method. Amplification and
sequencing of control region were performed in 1258
samples (authors unpublished data) as described in our
earlier studies [36,37]. Samples were initially analyzed for
substitutions at site 10397 and 10400 via RFLP protocol
before characterizing them under M haplogroup and subsequently clustered into different lineages of M via
sequencing of the required coding region fragmentsT447C, T1780C and A8502G for M2, G5252A for M2a,
T12477C for M5, C3539T for M6 and G15928A for M25
[15,20].
Complete mtDNA sequencing
Socio-cultural affiliations of twenty-three individuals
selected for complete sequencing are presented in Table 1.
These mt DNA genomes belonging to M* (n-8), M2 (n-1),
M2a (n-3), M2b (n-1), M3 (n-2), M4 (n-1), M5 (n-3), M6
(n-2), M18 (n-1) and M25 (n-1) sub-lineages of Indian
macrohaplogroup M were completely sequenced in the
current study. DNA amplification and sequencing was carried out using primers described elsewhere [38]. New

group defining substitutions were re-sequenced, and their
frequency was determined in other Indian samples with
similar control region motifs. Each sample was completely sequenced twice to remove any ambiguous sites.
Additionally, since several segments of the same mt DNA
had to be screened, care was taken to avoid artificial
recombination caused by potential crossovers.
Phylogenetic analysis
The sequence information generated by whole mt genome
sequencing of twenty Indian specific M lineages was used
to construct a phylogenetic tree of macrohaplogroup M.
Substitutions were reported with respect to the revised
Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [39]. Only those
mutation sites occurring in all sequenced genomes of a
maternal lineage were placed at the root. The complete
sequence of the Ethiopian M1 genome [25] was included
in the M Phylogenetic tree to determine its relationship
with its sister lineages.
Time estimate
Age estimates for the M lineages were computed using
only coding region substitutions identified from the complete mt DNA genome sequencing. The mean number of
mutations per site to the most recent common ancestor
was estimated and converted to real time using a substitution rate of 1.26 Ã 10-8 per site per year [40].
