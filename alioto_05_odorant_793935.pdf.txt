Abstract
Background: Vertebrate odorant receptors comprise three types of G protein-coupled
receptors: the OR, V1R and V2R receptors. The OR superfamily contains over 1,000 genes in some
mammalian species, representing the largest gene superfamily in the mammalian genome.
Results: To facilitate an informed analysis of OR gene phylogeny, we identified the complete set of
143 OR genes in the zebrafish genome, as well as the OR repertoires in two pufferfish species, fugu
(44 genes) and tetraodon (42 genes). Although the genomes analyzed here contain fewer genes
than in mammalian species, the teleost OR genes can be grouped into a larger number of major
clades, representing greater overall OR diversity in the fish.
Conclusion: Based on the phylogeny of fish and mammalian repertoires, we propose a model for
OR gene evolution in which different ancestral OR genes or gene families were selectively lost or
expanded in different vertebrate lineages. In addition, our calculations of the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous codon substitutions among more recently expanding OR subgroups
in zebrafish implicate residues that may be involved in odorant binding.

Background
The perception and discrimination of thousands of different odorants by the vertebrate olfactory system results
from the activation of specific odorant receptors expressed
by olfactory neurons in the nose. The first odorant receptors were identified in the rat [1] and belong to what is
now referred to as the "OR" superfamily of odorant receptors [2]. ORs exhibit a predicted seven transmembrane
topology and sequence motifs characteristic of the A family (rhodopsin-like or Class I) of G protein-coupled receptors. Subsequent to the initial discovery of the OR
superfamily of odorant receptors, two unrelated types of
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were identified in
the mammalian vomeronasal organ, the V1R receptors [3]

and the V2R receptors [4-7]. The vomeronasal V1R and
V2R receptors are thought to subserve signaling to pheromonal compounds [2].
The OR gene superfamily is the largest multigene superfamily described in mammalian genomes. The completion of both the Celera and public consortium versions of
the mouse genome confirmed the existence of about 1068
potential intact OR genes (comprising at least 228 subfamilies) and 334 pseudogenes [8,9]. In humans, there
are ~340 intact OR genes and ~300 pseudogenes [10-12].
By way of contrast, molecular cloning and genomic DNA
blot hybridizations in fish species suggest an OR reper-

toire size approximately five- to ten-fold smaller than that
of mammalian species [13,14].
An understanding of how vertebrate olfactory receptor
repertoires evolved can be gained from comparing the
properties and organization of genes from divergent vertebrate species. In this regard, the zebrafish, Danio rerio, provides a useful model for comparative genomics studies.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the zebrafish
genome encodes only 1 V1R-like receptor [15] (T.S.A and
J.N., unpublished results) and ~60 olfactory C-family
(Class III) GPCRs related to the mammalian V2R family
(T.S.A., P. Luu, E. VanName, and J.N., manuscript in preparation); one fish olfactory C-family receptor has been
shown to be activated by amino acids [16,17], which are
potent odorants for fish.
In the OR superfamily, approximately 28 genes and 5
pseudogenes were identified previously in zebrafish using
PCR and homology-based techniques [14,18-22].
Although a number of phylogenetic reconstructions have
been made [8,9,18,23-28], a more accurate view of the OR
superfamily's evolutionary history would be facilitated by
comparisons between genomic datasets that include a
more complete representation of member genes from
each species (see also [29]).
For the present study, we carried out genome data mining
on the zebrafish genome sequence provided by the Sanger
Institute Danio rerio Sequencing Project and found 143
potentially intact genes belonging to the zebrafish OR
superfamily. We find that despite the limited size of the
zebrafish OR repertoire, it comprises eight diverse OR
families, with family members sharing on average ~40%
amino acid identity. In addition, OR genes from two pufferfish species – fugu and tetraodon – can be grouped into
six families which overlap with the zebrafish gene families. Analysis of the ratio of possible non-synonymous to
synonymous codon substitutions suggests that OR genes
in general are under negative or purifying selection; only
a small number of residues within the transmembrane
domains – the likely sites of odorant binding – appear to
have undergone positive selection. Based on these findings we propose a model for the evolution of the vertebrate OR repertoire.

Results and discussion
Prediction of zebrafish OR genes
The third (Zv3) and fourth (Zv4) draft zebrafish genome
assemblies
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/
zebrafish/ of whole genome shotgun sequence (5.7 × coverage) were searched for OR gene sequences using a modification of the method described for identifying OR
sequences from the mouse genome [8].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/173

The protein coding sequences of the vast majority of
known OR genes characterized to date are uninterrupted
by introns, which obviates the need for splice site prediction in the identification of most OR genes. Our gene prediction strategy was to combine a low-threshold BLAST
search with profile Hidden Markov Model- (HMM) based
gene prediction with the program Genewise ftp://
ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/wise2/. The Genewise
results were post-processed using custom Perl scripts to
generate complete ORFs. This process was repeated in an
iterative fashion, as follows. The zebrafish genome assembly was subjected to TBLASTN search with a representative
set of known zebrafish ORs (<50% percent identity
among members of this set). The gene prediction program
Genewise was then run on the genomic sequences surrounding each unique BLAST hit using a profile hidden
Markov model (HMM) of the OR superfamily (see Methods for details). In each round, the newly predicted OR
genes were added as queries for the next BLAST search.
They were also aligned to previous members, and a new
profile HMM was constructed for use in the next round of
gene prediction.
Initial query sequences included members of each of the
OR9, OR2, OR5, OR4, and OR13 subfamilies described
previously [18]. Predicted genes were subjected to a set of
criteria for inclusion in the final set of OR genes. First, all
coding sequences were required to be longer than 700
base pairs in length and show highest sequence similarity
to previously characterized OR sequences. To be considered full-length, the deduced amino acid sequence was
required to be greater than 275 amino acids, contain
seven predicted transmembrane domains and exhibit the
presence of a conserved N-linked glycosylation site with
the pattern N-X- [TS]-X (where X is any amino acid residue
except for proline) at the N-terminus. Sequences failing to
meet these criteria and those lacking start or stop codons
due to assembly gaps were considered to be partial genes.
FASTY comparison to known OR peptide sequences was
used to generate conceptual translations of potential
pseudogenes and to determine the number of disruptions
(frame shifts, early stop codons and in-frame deletions).
To compensate for disruptions in OR coding sequences
due to possible sequencing and/or assembly errors, we
adopted a classification system previously proposed for
mining of the mouse genome [8]. In the present study, a
gene was considered intact if it had a complete coding
sequence with up to one disruption, or a pseudogene if it
was either a partial sequence with one or more disruptions or a full-length sequence with two or more disruptions.
Based on these criteria, our search identified 143 intact
OR genes (136 with no disruptions), 7 partial genes, 10
pseudogenes greater than 700 bp in length, and 15 gene

Chromosomal distribution of zebrafish OR genes

Chromosomal distribution of zebrafish OR genes. The majority of OR genes are organized in large clusters at only a few
loci in the zebrafish genome. OR genes are depicted as boxes above (plus strand) or below (minus strand) a line representing

fragments shorter than 700 bp (these shorter fragments
were excluded from further analysis) [see Additional file 2
and Additional file 10]. Thus, we believe our total OR
gene count is a conservative estimate of the true size of the
OR repertoire, with between 78% (136/175) and 86%
([143+7]/175) of identifiable OR sequences consisting of
potentially functional OR genes.
How complete is the predicted OR gene repertoire? To
address this question, we extracted 65 zebrafish OR
sequences (28 non-redundant published OR genes or
cDNAs, 4 unpublished full-length cDNAs, and 33 ESTs)

from Genbank and determined whether or not they were
represented in the set of predicted genes by aligning them
to OR genomic sequence. The 33 ESTs were first consolidated into 23 clusters based on overlapping sequences.
Eight of these corresponded to known genes, while 15
clusters were novel, bringing the non-redundant set of
Genbank genes to 47. Forty-five out of 47 of these
sequences were identified in our search [see Additional
file 10]. The two that we were unable to identify, OR11515 and OR128-14 (an unpublished cDNA that was identified in the more recent Zv5 genome assembly and an EST,
respectively) belong to two of the largest subfamilies in

Phylogeny of zebrafish and other vertebrate OR families
Phylogeny of zebrafish and other vertebrate OR families. (a) Phylogeny of zebrafish receptors. A neighbor joining tree
was constructed based on an alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of 143 intact genes and 4 full-length pseudogenes identified from the zebrafish genome [see Additional file 2]. OR genes are named by subfamily and colored by family. The
eight gene families are labeled A-H. The zebrafish melanocortin receptor branch (dotted line labeled "mcr") indicates the root
of the tree. Bootstrap scores for each family are indicated in parentheses. (b) Phylogenetic relationship among zebrafish and
mouse odorant receptors. The following sets of genes were aligned and used to construct a tree by neighbor joining: the
mouse odorant receptors, mORs [8,9]; the subset of 136 intact zebrafish ORs with no disruptions identified in this study (highlighted in red); and mouse melanocortin receptors (mcr). Note the presence of OR gene subfamilies OR112, OR113, and OR114
(Family A) within the Class I clade and zebrafish OR101-1 (Family B) within the Class II clade. Bootstrap scores corresponding
to selected nodes are indicated.(c) Phylogeny of the complete OR repertoires of zebrafish, fugu and tetraodon identified in this
study. One-hundred-thirty-six non-disrupted genes from zebrafish, 42 non-disrupted genes from fugu, and 42 non-disrupted
genes from tetraodon were used in this neighbor joining analysis. Families are labeled A-H and correspond to the zebrafish
families shown in panel A. Bootstrap scores corresponding to selected nodes are indicated.

the repertoire. Thus, we are confident that the repertoire
of odorant receptors described here includes nearly all of
the OR genes encoded in the zebrafish genome. However,
because some gaps remain in the assembly near several
small receptor gene clusters, we expect that as the genome
sequence is refined, a few additional receptor genes will be
found.
OR nomenclature and classification
OR families are typically defined as monophyletic groups
with members that share greater than 40% amino acid
identity, whereas subfamily members share greater than
60% amino acid identity [30]. Using these operational
definitions, we classified the zebrafish OR genes into families and subfamilies by reconstructing their phylogeny by
neighbor-joining with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Clades
of OR genes with less than ~40% and less than ~60%
inter-branch amino acid identity were used to group genes
into distinct families and subfamilies, respectively. The
average percent identity between families is approximately 25% while the maximum observed percent identity between any two ORs of different families is 39%.

To unify the naming for zebrafish OR genes, we propose a
revised nomenclature based on the following rationale.
Both newly predicted and previously described OR genes
were named (or re-named) according to subfamily membership. Subfamilies were numbered sequentially starting
at the number 101 (to avoid confusion with previous
zebrafish OR nomenclature) in a depth-first traversal of
the phylogenetic tree. Within subfamilies, ORs were numbered sequentially according to genomic position, if
known. The new nomenclature showing subfamily membership and correspondence to previously identified
zebrafish OR genes are shown in Table S1 [see Additional
file 10].
Genomic distribution of zebrafish OR genes
Previous studies have demonstrated that OR genes are
clustered in vertebrate genomes [8,9,18,31,32]. In mammalian genomes, OR genes are distributed widely, residing on 18 chromosomes in the mouse [8] and 21
chromosomes in humans [10,11]. From the zebrafish Zv3
and Zv4 assemblies, we found that 119 of the identified
zebrafish OR genes are distributed in five major clusters
containing between 14 and 31 genes each. There are two
clusters on chromosome 15, two on chromosome 21, one
on chromosome 10, several small clusters on chromosomes 8, 14 and 17, and in a few cases, genes exist as singletons (Figure 1) [see Additional file 10]. Subfamilies are
largely contiguous (see below) and subfamily members
usually share the same transcriptional orientation, suggesting tandem duplication as a mechanism of expansion
within a subfamily [18,33]. We were able to assign

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/173

genomic locations for ~80% of the OR genes we identified
(29 remain unassigned).
Phylogeny of zebrafish OR genes
Using a neighbor joining algorithm (see Methods), we
constructed a phylogenetic tree of the 143 intact OR genes
and 4 full-length pseudogenes identified in the two
zebrafish genome assemblies, using the zebrafish melanocortin receptors as an outgroup (Figure 2a). Based on this
analysis and the criteria set forth above, zebrafish ORs
could be classified into 8 families (≥40% intra-family
sequence identity) and 40 subfamilies (≥60% intra-subfamily sequence identity). An additional thirteen
sequences comprising 7 partial genes and 6 pseudogene
fragments were subsequently assigned to subfamilies
based on their sequence similarities and additional phylogenetic analyses (data not shown). Most of the gene families contain between 12 and 40 genes each; the two
smallest families, Family A and Family B, contain 6 and 1
genes each, respectively. The intra-subfamily identity
threshold was lowered for three subfamilies, OR102,
OR115 and OR125, to generate monophyletic clades [see
Additional file 11]. High bootstrap support (Figure 2a)
justify these classifications, with all subfamilies exhibiting
bootstrap scores of 100%.

The topology of the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 2a
is supported by three additional lines of evidence. First,
we calculated all possible pairwise identities both within
and between different groups of OR sequences. With the
three exceptions noted above for subfamilies OR102,
OR115, and OR125, the minimum percent identity
within each subfamily is ≥ 62% [see Additional file 11].
Importantly, the maximum inter-subfamily identity is
44% [see Additional file 12] and the maximum interfamily identity is 38% [see Additional file 13]; both of
these values are well below the ≥ 62% identity typically
observed between members within a given subfamily.
Thus, the sorting of ORs by neighbor joining analysis into
distinct families and subfamilies is supported by an analysis based on all possible pairwise identities. Second,
highly related OR genes are tightly clustered in the
zebrafish genome, with the members of a given subfamily
residing adjacent to one another, uninterrupted by more
distantly related genes [18,33]. In the present analysis, we
found that the assignment of OR subfamilies by neighbor
joining analysis indeed is consistent with this genomic
organization; out of 23 multigene subfamilies, members
from only five (OR111, OR113, OR126, OR128, and
OR133) are found in genomic clusters interrupted by
genes from other subfamilies (Figure 1) [see Additional
file 10]. Third, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using a
maximum likelihood algorithm; at both the family and
subfamily levels, maximum likelihood analysis yields tree

Table 1: Average pairwise identities between odorant receptor families. Pairwise comparisons were performed between each
member of a family with each member of the family to be compared. The average percent identity was then calculated for all
comparisons between each pair of families. Similar results were obtained for consensus sequences of each family generated from
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of each family. Zebrafish families are labeled A-H according to Figure 2a. The two major groups of
mouse genes are denoted as "Class I" and "Class II." The maximum percent identity between families used to guide family
classification of phylogenetic clades was 40% identity.

Comparison of fish and mammalian OR repertoires
To gain additional insight into how the OR gene superfamily evolved in vertebrates, the zebrafish ORs were
aligned to additional sets of vertebrate OR sequences. OR
genes were predicted from the genome sequences of two
pufferfish species, fugu (Takifugu rubripes) http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/fugu6/[27] and tetraodon (Tetraodon
nigroviridis)
http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/
tetranew/[34], using methods identical to those used for
finding zebrafish ORs. Forty-four (3 with one disruption)
and 42 (6 with one disruption) intact genes were found in
fugu [27,29] and tetraodon, respectively [see Additional
file 3 and Additional file 4]. As the genome sequence data
for these two species represent ~95% and ~92% coverage,
respectively, we expect that the OR genes identified here
comprise the majority of each species' OR repertoire.
Thus, the OR repertoires of both pufferfish species appear
to be only ~one-third the size of the zebrafish repertoire.
A summary of the OR genes identified in zebrafish, fugu,
and tetraodon genomes is provided in Table 2.

Nine-hundred-thirty-five mouse OR sequences [8,9] were
either downloaded from Genbank (864 genes) or
extracted from MGSCv3 using published coordinates (71
genes) [9]. Phylogenetic trees were computed for ORs
from zebrafish and mouse (Figure 2b) [see Additional file
6] and zebrafish, fugu and tetraodon (Figure 2c) [see
Additional file 7]. The location of the melanocortin receptor branch represents the root of each tree.

Mouse ORs can be classified into two groups, Class I and
Class II, each showing on average greater than 40% intragroup sequence identity [8]. Based on their greater similarity to the limited number of fish OR genes identified
prior to the present study, Class I genes from amphibians
and mammals have been referred to as "fish-like"
[8,10,24]. However, our analysis of the complete set of
zebrafish OR genes indicates that this view cannot be generalized to the entire fish OR repertoire. Mammalian Class
I and Class II genes can in fact be grouped more closely
with only two out of eight ~equidistantly-related
zebrafish families; Class I genes show close similarity to
only a small subset of zebrafish OR genes (OR112-1,
OR113-1, OR113-2 and OR114-1, which together comprise Family A), and one zebrafish gene (OR101-1, comprising the single member Family B) clusters together with
mammalian Class II genes (Figure 2b). We base these conclusions on phylogenetic reconstructions as determined
by neighbor joining (Figure 2b) and maximum likelihood
[see Additional file 6], as well as on a separate calculation
of average pairwise identities of genes between families
(Table 1) [see Additional file 13]. In all cases, the alignment of mouse and zebrafish genes was gap-minimized
and trimmed to remove N- and C-terminal tails [see Additional file 2]. Overall, mouse Class I exhibits similar average pairwise identity to the zebrafish families (27.3 ±
4.8% identity [mean ± standard deviation]; range: 17 –
32%) as mouse Class II (27.7 ± 5.5%; range: 18 – 38%);
the difference in mean values is not significant in a twotailed t-test (p = 0.89). Calculations comparing consensus
sequences representing each family yielded similar results
(data not shown).

gene is operationally defined as "intact" if it possesses a full-length
OR protein coding sequence with no more than one disruption. For
each species, the number of genes with a single disruption is listed in
parentheses; the remainder contain no disruptions.
b A sequence encoding ≤ 275 contiguous amino acids, missing specific
features characteristic of ORs (see the text for details), or missing
start or stop codons is classified as a partial gene.
c A sequence is defined as a pseudogene if it is a partial gene with one
or more disruption or a full-length gene with 2 or more disruptions.

A comparison of teleost OR genes further reveals that six
of the eight zebrafish OR families overlap with pufferfish
families; families B and G do not appear to be present in
pufferfish (Figure 2c) [see Additional file 7]. In our phylogeny comparing zebrafish and pufferfish genes by neighbor joining, we find low bootstrap support for Family E
(score = 47), likely reflecting this family's closer proximity
to Family F in the multi-species tree as compared to the
tree generated with zebrafish OR genes alone (however,
Family E has high bootstrap support by maximum likelihood analysis [see Additional file 7]). Interestingly, in
zebrafish the most divergent family (Family H) shows
only 17–19% identity to other families (versus 25–34%
interfamily identity amongst the other families; Table 1).
The location of the outgroup melanocortin receptor
between Family H and the other families supports the
conclusion that this family is the result of a very ancient
gene duplication event. Based on the degree of divergence
from other OR gene families, it is possible that the genes
comprising Family H may not in fact encode bona fide
odorant receptors. However, the predicted zebrafish Family H receptors retain one of the highly conserved OR signature motifs (see below), and one member of this family
(OR137-7) was previously identified as an EST from a
zebrafish olfactory epithelium cDNA library [see Additional file 10]. In addition, when zebrafish Family H
sequences were used in BLAST searches of both the nonredundant protein sequence database and the mouse
genome sequence, previously identified OR sequences
were identified as the closest hits (data not shown). Family H also forms a cluster distinct from non-OR GPCRs in
a phylogenetic tree comprising mouse and zebrafish ORs
together with a set of 199 non-OR Type I (rhodopsin
class) mouse GPCRs [see Additional file 8]. Thus, for the
present purposes we consider the Family H sequences
operationally as OR genes. More generally, this phylogenetic reconstruction based on OR and non-OR GPCRs

reveals that the ORs as a group are distinct from the other
Type I GPCRS.
A similar phylogeny for vertebrate OR genes was recently
described [29]. This study placed zebrafish, fugu, Xenopus
and chicken OR genes into groups roughly comparable to
those described here in Figure 2, with Family A corresponding to these authors' Group β (which clusters
closely with human Class I genes); the single zebrafish
gene comprising Family B falling within Group γ /human
Class II; Family C corresponding to Group ε; Families D
and G corresponding to Group ζ (which is not a monophyletic clade); Families E and F corresponding to Group
δ; and Family H corresponding to Group η. Two highly
divergent groups (not identified or retained in our search)
– termed κ and θ – were also described, although their
identities as OR genes are unclear [29].
Conserved motifs in predicted OR protein sequences
Previous studies of vertebrate ORs have identified a
number of conserved sequence motifs characteristic of
these receptors [8,12,35]. These include the following: an
N-linked glycosylation site NX [TS]X in the N-terminal
domain; the motif MA [FY] [DE]RYVAIC located at the
third transmembrane domain (TM3)/second intracellular
loop (IC2) junction which is thought to interact with Gproteins (specifically Golf); three conserved cysteine residues in the second extracellular loop (EC2) thought to
partake in disulfide bonding; and the motif KAFSTCXSH
in IC3 containing an intracellular cysteine conserved in
GPCRs and potential phosphorylation sites. We found
that these motifs are conserved in all the zebrafish OR
families, with the exception of Family H, in which only
the MAYDRYVAIC motif is conserved. This sequence conservation is illustrated by a sequence logo generated from
the alignment of predicted full-length zebrafish OR coding sequences (Figure 3a). In this representation, the relative frequency with which an amino acid appears at a
given position is reflected by the height of its one-letter
amino acid code in the logo, with the total height at a
given position proportional to the level of sequence conservation. Interestingly, when compared to the sequence
logo representing the alignment of mouse Class I and
Class II ORs (Figure 3b), the zebrafish OR logo shows
lower conservation amongst the predicted zebrafish
receptor sequences (reflected by the more numerous and
shorter letters at individual positions in the logo), revealing the greater diversity within the zebrafish vs. mouse OR
superfamily (Table 1).
Adaptive evolution of OR genes
What evolutionary processes might explain the diversity
of OR gene sequences? This diversity could be the result of
genetic drift, with polymorphisms in the population
being fixed at a rate consistent with the absence of selec-

tive pressure. Alternatively, the sequence diversity could
reflect true functional divergence, perhaps in the ligand
specificities of the encoded receptors. Considering the
diversity of OR proteins encoded in vertebrate genomes
and the even greater diversity of compounds detected by
these receptors, ligand binding sites within ORs may be
expected to be under positive selective pressure as organisms evolve new receptor proteins to recognize odorant
compounds. As for other Type 1 (rhodopsin class) GPCR
ligands, odorants are thought to bind to OR proteins in
the plane of the membrane, in contact with residues in the
transmembrane domains [2]. Consistent with this notion,
previous studies have demonstrated that odorant receptor
genes have been subject to positive selective pressure,
especially in the transmembrane domains thought to
coordinate odorant binding [13,36] (however, see [37]).
We therefore attempted to pinpoint the precise codon
sites – and thus the amino acid residues – that may have
been subjected to positive selection during the evolution
of the zebrafish OR superfamily. To this end, we used the
relative frequency of non-synonymous vs. synonymous
codon substitutions to assess the selective processes acting
on these receptor genes [38]. Where there is no positive or
negative selection on a sequence, the number of non-synonymous changes relative to the number of possible nonsynonymous changes (dN) would be equal to the number
of synonymous changes relative to the number of possible
synonymous changes (dS) – i.e., dN/dS = 1. Significant
deviations of dN/dS from unity reflect selection on the
sequence; a dN/dS ratio > 1 indicates that a region has
undergone positive selection, whereas a dN/dS ratio < 1
indicates negative or "purifying" selection [38]. For our
analysis, we aligned 136 full-length zebrafish OR coding
sequences containing no disruptions and calculated dN/
dS ratios based on a gap-minimized alignment (Table 3
and Figure 4a). We found that when the OR coding
sequence is partitioned broadly into transmembrane
domains (TMs) 1–7 and non-transmembrane domains
(excluding the N- and C-terminal tails), none of these
regions exhibits positive selection. Rather, with average
dN/dS ratios <1, these protein regions all appear to be
under negative or purifying selection. Interestingly, TMs 1,
3, 4, 5, and 6 display significantly higher average dN/dS
ratios than the combined intracellular and extracellular
loops (p < 1 × 103; see Figure 4a). The observation that
these transmembrane domains were in general under less
purifying selection than other regions of the protein is
consistent with the possibility that they may have adapted
to bind different odorants. In contrast, TM2 and TM7 display significantly lower average dN/dS ratios compared to
the complete coding sequence (p < 0.05). The apparently
stronger negative selection on TM2 and TM7 (as compared to the other transmembrane regions) suggests that
these transmembrane domains subserve a common – perhaps
structural
–
role
in
these
receptors.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/173

We hypothesized that specific codon sites corresponding
to odorant-binding residues might have been positively
selected as coding sequences diverged after gene duplication events. Accordingly, identification of these sites
would suggest possible ligand binding sites. We therefore
performed a site-by-site analysis of dN/dS ratios based on
the alignment of the set of 136 full-length intact coding
sequences used above. To avoid a potentially high rate of
false positives common with pooled site methods (see
[39]), we used the more conservative likelihood individual site (IS) method [40] based on the original proposed
IS approach [41]. The phylogenetic relationships between
sequences were determined and a substitution model was
estimated from the data. The ancestral codon sequences at
each node were then reconstructed and the dN and dS values were calculated for each codon site. In Figure 4b, the
probability of being under positive or negative selection
(dN/dS values different than dN/dS = 1.0) for each codon
site is indicated on a snake plot of a representative OR
amino acid sequence, OR124-3 (see also Table 3). By
these criteria, only two sites within the transmembrane
domains (one in TM3 and one in TM4) appear to have
been subjected to positive selection, consistent with the
notion that they may play a role in contacting ligands.
Interestingly, two adjacent sites in the short third extracellular loop (very close to the top of TM6) also exhibit dN/
dS ratios > 1. Overall, our characterization of dN/dS ratios
reveals a striking paucity of sites exhibiting signs of positive selection, possibly reflecting the dominating influence of negative selection throughout the receptor coding
region. Alternatively, since non-synonymous substitutions may occur only sporadically over evolutionary time,
the signatures of less recent substitutions may no longer
be detected by this analysis of the entire zebrafish OR family.
Evolution of the vertebrate OR gene repertoire
The characterization of the complete OR repertoires from
both fish and mammalian species allows an informed
analysis of OR gene evolution in the vertebrate lineage.
One noteworthy feature of our phylogenetic reconstruction is the presence of a group of zebrafish and pufferfish
subfamilies which together form a putative OR family
(Family H) more divergent than the other families are to
each other (Figure 2c and Table 1); based on a BLAST
search of the mouse genome using representative
zebrafish Family H sequences, this family is absent from
the mouse. We hypothesize that the node between this
branch of the tree and the others is the root representing
the most ancient gene duplication event observable in the
teleost lineage. This is supported by the placement at this
node of the melanocortin receptor (outgroup) branch. In
addition, when we aligned five OR sequences from lamprey [25,42] to the teleost ORs, they formed two additional families on either side of the melanocortin receptor

branch, one which is clearly an OR family (more similar
to teleost OR families A-G than to H) and one which
appears as an outgroup (equidistant from all teleost families A-H and more dubious as an OR family) [see Additional file 9]. Since the lamprey diverged before the
teleost/tetrapodon split, these observations provide further support for this node as the root of the tree. It should
be noted, however, that until the lamprey genome has
been fully sequenced, we will only have a partial picture
of the ancestral OR repertoire. We expect that characterization of the entire lamprey OR repertoire will shed light
on
more
ancient
evolutionary
events.
From our analysis of mammalian, teleost and lamprey OR
sequences, we propose the following model for OR gene
evolution in vertebrates. OR genes in present-day vertebrates likely descended from eight ancestral OR genes (or
gene families) that existed at the time of the split between
ray-finned and lobe-finned fish (the ancestors of teleosts
and tetrapods, respectively) approximately 450 million
years ago (mya) [43]. A phylogenetic reconstruction based
on mouse and zebrafish ORs and 199 mouse non-OR
GPCRs [see Additional file 8] indicates that the ORs form
a group distinct from all other Type I GPCRs, possibly
reflecting a very ancient duplication event(s) and/or rapid
divergence of the ORs in the evolution of Type I GPCRs.
Our estimate of ancestral OR gene number is based on the
identification of 8 OR gene families in teleosts, two of
which show somewhat higher similarity to the 2 OR gene
families in mammals. The grouping of zebrafish and pufferfish OR genes into common families indicates that the
gene duplication events that gave rise to the major OR
families probably occurred prior to the speciation of teleosts. In addition, the greater similarities between zebrafish
Family A and mouse Class I, and between zebrafish Family B and mouse Class II infer that the ancestral genes for
these families existed before the tetrapodon/teleost split.
Our model therefore suggests a history during which
ancestral genes or gene families were selectively lost during the evolution of the different vertebrate lineages. Of
the ancestral families, zebrafish retained 8 families, fugu
and tetraodon retained 6 families, and mammals retained
2 families. It should be noted that the low bootstrap score
(47) for Family E in the comparison of zebrafish and pufferfish OR genes (Figure 2c) raises the possibility that Families E and F (which are adjacent to each other in the
teleost phylogenetic tree) may have arisen from a more
recent duplication in the teleost lineage. Alternatively, the
genes in these groups may have been subjected to gene
conversion events, with the effect of homogenizing the
sequences between these two families.
It is also possible that the 4–6 gene families unique to teleosts descended from Family A/Class I and/or Family B/
Class II ancestral genes, after the tetrapodon/teleost split.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/173

Such a scenario seems unlikely, however, considering the
roughly equivalent degree of divergence exhibited
between 7 out of the 8 teleost gene families (including
Families A and B). Moreover, amphibian and avian OR
genes can be grouped into 6 out of the 8 identified OR
families (Families A, B/Class II, C, E, F and H), further
implicating the presence of common ancestral genes for
these families prior to the tetrapodon/teleost split [29].
Mechanisms of gene or family loss in a particular vertebrate lineage may have involved a number of processes,
for example, gene conversion, pseudogenization of all
genes in a family, unequal crossover recombination
events during meiosis, or larger chromosomal rearrangements. From the available data we cannot infer the precise
order and rate of OR gene family expansion and contraction, or speciation events. Nonetheless, six of the retained
OR gene families were subject to a substantial net expansion and diversification in zebrafish (and to a lesser
degree in the pufferfish), while the other two ancestors
gave rise to the present-day mammalian Class I and Class
II ORs as well as a small number of zebrafish genes. We
hypothesize that relaxed selective pressure on a subset of
the ancestral tetrapodon OR repertoire led to the loss of
major OR gene families in the mammalian lineage. The
expansion within the two remaining gene families was
likely driven by the adaptation to the terrestrial odorous
environment. Thus, different selective pressures found in
the aquatic and terrestrial environments led to different
sizes and shapes of the OR repertoires of fish and mammals.
It is generally thought that the diversity of OR sequences
– as represented in the number of receptor families –
underlies the diversity of chemical structures or "odor
space" that can be detected by an organism's olfactory system. Thus, with ~6–8 OR gene families retained over evolutionary time (vs. 2 in mammals), fish may be capable of
detecting a larger diversity of chemical structures than
mammals. However, the larger total number of OR
sequences in mammals (~1,000 vs. ~100 in fish) presumably allows a finer discrimination amongst the compounds that are detected by the mammalian olfactory
system.

Methods
Iterative data mining
Genome-wide searches of the third (Zv3) and fourth
(Zv4) draft zebrafish genome assemblies ftp://
ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/ made available
by the Sanger Center on Nov 27, 2003, and July 12, 2004,
respectively, were performed several times using the predicted ORs from each previous round to increase our querying power. This iterative data-mining approach has been
published for finding OR genes in the mouse genome [8].

a The mean ratios of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) were
calculated for each transmembrane region, the aggregate of the non-transmembrane regions, as well as the entire OR coding sequence. dN/dS ratios
were calculated only for pairwise comparisons in which mutational saturation had not been reached. A constant set of 262 informative pairs was
used for all calculations.
b Probabilities that the average dN/dS ratio for the particular TM domain is no different than the average for the entire CDS or the non-TM
domains, using a two-tailed t test.
c Number of sites with probabilities greater than 0.9 (p < 0.1) of being positively or negatively selected for each domain. Ancestral sequences were
reconstructed, and at every non-constant site, dN and dS were calculated. If dN < (or >) dS, a p-value derived from a two-tailed binomial
distribution was used to assess significance.

A detailed description of our protocol is provided in the
Supplement [see Additional file 1].
Alignment and tree construction
For multiple alignments of OR genes, ClustalX 1.81 [44]
was used with default parameters and gaps were inspected
manually and edited in xced http://www.biophys.kyotou.ac.jp/~katoh/programs/align/xced/ to ensure integrity
of transmembrane domains and proper alignment of
anchoring OR motifs. N- and C-terminal tails were
trimmed for all alignments. The neighbor-joining algorithm as implemented by PFAAT http://pfaat.source
forge.net/ was used to generate unrooted phylogenetic
trees from these alignments using the BLOSUM 50 similarity matrix; positions with greater than 40% gaps were
excluded. One thousand bootstraps were performed to
assess the support at each tree node. Trees were visualized
with
unrooted
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/
njplot.html[45]. Maximum likelihood analysis was carried out using PHYML http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/[46]
on the same processed amino acid alignments described
above. Bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates was carried
out using the JTT model of amino acid substitution. The
consensus tree including bootstrap support for each node
was plotted for each dataset using either ATV http://
www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/atv/[47] or unrooted.

The sequences used for comparison to the zebrafish OR
genes were obtained from Genbank and included the set
of intact MORs [Genbank: AY072961] – [Genbank:
AY074256] [8] plus 71 newly identified OR genes
extracted from MGSCv3 using coordinates from the
online supplement to [9], 5 full-length lamprey OR receptors [Genbank: AAC82383, Genbank: AAC82384, Genbank: AAC82385, Genbank: CAA10135, Genbank:
CAA10136]. [25], the zebrafish melanocortin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5a
and 5b receptors [Genbank: NP_851301.1, Genbank:

NP_851302.1, Genbank: NP_851303.1, Genbank:
NP_775385.1, Genbank: NP_775386.1, Genbank:
NP_775387.1], and 199 mouse non-OR Class A GPCRs
extracted from the GPCRDB http://www.gpcr.org/. Fugu
and tetraodon OR sequences were predicted from the current genome assemblies [27,34] using the methods
described above for zebrafish.
For the calculation of percent identities, mouse and
zebrafish amino acid sequences were multiply aligned
and trimmed of their N- and C-terminal tails as described
above. Calculations of average, minimum and maximum
intra-family, inter-family, intra-subfamily and inter-subfamily percent identities were based on percent identities
calculated for all pairs of amino acid sequences in this
multiple alignment.
dN/dS analysis
The dN/dS ratios for multi-codon regions (i.e. individual
transmembrane domains or loop regions) of the odorant
receptor coding sequence were determined using previously published methods [38]. To make inferences about
selective pressure (positive and negative selection) on
individual codons (sites) within the coding sequence of
the zebrafish OR genes, the Single Likelihood Ancestor
Counting (SLAC) package http://www.datamonkey.org,
which implements the Suzuki-Gojobori method [41], was
used. Details regarding both of these methods are provided in the Supplement [see Additional file 1].
Genbank accession numbers
All sequences described in this study have been deposited
in Genbank under accession numbers [Genbank:
DQ305986] – [Genbank: DQ306145] (zebrafish), [Genbank:DQ306146] – [Genbank: DQ306202] (tetraodon),
and [Genbank:DQ306203] – [Genbank: DQ306259]
(fugu).

Sites under positive and negative selection in OR coding sequences
Sites under positive and negative selection in OR coding sequences. Nucleotide alignments were generated from the
corresponding amino acid alignment [see Additional file 2] after removal of N- and C-terminal sequences and gap removal with
respect to OR124-3, and subjected to two analyses of selective pressure. (a) Analysis of dN/dS ratios by sub-regions of OR
coding sequences indicates that OR genes in general are under negative or purifying selection (dN/dS < 1). However, analysis
of informative pairwise comparisons reveals that transmembrane domains (TMs) 3–6, and to a lesser degree TM1, have significantly higher average pairwise dN/dS ratios when compared with the average for non-transmembrane coding sequence (asterisks; p < 1 × 10-3). Error bars show standard errors of the means. (b) A schematic representation of OR124-3 (an example
OR) with transmembrane domains one through seven shown from left to right. SLAC analysis reveals sites under positive
selection (dN/dS > 1) with p < 0.1 (red), p < 0.2 (orange), p < 0.5 (yellow), and sites under negative selection (dN/dS < 1) with
p < 0.05 (dark blue), p < 0.1 (light blue), p < 0.2 (turquoise), p < 0.5 (green). The null hypothesis is that a site is neutrally evolving with dN/dS = 1. Yellow and green residues may be considered neutrally evolving. Sites on the representative OR124-3
sequence with dN/dS > 1 and p < 0.1 are: V108 (dN/dS = 1.39), F145 (dN/dS = 1.52), E261 (dN/dS = 1.48) and T262 (dN/dS =
1.42). Snake plot generated using the RbDe web service [48].
