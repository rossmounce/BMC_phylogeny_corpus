Abstract
Background: Most asexual eukaryotic lineages have arisen recently from sexual ancestors and
contain few ecologically distinct species, providing evidence for long-term advantages of sex.
Ancient asexual lineages provide rare exceptions to this rule and so can yield valuable information
relating to the evolutionary forces underlying the maintenance of sex. Microsporidia are parasitic,
unicellular fungi. They include many asexual species which have traditionally been grouped together
into large, presumably ancient taxonomic groups. However, these putative ancient asexual lineages
have been identified on the basis of morphology, life cycles and small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S
rRNA) gene sequences, all of which hold questionable value in accurately inferring phylogenetic
relationships among microsporidia.
Results: The hypothesis of a single, ancient loss of sex within the Nosema/Vairimorpha group of
microsporidia was tested using phylogenetic analyses based on alignments of rRNA and RPB1 gene
sequences from sexual and asexual species. Neither set of gene trees supported ancient asexuality,
instead indicating at least two, recent losses of sex.
Conclusion: Sex has been lost on multiple, independent occasions within the Nosema/Vairimorpha
group of microsporidia and there is no evidence for ancient asexual lineages. It appears therefore
that sex confers important long-term advantages even upon highly simplified eukaryotes such as
microsporidia. The rapid evolution of microsporidian life cycles indicated by this study also suggests
that even closely related microsporidia cannot be assumed to have similar life cycles and the life
cycle of each newly discovered species must therefore be completely described. These findings are
relevant to the use of microsporidia as biological control agents, since several species under
consideration as potential agents have life cycles that have been incompletely described.

Background
Unravelling the interplay of forces that underlie the evolution of sex in eukaryotes remains one of the most elusive
goals of evolutionary biology. Sexual reproduction entails
considerable short-term costs in comparison with asexual
reproduction, yet most eukaryotic organisms remain
capable of sex. A large number of competing hypotheses
have been proposed to explain this phenomenon (see [1-

5] for reviews), all of which postulate long-term selective
advantage of sex over asex. The hypothesis that sex has
long-term benefits coupled with short-term costs has also
been used to explain the observation that most asexual
eukaryotic lineages are of recent origin and contain relatively few species [6]. This general pattern has been
observed so frequently among animals and plants that

ancient asexual lineages containing ecologically diverse
species are regarded as highly exceptional [7].
Unlike plants and animals, most sexual fungi are isogamous and so do not suffer from the "two-fold cost" of producing male gametes that do not contribute resources to
the offspring [8]. All sexual fungi are also able to reproduce asexually, allowing the direct cost of sexual reproduction to be minimised by engaging in sex only when
conditions are optimal [9]. Furthermore, experiments
have demonstrated that sexual strains of the yeast Saccaromyces cerevisiae are able to out-compete asexual strains
under a range of environmental conditions [10,11]. Given
the demonstrable benefits and apparently low costs of sex
in fungi, one might reasonably predict that fungi should
demonstrate a high incidence of sexuality. Indeed population genetics studies using molecular markers have
revealed genetic signatures of sex in most fungal species
that have been tested, several of which were previously
thought to be asexual [12]. However, ancient asexual lineages also exist among the fungi. In the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, an ancient and diverse group of plant
symbionts, ancient asexuality was indicated by the relaxation of concerted evolution acting upon multi-copy ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes [13,14].
The existence of ancient asexual lineages has also been
implied in the microsporidia, a diverse group of intracellular fungal parasites that infect a wide range of vertebrate
and invertebrate animal hosts. Some of the most intensively studied microsporidia belong to the genus Nosema,
parasites of arthropods that have attracted attention both
as causes of disease in honey bees and silk moths and as
potential biological control agents for insect pests. Microsporidian life cycles typically involve the alternation of
diplokaryotic (binucleate, diploid) stages and monokaryotic (uninucleate, haploid) stages (Figures 1 and 2). Members of the genus Nosema appear to have lost the
monokaryotic cycle, remaining diploid throughout their
life cycles, and are therefore considered to be asexual.
Molecular evidence supporting asexuality in Nosema has
been provided by variable rRNA gene sequences amplified
from single spores of N. bombi [15], indicating relaxation
of concerted evolution, a finding similar to that supporting asexuality in the AM fungi [13]. Nosema contains over
100 described species, with several new species added
every year, and its host range spans the Arthropoda,
including insects, arachnids and crustaceans. Furthermore, many of the physiological interactions between
Nosema parasites and their hosts are complex and hostspecific, indicating a high degree of host-parasite coevolution. These include many incidences of transovarial transmission [16] and, most dramatically, the feminization of
genetically male crustacean hosts by the parasite N. granulosis [17]. Given the assumption of ancient asexuality

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/48

within Nosema, the high level of species diversity and high
degree of host-specialisation within this genus presents a
major challenge to the doctrine of limited evolution
within asexual eukaryotic lineages.
Morphologically based taxonomies of the microsporidia
have generally assumed that changes of life cycle, such as
the loss of the monokaryotic cycle, correspond to major
evolutionary transitions [18-21]. It was on this basis that
all microsporidian species that remained diplokaryotic
throughout their life cycles and lacked a sporophorous
vesicle were placed within Nosema [19]. Recently, the taxonomy of Nosema has been extensively revised on the
basis of phylogenetic analyses using the sequence of the
small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene. These
molecular phylogenies have shown "Nosema" species scattered widely throughout the Phylum Microspora [22],
suggesting that the monokaryotic cycle has been lost on
many separate occasions. On the basis of 16S rRNA phylogenies, several microsporidian species have been transferred from Nosema to newly created genera (e.g.
Antonospora locustae, Paranosema grylli, Brachiola algerae),
while several species formerly assigned to the genus Vairimorpha (including Vairimorpha's type species, V. necatrix)
have been tentatively placed within Nosema [23]. Following the notation of Baker et al. [23], I will henceforth refer
to the monophyletic group containing the Nosema type
species N. bombycis and the Vairimorpha type species V.
necatrix as Nosema/Vairimorpha. Most of the "Vairimorpha"
species within this group possess complete sexual life
cycles, with alternating monokaryotic and diplokaryotic
stages. The exception is V. imperfecta, in which meiosis is
followed by an abortive monokaryotic sporogony, indicating an intermediate phase in the loss of sex [24]. The
presence of these sexual species within Nosema/Vairimorpha suggests that the sexual, monokaryotic cycle has been
lost since the origin of the genus, perhaps on several separate occasions.
Phylogenetic analyses based solely upon 16S rRNA
sequences are, however, of limited use when comparing
closely related microsporidian species. This is because the
microsporidian small ribosomal RNA subunit is substantially shorter than those of other fungi and lacks many of
the more variable regions [25-27]. In fact, both the small
and large ribosomal RNA subunits of microsporidia are
even shorter than those of most prokaryotes and consist
of little more than a core of highly conserved sequences.
Consequently, microsporidian 16S rRNA sequence alignments rarely contain sufficient phylogenetically informative sites to unambiguously assign a topology to trees
consisting of closely related species [24,28-30]. However,
despite their short length and low sequence variability,
the rRNA genes of Nosema/Vairimorpha vary exceptionally
in the order in which they occur within the ribosomal

cycle. In V. imperfecta monokaryotic sporogony is aborted at stage 9. Asexual lepidopteran Nosema species such as N. bombycis

repeat unit. In non-microsporidian fungi, and most other
eukaryotes, the order of rRNA genes from 5' to 3' is 18S,
5.8S, 25S, with internal transcribed spacers between the
18S and 5.8S subunit genes (ITS1) and between the 5.8S
and 25S subunit genes (ITS2) (Figure 3a). In the Nosema
species N. apis [31] and N. bombi [15] and in all known
non-Nosema microsporidian species [32-36] the 18S subunit is reduced in size to 16S, the 5.8S and 25S subunit

genes are reduced and the ITS2 spacer is absent, producing
the gene order 5'-16S, 18S-3' (Figure 3b). In N. bombycis
an additional rearrangement has occurred, placing the
18S subunit gene upstream of the 16S subunit gene [37].
A 5S subunit is also positioned downstream of the 16S
subunit of N. bombycis to give the order 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3'
(Figure 3c) [37]. This deviates from the arrangement seen
in the model microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi, in

Hyalinocysta and Parathelohania species, monokaryotic meiospores infect an intermediate host. Monokaryotic mitospores
released by the intermediate host then infect the determinate host, where they differentiate into gametes and undergo plasmogamy to form diplokaryotic cells. In Edhazardia aedis and Culicosporella lunata, meiosis is abortive and any meiospores produced are non-functional while in Culicospora magna, meiosis is completely absent. E. aedis and C. magna produce monokaryotic
mitospores by nuclear dissociation, eliminating meiosis. These monokaryotic spores are functionally equivalent to the spores
produced by the intermediate host of Amblyospora, capable of infecting the determinate host and of undergoing gametogenesis
and plasmogamy. In C. lunata, diplokaryotic mitospores are produced for horizontal transmission between larval hosts, eliminating both gametogenesis and plasmogamy.

which no 5S subunits occur in the vicinity of the larger
ribosomal repeat unit [38]. The unusual ribosomal subunit gene order demonstrated by N. bombycis also occurs in
N. spodopterae [39], N. plutellae (direct submission to Genbank: AY960987) and N. antheraeae [40], which, like N.
bombycis, are parasites of Lepidoptera and which fall close
to N. bombycis in phylogenetic trees based on the 16S
rRNA gene sequence [29]. Nosema/Vairimorpha species
possess multiple copies of the ribosomal RNA repeat unit
which can show intragenomic variation in sequence
[15,31] and some isolates of N. bombycis also possess fragmented copies of rRNA genes (Figure 3d, e) [41] which are
transcriptionally active and coexist with intact rRNA copies within the same genome. The fact that, within Nosema/
Vairimorpha, the rRNA repeat unit exists in multiple copies
with intragenomic variation in gene order, integrity and
sequence is a potential source of confusion in phylogenies
based entirely upon 16S rRNA gene sequences.
In order to improve the resolution of the Nosema rRNA
gene phylogeny, the 18S rRNA gene was sequenced from
a representative group of sexual and asexual species to
produce an alignment including both 16S and 18S rRNA
gene sequences. As an independent test of the phylogeny
indicated by the rRNA genes, the largest subunit of the single-copy protein coding gene RNA polymerase II (RPB1)
was also sequenced from each of the Nosema/Vairimorpha
species. These two phylogenetic analyses supported
incompatible hypotheses for speciation within Nosema,
casting doubt upon the reliability of the rRNA gene
sequence phylogeny. However, both phylogenetic
hypotheses supported multiple, independent losses of sex
within the Nosema genus. The implications of these results
are discussed with regard to the evolution and maintenance of sex in microsporidia and to the evaluation of
microsporidia as agents of biological control.

Results
rRNA Phylogeny
In order to improve the resolution of the Nosema/Vairimorpha rRNA phylogeny, both the 16S and 18S ribosomal
genes were sequenced from a representative group of two
sexual and five asexual Nosema/Vairimorpha species,
including parasites of insect and crustacean hosts. To
these were added six published sequences, obtained from
Genbank (See Additional File 1). Phylogenetic analysis of
the resulting DNA sequence alignment using maximum
likelihood and Bayesian inference yielded identical consensus trees, both of which supported a phylogeny in
which Nosema/Vairimorpha is divided into two well-supported clades (Figure 4). These two major clades correspond to the two different rRNA gene orders found within
Nosema/Vairimorpha. Sexual species occur within both
clades, indicating at least two independent losses of sex.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/48

RPB1 Phylogeny
RPB1 occurs as a single copy in V. necatrix with a length of
1,606 codons (4818 bp), uninterrupted by introns [42]. A
1979 bp fragment of the RPB1 gene was sequenced from
a representative group of two sexual and six asexual
Nosema/Vairimorpha species, including parasites of insect
and crustacean hosts. To these was added the published
sequence of N. tyriae, obtained from Genbank (See Additional File 1). Phylogenetic analysis of the resulting DNA
sequence alignment using maximum likelihood and
Bayesian inference yielded identical consensus trees (figure 5). The topology of this RPB1 gene tree was incongruent with that of the consensus rRNA tree, indicating no
correspondence between rRNA gene order and RPB1 gene
sequence. However, despite its incongruence with the
rRNA tree, the topology of the consensus RPB1 tree still
indicated at least two independent losses of sex.
Hypothesis Testing
Approximately unbiased (AU) and weighted ShimodairaHasegawa (WSH) tests [43,44] were performed upon the
rRNA and RPB1 alignments in order to compare the likelihoods of three different phylogenetic hypotheses for
Nosema/Vairimorpha speciation. This was accomplished
by comparing trees generated according to maximum likelihood criteria, under topological constraints corresponding to a priori hypotheses of 1) host-parasite co-speciation
(insect parasites are monophyletic), 2) ancient asexuality
(asexual species are monophyletic), 3) a single fixation of
the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' gene order (species with the 5'-18S,
16S, 5S-3' gene order are monophyletic) (Figure 6).
Results of the tests are given in table 1.

The constrained rRNA tree produced by the hypothesis of
a single change in rRNA gene order was completely congruent with the maximum likelihood rRNA consensus
tree (Figure 4). The comparison of constrained rRNA trees
indicated that the hypothesis of a single change in gene
order was significantly more likely to reflect the true phylogeny than either the ancient asexuality hypothesis or the
host-parasite co-speciation hypothesis (Table 1). In contrast, the comparison of constrained RPB1 trees indicated
that the host-parasite co-speciation hypothesis was significantly more likely to reflect the true phylogeny than
either the ancient asexuality hypothesis or the hypothesis
of a single change in gene order. The host-parasite co-evolution tree and the maximum likelihood consensus tree
were incongruent only with regard to the position of the
crustacean parasite N. granulosis, which was weakly supported in the consensus tree. Both sets of gene trees indicated that the hypothesis of ancient asexuality was the
least likely of the three alternative hypotheses (Table 1).

3E show the fragmented 16S rRNA genes discovered in N. bombycis by Iiyama et al. [41].

Discussion
Incongruence of rRNA and RPB1 Phylogenies
The consensus phylogenetic trees produced for the rRNA
and RPB1 genes of Nosema/Vairimorpha are clearly incongruent. The RPB1 tree tentatively supports monophyly of
the insect parasites and thereby supports the prediction
that parasites should co-speciate with their hosts, especially in the case of parasites such as Nosema/Vairimorpha
in which the relationship between host and parasite is
very intimate [45]. In contrast, the rRNA tree indicates
paraphyly for the insect parasites, with the crustacean and
hemipteran parasites forming a sister clade to the lepidopteran group containing N. bombycis. These odd bedfellows
share the unusual 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' gene order and so the
rRNA tree appears to support a single origin for this gene
order. However, this conclusion requires the dubious
assumption that the sequences of rRNA genes are independent of the rRNA gene order.

The Nosema/Vairimorpha rRNA repeat unit occurs as multiple copies [15,31] and there is evidence for intragenomic
variation in the sequence of the rRNA genes, indicating
relatively low levels of concerted evolution [15,41]. It is
therefore possible that rRNA repeat units with both gene
orders coexisted in the Nosema/Vairimorpha genome for
some time. If the genome of the common ancestor of
Nosema/Vairimorpha contained some rRNA repeat units
with the 5'-18S,16S,5S-3' gene order and others with the
5'-16S, 18S-3' gene order, it would have been possible for
the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' gene order to have been lost or fixed
on several independent occasions within the genomes of
different Nosema/Vairimorpha species (Figure 7). Nucleotide substitutions that occurred after the rearrangement
that produced the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' gene order but before
speciation from the common ancestor would, in this case,
be shared across species by all 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' rRNA
repeat units. Such shared nucleotide polymorphisms

would then be fixed or lost along with the gene order with
which they were associated. Under this scenario, Nosema/
Vairimorpha phylogenies based upon the rRNA sequence
would falsely support monophyly of all species sharing
the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' gene order. In contrast, RPB1 is a single-copy gene and so its phylogeny is not likely to have
been confused by the presence of different copies with different evolutionary histories.
Multiple Losses of Sex within Nosema/Vairimorpha
Despite the differences in topology between the rRNA and
RPB1 phylogenies, Shimodaira-Hasegawa and KishinoHasegawa tests of both phylogenies conclusively rejected
monophyly of the asexual Nosema/Vairimorpha species.
The closest phylogenetic group to Nosema/Vairimorpha
(according to 16S rRNA trees) contains three species of

microsporidian parasites of freshwater crayfish, erroneously placed within the genus Thelohania [46-48]. The life
cycles of all three "Thelohania" species are similar to that
of V. necatrix and V. cheracis (Figure 1), containing both
monokaryotic and diplokaryotic phases, with evidence of
meiosis. This suggests that the most recent common
ancestor of Nosema/Vairimorpha and the "Thelohania" parasites of crayfish was sexual and that the monokaryotic
cycle, and hence the capacity for sexual reproduction, was
lost on at least two occasions within the Nosema/Vairimorpha group. It can therefore be concluded that Nosema/Vairimorpha is not an ancient asexual lineage but consists of a
core of sexual species that have repeatedly given rise to
asexual clones. This situation is not uncommon among
the fungi [49]. Many asexual strains of otherwise sexual
fungal species have been isolated from environmental

16S, 5S-3' gene order are constrained to be monophyletic.

and medical sources [50,51] and laboratory studies have
demonstrated that the capability for sexual reproduction
can be rapidly eroded when fungi are constrained to
reproduce asexually [52]. When the loss of sex occurs due
to the deletion or inactivation of genes necessary for meiosis or sexual interactions, reversion to sex is considered
to be unlikely [7] since this would generally require multiple, specific back-mutations.
The phylogenetic group including the crayfish "Thelohania" and Nosema/Vairimorpha is one of only three microsporidian groups in which the production of sexual
meiospores has been described in detail. The others are
the dipteran parasites of the family Amblyosporidae [53]

and the "Thelohania" parasites of Solenopsis ants [54].
According to 16S rRNA trees, the sexual "Thelohania" parasites of ants are phylogenetically distant both from the
true Thelohania and from the false "Thelohania" of crayfish
but form a close sister group to the asexual microsporidia
of the genus Anncaliia [55] indicating that members of the
latter genus may also have recently abandoned sex.
Within the Amblyosporidae, life cycle evolution also
appears to have followed a very similar pattern to that
within Nosema/Vairimorpha, with 16S rRNA trees indicating independent losses of the sexual cycle in the species
Edhazardia aedis, Culicospora magna and Culicosporella
lunata [56]. Like V. imperfecta, E. aedis and C. lunata
undergo abortive meiotic sporogony, suggesting relatively

Values of Ka/Ks considerably lower than 1 indicate relatively low levels of sequence polymorphism at non-synonymous sites, an indicator of strong
purifying selection and hence of gene activity. The sequence of V. cheracis is too divergent from that of V. necatrix for Ka/Ks cannot be calculated, so
an additional comparison is performed between V. cheracis and N. empoascae.

recent loss of the sexual cycle. Frequent losses of the sexual
cycle therefore appear to be common to several microsporidian groups.

otic cycle may have been due to selection against the production of resistant spores rather than selection against
sex.

Why give up sex?
For obligate parasites such as the microsporidia sex has
the potential to increase the efficiency of directional selection upon the parasite and hence the speed with which the
parasite can adapt to overcome the resistance of its host
[49,57]. Furthermore microsporidia are isogamous and
are therefore unaffected by the "two-fold cost" of sex.
Given these apparent advantages of the sexual cycle it is,
perhaps, surprising that its loss appears to have occurred
so frequently among the microsporidia. However, sex can
carry additional costs arising from the production of gametes and the process of fertilisation. Nosema/Vairimorpha
may be particularly affected by such costs because many
species rely on efficient vertical transmission from female
hosts to their offspring. Any additional energy costs
incurred by sexual reproduction are passed on to the host,
reducing its survival and/or fecundity and hence reducing
vertical transmission of the parasite [58].

Where the monokaryotic phase of the life cycle involves
an intermediate host, as occurs in the Amblyosporidae
[61] (Figure 2b), the absence or poor availability of this
host might also select against the production of
monokaryotic stages and hence against sex. The fate of
meiospores produced by V. necatrix and other sexual
Nosema/Vairimorpha species has never been documented
and it is not known whether transmission is direct or
involves an intermediate host. Similarly, the fate of
meiospores is known in neither the crustacean Thelohania
species nor the ant "Thelohania" species, leading to speculation that these sexual microsporidian groups might also
use intermediate hosts [54,62]. If sexuality tends to be
intimately associated with a multi-host life cycle in microsporidia then the loss of sex might occur as a by-product
of the elimination of an intermediate host from the life
cycle.

The situation is further complicated by the fact that the
monokaryotic stages of sexual microsporidia perform
other functions in addition to sex. Selection to retain
monokaryotic stages of the life cycle may not, therefore,
correspond directly to selection for the maintenance of
sex. For example, meiospores produced by the sexual species V. necatrix and V. plodiae are very resistant to degradation in the extracellular environment. Production of
meiospores in these species increases markedly at low
temperatures [59,60], suggesting that meiospores may
function as an overwintering stage, allowing the parasite
to survive while active hosts are unavailable. In contrast,
asexual Nosema parasites of Lepidoptera do not produce
resistant meiospores but overwinter within the eggs,
pupae or adults of the host and are vertically transmitted
to the next generation. In this case, loss of the monokary-

Implications for Biological Control and Pest Management
In view of their status as pests and their potential for use
in biological control, it is important to understand the
sexual cycles of Nosema/Vairimorpha species and of microsporidia in general. There are now several documented
cases of microsporidia being accidentally introduced to
new geographical areas along with their hosts [63] and
further, deliberate, introductions are contemplated for the
purpose of biological control. Several of the proposed
introductions involve sexual microsporidian species such
as V. necatrix, V. lymantriae and T. solenopsis [64]. These
examples are particularly worrying because the fate of the
meiospores of these species is unknown. Previous studies
have investigated the host range of microsporidian isolates with regard only to their determinate hosts [65,66].
There are, however, close similarities in meiospore production between Amblyospora, Vairimorpha and Thelohania.

Page 11 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:48

The possibility that meiospores of the latter two genera
might, like those of Amblyospora, infect non-target intermediate hosts needs, therefore, to be taken into consideration by proponents of their use in biological control. The
potential for introduced microsporidian species to
hybridise with native species and the effects that such gene
flow would have upon the host range and pathogenicity
of these organisms also requires consideration. This is particularly relevant with regard to the introduction of V. necatrix to Europe, where there exist many native Nosema/
Vairimorpha species, including pests such as N. apis and
parasites such as N. bombi that infect threatened insect
species [67]. In order to conduct appropriate experiments
to investigate these issues, a more detailed understanding
of the sexual phase of microsporidian life cycles is
urgently required, including knowledge of mating types
and intermediate hosts.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that sex has been lost
within the genus Nosema/Vairimorpha on at least two separate occasions. It is therefore concluded that that this
genus does not constitute or include an ancient asexual
lineage. Instead, the evidence presented here suggests that
the many asexual Nosema/Vairimorpha species have
evolved recently from sexual ancestors.
There is currently a trend towards describing new microsporidian species on the basis of incomplete life cycle data
or even solely on the basis of their 16S rRNA sequences.
The evidence presented here indicates that the life cycles
of Nosema/Vairimorpha species can evolve very rapidly relative to evolution at the molecular level. This means that
a newly discovered species will not necessarily share life
cycle characteristics with a model species, even if their
DNA sequences are extremely similar. The evidence presented here also suggests that rRNA sequences are unreliable indicators of the phylogenetic relationships of closely
related species and so the phylogenetic information
yielded by comparison of rRNA sequences is of limited
value. On this basis, it is proposed that taxonomic
descriptions of microsporidian species should describe
every stage of the life cycle and should include molecular
phylogenetic information based on the sequences of several genes.
The finding that life cycle reduction through the loss of sex
has occurred on multiple occasions both in Nosema/Vairimorpha and in the Amblyosporidae has important implications for the way in which life cycle evolution within the
microsporidia, and within the fungi in general, is viewed.
The majority of described Nosema/Vairimorpha species
possess a reduced, asexual life cycle and so description of
the genus on the basis of one or a few species might have
indicated that the entire group was asexual. Many puta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/48

tively asexual groups of microsporidia and other fungi are
described on the basis of one or a few species. It is therefore possible that their life cycles are truncated versions of
the life cycles of recent, sexual ancestors, sexual descendents of which have yet to be described.

Methods
Species used and nucleic acid extraction
Complete ribosomal repeat unit sequences, including
both the 16S and the 18S rRNA genes, are published for
nine Nosema/Vairimorpha species. All of these were parasites of Lepidoptera or Hymenoptera and all are asexual
(See Additional File 1). The only Nosema/Vairimorpha species for which RPB1 sequences are published are V. necatrix and N. tyriae, both of which are parasites of
Lepidoptera. In order to include species from a more representative range of hosts and to include multiple sexual
species, the complete ribosomal repeat unit and a fragment of the RPB1 gene were sequenced from the crustacean parasites N. granulosis and V. cheracis, from the
hemipteran parasite N. empoascae, from the lepidopteran
parasites N. bombycis, N. trichoplusiae and V. necatrix and
from the hymenopteran parasite N. apis. The genomic
DNA of N. granulosis, N. apis, N. empoascae, V. cheracis and
V. necatrix were extracted from infected tissue samples
stored in ethanol. The genomic DNA of N. bombycis and
N. trichoplusiae was extracted from purified spores stored
in ethanol. Genomic DNA extraction was performed
using Qiagen's DNeasy® DNA purification kit, according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Determination of rRNA gene order, amplification and
sequencing of rRNA genes
The order of rRNA genes in the ribosomal repeat unit of
each species was ascertained by PCR using gene order specific primer combinations. The primer set HG4F: HG4R
[31] produced a 947 bp product only when rRNA genes
occurred in the 5'-16S, 18S-3' order (Figure 3B), while the
primer sets ILSUF: 530R [37,68] and 18F: 5SR [37,69]
produced products of 870 bp and 1624 bp only when the
rRNA genes occurred in the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' order (Figure 3C). The ribosomal repeat unit was amplified with
Invitrogen's recombinant Taq DNA polymerase, in 5 fragments with an annealing temperature of 50°C and an
extension time of one minute. Direct sequencing was performed using BigDye® terminators on an ABI 3100 high
throughput sequencer. PCR and sequencing were performed using the species-specific primers (see Additional
File 2).
Amplification and sequencing of RPB1
RPB1 occurs as a single copy in V. necatrix with a length of
1,606 codons (4818 bp), uninterrupted by introns [42]. A
large (2958 bp) fragment of RPB1 was previously
sequenced from N. tyriae [70], providing a second

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:48

sequence from species within the Nosema/Vairimorpha
group. Alignment of these two sequences allowed conserved regions of RPB1 to be identified, facilitating the
design of degenerate PCR primers with which to amplify
RPB1 from additional species. These initial sequences
were then used to design specific RPB1 primers (See Additional File 1) for each of the Nosema/Vairimorpha species
included in the analysis. The 1979 bp RPB1 fragment used
in the analysis was amplified with Invitrogen's recombinant Taq DNA polymerase, using the species specific
primer combinations: N. apis:NaRPB1_1F:NaRPB1_4R,
N. bombycis and N. trichoplusiae: NbRPB1_1F:NbRPB1_5R,
N. empoascae: NeRPB1_1F:NeRPB1_3R, N. granulosis:NgRPB1_1F:NgRPB1_4R,
V.
cheracis:VcRPB1_1F:VcRPB1_4R,
V.
necatrix:VnRPB1_1F:VnRPB1_5R. All primer combinations used an annealing temperature of 50°C and an
extension time of two minutes. Direct sequencing was
performed using BigDye® terminators on an ABI 3100
high throughput sequencer, with the species specific
primers (see Additional File 2).
Phylogenetic analysis
Due to the high level of DNA sequence divergence
between microsporidia and other fungi [71,72], outgroup
species were selected from within Phylum Microspora.
The two species chosen as outgroups were Encephalitozoon
cuniculi, a parasite of mammals and Antonospora locustae, a
parasite of orthopteran insects. According to the phylogenetic analysis of Vossbrinck and Debrunner-Vossbrinck
[28], Encephalitozoon is a close sister group to Nosema/Vairimorpha within the Class Terresporidia while Antonospora
is more distantly related, falling within Class
Aquasporidia.

Ribosmal RNA gene sequences were aligned using Clustal
W with an equal transition: transversion ratio, a gap opening penalty of 15 and a gap elongation penalty of 6.66.
Since the internal spacers of ribosomal repeat units with
the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' rRNA gene order are not homologous to those of units with the 5'-16S, 18S-3' order [37],
the spacers were excluded from the alignment. RPB1 DNA
sequences were aligned on the basis of an RPB1 amino
acid sequence template, implemented in the programme
DAMBE [73]. The rRNA and RPB1 alignments were tested
for saturation using the methods of Steel et al. [74] and Xia
et al. [75], implemented in DAMBE. In neither case was
there significant evidence for saturation so all polymorphic sites were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In
order to test the possibility that some RPB1 sequences
were those of pseudogenes, Ka/Ks values were calculated
between each new RPB1 sequence and the well-characterised RPB1 sequence of V. necatrix. All pairwise comparisons produced Ka/Ks values within the range 0.05–0.18
(Table 2), indicating strong purifying selection upon all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/48

sequences used in the alignment and hence providing a
good indicator that all sequences were those of functional
genes.
Likelihood comparison of evolutionary models, based on
the Akaike information criteria in ModelTest [76], indicated that the General Time Reversible model with
gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I) was most suitable
for phylogenetic analysis of both the rRNA and RPB1
alignments. Phylogenetic analysis was performed separately upon the rRNA and RPB1 alignments using maximum likelihood, implemented in PAUP* 4b10 [77] and
Bayesian inference, implemented in MrBayes [78]. For
each alignment, a maximum likelihood consensus tree
was generated by conducting a heuristic search and bootstrapping with 100 replicates. The rRNA tree (figure 4)
indicated a relatively long branch length for the A. locustae
outgroup sequence. In order to check that this long
branch was not distorting the tree, additional maximum
likelihood and Bayesian searches were conducted, in
which A. locustae was either replaced with the alternative
outgroup Heterosporis anguillarum (AF387331) or omitted
entirely, leaving the single outgroup E. cuniculi. The trees
produced by these additional searches had identical
topologies to those produced using the original E. cuniculi
and A. locustae outgroup pair and were supported by qualitatively similar bootstrap values.
Hypothesis testing
Three a priori evolutionary hypotheses (Figure 6) were
compared by generating constrained phylogenetic trees in
PAUP* and selecting the tree with the highest likelihood
value using the approximately unbiased (AU) test of Shimodaira [43] and the more conservative weighted Shimodaira-Hasegawa (WSH) test [44], both implemented in
Consel [79].

Hypothesis 1 (Co-speciation) proposes co-speciation of
parasites and hosts and constrains all insect-parasitizing
Nosema/Vairimorpha to form a monophyletic group.
Hypothesis 2 (Sex/Asex) proposes that sex has been lost
once within Nosema/Vairimorpha and constrains all asexual Nosema to form a monophyletic group.
Hypothesis 3 (rRNA gene order) proposes that the rRNA
gene order has changed once from 5'-16S, 18S-3' to 5'18S, 16S, 5S-3' and constrains all Nosema/Vairimorpha
with the 5'-18S, 16S, 5S-3' rRNA gene order to form a
monophyletic group.
