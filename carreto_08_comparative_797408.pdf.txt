Abstract
Background: Genome variability generates phenotypic heterogeneity and is of relevance for
adaptation to environmental change, but the extent of such variability in natural populations is still
poorly understood. For example, selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains are variable at the ploidy
level, have gene amplifications, changes in chromosome copy number, and gross chromosomal
rearrangements. This suggests that genome plasticity provides important genetic diversity upon
which natural selection mechanisms can operate.
Results: In this study, we have used wild-type S. cerevisiae (yeast) strains to investigate genome
variation in natural and artificial environments. We have used comparative genome hybridization
on array (aCGH) to characterize the genome variability of 16 yeast strains, of laboratory and
commercial origin, isolated from vineyards and wine cellars, and from opportunistic human
infections. Interestingly, sub-telomeric instability was associated with the clinical phenotype, while
Ty element insertion regions determined genomic differences of natural wine fermentation strains.
Copy number depletion of ASP3 and YRF1 genes was found in all wild-type strains. Other gene
families involved in transmembrane transport, sugar and alcohol metabolism or drug resistance had
copy number changes, which also distinguished wine from clinical isolates.
Conclusion: We have isolated and genotyped more than 1000 yeast strains from natural
environments and carried out an aCGH analysis of 16 strains representative of distinct genotype
clusters. Important genomic variability was identified between these strains, in particular in subtelomeric regions and in Ty-element insertion sites, suggesting that this type of genome variability
is the main source of genetic diversity in natural populations of yeast. The data highlights the
usefulness of yeast as a model system to unravel intraspecific natural genome diversity and to
elucidate how natural selection shapes the yeast genome.

Background
The genome of wild-type and laboratory strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) has significant genetic variability.
In general, natural isolates are often polyploid or aneuploid and have high degree of genetic variability and an
essentially asexual life cycle [1-4]. Indeed, environmental
perturbation often selects strains that display local gene
amplifications, changes in chromosome copy number or
gross chromosomal rearrangements, such as intra- or
inter-chromosomal translocations, mediated by transposon-related sequences [5-7].
Recent comparative genomics studies showed that wildtype yeast strains cluster according to technological application rather than geographical distribution [8-10]. However, the species as a whole is not domesticated and
consists of both wild-type and comercial populations. For
example, specialized sake and wine strains were derived
from natural populations not associated with alcoholic
beverages, rather than the opposite [11]. Also, yeast
strains are found in diverse habitats, namely in oak exudates [12,13], gut of insects [14], plant leaves and in grape
berries [15]. Interestingly, damaged grape barriers, but not
undamaged berries, are an important source of yeast
strains [16]. The diversity of yeast strains in viticultural
regions is rather high, suggesting the occurrence of specific
natural strains associated with particular terroirs [17-21].
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis, used to determine
phylogenetic relationships between 651 yeast strains isolated from 56 worldwide geographical origins [22],
showed that macro geographical differentiation of strains
from Asia, Europe and Africa accounted for only 28% of
the observed genetic variation, suggesting clonal reproduction and local domestication. The close association
between vine migration and wine yeast favors the hypothesis that yeast may have followed man and vine as a commensal member of grapevine micro flora. SSRs were also
used to distinguish populations from vineyards in close
geographical locations and showed that genetic differences among yeast populations were apparent from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive
"diagnostic" genotypes [23].
The continuous utilization of yeast strains for industrial
purposes introduced artificial selective pressure that may
have also influenced genome features and novel specialization routes. In fact, yeast has been identified as an
emerging human pathogen that can cause clinically relevant infections in immune compromised patients
[24,25]. Such pathogenic strains are phylogenetically
related to baking strains, grow at higher temperature, produce extracellular proteases, are capable of pseudohyphal
growth and may be resistant to antifungal treatment
[10,26,27]. Also, the genome of the pathogenic S. cerevi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

siae strain YJM789 has very high percentage of sequence
polymorphisms (60 000 SNPs scattered over the
genome), which may be a primary cause of phenotypic
variation [28].
The wide ecological, geographical, clinical and industrial
distribution of yeast strains and the genome diversity
already uncovered suggests that it is a good model system
to understand genome diversity in natural populations
and elucidate the relevance of such diversity for adaptation to changing environments and to new ecological
niches. One of the first comprehensive studies on genetic
variation of yeast strains, carried out using high-density
oligonucleotide arrays containing up to 200,000 oligonucleotide probes from the yeast genomic sequence,
unveiled differences at the level of single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene copy number alterations [29]. A
similar approach revealed unexpected differences in 288
genes between the S288C and CEN.PK113-7D laboratory
strains, involving differential gene amplification, gene
absence or sequence polymorphisms [30].
In order to shed new light on the genome diversity of natural populations of yeast, we have isolated more than
1000 strains, genotyped them and identified clusters that
distinguished the various genotypes. We then selected representatives of these clusters and compared their genomes
with the genomes of clinical and commercial strains. For
this, we used spotted DNA microarrays containing probes
for the complete gene set of the S288C reference strain.
We compared the genomes of five commercial winemaking strains, eight strains isolated from winemaking environments of two wine producing regions in Portugal,
namely the Bairrada and Vinho Verde appellations of origin, and three clinical strains. The laboratorial strain
S288C was used as reference for relative genome profiling.
Our results highlighted differences between the laboratorial strain and the wild-type isolates linked to sub-telomeric instability and retrotransposon activity. These
elements shaped differently the genomes of yeast strains
from wine and clinical environments. The study also identified functional classes of genes where the copy number
variations were associated with strains from wine- or clinical-related environments. No correlation was found
between geographical origin and relative genome profile
in the larger group of wine-related strains.

Results
Strains and overview of genomic variability
A total of 16 wild-type strains plus the reference S288C
strain were used in this study (Table 1). The wine strains
were selected amongst isolates of wine cellars and vineyards of Bairrada and Vinho Verde wine regions, in Portugal. Strains UM218 and UM237 were selected among 300
strains isolated from the Vinho Verde Region [19] for their

distinctive genetic (simple sequence repeats) and enzymatic (API ZYM system) profiles. Strains from the Bairrada region were selected from 800 isolates collected
during two consecutive years of grape harvest and wine
production and represented major strain clusters of interdelta region PCR genotyping profiles (A. C. Gomes,
unpublished) (Figure 1). Commercial yeast strains used in
industrial wine must fermentations were Lalvin EC-1118,
used in the Vinho Verde region, and Lalvin ICV D254,
IOC 18–2007, AEB Fermol Rouge and Davis Lalvin 522,
commonly used in the Bairrada region. These commercial
strains were initially selected from French wine producing
regions (Table 1) and are used world-wide. Finally, three
strains, isolated from patients suffering from opportunistic fungal infections were also included in this study.
These strains were selected from a clinical strain collection
on the basis of their inter-delta genotyping profiles (Figure 1). The inter-delta profiles of J940915 and J940557
were very similar and these strains were used to ascertain
how the inter-delta region relatedness, used to genotype
the strain collection, correlated with the genomic variability.

Since natural hybridization between species of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group can occur [31] and, indeed, several S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii, S. bayanus × S. cerevisiae
and S. bayanus × S. cerevisiae × S. kudriavzevii, have been
described among wine strains [32-36], all strains were
tested for their hybrid nature. For this, MET2 locus restriction fragment analysis was used. S. cerevisiae-specific profiles identical to those of the reference strain S288C were
detected in all cases, suggesting that the strains selected for
aCGH analysis were authentic S. cerevisiae. These results
were corroborated by an additional analysis of 10 polymorphic S. cerevisiae-specific simple sequence repeats

shown. Inter-delta PCR profiles were obtained by DNA electrophoresis on a Labchip HT (Caliper LS), and the data was
displayed using the DataViewer software (Caliper LS). Each
lane is identified at the top.

confirmed the above data, thus unequivocally demonstrating that the strains used had a S. cerevisiae-specific
profile and were not hybrids (Additional File 1, Figure
S1).
For aCGH analysis, genomic DNA from each strain was
fluorescently labeled and competitively hybridized with
genomic DNA from the reference strain S288C, with
duplicate experiments in reverse Cy-dye labeling (dyeswap) design (see Methods).
Hierarchical cluster analysis of the aCGH data showed
high genome variability (Figure 2), and the laboratory
strain S288C was clearly differentiated from the other 16
strains. Clinical strains (Cluster 2) were clearly differentiated from the wine strains clusters (1, 3 and 4). High similarity between the genomes of two of the clinical strains,
J940557 and J940915 was expected from their identical
inter-delta region profiles (Figure 1) and microsatellite
patterns (data not shown), and such genome similarity
was confirmed by aCGH profile similarity (Figure 2).
Other pairs of strains with distinct inter-delta region profiles showed the high similarity in the clustering tree,
namely, AEB Fermol Rouge and 06L1FF11, Davis Lalvin
522 and 06L6FF20 or UM218 and UM237.

Environmental and commercial wine strains formed three
clusters (Cluster 1, 3 and 4) and differences between them
were as high as those observed between wine and clinical
strains. Divergence among wine yeast was not correlated
to geographical origin, since strains BB1235 and
06L6FF20 (Cluster 3, Bairrada region) were more similar
to strains UM218 and UM237 (Cluster 4, Vinho Verde
region) than to strains BB2453, 06L3FF02 and 06L1FF11
(Cluster 1, Bairrada region). Furthermore, commercial
strains isolated from French winemaking regions grouped
together with strains from the Bairrada and Vinho Verde
regions. There was also no separation of strains isolated
from vineyards (BB2453, BB1235, UM218 and UM237),
from cellars (06LF3FF02, 06L1FF11, 06L6FF20,
06L3FF15) or from commercial strains (AEB Fermol
Rouge, Lalvin ICV D254, Davis Lalvin 522, IOC18–2007,
Lalvin EC-1118).
Genome variability is associated with Ty elements and
telomeres
Yeast genomes evolve through dynamic processes and
often contain gene duplications and deletions or even
chromosomal segment rearrangements. Genome instability occurs throughout the genome, but is more frequent in
particular regions, such as near Ty elements, due to reciprocal translocations, or at sub-telomeric regions, possibly
caused by high-frequency of ectopic recombination [37].
To investigate the presence of regions of increased
genome variability we used the "Cluster Along Chromosomes" (CLAC) method of the CGH Miner software package [38]. This software highlighted the occurrence of
clusters of altered data in a set of samples relatively to controls, using a moving data window to calculate an average
log ratio value, while controlling the False Discovery Rate
(FDR), according to user defined parameters. Karyoscope
maps that indicated the location of regions with alterations in ORF copy number (amplifications and deletions)
for each strain were obtained using CGH Miner analysis as
previously described by Dunn and colleagues [39], with
the chromosomal coordinates of S288C genome. Since
some aCGH probes interrogated duplicated or multicopy
ORFs, namely ORFs of Ty elements, those karyoscope
maps display the average dosage of the repeated ORFs
rather than the dosage of each of the repeated ORFs. A
moving window of three ORFs was chosen as the lowest
statistically meaningful interval for averaging the hybridization signal, thus defining the resolution of the analysis.

The karyoscope maps displaying the relative hybridization data derived for each strain revealed that the majority
of the genome alterations corresponded to deletions relative to strain S288C, while ORF amplifications were rare
(Figure 3 and Additional File 2, Figures S2A–S2P). ORF
amplification clusters were found in some strains, mostly
located in sub-telomeric regions (Figure 3A) and within

Karyoscope maps of strains Lalvin ICV D254 (A) and J940915 (B)
Karyoscope maps of strains Lalvin ICV D254 (A) and J940915 (B). In order to visualize the gene copy number alterations along chromosomes and to have a global overview of the alterations detected by aCGH, the data was plotted along each
chromosome, using the annotated ORF coordinates of S288C. Vertical bars represent the relative hybridization pattern relatively to the genome of strain S288C. Red bars correspond to amplified ORFs, green bars represent deleted ORFs and grey
bars are statistically non-significant alterations (FDR <0.279). The horizontal lines indicate the hybridization ratios in logarithmic scale. Signals of repeated ORFs, such as those of Ty elements or repetitive sequences flanking Ty element insertion sites,
correspond to the average signal rather than the individual signal dosage of that sequence. Clusters of altered ORFs contained
roughly one third of Ty -ORFs and contributed to localization of the chromosome alterations following the genome coordinates of the S288C strain.

20 Kb of the S288C respective chromosome end, but only
few corresponded to genes with annotated function. Clusters of depleted ORFs were found in sub-telomeric regions
and contained large percentage of Ty elements and hypothetical ORFs (Figure 4). In the group of wine strains, up
to one third of the observed gene copy number alterations
were found in sub-telomeric regions (Figure 4A) – within
50 Kb from the S288C chromosome ends, using the criterion of Edwards-Ingram and colleagues [40]. On average,
the clinical strains showed slightly higher percentage
(almost 40%) of depleted ORFs localized near the telomeres. However, this is mostly explained by the massive loss
of chromosomes VII and X right arms in strains J940557
and J940915 (see karyoscope map of J940915 in Figure

3B). The depletion of ORFs around the centromeric
regions- within 20 Kb of the centromere, according to the
criterion of Schacherer and colleagues [41]- was reduced
and only slightly above average in some of the wine
strains.
A clear differentiation between clinical and wine related
strains was observed when the frequency of transposable
elements within the ORFs with depleted copy number
(Figure 4B) was considered. Ty elements comprised 36%
of the ORFs absent in all wine strains, which meant that
approximately one third of the ORFs associated with retrotransposon activity (42 out of a total of 113) in S288C
were absent in these strains. The genomes of the clinical

strains, however, contained most of the Ty elements identified in the genomic sequence of S288C, since only 7% of
the ORFs absent in all three of them were classified in this
category.
Highly variable genomic regions in wine and clinical strains
The differences between wine and clinical strains were further highlighted with the consensus plots obtained from
the intersection of the individual karyoscope maps of the
thirteen wine fermentation strains (Figure 5A), compared
to the three clinical isolates (Figure 5B). These plots represented the relative amount of samples with copy number
alterations, showing the percentage of strains with a given
amplification or deletion. Most of the deletion clusters
identified in wine strains co-localized with absent Ty ele-

ments (Figure 5A), while in clinical isolates a significant
number of depletions were associated with sub-telomeric
instability (Figure 5B). Variable regions affected different
sub-functional categories of genes in wine and clinical
strains. For example, carbohydrate transporters and glycosidases were the main functional groups of genes absent
in clinical strains, but genes involved in vesicle transport,
telomere maintenance and alcohol metabolism were also
identified among the lost sub-telomeric genes. The functional categories most affected by gene copy number variability in wine strains were related to vitamin metabolism,
DNA recombination, polysaccharide metabolism, regulation of meiotic cell cycle and reproduction, and were frequently located in the vicinity of Ty element insertion
sites.

The ORF variability patterns differ between wine and clinical strains
The ORF variability patterns differ between wine and clinical strains. The consensus karyoscope maps obtained for
wine (Panel-A) and clinical (Panel-B) strains showed that ORF variation in wine strains was distributed along chromosomes
while in clinical strains such distribution was more frequent in sub-telomeric regions. The consensus maps show the relative
percentage of strains (percent of samples) within wine (Panel-A) and clinical (Panel-B) environments with copy number alteration in a given ORF, relatively to the reference strain S288C. The data was plotted according to ORF chromosome location.
Red bars represent percentage of strains with amplifications and green bars represent the percentage of strains with deletions,
according to the grey-line scale shown above and below the chromosome central line. Open circles indicate the position of

ASP3 and YRF1 gene families differentiate wild-type and
laboratory strains
The karyoscope maps constructed by the moving average
window algorithm (implemented in CGH miner) highlighted genes with copy number alterations. Of the 634
ORFs identified as altered by the CLAC algorithm, in at
least one of the strains, significance analysis confirmed
270 ORF alterations. From these, 30% corresponded to Ty
elements, mostly located in depleted hybridization clusters in wine strains (Figure 5). Another third of ORFs with
copy number variation were hypothetical ORFs and were
contiguous to deleted Ty elements in wine strains. Annotated variable ORFs constituted the remaining third of significantly altered ORFs and the respective aCGH values
(M values) were depicted in Figure 6A for further discussion.

General trends in copy number alterations included both
amplified and depleted genes. Genes with the same trend
in copy number alteration across all strains were highlighted in grey. Among the genes depleted in all strains,
relative to the reference strain S288C, were four copies of
tandemly-repeated cell-wall asparaginase genes (ASP3-1,
ASP3-2, ASP3-3 and ASP3-4), which are induced in
response to nitrogen starvation [42]. Also, ORFs
YLR161W, YLR156W and YLR159W, that code for putative proteins of unknown function and of identical
sequence, were depleted in all strains. These genes are
located in the right arm of Chromosome XII near a ribosomal DNA region, in a chromosome locus corresponding
to a large cluster of depleted ORFs flanking Ty elements,
and were indicated in the karyoscope consensus maps of
both wine and clinical strains (Figure 5A, B).
The relative hybridization values of significantly altered
genes (Figure 6A) identified another set of homologous
genes whose copy number was altered in all wild-type
strains. Indeed, five genes of the YRF1 family, which are
located in telomeric Y' elements and encode DNA helicases (YRF1-2, YRF1-3, YRF1-4, YRF1-5 and YRF1-8), were
present in the genome of S288C, but were depleted or, at
least, partially depleted in environmental, clinical and
commercial strains. The missing YRF1 genes were part of
the depleted ORF clusters located at the telomeres of the
right arms of chromosomes V, VII, XII and XV (Figure 5),
together with several hypothetical ORFs.
Gene YIL014C-A, coding for a putative protein of
unknown function, was deleted in all strains except in
J940047. The same was observed for the tandem repeated
genes ENA1 and ENA2, which code for a P-type ATPase
sodium pump involved in the efflux of sodium and lithium ions, required for salt tolerance, which were depleted
in all strains except 06L3FF02. Gene ENA5 was only
depleted in strain J940047.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

A group of genes with increased copy number in almost
all strains was also identified (Figure 6A). Among them,
IMD1, IMD2, PHO11, PHO12 were signaled by the CLAC
algorithm as belonging to clusters of sub-telomeric genes
amplified in strains Lalvin EC-1118, Lalvin ICV 254 and
UM237, but aCGH values suggested that they could also
be amplified in other strains (Figure 6A). PHO11 and
PHO12 genes, which code for acid phosphatases and are
induced by phosphate starvation, increased their copy
number by a factor of 3 in strain UM237 relative to
S288C, while in strain Lalvin EC-1118 the fold increase in
hybridization signal was more compatible with its duplication. The copy number of the IMD2 gene increased by a
factor of 2 in Lalvin EC-1118 and UM237 strains, as well
as in strain Lalvin ICV D254, although the latter was not
highlighted as duplicated by CGH-Miner. In strain Lalvin
ICV D254, RDS1 (a zinc cluster transcription factor
involved in resistance to cycloheximide) was part of an
amplified cluster of genes on Chromosome III and the
aCGH signal indicated a 3-fold increase relative to S288C.
The aCGH values for this gene (Figure 6A) further suggested that it was also amplified in other strains (see Panel
D of Figure 6).
Interestingly, both IMD1 and IMD2 genes code for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and confer resistance
to mycophenolic acid, which is produced by the fungus
Penicillium stoloniferum and inhibits de novo purine synthesis. These genes, together with RDS1, are involved in
resistance to compounds that inhibit eukaryotic cell proliferation and increased copy numbers point to a survival
advantage in competitive ecosystems in presence of
organisms that secrete mycophenolic acid or cycloheximide, as growth inhibitors.
Gene copy number alterations and the origin of strains
Several genes showed different copy number alterations in
wine and in clinical strains (Figure 6, panels B-F). For
example, the genes HXT9, HXT11 and two ORFs of HXT12
(YIL170W and YIL171W) were depleted in most wine
strains, with the exception of UM218, Lalvin EC-1118 and
AEB Fermol Rouge, but did not show copy number variation in the clinical strains (Figure 6B). These genes code
for putative hexose transporters which are non-functional
in strain S288C. Similar copy number changes across the
analyzed strains were identified for HPF1 and FSP2, which
code for proteins with glucosidase activity: HPF1 codes for
a haze-protective mannoprotein that reduces the particle
size of aggregated proteins in white wines, while FSP2 is
induced under nitrogen limitation. Also, the gene ENB1,
which codes for a trans-membrane iron transporter of the
major facilitator superfamily and is expressed under iron
deprivation conditions, was included in this group. The
absence of these genes was particularly notorious in
strains isolated from the Bairrada region and in the com-

Gene copy number alterations show significant inter-strain variability
Gene copy number alterations show significant inter-strain variability. Several genes were deleted in all environmental, clinical and commercial strains, while other genes were amplified in almost all strains, relative to the laboratory S288C
strain (boxed blocks). However, most of the genes showed significant copy number variability between strains. Panel-A represents the aCGH values (M values) for genes with altered copy number in at least one of the strains. The genes with similar
copy number alterations in the wild-type strains relatively to the reference laboratorial strain S288C were highlighted in grey
(boxed blocks). The coloured bars next to the gene names identify groups of genes whose relative hybridization value is shown
in the line graphs of Panels B-G. In these panels, grey lines represent the aCGH values of genes indicated on the right hand side
of each panel (also shown in the color coded map of Panel-A) and the pink line represents the average aCGH values of the
genes (lines).

mercial strain Davis Lalvin 522 (commonly used in Bairrada wine musts fermentations).
The genes FDH1, FIT2, FRE5 and PHR1 were absent in the
clinical isolates J940557 and J940915 and in strain
06L3FF02. FDH1 codes for a formate dehydrogenase, FIT2
codes for a mannoprotein involved in the retention of
siderophore-iron in the cell wall, FRE5 codes for a putative ferric reductase induced by low iron levels, and PHR
codes for a DNA photolyase induced by DNA damage
(Figure 6, panel C). These genes do not share a common
function, but belong to a set of contiguous ORFs located
in the sub-telomeric region of the right arm of Chromosome V, which was deleted in many of the strains (CLAC
algorithm). This cluster of deleted ORFs included FIT3,
which was also deleted in the above mentioned strains
and in 06L1FF11, but showed aCGH values compatible
with amplification of copy number in many of the natural
wine strains and in J940047. Although redundant, considering the existence of other functional homologues, variability in copy number of these genes may affect the
capacity of yeast to thrive in environments with high levels of exogenous formaldehyde, produced from plant
material or from degradation of environmental pollutants, and in environments with low iron availability.
A group of genes coding for proteins with alcohol dehydrogenase activity were missing in strains J940557 and
J940915, but were amplified in many of the wine strains
(Figure 6, panel D). For example, ADH7 and AAD3, which
belong to a cluster of amplified ORFs identified in Chromosome III in strain Lalvin ICV D254 by CLAC analysis
(Figure 3A), showed increased copy number in strains
BB1235 and Davis Lalvin 522. AAD6 and AAD10 were
depleted in strains J940557 and J940915. Since these
genes code for proteins involved in ethanol tolerance,
their increase in copy number may confer high resistance
to ethanol, which is one of the most important phenotypes for grape must fermentation. RDS1 was also
included in this group of genes because of the similar copy
number variation profile within the analyzed strains,
probably due to its location in the same cluster of altered
ORFs as ADH7 and AAD3, in Chromosome III.
A large set of genes were consistently deleted in the three
clinical isolates (Figure 6A, panels E and G). The COG3,
HSP60, MSP1, NCE101 genes (Figure 6, panel E) are
implicated in protein transport and localization, while
ARR3 and DIP5 are arsenite and amino acid transporters,
respectively. These genes that were absent in clinical
strains were amplified in some of the wine strains, namely
06L3FF02, 06L1FF11 and AEB Fermol Rouge. The relative
abundance of these genes in the latter strains explained, at
least in part, why their genome profiles differed from
those of the other wine strains (Figure 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

Other genes were absent in clinical and in many wine
strains (Figure 6, panel F). For example, genes involved in
carbohydrate transport (HXT15, MPH2, and MPH3) and
sugar metabolism (SOR1, SOR2) belonged to this category. Strains Lalvin EC-1118 and IOC 18–2007 were the
only wine strains with a decreased copy number in AGP3,
which codes for an amino acid permease, and DAK2, participating in the glycerol catabolic process, while strain
06L6FF20 constituted an exception within the wine
strains, since it showed identical copy number of all of
these genes relatively to strain S288C.
Gene copy number signatures for wine must fermentation
Many of the variable genes coded for transporters, permeases, or flocculation proteins, contributing to a
genomic signature of the wine strains. Among these genes,
the maltose transporter gene, MAL11, and the MAL-activator protein gene, MAL13, were particularly interesting
because they are important for maltose assimilation and
MAL13 is non-functional in the laboratory S288C strain
[43]. These genes were absent in the commercial wine
strains and in some of the environmental isolates. Also,
only some of the commercial wine strains (Lalvin EC1118 and AEB Fermol Rouge), showed aCGH values compatible with copy number increase of CUP1-2. Genes
involved in flocculation mediated by cell wall protein-carbohydrate interactions, namely FLO1, FLO5, FLO9 and
FLO10, were in general depleted in the wine strains, and
also in two of the clinical strains. Evidences for variability
in copy number of the homologous genes were found in
almost all strains, with exception of Lalvin ICV D254,
where the aCGH values indicated that these genes were
deleted. Finally, copy number variability among wine
strains was also found in genes PAU14, PAU15 and PAU21
that code for hypothetical proteins with structural similarity to the seripauperin family.

Discussion
aCGH profiles grouped yeast strains from different
geographical origins
The genome variability uncovered within the environmental, clinical and commercial strains was pronounced
and did not show any correlation between genome characteristics and ecosystem or geographical origin. Interestingly, this study unveiled high genomic similarity
between the commercial strains and isolates from regions
where these commercial strains were used in wine must
fermentation. For instance, strains UM218 and UM237
from the Vinho Verde region share a similar genome
hybridization profile (Figure 2) and grouped with strain
Lalvin EC-1118 (Cluster 4), which is frequently used in
the production of sparkling Vinho Verde. Strain IOC 18–
2007, which is used in bottle-fermentations, is widely
used in the Bairrada sparkling wine production, and
grouped with some of the Bairrada isolates (Cluster 3).

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:524

Close associations were also found between AEB Fermol
Rouge and strains 06L1FF11, 06L3FF02, and BB2453,
from cellars and vineyards of the Bairrada region, respectively (Cluster 1). Strains 06L6FF20, 06L3FF15 and
BB1235 are more related to Davis Lalvin 522 than to any
other commercial strain. AEB Fermol Rouge, isolated in
France, and Davis Lalvin 522, obtained from the USA
(Table 1), are both used in the Bairrada cellars to ferment
wine musts due to their high fermentation performance
with grapes from this region.
The continuous use of commercial yeast strains in large
quantities and during successive years may lead to some
genetic homogenization of resident strains that belong to
the autochthonous yeast flora. This is supported by the
fact that strain UM218 was collected in 2001, 300 meters
from a winery where strain Lalvin EC-1118 was used in
that year, whereas strain UM237 was collected, in 2003,
20 meters from a winery where the same commercial
strain was used since 2001 [44]. However, since the Bairrada isolates come from cellars where no commercial
strains were used, and the vineyards were not located in
the vicinity of cellars (A. C. Gomes, personal communication), a contamination with commercial yeast does not
explain the similarities between environmental isolates
and some commercial strains. Instead, the winemaker's
experience for the production of wines with the most
desirable expression of the region's terroir may, indirectly,
be responsible for this genomic resemblance. By favoring
phenotypic characteristics in the autochthonous strains,
which adapted during centuries of positive selection by
farming and wine producing activities, the wine producer
may have selected commercial yeast according to the same
required phenotypes, and this resemblance in phenotype
is reflected, to some extent, in similar gene copy number
characteristics.
Large scale genome alterations
S. cerevisiae strains that were mainly obtained from winemaking environment, are homothallic, mostly
homozygous (65%), with low to high (> 85%) sporulation ability and are predominantly diploid [31,45-47].
Aneuploid strains have also been described [4,22,48,49].
Although no evidence for polyploidy was detected in the
strains analyzed in this study, the karyoscope maps of the
clinical isolates J940557 and J940915 (see Figure 3B)
showed a systematic depletion in hybridization signal
throughout the entire length of chromosomes III, VII and
X. This depletion was only statistically significant at the
right arm-ends, ruling out the hypothesis that these strains
were aneuploid for the referred chromosomes. Also, no
evidence for aneuploidy was found in the other strains.

One explanation for the karyoscopes of strains J940557
and J940915 may be the presence of heterologous chro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

mosomes originated from a different strain, albeit similar
to S. cerevisiae S288C. The latter hypothesis is supported
by the frequent occurrence of Saccharomyces sp. hybrids,
which originate from mating of different Saccharomyces
species that form viable, although sterile, zygotes [31].
These hybrids are sometimes selected for industrial beer
or wine fermentations due to phenotypic advantages
[32,50,51], but inter-specific hybrids were also found in
diverse spontaneous fermentations [33,52]. However, the
strains used in our study, including the clinical isolates,
were not hybrids (Additional File 1, Figure S1). Therefore,
differences in chromosome copy number, that is, structural heteromorphisms, of chromosomes III, VII and X,
may be the explanation for the obtained patterns of relative hybridization.
Specific trends of genome instability distinguished wine
and clinical isolates
Consensus maps highlighted the most variable regions of
the yeast genome, relatively to the laboratory S288C
strain. High variability was associated with the sub-telomeric regions of some chromosomes, irrespective of the
strain's origin. In particular, a large fraction of strains,
either from wine or clinical background, had ORF deletions located at the right end of Chromosome I, left end
of Chromosome VI, and right end of chromosomes VII
and X (Figure 5). Comparative genome studies performed
by Winzeler and colleagues [29] showed that inter-species
genome variability is biased toward sub-telomeric
regions, where genes related to carbon source metabolism
and transport are located. Apparently, telomere variability
is important for adaptation to new environments and to
different metabolic sources to overcome environmental
stress.

Retrotransposons are also known as regions of high
genome diversity between yeast strains and species
[53,54]. Our data further supports the hypothesis that
they may be selected for generating genomic variability in
response to environmental stimuli, since they were
affected differently in wine and clinical strains (Figure 5).
Wine must fermentation isolates differed dramatically in
Ty element composition from the reference laboratorial
strain, as indicated by the relative absence of about one
third of these elements, together with ORFs flanking their
insertion sites. On the other hand, clinical strains were
similar to S288C in composition of Ty element and Ty element associated ORFs.
This raised the question of whether clinical strains and
S288C share a common ancestor or whether the reduced
number of Ty elements and the flanking genes in the wine
strains could result from selective pressures that affect particular regions of the genome in response to adaptation to
particular environments. Genome comparison between

Page 11 of 17

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:524

the clinical isolate YJM789 and S288C undertaken by Wei
and colleagues [28], showed a close association between
repeat sequences sites in S288C and deleted regions in
YJM789.
A comparison of the consensus plots of the strains used in
this study with the sequences of the chromosomes of
YJM789, showed that the clusters of depleted ORFs associated with Ty elements in the former (Figure 5A) were
also missing in the YJM789 genome (see Additional File 3,
Figures S3A–S3P). On the other hand, the consensus plot
obtained for the clinical strains coincided with the comparative analysis carried out by Wei and colleagues [28].
In particular, in the sub-telomeric variability found in several chromosomes and in the clusters of deleted ORFs
associated with Ty element insertion sites in chromosomes X and XII (Figure 5B). Since YJM789 is not a wine
fermenting strain, but is associated to a pathogenic phenotype, the resemblance of genomic alterations related to
Ty element content between this strain and those isolated
from vineyards was surprising and deserves further study.
Variability in copy number of transposable elements has
been previously reported within the Hemiascomycetous
yeast clade [55], and particularly in this group of organisms [40]. This is in line with previous studies that showed
low copy number of these elements relative to S288C in
wild-type wine, lager and "flor" yeast [39,56,57], as well
as in laboratory strains other than S288C [29]. The high
variability in Ty element composition observed in this
study supports the hypothesis that retrotransposition is
relevant for adaptation, at least in the Saccharomyces sensu
stricto clade. Sequences flanking transposable elements
generate variability in the yeast genome [6], probably due
to the ectopic recombination involving Ty element repetitive sequences, since Ty elements play a role in the mobilization of genome fragments throughout the genome,
resulting frequently in chromosomal rearrangements and
gene duplications [58]. Variability of Ty element content
is supported by retrotransposon activity loss or acquisition in some lineages of Saccharomyces sensu stricto, correlating with speciation, according to Liti and colleagues
[59]. Interestingly, these authors carried out a population
survey of LTR-retrotransposons in the Saccharomyces sensu
stricto complex and showed that Ty elements may be
absent in groups of geographical isolates and are often
lost or horizontally transferred in an apparent homeostatic control of the total number of repetitive elements.
Gene copy number alterations differentiate laboratorial
and environmental strains
The absence of the tandem repeated ASP3 region, located
in Chromosome XII, as well as the ENA region of Chromosome IV, were observed both in wine and clinical
strains (Figure 6). Nevertheless, such deletions were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

found in various strains and are not specific of wine or
clinical phenotypes [29,40,56,60,61]. Variability in copy
number of the ASP3 genes was found in a comparative
hybridization study of 9 strains isolated from ale and lager
brewing fermentations, suggesting that the presence or
absence of these genes could discriminate fermentative
yeast [62]. However, the absence of these genes in the
wine yeasts analyzed in this study, including commercial
and clinical isolates, only discriminated the laboratorial
strain S288C from the environmental isolates, indicating
that the use of asparagine as an alternative nitrogen source
is not important in natural niches from were the wild-type
strains were isolated.
Depletion of the genes of the YRF1 family also differentiated the environmental from the laboratorial reference
strain. These DNA helicase genes are induced in strains
with deficient telomerase activity, as part of a mechanism
of telomere rescue [63]. These genes are present in sub-telomeric Y' elements, but seem to be dispensable, since a
study on the survival and fitness of an S. paradoxus isolate
without telomerase and in the absence of Y' elements was
similar to that of other well characterized strains [59].
Although Y' elements are conserved between strains and
species of Saccharomyces [64,65], copy number of the
YRF1 family of genes varied remarkably in the group of
strains surveyed in this study (Figure 6).
Variation in fermentation related genes
Genes involved in maltose metabolism, namely MAL11
and MAL13, were depleted relative to S288C in most commercial wine strains, while some of the non-commercial
isolates showed deletion of both or just one of these
genes. In a similar genomic profile study of commercial
wine strains, Dunn and colleagues [39] found intra-strain
copy number variation of MAL11 and MAL13 genes and
did not include them in their "commercial wine yeast
genome signature". This signature also highlighted the
deletion of two copies of CUP1 relatively to the genome
of S288C. However, they found variability in copy
number of these genes within isolates of the same commercial wine strain. Similarly, these genes were deleted in
most of the wine related strains studied here, but not in
BB2453 and AEB Fermol Rouge in which CUP1-2 was
apparently amplified. These genes code for a protein that
binds copper and mediates resistance to high concentrations of copper and cadmium and this locus is variably
amplified in different yeast strains [66,67] and is not
exclusive of wine fermentation strains.

Variability of copy number among the wine strains was
also found in genes of the seripauperin family, namely
PAU14, PAU15 and PAU21. These genes are encoded
mainly in subtelomeric regions and are strongly regulated
by anaerobiosis during alcoholic fermentation [68,69].

Page 12 of 17

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:524

They play a role in sterol lipid transport and hence their
relevance for ethanol tolerance during anaerobic growth.
While PAU21 was depleted in all wine strains relative to
S288C, PAU14 and PAU15 copy number increased in
some of the wine strains, as well as in all clinical isolates,
but decreased in others, namely in isolates whose
genomic profiles were similar to those of AEB Fermol
Rouge. PAU15 is involved in the response to toxins [70],
but no function is yet known for PAU14.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

ies. Genome variability associated with retrotransposon
mobility was characteristic of wine strains. Therefore,
these variability mechanisms may have a positive impact
on the fitness of strains during colonization of new environment(s). In other words, this present study highlights
the usefulness of yeast as a model system to study
genomic variability in the context of environmental and
evolutionary genomics.

Methods
Conclusion
Our data showed that telomeric recombination and Ty
element insertion were the main genome diversity features of the clinical, commercial and environmental isolates used in this study. Among the variable genes, mostly
depleted, were genes involved in metabolic functions
related to cellular homeostasis or transport of different
solutes such as ions, sugars and metals. Clusters of
depleted ORFs also contained ribosomal proteins, general
transcription factors and transcription activators, translation initiation factors, helicases and zinc-finger genes.
In the clinical strains, genes associated to pathogenesis,
namely those involved in pseudohyphal growth and invasiveness, did not show copy number alterations. This confirmed previous studies by Klingberg and colleagues [71],
who did not find specific virulence factors separating clinical from non-clinical yeast strains. Despite this, Llanos
and colleagues [27] found that clinical isolates have a typical pathogenic phenotype when compared with industrial yeasts. For example, secretion of proteases and
phospholipases, growth at 42°C and pseudohyphal
growth are more pronounced in clinical isolates. Some
strains isolated from infections may be opportunistic colonizers of the human environment and not commensals
of humans. Indeed, a recent survey of 92 yeast invasive
infections revealed that 50% of them were caused by Saccharomyces boulardii, which is used as a probiotic preparation for the treatment of antibiotic-related diarrhea [72].
The genomic variability found in this study supported
other studies showing duplication and deletion of sub-telomeric genes involved in secondary metabolism linked to
environmental adaptation [73]. In this study, the sub-telomeric genes whose copy number changed, namely MAL,
FLO, HXT, PHO, IMD, SOR, PAU, FIT and ARR family
genes, did not identify specific alterations of environmental or of commercial wine strains. Also, our list of genes
with variable copy number showed differences with the
"commercial wine yeast signature" published by Dun and
colleagues. [39]. However, some of the genes identified in
our study confirmed the trend of genome alterations of
wine strains highlighted by the "commercial wine yeast
signature". For example, the IMD and PHO genes were
amplified and the MAL genes were deleted in both stud-

Strains and culture conditions
A list of strains used in this study is provided in Table 1,
together with information about the respective origin.
Wine strains were isolated from fermenting musts in wine
cellars from the Bairrada wine region and from vineyards
of Bairrada and Vinho Verde wine regions, according to
Valero et al. [44]. Commercial wine strains were kindly
provided by Adega Cooperativa da Bairrada, Cantanhede,
Portugal. Clinical isolates were a kind gift of Prof. Mick
Tuite from the University of Kent, Canterbury, UK.

Yeast strains were cultivated in 5 ml YEPD (1% yeast
extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), at 30°C, with 185 rpm
agitation, until cell density reached 108–109 cells/ml, harvested and washed three times with distilled water by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3000 g, resuspended in 200 μl
lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0), and stored at -80°C until
used for DNA extraction.
DNA isolation
DNA was isolated as described by Hoffman and Winston
[74], with some adaptations. For DNA extraction, 200 μl
of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol were
added to the cells resuspendend in lysis buffer (see
above), together with 300 mg of acid-washed glass beads
(~500 μm diameter). The mixture was vortexed for 10
minutes before the addition of 200 μl of TE buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Following a 5 minute
centrifugation at 14000 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415
R) for phase separation, the DNA in the aqueous phase
was precipitated with 1 ml ethanol (96%, v/v) at room
temperature, resuspended in 400 μl of TE containing 60
mg RNaseA (GE Healthcare), and incubated at 37°C for 6
hours. The DNA was precipitated with 10 μl of 4 M
ammonium acetate and 1 ml of room temperature absolute ethanol, and resuspended in 400 μl of TE buffer. Proteins were removed by treating DNA samples with 10 μg
Proteinase K (Roche) and incubating overnight at 50°C.
Finally, the DNA was collected by precipitation with 20 μl
of 3.0 M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and 500 μl of ethanol
(96%, v/v) at -20°C, followed by incubation at -80°C for
1 hour. After centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 20 minutes
at 4°C, the final DNA pellet was carefully washed with

500 μl of ethanol (70% v/v), left to dry at room temperature, and resuspended in 200 μl of TE buffer.
Genotyping analysis
The PCR/RFLP analysis of the MET2 gene was performed
as described by Antunovics et al. [75] and of OPY1, KIN82,
MET6, KEL2 and CYR1 genes as described by González et
al. [33,34]. PCR analysis of delta sequences was performed as described [76,77].
Microarray production
For the production of in-house spotted DNA-microarrays,
6388 70 mer oligonucleotides targeting the ORFeome of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (OPERON Yeast AROS v1.1 collection, Qiagen) were spotted twice on CodeLink activated slides (GE Healthcare), according to the slide
manufacturer's instructions, using a MicroGrid Compact
II spotter (GenomicSolutions). A set of ten different 70
mer probes designed from Escherichia coli genome
sequence, with less than 70% homology to S. cerevisiae
genome, was also included in the microarray in order to
monitor non-specific hybridization. The array design and
spotting protocol were deposited in ArrayExpress database [78] under the accession code A-MEXP-1185.
Labelling and hybridization
For labelling, 4 μg of gDNA were digested with 20 units of
DpnII (New England Biolabs, USA) to yield fragments
between 250 and 3000 bp. The fragmented DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol (96%, v/v) at 20°C. Genomic DNA was fluorescently labelled using the
ULS arrayCGH labelling kit from Kreatech (Kreatech, The
Netherlands), which is a non-enzymatic protocol that
allows direct labelling of unmodified genomic DNA.
Briefly, 1 μl of Cy3-ULS, or Cy5-ULS, was added to 2 μg of
previously digested DNA, together with 2 μl of the 10 ×
labelling solution provided with the kit. The sample volume was adjusted to 20 μl with DNAse-free water and the
labelling reaction was promoted by incubating the sample
at 85°C for 30 minutes. The excess ULS-dye was removed
using the KREA pure columns following the kit manufacturer's instructions. The degree of labelling (DoL), corresponding to the percentage of labelled nucleotides, was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and
at 550 nm for ULS-Cy3 labelled DNA, or at 260 nm and
650 nm for ULS-Cy5 labelled DNA. Samples with DoL
between 1.0% and 2.0% were routinely obtained.

For comparative genome hybridization, ULS-Cy3 labelled
DNA from each of the environmental, commercial and
clinical strains was combined with ULS-Cy5 labelled DNA
from strain S288C. Dye-swap hybridizations were performed for each strain. To ensure microarray data baseline
robustness, differentially labelled DNA from the S288C
strain were co-hybridized, in a total of six self-self experi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/524

ments, and used as controls. The mixture of the required
Cy3 and Cy5 labelled samples was adjusted to 208 μl with
DNAse-free water, mixed with 52 μl Agilent 10× blocking
Agent and 260 μl of Agilent 2× Oligo aCGH Hybridization
Solution (Agilent, USA), and incubated at 95°C for 3 minutes. After a short spin-down, the labelled DNA mixture
was applied to a microarray slide pre-hybridized as
described by van de Peppel and colleagues [79], assembled in a SureHyb hybridization chamber fitted with a
gasket slide (Agilent), and incubated for 20 hours at 65°C
in a hybridization oven (HIR10M Grant, Boekel), with 5
rpm rotation speed.
Slides were washed as described in the Agilent Oligonucleotide Array-based CGH for Genomic DNA Analysis
protocol [80]. Briefly, the microarray and gasket slide
were disassembled inside a staining dish containing 250
ml of Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer 1 and the slides (up to 4)
were washed in fresh 250 ml of Oligo aCGH Wash Buffer
1 solution at room temperature, during 5 minutes, with
gentle agitation from a magnetic stirrer. A second wash
step was carried out by immersing the slides in Oligo
aCGH Wash Buffer 2 solution, previously warmed to
37°C, during 1 minute, also with gentle magnetic stirring.
Finally, slides were dried by centrifugation at 800 rpm for
3 minutes.
Image acquisition and data processing
Images of the microarray hybridizations were acquired
using the Agilent G2565AA microarray scanner. The fluorescence intensities were quantified with QuantArray v3.0
software (PerkinElmer). Using BRB-ArrayTools v3.4.0
software [81], manually flagged bad spots were eliminated and the local background was subtracted before
averaging the replicate features on the array. Log2 intensity
ratios (M values) were then Median normalized to correct
for differences in genomic DNA labelling efficiency
between samples. The raw data, as well as the processed
(filtered and Median normalized) data, for all hybridizations was submitted to the ArrayExpress database and is
available under the accession code E-MTAB-29.
Data analysis
The relative hybridization signal of each ORF was derived
form the average of the two dye-swap hybridizations performed for each strain. The normalized log2 ratio (M
value) was considered as a measure of the relative abundance of each ORF relatively to that of the reference strain
S288C. Deviations from the 1:1 hybridization ratio were
taken as indicative of changes in DNA copy number.
Although depleted hybridization may be due to sequence
divergence as well as nucleotide deletions, sequence divergence of a given ORF relatively to that of S288C would
have to be higher than 30% in order to impair the hybridization with 70 mer oligonucleotides [82,83]. Given that

the variability usually observed between Saccharomyces
genomes, (either within laboratorial strains or natural isolates), is much lower than this estimate [11,32,41], we
interpreted statistically significant depletions in hybridization signal as ORF deletions. We further confirmed that
the set of ORFs discussed in Figure 6 were targeted by the
respective microarray probe with at least 93% homology
in the genomes of the S. cerevisiae strains S288C, RM11-1a
(wine isolate) and YJM789 (clinical isolate). This
excluded the hypothesis of depleted hybridization signal
due to extreme gene variability or partial deletion of the
targeted sequence (Additional File 4, Table S1).
The aCGH hybridization patterns were used to investigate
the genomic relatedness of the wild-type yeast strains.
Hierarchical cluster analysis (Pearson correlation, average
linkage) was performed using MeV from TM4 software
suit [84], with the normalized and dye-swap averaged
aCGH profiles. The reproducibility of the clustering analysis was confirmed by repeating the paired dye-swap
hybridizations for one of the sixteen strains, randomly
selected, and by verifying that independent assays for the
same strain grouped together in the dendrogram (not
shown).
Karyoscope maps were generated for each strain using
CGH-Miner [85]. For data smoothing, the parameters
were set for BAC analysis, to produce a moving window of
three ORFs for averaging the hybridization signal. Six
S288C independent self-self hybridizations were used for
base line correction. The average data of the six self-self
S288C hybridizations was used to ascertain the baseline
noise in deriving karyoscope maps and is shown in Additional File 2, Figure S2Q. Summary plots, also denominated consensus plots, depicting the relative percentage of
samples showing a particular alteration, were obtained by
combining the required individual karyoscope maps
using the same software.
Multi-class significance analysis (SAM) was done using
the algorithm implemented in MeV from TM4 software.
The individual hybridizations were used as the input data,
in a total of two dye-swap hybridizations for each strain/
class, except for strain S288C, which was represented by
the five least variable self-self hybridizations of the set of
six performed for CLAC analysis. SAM analysis indicated
the ORFs with significant copy number alteration in at
least one of the strains, with a FDR (90th percentile) of
0.336. Functional annotations and GO terms association
was done following the Saccharomyces Genome Database
(SGD) annotations [86].
