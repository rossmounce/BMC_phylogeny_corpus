Abstract
Background: BK virus infections can have clinically significant consequences in immunocompromised individuals.
Detection and monitoring of active BK virus infections in certain situations is recommended and therefore PCR assays
for detection of BK virus have been developed. The performance of current BK PCR detection assays is limited by the
existence of viral polymorphisms, unknown at the time of assay development, resulting in inconsistent detection of
BK virus. The objective of this study was to identify a stable region of the BK viral genome for detection by PCR that
would be minimally affected by polymorphisms as more sequence data for BK virus becomes available.
Results: Employing a combination of techniques, including amino acid and DNA sequence alignment and
interspecies analysis, a conserved, stable PCR target region of the BK viral genomic region was identified within the
VP2 gene. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was then developed that is specific for BK virus, has an analytical
sensitivity of 15 copies/reaction (450 copies/ml) and is highly reproducible (CV ≤ 5.0%).
Conclusion: Identifying stable PCR target regions when limited DNA sequence data is available may be possible
by combining multiple analysis techniques to elucidate potential functional constraints on genomic regions.
Applying this approach to the development of a real-time quantitative PCR assay for BK virus resulted in an
accurate method with potential clinical applications and advantages over existing BK assays.

Background
BK virus (BKV), along with JC virus (JCV) and Simian
virus 40 (SV40), are members of the family Polyomaviridae. BKV and JCV are ubiquitous in human populations
worldwide with a seroprevalence in adults of 70%-80%
[1-4]. They establish persistent, latent infections and are
capable of reactivating in immunosuppressed hosts [5-7].
BKV in particular is recognized as a significant cause of
allograft failure in renal transplant recipients [8]. In
addition, these viruses may also be associated with renal
dysfunction in nonrenal transplant recipients [9,10]. Prospective monitoring of patients at risk for BKV-associated
nephropathy (BKVAN) or BKV associated morbidity may
identify those patients with active infection before renal
function deteriorates [11-13]. Early identification of active
BK infection in transplant recipients is advantageous for

controlling BKV replication and preventing BKVAN via
reduction of immunosuppression or use of cidofovir antiviral therapy [14,15].
BKV screening protocols and quantitative BKV testing
are increasingly performed in molecular virology laboratories. Guidelines for quantitative cutoffs for nucleic
acid tests for BK viruria and BK viremia that indicate
the need for additional clinical testing were proposed in
2005 [5]. However, the usefulness of these cutoffs is
hampered by the lack of standardized assays, uniform
external viral standard, the existence of viral subtypes
and the presence of viral polymorphisms. Primers and
probes developed for quantitative BKV testing based on
limited available sequence data from few viral isolates
suffer reduced performance in detection of viral isolates
with sequence variations in these regions. This in turn
can lead to inconsistent detection of virus, inaccurate
quantitation of viral load and difficulty comparing
results between assays.

We describe an approach for the development of a
stable nucleic acid assay when limited nucleotide
sequence information is available. We report that interspecies amino acid and nucleotide sequence analysis, in
conjunction with intraspecies nucleotide sequence alignment, can elucidate genomic regions that may be under
potential functional constraints and that these regions
can be targeted for primer and probe design to improve
assay performance.

Results
Intraspecies nucleotide sequence variation analysis of BK
viral genes

The initial step in identifying a stable region of the BK
viral genome for assay development was nucleotide
sequence variation analysis of the BK virus (BKV) genes,
performed on 157 to 160 BKV isolates using ClustalW2
[16] and MUSCLE [17] analyses. The total number of
polymorphisms per gene based on multiple nucleotide
sequence alignments for the six BKV genes is given in
Table 1. These analyses show that sequence variants are
widespread throughout the BKV genome and occur in all
6 viral genes. Of note, in comparison to most other areas
of the BKV genome, there were substantially fewer
sequence variants corresponding to the C-terminus of the
VP2 gene. The distribution of sequence variants in the
C-terminus region of the VP2 is presented in Figure 1.
Several regions of the BKV genome demonstrated
either 100% homology or limited to minor mismatches
among the BKV isolates being compared. These regions,
including sections of the C-terminal helicase domain of
the Large-T antigen, sections of the N-terminal heat
shock protein DNA-J of the Large-T antigen, sections of
the N-terminus of the VP2 gene, and sections of the Cterminus of the VP2/VP3 gene, were considered equally
suitable targets for assay development at this stage.

regions in Polyomaviridae family members

develop supporting evidence for the sequence stability of
these regions, an interspecies amino acid sequence comparison of each of the regions was performed. Among the
four potential target regions, the VP2 C-terminus region
was distinguished from the others due to the presence of
a number of motifs and recognized structural elements
including: (1) an alpha helix at the C-terminus [18], (2) a
known VP1 interaction region in the C-terminus [18], (3)
a series of basic amino acid residues comprising a nuclear
localization signal (NLS) [19-22], (4) a DNA binding
region [23,24] and (5) a shared open reading frame due
to the overlap with the N-terminus of VP1 [25,26]. Examination of members of the Polyomaviridae family
revealed that the VP2 C-terminus region and the alphahelical region in particular, are conserved across multiple
members of the Polyomaviridae family, suggestive of a
region under a high degree of structural and functional
constraint (Figure 2). It also confirmed previous observations [18] that the residues downstream of the alphahelix region exhibit more variability across members of
the Polyomaviridae family. Lastly, members of the Polyomaviridae family that are more closely related to BKV
(i.e. JCV, Simian Agent [SA]12, and SV40) exhibit
stretches of amino acids downstream of the alpha-helical
region that are also conserved (Figure 2). The degree of
sequence conservation in the VP2 C-terminus region and
the presence of known structural and functional elements
suggest a reduced likelihood of sequence variation. In
addition, a section of the VP2 C-terminus, (residues 324330, SRGSSQK), is conserved in BKV, SV40, and SA12,
but absent in JCV. Taken together, these results support
the C-terminus of VP2 as a sequence stable target for
assay development that could also be specific for BKV,
relative to JCV.
Interspecies and intraspecies comparison of nucleotide
sequences of the assay target region

The regions of the VP2 C-terminus identified by amino
acid alignment were further analyzed by intraspecies
sequence analysis of JCV isolates and interspecies
nucleotide sequence alignment among very closely
related viruses (Figure 1). This enabled cross species
comparison of the relative locations of polymorphisms
within the selected target region. Focus was primarily
directed at comparing the BKV and JCV sequences as
they are clinically important viruses that are taxonomically closely related and there were a considerably
greater number of sequences available for JCV.
Intraspecies nucleotide sequence analysis of the VP2
gene identified several stretches of conserved codons
among BKV isolates (Figure 1). The nucleotide sequence 1
to 135 (residues 272-316, Figure 2) is conserved among
BKV sequences, containing only three polymorphic positions. These polymorphisms represent synonymous

isolates relative to the reference sequence are shown below the JCV reference sequence. The guanine at position 150 (bold) is replaced by
cytosine in six out of 487 JCV isolates. The locations of polymorphisms among 271 BKV isolates are shown below the BKV reference sequence
and the number of BKV isolates with that particular set of polymorphism(s) is given in brackets. The positions of the primers (underlined) and
probe (boxed) are indicated on the BKV reference sequence. There are no observed polymorphisms at the Polyoma_4.2(f) forward primer in
either BKV or JCV sequences available at this time. There are no known polymorphisms at the relative position of the BKV_MGB probe (boxed)
among either the BKV isolates or JCV isolates. There are three nucleotide differences between JCV and BKV at the probe binding site. There are
three nucleotide differences between SV40 and BKV at the BKV_5.1(r) reverse primer binding site.

Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the VP2/VP3 C-terminus was constructed using ClustalW2 from reference sequences of 17 different
members of the Polyomaviridae family. BKV, JCV, SV40 and SA12 sequences were compared and residues that are conserved between at least
three out of these four closely related members of the Polyomaviridae family are indicated in bold. The alpha-helix region of the BKV VP2/VP3
gene is shown in red. The location of the primers (underlined) and the probe (boxed) are indicated. The region in the BKV VP2/VP3 gene having
two reading frames due to the overlap with the N-terminus of the VP1 gene is indicated in blue. The NLS and DNA binding region are located
downstream of the alpha helix sequence. Residues are numbered according to the reference sequence for the BKV VP2 gene (YP_717937.1).

mutations at Glu (residue 274) and Leu (residue 297) and
a non-synonymous mutation at residue 312 (Tyr to Cys).
Two other stretches of conserved nucleotides were
observed: the stretch of 36 nucleotides 145 to 180 corresponding to KRRVSRGSSQKA (residues 320-331,
Figure 2) and the stretch of 33 nucleotides 211 to 243 corresponding to NKRRSRSSR (residues 342-351, Figure 2)
and stop codon. Polymorphisms were not observed among
available BKV sequences for these latter two regions.
Interspecies nucleotide comparison of known polymorphic sites in VP2 between BKV and JCV revealed a
stretch of 41 nucleotides 55 to 95 that is devoid of
polymorphisms aside for a single polymorphism for
BKV at nucleotide 78. This stretch of nucleotides
corresponds to the alpha-helix region and the three
adjacent up-stream residues APQWMLPLLLGLYG
(residues 290-303, Figure 2). With the exception of a
single nucleotide polymorphism at position 9, the
sequence upstream of nucleotide position 55 is conserved among BKV sequences. However, a significant
number of polymorphic sites are observed among the
corresponding JCV nucleotide sequences.
Based on these results, primers and probe were
designed targeting the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the VP2 C-terminus region (Figure 1).
Design of PCR assay primers and probe

The assay forward primer (Polyoma_4.2 [sense strand])
was designed to correspond to nucleotides 55 to 75 of
BKV sequence (Figure 1), which contains the codons for
part of the alpha-helix region. No polymorphisms were
observed within BKV or JCV or between BKV and JCV
sequences. An alternate forward primer (BKV_2.1 [sense
strand]) was designed corresponding to nucleotides 30
to 51 of BKV sequence (Figure 1). This sequence reflects
a region of interspecies amino acid conservation among
BKV, JCV, SV40 and SA12 reference strains (residues
281 to 288, Figure 2). Although the nucleotide analyses
indicate it is conserved among the available BKV isolates, this stretch of nucleotides display multiple polymorphisms among the available JCV sequences.
The assay reverse primer (BKV_5.1 [anti-sense strand])
was designed to correspond to nucleotide sequences 150
to 167 of the BKV sequence (Figure 1). This sequence
contains the codons for amino acid residues SRGS (residues 324-327, Figure 2) that are deleted in JCV. No polymorphisms are observed along this stretch of nucleotides
among the available BKV sequences. Three consecutive
nucleotide differences exist between the BKV and SV40
reference sequences within the primer (Figure 1). An
alternate reverse primer (BKV_4.1 [anti-sense strand])
was designed corresponding to nucleotides 103 to 125 of
the BKV sequence (Figure 1). There is a single polymorphism within BKV isolates in the primer sequence,

Page 4 of 10

resulting in use of the universal deoxyinosine nucleotide
at the corresponding position in the primer. Several polymorphisms were observed between BKV and JCV reference sequences corresponding to this primer.
The probe sequence (BKV-MGB Probe [anti-sense
strand]) corresponds to nucleotide sequences 80 to 95
(Figure 1). This sequence contains the codons for the
alpha-helix residues LLGLYG, conserved in the SA12,
SV40, JCV and BKV (Figure 2). There are a total of
three nucleotide differences between BKV and JCV
reference sequences at the probe binding site (Figure 1)
and this difference is present in all BKV and JCV isolates. No polymorphisms in the probe sequence were
observed between BKV and SV40 reference sequences.
The nucleotide comparisons described above allowed
design of a combination of primers and probes that targets a sequence stable region yet provides specificity for
BKV relative to JCV and SV40.
Development and validation of a real-time quantitative
PCR assay for the VP2 region of BK virus

Once a stable region of the BKV genome was identified,
a real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed. Serial
dilution experiments were undertaken to evaluate assay
performance. The BKV assay was linear over a 6-log
range from 107 copies/reaction to 101 copies/reaction
(Figure 3).
The sensitivity of the BKV assay was evaluated by testing a BKV standard (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., MD)
at known concentrations of 1.5, 15, 75 and 150 copies/
reaction. Analytical sensitivity was determined by the
lowest serial dilution consistently detectable in replicate
reactions. The assay detected BKV with 100% (30/30)
sensitivity at BKV copy levels of 15 copies/reaction and
greater (Table 2). BKV at a copy level of 1.5 copies/reaction was detected in 2 to 3 of 10 replicates (20-30%).
Therefore the analytical sensitivity of the assay is
15 copies/reaction, which is equivalent to 450 copies/ml
given a 200 μl extraction volume and an elution volume
of 60 μl. The lower limit of detection of the assay, which
is detectable but not reliably quantifiable, is 1.5 copies/
reaction.
The specificity of the BKV assay was evaluated by testing replicates of JCV DNA standard (Advanced Biotechnologies) at concentrations of 1.4 × 10 4 copies/
reaction and mixed samples containing BKV at various
concentrations combined with JCV at 7 × 103 copies/
reaction compared to the same concentrations of BKV
without any JCV present. No false positive results (0/10)
were observed when testing JCV samples (Table 3). In
addition, no inhibition of BKV detection in the presence
of JCV was observed, as crossing point (Cp) values for
BKV in mixed samples with JCV were similar for the
same concentrations of BKV alone.

replicates for all concentrations were tested. The coefficient of variation (CV) in the Cp for all concentrations
tested was ≤ 2.3% (Table 4), verifying a high degree of
assay precision across the entire range of concentrations
tested.

Discussion
There have been previous efforts to develop real-time
PCR based BKV quantification assays [27,28]. However,
many of these assays were developed when the number
of available DNA sequences in public databases was
quite limited. Although multiple sequence alignments
are routinely used to identify stable target regions for

assay development, sequence variants have been
observed in these regions as more strains and sequences
become available. Therefore, when the number of isolates and sequences is limited, merely selecting a target
region for assay development based on intraspecies
nucleotide sequence alignments alone may not be sufficiently predictive of interstrain sequence conservation to
result in a sensitive and specific assay.
We proposed that identifying areas of the genome that
are conserved within and between species could be used
to supplement limited nucleotide sequence information
when designing assays. Target regions identified via
standard intraspecies sequence alignment of full genome
sequences from available isolates were further evaluated
by interspecies amino acid analysis to select a single target region. The interspecies amino acid alignments
assisted in narrowing down potential target regions by
identifying areas containing functionally and/or structurally constrained sequences. Conservation in amino acid

*5 replicates of negative control were all negative.

sequence among closely related viruses does not necessarily preclude the possibility of non-synonymous substitutions. Functional and structural constraints, however,
do suggest that there would likely be fewer number of
amino acid residues that can reside at that particular
position than if the same region was under less stringent
functional or structural constraint.
However, mutations in the nucleotide sequences giving rise to synonymous substitutions can potentially
have equally adverse effects on the performance of a
PCR assay. Possible mechanisms for constraints limiting
synonymous mutations may include overlapping reading
frames, especially if those overlapping regions are functionally or structurally important. Identifying potential
cold spots in the genome that are less likely to undergo
synonymous substitutions is a significant challenge and
a major obstacle to developing a robust PCR-based viral
assay. Intra-species nucleotide alignment of available
BKV sequences was followed by detailed intra- and
interspecies nucleotide analysis of the target region to
aid in designing assay primers and probe.
In the present work, the utilization of the intraspecies
nucleotide alignment of BKV with the intraspecies nucleotide alignment of a closely related virus, JCV, for which a
significant number of sequences were available, proved to
be useful in substantiating that the Polyoma_4.2(f) and the
BKV-MGB probe binding regions within BKV was less
likely to experience nucleotide sequence variation. The
lack of polymorphisms at the corresponding positions in
both BKV and JCV isolates provides stronger evidence for
sequence conservation than does intra-species nucleotide
analysis of BKV isolates alone. Conversely, the forward primer BKV_2.1(f) is reserved for use only as a secondary
backup to Polyoma_4.2(f) due to the extent of polymorphisms seen among JCV isolates along the nucleotide stretch
corresponding to the BKV_2.1(f) binding site.
Since the assay was first developed using ~160 BKV
sequences, the number of available BKV complete genome sequences increased to 271 (Additional file 1). As
presented in the results section, the increase in BKV

sequence data did not demonstrate increased sequence
variation in the region targeted by this analysis, validating the approach of incorporating the additional analyses discussed herein when designing a real-time PCR
assay.
The amino acid and nucleotide sequence analyses that
were performed identified the VP2 C-terminus as a
probable functionally conserved region, consistent with
the presence of an alpha-helix [18] and nuclear localization signal [19-22]. Targeting the VP2 gene for assay
development is in contrast to the location of primers/
probes for most existing BKV assays [27]. Therefore this
approach was successful in identifying a region different
from those targeted by other assays that have become
limited with the recognition of additional sequence
variations.
Using functionally constrained regions for assay development might be expected to result in lack of specificity. However, sufficient nucleotide differences existed
within the stable region to design an assay specific for
BKV. The three nucleotide difference between the BKV
and JCV at the probe binding site was sufficient to meet
assay specificity requirements by utilizing a Taqman®MGB probe. By having the probe bind to the anti-sense
strand, the respective positions of the inter-species
nucleotide differences between the BKV and JCV were
such that the minor groove binder of the Taqman®MGB probe could be ideally positioned to provide a
high degree of specificity. This configuration also provided the added benefit of having the probe bind to the
same strand (anti-sense) as the BK virus specific reverse
primer rather than on the sense strand that binds the
Polyoma_4.2(f) primer, which amplifies both JCV and
BKV. It should be noted that the primer combination
BKV_5.1(r) and Polyoma_4.2(f) is the only primer combination that has been designed and tested to perform
under a BKV and JCV co-infection scenario.
Preliminary assay performance results indicate the
BKV assay has a 6-log dynamic range, a lower detection
limit of 1.5 × 101 copies/reaction and an intra-assay CV

Iwaki et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:295
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/295

of ≤ 5.0%. Good precision is important for distinguishing between assay variation and assay results that are
associated with clinical treatment or indicative of the
need for treatment. A wide dynamic range is significant
for clinical application of the assay since the clinical
need is for identification of patients with high viral load
who may be at immediate risk for developing BKVAN
and also for identification of low viral loads in patients
being monitored for BKV reactivation. The assay also
does not detect JCV and the presence of JCV does not
inhibit detection of BKV at the concentrations tested,
suggesting that accurate detection and quantitative
results for BKV will be obtained for BKV clinical samples that are co-infected with JCV.
The relative lack of sequence variants in the VP2 gene
suggests that an assay targeting this region will permit
accurate detection of BKV and estimates of viral load
regardless of subtype (Additional file 2). Such information is important in identifying active BKV infections in
transplant recipients in time to initiate appropriate
treatment. Further testing of this BKV assay is needed
to fully characterize assay performance characteristics,
clinical performance and to evaluate the impact of
sequence variations.

Conclusion
Identifying stable PCR target regions when limited DNA
sequence data is available is possible by combining multiple analysis techniques to elucidate genomic regions
under functional and structural constraints. Applying
this approach to the development of a real-time quantitative PCR assay for BKV resulted in an accurate
method with potential clinical applications and advantages over existing BK assays.
Methods
Sequence alignments: Amino Acid & DNA

A total of 185 amino acid sequences for the BKV VP2
gene were obtained from the NCBI database. The amino
acid sequences of the VP2 genes for the other members
of the family Polyomaviridae were collected for species in
which the information was available. Multiple sequence
alignment of the amino acid sequence of the VP2 gene
was performed using ClustalW2 http://www.ebi.ac.uk.
At the time of preliminary assay development, a total
of 160 nucleotide sequences of the Agno protein, 159
nucleotide sequences of the large-T antigen, 157 nucleotide sequences of the small-T antigen, and 159 nucleotide sequences of the three structural genes, VP1, VP2,
and VP3 were obtained from the NCBI database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Multiple alignments for the
sequences of the six respective genes were performed
using ClustalW2 http://www.ebi.ac.uk and MUSCLE
http://www.ebi.ac.uk.

Page 8 of 10

The entire amplicon sequence was input into the
BLAST software http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov to conduct
species-specific searches and to analyze intra-species
polymorphisms as well as interspecies sequence variation amongst closely related, clinically significant viruses.
The BLAST search and results formatting were adjusted
according to the number of available sequences within
the database for each specific species. The results were
formatted with inquiry sequence anchored with stars for
identity to generate a multiple sequence alignment of
the BLAST results.
Oligonucleotides

The theoretical Tm calculations as well as secondary
structure and primer-dimer analysis for oligonucleotides
were performed using OligoCalc [29] & Primer3 [30].
The Tm under the actual reaction conditions was confirmed empirically. The need for a probe was confirmed
by empirically testing for primer-dimer formation using
the LightCycler®480 SYBR Green I Master reagent as
well as post-amplification gel-electrophoresis.
Primers were purchased from Invitrogen Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). Two forward and two reverse primers were
designed to amplify the C-terminus region of the VP2/3
gene. The BKV_5.1(r) comprised the primary reverse primer of the assay while the BKV_4.1(r) was utilized as an
alternate. The reverse primer denoted as BKV_5.1(r)
comprises the nucleotide sequence 5’-CTG CCC CTG
GAC ACT CTC-3’. The reverse primer denoted as
BKV_4.1(r) has the sequence 5’-TCA (I)AT GCT TCA
AGA GCA GGT GT-3’, wherein the nucleotide (I) represents deoxyinosine. The nucleotide sequence of the two
forward primers denoted as Polyoma_4.2(f) and BKV_2.1
(f) are 5’-GCT CCT CAA TGG ATG TTG CCT-3’ and
5’-CCC AGG AGG TGC TAA TCA AAG A-3’, respectively. The Polyoma_4.2(f) comprised the primary forward primer of the assay while the BKV_2.1(f) was
utilized as an alternate.
TaqMan®-MGB probes were supplied by Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). The BKV probe denoted
as BKV-MGB probe (5’-6FAM-CCG TAC AGG CCT
AGA A-MGB-NFQ-3’) was tagged with 6FAM™ at the
5’-end and tagged with a MGBNFQ (Minor Groove Binder/Non-fluorescent quencher) at the 3’-end. The JCV
probe denoted as JCV-MGB probe (5’-VIC-CGT ACA
ACC CTA AAA G-MGB-NFQ-3’) was tagged with VIC®
at the 5’-end and MGBNFQ (Minor Groove Binder/
Non-fluorescent quencher) at the 3’-end.
Viral DNA Standards

The BKV (strain MM) and JCV (strain MAD1) DNA
standards were obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies
Inc. (Columbia, MD), supplied at 1-2 × 10 5 DNA
copies/μl. Viral standard at 1.5 × 10 6 DNA copies/μl

were produced from clinical BKV isolates using TOPO®
TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen Inc., CA, U.S.A.). Cloned
viral DNA was quantified on the Roche LightCycler®480
using the commercially purchased standard.
Quantitative real-time PCR

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Roche
LightCycler®480 instrument. PCR amplification was run
in a final volume of 40 μl per reaction comprising 30 μl
of PCR master mix and 10 μl of sample, standard or
PCR-grade water. PCR master mix for one reaction
comprised of: 0.42 μM forward primer, 0.42 μM of
reverse primer, 0.33 μM of TaqMan®-MGB probe, and
20 μl of LightCycler® 480 Probes Master (2×).
Thermal cycling conditions when using the reverse
primer BKV_4.1 were as follows: pre-incubation at 95°C
for 10 minutes; 45 cycles of a three-step PCR wherein
one cycle comprising of 95°C for 10 seconds (ramp rate
4.4°C/s), 60°C for 15 seconds (ramp rate 2.2°C/s) and
72°C for 1 second (ramp rate 4.4°C/s); and ending with
a cool down step at 40°C for 30 seconds. Fluorescence
was measured at each cycle following the third step at
72°C.

using the LightCycler® 480 software.
Performance characterization of assay

Specificity testing. Specificity data were generated by
testing analytical samples containing BKV, JCV and
mixed samples containing both BKV and JCV. Serial
dilutions of BKV to result in from 1.5 × 101 copies/reaction to 1.5 × 107 copies/reaction were tested individually
(2 replicates of each concentration) and in the presence
of 7 × 103 copies/reaction of JCV (10 replicates of each
concentration). JCV at 1.4 × 10 4 copies/reaction (10
replicates) was also tested individually. A total of 94 specificity samples were tested. Five replicates of a negative
control were also tested.
Analytical sensitivity evaluation. Analytical sensitivity
samples comprised of BKV at concentrations of 150, 75,
15 and 1.5 copies/reaction were used to evaluate assay

sensitivity. The BKV samples were prepared by serial
dilution of a BKV standard. A total of 120 samples, 10
replicates of each concentration with 3 primer combinations, were tested in the assay. Five replicates of a negative control were also tested.
Assay Precision. The intra-assay precision of the BKV
assay was evaluated. The samples were constructed by
serial dilution of BKV standard and contained from 1.5

of the BKV standard were tested with 3 primer combinations in one run and the variance in the Cp (crossing
point) calculated to determine the reproducibility of the
assay. A total of 210 samples were tested. Five replicates
of a negative control were also tested.
