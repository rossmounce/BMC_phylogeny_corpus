Abstract
Background -: Fas ligand is a cytotoxic effector molecule of T and NK cells which is characterized
by an intracellular N-terminal polyproline region that serves as a docking site for SH3 and WW
domain proteins. Several previously described Fas ligand-interacting SH3 domain proteins turned
out to be crucial for the regulation of storage, expression and function of the death factor. Recent
observations, however, indicate that Fas ligand is also subject to posttranslational modifications
including shedding and intramembrane proteolysis. This results in the generation of short
intracellular fragments that might either be degraded or translocate to the nucleus to influence
transcription. So far, protein-protein interactions that specifically regulate the fate of the
intracellular fragments have not been identified.
Results -: In order to further define the SH3 domain interactome of the intracellular region of Fas
ligand, we now screened a human SH3 domain phage display library. In addition to known SH3
domains mediating binding to the Fas ligand proline-rich domain, we were able to identify a number
of additional SH3 domains that might also associate with FasL. Potential functional implications of
the new binding proteins for the death factor's biology are discussed. For Tec kinases and sorting
nexins, the observed interactions were verified in cellular systems by pulldown experiments.
Conclusion -: We provide an extended list of putative Fas ligand interaction partners, confirming
previously identified interactions, but also introducing several novel SH3 domain proteins that
might be important regulators of Fas ligand function.

Background
Protein-protein interactions link signal transduction pathways from receptors to the nucleus and govern intracellular processes as diverse as organelle targeting, directional
transport, cytoskeletal reorganization, membrane positioning, endo- and exocytosis and protein degradation.
Protein-protein interactions are mostly mediated by modular domains with the best studied examples being Src

homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains [1]. SH3 domains are
phylogenetically highly conserved protein interaction
modules that comprise 50 to 70 amino acids and are
found in a variety of functionally unrelated proteins. As
typical interaction modules, they fold into a similar globular structure. Most SH3 domains bind proline residues in
a certain arrangement (e.g. PxxP) in so-called "prolinerich domains" (PRD) [2,3].

Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L, Apo-1L, CD178) is a type II
transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor
superfamily that acts as a prototypic death factor of
immune cells [4,5]. FasL is employed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells to kill virusinfected or tumorigenic cells. It is implicated in the downregulation of immune responses by activation-induced
cell death, the establishment of immune privilege, and in
the modulation of T cell activation [6-8]. FasL is stored in
so-called secretory lysosomes and is recruited to the
immunological synapse in an activation-restricted fashion. Its surface expression is down-modulated by shedding through a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)
10 activity and intramembrane proteolysis by the γ-secretase-like protease SPPL2a (signal peptide peptidase-like
2a). The released intracellular domain may translocate to
the nucleus or be prepared for degradation [9-11].

Different experimental approaches have already led to the
identification of several FasL-interacting proteins including Src-related tyrosine kinases (Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck, Fgr,
Src, and Abl), adapter proteins involved in T cell receptor
(TCR)-associated signal transduction (Grb2, Gads, p85
subunit of PI3 kinase, Nck) and members of the Pombe
Cdc15 homology (PCH) protein family (protein kinase C
and casein kinase substrate in neurons 1-3 (PACSIN1-3),
Formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17), Cdc42-interacting
protein 4 (CIP4), CD2-binding protein 1 (CD2BP1), Rho
GTPase-activating protein 4 (ARHGAP4), Fer/CIP4homology (FCH) and double SH3 domains 1 (FCHSD1)
and SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase-activating protein 2) [1216]. Many aspects of FasL biology are indeed closely
linked to PRD-SH3 domain interactions: members of the
PCH family regulate lysosomal association [16,17], tyrosine kinases are involved in reverse signaling and sorting
of human FasL to multivesicular bodies [18,19], and the
adapter protein Nck is crucial to bring FasL loaded vesicles
to the immunological synapse [20].

The FasL N-terminus comprises a unique PRD that contains several putative SH3 domain binding sites (Fig 1).

The aim of the present study was to get an idea about the
complete FasL-SH3 domain interactome and to define
interactors that could be involved in the translocation of
FasL to the nucleus or in the priming of N-terminal fragments (NTF) for degradation. We used a phage display
library that covers the entire human SH3 domain proteome to screen for interactions with the FasL N-terminus.
We confirmed several previously identified interactions
and introduce a number of SH3 domain proteins as novel
candidate FasL binding partners. These include additional
non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. the Tec kinases), sorting nexins and other cytosolic or nuclear adapter proteins
that could be involved in the intracellular trafficking of
FasL or FasL fragments.

Methods
Production of a recombinant GST-hFasL fusion protein
Affinity purification of Glutathione S-transferase (GST)
and the GST-hFasL(1-80) fusion protein was performed as
previously described [14]. Briefly, an overnight culture of
transformed bacteria was diluted in fresh LB-Amp
medium and incubated for 1.5 h before induction of protein expression by 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h. Bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in PBS and lysed by sonification and addition
of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and Glutathion 4B sepharose beads (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) were added to the clear
lysate and rotated at 4°C. For elution of bound fusion
protein, reduced glutathion was used. The eluates were
concentrated and washed with PBS by centrifugation in
Amicon® filter units (Millipore, Billerica, USA).
Bacteria and Phages
Heat-shock competent E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen Carlsbad,
USA) were propagated according to standard procedures.
The E. coli strain TG1 was from Stratagene (La Jolla, USA).
Isolated colonies of E. coli TG1 were picked from M9
plates and expanded in M9 plus medium with high glucose. The next day, the equivalent of OD (λ = 600 nm) =
0.05 was used to inoculate 50 ml sterile LB medium and
bacteria were cultivated at 37°C. Transduction competence of E. coli TG1 cells was checked by infection with
M13K08 helper phages (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
USA) conferring kanamycin resistance. For the screening
of SH3 domains binding to FasL, we used the "All SH3
Domain Phager" library from GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany). In this library, expression-optimized coding
sequences from all conventional human SH3 domains are
inserted in frame to the coat protein pVIII ORF into the
phagemid vector pG8JH by BssHII- and NotI-mediated
restriction. As a selection marker, the corresponding
phagemid vectors contain a β-lactamase gene.

Phage display library screening
GST-hFasL(1-80) fusion protein or GST as a control were
covalently bound to epoxy-functionalized magnetic beads
following the provided protocol (Dynabeads® M-270
epoxy, Invitrogen). For all washing and separation steps,
the beads solution was placed in a magnetic bead separator (Dynal/Invitrogen) and unbound supernatants were
carefully removed. Binding of the protein to the beads was
done overnight at 4°C with slow rotation. The protein
solution was removed, blocking buffer was added, and the
beads were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The
beads were washed extensively with PBS and finally resuspended in 200 μl phage solution (6 × 109 plaque-forming units (PFU)) with blocking buffer and incubated at
room temperature. After binding of phages to beads (1.5
h at room temperature), samples were washed extensively.
The supernatant was removed and phages were eluted
from the beads. This solution was neutralized and phage
eluates were serially diluted with sterile LB medium. For
each transduction, 500 μl TG1 cells were shaken at 37°C
for 10 min. After addition of 5 μl diluted phages, the samples were briefly vortexed and incubated for 30 min at
37°C without shaking. 100 μl of each sample were then
plated on SOBAG plates and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Colonies were counted and phage titers in eluates were
determined. In order to optimize the binding specificity,
low (0.15%) and high (0.50%) concentrations of Tween20 in washing and blocking buffers were compared.
Preparation of phagemid DNA, sequencing, and
identification of interacting SH3 domains
E. coli clones were propagated in 5 ml LB-Amp medium.
Phagemid DNA was isolated using NucleoSpin® (BD,
Franklin Lanes, USA) or QIAPrep® (Qiagen, Hilden, GER)
kits following the manufacturer's protocols. SH3 domain
coding regions were sequenced using J-55 (5'-CCTATTGCCTACGGCAGCC-3') and H-301 (5'-CAGGGAGTCAAAGGCCGCTTTTGC-3') sequencing primers and the
BigDye® Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems/Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (Genetic Analyser 3130, Applied Biosystems/Hitachi). Sequence analysis was done using the
VectorNTI 10 software suite (Invitrogen). Individual
sequences were translated in silico and SH3 domains were
identified by BLAST using Swiss-Prot servers.
Verification of selected SH3 domain-FasL interactions
For verification of the Itk SH3 domain-FasL interaction,
pulldown experiments using recombinant GST-SH3
domain fusion proteins were performed from stably FasL
expressing KFL9 and JFL39.1 cell lines as described previously [20]. Interactions of full length SNX9, SNX18 and
SNX33 with FasL were verified in HEK 293 T cells. To this
end, cells were transfected with HA-tagged expression
constructs of the respective sorting nexins (kindly pro-

vided by S. F. Lichtenthaler, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DNZE) - Munich & Adolf-ButenandtInstitute, LMU Munich) by calcium phosphate precipitation. 18 h post transfection, cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis
buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates
were subjected overnight to precipitation with GSThFasL(1-80) fusion protein and glutathione sepharose
beads. Beads were washed four times with NP-40 lysis
buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blot
using anti-HA mAb 3F10 (Roche Applied Science, Basel,
Switzerland).

Results and discussion
In its proline-rich domain (PRD), the human FasL contains several putative SH3 domain binding sites. Previous
studies have employed different strategies to screen for
FasL interaction partners, including yeast two-hybrid
assays, peptide- and recombinant SH3 domain-based
experiments as well as proteomic screens of FasL precipitates from T cells and neuronal cells [12-16]. We now
screened a human SH3 domain phage display library, covering the entire human SH3 proteome with 288 conventional SH3 domains.
In order to obtain phage clones binding the FasL N-terminus, magnetic beads were coated with affinity-purified
GST-hFasL(1-80) fusion protein or GST as a control. The
beads were used to pan the phage display library as
described. Following binding, the beads were extensively
washed with buffer containing either 0.15% or 0.5%
Tween-20. It is important to mention that phage titers differed significantly depending on the detergent concentration. For less stringent washing conditions (0.15% Tween20), a titer of (2.85 ± 0.15) × 107 PFU/ml was calculated
in eluate obtained from the GST-panning, while the titer
following more stringent washing was (0.185 ± 0.075) ×
107 PFU/ml. Under the same conditions, eluates from
GST-hFasL(1-80) panned beads displayed titers of (1.59 ±
4.53) × 108 PFU/ml and (3.31 ± 0.6) × 107 PFU/ml,
respectively, showing that the specificity of phage-displayed SH3 domain-pVIII fusion proteins binding to the
hFasL(1-80) moiety was significantly increased at higher
stringency.
Using the phage display library approach, 49 human SH3
domains displayed in vitro binding to hFasL(1-80) (Table
1 and Fig 2). Of note, some SH3 domains were identified
only once in one of the two screenings, for instance the
tyrosine kinase Itk. In contrast, for other SH3 domains,
including those of CD2BP1, osteoclast stimulating factor
1 (OSTF1) and sorting nexin 33 (SNX33), several transduced clones were found. The number of hits, however,
does not necessarily reflect the binding specificity of SH3
domains to the hFasL PRD, since it cannot be guaranteed
that all 288 phage clones are represented in comparable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/10/53

amounts within the library. Of note, in the case of
CD2BP1, we detected a point-mutated residue within the
SH3 domain which was verified by the supplier and which
might have an impact on the affinity to target motifs.
Several of the detected interactions have been previously
described. These include FasL binding to SH3 domains of
non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Fyn, Hck, Lyn, and
Src. Notably, the Fyn SH3 domain has not only been the
first interaction module associated with FasL [12], but Fyn
and Lyn have recently been implicated in tyrosine phosphorylation of FasL associated with sorting to multivesicular bodies [18]. Furthermore, SH3 domains of the
adapter proteins Nck1 and Nck2 were found to bind
hFasL in our assay. In both cases, the interaction was
mediated by the second SH3 domain. This is partially in
line with our previous observation that Nck-binding to
FasL is mediated by the second and, although less efficiently, the third SH3 domain [13,20]. The missing reactivity of the third SH3 domain in the phage display screen
may be due to a lower representation of respective phages
in the library. Also, SH3 domains of the NADPH oxidase
subunit p47phox and the regulatory subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) were found to bind to the
FasL PRD as reported before [13]. Interactions of FasL
with members of the PCH protein family have been
described in different studies based on pulldown experiments, yeast two hybrid screens, and co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation of overexpressed proteins
[14,16,17]. Although we meanwhile know that several
members of different PCH protein subfamilies interact
with FasL, only the SH3 domains of CD2BP1 (Proline-serine-threonine
phosphatase-interacting
protein
1
(PSTPIP1) in mice) and SLIT-ROBO Rho GAP2 bound
hFasL(1-80) in the present study.
Phage display library screening is a convenient screening
method for the elucidation of possible in vitro proteinprotein interactions and avoids technical obstacles like for
instance a correct subcellular localization of bait and prey
constructs in yeast two-hybrid screening. This method,
however, also has its limitations due to the distribution of
individual phage clones within the library. Moreover, the
use of a bacterial host may influence the folding of the
respective prey protein. Also, all phage-encoded SH3domains are fusion proteins and thus their binding specificity may be altered. We assume that these limitations
hinder the identification of all FasL-SH3 domain interactions that have been previously described, for example
with other PCH proteins and SNX18 (see below).
Importantly, we identified several previously not
described putative interaction partners of the FasL N-terminal region. In addition to the non-receptor tyrosine
kinases mentioned before, the phage display library

Identification of FasL-interacting SH3 domains
Identification of FasL-interacting SH3 domains. Phagemid DNA from transduced clones was isolated and sequenced to
unambiguously identify the SH3 domains responsible for interactions with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (white) and GSThFasL(1-80) (black and grey), respectively. SH3 domains binding unspecifically to the GST moiety were identified by GST library
panning. Data are shown from individual experiments with low (0.15% Tween-20, A) and high (0.5% Tween-20, B) detergent
concentration. In B, dark and grey boxes show results from two individual panning rounds.

screen revealed that the Src-like kinase Yes as well the Tec
family kinases Tec and Itk might bind to hFasL. Although
Yes is expressed in a number of cells types, including T
cells [21], its actual involvement in T cell signal transduction and especially FasL phosphorylation still remains
elusive. Tec kinases constitute a well-characterized family
of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in a variety of signaling processes, predominantly
controlled by Src kinases. In particular, the involvement
of Itk in T cell development and activation has been highlighted over the past few years [22]. The interaction of Tec
kinases with FasL might therefore be interesting in the
context of primary T cell activation and is already subject
of further investigation. In a first series of pull-down
experiments, we used a GST fusion protein containing the

isolated Itk SH3 domain to verify FasL binding (Fig 3). As
shown before for other interactions [13], FasL was precipitated with Itk SH3 domains from lysates of stably FasL
expressing KFL9 cells as a doublet and from JFL39.1 cells
as a single band. Whether full length Tec family kinases
also interact with FasL, and whether there is a differential
binding to full length versus proteolytically processed
FasL remains to be assessed.
Several previously identified FasL interactors regulate the
subcellular localization of the death factor, and have been
implicated in its association with the lysosomal compartment or the transport of FasL-loaded secretory vesicles to
the immunological synapse [6,23]. In our phage display
screen, we identified the sorting nexins SNX9 and SNX33,

N-terminal fragments following shedding and/or intramembrane proteolysis. In the case of the sorting nexins, we
verified the interaction with the cytosolic region of FasL in
pull-down experiments performed from lysates of individually transfected 293 T cells. In this case, all three HAtagged sorting nexins (9, 18 and 33) were readily detected
by an anti-HA antibody in whole cell lysates and in precipitates with GST-hFasL(1-80) fusion proteins but not in
GST control precipitates (Fig 4). As for Tec kinases and
PCH proteins, future experiments will address the potential differential binding of individual interactors to full
length versus proteolytically processed FasL.

as well as endophilin A3 and intersectin-2 as potential
binding partners for FasL. All four proteins are involved in
membrane or vesicle trafficking and might therefore act as
co-regulators of FasL transport in T and NK cells. The
closely related SNX9 and SNX33 are members of the large
sorting nexin protein family which share a phosphoinositide-binding phox-homology (PX) domain and are
associated with various aspects of endocytic and endosomal sorting [24]. Together with SNX18, which was identified to interact with FasL in neuronal cells [17], SNX9
and SNX33 share a similar structural organization and are
thus grouped into the SNX9 subfamily of sorting nexins
[25]. The three proteins are widely expressed, even though
expression levels may vary between individual tissues and
cell types. In the context of FasL, the sorting nexins could
play a role during internalization and processing of FasL

Endophilins are cytosolic proteins that also contain N-terminal Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR domains) and C-terminal SH3 domains and are implicated in membrane
tubulation during endocytosis [26]. Endophilin A3
enhances amyloid precursor protein (APP) α-secretase
cleavage, possibly by inhibition of APP endocytosis [27].
Its role in endocytosis and APP shedding as well as its
probable association with ADAM proteases could make
endophilin A3 an interesting interaction partner of FasL in
the context of "re-internalization". Intersectin-2 is a
cytosolic adapter protein that, among other motifs, harbors five SH3 domains and a pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain for membrane association. It was also implicated
in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and apparently links
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-initiated actin
polymerization to TCR-induced endocytic processes
[28,29].
The PCH proteins SLIT-ROBO Rho GAP1, SLIT-ROBO
Rho GAP2 and SLIT-ROBO Rho GAP3 are coordinators of
cytoskeleton-associated membrane or organelle transport
processes. Both Rho and Cdc42 GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) were associated with migratory signal transduction in neuronal cells [30]. Similarly, the Rho GTPaseactivating protein 9 (ARHGAP9), which exhibits substantial GAP activity for Rac1 and Cdc42, was discussed to regulate adhesion of hematopoietic cells to extracellular
matrix proteins [31]. More recently, it was shown that
ArhGAP9 binds to ERK and p38 kinases and keeps these
proteins in an inactive state [32]. In view of recent data
from our group showing that reverse FasL signaling leads
to an inhibition of T cells associated with decreased MAPK
activity [8], the putative interaction of FasL with ArhGAP9
might be relevant for this aspect of FasL biology.
The myosin XV SH3 domain also bound FasL in this
phage display screen. Since myosins are actin-based
motor proteins, an association with the FasL N-terminus
could again suggest an impact on the transport of FasL or
FasL loaded vesicles. However, as shown for T cells from
myosin XV deficient mice, myosin XV seems to be dispensable for cytoxicity of murine cytotoxic T-lymphocytes

(SH3PXD2B) is a so far very poorly defined gene product.
It interacts with hFasL in vitro via its third and its fourth
SH3 domain. Only recently, this protein has been implicated in podosome formation of Src-transformed fibroblasts [37].

tested 18 hours post transfection in whole cell lysates (upper

(CTLs) [33]. Since it is currently still a matter of debate
whether FasL is actually stored in granzyme-/perforinloaded secretory lysosomes or in a separate cytotoxic compartment [34,35], it will be interesting to determine
whether myosin XV plays a role in the Nck-dependent
transport of FasL and its storage granules to the cell surface.
SPIN90 (SH3 protein interacting with Nck, 90 kDa) is a
cytoskeletal adapter protein with a single SH3 domain
that binds to the first and third SH3 domain of Nck via its
own proline motif. It contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) but is functionally associated with
cytosolic (re-)organization of the actin cytoskeleton, leading, for instance, to lamellopodia formation in COS-7
cells [36]. It also associates with dynamin, WASP, and the
Arp2/3 (actin-related proteins 2/3) complex and plays a
key role for myofibril and sarcomere assembly. The SH3
and PX domain containing adapter protein 2B

We also identified the SH3 domains of Fyn-binding protein (FYB)/adhesion and degranulation promoting
adapter protein (ADAP) and of Src kinase-associated
phosphoprotein 2 (SKAP2)/Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 55-related (SKAP55R) as putative FasL-interacting domains. FYB/ADAP is an adaptor protein involved
in TCR signaling and 'inside-out' activation of T cell
integrins and is expressed in various hematopoietic cells
except B cells [38-40]. Upon TCR engagement, FYB/ADAP
is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn and is recruited via SH2
domain binding to SLP-76 (SH2 domain containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa) in a signaling cluster with phosphorylated linker for T cell activation (LAT) and Gads. Via
an internal PRD, ADAP associates with SKAP1/SKAP55 or
SKAP2/SKAP55R. This complex allows for membranerecruitment of Rap1 which then triggers integrin activation crucial for lymphocyte extravasation as well as formation of immunological synapses. In addition, FYB/ADAP
also links the TCR signaling complex to the actin cytoskeleton [38-40]. Given that hFasL(1-80) potentially interacts
with FYB/ADAP as well as the SKAP2/SKAP55R SH3
domains, it will be of particular interest to test whether
this interaction can also be observed in CTLs and what
functional implications such an interaction might have
for FasL recruitment and expression.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the performed phage display library screening clearly confirmed the previous notion that the N-terminal PRD of FasL is rather promiscuous in terms of SH3
binding. Meanwhile, more than 50 putative interactors
have been named. Importantly, several protein families
clearly stick out of the gross of SH3 domain containing
proteins. These include classical cytosolic adapter proteins, non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, PCH proteins, and sorting nexins. On the other hand, given the
unusual length of the PRD, it may not be surprising to
find so many potential interactors for this region. In order
to understand the role of individual proteins in the context of FasL biology, we already biochemically verified the
interaction of FasL with several of the novel interactors,
including the Tec kinase Itk and the sorting nexins 9, 18
and 33. It is important to highlight that most if not all
studies performed so far on putative FasL interactors
revealed clear morphological phenotypes. We are thus
confident that the present study provides a new basis for
the further analysis of protein-protein interactions around
FasL. Besides defining the role of individual interactions,
one of the major tasks will be to determine which interac-

Figure functions of FasL-interacting SH3 domain proteins
Possible 5
Possible functions of FasL-interacting SH3 domain proteins. FasL transport, storage, surface expression and reverse
signaling depend on the proline-rich N-terminal region. Moreover, FasL is processed by ADAM10 generating an N-terminal
fragment (NTF) and subsequently RIPped by SPPL2a generating a free intracellular domain (ICD). This ICD might translocate
to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Although several known SH3 domain proteins have been implicated in FasL storage, transport and surface expression, it is largely unknown how exactly the intracellular translocation but also the retrograde
signal transduction or FasL degradation are mediated.

tion "dominates" in a given physiological context or cell
type. Here, we expect new insights into processes of endoand exocytic vesicular transport and the modulation of
signal transduction through FasL. Potential functions of
newly identified SH3 domain proteins interacting with
FasL are depicted in Fig 5. Given the stepwise proteolytic
processing of FasL and its translocation to the nucleus, it
has to be determined whether certain FasL interactors
selectively regulate the "late functions" of FasL.
