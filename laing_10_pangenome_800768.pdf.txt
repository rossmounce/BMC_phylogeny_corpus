Abstract
Background: The pan-genome of a bacterial species consists of a core and an accessory gene pool. The accessory
genome is thought to be an important source of genetic variability in bacterial populations and is gained through
lateral gene transfer, allowing subpopulations of bacteria to better adapt to specific niches. Low-cost and highthroughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an
opportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe a new online pangenome sequence analysis program, Panseq.
Results: Panseq was used to identify Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli K-12 genomic islands. Within a population
of 60 E. coli O157:H7 strains, the existence of 65 accessory genomic regions identified by Panseq analysis was
confirmed by PCR. The accessory genome and binary presence/absence data, and core genome and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of six L. monocytogenes strains were extracted with Panseq and hierarchically
clustered and visualized. The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum
parsimony (MP) trees, which were compared to the MP tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The
topology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven MLST loci.
The Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci
set among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it
also found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 loci E. coli O157:H7 SNP dataset.
Conclusion: Panseq determines the core and accessory regions among a collection of genomic sequences based
on user-defined parameters. It readily extracts regions unique to a genome or group of genomes, identifies SNPs
within shared core genomic regions, constructs files for use in phylogeny programs based on both the presence/
absence of accessory regions and SNPs within core regions and produces a graphical overview of the output.
Panseq also includes a loci selector that calculates the most variable and discriminatory loci among sets of
accessory loci or core gene SNPs.
Availability: Panseq is freely available online at http://76.70.11.198/panseq. Panseq is written in Perl.

Background
The field of genomics has blossomed as a result of the
fast rate of whole-genome sequence data acquisition.
The pace of genome data growth continues to increase
as the cost to acquire the data continues to decrease.

[2]. Although these “contigs” can stretch into the megabase-pair (Mb) range, the sequencing of an entire organism by any one of these techniques invariably leaves
gaps in the reassembled sequence [3]. The finishing of a
sequence requires gap-closure by sequencing of PCR
products and the resolution of sequencing errors.
Sequencing efforts are primarily driven by the discovery
of novel genes and, as gap closure is time-consuming
and expensive, many researchers now use un-finished
draft sequences of genomes in their analyses [4].
Tettelin et al. [5] used the term “pan-genome” to refer to
the full complement of genes within a bacterial species.
Comprising the pan-genome are the core complement of
genes common to all members of a species and a dispensable or accessory genome that is present in at least one
but not all members of a species. As more whole-genome
sequences of a species or group within a species become
available, the size of the pan-genome of that species or
group will usually increase, due to an increase in the number of accessory genes. Based on mathematical models, it
is predicted that new genes will be discovered within the
pan-genome of many free-living bacterial species even
after hundreds or possibly thousands of complete genome
sequences have been characterized [6]. While originally
applied to an entire species, any group of related strains
can be said to contain a “core” and “accessory” set of
genes. As such, tools that extract the new pieces of information from an extremely large pool of data and that can
be used to determine the pan-genome and its distribution
among strains will be invaluable in the study of genotypic
and phenotypic traits in bacterial populations.
Regardless of whether an investigator uses a draft or
finished sequence, software tools able to efficiently
extract relevant information are critical. A number of
programs have been designed to assist with the analysis
of DNA sequence data. These include programs
designed for multiple sequence alignments such as
CLUSTAL W [7], T-COFFEE [8] and MUSCLE [9]; programs for local sequence comparison including FASTA
[10] and BLAST [11]; and programs designed for wholegenome comparisons such as MUMmer [12], MAUVE
[13] and MISHIMA [14]. Pre-computed alignments of
completed genomes are available online from Web-ACT
[15] (which also allows up to five user-submitted comparisons), the map-viewer and gMap database features
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
[16], the MOSAIC web-server [17] and the prokaryotic
gene-order database PSAT [18].
Programs designed specifically to find mobile genomic
islands as opposed to regions of differing sequence
between or among genomes using comparative genomic
approaches include MobilomeFINDER [19] and IslandPick [20]. Three programs offering in silico subtractive
hybridization among genomes using BLAST are available:

Page 2 of 14

FindTarget [21], mGenomeSubtractor [22] and nWayComp [23]. See Additional File 1 for a comparison of
features among many of these programs.
Despite the myriad program options available, there is
no comprehensive package for pan-genome analysis.
Prior to the advent of the current generation of sequencing platforms, the number of genome sequences available for intra-species comparative genomic analysis and
for the determination of “accessory” genes was limiting;
consequently, tools specifically designed for the analysis
of the pan-genome have not been available.
Most studies have used one or two reference genomes,
which include the core elements but are missing much
of the accessory genome of the species in study. In the
laboratory, selective subtractive hybridization [24,25]
and population surveys using microarray comparative
genomics [26,27] have been used to examine/define
accessory genome content. With the current explosion
in availability of whole-genome draft sequences, it
would be highly desirable to exploit this information
through in silico analysis to separate the novel accessory
component of the genome from previously identified
core sequence without the requirement for a finished
assembly. Identifying novel accessory sequences in this
way has application in characterizing novel metabolic
pathways, virulence attributes [28], and molecular
fingerprinting targets useful in epidemiological and
population genetic studies [29]. Finally, both the core
and accessory genomes can be helpful in elucidating the
evolutionary history of organisms [30].
In this study we describe a pan-genome sequence analysis program, Panseq, that extracts novel regions with
respect to a sequence or group of sequences, determines
the core and accessory regions of sequences based on
sequence identity and segmentation length parameters,
creates files based on the core and accessory genome for
use in phylogeny programs and determines the most
discriminatory and variable set of loci from a dataset.
We also report the validation of Panseq outputs using
PCR experiments and comparisons to previously
published genome sequence analyses.
Implementation

The pan-genome sequence analysis program (Panseq)
was written in Perl with BioPerl [31] modules and is
available at http://76.70.11.198/panseq. As a web-server
it is platform independent and makes use of the NCBI
Genbank database for pre-existing nucleotide FASTA
files. The Perl scripts are available for standalone use by
contacting the author.
Novel Region Finder (NRF)

The NRF module compares an input sequence(s) to a
database of sequence(s), and contiguous regions not

Laing et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:461
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/461

present in the database but present in a user-defined
combination of input sequences are extracted. This is
accomplished using the MUMmer alignment program
[12] with the “novel” sequences extracted into a file
with sequence location information added to the
FASTA header. This process is iterative, adding the
initial sequence examined to the database before examining the second sequence, and so on until all sequences
have been examined. Because the algorithm examines all
matches given user-specified criteria, regions of high
sequence identity will also be matched independent of
their order (non-syntenic). A summary file indicating
the size distribution of fragments and total number of
novel nucleotides is created, as well as a graphical representation of the novel regions distributed among all
input sequences in scalable vector graphic (SVG) form.
Default Nucmer parameters used by the NRF module
are: b:200, c:50, d:0.12, g:100 and l:20; where according
to the MUMmer manual http://mummer.sourceforge.
net/manual/#nucmer, b: the distance an alignment will
extend poor scoring regions; c: the minimum cluster
length; d: the maximum diagonal difference (diagonal
difference/match separation); g: the maximum gap
between two adjacent matches in a cluster; l: the minimum length of an exact match.
Core and Accessory Genome Finder (CAGF)

The CAGF module considers for the purposes of analyses the “pan-genome” to be comprised of sequences
selected as input to the program. Panseq initiates using
a single sequence file as a seed to which all other
sequences are compared using MUMmer. If a segment
greater than the ‘Minimum Sequence Size’ is found in a
sequence other than the seed, that segment is added to
the “pan-genome”. This newly-added-to “pan-genome”
is used as the reference for subsequent comparisons and
the process continues iteratively until all sequences have
been examined. Panseq next fragments the entire pangenome into segments of user-defined length and
determines the presence or absence of each of these
fragments in each of the original sequences based on
the percent sequence identity cutoff using the BLASTn
algorithm [11], with the following default parameters:
blastall -p blastn -W 11, -b (2*<number of input
sequences>) -v (2*<number of input sequences>)
-e 0.001, -F F. Fragments above the cutoff found in every
original sequence are considered part of the “core” genome, while fragments below the cutoff in at least one
strain are considered part of the “accessory” genome.
The core genome for each input sequence is concatenated into a single sequence and a multiple sequence
alignment is produced. The accessory genome is
reported in a tab-delimited table, where binary (0 for
absence, 1 for presence) data indicate the state of each

Page 3 of 14

fragment in the original sequences. A NEXUS formatted
file [32] for both the accessory and core genomes are
output for use in downstream phylogenetic applications.
Panseq also produces a SNP file containing core
segments with sequence variability; a tabular file listing
each SNP, its position, and value among each original
sequence; “core” and “accessory” genomes output to
separate FASTA files; and a scalable vector graphic
depicting the pan-genome and its presence/absence
among all of the original input sequences.
Loci Selector (LS)

The LS module constructs loci sets that are maximized
with respect to the unique number of fingerprints
produced among the input sequences as well as the
discriminatory power of the loci among the input
sequences. The LS module iteratively builds the final loci
set, in the following steps, given a tab-delimited table
with loci names in the first column, sequence names in
the first row, and single character data filling the matrix:
(1) Each potential available locus is evaluated for the
number of unique fingerprints that would result from
its addition to the final loci set. All loci that would generate the maximum number of unique fingerprints in
this respect are evaluated in step (2).
(2) All loci from step (1) are evaluated for their discriminatory power among the sequences, which is given as
points of discrimination (POD). The POD for a locus is
calculated as follows.
A listing of all possible pair-wise comparisons is constructed; for example, if the input table consisted of
three sequences, A, B and C, the list would consist of
A-B, A-C and B-C. Next, it is determined whether or
not the sequences in each pair-wise comparison contain
the same single character denoting the locus state. If
they do, a value of 0 is assigned; if they differ a value of
1 is assigned. The POD is then the summation of all
pair-wise comparisons that differ for that locus. With
our previous example, if A-B = 1, A-C = 1 and B-C = 0,
the POD for that locus would be 2.
(3) The locus with the highest value from step (2) is
selected for addition to the final loci set and removed
from the pool of candidate loci. If two or more loci tie
in value, one is randomly selected. If all possible unique
fingerprints have been found, the algorithm continues
with (4); if additional unique fingerprints are possible,
the algorithm continues with (5).
(4) Sequence pairs for which the allele of the locus
chosen in (3) differ are excluded from the analysis. This
ensures loci that differ between other pairs of strains are
preferentially considered. Consider our A, B and C
example with pair-wise comparisons of A-B = 1, A-C =
1 and B-C = 0. In the case of this locus being chosen,
the sequence pairs A-B and A-C would be temporarily

Laing et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:461
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/461

removed from the analysis (“masked”), leaving only loci
that differed between B-C as viable options.
(5) Once a locus has been chosen:

allows the genomic information to be easily queried and
is a logical first step in connecting genotype to phenotype in comparative genomics analyses.
The NRF Module in Genomic Island Identification

a) the specified number of loci has been reached (all
unique fingerprints in the case of ‘best’) and the
algorithm terminates; or
b) the specified number of loci has not been reached
and there are remaining fingerprints possible, or
sequence pairs for which differences exist. The algorithm returns to (1); or
c) there are no remaining fingerprints possible and
no sequence pairs for which differences exist. At
such time, all sequence pairs are again considered
part of the analysis ("unmasked”). If no differences
among any sequence pairs exist at this point, the
algorithm terminates; if differences remain, the
algorithm returns to (1).

Results and Discussion
We have used a number of examples to highlight the
functionality of Panseq, many of which could be carried
forward as complete studies of their own; however, our
intention is to demonstrate that Panseq is capable of
finding and extracting useful data from sequences,
which can be used as the basis for hypothesis generation
and future investigations.
(1) Novel Region Finder (NRF) Module

Alignment programs are capable of finding regions of
similarity between sequences, and regions of uniqueness
can be inferred from the gaps between areas with high
sequence similarity. However, a number of steps are
required using alignment programs to identify genomic
regions that are unique with respect to other sequence
(s). These steps include the location of the sequence
coordinates for each sequence of interest and the subsequent location of the corresponding sequence in a
sequence editor. Panseq automates this process, creating
FASTA files of all unique regions of a given sequence or
sequences as well as presenting a graphical overview of
the locations of the novel regions, based on the results
of sequence comparisons made using the MUMmer
algorithm. MUMmer was chosen as the sequence alignment engine because of its use of suffix-trees, which
allow it to perform operations up to 100 times faster
than similar alignment programs in whole-genome comparisons [12].
Determining putative functions for the regions identified by the NRF module can be accomplished by comparing the translated nucleotide sequences to known
protein sequences using the Panseq links to NCBI
BLASTx [11] or the UniProt database [33]. This linking

Novel regions have the potential to affect virulence and
niche specificity of pathogenic microorganisms. In 2000,
Perna et al. [34] published the complete genomic
sequence of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 strain
EDL933 and compared it to the previously sequenced,
non-pathogenic laboratory E. coli K12 strain MG1655.
Genomic regions found in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 but
not in K12 were called “O-Islands” and genomic regions
present in K12 but not EDL933 were termed
“K-Islands”. Perna et al. found 177 O-Islands greater
than 50 bp in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933, constituting
1.34 Mb and 234 K-Islands greater than 50 bp in the
K12 strain MG1655, representing 0.53 Mb. They determined the presence of these islands using a custom
modification of the MUMmer program [12] and found
that many of the genomic regions in strain EDL933
were bacteriophage-related and suggested that they may
play a role in the virulence of the organism.
Using Panseq, we re-analyzed the genome sequence
data used in these experiments with the NRF module,
checking “Unique among the sequences selected” to
generate both sets of genomic islands in a single step.
Perna et al. [34] defined islands as regions with less
than 90% sequence identity over 90% of the sequence
length. We found that genomic islands identified in this
previous analyses can extend into conserved regions,
combining multiple islands into a single contiguous
sequence that is interspersed with regions of high
sequence identity. Similarly, genomic islands may be
misclassified as core regions simply because of heterogeneous composition with interspersed core and accessory
sequences in regions of high heterogeneity. Panseq uses
parameters optimized for high-resolution comparison of
genomic sequences and we found that it more stringently defined islands unique to a genome sequence.
With default program settings (Nucmer values of
b:200, c:50, d:0.12, g:100, l:20) and a minimum novel
region size of 50 bp, Panseq identified 214 K- and 304
O-Islands, compared with the 234 K- and 177 O-Islands
of Perna et al. [34]; a detailed comparison of the findings can be found in Additional File 2. As a result of
differences in the stringency between the two methods,
present but heterogeneous islands such as K-Island #4
were not identified as islands by Panseq; K-island #4
matches at 90% sequence identity for 84 bp at positions
111429 - 11511 in K-12 and 116035 - 116118 in
EDL933. This represents an example of modest differences in core sequence rather than of “novel” regions
that comprise the accessory genome (see also below the
discussion of identity thresholds). Additionally, islands

Laing et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:461
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/461

identified by Perna et al. with interspersed regions of
high sequence identity were split and refined into separate islands by Panseq; for example O-island #7 was
split into four unique islands, eliminating the regions of
high sequence identity. These results demonstrate that
Panseq can correctly identify and rapidly extract novel
genomic sequences.
Two-way comparisons similar to those used for E. coli
strains K-12 and EDL933 have been used to identify
genetic attributes which confer distinct phenotypes on
many other taxonomically related strain pairs. This type
of analysis has allowed researchers to identify elements
unique to each strain and suggest putative functions for
these elements in the life cycles of the respective organisms, their virulence and their ability to survive in different niches. Examples of such studies include the
identification of genetic differences between the humanrestricted Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar
Typhi, and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium, which is a murine pathogen but is not
host-restricted [35]; and the differences between the
host-restricted causative agent of plague, Yersinia pestis
and the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
[36]. While these types of two strain comparison studies
have been extremely insightful, studies using programs
such as Panseq will greatly facilitate these comparisons
and also allow comparisons between multi-strain groups.
The NRF Module in Multiple Sequence Comparisons

To demonstrate a comparison of recently sequenced
genomes to previously completed “reference” genomic
sequences, we used the two draft genome sequences of
Listeria monocytogenes F6900 and 10403S and compared
them to the four complete L. monocytogenes genomes in
Genbank: Clip81459, EGD-e, HCC23 and 4bF2365
(Table 1). The NRF module found 45 novel regions
≥500 bp, constituting 126858 bp of genomic DNA not
present in the four reference L. monocytogenes genomes.
The size distribution of the novel regions from the output file is presented in Figure 1. In addition to the summary file, the novel regions are output in FASTA format
with sequence location and size information found in
the header. These files are suitable for additional

bioinformatic or phylogenetic analysis. In addition to
the FASTA file, an SVG graphics file showing the location of the novel regions in each strain is optionally
provided. As can be seen in Figure 1, the greatest number of novel regions was found in the 1000 -2000 bp
range, with 38 of the 45 regions less than 4000 bp in
size.
Experimental Confirmation of Outputs from the NRF
Module

We wished to experimentally confirm the uniqueness of
the novel regions extracted by Panseq. To do this, we
determined genomic regions present in at least one of
14 E. coli O157:H7 whole genome sequences (Table 2)
but absent from the two O157:H7 reference genomes
EDL933 and Sakai. We designed primers targeting 65 of
these novel regions and examined the distribution of the
regions among a population of 60 E. coli O157:H7
strains. All of the primer pairs generated amplicons in
at least one but not all of the E. coli O157:H7 strains
other than EDL933 and Sakai, and all failed to amplify
DNA from E. coli O157 EDL933 and Sakai, as predicted
by Panseq (data not shown). This experimentally
demonstrated that the sequences identified by Panseq
represent novel accessory regions not found in the two
reference E. coli O157:H7 genomes.
(2) Core/Accessory Genome Finder (CAGF) Module

The Panseq CAGF module uses a combination of fragmentation and sequence identity thresholding to define
accessory and core genomic regions. To determine the
effect of the sequence identity cutoff on core/accessory
genome size, we examined groups of L. monocytogenes,
E. coli O157:H7, Clostridium difficile and C. jejuni
genomes with a fragmentation size of 500 bp (~ half the
size of an average gene) over a range of sequence identity cutoffs (Figure 2). The size of the estimated accessory genome increased as the sequence identity
threshold was raised, and the size of the estimated core
genome decreased proportionally; however, this increase
was observed to have two distinct phases: an initial linear growth in accessory genome size that was followed
by an exponential increase in accessory genome size.
The transition between the two stages occurred in the
80 - 90% sequence identity cutoff range for each species,
suggesting that with values below 80% Panseq primarily
identified accessory genome segments that were variably
absent or present whereas above this threshold Panseq
identified core genome segments with sequence
heterogeneity.
The CAGF Module in SNP Analysis of the Core Genome

Accessing the core genome is important for phylogenetic
studies, which have used “core” gene concatenates ranging in size from a few genes in multi-locus sequence
typing (MLST) schemes for Campylobacter jejuni [37]

and L. monocytogenes [38] to all known “core” genes in
E. coli O157:H7 [39]. In addition to offering the best
available data for assessing the phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of an organism, a small
number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can
be useful in defining clusters of epidemiologically related
strains [40-42].
We analyzed the six L. monocytogenes strains in Table 1
with the CAGF module of Panseq, using a fragmentation
size of 500 bp and a sequence identity cutoff of 85%. The
resulting concatenated core data, which include all conserved nucleotides and SNPs, were used to construct a
maximum parsimony (MP) tree using Phylip v3.69 [43].
A MP tree was also generated in silico for the same six
strains using the L. monocytogenes MLST protocol outlined by Nightingale et al. [38], for comparative purposes

(Figure 3). The symmetric distance between the two trees
shows that the overall topology of the trees differ
between that created from MLST data and that based on
the entire concatenated core. This is likely due to the fact
that the MLST protocol only considers seven genes,
where disproportionate variation among these few loci
and the relative paucity of loci compared to that of the
entire core genome can reduce the ability of this method
to capture the overall relationships among strains. With
the continued increase in sequencing throughput, settling
for rough approximations of true tree topologies may no
longer be necessary.
The CAGF Module in the Analysis of the Accessory Genome

While SNP analysis has proven to be an extremely useful tool, the ideal reconstruction of an evolutionary history would take into account not only the heterogeneity

among all core genomic regions, but also the presence
or absence of regions in the accessory gene pool, especially since the accessory genes can directly affect phenotype (e.g. niche specificity, antimicrobial resistance,
virulence, etc.).
Traditional methods of estimating phylogenies rely on
SNPs within the core genome, but it has been shown
for C. jejuni [44], E. coli O157:H7 [45] and Streptococcus
pneumoniae [46] that the distribution of accessory genes
provides a very similar overall tree topology to methods
based on variability in the core genome. Although variation in the core genome among a small number of loci
may be sufficient for identifying clusters of related
strains, discrimination among strains is often more difficult because there is less variation and fewer phylogenetically informative loci, leading to fewer genotypes.
Accessory genome content, which can be highly variably
among strains, appears in many cases to be consistent
with phylogenetic analyses of core genes and as a result

maximum parsimony (MP) trees generated for the six Listeria monocytogenes strains F6900, 10403S, Clip81459, EGD-e, HCC23 and 4bF2365 using
a) multi-locus sequence typing as described by Nightingale et al., 2005 [38]; b) the binary presence/absence data of the accessory genome
found using the Panseq Core/Accessory Genome Analysis module with fragmentation size of 500 bp and sequence identity cutoff value of 85%;

of greater variability provides a higher degree of discrimination among strains. Analysis of accessory gene content thus presents an opportunity to integrate valuable
links to phenotype into a genetic classification scheme.
To examine the performance of accessory genome
information for phylogenetic reconstruction, we used
the binary presence/absence data of the accessory genome computed for the set of six L. monocytogenes
strains above, and constructed a MP tree (Figure 3).
When comparing the tree topology of this accessorybased tree to that of the SNP-based core tree and the
MLST tree, we found that the core- and accessorybased MP trees had an identical topology, but differed
from the MLST-based tree in the placement of the two
strains 10403S and F6900. Further studies will be
required to determine the extent of the phylogenetic
concordance between the core genome and the accessory genome among other bacterial groups.
The CAGF Module in the Examination of Pan-Genomic
Differences

As well as producing a concatenated core, the CAGF
module also produces a table listing each SNP and its
location and allele within each original sequence. This
can be useful in examining individual differences or for
hierarchical clustering of data. To demonstrate how the

results of Panseq can be visualized, both tabular output
files from the Listeria core/accessory analysis were used
to create hierarchical clustering dendrograms: one based
on the SNP character data from the core regions (Figure
4) and the other based on the binary presence/absence
data of the accessory regions (Figure 5). Both dendrograms have the same tree topology, and the underlying
data for both core and accessory regions shows only the
differences among the genomic sequences, making comparisons between strains clearer than they might be
from whole-genome comparisons where conserved as
well as variable loci are considered in the analysis.
(3) The Loci Selector (LS) Module

Molecular fingerprinting methods such as SNP analysis,
multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis
(MLVA) and comparative genomic fingerprinting (CGF)
[29] often rely on a small number of loci to differentiate
among a large number of bacterial strains. Determining
which loci to use in a scheme requires selecting from, in
some cases, thousands of loci. While manual inspection
of a dataset is required to determine biologically relevant
loci, Panseq provides an automated way to empirically
determine the most variable and discriminatory loci from
an investigator-defined set of variable character data

genome of the Listeria monocytogenes strains F6900, 10403S, Clip81459, EGD-e, HCC23 and 4bF2365. The core genome was generated using the
Panseq Core/Accessory Genome Analysis module with fragmentation size of 500 bp and sequence identity cutoff value of 85%. The dendrogram

which can range from SNPs to sequence presence/
absence data.
The LS Module in the Comparison of Randomly Generated
Data

The approach of the LS module in Panseq is to iteratively build the final loci set, including only the loci that
produce the most unique fingerprints, and offer the

most variability among input sequences at each step.
This allows it to efficiently examine datasets that would
be computationally prohibitive if all possible combinations were considered.
To test the Panseq LS module, we created a random
binary dataset of 100 loci among 10 sequences in Microsoft Excel (Additional File 3). We subsequently ran

The accessory genome was generated using the Panseq Core/Accessory Genome Analysis module with fragmentation size of 500 bp and
sequence identity cutoff value of 85%. The dendrogram was produced by the statistical package R, using the hclust function with binary
distance and average linkage; black indicates presence of a locus and white the absence of a locus.

Panseq with the ‘best’ option and found that 4 loci generated a unique profile for all 10 sequences, and that
the four loci: locus84, locus40, locus79 and locus29 provided the maximum possible discrimination of 100 POD
for the dataset. While these loci cannot be guaranteed
to be the only four loci to generate the same results,
they will always be one of the most discriminatory sets.

We then ran the same dataset through a Perl script
that generated all possible 4-loci combinations, outputting those that produced 10 unique sequence profiles
(Additional File 4). We found that 99132 unique combinations of 4 loci from the dataset yielded 10 unique
sequence profiles. Evaluating every possible combination
required 449 s on a computer running Ubuntu 9.10

with 3.6 GB of available RAM and AMD Phenom 8450
triple-core processors. Panseq was able to sort through
the data to generate a single group of loci that contained not only the most unique profiles, but that provided the most discrimination among the input
sequences, completing the task in one s.
The LS Module in the Analysis of SNP Genotyping Data

Any variable character data can be used as inputs in the
LS module. To illustrate the functionality of the LS module, we used a set of 96 SNPs identified from E. coli
O157:H7 by Manning et al. [47], for which the nucleotide
value of each SNP was determined among a set of 17
E. coli O157:H7 genomic sequences [48]. This dataset
was first modified to represent any unknown character
with the ‘?’ symbol, and to replace any locus described by
two characters with a single character (Additional File 5).
This dataset was analyzed by the LS module to give
the 20 best loci from the 96 available. The results are
presented in Table 3, and show that the first locus
selected by Panseq was ECs2696, a locus with three
alleles and therefore more initial fingerprints than any
other locus except ECs2006, which also had three alleles
among the strains. However, ECs2696 provided more
POD among the strains than ECs2006 and was thus
selected by Panseq as the initial locus. The eighth locus
added (ECs5359) was the last to provide unique strain
sequence profiles. This locus differentiated the K-12
strain and E. coli O157:H7 strains EC508 and EC71074.
Every subsequent locus (9-20) was chosen by the program for its ability to offer discrimination among the
remaining strain pairs, while ensuring that highly variable loci that contain very similar allele patterns among
strains (i.e are not informative) did not replace loci in
the set that offered discrimination among fewer, but
nevertheless diverse strains.
Advantages of Panseq over Other Related Programs

While many sequence analysis programs exists, some
with overlapping capabilities, no two are identical with
respect to the tasks they perform. With enough time
and knowledge one can parse the output of a sequence
alignment program such as BLAST or MAUVE manually, but there is a considerable time savings and ease of
use with a program such as Panseq that automates the
process. Panseq is unique in its single-step novel region
finding options among groups and specific to individual
sequences, which other in silico subtractive programs
such as mGenomeSubtractor [22] and nWayComp [23]
lack. Panseq also provides a comprehensive analysis of
the pan-genome, automatically generating analyses that
can only be partially accomplished by any other single
program; eg. With MAUVE [49] a list of SNPs can be
generated and a display of the similarities/differences
between the genomes is produced, but the underlying
nucleotide sequence is not automatically extracted. With

Page 12 of 14

Panseq, the underlying sequence data is automatically
extracted, the segments compared among all sequences
and presented in tabular form and input files for phylogenetic programs are automatically created. Further, the
SNP table or binary presence/absence table of the accessory genome can be used directly in the LS module, for
the selection of the most discriminatory loci.

Conclusion
We have developed Panseq, a freely available online program to quickly find and extract strain- or group-specific
novel accessory genomic information as well as the complete pan-genome for a group of genomic sequences.
Panseq produces alignments of the core genome of each
sequence and determines the distribution of accessory
regions among all sequences analyzed. Panseq makes use
of the MUMmer alignment algorithm for whole genome
comparisons and the BLASTn algorithm for local
sequence comparisons and can efficiently compute values
for large numbers of sequences. Additionally, Panseq is
able to rapidly identify the most variable and discriminatory loci set in an iterative manner from single character
tabular data.
