Abstract
Background: The secondary genepool of our modern cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) consists of a
large number of tuber-bearing wild Solanum species under Solanum section Petota. One of the major taxonomic
problems in section Petota is that the series classification (as put forward by Hawkes) is problematic and the
boundaries of some series are unclear. In addition, the classification has received only partial cladistic support in
all molecular studies carried out to date.
The aim of the present study is to describe the structure present in section Petota. When possible, at least 5
accessions from each available species and 5 individual plants per accession (totally approx. 5000 plants) were
genotyped using over 200 AFLP markers. This resulted in the largest dataset ever constructed for Solanum section
Petota. The data obtained are used to evaluate the 21 series hypothesis put forward by Hawkes and the 4 clade
hypothesis of Spooner and co-workers.
Results: We constructed a NJ tree for 4929 genotypes. For the other analyses, due to practical reasons, a
condensed dataset was created consisting of one representative genotype from each available accession. We
show a NJ jackknife and a MP jackknife tree. A large part of both trees consists of a polytomy. Some structure is
still visible in both trees, supported by jackknife values above 69. We use these branches with >69 jackknife
support in the NJ jackknife tree as a basis for informal species groups. The informal species groups recognized
are: Mexican diploids, Acaulia, Iopetala, Longipedicellata, polyploid Conicibaccata, diploid Conicibaccata,
Circaeifolia, diploid Piurana and tetraploid Piurana.
Conclusion: Most of the series that Hawkes and his predecessors designated can not be accepted as natural
groups, based on our study. Neither do we find proof for the 4 clades proposed by Spooner and co-workers. A
few species groups have high support and their inner structure displays also supported subdivisions, while a large
part of the species cannot be structured at all. We believe that the lack of structure is not due to any
methodological problem but represents the real biological situation within section Petota.

Background
The secondary genepool of our modern cultivated potato
(Solanum tuberosum L.) consists of a large number of
tuber-bearing wild Solanum species which grow in various
habitats from the southern states of the USA to the most
southern parts of Chile and Argentina. These wild species
are important as a resource for valuable traits that can be
used to improve the quality of the cultivars, including
resistance against important diseases like Phytophthora
infestans and potato cyst nematodes (Globodera spp.).
Therefore it is no surprise that the wild relatives of the cultivated potato have since long drawn the attention of
many plant breeders and botanists. To benefit most from
the possibilities that the secondary genepool has to offer,
it is necessary to have a good insight in the taxonomy. The
classical treatments of potato taxonomy are from Correll
[1], and Hawkes [2], later followed by reviews from
Spooner and Hijmans [3], Spooner and Salas [4], and van
den Berg and Jacobs [5].

The aim of the present study is to focus on the second
problem and to describe the structure within section
Petota. In the present study the largest number of species
and accessions to date are examined in one simultaneous
AFLP analysis. The obtained data are used for evaluation
of the hypothesis put forward by Hawkes [2] that section
Petota can be divided in 21 series and the hypothesis of
Spooner and Castillo [14], that the section consists of 4
clades only.
AFLP has proven to be a useful method to solve phylogenetic relationships at a low taxonomic level [15-17]. The
application of AFLP has many advantages. It produces
highly reproducible data [18], it does not need a priori
sequence information and it has the ability of high resolution [17]. Because AFLP generates fragments at random
over the whole genome it avoids the problem that many
sequence data based phylogeny reconstructions have, e.g.
the generation of a gene tree instead of a species tree [15].

There are two major taxonomic problems in the section
Petota. First, many described species are extremely similar
to each other and section Petota seems to be overclassified
[5]. In many cases, potato species can only be distinguished by means of multivariate analysis of quantitative
characters and/or on the basis of geographic origin [6-9].

Results

The main cause for these difficulties is the ability of many
species in section Petota to hybridize easily with other species [4]. Many species have been suspected to arise from
hybrid speciation. Other causes are high morphological
similarity among species, and phenotypic plasticity in different environments [3]. In recent reviews the number of
species is reduced due to increased insights in potato taxonomy. Hawkes [2] recognized 227 tuber bearing species
(7 cultivated species included) and 9 non-tuber-bearing
species within section Petota. Spooner and Hijmans [3]
recognized 203 tuber-bearing species including 7 cultivated species. Finally, Spooner and Salas [4], reduced the
number further to 189 species (including 1 cultivated species) in section Petota.

At the accession level, the genotypes of the majority of the
accessions cluster together. Of those accessions that do
not form complete clusters, in most cases only one genotype deviates from the other 4 genotypes. In other cases,
the accession was apparently so closely related with one or
more other accessions that their genotypes formed a
mixed group.

The second taxonomic problem is the series classification.
Hawkes [2] classified section Petota into 19 tuber bearing
series plus two non-tuber bearing series that vary considerably in the number of species included. The boundaries
between some series are unclear. As outlined earlier by
Spooner et al. [10], the series classification of Hawkes and
previous authors has received only partial cladistic support in any molecular study to date. The cpDNA RFLP data
from Spooner and Sytsma [11], Castillo and Spooner
[12], Rodriguez and Spooner [13], and Spooner and Castillo [14] could only find support for a classification in 4
clades.

The large dataset (4929 genotypes)
Figure 1 shows the Neighbor Joining (NJ) tree of the 4929
genotypes dataset. To describe the structure found in this
NJ tree, we differentiate between 3 levels of structure: the
accession level, the species level and the interspecies level.

At the species level, 58 species or subspecies show consistency in their clustering, e.g. all accessions of a species cluster together. Nevertheless there are also many species (38
in total) whose accessions did not cluster all together and
48 species whose accessions were mixed with accessions
of other species. The latter was often the case with species
that occur in South America, the borders of many of these
species are not clearly recognizable from the NJ tree.
Above the species level, a few clusters of species groups
can be distinguished in the large NJ tree (but there is no
indication on the statistical strength of the structure
observed). Roughly, the following groups can be found in
the NJ tree of the large dataset: 1) an outgroup with S.
nigrum, S. chaparense, S. sitiens, and S. fraxinifolium 2)
North and Central American diploid series Polyadenia,
Pinnatisecta, Bulbocastana and Morelliformia, 3) Circaeifolia
and Piurana accessions, 4) Longipedicellata accessions, 5)
Demissa and Conicibaccata accessions but without S. demissum and S. semidemissum, 6) S. verrucosum accessions, 7)

Tuberosa from Bolivia, Argentina and Chile plus some
accessions from other series such as Yungasensa, 8) accessions from cultivated Tuberosa species and wild Tuberosa
from Peru, 9) accessions from Tuberosa and Megistacroloba,
10) accessions from S. acaule (and its subspecies), S. albicans, S. demissum, S x semidemissum and S. edinense.
The condensed dataset (916 genotypes)
Because of the size of the dataset, it proved impossible to
analyze it with cladistic methods nor to analyze it for statistical support. A condensed dataset was created by
choosing a representative genotype from all the available
accessions (see methods section for exact details). This
condensed dataset consisted of 916 genotypes.

A single ratchet parsimony search consisting of 200 iterations yielded a Maximum Parsimony (MP) tree of 9669
steps. Furthermore, 20 individual independent ratchet
searches each consisting of 50 iterations also yielded a MP
tree of 9669 steps.
Figure 2 shows the schematised majority rule consensus
NJ jackknife tree and Figure 3 shows the schematised
majority rule consensus MP jackknife tree of the condensed dataset. The strict consensus trees were manipulated in such a manner that not all the separate branches
were represented but some were summarised. The schematised trees only show branches with more than 69 jackknife support. The original majority rule consensus NJ
jackknife tree and majority rule consensus MP jackknife
tree are available from the authors as supplemental data.
When comparing the NJ and the MP jackknife trees it is
apparent that a large part of both trees consists of a polytomy. However, some structure is still visible in both trees,
supported by jackknife values above 69. The following
groups can be recognized in both the NJ jackknife tree and
the MP jackknife tree:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/145

5) A small group of accessions belonging to S. paucijugum,
S. tuquerrense, and S. solisii, tetraploid species belonging to
the series Piurana, with a jackknife support of 96 in the NJ
tree and 92 in the MP tree.
There are also differences in group structure between the
two trees. There are a number of groups that have good
jackknife support in the NJ tree but are not supported in
the MP jackknife tree:
1) A group of hexaploid Mexican species belonging to
series Demissa with a jackknife support of 79. In the MP
tree only 2 species that are part of this group were found
in one small clade: S. schenckii and S. hougasii.
2) A group of accessions from species belonging to series
Conicibaccata has a jackknife support of 82 in the NJ jackknife tree. In the MP jackknife tree the same accessions are
part of the polytomy. These clades represent the subgroups found within the Conicibaccata group in the NJ
tree. Only one subgroup is not represented by a similar
clade in the MP jackknife tree.
3) A group of species belonging to series Piurana has a
jackknife support of 69 in the NJ tree. In the MP tree, the
jackknife support was low, so this group collapsed and 4
out of 5 supported subgroups found in the NJ jackknife
tree are visible as supported separate small groups in the
MP jackknife tree.
4) A group consisting of accessions from diploid species
of series Conicibaccata, S. buesii, S. sandemannii and S. laxissimum with jackknife support of 92.
5) A group which contains accessions of S. medians, S. sandemanii, S. weberbauerii and an unknown species with a
jackknife support of 85.

Discussion
1) Mexican diploid species, with a jackknife support of 73
for the MP tree and 99 for the NJ tree; the substructure
found within the Mexican and Northern American diploids is almost the same for both trees.
2) A group of tetraploid Mexican/North and Central
American species belonging to series Longipedicellata, with
a jackknife support of 100 in both trees.
3) A group consisting of accessions of S. acaule, S. demissum, and closely related species with a jackknife support of
100 in the MP tree and 99 in the NJ tree.
4) A group consisting of the species belonging to series
Circaeifolia, with a jackknife support of 100 in both trees.

The value of AFLP
One of the arguments against the use of AFLP is the possible bias caused by homoplasy [17,19,20]. Non-identical
co-migrating bands in the AFLP fingerprints can contribute noise instead of signal to the dataset without being
detected. However, it is not likely that in the tuber-bearing
wild potatoes homoplasy will cause many problems
because the species are all very closely related and homoplasy becomes a problem when distantly related species
are involved. Koopman [16] showed that in a set of
closely related Lactuca species, sufficient phylogenetic signal was present and concluded that in practice the influence of possible limitations of AFLP, such as co-migration
of nonhomologous fragments is limited. However, he
stresses that the conclusion only applies to datasets with
closely related species. Moreover, Kardolus [19] concludes

from his AFLP results that in Solanum section Petota the
AFLP technique is suitable up to the species level. The
AFLP method has since then successfully been used in
more studies on potato taxonomy [21-24].
Status of groups within section Petota
Not all the groups found in this study have the same level
of cohesion or have the same level of demarcation. Some
groups have clear borders, while from others we can only
vaguely recognize the contours. First, there is a number of
groups that are always well supported, whether the analysis is done in a phenetic or phylogenetic way, see Figure 2
and 3. This is the case for the group of Mexican diploid
species, the group of Mexican tetraploids, the group of S.
demissum and S. acaule, the group of S. circaeifolium, the
group of S. commersonii and the group of S. schenckii and
S. hougasii. Then there are groups that are not supported
in the MP jackknife tree (Figure 2) but that can be found
in both the original MP trees and NJ trees (not shown)
and are supported in the NJ jackknife tree (Figure 3). This
applies to the group with Mexican hexaploid species, the
group containing polyploid species belonging to series
Conicibaccata, the group containing diploid Piurana species, and the small groups of S. huancabambense, S. kurtzianum, S. medians, S. mochiquense, S. hannemanii, S. buesii,
and S. paucijugum.

The largest part of the jackknife trees consists of a polytomy of species that does not seem to contain structure at
all. If one was only to consider the structure shown in the
jackknife trees, the conclusion would have to be that
according to the results of the present AFLP analyses the
largest part of section Petota is without any taxonomic
structure.
However, it is possible to identify additional groups that
are present in many of the original NJ and MP trees, but
do not have enough support to be shown in the jackknife
trees. For example, in the 4929 dataset NJ tree a cluster
represents the group of cultivated potatoes together with
species of series Tuberosa from Peru. The groups that are
found in both the phenetic and phylogenetic analysis are
strong groups with clear borders. The exchange of genetic
material is most likely restricted to the members of the
group. The groups with only low support in the MP alone
or in both trees are groups that probably share a considerable amount of genetic material with genotypes outside
the group. In a study of Jacobs, van den Berg and Vosman:
Comparison of Chloroplast DNA and AFLP data from
Solanum section Petota reveals incongruencies between the
datasets, submitted, the incongruencies found between
the chloroplast data and the AFLP data suggest that
hybridization occurs between species of different series in
section Petota. For example, the composition of species of
the clade representing the series Piurana in the chloroplast

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/145

tree is different from that of the clade representing the
Piurana series in the AFLP tree.
The resulting groups also have implications for the theory
on EBN of Hawkes and Jackson [25]. EBN stands for
Endosperm Balance Number and refers to a hypothetical
genetic factor that would explain the success or failure of
crosses due to the functioning or breakdown of the
endosperm after fertilization. Crosses between species
with the same EBN are generally successful and crosses
between species with different EBN generally are not,
independent of ploidy levels. Hawkes and Jackson [25]
claim that there is a correlation between the EBN hypothesis and the evolution of the group of tuber-bearing Solanum species. EBN 1 is found mainly in species that are
considered to be close to the ancestors of the group: Mexican series Morelliformia, Bulbocastana, Pinnatisecta, and
Polyadenia. The EBN 2 condition would have arisen as an
isolating mechanism when potato species moved southwards. The EBN 4 condition occurs in hexaploids which
are allopolyploids.
From the present results it is clear that there is no absolute
relationship between EBNs and the groups found. In the
group which contains S. acaule, S. demissum, S. semidemissum and S. edinense, different ploidy levels and different
EBNs occur. This mixture of ploidy and EBN levels also
occurs in the group with representatives of series Conicibaccata. The species S. moscopanum and S. tundalomense
both are hexaploid and have EBN 4 and they form a group
or cluster together with other series Conicibaccata species
which are known to be tetraploid and have EBN 2.
Although these tetraploid and hexaploid species from
series Conicibaccata are mixed, the diploid series Conicibaccata (EBN 2) species do form a separate cluster.
With regard to the overall structure of the section as found
in this study two main observations can be made. There
seems to be a lack of supported structure, especially in the
South American part of section Petota. Furthermore, there
is a lack of support for the relationships between the different groups that were found in the NJ and MP trees. It is
important to differentiate between these two phenomena
because the causes underlying both cases could be different.
Lack of structure in South American part of section Petota
The AFLP jackknife NJ tree and the jackknife MP tree in
this study shows a lack of structure or rather, an unresolved structure for the part of the tree which contains
South American species while the other part of the tree
shows several well supported groups.

Kardolus et al. [19] mentioned that within series Tuberosa
different genotypes of the same species are not always

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:145

grouped together and are scattered among genotypes from
other species. He claims that the cause of this phenomenon is not the lack of resolution of AFLP, but the overclassification of a group of species, the so-called brevicaulecomplex. The cpDNA RFLP studies of Spooner and Sytsma
[11], and Spooner and Castillo [14] also showed a lack of
support for a resolved structure within the group of South
American species, and the branch uniting all these species
had a bootstrap support value of only 67.
Volkov et al. [26] compared the ETS region of rDNA for 30
species of Solanum section Petota and found high bootstrap values for the branch uniting all the South American
species in three different types of dendrogram (Maximum
parsimony, Bayesian statistics and Neigbour Joining).
However, the two subgroups within the South American
clade that they distinghuished (variants C1 and C2) often
show polytomies and resolution within the groups is
mostly lacking.
Outside the field of potato taxonomy, researchers have
reported similar patterns. Hughes and Eastwood [27]
report a low sequence divergence and lack of resolution in
the large Andean clade of the genus Lupinus. This would
point at a rapid and recent diversification in the Andes.
The authors also suggest that Lupinus is probably only one
example of many plant radiations that followed the final
uplift of the Andes. They assume that many of these plant
radiations are yet unknown. It is possible that the factors
underlying the Lupinus diversification are also responsible
for the Solanum section Petota diversification. According to
Hughes and Eastwood [27] these factors would be the
large scale of the area over which the radiation extends,
repeated fragmentation of high altitude habitats due to
quaternary climate fluctuations, the extremely dissected
topography, and the habitat heterogeneity.
Lack of support for relationships between different groups
Except for the outgroup consisting of S. etuberosum, S.
palustre and S. fernandezianum which connects to the main
branch of the NJ jackknife and MP jackknife tree with
respectively 100 or 98 support value, none of the branches
connecting two or more groups have jackknife support of
69 or higher. That is the reason why in the schematized
jackknife NJ and jackknife MP trees these branches collapse in a polytomy. Contrastingly, the branches of the
groups that can be recognised within the polytomy do
have jackknife support, although not all species can be put
in groups as discussed previously.

In the first study on the use of AFLP in Petota taxonomy by
Kardolus et al. [19], it proved also difficult to find bootstrap support for branches connecting the different groups
in section Petota. Bootstrap support above 70 were given
for a NJ tree branch connecting the outgroup of S. etubero-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/145

sum and S. brevidens, for a branch connecting the outgroups, and for the Mexican diploids and S. circaeifolium
and S. circaeifolium subspecies quimense with the other
part of the tree. In the cpDNA RFLP studies on the South
American part of section Petota [14] only a few branches
connecting the larger groups showed bootstrap support
above 70. Clade 1, consisting of Mexican diploids (except
S. cardiophyllum and S. bulbocastanum) is connected to the
other clades with a bootstrap value of 87, and Clade 3
(mainly accessions belonging to series Piurana) and Clade
4 (the rest of section Petota) are connected to each other
with a branch with 96 bootstrap support.
We can conclude from these previous results that it is
indeed difficult to find good support for the backbone
structure of section Petota in general. This indicates that
our and previous results represent the real biological situation in Solanum section Petota. Since the phylogenetic signal is clearly present in our data as shown in the wellsupported groups in the present study, the lack of structure in parts of the tree is not caused by the lack of phylogenetic signal in AFLP markers.
New informal species groups for Solanum section Petota
As outlined in this paper and in other earlier studies, there
are no results that support the classification of section
Petota in 21 series. Although a few of the series seem to
form natural groups, the majority of the series as proposed by Hawkes [2] could not be found as separate clusters or clades. Our goal is to use the found structure in the
present study at maximum for classifying the section
Petota.

We propose to divide section Petota in informal species
groups, following the approach of Spooner et al. [10] who
constructed 11 informal species groups for the North and
Central American species. They followed the approach of
Whalen [28] and Knapp [29,30] who applied a similar
informal species group classification. We will use the
names already used by Spooner et al. [10] if applicable,
and add new groups that were not treated in their study.
We chose to base the informal group classification on the
groups that are supported in the NJ jackknife tree. The NJ
jackknife tree shows more resolution relative to the MP.
However, it would not be useful to consider every small
group that appears in the schematized tree as a biologically meaningful group. Therefore, the choice for species
groups is restricted to groups of species that make sense in
the light of former studies and contain at least 3 species.
We maintain the species group Verrucosa which contains
only one species, because this species group is already designated by Spooner et al [10].
In total, the NJ jackknife tree can be partitioned into 10
species groups. It would be possible to construct more

species groups based on the structure shown in the various trees made in the present study, but these groups
would then not be supported by bootstrap or jackknife
supports.
Although a closed classification following the rules of the
Botanical Code is desirable, it seems in this case difficult
to apply. In the present study, many species cannot be
accommodated in groups. These species do not automatically form a group themselves, but are intentionally left
unclassified.
We suggest recognizing the following informal species
groups as shown in the NJ jackknife tree (Figure 3):
Diploid Mexican group
This group contains the species groups of Spooner et al.
[10]: Pinnatisecta, Stenophyllidia, Trifida, Polyadenia,
Morelliforme, and Bulbocastana. These species groups
can be recognized in the present study as separate
branches within the NJ cluster which represents this species group. In the present study we recognize a higher level
of group structure which contains all the mentioned species groups, because the detailed contents of each subgroup in our study (Figure 3) differs from the contents
from the species groups from Spooner et al. [10].
Acaulia group
In our study this group contains 2 supported subgroups,
one branch with jackknife support of 96 containing the
species S. semidemissum, S. demissum and S. x edinense. The
other group shows a jackknife support of 98 and contains
S. juzepczukii, S. albicans and the three subspecies S. acaule
subsp. acaule, S. acaule subsp. aemulans, S. acaule subsp.
punae.
Iopetala group
This group contains the species S. schenckii, S. hougasii,
that form a strongly supported cluster together (jackknife
support 100) and a cluster containing the species S. iopetalum, S. brachycarpum, S. guerreroense (jackknife support
90). All species were formerly designated by Hawkes [2] to
series Demissa which also included the species S. demissum
and closely related species. The species in our group are
the same as in the species group Iopetala designated by
Spooner et al. [10]. They reduced the species S. brachycarpum as a synonym of S. iopetalum.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/145

ita, and S. polytrichon have been reduced as synonyms of S.
stoloniferum [10]. The species S. matehualae is reduced as
synonym of S. hjertingii [10].
Polyploid Conicibaccata group
This group contains species placed there by Spooner et al.
[10], complemented with South American species. The
species in this species group are mainly the same as
Hawkes [2] placed in series Conicibaccata. According to the
present study the group consists of S. flahaultii, S. moscopanum, S. orocense, S. sucubunense, S. tundalomense, S. oxycarpum, S. longiconicum, S. garcia-barrigae, S. otites, S.
oxycarpum, S. agrimonifolium, S. moscopanum, S. subspanduratum, S. paramoense, and S. colombianum.
Diploid Conicibaccata group
Although most of the series Conicibaccata can be put in the
species group Conicibaccata there are a few species that
form a separate group. This group consists of the diploid
species S. buesii, S. sandemanii, and S. laxissimum.
Diploid Piurana group
This species group was not designated by Spooner et al.
[10]. The name refers to the former series Piurana as the
contents of the group are roughly similar: S. piurae, S.
acroglossum, S. blanco-galdosii, S. irosinum, S. chomatophilum, and S. paucissectum from series Piurana and S.
chiquidenum from series Tuberosa.
Tetraploid Piurana group
The situation as described before for the Conicibaccata
group also applies partly for the Piurana group. There are
a few species from the formerly designated Piurana series
[2] that form their own species group. This species group
contains the tetraploid species S. paucijugum, S. tuquerrense, and S. solisii.
Circaeifolia group
This group consists of S. circaeifolium, S. soestii, S. capsicumbaccatum and S. circaeifolium subsp. quimense. The contents is conform Hawkes' series Circaeifolia.
Verrucosa group
This group contains only 2 species; S. macropilosum and S.
verrucosum. The species S. macropilosum was reduced to a
synonym of S. verrucosum by Spooner et al. [10].

Conclusion
Longipedicellata group
As the name does suggest, this group contains species that
were formerly placed by Hawkes [2] in the series of Longipedicellata. The species included in this group are S. fendleri including S. fendleri subsp. arizonicum, S. stoloniferum,
S. hjertingii,. S. papita, S. polytrichon, S. leptosepalum, and S.
matehualae. The species S. leptosepalum, S. fendleri, S. pap-

As far as we know, this paper treats the largest collection
of Solanum section Petota accessions ever analysed simultaneously. All other previous studies used datasets that
included less variation and fewer species. Because of the
thorough sampling, it is possible to propose species
groups without too many reservations. A number of species groups coincide with certain series recognized by

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:145

Hawkes [2]. However, most of the series that Hawkes and
his predecessors recognized, cannot be supported any
longer as natural groups, based on our current knowledge.
The present study shows that the taxonomic structure of
Solanum section Petota is highly unbalanced. A few species
groups have high support and their inner structure displays also supported subdivisions, while a large part of the
species cannot be structured and they seem to be all
equally related to each other and to the supported groups.
It might be difficult to accept that a part of genus Solanum
section Petota cannot be structured or subdivided. We
even doubt that it would be possible to find more resolution with other methods or more markers, and we consider it likely that the polytomy is indicative of the real
situation in section Petota. A relatively fast spread of tuberbearing Solanum species over South America, due to the
geographic conditions in the Andes [27], combined with
high levels of hybridisation may explain why the phylogenetic links between species are so difficult to establish.

Methods
Plant Material
In total 951 accessions representing 196 different taxa,
species, 15 subspecies and 17 hybrids were sampled. We
tried to include as many species as possible from various
gene banks. In principle, at least 5 accessions from each
available species and 5 individual plants per species
(totally approx. 5000 genotypes) were included. Seeds
were surface-sterilized and sown in vitro at 25°C. The collection of individual Solanum clones was grown in vitro
for at least 6 weeks on MS medium supplemented with
20% sucrose [31] at 18°C. DNA was extracted from leafs
according to the method described by Stewart and Via
[32].
Nomenclature
Additional file 1 lists the species used and the accessions
representing the species names according to the passport
information from the gene bank. The labels used are not
corrected according to the synonymy in recent taxonomic
revisions for two reasons. First, we do not want to change
an original label of an accession without actually checking
the identity of that accession. Furthermore, by retaining
the original labels it is possible to check many hypotheses
on the taxonomy of species. However, we have included
some remarks about recent taxonomy changes in Additional file 1. In some cases names/labels were corrected by
us after preliminary AFLP results and visual inspection of
the plant material in the greenhouse or on the field. If an
accession could be assigned to another species according
to AFLP pattern and morphology, it was given the name of
this species, if there were any doubts on the identification
the species was given the label S. spec.. The accessions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/145

which labels were changed are indicated in Additional file
1.
AFLP
The samples were fingerprinted with two EcoRI/MseI AFLP
primer combinations: E32/M49 and E35/M48. The protocol of Vos et al. [33] was used to generate AFLP fragments.
Primer combination E32/M49 yielded 91 polymorphic
bands and primer combination E35/M48 yielded 131
bands. Keygene carried out the AFLP analysis on a MegaBACE 2.1 and scored the bands using their proprietary
software. Bands were scored as dominant markers, so only
the presence or the absence of a band was scored.
Datasets
The dataset in this study originally contained 4929 genotypes. This large dataset was analyzed with NJ and
UPGMA. Because of the size of the dataset, it proved
impossible to analyze it with cladistic methods nor to
analyze it for statistical support, even using the SARA
supercomputer (see below). It was sheer impossible for a
personal computer to do any further analyses apart from
the NJ and UPGMA, and for the SARA computer cluster it
would have taken many months/years of computing time.

For further analysis a condensed dataset was created by
carefully choosing a representative genotype from all the
available accessions. This condensed dataset consisted of
916 genotypes. The condensed dataset was used in both
phenetic and cladistic analyses and in the resampling
methods.
Besides choosing only one genotype per accession to represent the accession in the condensed dataset, other
adjustments were made to create this dataset. All the 22
known interspecific hybrid accessions were removed, 23
other accessions were completely removed because of the
extreme heterogeneity of the accession (possibly resulting
from a mixture of species) in both the NJ and the UPGMA
trees. Species labels of 49 accessions were changed based
on their position in the NJ and/or UPGMA tree (not
shown) and visual inspection of the plants in the experimental field or greenhouse in 2005 and 2006. In total 11
outgroup accessions were removed because preliminary
AFLP results showed these outgroups to be too distant (S.
sitiens, S. nigrum, S. chaparense, S. lycopersicoides, S. canense, S. fraxinifolium). The outgroup species S. etuberosum,
S. palustre and S. fernandezianum were retained in the dataset.
Data analysis
Both the phenetic and the cladistic analyses were conducted using PAUP 4.0 Altivec [34] on the TERAS computing cluster of SARA computing facilities in Amsterdam.
For the 4929 phenetic analysis we used the total character

distance, for the 916 data set we used the NeiLi distance
[35] to calculate the distance matrix. A Neighbor Joining
Jackknife tree was calculated using 10.000 replicates.
The cladistic analysis heuristic searches were done by
using PRAP, Parsimony Ratchet Analyses using PAUP, a
program that writes commands for PAUP. The commands
in PRAP describe how PAUP should carry out parsimony
ratchet searches [36]. By using parsimony ratchet, as
described by Nixon [37], many tree islands are searched
instead of thoroughly searching through each island.
For the MP jackknife analysis, we followed the conclusions drawn by Muller [36] that using random addition
sequence instead of simple addition sequence has no beneficial effect on bootstrap or jackknife support. Also, a
jackknife or bootstrap analysis using one heuristic search
saving one tree per jackknife replicate and simple addition
sequence, performed as good as or even better than an
analysis using 10 parsimony ratchet iterations using the
shortest tree only or using a strict consensus tree of all
shortest trees [36]. Therefore, we conducted a jackknife
MP analysis by performing 10.000 replicates using simple
addition, and saving one shortest tree per replicate.
