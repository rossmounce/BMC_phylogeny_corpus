ART initiation

Abstract
Background: Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven its success against HIV-1, the long lifespan of
infected cells and viral latency prevent eradication. In this study we analyzed the sensitivity to ART of HIV-1 strains
in naïve, central memory and effector memory CD4+ lymphocyte subsets.
Methods: From five patients cellular HIV-1 infection levels were quantified before and after initiation of therapy (25 weeks). Through sequencing the C2V3 region of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope, we studied the effect of short-term
therapy on virus variants derived from naïve, central memory and effector memory CD4+ lymphocyte subsets.
Results: During short-term ART, HIV-1 infection levels declined in all lymphocyte subsets but not as much as RNA
levels in serum. Virus diversity in the naïve and central memory lymphocyte populations remained unchanged,
whilst diversity decreased in serum and the effector memory lymphocytes. ART differentially affected the virus
populations co-circulating in one individual harboring a dual HIV-1 infection. Changes in V3 charge were found in
all individuals after ART initiation with increases within the effector memory subset and decreases found in the
naïve cell population.
Conclusions: During early ART virus diversity is affected mainly in the serum and effector memory cell
compartments. Differential alterations in V3 charge were observed between effector memory and naïve
populations. While certain cell populations can be targeted preferentially during early ART, some virus strains
demonstrate varied sensitivity to therapy, as shown from studying two strains within a dual HIV-1 infected
individual.

Background
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to be successful
against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
and results in undetectable plasma levels for many
years. However, an increasing number of studies report
on adverse events and toxicities [1,2]. Additional drawbacks to therapy are adherence and the considerable
costs. In certain situations a more simplified antiretroviral regimen may be suitable, for instance as short-term
use to prevent mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT),
maintenance therapy after HAART or possibly as preexposure prophylaxis [3-7]. Despite the increased

likelihood of viremia and emergence of resistance, prophylactic and/or short-term therapeutic use largely
bypasses these disadvantages and more treatment
options remain available.
The CD4+ lymphocyte is the main target cell for HIV1 infection with the various sub-populations infected to
a different extent [8,9]. Naïve and memory lymphocyte
subsets differ in body distribution, proliferative capacity
and in expression levels of the main co-receptors for
HIV-1, CCR5 and CXCR4 [10-13]. Despite these differences, all cellular subsets are productively infected and
display a lack of viral compartmentalization among circulating cells in peripheral blood [9,14,15]. Under the
influence of long-term ART most studies describe a lack
of viral compartmentalization among HIV-1 infected
CD4 + lymphocyte subsets [16-19]. Both central and
transitional memory CD4+ lymphocytes are regarded as

cellular reservoirs for HIV-1 under therapy [20]. Baldanti and colleagues show that naïve and memory cell
numbers and HIV-1 infection levels do not differ greatly
from each other during therapy [21]. These studies
focus mainly on long-term ART and do not describe the
influence on the cell subset-specific quasi-species during
early therapy intervention. We studied alterations to
HIV-1 infection levels and viral diversity within specific
cellular subsets after short-term ART.

Methods
Five chronically HIV-1 infected individuals, who visited
frequently the outpatient clinic of the Academic Medical
Center (AMC) of the University of Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, participated in this study. These patients
received various antiviral regimens (Table 1) and their
characteristics have been described previously [9].
Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were obtained and frozen according to standard protocols. Viral loads were determined with the Versant HIV1 RNA Assay (bDNA; Bayer Diagnostics, Leverkusen,
Germany). Determination of HIV-1 subtype was performed by phylogenetic analyses and by blasting the
sequences using the Los Alamos database [22]. This
study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee
of the AMC and informed consent was provided by all
participants.
PBMC were thawed and FACS-sorted as published
previously [9]. Cells were stained with various antibodies
and three CD4+ lymphocyte subsets were sorted: naïve,
CD57- memory (or central memory) and CD57+ memory (or effector memory) CD4 + lymphocytes. All cell
sorts were performed utilizing a modified FACS DIVA.
Viral DNA from the cell subsets was isolated utilizing a
silica-based method, which was also used for RNA isolation from serum [23]. Cellular HIV-1 infection levels
were quantified using a semi-nested real-time PCR assay
[9]. This assay targets the LTR segment of the virus
genome where the second strand transfer takes place
and quantifies only fully reverse transcribed HIV-1
genomic DNA and has high specificity for all major
HIV-1 subtypes. We excluded HIV-1 quantifications of

the naïve subset of patient M16394 before therapy as
well as the effector memory subsets before and after
therapy and the memory subset after therapy of patient
M12259, since either the input (cell number or virus
copies) was too low or the outcome was unreliable.
AMV-RT (Madison, WI, USA) was used for reverse
transcription of the serum-derived RNA. The C2V3
region (HXB2 nucleotide positions 7032-7301) of the
HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified using AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase (PE Applied Biosystem, Foster City,
CA, USA). The primers (100 ng/μl) for the first-round
PCR were 5’-AATGTCAGCACAGTACAATG-3’ and 3’TCTCCTCCTCCAGGYCTGAA-5’ and for the nested
PCR 5’-CCAGTGGTATCAACTCAA-3’ and 3’-ATTTCTAAGTCCCCTCCTGA-5’. PCR products were
sequenced clonally using the TOPO II cloning system
(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Eleven to twenty-three clones
from each subset were sequenced bi-directionally using
the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and analyzed with the ABI 377 automated sequencer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Quality of the
sequences was analyzed using CodonCode Aligner version 1.5.1, after which the sequences were aligned with
BioEdit and adjusted manually with respect to the gp120
open reading frame and according to reference
sequences from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database
[22]. Molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted
using MEGA version 4 [24]. Tamura-Nei was used as
distance parameter and inter-patient cross-contamination was ruled out. Statistical analyses were performed
using the Mann-Whitney test.
Sequence data

The sequences described here were allocated the following Genbank nucleotide accession numbers: GQ389219,
GQ389220, GQ389225, GQ389227 and GQ389228.

memory CD4+ lymphocyte populations and on the viral
quasi-species present in these subsets, two to five weeks
after initiation of ART. The five patients studied harbored various HIV-1 subtypes (A, C, D and F) and
demonstrated a wide range of viral load values and CD4
counts (Table 1). Three out of five study subjects
received an RT inhibitor (AZT), one a protease inhibitor
(APV) and one received a three drug regimen (d4T/
3TC/RTV). Plasma viral load declined in four individuals by 1 to 2.4 log and one subject (M16394) experienced only a small plasma load decline (Figure 1A).
This patient already had a low viral load prior to therapy (1,026 copies/ml). Additionally, this patient had a
high CD4 count at time of therapy initiation (800 cells/
μl), which did not rise following therapy. In three of the
four patients with complete data sets intracellular HIV-1
infection levels decayed by comparable levels for all cell
subsets analyzed, by up to 1.1 log (Figure 1B). One
exception was the effector memory population of subject
M13408, the individual receiving the triple regimen,
where infection levels significantly increased 6.5-fold.
The drops in plasma viral loads would suggest that
resistance has not occurred in the patients tested during
the short time period of study.
Influence of therapy on HIV-1 quasi-species in CD4+
lymphocyte subsets

Our goal was to determine how therapy affected the
virus variants within naïve, central memory and effector
memory CD4+ T cell subsets during the initial phase of
therapy. Before therapy initiation, phylogenetic analysis
of the C2V3 region of HIV-1 gp120 envelope did not
demonstrate compartmentalization of the virus quasispecies within serum or CD4 + T cell subsets (Figure
2A). Only effector memory-derived sequences from
M12020 clustered. After initiation of therapy loss of
diversity was observed predominantly in serum, but also
within the effector memory subset (Figure 2B). Naïve-

Page 3 of 8

and central memory-derived virus showed modest
changes in diversity. The loss of diversity was highly significant in serum (p = 0.02 for subject M12259 and p <
0.0001 for all other patients; Figure 3). No diversity loss
was observed in the naïve or central memory
compartments.
To measure genetic evolution of the viral quasi-species, pair-wise distances were calculated between the
virus populations before and after start of therapy. In
serum, divergence of the viral quasi-species was
observed in three patients (indicated by an asterisk; Figure 3). This indicated selection of serum variants due to
therapy introduction. Viral divergence was absent in all
cell subsets, with the exception of the effector memory
subset in subject M12020. The absence of changes in
viral diversity and divergence within naïve and central
memory subsets as opposed to effector memory cells
and serum indicates that during early therapy the
plasma and effector memory cell compartments are
more susceptible to the effects of the drugs.
To investigate the relatedness of virus strains among
the cellular fractions the genetic distances between
HIV-1 sequences derived from the various cellular fractions were calculated. Four out of five individuals
demonstrated comparable distances before and after
start of therapy ranging from 2.4% to 7.2% (Figure 4).
After therapy initiation no change in distances were
observed and were found to be similar within each of
the cellular subsets. Subject M12020 was interesting
since inter-subset distances before therapy were not
only higher than those from all other individuals,
but also higher than values observed following therapy
(Figure 4). This individual was found to be infected
with two different subtype D virus strains (strain I and
II) as shown by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2A). In
addition, the analysis of virus sequences with DNAsp
software indicated that up to 11 possible recombination
breakpoints could be detected suggesting that these two

the median value. Pair-wise distances between both time-points were calculated (d) and when this value was higher than the diversity of either

virus strains were co-circulating within this individual
for some time (data not shown). Before therapy, strain I
was dominant in the effector cell population, while the
other cell subsets harbored strain II. Both strains were
present in serum. After therapy start, strain I disappeared from the effector memory subset but remained
in some central memory cells (Figure 2B). The replenishment of this cell subset by a different virus strain
correlated with viral divergence (Figure 3). Inter-subset
virus distances approached values observed for the
other patients harboring mono-infections, demonstrating that although some cell populations may be more
sensitive to the effects of antiretroviral therapy, differences in sensitivity amongst virus strains also exists.
These data indicate that the occurrence of dual HIV-1
infection could be an additional hurdle for therapy to
succeed.
Influence of therapy on V3 charge

Previous observations by our group and others have
shown that V3 charge influences co-receptor usage
[25,26]. Since CD4+ lymphocyte sub-populations differ
in co-receptor expression levels, we analyzed whether

therapy initiation affected the V3 charge of the virus
quasi-species in serum and lymphocyte subsets due to
the variant expression profile. We therefore compared
the V3 charge from all sequences found in the cell subsets before and after start of therapy. Sequences from all
five patients were grouped together and we observed a
clear increase in V3 charge within the effector memory
subset in three out of four subjects (Figure 5; p <
0.0001). Within the central memory subset the V3
charge did not change whilst alterations in serum varied
per patient (Figure 5; no significance). Within the naïve
subset the V3 charge decreased systematically in all
patients (p = 0.05), indicating that characteristics such
as co-receptor usage may be involved in viral selection
following initiation of therapy.

Discussion
In our study we observed comparable viral decay within
all CD4+ lymphocyte sub-populations in the peripheral
blood, except for one effector memory subset, confirming our previous observation that all CD4+ lymphocyte
subsets are productively infected with HIV-1 [9]. The
results also confirm findings from other studies

demonstrating comparable decay of productively
infected cells in peripheral blood [21,27]. A report on
preferential HIV-1 inhibition during AZT treatment in
activated cells over slowly dividing cells in vitro, may
indicate that the vast majority of virus in the circulation
comes from activated cells [28]. Although naïve and
central memory lymphocyte subsets contain more longlived resting cells than the effector memory subset and
outnumber this subset, no difference in viral decay was
observed.
Two to five weeks after initiation of ART represents
the start of the second phase of viral decay, with loss of
long-lived infected cells [29]. Here we study the early
effects of therapy on the virus populations found in the
three different lymphocyte subsets studied and compare
to the changes observed in the plasma. It may be too
early to detect differences in virus composition in cell
populations with a slower decay rate as may be seen at
a later stage when therapy is completely suppressing
virus replication. In addition, the accumulation of

time-point before (-) and after (+) initiation of ART. The graph

and ns = not significant.

replication-incompetent proviral DNA in these cell subsets together with the high rate of virus production by
effector memory cells may in part influence the
decreased viral diversity within effector memory cells,
whilst no effect was observed for the other cell subsets
during the short period of the study. M13408 was the
only patient who received a triple therapy regimen and
who surprisingly demonstrated an increase in effector
memory infection levels. Perhaps these cells possess
high P-glycoprotein efflux activity decreasing intracellular antiviral drug concentrations [30]. Although blood
CD4+ lymphocyte levels only represent a minor fraction
of the total body lymphocyte population, memory subsets in blood versus gut and lymphoid tissue counterparts are infected to the same extent [20,31], thereby
indicating that studying HIV-1 infection in blood is a
good representation of events that occur in other tissues. With respect to our approach of cloning prior to
sequencing we argue that direct sequencing would circumvent a possible cloning bias, although neither
method is more skewed than the other and both provide
for a similar measure of diversity [32]. Furthermore,
sequence bias can occur through preferential PCR
amplification and since we do not identify this in all
fractions studied or for all time-points analyzed from
the same patients we feel this can be ruled out. We are
confident that when we identify a restricted sequence
this is representative of the viral quasi-species present
within that specific fraction. In all likelihood low diversity can reflect either low infectivity or over representation of a fast replicating strain.
The more pronounced changes observed in diversity
of cell-free over cell-associated virus can be explained
by the difference in half-life, which can severely reduce
serum copy numbers [29]. Although virus diversity in
serum decreased after initiation of therapy the pair-wise

Heeregrave et al. AIDS Research and Therapy 2010, 7:42

distances calculated between time-points before and
during therapy increased, indicating different genetic
characteristics of the virus after introduction of therapy.
Virus may be produced by other cell types or derived
from compartments less accessible to antiretroviral
drugs [19,33-35]. This is in agreement with studies
demonstrating that rebound virus is distinct from variants present before start of therapy [36,37]. The
absence of divergence in the cell subsets (apart from
with patient M12020) can be explained by a moderate
drop in infection levels and smaller changes in diversity.
In M12020 the compartmentalization of effector memory-derived virus pre-therapy indicates that in the case
of dual HIV-1 infection one strain preferentially infects
a specific CD4+ lymphocyte subset. We have previously
observed in dual HIV-1 infection that one strain replicates preferentially within different cell types when compared with another strain indicating that the host cell
environment influences viral replication [9,38]. The shift
in balance between strains I and II is likely caused by
therapy, although differences in host immune pressure,
virus fitness as well as high turnover rates of the specific
cell subset may also play a role. The complete and specific infection of effector memory cells by strain I and
the rapid replenishment with a different virus strain
indicate that this cell subset may easily facilitate infection by different variants. Although strain I was not
detected in serum during therapy, its presence in longlived central memory cells at that time-point ensures
persistence of both variants. This increases the chances
of recombination and therapy resistance, raising questions as to the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy in dualinfected individuals [39]. This is in line with the more
resistant phenotype of HIV-2 over HIV-1 in dualinfected persons [40].
The pronounced increase in the gp120 V3 charge in
effector memory cells in three out of four patients
reflects increased sensitivity to therapy of virus within
this cell subset. It has been speculated that such changes
can influence co-receptor usage, including a possible
switch towards CXCR4 usage [25,26,41,42]. Four weeks
of therapy restores CCR5 expression levels, which are
increased during HIV-1 infection, while CXCR4 expression levels demonstrate a modest change [43].

Conclusions
In conclusion, ART resulted in a comparable decay of
HIV-1 infection levels in naïve and central memory subsets with minor to no changes in the viral quasi-species
present. HIV-1 copy numbers in the effector memory
subset not always decreased and the virus in this cell
subset and in serum appeared to be more sensitive to
therapy. We also observed variant sensitivity among
virus strains in a dual-infected individual. These results

provide better insights into the viral dynamics within
CD4+ lymphocyte subsets during early therapy.
