Abstract
Background: Several ways of incorporating indels into phylogenetic analysis have been suggested.
Simple indel coding has two strengths: (1) biological realism and (2) efficiency of analysis. In the
method, each indel with different start and/or end positions is considered to be a separate
character. The presence/absence of these indel characters is then added to the data set.
Algorithm: We have written a program, GapCoder to automate this procedure. The program
can input PIR format aligned datasets, find the indels and add the indel-based characters. The output
is a NEXUS format file, which includes a table showing what region each indel characters is based
on. If regions are excluded from analysis, this table makes it easy to identify the corresponding indel
characters for exclusion.
Discussion: Manual implementation of the simple indel coding method can be very timeconsuming, especially in data sets where indels are numerous and/or overlapping. GapCoder
automates this method and is therefore particularly useful during procedures where phylogenetic
analyses need to be repeated many times, such as when different alignments are being explored or
when various taxon or character sets are being explored. GapCoder is currently available for
Windows from http://www.home.duq.edu/~youngnd/GapCoder.

Background
The position of insertion/deletion mutations (indels) in
molecular data sets can be useful phylogenetic information [1–4], yet this information is rarely used, especially in
large data sets with many indels. There are three main reasons for this. First, some workers believe that indels may
be unreliable as characters [5]. However, numerous studies in which indel characters were compared with already
established tree topologies have found that these indels
are reliable in constructing phylogenies [6–11]. Second, it
can be very time-consuming to determine character states
based on gaps and enter this information into a data matrix by hand. Third, there is disagreement as to the best

method of defining homologous character states for indels. Several different methods for incorporating indels
into phylogenetic analyses have been used. We discuss
five of the most useful of these methods.
The computer program MALIGN uses the first of these
methods of including indels in sequence alignment and
phylogenetic analysis of sequences [12]. In this method,
gap characters are considered to be a fifth character state
for bases in DNA, as in Eernisse and Kluge [1]. Therefore,
adjacent gap characters are considered independently of
their neighbors, although subsequent gap characters after
the first may be weighted less heavily to reflect the

possibility of longer indel regions [12,13]. Essentially,
each individual gap position is considered as if it were a
separate indel event. This is not very realistic. Insertion or
deletion events often consist of multiple bases [14–16].
Since many gap characters do not arise independently of
one another, counting each gap character as a separate
event causes indel events to be considered multiple times
in determining phylogenetic relationships. This overweights the indels and can distort phylogenies. Simmons
and Ochoterena [16] also note a theoretical objection: because gaps are the product of the alignment procedure,
and are not actually found in organisms or their sequences, sequences with gap characters do not have anything to
compare with other sequences at the point where the gap
occurs. For these reasons, gaps should not be considered
as a fifth character state for nucleotide characters.
The second method, optimization alignment, is implemented in the program POY [17]. POY achieves a phylogenetic analysis, including indels as character state
changes, without ever creating a multiple-sequence alignment. Allthough this avoids the major problems with MALIGN, it has a limitation. Indel changes may be weighted
more heavily than substitutions, but the same weight is
used for the determining the position of indels and phylogenetic analysis. For example, it is not possible to use a
gap weight of 10 (an indel is equivalent to 10 substitutions), as is common in protein-coding regions, without
also weighing that change 10 times as much as a substitution in phylogenetic analysis.
The third method to be considered is the multistate gap
region method [4,18–20]. In this method, areas of overlapping indels, gap regions, are coded as individual characters. Different indels within each region are considered
to be different states for the corresponding multistate gap
region characters [4]. Within the DNA sequences, gap
characters are coded as missing data, and the gap region
characters are then placed at the end of each sequence.
This method is useful because it does code indels as separate characters and does consider contiguous gap characters as related. However, the number of character states for
each gap region can be quite large. Since there are so many
different possible states, these characters can be less informative regarding relationships than other methods.
Simmons and Ochoterena have proposed a fourth method for coding indels [16]. This method is termed "simple
indel coding". Similar to the third method, this process
codes indels as separate characters in a data matrix, which
is then considered along with the DNA base characters in
phylogenetic analysis. Each indel with different start and/
or end positions is considered to be a separate character,
which all of the taxa under consideration either have or
lack. If one of the indels completely overlaps an indel con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/4/6

tained within another sequence, the sequences containing
the longer indel are coded as being inapplicable for the
shorter indel. This is done because it is impossible to determine whether or not the shorter indel is present in the
sequences containing the longer one. Simple indel coding
has the advantages of being conservative and easy to implement while still allowing indels to be highly informative in determining a correct phylogeny [16].
The final method for indel coding is also described by
Simmons and Ochoterena [16]. This method is called
complex indel coding. This method attempts to better account for the fact that indels are evolutionarily related to
one another, and that an indel region may be modified
through additional insertion/deletion events to yield a
different indel region in another sequence. Complex indel
coding, like simple indel coding, codes indels with different start and end positions as individual characters. However, overlapping indels may represent an evolutionary
transition sequence [16]. Step matrices are constructed to
accommodate this possibility. Complex indel coding utilizes more of the available information and never implies
fewer steps than what is biologically realistic. However,
this method generates some multi-state characters and
step matrices and is thus more complicated to program.
Also, the step matrices slow down phylogenetic programs.
For a more thorough discussion of indels and their purpose in phylogenetic analysis, see reference [16].

Algorithm
The GapCoder program
Simple indel coding [16] was chosen for implementation
because it is a relatively simple algorithm. In addition,
simple indel coding does not make as many assumptions
as complex indel coding. As a result, GapCoder should be
acceptable to a wide range of researchers with different
views about the exact nature of indels. GapCoder considers homologous indels or gaps to be those with the same
start and end positions in the nucleotide sequences. Indels are not homologous if they have differing lengths, because it would take additional mutations to transform one
into another [16]. GapCoder takes a pre-aligned PIR-format or modified FASTA-format file as input, and examines
it to gather information about the positions of the indel
regions. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the two valid input file
types. The first of these file types, the PIR-format file, can
be automatically generated by programs such as ClustalX.
The second file type, the modified FASTA-format file, is
shown in Figure 2. This file differs from the standard FASTA-format by the inclusion of the two numbers at the top
of the file. The first number is the number of taxa contained in the file, and the second number is the number
of bases in each of the taxa. The taxon names and sequences are placed below the numbers. The output from GapCoder is a NEXUS-format file. The new characters created

Sample output file. Output files are in the NEXUS format and ready to be input into PAUP or other programs that use this format. The indel characters have been added to the matrix and a table of correspondences is appended in the form of a comment, showing each indel character and the position of the indel upon which it is based. The Equate command allows 0 and 1
to be used, while maintaining the data type as 'DNA'. This allows one to perform maximum likelihood and other analyses that
require this data type, though if a model of DNA substitution is applied, it may be most appropriate to exclude the indel characters from the analysis. They probably don't evolve according to the same model as substitutions.

by the algorithm are placed at the end of the data. In addition, a table of correspondences between the indels and
their codes is placed at the bottom of the file. If regions are
excluded from an analysis, this table makes it easy to identify the corresponding indel characters for exclusion. An
example output file corresponding to the input given in
Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3. The indel characters coded by the program can be seen listed at the end. Each indel
character can be in one of three states for each taxon:
present, missing or inapplicable. The indel characters are
coded with a '1' for present, '0' for missing, and '-' for inapplicable. When one or more indels are contained completely within a larger indel, all of the taxa that have the
larger indel are coded with inapplicable ('-') characters for
the smaller indels. For example, consider the first two indels listed in the correspondence table at the bottom of
Figure 3. The table lists these indels as characters 17 and
18 at the ends of the sequences. The indel represented by
character 17 occurs from characters 3–7 in the matrix. TaxonB and TaxonG have the indel in place of bases 3–7 and
receive a '1' for character 17. Character 18 occurs from
characters 4–5. TaxonC and TaxonH clearly have the indel
and are scored as '1' for character 18. However, since the
first indel completely covers the entire region of the second indel, it is unclear whether TaxonB or TaxonG could
have had the first indel. Therefore, these taxa are given a '' for character 18.

Discussion
GapCoder has the potential to be useful in phylogenetics,
especially in non-protein-coding regions where indels can
be as plentiful as substitutions. Whenever multiple phylogenetic analyses are performed, or greater resolution is required, GapCoder provides an efficient way to incorporate
the phylogenetic information contained in the indels. For
example, the output resulting from GapCoder may be
used in exploratory analyses of optimal DNA sequence
alignment. Such an analysis would likely include GapCoder as part of an objective method with four stages. In
the first stage, several alignments would be created using
a program such as ClustalX. GapCoder would then be
used to code the indels into the data matrix. Next, a phylogenetic analysis of the data would be performed using
software such as PAUP. Finally, the best alignment could
be chosen using the desired optimality criterion. GapCoder is also useful when different character sets and/or taxon
sets are being explored, such as when different combinations of outgroups are tried. This often requires re-aligning the data set for each taxon set; GapCoder allows the
indel characters to be quickly added each time.
