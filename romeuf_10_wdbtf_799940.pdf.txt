Abstract
Background: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by interacting with promoters of their target
genes and are classified into families based on their DNA-binding domains. Genes coding for TFs have been
identified in the sequences of model plant genomes. The rice (Oryza sativa spp. japonica) genome contains 2,384
TF gene models, which represent the mRNA transcript of a locus, classed into 63 families.
Results: We have created an extensive list of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) TF sequences based on sequence
homology with rice TFs identified and classified in the Database of Rice Transcription Factors (DRTF). We have
identified 7,112 wheat sequences (contigs and singletons) from a dataset of 1,033,960 expressed sequence tag and
mRNA (ET) sequences available. This number is about three times the number of TFs in rice so proportionally is
very similar if allowance is made for the hexaploidy of wheat. Of these sequences 3,820 encode gene products
with a DNA-binding domain and thus were confirmed as potential regulators. These 3,820 sequences were
classified into 40 families and 84 subfamilies and some members defined orphan families. The results were
compiled in the Database of Wheat Transcription Factor (wDBTF), an inventory available on the web
http://wwwappli.nantes.inra.fr:8180/wDBFT/. For each accession, a link to its library source and its Affymetrix
identification number is provided. The positions of Pfam (protein family database) motifs were given when known.
Conclusions: wDBTF collates 3,820 wheat TF sequences validated by the presence of a DNA-binding domain out
of 7,112 potential TF sequences identified from publicly available gene expression data. We also incorporated in
silico expression data on these TFs into the database. Thus this database provides a major resource for systematic
studies of TF families and their expression in wheat as illustrated here in a study of DOF family members expressed
during seed development.

Background
Gene expression at the level of mRNA transcription from
DNA is regulated through different mechanisms, the most
widely studied being regulation by transcription factors
(TFs). These DNA-binding proteins control gene expression by interacting with cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in
the promoters of their target genes. DNA-binding
domains are in general highly conserved among species so
their characteristics are used to classify TFs into families.
Transcriptional control of gene expression influences
many biological processes such as responses to the environment or stress and regulation of metabolic pathways.

The sequencing of model plant genomes has allowed
many genes coding for TFs to be identified. A total of
1,533 TFs were identified in the Arabidopsis thaliana
genome [1] and classified into 34 families. Comparing
these with TF genes in other eukaryotic genomes, i.e., of
Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, the size of TF families differs considerably
across the eukaryote kingdoms and about 45% of Arabidopsis TFs are from families specific to plants [2]. In
Oryza sativa spp. japonica, Xiong et al. [3] identified
1,611 TF genes belonging to 37 gene families. Most TF
families are of similar size in rice and in Arabidopsis [3].
Information on the TFs of model species has been
organized into databases. Arabidopsis TF sequences
were compiled and classified into families by several
groups: the Riechmann group, the Sheen group http://
genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/sheenweb/AraTRs.html,

OHIO-ATTFDB [4], RARTF http://rarge.gsc.riken.jp/
rartf/, TRANSFAC [5] and TrSDB [6]. Another Arabidopsis TF database (DATF, http://datf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/)
was created that integrates information from multiple
sources (expressed sequence tags (ESTs), transcription
factor binding sites) and contains 1,922 known or predicted TF sequences, classified in 64 families [7]. The
same approach was taken for both O. sativa spp. japonica and spp. indica to create DRTF http://drtf.cbi.pku.
edu.cn/, which contains 2,384 rice TF sequences classified in 63 families [8]. The discrepancies in the total
number of TFs included in databases and the classification into families for the same species depends on the
methods used for predicting TFs. For example, the differences between the dataset in DRTF and the results of
Xiong et al. [3] are mostly because of new annotation in
the latest version (Release 4) of the TIGR database that
uses a broader definition of TFs. The sensu stricto definition of TFs is based on the DNA binding domain, but
in the broader sense proteins having co-activator activity
can also be considered as TFs. This broader definition
explains why more TF families (63 versus 37) were
found more recently.
Wheat is the most important crop in world food production. Triticum aestivum and other cereal genomes are
substantially larger than those of A. thaliana and O.
sativa. The genome of hexaploid wheat is about 16,000
Mb which is 38 times larger than that of the monocotyledon model O. sativa. It is an allohexaploid composed of
three homoeologous subgenomes, AA, BB, and DD, thus
generally each gene is represented by three homoeologous copies. The large hexaploid nature of the genome is
a drawback in determining the complete sequence which
is not yet available. Nevertheless, many wheat cDNA
libraries have been constructed generating a rich source
of ESTs; more than one million wheat ESTs are currently
available in dbEST [9]. These ESTs have been assembled
into contigs such as Tentative consensus (TC) contigs
([10]; http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.
pl?gudb=Wheat) along with data collated from the NCBI
GenBank nucleotide database (full length and partial
cDNAs). ESTs directly represent the transcribed portions
of the genome so while waiting for the full genome to be
sequenced, the analysis of expressed sequences is a good
starting point for gene discovery.
Recently some T. aestivum TF families have been
described such as MIKC-type MADS-box [11], NF-Y
and Dr1 [12], Myb [13] and the plant-specific DOF
(DNA-binding with One Finger) gene families [14,15].
The DNA-binding domain of DOF proteins contains 52
amino acids structured as a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger [16].
This domain recognizes and binds a core motif 5’AAAG-3’ on gene promoters [17]. In the Arabidopsis
and rice genomes 36 and 30 Dof genes have been

Page 2 of 15

identified, respectively, and phylogenetic relationships
between the genes have been established such that four
major orthologous clusters have been defined [1,15].
Recently, 26 different Dof genes were identified in barley
by sequence analysis of clones isolated by screening
genomic libraries and ESTs [18]. By analysing soybean
ESTs, 39 putative unigenes that encode DOF proteins
were identified [19], 27 of which were confirmed as having the highly conserved domain [20].
DOF TFs participate in the regulation of many processes exclusive to plants. For example in barley, DOF
TFs are involved at several developmental stages in
seeds, in the accumulation of storage proteins and in
germination [21-23]. In wheat, two Dof genes have been
reported: wheat prolamin-box binding factor (WPBF),
shown to be an activator of T. aestivum L. storage protein genes [24], and TaDof1 [25]. The three homoeologous genes encoding WPBF were sequenced and shown
to be specifically expressed in seeds between 3 and 39
days after anthesis [26].
The aim of this study was to identify all unique T.
aestivum TFs (i.e. each homoeolog is considered independently) by using generally available wheat transcript
sequences and the model plant rice genome. We constructed a database compiling the wheat TF sequences
identified, the corresponding in silico expression data
and the predicted DNA-binding domains. The study of
DOF family members illustrates the utility of wDBTF
and the overall analytical approach.

Construction and content
Source data and database construction

The 2,384 putative TF protein sequences of O. sativa
japonica were downloaded from the DRTF database
http://drtf.cbi.pku.edu.cn/. T. aestivum sequences were
downloaded from the Gene Indices database (wheat latest release 11.0, http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/
plant.html) which represents 1,036,933 sequences either
as TC contigs or singletons. The wheat sequences were
translated to peptide sequences and compared using the
BlastX program [27] with O. sativa japonica TF proteins. We used an e-value cut-off of 1e-05 with other
parameters at the default setting, keeping only the best
Blast hit. As TFs are composed of several conserved
domains, some BlastX results gave a high Blast score
against a rice TF protein because of particular conserved
domains but were not really related to the query TF. To
avoid such false associations, all Blast results were
checked by eye and the database was edited to remove
2,296 sequences. The wheat TF sequences identified
were compiled in the wDBTF database (Figure 1).
The amino acid sequences from T. aestivum were
deduced from BlastX alignment against O. sativa proteins using the method described by Sado et al. [28].

Figure 1 Schematic representation of the wDBTF wheat transcription factor database. The core database contains rice gene models from
DRTF. The wheat data is made up of publicly available expressed sequences either singletons or assembled contigs. wDBTF includes information
on 7,112 identified wheat TFs, on the DNA-binding domains (where known) and on in silico expression.

Only the protein sequence regions that matched a TF
sequence were taken into account. The presence of
DNA-binding domain for each wheat TF sequence identified was searched against the Pfam database. The evalue cut-off 1e-01 was used in the initial Hidden Markov Model (HMMer) searches. For families which have
no DNA-binding domain profiles available in the Pfam
database, each sequence was analyzed individually to
decide the cut-off value and sequences with more than
60% identity with their respective sequences from rice
were considered to be bona fide members.
The Affymetrix wheat genome array contains 61,127
probe sets which represent 55,052 transcripts. Blast
searches were performed against the probe set data to
assign an Affymetrix ID to individual sequences.
Details of the all the original EST libraries were collated from the NCBI Unigene site http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/unigene. The list of 226 libraries used for this
database is provided in Additional file 1. The origins of
expressed sequences were classified in six categories:
root, crown, shoot, leaf, whole plant if the origin is
unknown, and spike for whole organs and tissues within
the spike at different developmental stages from flowering to maturation (Figure 2).
All data were imported and formatted using custom
PERL scripts and stored in a PostgreSQL database,

named wDBTF, publicly available at http://wwwappli.
nantes.inra.fr:8180/wDBFT/. The web site was developed
with Java applet and servlet technologies. The wDBTF
web pages are conceptual views of the PostgreSQL relational database.
Identification of TFs in T. aestivum

Comparative analysis of wheat and rice TFs based on
sequence identity was performed to identify all unique
TFs in public transcript sequences of wheat.
Each of the 216,452 unique wheat sequences (contigs
and singletons) from the TIGR assembly of ESTs and
transcripts was systematically compared with rice TF
proteins using Blastx. The sequences matching rice TFs
(e-value < 1e-05) were defined as TF-encoding
sequences. Any sequences which did not correspond to
potential TFs were discarded. In this way we found
7,112 accessions from TIGR correspond to T. aestivum
TFs. These sequences were represented by 3,790 TCs
and 3,322 singletons (Table 1). Evidence of a conserved
DNA-binding domain was detected for 51.8% of the
wheat sequences identified, i.e. 3,681 sequences (Table
1). For 8 (GRF, LUG, NZZ, Trihelix, ULT, Whirly,
HRT-like and VOZ) out of 84 subfamilies, no DNAbinding domain motifs are available in the Pfam database, so we established whether a wheat sequence

belongs to a specific TF subfamily according to its
degree of similarity to the respective subfamily member
from rice. After this step 3,820 sequences were found to
correspond to bona fide wheat TFs as they have the
DNA-binding domain required to validate their status as
transcriptional regulators.
We chose to keep all sequences identified by their
overall similarity with rice TF proteins in wDBTF and
gave information on the positions of Pfam motifs on the
table of subfamilies web page.

Classification of wheat TF families

The wheat sequences were assigned to TF families by
taking into account the best BLAST hit against rice TF
proteins classified in the DRTF database http://drtf.cbi.
pku.edu.cn/. In the wheat data set we found members
corresponding to every rice TF family suggesting that
TF families are conserved between rice and wheat. In
wDBTF, wheat TF members were distributed across 40
families and 84 subfamilies. The NAC subfamily is the
largest with at least 269 members. Among the other

d

available in the Pfam database, so their attribution to a TF subfamily depended on their similarity to respective member sequences from rice database.
b

large TF subfamilies in wheat are the EREBP, AUX/
IAA, bHLH, R2R3-MYB, bZIP, WRKY and C3H zinc
finger families each with more than 150 members. At
the other extreme, three subfamilies (LFY, SRS and LS)
are each represented by a single gene. Wheat appears
to have more AUX/IAA, CCATT-Dr1, HMG, MBF,
S1Fa-like, Whirly and VOZ genes than would be predicted by comparing the number of genes proportionally to the number in rice, i.e. more than three times
more. For each TF subfamily, a web page is available
listing all accession numbers either for contigs or
singletons.

Wheat TF expression in silico

Almost 50% of sequences identified as wheat TFs are
singletons and the majority (70%) of wheat TF contigs
are made up of 2-5 ESTs. For all the families, the average number of ESTs per contig is 6.8. This suggests that
wheat TFs, like other plant TFs, are not highly
expressed.
By referring to the source of the material used to
make each EST library, in silico expression data for each

Blast searches against the probe data sets. However, several sequences correspond to the same Affymetrix ID so
only 2,036 are unique. This information was added to
wDBTF as it could facilitate the study of families or
organ-specific TF expression as the expression information relating to each probe can be analyzed across all
publicly available Affymetrix results.
Plant material for C2C2-Dof expression analysis

The wheat Dof TF sequences identified in silico were
validated biologically by testing for their gene expression
in seeds of T. aestivum line RE99006. Seeds were sown
in 294-cm3 pots filled with a peat moss mix and kept in
a greenhouse for 2 weeks. After 8 weeks of vernalization, the plants were transplanted to soil beds in a
greenhouse with daily maximum/minimum air temperatures averaging 21°C/15°C and day/night relative humidity averaging 50%/60%. At anthesis, spikes were tagged
when the anthers of the central florets appeared and the
temperature was monitored every 30 min by four
HOBO® H8 Indoor 8K Data Loggers (Onset Computer
Corp., Bourne, MA). Two ears per plant were harvested
every 50°C days from ovary stage until 600°C days after
anthesis. All samples were taken at 11.00am to avoid
possible diurnal effects on gene expression. Three independent biological replicates were used. The grains of
central florets were collected, the embryo and the external pericarp were rapidly removed, and the endosperm
was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C prior
to RNA extraction.
C2C2-Dof expression during seed development

Total RNA was extracted from ovaries and developing
grains (without the embryo and external pericarp) as
described in Khaled et al. [29]. Dof transcripts were
amplified by PCR with an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems) using Power
SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific primer pairs used for Dof amplification were
designed with Oligo6® and are listed in Additional file 2.
Amplification of transcripts coding for actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation
factor 1 alpha (eF1a), b-tubulin, and 18S was used for
internal controls. The geometric mean was calculated
and the normalized quantity of each gene transcript and
standard deviation of the three replicates was then calculated [30]. All primer pairs gave an amplification efficiency of 100% ± 10% and were comparable. The
specificity of amplification products was assessed by
analyzing their melting curves and by gel electrophoresis
(giving a single band). Amplification plots and predicted
threshold cycle values were obtained from three

Utility
wDBTF search

wDBTF is an integrated database which compiles all
wheat sequences identified as TFs from publicly available expression data. Brought together in this form the
data constitute a major resource for the study of gene
expression in wheat and of plant TF families in general.
The wDBTF home page is the main web interface for
all information contained in the database (Figure 3).
The TF family names link to individual TF family or
subfamily pages. Each TF family has its own dedicated
page that contains 2 tables, either contigs or singletons,
with all TF sequence accessions from the group.
The results page returns essential and comprehensive
information, such as accession ID, best rice protein
Blast hit, positions of Pfam domains and corresponding
Affymetrix ID. In silico expression data is available for
each accession referring to EST library sources. TF protein and DNA sequences and expression data can be
downloaded from the wDBTF web site. Therefore, each
family’s results page integrates a large amount of data
from multiple sources and is a good tool for research on
the whole set of 7,112 TFs. Furthermore, classification
associated with information on gene expression can be
used to link candidate TFs to a given biological process.
Analysis of C2C2-Dof family

To illustrate our approach to in silico data analysis, we
focused on the plant-specific Dof family. We identified
59 unique Dof sequences which are made of 186
expressed sequences in the above T. aestivum sequence
output. In the wheat data set, 28 sequences cover Dof
domains but only 22 cover it entirely. Dof domains of
previously identified Dof genes from O. sativa japonica
and Hordeum vulgare, described by Moreno-Risueno et
al. [18], were downloaded from Genbank and were compared to the deduced amino acid sequences of the 22
wheat genes to establish relationships between the genes
from different species. The conserved 50-amino acid
Dof domains of the DOF proteins were aligned using
CLUSTALW [31] and the resultant multiple alignment
(Additional file 3) was represented as an unrooted
neighbor-joining tree edited with the Treeview© (v1.6.6)
program [32] (Figure 4). Wheat Dof were present in the
seven groups observed for the Dof family thus Dof
members from the three cereals appeared in all the subfamilies independently of the species. Members were
found for all major orthologous clusters (MCOG-A, -B,
-C and -D) defined by Lijavetzky et al. [15]. Group I
was shown to correspond to MCOG-B, group II to

IV, V and VI to MCOG-D.
Expression of T. aestivum Dof genes

We found 59 wheat Dof represented by 25 contigs and
34 singletons. Of the Dof contigs 60% are made up of 15 sequences, while only 5 have more than 10 ESTs indicative of high in silico expression.
Of all the wheat Dof expressed sequences 48% come
from spike libraries (Figure 5). In silico expression data
show that 25 expressed Dof sequences from six contigs

(Figure 6) and 19 singletons (Additional file 4) were
detected only in spikes. Our primary focus is on identifying wheat Dof involved in endosperm development.
cDNA made from RNA extracted from seed (300
degree-days after anthesis) of an INRA breeding line
RE99006 was tested for the presence of 20 Dof transcripts using gene-specific PCR primers (Additional file
2); all these Dof transcripts were confirmed to be
expressed in seeds (data not shown). To establish
whether they are involved in wheat grain development,
we tested the expression of 12 transcripts in

endosperm at different seed developmental stages (Figure 7) by real time PCR. The same primers as above
were used that gave efficient amplification and only
one PCR-product in dissociation curves. Wheat Dof
can be classified into 3 classes according to their
expression profiles. Three Dof (TC298479, BE497753
and BE516595) are preferentially expressed during the
first step of development when the grain is growing
and their expression decreases down to a basal level in
the grain-filling and drying-down stages. According to
the second expression profile TC332787, TC285930
and CK208471 can be grouped together. These transcripts are detected through all developmental stages
with three expression peaks: at the ovary stage, at early
(150 degree-days) and mid grain-filling. Conversely to
the first class, the third class groups Dof that are
expressed at a basal level at the beginning of grain
development increasing to a maximum midway
through grain-filling when starch and storage proteins
accumulate.

Discussion
TFs are important for the regulation of eukaryotic gene
expression. In constructing wDBTF the goal was to be
comprehensive in collating both the wheat TF sequences
and the information about each TF. Instead of relying
entirely on computational prediction, we combined
automated searches and manual curation to improve the
quality of the database. In wDBTF, we define TFs as
proteins that show sequence-specific DNA binding and
are able to activate and/or repress transcription.
The large genome size of wheat (approximately 16,000
Mb) and its polyploid nature make the goal of sequencing the wheat genome a difficult one. ESTs are created
by partially sequencing randomly isolated gene transcripts and they play an important role in gene discovery. The availability of more than 1 million T. aestivum
ESTs derived from more than 250 libraries has proved
an adequate resource for identifying wheat TFs with the
added advantage that it can be used to identify tissuespecific expression patterns. In wDBTF, we considered

226 libraries that represent 98% of the publicly available
wheat sequences of this kind.
The genomes of grasses are very different in terms of
size, ploidy level and chromosome number. Despite
these significant differences, the linear order of genes
and protein coding sequences are very well conserved
between genomes. Thus, the rice genome can serve as a
good model for identifying genes in larger non
sequenced genomes like the wheat genome. In addition,
O. sativa TFs have been well defined [3,8] and information on these TFs has been organized into databases.
Thus this species is ideally suited for comparative genomics like identifying wheat TFs. In the first step of our
study, we used all TF protein sequences from rice DRTF
as seed in Blast searches to better identify wheat TFs
compared to using HMMER or core-consensus
sequences. Significant similarity between known rice TF
proteins and wheat accessions showed that 7,112 wheat
accessions potentially belong to TF gene families. A
minimum of 3,820 genes really corresponded to wheat
TFs as they have a DNA-binding domain characteristic
of a regulatory protein. Within the wheat data, we
found members corresponding to every rice TF family
suggesting that TF families are conserved between rice
and wheat. Previous global approaches to studying plant
TFs have already led to some TFs being identified from
bread wheat ESTs [33]. PlantTFDB http://planttfdb.cbi.

pku.edu.cn is a plant TF database for five model organisms, including Arabidopsis (DATF) and rice (DRTF),
and 17 other plant species including wheat [33]. In
October 2006 1,127 TFs were identified from wheat
transcripts available in PlantGDB (v155a; http://www.
plantgdb.org/) based on HMMER searches of the Pfam
database (v20.0). These 1,127 TFs were classified into 57
families. For six families - GARP-ARR-B, HRT-like,
LFY, NZZ, SRS, and ZF-HD - no TF was identified
based on these criteria and no detail was given on
whether allowance was made for the polyploidy of
wheat. Two reasons could explain the differences
between the results of this previous study and the work
we report here. First, the results depend on the methods
and cut-offs used, more or less stringent, to predict TFs.
Depending on how the data is to be used, either high
sensitivity or high specificity may be more desirable.
Generally, stringent filtering is used to avoid false positives. To increase the chances of isolating TF genes
from expressed sequences, especially for short or incomplete sequences and divergent members of gene families,
we used less stringent criteria. Second, progress in generating DNA sequences in recent years has vastly
increased the number of expressed sequences available
in databanks to be searched. As the full genome
sequence of wheat is not yet available, using all these
sequences to update the catalogue of TF genes is useful.

Figure 6 Tissue specific in silico expression of wheat Dof as represented by EST contigs.

To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of TFs identified in this way, we compared our results to other
recent studies of wheat TF families. Using rice TF proteins from PlnTFDB v2.0 as seed in Tblastn searches,
Shaw et al. [34] identified wheat Dof. Sequences containing the Dof domain were re-assembled with the criterion of 98% nucleotide identity thus defining 31 Dof
genes. Similarly, we identified 28 Dof-domain genes
using a different strategy based on another source of
rice protein sequences. The differences observed may
come from the way ESTs are assembled and from the
discovery of a previously unpublished Dof member.
Another TF family has been studied in detail by Stephenson et al. [12] who identified 37 CCAAT binding
factors based in a Tblastn search of several EST sources
(available in October 2006) with an e-value cutoff of 1e08 using the core-conserved sequences of O. sativa and
A. thaliana. With recent data and less stringent criteria
we detected 81 CCAAT binding factors including those
TFs previously detected. The results obtained with Dof

and CCAAT TFs suggest that our approach performs
well and with acceptable accuracy.
In plants, 5% to 7% of all the protein-encoding genes
are for TFs [1,35]. Because many of the grass genomes
are not yet completely sequenced or annotated, the total
number of TFs expected is hard to predict. Based on
the information available for four sequenced genomes, i.
e. from Arabidopsis, rice, poplar (Populus trichocarpa),
and Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), linear regression was used to predict the number of TFs in
non sequenced genomes from the total number of genes
[36]. Studies based on the annotation of BAC sequences
suggest that the hexaploid wheat genome could contain
108,000 genes [37] or between 164,000 and 334,000 protein-encoding genes including pseudogenes [38]. Thus,
applying the linear regression to wheat would give 9,676
TFs. We have found a minimum of 3,820 sequences
coding for TFs in data currently available, i.e. almost
40% of the expected number. However, 7,112 (about
73% of the expected number) wheat accessions have

similarity with known rice TF proteins and could be
potential TFs. Although further experimental evidence is
needed to validate whether they really belong to TF
families, we decided to keep all sequences in wDBTF so
users can themselves judge the sequences with no
DNA-binding domain.
The 3,820 wheat sequences identified as TFs represent
1.8% of all available unique wheat sequences. TF expression is mostly specific to a particular tissue or developmental stage and most TFs are also known to be
expressed at a low level. We have shown that almost
50% of sequences identified as wheat TFs are singletons
and 70% of contigs comprised just a few ESTs. This
confirms that wheat TFs are expressed at a low level
and suggests that perhaps not all TF sequences are
represented in the EST libraries available. Therefore in
our analysis of wheat expressed sequences, the number
of TF genes could be underestimated. Until the whole
genome sequence is available, it is unlikely that all the

TFs can be identified based only on transcript
sequences.
TFs have evolved by accumulating mutations, so the
complexity in gene regulation patterns has increased.
Much of the innovation in biological function has been
attributed to events of gene duplication. Wheat appears
to have more AUX/IAA, CCATT-Dr1, HMG, MBF,
S1Fa-like, Whirly and VOZ compared with the predicted number, i.e. three times more than in rice. However, the largest families (EREBP, NAC, bHLH, R2R3MYB, bZIP, WRKY and C3H zinc finger) do not exceed
the proportional number predicted from rice. These preliminary results tend to confirm the coding theory that
predicts that there are limits to the TF repertoire of
cells. From each superfamily, the maximal number of
TFs seems to correlate with the number of DNA bases
effectively recognized by the binding mechanism of that
superfamily. This limit of expansion is thought to minimize cross-binding errors between TFs [39].

Comprehensive Affymetrix GeneChip platforms have
now been developed for wheat based on extensive EST
collections http://www.plexdb.org/index.php. The Affymetrix wheat genome array can provide useful data on
organ and developmental stage expression. We found
4,305 out of the 7,112 wDBTF wheat sequences represented on the Affymetrix wheat genome array. However,
several sequences correspond to the same Affymetrix ID
and only 2,036 are unique. Thus, this result is in agreement with those of Wan et al. [40] who found about
2,000 probe sets for potential TFs. Analysis of expression using this microarray platform can be difficult
because of the often confounding presence of multiple
splice forms, paralogs and orthologs, and, in the case of
polyploids, homoeologs with near-identical sequences
[41]. In general the wheat GeneChip is not able to distinguish contributions from individual homoeologs. As
the probe sequences were specifically taken from conserved regions of consensus sequences, the expression
profiles measured represent a sum of the individual profiles of the relevant homoeologs for ~90% of genes [42].
Furthermore, the expression measured could also be the
sum of the expression of several splicing variants. TFs
derived from the same precursor mRNA by alternative
splicing may have distinct regulatory functions. In
wheat, this kind of mRNA processing has been shown
for some TF genes like the A and D copies of Viviparous 1 (TaVp1) [43] and for wDreb2 [44]. Parameters
used in TIGR assembly often place homoeologous genes
and alternative splicing variants in separate contigs and
thus the difference observed between the number of
sequences matching Affymetrix ID probes and the number of probes might be expected. On the other hand,
singleton ESTs, relatively abundant in our study, tend to
be shorter increasing the chances of confusion when trying to match them to a particular sequence present on
GeneChip.
We used the Dof TF family to validate our strategy for
identifying wheat TFs. Based on sequence identity with
rice gene models, 59 potential Dof genes were identified.
Multiple alignment of the entire Dof domain showed
that wheat sequences were distributed in seven groups
among all four major orthologous clusters suggesting
this TF family is organized similarly in the species
studied.
We used the database to select Dof involved in wheat
grain development based on in silico expression criteria.
First we verified these genes were indeed expressed in
seed and then established the pattern of expression of
12 transcripts during seed development. For seven Dof
(TC289916, TC277573, TC339845, CA484955,
TC316155 and TC315813), expression reached a maximum in the middle of the grain-filling phase when

Page 13 of 15

starch and storage proteins accumulate. Accession
TC315813 is wheat prolamin-box binding factor
(WPBF), which was shown to be an activator of storage
protein genes [24]. Its expression parallels the increase
in abundance of transcripts encoding low molecular
weight glutenin subunits and alpha gliadin genes consistent with a role in prolamin gene expression [40]. Thus,
Dof TF expression profiles like that of Wpbf could be
potential regulators of grain filling. In expressed
sequences, there are few nucleotide variations between
homoeologs. Thus the probability of designing primers
specific to one or two copies is low. All the primers
used amplified products from T. urartu, Aegilops speltoides and A. taushii which confirms that potentially all
copies which are expressed in hexaploid wheat are
amplified. Thus, the expression profiles measured for
any particular gene may represent the expression of all
its homoeologs. Plant responses to allopolyploidy
include unequal expression of duplicated genes and
gene silencing. Studies in wheat [45,46] have shown that
novel patterns of gene expression occur in polyploids
that are not observed in diploid progenitor species.
Furthermore, in silico analysis of gene expression has
shown that there may be preferential expression of
homoeologous genes between genomes and a uniform
level of expression of all three homoeologs is only
observed for about 20% of the genes [45]. A recent
study on the wheat TF Spa has demonstrated that the
three copies were expressed during all stages of grain
development in similar patterns. However, there was
more Spa transcript from B genome than A and D transcripts [47]. To study patterns of gene expression in
bread wheat, it will be essential to develop an assay that
allows genome/homoeolog-specific gene expression to
be quantified. Our preliminary results provide an overview of Dof expression and further research will confirm
which homoeologous genes are implicated in the grainfilling mechanism.

Conclusions
The genome sequence of wheat is not yet available so
analyzing the systematically produced sequences of
cDNA libraries is a powerful way to identify many transcripts that can then be studied in terms of their gene
expression and functional genomics. In our study, wheat
TF sequences were identified based on their similarity
to those in the model plant rice. Organized in a dedicated database available on our web site, and classified
in families are 7,112 potential unique wheat TFs, 3,820
of which have a DNA-binding domain. For each
sequence, in silico expression data is given. The database
will therefore be a major resource for the plant research
community for future studies of wheat TFs.
