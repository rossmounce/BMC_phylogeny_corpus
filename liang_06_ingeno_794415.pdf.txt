Abstract
Background: Systematic genome comparisons are an important tool to reveal gene functions,
pathogenic features, metabolic pathways and genome evolution in the era of post-genomics.
Furthermore, such comparisons provide important clues for vaccines and drug development.
Existing genome comparison software often lacks accurate information on orthologs, the function
of similar genes identified and genome-wide reports and lists on specific functions. All these
features and further analyses are provided here in the context of a modular software tool "inGeno"
written in Java with Biojava subroutines.
Results: InGeno provides a user-friendly interactive visualization platform for sequence
comparisons (comprehensive reciprocal protein – protein comparisons) between complete
genome sequences and all associated annotations and features. The comparison data can be
acquired from several different sequence analysis programs in flexible formats. Automatic dot-plot
analysis includes output reduction, filtering, ortholog testing and linear regression, followed by
smart clustering (local collinear blocks; LCBs) to reveal similar genome regions. Further, the system
provides genome alignment and visualization editor, collinear relationships and strain-specific
islands. Specific annotations and functions are parsed, recognized, clustered, logically concatenated
and visualized and summarized in reports.
Conclusion: As shown in this study, inGeno can be applied to study and compare in particular
prokaryotic genomes against each other (gram positive and negative as well as close and more
distantly related species) and has been proven to be sensitive and accurate. This modular software
is user-friendly and easily accommodates new routines to meet specific user-defined requirements.

Background
Genomes are dynamic in nature and are known to
undergo various types of changes in their evolution. Gene
duplications result in paralogs, whereas gene deletions
may induce loss of functionality. Recombination causes
genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer introduces
genetic materials into bacterial chromosomes, enabling

the organism to recruit novel metabolic enzymes and consequently to survive in a different environment [1].
Early comparison methods to evaluate genome differences such as Needleman-Wunsch global alignment [2]
and Smith-Waterman local alignment [3] were designed
to identify sequence differences on a small scale. The

methods use dynamic programming algorithms and have
been proven to be sensitive to find an optimal alignment
between sequences.
The increasing number of organisms whose genomes have
been completely sequenced demands sensitive and precise methods for aligning long DNA sequences. Local
alignments have been generally used to anchor global
alignments. A variety of approaches such as MUMMER,
WABA, AVID, Mauve and ACT [4-8] have been developed
for genome visualization. Several other programs have
been developed for specialized purposes, for instance,
sim3 uses a greedy algorithm to investigate highly similar
input sequences and works well even for long sequences
[9]. The LAGAN series and MultiPipMaker (BLASTZ) are
designed for dealing with genome rearrangements during
the alignment process [10-12].
Here we describe a novel platform-independent genome
comparison viewer, inGeno, which is user-friendly and
modular. It recognizes and illustrates the functional relationships between orthologous genes and strain-specific
genome islands. It accepts all major standard sequence
input formats (Genbank, EMBL, Fasta, GenBankXML,
SwissProt). It parses alignment reports (BLAST-type), performs a dotplot analysis, filters out the strain-specific
genes of interest using a user-specified similarity threshold and plots a comparison map with an interactive interface (according to user choices, e.g. zooming in/out;
genome representation style). The modules for information retrieval aid the user: Annotation keywords, logical
combinations and concatenations of these, genome similarities and differences are identified from plain-text
annotations and summarized and sorted by occurrences
and functional categories (as color coded bars along the
genome or as text reports).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/461

tem. This server-based version can be set up and handle a
database suitable for long-term research purposes.
Sequence comparison data on individual genes are parsed
using Biojava (re-implemented for different BLAST
reports), by which the contig data, such as location, annotation and translated protein sequence information can
be extracted efficiently from rich-format input files. A
NCBI-BLAST interface and a Smith-Waterman-BLAST
interface have both been implemented and are run for the
user to prepare the data for the further analyses listed
below.
InGeno interactively identifies and indicates the function
and description of orthologous and strain-specific gene
islands. Moreover, a keyword filter for annotation information aids the users (i) to investigate the genomes and
(ii) writes different comparison reports (e.g., all pathogenicity factors in one genome in the region of interest).
- A dot-analysis algorithm is implemented to visualize the
collinear ortholog relationships. Based on the coordinates, the program performs a linear regression and plots
the regression line [examples are shown in Additional file
1]. Strain-specific genes and orthologous genes are determined according to a user-defined threshold. A combined
threshold can be defined using multiple conditions, such
as 75% alignment coverage and 30% sequence identity in
parallel (our recommended combination).

Strategy
Two genomes are aligned to each other and the resulting
individual gene comparison outputs are parsed. This
allows to establish a dotplot and correlation analysis, a
linear regression on the orthologs and locus collinear
block (LCB) locations in the genome. Furthermore, an
interactive user interface for information retrieval enables
to inspect detailed comparison results.

- The log distances between the coordinates of each
ortholog and the resulting regression line are then calculated and sorted. They are used in the next step for the
heuristic determination of locus collinear blocks (LCB).
Eventually the program provides an interactive graphical
user interface (GUI), in which various operations are visualized. For example, each genome is represented as a
horizontal, solid line. This can be shifted horizontally and
vertically, zoomed in or out by sliders in the control
panel. Genes of the same color linked by a line denote
their orthology. These lines characterize the genome LCBs
and indicate their distances (in colors). Their numbers
and lengths can be re-defined by a slider in the control
panel. By this, genome rearrangements can be viewed distinctly, including transpositions occurring in close or long
distances.

Details
The program is completely implemented in Java and BioJava [13]. A Java runtime environment 1.5 is required to
obtain platform-independency. A standard version of the
program is available, based on an HSQL database (a relational database engine [14]) and a set of standalone tools
written in Java. A further version integrates and requires a
MySQL database engine previously installed on the sys-

- A text mining subroutine identifies functions of collinear
genes parsing blast input and sequence input annotation:
Tiny rectangles are plotted closely above the upper
genome and below the lower genome. These are filled in
different colors according to the parsed annotation files in
order to differentiate the category of potential functions,
e.g., blue denotes metabolism and enzymes, cyan denotes
transcription/regulation factors and green denotes trans-

porters/PTS systems (the color legend for this information
appears by clicking the "function" button). This strategy
improves operon recognition as well as the study of protein interactions. Another text-mining routine is implemented for the statistical analysis of strain-specific gene
annotations. All the keywords are parsed, sorted by frequencies and subsequently filtered out to rapidly review
the critical information related to different biological
functions. Furthermore, there is the option to concatenate
different keywords by logical operators (AND, NOT, OR)
and in this way create more specific lists from the complete genome annotation. In addition, an editor is integrated in inGeno to correct annotation files and safe new
annotation information.
- The program is implemented in Java for platform independency and in object-oriented programming (OOP)
design. Different BioJava modules have been integrated.
The whole structure is optimized to allow easy insertion of
new modules and functional expansion if desired by the
user.

the program checking for pseudo-genes or bad annotations. The visualization of the genome including its annotation allows the user to go over the whole genome,
correct important annotation mistakes, save all corrections made and then run inGeno again to see the result of
the two corrected genome comparison. Furthermore, a
GenomeToProteome routine [see Additional file 1] compiles from a DNA sequence which at least contains the
start and end points of the reading frames all proteins in
multi-fasta format and prepares them for systematic
genome comparison with BLAST or Smith-Watermansearch program. The output files created after the search
can again be directly parsed by inGeno [see Additional file
1] and so a comparatively raw DNA file can also be visualized with its annotation by inGeno, provided the BLAST
runs are done by the user. However, inGeno focuses on
displaying reading frames and features of the genomes
(including even RNA genes or DNA features [e.g. IS element] if they are part of the annotation report or edited
into it) but there is no direct visualization of DNA features, for this task other genome viewers, e.g. the Artemis
Comparison Tool [8], should be used.

Results and Discussion
Required input data involve only the two annotation files
and two sequence comparison reports (Blast or Smith and
Waterman search results, see above), the inGeno software
then compares the two sequence comparison reports to
each other (reciprocal comprehensive comparisons of
predicted protein versus predicted protein from both
genomes). The user can select the alignment coverage
(upper slider in bottom control panel; [see Additional file
1]) and the percentage of identity (lower slider) that similar proteins from the two genomes compared have to
share to be shown as orthologs by the genome viewer.
Only the best pair (by E-value) meeting these thresholds
is shown by inGeno, a back-tracking procedure eliminates
all paralogs meeting the threshold but having a lesser evalue.
Using this genome viewer, we have investigated a variety
of genome sequences, such as comparisons between species within a genus (Listeria spp. or Escherichia spp.). The
resulting alignment map is plotted and provides clues for
new studies. Comparisons between organisms of larger
phylogenetic distance (e.g., between different genus,
Bacillus spp. and Listeria spp.) produces in general an
alignment lacking conserved collinear relationships.
However, interesting strain-specific islands and their specific functionalities, such as new recruited metabolic reactions or regulatory proteins and transcription factors are
still easily detected by using our software.
The two annotation files supply the genome viewer with
annotation information. To correct and prune wrong
annotation, these files can be re-edited by the user within

We stress that pseudo-genes have to be marked in the
annotation as such if they are to be accurately visualized.
However, the back-tracking procedure from inGeno automatically ensures that pseudo-genes that are less similar to
the other genome than the best available intact gene copy
are not shown as wrong orthologs.
InGeno allows a precise visualization of the alignment of
the proteins and further annotated features between the
two genomes. In related genomes collinear relationships
are highlighted [see Additional file 2]. All routines are sensitive and based on the information extracted from orthologous and strain-specific genes.
The user has a number of options to visualize and identify
similarities and differences between both genomes
[details and tutorial examples are given in Additional file
1]. Orthologous proteins between both genomes are
shown according to user specified thresholds regarding
the percent identity and the length of similarity in both
sequence alignment comparison files (genome 1 to
genome 2 and genome 2 to genome 1) required to be
operationally declared as an orthologue. A test routine
ensures that only the best orthologous pair found to pass
these thresholds is shown. Orthologous proteins in both
genomes are indicated as ellipsoids in the same randomly
chosen color. Strain specific genes stand out and are
marked in red. After establishing the best regression line
to compare both genomes, locus collinear blocks (similar
nucleotide distance to the best regression line and consecutive to each other) identify gene regions which cluster
together but are rearranged in the two genomes. Rainbow

coloring of linkage lines between the two genomes indicates close synteny regions (red) up to major rearrangements between both genomes (blue). The coloring is
either according to the distance to the regression line
(regression mode; for close related genomes) or according
to the absolute gene to gene distance for the two genomes
are compared (absolute mode; for more distantly related
genomes). Sliders position the genomes horizontally and
vertically in the display, radio buttons switch colors, the
number of linkage lines displayed and set user-specified
thresholds. A "legend" option explains the different colors
used in the display.
InGeno allows the user to search for string matches, e.g.
keywords such as "kinase" from the annotation file. The
user can select a region of interest from a genome (including the whole genome) and inGeno sorts the annotation
keywords within the selection area according to their frequency. In this way the user gets an overview for key functions encoded in this area of the genome (e.g. indication
for a cluster of pathogenicity factors). As an important
help in detailed comparisons of the annotation files several keywords can be searched for at the same time and
also be concatenated by logical operators (AND, NOT,
OR). In this way also very complex queries and reports for
strain specific features or for common features can be generated (e.g. a pathogenicity factor but not a kinase).
New information compiled for the user from the genome
viewer by inGeno thus includes gene visualization, sorting
and grouping as well as including importance of different
keywords, string-matching and logical concatenation of
terms used in the annotation text-mining routine, a
graphical display of genome similarities, orthologous
regions and strain-specific differences including strain
specific islands and the creation of function specific annotation reports and lists.
A number of genome analysis and visualization tools are
currently available and several of the specific advantages
and limitations are discussed below.
The latest version of MUMmer [15] easily handles comparisons of large eukaryotic genomes at varying evolutionary distances. Two new graphical viewing tools provide
alternative ways to analyze genome alignments. The new
system is the first version of MUMmer to be released as
open-source software [see Additional file 3].
MuGeN [16] explores multiple genomes and computer
analysis results. It is capable of retrieving annotated
sequences in several formats, stored in local files, or available in databases over the network. From these, it then
generates an interactive display, or an image file, in most
common formats suitable for printing, further editing or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/461

integrating in Web pages. Genome maps may be mixed
with computer analysis results loaded from XML files.
Mauve [7] focuses on multiple alignments of a conserved
genomic sequence with rearrangements. It has been
applied to align nine enterobacterial genomes and to
determine global rearrangement structure and evolution
in three mammalian genomes.
Furthermore, the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT, [8])
allows for an interactive visualization of comparisons
between complete genome sequences and associated
annotations. The comparison data can be generated with
several different programs (e.g. BLASTN, TBLASTX or
Mummer) or orthologue tables generated by reciprocal
FASTA comparison between protein sets. ACT uses
Artemis components to display the sequences and so
inherits powerful searching and analysis tools. It is written
in Java and platform independent.
Finally, in parallel to this work, recently a Java-based
genome viewer appeared ("Combo", [17]) as an integrated part of the Argo Genome Browser which also provides single-genome browsing and editing capabilities
and a dot-plot and genome annotation viewer.
All these tools have their pros and cons and reveal partly
different information from the genome. Some of the differences and advantages of inGeno as a genome viewer are
analyzed and summarized below.
InGeno shows several advantages which some of the existing software also has, e.g. open source, Java code [see
Additional file 3] and platform independence (ACT and
Combo) as well as interactive visualization of genome
data (all above mentioned genome viewers). InGeno is
not intended for simultaneous comparison of multiple
genomes (in contrast to MuGen [16] and Mauve [7]).
However, specific advantages are its modular construction
using Biojava modules (easy further development in the
community is possible) and its rich user interface [see
tutorial and instructions in Additional file 1]. Only limited input is required: Two original sequence annotation
files and two ordinary BLAST reports on the two complete
genomes compared are sufficient.
To get a solid genome alignment the program starts with
a dotplot (as Combo does) but then inGeno identifies
locus collinear blocks (LCB) and includes as an inGenospecific advantage a back-tracking procedure to clean up
the alignment and show only true positives as orthologous proteins. Furthermore, inGeno allows for user specified thresholds [percent identity, length of the alignment,
see Additional file 1] in the visualization of potential
orthologs from both genomes (again including the back-

and Listeria innocua (upper genome) are compared using inGeno. Orthologous genes in both genomes are colored with the
same color. Linkage lines connect locus collinear blocks and indicate the degree of rearrangement between the genomes. The
threshold can be adjusted by a slider in the lower-right corner of the control panel. Red blocks in each genome distinguish
genes which are potential strain-specific and determined by a user-given threshold. In this comparison several strain-specific
genome islands are detected, e.g., in the figure a red island beginning with lmo0200 is being investigated. It is part of the Lipi1
pathogenicity island. Clusters of green lines indicate genome rearrangement events, these can be caused e.g. by transposons. A

In addition, inGeno has an improved visualization compared to the available tools by user-specified coloring [see

cluttering of the view (threshold options, "hide" option)
and allow a range of visualization options as well as detec-

Genome comparison between closely related strains
Genome comparison between closely related strains. The comparison between two closely related E. coli K-12 strains
(W3110 and MG1655) indicates these are only slightly different, except for a highlighted large inversion. The upper genome is
W3110 [24], whereas the lower genome is MG1655 [23-25]. Using inGeno, a couple of strain-specific genes are readily seen,
such as TnaB (annotated as low affinity tryptophan permease; b3709 in figure) and other genes (DcuC: b0621, GatA: b2094,
RcsC: b2218), which lead to different metabolic capabilities, e.g., the utilization of tryptophan as carbon source may be
impaired in W3110.

to interpret for example the highlighted strain-specific
islands which is not available in this form in the above
other viewers. We thus think that the optimized, userfriendly view provided by inGeno is at least a good alternative for a two-genome comparison, notwithstanding
the qualities of the alternative above-mentioned genome
viewers.
In summary, our software allows rapid genome comparisons and gene visualization, gene sorting and grouping.
Furthermore, the user is alerted on the importance of different keywords and string-matching from the text-mining
routine, a graphical display of genome similarities, orthologous regions and strain-specific differences including

highlighted strain specific islands as well as the creation of
function specific annotation reports and annotation listings for complex queries

Strain-specific island – investigation of pathogenicity and metabolism
Strain-specific island – investigation of pathogenicity and metabolism. The top genome is E. coli O157 [25], the lower is
E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 [23-25]. The selected region (ECs1272-1296 and ECs1299-1409) is one of the strain-specific islands
that are potentially related to bacterial pathogenicity. ECs1282 and ECs1283 are identified by inGeno as hemagglutinin/hemolysin-like protein and hemolysin activator-related protein, respectively. An operon-like structure follows these two genes. InGeno reports these encode for a holo acyl-carrier protein, an oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) reductase, a hydroxydecanoyl-(acylcarrier protein) dehydratase, an acyl-carrier protein, an aminomethyl transferase and an oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier protein)-synthase. These enzymes and proteins add to the fatty acid metabolism, additional lipids or lipoproteins may be produced by O157
in contrast to MG1655. Moreover, a series of continuous genes encoding urease components are shown for 0157 (ECs13211327: UreA-G). The detailed information on these proteins is summarized in Table 1.

addition, the program provides two options to view the
associated annotations, simply by moving the mouse
above the gene block or by double-clicking. The latter will
open a window and report information on the gene in
detail. The summary of the strain-specific gene reports
includes here a couple of surface-associated and small
secreted proteins which belong to the internalin family,
i.e., Internalin B (lmo0434), Internalin C (lmo1786), Internalin G (lmo0262), Internalin H (lmo0263), Internalin E
(lmo0264), and several other uncharacterized proteins
containing LPXTG motifs. The investigation reveals a variety of metabolism-related enzymes absent in L. innocua,
e.g., the genes involved in bile acid degradation (lmo0446,
lmo0754, lmo2067), which are potentially the reason that
L. monocytogenes has the capability of surviving in the gut.

Hly (lmo0202), Mpl (lmo0203) till phopholipase C (lmo

with earlier studies [18-21], these characterize L. monocytogenes as a food-borne pathogen and enable it to survive
in multiple extreme conditions in vivo and in vitro [22].
Fig. 2 illustrates inGeno performance in a genome comparison between two closely related strains, i.e., E. coli K12 strains MG1655 (Genbank accession: U00096) and
W3110 (Genbank accession: AP009048) which immediately indicates that these two are extremely similar. Most
genes are highly conserved, but there is a large inversion
for W3110 in the region shown in Figure 2 close to the 3'
prime terminus of replication. In accordance with recent
studies [23], inGeno shows a number of IS element copies. InGeno further detects a couple of strain-specific
genes, such as Dcuc (anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate trans-

Genes involved in the strain-specific island (selected region in Figure 3). This table is an excerpt from an inGeno report. All genes belong
to a selected strain-specific island of the E. coli O157:H7 genome (location: 1337361–1456555). The annotations marked "unknown", "hypothetic
protein" are also included in the inGeno report but not shown for this Table to save space. Similarly, there are a number of "transposases" detected

and TnaB (low affinity tryptophan permease: b3709).
They are present in MG1655 but pseudogenes in W3110
[24]. Each of these displayed variations may influence cell
metabolism, for instance carbon utilization of tryptophan, galactitol or succinate.
Analysis of pathogenicity features is demonstrated in Figure 3. These are inGeno results comparing E. coli strain
O157:H7 (Genbank accession: BA000007) and E. coli
strain MG1655. The E. coli strain O157:H7 is a major
pathogen that causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and
hemolytic uremic syndrome [25]. E. coli K12 strain
MG1655 is chosen as an apathogenic control strain. InG-

present in O157:H7, e.g. an island (location: 1337361–
1456555), is predicted to be involved in bacterial pathogenicity and lipoprotein metabolism. InGeno reports that
it encodes a hemagglutinin/hemolysin-like protein
(ECs1282) and a hemolysin activator-related protein
(ECs1283). Besides these cytotoxins, one next neighboring strain-specific island (location: 1246040–1310725) is
rapidly identified applying inGeno. It contains genes that
are known to produce Shiga-toxin2 (stx2: ECs1205-1206)
[25]. They are involved in pathogenesis and have therapeutic implications as causes for the hemolytic uremic
syndrome [26]. Lipid metabolism genes are identified by
inGeno as well in this strain-specific island, i.e., a holo
acyl-carrier protein (ECs1284), an oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier
protein) reductase (ECs1285), a hydroxydecanoyl-(acyl-

protein (ECs1287), an aminomethyl transferase
(ECs1288) and an oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier protein) synthase

O157:H7 to produce fatty-acid-containing molecules.
Furthermore, several neighboring genes are highlighted.

Conclusion
InGeno is a user-friendly, platform independent application. It identifies orthologs, visualizes and inspects
genome comparison results in good quality. InGeno can
be applied for genome comparisons between various
strains, closer and less related species. Its graphical output
reveals evolutionary changes, bacterial pathogenicity
island and differences in metabolism. Furthermore, annotation search capabilities including logical concatenation
of keywords, automatic comparison reports and lists offer
further information to the user.
