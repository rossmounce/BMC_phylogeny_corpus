Abstract
In 1871, the observation of yellowish nodules in the enlarged spleen of a cow was considered to
be the first reported case of bovine leukemia. The etiological agent of this lymphoproliferative
disease, bovine leukemia virus (BLV), belongs to the deltaretrovirus genus which also includes the
related human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). This review summarizes current knowledge
of this viral system, which is important as a model for leukemogenesis. Recently, the BLV model
has also cast light onto novel prospects for therapies of HTLV induced diseases, for which no
satisfactory treatment exists so far.

1. Background
The occurrence in cattle of a disease called "leukosis" was
first reported by Leisering who described as early as in
1871 the presence of yellowish nodules in the enlarged
spleen of a cow [1]. In fact, spleen disruption consecutive
to tumor formation is one of the most spectacular clinical
manifestations of bovine leukemia. These tumors which
result from a local accumulation of transformed B cells
also infiltrate other tissues such as liver, heart, eye, skin,
lung and lymph nodes (reviewed in [2-5]). Two types of
bovine leukemia can be dissociated on the basis of their
epidemiology: Enzootic Bovine Leukosis (EBL), a disease

caused by a retrovirus called BLV (Bovine Leukemia
Virus), and sporadic bovine leukosis which is not transmissible. Besides the lethal form of BLV-induced leukemia, persistent lymphocytosis (PL) is characterized by a
permanent and relatively stable increase in the number of
B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The PL stage,
which affects approximately one third of infected animals,
is considered to be a benign form of the disease resulting
from the accumulation of untransformed B lymphocytes.
Finally, viral infection is asymptomatic in the majority of
BLV-infected animals; in these settings, fewer than 1 % of

peripheral blood cells in animals are found to be infected
by virus.
BLV is transmitted horizontally through the transfer of
infected cells via direct contact, through milk and possibly
by insect bites [6]. However, iatrogenic procedures like
dehorning, ear tattooing and, any use of infected needles
contribute significantly to viral spread [7-10]. BLV is nowadays highly prevalent in several regions of the world (e.g.
United States) and induces major economical losses in
cattle production and export [11-21]. For instance, the
loss to the dairy industry due to BLV in 2003 was estimated annually at $525 million. In contrast, Denmark
was the first country where the virus has been eradicated
through the systematic destruction of infected herds. It is
remarkable that the identification of infected animals was
performed on basis of peripheral blood cell counts without the availability of specific serological tests (Bendixen's
key) [22]. BLV is now almost completely eradicated from
the European Union after many years of culling infected
animals. Since these costly eradication programs are only
possible in regions where viral prevalence is low, other
strategies have also been considered including isolation of
infected animals, passive immunization with colostrum,
vaccination with viral proteins or attenuated strains, as
well as some other exotic approaches ([5,23-34] and references therein). None of these latter methods currently
achieve the optimal combination of efficiency, economy
and safety.
Domestic cattle are the natural hosts for BLV. The existence of wild reservoirs remains controversial, but convincing evidence indicates that BLV indeed persists in water
buffaloes [35-37]. Experimental transmissions of BLV
have been reported in many species including rabbits [3840], rats [41,42], chickens [43], pigs [44], goats [45] and
sheep [9,46-48]. However, only sheep consistently
develop leukemia whereas rabbits present immune dysfunctions (but no tumors, in a finding different from rabbits inoculated with HTLV [49]). Rare cases of
experimental transformation were reported in goats, rats
and even chicken. Despite successful infection of a series
of cell lines in vitro [50-53], BLV does not persistently
infects cat, dog, monkey or human although viral-specific
seroconversion might occur in these species. Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of raw milk
from BLV-infected cattle does not increase the frequency
of leukemia in man (reviewed in [54-56]). Therefore, it is
unlikely that BLV infects, replicates and induces cancer in
humans, although this cannot be formally excluded [57].
Instead, four BLV related retroviruses have been isolated
in man: Human T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 to 4
(HTLV-1 to -4) [58-60]. Among these, HTLV-1 infects
about 20 million people worldwide, a fraction of whom
(about 2–3 %) progress to develop acute T-cell leukemia

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

(ATL) or HTLV-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic
Paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a neuroinflammatory disease of
the central nervous system.

2. The BLV genome
In addition to the structural gag, pol and env genes
required for the synthesis of the viral particle, the BLV
genome contains a X region located between the envelope
and the 3' long terminal repeat [61-63], as also observed
in other deltaretroviruses [58,60]. Phylogenetic comparisons of different strains, using the pol gene as a reference,
indicate that BLV and primate T-lymphotropic viruses
(PTLV) sequences differ by 42 % [64]; thus BLV forms a
distinct clade amongst retroviruses. Within the BLV subgroup, the sequence divergence was below 6% in pol and
env indicating a high degree of conservation among different geographical strains [24,25,65-67]. Although the reasons are unknown, this genomic stability might result
from a higher fidelity of reverse transcription or from strict
replication constraints.
The genomic RNA
Morphologically, the viral particle with a diameter ranging between 60 and 125 nm, is constituted by a central
electron dense nucleoid surrounded by an outer viral
envelope [68,69] (Figure 1). Infectious virions contain
60–70 S ribonucleic acids resulting from the association
of two 38 S poly-A containing RNA molecules [70].

Transcription of the genomic RNA initiates at the U3/R
boundary of the 5' LTR (long terminal repeat) and terminates at the polyadenylation site (Figure 2). This genomic
RNA interacts with matrix (MA) p15 and nucleocapsid
(NC) p12 proteins and dimerizes through a region surrounding the primer binding site [71,72]. Efficient encapsidation of the RNA requires two regions: a primary signal
which is located in the untranslated leader region between
the primer binding site and near the gag start codon and a
second fragment within the 5' end of the gag gene [73].
Both regions fold into secondary structures that are
required for efficient packaging [74-76]. The primary
encapsidation signal does not overlap with a structure
important for cell-free dimer formation but fits with a
region interacting with MA. Replacement of the BLV RNA
region containing the primary and secondary encapsidation signals with a similar region from HTLV-1 or -2 yields
a recombinant virus competent for replication in cell culture. Heterologous RNAs can be packaged into BLV particles by means of a minimal RNA packaging sequence [77].
Viral RNA packaging requires the involvement of both the
MA and NC domains of Pr145gag-pol, in particular conserved basic residues of MA as well as residues of the zinc
finger domains of NC [78].

Schematic representation of the BLV viral particle
Schematic representation of the BLV viral particle. Two copies of single stranded genomic RNA are packaged in a viral
particle. The CA (p24) proteins form a capsid that contains the viral RNA in interaction with nucleocapsid NC (p12). Two
enzymatic proteins (RT and IN) required, respectively, for reverse transcription and integration of the viral genome are also
packaged into the capsid. The matrix protein MA (p15) interconnects the capsid and the outer envelope that is formed by a
lipid bilayer of cellular origin in which a complex of viral proteins (gp51 SU and gp30 TM) are inserted.

The 3' end of the genomic RNA also contains a highly
structured region (RxRE), which is needed to mediate
RNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (see paragraph on post-transcriptional regulation by Rex). After
transcription and nuclear export, the genomic RNA can
either be directly translated to yield the Pr145gag-pol precursor or incorporated into a budding viral particle.
The long terminal repeat
The genomic RNA is a 9 kb ribonucleic acid molecule
flanked by R regions of the long terminal repeats (Figure
2). In addition to this transcript, a series of other RNAs can
be synthesized in infected cells with two major species of

5.1 kb (the env RNA) and 2.1 kb (tax/rex) and several less
abundant RNAs coding for R3 and G4 [79,80]. All these
transcripts initiate at the boundary between U3 and R (the
CAP site) and terminate with polyadelylation at the end of
R in the 3' LTR. The U3 region contains the canonical promoter "CAT" box (CCAACT at coordinates -97 to -92) and
"TATA" boxes (GATAAAT between -44 and -38). Another
series of sites mainly located in the U3 region of the 5' LTR
regulate viral transcription [81,82].
A key regulatory element of the LTR is a triplicate copy of
a 21 bp sequence called TxRE harboring in the middle of
the sequence an almost perfectly conserved cyclic-AMP

Structure of the BLV provirus: genes, RNA transcripts and viral protein
Structure of the BLV provirus: genes, RNA transcripts and viral protein. The provirus is flanked by two identical
long terminal repeat sequences (LTRs) and contains the open reading frames (orfs) corresponding to gag, prt (protease), pol
and env. Several orfs coding for Tax, Rex, R3 and G4 are present in the X region between env and the 3'LTR. The genomic
RNA transcript initiates and terminates in the 5' and 3' LTRs, respectively. This genomic RNA serves as a template for the
expression of the gag-prt-pol precursors (pr145, pr66 and pr44) that are processed in structure and enzymatic proteins:
matrix (MA) p15, capsid (CA) p24, nucleocapsid (NC) p12, protease (PRT) p14 and, p80 (RT/IN) harboring reverse transcriptase, RNAse H and integrase activities. A large intron corresponding to gag-prt-pol is excised to yield the envelope (env)
RNA. After translation, the pr72 precursor is cleaved in two subunits: the extracellular (SU) gp51 and the transmembrane
(TM) gp30 glycoproteins. To generate the Tax/Rex messenger RNA, a second intron is cleaved. This double-spliced RNA
encodes both the p34 Tax protein using an initiation codon at the end of pol and Rex which shares the same AUG as Env pr72.
Two minor RNAs identified by RT/PCR code for p5 (R3) and p11 (G4). The R3 RNA is similar to the double-spliced Tax/Rex
message but the second intron is shorter and splicing occurs at the 5' end of the R3 frame. The R3 protein shares its aminoterminal end with Rex and pr72. In the G4 message, a very large intron is excised between a particular splice donor site different
from that of the other viral RNAs and an acceptor just 5' to the G4 frame. The G4 protein initiates at a suboptimal CUG
codon located in R of the 5'LTR.

responsive element (CRE) with an overlapping E box
motif. Only two of these TxREs are required for infectivity
and pathogenicity in sheep [83]. In gel retardation assays
with primary B lymphocyte lysates, the TxRE element
interacts with the CREB, ATF-1 and ATF-2 transcription
factors and the amount of protein-DNA complex correlates with the level of viral expression [84,85]. The CREB/
ATF transcription factors regulate LTR-directed transcription when activated by two cellular protein kinases (i.e.
PKA and CaMKIV). The 21 bp enhancer is also a target of
the Tax protein, a viral transcriptional activator which
increases the binding of CREB to DNA [86]. In fact, the
internal CRE-like sequences (AGACGTCA, TGACG GCA,
TGACCTCA), a property which is shared by the related
HTLV-1 LTR [87], are close to but different from the consensus "TGACGTCA". Restoring a perfect CRE sequence
into the 21 bp sequences increases the BLV LTR promoter
activity in reporter assays, but interferes with viral replication in vivo [88]. Indeed, the proviral loads are drastically
reduced in sheep infected with a virus harboring perfect
consensus CRE elements (see section 4, below). Another
regulatory process is exerted by E-box motifs which overlap the CRE elements and repress basal LTR-driven gene
expression [89].
Although the 21 bp enhancer is a major regulator of viral
expression, other U3 elements also modulate LTRdirected transcription. Among them, a NF-κB-related site
located between the proximal and middle 21 bp enhancers, binds in vitro to several members of the kappa B family
of proteins including p49, p50 and p65 and confers further transcriptional activation [90,91]. Another motif,
located just 5' to the proximal 21 bp, is required for
responsiveness of the LTR promoter to glucocorticoids
[92,93]. A PUbox located at coordinates -95/-84 bp specifically interacts with PU.1 and the related Ets transcription
factor Spi-B [94]. Mutations within this element decrease
LTR-driven basal gene expression but does not impair
responsiveness to Tax. An E-box motif (5'-CACGTG-3')
located downstream of the transcription start site binds
the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors USF1 and
USF2 and regulates the LTR promoter [95]. In addition to
these U3 elements, viral expression is regulated also by
sequences in the R region [81]. Finally, an interferon regulatory factor binding site in U5 interacts with IRF-1 and
IRF-2 and stimulates basal expression in the absence of
Tax [96]. Viral transcription thus appears to be regulated
by numerous sites distributed throughout the 5' LTR.
Viral transcription is regulated at a separate level by epigenetic modifications such as acetylation of histone molecules and DNA methylation. Indeed, cultivation of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from BLVinfected animals in the presence of histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitors significantly increases viral expression

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

[97]. A close correlation links the level of histone acetylation and transcriptional activation of the LTR [89]. HDAC
inhibitors synergistically enhance transactivation of the
LTR by Tax in a CRE-dependent manner [98]. Trichostatin
A increases the occupancy of the CRE elements by CREB/
ATF as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.
DNA methylation could be another means for regulating
LTR-transcription. Indeed, in vitro methylation of the LTR
by CpG methyltransferase SssI reduces LTR activity in luciferase reporter assays [99]. However, only minimal modifications of CpG methylation were detected at all stages
examined in BLV-infected cattle and sheep. Further experiments are therefore required to clarify the role of methylation in LTR activity, as has been described in the HTLV
system [100].
Finally, viral expression is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level by a viral protein called Rex which interacts with RNA sequences in the 3'LTR located between the
AATAAA signal and the polyadenylation site [101]. This
region is able to fold into a stable RNA hairpin structure
and brings the two transcription termination signals
together. Rex binding is required for the nuclear to cytoplasmic export of unspliced and singly spliced, but not for
multiply spliced, BLV transcripts.
The gag and protease genes
The gag gene codes for the Pr44gag precursor, a polypeptide
subsequently cleaved into the major non-glycosylated
proteins of the viral particle (p15, p24 and p12) (Figure 2)
[70,102-106]. The matrix (MA) protein p15 (109 aa)
which corresponds to the NH2-terminal end of the gag
precursor is a myristylated and phosphorylated polypeptide. MA proteins bind the genomic viral RNA but also
interact with the lipid bilayer of the viral membrane.
Structurally, MA contains four principal helices that are
joined by short loops [107]. The matrix protein can be further proteolytically processed to generate three fragments:
p10, a seven amino acids product, and p4 [71]. p10,
which is also myristylated, results from the amino-terminal cleavage of MA.

The p12 nucleocapsid (NC) is a proline-rich 69 aa protein
that is tightly bound to the packaged genomic RNA
[71,108]. In the presence of Zn2+, NC interacts with single-stranded nucleic acids with an affinity in the nanomolar range [109].
p24, a neutral and moderately hydrophobic protein, is the
major constituent of the capsid (CA) of BLV virions. The
CA protein appears to be a major target for the host
immune response with high antibody titers found in the
sera of infected animals and two defined regions of p24
being recognized by specific T lymphocytes [110,111].

One of the T-cell epitopes overlaps with a domain highly
conserved among retroviruses, the major homology
region (MHR), which is required for viral infectivity in vivo
[112]. Based on the use of a monoclonal antibody
directed against BLV p24, a common epitope was found to
be shared with HTLV CA [113,114]. Interestingly, this
cross-reactivity between the capsid antigens of BLV and
HTLV-1 suggests an evolutionary relationship between the
two viruses. Of note, an immunological cross-reaction is
also observed between the BLV and the feline leukemia
virus (FeLV) nucleocapsid NC proteins [115].
Different BLV Gag proteins (MA, CA and NC) are derived
from the proteolytic cleavage of the Pr44gag precursor. This
post-translational maturation is carried out by the viral
protease p14 which is encoded by a region located
between the gag and the pol genes. p14 is synthesized from
a gag-protease precursor (pr66gag-prt) via a frameshift suppression of the gag termination codon by a lysine-specific
tRNA [116]. The pr66gag-prt precursor localizes at the surface of polarized cells [117]. The p14 protein, which
assembles into dimers, belongs to the aspartyl proteinase
group and can be inhibited by pepstatin A [118]. Despite
their evolutionary relationship, the BLV and HTLV proteases harbor marked specificities in cleavage site recognition [119].
Overexpression of the Gag polyprotein in mammalian
cells generates virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs production
depends on the PPPY motif located in the MA domain
and on the amino-terminal glycine involved in Gag myristylation. The PPPY sequence functions as a late domain
and plays a role in budding of the viral particle [120,121]
The pol gene
The pol gene is translated via a frameshift mechanism, as a
145-kDa precursor (852 aa) [116]. Pr145 contains all of
the tryptic peptides of the gag-protease precursor and thus
represents an elongation product of pr66gag-prt. The pol
gene encodes a 80 kDa reverse transcriptase (RT), a RNAdependent DNA polymerase which is preferentially active
in the presence of Mg2+ [122,123]. In fact, the enzyme
shows a preference for Mg2+ over Mn2+ in both its DNA
polymerase and RNase H activities [124]. BLV RT is relatively resistant to nucleoside triphosphate analogues
known to be potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase. Bacterially produced BLV RT is enzymatically active as a monomer even
after binding a DNA substrate [125]. Amazingly, sera from
some leukemic cattle contain antibodies that inhibit
reverse transcriptase activity in vitro.

The synthesis of the minus strand DNA by RT begins at the
primer binding site for tRNA pro in the genomic template
RNA located just 2 bp downstream of U5. BLV reverse

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

transcriptase exhibits a higher fidelity than that from
spleen necrosis virus: only 1.2 × 10-5 base mutations (versus 4.8 × 10-6 for SNV) occur per round of replication
[126]. In fact, BLV RT shows a fidelity of misinsertion better than that of HIV-1 RT but a similar degree of mispair
elongation (i.e. the ability to extend these 3' end mispairs)
[124].
After infection of permissive cells, two species of covalently closed circular DNA molecules, harboring one or
two LTR copies, are synthesized after reverse transcription
[127,128]. Unintegrated viral DNA molecules are abundant in asymptomatic and PL cattle but they appear to be
absent during the tumor phase [129]. Insertion of the
double-stranded DNA, also known as the provirus, is
directed by the virally encoded integrase IN [130,131].
During DNA rearrangement, the integrase recognition
sequence includes the 3' end of the U5 LTR region [131].
Once inserted at random sites into the host genome, the
provirus is flanked by direct repeats of cellular DNA [132].
The envelope gene
The sequences coding for the BLV envelope partially overlap in a different frame the 3' end of pol by 51 nucleotides
[62,133,134]. The envelope gene is transcribed as a 5.1 kb
mRNA
coding
for
the
pr72env precursor
[70,80,103,105,106,135]. The BLV and HTLV envelopes
show 36 % of identities in their amino acid sequence. The
BLV pr72env precursor is cleaved into two subunits by subtilisin/kesin-like convertases such as furin [136]. The
resulting products, the extracellular gp51 (SU) and the
transmembrane gp30 (TM) proteins are glycosylated
polypeptides [137-140]. SU and TM associate through
disulfide bonds, conferring a relatively stable complex
[141].

Interestingly, the pr72env precursor polyprotein is not
evenly distributed but concentrates predominantly in
only one daughter cell [117]. This mechanism might
account for the absence of viral antigens in a proportion
of the cell progeny and permit persistence of the virus (see
hypothetical model in section 6, below)
In contrast to TM which is very poorly immunogenic, the
extracellular SU induces massive expression of specific
antibodies in infected animals, a property useful for diagnostics and vaccine development. Some monoclonal antibodies (F, G and H) directed towards conformational
epitopes of SU exhibit neutralizing activities
[137,142,143]. None of the known viral strains are simultaneously lacking F, G and H reactivities, suggesting that
loss of these three epitopes probably means loss of infectivity. In addition, rabbit antisera raised against peptides
39–48, 78–92, 144–157 and 177–192 neutralize VSV/
BLV pseudotypes in vitro, indicating that these epitopes

Retrovirology 2007, 4:18

are also implicated in viral infectivity [144,145]. Interestingly, residues 144 to 157 of SU correspond to the region
in the HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein which is also
involved in neutralization. Cell fusion, i.e. syncytium formation, is inhibited by sera directed towards peptides 64–
73, 98–117 and 177–192. This last sequence (in particular
residues P177 and D178 of SU), which stimulates proliferation of lymphocytes isolated from infected cows, is a Thelper epitope. Finally, CD8-dependent cytotoxic activity
is associated with peptides 121–140, 131–150 [146], or
24–31 [147,148].
In silico modeling indicates that SU glycoprotein oligomerizes as a trimer, in which the putative receptor binding domain (RBD) corresponds to the most efficient
neutralizing epitopes [141,143,149]. It should be mentioned here that this cellular receptor for BLV is still
unknown, in contrast to those of HTLV-1 (i.e. glut-1 and
neuropilin-1) [150,151]. Although a candidate molecule
able to interact with SU has been identified [152], it later
appeared that this protein corresponds to the δ subunit of
adaptor-related protein complex AP3 involved in intracellular vesicle transport [153].
Since cell-free infection by BLV appears to be very inefficient most probably due to virion instability, the main
route of transmission is thought to occur through fusion
between an infected cell harboring envelope proteins at its
surface and a new target lymphocyte [154,155]. The TM
transmembrane protein is a key factor during this process
which uses a fusion peptide that is able to destabilize the
cell membrane through its oblique insertion into the lipid
bilayer [156] triggered by the dynamic structural reorganization of the TM aminoterminal end. Two domains of
SU, peptide 19–27 which adopts an amphiphilic structure
[157] and region 39–103 [136], are also required for efficient cell fusion. Finally, a region of SU localized between
residues 104–123 interacts with zinc and affects viral
fusion as well as infectivity in vivo [158].
In addition to its role in cell fusion, the TM protein is
involved in signal transduction via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM) motifs present in the cytoplasmic tail [159,160]. The critical site of the ITAMs
consists of a YXXL sequence (where X represents a variable
residue). Similar ITAM motifs are also found in Ig alpha
protein of the B cell antigen receptor complex and can be
recognized by SH2 domains of signaling proteins. When
fused to the CD8 molecule, the TM ITAM motifs are able
to transduce signals through the cell membrane after stimulation with an anti-CD8 antibody. These motifs are also
important for incorporation of envelope proteins into the
virion [161] and are required for infectivity in vivo [162].

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

Using a similar approach of chimeric proteins, the TM
cytoplasmic domain has been found to be involved in the
modulation of intracellular envelope trafficking [163].
Replacement of two proximal dileucine motifs with
alanines increases the surface display of CD8-TM chimeric
proteins indicating that these motifs downmodulate cell
surface expression of envelope proteins [164].
Besides ITAMs and dileucine motifs, the TM cytoplasmic
tail has homology with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
inhibition motifs (ITIMs), which are homologous to Bcell receptor (BCR) and inhibitory co-receptor motifs;
however, the functional relevance of these sites remains
unclear [165]. The TM cytoplasmic tail also contains typical proline-rich motifs (PXXP) which correspond to SH3
recognition sites. These motifs are not required for viral
infectivity but are important for the maintenance of high
viral load in vivo [166].
Finally, BLV TM interacts with phosphatase SHP-1 that
associates with FcγRIIB and acts as a critical negative regulator of BCR signaling [167]. This association suggests the
hypothesis that TM may act as a decoy to sequester SHP1, resulting in up-regulation of BCR signaling.

The R3 and G4 open reading frames (orfs) belong to an
intermediate region located between the envelope and the
tax/rex genes. These sequences are transcribed into mRNAs
which are present at very low levels in vivo [79,168]. The
R3 mRNA is bicistronic: the first two exons are common
to the tax/rex messenger but the second intron is shorter
and splicing occurs in the middle of the R3 orf (Figure 2).
The G4 mRNA contains only one intron located between
an unusual splice donor site at position 502 (instead of
305 for the other viral mRNAs) and an acceptor at the 5'
end of G4 (position 7066 according to [62]). In vitro translation of these mRNAs yield proteins of 5.5 kDa and 11.6
kDa for R3 and G4, respectively. Initiation of G4 translation occurs at a suboptimal CUG codon in the R region
whereas R3 shares the AUG of both the Rex protein and
the envelope pr72env precursor. R3 thus contains 17 aminoterminal residues which are also present in Rex and 27
amino acids from the R3 orf [79]. Since these proteins
share the nucleolus-targeting signal and RNA-binding
motifs, R3 could like Rex, be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of viral expression. R3 is located in the
nucleus and in cellular membranes (Figure 3), as previously reported for HTLV-1 p12I. In contrast, G4, like p13II,
is localized both in the nucleus and in mitochondria
[169].

G4 is likely implicated in cell transformation because its
ectopic expression in primary rat embryo fibroblasts
induces their immortalization [170]. Furthermore, G4

interacts with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (FPPS),
a protein involved in the mevalonate/squalene pathway
and in synthesis of FPP, a substrate required for prenylation of Ras [171]. HTLV-1 p13II also specifically interacts
with FPPS and colocalizes with G4 in mitochondria, indicating that both accessory proteins exert related functions.
R3 and G4 are dispensable for infectivity in vivo but the
integrity of these genes is essential to allow efficient propagation inside the host [83,170,172]. Furthermore,
recombinant viruses deleted in R3 and G4 are very poorly
pathogenic in sheep with a single exception out of 20
infected animals having been observed after more than 7
years of latency (Florins et al, manuscript in preparation).
Rex
Almost 3 decades ago, a 18 kDa protein was identified by
in vitro translation of RNA isolated from virions [70]. This
18 kDa product was antigenically unrelated to the viral
structural proteins and originated from the 3' end of the
provirus. Later, it was discovered that this viral protein
resulted from the translation of the rex orf [173,174]. The
rex sequences are well conserved amongst various BLV isolates with less than 5% variation [175].

The Rex protein has a punctate nuclear localization, associates with nuclear pores and harbors a nuclear export signal (Figure 3) [24,25,176]. Rex contains a central leucinerich activation domain and amino-terminal arginine-rich
motifs required for RNA-binding and nuclear localization.
Rex is required for the accumulation of genomic and singly-spliced env RNAs [101]. This trans-acting regulation of
viral mRNA processing requires a 250-nucleotide region
located between the AATAAA signal and the polyadenylation site in the 3'LTR. The Rex proteins of HTLV-1 and BLV
are interchangeable for purposes of post-transcriptional
regulation [177].
The messenger RNA coding for BLV Rex results from the
excision of two introns: one is located between the major
splice site at nucleotide 305 (according to [62]) and an
acceptor at the end of the pol gene (position 4649), and
the other spans residues 4871 to 7247. This complex double-splicing mechanism yields a 2.1 kb molecule coding
not only for Rex, but also for the Tax protein [80,178]. In
vitro, the tax/rex message which is not itself regulated by
Rex [101], is present in the cytoplasm during an early
phase preceding the accumulation of the other mRNA
coding for the structural proteins [179]. Finally, the
expression of the tax/rex mRNA but not other viral RNAs,
is maintained in vivo at late phases of leukemia or lymphosarcoma [180].

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

The Tax transactivator
The other protein encoded by the 2.1 kb multiply-spliced
mRNA is Tax, a transcriptional activator of viral expression. Initiation of tax translation occurs at a methionine
residue located just upstream of the pol stop codon
[80,181]. The Tax orf is the largest of the X region located
between the env gene and the 3' LTR (Figure 2). The Tax
protein is a target of the host immune response with T and
B epitopes corresponding to regions 110–130/131–150
and 261–280, respectively [182].

The importance of tax has been suggested by the absence
of deletions affecting this orf during the process of leukemogenesis [183,184]. However, some proviruses harboring deletions in the central portion of the genome do not
contain the second exon required for initiation of Tax.
These deletants are thus unable to express Tax, although
all of them could at least in theory, express G4. It is still
possible that a Tax protein is synthesized via other splicing
processes or is provided in trans by other infected cells
[185]. Besides these speculations, it is clear that the integrity of the tax gene is essential for viral infectivity in vivo
[83,186].
The Tax protein is rich in proline (13 %) and leucine (16
%) residues and has a relatively short half life (5 to 6
hours) [178]. It is mainly localized in the nucleus,
although significant amounts are also present in the
cytosol [187,188] (Figure 3). Tax is post-translationally
modified by phosphorylation of two serine residues (106
and 293) and exhibits at least three forms with measured
isoelectric points of 6.05, 6.25 and 6.45 [188,188,189].
Although its calculated molecular weight is 34,328, Tax
migrates as a 34–38 kDa product, probably due to its
phosphorylation.
The first identified function of Tax is activation of viral
transcription [190,191]. This mechanism of transactivation by Tax requires interaction with cellular transcription
factors, like CREB, which bind to the 21 bp enhancer elements in the 5'LTR. A very narrow range of variations is
compatible with full transactivation activity, suggesting
that the present molecular structure of Tax results from
heavy evolutionary constraints [192,193,175]. In addition to the main phosphorylation sites at serines 106 and
293, Tax is structurally characterized by the presence of an
aminoterminal zinc finger and by a leucine-rich activation
domain located between residues 157 and 197 [188,194].
Deletion of the activation domain or substitutions of
amino acids involved in the zinc finger completely abolish Tax's transactivation activity. The region between
amino acids 245 and 265 of the Tax protein reduces LTRdirected transactivation [195]. A Tax mutant within this
region, which also harbors increased c-fos transactivation
activity [196], does not propagate virus at higher rates in

Page 9 of 32

Retrovirology 2007, 4:18

vivo [197]. PBMCs infected with the Tax mutant virus are
less prone to undergo intrinsic apoptosis ex vivo, a process
which involves the Bcl-xl protein [198].
Besides its function as a transcriptional activator, Tax
induces immortalization of primary rat embryo fibroblasts (REF) [170,194,199]. In addition, Tax cooperates
with the Ha-ras oncogene to induce full transformation of
cells that form tumors when injected into nude mice, a
property shared with G4 (see above). These activities
which are also seen with the Myc oncogene, underline the
immortalizing potential of Tax. Tax is thus not strictly an
oncogene because it does not have a cellular counterpart
but behaves as such in a way similar to the well defined
Myc protein. The oncogenic potential of Tax can be dissociated from its transcriptional activation potential by specific mutations. Alterations of the zinc finger yield
transactivation-deficient but transformation-competent
mutants [194]. In contrast, the main phosphorylation
sites are dispensable for transactivation but are required
for oncogenicity in the REF system (see section 4)
[200,201].
The mechanisms by which Tax induces transformation are
still largely unknown. Expression of Tax in primary ovine
B lymphocytes, which are dependent on CD154 and interleukin-4, impacts cell proliferation and survival leading to
cytokine independent growth [202]. This immortalization process correlates with increased Bcl-2 protein levels,
nuclear accumulation of NFκB and a series of intracellular
pathways which remain to be characterized [203]. Tax
also inhibits base-excision DNA repair of oxidative damage, potentially increasing the accumulation of ambient
mutations in cellular DNA [204].
To further understand its mechanisms of action, Tax-associated cellular interacting proteins have been identified
using a two-hybrid approach. For example, Tax directly
binds to tristetraprolin (TTP), a post-transcriptional modulator of TNFα expression [187]. Tax promotes nuclear
accumulation of TTP and restores TNFα expression by
inhibiting TTP. Interestingly, this process is shared by the
HTLV-1 Tax protein, supporting a key role of this process
during cell transformation. Another Tax-interacting protein is MSX2, a general repressor of gene expression,
including LTR-dependent transcription [205]. MSX2
repression can be counteracted by overexpression of the
CREB2 and RAP74 transcription factors. A third Tax-binding protein is the G protein β subunit [206]. In conditional Tax-1-expressing transformed T-lymphocytes, Tax
expression correlates with activation of the SDF-1/CXCR4
pathway.

3. BLV infects B lymphocytes
Although it has been reported that BLV could persist in
other cell types [207-214], it seems clear that the major
target of the virus is a B lymphocyte which expresses surface immunoglobulin M [215-219]. In addition to B lymphocytes, BLV also persists in cells of the monocyte/
macrophage lineage. Immunoglobulin γ heavy chains are
frequently found on lymphoma cells from cattle, consistently with a mature B cell phenotype [219,220]. Sequencing of VDJ rearrangements in IgM-secreting B lymphocytes
from a BLV-infected cow indicates that IgM antibodies are
functional, exhibit polyspecific reactivity and contain
exceptionally long CDR3H [221]. Such long HCDR3s,
which are also often found in poor outcome chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (B-CLL), characterize antibodies directed towards negatively charged autoantigens (e.g.,
DNA) [222].
In addition to these markers pertaining to B lymphocytes,
infected cells frequently co-express the CD5 molecule. B
cell lymphocytosis essentially results from an increased
proliferation of circulating CD5+ B lymphocytes associated with a lower but significant increase of the CD5- B
cell population [223-226]. Although the provirus has
been detected in both CD5+ and CD5- B lymphocytes
from infected animals, lymphosarcoma cells appear to
exhibit mainly, but not exclusively, the CD5+ B phenotype [220]. CD5 physically associates with the BCR in B
lymphocytes from normal but not from PL cattle [227].
BCR crosslinking decreases apoptosis of CD5+ B cells
from uninfected animals but does not impact on those of
PL cattle in which CD5 is already dissociated from the
BCR. In contrast to CD5-negative B cells, BCR in B cells of
PL cattle resists movement into lipid rafts upon stimulation and is only weakly internalized [228]. Disruption of
CD5-BCR interactions and subsequent decreased apoptosis in antigenically stimulated B cells may thus be a mechanism of BLV-induced PL.
In contrast, the CD5 molecule is often not expressed on
tumor cells from BLV-infected sheep [229,230]. Favored
growth of CD5 positive cells might result from a difference in susceptibility to apoptosis [231]. Another marker,
the CD11b integrin molecule better defines the leukemic
cell populations, although the virus infects both CD11b+
and CD11b- cells. These two populations also exhibit
marked differences in cell kinetics (see section 6). In addition, the BLV-target cells express the IL-2 receptor (CD25)
and the major histocompatibility class II complex or a
related molecule previously called the tumor associated
antigen (TAA) [219,220,232-234]. This antigen is probably the most frequently expressed protein at the surface of
BLV target cells. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing this
molecule inhibit the growth of BLV-infected lymphoid
cells and induce tumor regression. Molecular cloning of

Retrovirology 2007, 4:18

cDNAs corresponding to bovine MHC II (BoLA) indicated
that the TAA is closely related, but not identical to BoLADR. Of note, B lymphocytes from PL cows express
increased spontaneous expression of the MHC class II
molecule [235].
To summarize, it appears that the target cell for BLV is
MHCII+ surface IgM+, CD5+ and CD11b+ with some
fluctuations for the three latter markers at late stages of the
disease. In contrast, HTLV-1 clearly infects other cell types
CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes [236,237], underscoring
a major difference between the two viral systems.

4. Viral genetic determinants required for
infection and pathogenesis
Although sheep are not natural hosts for BLV, studying
infection and pathogenesis in this model might be
informative for understanding pathogenesis pertaining to
other deltaretroviruses. To circumvent the problem of
genomic RNA instability, infectious proviruses were
cloned and injected into sheep or calves [30,83,238,239].
Hence, infection of sheep with proviral clone 344 leads to
tumor or leukemia after a mean latency period of 33
months [170]. Since the BLV provirus can be re-amplified
from the tumor cells, the three conditions required to fulfill Koch's postulate are demonstrated (i.e. the cloning of
the virus, the analysis of its pathogenicity, and its re-isolation from the lesions), clearly establishing viral causality
in leukemia/lymphoma.
Among other isolates, clone 395 is deficient for infectivity
in vivo, due to the presence of a E-to-K mutation at codon
303 of the Tax protein [83,184,186]. In cell culture, transfection of provirus 395 yields reduced levels of Tax activity
(~ 10 % of wild-type) although the amount of major capsid protein p24 expressed inside the cells and in the supernatant remains unaffected. Adequate levels of
transactivation are required for infectivity in vivo supporting the notion that tax is an essential gene.
The injection of sheep with provirus 344 fulfills all the
requirements of a model system linking fields as diverse as
molecular biology, virology and pathogenesis. Therefore,
clone 344 has been used to construct a series of derivative
proviruses harboring mutations or deletions in different
parts of the genome. As expected, large deletions within
the structural or enzymatic gag, pol or env genes destroy

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

infectivity in vivo [83,112]. Interestingly, co-infection of
sheep with two defective recombinants can generate a replication-competent and pathogenic virus by homologous
recombination in vivo. As mentioned earlier (see section
2), several residues/regions in the viral genome are essential for infection: E303 of Tax, Y197 of the TM ITAM
motifs and the MHR domain of CA [112,162]. Considering that genetic information is highly condensed in the
proviral genome, it is surprising to identify a large domain
within the provirus that is dispensable for infectivity in
vivo. Indeed, the deletion of the region which expands
from the end of the env gene to the splice acceptor site of
the tax/rex mRNA does not impair infectivity ([83] and
unpublished results). Since these sequences correspond
respectively to the third and second exons of the R3 and
G4 mRNAs, it appears that these genes are not essential for
infectivity in vivo. Similar conclusions were drawn from
HTLV mutant proviruses deleted in the ORFs encoding the
p12I and p13II/p30II orthologs of R3 and G4 [240-242].
Importantly, the R3/G4 deletion greatly interferes with
the efficiency of BLV propagation and restricts pathogenesis [170,172]. Very recently, however, one out of 20 sheep
infected with a R3/G4 mutant developed a lymphoma
after 7.5 years of latency, demonstrating that the deleted
sequences are not strictly required for pathogenesis (Florins et al, in preparation). It does remain that the integrity
of the R3/G4 genes significantly contributes to disease frequency and latency (see Table 1).
The BLV 344/sheep system has been instrumental for
unraveling determinants of the viral replication cycle.
Binding of the viral envelope complex to the target cell
membrane leads to a process of fusion, allowing subsequent viral entry. The fusion mechanism can be reproduced in vitro by co-cultivation of fibroblasts or
lymphocytes expressing Env proteins at their surface and
target cells like CC81, leading to polykaryocytosis [156].
The fusion process is mediated by the oblique insertion of
the TM aminoterminal peptide into the lipid bilayer of the
cell membrane. Forcing the peptide to adopt a parallel orientation by mutation abrogates fusion in cell culture and
infectivity in vivo [83]. In contrast, replacement of the peptide by the corresponding residues derived from SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) yields a fully fusioncompetent envelope. However, a virus carrying this mutation lacks infectivity, suggesting that additional constraints are operative in vivo. What is even more surprising

Table 1: Summary of unexpected conclusions deduced from the BLV/sheep model

Fusion-deficient viruses can propagate at wild type levels
A transformation-deficient tax mutant is leukemogenic in sheep
A large region between the env and R3 genes is dispensable for infectivity and viral spread
Deletion of R3/G4 affects but does not abrogate pathogenicity
Increasing LTR promoter activity decreases viral spread

is that TM mutants (i.e. A60V and A64S) that are deficient
for cell fusion in vitro nevertheless support viral infectivity
in vivo [154]. And, very unexpectedly, these mutant viruses
can propagate at wild-type levels and are pathogenic in
sheep (see Table 1). Since the A60V and A64S mutants are
also impaired for SU/TM interaction, it seems that integrity of the envelope complex is not strictly required in vivo.
If the cell fusion processes in vitro and in vivo are indeed
impaired equally by these mutations, then the findings
offer the unexpected suggestion that BLV replicates by
mitotic division of the infected cell rather than by de novo
envelope-cell receptor mediated infectious cycle.
The tax gene is assumed to be a major factor required for
viral replication and pathogenesis. Tax activates LTRdirected transcription and immortalizes primary cells in
culture [190,191,199,202,243]. The two activities of Tax
can be dissociated; for example, mutations in the zinc finger abrogate transactivation without altering immortalization [194]. Conversely, substitution of the two major
phosphorylation sites in Tax does not alter its transcriptional activity but destroys its oncogenicity in REF cells
[200]. As illustrated by the defect seen with provirus 395,
Tax's transactivation activity is required for viral infectivity
in vivo. In contrast, a provirus (Tax106+293) harboring
mutated phosphorylation sites remains infectious and
propagates at wild-type levels in sheep. In addition, the
Tax106+293 mutant is pathogenic despite a loss in its
ability to transform primary cells in vitro [201] (see Table
1). These findings suggest that a deficiency in Tax oncogenic potential as revealed by the REF immortalization
does not correlate with leukemogenesis in vivo.
As previously mentioned, the BLV transcriptional promoter located in the 5' LTR contains suboptimal binding
sequences for the CREB transcription factor. Remarkably,
the cyclic-AMP responsive site (CRE) consensus
"TGACGTCA" is never strictly conserved in any viral 21 bp
element which invariably contains an imperfect substitution (for example, AGACGTCA, TGACGGCA, TGACCTCA). Restoring a perfect CRE sequence into the
promoter increases LTR (long terminal repeat) promoter
activity, as expected [88]. However, the proviral loads are
drastically reduced in sheep infected with a virus harboring this type of change (see Table 1). It is tempting to speculate that BLV may have evolved a self-attenuating process
(perhaps for purposes of escaping immunosurveillence)
which encourages the virus to maintain a less active promoter through suboptimal use of the CRE-dependent
pathway. If this speculation is correct, then one thought is
that transcriptional repression of viral expression may be
a key factor which regulates viral persistence and spread.
As mentioned in section 2, the activity of the viral LTR is
also thought to be regulated by E-box motifs which overlap the CRE sites [88,89]. However, an E-box mutant virus

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

is infectious, replicates to wild-type levels and is pathogenic in sheep. These observations question the clear significance of the E-box motif in vivo [88] (and unpublished
results).
Collectively the experimental findings from BLV research
emphasize the dichotomy between subgenomic in vitro
results and counterpart findings achieved using replicating viruses in vivo; they reinforce the critical need to perform pathogenesis studies in vivo.

5. Mecanisms of leukemogenesis
BLV is an exogenous virus which integrates randomly in the
cellular genome
Viral infection is followed by a polyclonal expansion of a
large and diverse population of lymphocytes harboring
one to five integrated proviruses [122,123,244-246]. At
later stages, a few cell clones predominate and the population evolves towards monoclonality in assays of viral
integration. Proviral integration thus appears to be mandatory for the viral life cycle, although each integration
event may not be perfect and on occasions some
sequences are deleted [183,184,247]. In fact, these relatively frequent deletions typically affect the central structural genes and yield dead-end viruses that are unable to
replicate in vivo [83,184]. The emergence of these
deletants might be a fortuitous consequence of viral replication following mistakes during reverse transcription,
recombination or integration. However, the frequency at
which these deletions occur in tumor samples suggests
that they provide a selective advantage to the infected cell.
In rare cases, it is even possible that a deleted provirus is
the sole integrant within the host cell genome. However,
it appears that at least one copy of the full-length BLV proviral genome is maintained in each animal throughout
the course of the disease [185]. Whether these replicationcompetent viruses complement the deletants, as observed
for spleen focus-forming virus, is unknown. The defect
within the proviruses is a consequence either of large deletions or of point mutations, but is not due to insertion of
cellular sequences [248,249]. Finally, BLV provirus integrates at random sites and, therefore, does not transform
cells by insertional mutagenesis, as observed in ALVinduced tumors (Avian Leukosis Virus) [250,251].
Low levels of viral expression are detected in vivo
An apparent paradox of BLV infection is that leukemogenesis proceeds in the absence of viral expression. In fact,
lack of expression pertains to the large majority of detectable virus-infected cells [252,253]. The first evidence is
that BLV virions or viral proteins cannot be directly
detected in the peripheral blood by any currently available technique (ELISA, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation or western blotting). Second, viral transcripts from
peripheral blood lymphocytes or tumors can only be

Page 12 of 32

Retrovirology 2007, 4:18

amplified by means of very sensitive RT-PCR techniques
[79,180,254,255]. Third, using flow cytometry cell sorting
and subsequent RT-PCR, only about one B lymphocyte
out of 10,000 is found to express tax/rex mRNA during
persistent lymphocytosis. Fourth, only rare cells in the
peripheral blood (1 in 50,000) contain enough BLV transcripts to be readily identified by in situ hybridization
[256,257]. A potential repression mechanism of viral
expression involves a plasma factor related to fibronectin
[258-260] and inhibited by a platelet lysate [261]. However, expression of BLV in samples of whole blood from
BLV-infected cattle is activated immediately upon incubation at 37°C in the absence of any exogenous factors
except for anticoagulants or the removal of blood cells
from plasma [262].
As early as in 1969, Miller [69] showed that cultivation of
infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells leads to
expression of viral antigens. This process has been extensively characterized to identify the involved pathways: it
appears that concanavalin A [263,264], phytohemagglutinin (PHA) [256,265], lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
[179,266], phorbol esters (PMA) and calcium ionophores
[24,267,268] activate viral protein synthesis. The presence
of T cells increases [264,269,270], but is not strictly
required for viral expression by the infected B lymphocytes. As revealed by a series of relatively specific
inhibitors, the metabolic pathways involved in viral
expression include protein kinase C, calmodulin and
intracellular calcium mobilisation. More physiological
stimuli of viral expression include cross-linking of membrane IgM or interactions with CD40 ligand, mimicking
BCR and T cell activation, respectively [243,256,268].
Finally, viral transcription is activated by components of
fetal bovine serum.
Altogether, these data indicate that viral expression can be
augmented by molecules that mimic B cell activation by
immune cells. As presented in this paragraph, the traditional and dogmatic model postulates that cells are
latently infected and express viral proteins only upon
transient ex vivo cell culture. This concept faces a series of
objections and we propose another model in section 6.
Altered gene expression of cytokines
Interleukins: IL2, IL6, IL10 and IL12
A first described cytokine network interconnects interleukin-10 (IL-10), viral expression and B-cell proliferation
in BLV-infected cattle. IL-10 mRNA is over expressed in
cows with persistent lymphocytosis [271,272]. In cell culture of PBMCs, IL-10 inhibits expression of COX-2 as well
as antigen-specific cell proliferation. IL-10 suppresses synthesis of a macrophage-derived COX-2 product, prostaglandin E2, that stimulates virus expression [273,274].

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

Although reported data on IL2 expression during the
course of BLV-infection are discordant, it is agreed that
elevated levels of this cytokine are synthesized in
mitogen-stimulated PBMCs from asymptomatic and PL
cattle [225,264,275-278]. Furthermore, in isolated B lymphocytes from PL cows, IL-2 increases viral CA protein
synthesis, IL-2 receptor expression, and triggers proliferation.
T cells isolated from lymph nodes and peripheral blood of
BLV-infected cattle express IL-2 mRNAs [279]. However,
the amounts of IL-2 mRNAs are significantly reduced in
CD4+ T cells from PL cows as compared to controls; on
the other hand, no significant differences in the frequencies of CD4+ T cells expressing these cytokine mRNAs are
observed.
Although IL-6 mRNAs are barely detectable in fresh B cells
from PL cows, transcripts encoding this cytokine are
strongly and rapidly upregulated after cell culture [280].
Furthermore, levels of IL-6 are significantly higher in the
sera of BLV infected cows with PL as well as in PBMC cultures following in vitro exposure to BLV antigens [281].
When exogenous IL-6 is added to infected cells in vitro,
viral expression is strongly suppressed, suggesting that IL6 plays a contributory role to viral latency.
Finally, elevated levels of IL-12 in asymptomatic and PL
cattle are expressed by mitogen-stimulated PBMC [282].
However, IL-12 p40 mRNA expression is significantly
decreased in PL cattle compared to aleukemic animals
[283].
TNFα
The role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in BLV
replication has clearly been demonstrated in TNF-/- knockout mice [284]. In sheep inoculated with BLV, expression
of TNFα receptor type 1 mRNA (TNF-R1) is down-regulated while TNF-R2 mRNA remains constant. BLVinfected PBMCs express membrane-bound TNFα and proliferate in response to TNFα [285,286]. Furthermore,
TNFα expression is higher in sheep that resist BLV infection after vaccination [287].

In BLV-infected cattle, the mean mRNA expression level
for TNF-α is higher in the spontaneously proliferating and
antigen-induced PBMC population [271,272,281,288].
When exogenous TNF-α is added to BLV infected cells in
vitro, viral expression is strongly suppressed. Cells isolated
from PL cattle exhibit increased proliferative responses in
the presence of recombinant bovine TNF-α [289] and
express significantly higher TNF-R2 mRNA levels
although no difference is found in TNF-R1 mRNA levels.
Most cells expressing TNF-R2 are CD5+ or sIgM+ cells and
are less prone to TNFα-induced apoptosis [285].

IFN-γ
As expected by its antiviral activity, recombinant bovine
IFN-γ suppresses replication of ovine BLV-infected cells in
vitro [290]. In addition, sheep, which show augmented
mRNA expression of IFNγ, have lower proviral loads
[291]. When BLV-infected cattle are inoculated intraperitoneally with recombinant bovine IFN-γ, γδ T cells
increase soon after a period of transient fever whereas the
number of BLV-infected B lymphocytes remains low during one week [292]. This experiment thus directly illustrates the potency of IFNγ to inhibit viral spread.

IFNγ mRNA is detected in the T-cell population isolated
from lymph nodes of BLV-infected cattle [279,282]. In
PBMCs, IFN-γ mRNA expression increases 4 weeks after
infection [293] but the antiviral activity remains intriguingly unaffected [294]. In aleukemic cattle, IFNγ mRNA
expression is significantly increased compared to those in
cattle with persistent lymphocytosis [283]. Furthermore,
IFN-γ is elevated in pokeweed mitogen-stimulated cells
from asymptomatic cattle but not from PL animals [282].
Recently, another form of interferon, IFN-τ, was reported
as a potential anti-viral protein in cattle [295].
Host cell genetics
BLV-induced leukemogenesis is preceded by a long lasting
chronic disease characterized by accumulation of genetic
modifications such as mutation of p53 within the host
genome [296-299]. Approximately half of the solid
tumors induced by BLV in cattle contain a mutated p53
gene while very few mutations are found in preneoplastic
B cells. These mutations interfere with essential p53 functions required for transactivation and suppression of cell
growth [299]. In addition, the ratio of Bcl2 to Bax which
is believed to predetermine the susceptibility to a given
apoptotic stimulus is increased at advanced stages of disease in cattle [300]. In contrast, the p53 gene is not
mutated at any stage of disease in sheep [301].

Tumors cells accumulate clonal abnormalities and are
hyperdiploid [302]. The most common aberrations are
the acquisition of additional small chromosomes, trisomy, Robertsonian translocations and isochromosome
rearrangements. Whether these abnormalities are
required to achieve full malignancy or are just bystanders
of transformation is currently unknown. However, it is
likely that these chromosomal alterations acquired during
a long multistep process provide a selective growth advantage to the tumor cells.
The genetic profile of the host genome also predisposes to
tumor development [303]. A major factor involved in
clinical progression of BLV-infected animals is mediated
by the bovine major histocompatibility complex (BoLA)

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

[304,305]. Genetic resistance and susceptibility to persistent lymphocytosis (PL), have been mapped to structural
motifs in bovine MHC DRB3 (class II) alleles [306]. Haplotype DQA*12-DQB*12-DRB2*3A-DRB3.2*8 is associated with a risk factor for subclinical progression to PL in
BLV-infected animals, whereas DQA*3A-DQB*3ADRB2*2A-DRB3.2*11 correlates with resistance [307].
Animals with the PL-resistance associated DRB3.2*11
allele have significantly fewer BLV-infected B cells than do
age- and seroconversion-matched cows with DRB3 alleles
associated with susceptibility to PL [308]. Furthermore,
another polymorphism in the promoter region of TNF-α
gene (-824G allele) may contribute to the progression of
lymphoma in BLV-infection [309]
In sheep, genetic predisposition to development of leukemia correlates with a particular MHC-II DRB1 allele. The
Arg-Lys (RK) and the Ser-Arg (SR) at positions 70/71 of
the OLA-DRβ1 domain are associated with resistance and
susceptibility, respectively, to development of lymphoma
[310]. Higher levels of IFN-γ are found in animals with
RK/RK genotype [311] most probably modulating disease
progression.
The susceptibility to the polyclonal expansion of BLVinfected B lymphocytes is thus associated with specific
alleles of the major histocompatibility complex system.
Host humoral and cytotoxic immune responses
Natural or iatrogenic transmission of BLV primarily
involves the transfer of infected cells via blood or milk
[8,308]. The processes occurring after this primary infection still remain obscure. One of the earliest indications of
infection is the onset of a humoral anti-viral response at
about 1–8 weeks post-inoculation [308,312,313]. Antibodies recognizing epitopes from structural (envelope
gp51 and capsid p24) and regulatory proteins (Tax and
Rex) are synthesized at high titers. Some of these antibodies are directly lytic for BLV-producing cells [314]. The
level of antibody-mediated cytolytic activity increases
with progression of the disease towards the acute phase
[315].

Almost concomitant with the early seroconversion period,
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) specific for Tax and Envelope epitopes appear in the peripheral blood [147,285].
Compared to humans, a peculiarity of cattle is that γδ Tlymphocytes are major players in this cytotoxic response
[316]. BLV infection also triggers both a virus-dependent
and a virus-independent CD4 helper T cell response
[144,317,318].
It thus appears that a very active humoral and cytotoxic
immune response is initiated soon after BLV infection
(reviewed in [285,319]). Importantly, these anti-viral

Page 14 of 32

Retrovirology 2007, 4:18

activities amplify and persist throughout the animal's life
indicating that the immune system is permanently stimulated by BLV antigens. The persistence of this immune
response is relatively unexpected for a chronic infection,
at least if associated with a latent virus. However, cytotoxic
and helper associated functions weaken in BLV-infected
animals, as the disease progresses, as supported by a lower
spontaneous recovery from Trichophyton verrucosum
[285,320]

6. Cell dynamics of viral infection
Is BLV silent?
Although BLV expression is detected in a minority of viable cells, a strong cytotoxic and humoral immune
response is induced within the infected host. Experimental evidence (i.e. in situ hybridization, flow cytometry, RTPCR) favors a model postulating that the virus is latent in
the very large majority of detectable cells (i.e. those that
escape from immune response and can be isolated and
observed ex vivo). The latency of BLV in vivo and its reactivation upon ex vivo culture thus became a standing
dogma. There are however a series of caveats in this
model. Indeed, the maintenance of a vigorous anti-viral
immune response in infected animals indicates that some
degree of virus expression must occur in vivo. Furthermore, BLV transcription can even be detected in samples
of whole blood upon incubation at 37°C without addition of any exogenous factor except anticoagulants [262].
Then, why would this process not be ongoing continuously in infected cells in vivo? If anticoagulants do not activate viral expression, it is unlikely, although not
impossible, that the simple removal of blood would be
sufficient to induce BLV transcription. Alternatively, we
favor the idea that viral expression occurs permanently in
a subpopulation of infected cells, which are very efficiently killed by the immune system. The cytotoxic and
humoral responses are however unable to destroy cells in
which viral transcription is completely silenced.
How does the virus replicate?
Viral replication occurs via the replicative cycle after
expression of virions able to infect novel target cells. Alternatively, the integrated proviruses can expand by mitosis
of the host cell by a process referred to as clonal expansion
[321]. Semiquantitative inverse PCR amplification of the
cellular sequences flanking the BLV provirus has revealed
that the viral load results almost exclusively from clonal
expansion of infected cells [246]. Importantly, the premalignant cellular clones from which the tumor originates
can be detected as early as a few weeks after experimental
infection. In fact, the latency period preceding onset of
leukemia/lymphoma is characterized by a fluctuation in
the abundance of different cellular clones harboring an
integrated provirus. Malignancy of a given clone correlates
with the accumulation of somatic mutations revealing a

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

decrease in the genetic stability of the expanding infected
cell. During the asymptomatic phase, most of the proviral
load is sustained by mitosis of the infected cell. Efficient
virus replication and infection of new target cells via virions and/or virological synapses seem to occur mostly, if
not almost exclusively, during a very short period following viral inoculation (so-called primary infection). However, it is still possible that the replicative cycle is ongoing
continuously but the net outcome of this process does not
contribute significantly to the observed viral load, because
of an efficient immune response.
Two key and related questions remain to be solved: why is
the abundance of the infected cell clones fluctuating? And
what is the driving force of the clonal expansion process?
Based on the extensively described oncogenic properties
of Tax, our tenet is that this virally encoded protein triggers cell proliferation.
Is BLV inhibiting apoptosis?
When peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLVinfected sheep are transiently maintained in culture for a
few hours, the levels of B cell apoptosis are reduced compared to normal controls [322,323]. The most straightforward interpretation is that BLV interferes with
spontaneous apoptosis of B lymphocytes. This process
requires at least in part a caspase 8-dependent pathway
regardless of viral infection [324]. Pharmaceutical depletion of reduced glutathione (namely, gamma-glutamyl-Lcysteinyl-glycine [GSH]) by using ethacrynic acid or 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid specifically counters the inhibition of spontaneous apoptosis conferred indirectly by
protective BLV-conditioned media; conversely, exogenously provided membrane-permeable GSH-monoethyl
ester restores cell viability in B lymphocytes of BLVinfected sheep. Most importantly, intracellular GSH levels
correlate with virus-associated protection against apoptosis but not with general inhibition of cell death induced
by polyclonal activators, such as phorbol esters and ionomycin. Similar evaluations of spontaneous apoptosis in
cattle yielded a very broad range of spontaneous apoptosis mainly depending on the experimental conditions
[97,325,326].

A major problem with ex vivo experiments is that it is
never possible to perfectly replicate the situation prevailing in vivo. Even under the culture conditions that most
closely mimic the natural medium (such as culture of
heparin-containing blood), interpretations of data will
always face experimental objections. For instance, when
lymphocytes are isolated from a BLV-infected sheep and
maintained for a few hours in culture, almost all cells
expressing the major viral capsid protein p24gag fail to
undergo apoptosis (Figure 4). This observation fits well
with previous reports showing that B-lymphocytes from

Page 15 of 32

Retrovirology 2007, 4:18

infected sheep are less prone to apoptosis compared to
control cells [322,323]. However, an alternative interpretation is that cells that spontaneously express CA antigen
are cleared in vivo and therefore cannot be detected ex vivo.
Cell kinetics in vivo
Several markers of proliferation (PCNA, KI67 and myc) are
overexpressed in B lymphocytes from tumors and PBMCs
isolated from animals with PL, suggesting an increased
replicative capacity of these cells [327-329]. However,
lymphocyte homeostasis is the result of a critical balance
between cell proliferation and death. Disruption of this
equilibrium can lead to the onset of leukemia. Thus an
increase in lymphocyte number can be potentially
explained by either one or both of the above parameters.

To further gain insight into the processes mediating
pathogenesis, it is necessary to determine the kinetic
parameters which sustain the dynamics of the different
cell populations in infected animals. The proliferation
rates in BLV-infected and healthy sheep were initially
determined using intravenous injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). This in vivo approach revealed that B-lymphocytes are proliferating significantly faster in BLVpositive asymptomatic and lymphocytic sheep than in
uninfected controls (average proliferation rate of 0.020
day-1 versus 0.011 day-1), meaning that an excess of 0.9 %
cells (the difference between 2 and 1.1%) are produced by
proliferation each day [330]. The difference in the proliferation rates becomes even more evident at the terminal
neoplastic stage of the disease (proliferation rate increases
by up to tenfold). Cells in S/G2/M then also appear in the
peripheral blood (our unpublished results) similar to
findings documented for acute cases of human non-viral
leukemia [331]. In contrast, the death rates of the BrdUpositive cells are not significantly different between
aleukemic BLV-infected and control sheep.
In the natural host, BLV-infected cattle, the cell proliferation rates in asymptomatic and control animals are not
significantly different [325]. Surprisingly, the PL stage is
characterized by a decreased B cell turnover resulting from
a reduction of cell death as well as from an overall impairment of proliferation. Paradoxically, an excess of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood in PL animals correlates
with a reduction of cell proliferation, suggesting that a
mechanism of feedback regulation controls lymphocyte
homeostasis. Of note, the lymphocyte turnover is also
reduced in other lymphoaccumulative diseases such as,
CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), a B CD5+ chronic
leukemia in human (J. Defoiche, submitted). The reduced
dynamic parameters measured in cattle thus contrast with
the accelerated kinetics observed in experimentally
infected sheep. Whether these observations relate to the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

differences in disease acuteness in the two host species
remains a tempting but still open assumption.
Cells expressing viral proteins cannot be directly observed
in the peripheral blood of the infected animals at any
stage of the disease. However, viral expression can be
induced upon transient short term culture. Surprisingly,
very few (if any) cells spontaneously synthesizing CA antigen undergo proliferation in vivo [325,330]. Amongst all
infected cells proliferating in vivo as measured by BrdU
uptake, none is found to express viral protein. Since lymphocytes synthesizing p24gag are spared from apoptosis ex
vivo, p24+BrdU+ double positive cells are not lost during
culturing but appear to have been eliminated in vivo. If we
postulate that viral expression and cell activation are
closely linked, as widely illustrated in the literature, the
lack of p24+BrdU+ double positive cells then reveals a
very efficient negative selection which occurs in vivo.
Another non-exclusive interpretation would be that only
a subpopulation of infected cells is allowed to proliferate
(i.e. incorporate BrdU) provided that no viral proteins are
expressed. However, this model does not fit with the progressive accumulation of provirus-positive cells, if proliferation is triggered by a viral protein. What would indeed
be the selective advantage of a cell carrying a completely
silent provirus?
Whatever the involved mechanisms, these kinetic studies
cast light onto a very active process of immune selection
directed towards proliferating infected cells that express
an integrated provirus.
Lymphocyte trafficking in lymphoid organs
Homeostatic regulation of lymphocyte numbers in the
peripheral blood results from a series of physiological factors, of which cell proliferation and death are only partial
components. Indeed, kinetics of a cell population is also
influenced by recirculation to lymphoid organs, in which
proliferation is thought to primarily occur, at least under
normal conditions. In this context, experiments based on
BrdU kinetics lead to an apparent discrepancy: the imbalance created by the net increase in proliferation in the
absence of compensating cell death is estimated at 7 % per
day [330]. Since this considerable proliferation rate is not
reflected by a corresponding increase in the lymphocyte
numbers, other regulatory mechanisms including alteration of recirculation as well as a massive elimination of
cells in other tissues could play a role. To test these
hypotheses, B cell migration from blood to lymph and
back from lymph to blood has been traced with the carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), a fluorescent dye that labels proteins via their NH2 terminal
ends. Direct intravenous administration of CFSE into
sheep achieves remarkable labeling indexes: more than
98% of peripheral blood leukocytes become fluorescent

within seconds [332]. Since CFSE is extremely unstable in
aqueous solution, labeling is very short lived, making it
feasible to track lymphocyte migration from the periphery
through the lymph node in vivo. While most studies of
lymphocyte recirculation and homing have been done in
rodents, the sheep model offers the opportunity to study
the recirculation of lymphocytes through tissues by direct
cannulation of individual lymphatic vessels [333-335]
(Figure 5). Using this approach, it has been shown that Blymphocytes from BLV-infected and control sheep recirculate with similar rates [336]. In contrast, the proportions
of labeled B cells in the peripheral blood decrease significantly faster in infected sheep. Combined with another
parameter (the halving of the fluorescence intensity upon
cell division), it was possible to calculate proliferation
and death rates [337]. These calculations indicate that B
cells labeled with CFSE in the peripheral blood undergo
massive destruction during chronic BLV infection of sheep
[336]. Importantly, the CD11b subpopulation accounts
for the difference in CFSE kinetics in BLV-infected sheep
(i.e. the turnover of CD11b + B cells is increased), providing a rationale favoring the accumulation of these cells
during pathogenesis.
Collectively, quantification of the dynamic parameters
deduced from BrdU and CFSE kinetics shows that the
excess of proliferation in lymphoid organs can be compensated by increased death of the peripheral blood cell
population. An important issue that remains to be clarified is to identify the anatomic site required for this cell
destruction. In this context, our recent experiments
revealed that the spleen is a major lymphoid tissue regulating infected cell dynamics [338]. Indeed, the cell death
rates pertaining to the peripheral blood cells of BLVinfected and control sheep are similar after splenectomy,
revealing a key role of the spleen in B-lymphocyte dynamics.
Collectively, recent data show that the B lymphocyte turnover is accelerated in BLV-infected sheep. Amongst a series
of plausible hypotheses that cannot be formally excluded,
one of the possible models is that the increased turnover
results from an activated immune response directed
towards the virus. Continuous expression of viral antigens
could indeed exacerbate proliferation of virus-reactive
immune cells either directly or via cytokines with potential expansion of BLV-infected B lymphocytes. Excessive
proliferation of uninfected B-lymphocytes in response to
BLV early infection has recently been documented clearly
[245]. In addition, uninfected B lymphocytes also accumulate above normal levels during persistent lymphocytosis. Whether a similar anti-viral process is also
responsible for expansion of BLV-infected B cells is presently unknown. It would be interesting to determine the
B cell receptor specificity of the infected B lymphocytes.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

For instance, IgGs of CLL leukemic B cells are targeted
towards autoantigens or common bacterial infections
(DNA, glycerophospholipid, lipoprotein, and polysaccharides), permitting expansion of the transformed clone.
Arguments against this hypothetical mechanism of indirect viral spread include the absence of selective growth
advantage conferred to the infected cells. Why would a
viral antigen-specific B cell be preferentially infected by
the virus? We therefore favor a model in which the virus
plays an active role by continuously expressing viral proteins, like the Tax oncogene, able to promote cell proliferation and transformation (Figure 6). Tax expression could
be permanent, provided that cells escape from immune
response (which is a rare event), or initiated indirectly via
cellular activation. Concomitantly, Tax expression would
also stimulate the host's anti-viral immune response,
which in turn would clear the infected cells. Escape from
the immune response could be due to an uneven distribution of viral proteins between the daughter cells. Alternatively, shut off of viral expression possibly by epigenetic
processes (e.g. histone acetylation, histone methylation or
DNA methylation as described [100,339,340]) or involving a putative viral accessory factor (such as HBZ for HTLV
[341,342]) would be a prerequisite allowing a minority of
these cells to escape from immune response. Since the
presence of doubly spliced tax/rex transcripts in the cytoplasm precedes that of other viral mRNAs [179], it is possible that a subpopulation of cells would exclusively
express the Tax protein at least during a short interval. In
this model, Tax would be the driving force providing a
selective advantage and leading to clonal expansion of the
infected cells. Permanent expression of Tax would not
even be required in each mitotic cycle if cell activation is
maintained by a hit and run mechanism as previously
proposed by Mitsuaki Yoshida in 1986 [343]. A variety of
other processes involving for instance NFκB may also
account for ongoing mitotic replication. Finally, even if
this activation cannot persist through divisions, it is easily
conceivable that clonality results from a population of
cells having undergone different numbers of mitotic
cycles (i.e. a "ladder pattern") instead of a classical pyramid shape of the progeny population. The heterogeneity
of the telomere lengths observed in clonal populations of
tumor cells supports the latter hypothesis (our unpublished results).
Since very few lymphocytes expressing viral proteins can
be detected directly in vivo, the frequency of infected cells
which survive the host immune pressure is low. Also, this
process would only marginally affect the very large majority of infected cells containing a silent virus (or a modestly
expressed virus). The net outcome of this model would be
a global stability of the proviral loads with some fluctuations of individual clones, as revealed by long term follow-up of proviral integration sites by ligation-mediated

Hypothetical mechanism of BLV replication
Hypothetical mechanism of BLV replication. Normal B cell activation and proliferation depend on a variety of immune
stimuli, involving the BCR (and possibly CD5, section 3), CD40 ligand expressed by T cells, various cytokines or even autoantigens (see section 5). We hypothesize that BLV replication is initiated by these classical regulatory mechanisms because viral
expression can be augmented by molecules that mimic B cell activation by immune cells. Tax expression precedes that of structural and enzymatic proteins and promotes entry into the cell cycle, providing a selective proliferative advantage of the infected
cells (see section 4, The Tax transactivator). Uneven distribution of the viral proteins upon mitosis would generate two types
of infected cells containing or not BLV antigens (see section 4, The envelope gene). Other processes might account for silencing of viral expression in one daugther cell such as a specific inhibition by a viral factor such as HTLV p30 or HBZ (still to be
discovered for BLV). We think that BLV expression is ongoing continuously in vivo because viral transcripts are detected in
whole blood immediately upon incubation at 37°C in the absence of any exogenous factors (see section 5, Low levels of viral
expression are detected in vivo). Virus-positive cells would be destroyed by the immune response (see section 5, Host
humoral and cytotoxic immune responses) or would undergo apoptosis via intrinsic or extrinsic pathways (section 6: Is BLV
inhibiting apoptosis?). These cells would thus permanently stimulate the host's immune response. Cells in which viral expression has been shut off or lacking viral antigens after mitosis would enter a resting stage in the absence of Tax and/or immune
stimulation. These cells surviving destruction by the immune response can be isolated and observed ex vivo.

PCR. Although the mechanism is still unknown, variations in the abundance of provirus-positive cell clones
could be due to differential antigen stimulation or to
modulation of the proportions of individual progeny cells
to express virus. Hence, cells isolated from sheep at terminal stages of the disease lose their ability to efficiently
express virus ex vivo even in the presence of potent polyclonal activators such as phorbol esters (our unpublished
results). Ultimately, a fully transformed cell clone containing a deleted replication defective provirus can even
outgrow and induce leukemia [83].
A hypothetical model, which may also apply to HTLV
[344], is needed to reconcile the following experimental
findings which include the oncogenic potential of Tax, the
continuous stimulation of the immune system, the low
levels of detectable cells expressing viral proteins in vivo,
the apparent stability of individual proviral clones, and
the dynamic parameters of cell proliferation and cell
death. During BLV chronic infection, the host-pathogen
interplay is characterized by a very dynamic kinetics generating equilibrium between a virus attempting to proliferate under a tight control exerted by the immune
response. In this model, the virus permanently transits
between a latent and transcriptionally active phase resulting in the progressive accumulation of viable infected
cells. Occurrence of somatic mutations associated with
genetic instability in these cells ultimately permits the outgrowth of a transformed clone, leading to leukemia.

7. Modulation of viral expression as therapy
In the absence of ex vivo cell culture, the infected lymphocytes apparently do not express any viral protein in
the peripheral blood and rest in the G0/G1 phase of the
cell cycle. These apparently quiescent cells may undergo
spontaneous cell proliferation and express virions upon
transient short-term culturing. Agents known to activate
immune cells polyclonally cause an increase in the
number of cells containing BLV RNA [345]. Viral expression may thus be induced by activation of the host cell
after immune-mediated stimulation.
It is possible that an inhibitory mechanism (or the
absence of a driving force) hampers viral gene expression
in vivo. Persistence of infected cells would thus be permitted under the restrictive condition where viral proteins are
not expressed (or at least at a level undetectable by the
immune system). Evidence for a very strong immune
response is supported by the presence of virus specific
cytotoxic T cells and by high titers of cytolytic antibodies.
However, the lack of viral expression in a large proportion
of infected cells does not allow efficient clearance by the
immune system. Concomitantly, virus infection might
also correlate with inhibition of the apoptotic processes,
generating a reservoir of apparently latent cells. In this

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/18

context, we aimed at evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of a strategy based on the induction of viral and cellular gene expression. Among a number of
methodological approaches, modulation of chromatin
condensation, which is an essential component of the
gene expression process, can be achieved by interference
with the level of histone acetylation [346]. This mechanism results from an intrinsic balance between the activity
of two families of antagonistic enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDAC) and histone acetyltransferases, respectively
removing or incorporating acetyl groups into core histones (Figure 7). Although this model is probably oversimplified, acetyl removal by HDACs restores a positive
charge to the lysine residues in the histone N-terminal
tails and is thought to increase the affinity of histones for
DNA, leading to transcriptional repression. Conversely,
impairment of HDAC function with specific HDAC inhibitors activates both cellular and viral gene transcription.
Among a growing list of HDAC inhibitors, valproate (the
sodium salt of 2-propylpentanoic acid) offers a series of
advantages [347]. Widely used for several decades in treating epilepsy, this short-chain fatty acid has a very high
bioavailability, exhibits very low toxicity in adults and,
with a half life of 16–17 hours, has suitable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo. Therefore, valproate has been
selected to evaluate the effectiveness of gene activation
chemotherapy in leukemic sheep. Indeed, valproate effectively activates BLV gene expression in transient transfection experiments and in short-term cultures of primary Blymphocytes [339]. In vivo, valproate administration, in
the absence of any other cytotoxic drug, is efficient for the
treatment of leukemia/lymphoma in sheep, demonstrating the proof-of-concept of a therapy that targets the
expression of viral and/or cellular genes. Interestingly,
over a long term period, valproate treatment alters neither
the cell numbers in control sheep nor other lymphocyte
populations in BLV-infected animals, revealing a relative
innocuousness of the therapy.
The mechanism by which valproate specifically decreases
the number of leukemic cells remains to be determined.
Amongst numerous hypotheses, we propose a model
based on transient activation of cellular and/or viral
expression leading to apoptosis by intrinsic (for instance
dependent on mitochondrial regulated checkpoints) or
extrinsic mechanisms related to membrane-bound receptors (Fas, TRAIL,) [348-350]. It is possible that the
involved mechanisms are completely independent of viral
infection as indicated by our ongoing experiments in mesothelioma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (F.
Vandermeers and A. Bouzar). Alternatively, a very attractive model would include the induction of viral expression and destruction by the immune response.

Valproate, an inhibitor of deacetylases, activates gene transcription and induces apoptosis. Reciprocal reactions,
acetylation and deacetylation are catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Acetylation of
chromatin leads to deconsendation and activates transcription of a subset of genes. Valproate induces hyperacetylation, activates BLV expression and triggers apoptosis in cell culture. Valproate treatment of sheep with leukemia/lymphoma reduces the
number of tumor cells.
Based on the numerous similarities between BLV and
HTLV, we propose to investigate the therapeutic potential
of a valproate treatment in TSP/HAM and ATL. Indeed,
there are presently no satisfactory therapies for these diseases so far. Palliative treatments for HAM/TSP include
steroids to decrease inflammation [351-353]. Attempts to
treat HAM/TSP by interfering with cell invasion into the
CNS using inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases [354]
have been unsuccessful. Similarly, other strategies aimed
at inhibiting cell activation and/or viral replication with
cytokines (IFN-α or -β) [353] or anti-viral compounds
[355-358] did not show sufficient efficacy. ATL patients
have a very poor prognosis because of intrinsic chemoresistance and severe immunosuppression. Non-targeted
combinations of chemotherapy (CHOP) yield primary
responses but lack a significant effect on complete remission and survival [359]. Besides promising new drugs

such as arsenic trioxide and proteasome inhibitors, additional therapies are needed. In this context, valproatebased gene activation therapy should be considered.

8. Conclusion
BLV is the etiologic agent of enzootic bovine leukemia in
cattle, a disease which (depending on the part of the
world) is either eradicated or simply ignored. However,
the experimental infection of sheep with BLV provides an
interesting model of leukemogenesis. In particular, we
review here the viral genetic determinants required for
pathogenesis and present recent understanding of the
homeostatic regulation of leukemic B lymphocytes in
BLV-infected sheep. We also propose a novel therapeutic
concept targeting the expression of viral genes and involving the immune response. This strategy might also hold
promise for treating adult T cell leukemia (ATL) or human
