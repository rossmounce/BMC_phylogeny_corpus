Phylogeography and demographic history of
Lacerta lepida in the Iberian Peninsula: multiple
refugia, range expansions and secondary contact
zones
Andreia Miraldo1,3*, Godfrey M Hewitt1, Octavio S Paulo2 and Brent C Emerson1,4

Abstract
Background: The Iberian Peninsula is recognized as an important refugial area for species survival and
diversification during the climatic cycles of the Quaternary. Recent phylogeographic studies have revealed Iberia as
a complex of multiple refugia. However, most of these studies have focused either on species with narrow
distributions within the region or species groups that, although widely distributed, generally have a genetic
structure that relates to pre-Quaternary cladogenetic events. In this study we undertake a detailed phylogeographic
analysis of the lizard species, Lacerta lepida, whose distribution encompasses the entire Iberian Peninsula. We
attempt to identify refugial areas, recolonization routes, zones of secondary contact and date demographic events
within this species.
Results: Results support the existence of 6 evolutionary lineages (phylogroups) with a strong association between
genetic variation and geography, suggesting a history of allopatric divergence in different refugia. Diversification
within phylogroups is concordant with the onset of the Pleistocene climatic oscillations. The southern regions of
several phylogroups show a high incidence of ancestral alleles in contrast with high incidence of recently derived
alleles in northern regions. All phylogroups show signs of recent demographic and spatial expansions. We have
further identified several zones of secondary contact, with divergent mitochondrial haplotypes occurring in narrow
zones of sympatry.
Conclusions: The concordant patterns of spatial and demographic expansions detected within phylogroups,
together with the high incidence of ancestral haplotypes in southern regions of several phylogroups, suggests a
pattern of contraction of populations into southern refugia during adverse climatic conditions from which
subsequent northern expansions occurred. This study supports the emergent pattern of multiple refugia within
Iberia but adds to it by identifying a pattern of refugia coincident with the southern distribution limits of individual
evolutionary lineages. These areas are important in terms of long-term species persistence and therefore important
areas for conservation.

Background
Evidence from phylogeographic studies suggests that
southern Europe, including the peninsulas of Iberia,
Italy and the Balkans and areas near the Caucasus and
the Caspian Sea, have functioned as refugial areas for
species survival during periods of adverse climatic

conditions [1]. Recent studies also emphasize the important role that these refugial areas had in shaping the
evolutionary history of species that have persisted within
these regions for several ice ages. As suggested by early
studies [2-4] the topographic complexity and geographic
mosaic of habitats in southern refugial peninsulas have
favoured the occurrence of multiple disjunct refugia,
allowing the persistence of isolated populations within
them during glacial periods. Within the Iberian Peninsula, complex species histories have been revealed for a

variety of taxa, with some showing remarkable patterns
of phylogeographic concordance [see [5] and references
therein] involving deep genetic subdivisions, high haplotype richness and distinct hybrid zones. Not only has
the Iberian Peninsula sourced the northern redistribution of species after ice ages, but it has also facilitated
diversification through patterns of repeated population
fragmentation, contraction, expansion and admixture.
Phylogeographic analyses for the golden-striped salamander, Chioglossa lusitanica [6-8] and Schreiber’s
Lizard, Lacerta schreiberi [9,10] provide good examples
of the complexity that most likely typifies many species
within this major peninsular glacial refugium.
However, even though the Iberian Peninsula is the
best studied glacial refugium, most phylogeographic studies have focused on species that either have a narrow
distribution within the region (e.g Chioglossa lusitanica
[6], Lacerta schreiberi [9], Lissotriton boscai [11]) or
involve species groups that, although distributed across
the entire region, generally have a genetic structure that
relates to older cladogenetic events (e.g Podarcis spp.
[12,13], Alytes spp [14], Oryctolagus cunniculus [15,16]).
In order to better understand the complex phylogeographic history of Iberian species, and the way they have
responded to Pleistocene climatic oscillations, it is
important to study species with distributions encompassing the entire Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose
we have used the ocellated lizard, Lacerta lepida (Daudin, 1802), as a model to study the impact of Pleistocene
climatic changes in generating and structuring intraspecific genetic diversity on this regional scale. Lacerta
lepida is typically Mediterranean, with a distribution
encompassing all the Iberian Peninsula, and with phylogeographic structure across the region [17]. Several
mitochondrial lineages that appear to have non-overlapping geographic ranges were recently described, suggesting a history of allopatric differentiation in multiple
refugia during the Plio-Pleistocene [17]. Here we assess
the broader phylogeographic patterns within Lacerta
lepida with the specific aims to i) clarify the distribution
of mtDNA phylogroups; ii) identify refugial areas within
these phylogroups during the glacial periods; iii) date
the main demographic and evolutionary events within
Lacerta lepida; and finally iv) identify secondary contact
zones between the different phylogroups.
It is generally accepted that phylogeographic histories
recovered using only mtDNA as a marker are constrained to reveal one genealogy that reflects the maternally inherited natural history of an organism.
Relationships among phylogroups inferred through
mtDNA might be discordant with inferences made
based on nuclear genes (Harrison 1991; Avise 2000) and
discordances have been illustrated in several studies [e.g.
[18-24]]. Particularly within the Iberian Peninsula,

Page 2 of 19

several studies have emphasized the importance of using
different types of markers to fully recover the complex
evolutionary and demographic scenarios that most likely
characterize the species that have persisted there across
the Quaternary. For example, in Lacerta schreiberi evidence for gene flow and ancestral introgression between
apparently allopatric mtDNA lineages was only detected
by the use of nuclear markers [10]. Here we use both
mtDNA and nDNA derived genealogies, since their contrasting molecular and population properties (principally
uniparental versus biparental mode of inheritance and
contrasting population sizes) are mutually informative
when there have been opportunities for secondary contact, gene flow and hybridization between diverging
populations.

Methods
Sampling

Lizards were captured under licence during the years
2005, 2006 and 2007, sampling most of the distribution
of Lacerta lepida in Portugal, Spain, and France. Sampling intensity was concentrated in regions known to
contain high genetic divergence within western and
south-eastern part of Iberia [17]. Lizards were captured
using tomahawk traps or by hand, and tissue samples
were taken by clipping 1 cm of the tail tip that was subsequently preserved in 100% ethanol. After tissue sampling, animals were immediately released back into the
wild in the place of capture. Geographic coordinates of
sampling sites were recorded with a GPS.
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted from ethanol-preserved muscle tissue using a salt extraction protocol
[25,26]. A fragment of 627 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (cytb) gene was
amplified using the truncated version of primer L14841
[27] (CYTBF, 5’-CCA TCC AAC ATC TCA GCA TGA
TGA AA-3’) and the modified version of primer MV16
[28] (CYTBR, 5’- AAA TAG GAA GTA TCA CTC
TGG TTT-3’) to increase specificity for Lacerta lepida,
using information from published sequences in GenBank. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 0.5 U of
Taq polymerase (BIOTAQ™), 4 mM of MgCl2, 0.4 mM
of each nucleotide (Bioline), 0.4 μM of each primer, 2 μl
of 10 × NH4 reaction buffer (Bioline) and approximately
50 ng of DNA. PCR amplifications were conducted as
follows: DNA was initially denaturated at 94°C for 3
min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
45 s, annealing at 51°C for 45 s and extension at 72°C
for 45 s, plus a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.
Negative controls (no DNA) were included for all amplifications. PCR products were visualized on a 2% agarose

gel and purified by filtration through QIAquick ® columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Purified PCR products were sequenced in both
directions using the above primers, Taq polymerase BigDye Terminator v3.1™ (Applied Biosystems) and 30-90
ng of PCR product.
Intron 7 of the b-fibrinogen gene (b-Fibint7) has been
successfully used as a nuclear marker in several vertebrate phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies [e.g.
[13,29-32]]. Specifically it was recently employed for a
phylogenetic study of the genus Lacerta [17] where it
revealed sufficient variation within Lacerta lepida to be
useful for phylogeographical inference. Initial b-fibint7
amplifications were performed using primers FIB-B17U
(5’- GGA GAA AAC AGG ACA ATG ACA ATT CAC
- 3’) and FIB-B17L (5’ - TCC CCA GTA GTA TCT
GCC ATT AGG GTT - 3’) [29] and the conditions
described in Paulo et al. [17]. However, due to low
amplification and sequencing success a nested PCR
approach as suggested by Sequeira et al. [32] was subsequently adopted. A fragment of 788bp was first amplified from genomic DNA using primers FIB-B17U and
FIB-B17L (PCRa). The product of this reaction (1 μl)
was then used as a template for a subsequent PCR of
691bp (PCRb) using primer BFXF [32] and BFX8 [13].
Both amplifications were performed in a total volume of
25 μl, and included reagents in the same concentrations
as those specified for cytb gene fragment. PCR cycle
conditions were the same as described for cytb fragment
but the primer annealing temperatures were 55°C and
56°C, for PCRa and PCRb respectively. Negative controls
(no DNA) were included for all amplifications. Purified
PCRb products were then sequenced with primers
BFBX and BFX8 using identical sequencing conditions
as for the mtDNA cytb sequencing. All PCRs and
sequencing reactions were performed in a MJ Research
thermocycler (PTC-240 DNA Engine Tetrad 2) and
sequences were obtained using an ABI 3700 capillary
sequencer.
Sequence analysis

DNA sequences were aligned by eye using BioEdit
Sequence Alignment Editor 7.01 [33]. b-fibint7 alleles
of heterozygous individuals were inferred using Phase
version 2.1 [34,35]. Ten replicate Phase runs were conducted using 1000 burnin steps and 1000 iterations.
The Phase probability threshold was first set to 0.90,
but not all genotypes were resolved at this threshold.
Garrick et al. [36], suggest that lowering the Phase
threshold to 0.60 reduces the number of unresolved
haplotypes with little or no increase in the number of
false positives. In contrast, omitting unresolved haplotypes may have a substantial impact on downstream
analyses, such as the estimation of Tajima’s D and Fu’s

Page 3 of 19

Fs statistics, as unresolved haplotypes usually represent
rare alleles [36]. We therefore reduced the Phase
threshold to 0.60 to maximise recovery of haplotypes.
Several tests implemented in the software RDP3
[Recombination Detection Program, [37]] were used to
detect evidence for recombination in b-fibint7: RDP
[38], GENECONV [39], Maximum Chi Square [40,41],
Chimaera [40] and Sister Scanning [42]. Due to the
small size of the fragment used in the analyses (315
bp), the window size for the recombination detection
methods was set to 20bp.
Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype network
construction

Phylogenetic relationships among cytb haplotypes were
inferred using Bayesian inference as implemented in
Mrbayes v3.1.2 [43,44]. Data was divided into two partitions: (1st +2nd ) and (3rd) codon positions. The most
appropriate substitution model for each partition was
selected using Modeltest v3.7 [45] and the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) [46]. The model selected
for both partitions was the same (GTR + I) but with a
different proportion of invariable sites (pinv(1st+2nd) =
0.79 and pinv(3 rd ) = 0.09). The different partitions
were allowed to evolve at different rates, with unlinked
topology and unlinked parameters for the nucleotide
substitution models. Four Markov chains were run for
10 million generations. To avoid local optima we used
two independent runs, and to improve swapping of
states between heated and cold chains the heating
parameter was decreased to 0.05. Trees were sampled
every 1000 generations and the first 100 trees were
discarded as burn-in. Posterior probabilities were
obtained from the 50% majority-rule consensus tree of
the retained trees.
Intraspecific gene genealogies were inferred using the
median-joining (MJ) [47] and the statistical parsimony
(SP) [48] network construction approaches. The MJ
network was computed with the program Network
4.5.0 (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com) and the SP
network was inferred using the program Tcs 1.21 [49].
For the MJ approach the parameter ε was set to 0, preventing less parsimonious pathways from being
included in the analysis. The SP network was inferred
with a parsimony confidence limit of 95%, allowing the
inclusion of less parsimonious alternatives that fall
within this confidence limit. Ambiguities within networks were resolved where possible following the criteria of Crandall & Templeton [50]. The phylogenetic
and b-Fibint7 network analyses were rooted using gene
sequences of the African sister species Lacerta pater
(Lataste, 1880) [17,51] (Genebank accession numbers:
AF: 378967 and EU: 365413 for cytb and b-Fibint7
genes respectively).

Estimation of divergence times

Divergence times within and between phylogroups were
estimated using Beast version 1.4.8 [52] and the cytb
dataset. Beast performs Bayesian statistical inferences of
parameters, such as divergence times, by using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a framework. Input
files were generated with Beauti version 1.4.8 [53]. The
nucleotide substitution model and its parameter values
were selected according to the results of Modeltest version 3.7 [45], with upper and lower bounds around the
values defined as 120% and 80% respectively [54].
According to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
and the hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Tests (hLRT’s),
the model of nucleotide substitution identified as the
best fit to the data is the HKY model [55] with a
gamma distribution (Γ) for substitution rates across sites
(shape parameter, a = 0.2889) and no category of invariable sites. An uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular
clock was used with mean mutation rate of 0.01 mutations/site/million years and standard deviation of 0.0015,
assuming a normal distribution, as prior information.
The mutation rate used was based on the provisional
calibration of a reptile-specific molecular clock presented in Paulo et al. [9] who used published cytochrome b data sets from two studies of Canary island
reptiles (Gallotia spp.) [56,57] calibrated with the geological age of El Hierro. The standard deviation included
in our study encompasses a faster mutation rate of
0.0115 and a slower mutation rate of 0.0085 mutations/
site/million years. This takes into account potential
underestimation of the mutation rate due to violation of
the assumption of immediate island colonization in the
clock calibration of Paulo et al. [9], or overestimation
due to the longer generation time and larger body size
of Lacerta spp. when compared to Gallotia spp. [58].
Two runs were executed for 106 generations, sampling
every 500 generations and discarding the first 10% as
burn in. Results of the two runs were displayed and
combined in Tracer v1.4 [59] to check for stationarity
and ensure that ESSs were above 200. For all analyses
one sequence of Lacerta pater (Genebank accession
number: AF378967) was included as an outgroup.
In a second approach to estimate divergence times
within phylogroups the method of Saillard et al. [60]
was employed where each extant haplotype descending
from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) represents a time interval between the present and the
MRCA. Average distances from the MRCA within each
phylogroup are calculated from the number of mutational steps separating each haplotype from the MRCA.
The absolute timing of divergence is then calculated by
multiplying the observed values by the average mutational changes per lineage per million years (Myr).
Three mutation rates were used: 0.01 mutations/site/

Page 4 of 19

million years, representing the average mutation rate; a
faster mutation rate of 0.0115, and a slower mutation
rate of 0.0085.
Neutrality tests and demographic analyses

In order to detect departures from a constant population size under the neutral model, Tajima’s D [61],
Ramos-Onsins & Rozas’ R2 [62] and Fu’s Fs [63] tests
were applied to both mtDNA and nDNA datasets. Both
R2 and Fs statistics have been shown to be the best statistical tests to detect population growth (R2 has been
suggested to behave better for small sample sizes
whereas Fs is better for bigger ones) [62]. Population
expansions have also been shown to leave particular signatures in the distribution of pairwise sequence differences [64,65]. We capitalized upon this by employing
statistics based on the mismatch distribution to test for
demographic expansions. The observed distribution of
pairwise differences between haplotypes within phylogroups was compared with the expected results under
a sudden-demographic and a spatial-demographic
expansion model. Statistically significant differences
between observed and simulated expected distributions
were evaluated with the sum of the square deviations
(SSD) and Harpending’s raggedness index (hg) [66,67].
For the b-Fibint7 gene we used two datasets: the first
including only haplotypes inferred by Phase with probability higher than 0.90, and the second including all
haplotypes inferred with the less stringent Phase probability threshold of 0.60. Tests were performed with
Arlequin version 3.11 [68] for Tajima’s D, Fu’s Fs, SDD
and hg, and with DNAsp version 4.50 [69] for R2 and
expected values for the mismatch distribution. The
demographic history of each phylogroup was also
inferred using a coalescent-based approach. The model
used to infer past population dynamics was the Bayesian
Skyline Plot (BSP, [70]) as implemented in Beast version
1.4.8 [52]. For each phylogroup we carried out two independent runs of 10 million generations each. Trees and
parameters were sampled every 1000 iterations, with a
burn in of 10%. Results of each run were visualized
using Tracer v1.4 [59] to ensure stationarity and convergence had been reached, and that effective sample sizes
(ESS) were higher than 200.
Geographical distribution of alleles and inference of
refugial areas

Using predictions from coalescent theory (haplotypes at
the tips of a tree are younger than interior haplotypes to
which they are connected) ancestral and derived haplotypes within each phylogroup were identified, thus
obtaining a temporal framework for inferring haplotype
origin within phylogroups. The null hypothesis of random geographic distribution of haplotypes was tested

Miraldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:170

from the MRCA within both the north and south of the
geographic range of a phylogroup. We then tested
whether these values were significantly high or low by
randomizing the geographic states of alleles to generate
a null distribution of mean haplotype distance from the
MRCA within both the south and north of a phylogroup’s distribution.

statistically using Geodis version 2.5 [71] with significance testing by permuting the data 106 times. When
non-random associations of haplotypes with geography
were detected, the geographic distribution of ancestral
versus derived haplotypes (interior and tip haplotypes,
respectively) was further explored to identify possible
refugial areas and the directionality of previously
detected demographic and spatial expansions. Coalescent theory predicts refugial areas to exhibit a high frequency of ancestral haplotypes [72], and therefore the
average number of mutations of a haplotype from the
MRCA is expected to be significantly lower in refugial
areas than would be expected by chance. In contrast,
recently colonized areas are predicted to show a high
incidence of derived haplotypes [72], and therefore the
average number of mutations of a haplotype from the
MRCA is expected to be significantly higher than would
be expected by chance. To test the hypothesis that refugial areas are located in the south of a phylogroup’s distribution, with the north having been more recently
colonized, we estimated the average distances of alleles

Results
A total of 353 lizards were sampled from 129 different
sites across the distribution of Lacerta lepida. Sampling
sites and number of samples per site are shown in Figure 1 and Additional file 1, Table S1, respectively. A
total of 321 cytb and 104 b-Fibint7 sequences were
obtained.
Sequence variability

All cytb sequences represented uninterrupted open reading frames, with no gaps or premature stop codons, suggesting they are functional mitochondrial DNA copies.

at several nucleotide positions. These samples were from
individuals collected at sampling sites 59 (1 sample), 79
(2 samples), 80 (1 sample), 84 (1 sample), 86 (2 samples), 88 (1 sample) and 89 (1 sample). As it was not
possible to correctly identify the corresponding mitochondrial sequence of each sample these sequences
were eliminated from further analysis. One hundred and
forty five (145) unique haplotypes were obtained from
the 312 sequences analysed. Of a total of 627 sites
sequenced, 168 were variable, from which 129 were parsimony informative. Pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected p-values) between haplotypes ranged from 0.16%
to 13.2% (Table 1). b-fibint7 sequences were trimmed to
315 bp in order to eliminate gaps within the sequences.
From the 315 bp, 15 sites were variable of which 6 were
parsimony informative. The haplotypes inferred by
Phase for heterozygous individuals were consistent
across runs. Twenty unique haplotypes (B1 to B20) were
identified among the 208 alleles analysed and recombination was not detected by any of the tests applied.
When using a Phase probability threshold of 0.90, 8
genotypes were unresolved (Additional file 1, Table S1),
and this included the loss of only a single haplotype
(B7) that was additionally recovered with a probability
threshold of 0.60.
Phylogenetic and network relationships among
haplotypes

The results of the phylogenetic and network analyses
both support the existence of two main phylogroups:
phylogroup N and phylogroup L (Figure 2). The geographic distribution of phylogroup N is coincident
with the Betic Mountains in south-eastern Spain and is
associated with the subspecies Lacerta lepida nevadensis (Buscholz, 1963), while phylogroup L occupies the
remaining area of the species distribution. Within phylogroup L there are four geographically structured
monophyletic groups (L1, L2, L3 and L5), albeit with
only moderate Bayesian support for the monophyly of
L5 (Figure 2). The genealogical relationships among

cytb haplotypes inferred by the two approaches for
network construction (MJ and SP) are highly congruent. At the 95% confidence limit TCS produced three
unconnected networks (results not shown). When the
confidence limit was reduced (to 92% to include group
L2 and to 65 mutational steps for group N) the three
SP networks were connected in one single network
(Figure 3), with relationships identical to those from
the MJ analysis, with 12 loops, of which 7 were easily
resolved by applying the criteria of Crandall and Templeton [50].
Within phylogroup L, five geographically distinct
groups of haplotypes can be identified (Figure 3 and Figure 4), which include the four mitochondrial phylogroups (L1-L4) identified by Paulo et al. [17] and a
new lineage of haplotypes (L5) possessing a geographically distinct distribution from other haplotypes within
phylogroup L4. Average genetic distances (uncorrected
p distances) between these phylogroups range from 1.1%
(between phylogroup L4 and L5) to 3.28% (between
phylogroups L2 and L5; and L2 and L1). Phylogroup L1
is distributed mainly across the Central Mountain system between the Douro and Tagus river basins in Spain.
Phylogroup L2 is distributed in southern Portugal, occupying the regions of Algarve and Baixo Alentejo. This
phylogroup is clustered together in the network with
phylogroup L3 (Figure 3) forming a monophyletic group
in the phylogeny (Figure 2). L3 is distributed several
hundred kilometres (300 to 450 km) to the north of L2
occupying the north-western corner of Iberia, mainly
the regions to the north of the Douro River in Portugal
and the regions of Asturias and Galicia in Spain. The
geographic region between phylogroups L3 and L2 is
occupied by two other phylogroups, L4 and L5. Phylogroup L5 is restricted to central Portugal, occupying
the region between the Tagus and Douro rivers. L4 has
the broadest distribution, occupying the remaining areas
of southern Portugal and Spain passing through the
Ebro valley to reach the Atlantic and Mediterranean
coasts of France.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic relationships among cytochrome b sequences (627 bp). Fifty percent majority-rule consensus phylogram from the
Bayesian inference analysis. Numbers above branches represent posterior probabilities. Haplotype numbers are the same as in Figure 3 and as in
Additional file, Table S1. Colours represent the geographic distribution of haplotypes as in Figure 5.

The root of the network is located along the branch
that connects the very divergent lineages L and N,
allowing for the inference of the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) for each phylogroup (Figure 3).
Although this identification is straightforward for clade

N (haplotype 126), the networks reveal two probable
ancestral haplotypes within clade L (haplotypes 127 and
104), which are connected to haplotype 126 through a
loop. SP and MJ networks constructed with 0-fold

Figure 4 Distribution of Lacerta lepida mitochondrial phylogroups based on 627 bp of the cytochrome b gene. Colours are the same as
in Figures 2 and 3. Filled red circles represent populations where divergent haplotypes from two or more phylogroups were detected in
sympatry. Numbers correspond to sampling localities as in Figure 1 and Additional file 1, Table S1.

unresolved reticulations (Figure 5). Haplotype B15 is
inferred to be the ancestral haplotype as it connects
unambiguously to the outgroup. Haplotype B15 is
restricted to the south-west of the species distribution
(sampling sites 11, 56, 72, 94 and 112). Haplotype B1 is
the most common haplotype and has the widest distribution within the group, occurring in 83% of samples.
This haplotype is connected to several low frequency
haplotypes, generating a star-like genealogy, suggestive
of a possible past range expansion and for which signatures of expansion were formally detected by mismatch
distribution analysis and neutrality tests (Table 2).
Within the 50 southernmost samples, 16 alleles are
found, representing 80% of the nuclear allele diversity.
From those 16 alleles, 8 are restricted to the southern
area.

The nuclear data failed to recover the phylogroups
detected by the mtDNA dataset. Nevertheless, when
the nuclear dataset is grouped according to the
mtDNA phylogroups previously identified, structure in
the distribution of alleles can be detected. For this analysis each of the mtDNA phylogroups was considered
as a geographic region and Geodis was used to test for
geographical structure amongst the nuclear genetic
variation. Nuclear haplotypes are shared among some
of the mtDNA phylogroups (with the exception of phylogroup N): all haplotypes from L3 (B7 and B20) occur
either in L1 (B7) or in L5 (B20); all haplotypes from
L2 (B4, B6, B13 and B14) occur in L4 (with B13 also
occurring in L5); all haplotypes from L5 (B5, B13 and
B20) occur either in L4 (B5 and B13), either in L3
(B20) or in L2 (B13) and finally haplotypes from L1

Additionally all phylogroups share haplotype B1 (the
most common and one of the most ancestral haplotypes) and all phylogroups apart from L3 and L5 also
share haplotype B15 (the most ancestral haplotype). It
is important to note that only geographically close

phylogroups share nuclear haplotypes. It is also possible to identify private haplotypes within the geography
of several mtDNA phylogroups: B2 was only detected
in phylogroup L1; haplotypes B3, B9, B10, B14, B16
and B18 in L4 and haplotypes B8, B11, B12 and B19 in
phylogroup N.

Divergence times

Mean ages and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) of
mtDNA phylogroups are shown in Table 3. Divergence
within the group is estimated to have started approximately 9.4 million years ago (Ma) (5.58-13.66) in the
mid-late Miocene, corresponding to the cladogenetic
event between phylogroups N and L. Although divergence within phylogroup L is estimated to have started
in the Plio-Pleistocene (1.96 Ma; 1.13-2.91) the current
diversity within each phylogroup seems to have Pleistocene origins, with diversification times for all phylogroups estimated to be younger than 1.0 Ma. The
oldest split within group L relates to the divergence of

Neutrality tests and demographic analyses

Significant deviations from neutrality that could reflect
past population expansion events were detected for
almost all phylogroups with Tajima’s D, with the exception of phylogroup L3. When more powerful statistics
were applied, a similar pattern of significant deviations
from neutrality were observed, with the exception of
phylogroups L1 and L3 (Table 2). The distributions of
pairwise differences within each phylogroup were also
found to be consistent with sudden-expansion and

being exhibited by the bell shaped mismatch distributions (Figure 6). Historical demographic reconstructions
(BSPs) also show a trend of population growth in all

Within phylogroups, statistically significant associations

L5 allowed for the testing of hypotheses of southern
refugial origin and northern expansion. The average
number of mutations of haplotypes from the MRCA in
southern regions of phylogroups L3 and L5 was significantly lower than that expected by chance (2.25 and
3.03 for L3 and L5, respectively) (Figure 8). In contrast,
northern haplotypes exhibit a significantly higher average number of mutations from the MRCA than
expected by chance (3.85 and 4.04 for L3 and L5,
respectively) (Figure 8). These results reveal significant
associations of ancestral haplotypes with southern
ranges and derived haplotypes with northern regions for
these two phylogroups.

Discussion
Detailed analysis of the distribution of mitochondrial
genetic variation within Lacerta lepida across the Iberian Peninsula revealed a complex phylogeographic history for the species. The cytb genealogy clearly defines 6
geographic phylogroups with generally non-overlapping
geographic distributions. The strong association of
mtDNA genetic variation with geography suggests a history of allopatric divergence in different refugia within
the Iberian Peninsula, a pattern that has been described

for several taxa within the region [see [5], and references
therein]. Although this pattern of differentiation of distinct evolutionary units in allopatry was less evident
from the analysis of the nuclear data, the distribution of
nuclear haplotypes is not in conflict with the mtDNA
phylogroups. Failure of the nuclear gene genealogy to
reveal concordant genetic structure with the mitochondrial genealogy can be expected if one takes into
account the fact that nuclear genes take on average four
times longer to reach monophyly than mitochondrial

Figure 8 Observed and null model expected distances of haplotypes from the MRCA in southern and northern regions of
phylogroups L3 and L5. Null model distributions were generated by randomising the geographic states of alleles (see text for details). Arrows
indicate observed distances. For both phylogroups the average distance of southern haplotypes from the MRCA is significantly less than would
be expected by chance, and the average distance of northern haplotypes from the MRCA is significantly greater than would be expected by
chance. L3 southern populations: 78, 81, 82, 83, 85, 93 and 94; L3 northern populations: 87, 89, 90, 91 and 92; L5 southern: 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,
22, 53, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 and 100; L5 northern populations: 56, 58, 78, 79, 82, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106 and 108.

ones [73]. In fact, most of the intraspecific differentiation within Lacerta lepida is of relatively recent origin,
with the majority of phylogroups (L1 to L5) estimated
to have diversified within the Pleistocene, increasing the
probability of mitochondrial lineages not being reciprocally monophyletic for nuclear markers. Nevertheless,
phylogroup N is estimated to have diverged from the
remaining phylogroups during the Miocene (5.6-13.7
Ma) representing a much older cladogenetic event
within the group. This older split therefore allows for
more time for lineage sorting at the nuclear level. This
is evident in the composition of nuclear haplotypes of
phylogroup N, which are almost all private with the
exception of the ancestral haplotypes (which are shared
among almost all phylogroups). Thus, although mtDNA
lineages have not reached monophyly at the nuclear
level, some level of nuclear differentiation between
mtDNA lineages is detected by the existence of private
alleles, and this is most pronounced for phylogroups
that represent older cladogenetic events (L1, L4 and N).

Incomplete lineage sorting seems therefore a plausible
explanation for the discrepancies in mitochondrial and
nuclear gene genealogies. Recent phylogeographic and
phylogenetic studies focusing on lizards in the Iberian
Peninsula reveal similar discrepant patterns between
mtDNA and nuclear genealogies [10,13]. In the case of
Podarcis wall lizards Pinho et al. [13] showed that,
despite a complete lack of monophyly at the nuclear
level, most of the species show historical reproductive
isolation and that the lack of monophyly is mainly a
result of shared ancestral polymorphism.
Although it is plausible that incomplete lineage sorting
is responsible for the failure of nuclear genealogy to
recover the mitochondrial phylogroups in Lacerta
lepida, current gene flow, mainly male-biased, at zones
of secondary contact can also be invoked to explain the
patterns observed. Evidence for this comes from the
observation that geographically close phylogroups share
more derived haplotypes. For example allele B20 occurs
only in the very divergent phylogroups L3 and L5 near

Miraldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:170
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/170

the zone of contact, but it was not detected in the
ancestral phylogroup L4, suggesting that nuclear gene
flow may be occurring between the L3 and L5 mtDNA
lineages. The same is true for allele B4 which, although
more widespread within phylogroup L4, is also found in
individuals of L2 near the zone of contact, but was not
detected in phylogroup L3, which is phylogenetically
closer to phylogroup L2.
Historical biogeography of Lacerta lepida

Divergence within Lacerta lepida is estimated to have
started in the Miocene, approximately 9.4 Mya (5.5813.66), with divergence of phylogroup N from phylogroup L. Within phylogroup L estimated divergence
times are much younger and inferred to have been
initiated in the Plio-Pleistocene, approximately 1.96 Mya
(1.13-2.91 Mya). Interestingly, although divergences
between the mitochondrial phylogroups have a PlioPleistocene (within group L) or a late Miocene (for
group N) origin, haplotype diversities within phylogroups indicate a strong influence of later Pleistocene
events, with diversification within phylogroups starting
between 0.92 and 0.45 Ma. The importance of the Pleistocene climatic oscillations in promoting species differentiation in the Iberian Peninsula has been emphasized
by previous studies [see [5], for a recent review] and this
clearly also seems to be the case for Lacerta lepida.
Phylogroup N

Phylogroup N is distributed across the Betic Mountain
range in south-western Spain and its distribution
approximately coincides with the described subspecies
Lacerta lepida nevadensis. The existence of clear significant morphological differentiation between L. l. nevadensis and the remaining subspecies of Lacerta lepida
[74-76], together with high levels of allozyme differentiation [76] and mitochondrial genetic differentiation (our
study and [17]), suggests that the two lineages (N and
L) might in fact reflect two different species. Paulo et al.
[17] have inferred that divergence between phylogroups
L and N were initiated by overseas dispersal between
what was then the Iberian mainland and the Betic Massif that at that time existed as an island between Iberia
and North Africa. Under this scenario subsequent contact between the phylogroups would have been initiated
after the merging of the Betic Massif with Iberian mainland, due to the closing of the Betic corridor 7.8-7.6 Ma
[see [77,78] for a detailed explanation of the kinematics
of the western Mediterranean basin]. The Betic Mountain range is a region of high endemism for plants and
animals, and its importance as a refugium for other taxa
has been highlighted before [see [5]]. Interestingly, some
of these taxa show similar divergence times and distribution as phylogroup N (e.g. Salamandra salamandra
longirostris [79] and Alytes dickhilleni [80]).

Phylogroups L2 and L3

The monophyletic group composed of phylogroups L2
and L3 is estimated to have started diverging from the
remaining phylogroups in the early Pleistocene, approximately 1.5 Mya (0.82-2.27). Interestingly these two phylogroups have a disjunct distribution, with phylogroup
L2 occupying the south of Portugal whereas L3 occupies
the north-western parts of the Iberian Peninsula. The
intervening region between phylogroups L2 and L3 is
occupied by phylogroup L5. A vicariant event during
the Middle Pleistocene (0.82-2.27 Mya) triggering divergence between the L2-L3 lineage and the remaining
populations of Lacerta lepida seems probable. It is noteworthy that most phylogeographic studies within Iberia
reveal similar phylogenetic breaks associated with the
same period (e.g. Chioglossa lusitanica [6,7], Oryctolagus
cuniculus [81], Lacerta schreiberi [9,82]), suggesting a
common vicariant history. Such a vicariant event was
most likely climatically-mediated as no apparent geographical barrier exists within western Iberian Peninsula.
The western Algarve region in southern Portugal has
been indicated as the evolutionary centre for several
species and also as a key refugial area [83,84]. The
region harboured relicts of temperate forests during the
Last Glacial Maximum [85], probably providing suitable
conditions for species survival through glacial periods.
The high genetic distance and disjunct distribution
found between phylogroups L2 and L3 is most likely the
consequence of fragmentation of a once more continuous range in response to a cooling climate. Subsequent
climate amelioration during an interglacial period probably resulted in this distribution gap being colonized by
L5, expanding from another nearby refugium. A similar
distribution pattern of genetic variation is found within
Discoglossus galganoi across Portugal, with two closely
related phylogroups distributed in the south and north
and a less related phylogroup bisecting their distribution
[86]. The distribution of Discoglossus galganoi phylogroups and the evolutionary relationship between
them is remarkably similar to that found within Lacerta
lepida.
Phylogroups L1, L4 and L5

The refugia for Lacerta lepida phylogroups L1, L4 and
L5 were probably located in the south-eastern side of
the Guadalquivir basin. Support for this comes from the
distribution of ancestral haplotypes 127, 140 and 8
within phylogroup L4 that are found only in this region
(localities 10, 12, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41). The two
very divergent haplotypes within L4 (60 and 61) are also
restricted to this region. The widespread distribution of
the most frequently sampled haplotype 1 suggests that
the spatial and demographic expansion detected within
L4 was of a “leading edge” type [87,88], with few individuals rapidly colonizing adjacent regions, leading to a

Miraldo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:170
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/170

decrease in genetic diversity on the newly colonized
areas. The different phylogroups are most likely the
result of three different expansions from the southern
refugia dominated by different ancestral haplotypes, followed by further divergence in allopatry.
Refugial areas, range expansions, and secondary contact

The lower mutation rate and slower fixation rate of
nuclear genes, when compared to the mitochondrial
genome, mean that nuclear genealogies may be more
indicative of older demographic events [89]. Therefore,
the analysis of the distribution of ancestral nuclear
alleles can be useful in the identification of refugial
areas. Haplotype B15 is the root of the nuclear gene network, representing the most ancestral allele in the dataset. The distribution of B15 is primarily in the southern
region of Iberia, where it occurs with higher frequency
than in northern regions (70% of samples with haplotype B15 are from southern latitudes). Furthermore the
southern region of Iberia (to the south of river Tagus)
shows higher nuclear haplotype richness, with 90% of
the identified haplotypes occurring in this region from
which 67% do not occur further north. The high nuclear
haplotype richness found in the southern regions of
Iberia, together with the high frequency of B15 in this
region suggest that southern populations are older and
the source of subsequent northern expansions.
The geographical and genealogical relationships of
mitochondrial haplotypes within phylogroups provide
further indications as to the probable refugial areas from
where range expansions subsequently occurred. The
same pattern of older (interior) haplotypes being typically found within southern sampling sites is also evident for the mitochondrial dataset. For example within
phylogroup L2, the ancestral haplotype 96 and the
related interior haplotype 93 are most frequent in southern sites 25, 63, 64, 66, 69 and 70, coincident with the
Algarve and southern Alentejo region in Portugal.
Within phylogroup L3 the ancestral haplotype 51 and
the related interior haplotype 46 occur either in the
southern region of the phylogroup distribution, to the
south of Douro river (sites 82 and 78), or in sites
located at the centre of the phylogroup distribution
(sites 87, 89 and 92). Within phylogroup L4, the ancestral haplotype 127 and the closely related haplotypes
140 and 8 occur again only in the south-eastern limit of
this phylogroup (sites 10, 12, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and
41), near the source of the Guadalquivir river in Jaen,
Spain. Finally the ancestral haplotype of phylogroup L5
(haplotype 13) and the related interior haplotypes 14
and 17 are most frequent within southern sites of this
phylogroup (sites 22, 95, 96 and 99), along the river
Tagus basin. These patterns are statistically significant
for phylogroups L3 and L5 (Figure 8), which also reveal

Page 16 of 19

an excess of derived haplotypes in the north of their
geographic ranges. These repeated pattern of ancestral
haplotypes occurring more frequently towards the
southern range of phylogroups, and in some cases
derived haplotypes being more frequent within more
northern sites, suggests that southern regions within
phylogroup ranges have probably functioned as refugia
during past adverse climatic conditions, from which
subsequent northern expansions occurred.
The evolutionary history of Lacerta lepida is consistent with a history of population fragmentation and allopatric divergence in southern refugia, followed by recent
demographic and spatial range expansions. Demographic
expansions are supported by the neutrality and mismatch distribution tests that reveal signatures of demographic and spatial expansions in almost all phylogroups
and by the BSP analysis, which show a trend of population expansion in all phylogroups between 0.1 to 0.15
million years ago (Figure 7). Spatial expansions are supported by the latitudinal variation observed for the distributions of ancestral and derived haplotypes. This
history of diversification in allopatry followed by range
expansions has lead to the establishment of at least four
secondary contact zones where very divergent mitochondrial haplotypes belonging to different phylogroups
were found in sympatry (Figure 4). Further analyses of
these zones may provide insights into the mechanisms
involved in speciation and divergence within this lizard
species.

Conclusions
Mitochondrial and nuclear gene genealogies in Lacerta
lepida provide evidence for a history of isolation and
divergence in allopatry resulting in the diversification of
six genetically and geographically distinct lineages.
Although diversification within the group is largely concordant with the onset of the major glaciations at the
beginning of the Pleistocene (approximately 2 Mya), an
earlier event associated with the Miocene was also identified. This event (approximately 9 Mya), which marks
the divergence of lineages N and L, seems to be associated with geological events related to the evolution of
the Mediterranean basin. Signatures of recent demographic and spatial expansions were apparent in all phylogroups, with several phylogroups having established
zones of secondary contact. Analyses of the distribution
of ancestral and derived alleles within each phylogroup,
and inferences related to the biogeography of Lacerta
lepida, allowed the identification of probable refugia
within the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting southern refugial areas within phylogroups. Our work highlights the
importance of these areas for the long-term conservation and management of diversity with Lacerta lepida
across its geographic range.
