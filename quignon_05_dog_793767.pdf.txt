Background: Dogs and rats have a highly developed capability to detect and identify odorant
molecules, even at minute concentrations. Previous analyses have shown that the olfactory
receptors (ORs) that specifically bind odorant molecules are encoded by the largest gene family
sequenced in mammals so far.

Background

the largest known gene superfamily in the mammalian
genome, also known as the olfactory subgenome [1] - are
expressed on the surface of the cilia of the olfactory sensory
neurons lining the neuroepithelium in the nasal cavity. OR
proteins belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, which is characterized by the presence of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains. G-protein coupling

information

Olfaction is one of the senses developed by animals during the
course of evolution for communication with the external
world, making it possible to identify prey and to avoid danger.
The detection of volatile odorant molecules is a complicated
process, the first step of which involves specific binding to
specialized receptors. Olfactory receptors (ORs) - encoded by

interactions

Conclusion: We have established a complete or almost complete list of OR genes in the dog and
the rat and have compared the sequences of these genes within and between the two species. Our
results provide insight into the evolutionary development of these genes and the local
amplifications that have led to the specific amplification of many subfamilies. We have also
compared the human and rat ORs with the human and mouse OR repertoires.

refereed research

Results: We identified five amino acid patterns characteristic of ORs in the recently sequenced
boxer dog and brown Norway rat genomes. Using these patterns, we retrieved 1,094 dog genes
and 1,493 rat genes from these shotgun sequences. The retrieved sequences constitute the
olfactory receptor repertoires of these two animals. Subsets of 20.3% (for the dog) and 19.5% (for
the rat) of these genes were annotated as pseudogenes as they had one or several mutations
interrupting their open reading frames. We performed phylogenetic studies and organized these
two repertoires into classes, families and subfamilies.

facilitates the transduction of a signal from the activated
olfactory sensory neurons to olfactory glomeruli on the anterior surface of the brain. Secondary neurons then convey the
signal to the upper part of the brain for further processing and
identification of the odorant molecule. Each OR can recognize
several chemically related molecules, and a specific odorant
may bind to several ORs [2]. This combinatorial coding system has been only partly deciphered, with only about 20 or so
ligand-receptor pairs of the thousands possible decoded [213]. OR genes were first recognized by Buck and Axel [14] and
recent genome sequence data mining has led to the identification and characterization of about 650 to 900 genes in
humans [15,16] and 1,200 to 1,500 genes in mice [17-19]. The
olfactory repertoire of rat has been estimated to contain 1,700
to 2,000 genes [20], whereas that of the dog has been estimated at 1,300 genes [21,22].
We report here a more thorough inventory of the dog and rat
repertoires and a comparison between them. We also compare the sequences and genome organization of these two
repertoires and of the human and mouse repertoires, and
provide evidence for the evolution of OR repertoires by local
duplications leading to the independent expansion of some
subfamilies. This evolutionary process accounts for differences between the OR repertoires.

reflecting the fact that a 7.5 × shotgun sequence covers about
98% of the genome [26]. The lowest current estimate for the
size of the canine OR repertoire is, therefore, 1,094 genes
(1,003 + 55 + 11 + 25). We identified 27 additional sequences
corresponding, at best, to very highly pseudogenized OR
genes, which were therefore excluded from subsequent
analysis.

The rat OR gene repertoire
We screened the whole rat genome assembly (release
Rnor3.1) [20] and identified 1,493 genes as OR genes on the
basis of the order and spacing of the five characteristic amino
acid patterns. We also identified about 350 sequences that
contained only a subset of the five patterns, dispersed
throughout the genome assembly, corresponding to additional genes that might eventually be identified as true OR
genes after genome sequencing has been completed. Most of
these sequences are unlikely to be true OR gene sequences,
however, as they diverge considerably from the consensus.
They are classified as pseudogenes in GenBank, but we prefer
to reserve the term 'pseudogene' for complete genes with well
identified mutations closing the reading frame. We therefore
excluded these highly modified sequences from subsequent
analysis.

Genes and pseudogenes

Results
The dog OR gene repertoire
We searched the 35.9 million sequencing reads of the 7.5 ×
shotgun sequence [23] for five amino acid patterns characteristic of the dog OR and retrieved almost 60 thousand reads,
corresponding to a total of 40,408,752 nucleotides. We
checked the quality of each sequence read and trimmed both
extremities before assembly with Cap 3 software [24].
Sequences were assembled with great care, using dedicated
parameter settings to prevent the assembly of reads corresponding to different genes. A threshold of 97% identity over
25 nucleotides was the lowest limit at which a maximum of
false assemblies could be eliminated without too great a loss
of assembly power. With this setting, we obtained 6,727 contigs, within which we looked for the five patterns in defined
positions characteristic of the OR family. We finally identified
1,058 unique consensus sequences as OR genes.
We also independently searched CanFam1.0 [25] with the
same five amino acid patterns and retrieved 1,014 OR genes.
We compared these two sets of genes and found that 1,003
OR genes were identified by both approaches, with 55 identified by partial genome assembly only and 11 identified by
whole genome assembly only. These differences probably
reflect assembly problems that have not yet been solved,
requiring in vitro cloning experiments to obtain precise
knowledge of the dog OR repertoire. We compared this set of
genes with the 661 genes previously characterized [21] and
identified 25 genes present only in the 661 gene pool, possibly

Translation of the dog and rat gene sequences made it possible to identify pseudogenes and to determine the number of
mutations closing the open reading frame (ORF). Consistent
with earlier observations, 20.3% and 19.5% of dog and rat OR
genes, respectively, were identified as pseudogenes. A single
frame-closing mutation was detected in 78 of the 222 dog
pseudogenes with unambiguously annotated start and stop
codons; 43 of the pseudogenes had 2 such mutations, and 101
had 3. Similar results were obtained for the rat, with 153 pseudogenes having a single mutation, 48 having two mutations
and 91 having three or more mutations closing the reading
frame. Pseudogenes with more than one mutation closing the
ORF are certainly real pseudogenes. Not all pseudogenes with
a single frame-closing mutation are real pseudogenes, however, as shown by sequence polymorphism analysis [27].

Dog and rat OR gene location
We mapped 562 of the 661 dog genes identified by in vitro
and in silico cloning [21] on the radiation hybrid panel. Their
distribution closely resembled that of their human counterparts, taking into account the greater fragmentation of the
dog karyotype, with its 38 autosomes in addition to the X and
Y sex chromosomes [21]. The precise location of 902 of the
1,094 OR genes identified in this study was given in
CanFam1.0 and 61 of these genes have been attributed to a
given Canis familiaris chromosome by radiation hybrid mapping only, with 131 remaining unassigned.
We noted no conflict between previous radiation hybrid map
positions and those deduced from CanFam1.0. The newly

Phylogenetic comparison
We then used ClustalW [31] to compare the 1,009 complete
amino acid sequences for dog ORs with the 1,493 complete

Even greater variability was observed in families and subfamilies. For example, in family 6 (class II), 34% of the 134 OR
genes in dog and 41% of the 210 OR genes in rat were pseudogenes. In family 10 (class II), 13% of the 46 genes in dog and
20% of the 51 genes in rat were identified as pseudogenes (see
also Additional data file 3).
Orthologous genes are defined as genes with the same evolutionary background in different species. They are usually very
similar in sequence and they are assumed to have similar or
identical functions. Orthologous OR genes would, therefore,
be expected to bind the same ligand molecule, although this
might not always be the case [4]. To facilitate the
identification of pairs of orthologous genes in the dog and rat
repertoires and of genes belonging to the same families and

information

Twenty of these highly conserved positions are common and
correspond to the same amino acid in both repertoires. Furthermore, 15 positions in dog sequences and 21 in rat
sequences correspond to the amino acid identified in PRATT
patterns [28]. Transmembrane domains IV and V have the
highest proportions of highly variable amino acids, consistent
with the role of these domains in ligand recognition and binding [29,30].

Pseudogenes were detected in both classes and in all families
and subfamilies, but were unevenly distributed. Class I (193
and 150 genes for dog and rat, respectively) included fewer
pseudogenes (17% and 13% for dog and rat, respectively) than
class II (23% and 20% pseudogenes for dog and rat,
respectively).

interactions

With the exception of the amino-terminal position, no amino
acid position is entirely invariant. The dog repertoire was
smaller than that of the rat, and contained fewer highly conserved (≥90%) positions: 23 in dog OR proteins versus 31 in
rat OR proteins. This lower level of conservation and the
larger number of subfamilies identified in the dog repertoire
indicate that the dog has a more diverse repertoire than the
rat.

refereed research

We aligned all the dog and rat OR amino acid sequences to
determine the level of variability at each amino acid position.

color scheme used to indicate the level of identity.

Amino-acid sequence comparison

The human repertoire is the smallest of the four known mammalian repertoires and consists of the smallest number of
families, 17. Like the dog repertoire, however, it can be
divided into 300 subfamilies. The rat repertoire contained
only 282 subfamilies (Additional data file 3), despite being
the largest of the four repertoires. The large number of subfamilies in humans probably reflects the much larger number
of pseudogenes, with up to 126 subfamilies consisting entirely
of pseudogenes, rather than true diversification of this repertoire. In contrast, the larger number of subfamilies in the dog
repertoire reflects a higher level of diversification. Accordingly, the subfamilies that varied considerably in size were
smaller in dog than in rat: 1 to 31 genes for the dog and 1 to 61
genes for the rat (Additional data file 3).

reports

Similar results were obtained concerning the distribution of
the 1,493 genes and pseudogenes identified in the rat genome
(Additional data file 2). Comparison of the four known mammalian OR repertoires (human, mouse, rat and dog) showed
that regardless of differences in karyotype and repertoire size,
OR genes were distributed in very similar numbers of clusters, as defined by groups of OR separated by more than one
megabase (Table 1).

amino acid sequences for rat ORs and constructed two independent trees. Based on previously used thresholds (40% and
60% amino acid identity for distinguishing families and subfamilies, respectively), a similar pattern of organization to
that reported for the human [32] and mice [19] repertoires
was observed (Table 2).

reviews

mapped OR genes did not affect the general picture; they simply increased the size of the known clusters. The only real
change observed concerned C. familiaris chromosome 2,
which was previously considered devoid of OR genes but has
now been assigned a small cluster of two genes and two pseudogenes. Finally, pseudogenes were found in almost all clusters (Additional data file 1).

species (Additional data files 4 to 20). Figure 2a is a magnification of a region of this common tree, corresponding to dog
and rat family 2, which belongs to class II and consists of 12
dog and 12 rat subfamilies. The identification of orthologous
gene pairs such as RnOR4-13/CfOR5862 and RnOR4-12/
CfOR12C11 is straightforward; however, we frequently
observed situations in which one dog gene corresponded to

two or more rat genes (for example, dog gene CfOR0473 and
rat genes RnOR1-237, RnOR1-238), or vice versa. There are
even more complex situations in which a small group of OR
genes in one species corresponds to a group of genes in the
other species. In these cases, it is not possible to pair dog and
rat orthologous genes. An example of this situation is provided by the three dog genes CfOR0047, CfOR5963 and

We retrieved 1,493 OR genes from the most recent rat
genome sequence assembly (Rnor3.1) and 1,094 OR genes
from the 7.5 × dog shotgun sequence (sequencing traces and
CanFam1.0). The rat repertoire described here differs in size
from that reported in GenBank, mainly because we did not
take into account several hundred sequences corresponding
to very incomplete genes, with only one to three patterns,
probably corresponding to highly disabled pseudogenes.

interactions

We believe that our estimates of the numbers of genes in these
two ORs (1,493 rat OR genes and 1,094 dog OR genes) are
accurate; however, these estimates are likely to change with
time and future sequencing results.

refereed research

The identification of a string of nucleotides encoding an OR is
straightforward because all ORs are of similar length and
have the same general structure, with seven hydrophobic
transmembrane domains. They are also characterized by several amino acid patterns and an intron-less coding sequence
of 940 ± 30 base pairs. In contrast to the ease with which a
single OR can be identified, it is extremely difficult to determine the complete repertoire of OR genes in a given mammalian genome. This is due not only to the large size of the OR
repertoire, exceeding 1,000 genes, but also to the high level of
variability between OR genes, which display 34% to 99%
identity [19]. Any shotgun sequence assembly that does not
address this problem specifically is prone to errors, generating contigs with sequencing reads corresponding to very similar paralogous genes. The difficulty in assembling reads
correctly is further increased by the fact that many, if not all,
genes have two allelic variants that may differ by a large
number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) [27]. The
difficulties involved in identifying mammalian OR repertoires correctly and thoroughly are illustrated by the different
results we obtained by retrieving OR genes from CanFam1.0
and from non-assembled reads. Similar difficulties in identifying a complete OR repertoire are also evident in studies of
the mouse repertoire, which has been estimated at 1,500 [18]
and 1,200 [19] genes.

deposited research

It has been shown that OR genes from the same subfamily
tend to be clustered [15]. Only 22 dog subfamilies (134 OR
genes) and 11 rat subfamilies (168 OR genes), corresponding
to only 7% and 4% of all subfamilies, respectively, were found
on more than one chromosome. Furthermore, from the way
in which rat genes are named, it rapidly became apparent that
the order of the genes in the genome tends to respect phylogenetic order, as shown by rat subfamily 2K (Figure 2a),
which consists of 11 genes identified by digits 027 to 039. Also
rat cluster Rno5@138-139 has two parts, the first containing
the five OR genes of subfamily 2I, and the second containing
the 11 OR genes of subfamily 2K. The homologous cluster in
dog is called 15@3 and contains only four genes belonging to
subfamily 2I. One of the rat 2I subfamily members may have
undergone several rounds of duplication, leading to the creation of a specific rat 2K subfamily. Rat OR gene 5-26, from
subfamily 2I, is the fifth gene in the cluster and has the highest scores for identity to the members of the 2K subfamily. A
duplication of this gene may have created the first member of
the 2K subfamily in rat, accounting for the existence of a species-specific subfamily within a cluster. In some cases, gene
order in the genome does not respect phylogenetic order, as
for rat cluster 7@3-9 (Figure 3), which contains a mixture of
genes from different subfamilies.

Discussion

reports

Analysis of the combined tree also identified subfamilies that
had expanded in one species but not in the other, or were
present in only one of the two species. For example, subfamily
7A contained 31 genes in dog, 11 in rat, 3 in human but none
in mouse, and subfamily 2K included 11 genes in rat but was
not found in dog. This subfamily was absent in humans but
was found in mice, albeit with only three members (Figure
2b). The reverse situation was observed for subfamily 6B,
which contained nine genes in dog but was absent from the
rat, human and mouse repertoires (Figure 2c). Other examples are provided in Additional data files 4 to 20.

reviews

*From [32]. †From [19]. ‡Note that this number of families is lower than that previously published [21]. This is probably because the published
number was calculated from the alignment of the middle part of the sequences, which is more diverse, particularly for transmembrane domains TMIII
and TMIV. Nd, not determined.

Analysis 2 OR families by phylogenetic comparison
Analysis of OR families by phylogenetic comparison. OR sequences used to construct the phylogenetic trees correspond to the dog and rat sequences
retrieved in this work or taken from [15] (human) and [19] (mouse). (a) Magnification corresponding to a part of family 2, including subfamilies E to G and
I to K (general combined phylogenetic tree as provided in Additional data files 4 to 20). Circled letters identify dog and rat subfamilies. (b) Rat, dog and
mouse subfamilies 2I and 2K (the corresponding subfamilies do not exist in humans). Rat genes are in red, dog genes in blue and mouse genes in green. (c)
Subfamilies 6AL and 6B (note that subfamily 6AL is present in rat and dog repertoires but is absent from the human and mouse repertoires and that
subfamily 6B is present only in the dog repertoire). The color code is the same as in (b).

Phylogenetic analyses were used to compare OR amino acid
sequences and to organize the repertoire into classes, families
and subfamilies. This facilitated the identification of pairs of
orthologous genes and, in many cases, groups of paralogous
genes in one species orthologous to groups of paralogous
genes in the other species. Comparing the results of phylogenetic and syntenic analyses, we found that a series of local
duplications had taken place during the evolution of these
two genomes, resulting in large repertoires in both species,
but with orthologous subfamilies differing in size in the two
species and some species-specific subfamilies.
We counted the number of amino acid differences and their
frequencies at each position in the OR proteins and found

only 23 and 31 positions with a very high level of identity
(≥90%) in dog and rat, respectively. Twenty of these positions
were common to both species and were occupied by the same
amino acid. Conversely, many pairs or small groups of paralogous genes were found to encode proteins displaying up to
99% amino acid identity. As can be seen on the phylogenetic
tree, there were fewer subfamilies in rat than in dog and the
rat subfamilies were generally larger. Thus, although the rat
repertoire is much larger than the dog repertoire, it appears
to be less polymorphic. It is unclear to what extent this
observation reflects the respective sensing capacities of these
two species and the fact that many dog breeds were created to
exploit their olfactory function.

Conclusion

We selected 45 full-length canine OR genes [21] and 200 rat
OR genes from already annotated OR genes (GenBank) to
define OR-specific patterns with the PRATT program [28]

The unassembled dog 7.5 × sequence, and the 1st assembly
release (CanFam1.0) of the dog sequence and the assembled
rat genome (Rnor3.1 [20]) were screened with the five patterns identified with PRATT [28]. Screening was initially carried out with STAN (an analyzer based on suffix trees, able to
scan genomes for Prosite-type protein patterns, available on
the Pattern Matching Platform [33]). We then increased the
flexibility of recognition by translating patterns into weighted
finite automata [34], allowing arbitrary error thresholds. We
scanned for these patterns in all six translation frames, using
the Rdisk prototype architecture [35]. The boards of this
prototype contain FPGA processors, which were reconfigured
to speed up screening by one order of magnitude.
For the dog, the sequences retrieved from the non-assembled
sequences were cleaned using quality values from the NCBI
web site, as follows: extremities were shortened until the
quality value for a window of 10 nucleotides exceeded 20; and
sequences with a mean quality value below 15 were elimi-

available on the Pattern Discovery Platform [33]. Pattern recognition was based on criteria listed in Table 3. Five patterns
distributed along the length of the OR proteins were selected
for each species (Table 4).

refereed research

Determination of the sequences of several mammalian
genomes has provided an opportunity for counting and comparing the genes comprising these genomes. Such studies
have advanced studies of OR gene families, which contain
1,000 to 1,500 different genes, which it would have been
impossible to identify by direct cloning and sequencing. We
present here complete or almost complete inventories of the
dog and rat olfactory repertoires, which we compared by
constructing an integrated phylogenetic tree including all the
OR sequences. A limited number of OR-ligand pairs have
been determined, but there is strong evidence that the products of the OR genes of a given subfamily recognize molecules
of similar shape or chemical function. The smaller number of
subfamilies identified in the rat repertoire is intriguing and
raises questions concerning possible species-specific differences in sensing capacities and the role of dog breeding in
enhancing olfactory function.

nated [23]. The resulting processed sequences were assembled with Cap3 software [24] using the following criteria:
minimum overlap of 25 nucleotides and identity values of
97% required to prevent illegitimate assembly. A consensus
sequence was established for each contig.

The names of the rat OR sequences refer to their chromosomal location, for example, gene RnOR1-061 is the 61st OR
gene present on rat chromosome 1, counting from the end of
one telomere.

Characterization of OR genes

Additional data files

All retrieved sequences were further analyzed by searching
for the five patterns at specific locations. Each consensus OR
gene sequence was then translated with the 'Traduction Multiple' program available from the Infobiogen web site [36]. If
more than one ORF was possible, as for pseudogenes resulting from insertions or deletions, we used the BlastX program
[37,38] to determine the limits of each partial ORF and manually reconstructed the OR protein sequence. The dog and rat
OR sequences have been submitted to GenBank and are
accessible from the authors' website [39].

Classification
Complete OR protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW
software [31] and classes, families and subfamilies defined as
previously described [40-42]. Trees were constructed with
TreeView [43] and the dog ADRB3 gene as the outgroup.

Genome localization
We localized canine OR genes precisely within the genome by
carrying out Blast analysis against CanFam1.0. The coordinates of rat OR genes were taken from the draft genome
sequence Rnor3.1.

OR gene nomenclatures
Canine OR gene sequences are named 'CfORxxxx' for C.
familiaris olfactory receptor.

The following additional data are available with the online
version of this paper (and also at the authors' web site [39]).
