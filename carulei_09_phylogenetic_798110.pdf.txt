Abstract
Phylogenetic analysis of three genes of Penguinpox virus, a novel Avipoxvirus isolated from African
penguins, reveals its relationship to other poxviruses. The genes corresponding to Vaccinia virus
G8R (VLTF-1), A3L (P4b) and H3L were sequenced and phylogenetic trees (Neighbour-Joining and
UPGMA) constructed from MUSCLE nucleotide and amino acid alignments of the equivalent
sequences from several different poxviruses. Based on this analysis, PEPV was confirmed to belong
to the genus Avipoxvirus, specifically, clade A, subclade A2 and to be most closely related to
Turkeypox virus (TKPV), Ostrichpox virus (OSPV)and Pigeonpox virus (PGPV).

Background
Interest in the avipoxviruses, notably Fowlpox virus
(FWPV) and Canarypox virus (CNPV) has increased due to
their successful use as vaccines on commercial flocks and
their extensive use and testing as vaccine vectors [1-8]. The
genomes of both FWPV and CNPV have been sequenced
and comparison reveals a high level of divergence with
significant differences between orthologous ORFs and the
terminal, variable genomic regions [9,10]. Analysis of the
thymidine kinase gene showed only 64% amino acid
identity between FWPV and CNPV compared to 97%
amino acid identity amongst the orthopoxviruses and
84% within the Leporipoxvirus genus [11]. This level of
divergence is commonly seen between different Chordopoxvirus genera suggesting that the species within the
Avipoxvirus genus are highly divergent. A novel avipoxvi-

rus, Penguinpox virus (PEPV) was isolated from an African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) that was brought into
the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of
Coastal Birds (SANCCOB) [12]. Lesions around the eyes,
typical of avipoxvirus infection were noted and scrapings
were taken. Virus was cultured from these scrapings and
histological studies and restriction enzyme profile comparison to other known avipoxviruses, namely FWPV,
CNPV, Turkeypox virus (TKPV) and Quailpox virus, confirmed that it was indeed a novel avipoxvirus [12]. Infectivity studies of different mammalian cell lines (CV-1,
Vero, MDBK, RK-13, HeLa and HEF) and chick embryo
fibroblasts (CEFs) showed that early stages of virus replication were supported, but no infectious progeny virus
could be recovered [13]. It is currently unclear as to why
PEPV cannot be successfully passaged in CEFs as CEFs

have been shown to support replication of both FWPV
and CNPV viruses. Also reported was the fact that PEPV
transcriptases could recognize the Vaccinia virus (VACV)
derived late promoter P11 linked to the β-galactosidase
reporter gene, resulting in transient gene expression.

Results and discussion
One highly conserved gene, VLTF-1 (VACV G8R; fpv126
locus), was chosen for analysis in order to position PEPV
in the larger chordopoxvirus group. Two additional genes,
which are less highly conserved (P4b (VACV A3L; fpv167
locus) and the virion envelope protein p35 (VACV H3L;
fpv140 locus)) were selected for analysis in order to determine the relationship of PEPV to other avipoxviruses previously analysed at these loci [14]. The analysis involved
MUSCLE [15] amino acid and nucleotide alignments and
construction of UPGMA and Neighbour-Joining [16] phylogenetic trees based on these alignments.

The VLTF-1 gene encodes a late transcription factor, which
is highly conserved amongst all poxviruses and is the most
conserved protein between FWPV and CNPV with 95%
amino acid identity [10]. The nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of 18 poxviruses representing all eight Chordopoxvirus genera were analysed at this locus. The overall
tree topologies are as previously reported [17] and this
analysis shows PEPV to belong to the Avipoxvirus genus,
grouping with FWPV, in a separate clade from CNPV, with
strong bootstrap support in both UPGMA and N-J trees
(N-J tree shown below in Figure 1). PEPV showed 96%
amino acid identity to FWPV and 92% identity to CNPV.
The nucleotide identity was lower with 92% identity to
FWPV and 84% identity to CNPV. Divergence is therefore
more easily detected in the nucleotide sequences due to
the increased number of changes and nucleotide
sequences were therefore used for analysis of the P4b and
envelope protein, p35 genes.
The P4b gene encodes a 75.2 kDa virion core protein,
which is highly conserved amongst all poxviruses [18]
and this locus has been used previously in phylogenetic
studies of avipoxviruses [14,19-21] to differentiate
between major clades A, B and C as well as minor clades
A1, A2, A3, A4, B1 and B2. Figure 2 shows an N-J tree
based on a MUSCLE nucleotide alignment of partial
sequences (truncated to 450 nt to ensure that all
sequences were of equal length) of P4b orthologues from
37 avipoxvirus isolates from 17 different species of bird.
This tree gives better resolution of the Avipoxvirus genus
and shows PEPV to belong to the FWPV-like group of
viruses (clade A) as opposed to the CNPV-like group of
viruses (clade B) or the Psittacine viruses (clade C) in both
N-J and UPGMA trees. FWPV and CNPV orthologues
showed an average of 75% nucleotide identity to each
other for the various isolates at this locus. PEPV showed

an average of 90% nucleotide identity to the various
FWPV isolates and 74% identity to the various CNPV isolates. PEPV was found to belong to subclade A2 with 98%
similarity to Falconpox virus (FLPV) and Albatrosspox
virus (ABPV), and 100% homology to both the TKPV isolates (TKPV66 and TKPV98), the Ostrichpox virus (OSPV)
isolate and two of the Pigeonpox virus (PGPV) isolates
(PGPVTP2 and PGPVP).
Figure 3 shows an N-J tree based on the MUSCLE nucleotide alignment of orthologues of the envelope protein
p35, which is an immunodominant antigen. PEPV was
found to cluster with the TKPV isolates with strong bootstrap support while the pigeon isolate PGPVP clustered
with the isolates from albatross and falcon in both N-J
and UPGMA trees. PEPV was found to have 99% nucleotide identity with both TKPV isolates in subclade A2,
compared to 95% identity with ABPV and FLPV and 94%
with PGPVP.
Taken together these analyses confirm that PEPV belongs
to the genus Avipoxvirus, and go on to show that PEPV

belongs to subclade A2 with the highest degree of similarity to TKPV isolates 98 and 66. Because there was no OSPV
sequence available for the envelope protein p35 we can
only speculate that PEPV and OSPV are highly similar
based on the degree of similarity at the P4b gene. Previous
work has shown that OSPV, TKPV and FWPV are genetically, antigenically and biologically related. Ostrich chicks
housed in an enclosure that had previously housed pox
infected turkeys became infected with a poxvirus and
immunisation of susceptible chickens with this poxvirus
protected them from FWPV challenge [22]. OSPV isolated
from ostriches in Israel was found to produce productive
infection in turkeys and furthermore, ostrich chicks in
both Israel and South Africa could be protected by immunisation with FWPV vaccine [23,24]. The host range of
TKPV has been reported to include both ostrich and Humboldt penguin (a close relative of the African penguin),

though this is unconfirmed [25]. Analysis of a PEPV IL-10
like protein (data not shown) shows this protein to be
most closely related to turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and
chicken (Gallus gallus) IL-10, with 27% amino acid identity followed by the IL-10 like protein found in CNPV with
26% amino acid identity. The CNPV IL-10-like protein
showed only 20% identity to the proteins from chicken
and turkey. PEPV infection is evident in juvenile African
penguins especially in the summer months when the penguins spend the majority of their time on land (moulting
and/or nesting) and there are large numbers of mosquitoes present, which act as mechanical vectors to transmit
virus (personal communication Dr. Nola Parsons, SANCCOB). Further research is underway to determine whether
outbreaks in different avian species are caused by the same
virus or by different but closely related viral species.

Materials and methods
PEPV was grown on the chorioallantoic membranes of
embryonated hens' eggs as described previously [13] to
produce a viral stock from which DNA was extracted. Viral
DNA was extracted by conventional methods as described
previously [12] with the following modifications to the
lysis buffer: 10% N-lauryl sarcosinate, 50 mM Tris pH7.8,
200 mM β-mercaptoethanol and no SDS. The PEPV
genomic DNA was sequenced using the Roche/454 GSFLX system and all bioinformatics analysis was performed
using the CLC Bio Main Workbench.
