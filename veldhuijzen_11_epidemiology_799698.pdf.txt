Abstract
Background: The prevalence, incidence and persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in sub-Saharan
Africa are not well established. The objectives of the current study are to describe (predictors of) the epidemiology
of HPV among high-risk women in Kigali, Rwanda.
Methods: HIV-negative, high-risk women were seen quarterly for one year, and once in Year 2. HIV serostatus,
clinical, and behavioral information were assessed at each visit, HPV types at Month 6 and Year 2, and other
sexually transmitted infections (STI) at selected visits. HPV prevalence was also assessed in HIV-positive, high-risk
women.
Results: Prevalence of any HPV was 47.0% in HIV-negative women (median age 25 years) compared to 72.2% in
HIV-positive women (median age 27 years; OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.9-4.6). Among HIV-negative women, cumulative
incidence of high-risk (HR)-HPV was 28.0% and persistence 32.0% after a mean period of 16.6 and 16.9 months,
respectively. Prior Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, concurrent low-risk (LR)-HPV infection
and incident HSV-2 were associated with HR-HPV prevalence among HIV-negative women; prior C. trachomatis
infection and co-infection with LR-HPV and HPV16-related HPV types with HR-HPV acquisition. HPV16-related types
were the most prevalent and persistent.
Conclusions: High HPV prevalence, incidence and persistence were found among high-risk women in Kigali.
HPV52 had the highest incidence; and, together with HPV33 and HPV58, were strongly associated with acquisition
of other HR-HPV types in HIV-negative women.

Background
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common
sexually transmitted infection (STIs) worldwide [1]. Prevalence is highest among sexually active women below
25-35 years, usually declining thereafter [2,3]. Worldwide age-adjusted HPV prevalence in women with normal cytology is estimated at 12%, ranging from 5% in
Northern America to 34% in East Africa% [3]. Age and
high-risk sexual behavior (such as high life-time number
of sex partners and recent acquisition of a new sex

partner) are well-recognized risk factors for acquiring
HPV. Moreover, higher HPV prevalence rates have been
documented among women at high risk for other STIs
and among HIV-positive women [4,5]. Most infections
are cleared within two years but a minority of infections
becomes persistent [6]. Persistent infection with highrisk (HR), oncogenic HPV genotypes is causally associated with the development of cervical cancer, the most
common malignancy among women in Sub-Saharan
Africa [7].
An increasing number of articles report on the typespecific HPV prevalence among women in Sub-Saharan
Africa, but incidence and persistence data remain scarce.

persistence, are best studied in prospectively collected
data. This information will aid in the design of primary
or secondary prevention programs.
As part of secondary data-analysis of an HIV incidence study, we evaluated HPV prevalence, incidence,
persistence, and their predictors, among HIV-negative
high-risk women in Kigali, Rwanda. In addition, HPV
prevalence was assessed among HIV-positive high-risk
women cross-sectionally.

Methods
Study population

A cross-sectional HIV prevalence survey was conducted
among high-risk women in Kigali, Rwanda. Subsequently, women testing HIV-negative during the survey,
and who were 18 years or older, at high risk for HIV
(defined as having exchanged sex for money at least
once in the last month and/or currently having sex with
multiple partners plus having sex at least twice per
week) and were not pregnant at enrolment or planning
a pregnancy within the next year were invited to participate in a prospective cohort study to assess HIV incidence (2006-2009) [8].
The target sample size for the HIV-negative cohort
was 400 and this was based on the primary HIV incidence objective. HPV prevalence, incidence and persistence were among secondary objectives of the study.
Enrolled women were followed quarterly for one year,
and were invited for one additional visit during year 2
("Year 2 visit”).
Women testing HIV-positive during the survey were
excluded from cohort participation, but were invited for
one additional study visit during year 2 ("Year 2 visit”)
during which HPV prevalence was assessed.
Women were recruited via community meetings in
three districts in Kigali. Written informed consent was
obtained, including parental or guardian consent for
women who were 18-20 years old. The study was conducted at Projet Ubuzima, an international non-governmental organization that operates a research clinic and
laboratory, in Kigali, Rwanda.
Study procedures for HIV-negative participants

HIV-negative participants were tested for HIV at every
study visit, for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Trichomonas vaginalis, and
bacterial vaginosis (BV) at enrolment, Month 6, and
Month 12, and for BV also in Year 2. HPV typing and cervical cytology were done at Month 6 and Year 2. HSV-2
serology testing was performed at enrolment, at Month 12
for women testing negative at enrolment, and in Year 2
for women testing negative at Month 12. Standardized
questionnaires were administered at each study visit.

Study procedures for HIV-positive participants

HIV-positive women participating in the Year 2 visit followed the same study procedures as described for the
Year 2 visit of the HIV-negative cohort participants.
Women with abnormal cytology results were referred
for visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and colposcopy by a gynecologist, and were offered appropriate
treatment. Women with curable STIs received treatment
and were offered partner notification and treatment.
HIV-positive women were referred to HIV care. As part
of the study procedures women received HIV prevention, safer sex and family planning counseling at each
visit.
Human papillomavirus typing

HPV genotyping was performed at the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM, Antwerp, Belgium) using the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test (LA) (Roche Molecular
Systems, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, cervical cells collected in Liquid Based Cytology
media PreservCyt were stored at -80°C until testing. An
aliquot of 250 μl was used for DNA extraction by
AmpliLute Liquid Media Extraction Kit (Roche Molecular Systems, USA). HPV genotype targets were amplified
using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). LA
applies PGMY09/11 L1 as consensus primer system and
co-amplifies human b-globulin as a cellular, extraction
and inhibition control. Reverse line blot hybridization
and detection identifies 37 high- and low-risk HPV
types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 53,
54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66 to 73, 81, 82 subtype
IS39, 82, 83, 84, CP108 and a mixed probe for types 33/
35/52/58). An in-house Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was
established at the ITM to identify DNA of HPV genotype 52 in the mixed probe positive samples. Briefly,
DNA was prepared using the NucliSens miniMAG (BioMιrieux, Boxtel, the Netherlands). DNA templates were
amplified in a qualitative RT-PCR assay. HPV52-F/R
and hydrolysis probe HPV52 labeled at the 5’ with FAM
and at the 3’ with BHQ-1 (Eurogentec, Belgium) were
used for amplification and detection [9]. Amplification
was performed using the Absolute Blue QPCR mix kit
(Thermo Scientific, UK), 500 nm of each primer and
probe, and 10 μL of DNA template, in a final reaction
volume of 30 μL. The RT-PCR was performed on the
Rotor-Gene™ 6000 platform (Corbett Life Science,
USA) using the following thermal cycling conditions:
initial enzyme activation at 95°C for 15 min; followed by
60 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 58°C for 45 sec, and 65°C
for 45 sec. Detection of the fluorescence signal was
recorded using the setting for hydrolysis probes (470
nm, 510 nm) following the extension phase cycle by
cycle.

Other laboratory testing

HIV testing was done at Projet Ubuzima according to
the national testing guidelines, with two positive rapid
tests indicating an HIV diagnosis (First Response, Premier Medical Corporation, Daman, India; and Uni-Gold
HIV, Trinity Biotech Plc, Ireland), and a third rapid test
(Capillus, Trinidity Biotech Plc, Ireland) as tiebreaker.
Positive results were confirmed with Murex HIV Ag/Ab
Combination ELISA (Abbott Laboratories, Germany).
CD4 cytometry was performed at the National Reference
Laboratory in Kigali.
InPouch culture (Biomed Diagnostics, USA) was used
for T. vaginalis diagnosis. Syphilis was diagnosed using
RPR (Spinreact, Spain) and TPHA (Spinreact, Spain).
HerpeSelect-2 ELISA (Focus Technologies, USA) was
used for HSV-2 antibody testing. Optical density ≥ 3.5
were considered positive for HSV-2, and OD ≤ 1.1 negative. All tests were performed at Projet Ubuzima. Dry
swabs (BD Culturette™ EZ Collection), stored at -80°C
were used for Amplicor NG/CT PCR (Roche Molecular
Systems, USA) for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis
testing at ITM. Positive results were confirmed with a
strand displacement amplification assay (Probetec, Becton Dickinson, USA). External quality control for STI
testing at Projet Ubuzima was coordinated by ITM. BV
was diagnosed by Gram stain Nugent score. Nugent
scoring was performed at Projet Ubuzima; at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam,
Department of Medical Microbiology; and at the
Amsterdam Municipal Health Service, Public Health
Laboratory. Conventional cytology was performed at
Ghent University Hospital, Belgium, using the Bethesda
system for classification [10].
Statistical analysis

Data were double-entered, and analyzed using STATA
9.2 (StatCorp, TX, USA). Baseline characteristics were
estimated as percentages with 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for binary and categorical variables; median and
interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed
continuous variables or mean and standard deviations
for normally distributed continuous variables.
HPV classification

In these analyses, HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,
56, 58, 59, 68, 73, 82 and IS39 were considered HRHPV types [11-13]. All other types were considered LRHPV. HPV16-related types included HPV16, 31, 33, 35,
52, and 58. ‘Any HPV’ included HR and/or LR-HPV.
HPV prevalence

HR-HPV prevalence was estimated from the first HPV
results in both HIV-negative (Month 6) and HIV-positive women (Year 2). Multivariable logistic regression
models for predictors of HR or LR-HPV detection in

Page 3 of 14

HIV-positive and HIV-negative women were fitted using
manual backward modeling. Variables associated with
the outcome with a P-value < 0.10 in univariable models
were included in the initial multivariable logistic regression model. Variables were retained in the model based
upon Wald statistics (P < 0.05) and/or likelihood ratio
tests for the overall fit of the model (P < 0.1). Age was
included as a covariate in all models. Pair-wise correlations between the variables in the final models were
investigated, and correlated variables were assessed for
interaction. The comparison group for HR-HPV analysis
included women without HR-HPV, irrespective of LRHPV detection. Concurrent LR-HPV was included as a
covariate. Similarly, the comparison group in LR-HPV
analysis included women without LR-HPV, irrespective
of HR-HPV, but concurrent HR-HPV was included as a
covariate. Age-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals (C.I.) were calculated comparing HPV prevalence among HIV-positive (n = 349) and HIV-negative
women (n = 126). Women with abnormal cytology
results (HIV-negative women n = 16; HIV positive
women n = 14) were excluded.
HPV incidence (HIV-negative women)

Type-specific HR-HPV incidence was defined as newly
detected type-specific HR-HPV at the second HPV measurement (Year 2) among women free of the type of
interest at the first HPV measurement (Month 6). The
(cumulative) incidence was calculated over the mean
interval between Month 6 and Year 2 visit. All incident
type-specific HR-HPV cases were grouped together into
one binary incident HR-HPV outcome variable, with
women without incident HR-HPV as the referent group
(regardless of presence of other prevalent HR-HPV
types or prevalent or incident LR-HPV). The association
between prevalent HR-HPV types and incidence of
other HR-HPV types was assessed. First, univariable
associations between each type-specific HR-HPV at
Month 6 and subsequent acquisition of other HR-HPV
types were evaluated. To increase statistical power, types
were then grouped according to their phylogenetic
group and within group according to strength of the
association (0.1 >P < 0.1). These groups were included
in the final incidence model. Sensitivity analyses were
performed excluding women with any prevalent HRHPV and/or LR-HPV at Month 6 from the reference
group. These results are not shown because they were
similar to those of the incidence model as described
above. Of the 349 HIV-negative women with normal
cytology results and HPV results at Month 6, 296
women also had HPV results at Year 2 visit and contributed to the incidence analyses. Methods for multivariable logistic regression modeling were identical to those
for HPV prevalence.

HPV persistence (HIV-negative women)

HR-HPV persistence was defined as women who tested
positive for the same HR-HPV type at both visits during
which HPV typing was performed (Month 6 and Year
2). Persistence was calculated over the mean interval
between these two visits. All persistent type-specific HRHPV cases were grouped into one binary persistent HRHPV outcome variable, irrespective of LR-HPV. The
reference group included women who cleared all HRHPV infections at the second visit that were present at
the first visit, but who may however tested positive for
new HPV types at the second HPV measurement. Of
the 111 HR-HPV positive women with normal cytology
at Month 6, 90 women also had HPV results at Year 2
visit and contributed to the persistence analyses. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was conducted as
described for HPV prevalence above.
Ethical approvals were obtained from the National
Ethics Committee and the National AIDS Control Commission (CNLS) in Rwanda; the Institutional Review
Board of Columbia University Medical Center, New
York, USA; and the Medical Ethics Committee of the
University of Antwerp, Belgium.

Results
Study population characteristics

Eight hundred women participated in the HIV prevalence survey between October 2006 and August 2007
and 192 women tested HIV-positive. Four hundred
three (403) HIV-negative, non-pregnant women were
enrolled in the cohort. The flow-diagram of the study is
given in Figure 1. All women, except one, self-identified
as female sex worker (FSW). Median age at survey was
25 (IQR 22-28) for HIV-negative women and 27 (IQR
23-32) for HIV-positive women. Among HIV-negative
cohort participants, prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae was
10% (CI 7.3-13.6), C. trachomatis 5% (CI 2.7-7.2), T.
vaginalis 17% (CI 13.4-21.2), syphilis 7% (CI 4.7-10.1),
and BV 45% (CI 39.4-49.9).
Type-specific HPV prevalence in HIV-negative and HIVpositive women

Among 349 HIV-negative women with no cervical
abnormalities, the HPV prevalence at the first HPV
measurement visit (Month 6) was 47.0% for any HPV,
31.8% for HR-HPV and 32.4% for LR-HPV. The five
most prevalent HR-HPV types among HIV-negative
women were HPV16 (5.4%), HPV45 (4.9%), and HPV52
(4.3%) HPV58 (4.0%) and HPV68 (3.7%) (Figure 2).
Infection with multiple HR-HPV types was present in
11.7% of HR-HPV positive/HIV-negative women.
A total of 126 HIV-positive women were tested for
HPV at the Year 2 visit, had valid HPV results, and did
not have cervical abnormalities. HPV prevalence among

Page 4 of 14

these women was 72.2% for any HPV, 50.8% for HRHPV and 54.8% for LR-HPV. HIV-positive compared to
HIV-negative women were 2.9 times (CI 1.9-4.6) more
likely to have any HPV detected; 2.2 times (CI 1.5-3.4)
HR-HPV and 2.5 times (CI 1.7-3.9) LR-HPV. The five
most prevalent HR-HPV types among HIV-positive
women were HPV52 (13.9%), HPV58 (11.1%), HPV51
(11.1%), HPV16, HPV 45 and HPV35 (each 7.9%). Multiple HR-HPV types were detected in 29.4% of HR-HPV
positive/HIV-positive women.
Correlates of prevalent high- and low-risk HPV in HIVnegative women

In univariable analysis, the odds of prevalent HR-HPV at
Month 6 were significantly lower among older, higher
educated, widowed/divorced, and multiparous (≥ 3 pregnancies) women (Table 1). The odds were significantly
higher among women with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection at baseline or among women with concurrent BV or LR-HPV infection. Women experiencing
incident HSV-2 infection at Month 6 and women using
hormonal contraceptices for longer than 6 months were
also more likely to have HR-HPV detected at Month 6
(P < 0.05). Sexual behavior indicators (number of clients,
number of vaginal sex acts, condom use, age at sexual
debut, years as FSW) were not associated with HR-HPV
prevalence among this highly sexually active population.
In multivariable analysis, being single, having N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection at baseline, concurrent LR-HPV infection, and incident HSV-2 infection
remained independent predictors of HR-HPV prevalence
among HIV-negative women (Table 1).
In univariable analysis, LR-HPV was negatively associated with older age (P < 0.05) (data not shown). Hormonal contraceptive use for longer than 6 months and
co-infection with HR-HPV were positively associated
with LR-HPV (P < 0.05). Age, and concurrent HR-HPV
remained independently associated with LR-HPV in
multivariable analysis, and there was a trend in that
direction for hormonal contraceptive use for longer than
6 months (P = 0.059; data not shown).
Correlates of prevalent high- and low-risk HPV in HIVpositive women

Among the 126 HIV-positive women with no cervical
abnormalities who attended the Year 2 visit and had
HPV results, prevalent HR-HPV was associated with
concurrent LR-HPV infection in uni- and multivariable
models (Table 1) There was some evidence of an
increased risk of HR-HPV detection among women
never/inconsistently using condoms, although this did
not reach statistical significance in multivariable model.
Other exposure indicators, CD4 count, use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and the interaction

HR-HPV detection.
HR-HPV incidence among HIV-negative women

Of the 296 women who contributed to the HPV incidence analyses, incident HR-HPV types were detected in
28.0% (95% CI 23.0-33.1) after a mean interval of 16.6
months (SD 1.8). The mean duration between the two
HPV measurements was not significantly associated
with acquisition of type-specific HR-HPV (data not
shown). Among HR-HPV positive women at Month 6,
34.4% acquired a new HR-HPV type by Year 2, compared to 24.8% among women who were HR-HPV negative at Month 6 (P = 0.087). Cumulative HR-HPV
incidence was 39.2% among LR-HPV positive women at
Month 6 compared to 22.1% among LR-HPV negative
women (P = 0.002).
HPV52 incidence was highest among the HIV-negative
high-risk women (Table 2). Women above the age of 30
were less likely to acquire HR-HPV types (Table 3). LRHPV and HR-HPV types 33 and/or 52 and/or 58 at
Month 6,C. trachomatis infection at Month 12, the preceding visit to the second HPV measurement, and concurrent LR-HPV were associated with increased risk of
HR-HPV acquisition. Furthermore, women who worked
continuously throughout follow-up as a FSW were at
increased risk for HR-HPV acquisition. Infection with

HPV16-related HPV types 33, 52 and 58 at Month 6, C.
trachomatis infection at Month 12, concurrent LR-HPV
and self-reported sex work remained independent predictors of HR-HPV incidence in multivariable analysis.
HR-HPV persistence

Ninety HIV-negative women without cervical abnormalities contributed to the HR-HPV persistence analysis. Of
them, 32.0% had persistent HR-HPV at Year 2 after a
mean interval of 16.9 months (SD 1.7). Mean duration
between the two HPV measurements was not associated
with clearance or persistence. Persistence was most
common for HPV31 and 68 (data not shown). In univariable analyses, only BV at Month 12 was associated
with a decreased likelihood of persistent HR-HPV infection (Table 3).

Discussion
We found high prevalence rates of HR-HPV (50.8% and
31.8%) and LR-HPV (54.8% and 32.4%) in HIV-positive
and HIV-negative high-risk Rwandan women, respectively. This is considerably higher than the prevalence
rates that we found in women from the general population in Kigali, Rwanda (HR-HPV 19.9%; LR-HPV 20.5%;
unpublished data Veldhuijzen et al [14]). Our results are
in line with results from another study among HIVpositive women in Kigali that reported a HR-HPV

prevalence of 46% [15], as well as studies in other
regions that reported HR-HPV prevalence rates ranging
from 30-46% in HIV-negative sex workers and 44-73%
in HIV-positive sex workers [15-17]. In general,
increased HPV prevalence among HIV-positive women
can be attributed to increased susceptibility, decreased
ability to clear infection and frequent reactivation of
latent infection associated with immunosuppression
[18].
Very few prospective studies on HPV epidemiology
have been conducted in Africa. We found a cumulative
HR-HPV incidence of 28% and persistence of 32% over
a mean interval of 17 months, in HIV-negative high-risk
women. In comparison, HR-HPV incidence among a
rural Ugandan population was estimated at 7.0 per 100
PY among HIV-negative and 17.3 per 100 PY among
HIV-positive women; 66% of these infections were
cleared by HIV-negative women compared to 40% by
HIV-positive women [19]. HR-HPV incidence among
HIV-negative women in Zimbabwe was estimated at
11% and persistence at 37% after 12 months of followup [20]. Compared to the other two studies, our study
population had higher risk for STIs, including HPV,
because of their sexual risk behavior.

HPV52 had the highest incidence rate, the presence of
infection by HPV52, 58, and 33 combined at Month 6
was strongly associated with increased acquisition of
other HR-HPV types in Year 2. In a previous analysis of
the same cohort, the presence of HR-HPV at Month 6
was strongly associated with HIV acquisition, and
HPV52 was the most frequent HR-HPV type detected in
HIV seroconverters [21]. Infection with multiple HRHPV types was more common among HIV-positive
compared to HIV-negative women. Other studies have
also found higher rates of (non-16/18) HR-HPV types in
HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative women, as well
as higher rates of infections with multiple types
[4,17,22-25].
In our study, prior C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae
infection were associated with HR-HPV prevalence in
HIV-negative women, and prior C. trachomatis infection
with HR-HPV incidence. The literature is mixed, with
some studies finding associations between C. trachomatis and HR-HPV [26,27], and others not [28]. The biological interactions between C. trachomatis infection and
HPV infection are not yet fully understood [29,30].

facilitate (re) uptake of HPV and/or impede clearance
[27,30]. Most women in our study had either received
treatment or spontaneously cleared the C. trachomatis
infection by the next visit. Active epithelial regeneration
following infection might increase the susceptibility of
target cells to HPV. Conversely, insufficient Th1 cells
responses (which are required for resolving C. trachomatis infection and clearing HPV) may promote persistent C. trachomatis and persistent HPV infection
[31-33]. As the majority of C. trachomatis infections in
our population were treated or cleared, we were not
able to establish an association between persistent C.
trachomatis infection and HPV persistence. We also did
not find an association between BV and any or HRHPV, as has been found in other studies [34,35]. Sexual
behavior indicators (number of clients, number of vaginal sex acts, condom use, age at sexual debut, years as
FSW) were not associated with HR-HPV prevalence
among this highly sexually active population.
There is no consistent definition of HPV persistence
in the scientific literature, with some published studies
using a duration of 6-12 months, and others using a
duration of longer than 12 months [36]. The mean
interval between the two HPV measurements in our
study was approximately 17 months. With this long
duration, the extent of persistence may have been
overestimated because we cannot exclude re-activation
or re-infection after clearance of the initial infection.
In addition, left censoring, by using prevalent HPV
infections, may have further inflated our persistence
results because long-term infections are often overrepresented among prevalent cases. In contrast, the
incidence rate may have been underestimated because
some women may have acquired new infections but
cleared them before the second HPV test was performed. Furthermore, our type-specific prevalence and
incidence rates are imprecise due to small sample
sizes.

Conclusion
In conclusion, high HPV prevalence, incidence and persistence rates were found in this study among high-risk
women in Kigali. HPV52 had the highest incidence; and,
together with HPV33 and HPV58, was strongly associated with acquisition of other HR-HPV types in HIVnegative women. HPV52 and 58 were also the most prevalent in HIV-positive women and, as previously shown,
in HIV seroconverters. In addition, prior C. trachomatis
was associated with HR-HPV incidence.
Women at high-risk for sexually transmitted infections
(including HIV) experience a higher incidence and prevalence of HPV infections, including infections with
high-risk HPV types. Therefore these women are at
greater risk for developing cervical cancer. Cervical

cancer prevention programs should incorporate strategies to ensure a high coverage among these high-risk
women.
