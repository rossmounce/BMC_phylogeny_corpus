Characterisation of the Vitis vinifera PR10
multigene family
Sylvain Lebel, Paul Schellenbaum, Bernard Walter, Pascale Maillot*

Abstract
Background: Genes belonging to the pathogenesis related 10 (PR10) group have been studied in several plant
species, where they form multigene families. Until now, such an analysis has not been performed in Vitis vinifera,
although three different PR10 genes were found to be expressed under pathogen attack or abiotic stress, and
during somatic embryogenesis induction. We used the complete genome sequence for characterising the whole
V. vinifera PR10 gene family. The expression of candidate genes was studied in various non-treated tissues and
following somatic embryogenesis induction by the auxin 2,4-D.
Results: In addition to the three V. vinifera PR10 genes already described, namely VvPR10.1, VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3,
fourteen different PR10 related sequences were identified. Showing high similarity, they form a single cluster on
the chromosome 5 comprising three pseudogenes. The expression of nine different genes was detected in various
tissues. Although differentially expressed in non-treated plant organs, several genes were up-regulated in tissues
treated with 2,4-D, as expected for PR genes.
Conclusions: PR10 genes form a multigene family in V. vinifera, as found in birch, apple or peach. Seventeen
closely related PR10 sequences are arranged in a tandem array on the chromosome 5, probably reflecting smallscale duplications during evolution. Various expression patterns were found for nine studied genes, highlighting
functional diversification. A phylogenetic comparison of deduced proteins with PR10 proteins of other plants
showed a characteristic low intraspecific variability. Particularly, a group of seven close tandem duplicates including
VvPR10.1, VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3 showed a very high similarity, suggesting concerted evolution or/and recent
duplications.

Background
PR10 proteins belong to the huge family of pathogenesis
related (PR) proteins ubiquitous in the plant kingdom.
PR proteins were first identified as defence molecules
produced in response to pathogen attack and some of
them actually display an antimicrobial activity. However,
numerous studies have reported their induction under a
great variety of abiotic stress conditions as well as possible constitutive or developmentally regulated expression
[1]. Sharing common biochemical characteristics (acidic
pI, resistance to proteolytic degradation, small molecular
mass) PR proteins are divided into seventeen different
groups based on their primary structure, serological
relationships and biological activity [2]. Most of them

are extracellular, but some others are found in the cytoplasm, mainly in the vacuole. PR10 proteins present the
specificity to be free in the cytoplasm and are therefore
classified as intracellular PR (IPR) proteins. They are
closely related to a group of major tree pollen allergens
and food allergens, that belong to the Bet v 1-like superfamily [3].
PR10 genes form multigene families with low intraspecific variation and higher interspecific variation that
make them interesting phylogenetic markers [4-6]. Some
of them were shown to be organized in chromosome
clusters [7,8]. Characterised in a number of plant species, most PR10 genes share an open reading frame
(ORF) from 456 to 489 bp interrupted by an intron of
76-359 bp at a highly conserved position [9]. This ORF
codes for an acidic small protein with conserved
sequence features: three amino acids E96, E148 and
Y150 (as positioned in Bet v 1) possibly involved in

ribonucleasic activity and two other remarkable domains
comprising the motif GXGGXGXXK (aa 47-55) that
forms a P-loop supposed to have NTPase activity and
the Bet v 1 motif [PS00451] characteristic of proteins
from the Bet v 1 superfamily [9].
The significance of multiple close copies of a gene in a
single plant species has to be clarified. In birch or yellow
lupine, some PR10 genes are constitutively expressed
while others are induced under pathogen attack, abiotic
stress or during plant development, suggesting functional diversification [10,11]. A significant common feature of PR10 proteins is a large Y-shaped hydrophobic
cavity, as shown by the determination of three-dimensional structure [3,12-15]. This internal cavity could be
responsible for the intracellular transport of apolar
ligands, so diverse as fatty acids, flavonoids, cytokinins
or brassinosteroids [10,14,16,17]. Slight modifications of
the structure and shape of this cavity would allow to
bind different ligands, what could account for the
diverse roles hypothesised for PR10 proteins in plant
defence and development [12,13].
To date, three different PR10 genes have been
described in Vitis vinifera. VvPR10.1 was shown to be
up-regulated during a pathogen interaction with Pseudomonas syringae in the cultivar Ugni blanc [18], while the
expression of VvPR10.1, VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3 was
detected during somatic embryogenesis (SE) induction
in the cultivar Chardonnay [19]. Moreover, several studies showed a strong and specific production of PR10
proteins in V. vinifera under salt or herbicide stress
[20,21], as well as after fungal attack [22,23].
The recent publication of the whole genome sequence
of V. vinifera by the Genoscope [24] and the Instituto
Agrario San Michele all’Adige (IASMA) [25] makes genome scale analyses possible. Using these databases, we
characterised all sequences of the PR10 gene family of
V. vinifera and monitored the expression of nine candidate genes in various tissues and conditions.

Results
In silico identification of V. vinifera PR10 related
sequences

We searched for all V. vinifera PR10 related sequences in
the whole genomic sequence published by the Genoscope.
An automatic list of chromosome regions containing PR10
and PR10-like gene annotations was produced. After correction for mis- and redundant annotations, ten sequences
with a complete ORF were retained, comprising VvPR10.1
and VvPR10.2, previously identified (AJ291705 and
AJ291704 respectively) and the recently described
VvPR10.3 gene (EU379313) [19]. Three additional incomplete sequences corresponded to pseudogenes. All thirteen
sequences were arranged in a tandem array on the chromosome 5. On both sides of this cluster, we could identify

four more PR10 related sequences, omitted by automatic
annotation. No additional sequence was retrieved by a
further homology search, suggesting that all V. vinifera
PR10 genes are grouped in this single cluster, approximately 80,000 pb long and limited by putative genes not
related to PR10 genes. The seventeen PR10 related
sequences were named s1 to s17 and numbered according
to their position on the chromosome regardless the strand
they were located on (Figure 1): the twelve first (s1 to s12)
and the last one (s17) on the minus (-) strand of the chromosome, and s13 to s16 on the plus (+) strand. VvPR10.1,
VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3 respectively correspond to s16,
s10 and s12. All Genoscope references and precise locations are given in the additional file 1. The seventeen
sequences collected from the Genoscope (PN 40024) were
compared to their counterparts in the IASMA database
(Pinot noir ENTAV 115), which are scattered on fifteen
different scaffolds [additional file 2]. Each sequence was
less than 2% divergent from its counterpart, highlighting a
high similarity between the two genomes and databases.
Characterisation and comparison of nucleotide sequences

The putative exon-intron structure of the seventeen
PR10 related sequences was determined (Figure 2a).
Each sequence is interrupted by a single intron at a very
well conserved position, presenting consensus motifs at
the 5′ and 3′ boundaries with exons (Figure 2b). The
hypothetical CDS are 204 to 486 bp long. The length of
exons is well conserved, except for s6, s7 and s9, which
are shortened by a premature stop codon suggesting
that they are pseudogenes. In addition, s9 presents a single nucleotide deletion in the first exon, which induces a
frame shift definitely compromising a correct translation. The structure of the fourteen sequences with a
complete ORF is in accordance with previous reports on
Vitis vinifera and other plant PR10 genes [9,18,19].
The CDS were aligned for comparison. The percentages of nucleotide similarity are given in Figure 3. All
sequences are very similar and show at least 48% of
nucleotide similarity. A very high similarity (≥92%) was
found between the six sequences s11-s16, including
VvPR10.1 and VvPR10.3, that are also strongly similar to
s10-VvPR10.2 (87-91% of nucleotide similarity), together
forming a group of closely related sequences. The
sequence of the pseudogene s6 is also remarkably similar to s5 (91%). The intron sequence is more variable
and the similarity percentages range from 8 to 100%,
being very high for the seven sequences s10-s16 comprising VvPR10.1, VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3 on one hand,
and for s5 and s6 on the other hand [additional file 3].
Prediction of expression

In order to determine whether the newly identified PR10
related sequences could be functional genes, we

searched for related Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) in
the databases (Table 1). Consistent with the prediction
of s6, s7 and s9 as pseudogenes, no EST was found to
match these incomplete sequences. In addition, we
found no EST corresponding to s2, s4, s8 nor s17, suggesting that these sequences would not be transcribed,
at least in the tissues and conditions reported in the
databases. On the contrary, numerous different ESTs
(> 100) were found to match s11, s13, s14 and s15 with
up to 99% nucleotide similarity. Although some of them
also matched the highly homologous VvPR10.1,
VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3, the expression of which was

reported [18,19], other ESTs were closer to s11, s13, s14
and s15, that would therefore be expressed in varied
reproductive and/or vegetative tissues. Several ESTs corresponding to s1, s3 and s5 were also found (1, 52 and
4, respectively). Although a single incomplete EST (27%
of coverage) matched s1, its sequence was 100% similar
to the sequence of s1. Moreover, this EST covered the
last 135 nucleotides of the CDS and 3′UTR, which are
usually the most varying parts of a gene sequence, suggesting that this EST is a specific partial transcript of s1.
The ESTs matching s3 and s5 with up to 99% similarity
and 100% coverage argue for the expression of these

two sequences. Using the Gene Finding program, a correct gene structure was predicted for the seven
sequences s4, s5, s8, s11, s13, s14 and s15, in addition
to VvPR10.1, VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3 (Figure 4). All
possess the well positioned TATA-box, transcription
starting site (TSS) and polyadenylation signal, defining a
CDS of 477-480 bp. No promoter was found for s1, s2,
s3 and s17. When a manual search was performed, no
TSS-motif was detectable for these sequences, but a
TATA-box was identified for s1, s3 and s17 at the
respective positions -1,214, -699 and -313 nucleotides.
On the whole, in addition to the three well characterised
V. vinifera PR10 genes, seven PR10 related sequences
showed the canonical transcription signals, suggesting
their possible expression, although no specific EST was
found to match s4 nor s8. In contrast, s1 and s3 did not
show the features usually described for effective transcription, but some specific ESTs were identified in the
databases, indicating their probable expression. Finally,
s2 and s17 showed no usual transcription signals, and
no EST was found to match these two sequences.

BLAST results were obtained for the putative CDS of the seventeen sequences
using the Vitis EST database of NCBI. The number of ESTs indicates the
number of matching results for each query. The percentage of coverage
indicates the relative length of coverage of the sequence by the best
matching EST. The percentage of nucleotide similarity is given for the best

named according to usual nomenclature. The highly
similar sequences VvPR10.1, s15 and s11 on one hand,
and VvPR10.3, s13 and s14 on the other hand (≥97%
nucleotide similarity) were named VvPR10.1-a, -b and

implied in possible ribonucleasic activity (E102, E149 et Y151). Alignments were performed with ClustalW. A V. vinifera specific Bet v 1 motif was
determined: G-[DG]-[VA]-L-x(4)-E-[SY]-[IL]-[CSATV]-[HY]-[ED]-x-[KST]-x-[VE]-x(3)-[GNDS]-G(2)-[CS]-x(2)-K-x(2)-[SK]-X-Y. In PR10.8 and PR10.10, the last
aa varies in the P-loop motif (E and T, respectively); in PR10.9, E102 is replaced by D102, the 4th aa in the P-loop motif is E, and the Bet v 1 motif
presents 4 differences (out of 34 aa) at the positions 1, 6, 23 and 29; in PR10.6, there is one difference (out of 33 aa) in the Bet v1 motif (position
12).

-c, and VvPR10.3-a, -b and -c, respectively. The other
sequences were named VvPR10.4 to VvPR10.10 for s8,
s5, s4, s3, s1, s2 and s17, respectively, following increasing divergence from the group of VvPR10.1-a to
VvPR10.3-c sequences. Putative protein sequences were
deduced from nucleotide sequences, analysed and compared. All proteins are 158-160 aa long (Figure 5), have
a calculated molecular mass ranging from 17.1 to 18.4
kDa and a theoretical pI from 4.7 to 6.3, consistent with
usual plant PR10 features [9]. Apart from few exceptions
mentioned in the figure legend, all sequences present
the three characteristic amino acids thought to be
implied in ribonucleasic activity: E102, E149 and Y151, the
characteristic P-loop motif (aa 47-55) described in various species and corresponding to the consensus
sequence GXGGXGXXK, and the Bet v 1 motif which is
the signature for the Pathogenesis-related proteins Bet v
1 family (Prosite accession PS00451)[3,9]. The predictive
three-dimensional structure of the deduced proteins was
determined. As for PR10.1 (Figure 6), all proteins would
be composed of three alpha-helices and a sevenstranded antiparallel beta-sheet arranged to form a large
internal hydrophobic cavity. Nine short loops connect
the secondary elements. This conformation is in accordance with the crystal structure determined for plant
PR10 proteins in cherry, yellow lupine, birch and celery
[12-15]. All these observations suggest correct structure
and folding for the eleven putative V. vinifera PR10

proteins in addition to PR10.1, PR10.2 and PR10.3
[additional file 4].

persica [8], Bet v 1 subfamilies I-III and V in Betula
pendula [26] and LlPR10 subclasses I and II in Lupinus
luteus [11] (Figure 7). In each species, PR10 proteins
tend to form one (Betula pendula, Lupinus luteus) or
two clades (Malus domestica, Prunus persica and Vitis
vinifera), showing a low intraspecific and a higher interspecific variation, as previously described [4-6]. In a first
clade, V. vinifera PR10 proteins are subdivided into two
distinct homogeneous groups: PR10.1-A to PR10.3-C
with more than 79% of amino acid identity and PR10.4
to PR10.6 with more than 81% of amino acid identity.
These two groups of tightly phylogenetically connected
proteins are closer to birch Bet v 1 than to PR10 proteins of other plant species, and are undoubtedly distant
from the four other V. vinifera PR10 proteins, PR10.7 to
PR10-10.

Expression of V. vinifera candidate PR10 genes

The possible expression of ten out of the fourteen complete PR10 sequences was assessed in various non-treated tissues of V. vinifera cv. Chardonnay, as well as
during secondary somatic embryogenesis. It was not
possible to design specific primers for the detection of
VvPR10.1-b and -c and VvPR10.3-b and -c transcripts,
because of very high similarity with VvPR10.1-a and
VvPR10.3-a transcripts respectively, even in the 5′ and
3′ UTRs.
Nine different genes were expressed in the tissues analysed, VvPR10.10 transcripts being undetectable in any
condition (Figure 8). Moreover, VvPR10.4 and VvPR10.9
transcripts were only weakly detected in a few tissues.
In intact tissues, all nine PR10 genes were expressed,
depending on the plant organ. In roots, the expression

VvPR10.8 transcription was very weak. At the opposite,
VvPR10.7 transcription was high in leaves, while
VvPR10.5 and VvPR10.6 transcripts were not detected;
all other genes were expressed at varied levels. In stems,
VvPR10.2, VvPR10.3-a and VvPR10.7 were the only
clearly expressed genes. Immature flowers expressed all
genes except VvPR10.4 and VvPR10.9. In non-treated

from 2,4-D-treated embryos. VvPR10.4 expression was
not detected in non-treated or treated embryos.

Discussion
We found a total of seventeen PR10 related sequences
in the whole V. vinifera genome. Thirteen unique
sequences were retained from an automatic search that
initially produced ninety regions, reflecting redundancy
of the database as well as annotation errors partly due
to wrong homology detection. A manual search allowed
the recovery of four additional PR10 related sequences.
All seventeen sequences were found in a single compact
cluster on the chromosome 5. Plant PR10 belong to
multigene families. There are at least five PR10 genes in
pea [27], eighteen Mal d 1 genes in apple [7], ten Bet
v 1 genes in birch [6], eight Fra a 1 genes in strawberry
[28], six PR10 genes in Solanum surattense [29], eight in
yellow lupine [11], five in rice [30], and eight Pru p 1
and Pru d 1 genes in peach and almond, respectively
[8]. They were shown to form physical clusters in apple
[7] and peach [8]. Poplar PR10 genes are also supposed
to be grouped on chromosomes [26]. Tandem duplicates
are frequent in plant genomes and represent up to 16%
of Arabidopsis genes [31]. Such gene clusters are
thought to be produced by successive single gene or
small-scale duplications. We found that thirteen out of
the seventeen V. vinifera PR10 sequences are present on
the chromosome in direct orientation, suggesting that
most copies were produced by unequal crossing over
events, as described in Arabidopsis and rice [31].
Following duplication, new copies of a gene may
undergo modifications allowing functional diversification, which is a significant source of evolutionary
novelty in plants [32]. However, gene duplication mostly
creates copies that are rapidly lost through pseudogenisation. As a result, from numerous homologous
sequences coexisting in a genome, only a part are functional genes. From the seventeen V. vinifera PR10
sequences, only fourteen have an intact ORF. In birch,
the copy number of PR10 genes varies from twelve to
twenty-five, depending on the species, and pseudogenes
represents as much as one-third of Betula nigra alleles
[6]. In V. vinifera, the pseudogenes s7 and s9 share the
highest nucleotide similarity with VvPR10.6 (s4), suggesting that they could derive from its duplication. Likewise, s6 is closer to VvPR10.5 (s5) than to all other
sequences and could therefore originate from its duplication. Moreover, s6 and VvPR10.5 are also very similar
at the intron level (81% of nucleotide similarity), indicative of possible recent duplication or slow
pseudogenisation.
Apart from pseudogenes, sequence divergence is generally reduced in PR10 multigene families. PR10 genes
within a species are generally very similar and more

distant from gene copies of other plant species [4]. Such
a low intraspecific variability has been observed in Passiflora [5] and in the Betula genus [6]. The different paralogs are thought to undergo strong concerted evolution
which is the tendency of a family of repeated genes to
jointly evolve. The close physical proximity of tandem
duplicates facilitates gene conversion or unequal crossing-over events leading to concerted evolution [6]. The
phylogenetic tree in Figure 7 illustrates probable concerted evolution in the V. vinifera PR10 family. However, V. vinifera PR10 proteins divide into two clades
interrupted by PR10 of other plants, indicating partial
independent evolution. Interestingly, the seven
sequences s10 to s16 corresponding to the very homologous proteins PR10.1-A to PR10.3-C follow one another
on the chromosome, what could favor concerted evolution and suggest strong local selection pressure. However, it cannot be ruled out that recent duplication
events produced these seven very homologous
sequences.
Grapes, as other eudicot species, probably originate
from an ancient hexaploid ancestor formed through
whole genome duplication (WGD) events [24,33].
Recurrent polyploidisation is tightly linked to evolution
in angiosperms, providing raw materials for gene diversification and genome refinement, and coinciding with
species radiation [32]. A WGD is followed by incomplete and asymmetric loss of gene copies and chromosome rearrangements allowing the recovery of a diploidlike state compatible with effective reproduction. In Arabidopsis, it was possible to track gene pairs released by a
recent specific WGD event [34]. Only 28.6% of gene
pairs were retained from the transient tetraploid genome, the other pairs having lost a copy from one of the
homeologous chromosomes. In V. vinifera, PR10
sequences were solely located on the chromosome 5,
suggesting loss of some of the triplicate ancestral copies
and/or translocation on a unique chromosome. The
seventeen present PR10 sequences are most probably
due to repetitive small duplications having continuously
occurred during V. vinifera evolution. Subsequent mutations and possible positive selection are responsible for
the observed divergence within the sequences. However,
at least a part of V. vinifera PR10 sequences are probably subjected to concerted evolution, reducing variability and hampering the identification of putative
triplicate ancestral copies.
We were able to detect the expression of nine out of
the fourteen complete PR10 related sequences in varied
non-treated and treated tissues of V. vinifera cv. Chardonnay. Three genes, i.e. VvPR10.1-a, VvPR10.2 and
VvPR10.3-a, were already shown to be expressed under
pathogen attack or abiotic stress, and during somatic
embryogenesis induction [18,19], whereas expression of

Lebel et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/184

VvPR10.4-VvPR10.9 was never studied before.
VvPR10.10 transcripts were not detectable in our conditions. This sequence has no corresponding EST in the
databases and lacks canonical transcription signals.
However, expression could be limited to very specific
tissues and/or developmental stages. Although specific
ESTs in the databases suggest a probable expression of
the four sequences VvPR10.1-b and -c and VvPR10.3-b
and -c, the distinction of each transcription product
would require more sensitive methods than PCR, such
as cDNA-AFLP or SSCP, which were used for discriminate highly homologous sequences in potato, polyploid
cotton and barley [35-37]. The expression of VvPR10.5,
VvPR10.7 and VvPR10.8 is not surprising because well
matching ESTs were found in the databases. On the
contrary, no EST was found to correspond to VvPR10.4,
VvPR10.6 and VvPR10.9, whose expression is therefore
reported for the first time. Interestingly, VvPR10.7,
VvPR10.8 and VvPR10.9 are expressed although devoid
of canonical transcription signals.
We found transcripts of all nine PR10 genes in varying
amounts, in the different non-treated tissues analysed,
suggesting a role apart from defence. Specific expression
profiles were found in intact tissues, except for
VvPR10.2 and VvPR10.3-a. Stems and intact embryos
expressed a reduced subset of PR10 proteins. On the
contrary, immature flowers expressed a large subset of
PR10 genes, suggesting a possible role of some PR10
proteins during sexual reproduction. No V. vinifera
PR10 gene was solely expressed in calli derived from
2,4-D-treated embryos. However, expression of several
genes was enhanced in these tissues, at least weakly.
Somatic embryogenesis is generally obtained from tissues subjected to the auxin 2,4-D, which acts as a stress
factor able to trigger the reprogramming of plant
somatic cells towards embryogenesis [38]. As a consequence, high amounts of defence proteins are produced
following a 2,4-D treatment, as shown in grapevine cultures [39]. Consistent with the results reported here, we
previously showed that varied PR genes including
VvPR10.1-a and VvPR10.3-a are up-regulated during
secondary somatic embryogenesis induction in V. vinifera [19]. VvPR10.1 expression was also previously
reported to be induced in whole plant leaves challenged
with the incompatible bacterium Pseudomonas syringae
[18]. Interestingly, VvPR10.4 and VvPR10.7 were not
responsive to 2,4-D treatment.
On the whole, various expression patterns were found
for V. vinifera PR10 genes, indicating functional diversification and possible tissue specificity. Likewise, in other
plants, PR10 proteins show expression diversity suggesting various biological activities [9]. A major feature of
PR10 proteins is their internal hydrophobic cavity with
openings at the protein surface. Several three-

Page 10 of 13

dimensional modeling studies showed that this structure
is suitable for the binding and transport of diverse
hydrophobic ligands as brassinolides [14] or homocastasterone [12]. Some birch and yellow lupine PR10 can
bind diverse molecules such as cytokinins, brassinosteroids, fatty acids and flavonoids, suggesting that they
could interfere with the trafficking of hormones inside
the cell [10,16,17]. Moreover, overexpression of a PR10
gene in pea led to a change in the ratio between cytokinins and abscisic acid, showing that the PR10 content
could be relevant for intracellular hormone regulation
[40]. Although all crystallographic models for PR10 proteins share the same canonical fold, their superimposition can reveal structural differences [12]. Remarkably,
the volume of the internal cavity and of its openings can
show some variability, what could influence the type of
transported ligand. In yellow lupine, different shapes for
the inducible LlPR10.1A and the constitutive LlPR10.1B
could account for their different biological roles [13].

Conclusion
The availability of the complete genome sequence of
V. vinifera allowed us to characterise the PR10 gene
family. Seventeen different PR10 related sequences including three pseudogenes were identified and located in a single compact cluster on the chromosome 5, most probably
reflecting repetitive small duplications during evolution. A
phylogenetic analysis showed a characteristic low variability within the different sequences, especially within seven
sequences closely located on the chromosome, suggesting
probable concerted evolution. We could analyse the
expression of nine genes in various tissues. Different
expression patterns indicate functional specialisation. Several genes showed a typical stress induced up-regulation.
Further experiments will help to elucidate the differential
regulation of V. vinifera PR10 gene expression.
Methods
In silico identification of PR10 related sequences in the
V. vinifera genome and characterization of candidate genes

The grapevine Genoscope database was used to identify
any sequence related to PR10 genes [41]. The Genoscope Blat tool [42] and the ClustalW alignment tool of
the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) [43] were
used to retrieve and compare the sequences. An automatic list produced twenty-three unique (among ninety)
putative PR10 or PR10-like gene annotations. Seven
annotations with no consistent homology with PR10
genes were removed. Six other annotations covered
three complete sequences, from which each exon was
annotated as an independent gene, suggesting that the
intron splicing sites were not detected. The last ten
annotations comprised seven sequences with a complete
ORF, and three with a prematurely interrupted ORF. All

Lebel et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:184
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/184

thirteen PR10 related sequences were found to form a
cluster on the chromosome 5, between the positions
604,886 and 675,550. Thoroughly examining this chromosome portion as well as its 5′ and 3′ extensions, we
found four additional annotations with nucleotide similarity (48-71% in the ORF) to the thirteen previous
sequences. The PR10 cluster was found to be limited by
two putative genes not related to PR10 sequences
GSVIVT00033064001 and GSVIVT00033091001.
All corresponding genome sequences originating from
the Istituto Agrario San Michele all’Adige (IASMA)
grapevine database were retrieved using the NCBI Blast
tool [44]. They were compared to the Genoscope
sequences using the ClustalW alignment tool.
The exon-intron composition of PR10 sequences was
automatically determined by the Gaze program on the
Genoscope website. When necessary, the position of the
intron was corrected relatively to the structure of
VvPR10.1 [18], and according to the 5′ and 3′ splicing
consensus sequences NN/GT and AG/NN, respectively.
Vitis sp. ESTs were searched, using the blastn program
of the NCBI database [44].
Gene structures were predicted using the Gene Finding
program on the University of London bioinformatics web
server [45]. The organism parameter was set on “dicots”.
The FGENESH method showed the position of the TATAbox, the first and last nucleotides of the exons and the
position of the polyadenylation signal. The TSSP-TCM
method localized the transcription initiation site (+1).
Protein sequence analysis

The putative CDS were translated using the Transeq
program [46]. The PM and pI were determined using
the COMPUTE program [47]. The PROSITE database
[48] was used to find the Pathogenesis-related proteins
Bet v 1 family signature. Three-dimensional structures
were predicted on an automated comparative protein
modeling server using SWISS-MODEL [49].

Phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments

A phylogenetic tree was built using the Neighbor-Joining method, with the Phylo_win program [50]. Bootstrap
values were obtained from 500 replicates. The ClustalW
alignment tool was used to compare protein sequences.
Plant material

All expression studies were performed on V. vinifera
plants or cultures of the cultivar Chardonnay.
We separately collected roots, stems (with nodes) and
whole leaves from well developed plantlets (10-12
leaves) obtained from in vitro microcutting, as previously described [51].
Immature flowers were harvested from French vineyards, at the stage of separate flower buds.
Recurrent in vitro embryogenesis was induced from
nodal explants of the V. vinifera cv. Chardonnay, as
previously described [19]. Young cotyledonary somatic
embryos were isolated and transferred onto a medium
containing the auxin analog 2,4-D for induction of
indirect secondary embryogenesis. After three weeks,
an undifferentiated callus was obtained from each
embryo.
Tissues were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and
further conserved at -80°C until RNA extraction. Two
independent samplings were performed.
RNA extraction and analysis

Total RNA extractions and semi-quantitative RT-PCR
experiments were performed as reported [19]. Primer
pairs were designed to overlap the intron, in order to
distinguish possible genome DNA contamination from
gene expression products (Table 2). All primer pairs
were shown to efficiently detect the respective corresponding genomic sequences (gDNA). Semi-quantitative
RT-PCR tests were performed in three replicates. PCR
products were sequenced to confirm their identity
(Genoscreen, France).
