Abstract
Background: There is an increasing number of complete and incomplete virus genome sequences
available in public databases. This large body of sequence data harbors information about
epidemiology, phylogeny, and virulence. Several specialized databases, such as the NCBI Influenza
Virus Resource or the Los Alamos HIV database, offer sophisticated query interfaces along with
integrated exploratory data analysis tools for individual virus species to facilitate extracting this
information. Thus far, there has not been a comprehensive database for dengue virus, a significant
public health threat.
Results: We have created an integrated web resource for dengue virus. The technology developed
for the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource has been extended to process non-segmented dengue virus
genomes. In order to allow efficient processing of the dengue genome, which is large in comparison
with individual influenza segments, we developed an offline pre-alignment procedure which
generates a multiple sequence alignment of all dengue sequences. The pre-calculated alignment is
then used to rapidly create alignments of sequence subsets in response to user queries. This
improvement in technology will also facilitate the incorporation of additional virus species in the
future. The set of virus-specific databases at NCBI, which will be referred to as Virus Variation
Resources (VVR), allow users to build complex queries against virus-specific databases and then
apply exploratory data analysis tools to the results. The metadata is automatically collected where
possible, and extended with data extracted from the literature.
Conclusion: The NCBI Dengue Virus Resource integrates dengue sequence information with
relevant metadata (sample collection time and location, disease severity, serotype, sequenced
genome region) and facilitates retrieval and preliminary analysis of dengue sequences using
integrated web analysis and visualization tools.

Background
The National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) Virus Variation Resources (VVR) provide web
retrieval interfaces, analysis and visualization tools for
virus sequence datasets. In this paper we describe the
recent extension of the collection of resources to include
the Dengue Virus Resource in addition to the existing
Influenza Virus Resource [1,2]. The NCBI Dengue Virus
Resource was created to support a collaborative effort by
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
(NIAID), the Broad Institute, and the Novartis Institute
for Tropical Diseases (NITD) to create a large collection of
complete dengue genome sequences and provide access to
the sequences and linked geographic and clinical information. This effort includes the NIAID-funded sequencing of
dengue genomes from a wide geographic range by the
Broad Institute and its collaborators.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up
to 50 million individuals in more than 100 tropical and
sub-tropical countries are infected with the mosquitoborne dengue virus (DENV) each year resulting in
500,000 hospitalizations [3,4]. With improvements in
disease identification, reporting and surveillance, the
number of reported dengue cases has been increasing in
recent decades (Figure 1), as has the geographic range of
the virus and its main vector Aedes aegypti, making dengue
a growing public health concern, especially in developing
nations. Dengue infections can result in a wide spectrum
of disease severity ranging from sub-clinical to dengue
fever (DF), an influenza-like illness that is commonly selflimiting, to the life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic
fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS).
Host factors such as a previous infection with a heterologous DENV serotype, and virulence appear to play a role
in determining disease severity in individuals [5-8]. Environmental factors like vector density, rainfall and temperature may affect the severity of DHF outbreaks [9].
Dengue viruses can be classified into 4 serotypes (DENV1 to DENV-4) which have a mean nucleotide identity of
70% between the serotypes and 95% within the serotypes.
The number of DENV sequences available in the public
sequence repositories has been growing steadily and the
value of these sequences would be enhanced if exploratory analysis tools for performing preliminary phylogenetic analysis and search for epidemiological, geographic,
and medical information were integrated with the database and convenient interactive visualization was provided. DengueInfo [10] was developed by NITD as a
resource for retrieving whole genomes and associated
metadata. Similarly, whole genome sequences generated
at the Broad Institute can be accessed and queried directly
from the institute's online database [11]. However, nei-

ther of these resources provide an integrated interface to
analysis and visualization tools nor do they provide access
to all dengue sequences irrespective of origin or length. To
meet these needs, we extended the functionality developed by the authors of the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource
to the non-segmented dengue virus. Since the DENV
genome is more than 4 times larger than the largest individual influenza virus segment, multiple sequence alignments could not be calculated on request as is done for
influenza virus and are instead pre-calculated offline. The
alignment calculation is a three step procedure that first
generates multiple protein alignments for the polyproteins derived from complete genome records of each
DENV serotype, merges the serotype-specific protein
alignments, and then iteratively adds shorter protein
sequences. Coding sequence alignments are calculated on
demand from the protein alignments. The new NCBI
Virus Variation Resource is a flexible tool that can be
extended to other viruses, for example West Nile virus.

Construction and content
Data sources and curation
The current Virus Variation Resource includes dengue and
influenza virus sequences. The NCBI Influenza Virus
Resource was described elsewhere [1,2]. Here we describe
the extension of this resource to include dengue virus
sequence data. Since the dengue genome is not segmented
but more than 4 times longer than the longest influenza
segment, a different approach to calculating multiple
alignments is used for dengue sequences. While alignments in the Influenza Resource are calculated on
demand, dengue alignments are pre-calculated to increase
responsiveness and reduce server loads. Details of this
approach are described in a later section.

All DENV nucleotide and protein sequences available in
the public DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank repositories are evaluated for inclusion in the database. Patent sequences and
sequences that contain obvious errors or vector sequences
are excluded and the serotype classification is verified by
comparison with a reference sequence set. Metadata (disease severity, collection date, collection location, serotype, genome region) are taken from the records, if
available, or obtained from the literature. The region of
the DENV genome covered by the sequence is determined
by alignment and made available for queries. Newly public sequences are detected in the NCBI data stream daily
and are usually added to the database within a week of
becoming available.
Data overview
Currently there are 6235 DENV records available in the
VVR and the available metadata are summarized in Table
1. The number of sequence records available increases
roughly exponentially with the year of collection (Figure

2A). The most sequenced region of the dengue genome is
E and the majority of sequences are short (< 500 nt), however, there is a growing number of complete genomes
available (Figure 2B, C), in large part due to the active
effort to collect world-wide genome sequences. As
expected, three of the top 5 most frequently represented
countries in the VVR database are Asian (Taiwan, Thailand, and Viet Nam). The others are North and South
American, respectively (Puerto Rico and Brazil; see Figure
2D).
Database construction
Virus Variation Resource data are stored in the relational
database system MSSQL Server 2005 using a simple
schema that stores nucleic acid sequences and their metadata in one table and protein sequences in a second table
linked to their encoding sequences through an id field.

Alignment construction
Multiple alignments of the available DENV protein
sequences in VVR are pre-calculated offline using the following three step procedure. First, all complete protein
sequences of each serotype are aligned separately in a
multiple alignment step. Then, the individual intra-type
alignments are merged to create a seed alignment covering
the complete dengue polyprotein. Finally, incomplete
sequences are aligned one by one against the sequences of
the same type from the seed alignment using sequence to
profile alignments. If a gap column is inserted into the
profile during one of the iterative alignment steps, it is
introduced into the complete seed alignment of all types
to preserve consistency. When new sequences are added to
the VVR database, they are added to the existing alignment
through the last step of the alignment procedure. Periodically, the alignment is completely recalculated to take

advantage of the increases in the number of complete
sequences. Alignments are calculated with MUSCLE [12]
driven by a set of custom Perl programs which rely on the
BioPerl toolkit [13]. Nucleotide alignments of the coding
regions are generated dynamically as codon alignments
based on the protein alignments.

Database query interface
Figure 3A shows the basic query interface to the dengue
virus database. Users may either search for protein
sequences, their coding regions (CDS), or genomic nucleotide sequences. Additional searchable fields are: serotype
(1 â 4), disease severity (DF, DHF, DSS), country or region
of isolation (e.g. Europe, Puerto Rico), isolation year or
year range, the genome regions included in the sequence
(e.g. C, M, E), or a substring of the sequence (e.g.
MNNQRKKAKN). Results may be restricted to complete
sequences. Each time a query is executed by clicking "Add
to Query Builder", a summary of the query parameters
and the number of results are shown in the Query Builder
table. An arbitrary number of queries can be executed and
results for any subset of the queries can be obtained by
selecting them and clicking "Get sequences", which will
display the result view as seen in Figure 3B. Results can be
ordered by up to three fields and a subset may be selected.
The nucleotide, protein, or CDS sequence of the selected
results can be downloaded in FASTA format. Alternatively,
accession lists can be obtained as well.
Multiple alignment viewer
The multiple alignment viewer is accessible from the
results view. It assembles the requested pre-aligned

sequences and displays them with a measure of sequence
variability and a consensus anchor sequence at the top
(Figure 3C). Any of the sequences can be chosen to replace
the consensus as the anchor. Sequences can be selected for
pairwise Blast-2-sequences alignment and aligned
sequences can be downloaded in FASTA or a printfriendly format. CDS alignment are calculated dynamically based on the pre-calculated protein alignment by
mapping codons to their corresponding amino acids, with
coding changes highlighted in a different color. Note that
only the regions selected in the query are displayed in the
alignment and that the number of displayed residues in
the alignment is limited to avoid delivering excessive
amounts of data to client browsers. Currently the limit is
100,000 residues (for example 200 sequences of length
500), but planned improvements to the alignment viewer
will likely raise this limit.

ing collection year from 1900 to 2010). All selected
sequences have complete coding sequences for envelope
proteins. We selected complete linkage clustering algorithm and Felsenstein's F84 distance. The clustering tree is
shown in Figure 4. Using "Viewing options, search and
markup" in the tree viewer, sequences isolated before
1992 were highlighted in red. The majority of the pre1992 sequences (92%) stay in one cluster.
Future improvements
The Virus Variation Resource currently covers dengue and
influenza viruses. However, the framework of this
resource may be applied to other viruses. The Influenza
Virus Resource has been very successful since its inception
and we hope that additional resources in a similar mold
will prove useful for other communities.

Conclusion
Tree builder and viewer
Phylogenetic or clustering trees can be calculated and displayed for protein sequences or their corresponding CDS
sequences. The tree builder is accessible from the results
and the alignment views with the "Build a tree" button
and allows sequences to be selected for inclusion based on
a trade off between total length of the alignment and the
exclusion of short sequences. Various measures of distance for protein and nucleotide sequences are available
and are identical to those described for the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource [1]. Trees can be constructed from the
distance matrices using the neighbor-joining, average
linkage, complete linkage, or single linkage algorithms. To
facilitate the display of trees with many leaf nodes an
adaptive resolution technique in which some branches
are displayed in a sub-scale representation is employed [2]
(Figure 3D). Users can interactively manipulate the aggregation or refinement of any branch in the tree. In addition, certain metadata, such as year or country of
isolation, can be displayed on the tree and are shown as
aggregate measures for aggregated branches.
Case study
It was reported that strains of DENV-3 circulating in Thailand prior to 1992 are distinct from those circulating after
1992, and this finding has been interpreted as an extinction of existing DENV-3 strains and the emergence of new,
locally evolved strains. This event reportedly happened
coincidentally with the replacement of DENV-2 with
DENV-3 as the majority serotype in Thailand [15]. We
demonstrate a preliminary analysis of dengue sequences
using the tools of the Virus Variation Resource that supports this observation.

There are 142 DEV-3 envelope protein sequences from
Thailand in the database. Of those, 114 sequences have
collection year on record (these can be selected by select-

Virus Variation Resources constitute a tool that allows the
included virus sequences to be queried by available metadata which include geographic and medical information.
Sequences resulting from these searches can then be
downloaded in aligned or unaligned forms and optionally subjected to exploratory data analysis using the builtin tools. The technology for pre-calculating multiple
sequence alignments can be applied to other collections,
including the existing Influenza Virus Resource and a
resource for the West Nile Virus that we plan to develop in
the future.
