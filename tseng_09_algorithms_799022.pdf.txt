Abstract
Background: In 2004, Bejerano et al. announced the startling discovery of hundreds of
“ultraconserved elements”, long genomic sequences perfectly conserved across human, mouse, and
rat. Their announcement stimulated a flurry of subsequent research.
Results: We generalize the notion of ultraconserved element in a natural way from extraordinary
human-rodent conservation to extraordinary conservation over an arbitrary set of species. We call
these “Extremely Conserved Elements”. There is a linear time algorithm to find all such Extremely
Conserved Elements in any multiple sequence alignment, provided that the conservation is
required to be across all the aligned species. For the general case of conservation across an
arbitrary subset of the aligned species, we show that the question of whether there exists an
Extremely Conserved Element is NP-complete. We illustrate the linear time algorithm by
cataloguing all 177 Extremely Conserved Elements in the currently available 44-vertebrate wholegenome alignment, and point out some of the characteristics of these elements.
Conclusions: The NP-completeness in the case of conservation across an arbitrary subset of the
aligned species implies that it is unlikely an efficient algorithm exists for this general case. Despite
this fact, for the interesting case of conservation across all or most of the aligned species, our
algorithm is efficient enough to be practical. The 177 Extremely Conserved Elements that we
catalog demonstrate many of the characteristics of the original ultraconserved elements of
Bejerano et al.

Background
In 2004, Bejerano et al. [1] made the startling discovery
that there are hundreds of long genomic sequences
extraordinarily conserved across human, mouse, and rat,
most of them in noncoding regions and some of them
very distant from the nearest human gene. They defined
an “ultraconserved element” to be at least 200 consecutive alignment columns, 100% of these columns
perfectly conserved in human, mouse, and rat. They
reported 481 such elements across the human genome,

exclusive of rRNA genes. They also reported incidentally
that some fraction (99%, 97%, and 67%, respectively) of
these ultraconserved elements are also well conserved in
dog, in chicken, and in fugu, though with fewer than
100% of the columns perfectly conserved in these other
species even in this fraction of elements.
Their introduction of ultraconserved elements stimulated
a flurry of subsequent research. Derti et al. [2] compiled
lists of similarly perfectly conserved elements in human-

mouse-dog and in human-chicken, and observed a
surprisingly small overlap in these three sets of ultraconserved elements. Sakuraba et al. [3] compiled a list of
elements each more than 500 bp long and each more than
95% identical between human and mouse, and observed
that only 9-14% of these have conserved matches in
fishes. Visel et al. [4] showed that the noncoding
ultraconserved elements of Bejerano et al. [1] were only
a subset of elements under similar constraint and with
similar regulatory function. They generated this larger set
of elements using Gumby scores [5], and showed that this
larger set of noncoding ultraconserved elements is highly
enriched in mouse enhancer activity. Rather than using
percent of perfectly conserved columns, Siepel et al. [6]
incorporated the phylogeny into the measure of conservation by using a phylogenetic hidden Markov model,
and defined Highly Conserved Elements to be those with
the highest log-odds scores, measuring how much more
likely they are to be generated in the conserved than the
nonconserved state of the model.
Most of these works defined their conserved elements in
terms of conservation across just 2 or 3 species, Siepel
et al. [6] being an exception. In this paper we extend the
notion of ultraconserved elements in a very natural way
to an arbitrarily large collection of species.
Suppose that you are given a whole-genome multiple
sequence alignment, such as the current 44-vertebrate
whole-genome alignment available through the UCSC
Genome Browser [7]. You are interested in finding long
regions of this alignment that are extraordinarily well
conserved across all or most of the 44 species, in the
spirit of generalizing the notion of ultraconserved
elements of Bejerano et al. [1]. For concreteness in this
introduction, let us say that you want to identify all
regions of at least 100 consecutive alignment columns
such that, for some subset S of at least 40 of the 44
species, at least 80% of the columns in this region are
perfectly conserved (i.e., contain the same nucleotide)
across all the species in S. Because the 44-vertebrate
whole-genome alignment occupies approximately 250
gigabytes of memory, algorithmic efficiency is a concern.
In the next section, we consider the generalization of this
problem instance to arbitrary alignments, any number of
columns, any minimum cardinality |S|, and any percentage of conserved columns. We call such well conserved
regions “Extremely Conserved Elements”. We present a
linear time algorithm for finding all such elements,
provided the subset S is the entire set of aligned species.
For an arbitrary subset S, we demonstrate that the
problem is NP-complete [8] and hence it is unlikely that
there is an efficient algorithm for finding Extremely
Conserved Elements in this general case.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/432

As an illustration of the linear time algorithm, we
present results for the concrete instantiation of the
problem given above. In the current 44-vertebrate wholegenome alignment, there are 177 elements, each with at
least 100 alignment columns and each perfectly conserved across the same 40 or more vertebrates in at least
80% of its columns. The longest such element is 355
columns long and occurs 60 Kbp from the nearest gene
on human chromosome 19, perfectly conserved in 80%
of its columns across 41 of the species, missing only
gorilla, shrew, and lamprey. There is also a region 70 bp
long, 7 Kbp upstream of the FOXB2 gene on human
chromosome 9, with 90% of its columns perfectly
conserved across all 44 vertebrates.

Results and discussion
Problem statement and algorithms
We begin with a precise formulation of the Extremely
Conserved Element problem:

Inputs: m × n alignment matrix M with entries from {A,
C, G, T, -}, integer s ≤ m, integer t ≤ n, and real number
0 < c ≤ 1.
Problem: Determine if M has a subset S of rows, a subset
T of consecutive columns (ignoring columns that
contain the gap character “-” in every row of S), and a
subset U of T, with |S| ≥ s, |T| ≥ t, and |U| ≥ c|T| such that,
in the matrix M restricted to S × U, every column is
perfectly conserved (that is, all the elements in that
column are equal). Note that neither S nor U need be
consecutive.
For example, the illustrative problem in the introduction
is the version of the Extremely Conserved Element
problem with m = 44, n ≈ 3.8 × 109, s = 40, t = 100,
and c = 0.8.
The condition that every column in S × U be perfectly
conserved is overly simplistic. More realistically, the
conservation measure should depend on the phylogeny
relating the species, as does, for example, the measure
used by phastCons [6]. Suppose that F is any conservation scoring function (that may depend on the phylogeny). The algorithm of Theorem 1 is easily generalized
to the problem in which every column in S × U must
have F exceeding some threshold τ.
Theorem 1: If s = m, the Extremely Conserved Element
problem can be solved in time O(mn). In fact, the
maximum value of t can be determined in this time.
Proof: Assume without loss of generality that no column
contains the gap character “-” in every row. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n,

Page 2 of 8

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:432

let qi = 1 if column i is perfectly conserved, and qi = 0
otherwise. The result then follows from Theorem 2. □
Theorem 2: Given q ∈ {0,1}n and 0 <c ≤ 1, there is an O
(n) time algorithm that maximizes j - i subject to the
condition that qi+1 ... qj contains at least c(j - i) 1’s.
Proof: A variety of linear time algorithms for this
problem have appeared in the literature [9-11], although
this is the first time it has been applied to multiple
sequence alignments on a gigabyte scale. We give here a
new and simpler algorithm due to Eddie Grove and
Benno Schwikowski (personal communication). For 0 ≤ i
≤ n, let

− c).

k =1

Let x be the number of 1’s in qi+1 ... qj. Then

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/432

Theorem 3: If c = 1, the Extremely Conserved Element
problem can be solved in polynomial time. In fact, the
maximum value of s can be determined in this time.
Proof: For every choice T of at least t consecutive
columns, sort the rows of T lexicographically and look
for s identical rows, with at least t nongap characters
each, in this sorted list. □
However, for the general case, the following theorem
shows that it is unlikely that there is an efficient
algorithm [8].
Theorem 4: The general Extremely Conserved Element
problem is NP-complete, even if t = n and M’s entries are
all either A or T.
Proof: The reduction used is very similar to the reduction
from Clique to Balanced Complete Bipartite Subgraph
[14].

j

r j − ri =

∑ (q

k

− c) = x(1 − c) + ( j − i − x)(−c) = x − c( j − i).

k =i +1

Thus, rj ≥ ri if and only if qi+1 ... qj has at least c(j - i) 1’s,
so the objective is to maximize j - i subject to rj ≥ ri.
For 0 ≤ i ≤ n, let Xi = min(r0, r1, ..., ri) and Yi = max(ri,
ri+1, ..., rn). X and Y are each nonincreasing sequences.
We claim that the objective above is equivalent to
maximizing j - i subject to Yj ≥ Xi: If rj ≥ ri, then Yj = max
(rj, rj+1, ..., rn) ≥ rj ≥ ri ≥ min(r0, r1, ..., ri) = Xi. If Yj ≥ Xi and
Xi <Xi-1 and Yj >Yj+1, then ri = Xi and rj = Yj, so rj ≥ ri. In
particular, (i, j) maximizes j - i subject to rj ≥ ri if and only
if (i, j) maximizes j - i subject to Yj ≥ Xi. Since X and Y are
sorted, the latter can be found in linear time: merge X
and Y, breaking ties by taking elements from Y first. Then
identify the maximum j - i such that Yj and Xi are
adjacent (in this order) in the sorted list. □
In fact, in the proof of Theorem 2, any pair (i, j) such that
Yj and Xi are adjacent (in this order) in the sorted list
corresponds to a maximal interval qi+1 ... qj that contains
at least c(j - i) 1’s. Thus, all such maximal intervals can be
found in linear time.

Let (G, K) be an instance of the Clique problem, where
G = (V, E) is an undirected graph and K is an integer.
Assume without loss of generality that K < |V| - 2.
Consider the bipartite graph B = ((X, Y), F), where X = V,
Y = E, and F = {(v, e) | v ∉ e}. Let M be the |X| × |Y|
adjacency matrix of B, where Mij = A if (Xi, Yj) ∈ F and

⎛K⎞
Mij = T otherwise. Let s = |V| - K, t = |E|, and c = ⎜ ⎟ /|E|.
⎝2⎠
We will show that G has a K-clique if and only if M has
the appropriate Extremely Conserved Element.
Suppose that C ⊆ V is a K-clique of G. Choose S = V - C
and U = {{u, v} | u ∈ C and v ∈ C}. |S| = |V| - K and |U| =

⎛K⎞
⎜ ⎟ and, in B, every vertex in S is adjacent to every
⎝2⎠
vertex in U. Hence, the submatrix of M restricted to S × U
contains only the character A.

The dual of Theorem 2, maximizing c subject to a lower
bound on j - i, also can be accomplished in linear time
[12,13]. This implies that, for s = m, the maximum value
of c in the Extremely Conserved Element problem can
also be determined in time O(mn).

⎛K⎞
Conversely, suppose that M has a (|V| - K) × ⎜ ⎟
⎝2⎠
submatrix M’ each of whose columns is perfectly
conserved. Since each vertex v in Y is not adjacent to
exactly 2 vertices in X, it is impossible for v’s column of
M’ to consist only of the character T when |V| - K > 2, as
is the case. Hence, M’ contains only the character A. That
is, there are subsets S of X and U of Y that form a
complete bipartite subgraph of B, with |S| = |V| - K and

For arbitrary S, the following theorem provides another
special case in which the problem can be solved
efficiently.

⎛K⎞
|U| = ⎜ ⎟ . Every vertex {u, v} ∈ U must satisfy u ∈ V - S
⎝2⎠
and v ∈ V - S since, in B, {u, v} is adjacent to every vertex

to the edges of a K-clique V - S in G. □

Catalog of Extremely Conserved Elements
As an illustration of Theorem 1, we present results for the
concrete instantiation of the problem given in the
introduction. In the current 44-vertebrate whole-genome
MULTIZ alignment (human genome assembly UCSC
hg18, March 2006) available through the UCSC Genome
Browser [7], we identify all Extremely Conserved Elements
with at least 100 consecutive alignment columns such that,
for some subset S of at least 40 species including human, at
least 80% of the columns in this region are perfectly
conserved across all the species in S. (If some column
contains the gap character “-” in all species of S, that
column is ignored, contributing neither to the count of 100
columns nor to the percent perfectly conserved.) We refer
to such elements as EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements.

Despite the NP-completeness demonstrated in Theorem
4, the algorithm of Theorem 1 still allows a feasible
solution to this particular instantiation of the general
Extremely Conserved Element problem. The simple
reason is that

⎟ = 149,986 is not an

impossibly large number of combinations on which to
run the linear time algorithm. Had we asked for
conservation across only 22 rather than 40 species, the
computation would have been prohibitive, because

⎛ 44 ⎞
12
⎜
⎟ > 2 × 10 . In addition, there are two novel
⎝ 22 ⎠
filters described in Methods that make the application to
whole-genome alignments feasible.
In the current 44-vertebrate whole-genome alignment,
our algorithm produces 177 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements.
A complete listing of these elements is given in
additional files. Additional file 1 is a spreadsheet that
shows each EC(40, 100, 0.8) element’s human genome
coordinates, its length, percent identity, names of
missing species, name of the human gene in which it
resides (if appropriate), names of and distances to the
two nearest neighboring genes, and overlap with
previously identified conserved elements [1,4,6]. Additional file 2 shows the exact alignment for each EC(40,
100, 0.8) element. Additional file 3 shows the single
longest extremely conserved element that has at least
90% of its columns perfectly conserved across all 44
vertebrate species. It is 70 bp long. (In Additional files 1
and 2, the lengths of some of the elements are shown as
slightly less than 100 columns. The reason is that we

have removed from every element those columns at each
end that are not perfectly conserved. Any of these
elements can be padded on either end to 100 columns
while still maintaining at least 80% identical columns.)
For the 240 human genes either containing an EC(40,
100, 0.8) element, or immediately upstream or downstream from that element if it is between genes, we
investigated enrichment for biological process GO terms,
using WebGestalt [15]. The results are shown in Table 1.
These enrichments are in accord with previous humanrodent studies [1,4], which reported significant functional enrichment for genes involved in regulation of
transcription, DNA binding, development, and nervous
system development.
For the genes containing the 25 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements
that overlap human coding exons, there is functional
enrichment for RNA processing (p-value = 2.20 × 10-4).
This is consistent with the reported findings for genes
containing ultraconserved elements that overlap coding
exons, which show significant functional enrichment for
RNA binding and regulation of splicing [1].
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the 177 EC(40, 100,
0.8) elements by human chromosome and location with
respect to human genes. If an element overlaps a human
coding exon (in some splice form), it is called “partially
coding”. If not and it is entirely contained within an
intron between two coding exons (in some splice form),
it is called “intronic”. If it is between the annotated
transcription start and stop sites of a gene but is neither
partially coding nor intronic, it is called “UTR”. (Most of
these elements are actually contained in a UTR intron
rather than overlapping the mature UTR.) If it is entirely
contained between two genes (in all splice forms), it is
called “intergenic”. In total there are 25 partially coding,
14 UTR, 61 intronic, and 77 intergenic EC(40, 100, 0.8)
elements; these account for 14%, 8%, 34%, and 44%,
respectively, of all 177 elements. None of the elements
overlap annotated rRNA, tRNA, or other annotated
noncoding RNA genes. Of the 77 intergenic elements,
65 (37% of all 177 elements) are more than 10 Kbp
from the nearest human gene and 42 (24% of all

177 elements) are more than 100 Kbp from the nearest
gene. These percentages are somewhat greater than
the corresponding percentages (29% over 10 Kbp and
18% over 100 Kbp) for intergenic ultraconserved
elements [1].
As was observed for ultraconserved elements [1], it is
quite common to see three to eight EC(40, 100, 0.8)
elements clustered within the same gene or within the
same intergenic region (see Additional file 1). As one
extreme example, eight occur within the introns and
another two upstream of the human gene ZFPM2 on
chromosome 8. ZFPM2 is a zinc finger transcription factor
that modulates the activity of GATA family proteins,
which are important regulators of cardiogenesis. None of
these ten ZFPM2 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements overlap
ultraconserved elements of Bejerano et al. [1], and three of
them do not even overlap the larger set of constrained
human-rodent elements of Visel et al. [4], so are novel.
The longest EC(40, 100, 0.8) element found is 355
columns long and is perfectly conserved in 80% of its
columns across 41 of the species, missing only gorilla,
shrew, and lamprey. It occurs 60 Kbp downstream of the
nearest gene on human chromosome 19. But interestingly it is 297 Kbp upstream of its other neighboring
gene ZNF536, which has two other upstream and three
intronic EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements. ZNF536 is a zinc
finger protein, expressed in the developing central
nervous system, that negatively regulates neuron differentiation [16]. Only two of these six EC(40, 100, 0.8)
elements overlap ultraconserved elements of Bejerano
et al. [1].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/432

Note, though, that the distribution of the lengths of EC
(40, 100, 0.8) elements is not significant since, as
pointed out in Methods, our algorithm sacrifices length
in preference for number of species in the element. As
one extreme example, there are abutting elements at
human hg18 coordinates chrX:24826152-24826332 and
chrX:24826333-24826597 of lengths 188 and 276,
respectively. The first is missing alpaca, sloth, medaka,
and lamprey, while the second is missing only alpaca,
medaka, and lamprey. Had the algorithm not prioritized
number of species over length, it would have produced a
single EC(40, 100, 0.8) element of length 464, which
would have been longer than the current longest
element. These two current elements are two out of
three EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements that occur in an intron
of POLA1, which encodes the DNA polymerase alpha
catalytic subunit.
Lamprey, the species most distant from the mammals
and also a low-coverage genome assembly, is missing
from 170 of the 177 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements. The
species with the next highest numbers are gorilla
(missing from 41), cat (missing from 35), and zebrafish
(missing from 30). Like lamprey, gorilla and cat are lowcoverage genome assemblies. On the other hand, fugu is
missing from only 4 of the 177 EC(40, 100, 0.8)
elements, zebra finch is missing from only 3, chicken is
missing from only 2, and lizard is missing from only 1.
These figures suggest that depth of sequencing is a
greater determinant of inclusion in extremely conserved
elements than is evolutionary distance, and also suggest
that additional extremely conserved elements will
emerge as the quality of genome sequences increases.
47 (27%) of the 177 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements overlap
an ultraconserved element of Bejerano et al. [1]. 117
(66%) overlap the larger set of constrained humanrodent elements of Visel et al. [4]. These overlaps
confirm the fact that we have identified significant
conserved elements that cannot be found by applying a
more stringent conservation criterion to a smaller
collection of species such as human and rodents. All
177 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements overlap phastCons
Highly Conserved Elements [6] (as computed in the
UCSC 44-vertebrate alignment) with phastCons logodds scores each exceeding 1300. Details of all these
overlaps are shown in Additional file 1. The phastCons
Highly Conserved Elements have the realistic advantage
of taking the phylogeny and branch lengths into
account, which our Extremely Conserved Elements do
not. However, because their log-odds scores favor longer
alignments, phastCons Highly Conserved Elements tend
to be much longer than EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements, with
less intense concentration of extremely conserved
columns. There are 12,749 phastCons Highly Conserved

Page 5 of 8

Elements with log-odds score at least 1300, of which
only a certain 177 contain within them EC(40, 100, 0.8)
elements. The average length of these 12,749 elements is
500 bp, with many of them several kilobasepairs long,
whereas the average EC(40, 100, 0.8) element is less
than 133 bp long. There is no obvious way of querying
phastCons Highly Conserved Elements so as to identify
those with such intense concentration of extremely
conserved columns. For instance, if you restrict attention
to those Highly Conserved Elements with log-odds score
at least 1300 and length at most 400 bp, this long list
would contain only 43 of the 177 EC(40, 100, 0.8)
elements; the remaining 134, though as extremely
conserved, occur within longer Highly Conserved
Elements.

long genomic sequences with extreme conservation
between humans and rodents. We generalized their
definition in a natural way that allows one to look for
such extreme conservation over a much larger collection
of species. We presented a linear time algorithm
(Theorem 1) to find all such maximal length Extremely
Conserved Elements, provided that one insists on
conservation across all the aligned species. In contrast,
we showed that, for the general case of conservation
across an arbitrary subset of the species, the question of
whether there is an Extremely Conserved Element is NPcomplete (Theorem 4), so it is unlikely an efficient
algorithm exists for this general case [8]. This is true
even in the special case of a gapless multiple sequence
alignment.

Of the genes containing EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements that
do not contain nor are adjacent to either ultraconserved
elements of Bejerano et al. [1] nor the larger set of
constrained human-rodent elements of Visel et al. [4],
three are particularly notable because their functions are
closely related to the GO term enrichments discussed
near the beginning of this section. NLGN1 on human
chromosome 3 contains an intronic EC(40, 100, 0.8)
element and is involved in nervous system development.
In particular, this gene encodes a member of a family of
neuronal cell surface proteins that may be involved in
the formation and remodeling of central nervous system
synapses. WHSC1L1 on human chromosome 8 contains
a partially coding EC(40, 100, 0.8) element and is
involved both in regulation of transcription and in cell
differentiation. More specifically, this gene encodes a
histone methyltransferase that preferentially methylates
K4 and K27 of histone H3, which are epigenetic tags for
transcriptional regulation. RBM5 on human chromosome 3 contains a partially coding EC(40, 100, 0.8)
element and, like many other genes with such coding
elements, is involved in RNA processing. In particular,
this gene encodes a component of the spliceosome A
complex and regulates alternative splicing of a number
of mRNAs, including FAS and CASP2/caspase-2 in the
apoptosis process. In the case of FAS, it promotes
exclusion of exon 6, producing a soluble form of FAS
that inhibits apoptosis. In the case of CASP2/caspase-2,
it promotes exclusion of exon 9, producing a catalytically
active form of CASP2/Caspase-2 that induces apoptosis.
These three genes, NLGN1, WHSC1L1, and RBM5, are
just some of the genes containing extremely conserved
elements that were not uncovered in previous studies of
ultraconservation.

Finally, we illustrated the linear time algorithm by
identifying all Extremely Conserved Elements with s =
40, t = 100, and c = 0.8 in the currently available
44-vertebrate whole-genome alignment. The resulting
177 EC(40, 100, 0.8) elements demonstrate many of
the characteristics of the original ultraconserved elements [1].

Conclusions
The notion of ultraconserved element was introduced
by Bejerano et al. [1] to point out that there are certain

Methods
In this section we describe two novel filters that make the
application of Theorem 1 to whole-genome alignments
feasible. Whole-genome MULTIZ alignments are divided
into “alignment blocks” (Blanchette et al. [17]), where
each block contains some subset of the species aligned to
some region of the reference genome (human, in our
case). A common reason for a boundary between
alignment blocks is that some species enters or leaves
the alignment at that boundary point. Our first filter
simply reads through all the alignment blocks, retaining
only those containing at least 40 species.
In theory it is possible that an EC(40, 100, 0.8) element
could span an arbitrary alignment block B consisting of b
columns that was discarded by Filter 1, if there were
enough perfectly conserved columns among 40 species
before and after B to make up for b unconserved
columns. However, if b ≥ 50, this would mean that
there is also an EC(40, 100, 0.8) element on one side of
B or the other. Therefore, we next merge alignment
blocks as long as the separation between those blocks on
the human genome is less than 50 bp; a separation
greater than this signals the end of the current merged
block and the beginning of a new one. More specifically,
if A is the current merged block, C is the next alignment
block following A that was retained after Filter 1, and A
and C are separated by human sequence B with |B| < 50,
we append BC to the end of A and insert the gap
character “-” in row s of any alignment column of B or C
that was missing species s.

The running time of each phase of the algorithm (run on an Intel Xeon
Quad Core X7350 2.93 GHz with 132 GB RAM) is also shown.

We are now in a position to describe Filter 2, which is run
on each merged block independently. For the i-th
alignment column of the current merged block, let qi =
1 if column i has 40 or more equal characters (including
“-”), and qi = 0 otherwise. Run the algorithm of Theorem 2
on the resulting string q and c = 0.8 to identify the
maximum length substring d of q that contains at least
80% 1’s. Such a substring may not correspond to an EC
(40, 100, 0.8) element, because there is no assurance that
the set of 40 species is the same for each column, but any
EC(40, 100, 0.8) element must be contained in such a
substring of length at least 100. Filter 2, therefore,
discards any merged block for which |d| < 100.
On each merged block remaining after Filter 2, we now
exhaustively try all combinations of at least 40 species
and run the algorithm of Theorem 1 on each combination. In order to maximize the number of species in each
EC(40, 100, 0.8) element, we enumerate the combinations in decreasing order from 44 species down to 40
species. Whenever we find an EC(40, 100, 0.8) element,
we remove the longest such element for the current
combination of species, and then run Filter 2 again on
each of the two remaining pieces of the merged block,
discarding either such piece if it fails to pass Filter 2.
Note that this may sacrifice a longer EC(40, 100, 0.8)
element in preference for one with a greater number of
species if these elements overlap.

Table 2 shows the effectiveness of the two filters and the
total running time of each of the three phases of the
algorithm. Filter 1 removed all but 0.25% of its
alignment columns and, of the remaining columns,
Filter 2 removed all but 2.3%. Since the full exhaustive
algorithm on these remaining 220,646 alignment
columns still required 47 hours of computing time, it
is clear that the two filters are imperative.
The source code was written in Python and is available
