Abstract
Background: Serine/threonine kinases (STKs) have been found in an increasing number of
prokaryotes, showing important roles in signal transduction that supplement the well known role
of two-component system. Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic prokaryotes able to grow in a
wide range of ecological environments, and their signal transduction systems are important in
adaptation to the environment. Sequence information from several cyanobacterial genomes offers
a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of this kinase family. In this
study, we extracted information regarding Ser/Thr kinases from 21 species of sequenced
cyanobacteria and investigated their diversity, conservation, domain structure, and evolution.
Results: 286 putative STK homologues were identified. STKs are absent in four Prochlorococcus
strains and one marine Synechococcus strain and abundant in filamentous nitrogen-fixing
cyanobacteria. Motifs and invariant amino acids typical in eukaryotic STKs were conserved well in
these proteins, and six more cyanobacteria- or bacteria-specific conserved residues were found.
These STK proteins were classified into three major families according to their domain structures.
Fourteen types and a total of 131 additional domains were identified, some of which are reported
to participate in the recognition of signals or substrates. Cyanobacterial STKs show rather
complicated phylogenetic relationships that correspond poorly with phylogenies based on 16S
rRNA and those based on additional domains.
Conclusion: The number of STK genes in different cyanobacteria is the result of the genome size,
ecophysiology, and physiological properties of the organism. Similar conserved motifs and amino
acids indicate that cyanobacterial STKs make use of a similar catalytic mechanism as eukaryotic
STKs. Gene gain-and-loss is significant during STK evolution, along with domain shuffling and
insertion. This study has established an overall framework of sequence-structure-function
interactions for the STK gene family, which may facilitate further studies of the role of STKs in
various organisms.

Background
Cyanobacteria, dating back 2.5–3.5 billion years and constituting a single but large taxonomic and phylogenetic
group within the domain Eubacteria [1], are characterized
by their ability to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis.
Moreover, fossilized cyanobacteria appear similar in form
to extant species [2]. Cyanobacteria have a pronounced
variation in genome size from 1.6 Mb to 9.2 Mb and
exhibit extraordinary diversity in terms of morphology
and cell activity. They also exhibit the widest range of
diversity in ecological habitats of all photosynthetic
organisms, including environments that are extremely
hot, extremely cold, alkaline and acidic, marine, freshwater, saline, terrestrial, and symbiotic [3]. Prochlorococcus
marinus, which has the smallest genome size and can be
divided into two distinct ecotypes (high-light adapted and
low-light adapted), is the dominant photosynthetic
prokaryote in the open ocean [4]. The diazotrophic filamentous cyanobacteria have the largest genome sizes and
include strains isolated from fresh water (Anabaena
PCC7120), from a plant-cyanobacterial symbionsis (Nostoc punctiforme PCC73102), or from tropical and subtropical oceans (Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101).
Crocosphaera, a novel genus of marine unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium, and Gloeobacter, a rod-shaped
unicellular cyanobacterium isolated from calcareous
rocks, have larger genome sizes (6.3 Mb and 4.6 Mb) than
other unicellular cyanobacteria.
The diversity of cyanobacteria is also reflected in the complexity of their signal transduction systems. To cope with
changing environmental conditions, cyanobacteria have
developed a variety of adaptive mechanisms to respond to
external or internal changes. Two-component signal transduction systems, characterized by the transfer of phosphate by a sensor kinase from a His residue on the enzyme
to an Asp residue on the response regulator, are widely
distributed among bacteria [5,6]. One-component systems, defined as proteins that contain known or predicted
input and output domains in a single protein molecule
but lack histidine kinase and receiver domains, are considered to be the pre-eminent mechanism for signal transduction in bacteria and archaea, except for cyanobacteria
[7]. In contrast, the Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases (STKs)
serve as the backbone of the eukaryotes transduction network. However, with the first identification of an STK in
Myxococcus xanthus in 1991 [8], regulatory STKs have been
repeatedly identified in prokaryotes. Protein phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues in cyanobacteria was
first revealed by radioactive labeling of proteins in 1994
[9]. Numerous bacterial STK genes have since been predicted within genome sequences [10-12], and they have
been associated primarily with three different processes,
namely regulation of development, stress responses, and
pathogenicity.

According to Hanks and Hunter, canonical Ser/Thr protein kinases contain 12 conserved subdomains [13] that
fold into a common catalytic core structure, as revealed by
the 3-dimensional structures of several protein-serine
kinases. These 12 conserved sequence motifs, about 280
amino acids in length, are named as subdomains I-V, VIa,
VIb and VII-XI [13,14]. There are three structural subdomains with separate roles: N-terminal nucleotide-binding domains containing subdomains I-IV, C-terminal
phosphotransfer and protein-substrate-binding domains
containing subdomains VIa-XI, and the intervening linker
containing subdomain V [15]. In addition to the conserved catalytic domains, some STKs contain at least one
additional domain, such as FHA, WD40, PAS and GAF
[16], which may endow STKs with more complicated
functions. For example, the FHA domain can participate
in a wide range of processes in bacteria, such as intracellular signal transduction, transcription, protein transport,
DNA repair, and protein degradation. Moreover, there is a
near-perfect correlation between the presence of FHA-containing proteins and Ser/Thr kinases and phosphatases in
bacterial genomes [17].
In cyanobacteria, mutation analyses have revealed the
functions of some STKs, such as SpkA and SpkB involved
in the cellular motility in Synechocystis PCC6803 [18,19],
and PknD involved in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in Anabaena PCC7120 [20]. A complete signaling
pathway involving a bacteria STK remains to be described,
but one may anticipate that some STKs are important or
even essential in regulating bacterial activities.
As of January 2007, 19 cyanobacterial genomes have been
fully sequenced and 6 are in the draft stages. In addition,
more than 20 genomes are in the process of being
sequenced. The availability of multiple sequenced
genomes has been very helpful in phylogenetic and functional studies of cyanobacterial genes, such as those in
restriction-modification systems [21] and two-component systems [22]. Comparative genome analysis has been
employed in the study on STKs in archaea [15], mycobacteria [23] streptomyces [24] and cyanobacteria [25,26].
Here we present a detailed analysis of the repertoire of
STKs in sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. An attempt
has been made to identify all STK sequences encoded in
the 19 fully sequenced genomes and 2 draft sequences
(Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 and Nostoc punctiforme
PCC73102). An analysis of STK sequences according to
their classifications, conservation, domain organization,
phylogeny and evolution are presented in this paper, aiming towards a deep understanding of the biological role of
STKs in cyanobacteria.

Results
Identification of STK proteins
The 21 cyanobacterial genomes fully available from IMG
database (Version 2.0, as of Jan 2007) were considered in
our analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1). Synechococcus elongatus
PCC6301 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 are virtually identical except for a chromosomal inversion, but
both were included in our analysis. Using BlastP and
TBlastN programs to look for proteins similar to proven
cyanobacterial STKs, we obtained 303 protein sequences
from the 21 cyanobacterial genomes, 284 of which were
originally annotated as protein kinase or Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase. The remaining 19 proteins were
accepted as STKs in this study after sequence alignment
and SMART analysis [27]. Seventeen out of these were
originally annotated not by their STK domains but by
other additional domains, such as ATPase and WD40
repeats, and the last two were annotated as hypothetical
proteins [16].

17 proteins, all originally annotated as STKs, from the 303
proteins identified by sequence similarity lack all or part
of at least one important catalytic domains [13], and these
were excluded from further consideration. Some slightly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/395

truncated proteins, such as CwatDRAFT_6607 and
CwatDRAFT_1979, lacking structural motifs I, II or XI but
possessing all catalytic motifs were retained. Nine proteins (including four STKs in marine unicellular Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, 6803_slr1443, CwatDRAFT_090
1, Tery_0088, Tery_4781 and Ava_3867) exhibit some
deviations from the canonical motifs (Fig. 2) that were
deemed tolerable. In all 286 putative STK sequences were
considered in this study (Table 1).
The number of STK genes within the different cyanobacterial genomes varies considerably, from 0 to 56. Only one
STK gene was found within the 5 fully sequenced Prochlorococcus marinus strains, in strain MIT9313. Eight out of
nine sequenced Synechococcus strains contain STKs, with
the marine Synechococcus strain WH8102 being the only
exception. Three marine Synechococcus strains CC9902,
CC9605, and CC9311 contain only one STK gene for
each. Two Synechococcus elongatus strains PCC6301 and
PCC7942, which are virtually identical in sequence, have
five pairs of orthologous STK genes. More STK genes were
found in the thermophilic Synechococcus strains JA-3-3Ab
(8), JA-2-3Ba (8), and BP-1 (10). The other two unicellular cyanobacterial strains, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421

and Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501, have 14 and 28 STK
genes respectively.
Filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria have the largest
number of STK genes (40 for Trichodesmium erythraeum
IMS101, 48 for Anabaena PCC7120, 53 for Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, and 56 for Nostoc punctiforme
PCC73102). Among the unicellular cyanobacteria, the
nitrogen-fixing unicellular strain Crocosphaera WH8501
has the biggest genome, the largest number of STKs and
the highest percentage (0.52%) of STKs within proteinencoding genes (Fig. 1). STKs in Prochlorococcus MIT9313
represent only 0.04% of the total proteins, while in Anabaena ATCC29413, the percentage is twenty-fold higher at

0.85%. It is evident from these findings that filamentous
diazotrophic cyanobacteria contain more STK genes than
unicellular species (T-test, p < 0.001), and the number of
STK genes is overrepresented in their genomes even after
allowing for their larger genome sizes (Fig. 1).
Conserved domain features
The core catalytic domain contains 12 conserved subdomains, within which a total of 12 amino acids are
invariant or nearly invariant in eukaryotes: two G residues
in subdomain I, K in subdomain II, E in subdomain III, D
and N in subdomain VIb, D and G in subdomain VII, E in
subdomain VIII, D and G in subdomain IX, and R in subdomain XI [13]. In cyanobacteria, 12 similar conserved

Conserved domains and sites in cyanobacterial STKs according to Hanks and Hunter. A total of 32 sequences were
used in the alignment of cyanobacterial STKs: 12 sequences in purple were selected to cover the diversity of species and structural characteristics; 6 sequences in red are of proteins reported to possess phosphorylation or autophosphorylation activity; 5
sequences in yellow were not originally annotated as protein kinases or Serine/Threonine Protein Kinases; and 9 sequences in
green were those showing some deviations from the canonical domains of Hanks and Hunter [13]. Each sequence is denoted by
the species name followed by the gene names. The 12 conserved subdomains are indicated by Roman numerals according to
Hanks and Hunter. Highly conserved eukaryotic and cyanobacteria-specific amino-acid residues are indicated above and below
the alignment sequences respectively, using the single-letter amino-acid classes of Hanks and Hunter. Symbols, used to denote the
various features according to Hanks and Hunter, are as follows: uppercase letters, universally conserved amino acid residues;
lowercase letters, highly conserved amino acid residues; o, positions conserving non-polar residues; *, positions conserving polar
residues; +, positions conserving small residues with near neutral polarity; and -, positions within a subdomain with no pattern of
conserved amino acids. The number in parentheses preceding each sequence refers to the number of amino acid residues preceeding the sequence shown.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:395

subdomains were found and 10 residues are conserved
well, with the exception of the two G residues in subdomain I, which are common but not invariant. It should
be noted that additional conserved amino acids appear in
cyanobacterial subdomains I, III, V, VIa, VIb, VII, VIII and
IX (Fig. 2).
In eukaryotes, subdomain I serves as the ATP binding site
(P-loop) and is characterized by the sequence GXGXXG.
Cyanobacterial STKs are divergent in this motif with only
152 (53.3%) sequences exactly conserved in this domain,
but 94.4% of them contain at least one Gly. It is possible
that STKs lacking a conventional subdomain I may
employ high energy phosphate compounds other than
ATP, as does a PK from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius that was
reported to use polyphosphate as phosphoryl donor
[28,29]. Besides the conserved Gly, cyanobacterial subdomain I differs from its eukaryotic counterpart in that it
starts at Tyr (93% of all cyanobacterial sequences) and
ends with a non-polar residues (99%).
The Lys (96.1%) in subdomain II is important for maximal catalytic activity and helping anchor and orient ATP,
and it is well conserved in cyanobacteria. But the
upstream Ala described by Hanks and Hunter [13] is generally replaced by a different non-polar residue (97.2%).
In subdomain III, Glu (86.0%) is not conserved well and
is substituted by Gln in 27 sequences belonging to cyanobacterial Family III (cbSTKIII, details in section Structure
and function). Upstream of the Glu, a conserved nonpolar residue (99.3%) was found and most of them were
Phe (87.7%).
Cyanobacterial subdomain V is much more conserved
than the eukaryotic counterpart, which has no invariant
residues. In contrast, the cyanobacterial subdomain possesses a highly conserved Gly (94.1%). This conserved residue may help anchor ATP by forming hydrogen bonds.
Gly is also conserved in other bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces
coelicolor [24]). In eukaryotes, subdomain VIa contributes
to structural stabilization and possesses only a relatively
conserved His. In cyanobacteria, besides this His (88.1%),
a more conserved Leu (97.2%) has been found, which is
also conserved well in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [23].
Subdomain VIb, a candidate for direct catalysis, is the
most conserved motif in eukaryotes and is characterized
as "hrDxkxxN". Cyanobacterial subdomain VIb is more
conserved and is characterized as "HrDikPxN". His
(100%) is the most conserved residue, followed by Asn
(98.9%), Pro (98.6%), Asp (97.2%), Lys (86.7%), Ile
(82.5%) and Arg (73.8%). Pro is also conserved in other
bacteria, such as Streptomyces coelicolor [24] and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [23]. STKs are also referred as "RD"
kinases because their activation requires the Arg and cata-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/395

lytic Asp in this subdomain. In cyanobacteria, however,
Arg is not conserved well and it can be substituted by Lys,
Gly, Cys or Gln. All members of cyanobacterial Family III
(cbSTKIII) belong to the family of "KD" kinases. There are
five cyanobacterial STKs lacking the highly conserved D, a
candidate for the catalytic base. Among these five putative
STKs, SpkE (Slr1443), which also lack of several other
conserved residues, did not show any kinase activity [30].
Whether the other four could phosphorylate or not may
need more experimental proofs.
Subdomain VII helps to orient the γ phosphate of ATP for
transfer and is characterized by a conserved DFG triplet.
The invariant Asp in subdomain VII, as well as the invariant Lys in subdomain II, was found to anchor and orient
ATP [13]. In cyanobacteria, Asp (97.2%) and Phe (97.9%)
are highly conserved but Gly (87.4%) less so. In 30 STK
proteins from cyanobacterial Family III (cbSTKIII), Gly is
substituted by Ser. The Lys residue often found in eukaryotes before the DFG triplet is not conserved in cyanobacteria, and the residues with near neutral polarity were
replaced by non-polar ones (95.1%).
The typical subdomain VIII includes a highly conserved
PE motif and plays a major role in the recognition of peptide or protein substrates. In cyanobacteria, the Pro residue (62.2%) of this motif is not well conserved, and the
Glu residue (97.5%) is followed by a conserved Gln residue (90.5%) of unknown function. The PE motif in
archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes may represent an
ancient and universal substrate recognition mechanism.
In subdomain IX, besides the Asp (99.3%), Gly (84.6%)
and Pro (90.2%) residues conserved in eukaryotes,
another three conserved amino acids were found: Thr
(90.9%), Leu (87.0%) and Gly (80.1%). Gly is also conserved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [23] and Streptomyces
coelicolor [24].
In cyanobacteria there are six STKs, SpkA (Sll1574) [18],
SpkB (Slr1697) [19], SpkC (Slr0599), SpkD (Sll0776),
SpkF (Slr1225) [30], PknC (All4813) [31], which have
been shown to phosphorylate themselves or other substrate proteins. From the sequence alignment it can seen
that all six of these STKs have sequences that are in accordance with the conserved features found in cyanobacteria
(Fig. 2).
Structure and function
Cyanobacterial STKs were classified according to structural characteristics into three major families: cbSTKI,
cbSTKII and cbSTKIII (Fig. 3).

Cyanobacterial STK Family I (cbSTKI) groups together the
155 (54.2%) STK proteins that possess no identifiable

domain besides that associated with core catalysis. This
family was further divided into three subfamilies. Subfamily I (cbSTKI-I) contains 35 proteins with fewer than
400 amino acids long and may be considered to possess
the basic structure supplemented in other families by
additional domains. Proteins in this family are found
only in Gloeobacter PCC7421, Crocosphaera WH8501 and
the four filamentous diazotrophic strains. Subfamily II
(cbSTKI-TM) contains 13 proteins and is named for their
3 to 6 transmemberane (TM) domains behind the STK
domains. These 13 proteins are distributed amongst unicellular Synechocystis PCC6803, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1, Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501 and the four
filamentous diazotrophic strains. Subfamily III (cbSTKI-

other) consists of 107 STK proteins distributed amongst
all 16 strains, each protein with more than 400 amino
acids and possessing a long unidentified C-terminal
domains. The functions of two cbSTKI proteins in Synechocystis PCC6803 and three in Anabaena PCC7120 have
been confirmed by experiment. In Synechocystis PCC6803,
Sll1574 (SpkA, I-other) was found to be involved in regulating cellular motility via phosphorylation of membrane
proteins [18]. No phenotype defect could be discerned in
a knockout mutant of Slr0599 (SpkC, I-other); however
the protein was demonstrated to phosphorylate itself and
some general substrate proteins [30]. In Anabaena
PCC7120, Alr4366 (PknA, I-other) showed a complex
pattern of regulation during heterocyst development [32],

Page 9 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:395

and Alr4368 (PknD, I-other) appeared essential for normal growth under diazotrophic conditions [20]. The function of Alr3732 (PknE, I-other) is known to be required
for the formation of heterocyst envelope structures and
nitrogen fixation [33].
Cyanobacterial STK Family II (cbSTKII) includes 92
(32.2%) proteins from 12 cyanobacterial species and are
defined as those STK proteins that possess at least one
additional domain in addition to their STK domains but
do not possess Hik kinase domains. The additional
domains with distinct functions are prevalent in protein
kinases and phosphatases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
signal transduction systems. In total, 14 types of additional functional domains were identified in cyanobacterial STKs: PAS, PAC, GAF, ANF, WD40, FHA, GUN4, TPR,
DUF323, PbH1, CHASE2, Pentapeptide, RDD, and SH3b.
Most are involved in known signaling proteins and play
various functions in the signal transduction process. For
example, TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat), which are
repeated in chaperone, cell-cycle, transcription, and protein transport complexes, form signaling domains in
higher eukaryotes and may participate in the aggregation
of proteins into multi-protein complexes [34]. GAF
domains (cyclic GMP, adenylyl cyclases, FhlA) are linked
to the binding of small-molecules, in particular the second messengers cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cGMP [35].
WD40 repeats, mainly in eukaryotic proteins, cover a wide
variety of functions, for example, in adaptor/regulatory
modules in signal transduction [36,37]. Finally, GUN4 is
thought to participate in plastid-to-nucleus signaling by
regulating magnesium-protoporphyrin IX synthesis or
trafficking [38]. There are also some domains with
unknown functions. These are found mainly in bacteria
and include DUF323, Pentapeptide, and RDD. The putative functions of most of these additional domains have
been described in detail by Krupa [25]. Most of these additional domains are located at C-terminal, with the exceptions of FHA and CHASE2.
Unicellular non-nitrogen-fixing strains have none or a
limited number of additional domains. TPR is identified
exclusively in Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421, and DUF323
is the most prevalent in Trichodesmium erythraeum
IMS101. Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501 has the lowest
percent of additional domains except for marine unicellular non-nitrogen-fixing strains (Fig. 1). Filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacteria not only contain vast number of
STKs but their STKs also recruit a diversity of additional
domains. The STKs of Anabaena PCC7120, for example,
contain 12 types of different additional domains. The
marine filamentous diazotrophic strain Trichodesmium
shows an exceptionally high percent (77.5%) and the
greatest number of additional domains. Pentapeptide
repeats, which have been found to participate in the accu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/395

mulation of glycolipids into the heterocysts [39], are prevalent in both unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria.
WD40, containing 6 or 7 repeats, are found exclusively in
nitrogen-fixing strains. Functions of three proteins in this
family have been identified. Alr2502 (Pkn22, PbH1) was
found to be associated with both iron-depletion and oxidative stress in Anabaena PCC7120 [40]. In Synechocystis
PCC6803, Slr1697 (SpkB, Pentapeptide) was shown to be
involved in the control of cell motility exclusive of positive phototaxis [19], and Sll0776 (SpkD, SH3b) could not
be knocked out completely, indicating that it is essential
for survival [30].
Kinases of STK Family III (cbSTKIII) are also named as
dual protein kinases, as they contain both N-terminal STK
domains and C-terminal His kinase domains, with at least
one GAF domain in between. They are encountered in
quite large numbers (38) in filamentous nitrogen-fixing
strains, with the exception of Trichodesmium erythraeum
IMS101, which possesses only one. This observation is
consistent with an earlier comparative study reporting
that GAF and PAS domains, possibly involved in signal
recognition, are extremely abundant in Anabaena: 87 GAF
domains in 62 ORFs and 140 PAS domains in 59 ORFs
[41]. The expression of one cbSTKIII protein, Alr2258
(HstK) from Anabaena PCC7120, has been shown to
depend on the type of available nitrogen source [42], and
the expression of two others, Alr0709 (Pkn40) and
Alr0710 (Pkn41), whose genes are adjacent along the
chromosome and co-transcribed, are induced by iron deprivation and are under the control of the global nitrogenregulator NtcA [43].
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the conserved
catalytic domains of STKs rather than their whole
sequences, as the additional domains with their possibly
separate evolutionary histories might confuse the phylogeny. The STK catalytic domains, about 280 amino acids in
length, were identified using SMART and CDD databases
[27,44].

The STK phylogenetic tree was rooted in the archaeal
STKs, deviating from the canonical view of the universal
phylogenetic tree rooted in eubacteria [45]. This STK phylogenetic tree indicates that these STK proteins display
complicated relationships, at odds with the phylogeny of
the species. STK proteins from the unicellular marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cluster together and have a
close relationship with Slr1443 from Synechocystis
PCC6803. STKs from the unicellular cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and Thermosynechococcus
elongatus BP1 are dispersed throughout the phylogenetic
tree. Seven pairs of STK orthologs are found in two Syne-

chococcus strains, JA-2-3Ba and JA-3-3Ab, that share a close
evolutionary relationship and are located at the bottom of
16S rRNA tree, along with Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421
(Fig. 1). STKs from Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and
Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421 each form several separate
clusters indicating obvious lineage-specific duplication
events in these strains. Most kinase sequences from Anabaena and Nostoc are orthologs for their close evolutionary
relationships, while the nonorthologous STK genes in
Anabaena and Nostoc may have been produced by recent
gene duplication or lateral transfer. This phylogenetic tree
shows also that cyanobacterial STKs do not cluster strictly
according to their structural characteristics, except for
members of cbSTKIII which are clustered together in a big
clade. Most STKs of cbSTKII do not cluster according to
their additional domains, while some with specific additional domains, such as Pentapeptide and WD40, do cluster together (Fig. 4).
Thirty-eight STKs in cbSTKIII belong to a large cluster that
also includes four STK proteins that do not contain HisKA
and ATPase domains and therefore have been placed in
other families. Tery_2857 and Tery_3863 have GAF
domains and belong to cbSTKII, while Tery_2107 and
Npun02008276 have only the STK domains and belong
to cbSTKI-other (Fig. 4). To test the evolutionary relationships amongst the catalytic domains of dual protein
kinases, their HiskA domains, and their GAF domains, a
detailed analysis was performed by constructing three separate phylogenetic trees (Fig. 5). Only two groups of
orthologs as defined by the catalytic domain (highlighted
in Fig. 5) clustered together in the other two phylogenetic
trees, indicating that two original genes were formed and
appeared in the lineage prior to the divergence of Nostoc
and Anabaena. Genes ancestral to orthologs that are conserved only in Anabaena PCC7120 and Anabaena
ATCC29413 are assumed to have formed before the divergence of these two strains. Apparent incongruities may be
explained by new recruitment or domain shuffling. For
example, the HiskA domain of N. punctiforme gene
Npun02001148 appears to have a distinct history from
the HiskA domains of Anabaena PCC7120 All0323 and
Anabaena ATCC29413 Ava_4716, but the three proteins
share a common history with respect to their catalytic and
GAF domains (see proteins highlighted in blue in Fig. 5)
The second GAF domains in All3691, Ava_3596,
Npun02004457, and Npun02004756 and the third GAF
domain in Npun02004457 bear only a distant relationships with other STK GAF domains in cyanobacteria,
including those in the same genes, indicating a recently
recruitment. Alr0709 and Alr0710 lie adjacent to each
other on the chromosome of Anabaena PCC7120 and
show 75% similarities, indicating a recently gene duplication.

Discussion
Ser/Thr protein kinases, members of signal transduction
systems, play important roles in responses to the environmental changes and intra-cellular signals [29]. This may
be vital for their host cyanobacteria, which originated
2.5–3.5 billion years ago and exhibit the widest range of
diversity in growth habitats of all photosynthetic organisms. Some of these kinases have demonstrated, in at least
one case, possibly essential roles, illustrated by Sll0776
(SpkD) in Synechocystis PCC6803 which could not be
completely knocked out [30].
The STK proteins used in this study were identified by
Local Blast rather than from the COG database in IMG,
and were manually checked to avoid false-negative and
false-positive hits that commonly arise during large-scale
automated analyses. Sequence alignment of conserved
catalytic domains show that cyanobacterial STKs contain
nearly the same subdomains as eukaryotic STKs but seem
to be more conserved except in subdomain I. Eukaryotic
STK proteins shared 12 nearly identical residues. Whereas
a total of 15 highly conserved (shared by >90%
sequences) sites were found in cyanobacteria, seven of
them were the same in eukaryotes. Such conserved motifs
and amino acids may provide useful targets to evaluate
their functions, and the high proportion of conserved res-

idues shared by both eukaryotic organisms and cyanobacteria indicate a quite similar mechanism for domain
organization and catalyzation.
Signal transduction systems provide basic mechanisms for
cellular responses to environmental changes and connect
environmental signals to cellular activities [29]. Thus different distributions of STKs through gene gain or loss may
reflect various environmental selective pressures. Such as
Synechococcus strains, which have similar genome size,
hold different numbers of STK genes from zero to ten
mainly for the different environmental conditions. Moreover, the number of STK genes in cyanobacteria is a function of the genome size, ecophysiology, and physiological
properties of organism, as has been noted in general for
bacteria [46,47]. STK genes are not ubiquitous in cyanobacteria. They are absent in four Prochlorococcus strains
and one marine Synechococcus WH8102. Previous study
showed that signal transduction and environmental stress
response systems are dramatically reduced in marine unicellular Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus [48], both of
whom live in the oligotrophic open ocean, and the major
driving force behind might be a selective process favoring
the adaptation of these cyanobacteria to adapt to the oligotrophic environment [49]. In contrast, filamentous heterocystous cyanobacteria, which differentiate heterocysts

Page 12 of 16

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:395

in response to the absence of combined nitrogen, and
which display physiological and ecological properties
including broad symbiotic competence with plants and
fungi [41], showed a disproportionate number of STK
genes.
Although Ser/Thr protein kinases were first discovered in
eukaryotes and are evidently more widely dispersed
amongst them, this is an insufficient basis to conclude
that STKs originated in eukaryotes and were obtained by
prokaryotes through lateral gene transfer. Zhang [50] and
Leonard [51] have demonstrated that an ancestral protein
kinase existed prior to the divergence of eucarya, bacteria,
and archaea. The phylogenetic tree from our analysis
shows STKs from archaea clustering at the root and cyanobacterial STKs clustering together with those from eukaryotes. The phylogenetic tree of cyanobacterial STKs, which
was constructed by their conserved catalytic domains, is
very complicated, and the distribution of STKs along the
tree does not follow their domain structures or species
phylogenies, indicating that frequent gene gain-and-loss
events in cyanobacteria may obscure the actual relationships of STKs.
Besides gene gain-and-loss, novel proteins could also be
generated by inserting or shuffling their domains. In these
21 cyanobacteria genomes, a total of 14 types of additional functional domains were found, much more than
in other bacteria such as Mycobacterium and Streptomyces
[23,24]. Additional domains are usually employed as sensor response modules [52-55] and can help organisms to
assemble a sophisticated signal transduction apparatus.
Their modularity may facilitate their spread into new
genes and the rapid creation of novel functions [17].
Some additional domains (e.g. TPR) may have existed in
the putative common ancestor of all life forms, and some
(e.g. FHA) are thought to have been transferred from
eukaryotes to bacteria [37]. Some prevalent additional
domains, such as pentapeptides that are widely distributed in bacteria, may have been obtained from the ancestor at an early evolutional stage. The species-specific
additional domains might have been recruited after speciation and duplicated recently, as in the example of the
DUF323 domain in Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101.
Four STKs with DUF323 domains of T. erythraeum_0640–
0643, which have high sequence similarities and neighbor
on the chromosome, are closest paralogues and might
have arisen from a recent duplication. STKs that cluster
together according to their conserved catalytic domains
do not always do so according to their additional
domains, indicating the lateral recruitment of additional
domains by STKs. A similar phenomenon was previously
observed regarding the GAF and PAS domains found in
PPM-family protein phosphatases in Streptomyces [56].
The two clusters with FHA and Pentapeptide domains are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/395

indicative of an early recruitment. GAF domains are prevalent in cyanobacterial two-component system and exist
in all sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. But different
STK orthologues did not recruit the same GAF and HiskA
orthologs. It is assumed that HiskA and GAF domains
were added to STK domains together and followed by
domain shuffling. Orthologs that are conserved in three
strains indicate their existence before the divergence of
Anabaena and Nostoc, and the orthologs conserved in only
two Anabaena strains suggest that they appeared before
the divergence of the two Anabaena strains and after the
split of Anabaena and Nostoc. Some sequences appear to
have lost the additional domains, and some appear to
have gained PAC and PAS domains, indicating that gene
shuffling, deletion and insertion, as well as gene duplication, occurred during evolution.
Results from PPM-family protein phosphatases in Streptomyces, showed that PAS and GAF domains were clustered
by physiological functions rather than taxonomic relationship [56]. So functions of substrate recognition in
cyanobacterial STKs may be conferred largely by their
additional domains too. For example, the CHASE
(cyclase/histidine kinase-associated sensing extracellular)
domain, always followed by three transmembrane
regions, is present in more than one type of sensory proteins and can recognize several signals, such as cytokines
and short peptides that are important for the development of an organism [57]. STKs, lacking transmembrane
regions and acting as a receptor-like protein kinase in the
cytoplasm, also appeared to have recruitted some additional domains such as FHA and GAF. The FHA domain is
thought to play roles in a wide range of processes, including intracellular signal transduction, transcription, protein transport, DNA repair, and protein degradation [12].
The GAF domain family, linked to the binding of second
messengers, is involved in cyclic nucleotide signaling,
transcription, phototransduction, and probably many
more unidentified processes [58]. Therefore, besides the
conserved catalytic domain, the additional domains also
play important roles in functions of kinases.

Conclusion
The availability of genome sequences provides a good
opportunity for comparative analysis of gene families.
Ser/Thr protein kinases have important effect on cyanobacteria living, as well as two component system. A total
of 286 putative STK genes have been identified from 21
species of cyanobacteria using BlastP, TblastN and ClustalW, and 19 were not annotated originally as STKs. The
number of STKs varied as a function of the genome size,
ecophysiology and physiological properties. Fourteen
types and 131 additional domains embedded in STK
genes may assist their signal recognition functions. A similar catalytic mechanism was inherited with conventional

conserved motifs, amino acids, and some uniquely cyanobacterial conserved residues. Gene duplication, loss, shuffling, insertion, and/or horizontal transfer appear to have
played important roles during the evolution of cyanobacterial STKs.

Methods
Twenty-one species of cyanobacteria, including Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Synechocystis, Crocosphaera, Gloeobacter, Trichodesmium, Anabaena and Nostoc were used in
this analysis. Since sequences of three Synechococcus
strains RS9917, WH5701, WH7805 and one Prochlorococcus marinus strain MIT9312 are not yet fully released, they
were not considered in our comparisons. All 21 genome
sequences (as of Jan 2007) were accessed from IMG [59]
in FASTA format. Four archaeal STK proteins in Methanopyrus kandleri AV19 were downloaded from the IMG database, and five eukaryotic STK proteins from human and
mouse were downloaded from NCBI [60].
In order to identify genes that may encode STKs, a set of
proven cyanobacterial STKs was used to search individual
cyanobacterial genomes. The proven cyanobacterial STKs
used were alr2502 (Pkn22) [40], alr4366 (PknA) [32],
all4813 (PknC) [31], alr4368 (PknD) [20], alr3732
(PknE) [33] from Anabaena PCC 7120, and sll1574
(SpkA) [18], slr1697 (SpkB) [19], slr0599 (SpkC) [30],
sll0776 (SpkD) [30] from Synechocystis PCC6803. Sll1574
(SpkA) is interrupted by an insertion element in the
sequenced strain, and in this paper "Sll1574" refers to the
reconstituted Sll1574-1575. BlastP and TblastN were conducted locally to search all proteins from each of the 21
cyanobacteria, using a threshold e-value of 1e-10. Proteins
found by this method that fit the criteria for a genuine STK
(see below) were added to the query set for another round
of Blast searches. The procedure was continued until no
new proteins were found.

Sequences of the catalytic domains (about 280 aa in
length) and additional domains used for phylogenetic
tree construction were obtained from the SMART database
and sequences with poor instances of Motif I and XI were
checked manually. Trees based on 16s rRNA, STK conserved catalytic domains, GAF domains (mean of 150–
200 aa), and HiskA domains (mean of 65–100 aa) were
constructed using NJ methods of the MEGA (Version 3.0)
package [63], and the reliability of each branch was tested
by 1000 bootstrap replications.

Proteins identified by Blast were aligned by using ClustalW program [58] with a gap opening penalty of 10, a gap
extension penalty of 0.2, and Gonnet as the weight matrix.
Alignment of query sets were examined by inspection of
apparent Motifs I through XI per Hanks and Hunter [13]
(Figure 2). A protein was accepted as an STK if it was possible to recognize the most conserved subdomains (i.e. II,
V, VIb, VII, VIII, IX, and XI) and if those conserved amino
acid residues known to participate in the function of STKs
were present. Some minor deviations were tolerated, considered on a case-by-case basis. The ultimate decision was
in the end subjective but in most cases quite clear cut.

using the SMART [27,61] and CDD (Conserved Domains
