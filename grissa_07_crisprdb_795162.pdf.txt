Abstract
Background: In Archeae and Bacteria, the repeated elements called CRISPRs for "clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats" are believed to participate in the defence against
viruses. Short sequences called spacers are stored in-between repeated elements. In the current
model, motifs comprising spacers and repeats may target an invading DNA and lead to its
degradation through a proposed mechanism similar to RNA interference. Analysis of intra-species
polymorphism shows that new motifs (one spacer and one repeated element) are added in a
polarised fashion. Although their principal characteristics have been described, a lot remains to be
discovered on the way CRISPRs are created and evolve. As new genome sequences become
available it appears necessary to develop automated scanning tools to make available CRISPRs
related information and to facilitate additional investigations.
Description: We have produced a program, CRISPRFinder, which identifies CRISPRs and extracts
the repeated and unique sequences. Using this software, a database is constructed which is
automatically updated monthly from newly released genome sequences. Additional tools were
created to allow the alignment of flanking sequences in search for similarities between different loci
and to build dictionaries of unique sequences. To date, almost six hundred CRISPRs have been
identified in 475 published genomes. Two Archeae out of thirty-seven and about half of Bacteria
do not possess a CRISPR. Fine analysis of repeated sequences strongly supports the current view
that new motifs are added at one end of the CRISPR adjacent to the putative promoter.
Conclusion: It is hoped that availability of a public database, regularly updated and which can be
queried on the web will help in further dissecting and understanding CRISPR structure and flanking
sequences evolution. Subsequent analyses of the intra-species CRISPR polymorphism will be
facilitated by CRISPRFinder and the dictionary creator. CRISPRdb is accessible at http://crispr.upsud.fr/crispr

Background
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPRs) have been described in a wide range of
prokaryotes, including the majority of Archaea and many
Bacteria. They consist in the succession of 24–47 bp
repeated sequences (often called direct repeats or DR) separated by unique sequences of a similar length (spacers)
[1-4]. Bona fide CRISPRs possess at one end a partial DR
and at the other end after the last DR a sequence of about
200 bp called the leader [5]. The origin of the spacers is
still largely unknown but several recent studies identified
some of them as fragments of foreign DNA mostly of viral
origin [6-9]. Analysis of a large number of Yersinia pestis
isolates has shown that these elements are sequentially
added in a polarised fashion next to the leader [8]. This
suggestion was further confirmed by observations in Sulfolobus solfataricus and in Streptococcus thermophilus [9,10].
A cluster of genes called cas (CRISPR-associated) are often
found in the vicinity of CRISPRs [5]. When several
CRISPRs with the same DR are present, only one is associated with cas genes. The exact number of cas genes is not
known and apparently varies from one strain to another.
However, a core of 4 genes is regularly identified, which
appears to encode proteins involved in DNA modification
and repair [11]. Phylogenetic studies performed on the
CAS proteins suggest that CRISPRs are acquired by horizontal transfer [12,13]. This is consistent with their presence on megaplasmids [12]. CRISPRs are non-coding
regions but different observations suggest that they are
transcribed into small RNAs (smRNA) possibly from the
leader acting as a promoter, and that they might play a
role as siRNA (small interfering RNA) to block the entry of
foreign sequences [10,11,14].
In order to gain further insight into the organisation and
behaviour of CRISPR loci it is necessary to perform extensive analyses of the available sequenced genomes. Several
studies have been performed, the most extensive being
that made on 370 prokaryotic genomes [12]. However,
these studies are static and considering the amount of
ongoing sequencing projects they are rapidly becoming
obsolete. The TIGRFAM database [15] provides information on CAS associated CRISPR loci but it is not dedicated
to CRISPR identification and will not report CRISPR structures devoid of neighbouring cas genes.
For the algorithmic detection of CRISPR patterns, several
methods were empirically applied previously, making use
of REPuter [13,16], PatScan [12,17], TRF [8,18], LUNA
[10], PYGRAM [19]. These programs are designed to find
repeats and are not especially conceived for CRISPR patterns finding, so they may provide the CRISPR location
but do not define accurately the consensus DR. The output of such tools requires significant manual discard to
eliminate background, and post-processing to define the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/172

consensus DR and the spacers. Recently, a CRISPR dedicated software tool called PILER-CR was described [20].
PILER-CR is based on an elegant algorithm that consists
mainly in producing piles meeting the CRISPR properties
from local alignments of the query sequence to itself. The
software tool has the advantage of being rapidly executed
but it sometimes misidentifies the DR boundaries and
omits the truncated DR.
Finally, using the available programs, "short" or "quite
short" CRISPRs (defined as containing less than three,
three or seven spacers [5,12,19]) are not considered.
Since future insights into the evolution of CRISPRs may
result from the investigation of these very small CRISPRs,
some of which may be newly emerging structures, it is
important to facilitate access to this enlarged, but much
more difficult to define, group.
We have developed tools to identify CRISPRs, select DR
and store spacers into dictionaries, and a database which
can be queried online at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr. The
CRISPRdb is automatically updated; in the May 2007 version, 475 published microbial genomes have been processed.

Construction and content
Database and software design and implementation
CRISPRdb and associated web services are implemented
in Perl version 5.8.8 [21] and take advantage of some
BioPerl [22] modules for manipulating sequences. They
run on an Apache 2.0 web server [23] with a Linux operating system (debian Sarge 3.1) [24]. The core application
consists of two main programs: CRISPRFinder to detect
CRISPRs and extract them from a genomic sequence, and
Database Tools for downloading prokaryotic genomes
from the NCBI ftp site [25], saving CRISPRs and making
updates.

The first program is a full command line tool written inhouse in Perl. It is used to process published genome
sequences and feed the CRISPR database. It can also be
run interactively through the web interface for submission
and analysis of users sequence data [26].
The second program is a set of Perl scripts. Downloading
of genomic sequences, CRISPRs detection and motifs
extraction are fully automated.
A web resource is built on top of these programs via PHP
[27] and Perl CGI scripts. This preserves platform independence across multiple operating systems and allows
the user to interact with the different CRISPR tools programs without computer programming or (shell) scripting skills.

The CRISPRs database (CRISPRdb)
CRISPRdb is a relational database implemented using
mysql 4.1 [28]. It utilizes the CRISPRFinder program to
identify putative CRISPRs and additional tests to further
screen for the smallest CRISPRs in a polyphasic approach.
Indeed the CRISPRFinder program is conceived to authorize the largest number of possible CRISPRs, especially the
shortest ones, containing one or two spacers. The main
idea of the program is to first find possible CRISPR localizations in a genomic sequence and then check if these
regions contain a cluster that possess the characteristics of
"obvious" CRISPR, i.e. containing at least three repeats.
Finding possible CRISPR localizations is achieved using
the Vmatch package to detect maximal repeats [29], that is
a repeat that cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a mismatch [16,30]. Reported matches must
have a size within 23 to 55 bp with one possible mismatch, and the gap size between two instances of a repeat
must be within 25 to 60 bp. The maximal repeats are clustered according to their position in the genome. In each
"cluster", the maximal repeat which is the most frequent
in the genome being processed is selected and "blasted"
against the cluster. Such a maximal repeat is a candidate
DR sequence, and when additional candidate DRs are
identified, a score is computed to select the DR resulting
in the minimum number of mismatches towards its
boundaries. This step is probably instrumental to achieve
a very precise identification of proper DR consensus compared to other programs. The related matches are then
extracted and tested as putative DRs of a CRISPR, so that
the first or the last match is allowed to be degenerated
with a maximal number of errors equal to half the match
length. This allows the efficient identification of the first,
often truncated, DR. The other matches must be globally
conserved at least to 80%. Finally two filters are added to
check the CRISPR candidates' structure. The first one eliminates clusters for which spacers length are not within the
range of 0.6× and 2.5× the DR length. In addition, CRISPR
candidates with more than 60% of similarity between
spacers (or between DR and spacer) are considered as tandem repeats and are eliminated by the second filter. The
selected criteria described above imply that the minimal
structure of a putative CRISPR detected by CRISPRFinder
should consist in at least two successive direct repeats
(one spacer) with a maximum of one mismatch. CRISPRs
of more than 2 spacers with three or more perfect repeats
are considered "confirmed CRISPR" whereas the shorter
CRISPRs are considered "questionable".

Currently, CRISPRdb is composed of 5 tables (Figure 1).
For storage in CRISPRdb (Figure 2), several additional
tests are applied to the questionable CRISPRs in order to
validate a maximum of them. First, a comparison of their
DR to previously identified DRs is performed (for example, CRISPR NC_006155_4 in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP
32953 with 2 spacers has the same DR as CRISPRs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/172

NC_006155_6 and NC_006155_7 in the same genome,
comprising respectively 4 and 16 motifs; CRISPR
NC_003272_3 in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 with only one
spacer, has the same DR as the CRISPR NC_007413_19 of
Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 comprising 33 spacers).
Then, a second filter is added to discard some of the non
significant short CRISPRs, consisting in a restriction on
the spacer allowed length, when the corresponding DR
has no classical flanking nucleotides such as GTTT or
GAAC.
Authorizing small CRISPR-like structures in the database
leads to an important amount of questionable data.
Therefore a colour code is being used to differentiate the
"confirmed CRISPR" shown in pink to the questionable
structures shown in grey. However, and importantly, each
time the database is updated, and new genomes are processed, DRs from all questionable structures are rechecked
against the updated DR database.
CRISPRs loci are identified from finished microbial
genome sequences (as listed by the Genome Online Database [31] and accessed from Genbank) and stored into the
database. This procedure is repeated monthly to update
the database.

browse the latest entries. The page which appears after
selecting a genome (step 1) indicates how many CRISPRs
have been found and on which replicon (chromosome or
plasmid) they are located. In the following page (step 2)
the CRISPR id is indicated together with its position on
the genome, the number of spacers and the consensus DR
sequence. Querying a CRISPR locus (step 3) leads to a
page containing detailed characteristics together with
sequence retrieval tools: the DR consensus is shown in
yellow, the spacers are shown in different colours,
together with their position in the genome, the flanking
sequences and the whole CRISPR locus sequence (using
the flanking sequence button). Flanking sequences are
displayed with flexible positions that may be modified
from the 100 bp default value. Spacers can be automatically compared to public sequences databases using
blastn. From this page one can access a flanking sequence

The database construction: from genomes to
CRISPRs. The first step consists in downloading prokaryotic genomes which are then submitted to the CRISPRFinder
program. The detected clusters are divided into two groups:
confirmed CRISPRs (>=3DRs) are stored in the database;
small questionable clusters (2 or 3 DRs) are analyzed by
blasting their conserved region (DR) against the approved
DRs; clusters with already identified DRs are added to the
CRISPR database. Remaining questionable CRISPRs are analysed for classical flanking nucleotides and spacers length
compared to the DR length. Clusters that do not fit these
criteria are deleted, the remaining are kept as questionable.
Manual discard of some sequences can be performed by the
database curator. Colour code: programs are shown in blue,
confirmed CRISPRs are in pink and questionable ones are in
grey.

Utility
CRISPRdb: construction and content
Figure 3 details some of the pages which can be viewed
when browsing the database [32]. On the home page
(extract, top left) is displayed an alphabetical list of Bacteria and Archaea strains for which genome sequence is
published, and a colour code indicates whether a CRISPR
has been detected or not: species without a CRISPR are
coloured in yellow, and species having at least one
CRISPR are coloured in pink. The list can also be sorted
according to taxonomic order, or according to database

Furthermore, the ability to upload pre-calculated files
(such as a summary of selected CRISPR properties or list
of spacers in Fasta format, step 4) makes the tool very flexible, as the output can be analysed with other bioinformatics resources.
The CRISPR utilities page [33]
This page provides a global overview of CRISPRs present
in the database, focusing on DRs and spacers (Figure 4).
Firstly, all identified DRs are listed with their size
expressed in base-pairs (bp), and the occurrences in the
database of DRs with similar sequences is indicated as
shown on the left panel of Figure 4. Selected DRs can be
aligned using CLUSTALW and a dendrogram is produced
(Figure 4 right panels).

Secondly a list of spacers encountered more than once
provides an easy way to identify for instance the relatively
rare occurrences of internal duplications within a CRISPR.
A BLAST (blastn) can be run using selected spacers against
public sequence databases (GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, PDB)
with a cutoff of 0.1 for the E-value and a matching length
of at least 70% the queried spacer size. Thirdly, this page
provides a classification of CRISPRs according to the
number of motifs. The CRISPR id provides the related
strain name on mouse-up and links to the page describing
the CRISPR properties. Links are also provided to the corresponding pre-computed lists of DRs and spacers which
can be downloaded as text files.
The BLAST CRISPRs page [34]
This page will be of use to try and validate a questionable
CRISPR. From this page, a candidate DR region (or spacer)
can be compared to all DRs (or spacers) characterised so

far from clear-cut CRISPR structures present in the database.
The Spacers Dictionary Creator page [35]
The analyses of CRISPRs in different strains of a species
has shown that polymorphism exists in the number and
nature of spacers [8-10,36,37]. This can be used to assess
the degree of polymorphism inside the species thus providing additional information for epidemiological analyses. For this reason, it is important to be able to extract
spacers from a sequence, and to store them into a database
that can be queried when new sequences are produced.
Upon submitting CRISPR sequences into the Spacer Dictionary Creator page, spacers are extracted and stored into
an Excel file, either predefined or newly created. When a

spacer is already present in the dictionary, its number
appears in the output whereas a new spacer will be given
a new number and will be added into the Excel file.

Discussion
Sensitivity and selectivity of CRISPRFinder
To build the CRISPRdb we have used a new program,
CRISPRFinder, specifically created to identify CRISPRs.
We checked that all the CRISPRs described in the literature
were detected with CRISPRFinder and, in addition, we
found that CRISPRFinder performs better than other
CRISPR finding tools in particular in defining the DR
boundaries and in identifying short CRISPRs. Among
available programs, we found that PILER_CR is the most
efficient. However, in the chromosome of Aquifex aeolicus

VF5 (NC_000918) for instance, PILER_CR (default
parameters: minarray 2, mincons 0.7, minid 0.85) detects
9 CRISPRs, three of which have misidentified DR boundaries and three are missing the truncated DR. In addition,
one CRISPR locus is missed because only CRISPRs of at
least three repeats are detected. CRISPR NC_000918_6
(one spacer) in the CRISPRdb was not detected by
PILER_CR although it has the same DR as CRISPRs
NC_000918_1, NC_000918_2, NC_000918_3 and
NC_000918_10 containing respectively 5, 4, 3 and 3
repeats). Furthermore, CRISPRFinder is capable of detecting CRISPRs which DRs contain multiple differences such
as NC_009009_1 and NC_009009_2 in Streptococcus sanguinis. Using the default parameters of PILER_CR no
CRISPR was detected in this bacterium. When parameters
were changed, only part of the CRISPRs were found. It will
be interesting in the future to check whether these excep-

tional CRISPRs and cas genes are functional. Conversely,
CRISPRFinder occasionally fails to exclude some false
positives. We manually analysed all the CRISPRs identified in the current version of the database and eliminated
a few false positive structures, principally tandem repeats
with a low internal conservation. We estimate these cases
to be less than 1% of "confirmed" CRISPRs.
Characteristics of CRISPRs
CRISPRdb has been constructed using public domain
genome sequences (unpublished sequences can be submitted to CRISPRFinder to detect CRISPRs and extract the
spacers). Sixty three percent (63%) of the structures qualifying as CRISPRs using the defined parameters possess 4
or less than 4 spacers. The majority of these are classified
as questionable. Their confirmation or exclusion as bona
fide CRISPR structures will require additional evidence,

such as the presence of a DR already described in a
CRISPR, the presence of cas genes in the vicinity or the
search for polymorphism within multiple isolates from
the same species.

DR length

Number of CRISPRs (percentage %)
Bacteria

We have chosen to restrict the definition of CRISPRs to
comprise DRs 23 to 55 bp-long and spacers 0.6 to 2.5 the
DR size because these sizes are in excess of the range of
previously described CRISPRs. These parameters do not
exclude CRISPRs also containing a subset of much larger
spacers as can be seen in Methanopyrus kandleri with spacers 51 to 72 bp-long. There are no clear rules defining the
limits of a DR or a spacer and we might be missing currently unknown CRISPRs with characteristics outside of
the range currently covered, even if the present rules were
deduced from the published investigation by various
means of more than 300 genomes. Should such CRISPRs
be observed in the future, the database, as designed, can
be easily adjusted.
Wide differences are observed among the CRISPRs, in the
DR sequence, its size and the size of the spacers. Table 1
summarizes the size distribution observed for DRs. Interestingly, in both Archaea and Bacteria, three well-separated size classes are observed: small DRs (24–25 basepairs), medium-size (28–30 bp) and large (36–37 bp).
The smaller DRs group is more represented in Archaea
(42% versus less than 2% for this size class in Bacteria)
and curiously it is also where the differences between DR
and spacer size are the largest. In Pyrobaculum aerophilum 7
CRISPRs have a 24 or 25 bp-long DRs whereas the spacer
sizes range from 38 to 53 bp. The longer spacers were
observed in Methanopyrus kandleri which possess 5
CRISPRS with DRs 35 or 36 bp-long and spacers 51 to 72
bp-long, as previously mentioned. In contrast, a remarkably constant spacer length is observed in some bacteria. In
Geobacter sulfureducens a single CRISPR with a 29 bp DR
possess one hundred and thirty eight 32 bp-long spacers
and three 33 bp-long spacers. A similar situation is
observed in Mycoplasma mobile and in Treponema denticola.
The longest DR presently found is 47 bp-long in the
CRISPR of Bacteroides fragilis. The associated spacers are
either 29 or 30 bp-long. This suggests that the precise
mechanisms producing spacers is different from one bacterium or archaeon to another although a common set of
CAS proteins is generally associated with all the CRISPRs.
The largest CRISPR locus was found in Verminephrobacter
eiseniae consisting of 245 repeats on one side and 45
repeats on the other side of an IS element (NC_008786_2
and NC_008786_3). The DR is 28 bp-long and the average spacer length is 32 bp. The longest CRISPR previously
described was NC_003869_3 from Thermoanaerobacter
tengcongensis MB4 with 217 repeats.

Only confirmed CRISPRs are counted. The first column shows the DR

respectively (the percentage of CRISPR DR having this length is
indicated). Only one strain per species is counted. In the last column,
the two populations of CRISPRs are merged. The last two lines are
respectively the total number of CRISPRs in each category, and the
average DR length.

col. [5] further suggested that the secondary structure
might play an essential biological role. A protein binding
on one side of the repeat and producing an opening of the
opposite side of the DNA structure was described in Sulfolobus solfataricus [38] and might be used in the processing of small RNAs [14]. A future development of our work
will be the analysis of all the DRs in search for a common
secondary structure that might help in understanding the
role of the DR.
Inside a species several strains can share a set of spacers,
but in a given CRISPR spacers are generally unique except
in a few cases where duplications of one to 7 motifs (a DR
and a spacer) were observed [33]. Apparently, duplications are more frequently observed in Archaea as
described in detail by Lillestol et al. [10].
It is important to note that the absence of CRISPR in one
strain does not imply that CRISPRs are absent from all the
members of the corresponding species. However in some
species or genus no CRISPR has been identified yet
although a number of strains have been fully sequenced.
This is the case for example in Staphylococcus aureus and
Burkholderia sp.

Mojica and col. [4] observed the existence of terminal and
inner-inverted repeats in the DR sequence, and Jansen and

Multiplication of CRISPR
It is believed that CRISPR and associated genes cas can be
horizontally transferred between bacteria of different species and possibly between Archaea and Bacteria. This is
strongly suggested by comparison of CAS protein
sequences, but it does not explain how several CRISPRs
with a similar DR can be present in a single genome, only
one of which being associated with cas genes. The small
CRISPRs are particularly interesting in this respect to try
and elucidate the mechanism of creation of a new CRISPR
and of insertion of new motifs in an existing CRISPR. For
example in Clostridium tetani among eight CRISPRs possessing 1 to 33 motifs, seven are clustered between position 1570766 and 1595950 (spanning 25.184 bp), five of
which with exactly the same DR and two with a derivative
(6 different nucleotides out of 30). The leaders of the
seven clustered CRISPR aligned over about 150 bp with
80% similarity, cas genes are present once between
CRISPR 5 and CRISPR 6 and no spacer is in common. It is
then most likely that starting from an ancestral complete
CRISPR and cas genes locus, new CRISPRs have been created not by duplication of the complete complex but
rather by the insertion of a minimum structure comprising a leader sequence, a DR, and no spacer, which then
grows by adding new motifs. This absence of common
spacers even when several CRISPRs are present in a single
Bacteria or Archea is also suggesting that gene conversion
is not a significant process for new motif acquisition.
The CRISPR intra-species polymorphism: insight into the
mechanism of acquisition of new motifs
We developed the spacer dictionary tool to facilitate the
extraction of spacers and their analysis, principally for
phylogenetic studies. To better demonstrate the efficiency
of this tool we propose a demonstrator based on the
sequences of five Y. pestis genomes. An initial dictionary
was first created from the 26 published spacers, named
using the alphabet from "a" to "z" [8]. The CRISPRs of
newly sequenced alleles as could be derived from
sequencing the locus in a collection of diverse strains can
be submitted to the dictionary tool in fasta format. The
spacers which were not already present in the dictionary
are given a number and they are added sequentially into
the dictionary. The alleles are coded in a convenient way
using this dictionary.

In our previous study of three CRISPRs in 180 Y. pestis isolates, most of which were genetically very similar, we
described the polymorphism at each locus due to different
number of motifs [8]. Our observations suggested that
one or several motifs could be lost by precise deletion
between 2 DRs whereas new motifs were added precisely
at the level of the last DR flanking the leader. A similar
suggestion was made based upon observations in S. solfataricus P1 and in S. thermophilus [9,10]. This mechanism is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/172

further supported by the analysis of the structure of some
CRISPRs in which a first series of motifs containing a particular DR is followed by motifs with a DR differing at a
single nucleotide up to the last one near the leader. For
example in the CRISPR NC_005085_3 of Chromobacterium violaceum, 13 motifs with DR "GTGTTCCCCACGTGCGTGGGGATGAACCG" are followed by 6 motifs with
DR
"GTGTTCCCCACGCCCGTGGGGATGAACCG".
Another interesting example is found in Carboxydothermus
hydrogenoformans where two CRISPRs, NC_007503_3 and
NC_007503_4 (59 and 84 spacers respectively) share the
same 30bp-DR, although in one of them the last 13
repeats adjacent to the leader have a modified DR. The
first three bases of the DR are absent whereas the three
bases AAC are added to the other end to produce a modified DR (Figure 5). This suggests that at some point the
last DR plus 3 bases of a newly added spacer were duplicated to create a new DR which then served as a matrix for
subsequent duplications. Alternatively, the AAC addition
could be the result of some stuttering since the initial DR
ends by AAAAC (and the modified DR by AAAACAAC).
These observations are in favour of the model of polarised
sequential insertion of new motifs by duplication of the
last DR and insertion of a new spacer [8,10], rather than
random insertion by homologous recombination as proposed by Makarova et al. [11]. If the newly copied last DR
contains a mutation, compatible with CRISPR metabolism, then this mutation will be copied in all subsequent
motif acquisitions.

Future developments
Further development of our software will include new
parameters to analyse genomes for which only questionable structures were detected. An additional aspect will be
the identification of minimum CRISPRs structure, devoid
of spacers and comprising only a DR and leader.

Conclusion
The described software and database are exclusively
devoted to the identification and the analysis of CRISPRs
structures, i.e. the succession of motifs made up of DRs
and spacers. A database for cas gene identification has
been developed by TIGR [15]. We have added a link to
this web page in order to search for the presence of cas
genes in the vicinity of a CRISPR.

CRISPRs are fascinating structures, which conceal complex biological mechanisms to account for their transfer,
evolution and behaviour. They have probably played an
important role in the evolution of Archaea and Bacteria by
providing a defence mechanism against foreign DNA. A
lot remains to be discovered, and this necessitates the possibility to rapidly investigate newly sequenced genomes,
and to be able to easily browse across many different species. The CRISPRdb and associated web service provides
all the necessary tools to decipher the organisation of
these structures. Several studies have shown that when an
origin can be found for a spacer, it is most frequently a
virus or a plasmid sequence. Thus the spacer database will
serve as a repository of sequences of probable viral or plasmid origin. Finally the intra-species polymorphism of
CRISPRs and their evolution mode (organised acquisition
and loss of motifs) make them interesting tools for epidemiological studies. The possibility exists that a given
spacer be added twice independently into a CRISPR,
which could hamper its use for phylogenetic studies.
However the polarized addition of motifs, and limited
events of recombination insure that their order should be
preserved. In Y. pestis we believe that they could be used to
investigate ancient DNAs (Vergnaud et al. in press).
