Abstract
Background: Salivary proteins from sandflies are potential targets for exploitation as vaccines to
control Leishmania infection; in this work we tested the hypothesis that salivary proteins from
geographically distant Phlebotomus duboscqi sandfly populations are highly divergent due to the
pressure exerted by the host immune response. Salivary gland cDNA libraries were prepared from
wild-caught P. duboscqi from Mali and recently colonised flies of the same species from Kenya.
Results: Transcriptome and proteome analysis resulted in the identification of the most abundant
salivary gland-secreted proteins. Orthologues of these salivary proteins were identified by
phylogenetic tree analysis. Moreover, comparative analysis between the orthologues of these two
different populations resulted in a high level of protein identity, including the predicted MHC class
II T-cell epitopes from all these salivary proteins.
Conclusion: These data refute the hypothesis that salivary proteins from geographically distinct
populations of the same Phlebotomus sandfly species are highly divergent. They also suggest the
potential for using the same species-specific components in a potential vector saliva-based vaccine.

Background
Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease transmitted by
Phlebotomine sandflies. The Leishmania parasite develops to an infective form inside the gut of the sandfly and
is injected together with saliva into a mammalian host
during blood feeding. Components present in sandfly
saliva, as well as in the saliva of other arthropod vectors,
have been shown to contain potent anti-hemostatic and
immunomodulatory activities [1], and are able to
enhance Leishmania infection [2]. Salivary proteins therefore are potential candidates for vaccines to control vector-borne diseases.

duboscqi from two different locations, Mali and Kenya to
test the hypothesis that sandfly salivary proteins from two
geographically distinct but conspecific populations are
very divergent due to the immune pressure exerted by the
mammalian host. Moreover, the degree of similarity in
the salivary proteins from a sand fly species originating
from two different geographic locations was never investigated. Knowledge of the latter is an important aspect of
vaccine development, where target proteins should
exhibit a degree of conservancy within the species across
its distribution range to be viable vaccine candidates.

Results and discussion
Immune responses to either sandfly salivary gland
homogenate [3,4] or to the bites of sandflies [5] have been
shown to protect animals against Leishmania infection.
Two molecules isolated from the saliva of sandflies have
been shown to confer this protection, one named "maxadilan" is a vasodilatory and immunomodulatory molecule present in the saliva of Lutzomyia longipalpis [6-8], and
the other called PpSP15, is a molecule present in the saliva
of Phlebotomus papatasi [9]. Maxadilan injected together
with parasites was shown to enhance Leishmania major
infection in laboratory animals as compared to injection
with Leishmania major alone, and vaccination with maxadilan reversed this effect and protected animals against L.
major infection [7]. Animals vaccinated with PpSP15 salivary protein developed a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity response to this protein that was sufficient to protect
them against L. major infection since B-cell deficient animals vaccinated with PpSP15 were also protected [9].
The sand fly Phlebotomus duboscqi is a proven vector of L.
major in Sub-Saharan Africa from Ethiopia to Senegal. It
belongs to the subgenus Phlebotomus together with P.
papatas, P. bergeroti and P. salehii. Electrophoretic profiles
of salivary proteins of P. duboscqi eastern populations
(Ethiopia) differ from western ones (Senegal) [10]. Cutaneous leishmaniasis has been reported in Northwest and
Northeast Mali and P. duboscqi was reported as the suspected vector [11]. Until now there has been no information available concerning the repertoire of salivary
proteins from this vector of disease, and the degree of
intraspecific homogeneity present in the salivary proteins
of conspecific specimens from two different geographic
locations. In was previously reported that the salivary protein maxadilan, from the Lutzomyia longipalpis sand fly,
was highly variable, up to 23% differences in amino acid
identity between different sandfly populations of sandfly
colonies derived from Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica
[12]. It was hypothesised that this variability was due to
antigenic polymorphism that ultimately would avoid the
host immune response and therefore neutralisation of a
salivary protein important in blood feeding [12]. In this
work we studied the salivary gland transcriptomes of P.

Sequencing of two salivary gland cDNA libraries collected
in East and West Africa
We constructed and sequenced two salivary gland cDNA
libraries from P. duboscqi collected in West Africa (Mali)
and East Africa (Kenya). The total number of high-quality
sequences analysed from the Mali cDNA library was 988
and from the Kenya cDNA library the sequence total was
924. The majority of the analysed transcripts from these
two cDNA libraries code for secreted proteins (Figure 1).
P. duboscqi Mali cDNA library (PduM) resulted in 77.7 %
of transcripts coding for secreted proteins, 11% coding for
housekeeping genes and 11.3 % coding for proteins with
no clear signal secretory peptide and with unknown function (Figure 1A). Similarly, P. duboscqi Kenya cDNA
library (PduK) resulted in 82.6% of transcripts coding for
secreted proteins, 9.4 % coding for housekeeping genes
and 8.0% coding for proteins with no clear signal secretory peptide and with unknown function (Figure 1B). The
high percentage of secreted proteins found on P. duboscqi
salivary gland cDNA library is similar to the ones observed
in cDNA libraries from other sandflies and mosquitoes
[13,14].

Table 1 and Table 2 list the transcripts coding for the most
abundant and secreted salivary gland proteins from P.
duboscqi collected in Mali and Kenya, respectively. The
tables were arranged from the most abundant to the least
abundant transcripts found in the two cDNA libraries. For
example, transcript PduM02 is listed first and it contains
182 sequences (Table 1). The nomenclature for the transcripts on these cDNA libraries is the following: Pdu =
Phlebotomus duboscqi, M = Mali, K = Kenya, and the
number (ie: 02) denotes the contig number on the cDNA
library where a contig is a cluster of identical transcripts.
Many of the isolated transcripts code for proteins previously identified from the saliva of P. papatasi or L. longipalpis including PpSP15-like protein, yellow-related
proteins, apyrase-like, and PpSP32-like, among others.
Notably, we identified a transcript coding for adenosine
deaminase (PduM73), which was previously identified in
the sandfly L. longipalpis [15] and the mosquito Aedes
aegypti [16] but never reported in Phlebotomus sandflies.

There were also other transcripts coding for proteins not
previously reported in sandflies (Table 1).
Proteome analysis of salivary proteins from P. duboscqi
from Mali and Kenya
Edman degradation of the salivary proteins isolated from
P. duboscqi Mali strain resulted in the identification of 16
different N-terminal sequences (Figure 2A). The transcripts coding for these N-terminal sequences were identified by searching the open reading frames of the
transcripts from the constructed P. duboscqi cDNA database (Figure 2A). The identified proteins were two
PpSP12-like proteins (PduM07, PduM31), two PpSP15like protein (PduM02 and PduM06), three D7-related
protein (PduM29, PduM01, PduM46), two apyrase-like
proteins (PduM39 and PduM38), a 32-kDa protein from
L. longipalpis (PduM05), two yellow-related proteins
(PduM35, PduM10) and two adenosine deaminase-like
proteins (PduM74 and PduM73). We also found proteins
with the same N-terminal sequence but with different gel
mobilities (PduM10, PduM35, PduM01, PduM02). These
may represent the same protein with different post-translational modifications.

From P. duboscqi Kenya salivary gland protein analysis we
found 15 different Nterminus sequences (Figure 2B). The
transcripts coding for these n-terminal sequences were

identified by searching the P. duboscqi Kenya cDNA database (Figure 2B). The identified proteins were: two
PpSP12-like proteins (PduK40, PduK57), one PpSP15like protein (PduK01), four D7-related proteins (PduK35,
PduK34 and PduK69), one apyrase-like protein
(PduK50), a 32-kDa protein (PduK50), three yellowrelated proteins (Pduk06, PduK05 and PduK04) and an
adenosine deaminase-like protein (PduK60).
Phylogenetic tree analysis, multiple sequence alignment
and identification of potential MHC class II T-cell epitopes
of P. duboscqi salivary proteins
To evaluate the phylogenetic relationship among these
salivary proteins and provide a better assessment of the
homology of secreted salivary proteins from these two different sandfly populations, we performed sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of the most abundant
and secreted proteins from the Mali and Kenya cDNA
libraries. The objective of this analysis was to identify and
compare the orthologues between these two geographically distant sandfly species. Because cellular immune
responses to salivary proteins, particularly CD4 T celldependent response, are associated with protection
against Leishmania infection, we searched for putative
MHC class II T cell epitopes in these salivary proteins and
compared how conserved these epitopes were between
the salivary orthologues of the two sandfly populations.

Following is a description of the analysis of these salivary
proteins:
PpSP14-like proteins
PpSP14-like proteins are related to the 14-kDa salivary
proteins of unknown function from P. papatasi and also
identified in other sandflies, but not in other insects [9].
We found three members of this family of proteins
(PduM50, PduM57 and PduM60) on the cDNA library of
P. duboscqi Mali strain and two members (PduK49 and
PduK58) in the Kenya strain. Phylogenetic tree analysis of
these salivary proteins resulted in the formation of three
distinct clades, one containing PduM50 and Pduk49, the
second containing PpSP14 and PduM57, and the third
containing PduK58 and PduM60 (Figure 3). PduM50 and
PduK49 is a cluster of orthologous sequences (COG) as
well as PduM60 and PduK58. When comparing the
number of transcripts among these orthologues, PduK49
has 22 transcripts and PduM50 has only eight transcripts,
overall, these sequences contained more (PduK49) or
fewer (PduM50) sequences from a particular value than
expected from a random distribution, as evaluated by the
χ2 test, this suggests that this transcript/protein may be
more represented in the Kenya population than in the
Mali population. PduK58 has ten transcripts and PduM60
has five transcripts, which may suggest that these transcripts/proteins may be represented in similar proportions in these two populations. PduM57 may be a
transcript/protein present only in the Mali population or
rarely in the Kenya population. Sequence comparison of
these orthologues resulted in a 99.3% identity between
PduM60 and PduK58 (Figure 3B) and 99.8% identity
between PduM50 and PduK49 (Figure 3C). Because cellular immune responses (specifically a DTH response) to
sandfly proteins are related to protection against Leishmania infection, we wanted to identify potential MHC class
II-restricted epitopes in these salivary proteins and determine whether these epitopes were conserved when comparing two different sandfly populations. We identified an
epitope in PduM60, VVTANKKNQ (Figure 3B), which is
100% identical in PduK58. The epitope for PduM50 and
PduK49 is IKYNVVAAKKRGE (Figure 3C), which is also
100% identical.
PpSP15-like proteins
Immunisation of mice with PpSP15 protein or DNA plasmid coding for this protein from the saliva of P. papatasi
was previously shown to protect mice against L. major
infection [9]. Three members of the PpSP15-like family
were identified in each sandfly cDNA library, PduM02, 03
and 06 from the Mali cDNA library and PduK01, 02 and
03 from the Kenya cDNA library. Phylogenetic tree analysis of these proteins resulted in the formation of three distinct groups (Figure 4A). Two groups with single members
including PpSP15 and PduK02, a group with three mem-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/226

bers – including a cluster of orthologous sequences
PduM03 and PduK03 – and the third group that includes
the orthologues PduM06 and PduK01 (Figure 4A). In the
third group, PduK01 is highly represented in this library
(155 transcripts) as compared with PduM06 (63 transcripts), overall, these sequences contained more
(PduK01) or fewer (PduM06) sequences from a particular
value than expected from a random distribution, as evaluated by the χ2 test, thus, this suggest that this protein is
more frequent in the Kenya population than in the Mali
population. When orthologues were compared, we
observed a 100% identity between PduM03 and PduK03
(Figure 4B) and 100% identity between PduM06 and
PduK01 (Figure 4C). Using TEPITOPE software on these
sequences we identified two potential MHC class II T-cell
epitopes in PduM03, YGFIDVNYN and YRCVLTSKL (Figure 3B). Two potential T-cell epitopes were found in
PduM06, LIKHGVVEI AND WLNCRSIVD (Figure 4C).
PpSP12-like proteins
This family of proteins was previously described in the salivary glands of P. papatasi and is a protein of 12 kDa with
unknown function [9]. Transcripts with homologies to
this protein were also found in the two sandfly cDNA
libraries in the present work. Interestingly, this family of
proteins had many members that were unlike the other
salivary proteins in this sandfly in either location. For the
Mali population we identified eight members, PduM07,
12, 31, 32, 49, 58, 62, and 99, and for the Kenya strain six
members were identified, PduK40, 41, 42, 56, 57, and
109. Phylogenetic tree analysis resulted in the formation
of 3 major clades (Figure 5), one clade containing PpSP12
and two orthologues PduM58 and PduK57, a second
clade containing the orthologues PduM07 and PduK40
and a third clade containing a rapidly diverging salivary
proteins, including various clusters of orthologous
sequences such as PduM12 and PduK109, PduM31 and
PduK56, PduM49 and PduK41, PduM234 and PduK42,
and PduM07 and PduK40 (Figure 5). Sequence comparison between the different SP12-like orthologues resulted
in a high level of identity among these proteins (Figure 6).
PduM58 and PduK57 were 98.6 % identical and the predicted T-cell epitopes (Figure 6A) were 100% identical;
PduM12 and PduK109 were 71.6% identical and the predicted T-cell epitopes were 89% identical (Figure 6B);
PduM31 and PduK56 were 100 % identical (Figure 6C);
PduM49 and PduK41 were 97% identical and the predicted T cell epitope was 100% identical (Figure 6D);
PduM234 and PduK42 were 84.4 % identical and the predicted T cell epitope was 75% identical; PduM07 and
PduK40 were 93% identical and the predicted T-cell
epitope was 100% identical.

PduK42).

D7-like proteins (SP28 and SP30)
Transcripts with homology to the D7 family of proteins
were identified in both cDNA libraries. D7 protein was
previously reported in mosquitoes [17] and sandflies
[18]. Only recently has its function been described from
the saliva of Anopheles mosquito as a anti-clotting factor
[19], and as a serotonin and small amine-binding protein
[20]. Phylogenetic tree analysis of D7 proteins from various sandflies, including transcripts from Mali and Kenya,
resulted in the formation of six different clades. Three
clades are clusters of orthologous sequences that include
PpeSP10 (P. perniciosus D7) and ParSP07 (P. ariasi D7),
PpSP30 (P. papatasi D7) and PduK103 and a third cluster
containing PduM46 and PduK69. Sequence comparison
from the orthologues PduM46 and PduK69 showed
100% sequence identity and sharing of three potential T
cell epitopes (Figure 7B).

SP32-like proteins
This protein family belongs to the silk-related and collagen-like protein in sandflies [9]. This type of protein has
not been described in other blood feeding arthropods, yet
it is present in the Phlebotomus as well as in the Lutzomyia sandflies [18]. These proteins are characterised by a
large number of low complexity amino acids such as Glycine (G), arginine (R), proline (P) and serine (S), throughout the molecule (Figure 8). Phylogenetic tree analysis of
various SP32-like proteins from different sandflies,
including P. duboscqi Mali and Kenya, resulted in the formation of various clades (Figure 8A). Three of these clades
are clusters of orthologues sequences: the first clade contains PduM33 and PduK83, the second clade contains
PduM34 and PduK46, and the third clade contains
PduM72 and PduK45 (Figure 8A). Sequence comparison
between the SP32-like orthologues from Kenya and Mali

resulted in a high degree of homology (Figure 8B,C,D).
PduM33 and PduK83 had 96.1% sequence identity; additionally, two of the three potential T-cell epitopes
(TTFPSSGWG AND SSRQNSRQPG) are 100 % identical
(Figure 8B). PduM34 and PduK46 are 97.1 % identical
and the two potential Tcell epitopes (FPTKGVDSL and
RQNSRQQGRR) are 100% identical (Figure 8C).
PduM72 and PduK45 are 84% identical, one potential T
cell epitope (FPTKGVESL) is 100 % identical and the
other two potential T cell epitopes (GQNSRQQRG and
SPAKYIFAT) are 89% identical (Figure 8D).
Antigen 5-related protein
This family of proteins belongs to the cysteine rich family
of proteins (CRISP) found in wasp venom [21], hookworm [22], mosquitoes [23] and sandflies [18]. We found
transcripts coding for this family of proteins in the P.
duboscqi salivary gland cDNA libraries from Mali and
Kenya. Phylogenetic tree analysis of antigen 5-related proteins from various sandflies, including the antigen 5related proteins from P. duboscqi (Mali and Kenya),
resulted in the formation of various clades – one of them
containing the orthologues PduM48 and PduK68 from
Mali and Kenya (Figure 9A). Sequence comparison of
these orthologues resulted in 100% identity, including
two potential T-cell epitopes (Figure 9B).
Apyrase-like protein
Transcripts were found on the P. duboscqi Mali and Kenya
cDNA libraries coding for a protein homologous to the
Cimex family of apyrases [24], a protein also present in
other organisms including sandflies [25], worms, mouse
and humans [26,27]. Secreted apyrases function as potent
anti-platelet factors by hydrolysing the platelet activator
adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Phylogenetic tree analysis
of apyrase-like proteins from different sandflies resulted
in the identification of the apyrase-like orthologues
PduK50 and PduM39 from the two cDNA salivary gland
libraries (Figure 10A). The phylogenetic tree also shows
that the apyrase-like proteins from P. duboscqi are closely
related to P. papatasi apyrases and apart from other Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia apyrases. Sequence comparison
between the Mali and Kenya orthologues shows a high
degree of identity, 94.6%, between these two proteins
(Figure 10B). Of interest, we observed five potential
epitopes in this molecule, almost twice the number of
epitopes identified from the other sandfly proteins. Four
of these epitopes are 100% identical when comparing
apyrase epitopes from Mali and Kenya proteins (Figure
10B).
Yellow-related proteins
We identified in the P. duboscqi Mali cDNA library 2 transcripts (PduM10 and PduM35) and in the Kenya cDNA
library 2 transcripts (PduK04 and PduK06) coding for a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/226

yellow related protein, a protein previously described in
the saliva of P. duboscqi [28], other sand flies [18] and
other insects[29]. Volf et al. [28] reported lectin activity of
42 kDa yellow-related protein purified from P. duboscqi
lysates. However, the function of this protein in the saliva
of insects remains unknown. Notably, a homologous protein was purified from Aedes aegypti midgut having a dopa
decarboxylase activity [30]; this activity in the saliva of
sandflies remains to be tested. Phylogenetic tree analysis
of yellow-related proteins from different sandflies, including Mali and Kenya, resulted in the formation of five different clades (Figure 11A). Clusters of othologous
sequences for the Mali and Kenya strain were found in the
first two clusters, one containing the orthologues PduK06
and PduM35, and the other containing PduM10 and
PduK04 (Figure 11A). Sequence comparison of PduK06
and PduM07 resulted in 97.5% identity (Figure 11B) and
in 100% identity in the two potential T-cell epitopes identified (Figure 11B). Sequence comparison of PduM10 and
PduK04 resulted in 100 % identity, including the two Tcell epitopes identified (Figure 11C).

Conclusion
Salivary transcriptome and proteome analysis of P.
duboscqi has resulted in a better understanding at the
molecular level of the repertoire of proteins present in the
saliva of this sandfly (Tables 1 and 2). Most salivary transcripts identified from the P. duboscqi cDNA libraries are
very similar to those of the salivary proteins previously
identified in P. papatasi. This is not surprising, because
both P. papatasi and P. duboscqi belong to the same subgenus (Phlebotomus) and are proven natural vectors of L.
major. A clear difference between P. duboscqi and P. papatasi cDNA libraries was the presence in P. duboscqi of an
adenosine deaminase (the transcript and the protein).
Adenosine deaminase has been reported in Aedes and
Culex mosquitoes [31] and in the sandfly L. longipalpis;
however, not in sandflies from the genus Phlebotomus
[15].
This salivary transcriptome analysis allowed us to compare the salivary proteins of a sandfly from two different
geographical locations. We investigated whether the salivary proteins from two different sites (Mali and Kenya)
would be divergent, as previously reported with the salivary protein maxadilan when comparing L. longipalpis
sandflies from Costa Rica, Colombia, and Brazil [12]. In
the present work, we performed a global comparative
analysis of the most abundant salivary proteins of sandflies from two locations, and searched for orthologues
using phylogenetic analysis. We found the majority of the
proteins to be highly conserved at both the aa and the
nucleotide levels. We found that at least five families of
proteins (SP15-like, SP12-like, D7-like, antigen 5-like,
and yellow-related protein) were 100% identical in sand-

flies from Mali and Kenya. The other families were also
highly conserved (94.6% to 99.8%) with the exception of
three proteins that had moderate homology (of 18 orthologous sequences): two SP12-like members that were
84.4% and 71.6% identical, respectively, and a SP32-like
member that was 84% identical.
Because cellular immune responses to sandfly saliva – particularly a DTH response – was previously associated with
protection against Leishmania infection [5,9], we wanted
first to identify potential MHC class II T-cell epitopes,
which are required for DTH T cell-dependent responses
and then determine whether these putative epitopes were
also conserved among salivary proteins from these sandflies. The majority of potential T-cell epitopes were highly
conserved among the different sandfly proteins; in fact,
the majority of potential T cell epitopes were 100% identical, with the exception of only five epitopes that were
75% to 90% identical. These data suggest that even if the
overall level of identity of some salivary proteins (Mali vs
Kenya) is not 100%, the proteins have the potential to
cross-react, at least at the level of cellular immune
response (DTH) because of the high conservation of their
T-cell epitopes that can be presented in the proper MHC
class II context. This assumption needs to be tested experimentally.
A possible explanation for the conservation of salivary
proteins include recent establishment of these sandflies in
these regions with little or no evolutionary pressure from
host immune response on these salivary proteins; or evolutionary pressure to keep these sequences constant (negative selection). Additionally, the location of these sand
flies is more than 2000 thousand of kilometers apart.
Then, it is difficult to suggest that there is a continuous
exchange of sand flies in the whole sub-Saharan Africa
moving from Kenya all the way to Mali or is also possible
that the gene flow may be very low. In history, this area
was affected by dramatic aridization (~5 millions years
ago) [32] and consequent creation of Sahel as a unique
transient formation (~3 milions years ago) [33], events
that might led to separation and later rejoining of Eastern
and Western populations of P. duboscqi. Further studies
are needed to determine if these two populations are
genetically isolated.
A DTH response to P. papatasi bites in mice was experimentally demonstrated to help these sandflies to probe
and feed faster [34]. It was shown that this type of
response considerably increased blood flow at the site of
the bite (after subsequent sandfly challenge), creating a
favorable environment for feeding. It is thus possible that
this type of immune response may favor sandfly survival
in nature and therefore will also favor the presence of
highly conserved sequences in their salivary proteins.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/226

The data presented in this work are in contrast to previous
studies performed with the salivary protein maxadilan
from the sandfly L. longipalpis, which was shown to be
highly divergent between sandflies of distinct locations
[12]. In contrast, PpSP15 from P. papatasi was shown to be
highly conserved when comparing sandflies from different locations and isolates from field and laboratory colonies [35]. Therefore, it is possible that Phlebotomus
salivary proteins are more conserved in general than proteins present in the saliva of Lutzomyia sandflies, perhaps
due to the benefit accrued in increased feeding due to the
host DTH response. It is also important to take into
account that L. longipalpis is allegedly a complex of cryptic
species [36], hence the larger variability observed in their
salivary protein. Additionally, if P. duboscqi is a much
older sand fly than L. longipalpis, it may be possible that
Phlebotomus sand flies are more stable species which
could explain the high conservancy of salivary proteins in
the two different Phlebotomus species (P. papatasi and P.
duboscqi).
Sandfly salivary components are potential vaccine candidates to control Leishmania infection. Our results suggest
that P. duboscqi salivary protein that may be able to produce a protective cellular immune response should be
able to induce the same immune response in hosts from
distant geographical locations in the Sub-Saharan Africa
where P. duboscqi is present.

Methods
Sandfly capture
Female Phlebotomus duboscqi sandflies were captured alive
with solid-state miniature light traps(John Hock Company Ins., Gainsville, FL) and mouth aspirators in the villages of Kemena (-6° 54' 37", 13° 07, 22") Baraoueli
Distric, Mali. The live flies were held in paper holding
containers and stored in a cooler until they could be transported to the laboratory. In the laboratory, sandflies were
identified to species using appropriate taxonomic keys for
West Africa [37] and the salivary glands dissected and
stored in groups of 20 pairs in RNA later® solution
(Ambion) and stored at 4°C until use.
Sandfly salivary glands
Adult Phlebotomus duboscqi from a colony originated from
Kenya were kept with free access to a 30% solution of
sucrose. Salivary glands from recently emerged and 1- to
2-day-old adult female flies were dissected and transferred
to 10 or 20 µl HEPES 10 mM pH 7.0, NaCl 0.15 M in 1.5
ml polypropylene vials, usually in groups of 10 pairs of
glands in 20 µl of HEPES saline, or individually in 10 µl
of HEPES saline. Salivary glands were stored at 75°C until
needed.

Salivary gland cDNA libraries
Phlebotomus duboscqi (Mali and Kenya) salivary gland
mRNA was isolated from 45 and 55 salivarygland pairs,
respectively, using the MicroFastTrack mRNA isolation kit
(Invitrogen, SanDiego, CA). The PCR-based cDNA library
was made following the instructions for the SMART cDNA
library construction kit (BD-Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with
some modifications [14]. The obtained cDNA libraries
(large, medium and small size) were plated by infecting
log phase XL1-blue cells (Clontech) and the amount of
recombinants was determined by PCR using vector primers flanking the inserted cDNA and visualised on a 1.1 %
agarose gel with ethidium bromide (1.5 ug/ml).
Massive sequencing of cDNA libraries
P. duboscqi-Mali and P. duboscqi-Kenya salivary gland
cDNA libraries were sequenced as previously described
using an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer and a
CEQ 2000XL DNA sequencing instrument (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA) [18].
Bioinformatics
Detailed description of the bioinformatic treatment of the
data appear in [18,38,39]. Briefly, primer and vector
sequences were removed from raw sequences and quality
of sequence determined. Sequences were compared with
the GenBank non-redundant (nr) protein database using
the standalone Blastx program found in an executable
package as previously described [40]. Related sequences
were grouped into contigs and aligned using a CAP assembler. Contigs and singletons (contig containing only one
sequence) were compared using the program blastX,
blastN, or rpsBlast [40] to the non-redundant (nr) protein
database of the National Center of Biological Information
(NCBI), to the gene ontology database (GO) [41], the
Conserved Domains Database (CDD) that includes all
Pfam [42], SMART [43] and COG protein domains in the
NCBI [44]. Additionally, contigs were compared with a
customised subset of the NCBI nucleotide database containing either mitochondrial (mit-pla) or rRNA (rrna)
sequences. Identification of putative secreted proteins was
conducted using the SignalP server [45]. The three frame
translation of each dataset was used to determine open
reading frames (ORF). Only ORFs that started with a
methionine and were longer than 40 amino acid (aa) residues were submitted to the SignalP server. The grouped
and assembled sequences, BLAST results and signal peptide results were combined in an Excel spreadsheet and
manually verified and annotated.
Phylogenetic analysis
Protein families, identified through the bioinformatics
analysis, were further analysed using phylogenetics. Consensus protein sequences of the identified protein families
from each of the sandflies used in this analysis were com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/226

pared with related sequences from sandfly vectors as well
as non-sandfly species obtained from GenBank.
Sequences were aligned using ClustalX [46] and manually
refined using BioEdit sequence editing software [47]. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on protein alignments
using Tree Puzzle version 5.2 [48] incorporating the
appropriate model of evolution defined by ProtTest [49].
Tree Puzzle constructs phylogenetic trees by maximum
likelihood using quartet puzzling, automatically estimating internal branch node support (100,000 replications).
Derived trees were visualised using TreeView [50].
T-cell epitope prediction
The TEPITOPE software package [51] that searches for
promiscuous HLA-class II binding peptides and human Tcell epitopes was set at threshold of 4% and run with the
25 different HLA-DR alleles. The promiscuous epitopes
were selected from the P. duboscqi protein sequences
tested that were predicted to bind at least 50% of the MHC
class II molecules.
SDS-PAGE
For P. duboscqi salivary glands, NuPAGE 10% Bis Tris gels
(Invitrogen) were used. Gels were run with NuPAGE MES
SDS running buffer (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To estimate the molecular weight
of the samples, SeeBlue™ markers from Invitrogen
(myosin, BSA, glutamic dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, myoglobin, lysozyme, aprotinin, and insulin, chain B) were used. The salivary gland
homogenate was treated with equal parts of 2× SDS sample buffer (8% SDS in Tris-HCl buffer, 0.5 M, pH 6.8, 10%
glycerol and 1% bromophenol blue dye). For aminoterminal sequencing of the salivary proteins, 35 homogenised pairs of salivary glands were electrophoresed and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using NuPAGE transfer buffer, 10% methanol as
the transfer buffer on a Blot-Module for the XCell II MiniCell (Invitrogen). The PVDF membrane was charged in
100% methanol for 30 seconds prior to the transfer on a
Blot-Module for the XCell II Mini-Cell (Invitrogen). Upon
transfer, the membrane was washed three times for five
minutes with ultrapure water, and then treated for five
minutes with a staining solution containing 0.025%
Coomasie brilliant blue and 40% methanol in the
absence of acetic acid. The membrane was partially
destained in a solution of 50% methanol for ten minutes,
then rinsed several times with ultrapure water. The membrane was allowed to dry before the stained bands were
cut from the membrane and subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.)

To determine the cDNA sequences corresponding to the
aa sequence obtained by Edman degradation, we used a
search program that checked these aa sequences against

the three possible protein translations of each cDNA
sequence obtained in the DNA sequencing project. A
more detailed account of this program is found elsewhere
