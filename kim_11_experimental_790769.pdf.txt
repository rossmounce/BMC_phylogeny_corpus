Abstract
Background: Recently, new emergence of type I PRRSV has been reported in Korea by several research groups.
Although specific subgroups of type I PRRSVs in Korea were observed in the previous phylogenetic analysis, there
is a lack of information about the virulence of type I PRRSV recently isolated in Korea.
Methods: One type I PRRSV isolate (G2446, 3 times passaged in primarily cultured pulmonary macrophages) in
Korea was experimentally infected in colostrum-deprived pigs. The pathological and serological evaluations were
performed and compared to type II PRRSV strain (CP07-401-9, 5 times passaged in MARC-145 cell lines)-infected
pigs, for 21 days post challenge (dpc).
Results: The pneumonia found in gross examination was more severe in type I PRRSV-infected pigs than type II
PRRSV-infected pigs. Both groups showed bronchointerstitial pneumonia, mild multifocal perivascular
lymphohistiocytic myocarditis and lymphadenopathy at 14 dpc. However, the unique histopathologic lesions were
not found in the pigs experimentally infected with a Korean type I PRRSV isolate, when compared to previous data
about classical pathology of PRRSV. The PRRS-specific antibodies were detected in the first week after challenge
and viremia continued at least until 21 dpc in both groups.
Conclusion: The gross and histopathologic lesion in this study indicated that Korean type I PRRSV strain (G2446)
caused classical PRRSV-specific lesions. Although this study evaluated one representative strain of Korean type I
PRRSV, the results may provide information regarding the pathogenicity of type I PRRSV recently emerged in Korea.

to the family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus [1]. Genetic
and antigenic analyses have revealed two distinct PRRSV
groups, the European (Type I) and the North American
(Type II), with marked genetic and antigenic differences
between the two genotypes as well as among viruses
within each genotype [2-5].
PRRS has been experimentally induced with cell-culture-propagated virus in sows and pigs [6-8]. Also, it
has been documented that PRRSV strains differ in
virulence [9].
In the Republic of Korea, type II PRRSV infection was
first described in 1993 [10]. Since then, there have been

PRRSV [11,12]. Recently, type I PRRSV infection occurred
in Korean swine farms, and they showed unique characteristics in genetic analysis [13-16]. The type II PRRSV
in Korea was suspected to be introduced from North
America, and at least 4 different lineages of type II PRRSV
were circulating in Korea [13]. In the nation-wide study,
the Korean type I PRRSV (a term used to indicate type I
PRRSVs in Korea) formed three distinct clusters from
other type I PRRSV strains and cluster I was a predominant group [13,14]. Although the type I PRRSVs in Korea
were included in panEuropean subgroup, they were
further divided into three clusters (class I, II and III) in the
phylogenetic analysis [4,14,15]. The class I was shown to
be dominant strains in Korea. However, in spite of nationwide phylogenetic analysis of the viruses, there is a lack of
information about the virulence of type I PRRSV recently
isolated in Korea. The aim of this study was to observe
gross lesion, histopathological lesion and immunological
properties in pigs after experimental infection of a type I
PRRSV isolate especially belonged to ‘class I’, a dominant
type I PRRSV in Korea.

Methods
Cells and viruses

In the case of type I PRRSV, tissue-culture-infective doses
(TCID) were prepared as follows. A G2446 strain (Passage
3 in Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM)) was
prepared to viral concentration of 105 TCID50/ml using
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml). In
the case of type II PRRSV, a CP07-401-9 strain (Passage 5
in MARC-145 cells) was prepared to 105 TCID50/ml in
the same media as described above for the Type I strain.
The viruses were isolated from pigs in Korea and their
sequence information was presented in the previous
papers [13,15].
Experimental design

Two ml of 5 logTCID 50 /ml type I and type II PRRSV
isolates, G2446 (GenBank ID: GU325647, p3, cluster I)
and CP07-401-9 (GenBank ID: FJ972728, p5, vaccinelike), were inoculated into five colostrum-deprived pigs
(3 weeks old) for each viral type via the intranasal route.
Three pigs remained uninfected as a control group.
Each group was maintained in a separate pen. After
challenge, blood samples were collected at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 21 days post challenge (dpc). All
animal experiments complied with the current laws of
South Korea. Animal care and treatment were conducted in accordance with guidelines establishment by
the Green Cross Veterinary Products Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Serological tests

A commercial kit (HerdChek PRRS 2XR, IDEXX Inc.,
USA) was used, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to estimate the levels of PRRSV-specific antibodies. The IgG titer for PRRSV was indicated as S/P ratio
which was the calculated value in the formula: (Sample
O.D - Negative control O.D)/(Positive control O.D Negative control O.D).
A commercial real time polymerase chain reaction
kit (Ambion, USA) was used to detect viremia from
sera during the study. To evaluate the serum neutralizing ability of both types of viruses, a Serum neutralizing (SN) test was performed based on the previous
study [17]. In the case of a type I PRRSV isolate
(G2446), PAM cells were used instead of MARC-145
cell lines.
Gross and histopathological tests

Pigs were euthanized to observe gross and histopathologic lesions at 14 and 21 dpc, respectively, as follows;
three and two pigs from the challenged groups, and two
and one pigs from the control group. The lung, heart,
liver, spleen, kidney, ileum, and lymph nodes were collected and fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution. The
RT-nested PCR was performed from the collected
organs following previous paper [18]. The fixed organs
were processed for histopathology, using hematoxylin
and eosin staining.

Results and discussion
Gross lesions were enlarged tan lymph nodes and
abnormal lungs in both challenged groups. In the lungs,
the parenchyma was mottled or diffusely tan-red in the
type I PRRSV-challenged pigs, while only mild regional
mottling was observed in the type II PRRSV-challenged
pigs (Figure 1).
Histopathological lesions were only found in lung,
lymph node and heart tissue (Table 1). The lungs of
both challenged groups shared the same pathological
observations as follows;
(1) bronchointerstitial pneumonia, which was characterized by lymphohistiocytic inflammation and an accumulation of necrotic cells, likely originated from alveolar
macrophages, in alveolar spaces, and (2) Type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia in the alveolar septa. Mild multifocal
perivascular lymphohistiocytic myocarditis was sometimes observed in both challenged groups as well. In the
control group, there were no pathologic changes. The
results of RT-nested PCR showed PRRSV-positive in all
collected organs in both challenged groups during the
study (data not shown).
PRRSV-specific antibodies were first detected at 8 and
9 dpc in type I and type II PRRSV-challenged groups,

respectively (Figure 2). Although it was not significant
by Student’s T test, mean s/p ratios remained higher in
the type I PRRSV-challenged group than in the type II
challenged group during the study. Even in the presence
of PRRSV-specific IgG, no detectable level of SN titer

Error bars in type I and II-challenged groups indicate standard
errors. For the quantitation of viremia, a commercial real time RTPCR kit was used and virus titer was calculated using a standard
curve generated from serially diluted type I or II virus isolates. Two
serum samples from each dpc collection were stored until 21 dpc.
At this point, they were pooled and quantitative RT-PCR was

was observed in either challenge group, and viremia was
also maintained throughout the study.
In this study, the virulence of newly emerging type I
PRRSV in Korea was evaluated in young pigs, using one
type I PRRSV isolate. Our main aim was to evaluate the
virulence of newly emergent type I PRRSV under experimental conditions. Although only one isolate of type I
PRRSV was used in this study, the data may provide fundamental information for further comparative studies.
Since the previous study had reported the observation of
PRRSV-specific histopathological lesions from 3 to 21 dpc,
we tested the challenged pigs until 21 dpc [19]. Previous
pathogenicity study of type II PRRSV isolated in Korea
showed that alveolar proteinaceous and karyorrhectic debris were interspersed with macrophages as well as mild
type-II pneumocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy [19]. The
comparative study using two type II PRRSV and one type
I PRRSV also revealed that both types of PRRSVs could
induce lymphohistiocytic myocarditis, lymphadenopathy
and encephalitis as well as lung lesions [9].
In agreement with the previous data, pathologic changes
after experimental challenge with a Korean isolate of type
I PRRSV (class I) were observed in the lungs, lymph nodes
and heart, until 14 and 21 dpc. The pathologic changes by
the Korean isolate of type I PRRSV in this study were also
type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, necrotic debris in alveolar
septa, perivascular lymphohistiocytic myocarditis and
lymphadenopathy, which were all similar to previous
reports. These data indicated that a type I PRRSV isolate,
in this study, showed classical lesions of PRRSV infection
and sufficiently induced acute disease in young pigs
(3 weeks old). Pigs at this age are known to be in a vulnerable stage for PRRSV infection [20]. Although unique
lesions of the Korean isolate of type I PRRSV was not
found in this study, the severity of gross lesions in lungs
was higher than that of the type II PRRSV strain (VR2332-like). Therefore, type I PRRSV (G2446, class I) in

Kim et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:177

this study may also present a risk for co-infections with
other viruses and bacteria in the pigs during the nursery
to growing period.
The seroconversion was also well-defined by ELISA
around 8 dpc. Although mean S/P ratio was higher in
type I PRRSV challenged pigs, it was not significant by
student’s T test, which led incapable of differentiating
type I and II PRRSV infection in the field using IDEXX
ELISA. Further consideration will be needed for typespecific serological methods to differentiate type I and II
PRRSV infection in Korea. In this study, no SN titer was
observed until 21 dpc in both group. Since SN titer for
type I PRRSV was usually detected at around 35 days
post inoculation, the lack of detection of SN antibodies
in this study is probably due to the short period of time
of experiment (21 days) [21]. Furthermore, the prolonged
viremia of both types I and II PRRSV observed in this
study raised concerns about their long-term transmission
among pigs. Therefore, type-specific PRRSV surveillance
and control policy are important to minimize the type I
PRRSV transmission in Korea.
In conclusion, the Korean isolate of type I PRRSV used
in this study could induce classical PRRSV-specific lesions
and serological properties. Although only one strain of
Korean type I PRRSV was evaluated in this study, the
results could provide information about the virulence of
recently emerging Korean type I PRRSV. However, the
virulence of PRRSV infection could be differed among the
same types of PRRSV strains [9]. So, further comparative
studies based on this study are needed to be followed.
