Abstract
Background: Relationships between entities such as genes, chemicals, metabolites, phenotypes
and diseases in MEDLINE are often directional. That is, one may affect the other in a positive or
negative manner. Detection of causality and direction is key in piecing pathways together and in
examining possible implications of experimental results. Because of the size and growth of
biomedical literature, it is increasingly important to be able to automate this process as much as
possible.
Results: Here we present a method of relation extraction using dependency graph parsing with
SVM classification. We tested the SVM classifier first on gold standard corpora from GENIA and
find it achieved 82% precision and 94.8% recall (F-measure of 87.9) on these standardized test sets.
We then applied the entire system to all available MEDLINE abstracts for two target interactions
with known effects. We find that while some directional relations are extracted with low ambiguity,
others are apparently contradictory, at least when considered in an isolated context. When
examined, it is apparent some are dependent upon the surrounding context (e.g. whether the
relationship referred to short-term or long-term effects, or whether the focus was extracellular
versus intracellular).
Conclusion: Thesaurus-based directional relation extraction can be done with reasonable
accuracy, but is prone to false-positives on larger corpora due to noun modifiers. Furthermore,
methods of resolving or disambiguating relationship context and contingencies are important for
large-scale corpora.

Introduction
Large-scale or systems-wide analysis of relationship networks (e.g. protein-protein) is built from individual links.
Since labor is expensive, the domain of knowledge vast,
and time short, automated methods of constructing these

networks is of paramount importance in bioinformatics
research [1]. The simplest method of constructing such a
network is by co-occurrence of terms, either in sentences
or abstracts [2-4]. Previous research found that entities cooccurring within a sentence have approximately an 80%

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9(Suppl 9):S11

chance of being related in a non-trivial manner, while
entities co-occurring within an abstract have approximately a 50% chance [5,6] (exact numbers vary). However, these co-occurrence based approaches, despite their
computational efficiency, necessarily remain agnostic
about the nature of the relationship between entities. And
if we are to have any hope at understanding how control
and cause/effect are propagated in these networks, we
must establish directionality.
NLP systems and biological networks
Establishing relationship directionality usually requires
some means of natural language processing (NLP) to
extract relationships from biomedical text, although it is
not necessarily the only way [7,8]. Most systems that
attempt to characterize the nature of the relationship
between entities (e.g., directionality, stimulation, inhibition) use grammatical information from sentences, which
is provided by NLP software. These may use either shallow
parsing [9], which divides the sentence into chunks, or
deep parsing [10,11], which provides a complete representation of a sentence's constituent grammatical relations. For example, Chilibot [12] and MedScan [13-15]
attempt to parse sentences to detect the nature of relationships and develop association networks. Chilibot has only
three relationship types – positive, negative, and neutral –
while MedScan has many more. Both Chilibot and MedScan attempt to determine which terms are subject and
object. Systems can also be distinguished by whether they
use grammatical information in a rule-based manner, like
Chilibot, or whether they use machine learning techniques, such as SVMs [16].

NLP-based approaches have seen heavy use in identifying
protein-protein interactions within text [17-23], gene-disease relationships [24], and have been successful in bolstering and partially reconstructing regulatory networks
using text [25]. The goals for these programs range from a
simplified two-class method of labeling extracted relationships (e.g., 'stimulates' (positive) or 'inhibits' (negative)), to detection of several dozen semantic types of
relationship, such as 'binds', 'cleaves', 'phosphorylates',
etc. Our interests in this line of research are to detect paths
of directional inference (e.g. A increases B and B decreases
C, therefore A decreases C) and their reliability. To accomplish this we must first develop a method that is scalable.
Accuracy is desirable, of course, but if an algorithm has a
modest accuracy yet many chances to detect directional
relations, then it is possible the large sample size may offset a less-than-optimal accuracy. To do this, however, we
need to better understand how these methods perform on
large unstandardized corpora and the amount of apparently contradictory relationships that are detected as the
amount of text is increased and false-positives accrue.
Most approaches to date have unfortunately focused on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S9/S11

relatively small corpora and it is not clear how they would
perform on large datasets (e.g. millions of records).
We anticipate some contradiction will be factual in nature
(e.g. one author reporting A increases B and another
reporting A decreases B), but most likely the primary form
of contradiction will be context-dependent. That is, the
context of the relationship may enable both scenarios to
be true and therefore the different facts extracted from text
only appear to be contradictory when examined in isolation. We also hypothesize that some objects will better
serve as subjects of study, which will bias observations
towards one type of directional relationship when, in theory, both might be considered equally logical. For example, the relationship between insulin and glucose will
tend more towards reports on the extracellular effects of
insulin on glucose (insulin decreases glucose) rather than
the intracellular effects (insulin increases glucose) because
the extracellular effects are much easier to assay for (e.g.
by drawing blood). This is going to introduce an artifact
into any NLP analysis that will eventually need to be
resolved in the thrust towards a more "systems-level" view
of biology. For now, however, we hope that such contextual biases will be relatively uniform (e.g. if insulin
increases or decreases other entities, the same perspective
biases will apply for them) so that making inferences
might be possible.
Here we present a directional relation extraction (DRE)
system that uses a support vector machine (SVM) to classify dependency paths, as SVMs have been shown recently
to be suited to this type of task [26]. We term it the directional relation extraction and determination with SVM
(DREAD SVM). It has the following notable features: First,
it has a robust, extensible dependency path convolution
kernel capable of extracting and determining directionality for relations when trained on the GENIA event corpus.
Second, it has a thesaurus-based named entity recognition
algorithm that is not limited to a particular type of biomedical entity (such as gene or protein). We then present
the results of cross-validation on the GENIA event corpus
and explore the results of large-scale extraction from
MEDLINE abstracts. We observe that relationships are
often extracted with a degree of ambiguity in their direction and nature – a phenomenon that is often viewed as
inconvenient noise that is to be screened out during construction of biological networks. However, it is these
instances we are most interested in for this report. The
construction of biological networks often is centered
upon the arrow and node (or vertices and edges) concept.
Yet, how many of these relationships are of such a simple
nature that they can be represented in such a manner and
how many might be essentially irresolvable without a 3rd
variable, such as perspective or time? We do not believe
we can answer this conclusively here, but through the

analysis of several terms expected to have relatively
straightforward relationships, we hope to gain a better
understanding of how often these simplified relationship
constructs are valid.

• The Relationship Classification phase uses a combination
of Support Vector Machines and heuristics to deduce the
directionality and possible stimulatory or inhibitory character of a relationship based on the grammatical information provided by the parsing phase.

Materials and methods
The DREAD algorithm begins with the input of a sentence
containing a term of interest, which must appear in a thesaurus of biomedical objects, including genes, chemicals,
and clinical phenotypes (described below). The final output of the algorithm is a set of directed edges between the
query term and all other terms that co-occurred with the
query term within a sentence. These directed edges are
also characterized for the presence of stimulatory or
inhibitory interactions. In order to achieve this output,
the DREAD algorithm goes through several stages of activity: namely Preprocessing, Parsing, and Relationship Resolution (Figure 1). Each stage has a corresponding broad
function:
• The Preprocessing phase formats the sentence for parsing
by tokenizing and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
• The Parsing phase uses Natural Language Processing
tools to construct a grammatical representation of the sentence in Stanford Dependency (SD) format. The SD format casts words (tokens) as a network of nodes connected
by grammatical dependencies (edges).

Preprocessing
The LingPipe software first breaks each sentence into a
sequence of tokens http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/. Next,
NER identifies biologically relevant terms within the sentence using a synonym dictionary of genes, chemicals, and
clinical phenotypes developed as part of the IRIDESCENT
system [6,27,28]. Multiple-token terms are condensed to
a single token in order to simplify the subsequent parsing
steps. At this point, if the sentence does not contain at
least the query term and one other named entity within
the synonym dictionary, it is thrown out.
Parsing
Deep parsing
The preprocessed sentences containing entities of interest
are sent to the Charniak-Lease parser [29], which performs
both part-of-speech tagging and deep parsing, returning a
representation of the sentence in Penn Treebank format.
The Charniak-Lease parser was previously found to be
computationally efficient and accurate on biomedical text
compared with other deep parsers [30]. The Penn Treebank (PTB) representation of each sentence parsed is then
stored in the local relational database awaiting evaluation
by the next steps in the system (Figure 2).
Conversion to Stanford Dependency format
In order to distill the amount of grammatical information
used as feature space for machine-learning-based relation
extraction to a small, rich subset, we convert the Penn
Treebank-format (PTB) output from the Charniak-Lease
parser into the Stanford Dependency (SD) format. This
SD format represents sentences as a network of nodes
(words) and edges (grammatical relationships between
words), as described in de Marneffe et al [31] (See Figure
3). In the DREAD system, the PTB->SD conversion is
accomplished using a suite of tools available from Stanford; however, recent work has shown that conversion to
typed dependencies from other formats, such as the HPSG
output of the GENIA team's Enju parser, is also possible
[32].
Extraction of dependency path
After converting the sentence to SD format, we further
reduce the amount of grammatical information used in
relation extraction by using only the "dependency path" –
that is, the shortest sequence of nodes and edges between
two entities in the grammatical network of typed dependencies (Figure 4). The DREAD system extracts a dependency path between the query term and each other term in

the sentence that was identified by the dictionary-based
NER step. If there are multiple instances of the query term
within the sentence, this process is repeated, omitting
dependency paths connecting the query term to another
instance of itself.
The dependency path has previously been shown to provide a good feature space for machine-learning-based relation extraction [33,34]. Others, however, have used subtrees of the syntactic parse tree (i.e., Penn Treebank format) or of the typed dependency format as feature space
for relation extraction, to good effect [35]. A study of the
optimal feature space for relation extraction is provided in
Jiang and Zhai [36].
Relationship classification
In order for the DREAD system to draw a conclusion
about the nature of a relationship based on the grammatical information provided by a dependency path, we use

two sub-systems. The first, a pipeline of Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), is used to establish the presence and
directionality of a relationship for each dependency path.
If the SVM classification procedure determines that the
dependency path does indeed represent a directional relationship, the second system, a simple set of heuristic rules,
classifies the relationship as "stimulatory" (+), "inhibitory" (-), or "neutral" (n). Together, these two pieces of
information (directionality and stimulatory/inhibitory
classification) are a summarized form of the interaction
between two entities in the sentence (Figure 5).
SVM-based directionality determination
The SVM classification pipeline is composed of three oneagainst-one "convolution dependency path kernel" SVMs
(described below). Each SVM has a training set derived by
parsing and transforming the GENIA event corpus [37,38]
into dependency paths. The three SVMs classify the
dependency path in the following ways:

1. Is there a functional relationship between the two entities?
2. If there is a relationship, is that relationship directional?
3. If directional, is the direction forward or reverse?
If SVM #1 or #2 returns a negative answer (i.e., there is no
relationship or the relationship is not directed), then the
dependency path is not sent to any further steps.
Convolution dependency path kernel
Bunescu described the development of a SVM kernel that
computes the similarity of two sequences of features by

the number and length of common subsequences
between them [33]. In that work, however, Bunescu used
tokens, part-of-speech tags, and entity classes in the order
that they appear within the sentence. As a concrete example, in comparing the sentences "I went to the store" and
"You went to the game", the longest common subsequence of tokens would be "went...the", and other subsequences would be "went...to" and "to...the". In another
work, Bunescu et al restricted feature classes to those
within dependency paths, but simply calculated the
number of co-occurring features as the kernel score [39].
This method had the limitation that paths with different
lengths were computed as having zero similarity, which
presumably lowered recall.
We reasoned that the accuracy of the overall SVM procedure could be improved by combining the two methods;
in other words, by restricting the set of features to those
within the dependency path but by using Bunescu's subsequence kernel to compare two potential relationships
with greater flexibility. Indeed, a recent study by Wang,
who coined the name "convolution dependency path kernel", showed that combining the two methods leads to
greater precision and recall [40].
Formally, the generalized subsequence kernel is defined
[39]:

appear as a subsequence in both of the feature sequences
s and t (that is, u ՞ s[i], u ՞ t[j]); i and j are the sequences
of indices corresponding to s and t. Each subsequence u is
penalized according to the decaying factor, λ, with the
result that when the feature sequences s and t are longer,
each subsequence is given less weight. This serves as a way
of normalizing the kernel scores for feature sequences of
different lengths.
Feature selection
There are three primary types of feature available in each
dependency path for use by machine-learning classification: the token (word), the part-of-speech tag for each
token, and the grammatical dependency (SD edge) connecting two tokens. We elect not to use the token as a feature; because MEDLINE abstracts consist of such a large
vocabulary, choosing the token would likely lead to overfitting of the training data. On the other hand, both POS
tags and grammatical dependencies provide a relatively
sparse set of feature classes, and are more relevant to the
grammatical structure of the sentence than the token
itself.
GENIA training corpus
The GENIA event corpus consists of 1,000 abstracts from
MEDLINE that have been manually annotated for various
biomedical "events", largely molecular interactions. Of

the events in this corpus involving two entities, some are
directed, while others are not. These events have various
annotations; we considered all relations of the
Positive_regulation type as stimulatory, all relations of the
Negative_regulation type as inhibitory, and all others as
neutral. To derive gold standard relationships from the
corpus, we first assembled all possible pair-wise combinations of entities within the sentence (because the GENIA
event corpus is in a quasi-XML format, there are sometimes entities within entities; the broadest possible entity
names were used). These pairs were then classified as follows:
1. Exists vs. nonexistent – If an event was annotated
between a pair of entities, a functional relationship
between the two entities was said to exist; otherwise, the
pair was classified as non-interacting.
2. Directional vs. non-directional – Of the pairs of entities
that were annotated as interacting, some relations showed
one entity acting on the other (in GENIA parlance, this
relationship had one "THEME" and one "CAUSE"), while
other relationships did not show directionality (two
"THEME" annotations). We divided interactions on this
basis for the second training set.
3. Forward vs. reverse – For directional relations, the
"CAUSE" was considered to be the agent of the interaction, while the "THEME" was the target.

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9(Suppl 9):S11

To complete construction of the training corpus, we
parsed all sentences and extracted dependency paths
between each pair of entities as previously described.
Dependency paths from MEDLINE at large could then be
compared by the SVM kernel to dependency paths within
the training corpus to classify the existence and directionality of relationships through a series of one-against-one
classifiers.
Heuristic determination of stimulatory or inhibitory relationships
After using the pipeline of SVMs to establish the presence
or absence of a relationship and, if applicable, its directionality, we apply a simple set of heuristic rules to determine whether the nature of the relationship described by
the dependency path is "positive" (stimulation, induction, activation), "negative" (repression, down-regulation, deactivation), or "neutral" (none-of-the-above). This
is done by matching stemmed tokens in the dependency
path to a list of words in each category. We hope to soon
characterize the stimulatory or inhibitory nature of relationships using a SVM [16]; however, initial efforts using
tokens as features have resulted in good cross-validation
accuracy albeit poor recall in large-scale MEDLINE extraction.
Relationship resolution on large-scale datasets
In order to test the performance of the DREAD algorithm
on a large scale, and to test the hypothesis that aggregating
relationship data from a large corpus will overcome deficiencies in precision on individual sentences, we sought
out summary information for different objects in the database. We chose two common terms in the biomedical literature to focus on for analysis of unstructured text: A
chemical, caffeine (17,145 papers with this term in the
title and/or abstract) and gene, c-myc (11,971 papers).
Summary information regarding the direction and nature
of relationships between caffeine and other objects in the
database was compiled from its Wikipedia entry http://
en.wikipedia.org. For c-myc, we used NCBI's Gene Reference into Function (GeneRIF)[41] instead because there
was more information. Although Wikipedia may not
always be appropriate as a source of summary information, we did feel that analysis of system performance
should optimally be constrained to one or two standard
sources of summary information so as not to bias the
analysis (e.g., noticing that the system worked really well
for a certain term and then hunting down supporting
information related to that term while ignoring other
terms that the system performed poorly on).

After thus compiling a list of expected relationships
between the two terms and other biomedical objects, we
pulled all abstracts containing caffeine and c-myc from
MEDLINE, split each abstract into sentences using the
LingPipe utility, and preprocessed each sentence as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S9/S11

described above. If the sentence was found to contain the
target term, the DREAD system was used to predict the
relationships between the target term and each other term
in the sentence. If a directional relationship was found, it
was categorized as either "forward" (F), indicating that
caffeine or c-myc affects the other object, or as "reverse"
(R), indicating that the other object acts upon caffeine or
c-myc. "+" is defined as a stimulatory (e.g. increases, raises,
upregulates, etc) relationship between two terms and "-"
is an inhibitory relationship (e.g. decreases, lowers, inhibits, downregulates, etc.). For example, the relationship
"caffeine increases cyclic AMP" would be notated "F+"
from the perspective of caffeine.
These relationships were then aggregated and each binary
relationship was assigned a strength score based on the
amount of contradiction. Extracted relations were considered contradictory when both stimulatory and inhibitory
instances were detected for the same directionality. For
example, finding A increases B and A decreases B results in
a contradiction, but finding A increases B and B decreases
A is not necessarily contradictory. Feedback and feedforward loops, for example, can accommodate such trends.
Forward scores are calculated as max(F+, F-)/((F+)(F-))
and reverse scores as max(R+, R-)/((R+)(R-)).

Results
SVM cross validation on GENIA corpus
To benchmark the performance of the convolution
dependency path kernel on standardized biomedical corpora, we subjected the GENIA training data for each of the
three SVMs (see GENIA training corpus section) to 10-fold
cross-validation. For detecting the existence of a relationship and directionality to the relationship, the precision/
recall curves are shown in Figure 6. Contrasting with Küffner et al [16], the DREAD SVM's ability to detect the existence of a relationship achieved a maximum F-measure of
0.879 (Küffner 0.849) at a precision level of 0.820 (Küffner 0.827) and recall of 0.948 (Küffner 0.872). The ability
of our algorithm in directional relationship extraction
(DRE) achieved a maximum F-measure of 0.794 (Küffner
0.749) at a precision level of 0.704 (Küffner 0.846) and
recall of 0.912 (Küffner 0.672). For directional relationships, the precision/recall curves are shown in Figure 7. Fmeasure scores were similar between detection of forward
(0.861) and reverse (0.791) relationships.

Note that these scores are based upon the evaluation of
dependency paths in which the recognition of named
entities is part of the corpus; therefore, they do not take
into account the considerable loss in recall and slight loss
in precision that results from a dictionary-based named
entity approach. Also, in the DREAD system, these SVMs
are arranged in a pipeline fashion, so that the error rate
propagates in a multiplicative manner. Thus, these scores

performance would scale on much larger corpora.

Possible directional relationships are classified as Forward (caffeine affects the object) or Reverse (the object affects caffeine) and as stimulatory
(+), inhibitory (-) or neutral (n). No rel = no relationship found, N.D. rel = no directional relationship found, Expected = the directional relation
suggested by the summary information, Extracted = the directional relation with the most support, based on the sentences processed. Bold italic
font indicates errors.

all MEDLINE abstracts with the target term. The same
directional relationship had to be observed at least twice
to be counted as a directional relationship prediction.
Table 1 summarizes the DREAD SVM performance on
extracting directional relationships between caffeine and
other objects in MEDLINE. Caffeine was chosen for three
reasons: First, it was expected to have a predominance of
stimulatory relationships. Second, it was expected to affect
other objects in the body, but not be affected by many
other objects (outside of metabolic pathways). And third,
the authors have substantial first-hand experience with
the physiological effects of this chemical compound.
Table 1 shows that most relationships are indeed forward
(253 versus 116 reverse) and stimulatory (118 versus 44
inhibitory), as expected, but clearly not every extracted
directional relationship was unambiguous. The system
only identified 12/21 (57%) of the expected relationships. It did, however, correctly identify the directionality
of 10/12 (83%) of the relationships.

C-myc analysis
The oncogene, c-myc is well studied and expected to both
affect other objects and in turn be affected, as part of a
genetic network. The mechanisms which sometimes govern genetic control, especially over a gene that is estimated
to possibly regulate up to 15% of all genes[43] are
expected to complicate DRE. Table 2 summarizes the
results. The system identified 21/39 (53%) of the expected
relationships, and of those, it correctly identified the
directionality for 13/21 (62%). Examining some of the
individual sentences to better understand the reasons for
failure, it became evident that the natures of relationships
for c-myc were less straightforward than for caffeine. For
example, the role of c-myc as an oncogene is well known
and it is upregulated in breast cancer, yet the system identified many more examples of breast cancer "stimulating"
c-myc. This is because these examples are reported as correlative relationships (e.g., "in the breast cancer biopsy, cmyc was upregulated").

Drowsiness would naturally seem like a phenotype that
should be lowered upon caffeine intake. However, caffeine withdrawal can cause drowsiness [42] and since
"caffeine withdrawal" was not present in the database, the
shorter term was recognized as the subject instead.

Another example is JUN (aka c-jun). The actual functional
relationship between c-myc and JUN is forward, negative:
c-myc inhibits c-jun [44]. However, because both c-myc
and c-jun are oncogenes, they are usually mentioned in
the context of being upregulated together. Yet another difficulty in the analysis of c-myc is that sentences often refer
to an increase or decrease in the effects or properties (e.g.

"oncogenic properties") of c-myc, rather than c-myc itself.
Table 3 shows examples of sentences whose DRE was
incorrectly classified. There is an average of 0.11 stimulatory terms per c-myc:c-jun path, but only 0.03 inhibitory
terms. So, in this case, at least, there seems to be a literature bias towards describing relationships as stimulatory
rather than inhibitory. We examined the different interaction types to see if any were longer on average or contained more stimulatory or inhibitory keywords, finding
that gene-gene candidate interaction paths were considerably shorter than gene-process paths, and contained fewer
interaction keywords (see Table 4).

Discussion and conclusion
Analysis of unstandardized text comes with many challenges for term recognition, synonym mapping, homonym resolution, etc. And directional relation detection is
yet another challenge, not just in a technical sense of algorithmically detecting relations, but also in the sense of
resolving apparently contradictory data that may arise.
NLP approaches so far isolate facts from sentences and
resolve relationships between two entities, which may not
be sufficient to accurately reconstruct or model relationship networks. As we report here, extracted relationships
range from those with strong support for one type and

direction of relationship over another to apparently contradictory relationships, some of which are quickly
resolved by a better understanding of context.
We find that for these tasks involving directional relation
extraction, it is important to have terms be as unambiguous as possible. Stress and metabolism, for example, have
common meanings (i.e., psychological stress and the rate
of energy consumption by an organism, respectively) and
more specific physiological meanings (i.e., a state of
increased responsiveness to stimulus and the process by
which chemicals change form, respectively). One
approach to increase DRE accuracy would entail employing methods to break down broad categories into more
specific subcategories (e.g. oxidative stress, physiological
stress, stress-related illness, etc.), as the recognition of
term relationships was not the limiting factor in this analysis but rather the accurate recognition of full terms.
We also find that noun modifiers frequently complicate
thesaurus-based analysis of terms, as in the case of c-myc.
To increase or decrease a gene in a biological sense would
likely refer to its mRNA levels, protein expression levels or

molecular activity (e.g. catalytic) levels. However, study of
genetic effects often proceeds via an assessment of how
known function is affected by manipulating the system
and thus increasing and decreasing statements refer to the
modifier rather than the gene (e.g. "A decreased gene-Brelated apoptosis", "A increased geneB phosphorylation",
etc). While NLP systems are capable, in theory, of resolving such sentences, this style of study and writing causes
more false-positives as corpus size increases.
Ultimately, the scientific community is going to want to
move towards testing of extracted networks for concordance with observed behavior. But to do this, a greater
incorporation of contextual or conditional information
will become necessary, which may not be possible to represent in a single graph. Temporal effects, for example,
would seem to require a graph for short-term and longterm effects. Additionally, some model organisms are
manipulated to alter genetic behavior, and relationships
that are true within a mutant strain may not be true outside it. Similarly, some interactions are conditional.
Worse, some of these conditional interactions may show
up as contradictory relationships merely because not

enough is known to understand that "A increases B" and
"A decreases B" are both true depending upon the context.
All this unfortunately complicates analysis, but at the
same time seems unavoidable. Networks may well need
several additional parameters per connection to accommodate contextual information. In part, this type of NLP
work may guide some of this along – when apparently
contradictory information is found, it is possible to initiate a secondary search for contextual clues that could
accurately predict when one relationship type would be
true over another. In such cases, a computer need not necessarily "understand" the context, but simply be able to
identify it algorithmically. In the future, we hope to
develop more accurate metrics to identify when directional relationships require context resolution prior to
their inclusion in a biological network.
