Review
Insects are not only of immense economic and medical
importance, they provide important models for the
advancement of knowledge and many are of ascetic value.
They are also beset by an array of pathogens, despite their
well developed defence systems. Interest in these pathogens revolves around their potential use as biological control agents for insect pests or the desire to protect
beneficial insects against infection. The adoption of
molecular approaches to the investigation of insect pathogens and pathogen-insect interactions has had a large
impact on research and this volume provides a timely
review of how these techniques are being applied.
The multi authored book, consisting of sixteen chapters, is
broken down into four themes; identification and diagnostics, evolutionary relationships and population genetics, host-pathogen interactions and genomics and genetic
engineering. The chapters follow a standard format and
consist of several short sections covering a wide range of
topics related to the chapter heading. In some cases this
results in a superficial overview, but all chapters contain a
comprehensive list of references so that readers can follow
up areas of specific interest. Most chapters deal with particular taxa of entomopathogenic organisms thus the
reader may wish to focus upon chapters pertaining to their
particular study group or take a comparative approach.
Emphasis throughout is on molecular techniques, often
discussed and evaluated from the point of view of the

authors' personal experience. Although a useful glossary is
provided the extensive use of acronyms warrants, in addition, a list of abbreviations.
In the first section of the book authors of all the chapters
emphasise the importance of molecular techniques to the
revision of taxonomy and classification on a phylogenetic
basis. Likewise in the second section authors emphasise
the significant changes made to hypothesis concerning
the evolutionary biology of insect pathogens following
the application of DNA sequencing and analytical methods. Chapters on host-pathogen interactions cover an
eclectic range of topics including the development of a
baculovirus expression vector, tsetse fly immune
responses and gene expression in tripartite nematode-bacterium-insect symbiosis. In the last chapter in this section
and those in the final section on genomics and genetic
engineering, detailed overviews of molecular strategies are
given, a case study approach is frequently taken and future
prospects and pitfalls discussed.
As someone not directly involved with the fields of work
presented in this book I found aspects of all chapters interesting. The overviews of techniques may prove valuable to
PhD students or researchers considering taking a molecular approach to their work on insect pathogens however,
consultation of detailed technical manuals is likely to be
required before investigations can begin.
