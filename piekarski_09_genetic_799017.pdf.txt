Abstract
Background: The Roseobacter clade represents one of the most abundant, metabolically versatile
and ecologically important bacterial groups found in marine habitats. A detailed molecular
investigation of the regulatory and metabolic networks of these organisms is currently limited for
many strains by missing suitable genetic tools.
Results: Conjugation and electroporation methods for the efficient and stable genetic
transformation of selected Roseobacter clade bacteria including Dinoroseobacter shibae, Oceanibulbus
indolifex, Phaeobacter gallaeciensis, Phaeobacter inhibens, Roseobacter denitrificans and Roseobacter
litoralis were tested. For this purpose an antibiotic resistance screening was performed and suitable
genetic markers were selected. Based on these transformation protocols stably maintained
plasmids were identified. A plasmid encoded oxygen-independent fluorescent system was
established using the flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein FbFP. Finally, a chromosomal
gene knockout strategy was successfully employed for the inactivation of the anaerobic metabolism
regulatory gene dnr from D. shibae DFL12T.
Conclusion: A genetic toolbox for members of the Roseobacter clade was established. This
provides a solid methodical basis for the detailed elucidation of gene regulatory and metabolic
networks underlying the ecological success of this group of marine bacteria.

Background
The Roseobacter clade is a lineage of the Rhodobacteraceae
within the Alphaproteobacteria. It is the most abundant and
diverse group of marine Gram-negative, non-obligately
phototrophic prokaryotes. They represent up to 25% of
marine communities, especially in coastal and polar
regions [reviewed in [1,2]]. Currently, 41 subclusters are
described, covering all major oceanic habitats like seawa-

ter, algal blooms, microbial mats, sediments, sea ice and
marine invertebrates [2]. Members of the Roseobacter clade
display diverse physiologies. For example, some members
can generate energy via aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, oxidize the green-house gas carbon monoxide and
produce the climate-relevant gas dimethylsulfide through
the degradation of different sulphur compounds.
Thereby, these bacteria significantly influence the global

carbon and sulphur cycles as well as the climate [2]. Moreover, they are able to degrade aromatic compounds,
reduce trace metals, produce bioactive secondary metabolites, perform quorum sensing and can establish symbiotic and pathogenic relationships [1-5]. Several members
of the Roseobacter clade have been implicated as causative
agents of juvenile oyster disease in Eastern oyster and
black band disease in scleractina coral [2,6], or were
described as probiotics for fish larvae [7,8].
Scientific interest in this bacterial group increased steadily
since the description of its first representatives Roseobacter
denitrificans and Roseobacter litoralis [9]. Since the first
genomes of Silicibacter pomeroyi and R. denitrificans have
been completely elucidated [10,11] a massive genome
sequencing approach financed by the Gordon & Betty
Moore foundation resulted in currently 23 draft and 5 finished genome sequences from the Roseobacter clade. Some
of these sequences are organized in the ROseobacter SYstems biology database (ROSY) which allows the comparison of the genome data and supplies an integrated
platform for comparative genomics and systems biology
approaches [http://rosy.tu-bs.de/; [12]].
Many Roseobacter strains, including R. denitrificans, R. litoralis, Dinoroseobacter shibae and S. pomeroyi carry plasmids
of different size [13,14]. They range from 4.3 kb to 821.7
kb and can carry up to 20% of the genome content [4].
Therefore, due to possible incompatibilities, the choice of
suitable vectors for genetic investigations is of enormous
importance [15].
The availability of the complete genome sequences of this
important group of bacteria is a crucial prerequisite for a
detailed analysis of their physiological and ecological
properties. However, for systems biology approaches suitable methods allowing easy and efficient genetic manipulation of these strains are needed. Such techniques are
already established for other members of the Rhodobacteraceae, including Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter
capsulatus [e.g. [16-18]]. However, in this context only little is known for members of the Roseobacter clade. Techniques for electroporation, transposon mutagenesis,
biparental mating, gene knockout and genetic complementation were described only for Silicibacter sp. TM1040
[19,20], S. pomeroyi [21,22] and Sulfitobacter sp. J441 [23].
In the latter study, also lacZ reporter gene fusions were
constructed for gene expression analyses. Moreover, transposon mutagenesis of Phaeobacter sp. was described [19].
However, already in 2005, the Roseobacter clade comprised a large phylogenetic diversity with 36 described
species representing 17 genera [6]. In the meantime, many
more species have been described, making it increasingly
difficult to obtain stable tree topologies based on 16S
rRNA sequences [4]. It is well known from other bacterial
groups that genetic tools developed for one genus do not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/265

work in a related genus or even in a different strain of the
same species. Therefore, we systematically determined key
parameters required for successful genetic experiments in
strains which cover phylogenetic groups complementary
to the few already studied. We selected R. litoralis and R.
denitrificans, the archetypical isolates from the Roseobacter
clade whose physiologies have been studied for a long
time. Moreover, Oceanibulbus indolifex, a non phototroph
which is related to Sulfitobacter was selected. All three species are in the middle of the Roseobacter radiation [4]. Furthermore, we selected two species of Phaeobacter (formerly
Ruegeria). Finally, D. shibae a genus which is at the base of
the Roseobacter radiation, was studied in more detail.
We first investigated the antibiotic susceptibility of the
selected Roseobacter clade species to identify useful selective markers. Using these antibiotic markers, we tested
transformation and conjugation methods using plasmidDNA transfer with different classes of plasmids. A reporter
gene fusion system was established based on a conjugative and stably maintained plasmid encoding a flavin
mononucleotide-based fluorescent protein gene. Finally,
a gene knockout strategy was successfully applied in D.
shibae.

Results and Discussion
Differential growth of Escherichia coli and Roseobacter
strains in response to varying salt concentrations in the
culture medium
Aim of this study was to test genetic methods, applicable
for the investigation of selected representative Roseobacter
clade bacteria. Tools of interest include a gene knockout
system, a plasmid-based system for homologous gene
expression and complementation of gene defects in trans,
and a reporter gene system. So far, such genetic methods
were described for only a few members of the Roseobacter
clade as Silicibacter and Sulfitobacter [19-23]. Certainly it is
unknown if these genetic methods are also applicable for
other representative members of the huge Roseobacter
clade. Therefore, we tested these and other methods on
several members of the Roseobacter strains spread over the
whole radiation of this clade and thereby formed a very
physiologic diverse subgroup. In the context of genetic
methods, the selection of antibiotic resistance markers is
the basis for bacterial genetics and molecular biology.
However, marine bacteria of the Roseobacter clade require
appropriate salt concentrations for sufficient growth.
Since several antibiotics are inactive at high salt concentrations, first a suitable growth medium for resistance screening had to be identified. Generally, the standard growth
medium for bacteria of the Roseobacter clade is Marine
Broth (MB) [4,22,24]. However, MB restricts the survival
of E. coli, which is used for plasmid-DNA transfer by biparental mating (see below). Therefore, we initially compared the growth of six marine bacteria (i.e. P.
gallaeciensis, P. inhibens, R. denitrificans, R. litoralis, O.

indolifex, D. shibae) and E. coli using five media with different salt concentrations (Table 1). As expected, bacteria
of the Roseobacter clade have an absolute requirement for
salts, including high concentrations of NaCl [4,25] and
therefore did not grow in Luria Bertani (LB) medium.
However, slow growth in LB-medium supplemented with
8.5 g sea salts (LB+hs) compared to MB was observed. On
the other hand, the E. coli donor strain ST18 [26] grew in
LB and even in LB+hs, but did not grow in high salt-containing media as MB and LB supplemented with 17 g sea
salts (LB+s). Thus, only half-concentrated MB (hMB)
allowed growth of all tested bacteria, albeit with partly
decreased growth rates compared to their commonly used
growth media.
It was reported that several antibiotics, including tetracycline and gentamicin, can be affected in their chemistry by
high salt concentrations as found in MB [27]. For example, the aminoglycoside kanamycin chelates Cu2+ [28]
and tetracycline forms complexes with divalent cations
such as Mg2+, Fe2+ and Ca2+. These interactions have no
significant impact on the stability of tetracycline, but
decrease the membrane permeability of a cell and therefore the bioavailability of this antibiotic [27,29-31]. Up to
ten times higher concentrations of gentamicin, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline were required for
Roseobacter growth inhibition in MB medium (data not
shown) compared to hMB with lower sea salt concentrations (see below). Control experiments with E. coli
showed that all used antibiotics were active over the
whole incubation time in hMB at chosen conditions (data
not shown). Consequently, hMB medium was used for
further investigations.
Screening of Roseobacter clade bacteria for antibiotic
susceptibility
The six different species of the Roseobacter clade were
examined for their antibiotic susceptibility. Furthermore,

seven strains of D. shibae, isolated from different marine
sources, were tested for the degree of susceptibility difference within one species. Such strain-specific differences
were already described for other species as E. coli [32],
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [33] and other pathogens [34].
Table 2 represents the MIC in hMB medium after 72 h at
30°C. We tested antibiotics from different chemical
groups, which are commonly used in molecular biology,
such as tetracycline, chloramphenicol, the aminoglycosides kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin and spectinomycin as well as the two β-lactam antibiotics ampicillin
and carbenicillin. Concentrations of up to 500 μg/ml were
used. Bacteria able to grow above a concentration of 100
μg/ml of the respective antibiotic were defined as resistant.
All tested species showed different susceptibilities to the
antibiotics (Table 2). As expected, the seven D. shibae
strains followed the same trend, with slight variations.
They were all resistant to the β-lactam antibiotics ampicillin and carbenicillin. The level of tolerance to ampicillin
was up to 500 μg/ml. The Phaeobacter strains, R. denitrificans and R. litoralis also showed resistance to ampicillin,
whereas, in contrast to D. shibae, they were sensitive to
carbenicillin. Initially, we hypothesised, that the unexpected high ampicillin tolerance might occur due to instability of this antibiotic. It has been reported that
ampicillin lost 28% of activity after 24 h at room temperature [30]. However, control experiments with the E. coli
strain DH5α revealed complete activity of ampicillin even
after incubation for five days at 30°C (data not shown).
Analysing the annotated genomes of the strains by BLAST
search and functional predictions (for details see Methods
section), we identified genes encoding for β-lactamases,
indicating that they are widespread over the Roseobacter
clade. They were also found in R. denitrificans, R. litoralis,
P. gallaeciensis, O. indolifex and D. shibae. For the latter
strain, three β-lactamases encoding genes were identified
[using ROSY; [12]]. Thus, the inactivation of the antibiotics via degradation by β-lactamases seems to be an intrinsic resistance mechanism.

aThe Roseobacter strains were cultivated at 30°C and 200 rpm. E. coli
was cultivated at 37°C and 200 rpm. For growth of E. coli ST18 the
media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml ALA. The results represent
the mean value of two independent experiments performed in
duplicate. A standard deviation of up to 16% was observed.

Susceptibility of the Roseobacter strains differed towards
the four tested aminoglycosides. R. denitrificans showed
no susceptibility to all tested aminoglycosides. In contrast
R. litoralis and P. gallaeciensis were sensitive to this group
of antibiotics. Growth of P. inhibens was inhibited by high
concentrations of kanamycin, but the bacterium reacted
very sensitive to spectinomycin and gentamicin. The D.
shibae strains were resistant to kanamycin, but relatively
sensitive to the three other aminoglycosides. O. indolifex
was susceptible to all aminoglycosides.
The resistance to the aminoglycoside gentamicin was
already reported by Shiba [1991] as one of the characterPage 3 of 12

determination of the MIC was performed in hMB after 72 h at 30°C. Fresh antibiotic stock solutions (10 mg/ml) were made for every
experiment. Test tubes were inoculated to an OD578 of 0.05 with over night cultures of the Roseobacter strains in MB at 30°C. The results

istic properties of R. denitrificans. The corresponding
genome exhibits a gene encoding for a putative aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, a type of enzyme inactivating
aminoglycosides via modification [using IMG; [35], and
ROSY; [12]]. Putative aminoglycoside phosphotransferase
genes were also found in the D. shibae genome and those
of other Roseobacter clade species. Most of these strains
contain two putative genes, except for D. shibae DFL12T
which exhibits 10 genes [using IMG; [35]]. This observation might explain the high kanamycin tolerance of D.
shibae.
The MICs for tetracycline and chloramphenicol were in a
range of 10 - 50 μg/ml and 10 - 30 μg/ml, respectively.
None of the tested species showed resistance to these two
antibiotics. In summary, we identified at least three antibiotics for every strain which are suitable as selective makers for use in molecular biology and genetic protocols. In
the following experiments we used twice the amount of
the MIC for the selection of plasmid-containing strains
and for the maintenance of the plasmids within the Roseobacter strains. Several groups reported that the MICs of
bacteria grown in liquid cultures can be lower than for the
same bacteria grown on agar plates as biofilms [36,37].
Control experiments demonstrated that only plasmidcontaining cells survived twice of the MIC via expression
of the plasmid-encoded resistance gene. Also in case of
differences between MICs determined in static liquid cul-

ture and in aerated liquid cultures, the use of twice of the
MIC ensured selection of plasmid-containing cells.
Roseobacter clade bacteria are resistant to common
chemical transformation approaches
First, chemical transformation methods [38] were tested
for the transformation of the various Roseobacter strains.
Chemo-competent cells were prepared with CaCl2 and
furthermore with RbCl2. Plasmid-DNA transfer experiments were carried out by mixing bacteria with 50 ng plasmid-DNA (pBBR1MCS), followed by a 30 minincubation on ice and a subsequent 2 min heat shock at
42°C similar to the standard procedure for E. coli [38].
Transformation of Roseobacter strains led to no transformants, either with CaCl2-competent or with RbCl2-competent cells. No transformants were observed for any of the
12 tested strains. Similar observations were made for Rhodobacter strains, which are close relatives of the Roseobacter
strains [39]. Only one successful approach was described
for R. sphaeroides in 1982 [16]. Initial experiments using
the published method did not lead to transformants of
Roseobacter clade bacteria.
Transformation of Roseobacter clade bacteria via
electroporation
Since common chemical transformation methods as
described by Sambroock et al. [1989] did not lead to successful DNA transfer in Roseobacter clade bacteria (see
Page 4 of 12

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:265

above), the electroporation method was tested. Electroporation was performed following the protocol of Miller and
Belas [2006]. This method was successfully used for other
members of the Roseobacter clade as Silicibacter sp. [19,20]
and S. pomeroyi [22]. Salt-free cell suspensions were prepared by washing with 10% (v/v) glycerol in ultra-pure
water. We tested the washing procedure with increasing
numbers of separate washing steps. A minimal of 5 washing steps was necessary to effectively remove the salts from
culture media, verified by a resulting optimal pulse length
of 4.9 - 5.0 ms. The competent cells were subsequently
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Under these
conditions cells can be stored for about 3 weeks, except of
R. denitrificans, which was viable only for a maximum of
1 week. We used 25 ng and 50 ng plasmid-DNA
(pBBR1MCS), both resulting in similar transformation
rates. Different pulse intensities were tested (1.5 - 3.0 kV).
An intensity of 2.5 kV revealed the best results and was
used for further experiments. The electroporation method
was successful for all tested strains, although transformation rates differed between them. A maximum of 1 × 103
cfu/μg plasmid-DNA were observed for P. inhibens and R.
litoralis. Slightly higher efficiencies of 1 × 104 cfu/μg plasmid-DNA were observed for D. shibae and R. denitrificans.
Good efficiencies were observed for P. gallaeciensis with 1
× 105 cfu/μg plasmid- DNA and O. indolifex with an efficiency of 1 × 107 cfu/μg plasmid-DNA. Recently, an optimized electroporation method was described for the
Gram-negative P. aeruginosa resulting in transformation
efficiencies ranging from 107 to 1011 cfu/μg plasmid-DNA
[40]. These results are comparable with the efficiencies
obtained in O. indolifex, indicating that our protocol is
sufficient for the members of the Roseobacter clade.
Although the transformation efficiencies are much less for
most of the tested Roseobacter strains, this technique can
be used as a fast and easy method to transfer plasmids into
Roseobacter cells.
Efficient conjugal transformation of Roseobacter clade
bacteria
Biparental mating using E. coli S17-1 as donor strain was
described for plasmid transfer into S. pomeroyi and Sulfitobacter before [21,23]. Thereby, the use of spontaneous
emerged antibiotic-resistant mutants of the recipient
strains is one of the principles used to counter-select
against the E. coli donor strain after conjugation [e.g.
[23,41]]. It is well known that such mutations may also
cause indirect pleiotropic effects that might influence the
general physiology of the target strain. Changes in growth
behaviour, uracil sensitivity and bacteriophage sensitivities were reported for spontaneous rifampicin-resistant
mutants [42,43]. A second approach utilises auxotrophic
donor strains. Here, we used E. coli ST18 as donor strain
for the conjugation procedure, which is a hemA mutant of
E. coli S17 λ-pir [26]. This strain cannot synthesize the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/265

general tetrapyrrole precursor aminolevulinic acid (ALA).
Hence, to complement the lethal mutation ALA has to be
added to the medium for growth. Consequently, for the
selection of plasmid-containing Roseobacter recipients
after conjugation hMB agar plates without ALA were used
to inhibit growth of the E. coli donor cells. Several conditions of the conjugation procedure were varied including
medium composition and conjugation time (for details
see Methods section). We found no obvious differences
between 24 h- and 48 h-conjugation time (data not
shown). Even conjugation times below 24 h might be sufficient for the fast growing Phaeobacter strains and O.
indolifex.
Only two of the tested growth media provided appropriate conditions for donor and recipient strains (see above).
Therefore, conjugation was carried out at 30°C on hMB
and LB+hs agar plates supplemented with ALA. Media
composition revealed a significant effect on conjugation
efficiency. ALA supplemented hMB resulted in higher conjugation efficiencies. Various ratios of donor to recipient,
related to the optical density of the cultures, were tested
(1:1, 2:1, 5:1, 10:1). Best conjugation efficiencies were
obtained with ratios of 5:1 and 10:1, ranged between 1 ×
10-6 and 2.4 × 10-2 (Table 3). The lowest efficiencies were
observed for the Phaeobacter and Roseobacter strains.
Several plasmids were tested for transfer via conjugation.
These plasmids were successfully used for homologous
expression of genes to complement gene knockouts in
trans in other Gram-negative bacteria before. The IncPplasmids pFLP2, pLAFR3 and pUCP20T were not transferable or not stable in the tested Roseobacter strains (see
below). In contrast, the IncQ-plasmids pRSF1010,
pMMB67EH and the tested pBBR1MCS derivates were

37°C. Mating mixtures were incubated on hMB supplemented with 50

Afterwards, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml MB, diluted serially in
1.7% (w/v) sea salt solution and plated on hMB with and without
antibiotics, respectively, to determine the number of conjugants and

transferable. They were recovered from exconjugants by
plasmid-DNA preparation and subsequently visualized
via gel electrophoresis.
Plasmid Stability
There is only one report about homologous gene expression in Roseobacter clade bacteria using the vector pRK415
[21]. This vector was widely used for a broad range of
Gram-negative species, including R. sphaeroides [e.g.
[44,45]]. However, the small numbers of restriction
enzyme sites available for cloning and the use of tetracycline as selective marker represent major drawbacks for its
use. Therefore, we tested the stability of several mobilizable plasmids of different sizes, carrying different antibiotic
resistance genes and origins of replication that belong to
distinct incompatibility groups (IncP, IncQ). The maintenance of the plasmids was analysed by spreading cells,
which were grown over 10 passages until stationary phase
in MB without antibiotics, on hMB agar plates in the presence and absence of antibiotics. Moreover, we tested the
cells for the presence of the plasmid by plasmid preparation and visualisation via gel electrophoresis. A reproducible and stable transformation of the Roseobacter cells was
only obtained with pBBR1MCS derivates. This broadhost-range vector contains the origin of replication of
pBBR1 from Bordetella bronchiseptica. It has a wide compatibility to IncQ, IncP, IncW, ColE1 and p15A ori plasmids [46,47]. The IncQ containing plasmids pRSF1010
and pMMB67EH were also transferable into the Roseobacter bacteria, except for the Phaeobacter strains. But in
contrast to pRSF1010, pMMB67EH was not stable and got
lost after 1 - 2 passages even in the presence of selection
pressure. Interestingly, the IncP plasmids pLAFR3,
pUCP20T and pFLP2, which are suitable for many other
Gram-negative bacteria [48-50], were not transferable or
not stable in the tested Roseobacter strains.

The members of the Roseobacter clade contain up to 13
natural plasmids in a size range of 4.3 - 821.7 kb [4]. For
example, D. shibae DFL12T type strain contains five plasmids with a size of 72 to 190 kb [51]. Three of the five
plasmids harbor a repABC-type replicon, one contains a
repA- and one a repB-type replicon [51]. The stability of
different plasmids within one cell depends mainly on
their incompatibility groups, which are based on the
nature of genetic elements involved in plasmid replication
or partitioning [15]. Incompatibility is thereby a manifestation of relatedness of these elements, meaning that plasmids with closely related replication origins are
incompatible and therefore not stable within one cell
[15]. The replicons of the IncP plasmids seem to be closely
related to the natural plasmids of the Roseobacter bacteria,
resulting in the observed instability.
Moreover, at least four of the five plasmids of D. shibae
contain additional systems for plasmid maintenance.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/265

These are composed of two small genes, encoding a stable
toxin as well as a less stable antitoxin [51]. The antitoxin
must be continually produced to prevent the long-living
toxin from killing the cell. Otherwise the toxin induces
cell death once the plasmid gets lost during cell division
[51,52]. Such toxin/antitoxin systems are characteristic for
low copy plasmids and provide plasmid specific differences between various vectors and therefore sustain their
compatibility and plasmid replacement protection [53].
Reporter gene system
Reporter genes are commonly used for the analysis of promoter activities and transcriptional regulation events. A
system using lacZ reporter gene fusions was recently
described for Sulfitobacter [23]. Using the novel broadhost-range expression vector pRhokHi-2FbFP [54] based
on the conjugally transferable and stably maintained plasmid pBBR1MCS, a novel expression system was established. The vector pRhokHi-2 has been designed for
constitutive expression of target genes in the phototrophic
bacterium R. capsulatus. For the analysis of vector-mediated gene expression a pRhokHi derivative was used harbouring a reporter gene encoding the oxygenindependent, flavin mononucleotide-based fluorescent
protein FbFP from Bacillus subtilis as reporter [55]. Thus, it
is applicable under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions [55]. For many natural habitats oxygen limiting conditions are of central importance. However, the
commonly employed reporters including β-galactosidase,
luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) require oxygen for dye development, bioluminescence and fluorescence [55]. For a proof of principle the fbFP gene was
cloned under the control of the constitutive promoter of
the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase II (aphII) gene in
a pBBR1MCS derivate [55]. The plasmid was introduced
into the Roseobacter strains by conjugation and fluorescence measurement were made of the fbFP expressing
recipients in comparison to the wildtype strains. Clear
emission signals were observed in the range of 15 RFU for
O. indolifex to 72 RFU for P. gallaeciensis at 520 nm upon
excitation with blue-light at 450 nm (Figure 1). The
altered range of fluorescence might be explained by different copy numbers of the plasmid, different codon usages
or different promoter utilisation by the tested strains. The
stability and the evenly distribution of pRhokHi-2FbFP
within the populations was verified by fluorescence
microscopy (data not shown). The observations indicated
that FbFP can be used for in vivo fluorescence measurements in various Roseobacter strains.
Gene deletion mutants of D. shibae DFL12T
The dissimilative nitrate respiration regulator Dnr is a global regulator for anaerobic growth under denitrifying conditions in pseudomonads [56-58]. Six homologous genes
were identified in the genome of D. shibae. For the construction of a gene deletion mutant of one of these dnr

genes (Dshi_3189) the vector pEX18Δdnr::Gmr was constructed (Figure 2A). Replacement of the dnr gene with the
gentamicin cassette was varified via PCR (Figure 2B)
resulting in a 2.12 kb fragment for the wildtype corresponding to the 711 bp dnr gene, the 652 bp upstream
region and the 758 bp downstream region of dnr. For the
deletion mutants a 3.21 kb fragment was observed containing the up- and downstream regions and the 1.8 kb
gentamicin cassette.
Growth behaviour analysis of D. shibae DFL12T under
anaerobic conditions with nitrate as electron acceptor
clearly showed that D. shibae was able to grow by denitrification (Figure 2C). This is of special interest, since D.
shibae was previously described as strict aerobic bacterium
[25]. The recently sequenced and annotated genome on
D. shibae DFL12T recovered clusters of genes necessary for
anaerobic metabolism [51].
The comparison of the D. shibae wildtype to the obtained
dnr- mutants revealed a significant reduction of anaerobic
nitrate respiratory growth of the tested mutants (Figure
2C), demonstrating the influence of the regulator Dnr on
the growth under denitrifying conditions. The presence of
six dnr genes indicated a fine-tuned regulation of this metabolic pathway. This was confirmed by the minor growth
reduction of the dnr mutants.

Roseobacter clade bacteria. A reporter gene system and a
chromosomal gene knockout system were based on these
methods and applied to selected members of the clade.
Since the methods shown here were functional in all of
the tested species ranging over the whole phylogenetic
tree of the Roseobacter clade, an easy and successful transfer to other members of this group can be proposed.

Initial experiments with a dnr mutant of D. shibae showed
an influence of this regulator on the growth under denitrifying conditions.

Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and growth conditions
Strains used in this study are described in Table 4. Table 5
shows the used plasmids. The Escherichia coli strain ST18
was cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium prepared of 10
g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract and 10 g NaCl in 1 L H2O
dest., supplemented with 50 μg/ml aminolevulinic acid
(ALA, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) at 37°C and 200
rpm as described before [26]. The marine bacteria of the
Roseobacter clade were usually cultured in the commercial
available Marine Broth (MB, Roth) at 30°C and 200 rpm.
For the preparation of half-concentrated MB (hMB) 20.05
g media were dissolved in 1 l H2O dest.. After autoclaving,
MB containing media were sterile filtered to remove precipitates. LB containing 17 g sea salts (Sigma-Aldrich,
Munich, Germany; LB+s) and LB supplemented with 8.5
g sea salts (LB+hs) were prepared for the determination of
the optimal growth conditions of the Roseobacter bacteria.
For the preparation of agar plates 1.5% (w/v) agar (Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany) were added and dissolved by heating prior to autoclaving. For anaerobic growth, MB was
supplemented with 25 mM nitrate. Anaerobic flasks were
used for incubation at 30°C and 100 rpm.
Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration
For the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) 5 ml hMB was supplemented with freshly
prepared antibiotic solutions from 0 - 500 μg/ml in 5 μg
steps. Test tubes were inoculated with cultures of the
respective bacterial strains grown for 24 h in MB to an
OD578 of 0.05. Subsequently, bacterial growth was
checked by OD578 measurements after incubation for 3

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/265

and 5 days at 30°C without shaking. The MIC is defined
as the lowest concentration of a tested antibiotic, which
inhibits the growth of bacteria. All experiments were
repeated three times in duplicate. The used antibiotics
were obtained from manufactures as followed: ampicillin
(Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), carbenicillin disodium salt
(Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH, Gaiberg, Germany), chloramphenicol (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), gentamicin sulphate (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), kanamycin sulfate
(Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH, Gaiberg, Germany), spectinomycin dichloride pentahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany), streptomycin sulphate (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, USA), tetracycline hydrochloride (United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, USA).
For selection of plasmid-containing Roseobacter recipients
on agar plates after conjugation the twofold concentration
of the MIC of the respective antibiotic in hMB was used.
Preparation of chemically competent cells for the transfer
of plasmid-DNA into Roseobacter strains
Chemo-competent cells were prepared as described by
Sambrook et al. [1989]. To prepare CaCl2- competent
cells, the Roseobacter strains were cultivated in MB at 30°C
and 200 rpm up to an OD578 of 0.7. Ten ml of the culture
were centrifuged for 15 min at 3,200 × g and 4°C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 2 ml cold 10% (v/v) glycerol with 100 mM CaCl2 in ultra-pure water and
centrifuged for 2 min at 8,000 × g and 4°C. Afterwards,
the cells were resuspended in 100 μl cold 10% (v/v) glycerol with 100 mM CaCl2 in ultra-pure water and incubated on ice for 1 h. Subsequently, 200 μl aliquots were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

To prepare RbCl2-competent cells, the Roseobacter strains
were cultivated in 20 ml MB supplemented with 400 μl of
a stock solution containing 500 mM MgCl2 and 500 mM

MgSO4 at 30°C and 200 rpm up to an OD578 of 0.7. Four
ml of the culture were centrifuged for 2 min at 8,000 × g
and 4°C. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml ice cold transformation buffer (100 mM CaCl2, 50 mM RbCl2, 40 mM
MnCl2) and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by a
centrifugation step for 2 min at 8,000 × g and 4°C. Finally,
cells were resuspended in 200 μl transformation buffer.
The chemo-competent cells were stored on ice until they
were used or frozen at -80°C in 20% (v/v) glycerol.
For the transformation, 200 μl of chemo-competent cells
(CaCl2- or RbCl2-competent) were gently mixed with 50
ng plasmid-DNA and incubated for 30 min on ice. After a
heat shock for 2 min at 42°C, 800 μl MB medium was
added and the bacteria were incubated for 3 h at 30°C for
the expression of the antibiotic resistance marker encoded
by the plasmid. Afterwards the cells were sedimented by
centrifugation for 2 min at 8,000 × g and 4°C and the
supernatant was decanted. Cells were resuspended in the
residual liquid and spread on hMB agar supplemented
with the appropriate antibiotic.
Transfer of plasmid-DNA into Roseobacter strains by
electroporation
Electro-competent cells were prepared as described previously by Miller and Belas [2006] with slight modifications. Therefore, cells were grown in MB medium at 30°C
and 200 rpm to an OD578 of 0.5. Ten ml culture was centrifuged for 15 min at 3,200 × g. Sedimented cells were
washed 5 times with 10 ml cold 10% (v/v) glycerol in
ultra-pure water. Then, the cell pellet was resuspended in
400 μl 10% (v/v) glycerol and 50 μl aliquots were frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. For electroporation, 25 - 50 ng plasmid-DNA were added to 50 μl competent cells in an ice cold 2 mm pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad,
Munich, Germany). The mixture was treated in a Bio Rad
gene pulser II with field strength of 1.5 - 3.0 kV, resistance

of 200 Ω and capacitance of 25 μF. After electroporation
the cells were transferred to 1 ml cold MB media and incubated overnight at room temperature with shaking at 300
rpm to allow the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.
To investigate electroporation efficiency, cells were serially diluted in 1.7% (w/v) sea salt solution and plated on
hMB agar plates with the appropriate antibiotic concentration and incubated for 2 days (Phaeobacter strains and
O. indolifex) or 4 days (Roseobacter strains and D. shibae) at
30°C. Subsequently, colony forming units (cfu) were
determined.
Conjugal transfer of plasmid-DNA from E. coli into
Roseobacter strains
The conjugation procedure was modificated for Roseobacter strains from the protocol of Thoma and Schobert
[2009]. The recipient Roseobacter strains were cultivated
for 18 h in MB-Medium. The donor E. coli strain ST18 was
grown in LB-medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ALA
(Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) up to the logarithmic
phase (OD578 = 0.5 - 0.6). Both cultures were mixed in a
donor:recipient ratio of 1:1; 2:1; 5:1 or 10:1 according to
the optical density (OD578) of the cultures. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation for 2 min at 8,000 × g at 20°C,
resuspended in the residual liquid and used to inoculate
hMB agar, LB+hs agar and hLB+hs agar respectively, all
supplemented with 50 mg/ml ALA, in form of a spot. The
plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 h and 48 h. Subsequently, cells were scraped from the plate and resuspended in 1 ml MB by vigorous shaking. Disruption of
cell aggregates was confirmed via microscopic inspection
of the resulting single cells. A dilution series in 1.7% (w/
v) sea salt solution was prepared and plated on hMB with
the appropriate antibiotic concentration to determine the
number of transconjugants per ml. Since the plates did
not contain ALA the auxotrophic donor E. coli strain was
not able to grow. In parallel, transconjugants were also

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:265

plated on hMB without antibiotics to determine the
number of viable cells per ml. The efficiency of conjugation was defined as the ratio between conjugants:viable
cells. Moreover, a minimum of 10 exconjugants were
tested for the presence of the plasmid by plasmid-DNA
isolation and gel electrophoresis.
Isolation of plasmid-DNA from the Roseobacter strains
Plasmids used in this study were isolated using the mini
plasmid isolation kit from Qiagen (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturers' instructions for
Gram-negative bacteria.
Genome analysis and bioinformatics approach
For genome analysis of the Roseobacter strains the databases of the Joint Genome Institute http://
www.jgi.doe.gov [35] and the Roseobacter database http://
rosy.tu-bs.de/ [12] were used. Open reading frames were
identified using BLASTX analysis with a cutoff E value of
1e-5. β-lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes
from P. aeruginosa and E. coli were used for the study.
Moreover, Pfam [59], TIGRfam [60] and COG [61] predictions were used to identify functional homologues.

The genome of D. shibae DFL12T was sequenced at the
Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Production Genomics Facility. The sequences, comprising a chromosome and 5 plasmids, can be accessed using the GenBank accession
numbers NC_009952, NC_009955, NC_009956,
NC_009957, NC_009958 and NC_009959. Manual curation and reannotation of the genome was carried out
using the Integrated Microbial Genomes Expert Review
System (img/er http://imgweb.jgi-psf.org) [51] and the
Artemis software package http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Soft
ware/Artemis/v9.
The complete and annotated genome sequences of Roseobacter denitrificans strain OCh 114 and its associated plasmids have been deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank
database under accession numbers CP000362,
CP000464, CP000465, CP000466, and CP000467. Initial
annotation data were built using the Annotation Engine at
The Institute for Genomic Research http://www.tigr.org/
edutraining/training/annotation_engine.shtml, followed
by comprehensive manual inspection and editing of each
feature by using Manatee http://manatee.sourceforge.net/
.
Fluorescence imaging of reporter gene carrying cells
Some of the Roseobacter clade members were fluorescence
labelled using the FMN-based fluorescence protein FbFP
[55] (available as evoglow-Bs1 from Evocatal GmbH,
Düsseldorf, Germany). Therefore, the fluorescence
reporter gene was constitutively expressed using the
broad-host-range expression vector pRhokHi-2-FbFP [54].
Fluorescence microscopy was used for in vivo fluorescence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/265

imaging of living cells. An aliquot of the microbial cell
culture was placed on a microscope slide and illuminated
with light of the wavelength 455-495 nm. Fluorescence
emission of single cells was analyzed in the ranges of 500550 nm using a Zeiss Fluorescence Microscope (Axiovert
200 M) at a magnification of 600-fold. Documentation
was carried out using the camera AxioCam (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) and the software AxioVision Rel 4.5 (Carl
Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Quantification of reporter gene activity
Liquid cultures (MB, 48 h, 30°C, 200 rpm) of the
pRhokHi-2-FbFP containing Roseobacter strains were
diluted in MB to an OD578 of 0.7 and excited with light of
the wavelength of 450 nm. Fluorescence emission was
detected at 475 - 550 nm. Cultures of the wildtype strains
served as negative control. For quantification of the fluorescence the luminescence spectrometer LS 50 B (Perkin
Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) was used.
Construction of D. shibae DFL12T dnr (Dshi_3189)
deletion mutants
To obtain gene deletion mutants from D. shibae DFL12T,
the well-established suicide vector for Gram-negative bacteria pEX18Ap was used [48]. To construct the gene deletion vector pEX18Δdnr::Gmr, the SacI-digested Ωgentamicin resistance cassette of pPS858 [48] was cloned
between two PCR fragments of the dnr gene (Dshi_3189)
in the multiple cloning site of pEX18Ap. The two PCR
fragments contained DNA homologous to upstream and
downstream regions of the Dshi_3189 gene. A 652-bp
fragment containing the upstream promoter region of
Dshi_3189 was amplified using primer oPT19 (5'-GGGGTACCAATGCCATGACCT ACTTC-3'), which contains a
KpnI restriction site at the 5' end, and oPT20 (5'CGAGCTCCGCATGAACGAGTCATCTT-3'), containing a
SacI site (both restriction sites underlined). The primers
oPT21 (5'-CGAGCTCAGCAGAACCATGCGGAGAT-3'),
containing a SacI site, and oPT22 (5'-CCCAAGCTTTCACCAGCGGGCTTTTC-3'), which contains a HindIII site
(both restriction sites underlined), amplified 758 bp of
the corresponding downstream region of Dshi_3198. The
suicide vector pEX18Δdnr::Gmr was used to replace the
Dshi_3198 gene with the Ω-gentamicin cassette. To confirm homologous recombination PCR analysis was performed. Furthermore, the growth behaviour of the
resulting mutants was analysed under anaerobic conditions with nitrate as electron acceptor, as outlined before
[57].
