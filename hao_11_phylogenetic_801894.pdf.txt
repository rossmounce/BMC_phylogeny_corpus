Abstract
Background: Porcine parvovirus (PPV) usually causes reproductive failure in sows. The objective of the present
study was to analyze the phylogenetic distribution and perform molecular characterization of PPVs isolated in
China, as well as to identify two field strains, LZ and JY. The data used in this study contained the available
sequences for NS1 and VP2 from GenBank, as well as the two aforementioned Chinese strains.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis shows that the PPV sequences are divided into four groups. The early Chinese PPV
isolates are Group I viruses, and nearly all of the later Chinese PPV isolates are Group II viruses. LZ belongs to
group II, whereas the JY strain is a Group III virus. This is the first report on the isolation of a Group III virus in
China. The detection of selective pressures on the PPV genome shows that the NS1 and VP2 genes are under
purifying selection and positive selection, respectively. Moreover, the amino acids in the VP2 capsid are highly
variable because of the positive selection.
Conclusions: Our study provides new molecular data on PPV strains in China, and emphasizes the importance of
etiological studies of PPV in pigs.

Background
From a worldwide perspective, the porcine parvovirus
(PPV) is one of the most common viral causes of porcine reproductive failure. PPV is of the genus Parvovirus, a group of viruses of that also infect cattle, cats,
dogs, geese, rats, mice, mink, and raccoons. Although
PPV is distinguishable from parvoviruses of all other
species, it is antigenically related to other parvoviruses
such as the canine parvovirus (CPV) and the feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) [1]. The PPV genome is a single
strand DNA with a terminal palindromic structure. Its
size is about 5 kb. The PPV particle is composed of
three viral polypeptides, VP1, VP2, and VP3, with molecular weights of 83, 64, and 62 kDa, respectively. In
vitro expression of the VP2 gene may spontaneously
form the capsid. The structure of the VP2 capsid was
resolved using X-ray crystallography and was found to
be similar to the CPV, FPV, and minute viruses of mice

(MVM) [2]. Pigs immunized with these virus-like particles mounted an immune response identical to that
toward commercial vaccines [3]. Recently, the genome
of PPV was found to contain a small open reading
frame, designated as SAT, with a start codon downstream of the VP2 initiation codon [4]. In addition to
these capsid proteins, some nonstructural polypeptides,
such as NS1, NS2, and NS3, have also been identified in
PPV-infected cells. Differentiation of infected pigs from
vaccinated ones based on antibodies for NS1 protein
using inactivated vaccine is possible, as NS1 protein is
absent in purified virions used as a killed vaccine [5,6].
Since the first discovery of PPV in 1983, the virus has
spread widely in swine in China. Pigs are continuously
threatened by PPV. Many new field strains were isolated
from pigs in China, such as the China strain [6] and the
BQ and ZJ strains [7]. Although inactivated and attenuated vaccines are widely used in swine in China, PPV
infection is still a serious infectious disease. Therefore,
porcine parvovirus surveillance in China is needed to
learn the prevalence of PPV infections and to provide
efficient epidemiological data for its control.

Results
Genomic sequences of the LZ and JY strains

The entire coding sequences of the LZ ad JY isolates
contain 4509 and 4485 nucleotides, respectively, with no
insertions or deletions in the coding regions. The
sequences behind the VP2 stop codon of the LZ and JY
isolates lack 105 and 127 nucleotides, respectively. This
absence was also detected in some German isolates (e.g.,
PPV strains 15a, 143a, 106b, and Tornau), the American
isolate Kresse, and some Chinese isolates (e.g., PPV
strains BQ and ZJ). The complete sequences of LZ and
JY strains were submitted to GenBank [GenBank:
HM627652 and HM627653].
Phylogenetic analysis of porcine parvoviruses
isolated in China

To characterize the genetic relationships of porcine parvoviruses isolated in China, and to identify the two PPV
strains in this study, the phylogenetic trees of NS1 and
VP2 nucleotide sequences were constructed based on
the neighbor-joining method (Figure 1).
Four main groups or clades were formed in the NS1 and
VP2 phylogenetic trees despite the fact that some isolates

Page 2 of 8

were not provided in the NS1 tree. Group I comprises
some American strains (e.g., NADL-2, POVG, and Kresse),
Chinese strains (e.g., China, SR-1, Tai’an, BQ, NJ, and N),
the UK strain Challenge, and the Korean strain VRI-1.
Group II contains the Chinese strains LZ and ZJ, some
strains in the NS1 dataset (S-1, HN-Z1, Nanjing200801,
Nanjng200802, NJ-2, HN-Z3, and Nanjing-1), and one
strain in the VP2 dataset (LJL12). The strain SD-68 is
placed in Group I in the NS1 tree, and under Group II in
the VP2 tree. Group III contains three German isolates
(21a, 27a, and 15a) and our isolate JY. Finally, Group IV is
formed by five German isolates 225b, 143a, Tornau, 106b,
and IDT. The Chinese isolates are mainly in Group I and
II. Our isolate LZ belongs to Group II. However, another
isolate, JY, was characterized as a Group III virus. This is
the first isolation of a Group III virus in China.
Selective pressure analysis of the PPV genome

The selective pressures on the PPV genome were assessed
by calculating the difference between non-synonymous
(dN) and synonymous (dS) rates for the NS1 and VP2
genes. The average difference between dN and dS substitution rates (dN - dS) for NS1 was clearly negative

using MEGA version 4.1. Bootstrap values obtained from 1000 replicates are shown at the major nodes. The NS1 and VP2 sequences of CPV and
FPV were included as outgroups. The different groups in the trees are marked by different colors.

(-0.009955 ± 0.003446), based on the SNAP web utility

results. This indicates that NS1 is under purifying selection. In contrast, the average dN - dS for VP2 is clearly
positive (0.006535 ± 0.003717), suggesting a positive selection pattern (Figure 2).
The distribution of dN - dS along the NS1 sequence
shows that the negative values are distributed among
the first 130 amino acids and around residue 550.
According to previous studies, some amino acid residues
of VP2 protein, such as 378, 383, 436, and 565, are crucial to the function of the VP2 capsid [2]. The dN - dS
at sites 378, 383, 436, and 565 are 0.42, 0.4, 0.77, and
0.33, respectively, which indicates that all four residues
are under positive selection.
Molecular analysis of the VP2 capsid and amino acid
mutations in important residues

To find the molecular characteristics of the VP2 protein,
the amino acid sequence alignments of the deduced VP2
coding sequences were constructed with representative

Page 3 of 8

strains aligned against the conserved sequence of all
VP2 proteins. The alignment results of the complete
VP2 proteins are presented in Figure 3. A number of
polymorphic sites could be found along the VP2 amino
acid sequence. Some mutations among the amino acids
of the VP2 protein may distinguish different clades. For
instance, Groups II and III viruses have a specific
change at P436A and Q228E, respectively, whereas
T20A, R82K, A93E, P304T, I320T, and K407N are
unique to Group IV viruses.
In spite of the high levels of identity among the different parvovirus nucleotide sequences, parvovirus isolates
can be distinguished by host range, cell tropism, and
pathogenicity. In PPV, determinants for cell or tissue
tropism, host range, and hemagglutination properties
have been located within the capsid proteins. The biological significance of most of the sequence variations is
unclear. However, some important amino acids in the
VP2 protein have been identified by comparison of
infectious clones of the NADL-2 and the Kresse strains
[8,9], and by structure elucidation of the PPV capsids

using X-ray crystallography [2]. For instance, the amino
acids at positions 378, 383, and 436 are responsible for
the allotropic determinant, as identified by the replacement of these residues with the Bgl II fragment in the
infectious clone NADL-2. By mapping the key amino
acid sites in the 3D structure of the capsid, some residues were found on the capsid surface. These residues
are mapped to loop II for site 215, loops III and IV for
sites 378 and 383, respectively, and to the C-terminal

for site 565. Residue 436 is located on top of the threefold spike within loop IV, which is the most accessible
capsid structure and may be involved in tropism. Other
residues, such as sites 314 and 509, are also important
to the structural stability and biological function of the
capsid because of their interaction with surface residues.
As shown in Figure 3, the sequence difference mainly
occurs at positions 215, 378, 383, 436, and 565. The
Chinese viruses of Group I have S436 or P436 residues.

Hao et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:320
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/320

Residue A436 is unique to the Group II Chinese viruses.
The Group III viruses and most of Group IV have the
unique residue T436. The isolates JY and LZ have residues at T215, G378, Q383, and K565. However, a significant difference was found in A436 of the LZ strain and
T436 of the JY strain.
Sequence diversity of NS1 and VP2 protein

The distribution of genetic diversity across the NS1 and
VP2 proteins was investigated for 23 NS1 sequences and
25 VP2 sequences included in the previous phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 4). The polymorphic diversity of the
VP2 protein sequences was greater than that of NS1
protein sequences. The NS1 protein sequences contain
50/662 (7.55%) polymorphic amino acid positions and
have an overall amino acid diversity of 0.15 ± 0.03,
whereas the VP2 protein sequences contain 48/579
(8.29%) polymorphic amino acid positions and have an
overall amino acid diversity of 0.26 ± 0.05.

Discussion
PPV is found in almost all pig-breeding countries. The
PPV genome exhibits high genetic variation. Genetic

analysis of the VP2 PPV gene in Brazilian isolates
showed that two virus lineages existed in Brazilian swine
populations [10]. Germany has a long PPV infection history. Hence, the genetic variability of German PPV isolates is complicated. Phylogenetic analysis of the fulllength VP1 nucleotide sequences of German isolates
revealed two co-circulating clusters [11]. A further infection experiment showed that viruses of these two clusters are immunologically different, and indicated that
the variation in PPV is not only at the gene level, but
also at the antigenic level. Genome recombination in
PPV has also been reported [12]. Conflicting phylogenetic histories of the different PPV genome regions provide evidence for recombination within these regions.
Various PPV strains have been isolated in field samples from China [6,7]. In the phylogenetic tree, the early
Chinese PPV isolates, such as PPV strains N, China, and
SR-1, are mainly located in Group I. Almost all later
Chinese PPV isolates are Group II viruses, which are
composed of Chinese strains, such as PPV strains ZJ,
NJ-2, and nanjing200801. The LZ isolate also belongs to
group II in the NS1 and VP2 phylogenetic trees. JY, a
Chinese PPV strain, falls under Group III, which is

composed of German PPV isolates. This is the first isolation of a German-like PPV from field samples in
China. This provides new molecular data on PPV strains
in China, which may be used for etiological studies.
Considering the numerous PPV strains already
sequenced, this study attempted to determine the
genetic evolution of the PPV genome based on the
selective pressures on the NS1 and VP2 genes. These
PPV genes are under purifying selection and positive
selection, respectively, as the average dN - dS for NS1
and VP2 genes are negative and positive, respectively.
This suggests strong selection for the nonstructural proteins, which are less tolerant of amino acid alterations.
The NS1 gene is more conserved than the VP2 gene.
Hence, the NS1 gene may be regarded as the target
gene for PPV detection. In contrast, the VP2 gene is
inclined to mutate, especially in key points of the VP2
capsid, such as sites 378, 383, 436, and 565. These sites
are all under positive selection, which indicates that the
amino acid changes in these sites may be favorable for
the survival of PPV.
The sequence lengths of the VP2 codon vary among
different strains. The attenuated strain NADL-2 has a
127 bp repeat, and it is considered to be distinct from
the virulent isolates [8]. However, the repeat phenomenon was also found in the two virulent Chinese strains,
China and SR-1. Hence, determining the virulence of a
field strain based solely on the length of the repeat
sequence is difficult. The JY strain lacks the 127 bp
repeat, similar to the field strains Kresse, 15a, Tornau,
and 106b. The LZ strain, however, partially lacks
nucleotides in the repeat region. Analogously, the lymphotropic variant of MVM, MVMi, also lacks a 65 bp
repeat [13]. The tandem repeat might be important for
the replication of the viral genome because an infectious
clone of MVMp, which lacks one copy of the repeat
sequence, replicates at approximately 10% of wild viral
levels in A9 cells. In addition, the repeats are very ATrich (77%) and may have a negative effect on the stability of the transcripts [14].

Conclusions
The present study described the phylogenetic relationships, evolution, and genetic diversity of PPV strains isolated in China based on the NS1 and VP2 genes. A Group
III virus from China was isolated for the first time. This
study provides information for surveillance, prevention,
and control strategies for PPV infections in China.
Methods
Field samples

From May 2009 to February 2010, swine in Gansu Province suffered from reproductive failure. Clinical samples, including lungs, kidneys, livers, and lymph nodes

Page 6 of 8

from pigs suffering from SMEDI (stillbirth, mummification, embryonic death, and infertility) were collected.
Tissues samples from the pigs were homogenized for
DNA extraction or virus isolation, and stored at -70°C.
The sampling method was conducted in accordance
with the guidelines on animal experimentation of Chinese academy of agricultural sciences (CAAS).
Amplification of the of PPV whole sequences

The viral genome was directly extracted from the homogenized tissues using the EZNA Tissue DNA kit
(OMEGA, USA).
To understand the genetic characteristics of the newly
isolated PPV strains, five pairs of primers were designed
according to the conservative region of the whole
sequence of PPV (Table 1). The amplified regions cover
the whole genome of PPV with the exception of two
terminal palindromic structures. The PCR reactions
contained 4 μl extracted DNA, 1 μl primer pairs, 3 mM
dNTPs (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 5 μl 10 × LA Taq buffer, and 0.5 U LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China) in a total volume of 50 μl. The PCR amplification was initiated by a pre-denaturation phage at 95°C
for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C
for 1 min, annealing at temperatures ranging from 54 to
59°C (Table 1) for 30 s, and an extension at 72°C for
30-100 s (depending on the amplified fragment length).
Subsequently, the PCR products were ligated into a
pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) after gel
extraction, and were used to transform Escherichia coli
DH-5a-competent cells (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The
positive bacterial suspensions were sent to Invitrogen
Corporation (Shanghai, China) for sequencing. The
sequence assembly was carried out using the SeqMan
program of the DNASTAR Software (Madison, WI).
Sequence analysis

Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using
CLUSTAL W of the MegAlign program (DNASTAR),
and the unrooted phylogenetic trees of NS1 and VP2
gene were generated by the neighbor-joining method
using MEGA 4.1 software http://www.megasoftware.net/
mega4/mega41.html. Bootstrap values were calculated
based on 1,000 replicates. Aside from the complete
sequences of the two new Chinese strains JY and LZ,
several genomic sequences were available from GenBank. All NS1 and VP2 genes available from GenBank
were aligned to build the phylogenetic tree. The
sequences of the VP2 proteins were also aligned to
locate residue alterations. The virus isolates included 3
American strains, 8 Germany strains, 21 Chinese strains,
1 UK strain, and 1 South Korean strain (Table 2).
The selective pressures on the PPV genome were
assessed by calculating the differences between the non-
