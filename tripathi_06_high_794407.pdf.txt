Abstract
Background: The Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of both blood pressure and
kidney functions and their interaction. In such a situation, genetic variability in the genes of different
components of RAS is likely to contribute for its heterogeneous association in the renal disease
patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) is an important component of RAS which
determines the vasoactive peptide Angiotensin-II.
Methods: In the present study, we have investigated 127 ESRD patients and 150 normal healthy
controls from north India to deduce the association between ACE gene polymorphism and ESRD.
The inclusion criteria for patients included a constantly elevated serum creatinine level above
normal range (ranging from 3.4 to 15.8) and further the patients were recommended for renal
transplantation. A total of 150 normal healthy controls were also genotyped for ACE I/D
polymorphism. The criterion of defining control sample as normal was totally based on the absence
of any kidney disease determined from the serum creatinin level. Genotyping of ACE I/D were
assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based DNA amplification using specific flanking
primers Based on the method described elsewhere.
Results: The difference of DD and II genotypes was found highly significant among the two groups
(p = 0.025; OR = 3.524; 95%CI = 1.54-8.07). The combined genotype DD v/s ID+II comparison
validated that DD genotype is a high risk genotype for ESRD (p = 0.001; OR = 5.74; 95%CI limit =
3.4-8.5). However, no correlation was obtained for different biochemical parameters of lipid profile
and renal function among DD and non DD genotype. Interestingly, ~87% of the DD ESRD patients
were found hypertensive in comparison to the 65% patients of non DD genotype
Conclusion: Based on these observations we conclude that ACE DD genotype implicate a strong
possible role in the hypertensive state and in renal damage among north Indians. The study will help
in predetermining the timing, type and doses of anti-hypertensive therapy for ESRD patients.

Background
End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a complex disorder
encompassing a large variety of phenotypes. Each phenotype is a result of an underline kidney disease and superimposing environmental and genetic factors. The
complexity of the phenotypic makeup of renal diseases
makes it difficult to diagnose and predict their progression and to decide on the optimal treatment for each
patient. ESRD is an advanced form of chronic renal failure
where renal function has declined to approximately 10%
of normal prior to initiation of dialysis or transplantation.
The impact of genetic variability on the development of
renal failure is becoming clearer and emphasizes the need
to elucidate the genetic basis for renal diseases and its
complications. This would lead to the better understanding of different phenotypes observed in ESRD and would
enable us to determine whether a patient is genetically
predisposed to such complications.
Renal functions and blood pressure are tightly linked.
Physiologically, kidneys provide a key mechanism of
chronic blood pressure control via their infinite gain
mechanism [1], whereas elevated blood pressure affects
renal function via pressure natriuresis mechanism [2,3].
Pathophysiologically, long standing hypertension attenuates pressure natriuresis [4] and can cause or at least contribute to renal damage [5]. Therefore, hypertension is
one of the imperative contributing factors associated with
both causation and progression of renal failure [6]. It is a
common, polygenic and complex disorder resulting from
interaction of several genes with each other and with environmental factors [7].
The Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of
both blood pressure and kidney functions and may play a
role in their interaction. Its role in the pathogenesis of
hypertension is well documented but its contribution to
chronic renal failure and progression of kidney nephropathy is still debated [8]. It has been seen that RAS blockers
i.e. both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
and angiotensin receptor blockers lower blood pressure
and can also attenuate or prevent renal damage [9]. However, major inter individual treatment responses to RAS
inhibitors have been noted [10] and it remains difficult to
predict responders based on known pathophysiological
characteristics [11]. In such a situation, genetic variability
in the genes of different components of RAS is likely to
contribute for its heterogeneous association in the renal
disease patients.
Angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) is an important component of RAS and it determines the vasoactive
peptide Angiotensin-II. Its inhibition reduces the pace of
progression of majority of chronic nephropathies [12,13].
The gene coding for ACE is subjected to an insertion/dele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/7/15

tion (I/D) polymorphism that is a main determinant of
plasma and tissue ACE levels [14]. Presence (insertion-I)
or absence (deletion -D) of a 287 bp fragment in the 16th
intron of ACE gene has been linked to high prevalence of
renal disorders among hypertensives and has been studied extensively [15]. Furthermore, the D allele has been
linked to a failure of the renoprotective action of ACE
inhibitors to retard the development of end stage renal
disease (ESRD) [16,17]. Despite of the fact that most of
the recent studies have suggested high prevalence of D
allele among hypertensive individuals [13,18], still there
are contradictory reports available [19]. This inconsistency could be in part due to the genetic and environmental heterogeneity among different ethnic groups [20].
In the present study, we have investigated the association
between ACE gene polymorphism and the causation of
renal disease in 127 end stage renal disease patients from
north India. The major aim of the study was to explore
whether the limited observations of association of ACE
genotypes and renal function in patients of different ethnicities can be extended to all patients with primary renal
disease among North Indians.

Methods
Subjects
Patients included in the present study were selected from
the Department of Nephrology, which is one of the super
specialty centres in Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute
of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow. The inclusion
criteria for patients included a constantly elevated serum
creatinine level above normal range (ranging from 3.4 to
15.8) and further the patients were recommended for
renal transplantation. For each of the patient, the information was collected for various other criterion too that
included age, gender, protein urea level, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure and complete lipid profile (cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL, LDL and VLDL).
Depending on the type and the severity of renal disorders,
patients were categories into chronic glomerular nephropathy (CGN; n = 76), chronic intestinal nephropathy (CIN;
n = 31), Hypertensive nephrosclerosis (HN; n = 2) and
polycystic kidney (PK; n = 3). A total number of 127
patients were included in the study. All patients with Diabetic nephropathy were excluded from the study. A total
of 150 normal healthy controls were also genotyped for
ACE I/D polymorphism. A written consent was obtained
from the patients and the controls and it was documented
in the detailed performa. The controls were age, sex and
ethnically matched. The study was approved by the Ethical committee of SGPGIMS and department of biotechnology, government of India.

cation of the shorter D allele, a separate PCR was carried
out in all the DD samples.
The PCR amplicon were genotyped by separating them on
2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualizing with
ethidium bromide staining. The products were of the size
190 bp and 490 bp for I and D allele respectively. Hence,
single bands of 190 and 490 bp confirmed homozygous
DD and II genotypic state whereas two bands of 190 and
490 bp confirmed heterozygous ID genotype [Figure 1].
The allele sizing was carried out by using φHindIII digest
DNA ladder (Amersham Biosciences).

Blood collection
Blood samples for measuring Serum biochemical and
lipid profiles were obtained in the morning. Patients were
fasted for 8 hours. 3 ml of venous blood sample was collected in EDTA vials for the extraction of genomic DNA.
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from blood by salting out method
using phenol-chloroform as described by Coomey et al,
1994 [21] and was purified by ethanol precipitation. DNA
was used as a template for ACE polymorphism analysis.
Determination of ACE genotyping
Genotyping of ACE I/D were assayed by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) based DNA amplification using specific
flanking primers described elsewhere [8]. The primer
sequences were as follows: Sense primer: 5' CTGGAGACCACTCCCAT CCTTTCT 3' and antisense primer: 5' GATGTGGCCATCACATTCGTCAGAT 3'. PCR reaction was
performed in a final volume of 15 μl containing 5 pM/
sample of primers, 0.25 mM/sample dNTPs, DNA buffer
1X/sample, 1U/sample Taq polymerase and 50 ng of
genomic DNA. The DNA was amplified for initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C
for 1 min, 58.5°C for 90 min and 65°C for 4 min following a final extension of 72°C for 7 min (PTC 100, M J
Research, Peltier thermal cycler). In order to avoid the
mistyping of ID genotype as DD due preferential amplifi-

Statistical analysis
All the statistical calculation for the continuous data of
biochemical and physiological factors were performed
using SPSS version 10 statistical software packages. For
each variable, the values are expressed as mean ± S D. Data
was evaluated by One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. Allele and
genotypic frequencies for ACE I and D alleles were calculated with the gene counting method. Comparison of the
categorical data i.e. different ACE genotypes among controls and patients was done by Fischer's exact test and χ2
test. Odd's ratios were calculated with a 95% confidence
interval limit from 2 × 2 contingency table. ''P'' value <
0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Distributions of ACE genotypes
The distribution of DD, II and ID genotypes in the control
group (n = 150) was 10 (6.7%), 100 (66.7%) and
40(26.6%) respectively, whereas among patient group (n
= 127), 37 DD (29.13%), 48 II (37.79%) and 42 ID
(33.07%) patients were observed [Table 1] The difference
of DD and II genotypes was highly significant among the
two groups (p = 0.025). This clearly established that
patients with DD genotype are at high risk of developing
renal disease (OR = 3.524; 95%CI = 1.54-8.07). Further,
we have analyzed the data by pooling the ID genotype
with II and DD genotypes respectively. It was observed
that DD v/s ID+II comparison among the two groups were
significantly different (p = 0.0001) and clearly ascertain
that DD genotype is a high risk genotype as the OR value
was also found to be as high as 5.74 (95%CI limit = 3.48.5). Even when the heterozygous ID genotype was
pooled with DD then also the OR remained very high (OR
= 3.826; 95%CI = 2.04-7.15).

These highly significant differences observed among control and patient groups at the genotypic level were also visible at the allelic level [Table 1] as D allele was found in a
frequency of 0.2 among controls and was more than double among patients as its frequency was found to be 0.45
(p = 0.0001; OR = 3.362; 95%CI = 2.3-4.8).

Clinical characteristics of ESRD patients with different
ACE genotypes
In order to asses the cumulative affect of ACE gene polymorphism with other risk factors; we compared various
clinical parameters of the ESRD patients among two genotypic groups, DD and ID+II [Table 2]. It was observed
that neither mean age nor any of the five lipid parameters
namely TC, TG, HDL, LDL and VLDL differs significantly
among the two sub-groups (p > 0.05). Overall, the mean
age of the patients was found to be 35.32 ± 9.96. Similarly
the mean value of TC, TG, HDL, LDL and VLDL was found
to be 161.65 ± 3.3, 150.84 ± 5.7, 39.92 ± 0.84, 92.427 ±
2.61 and 34.07 ± 1.5 respectively [Table 2]. Similarly,
when two important renal function parameters i.e. serum
creatinin levels and protein urea were compared among
the two sub groups, the differences were found to be nonsignificant. The mean value of the serum creatinin and
protein urea among ESRD patients was found to be 8.38+
0.25 and 2.76 + 0.09 respectively [Table 2]. However,
when we compared the number of hypertensive patients
among the two sub groups it was noticeably evident that
~87% of the DD genotype patients were hypertensive as
compared to the 65% of II+ID genotype group (P =
0.026). The results further confirmed the association of

The data presented in this study is the first report from
north India regarding the role of genetic variants of ACE
gene in causation and progression of renal diseases. The
findings clearly establish the association of ACE I/D gene
polymorphism with the renal failure. The DD genotype
was found to be a major risk determinants of ESRD
among north Indians (OR = 5.74). Simultaneously, it was
also observed that the hypertensive state is an important
physiological state that affects the causation or progression of renal diseases.
Hypertension being a complex polygenic disorder is often
regarded as a physiological state affected by "Genetic Predisposition", which highlights the presence of heritable
allelic differences in the genes coding/associated with different components of RAS. Such differences result into differential transcript and protein expression accounting for
different rates of progression of hypertension and other
related diseases mainly, renal failures [22]. Among different RAS genes like angiotensin (AGT), angiotensin II type1 receptor (AGTR1), rennin and ACE, the I/D polymorphism of ACE has been reported as a crucial determinant.
The DD genotype have unanimously been shown to have
increased serum ACE production and activity while II and
ID genotypes produces low and intermediate levels of
proteins respectively [22].
Angiotensin II has a potentially important role in the
development of Glomerusclerosis [23] through its action
as a growth factor and regulator of the cell growth and
matrix production [24,25]. It has also been implicated
that the inhibition of its production attenuates the progression of diabetic and non -diabetic nephropathies
[26,27]. In this regard the importance of ACE and its
genetic variants becomes more apparent. Although most
of the studies on ACE I/D polymorphism have been very
encouraging with regard to the role of DD genotype in the

pathophysiology and treatment of diabetic nephropathies
[28]. Similar studies in other types of nephropathies have
yielded inconsistent results. For examples studies on autosomal dominant polycystic kidney patients have reported
adverse effects of the D allele of the ACE gene in some
cases [29,30], whereas number of other studies did not
confirmed such association [31,32]. Similarly, an adverse
effect of D allele was also found in some studies in IgA
nephropathy or ESRD in general [33]. In a study of 80
family trios (proband and parents) with interstitial
nephritis, the D allele was transmitted significantly and
more frequently than would have been expected if no
association existed. Further more, the ID and the DD genotypes were associated with a faster rate of renal function
decline [34].
Our study revealed a highly significant difference in the
presence of DD genotype and D allele of ACE gene among
ESRD patients and normal controls validating that the
ACE gene polymorphism is an important genetic determinant of non-diabetic nephropathies too. Overall findings
were demarcating that D allele of ACE gene confers a high
risk of developing renal diseases (OR = 3.36) and this
association was highly compounded when D allele was
present in homozygous state (OR = 5.74). Even inclusion
of the heterozygous ID state known to have intermediate
levels of ACE production along with the DD genotype
depicted a high risk of renal failures (OR = 3.8). Therefore
the finding that ACE DD genotype and D allele is associated with renal ESRD is likely to be true for the north
Indian populations.
Furthermore, we postulate that DD genotype confers a
greater role in hypertensive state as ~87% of DD genotype
patients were hypertensive and this phenomenon could
might have been the major factor behind the association
of ACE genotypes and ESRD patients from north India.
However, no significant differences of the renal function
parameters (serum creatinin and protein urea) among the
DD and non DD genotypes suggests that this variant
might not be a factor involved in the causation of renal
damage but could have aggravated or related to the progression of the disease. However, being a referral tertiary
care centre, most of the patients reported to us were from
outside and had incomplete records of various parameters
related to progression of the diseases. Hence due to the
non-availability of various data points required for the
regression analysis of serum creatinin profile, we have not
been able to evaluate the role of different ACE genotypes
in the progression of the disease as suggested by McLaughlin et al, 1996. [35].
Various reports are available supporting that how the
presence of DD genotype operates at cellular level leading
to hypertensive state and renal diseases [28]. Caucasians

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/7/15

with DD genotype have serum ACE levels and intra-cellular ACE activity twice than those of II genotype [22,36].
High ACE activity leads to increased Angiotensin II levels
that promote expression of growth factors and proliferation of mesanglial cells and matrix leading to glomerusclerosis [27]. Incidentally, human genetic variation
studies based on autosomal, Y-chromosomal and mtDNA markers have suggested that north Indians carry
high frequency of Caucasian specific mutations and haplotypes [37,38]. Furthermore, the phylogenetic assessments based on the neutral markers have also shown the
clustering of north Indians with other Caucasian populations [39,40].
In experimental models of chronic renal disease [41] and
in human diabetic nephropathy [42], pharmacological
blockade of ACE significantly slows down the rate of
decline in renal function. However, the data regarding the
relationship between the ACE inhibition and DD genotype has been conflicting. A good correlation was found in
IgA nephropathy and diabetic nephropathy [27] but was
not confirmed in primary glomerulonephritis [43] and
proteinurea [44]. In the present study, we have not been
able to deduce the association of ACE inhibition and DD
genotype due to non-availability of the information of
anti-hypertensive therapy.
In addition to the non availability of multiple values of
various renal function parameters and information of the
anti-hypertensive therapy, the results of the present study
may have also been influenced by the study design and
composition of the sample population. Regarding study
design, it may be possible that being a single centre study,
the samples are over representative of a particular genotype secondly it has been widely accepted that the Indian
society is fragmented into numerous sub-groups identified by the name of 'caste' and hence there is a high possibility that the social structuring and stringent marital
practices since last 3–4 Ky have also resulted into genetic
structuring. We suggest that multi centric studies involving a much higher number of subjects and including controls from different socio-cultural strata will lead to
validate the strong association found in the present study.

Conclusion
Conclusively, ACE gene polymorphism appears to be an
important genetic determinant in causation and progression of renal diseases and ACE DD genotype was found to
be strongly associated with ESRD among north Indians.
Further studies in this regard will open a plethora of
options like timing, type and doses of anti-hypertensive
therapy. Incorporation of such approaches will allow an
advance anticipation of the clinical outcome and can lead
to a shift from "One treatment fits all" approach.
