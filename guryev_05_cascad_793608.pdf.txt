Abstract
Background: With the recent progress made in large-scale genome sequencing projects a vast
amount of novel data is becoming available. A comparative sequence analysis, exploiting sequence
information from various resources, can be used to uncover hidden information, such as genetic
variation. Although there are enormous amounts of SNPs for a wide variety of organisms submitted
to NCBI dbSNP and annotated in most genome assembly viewers like Ensembl and the UCSC
Genome Browser, these platforms do not easily allow for extensive annotation and incorporation
of experimental data supporting the polymorphism. However, such information is very important
for selecting the most promising and useful candidate polymorphisms for use in experimental
setups.
Description: The CASCAD database is designed for presentation and query of candidate SNPs
that are retrieved by in silico mining of high-throughput sequencing data. Currently, the database
provides collections of laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) candidate SNPs.
The database stores detailed information about raw data supporting the candidate, extensive
annotation and links to external databases (e.g. GenBank, Ensembl, UniGene, and LocusLink),
verification information, and predictions of a potential effect for non-synonymous polymorphisms
in coding regions. The CASCAD website allows search based on an arbitrary combination of 27
different parameters related to characteristics like candidate SNP quality, genomic localization, and
sequence data source or strain. In addition, the database can be queried with any custom nucleotide
sequences of interest. The interface is crosslinked to other public databases and tightly coupled
with primer design and local genome assembly interfaces in order to facilitate experimental
verification of candidates.
Conclusions: The CASCAD database discloses detailed information on rat and zebrafish
candidate SNPs, including the raw data underlying its discovery. An advanced web-based search
interface http://cascad.niob.knaw.nl allows universal access to the database content and allows
various queries supporting many types of research utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Background
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most
common form of genetic variation within species. As a

result, SNPs are now becoming the most popular type of
marker in genetic association and mapping studies. SNPs
are also most likely to be the molecular basis for the

majority of phenotypic variation in (outbred) populations. In particular, SNPs in regulatory and protein-coding
regions can have an effect on gene expression levels and
protein activity, respectively. The phenotypic differences
observed between selected (sub) strains in model organisms may be the result of specific (combinations of) natural occurring polymorphisms. Hence, a comprehensive
inventory of SNPs, including extensive annotation will be
extremely valuable in the search for functional
polymorphisms.
There is often a vast unexplored potential in large
sequence datasets that have been collected for other purposes, for example, EST and whole genome sequencing
(WGS) projects. In an effort to address these two issues,
we have developed an in silico candidate SNP mining
pipeline that uses all publicly available sequence data for
a specific organism, and designed a database, CASCAD
(CAscad SNP CAndidates Database), that allows storage
of a wide variety of primary source data, cross-annotation
to other databases, and analysis parameters for SNPs associated with expressed sequences.

Construction and content
We applied the SNP discovery pipeline to both rat [1] and
zebrafish (unpublished results) and identified about
33,000 and 52,000 high-quality candidates, respectively,
that were extensively annotated and stored in the CASCAD database (Table 1). The database includes detailed
primary information on which the discovery of the candidate SNPs was based. This information, including
sequence quality information (Phred score), the number
of supporting reads for every nucleotide observed at the
SNP position, and expected alignment lengths, was found
to be very valuable for filtering for predicted variants that
have the highest likelihood to be experimentally confirmed. Two verification experiments for the rat resulted
in confirmation rate estimates of 59% (68 candidate SNPs
in 10 different laboratory rat strains) and 50.3 % (340
candidates in 5 laboratory and 2 wild rat isolates) [1]. A
set of 139 CASCAD entries tested in 7 zebrafish isolates
confirmed 67.6% of them as true polymorphisms
(unpublished data). The success rate values obtained are
likely to be underestimates since only limited number of
isolates/samples were used and we were unable to include
exactly the same isolates that were used for generating the
primary data (e.g. EST sequencing).
We designed a web-based interface with Perl scripts communicating to a MySQL database, and displaying HTML
pages through Apache server running on SuSE Linux. The
interface provides simple, advanced (Figure 1), and
sequence-based search forms. Parameters that can be used
in a search include strain information, different formats of
sequence identifiers (e.g. GenBank, UniGene, LocusLink

accessions or gene symbol), map positions (genetic and
physical), and a wide variety of SNP characteristics, such
as experimental evidence, a likelihood score for verification as deduced from extensive verification experiments
[1], and information regarding restriction sites that have
been affected, facilitating the design of RFLP based assays.
To this end CASCAD is tightly linked to primer design [2]
and local genome assembly [3] interfaces, enabling a fast,
reliable, and universal primer design for a chosen SNP
candidate even when there is no assembled genome
sequence available. To facilitate the retrieval of candidate
SNPs with higher verification rates, represented by more
reliable and common SNP candidates, we implemented
the possibility to restrict searches to entries characterized
by location at hypervariable CpG site, by minimal basecalling quality (Phred score), sequence match size, and/or
minimal number of supporting reads for either allele.
In addition to primary sequence data analysis, the effect of
all SNPs on protein coding capacity was evaluated and
non-synonymous SNPs were categorized in classes
reflecting the severity of the polymorphism using a BLOSUM-based score. The predicted missense SNPs were
analyzed by SIFT [4] and Polyphen [5] programs that utilize not only substitution information but also phylogenetic conservation and structural protein information to
predict a potential effect of the polymorphism on protein
function.
Query results are summarized on the SNP details page
(Figure 2), listing the SNP characteristics and including
active links to other databases and resources, such as
dbSNP, Ensembl, UniGene, and LocusLink. More detailed
information regarding raw data underlying the candidate
SNP (links to the original sequence files and a full nucleotide and protein alignment) can be obtained by clicking
on the observed nearly exact hits between nucleotide
sequences. Moreover, statistics on the data that support

Utility and discussion

For many applications, it is important to be able to distinguish between SNP candidates by their characteristics, as
they may be predictive for verification success rate or carry
biologically relevant information. Non-confirmed candidate polymorphisms may represent variants uncommon
for a given population, but also sequencing errors (all
types of sequences), RNA editing events and reverse transcriptase errors (EST reads). In order to minimize the contribution of false positives, one can exclude
polymorphisms based on a single read for either allele, as
is common for many in silico discovery pipelines [6].
Although this is a valid approach when selecting SNPs for
population or association genetics, one could inadvertently discard many rare variants that may be associated
with phenotypic variation, for example by affecting
protein structure or function. Information on such poly-

morphisms can be very useful when mapping disease or
QTL alleles.
We have developed our database to fulfill the needs of any
particular SNP application by providing control over
every parameter we used in the polymorphism discovery
step.

Applications of the CASCAD database include queries for
potentially deleterious SNPs in a specific genomic region
of interest, for example a QTL interval, design of SNPbased mapping panels using either RFLP or any other
technology, and identification of informative SNPs for
fine-mapping. Custom sequences can be provided to
search for known SNPs in any sequence of interest. In
addition, the CASCAD pipeline [1] can be used to build a
candidate SNP database for any model organism of interest for which sufficient sequencing data is available.

Conclusions
The main purpose of CASCAD database is to provide flexible access to candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms,
which were predicted using a computational approach
from publicly available sequence data of the rat and
zebrafish. The resulting database is crosslinked to most
common public databases and can be queried for SNPs
using accession numbers, sequence context, SNP characteristics, but also using parameters specific to the SNP discovery process, allowing stringent or relaxed conditions
suitable for different types of applications.
