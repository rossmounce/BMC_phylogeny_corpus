Evolution of plant RNA polymerase IV/V genes:
evidence of subneofunctionalization of
duplicated NRPD2/NRPE2-like paralogs
in Viola (Violaceae)
Thomas Marcussen1, Bengt Oxelman2, Anna Skog1, Kjetill S Jakobsen1*

Abstract
Background: DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV and V (Pol IV and V) are multi-subunit enzymes occurring in
plants. The origin of Pol V, specific to angiosperms, from Pol IV, which is present in all land plants, is linked to the
duplication of the gene encoding the largest subunit and the subsequent subneofunctionalization of the two
paralogs (NRPD1 and NRPE1). Additional duplication of the second-largest subunit, NRPD2/NRPE2, has happened
independently in at least some eudicot lineages, but its paralogs are often subject to concerted evolution and
gene death and little is known about their evolution nor their affinity with Pol IV and Pol V.
Results: We sequenced a ~1500 bp NRPD2/E2-like fragment from 18 Viola species, mostly paleopolyploids, and 6
non-Viola Violaceae species. Incongruence between the NRPD2/E2-like gene phylogeny and species phylogeny
indicates a first duplication of NRPD2 relatively basally in Violaceae, with subsequent sorting of paralogs in the
descendants, followed by a second duplication in the common ancestor of Viola and Allexis. In Viola, the mutation
pattern suggested (sub-) neofunctionalization of the two NRPD2/E2-like paralogs, NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b. The
dN/dS ratios indicated that a 54 bp region exerted strong positive selection for both paralogs immediately
following duplication. This 54 bp region encodes a domain that is involved in the binding of the Nrpd2 subunit
with other Pol IV/V subunits, and may be important for correct recognition of subunits specific to Pol IV and Pol V.
Across all Viola taxa 73 NRPD2/E2-like sequences were obtained, of which 23 (32%) were putative pseudogenes - all
occurring in polyploids. The NRPD2 duplication was conserved in all lineages except the diploid MELVIO clade, in
which NRPD2/E2-b was lost, and its allopolyploid derivates from hybridization with the CHAM clade, section Viola
and section Melanium, in which NRPD2/E2-a occurred in multiple copies while NRPD2/E2-b paralogs were either
absent or pseudogenized.
Conclusions: Following the relatively recent split of Pol IV and Pol V, our data indicate that these two multisubunit enzymes are still in the process of specialization and each acquiring fully subfunctionalized copies of their
subunit genes. Even after specialization, the NRPD2/E2-like paralogs are prone to pseudogenization and gene
conversion and NRPD2 and NRPE2 copy number is a highly dynamic process modulated by allopolyploidy and
gene death.

Background
Eukaryotes normally possess three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pols), Pol I-III, functionally specialized for synthesis of different types of RNA and thus
essential for viability. The Pol holoenzymes consist of
about 12 subunits, of which the two largest are tightly
bound and together constitute the catalytic seat of the
enzyme and are generally polymerase-type specific [1-4].
Angiosperms (flowering plants) are unique in possessing
two additional RNA polymerases that are not essential
for viability, Pol IV and Pol V (previously called Pol IVa
and IVb, or RNAP IVa and IVb). They are functionally
distinct, with Pol IV being required for 24 nt siRNA
production and Pol V for siRNA-mediated gene silencing of transposons and other repeated elements [5].
The subunit nomenclature of nuclear RNA polymerases has varied among research groups and organisms, and is often in conflict with names for unrelated
genes. In the following, we have therefore adopted the
4-letter gene names registered with The Arabidopsis
Information Resource. By convention the largest subunits of Pol I, II, III, IV and V are Nrpa1, Nrpb1, Nrpc1,
Nrpd1 and Nrpe1 respectively, and the genes encoding
these are NRPA1, NRPB1, NRPC1, NRPD1 and NRPE1,
respectively. Likewise, the genes encoding the secondlargest subunits of the five polymerases are designated
NRPA2, NRPB2, NRPC2, NRPD2 and NRPE2,
respectively.
The genes encoding the largest and second-largest
subunits of Pol IV, NRPD1 and NRPD2 respectively, originated by independent duplication of their Pol II
homologs, NRPB1 and NRPB2. The NRPB1/NRPD1
duplication is shared by both charophytes and embryophytes while the NRPB2/NRPD2 duplication is found
only in embryophytes [3]. While Pol IV is found in all
plants, Pol V appears to exist only in angiosperms (flowering plants) following duplication of, at least, the largest subunit gene (NRPD1/NRPE1) basally in this
lineage [3]. A recent study in the eudicot angiosperm
Arabidopsis thaliana confirms the close relationship of
Pol IV and Pol V with Pol II and shows that many of
their 12 subunits are shared among these three RNA
polymerases [1]. Nevertheless, 4 subunits of Pol IV and
6 subunits of Pol V are distinct from their Pol II paralogs, and Pol IV and Pol V differ in 4 subunits. Interestingly, 3 duplicated Pol IV/V genes (third, seventh and
nineth largest subunits) appear to be incompletely subfunctionalized with respect to Pol IV and Pol V. These
have a higher sequence similarity than the fully specialized gene pairs (e.g. NRPD1/NRPE1) and are presumably derived from more recent duplication events.
Following the duplication and specialization of the Pol
IV/V largest subunit genes (NRPD1/NRPE1) in

Page 2 of 15

angiosperms, duplication of the second-largest subunit
genes (NRPD2/E2) seems comparatively rare. NRPD2/E2
is apparently a singleton in monocots (Oryza, Zea) as
well as in several families of eudicots, e.g., Aceraceae
(Acer), Asteraceae (Carthamus), Lamiaceae (Galeopsis;
Brysting AK, unpublished), Myrtaceae (Myrtus), Solanaceae (Solanum) and Vitaceae (Vitis) [3,6-8]. A few eudicot lineages, however, possess duplicate NRPD2/E2
copies, e.g., Brassicaceae (Arabidopsis; but only one
paralog is expressed), Caprifoliaceae (Lonicera), Celastraceae (Maytenus), Euphorbiaceae (Manihot), Salicaceae
(Populus; but only one paralog is expressed), Caryophyllaceae (Silene and many other genera) and Violaceae
(Viola and Allexis; herein) [6,9-11]. This indicates that
duplicated NRPD2/E2 genes may in fact be a common
feature in eudicots. It is clear that the NRPD2/E2 duplications have occurred independently in these lineages,
and that they are also frequently lost, with sorting
among lineages as a common result [10].
The mechanisms behind gene duplication are well
known in eukaryotes and in plants [e.g., [12]]. While it
is clear that by far the most likely fate of a duplicate
gene is gene death [7,13,14], mechanisms accounting for
the duplications being retained in the genome have
been, until recently, less well understood [15]. Duplicate
genes may be preserved by a neutral mechanism in
which each paralog accumulates loss-of-function mutations (degeneration) that are complemented by the
other copy. Such mutations can happen either at the
regulatory level, causing the paralogs to diverge in pattern of expression (duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) [16]), or at the product level, causing
the paralogs to diverge in function (subfunctionalization
[17]). Furthermore, either mechanism can eliminate possible structural trade-offs imposed by different functions
performed by a multifunctional gene [18], by unlinking
these functions. These mechanisms can thus be
regarded as prerequisites for the ability of duplicate
genes to specialize and acquire new functions (subneofunctionalization [19]). Regulatory and functional
subfunctionalization are both well-documented in
gene families, in eukaryotes in general as well as in
plants [e.g., [15,20-23]].
The RNA polymerase subunit encoded by NRPD2/E2,
Nrpd2/Nrpe2, has a discrete double function in angiosperms, assembling either with Pol IV or with Pol V. A
duplication of this gene might have been preserved if
the two paralogs underwent subfunctionalization with
respect to Pol type, and would have required some
degree of co-evolution of co-assembling subunits.
In this study we have investigated the evolution of
NRPD2/E2-like genes within the Violaceae (Malpighiales), with particular reference to the genus Viola

(Figure 1). This gene occurs in a single copy in most
genera of the family but it is duplicated in others
(Allexis and Viola). In a similar system within tribe Sileneae of the Caryophyllaceae (Caryophyllales), concerted
evolution was found to be prominent among NRPD2/E2
paralogs [10]. In that study, however, only intron 6 was
investigated. In order to be able to examine possible
neofunctionalization among NRPD2/E2-like duplicants
in the Violaceae system, we have expanded this range to
include also the flanking exons of intron 6.
The Violaceae consist of some 900 species in 23 mostly
tropical genera [24]. Their relationships have recently
been examined in a phylogenetic study based on plastid
and nuclear ribosomal gene DNA sequences [25]. With
more than 500 species, Viola is the largest genus of the
Violaceae and the only one widely distributed in the
northern hemisphere [26]. Based on chromosome counts
[e.g., [27]] and isozyme expression data [28,29] it can be
estimated that roughly two thirds of Viola species belong
to paleopolyploid lineages having secondary base
numbers ranging from x = 10 to x = 27 or higher. âTrueâ
diploids are known only from two sections, Andinium
(x = 7) from South America [30] and Chamaemelanium
(x = 6) which is mainly northern amphi-Pacific [e.g.,
[31]]. Tentative genus phylogenies have been based on
rRNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequence data
in several studies [e.g., [26,32]] but this marker has proven of no use for recovering any of these polyploid relationships [e.g., [33]]. The genus phylogeny is currently
being re-examined using low-copy nuclear genes (Marcussen, Oxelman, Jakobsen, unpublished data).

In Arabidopsis five of the 12 genes associated with Pol
IV/V have been duplicated, apparently independently,
and have undergone subfunctionalization with respect to
Pol IV and V [cf. [1]]. For NRPD2/E2 in eudicots, available sequence information suggests numerous independent duplications and that these paralogs are often
subject to concerted evolution and gene death [10]. In
this study, we elucidate the origin of duplication of the
NRPD2/E2-like genes within the Violaceae and aspects
of its evolution and phylogeny within Viola. Polyploidy,
which is known to be a major evolutionary process in
Viola, could be thought to interact with a nascent gene
family such as NRPD2/E2. For instance, could redundancy resulting from polyploidy destabilize the incipient
differentiation of the two paralogs, NRPD2/E2-a and
NRPD2/E2-b, or could the occasional loss of primary
duplication be compensated for by secondary duplications resulting from polyploidy? The immediate consequence of gene duplication is redundancy, which will
generally lead to loss or pseudogenization of one paralog
unless the paralogs become subfunctionalized or neofunctionalized. Positive selection can be taken as evidence of neofunctionalization. It is therefore of
relevance to detect to what degree positive selection has
acted on duplicated NRPD2/E2-like paralogs within the
Violaceae, and if it has, at which sites and on which
phylogenetic branches.

Results
Assignment and naming of NRPD2/E2-like homologs
in Violaceae

NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b are arbitrary labels that
denote the two paralogs found in Viola and Allexis.
They do not reflect orthology to duplicated NRPD2/E2
loci outside of Violaceae, and do not imply that the
respective binding specificities of the paralogs to Pol IV
and Pol V are known. Appended digits to the sequence
name separate homoeologs of a paralog within a single
specimen (e.g., banksii_B2 refers to homoeolog 2 of
NRPD2/E2-b in V. banksii).
NRPD2/E2-like homologs in Violaceae

GenBank sequence data for the Malpighiales demonstrate duplicate copies of NRPD2/E2 in both Manihot
esculenta (CK652029, DV448133) and Populus trichocarpa (e.g., DT509274, CV227572) but not in Euphorbia
esula (DV145650). In Manihot both paralogs are potentially functional but in Populus one paralog (CV227572)
is characterized by frameshift and non-synonymous
mutations not reconcilable with NRPD2/E2 activity. The
two copies found in Manihot, Populus and Viola are not
orthologous to each other (not shown). We obtained
and analyzed sequence information from six non-Viola
Violaceae taxa (Table 1). These sequences were aligned

Taxa used in this study, with respective GenBank accessions for DNA sequences and voucher information. For each taxon systematic affinity (sections within Viola
for ingroup, and families within Malpighiales for outgroup), chromosome counts (2n, where available), and putative ploidal levels (x, inferred from the NRPD2/E2
data), are indicated. GenBank accession IDs are sorted by paralog (a and b), and by homoeolog (ascending numbers); gene copies excluded from phylogenetic
analysis, because they were considered too short for reliable analysis, are put in brackets. Note that NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b are arbitrary labels, and that
NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b in Euphorbiaceae, Salicaceae and Violaceae are not orthologous to each other. Herbarium acronyms for voucher specimen

partial sequence (exon 5 to intron 6); PCR 2 failed (see Figure 1)

to exon (mRNA) sequences from GenBank of Euphorbia, Manihot and Populus. Outside Viola, we found singleton NRPD2/E2 in all of Anchietea parvifolia,
Corynostylis arborea, Cubelium concolor (= Hybanthus
concolor), Hybanthus enneaspermus and Rinorea ilicifolia. Like Viola, Allexis batangae had duplicated NRPD2/
E2 genes, but only the NRPD2/E2-b paralog was putatively functional; its NRPD2/E2-a paralog was a pseudogene that contained three frameshift mutations and stop
codons in all three reading frames.
Our inferences of the plastid and nuclear ribosomal
phylogeny of Violaceae (Figure 2a) were congruent with
previous analyses of the family, regarding both general
topology [25] and the placement of Cubelium [34].
Rinorea was placed as sister to the rest of the Violaceae,
with a Cubelium + Orthion clade and an Allexis + Viola
clade as successive sisters to a Hybanthus (Anchietea +
Corynostylis) clade. All branches received high (95100%) bootstrap support.
The NRPD2/E2 phylogenies (Figure 2b) were incongruent with the species tree. Again, Rinorea was placed
as sister to the rest of the Violaceae with relatively high
bootstrap support (MP: 71%/ML: 93%). Within rest-Violaceae three well-supported clades were found, one consisting of NRPD2/E2-a copy of Allexis and Viola (92%/
95%), a second of the NRPD2/E2-b copy of Allexis and
Viola (92%/96%), and a third (67%/76%) consisting of
Hybanthus and Cubelium as sisters to a strongly supported (93%/100%) Anchietea + Corynostylis clade.
Whether it is Hybanthus (MP) or Cubelium (ML) that
is sister to the rest within the last clade depends on the
analysis, but neither topology receives strong bootstrap
support (52% and 61%, respectively). Weak support is
given for an NRPD2/E2-a + NRPD2/E2-b clade (Allexis
and Viola; 52%/68%). However, the inter-relationships
of these three main clades remain elusive and depend
on whether Cubelium and Hybanthus are included in
the analysis (not shown).
No evidence of recombination was detected in the
Violaceae alignment using GARD (see methods). Two
possible recombination breakpoints were detected, but

the topologies resulting from phylogenetic analyses of
the partitions were congruent.
The reconciled tree (Figure 2c), constructed in GeneTree by embedding the NRPD2/E2 tree (Figure 2b)
within the species tree (Figure 2a), explains the incongruence between these two trees by hypothesizing two
events of gene duplication and three losses. A first
duplication was postulated on the basal branch of all
Violaceae except Rinorea, meaning that one paralog
would have been lost in Viola and Allexis but retained
in Cubelium, Hybanthus, Anchietea and Corynostylis.
The second paralog may have been retained only in
Viola and Allexis, before duplicating a second time in
their common ancestor and diversify into their present
NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b paralogs.
NRPD2/E2-like homologs in Viola

There were considerable differences in the relative number of copies of NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b across
lineages of the genus Viola (Table 1), but seen as a
whole NRPD2/E2 always occurred in two or more
potentially functional copies. Only the two diploid sections Andinium and Chamaemelanium appeared to
have single and functional copies of each of NRPD2/E2a and NRPD2/E2-b. All gene copies appeared functional
in the neopolyploids of the latter section (V. nuttallii
and V. canadensis). Non-functional gene copies were
identified by the often numerous occurrence of premature stop codons and frameshift mutations within exons
(up to a single 862 bp deletion comprising all of exon 6
in B1_banksii); in a single case (NRPD2/E2-b in V. uliginosa) the sequence was assumed to be non-functional
because of a partial duplication within the highly conserved GEMERD amino acid motif of exon 7. Taxa of
section Erpetion (V. banksii) and section Chilenium (V.
maculata) had equal numbers of NRPD2/E2-a and
NRPD2/E2-b copies; 5 and 4 of each, respectively, but
differed in their respective numbers of putatively functional copies. All members of the sections Melanium
and Viola had unbalanced numbers of NRPD2/E2-a and
NRPD2/E2-b. Typically, taxa of section Viola had two

putatively functional copies of NRPD2/E2-a and one
non-functional copy of NRPD2/E2-b (except in V. hirta
and in V. spathulata). Members of section Melanium
had four to six copies of NRPD2/E2-a, of which one or
several could be non-functional, but no copies of
NRPD2/E2-b. Unbalanced numbers of NRPD2/E2-a and
NRPD2/E2-b copies were found also in V. brevistipulata
and V. nuttallii (section Chamaemelanium) but, in light
of their ploidy levels and expected copy number, this

likely reflects heterozygosity in one of the NRPD2/E2-a
loci (V. nuttallii) or the NRPD2/E2-b locus (V.
brevistipulata).
The MP and ML phylogenies of NRPD2/E2-a and
NRPD2/E2-b in Viola are all largely congruent (Figure
3) with an (as of yet) unpublished phylogeny for the
genus based on another low-copy nuclear gene (Marcussen T, Oxelman B, Blaxland K, Jakobsen KS, in prep.),

MELVIO clade, in the entire section Melanium and in
V. hirta of section Viola. Generally higher bootstrap
support was obtained for NRPD2/E2-b than for NRPD2/
E2-a, reflecting that the former has ca 200 bp longer
introns and therefore more phylogenetically informative
sites. Working our way up from the root of the two
consensus trees in Figure 3, V. congesta (section Andinium) is sister to the rest of the genus, sandwiched by
branches receiving strong bootstrap support in all analyses. Next comes a polytomy of three lineages, here

referred to as CHILERP, MELVIO (only NRPD2/E2-a)
and CHAM. The CHILERP clade, which received only
weak ML bootstrap support, but was recovered for both
NRPD2/E2-a (54%) and NRPD2/E2-b (52%), consisted of
various V. banksii (section Erpetion) and V. maculata
(section Chilenium) lineages, of which one internal
mixed species lineage received 100% bootstrap support.
The MELVIO clade, missing for NRPD2/E2-b, received
strong support for NRPD2/E2-a (MP: 96%/ML: 93%)
and consisted of a basal polytomy of taxa of section

Viola within which a strongly supported (100%) section
Melanium is nested. The large and strongly supported
CHAM clade included sequences from all represented
sections except Andinium and, in the case of NRPD2/
E2-b, Melanium. A basal dichotomy in the CHAM clade
lead to two strongly supported sub-clades: one subclade consisting of one V. maculata sister to two V.
banksii sequences, and a second sub-clade in which taxa
of sections Chamaemelanium and Viola formed a polytomy; in NRPD2/E2-a section Melanium was a monophyletic group (92%/99%) within this basal polytomy.
Within the polytomies of CHAM and MELVIO the species constellation of (V. mirabilis (V. uliginosa + V.
hirta), (V. epipsila + V. selkirkii + V. verecunda), and V.
dirimliensis sister to the rest of section Melanium were
common.

The pattern of change of d N /d S ratios along the

option for pairwise comparison of Rinorea with three
data sets: (1) 3 NRPD2/E2 sequences from Cubelium/
Corynostylis/Hybanthus, in which the gene is not duplicated; (2) 13 NRPD2/E2-a sequences from Allexis and
Viola; and (3) 10 NRPD2/E2-b sequences from Viola.
The dN/dS ratios are well below 1 throughout most of
the sequence for Cubelium/Corynostylis/Hybanthus,
thus indicating purifying selection. It is for the most

Figure 4 Sliding window plot of dN/dS ratios for NRPD2/E2 in
Violaceae. The plot was generated by comparing the Rinorea
sequence to singleton NRPD2/E2 in Cubelium, Hybanthus and
Corynostylis (black), to NRPD2/E2-a in Allexis and Viola (gray), and to
(3) NRPD2/E2-b in Viola (white). Window length was set to 54 bases
and step size to 9 bases. Sites interacting with the other Pol IV/V
subunits Nrpd1/Nrpe1 (d1/e1), Nrpd3/Nrpe3 (d3/e3) and Nrpd10/
Nrpe10 (d10/e10) are shown, based on findings for Pol II [2]. Sites
under neutral (dN/dS = 1) or positive selection (dN/dS > 1) are seen
in a restricted 54 bp region, from position 249 through 302, for
NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b while purifying selection (dN/dS < 1)
predominates in the rest of the locus. Corynostylis arborea and
B_Allexis batangae were excluded from the sliding window analysis
because of a lack of data from exon 7.

part also so for NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b, but for
both paralogs a 54 bp (18 amino acid) region with dN/
dS considerably higher than 1 is identified near the 3â
end of exon 6 (nucleotide positions 249 through 302),
indicating positive selection in both these paralogs.
Within the region of positive selection a compensatory
pattern conserving regionally the net charge of mutations was found (not shown): substitution of E/D (glutamic acid/aspartic acid) in position 300 is compensated
for by gain of E in position 252 in NRPD2/E2-b. Thus,
the positions of charged amino acids are subject to
selection.
The 54 bp region where positive selection was
detected (Figure 4) was further analyzed using the
CodeML software of the PAML package for estimating
dN/dS ratios of 60 specified branches in the predefined
phylogenetic tree. A 60-parameter model, assuming one
d N /d S ratio for each branch, was found to marginally
better fit the data (p = 0.0516) than a single-parameter
model, assuming a uniform d N /d S ratio across all
branches in the tree. Although many branches in the
tree had positive dN/dS ratios, especially those immediately after the duplication basal to Allexis and Viola,
only for the branch basal to B_congesta was the dN/dS
ratio significantly larger than 1 (p = 0.0526). A model
assuming a common d N /d S ratio for the three basalmost branches following the duplication, i.e. basal to
A_Allexis, A_congesta and B_congesta, received strong
support (p = 0.0101). Thus, both NRPD2/E2 paralogs
seem to have been subjected to positive selection (dN
>dS ) soon after the duplication, but apparently not at
exactly the same time (Figures 5 and 6). For NRPD2/E2a, positive selection is hypothesized (i) immediately after
the duplication of NRPD2/E2 and before the split of
Allexis and Viola, and (ii) within the rest of Viola after
Viola section Andinium split off, and finally (iii) also
within the CHAM clade. For NRPD2/E2-b positive
selection occurred somewhat later, and only in the
branch leading to Viola (i.e. not in Allexis).

Discussion
NRPD2/E2 phylogeny within Violaceae

The NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b phylogenies differ in
several respects from the already published organism
phylogenies for Viola [26,32,35], based solely on the
nuclear ITS region, and for Violaceae [25], based on 4
nuclear and chloroplast regions. Our results indicate
that, at the family level, this incongruence is due to
duplication of NRPD2/E2 and the uneven sorting of
paralogs among lineages (Figure 2). Within Viola, the
incongruence appears to result partly from the notorious
failure of ITS to capture allopolyploid relationships, a
common consequence of gene conversion among the
often thousands of copies of this gene within the plant

Figure 5 dN and dS estimated for NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b along individual branches in the Violaceae phylogeny. Values of dN
(above branches) and dS (below branches) along each branch were estimated by using the free-ratio model using the CodeML program in
PAML [49]. For the branches drawn with bold lines, dN/dSwas larger than 1 (p = 0.010) under a 2-rate model, which suggests that positive
selection acted on these lineages. Branches collapsing in a MP phylogenetic analysis of the 54 bp region are indicated with broken lines. NRPD2/

genome [33], and partly from the evolutionary unstable
copy number of NRPD2/E2 (Figure 3). A genus phylogeny based on low-copy nuclear genes is currently being
constructed and is largely congruent with the NRPD2/
E2-a phylogeny (Marcussen T, Oxelman B, Blaxland K,
Jakobsen KS, in prep.).
In comparison with an organism phylogeny of Violaceae, based on data from Tokuoka [25] with an extra
accession of Cubelium rbcL, our data suggest that
NRPD2/E2 was duplicated twice within the evolutionary
history of the family. The reconciled GeneTree phylogeny (Figure 2C) indicated a first duplication relatively
basally in the family, after the split of Rinorea, with subsequent complete sorting of paralogs in the descendant
genera. so that one paralog was retained in Cubelium,
Hybanthus, Anchietea and Corynostylis, and the second
paralog was retained in Allexis and Viola. This interpretation, however, entirely rests on the conflicting phylogenetic position of Cubelium in the species phylogeny,
which received strong bootstrap support (MP: 98%, ML:
100%), versus in the NRPD2/E2 phylogeny which was

less strongly supported (MP: 67%, ML: 76%). On the
other hand, we found no evidence that this incongruence resulted of recombination.
The second duplication event, in the common ancestor of the genera Allexis and Viola, is incontestable
because it is retained in most of the descendants. Lineage sorting of paralogs may, however, also explain the
phylogenetic pattern and link the two duplication
events. The first duplication may in fact have persisted
in the lineage leading to Allexis and Viola, but been
subject to an event of sequence replacement in the common ancestor of these two genera. Either scenario
would appear in the phylogeny as an independent duplication basal to Allexis and Viola.
Interestingly, for the Caryophyllaceae it has not been
possible to trace back the origin of the NRPD2/E2 duplication event either. Judging by paralog similarity, the
duplication in tribe Sileneae seems to be a relatively
recent one and may well have occurred within this tribe
[10]. In contrast, Cerastium, which belongs to another
subfamily [36], has NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b

paralogs, broken lines denote pseudogenes, and thick lines branches that have undergone positive selection (cf. Figure 5). Dots indicate events
of pseudogenization or gene death. Truncated gray branches indicate the three (presumably extinct) lineages that contributed genomes to the
four paleopolyploid Viola sections Chilenium, Erpetion, Melanium and Viola. Putative allopolyploidization events are indicated by diagonal NRPD2/
E2 lines connecting the organism lineages. For simplificity, the sections Melanium and Viola are shown as derived from the same
allopolyploidization event, and secondary gene duplications within section Melanium have been omitted.

paralogs that are substantially more divergent than in
the Sileneae and that may result from an older duplication (Brysting AK, Mathiesen C, Marcussen T, in prep.).
Thus, it may be that the small NRPD2/E2 gene family is
subject to massive concerted evolution between paralogs, as already indicated in Silene by gene conversion
(loss of NRPD2/E2-b and duplication of NRPD2/E2-a)
within one lineage. Due to these factors it may be hard
to pinpoint the duplication event on a phylogenetic tree.
Within the Violaceae, there are certain indications
from ongoing research that the original duplication of
NRPD2/E2 may be connected with whole genome duplications via allopolyploidy. Recent findings for the genus
Ionidium, which belongs to the same clade as Anchietea
and Corynostylis in the present study, based on karyology (Seo MN, Sanso AM, Xifreda CC, unpublished) and
a low-copy nuclear gene (unpublished data), suggest
that the currently accepted base chromosome number
(x = 8) for this genus, and for large parts of the family,
is in fact tetraploid. There is some evidence of paleaotetraploidy also in Viola as, apart from NRPD2/E2, also
several other low-copy genes have been found to be
duplicated, i.e. chalcone synthase [37], shikimate

dehydrogenase (unpublished data) and homeotic floral
genes (Ballard HE, personal communication).
Most Viola groups were found to have a more or less
balanced number of NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b
copies. Presumably due to redundancy following polyploidy, massive pseudogenization of this gene family has
happened in the paleopolyploid sections Chilenium and
Erpetion. However, the situation is very different in the
other two polyploid sections, Viola and Melanium. These
two sections have their allopolyploid origin in one or several wide hybridization events between two major diploid
clades, CHAM and MELVIO. The CHAM clade, today
represented by the diploid section Chamaemelanium,
has apparently functional copies of both NRPD2/E2-a
and NRPD2/E2-b, while the MELVIO clade, which is
now extinct as diploid, has secondarily lost its NRPD2/
E2-b paralog. Assuming subneofunctionalization of the
two paralogs (which is suggested by positive selection,
see below), this would mean that the remaining MELVIO
paralog, which is by phylogenetic origin an âAâ paralog,
must have regained the ancestral expression state performing both âAâ and âBâ functions. Thus, the sections
Viola and Melanium inherited one paralog of each

Marcussen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/45

NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b from the CHAM ancestor, and from the MELVIO an NRPD2/E2-a paralog with
both âAâ and âBâ function. This âincomplete redundancyâ
in the polyploids may have lead to further gene death
within the two sections. In species belonging to these
sections (V. spathulata excepted), the current CHAM
NRPD2/E2-b paralog is either a pseudogene (section
Viola except V. hirta) or has been completely lost (section Melanium and V. hirta), while having two NRPD2/
E2-a copies, one derived from CHAM and a second from
MELVIO. In V. spathulata all the MELVIO paralogs
have been pseudogenized and only the CHAM-derived
paralogs are expressed; this was, apparently, also followed
by a more recent polyploidization event.
Thus, both sections Viola and Melanium, although
tetraploid, possess putatively functional NRPD2/E2
copies only of NRPD2/E2-a, derived from the ancestral
MELVIO and CHAM genomes. As both these seem
functional, and have not suffered the same fate as the
NRPD2/E2-b paralog during the same period of time, it
may be that some degree of de novo subfunctionalization has evolved between these two NRPD2/E2-a paralogs. Further research is needed to shed light upon this
issue.
Positive selection is seen in regions associated with
subunit interaction

In cases with ongoing neofunctionalization following
gene duplication, one would expect positive selection to
be acting on parts of one or both paralogs, and dN to be
larger than dS [e.g., [38]]. Our findings for NRPD2/E2 fit
well with these assumptions: only purifying selection
was detected among taxa with singleton NRPD2/E2;
while soon after duplication of the gene in the common
ancestor of Allexis and Viola both NRPD2/E2 paralogs
seem to have been subjected to rapid sub- and neofunctionalization. This is detected as dN/dS ratios larger than
1 along these branches, indicating positive selection,
especially early in the divergence process (Figure 6).
This process appears to have happened at different
times in NRPD2/E2-a and in NRPD2/E2-b. Our branch
analysis suggests rapid specialization of NRPD2/E2-a in
the common ancestor of Allexis and Viola while for
NRPD2/E2-b, positive selection occurred at a later time
and only in Viola, not in Allexis. Compared to Viola,
higher redundancy in Allexis due to a still incomplete
complementation of the two paralogs, may have facilitated pseudogenization of NRPD2/E2-a in A. batangae.
It is likely that the 54 bp region is important for the
specialization and neofunctionalization of the two
NRPD2/E2 paralogs in Viola. Crystallography of yeast
Pol II has shown that this region of the second-largest
subunit (Nrpb2) is part of a âhybrid bindingâ domain
that is involved in subunit recognition and binding [2].

Page 11 of 15

The first half of this region corresponds to an ordered
loop interacting with the tenth-largest subunit (Nrpb10)
and its second half forms an a-helix that interacts with
the third-largest subunit (Nrpb3). Since structure and
function tend to be conserved over all eukaryot Pols [2]
and, especially, because of the close phylogenetic relationship between the Pol II and Pol IV/V subunit genes
[3], we can assume that this region of Nrpd2/Nrpe2
interacts with homologs of Nrpd3 and Nrpd10. Under
the assumption that the differentiation of NRPD2/E2-a
and NRPD2/E2-b reflect specialization with respect to
Pol IV and V, we suggest that this region is important
for correct recognition of subunits specific to Pol IV
and Pol V in Viola. This likely applies also to duplicated
NRPD2/E2 in other eudicot lineages, and in this respect
the between-paralog divergence of the very same region
also in Silene [10] is noteworthy.
In Arabidopsis thaliana the exact subunit compositions of Pol IV and Pol V are known [1]. In this species,
only a single copy of NRPD2/E2 is expressed (although
another very similar duplicate is pseudogenized) and its
protein product assembles with both Pol IV and Pol V
[1]. Of the two subunit genes with whose gene products
Nrpd2-a and Nrpd2-b interact, the NRPD10 homolog is
not duplicated in Arabidopsis and shared between Pols
II, IV and IV. NRPD3/E3, however, exists in two rather
similar paralogs (85% sequence similarity at the protein
level) that are incompletely subfunctionalized between
Pol II/V and Pol V and apparently have been under
positive selection (not shown). In the other genome
sequenced eudicots, Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera, neither of these genes are duplicated. If, however,
NRPD3/E3 is duplicated in Viola and Violaceae, in addition to the basal differentiation of NRPD1 and NRPE1,
this could give some indications about how NRPD2/E2
came to be duplicated in this angiosperm family.

Conclusions
Aspects of the build, function and origin of the two atypical plant RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V are a hot
topic in current research. This knowledge has in turn
opened for study the dynamics of the origin and specialization of the individual subunits and their co-evolution
within a phylogenetic framework.
Herein, we have presented the first documentation of
possible co-evolution among subunits of Pol IV/V, from
within the angiosperm family Violaceae. Following
duplication, NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b, encoding
Pol IV/V subunits, underwent rapid specialization (neofunctionalization) in a region that is important for subunit interaction and recognition. We conclude that
correct recognition of the type-specific subunits is
important for the correct function of each of Pol IV and
Pol V.

Our study on Violaceae and previous studies on Caryophyllaceae draw a picture of NRPD2/E2 as a young
gene family, still in the process of diverging and specializing and still subject to strong concerted evolution
among paralogs. The few species and genera that have
been studied show a variable number of Pol IV/V gene
copies. Since the divergence of Pol IV and Pol V seems
to have only barely preceded the radiation of the angiosperms, we can expect their young gene families to have
acquired different lineage-specific specializations within
angiosperms.

Methods
Material

The investigated 18 species of Viola (Table 1) were
selected so as to cover the taxomomic diversity (i.e. following Ballard et al. [26]), geographical diversity and
ploidal levels of the genus Viola. Represented in this
study were Viola section Andinium (South America; V.
congesta), section Chilenium (South America; V. maculata), section Erpetion (eastern Australia; V. banksii),
section Chamaemelanium (mainly East Asia and North
America; 4 species), section Melanium (mainly Mediterranean; 3 species) and section Viola (northern hemisphere; 7 species). Six outgroup taxa (Table 1) were
selected from within Violaceae, of which Allexis was
known to be phylogenetically close to Viola [25], and
non-Violaceae outgroups from within the Malpighiales,
Populus trichocarpa (Salicaceae), Manihot esculenta and
Euphorbia esula (Euphorbiaceae).
DNA isolation

DNA was extracted using a CTAB extraction protocol
[39]. In most cases stock DNA was diluted 20 times for
working solutions of which 1 Î¼l was used per 20-40 Î¼l
PCR reaction. For âdifficultâ DNA preparations, where
higher template amounts or cleaner template were
needed in the PCR reaction, the obtained stock DNA
solution was further cleaned using the DNeasy Blood &
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany), following the
manufacturerâs guidelines except that the first 2 steps

were omitted; the obtained working solution was not
diluted, and 5-10 Î¼l were used in 80-160 Î¼l PCR reactions divided into an appropriate number of tubes.
PCR and sequencing

Primer sequences and standard PCR conditions are presented in Table 2. The nomenclature of exons and
introns follows the terminology in Arabidopsis. The
NRPD2/E2 locus, ranging from exon 5 through most of
exon 7, was in most taxa amplified in two PCRs with
overlapping range, one PCR covering exon 5 through
intron 6 using the primers 5F2898 and Svex7R3420, and
a second covering exon 6 through exon 7 using the primers vex6F3263 and 7R3883 (Figure 1). This approach
was preferred to amplifying the entire locus in a single
PCR, because (1) it increases the chance of discovering
all paralogs (especially for pseudogenes where the primer
binding sites are no longer conserved), because (2) it
reduces the amount of PCR recombination which is
expected to increase with gene copy number, their similarity and length of the amplified fragment [cf. [40]].
Where one of the PCRs failed (notably for the outgroup
taxa for which DNA was extracted from herbarium material and of inferior quality), shorter stretches of DNA
were sought amplified in three separate PCRs, (1) using
the primer pairs 5F2898 (or 5F3062) and vex6R3371, (2)
vex6F3263 and Svex7R3420, and (3) vex7F3418 and
7R3883. The primers were designed based on DNA
sequences available on GenBank, and in some cases
based on already existing Viola sequence data.
PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1%
agarose gels, and multiple bands were cut out separately
and cleaned using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit (Omega
Bio Tek, Doraville, GA, USA) following the manufacturerâs
manual. Some cleaned products were sequenced directly,
but generally these were cloned using the TOPO TA
Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturerâs manual, with the exception that only
half of the volumes recommended for the reactions were
used. Between 3 and 20 positive colonies from each reaction were screened by direct PCR using primers TOPO_F

products were diluted 10 times and sequenced one way
using either T7 or M13R universal primer. Sequencing
was done with BigDye 3.1 sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on 3730 ABI DNA analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
All sequence chromatograms were controlled manually and sequence alignments established in BioEdit [41]
by manual adjustments. Indel characters were coded by
using the simple gap-coding method in SeqState [42]
and appended to the alignment. Four data alignment
matrices were generated; these are available as additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4. (1) The first (Violaceae) matrix
(see Additional file 1) consisted of intron and exon
sequences of Allexis batangae, Anchietea parvifolia, Corynostylis arborea, Cubelium concolor, Hybanthus enneaspermus, Rinorea ilicifolia, Viola biflora and V. congesta
aligned to an outgroup consisting of GenBank exononly sequences of non-Violaceae Populus trichocarpa,
Manihot esculenta and Euphorbia esula. (2) The second
(Viola) matrix (see Additional file 2) consisted of all
Viola sequences aligned to Allexis batangae sequences
(outgroup). (3) The third matrix (see Additional file 3)
was used to examine dN/dS ratios with a sliding window
approach using the DnaSP software, and consisted of
only exon sequences of all the non-Viola Violaceae
sequences along with all NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b
sequences of V. congesta, V. banksii, V. maculata, V.
biflora, V. brevistipulata, V. nuttallii and V. pubescens.
(4) The fourth matrix (see Additional file 4) was used to
estimate individual d N /d S ratios for phylogenetic
branches using the PAML software; this matrix consisted of a reduced data set of the 44 Violaceae taxa
having unidentical NRPD2/E2 sequences (i.e., duplicate
sequences were removed) within a 54 bp exon domain
in which positive selection was detected in the DnaSP
analysis. Rinorea was used as outgroup.
Phylogenetic reconstruction

The Violaceae and Viola matrices were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Owing to a large number of
sequences in the Viola matrix NRPD2/E2-a and NRPD2/
E2-b were analyzed separately, using maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML). MP analyses
of all three data sets were performed with TNT version
1.1 [43], using traditional search, tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping, 10 replicates (number of
added sequences), and 10 trees saved per replication.
Maximum Parsimony bootstrap analyses were carried
out with the same settings and with 1000 replicates. Maximum Likelihood analyses of all three data sets were performed with Treefinder version of March 2008 [44] and
run with different nucleotide substitution models for the

Page 13 of 15

three partitions of the sequence data: exons, introns and
coded indels. Nucleotide substitution models for the
exon and intron partitions were proposed by Treefinder,
while for coded indels a uniform rate model (Jukes-Cantor) was applied (in Treefinder this substitution model
had to be specified as âHKY [{1,1,1,1,1,1}, Optimum]:GI
[Optimum]:4â). The Violaceae matrix (1) was analyzed
using the 4-rate model J1+I+G (TA = TG; CA = CG) for
both exons and introns. The Viola matrix (2) was analyzed with the 3-rate model TN (TA = TG = CA = CG)
for exons and the 4-rate model J1+I+G (TA = TG; CA =
CG) for introns. Mamimum Likelihood bootstrap analyses were carried out with the same settings and with
100 replicates.
Detection of gene duplication in Violaceae

The obtained NRPD2/E2 phylogeny was incongruent
with the organism phylogeny of Violaceae, and so we
further analyzed the Violaceae matrix for possible gene
recombination and/or duplication events. The GeneTree
software [45] was used to construct a reconciled tree by
embedding the NRPD2/E2 tree within the Violaceae species tree. The Violaceae species tree was obtained from
re-analysis of Tokuokaâs [25] 4-gene data set of atpB,
matK, rbcL and 16S for a taxon subset corresponding to
the one used in this study. Cubelium concolor was not
included in Tokuokaâs phylogeny but a matK sequence
was available on GenBank (EF135550, as Hybanthus concolor). In order to firmly place Cubelium in the family
phylogeny and to compensate for weaker data for this
taxon, we also included in our analysis Orthion subsessile,
which has been considered close to Cubelium on morphological grounds [34]. Maximum Parsimony and ML
analyses were carried out as above, except for ML using a
6-rate substitution model GTR+G. To screen the Violaceae alignment for possible recombination we employed
the Genetic Algorithms for Recombination Detection
(GARD) [46,47], on the exons only, using general parameter settings (GTR model of nucleotide substitution
and beta-gamma rate variation with 2 rate classes). We
then separated the alignments at the detected breakpoints within the region, estimated MP phylogenetic
trees (1000 bootstrap replicates) for the individual sections, and checked for incongruent topologies.
Detection of positive selection

Estimating dN (the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site) and dS (the number of
synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) between
coding sequences is useful for detecting whether there
has been purifying selection (dN/dS < 1), neutral evolution (dN/dS = 1) or positive selection (dN/dS > 1).
For data matrix 3 (exons), the polymorphism and
divergence module of the DnaSP package [48], using the

Marcussen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/45

sliding window option, were used to make a graphic
representation of the pattern of change of dN/dS ratios
along the sequence. We generated three sequence categories that were each compared to Rinorea (which is sister to the other examined Violaceae taxa). The first
category consisted of all taxa (except Rinorea) having
singleton NRPD2/E2, i.e. Corynostylis, Cubelium and
Hybanthus. The second category consisted of 13
NRPD2/E2-a exon sequences from Allexis and Viola (V.
congesta, 2 of V. banksii, 3 of V. maculata, V. biflora, V.
brevistipulata, 3 of V. nuttallii and V. pubescens). The
third category consisted of 10 NRPD2/E2-b exon
sequences from the same Viola taxa as for the second
category. As DnaSP does not support gaps nor stop
codons, pseudogenes (except for Allexis NRPD2/E2-a,
because of its phylogenetic position) and incomplete
sequences (e.g., Anchietea NRPD2/E2 and Allexis
NRPD2/E2-b) had to be omitted. Within Viola, taxa of
the sections Melanium and Viola were omitted because
they do not possess functional copies of both NRPD2/
E2-a and NRPD2/E2-b.
For the 54 bp region for which positive selection was
detected with DnaSP, we used the CodeML software of
the PAML package [49] to further determine at which
branches in the phylogeny positive selection had
occurred. A simplified organism phylogeny was used as
input tree file due to the short length (54 bp) of the
sequence analyzed (Figure 5).
