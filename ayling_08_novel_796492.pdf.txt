Abstract
Background: Visualising the evolutionary history of a set of sequences is a challenge for molecular
phylogenetics. One approach is to use undirected graphs, such as median networks, to visualise
phylogenies where reticulate relationships such as recombination or homoplasy are displayed as
cycles. Median networks contain binary representations of sequences as nodes, with edges
connecting those sequences differing at one character; hypothetical ancestral nodes are invoked to
generate a connected network which contains all most parsimonious trees. Quasi-median
networks are a generalisation of median networks which are not restricted to binary data, although
phylogenetic information contained within the multistate positions can be lost during the
preprocessing of data. Where the history of a set of samples contain frequent homoplasies or
recombination events quasi-median networks will have a complex topology. Graph reduction or
pruning methods have been used to reduce network complexity but some of these methods are
inapplicable to datasets in which recombination has occurred and others are procedurally complex
and/or result in disconnected networks.
Results: We address the problems inherent in construction and reduction of quasi-median
networks. We describe a novel method of generating quasi-median networks that uses all
characters, both binary and multistate, without imposing an arbitrary ordering of the multistate
partitions. We also describe a pruning mechanism which maintains at least one shortest path
between observed sequences, displaying the underlying relations between all pairs of sequences
while maintaining a connected graph.
Conclusion: Application of this approach to 5S rDNA sequence data from sea beet produced a
pruned network within which genetic isolation between populations by distance was evident,
demonstrating the value of this approach for exploration of evolutionary relationships.

Background
Phylogenies reconstructed from DNA data are usually
depicted as hierarchical, bifurcating trees, but such trees
are inappropriate when intraspecific phylogenies are studied because recombination between taxa, the persistence
of ancestral alleles and the presence of multiple descend-

ents from single ancestors give rise to a reticulated and
multifurcating pattern of relationships [1]. Networks
rather than hierarchical trees are therefore more suitable
for studying intraspecific relationships [2]. Two main
types of network have been used: true phylogenetic networks which aim to reconstruct the phylogenetic history

of a set of sequences, and within which nodes represent
ancestral sequences and edges represent evolutionary
events; and character-display networks which display all
conflict within the dataset, nodes not necessarily representing ancestral sequences and some edges not corresponding to true events [3]. To construct a true
phylogenetic network the dataset must be relatively small
and reticulations must be rare, and often a number of networks must be evaluated to identify the optimal one.
Character-display methods are therefore more popular,
especially when combined with pruning methods that
reduce the number of nodes and edges, giving a topology
that approximates with a phylogenetic network.
Various character-display methods have been used to
study intraspecific phylogenies, including reticulated networks [4], statistical parsimony [5], split decomposition
[6], median-joining networks [7] and Neighbor-Net [8],
but median networks [9] are the most effective at displaying conflicts in the evolutionary histories of sequences
while preserving the relative distances between sequences
within the network. A median network or Buneman graph
[10] is a network containing nodes representing binary
strings and edges connecting those nodes whose strings
differ by a single character. The network identifies possible ancestral sequences, depicts reticulations indicating
recombination or homoplasy, and contains all the most
parsimonious trees connecting the sequences from the
initial alignment [9]. When median networks are constructed from DNA sequence alignments [9,11], the
sequences are converted into n binary vectors of length k,
n being the number of unique sequences in the alignment
and k the number of unique binary positions. Constant
positions are discarded and positions displaying more
than two characters are either converted into sets of binary
characters [9] or removed from the analysis [11], identical
columns being pooled to generate a set of unique positions. The network can be thought of as being embedded
in a k-dimensional hypercube with nodes representing
sequences located at the hypercube's vertices. Two
sequences are joined if they differ by one character. To
achieve a connected graph, medians are generated that
represent missing intermediates between observed
sequences. The hypothetical median sequences may correspond to extinct ancestral sequences or existing sequences
not sampled in the dataset; their nodes are called latent
vertices [11]. One mechanism to generate the median network takes triplets of binary sequences, the majority character state at each position being chosen to generate the
sequence which connects the three most parsimoniously.
This procedure is repeated for all triplets of sequences,
including newly generated medians, until no new median
sequences are made; the resulting network is called the
median closure.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/115

A quasi-median network is the generalisation of a median
network where characters can have more than two states.
DNA sequences have five possible character states at any
given position – A, T, G, C or indel (insertion/deletion). A
DNA sequence alignment where only two bases are
observed at each position (binary) can be represented as a
string of binary characters; for these sequences the quasimedian network would coincide with the median network and could be embedded within the vertices of a
hypercube. For alignments with more than two bases at
any given position (multistate), the network can contain
complete graphs Kn, where n represents the number of
character states observed at a given position. Therefore
quasi-median networks containing multistate characters
cannot be embedded in the vertices of a hypercube. Various approaches have been used to generate median networks for alignments containing multistate characters.
These include discarding multistate characters [11], which
is unsatisfactory because phylogenetic information contained within the multistate positions is lost, and a generalisation of median networks called the relation graph
[12], which allows incorporation of multistate characters
but which does not always give the quasi-median network
and is not necessarily connected [13]. A third possibility is
to convert the multistate characters into sets of binary
characters by generating one character to represent the
transversion (conversion between purine and pyrimidine)
and one or two additional characters to represent transitions (conversion from a purine to a purine or pyrimidine
to pyrimidine) [9]. The limitation with this approach is
that the choice of character ordering is arbitrary: for example, a multistate position comprising A, C and T could be
represented as a transversion between A and T with a transition from T to C, or a transversion between A to C and a
transition from C to T. In this way the conversion of A to
T can require one event or two depending on which ordering of events is chosen. The difficulties with these
approaches might not be significant when a small number
of closely related sequences is studied, but multistate characters become more common when larger numbers of
sequences are aligned and/or more diverse sequences are
compared.
An additional problem with median networks is the complexity of the topology that is obtained if there is extensive
incompatibility between characters. Two characters are
said to be incompatible if all combinations of the binary
character states exist within the alignment; for example, if
the states are '0' and '1' then any observations of '00', '01',
'10' and '11' will result in a reticulation within the network. If no pairs of characters are incompatible the
median network will be a tree, increasing numbers of
incompatible states will introduce increasing numbers of
reticulations. If all character pairs are incompatible then
the median network constructed from sequences of length

n will contain 2n nodes and will be an n-dimensional
hypercube. In the case of quasi-median networks, multistate characters also introduce reticulations. Pairs of characters are said to be strongly compatible where for a given
pair of characters, there exists a pair of character states
such that no sequence is observed which does not match
one of these states. Where pairs of characters are not
strongly compatible the quasi-median network will contain all possible combinations of character states for these
columns [14]. Hence the quasi-median closure for small
sets of sequences with many character pairs which are not
strongly compatible can contain large numbers of latent
vertices and be too dense to visualize effectively.
Simplification of network topology can be achieved by
graph reduction, in which certain characters are converted
into sets of characters to reduce the number of incompatible states within the alignment, based upon how many
sequences contain that character state (frequency) and
how often a character is observed (weight) [9]. The reduction is based on coalescent theory and as such is not suitable for datasets in which recombination has occurred:
whilst conversion of incompatible characters into sets of
characters is acceptable when incompatibility has arisen
because of homoplasy, recombination produces reticulations which should be retained if the network is to give a
true indication of evolutionary relationships between
sequences.
A second reduction method has been devised in which
pruning of latent vertices is based on the properties of
tuples of characters [11]. For an unobserved median to be
retained, for any k-tuple of positions in its sequence there
must be either a non-median sequence which matches all
k positions or no non-median sequence which fails to
match all of the k positions. When k = 2 this criterion
merely defines a binary median sequence, in order for a
sequence to be a median every pair of positions within it
must have been observed in a real sequence. When k =
3..n, median sequences which contain certain k-tuple differences are removed from the network [11]. For quasimedian networks the inclusion of multistate characters
results in vertices within the quasi-median closure which
may fail to satisfy the necessary criteria when k = 2. It is
suggested [12] that the relation graph represents the graph
produced by this pruning mechanism [11] extended for
use with quasi-median networks. These papers, however,
do not outline an approach which could readily be
employed to generate relation graphs for a set of
sequences.
Both pruned median networks and the relation graph can
have disconnected components where disconnectedness
implies evolutionary distance [11]. A disadvantage of disconnected components is the absence of information

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/115

indicating how they were once related as it is not possible
to identify from which region of the full network nodes
were deleted to produce the subgraphs. For small datasets,
the unpruned network can be displayed for comparison,
but for larger networks computational limitations may
prevent visualisation of the unpruned graph. The resulting
loss of information can make it impossible to identify
relationships between more distantly related sequences.
This paper addresses the problems inherent in construction and reduction of quasi-median networks. We
describe a novel method of generating quasi-median networks that uses all characters, both binary and multistate,
without imposing an arbitrary ordering of the multistate
partitions. We also describe a pruning mechanism which
maintains at least one shortest path (geodesic) between
observed sequences, displaying the underlying relations
between all pairs of sequences while maintaining a connected graph.

Results and discussion
Quasi-median network construction using the virtual
median
Here we present a novel approach to generate quasimedian networks for a set of aligned DNA sequences. This
method incorporates multistate characters by inferring
virtual medians to connect them. The median closure of
the sequences with virtual medians is determined, after
which the virtual medians are converted to multistate
characters generating the quasi-median closure (see Figure
1 for an overview). The process is outlined in detail below.

Given a multiple sequence alignment a reference
sequence is chosen; the choice of sequence is arbitrary and
does not alter the final network. Constant nucleotide
positions within the alignment are discarded [9]. Positions containing two nucleotides are recorded in a binary
format, those nucleotides which match the reference position becoming '0', others becoming '1'. For multistate
positions letters are used, the reference sequence and
matching bases being converted to 'A', the first alternative
base to 'B' and so on. The choice of symbols to represent
each character state is arbitrary, numbers have been used
for binary characters and letters for multistate characters
to make them more easily distinguishable for the user.
After the initial encoding, identical characters are collapsed giving 'semi-processed' sequences.
Each character represents a partition of the data into sets,
for instance those with '0' at that position and those with
'1'. To generate the median closure for a set of semi-processed sequences each partition of the data must be unique
[9]. Multistate characters frequently contain partitions
observed in other multistate or binary characters, so the
median closure cannot be constructed from the semi-

processed sequences. To overcome this problem the
sequences are further modified to produce binary
sequences. Each multistate character is replaced with
between three and five binary columns. A median network constructed for a multistate character treated in this
way will be composed of nodes representing the initial
nucleotides each connected to a virtual median (Figure 2).
After the second round of processing, identical characters
are collapsed once again, recording which characters are
collapsed together. These binary sequences form the final
processed sequence set. If there are no multistate characters within the initial sequence alignment the semi-processed and processed sequences are the same.

The median closure is constructed from the processed
sequences as described in [9]. Each sequence generated in
the median closure is then converted to the semi-processed format. To do this, each tuple of positions encoding
a multistate character is examined and replaced with the
corresponding character state. For tuples which encode a
virtual median, a set of new median sequences corresponding to each combination of possible character states
is created. The set of semi-processed sequences constitutes
the nodes of the quasi-median closure, with edges connecting those nodes whose sequences differ by one character. An advantage of quasi-median networks is that the
same set of sequences will always produce the same net-

work, additionally the entire process can be automated
with no parameters to be chosen by the user, ensuring
consistent results and ease of use.
Network reduction by the minimum geodesic set cover
approximation
A pruned quasi-median network should accurately represent the relationships between all real sequences. One way
of achieving this is to retain at least one geodesic between
all pairs of observed sequences. The parsimony principle
states that the simplest description of the relationship
between two sequences represents a good approximation
of the real evolutionary history. A geodesic is the most
parsimonious means of explaining the relationship
between two sequences as its length is equal to the edit
distance, that is the number of character edits required to
convert one semi-processed sequence into the other.
Extending the parsimony principle to the entire network,
an ideal method would preserve at least one geodesic
between all pairs of observed sequences, such that a minimal number of latent vertices are retained in the final network.

The identification of the minimal set of latent vertices
required to maintain a geodesic between all pairs of
observed sequences appears to be similar to the set-covering problem [15], which is believed to be NP-hard. Whilst
heuristics exist to find approximate solutions to the setcover problem, they would require generation of the
median closure which is often not feasible for networks

that would typically require pruning. We therefore
devised our own heuristic approach, the minimum geodesic set cover approximation (MGSCA), which uses a
scoring system based on observed frequencies of character
states to select a geodesic to be maintained between
sequences. This can be performed for pairs of sequences
and as such does not require generation of the median
closure.
In MGSCA a score is assigned to each character state at
every position of the semi-processed sequence alignment
equal to the fraction of sequences which contain that
character state at the position in question. Every node in
the quasi-median closure represents a sequence. Each
node is assigned a score equal to the product of the scores
of the character states in its sequence. The set of geodesics
is identified between each pair of observed sequences in
turn and each geodesic within a set is given a score equal
to the product of its nodes' scores. The highest scoring
geodesic from each set is selected as it represents the pathway which is most likely given the observed set of
sequences, and in the case of a tie all highest scoring geodesics are retained; any latent vertex not found on one of
these geodesics is deleted from the network. The union of
these highest-scoring geodesics gives the pruned quasimedian network.
Here we present a computationally efficient approach to
generate quasi-median networks. To initiate the procedure, a pair of processed observed sequences is chosen. As

the generation of a quasi-median closure is independent
of the order in which the characters are processed, subgraphs can be generated for each sequence pair containing
only those edits required to convert one sequence to the
other. An alignment is constructed from the processed
sequences containing all observed sequences but only
those positions where the two sequences differ – because
we are interested in identifying the shortest paths between
the pair, edits to any character which they have in common can be ignored. From this truncated alignment a
median closure is constructed and sequences within the
closure are restored to full length by addition of the characters shared by the two observed sequences. From this

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/115

sequence set a quasi-median closure can be constructed as
shown in Figure 1, although expansion of the virtual
medians is slightly modified as only those multistate character states seen in the sequence pair need be included in
the set of median sequences produced (Figure 3). This is
because edits involving additional multistate character
states will not occur on the shortest paths between the
sequence pair. The geodesics can then be identified and
assigned scores based on the frequencies of the character
states at each position. The highest scoring geodesic is
selected, and once the observed nodes and edges have
been recorded the subgraph can be deleted, greatly reducing the size of the network required to be kept in memory.

This process is repeated for all pairs of observed
sequences, and the pruned quasi-median network is the
union of all the selected geodesics. In median networks all
nodes are connected if they differ by one character, but for
visualisation purposes it is preferable to show only these
high priority geodesics.
If more than one geodesic within a set has the highest
score then all equally high scoring geodesics are retained.
This means that sometimes there are small sets of alternative nodes, which can be identified by observing which
geodesics pass through each node. If nodes always occur
at the same position on equivalent geodesics they can be
collapsed into a single node to reduce network complexity, these are depicted as boxes labelled with the number
of nodes that have been collapsed (Figure 4).
MGSCA generates pruned quasi-median networks which
are connected and which preserve the minimum path
lengths between observed semi-processed sequences.
Only those geodesics which are most likely given the initial set of observed sequences are retained, which greatly
reduces the number of latent vertices in the network. The
collapse of nodes which are always alternatives to one
another allows the further reduction of the network without loss of useful information. Figure 5 shows the network
constructed from four sequences displaying all possible
partitions of the set of sequences as detailed in [14] from
an ape mtDNA data set [16]. The initial sequences are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/115

given in Table 1A and Table 1B lists the eight virtual
median sequences invoked in the generation of this network. The quasi-median closure would contain 868 nodes
but the pruned quasi-median network contains a more
easily viewable fifty nodes. The network shows a similar
structure to the median-joining network for the same data
[13], but in our network all edges are equivalent to one
edit, thus maintaining a consistent representation of the
pairwise distances between the sequences. When applied
to the sea beet 5S rDNA data (see Methods), the procedure
reduced an original quasi-median closure containing
6808 vertices to a pruned network with only 648 vertices
(Figure 6). The pruned network is biologically informative
as it shows a clear separation between the harbour and
cliff top populations, in agreement with previous studies
of these populations using isozymes, restriction fragment
length polymorphisms and short tandem repeats, which
have suggested that the harbour and cliff top plants display genetic isolation by distance [17-19]. Additional
interpretations that can be drawn from this network
regarding the evolutionary history of these populations
will be described elsewhere (Ayling et al., in preparation).

Conclusion
Previous studies have shown median and quasi-median
networks to be useful tools for analysis of intraspecific
phylogenies. We devised a new and fast method to gener-

ate quasi-median networks, using a virtual median and
enabling all characters, both binary and multistate, to be
used without imposing an arbitrary ordering of the multistate partitions and hence without losing phylogenetic

information. We also developed a simple and intuitive
pruning mechanism that reduces the number of latent
vertices within a network while maintaining a connected
network and preserving the geodesic lengths between all
pairs of observed sequences. A great advantage of this
approach is that each sequence pair can be treated separately so that the full quasi-median closure does not need
to be constructed, an important consideration with relatively divergent sequences that can give rise to quasimedian networks that are too large to build. The method
always produces a single network because it displays multiple equally good geodesics, therefore no arbitrary decisions have to be made during network construction, and
no external parameters have to be applied. Application of
this approach to 5S rDNA sequence data from sea beet
produced a pruned network within which genetic isolation between populations by distance was evident, demonstrating the value of this approach for exploration of
evolutionary relationships.

Methods
The DNA sequence dataset used in this study comprised
110 sequences from the spacer regions of the 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci of sea beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima). In plants, the 5S rDNA genes are arranged in
tandem arrays, each gene separated by an untranscribed
spacer that in sea beet is 227–230 bp in length. These
spacers are among the most variable regions of plant
genomes and hence are attractive markers for studying
intrapopulation relationships, but their analysis by conventional tree-building is impossible because of frequent
character conflict caused by recombination between spacers, and because both ancestral and derived spacer
sequences are present in a single array [20]. The sequences
were obtained by Dr D. Turner (University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology, UK) and are in
groups of ten sequences, each group from a different population of sea beet from the southeast coast of Dorset, UK,

six populations from a harbour area and four from cliff
tops. Previous studies [17-19] of isozymes, restriction
fragment length polymorphisms and short tandem repeat
markers have suggested that these populations display
genetic isolation by distance.

Authors' contributions
SCA carried out the development and implementation
work described in this paper including writing the necessary code. TAB provided direction and aided the biological interpretation of the networks that were obtained. SCA
and TAB contributed jointly to preparation of the manuscript.

Acknowledgements
SCA was supported by a PhD studentship from the Medical Research
Council. We thank Dr D. Turner for provision of the sea beet data.
