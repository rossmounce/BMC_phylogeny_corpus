Abstract
Background: S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase (AdoMetS) catalyzes the formation of SAdenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the major methyl group donor in cells. AdoMet-mediated
methylation of DNA is known to have regulatory effects on DNA transcription and chromosome
structure. Transcription of environmental-responsive genes was demonstrated to be mediated via
DNA methylation in dinoflagellates.
Results: A full-length cDNA encoding AdoMetS was cloned from the dinoflagellate
Crypthecodinium cohnii. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the CcAdoMetS gene, is associated with
the clade of higher plant orthrologues, and not to the clade of the animal orthrologues. Surprisingly,
three extra stretches of residues (8 to 19 amino acids) were found on CcAdoMetS, when
compared to other members of this usually conserved protein family. Modeled on the bacterial
AdeMetS, two of the extra loops are located close to the methionine binding site. Despite this, the
CcAdoMetS was able to rescue the corresponding mutant of budding yeast. Southern analysis,
coupled with methylation-sensitive and insensitive enzyme digestion of C. cohnii genomic DNA,
demonstrated that the AdoMetS gene is itself methylated. The increase in digestibility of
methylation-sensitive enzymes on AdoMet synthetase gene observed following the addition of
DNA methylation inhibitors L-ethionine and 5-azacytidine suggests the presence of cytosine
methylation sites within CcAdoMetS gene. During the cell cycle, both the transcript and protein
levels of CcAdoMetS peaked at the G1 phase. L-ethionine was able to delay the cell cycle at the
entry of S phase. A cell cycle delay at the exit of G2/M phase was induced by 5-azacytidine.
Conclusion: The present study demonstrates a major role of AdoMet-mediated DNA
methylation in the regulation of cell proliferation and that the CcAdoMetS gene is itself methylated.

Background
S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (AdoMetS) catalyzes
the formation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) from
methionine and ATP [1]. AdoMet participates in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions. It is a main methyl

group donor and plays a central role in transmethylation
reactions and the transsulphuration pathway [2]. DNA
methylation is known to have regulatory effects on DNA
transcription and chromosome structure. AdoMet is also
involved in the biosynthetic pathway of many secondary

metabolites [3,4]. It can undergo decarboxylation to generate a propylamine donor, used in the biosynthesis of
polyamines [5]. Polyamines are required for cellular proliferation and may play a role in the rapid growth of
bloom-forming dinoflagellates [6]. In plants, it is a precursor in the biosynthesis of ethylene [7] and serves as a
methyl group donor in transmethylation of alkaloids [8].
Cell and life cycle variation in AdoMet synthetase expression has been observed in yeast and apicomplexa [9,10].
In mammals the MAT2A gene (an allele of AdoMet synthetase) is influenced by the cell cycle and is induced during liver regeneration, malignant liver transformation and
T-lymphocyte activation [11]. In plants differential
expression patterns for AdoMet synthetase are found in
different tissues [12,13]. It is believed that expression of
AdoMet synthetase can facilitate the methylation reaction
and polyamine synthesis which are presumably essential
during growth and morphogenesis periods.

AdoMet synthetase gene of the dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii (CcAdoMetS). Cell cycle variations of CcAdoMetS gene and protein expression are described. The
state of DNA methylation status on CcAdoMetS gene and
its possible feedback regulation of AdoMet synthetase
expression were also investigated.

Results
Sequence analysis and amino acid sequence alignment
Two partial clones showing high homology to AdoMetS
were isolated from a Crypthecodinium cohnii cDNA library
during random screening. Based on these fragments, a full
CcAdoMetS cDNA has been obtained (Fig. 1A). Sequence
analysis reveals that CcAdoMetS cDNA consists of 1395
base pairs with a putative open reading frame coding for
a protein of 465 amino acids with 50.5 kDa molecular
weight and 6.25 theoretical pI. The putative 3' UTR of
CcAdoMetS contains 367 base pairs and a poly (A) tail
(Fig. 1B). Sequence alignment of the CcAdoMetS derived
from cDNA and genomic DNA has revealed that there are
no introns present within the gene. The sequence of
AdoMet synthetase is highly conserved among all the species tested. CcAdoMetS is approximately 50% identical to
other AdoMet synthetases at the amino acid level (Fig.
2A).

The structures of E. coli and rat AdoMetS were resolved by
X-ray crystallography [14,15]. Both results demonstrated
an overall fold of the enzyme monomer consisting of
three domains related by pseudo 3-fold symmetry: the Nterminal domain (aa 1–12 and 129–233; E. coli AdoMetS
numbering, same below unless specified), the central
domain (aa 13–101 and 234–268) and the C-terminal
domain (aa 108–128 and 269–383). Two substrate binding sites are also found. A site for ATP binding between the
central and C-terminal domains [16], and a methionine
binding site between the central and N-terminal domain
[15]. Both models posses a mobile non-visible loop (aa
103–107) linking the central domain to the C-terminal
domain in close proximity to the ATP binding site. The
loop is proposed to act as a gate to the site [15,17]. Analysis of rat AdoMetS has also revealed a small flexible loop
(aa 251–260) near the opening of the methionine binding site. This small loop is well conserved and is directly
involved in proper positioning of the methionine substrate upon binding [15].

CcAdoMetS shares three conserved amino acid sequences
with other species. These include the conserved methionine binding motif GHPDK, the active signature hexapeptide GAGDQG, for ATP binding sites, and the conserved
nonapeptide GGGAFSGKD which forms a P-loop for the
phosphate-binding region (Fig. 2A). CcAdoMetS also contains the residues 120PDIAGGVHVGKEDLDI135 (Fig. 2A)
suggested to be a flexible loop which moves to gate access
to the active site controlling the catalytic efficiency of
AdoMetS [28]. Although AdoMetS are highly conserved
among other species, the CcAdoMetS also possess three
extra stretches of residues (8, 19 and 10 amino acids) at
the N-terminal and middle portion of the protein (Fig. 2).

Dinoflagellates are a distinct group with a large genome
size and permanently condensed chromosomes, but interestingly lack histones and nucleosomes [18-20] Many
studies have focused on the mechanism of genes transcription and DNA organization within such a huge
genome in the dinoflagellate nucleus [20-24]. DNA methylation has been shown to have a role in the regulation of
gene expression and chromosome structure [25,26].
Restriction endonuclease digestion analysis on ribosomal
DNA of dinoflagellates shows that the genome is extensively methylated [27]. It is possible that DNA methylation may be involved in regulation of gene transcription
and chromosome structure. However no full sequence of
AdoMet synthetase has been reported in dinoflagellates.
In this report, we have identified and characterized an

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of AdoMetS shows two main distinct groupings, Eubacteria and Eukaryota (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, among the group of Eukaryota, protists and
plants form a clade that is distinct from the clade of animal and fungi. CcAdoMetS is found to be immediately
related to apicomplexa, a group of the subkingdom Alveolata. Further phylogenetic analyses would be required to
address this plant-affiliation of both the dinoflagellate
and apicomplexa AdoMetS (Fig. 3). It should be noted
that both the dinoflagellate and apicomplexa contain
many examples of lateral gene transfer [29]. A recent study
reported on the presence of the Rubisco gene, encoding an
enzyme normally involved in photosynthesis, in C. cohnii.

ports the notion that this heterotrophic dinoflagellate was
derived from a plastid bearing photosynthetic dinoflagellates, and not from early branches of heterotrophic dinoflagellates. This ancestral photosynthetic dinoflagellate
was also hypothesized to be at the root of the present day
photosynthetic dinoflagellates. The presence of extra
sequence in the CcAdoMetS gene may thus represent an
ancestral condition before the branching of the photosynthetic species [30].
Northern blot and Western blot analysis
Northern analysis using a probe to CcAdoMetS identified
to a single band with size an approximate size of 2000 bp

(Fig. 4). The size of transcript was slightly larger than the
cDNA however the increase in size may be explained if the
5' and 3' UTR are considered. Western analysis using a
polyclonal antibody raised against CcAdoMetS protein
recognized a single band with expected size of about 50
kDa (Fig. 4). These results are indicative that the obtained
CcAdoMetS is a full-length clone.

0.1 M AdoMet. The results showed that the strains CC683-

script was found to be increased in early G1, while a
decrease in transcript was observed in S phase (Fig. 6,
Table 1). Western analysis indicated that the AdoMet synthetase protein also increases in late G1 phase and
decreases in S phase, and again increases in the next G1
phase (Fig. 7). Both CcAdoMetS mRNA transcript and
protein are expressed higher in the G1 phase. In the cell
cycle of C. cohnii, daughter cells (after cytokinesis) spend
a considerable length of time inside their mother cells
[31,32]. Samples taken at T= 8 and T = 10 would have a
significant portion of early G1 cells. This would account
for the apparently higher level of transcripts and protein
of CcAdoMet in these samples.

the growth of the SAM defective yeast mutant W744-1A.

DNA methylation of CcAdoMetS
Methylcytosine has been reported within the C. cohnii
genome, mainly at CpG residues [27]. To investigate
whether the AdoMet synthetase gene is methylated
genomic DNA digested with the restriction enzymes HpaII
or MspI was hybridized to a labeled AdoMetS probe. HpaII
recognizes and cleaves CCGG sequences but digestion is
prevented when the internal cytosine residues within the
CCGG sequences is methylated. However MspI, the
isoschizomer of Hpa II, cleaves the same DNA sequence
whether the sequence is methylated or not (Fig. 8A). Inhibition of digestion of the gDNA by the methylation sensitive enzyme Hpa11 was observed. Only large DNA
fragments were observed after DNA treating with HpaII. In
contrast, small DNA fragments smaller than 2 kb were
produced after digesting with MspI indicated by arrow on
Fig. 8B. This is indicative of DNA methylation sites on
CCGG residues within the CcAdoMetS gene. To eliminate
the possibility that inhibition of digestion was due to the
presence of interference during digestion, bacteriophage λ
DNA was treated with HpaII and MspI restriction enzymes.
All of the enzymes could cleave λ DNA to completion.
(Fig. 8C).

Two DNA methylation inhibitors, 5-azacytidine (5Aza)
and L-ethionine (L-Eth) were used to confirm that the
inhibition of digestion by methylation sensitive enzyme
was caused by the presence of cytosine methylation on
AdoMetS gene. 5Aza is a base analogue which can be
incorporated into DNA during replication. It inhibits
DNA methyltransferase and prevents the transfer of a
methyl group onto the newly synthesized DNA strand
[33]. Southern analysis indicated that the genomic DNA
of 5Aza-treated (200 uM) cells was more susceptible to
DNA methylation- sensitive enzymes. Fragments smaller
than 2 kbp were observed in both HpaII and MspI digested
DNA after treating the cells with 200 µM 5Aza when compared with the control (Fig. 8D). L-Eth is an analog of
methionine and produces S-adenosylethionine which
competes with AdoMet in transmethylation reactions
[34,35]. After L-Eth treatment, Southern analysis shows

the digestibility of gDNA by HpaII increased. Hybridized
fragments smaller than 2 kbp were observed in HpaII
digested gDNA. However, the increased digestibility of
AdoMetS gene when using the L-Eth methylation inhibitor was less than found for the 5Aza inhibitor. It can be
assumed then that the overall reduction of methylcytosine
within CCGG sequence in AdoMetS gene by L-Eth was less
then 5Aza (Fig 8D). The use of the two DNA methylation
inhibitors has confirmed that inhibition of HpaII diges-

tion was the result of DNA methylation on CCGG residue
(Table 2).
Effects of DNA methylation inhibitors on cell cycle
progression
DNA methylation sites present on CcAdoMetS, may be
involved in the control of cell cycle progression. To investigate this the two methylation inhibitors, 5Aza (200 µM)
and L-Eth (1.2 mM) were added to synchronized C. cohnii

cells and cells harvested every two hours for ten hours.
Flow cytometric analysis revealed a delay at the exit of G2/
M phase when the cells were treated with DNA methylation inhibitor 5Aza. However, a cell cycle delay was
observed at the entry of S-phase when treating the cells
with L-Eth (Fig. 9).
CcAdoMetS protein expression after treatment with DNA
methylation inhibitors
The effect of 5Aza and L-Eth treatment on AdoMet synthetase protein expression was also analyzed but in asynchronized cells. Two methylation inhibitors, 5-Aza (200
µM) and L-Eth (1.2 mM) were added to asynchronized C.
cohnii cells at day 0 independently and untreated C. cohnii
cells were used as a control. Cells were collected at day 0,
1 and 2 and were subjected to western analysis. Interestingly, in the untreated control, higher expression of CcAdoMetS protein was observed at day 1 compared to the
control at day 0. After treatment with 5Aza or L-Eth, a significant reduction of CcAdoMetS protein expressions was
observed. CcAdoMetS protein level in both treated and
untreated cells returned to similar level at day 2 (Fig. 10).

Discussion
AdoMetS has a central role in metabolism of all cells.
AdoMetS is highly conserved and appears to maintain the
same overall structure in different species including CcAdoMetS. Sequence alignment of various AdoMetS reveals
that CcAdoMetS processes three extra loops, which insert
between the positions equivalent to E. coli AdoMetS H80S81 (loop A; 8 aa), D195-Q196 (loop B; 19 aa) and S219A220 (loop C; 10 aa) (Fig. 2). According to the established
crystal structure of E. coli AdoMetS, the first two loops (A
and B) would be located at the opening of methionine
binding site, and the loop C would be close to the cleft
between the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2B). Based
on their sizes and positions, we postulate that loops A and
B may pose some effects on substrate binding or product

release of the methionine binding site and possibly the
reaction kinetics. Loop C however is not positioned close
to the substrate binding sites nor regions for dimerization
or tetramerization [15]. On the opposite side of the N-/Cterminal domain cleft of the rat AdoMetS, there is a protein kinase C site (T342 at the N-temrinal end of helix 10;
rat AdoMetS numbering) which is responsible for regulation of enzyme activity and dimerization through PKC
phosphorylation [36]. This threonine residue is conserved
in human, Plasmodium and the dinoflagellate AdoMetSs
(T378), but not in yeast and plant enzymes (Fig. 2A). It is
possible that this N-/C- terminal cleft, including the additional loop C in CcAdoMetS, is a potential regulatory
region subjected to post-translational regulation systems.
The present study of CcAdoMetS revealed that both the
transcript and protein level were relatively higher at G1. In
the dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula, microarray analysis
suggested that a putative AdoMet synthetase transcript
level was 2.2 times higher in the early light phase when
compared to that of early dark phase [37]. Conversely, Sadenosylhomocyteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase is downregulated during G1 phase in dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense [38]. AdoHcy hydrolase is the enzyme that catalyzes
the conversion of AdoHcy which is formed after AdoMet
transferring methyl group to its acceptor, into methionine
and re-enter the methyl-cycle. Accumulation of AdoHcy is
showed to be a target for inhibition of cellular methyltransferases and can influence methylation processes [39].
It is apparent that enzymes involved in cellular methylation are regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner. The
G1 expression of AdoMetS is also consistent with late G1
synthesis of saxitoxin [3,4] in dinoflagellate Alexandrium
fundyense [40]. For toxic bloom-forming dinoflagellates,
AdoMet synthetase may take part in rapid growth and
toxin formation. The level of cell-cycle variation of the
CcAdoMetS transcripts, from 0.8 to 1.2 (Fig. 6, 7), is much
lower than the previously reported (2.2 fold in Pyrocystis
lunula). Since C. cohnii is a heterotrophic species, this may
reflect that the previous reported variation in photosynthetic species could be contributed by light-dark cycle.
Plastid-encoded psbA proteins were reported to be lightregulated in dinoflagellates[41].
Upon inhibition of DNA methylation, an increase in
digestibility of C. cohnii genomic DNA by methylation
sensitive enzyme was observed. These suggest that methylcytosine was present on CCGG residues of CcAdoMetS
gene. In the present study, treating synchronized C. cohnii
cells with 5Aza and L-Eth, delayed cell cycling and
changed AdoMetS protein expression. 5Aza treatment
caused a delay at the exit of G2/M in C. cohnii cell cycle.
One of the possible reasons is that 5Aza induced DNA
hypomethylation which may prevent chromosome compaction. Moreover demethylated DNA may affect DNA-

proteins and thereby alters chromosome compaction
[42]. All these may influence the mitosis process and
delay entry into G2/M. 5Aza can also be an inducer of
chromosome damage [43], which may activate cell cycle
checkpoint and delay the progress of cell cycle [44].
Another DNA methylation inhibitor L-Eth caused a delay
at the G1/S entry. Such a delay was also observed in
human lymphocytes cell when treated with L-Eth [45]. It
is believed that DNA methylation is critical to the initiation of DNA synthesis. Some studies reported that the origin of the replication site of E. coli DNA is heavily
methylated [46] and DNA methylation could affect the
initiation of DNA replication at some origins in mammalian cells [47]. Dinoflagellates genomes are well known to
have both prokaryotic and eukaryotic properties [48,49],
it is possible that DNA methylation may have a role in the
regulation of DNA replication.

protein interactions, e.g. alternation of DNA interaction
of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family

For the fast growing log phase C. cohnii cells, higher CcAdoMetS protein expression was observed at day 1. DNA
methylation inhibitors 5Aza and L-Eth can cause DNA
hypomethylation [33-35] which is normally associated to
the activation of gene expression [25,26], and thus higher
expression of CcAdoMetS protein may be expected after
treatments with these inhibitors. However lower expression of CcAdoMetS protein was observed after treatment
with either 5Aza or L-Eth. Our data implicates that methylation on CcAdoMetS gene may not be the only way to
control its expression (Fig. 10). Further work is required to
delineate the exact mechanisms of regulation. A knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of gene expression in
dinoflagellates may, in turn, lead the way to dissect molecular mechanism of cell-cycle gating by the circadian
rhythm[50].

Conclusion
CcAdoMet is the first full-length AdoMet synthetase that
has been reported from dinoflagellates. This dinoflagellate AdoMetS has three extra loops when compared to
other members of this highly conserved gene family.
Despite this, the CcAdoMetS was able to complement the
corresponding mutant in budding yeast (Fig. 4). The
present study demonstrates that the CcAdoMetS gene is
itself methylated. Inhibitor studies and cell-cycle expression pattern suggest that CcAdoMet-mediated DNA methylation has a role in the regulation of cell proliferation.

Methods

described previously [52]. Synchronized cells were harvested every two hours and subjected to flow cytometric
analysis. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol overnight and
resuspended in PBS, pH7.4 and 5 µg/ml RNaseA. After
incubation at 37°C for 1 hour, samples were stained with
0.025 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and subjected to
measurements using Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorter
(FACS) on a Becton-Dickinson Vantage flow-cytometer.
Data was analyzed using the software WinMDI (version

Easy Vector (Promega) and sequenced (ABI Prism BigDye
Terminator v3.0 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
CCAdoMet and an additional twenty-five AdoMet synthetase sequences of different species including bacteria,
protists, fungi, plant and animal were retrieved from the
NCBI sequence database and aligned using the CLUSTALW program in BIOEDIT [53]. Phylogenetic sequence
analysis was carried out using PHYLIP, version 3.5 [54].
Using the PRODIST program with Jones-Taylor Thornton
matrix, one thousand bootstrap replicates were generated
and distance calculated by the neighbor-joining method.
Phylogenetic trees were drawn using MEGA2 [55].
Expression of AdoMetS and polyclonal antibody
production
CcAdoMetS from 39 bp-1395 bp was amplified by PCR
with sense primer 5'-TATGGATCCACGT TCCTGTTCTCCTC-3' (including a BamHI restriction site) and antisense
primer
5'-ATAAAGCTTTTAGTCCACCCACTTGGTG-3'
(including a HindIII restriction site). The amplified fragment was cloned into expression vector pQE30 (QIAexpress System, QIAGEN) and transformed into Escherichia
coli SG10039. Cells were grown at 37°C until OD600 0.6.
and then induced using 1 mM isopropyl into-β-galactoside (IPTG) for 4 hours. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in denaturing buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM
Tris Cl and 8 M Urea). The 6xHis tagged-recombinant protein was then purified by Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid (NiNTA) affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions using QIAexpressionist™ protein expression and
purification system (Qiagen Corporation). After dialysis,
the recombinant protein with 6xHis tag was used to produce a polyclonal antibody against the recombinant CcAdoMetS, according to established protocols [56]. The
antibodies were purified by affinity purification as
method previously described [57,58] and cleaned antibodies were then used for western blotting.
Functional complementation in yeast
For the yeast complementation, a full CcAdoMetS gene
(1.3 kb) with BamHI attached at both ends was amplified
by sense primer (5'-GTATGGATCCATGGCCGAGCCTG3') and antisense primer (5'-GATTGGATCCTTAGTCCACCCACTTGGTG-3') from C. cohnii cDNA. The amplified
fragments were then cloned into pMA91 vector, which
contains LEU2 gene that was required for yeast growth in
leucine-deficient growth media.

Since Saccharomyces cerevisiae AdoMetS-deficient doublemutant strain W744-1A has a LEU2 gene, for selection of
clones harboring the vector only was used as a negative
control for yeast complementation. pYHKU1 was constructed by replacing the LEU2 gene marker of the pMA91

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/87

vector with another marker URA3 from pYES2 yeast vector. The yeast W744-1A was separately transformed with
pYKU1 and pMA91-SAM by a modified lithium acetate
method [59]. Cell (W744-1A) transformed with pYHKU1
was used as a negative control. Other yeast strains used
were CC683-1D (sam1, SAM2), CC683-4b (SAM1, sam2)
and W744-1A (sam1, sam2). All the yeast stains were
tested on minimal medium plates supplemented with or
without 0.1 M AdoMet. Minimal medium plates containing 2% glucose, 0.78% yeast nitrogen base with the presence or absence of amino acids.
Restriction endonucleases and Southern blot analysis
Mid-log phase C. cohnii cells were collected and genomic
DNA isolated using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) buffer [60]. Purified DNA (15 µg) was restricted
by 5U/µg restriction enzymes (MspI and HpaII). Digested
genomic DNA was fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels and
blotted onto nylon membrane (GeneScreen) Membranes
were then hybridised with a 700 bp CcAdoMetS probe,
corresponding to nucleotides 222 bp-922 bp, labelled
using the ECL Direct Nucleic Acid Labelling System
(Amersham Biosciences).
RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was isolated from C. cohnii cells by LiCl/Urea
precipitation. For northern blot analysis, extracted total
RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde agarose
gel (1% agarose, 18% formaldehyde, 1× MOPS) and
transferred to nylon membrane (GeneScreen) The RNA
was hybridized with a 589 bp CcAdoMetS probe, corresponding to 900 bp-1489 bp, labelled with [α-32P] dCTP
using the Rediprime II random primer labeling system
(Amersham Biosciences).
Real time RT-PCR
First-strand cDNA was synthesized in a 20 µl reaction volume containing 1 µg of total RNA, 200 units of SuperScriptTM II Reverse Transcriptase, 10 mM dNTPs, 40 units
of RNase inhibitor and 2 pmole gene specific primer
(AdoMet synthetase gene, 5'-GACACCATCGCCAGAGTCCATCA-3' or Actin gene, 5'-GACACCATCGCC AGAGTCCATCA-3'). Total RNA was denatured for 5 mins at 65°C
and mRNA was reverse transcribed at 42°C for 50 mins
before heat-inactivation for 15 mins at 70°C. Real time
RT-PCR was performed with a LightCycler (Roche) using
LightCycler FastStart DNA Master PLUS SYBR Green I
(Roche). Each PCR was performed in a 20 µl reaction with
4 µl 5× master mix, 10 µM forward primer (CcAdoMetS
gene, 5'-CCTCACGTCTGTCAAGGTCT-3'or reference
gene, actin 5'-CTTCAACGTCCCCGCCATGTAC-3'), 10
µM reverse primer (AdoMet synthetase gene, 5'-GACACCATCGCCAGAGTCCATCA-3' or reference gene actin, 5'GACACCATCGCCAGAGTCCATCA-3'). The thermal
cycling conditions used: 95°C for 10 mins; followed by

45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10s, optimal annealing temperature (CcAdoMetS gene, 57°C; Actin gene,
65°C) for 10s and extension at 72°C for 10s. Measurements were carried out in duplicates. Data was then normalized using actin as the reference gene and relative
expression calculated using the method described by the
PFAFFL group [61,62]. The data are the means ± standard
deviations (n = 2). Asterisk (*) indicates significant difference between the control (T = 0) and sample values with
P < 0.05 by Unpaired t test with GraphPad software[63].
Protein extraction and western blotting
C. cohnii cells were resuspended in denaturing buffer (100
mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris Cl and 8 M Urea) and boiled
for 5 mins. Proteinase inhibitors (20 µg/ml leupeptin, 20
µg/ml aproptinin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A and 1 mM PMSF)
were then added and the cells sonicated. Lysate was collected and protein concentration quanitified by the BioRad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE analysis
was carried out in 12% polyacrylamide gels containing
acrylamide and bis in a ratio of 30:0.8. Western transfer to
polyvinylidene fluoride (BioTraceTM) membrane was carried out by semi dry transfer technique [55]. The transferred membrane was blocked with 3% no fat milk
powder in TBS-T and was then probed by the primary polyclonal anti-CcAdoMet synthetase overnight at 4°C. The
blots were developed using horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies and a ECL western blotting
detection system (Amersham). α-tubulin was used as a
loading control.
Inhibition of DNA methylation using chemical inhibitors
The DNA methylation inhibitors 5-azacytidine (5Aza) at
200 µM and L-ethionine (L-Eth) at 1.2 mM were dissolved
in MLH media before addition to synchronized or asynchronised cells [33-35]. To confirm the inhibition of
digestion by methylation sensitive enzyme is due to presence of methylcytosine in CCGG residues the inhibitors
were added to asynchronized C. cohnii cells for two days
before cells were harvested and gDNA digestion completed as previously. To study the effects of inhibition
DNA methylation on cell cycle progression inhibitors
were added to synchronized C. cohnii cells at T = 0 and
cells harvested every two hours for twelve hours before
analysis by FACs. To study effects of inhibition of DNA on
AdoMetS protein expression the inhibitors were added to
asynchronised log phase cells. Cells were harvested at day
0, 1 and 2, protein extracted and subjected to Western
analysis using the polyclonal antibody to CcAdoMetS.
Values were normalized to the α-tubulin internal control
and expressed relative to the value of control on day 0. The
data are the means ± standard deviations (n = 2). Asterisk
(*) indicates significant difference between the control on
day 0 and sample values with P < 0.05 by Unpaired t test
with GraphPad software [63].
