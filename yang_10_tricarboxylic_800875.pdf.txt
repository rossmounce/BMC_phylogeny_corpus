oneidensis is independent of Fur and RyhB
control

Abstract
Background: It is well established in E. coli and Vibrio cholerae that strains harboring mutations in the ferric uptake
regulator gene (fur) are unable to utilize tricarboxylic acid (TCA) compounds, due to the down-regulation of key
TCA cycle enzymes, such as AcnA and SdhABCD. This down-regulation is mediated by a Fur-regulated small
regulatory RNA named RyhB. It is unclear in the g-proteobacterium S. oneidensis whether TCA is also regulated by
Fur and RyhB.
Results: In the present study, we showed that a fur deletion mutant of S. oneidensis could utilize TCA compounds.
Consistently, expression of the TCA cycle genes acnA and sdhA was not down-regulated in the mutant. To explore
this observation further, we identified a ryhB gene in Shewanella species and experimentally demonstrated the
gene expression. Further experiments suggested that RyhB was up-regulated in fur mutant, but that AcnA and
SdhA were not controlled by RyhB.
Conclusions: These cumulative results delineate an important difference of the Fur-RyhB regulatory cycle between
S. oneidensis and other g-proteobacteria. This work represents a step forward for understanding the unique
regulation in S. oneidensis.

Background
Fur (Ferric uptake regulator) is a global transcription
factor that regulates a diversity of biological processes
such as iron homeostasis, TCA cycle metabolism, acid
resistance, oxidative stress response, chemotaxis and
pathogenesis (reviewed in [1]). The active, DNA-binding
form of this regulator is as a Fur homodimer complexed
with ferrous iron. The DNA target recognized by Fe 2
+
-Fur is a 19-bp inverted repeat sequence called a “Fur
box” (GATAATGATAATCATTATC) [2]. The binding
of Fe2+-Fur to a “Fur box” in the promoter regions of
target genes effectively prevents the recruitment of the
RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and thus represses transcription [3,4].
Although Fur typically acts as a transcriptional repressor, it also appears to positively regulate certain genes in
E. coli [5,6]. This paradox was understood only recently,

with the discovery of a 90-nt small RNA named RyhB
[7]. RyhB negatively regulates a number of target genes
by base pairing with their mRNAs and recruiting RNaseE, thus causing degradation of the mRNAs [7,8]. The
ryhB gene itself is repressed by Fur via a “Fur box” in its
promoter; thus, Fur repression of the negative regulator
RyhB manifests as indirect positive regulation by Fur.
The targets of RyhB include genes encoding iron-storage
protein (Bfr) and enzymes of the TCA cycle (SdhABCD
and AcnA) and oxidative stress response (SodB) [7].
The RyhB-mediated regulation of TCA cycle genes
explains the inability of E. coli fur mutants to grow on
succinate or fumarate [9].
S. oneidensis is a g-proteobacterium with a striking
capacity to reduce organic compounds and heavy
metals, making it a potential bioremediator of environmental contaminants. The S. oneidensis Fur exhibits
clear homology to its E. coli ortholog (73% amino acid
identity). Physiological, transcriptomics and proteomics
studies have shown that S. oneidensis Fur regulates
genes involved in iron homeostasis and acid resistance

[10-13]. Consistently, many of these target genes have a
recognizable “Fur box” in their promoters. In the present study, we further characterize a fur null mutant of
S. oneidensis with regard to its ability to utilize succinate
and fumarate. Unexpectedly, HPLC analysis showed that
the fur mutant was able to metabolize succinate and
fumarate, and the growth of the mutant was enhanced
in the presence of succinate and fumarate, indicating
that the mutant can utilize these compounds. In addition, the expression of the TCA cycle genes acnA and
sdhA was not down-regulated in the mutant. These differences between S. oneidensis and E. coli were traced to
the small RNA gene ryhB, which we identified in several
Shewanella species. Although S. oneidensis RyhB was
up-regulated in the fur mutant, the TCA cycle genes did
not appear to be regulated by RyhB. These results
delineate differences in the gene regulation and physiological consequences of RyhB between S. oneidensis and
E. coli.

Results
TCA cycle activity and regulation in the fur mutant

We showed recently that S. oneidensis harboring a fur
deletion in the genome was sensitive to acidic conditions and de-repressed genes encoding iron acquisition
systems [11]. Similar observations have been made in E.
coli [14,15], suggesting that the functional roles of Fur
are conserved in these species. Since Fur acts as a pleiotropic transcription factor involved in multiple biological
processes, we proceeded to examine its role in regulating TCA cycle enzymes. The involvement of Fur in this
biological process has been established in E. coli and V.
cholerae by observations that fur mutants are unable to
grow in defined media with succinate or fumarate as a
carbon source [9,16], and that genes encoding certain
TCA cycle enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase
(SdhABCD) and aconitase (AcnA), are significantly
down-regulated in a fur mutant [7].
Our initial tests showed that neither succinate nor
fumarate, when provided as the sole carbon source in
M1 defined media, could support detectable growth of
S. oneidensis type strain MR-1 (data not shown), making
it unlikely to analyze the growth of MR-1 and fur null
mutant. However, the complete set of TCA genes is present in S. oneidensis genome, and recent studies have
shown that the bacterium is capable of metabolizing
succinate and fumarate [17,18]. To compare the metabolizing rates of the carbonates between MR-1 and the
fur mutant, both strains were grown to mid-log phase
with 10 mM lactate as the carbon source. Then equal
numbers of cells (5 × 10 9 ) were washed and resuspended in fresh M1 medium with 10 mM lactate, succinate or fumarate as the sole carbon source.
Unexpectedly, HPLC analyses showed that both

and (C) lactate. 5 × 109 cells were incubated with 10 mM

measurements. Y-axis: the concentration of carbon source.

succinate and fumarate were reduced to similar levels in
MR-1 and the fur mutant after 36 and 54 hours’ incubation at 30°C (Figure 1A and Figure 1B), suggesting that
fur mutant is not deficient in metabolizing succinate
and fumarate. In contrast, more lactate was consumed
in MR-1 than in the fur mutant (Figure 1C). This could
be explained by the observation that there were more
MR-1 cells after 36 hours’ incubation (data not shown),

as the MR-1 grew faster than the fur mutant when lactate was provided as carbon source (Figure 2). To determine whether the ability of the fur mutant in
metabolizing succinate and fumarate affects cell growth,
we grew MR-1 and the fur mutant in M1 medium with
10 mM lactate plus succinate or fumarate. Addition of
succinate or fumarate significantly enhanced the growth
of the fur mutant (Figure 2). Together, succinate and

Data were averaged over triplicate samples.

fumarate can indeed be similarly metabolized by MR-1
and the fur mutant of S. oneidensis and be used to support the cell growth when combined with lactate,
though they are unable to support the cell growth as the
sole carbon source.
A recent microarray study comparing the gene expression profile of the fur mutant to that of MR-1 showed
that neither the sdhCDAB operon nor the acnA gene
was down-regulated [11], which was unlike the observations in E. coli. To confirm this, quantitative RT-PCR
was carried out on acnA and sdhA, a gene of the
SdhCDAB operon. The housekeeping gene RecA was
used as the internal standard to normalize the gene
expression levels. The levels of SdhA and AcnA relative
to RecA in MR-1 are 0.14 and 0.06, respectively. Both
genes exhibited little change in expression in the fur
mutant relative to MR-1 (Table 1). Therefore, the utilization of succinate or fumarate by the fur mutant (Figure 1) may be attributable to the persistent expression
of TCA cycle genes. Notably, An putative iron uptake
gene SO3032, which was expressed at the level of 0.04
relative to RecA in MR-1, was up-regulated in the S.
oneidensis fur mutant. In contrast, the Fe-dependent
superoxide dismutase encoded by sodB, a gene known
to be regulated by Fur in E. coli [7], was repressed in
the fur mutant (Table 1). This result agrees with previous observations that the transcript and protein
expression levels of SodB are repressed in the fur
mutant of S. oneidensis [10].
Identification of the small RNA RyhB in Shewanella
species

In E. coli, TCA cycle genes are controlled by a Fur-regulated small RNA named RyhB [7,19]. However, its
homolog in S. oneidensis was not identified by homology
to the E. coli RyhB using BLAST [20] or by searches
using the ryhB sequence alignment and covariance
model from Rfam [21]. Therefore, we examined the S.
oneidensis MR-1 genome sequence in the region syntenic with the V. cholerae genomic region encoding RyhB.
Specifically, the V. cholerae ryhB gene is located downstream of the gene VC0106 [22,23], which is

orthologous (by reciprocal best-hit criteria) to the S.
oneidensis gene SO4716. We identified a region downstream of SO4716 that exhibited homology with a
region that was well-conserved among enterobacterial
ryhB sequences (Figure 3A). This “core” region encompasses the sequence believed to base-pair with E. coli
sodB mRNA and the binding site for the RNA chaperone Hfq [24].
RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of
the putative RyhB transcript from this region of the S.
oneidensis genome. Total RNA was prepared from wild
type S. oneidensis MR-1 strain grown to mid-logarithmic
phase and then used for reverse transcription-PCR. A
PCR product with expected size of 119 bp was generated using ryhB-specific primers (Figure 4). This PCR
product was absent when a PCR reaction was performed
on RNA samples without reverse transcription, indicating that the RNA sample was free of genomic DNA
contamination. This conclusion was also supported by
the absence of PCR products when RT-PCR experiments were used to amplify six other intergenic regions
(two examples are shown in Figure 4).
To determine the transcriptional boundaries of the
RyhB transcript, 5’- and 3’-RACE experiments were carried out on the same sample used for RT-PCR, identifying a 168-nt transcript between nucleotides 49202344920401 of the S. oneidensis genome [25]. This transcript is longer than the 90-nt E. coli RyhB [19], but
shorter than the 215-nt V. cholerae RyhB [22,23]. A
“Fur box”, matching 15 of the 19-base consensus
sequence (GATAATGATAATCATTATC) [26], was
predicted at positions -26 to -44 upstream of this gene
(Figure 3B). Together, these results support the existence of a ryhB gene in S. oneidensis.
ryhB genes were subsequently identified in eleven
other sequenced Shewanella species by BLASTN using
the S. oneidensis ryhB sequence as the query. Extensive
sequence conservation was observed (Figure 3B), including the “core” region identified as homologous with the
enterobacterial ryhB. Two copies of ryhB were detected
in the draft genome sequence of S. amazonensis, in a
tandem arrangement similar to that observed for the P.

Fur was also supported by the identification of a “Fur
box” upstream of RyhB (Figure 3B). To test the possibility that the expression of acnA and sdhA is independent of RyhB, S. oneidensis was transformed with a
RyhB expression plasmid and quantitative RT-PCR
performed. RyhB was 60-fold over-expressed relative to
endogenous levels in MR-1 and the fur mutant (Table
1). Notably, the expression of SdhA and AcnA mRNAs
remained unchanged by RyhB over-expression. In contrast, expression of the superoxide dismutase encoded
by sodB was repressed, suggesting that the S. oneidensis sodB was negatively regulated by RyhB. In addition,
over-expression of RyhB did not change the growth
pattern of MR-1 or the fur mutant in the presence of
succinate or fumarate (data not shown). Together,
these results suggest that negative regulation of RyhB
by Fur exists in S. oneidensis, but sdhA and acnA are
not part of Fur-RyhB regulon. Therefore, the TCA
cycle in S. oneidensis is independent of Fur and RyhB
control.

aeruginosa ryhB [27]. The putative “Fur box” was also
detected upstream of all of the ryhB homologs, suggesting that regulation of RyhB by Fur is a common feature
among the Shewanella species.
Over-expression of RyhB has no impact on the expression
of TCA cycle genes

In E. coli, RyhB is highly up-regulated in a fur mutant,
which in turn inhibits the expression of AcnA and
SdhABCD enzymes and thus the TCA cycle. Since the
expression of AcnA and SdhA remained unchanged in
the S. oneidensis fur mutant, two possibilities exist as
either RyhB is not regulated by Fur or that acnA and
sdhA expression is independent of RyhB. To test the
possibility that RyhB is not regulated by Fur, quantitative RT-PCR was performed to examine RyhB expression. As shown in Table 1, RyhB was induced 20-fold
in the fur mutant. When the fur deletion was complemented by exogenous expression of Fur on the expression vector pBBR1MCS5-1, the RhyB induction was
abolished (Table 1). In addition, regulation of RyhB by

Discussion
It is of interest to note that succinate and fumarate cannot support the growth of MR-1. Genomics analysis
indicates that MR-1 contain the complete gene set
required for TCA cycle. However, a recent metabolic
flux analysis [17] showed that the anaplerotic pathway
(Pyr ® Mal) and (Pyr ® PEP) were unidirectional, indicating that succinate and fumarate could not be used to
produce pyruvate and Acetyl-CoA. Since Acetyl-CoA is
the precursor of critical biomass components such as
lipids, the inability to convert succinate and fumarate
into Acetyl-CoA leads to the growth inhibition of MR-1.
In contrast, lactate could be metabolized into pyruvate
as well as other central metabolites and thus supports
the cell growth.
The inability of E. coli fur mutant to grow on succinate or fumarate has been attributed to the down-regulation of acnA and sdhCDAB by the Fur-regulated small
RNA, RyhB [7]. However, this regulatory mechanism of
TCA cycle is not present in the g-proteobacterium S.
oneidensis, as evidenced by three observations: (1) both
microarray and quantitative RT-PCR experiments
showed that expression of acnA and sdhA remained
unchanged in the fur mutant; (2) MR-1 and the fur
mutant showed similar reduction of succinate and fumarate; and (3) succinate or fumarate enhanced the growth
of the fur mutant. To explain the observations, we
showed that although S. oneidensis RyhB was up-regulated in the fur mutant, over-expressing RyhB caused little change in the expression of acnA and sdhA as well as
the growth with succinate or fumarate. Therefore, acnA
and sdhA are not part of the Fur-RyhB regulon in S.
oneidensis.

Yang et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/264

Intriguingly, we found that over-expressing RyhB
enhanced the growth of the fur mutant in LB medium
containing iron chelator (unpublished data), suggesting
that RyhB plays a role in iron response of S. oneidensis.
However, additional work is needed to delineate the regulon of RyhB and its regulatory mechanism.
RyhB acts as a post-transcriptional regulator by base
pairing with its target mRNAs [7]. Therefore, it is possible to predict its direct targets by surveying DNA
sequences for possible base-pairing. A likely target is the
SodB mRNA, as evidenced by the presence of sequences
in the “core” region of Shewanella RyhB that could
potentially base-pair with SodB mRNA [24] and the
repression of sodB in strains over-expressing RyhB
(Table 1). No likely base pairing between RyhB and
sdhCDAB or acnA was noted by manual inspection or
by computational programs designed to predict small
RNA targets [28,29]. Worthy of mention is that a program called TargetRNA [29] identified possible base
pairing between ryhB and Fur genes (Figure 5), implying

Page 7 of 10

the possibility of a regulatory feedback loop. Such a regulatory circuit has recently been verified in E. coli [30].
In addition, several genes involved in anaerobic respiration, such as those encoding alcohol dehydrogenase II
(AdhB), anaerobic DMSO reductase (DmsA-1), NADH:
ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit (NqrC-2) and two ctype cytochromes (ScyA & SO1659), possess extensive
complementary regions with ryhB (Figure 5). Although
interesting, these predictions require experimental validation involving a ryhB null mutant. Nevertheless, we
have not been able to generate the mutant despite of
multiple attempts, which might be attributed to technical difficulties or the possibility that ryhB is an essential
gene in S. oneidensis.
The differences we observed in the RyhB regulon,
relative to that of E. coli, are perhaps not surprising in
light of the low level of sequence conservation among
ryhB genes in phylogenetically related bacteria, implying
that ryhB evolves at a rapid pace. Thus far, the only persistent structural features among the known ryhB

significant, as judged by p value less than 0.01 [29].

homologs are the presence of an upstream Fur binding
site and a region complementary to the SodB mRNA.
The former has been employed to identify ryhB in P.
aeruginosa [27].
Accumulating evidence suggests that regulatory pathways in S. oneidensis are distinct from other g-proteobacteria. For example, the E. coli cAMP receptor protein
(CRP) controls the transcription of a number of catabolic genes, but its S. oneidensis homolog is involved in
regulation of anaerobic respiration [31]. Also, a major
regulator of anaerobic respiration in E. coil (FNR) shows
little involvement in anaerobic respiration in S. oneidensis [32-34]. Furthermore, the regulons of the global regulators ArcA and Fur are clearly distinct from that in
other bacteria despite significant overlap [10,35].

Growth conditions and strain construction

5’- and 3’RACE assays

M1 defined medium [36] was used. Cell growth was
measured by a type FP-1100-C Bioscreen C machine
(Thermo Labsystems) at 600 nm after growing cells to
mid-logarithmic phase and diluting 1:100 into 300 μl
fresh medium. Triplicate cultures were used to determine average and standard deviation. To prepare cultures for real time PCR (RT-PCR), strains were
inoculated into 20-50 ml medium in 250 ml flasks. The
cultures were incubated at 30°C with vigorous shaking
(250 rpm). When the cultures reached mid-logarithmic
phase, the cells were collected by centrifugation and
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were stored at -80°
C prior to RNA extraction.
For exogenous expression of Fur and RyhB, the fur
and ryhB open reading frames (ORFs) were PCR amplified with primers fur-F1 and fur-R1, and ryhB-F1 and
ryhB-R1, respectively (Table 2). The PCR products were
digested with SalI and EcoRI, and cloned into the
broad-range expression vector pBBR1MCS5-1 (Km r ),
placing the ORFs under the transcriptional control of a
strong lac promoter. The resulting plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing and transferred into E. coli
WM3064, which is a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) auxotroph with plasmid RK4 integrated in the chromosome
to mobilize plasmid in trans during conjugation [37].
Conjugation was carried out by mating E. coli and S.
oneidensis in 1:1 donor/recipient ratio for 8 hrs on a

HPLC analyses

S. oneidensis wild-type (strain MR-1) and the fur mutant
were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in M1 medium
with 10 mM lactate as the sole carbon source. Cell density was determined by cell counting under microscope
and 5 × 10 9 cells were collected by centrifugation,
washed three times with PBS, and inoculated into 3 ml

Yang et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/264

of fresh M1 medium with 10 mM of one of the following carbon sources: lactate, succinate or fumarate. These
cultures were incubated at 30°C with vigorous shaking,
and at time 0, 36 and 54 hrs, 1 ml culture was centrifuged. The supernatant was used for HPLC with an
Elite LaChrom system (Hitachi). The samples were filtered with PALL Life Science Acrodisc 13 mm syringe
filters with 0.2 μm nylon membranes, and analyzed with
5 mM H 2 S0 4 mobile phase filtered with Gelman
Sciences Nylaflo 47 mm 0.45 μm nylon membrane filter
paper, degassed and at 0.5 mL/min flowrate for 35 mins
with Biorad -Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8).
The column temperature was maintained at 60°C, and
the RI detector maintained at 50°C.
RNA isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR

Total cellular RNA was isolated using the TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA samples were treated with RNase-free
DNase I (Ambion) to digest residual chromosomal DNA
and purified with RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) prior to spectrophotometric quantification at 260 nm. For RT-PCR, 0.1
μg RNA template was used in a Superscript One-step
RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The primers used were ryhB-F2 and R2, control 1-6 F and R (Table 2).
5’- and 3’-RACE assays

RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) experiments
were carried out essentially as described [19]. For 5’
RACE, the 5’-triphosphates of 15 μg total RNAs were
converted to monophosphates by 25 units of tobacco
acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre Technologies) at 37°C
for 1 hr, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and
ethanol precipitation. Precipitated RNA was resuspended in water and ligated to 500 pmol 5’- RNA adapter (Table 2). The ligated product was purified by
phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation,
and reverse transcribed with 2 pmol sRNA-specific primer RyhB-R3 using the Thermoscript RT system (Invitrogen). The product was amplified by PCR, cloned into
a pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. 3’RACE assays were performed similarly to 5’-RACE,
except that total RNA was dephosphorylated by calf
intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs),
ligated to a 3’-RNA adapter (Table 2) and reverse transcribed with 100 pmol of a single primer complementary to the 3’-RNA adapter.
Quantitative RT-PCR

The cDNA template for RT-PCR was synthesized in a
10 μl final reaction volume containing 3 μg of total
RNA, 3 μg random primers (Invitrogen), 0.5 μM dNTPs,
10 mM DTT, 1 × first-strand buffer and 100 U of

Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After
incubation at 42°C for 2 hours, the reaction was diluted
five fold in H2O and stored at -80°C. Quantitative RTPCR was carried out in an iCycler thermal cycler (BioRad) in a 30 μl reaction mixture containing 15 μl iQ
SYBR supermix (Molecular Probes), 1 μl cDNA template, and 160 nM forward and reverse primers. Primers
were designed using the program Omiga 2.0 (Oxford
Molecular) to yield a PCR product of ~100 bp in length
(Table 2). Four technical replicates were performed for
each of at least three biological replicates. The housekeeping gene recA was used as an internal control. That
is, all results were normalized to the recA results
obtained in parallel on the same sample to adjust for
variation introduced during reverse transcription and
RT-PCR. Specifically, the expression values were normalized by subtracting the mean of the recA expression
values of the same samples. Different sources of variation (e.g. biological and technical replicates) were
accounted for by linear mixed models [38]. The significance of the ratios between two samples was determined
using a two-sided t-test, with a type 1 error of 0.05.
