Abstract
Background: Domains are the basic functional units of proteins. It is believed that protein-protein
interactions are realized through domain interactions. Revealing multi-domain cooperation can
provide deep insights into the essential mechanism of protein-protein interactions at the domain
level and be further exploited to improve the accuracy of protein interaction prediction.
Results: In this paper, we aim to identify cooperative domains for protein interactions by
extending two-domain interactions to multi-domain interactions. Based on the high-throughput
experimental data from multiple organisms with different reliabilities, the interactions of domains
were inferred by a Linear Programming algorithm with Multi-domain pairs (LPM) and an
Association Probabilistic Method with Multi-domain pairs (APMM). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach not only can find cooperative domains effectively but also has a
higher accuracy for predicting protein interaction than the existing methods. Cooperative domains,
including strongly cooperative domains and superdomains, were detected from major interaction
databases MIPS and DIP, and many of them were verified by physical interactions from the crystal
structures of protein complexes in PDB which provide intuitive evidences for such cooperation.
Comparison experiments in terms of protein/domain interaction prediction justified the benefit of
considering multi-domain cooperation.
Conclusion: From the computational viewpoint, this paper gives a general framework to predict
protein interactions in a more accurate manner by considering the information of both multidomains and multiple organisms, which can also be applied to identify cooperative domains, to
reconstruct large complexes and further to annotate functions of domains. Supplementary

Background
Many proteins involved in signal transduction, gene regulation and other biological activities require interaction
with other proteins or cofactors to achieve specific processes [1,2]. Elucidating protein-protein interactions can
provide deep insights into protein functions and intracellular signaling pathways. Owing to the recent rapid
advances in high-throughput technologies, protein-protein interaction data of various species are increasingly
accumulated from different experiments and deposited in
several main databases such as DIP [3] and MIPS [4]. This
collection of protein-protein interaction data results in a
rich, but quite noisy and still incomplete source of information [5,6] which needs to be analyzed and completed
by sophisticated computational methods.
In recent years, a number of computational algorithms
have been developed to infer protein-protein interactions,
such as those methods based on gene fusion (Rosetta
Stone) [7,8], phylogenetic profile [9], protein structure
[10], and domain information [11]. In particular, inferring protein-protein interactions (PPI) based on domain
information, such as association method [11], probabilistic method [12-14], SVM-based method [15], and LPbased approach [16], has attracted much attention due to
its clear biological implication and simplicity. In addition
to these methods for protein interaction prediction, inferring domain-domain interactions (DDI) by integrating
multiple data sources has also been investigated [17-19].
Domain-based protein interaction prediction assumes
that proteins are composed by a set of recognition elements which are referred to as domains, and protein-protein interactions are achieved through domain
interactions [12]. A typical procedure for these methods
includes two steps. Firstly domain interactions are
inferred from experimental protein interactions, and then
new protein interactions are predicted based on the
inferred domain interactions according to either a probabilistic or deterministic model. The difference between
probabilistic and deterministic models is whether or not
they are based on the probabilistic formula describing the
relations between domain interactions and protein interactions [12]. Most existing algorithms consider domaindomain pairs as the basic units of protein-protein interactions, and these domain-domain interactions are assumed
to be independent. However, such an assumption is actually not biologically reasonable because two or more
domains may cooperatively interact with another domain
[20]. In addition, there are many superdomains where
two domains always appear together in individual proteins to mediate the interactions. Given the close relations
between two domains in a superdomain, the independence assumption of domain-domain interactions does
not generally hold. For example, domain 4 of RNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/391

polymerase Rpb1 (PF05000) and domain 1 of RNA
polymerase Rpb1 (PF00623) constitute a superdomain,
and they always appear together in individual proteins
such as YOR341W, YDL140C and YOR116C, and have
many common domain interaction partners [21].
Recently, Han et al. studied domain combinations in protein interactions [22,23]. In their work, the appearance
frequencies of domain combinations in a set of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs are counted to construct AP (Appearance Probability) matrices [22,23]
which provide useful information about the distribution
of multi-domain interactions. For example, among the
listed 300 domain combination pairs with high appearance probability values (top300) which are counted based
on the total 5826 protein interaction pairs in yeast, there
are 246 two-domain pairs, 44 three-domain pairs and 10
four and above domain pairs. Such statistical result indicates that many domains are closely correlated and tend
to appear in interacting protein pairs together. In addition, Wang and Caetano-Anolles [24] used the occurrence
and abundance of the molecular interactome of domain
combinations to construct global phylogenic trees. When
a closely correlated domain combination appears in an
interactome, domains in this combination may mediate
the interaction simultaneously and cooperatively.
Similar to proteins in a complex which cooperatively bind
to each other so as to achieve specific functions [1], there
is also such a cooperation among domains in protein
interactions. For example, Klemm and Pabo [25] found
that two unlinked polypeptides corresponding to the
POU-specific domain and the POU homeo domain in
protein Oct-1 bind cooperatively to the octamer site.
Moza et al. [20] showed that the binding energetics
between different hot regions consisting of interfacial residues in a protein-protein interaction are not strictly additive. Cooperative binding energetics between distinct hot
regions is significant. They pointed out that cooperativity
between hot regions has significant implications for the
prediction of protein-protein interactions. When the hot
regions are distributed over different domains in proteins,
the cooperativity between different hot regions is actually
embodied by multi-domain cooperation. Hence, revealing such domain cooperation may provide deep insights
into the essential mechanism of protein interactions at the
domain level, and can also be further exploited to
improve the accuracy of protein interaction prediction.
In this paper, we firstly aim to identify cooperative
domains from protein interaction data by extending twodomain interactions to multi-domain interactions. Cooperative domains mean that the strength of their cooperative interaction with some domain is stronger than the
corresponding domain-domain interactions. Then, by

employing the information of both multi-domains and
multiple organisms, we propose a general framework
based on a Linear Programming with Multi-domain pairs
(LPM) and an Association Probabilistic Method with
Multi-domain pairs (APMM), to predict protein interactions in a more accurate manner. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach not only can identify
cooperative domains effectively but also has a higher
accuracy for predicting protein interactions than the existing methods. Cooperative domains, including strongly
cooperative domains and superdomains, were detected
from major interaction databases, e.g. MIPS and DIP, and
many of them were verified by checking physical interactions from the crystal structures of protein complexes in
PDB (Protein Data Bank). These crystal structures of complexes provide intuitive evidences for such cooperation. In
addition, comparison experiments in terms of protein/
domain interaction prediction also justified the benefit of
considering multi-domain cooperation.

Results
In this paper, we investigate domain cooperation in protein interactions by extending two-domain interactions to
multi-domain interactions. We first define the types of
domains and domain pairs, and then describe the main
results. Assume that there are M domains D1, …, DM
involved in the experimental interaction data. We use
(Dm, Dn) to represent a two-domain pair, one domain in

a protein and the other in another protein, and use (DmDr, Dn) to denote a generalized pair i.e. a three-domain
pair, where Dm and Dr appear in one protein (denoted by
Dm-Dr) and Dn in another protein. A multi-domain pair
means a two-domain pair or a three-domain pair. In Figure 1(a), we list all the multi-domain pairs in proteins (P1,
P2). A cooperative-domain pair (cooperative-domain
interaction) implies a generalized pair (Dm-Dr, Dn) in
which two domains Dm-Dr referred as cooperative
domains coexist in a protein P1 and cooperatively interact
with Dn in another protein P2. The cooperative-domain
pair should have a stronger interaction effect than the corresponding two-domain pairs (Dm, Dn) and (Dr, Dn). A
strongly cooperative-domain pair (strongly cooperativedomain interaction) is a cooperative-domain pair (Dm-Dr,
Dn) which satisfies that there is an interaction effect of Dm
or Dr on Dn only if the domains Dm and Dr appear
together. In Figure 1(b), D1 and D2 are strongly cooperative domains interacting with D3 because all other domain
pairs involving D1 or D2 have no interactions. A superdomain implies two 'combined' domains Dm-Dr which are
special cooperative domains and always appear together
in individual proteins. Note that we extend two-domain
interactions only to three-domain interactions because
the cooperation of more than three domains is believed to
be rare compared with the cases of two and three domains
according to statistics [22].

The concept of cooperative domains in our work seems to
be similar to Han et al.'s "domain combination" [22,23].
However, there are two fundamental differences between
these two concepts. Firstly, the definition of domain combination is not related to domain interaction strength.
Each domain combination pair is considered in their
approach, no matter what its appearance frequency is in
interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. In contrast,
the definition of cooperative domains emphasizes "cooperation" and is related to domain interaction strength. By
an elaborated variable selection strategy (see Methods),
only when the interaction strength of a three-domain pair
(Dm-Dr, Dn) is larger than those of the corresponding twodomain pairs (Dm, Dn) and (Dr, Dn), this three-domain
pair can possibly be a cooperative-domain pair and considered in the model. Secondly, there is no redundant correlation between different domain combinations in our
work. For example, if a three-domain pair (Dm-Dr, Dn) is
considered in our method according to the rules of selecting variables (i.e. Dm, Dr are considered as cooperative
domains), the two-domain pairs (Dm, Dn) and (Dr, Dn)
will not be included into the consideration as interacting
domains in the same protein pair to eliminate the redundancy, in contrast to the high correlation among Han et
al.'s domain combinations [22,23].
In the following text, Pr(dm, n = 1) represents the probability that domain Dm interacts with Dn. Pr(dmr, n = 1) represents the probability that domains Dm and Dr
cooperatively interact with Dn. Similarly, Pr(dm, nr = 1) represents the probability that domains Dn and Dr cooperatively interact with Dm. Our approach for detecting
cooperative domains in protein-protein interactions can
be summarized as three steps. First, we extend the conventional probabilistic model for inferring domain interactions to accommodate multi-domain pairs. Then, the
interaction probabilities of multi-domain pairs are estimated by the proposed approach. Finally, according to
the interaction probabilities of multi-domain pairs, cooperative domains and superdomains are detected. The
detailed information on the methodology is given in
Methods.
Identification of multi-domain cooperation
Identifying cooperative domains and superdomains
Our method is able to identify biologically meaningful
superdomains and putative cooperative domains. We
illustrate this feature by using MIPS data set. A cooperative
domain pair has a stronger interaction effect than their
corresponding two-domain pairs. Therefore, domains Dm
and Dr are cooperative domains if Pr(dm, n = 1) <Pr(dmr, n =
1) and Pr(dr, n = 1) <Pr(dmr, n = 1) from the results of LPM
or APMM. From the definitions, domains in a superdomain or in a strongly cooperative-domain pair are
expected to have similar biological functions. We applied

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/391

our approach to protein physical interaction data in
MIPS1 (see Methods) to get reliable cooperative-domain
interactions.
Totally we found 5187 two-domain interactions (with nozero interaction probability), 83 superdomains and 650
cooperative-domain pairs, among which 525 pairs are
strongly cooperative domain interactions according to the
above definition. Some detected (strongly) cooperative
domains and superdomains in MIPS1 are respectively
listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. To investigate functional relations of domains in these superdomains and cooperative
domains, we listed their Pfam descriptions and GO annotations. GO similarity was computed for two domains
both with GO annotations in superdomains (Table 1).
From these tables, we can see that two domains in most
superdomains and some cooperative domains have similar GO annotations or belong to a same family, which is
consistent with our hypotheses, i.e., domains in a cooperative-domain interaction work cooperatively to facilitate
specific functions. For instance, two domains in superdomains PF05000-PF00623, PF02775-PF00205, PF02800PF00044 or PF00488–PF05192 have identical or similar
functions at the respective GO levels. For those superdomains without GO annotations, the Pfam descriptions of
two domains in most of them are also similar, such as
PF08033-PF04810, PF03953-PF0009 or PF08544PF00288. For cooperative domains, some of them have
similar GO annotations of functions, such as PF00806PF00076, where PF00806 is a Pumilio-family RNA binding repeat and PF00076 is a RNA recognition motif. Both
domains are necessary for RNA binding. Some cooperative domains have no GO annotations but belong to same
families, such as PF01466–PF03931. Both PF01466
(Skp1, dimerisation domain) and PF03931 (Skp1_POZ,
tetramerisation domain) belong to the Skyp1 family. It is
interesting that three domains in the strongly cooperativedomain interaction (PF04998-PF00623, PF01191) are
found to have same functions, and they are all RNA
polymerase domains. As another example, we identified
cooperative domains PF00036–PF08226, and the Pfam
description also supports the combination of PF08226
(DUF1720) with PF00036 (EF hand) [21]. Such facts
imply that we can infer the functions of cooperative
domains if one of them has known functions. We also
applied our approach to DIP data set, and the detected
superdomains and cooperative domains are given in
Tables I-III (Additional File 1)
Verifying cooperative domains by crystal structures
In this section, we verify the detected cooperative domains
by checking their physical interactions from the crystal
structures of protein complexes in PDB and examine the
essential mechanism of protein interactions at the
domain level. The complex crystal structures in PDB can

be regarded as a gold standard to verify protein interactions and domain interactions. The seq2struct web
resource [26] was used to search sequence-structure links.
By focusing on the protein pairs in which proteins are
mapped to the same PDB IDs but possess different chain
IDs, we found 50 protein pairs with crystal structures that
contain cooperative-domain pairs identified by our
approach (t-test value is significant by comparing with
randomly generated domain pairs).
Figure 2 shows cooperative domains in a complex crystal
structure formed by physical interactions of proteins
P02994 (ORFs: YBR118W, YPR080W) and P32471 (ORF:
YAL003W), where P02994 has three domains and
P32471 has one domain PF00736. This complex is also
included in the complex database PROTCOM [27]. Interacting protein pairs and their Pfam domain annotations
are described in this figure. Clearly, EF-1 guanine nucleotide exchange domain PF00736 in P32471 has interactions with all of the domains in P02994. These
interactions are verified by the binding sites of PF00736
with the domains in P02994. The cartoon of crystal structure illustrates that all cooperative-domain interactions in
(P02994, P32471) are correctly identified and supported
by the interfacial residues involved in the interaction. The

interfacial residues are picked out by a simple rule, i.e.
their Cα atoms are within the distance threshold 10Å,
which is consistent with the more accurate computation
given in PROTCOM. This example provides an intuitive
evidence for the cooperation among domains in the interaction of P02994 and P32471.
Furthermore we also revealed some complexes in PDB
which are not reported by PROTCOM [27]. For example,
three domains Arm, IBB and IBN_N which belong to
Armadillo repeat superfamily form a cooperative-domain
interaction (PF00514–PF01749, PF03810), and such
multi-domain cooperation leads to the complex formed
by protein Q02821 (YNL189W) and P33307 (YGL238W)
(PDB ID 1wa5, GTP-Binding nuclear protein RAN). Generally, multiple cooperative-domain interactions in an
interacting protein pair often correspond to a more complicated complex. The complete list of all the verified
cooperative domain interactions by crystal structures in
PDB and more detailed information are provided on our
web site.

PPI prediction based on multi-domain cooperation
Test on numerical PPI data sets
In addition to identifying superdomains and cooperative
domains, our approach has a higher prediction accuracy
for protein interactions by exploiting the information of
both multi-domains and multiple organisms. In this section, we compared LPM and APMM with the existing
methods, such as association based methods (ASNM [16],
ASSOC [11]), and EM method [12]. Among those existing
methods, the ASSOC and EM are developed for the binary
interaction data whereas ASNM can be applied to experiment ratio data. We evaluated each method by fivefold
cross validation on Ito's experiment ratio data [28] and
assessed the prediction accuracy by root-mean-square
error (RMSE) (see Methods).

The performance of each method in terms of RMSE and
elapsed training time for fivefold cross-validation is summarized in Table 4. In order to check the effect of cooperative domains on the accuracy, here we computed RMSE
only on those protein pairs containing cooperativedomain pairs. RMSE comparison results on all protein

pairs are given in Table IV and Table V (Additional file 1).
From Table 4 we can see that the performances of EM and
ASSOC methods on experiment ratio data are not good
since their training and testing errors are very high. ASNM
which is an extension of ASSOC has much better results
than ASSOC. LPM has a lower training and testing error
than the methods based on two-domain pairs. Table 4
also indicates that APMM has the lowest error in both
training and testing prediction of protein interactions. In
addition, there is no significant increase on the computation time when multi-domain pairs are included.
The results for Ito's dataset in five rounds are not so consistent because there may exist bias in five divided subsets
due to the small size of this dataset. Another larger dataset
used for cross-validation is Krogan's confidence data [29]
(see Methods). We used this set to test if or not various
methods can correctly predict the interaction confidence
of protein pairs. The result is summarized in Table 5, from
which we can see that for the confidence prediction, our
approach (LPM and APMM) employing multi-domain
pairs again has better performance both in training and in

testing than other methods. LPM generally has less training error than APMM but its testing error is slightly higher
than that of APMM. An example to illustrate the effect of
cooperative domains on the prediction accuracy is given
in Additional file 1. We also made a direct comparison of
our approach based on two-domain pairs and multidomain pairs, and the results are summarized in Figure 3.
We can see that LPM based on multi-domain pairs in
training and testing has less prediction error in each round
of fivefold cross validation than LPM based on only twodomain pairs. APMM also has such a tendency except the
first round in testing. Such results further confirm the benefit of considering multi-domain interactions.
Test on binary PPI data sets from multiple organisms
Compared with single organism, data sets from multiple
organisms can provide more information, e.g. they cover
more domains. In contrast to the existing methods which
mainly use the data from single organism, LPM and
APMM can employ the data sets from multiple organisms
with the consideration of their different reliabilities. In
this section, we used binary interaction data from multiple organisms collected by Liu et al. [14] (see Methods) to

compare our approach with the extended EM algorithm
[14] and validate the benefit of multi-domain pairs on
binary interaction data.
Based on the same test set and training set, it is convenient
to compare our methods and the extended EM [14]. The
training sets respectively consist of protein interactions
from single organism (yeast) and multiple organisms.
Based on yeast protein interaction dataset, we found 4556
two-domain interactions (with no-zero interaction probability), 94 superdomains, 652 cooperative domain pairs,
among which 640 pairs are strongly cooperative-domain
interactions. In the protein interaction dataset of three
organisms, we detected 34123 two-domain interactions
(with no-zero interaction probability), 259 superdomains
and 5633 cooperative-domain interactions, where 5400
are strongly cooperative. Among the cooperative-domain
interactions in yeast and three organisms, 117 pairs are
yeast-specific. With these domain interactions, the prediction accuracy of protein-protein interactions is measured
by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,
which is a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against
the false positive rate (1–specificity) for different thresh-

olds. The result is plotted in Figure 4(a), from which we
can see that APMM has a higher prediction accuracy than
the extended EM algorithm on multiple-organism data.
The AUC values of APMM, EM trained on multiple-organism data and EM trained on single-organism data are
respectively 0.766, 0.701 and 0.611. This result indicates
that APMM is also effective on binary interaction data.
LPM has a similar performance as APMM which is not
shown here.
To examine the effect of cooperative domains on prediction accuracy based on binary interaction data, we used
the same training set and directly compared the prediction
accuracies of APMM with multi-domain pairs and with
only two-domain pairs. The result summarized in Figure
4(b) confirms that APMM with multi-domain pairs has a
higher prediction accuracy. The performance of LPM was
also confirmed in a similar manner.
Evaluation at domain level and comparison with other
methods
In this section, we evaluated our methods at the domain
level by comparing the predicted domain interactions
with domain interactions in iPfam [30] and the confidence DDI data in InterDom [31] (see Methods). The
same data set in above section was used as training set.

The comparison results of the predicted domain interactions by LPM and APMM with those in iPfam are summarized in Table 6 with the significance of the overlap (pvalue) computed by comparing with randomly predicted
domain pairs (see Methods). We can see that domain
interactions predicted by our approach have a significant
overlap with iPfam and domain interactions predicted
from multiple-organism data have larger overlap with

iPfam owing to exploiting more information. Note that
the overlap proportion is not so big. This is mainly
because the amount of data in iPfam is highly incomplete
and many domain interactions do not appear in iPfam.
The comparison results of the predicted domain interactions by LPM and APMM with those in InterDom are summarized in Table 7 with p-values, which shows that the
overlap with InterDom is significant and the interaction
probabilities of predicted domain pairs are positively correlated with those in InterDom, i.e. a higher threshold
corresponds to a higher mean confidence score. In addition, when selecting the same number of top high-scoring
predicted domain interactions, the prediction result
exploiting multiple-organism data has a much higher
mean confidence score than that based on single-organism data, which is shown in Figure 5.
The domain interactions in iPfam have been used as a
gold standard set to evaluate the predicted domaindomain interactions [17,19]. We conducted a comparison
experiment to evaluate the performance of our approach
and the methods in Riley et al. [17] and Guimeraes et al.
[19] based on the number of high-scoring domaindomain interactions confirmed by the gold standard set.
Specifically, three methods (APMM in our work, DPEA in
[17], PE in [19]) were applied in a same training set (DIP
data, see Methods) and we checked the overlap of the predicted domain-domain interactions with iPfam by selecting a same number of high-scoring predicted domain
interactions. The results based on 3005 high-scoring predicted domain interactions (provided by Riley et al. [17]
and Guimeraes et al. [19]) are listed in Figure 6, where
PE(1) denotes PE approach with network reliability 60%

approach with network reliability 50% (LP-score ≥ 0.4,
pw-score ≤ 0.1). APMM(1) means APMM based on multidomain pairs and APMM(2) means APMM based on twodomain pairs. From Figure 6, we can see that our method
has a comparable result with PE and a better performance
than DPEA in terms of DDI prediction. Of course, this
comparison result suffers from the incompleteness of the
data in iPfam. Compared with APMM based on twodomain pairs, APMM based on multi-domain pairs has a
slightly smaller iPfam overlap. This is because when our
methods include multi-domain pairs, according to the
definition of cooperative domains and the rule of selecting variables, some two-domain pairs are replaced with
cooperative-domain pairs. At the same time, the current
gold standard set only contains two-domain interactions.
The distribution of the iPfam overlaps is shown in Figure
7 which indicates that our method can be an important
complement since there is a large proportion of predicted
DDIs not covered by other methods. Note that except twodomain interactions, our method can also infer cooperative-domain interactions.
As for identifying cooperative domains, we made a rough
comparison with Han et al.'s domain combination
approach [22,23]. Han et al. provided on their website
[32] a set of 5826 proteins based on which they listed 300
predicted domain combination interacting pairs with top
confidence. Among these 300 pairs, there are 246 twodomain pairs, 44 three-domain pairs and 10 four and
above domain pairs. We applied our approach to the
same dataset and found 34 cooperative-domain pairs
(with interaction probability 1.0) among 500 high-scoring domain interactions, 225 among 1000 high-scoring
domain interactions, and 635 among 2000 high-scoring
domain interactions. Note that in 500 high-scoring

domain interactions, the number of cooperative domains
is not more than Han's (34/500<44/300), but when the
threshold is lower, we found more cooperative domains.
This is mainly due to the difference between the definitions of cooperative domains and domain combinations.
In our approach, if a two-domain pair has a stronger interaction, the three-domain pair in the same protein pair will
not be included as potential cooperative domains. If twodomain pairs have weaker interactions than the corresponding cooperative-domain interaction, this threedomain pair will be considered and the two-domain pairs
will be excluded in the same protein pair. In other words,
we eliminate the redundancy between domain combinations, whereas in Han et al.'s method, each domain combination is included.

Discussion
In this work, cooperative domains, strongly cooperative
domains and superdomains in MIPS and DIP were
detected, and many of them were verified by the crystal
structures in PDB. Functional relations in superdomains
and cooperative domains were examined by the terms of
GO. Among the detected superdomains, we found that
two domains in most of them belong to a same family and
have similar or identical functions. Such fact is biologically reasonable because the two domains in a superdomain always appear together in individual proteins and
participate in interaction processes simultaneously. It is
interesting that many domains that act as superdomains
are binding domains, such as snoRNA binding, ATP binding, DNA binding, FAD-binding, NAD-binding, GTP
binding, protein binding, and Lum-binding. For cooperative domains, some of them have dissimilar functions
partly because domain cooperation needs complementary
functions [33]. Cooperative domains tend to be contained

in big complicated protein complexes. For example,
among cooperative domains with crystal structures, 72%
of (36/50) them are involved in large complexes with
more than five proteins. This fact to some extent illustrates
that multi-domain cooperation can be easily achieved in
a multi-protein complex where protein cooperation is
prominent.
Multi-domain cooperation information can be explored
to reconstruct the structure of a large protein complex.
Protein complexes are key molecular entities that inte-

grate multiple gene products to perform cellular functions. Recently, tandem-affinity-purification coupled to
mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) which combines affinity
tags-based protein purification technique and mass spectrometry for identifying a tagged protein and its interaction partners [34] has been applied to find the genomewide screen for complexes [29,35]. However, although
many complexes have now been identified, the detailed
interacting relationships among the components are
beyond our knowledge because only a few of them have
3D structural information. As pointed in Aloy and Russell

[36], X-ray crystallography provides atomic-resolution
models for proteins and complexes, but it is difficult for
this technique to obtain sufficient information for the
crystallization of large complexes. NMR is generally limited to proteins that have no more than 300 residues. It is
therefore necessary and timely to develop new approaches
that can reconstruct the structures of complexes based on
protein structures and their interaction relationships [37].
The detected cooperative domains in this work can be
applied to this problem by combining with docking procedures.
As an example, Figure 8 illustrates how to reconstruct the
RNA Polymerase II-TFIIS complex (PDB ID 1y1v) by our
approach at protein, domain and atomic levels respectively with the following five steps. In the first step, from
the information of TAP-MS, there are total 13 different
proteins (P04050, P08518, P16370, P20433, P20434,
P20435, P34087, P20436, P27999, P22139, P38902,
P40422, P07273) in this complex as its subunits (Figure
8(a)). Then, in the second step, according to Pfam and
protein sequences, all possible domains for each protein
in terms of Pfam architectures can be obtained (Figure
8(b)). There are 30 domains involved in this complex, so
it is infeasible to clearly explain the interaction relationships between domains and proteins only by two-domain
pairs (total 1435 pairs). In the third step, cooperative
domain interactions are obtained by performing our
approach on protein interaction data, which provide valuable information (Figure 8(c)). In the fourth step, physical interactions of those 13 proteins in the complex can

be predicted at the protein level (see Figure 8(d), where
thick lines denote the physical interactions realized by
cooperative domain interactions and thin ones are realized by two-domain interactions). In the fifth step, the
interactions between protein pairs are further examined at
the domain levels based on complex structure information. For example, by examining the domain interactions
between proteins P08518 (seven domains) and P16370
(two domains), we found that all of domains in the two
proteins cooperatively interact with other domains except
PF04566, as shown by a 3D structure from PDB in Figure
I (Additional file 1). On the other hand, it is easy to estimate the interaction relations between proteins by considering cooperative domains. For example, proteins P04050
and P08518 probably have the strongest interaction
because they have many cooperative-domain interactions.
By further combining our method with a protein docking
procedure (for searching the interacting areas of domains)
[38], the detailed interactions at atomic level can be identified, which makes it possible to construct the stable and
coherent crystal structure of a complex.

Conclusion
Domains are viewed as the basic functional units of proteins, and it is believed that protein interactions are
achieved through domain interactions. Most existing
methods for inferring protein interactions from experimental data assume that two-domain pairs are dominating factors for protein interactions. However, like the
cooperation of several proteins in a complex, many
domains may be cooperative in achieving the interaction

of a protein pair. In this paper, we focus on revealing such
domain cooperation by considering multi-domain pairs
as the basic units of protein interactions. In addition, in
contrast to the existing methods which mainly use the
data from single organism, data sets for multiple species
with different reliabilities were exploited in this paper to
make full use of the available information. From the computational viewpoint, this paper provides a general framework based on APMM and LPM to predict protein
interactions in a more accurate manner by considering the
information of both multi-domain pairs and multiple
organisms, which can also be applied to identify cooperative domains. Experiment results demonstrated that our
method not only can find superdomains and putative
cooperative domains effectively but also has a higher prediction accuracy of protein interactions than the existing
methods. Cooperative domains, strongly cooperative
domains and superdomains in MIPS and DIP were

detected, and many of them were verified by the crystal
structures in PDB. Comparison experiments on protein/
domain interaction prediction confirm the benefit of considering multi-domain cooperation. More detailed results
and software can be found at our website.

In this work, we validated our approach using several
types of experiments which employed various experiment
data sets as follows.
Binary PPI data
When we test our method for detecting cooperative
domains and PPI prediction based on multiple-organism
data, we used binary interaction data in which the information is whether two proteins interact or not. In other
words, there is not a confidence score for each protein-

protein interaction. We collected 4103 physical interactions in yeast from MIPS [4] (the version is
PPI_141105.tab, denoted as MIPS1) and identified superdomains and cooperative domains in this dataset.
For PPI prediction based on multiple-organism data, in
order to make comparison convenient, we used the same
training data and testing data collected by Liu et al. [14].
These datasets are from yeast S.cerevisiae, worm C.elegans
and fly D.melanogaster with respectively 5295, 4714 and
20349 protein interactions. The protein-domain relationships for each protein are extracted from PFAM [21] and

SMART [39]. Among these protein interaction data, only
those with domain information were used. In addition,
like in Liu et al. [14], an independent test set including the
3543 yeast physical interaction pairs in MIPS (denoted it
as MIPS2) was used as positive examples and the other
possible protein pairs, totally 6895215 pairs, as negative
examples.
For comparison experiments at the domain interaction
level, we used protein-protein interactions and protein
domain composition dataset in Riley et al. [17] and Guimaraes et al. [19]. This set was obtained from the DIP
database [3] and contains 26,032 interactions underlying
11,403 proteins from 69 organisms.
Numerical PPI data
Numerical interaction data are defined as opposite to
binary interaction data. It means that each protein-protein
interaction has a score to denote the interaction strength.
It includes experiment ratio data based on IST [28] and
confidence data by integrating various data sources [29].
IST (Interaction Sequence Tags) was used for decoding
interacting proteins in examining two-hybrid interactions.
Experiment ratio data based on IST mean that each protein-protein interaction is provided with the number of
IST hitting in a certain number of experiments. We conducted cross-validation experiment on numerical interaction data. The first set is a well known dataset– the full
data of Ito's dataset [28]. This dataset has 1586 interactions with 1420 proteins containing domain information,
and provides the numerical interaction (ratio) data for
protein pairs based on the number of IST hits. The other
is Krogan's extended dataset [29]. This set has 10265 interactions with 2843 proteins containing domain information. It provides each protein interaction with a
confidence score.

Domain sources and DDI data
The domain information for proteins was extracted from
Pfam 14.0 [21]. For MIPS1, there are total 1483 Pfam
domains involved in 2477 proteins. iPfam database [30]
contains domain-domain interactions confirmed by PDB
crystal structures. It has been used as a gold standard set
for evaluating predicted domain-domain interactions
[17,19]. In this work, 3034 domain interactions in iPfam
(December 2005 version) were used for evaluating
domain interaction prediction. In addition, InterDom
(version 1.2) [31] was also used for this purpose. It is a
database of putative interacting domains derived from
multiple data sources, ranging from domain fusions
(Rosetta Stone), protein interactions (DIP and BIND),
protein complexes (PDB), to scientific literature
(MEDLINE). InterDom 1.2 has 30038 putative domain
interactions with different confidence scores.
Protein complex and crystal structure database
Cooperative domains were confirmed using structural
data of protein complexes from PDB and PROTOCOM.
Protein sequences were mapped from Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL
database to their corresponding structure files using the
seq2struct web resource [26]. PROTOCOM [27] is a collection of protein-protein transient complexes and
domain-domain structures. It provides the detailed information about protein interactions by identifying the contacted residues, presenting the number of residues on the
interface and the list of interfacial residues.

k
Pij = {Dm,n | Dm ∈ Pik , Dn ∈ Pjk } ∪ {Dmr ,n | Dm , Dr ∈ Pik , Dn ∈ Pjk } ∪ {Dm,nr | Dm ∈ Pik , Dn , Dr ∈ Pjk }.

Let the interaction between Pik and Pjk (between Dm and
k
Dn) be represented by a random variable pij (dm, n).

Accordingly we introduce random variables dmr,

n

to

denote whether domains Dm and Dr cooperatively interact
with domain Dn or not. The probabilistic model [12,13]
for inferring protein interactions has two basic assumptions. One is that domain interactions in each protein pair
are independent. The other is that two proteins interact if
and only if there is at least one interacting domain pair in
this protein pair. In the improved model, we also make
these assumptions, but extend two-domain interactions
to multi-domain interactions. Therefore, the interaction
probability of Pik and Pjk is given by

Pr(pij = 1) = 1 −

where Pr( pij = 1) represents the interaction probability of

Probabilistic model with multi-domain pairs
In this section, we describe an improved probabilistic
model for protein interactions by considering the multidomain pairs, which is the essential basis of our method.

Assume that in the protein interactions of K species (or
data sets), there are Nk proteins in dataset k respectively
k
denoted by P1K , …, PN k = 1, …, K, with M domains in
k

all of these proteins represented by D1, …, DM . Let

Pik

also denote a set of domains in the protein i of dataset k.
k
Define Pij to represent a protein pair ( Pik , Pjk ) and Dm, n

to represent a domain pair (Dm, Dn). We also introduce a
symbol Dm, rn for a cooperative-domain pair (Dm - Dr, Dn)
to represent the case that domains Dm and Dr in protein

Pik cooperatively interact with domain Dn in protein Pjk .
Dm,

rn

has a similar implication. In our probabilistic

k
model, Pij is also used to represent the set of domain

pairs including all multi-domain pairs in Pik , and Pjk i.e.,

and Dr cooperatively interact with Dn. Pr(dm, nr = 1) has a
similar meaning. For each protein pair in (1), if there is a
cooperative interaction of domains Dm - Dr with domain
Dn in the second multiplying term, then (Dm, Dn) and (Dr,
Dn) must be excluded from the first multiplying term in
order to maintain the independence assumption; otherwise, (Dm - Dr, Dn) should be deleted. The third multiplying term for (Dm, Dr - Dn) should be checked in the same
way. Clearly, the first multiplying term represents the
effect of two-domain pair interactions while the second
and third multiplying terms stand for the effects of cooperative-domain interactions. In next section, we will show
how to determine those independent variables.
Note that we extend two-domain interactions only to
three-domain interactions because the cooperation
involving more than three domains is believed to be rare
compared with cases of two and three domains, though
theoretically model (1) can be further extended to fourdomain pair and above but with the sacrifice of the computational efficiency. Figure 1(b) gives an example for
inferring domain interactions from protein interaction
and non-interaction data. It indicates that the classical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/391

probabilistic model fails to give the correct result for this
case while our model can do it by considering multidomain interactions.
Selection of independent variables
In order to make the variables of model (1) independent
with each other, we will delete dependent variables
among dm, n, dmr, n and dr, n according to the following strategy. Define

Rm,n =

Im,n
Nm,n

,

there are only 85 such cases. Hence, by the above variable
deletion operations, the assumption can be primarily satisfied. In the following formulation, all the variables
appearing in the formula are those kept after the deleting
strategy, whereas the probabilities of all deleted variables
are set to be zero. Note that, in contrast to the appearance
frequency or interaction strength for selecting cooperative
domains, the two domains in a superdomain are determined based on their co-occurrence, and the cooperativity
are also indirectly confirmed by their identical or similar
functions from GO annotations.

(2)

where Imn is the number of interacting protein pairs in the
training set that contain domain pair Dm, n, and Nm, n is the
total number of protein pairs in the training set that contain Dm, n. Rmr, n and Rr, n are similarly defined. For variables
dm, n, dmr, n and dr, n, the variable deletion strategy is
described by the following procedure.
1. If Rmr, n< Rm, n or Rmr, n< Rr, n, it indicates that the appearance frequency of domain pair Dmr, n in interacting protein
pairs is not higher than those of Dm, n and Dr, n. We consider that there is no cooperation between Dm and Dr in
their interacting with Dn, so we keep the variables dm, n, dr,
n and delete the variable dmr, n in (1).
2. If Rmr, n ≥ Rm, n and Rmr, n ≥ Rr, n, for Dm, n
• when Rmr, n> Rm, n and Imr, n = Im, n, the appearance frequency of domain pair Dmr, n in interacting protein pairs is
higher than those of Dm, n and Dr, n, and furthermore, Dm,
n does not appear in any other interacting protein pair
without Dr. Hence, we consider that Dm and Dr are cooperative when interacting with Dn, and thereby the variable
dm, n is deleted, but the variable dmr, n is kept in (1);
• when Rmr, n = Rm, n and Imr, n = Im, n, it means that Dm and
Dr always appear together in individual proteins. Hence,
Dm and Dr are considered as a superdomain and can be
merged to one. For such a case, we delete variable dm, n but
keep the cooperative-domain pair dmr, n.
The operations are performed in the same way for Dr, n.
For the case of Figure 1(b), variables for all domain pairs
except (D1 - D2, D3) are deleted based on this procedure.
Obviously, the above operations do not cover the case Rmr,
n ≥ Rm, n and Imr, n< Imn. For this case, we cannot determine
if or not there is a cooperative effect of domains Dm and Dr
on their interacting with domain Dn since Dm, n also
appears in the interacting pairs without Dr, thereby we
keep all of them. This may affect the assumption of independence, but there are few such cases. For example, for
the date set MIPS1, among 22325 multi-domain pairs,

Inference of domain interactions
Linear programming with multi-domain pairs
Before predicting protein interactions, we need firstly to
infer domain interactions from multiple datasets. Owing
to experiment noises, each protein interaction dataset has
a false positive rate fpk and a false negative rate fnk·fpk =
k
k
k
k
k
Pr( oij = 1| pij = 0), fnk = Pr( oij = 0| pij = 1). where oij = 1

if the interaction between proteins Pik and Pjk is observed
k
in the dataset and oij = 0 otherwise. Thus the probability

that proteins Pik and Pjk in dataset k are observed to be
interacting in the experiments is related with the real
interaction probability in the following way:
k
k
k
Pr(oij = 1) = Pr(pij = 1)(1 − fnk ) + (1 − Pr(pij = 1)) fpk .

(3)
The parameters fpk and fnk can be estimated from experimental data in a similar way as that in Liu et al. [14].
With the basic probabilistic model (1) and the formula
(3), we have
k
Pr(oij = 1) − fpk

1 − fnk − fpk

= 1−

Pr( oij = 1) when two proteins ( Pik , Pjk ) interact and 0

otherwise in the binary PPI data. For numerical interack
tion data we can set Pr( oij = 1)as the ratio of interactions

between proteins Pik and Pjk in a series of experiments.
Note that the left side may be greater than 1 due to the
incomplete interaction information in binary experiment
data. For such a case we can normalize them first. Let xm, n
= ln(1- Pr(dm, n = 1)), xmr, n = ln(1 - Pr(dmr, n = 1)), xm, nr =

This is a set of linear equalities. If we can find xm, n, xmr, n
and xm, nr (xm, n ≤ 0, xmr, n ≤ 0 and xm, nr ≤ 0) satisfying (5) for
all observed protein interaction data, the domain interaction probabilities Pr(dm, n = 1), Pr(dmr, n = 1) and Pr(dm, nr =
1) fully consistent with the training data can be obtained.
However, it is usually impossible to satisfy all constraints
owing to the noise and incompleteness of experimental
data. In such a case it is natural and reasonable to minimize the total error with respect to L1 norm. Therefore we
can obtain the following Linear Programming with Multidomain pairs (LPM):

where ε ik j is the error for each equality of (5). Model (6)

can be solved by any standard LP technique (see Additional file 1).
Solving (6), we can obtain a set of interaction probabilities for domain pairs. Then, new protein interactions can
be predicted by these inferred domain interactions
through the probabilistic model (1).
Association probabilistic method with multi-domain pairs
Numerical experiments show that LPM performs well, but
is computationally expensive for large scale problems.
Therefore, we introduce a faster probabilistic method
based on statistics. This method is based on a generalization of Association Probabilistic Method [13] with multidomain pairs (APMM). It estimates the interaction probabilities of multi-domain pairs in the following way:

interactions. With these interaction probabilities of
domain pairs, we can predict whether a pair of proteins
interact or not by the formula (1). The computation of
this method is much simple and thus highly efficient. In
addition, it does not require any parameter tuning.
Evaluation measures
We validated our method using several types of experiments with different criteria. For computing the similarity
of GO annotations [40], we adopted a simple method
used successfully in Chen et al. [41] and Wu et al. [42]. In
this method, known proteins are assigned with functional
annotations by a GO Identification (ID). According to the
hierarchical structure of GO annotations, each GO term
corresponds to a numerical GO INDEX. The more
detailed level of the GO INDEX, the more specific is the
function assigned to a protein. The maximum level of GO
INDEX is 14. The function similarity between proteins Px
and Py is defined by the maximum number of index levels
from the top shared by Px and Py. The smaller the value of
function similarity, the broader is the functional category
shared by the two proteins. The details can be found in
Chen et al. [41].

For protein interaction prediction on numerical PPI data,
we use root-mean-square error (RMSE) to measure the difference between the observed probability values and the
predicted probability values:
