The RAD51 and DMC1 homoeologous genes of
bread wheat: cloning, molecular characterization
and expression analysis

Abstract
Background: Meiotic recombination in eukaryotes requires two homologues of the E. coli RecA proteins: Rad51
and Dmc1. Both proteins play important roles in the binding of single stranded DNA, homology search, strand
invasion and strand exchange. Meiotic recombination has been well studied in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and the
orthologues of RAD51 and DMC1 have been characterized. However genetic analysis of the RAD51 and DMC1
genes in bread wheat has been hampered due to the absence of complete sequence information and because of
the existence of multiple copies of each gene in the hexaploid wheat genome.
Findings: In this study we have identified that TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues are located on group 7 and
group 5 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat, respectively. Comparative sequence analysis of cDNA derived from the
TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues revealed limited sequence divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino
acid level. Indeed, comparisons between the predicted amino acid sequences of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 and those
of other eukaryotes reveal a high degree of evolutionary conservation. Despite the high degree of sequence
conservation at the nucleotide level, genome-specific primers for cDNAs of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 were developed
to evaluate expression patterns of individual homoeologues during meiosis. QRT-PCR analysis showed that
expression of the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues was largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with
elevated levels observed during the stages of prophase I when meiotic recombination occurs. All three
homoeologues of both strand-exchange proteins (TaRAD51 and TaDMC1) are expressed in wheat.
Conclusions: Bread wheat contains three expressed copies of each of the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues.
While differences were detected between the three cDNA homoeologues of TaRAD51 as well as the three
homoeologues of TaDMC1, it is unlikely that the predicted amino acid substitutions would have an effect on the
protein structure, based on our three-dimensional structure prediction analyses. There are differences in the levels
of expression of the three homoeologues of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 as determined by QRT-PCR and if these
differences are reflected at the protein level, bread wheat may be more dependent upon a particular
homoeologue to achieve full fertility than all three equally.

Background
Meiosis is central to all sexually reproducing living organisms and is a highly conserved process. During meiosis a
single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds
of cell division resulting in the formation of four daughter
cells each having half the chromosome number of the parent. Recombination at meiosis is pivotal not only for

creating genetic diversity through crossing-over but also
has a mechanistic role ensuring physical connections in
the form of chiasmata that allow the chromosomes to segregate accurately during the first division of meiosis. Bacterial RecA was the first gene to be cloned from E. coli
that was shown to play an important role in recombination
[1,2]. Meiotic recombination in eukaryotic cells
generally requires two homologues of the E. coli RecA protein - Rad51 and Dmc1 - that were first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [3,4]. The Rad51 protein forms a
nucleofilament with ATP-dependant strand-exchange

activity, which has been shown to have roles in meiosis,
homologous recombination and DSB repair [5]. Dmc1 also
forms a nucleofilament in cooperation with Rad51 and is
involved in generating hybrid joint molecules specifically
in meiosis [3]. The RAD51 gene exists as a single copy in
tomato and Arabidopsis, while maize and Physcomitrella
patens have two copies each [6-11]. The DMC1 gene
sequences have been reported only in a few plant species.
While the Arabidopsis genome contains one copy of the
DMC1 gene [12], rice has two copies, OsDMC1A and
OsDMC1B, which are located on chromosomes 12 and 11,
respectively, most likely produced by chromosomal duplication [13].
Common wheat or bread wheat is an allohexaploid
composed of three genomes, each consisting of seven
chromosomes (AABBDD; 2n = 6x = 42). Information on
the genes and gene homoeologues of RAD51 and DMC1
in bread wheat is limited, primarily due to the added
complexity of polyploidy. Given that RAD51 and DMC1
gene orthologues are reported to be involved in meiotic
recombination in other cereal species and also the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we have investigated
their orthologues in bread wheat. A previous study on
meiotic recombination genes in wheat reported the existence of only one copy of TaDMC1 gene [GenBank
accession number EU915561] and two copies of
TaRAD51 gene - TaRAD51A1 [GenBank accession
number EU915557] and TaRAD51A2 [GenBank accession number EU915558] [14]. We report here for the
first time the existence of three homoeologous copies of
the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 genes, their genomic location and expression patterns in inflorescence and vegetative tissues in bread wheat. These observations in the
Chinese Spring wheat do not completely agree with the
results reported earlier [14] and these apparent differences are discussed in this paper.

Methods
Plant materials and DNA isolation

Wild type hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum c.v Highbury) and Nullisomic-Tetrasomic (NT) wheat stocks
(Triticum aestivum c.v Chinese Spring) were kindly provided by Prof John Snape and Dr Steve Reader at the
John Innes Centre (Norwich, UK). The NT stocks, originally developed by Sears [15], were used for chromosomal
assignment of the putative homoeologous genes. Lines
Nullisomic for genome A chromosomes were tetrasomics
either for B or D chromosomes, lines Nullisomic for genome B chromosomes were tetrasomics either for A or D
chromosomes and Nullisomic for genome D chromosomes were tetrasomics either for A or B chromosomes.
Seeds of wheat were first germinated on moistened filter papers in Petri dishes incubated at 20°C in a growth
chamber. When coleoptile length had reached ~1 cm,

Page 2 of 11

seedlings were transplanted to 13 cm pots containing
John Innes No. 3 compost and grown under standard
glasshouse conditions. Total genomic DNA was
extracted from young leaf tissue (2 - 4 weeks post emergence) using the GenElute™ Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma Aldrich) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA extraction and first strand cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was isolated from the following tissues: root
tips (RT, 14 days after germination), mature leaf (L) and
immature inflorescence material (I). In addition, meiotically staged anthers were collected for RNA extraction
from anther (microspore) tissues. Stages included are:
pre-meiosis (PM), leptotene to pachytene (LP), diplotene
to anaphase I (DA), telophase I to telophase II (TT),
tetrads (T) and immature pollen (IP). Extractions used
Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The isolated RNA was treated with
RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega) to remove any residual genomic DNA according to the manufacturers’
instructions and first strand cDNA was synthesized
using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)
using standard methods.
Isolation of full-length cDNA sequences of wheat RAD51
and DMC1 genes

Wheat RAD51 and DMC1 genes had not been reported at
the start of this research, so in order to isolate the wheat
RAD51 cDNA sequence, the rice OsRAD51A1 cDNA
sequence [Gen Bank accession number ABO8O261.2] was
retrieved from the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genbank) and used to design a total of four
primer sets to amplify different sized fragments covering
the entire rice cDNA sequence, including 3′ and 5′ UTR
sequences (Table 1). These were then used in RT-PCR
using wheat immature inflorescence cDNA as the template. The RT-PCR products were cloned, sequenced and
aligned into contigs to obtain the full-length TaRAD51
cDNA. To isolate the full-length wheat DMC1 cDNA
sequences, primers were designed to the partial DMC1
cDNA sequence of wheat [GenBank accession number
DQ247845] and 3′ and 5′ RACE was performed. To generate TaDMC1 3′ ends, mRNA was reverse transcribed
using Oligo(dT18 ) primer (Table 1). After first strand
cDNA synthesis, the 3′ region of the TaDMC1 cDNA was
amplified with DGSP1 and the 3′ NotI anchor primer
(Table 1) in the first PCR, and then a nested PCR was
done with DGSP2 in combination with the NotI anchor
primer (Table 1). 5′-RACE to generate TaDMC1 5′ ends
was carried out using a 5′RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR products were obtained
with AAP or AUAP primers (provided in the kit) and gene

specific primers (Table 1). The RT-PCR products were
cloned, sequenced and aligned into contigs to obtain the
full-length TaDMC1 cDNA.
Generation of Genome-specific primers for TaRAD51 and
TaDMC1 using intron sequences

OsRAD51A1 [GenBank accession number ABO8O261]
and OsDMC1A [GenBank accession number AB079873]
cDNA sequences were used to predict the exon/intron
boundaries of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1, respectively.
Once the boundaries were identified, exon-anchored primers that were expected to amplify products spanning
two or three introns were designed (Table 1). Multiple
alignment of sequences obtained from the TaRAD51
and TaDMC1 cDNA exon-anchored primers on Chinese
Spring genomic DNA identified three distinct groups of
sequences for each gene with respect to the intronic
sequences in bread wheat (data not shown). Putative
primers that were expected to amplify a particular
homoeologue were designed based on the sequence
polymorphisms detected and were coupled with a conserved exon-anchored primer in a PCR reaction containing genomic DNA from Chinese Spring and the
appropriate nulli-tetrasomic stocks as templates.

[18]. SIFT is a program which predicts whether an
amino acid substitution in the protein affects its protein
function or not. SIFT assumes that important amino
acids will be conserved in the protein family and so
changes at well-conserved positions tend to be predicted
as deleterious. SIFT score ranges from 0 to 1. The
amino acid substitution is predicted deleterious if the
score is ≤ 0.05 and tolerated if the score is > 0.05. This
approach can only give an indication of potential
changes to function through mutation.
Phylogenetic analysis

The alignment of nucleotide sequences and subsequent
selection of best-fit molecular evolution model was performed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis
(MEGA) software (version 5.0) [19]. The construction of
a phylogenetic tree was performed under maximum
likelihood (ML) using RAxML version 7.2.6 [20] on the
CIPRES portal [21] with the following parameters:
nucleotide search using the GTR + G model, random
seed for initial parsimony inference, rapid bootstrapping
with automatic bootstopping function (frequency criterion) followed by the final ML search.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR

Generation of Genome-specific primers for TaRAD51 and
TaDMC1 sequences at the exon level

Highbury spikelet cDNA was amplified using primers
that generate full-length copies of the TaRAD51 and
TaDMC1 genes. A major amplification band, approximately 1.5 kb was obtained with both sets of primers. In
the absence of differentially sized fragments, genomespecific primers for TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 cDNA
homoeologues were designed based on sequence polymorphisms identified at the 3′ UTRs for TaRAD51
cDNA homoeologues and at the 5′ UTRs for the
TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues and were paired with a
conserved gene primer (Table 1). The genome specificity
of the primers was tested using appropriate nulli-tetrasomic stocks as templates.
Comparative amino acid sequence analysis and 3D
protein modelling

Comparative amino acid sequence analysis was undertaken
using the ClustalW tool of European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2). The amino
acid sequences were processed using the Swiss model
workspace (version 8.05, 2009) [16]. The computed outputs
were then used to predict the 3D protein structures using
Swiss-Pdb Viewer (DeepView; Version 4.0, 2009) [17].
SIFT (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant) analysis

The potential impact of amino-acid changes on the final
protein structure were assessed with the SIFT program

Harvesting and staging of meiotic anthers for QRT-PCR
was performed from immature wheat spikes [22]. Harvested material was immediately frozen and stored at
-80°C. Eight independent QRT-PCR amplifications were
made for the following tissues: PM, LP, DA, TT, T, IP,
L and RT. QRT-PCR was performed in triplicates using
wheat Tubulin (Table 1) as an internal standard in a
total volume of 12 μl reaction that contained 6 μl of
Brilliant® SYBR® Green (Qiagen), 50 ng cDNA and 1 μl
of an equal mix of forward and reverse gene specific primers (Table 1). The reaction conditions for QRT-PCR
were as follows: 15 min at 95°C followed by 45 cycles of
30 s at 95°C, 30 s at gene specific annealing temperature
and 30 s at 72°C. Primer sequences and annealing temperatures are given in Table 1.
Q-PCR amplification reactions were performed in the
LightCycler® 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science,
UK) using Brilliant® SYBR® Green (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Accession numbers

The cDNA sequences of the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1
homoeologues were deposited in GenBank at NCBI
[GenBank accession numbers FJ594479, FJ594480 and
FJ594481 for TacRAD51-7A, TacRAD51-7B and
TacRAD51-7D homoeologues, respectively and
FJ594476, FJ594477 and FJ594478 for TacDMC1-5A,
TacDMC1-5B and TacDMC1-5D homoeologues,
respectively)].

Results and Discussion
Isolation and genome localization of RAD51 and DMC1
gene homoeologous sequences of hexaploid wheat

’Highbury’ wheat spikelet cDNA amplifications resulted
in the isolation of the full-length RAD51 and DMC1
cDNA sequences from hexaploid wheat (see methods). In
order to localize the isolated RAD51 and DMC1 cDNA
sequences on hexaploid wheat, genome specific primers
were developed in intronic regions and the genome specificity was confirmed using nulli-tetrasomic analysis.
The analysis revealed that the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1
sequences were located on group 7 and group 5 chromosomes, respectively, with a copy in each of the A, B and
D genomes (Figure 1). Exon specific genome specific primers were developed based on sequence polymorphisms
identified (Figure 2) and the genome specificity was confirmed using group 7 and group 5 nulli-tetrasomics of
wheat (Figure 3). Later full-length cDNA sequences of
the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues were isolated
using these primers and the sequences were submitted to
NCBI database. The locations of TaRAD51 homoeologues cloned here contrast with a previous report [14] in
bread wheat that TaRAD51 exists as two paralogues TaRAD51A1 and TaRAD51A2 on group 7.
TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues are highly
conserved at the amino acid level

Sequence alignment of the TaRAD51 cDNA homoeologues at nucleotide and amino acid level revealed 97% and
99% identity respectively. Two of the TaRAD51 cDNA

Page 5 of 11

homoeologues (TaRAD51-7A and -7B) have a continuous
ORF of 1032 bp, capable of encoding a protein of 343
amino acids and the TaRAD51-7D ORF has a deletion of
three nucleotides at the N-terminal end, thus putatively
encoding a predicted protein of 342 amino acids residues.
Further analysis of the three translated TaRAD51 cDNA
homoeologues revealed that this leads to the expected
deletion of one amino acid at position 17 corresponding
to an ‘E’ residue (Glutamic acid) and single amino acid
substitutions are also expected between the three homoeologues at positions 4 (A, compared with B&D), 31 (A&B,
compared with D) and 115 (A&D, compared with B) (Figure 4a). SIFT predictions suggested that the amino acid
substitutions are not expected to affect protein 3D structure for the three cDNA homoeologues of TaRAD51 (Figure 4b). We have also found that the previously reported
[14]TaRAD51A1 is identical to the TaRAD51-7D homoeologue isolated here and that the reported TaRAD51A2
sequence appears to be a truncated version of the
TaRAD51-7A homoeologue albeit with a few amino acid
differences at the truncated end (listed in Additional file
1). However the paralogous nature of the reported TaRAD51A1/A2 [14] was not observed in this study. This supports the idea that there is only one copy of TaRAD51 per
haploid wheat genome, at least for the wheat genotype studied here. The predicted 3D homoeologue overlays superimposed onto each other TaRad51 revealed there is a high
level of predicted conservation for secondary and tertiary
structures (Figure 4c). The only noticeable structural
dissimilarity observed between the three cDNA

positions 114 (A&D, compared with B), 166 (A&B compared with D), 214 (A&B compared with D), 310 (A,
compared with B&D) and 316 (A&B, compared with D);
no insertions or deletions were detected (Figure 5a).
SIFT predictions for the three translated homoeologues
of TaDMC1 suggested that the amino acid substitutions
are not expected to affect protein secondary and tertiary
structure (Figure 5b). Multiple alignment of the amino
acid sequence of the three translated homoeologues of
TaDMC1 with the previously reported TaDMC1 cDNA
sequence [14] revealed that the reported TaDMC1 is
the D genome homoeologue (data not shown). The predicted 3D overlays for the translated TaDMC1 homoeologues superimposed onto each other revealed very high
levels of conservation for secondary and tertiary structures (Figure 5c).

examine the predicted identity of the TaRAD51 and
TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues, previously annotated
database entries (listed in Additional file 2) were used to
construct a phylogenetic tree. The tree identified three
main branches, with Rad51 and Dmc1 members clustered into two separate branches with Rad51B, Rad51C,
Rad51D, Xrcc2 and Xrcc3 clustered into a third (Figure
6). This is consistent with the reports that Rad51 and
Dmc1 are paralogues and likely descendants of the
ancestral RecA gene [23]. As expected, the three cDNA
homoeologues of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 clustered
together and fall into their respective branches. The
strongest similarity was found between the nucleotide
sequences of wheat and rice RAD51 and DMC1. This
provides strong evidence that the cDNA homoeologues
isolated in this study are the true orthologues of the rice
RAD51 and DMC1 genes.
This study also found that there was only one copy of
TaRAD51 per haploid genome of wheat in contrast to
two copies of the RAD51 gene reported in rice
(OsRAD51A1/A2; rice chromosomes 11 and 12) and
maize (ZmRAD51A1/A2; maize chromosomes 7 and 8)
[8,13]. The presence of two RAD51 copies in rice and

maize and only one copy of RAD51 per genome in
wheat may argue for gene loss in the ancestors of
wheat. This conclusion is supported by the phylogenetic
tree (Figure 6). The genomes of rice and maize contain
both products of a predicted earlier gene duplication
before divergence of the two species i.e RAD51A1 and
RAD51A2, while all three of the RAD51 genes in wheat
appear to be homologues of the RAD51A2 gene, suggesting that the RAD51A1 lineage has been lost in bread
wheat. There are also two versions of the DMC1 gene
in rice and maize and only one in the haploid wheat
genome. This may have a similar origin, but the greater
conservation of DMC1 in these species makes an assessment more difficult and the presence of two copies may
simply reflect a local duplication of R11 and R12 in rice
and the fact that maize is an ancient tetraploid. In both

case, it is worth noting that DMC1 homologues are
more highly conserved than the RAD51 homologues,
arguing for a higher level of selective pressure preventing mutation or a more recent duplication event.
All homoeologues of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 genes were
highly expressed during prophase I of meiosis

The QRT-PCR analysis of TaRAD51 cDNA homoeologues indicated that all the three homoeologues were
expressed in both vegetative and meiotic tissues (Figure
7a). Comparatively higher expression levels were
observed in meiotic stages than vegetative tissues (Figure 7a, stages PM to TT). There is a sharp drop in
expression of the TaRAD51 cDNA homoeologue transcripts at the end of Meiosis I but then expression
increases again at the Tetrad stage. There was however

of genome-specific expression in a range of tissues
through Q-PCR. The same primers could be used to
screen mutation and deletion stocks of wheat to detect
loss-of-function mutations, allowing in planta characterisation of the effect of these mutations on meiosis.

differences in expression level among the three cDNA
homoeologues, particularly during meiotic stages. This
may suggest that the individual homoeologues contribute to differing extents in meiotic recombination. The
expression level of TaRAD51-7B was significantly higher
than TaRAD51-7A and TaRAD51-7D in all meiotic
stages suggesting it could be the version with the greatest role in meiosis.
QRT-PCR analysis of TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues
indicated that all three homoeologues were expressed in
both vegetative and meiotic tissues (Figure 7b). However
higher expression levels were found in meiotic stages
(Figure 7b, stages PM to TT) compared to non-meiotic
tissues and we observed an increase in expression of all
three TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues during the Tetrad
stage. There were differences in the expression levels
among all three cDNA homoeologues of TaDMC1 in
the observed tissues, which suggests that they could
contribute to differing extents in meiotic recombination.
Both TaDMC1-5B and TaDMC1-5D homoeologues
were highly expressed in all meiotic stages, although not
the Tetrad stage, compared to the transcript level of
TaDMC1-5A suggesting they could be the versions with
the greatest role in meiosis.
Overall, we have reported the cloning and characterisation of the hexaploid wheat versions of the major strandexchange proteins DMC1 and RAD51. Primer tests have
been developed which are specific to individual homoeologues and these have been used to characterise the levels
