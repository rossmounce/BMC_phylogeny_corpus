Abstract
Background: The Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase/17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10
(ABAD/HSD10) is an enzyme involved in pivotal metabolic processes and in the mitochondrial dysfunction
seen in the Alzheimer's disease. Here we use comparative genomic analyses to study the evolution of the
HADH2 gene encoding ABAD/HSD10 across several eukaryotic species.
Results: Both vertebrate and nematode HADH2 genes showed a six-exon/five-intron organization while
those of the insects had a reduced and varied number of exons (two to three). Eutherian mammal HADH2
genes revealed some highly conserved noncoding regions, which may indicate the presence of functional
elements, namely in the upstream region about 1 kb of the transcription start site and in the first part of
intron 1. These regions were also conserved between Tetraodon and Fugu fishes. We identified a
conserved alternative splicing event between human and dog, which have a nine amino acid deletion,
causing the removal of the strand βF. This strand is one of the seven strands that compose the core βsheet of the Rossman fold dinucleotide-binding motif characteristic of the short chain dehydrogenase/
reductase (SDR) family members. However, the fact that the substrate binding cleft residues are retained
and the existence of a shared variant between human and dog suggest that it might be functional. Molecular
adaptation analyses across eutherian mammal orthologues revealed the existence of sites under positive
selection, some of which being localized in the substrate-binding cleft and in the insertion 1 region on loop
D (an important region for the Aβ-binding to the enzyme). Interestingly, a higher than expected number
of nonsynonymous substitutions were observed between human/chimpanzee and orangutan, with six out
of the seven amino acid replacements being under molecular adaptation (including three in loop D and one
in the substrate binding loop).
Conclusion: Our study revealed that HADH2 genes maintained a reasonable conserved organization
across a large evolutionary distance. The conserved noncoding regions identified among mammals and
between pufferfishes, the evidence of an alternative splicing variant conserved between human and dog,
and the detection of positive selection across eutherian mammals, may be of importance for further
research on ABAD/HSD10 function and its implication in the Alzheimer's disease.

Background
The enzyme Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase/17βhydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 (ABAD/HSD10)
belongs to short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR)
family and its distinct features include the capacity to bind
amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) [1] and the ability to use a
broad array of substrates, encompassing 3-hydroxyacylCoA derivatives, steroids, alcohols, and β-hydroxybutyrate [2-6]. ABAD/HSD10 has function in the mitochondria and is expressed in several tissues, including brain,
liver and gonads [5]. The broad expression pattern
together with the multiple substrate specificities enables
the enzyme to participate in several metabolic processes
(reviewed in [7]), namely, the oxidation of fatty acids and
branched-chain amino acids [6,8], sex steroids metabolism in gonads [9,10] and oxidation of steroid modulators
of GABAA receptors in brain [11].
ABAD/HSD10 was found to bind Aβ in a yeast-two hybrid
screen against human brain and HeLa cDNA libraries [1].
Subsequently, various studies [12,13] provided evidence
that ABAD/HSD10 can mediate the cytotoxic effects of Aβ
in the mitochondrial compartment, thus contributing to
the mitochondrial dysfunction seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (reviewed in [14]). The structure determination
of human ABAD/HSD10 in complex with Aβ [12]
revealed that the enzyme's loop D is the binding site of
Aβ, and that binding of Aβ to ABAD/HSD10 leads to distortion of the ABAD/HSD10 structure, possibly inhibiting
its enzymatic activity. Transgenic mice overexpressing
ABAD/HSD10 in an Aβ-rich environment displayed neuronal oxidative stress, cell death and accelerated decline in
spatial learning and memory [12,13]. In addition, ABAD/
HSD10 expression was reported to be enhanced in brains
from patients with AD when compared with brains from
non-demented age-matched controls [12,13].
Although ABAD/HSD10 is an enzyme with function in
the mitochondria it is encoded by a nuclear gene termed
HADH2 (official name). The human HADH2 gene,
mapped at chromosome Xp11.2, consists of six exons and
five introns [8] and encodes a protein with 261 amino
acids. The three-dimensional structure of ABAD/HSD10
has been determined with great resolution [2,15]. The
enzyme has a homotetrameric structure, with each subunit containing a Rossman fold dinucleotide-binding
motif, composed of a core β-sheet of seven parallel strands
flanked by six α-helices, which is involved in the interaction with the cofactor (NAD). The C-terminal portion of
the enzyme is involved in substrate binding and harbors
the Ser/Lys/Tyr catalytic triad characteristic of the SDR
family members [16].
Here we performed a thorough comparative genomic
analysis of HADH2 genes from 21 organisms, including

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/202

several species of mammals, amphibians, fishes, insects
and nematodes. We provide insights into the evolution of
such HADH2 genes, namely its genomic organization,
patterns of sequence conservation, alternative splicing
variants and phylogenetic relationships. Moreover, we
provide evidence suggesting signatures of positive selection across eutherian mammal ABAD/HSD10 proteins,
which may be of importance for more applied biomedical
research on enzyme function and its implication in the
Alzheimer's disease.

Results
Cross-species comparison of HADH2 gene organization
Vertebrate HADH2 genes showed a six-exon/five-intron
organization, with the exon lengths and the localization
of the exon/intron boundaries being highly conserved
(Figure 1). The nematode genes also exhibited a similar
gene organization, but the exon/intron boundaries
involving the last three exons were in a different position
relatively to the vertebrate orthologues and exon 2 contained a six nucleotide (two codons) deletion. Insects
showed, however, a distinct HADH2 gene organization
with a reduced and varied number of exons: two in the
mosquito and fruitfly, and three in the honeybee. The
length of the coding sequences was similar across the species analysed, ranging from 765 (fruitfly and mosquito) to
783 bp (mammals). In general, HADH2 genes were less
than 3.20 Kb long (Table 1; Figure 1), with most of its
introns shorter than 500 bp. The zebrafish gene was, however, much larger (9.38 Kb), which resulted from its four
larger introns (ranging from 1.058 to 3.818 bp; Figure 1).
A high proportion of repeats in the zebrafish intron 2
accounted for its notably larger size (see Additional file 1),
but few or no repeats were found in the other introns. In
eutherian mammals, HADH2 genes were very similar in
size (2.16–3.17 Kb, Table 1). The main differences were
related with the different accumulation of repeats in
introns (see Additional file 1, Figure 1). SINEs of different
sub-families occupied a moderate percentage of intron 2
in primates and rodents and of intron 5 in cat. Among
invertebrates, C. elegans had the largest HADH2 gene. This
is greatly related with the larger size of C. elegans introns 2
and 4, apparently resulting from an accumulation of DNA
transposons (see Additional file 1).

The gene overall GC content was similar among the eutherian mammals (48–55%), but substantially heterogeneous among fishes (33–57%), insects (18–60%) and
nematodes (34–43%). The GC content of third-codon
position (GC3) showed a high heterogeneity across
HADH2 genes, while GC content in the first (GC1) and
second-codon (GC2) positions were more homogeneous.
Previously, it was reported that in most vertebrate
genomes, GC3 levels are correlated with the GC level of
the isochore region containing the gene [17,18]. Accord-

ingly, the vertebrate HADH2 genes with high GC3 values
should probably be localized in GC-rich isochores, which
also preferentially allow the accumulation of SINE
repeats. Conversely, the comparatively low GC3 values
observed in rodents, amphibians and zebrafish HADH2
genes should probably reflect a shift toward GC-poorer
regions. Interestingly, honeybee HADH2 gene was
remarkably AT-biased, which was related both to the very
low GC3 content and the extreme predominance of ATrich repeats in its introns (Additional file 1).
Eutherian mammals HADH2 genes were localized in the
X chromosome (Table 1), confirming the known high
synteny conservation of eutherian X chromosomes [19].
Tetraodon HADH2 gene was localized on chromosome 9,
which was previously reported to show a high synteny
with human Xp11.2 region [20]. Zebrafish HADH2 gene
was, however, localized on chromosome 23, which has a
very low synteny either with human chromosome X or
with Tetraodon chromosome 9 [21].

The evaluation of mRNA RefSeq databases at NCBI
revealed the existence of an alternative spliced variant,
with 252 amino acids (variant 2), both in human
(NM_001037811) and dog (XN_859362). This variant is
generated through the use of a different 5' splice site of
intron 5, localized 27 nucleotides upstream of the normal
donor splice site, resulting in a nine amino acids deletion
(residues 190–198) without disrupting the reading frame
(splicing pathway A in Figure 2). Such deletion causes the
removal of strand βF (residues 191–198) which, together
with other six strands, compose the core β-sheet of the
Rossmann fold dinucleotide-binding motif (Figure 4).
Typically, HADH2 introns from the species analysed contained the canonical GT and AG dinucleotides in the
donor and acceptor splice sites, respectively. However,
while the human alternative donor splice site contained a
GT dinucleotide, a rare GC dinucleotide was present in the
dog alternative donor splice site (Figure 2). The GC-AG
splice sites are the major non-canonical splice sites, comprise 0.5–1% of mammalian splice sites and, like the GT-

Alternative splicing events identified in the human and dog HADH2 genes
Alternative splicing events identified in the human and dog HADH2 genes. A) Schematic illustration of the splicing
pathways of human and dog HADH2 genes. The typical exon-intron organization of human and dog HADH2 genes is shown.
Exons (E), which are of same lengths in human and dog genes, are represented by coloured boxes and shown to scale (bar =
200 bp). Introns and UTR regions are schematized by unscaled lines and boxes with black streaks, respectively. Intron phases
are indicated by numbers above the lines. Alternative splicing (AS) pathway A, identified in human and dog, involves utilization
of an alternative donor splice site (ss) in the exon 5, resulting in a nine amino acid deletion. The sequences of human and dog
intron 5 splice sites (ss) and of the alternative donor splice site are shown. The conserved nucleotides that identify the U2-type
consensus sequences for the GT splice donor site (MAGGTRAGT), GC splice donor site (MAGGCAAGT) and acceptor
splice site (NCAGGT) are in red, violet, and green. Alternative splicing (AS) pathway B, identified in dog, involves the skipping
of exon 5 which, due to the different phase of introns 4 and 5, leads to the appearance of an earlier stop codon (TGA) in the
exon 6, resulting in the replacement of the last 92 amino acids by seven new ones. B) Amino acid sequences of the dog ABAD/
HSD10 and variants produced by AS. The nine amino acids deleted in the variant 2 (252 amino acids) are in red (The nine
amino acids deleted in the human variant 2 homologue are identical). The seven new amino acids in the variant 3 are in blue.

Conservation of the human and dog alternative donor splice site in the exon 5 of the other eutherian mammals
Conservation of the human and dog alternative donor splice site in the exon 5 of the other eutherian mammals. The last 30 nucleotides (in uppercase) of exon 5 and the first 10 nucleotides (in lowercase) of intron 5 are given. The
canonical GT dinucleotides in the common donor splice site of intron 5 are in blue while the canonical GT and non-canonical
GC dinucleotides in the alternative donor splice site are in red.

AG splice sites, are also processed by the standard U2-type
spliceosome [22,23]. Both human and dog alternative
donor splice sites match poorly the known mammalian
splice-sites consensus sequences [24] than the normal
intron 5 donor splice sites. The dog and human normal
intron 5 donor splice sites match the mammalian U2dependent consensus sequence for the GT splice site
(MAGGTRAGT) in six out of nine residues while the
human alternative 5'-splice site matches only five residues. Dog alternative donor splice site matches the consensus sequence for the GC splice site (MAGGCAAGT)
only in four out of nine nucleotides (Figure 2). The poor
match of alternative splice sites with splice-site consensus
sequences is not uncommon. In fact, the alternative splicing is usually associated with weak splice signals, and variability in signal strength can act as an underlying
regulatory mechanism [25,26]. The other eutherian mammal genes have highly conserved alternative donor splice
sites with those of dog and human (Figure 3), suggesting
that they might also potentially express a similar alternative splicing variant. In dog, we identified a second alternative splicing variant (XM_859344) with 169 amino
acids (variant 3). It results from skipping exon 5, which
causes a shift of the reading frame, leading to the appearance of a premature stop codon in the exon 6 (splicing
pathway B in Figure 2). The last 92 amino acids are
replaced by seven new ones, resulting in the loss of important functional residues, such as, two residues of the catalytic triad (Tyr168 and Lys172) and the residues (202–
220) comprising the substrate binding loop.

Patterns of nucleotide sequence conservation among
HADH2 genes
The Multipipmaker analysis involving the comparisons
between human and each of the other vertebrate HADH2
genes revealed a reasonable conservation of the coding
regions, especially in the last three exons, while introns
and upstream regions were less or not conserved (Figure
5A). The human and the other primate sequences aligned
along almost their entire lengths, with the region corresponding to the HADH2 gene showing an identity above
96%. Few insertions were detected, with the largest ones
being associated with repetitive DNA. As expected, due to
an increase in phylogenetic distance, the human sequence
was less conserved with those of non-primate eutherian
mammals, especially within noncoding regions. Considering the intronic regions, the overall percent identity was
77.1% for human/dog, 78.8% for human/cat, 76.3% for
human/cow, 71.3% for human/mouse and 68.9% for
human/rat. The lower similarity between human and the
rodent introns, despite mouse and rat being considered
closer to humans than the other non-primate eutherian
mammals [27], likely reflect the higher mutation rate in
the mouse/rat lineage [28]. Conservation between human
and the other vertebrate introns was restricted to small
regions flanking exons.

The comparisons among fish (Figure 5B) revealed that
conservation between pufferfishes and zebrafish
sequences was largely limited to coding regions and to a
microRNA (family let-7) positioned upstream of the
HADH2 gene, reflecting the deep divergence of the Euteleostei (110–160 million years; Myr) [29]. Despite the
much shorter evolutionary distance separating Fugu and
Tetraodon (18–30 Myr) [30], the intron identity between

the two pufferfishes (67.7%) was lower than the intron
identity between human and each of the other non-primate eutherian mammals (> 70 Myr divergence) [31].
This might be related with the reported high neutral
nucleotide substitution rate between Fugu and Tetraodon,
which was shown to be greater than that between human
and mouse [30]. C. elegans and C. briggsae HADH2 genes

were substantially conserved in coding regions but not in
the introns (Figure 5C), which is supported by previous
inferences of the reduced conservation of noncoding
sequences between the genomes of these nematodes, due
to their large divergence (~100 Myr) [32]. Insect HADH2
genes were conserved only in HADH2 coding regions. The
divergent organization of insect HADH2 genes and the

upstream region, the portion at about 1 kb of the transcription start site showed an increase in conservation,
with the alignment from the positions 897 bp to 1239 bp
(human sequence) exhibiting > 73% identity for human/
eutherian mammals. The upstream regions of Tetraodon
and Fugu also displayed highly conserved alignments, in
particular one, positioned very close to the miRNA, with
88% identity along 126 bp. Considering intronic regions,
the first part of intron 1 contained the largest (130 bp)
gap-free alignment conserved (72–73% with the human

sequence) between human, carnivores and cow, which
also overlapped with some shorter human/rodent gapfree alignments with ≥70% identity. Interestingly, the
largest conserved gap-free alignment (72% identity along
89 bp) between Tetraodon and Fugu introns was also in
the beginning of pufferfishes intron 1. Among eutherian
mammals, regions of high conservation were also
detected in the other introns. In the smaller intron 4, the
last 50 bp alignment showed an identity above 75% for all
human/eutherian mammal comparisons. The intron 5,

similar in human and dog, showed an identity above 70%

above 70% in the human/eutherian mammal comparisons.
Phylogenetic analyses
In the 783 bp alignment of the HADH2 coding region
sequences, 549 nucleotides were variable and 489 were
phylogenetically informative (PI). Considering PI sites,
134 (27.4%) were at first-codon position, 103 (21.1%) at
second-codon position and 252 (51.5%) at third-codon
position. However, as third-codon positions showed a significant base compositional bias and nucleotide saturation, they were excluded from phylogenetic analyses.
Indeed, the saturation plots performed for each codonposition showed that third-codon position transitions
and transversions start to saturate at different distances
(Figure 6), while no significant saturation was observed at
the first and second-codon positions (results not shown).
It must be noted that the slight third-codon position transitions saturation observed for eutherian mammals (red
dots in figure 6) is ascribed to the comparisons involving
mouse and rat HADH2 sequences, which might be due to
the recognized higher nucleotide substitution rate within
these rodent species [28]. The base compositional bias at
third-codon position reflected the extensive GC3 variation among species (Table 1), thus, accounting for 10

non-mammalian sequences rejecting the Tree-puzzle
homogeneity chi-square test. By contrast, all sequences
passed the chi-square test on second-codon positions
while only honeybee sequence failed the test on firstcodon positions. Recombination and gene conversion
events, which can also interfere with phylogenetic analysis, were not detected across HADH2 genes.
ML and Bayesian trees showed identical topologies (Figure 7). Both trees placed amphibians and fishes HADH2
genes in a monophyletic clade sister to the mammal clade,
not reproducing the assumed topology placing amphibians closer to amniotes than fishes. The great divergence
between honeybee and diptera (fruitfly and mosquito)
HADH2 genes, as evidenced by their very dissimilar GC
contents, might have precluded their placement in a single clade corresponding to insects. The phylogenetic relationships for mammal HADH2 genes are well within the
known phylogeny of mammals [27], placing the rodents
and primates as sister groups (one clade) and the artiodactyls (pig and cow) and carnivores (dog and cat) as sister
groups in another clade. The clade containing artiodactyls
and carnivores received, however, a low BPP and BS values (Figure 7). Nevertheless, it is remarkable to realize the
high degree of congruence between the phylogeny of the
HADH2 genes and the assumed eukaryotic phylogenetic
tree, given the shorter size of the HADH2 sequences (522

years). Indeed, in general, reliable vertebrate and invertebrate phylogenetic trees are constructed based on larger
data sets of concatenated genes because this allows
increasing the number of PI sites (e.g. [27]).
Patterns of ABAD/HSD10 amino acid sequence
conservation
ABAD/HSD10 amino acid sequences showed a high conservation among mammals (72–100%), amphibians
(96%), fishes (86–95%), nematodes (95%), but slightly
less among insects (63–82%). The ABAD/HSD10 amino
acid identity between human and the other species (see
Additional file 2) ranged from 59% (with nematodes) to
100% (with chimpanzee). Comparisons between human
and each of the species group orthologues showed that
the C-terminal region, where is localized most of the residues belonging to the substrate binding cleft and involved
in subunit association [2,15], was clearly more conserved
than the N-terminal region (Figure 8). The catalytic triad
(Ser155, Tyr168 and Lys172), characteristic of the SDR
family members, and the surrounding residues, were
highly conserved. The substrate binding loop (residues
202–220), was found to be slightly less conserved. As in
other SDR enzymes, the ABAD/HSD10 substrate binding
loop is a mobile region, which may undergo conformational changes upon substrate binding [2]. A distinct feature of ABAD/HSD10 is the presence of two insertion
regions (insertion 1 = residues 100–110; insertion 2 = residues 140–150), absent in the other SDRs. Insertion 1,
which is localized in loop LD (residues 95–113), recently
suggested to be the binding site for Aβ [12], exhibited a

smaller degree of conservation relatively to insertion 2.
Both insertions were also previously suggested to support
the binding of CoA substrates [2]
Adaptative selection on eutherian mammal ABAD/HSD10
proteins
At the gene-level approach, comparisons between site
models M1a/M2a provided no significant evidence of
selection in eutherian mammals. The model M8 fitted the
data better than model M7, but the LRT comparing the
two models was not significant (P > 0.05), with the BEB
approach identifying 11 positively selected sites with posterior probabilities well below the 95% cutoff (Table 2).
To test for variable ω ratios among lineages, the one ratio
model was compared with the free ratio model. Although
the free-ratio model fitted the data non significantly better
than model M0 (P > 0.05, Table 2), it predicted variable ω
values among branches, assigning a ω below 1 to nearly
all branches, excepting to the branch separating human
and chimpanzee from orangutan. The two-ratio model
applied to this branch was significantly better than the
model M0, indicating that the ω for the branch leading to
the human and chimpanzee was significantly different
than that found in the other eutherian branches of the
tree.

At the protein-level approach, we identified 36 ABAD/
HSD10 amino acid sites showing properties under positive destabilizing selection among 28 of the 31 physicochemical properties tested (Table 3). Some of those sites
were localized in particularly important functional
regions. Six were localized in loop D: two (95 and 98) in
a region belonging to the substrate binding site cleft and

four (102, 103, 106 and 108) in the insertion 1 region
(Figure 9). Two sites (202 and 214) belonging to the substrate binding loop were also identified to be under positive destabilizing selection. Among the 36 sites found to
be under adaptative selection, some were detected in
more than one branch of the tree, with the number of sites
as well as the sites found in the referred important functional regions being listed for each eutherian branch in
figure 10. Overall, positive destabilizing selection seems
to have operated in several properties (e.g., properties Pα,
Pβ, Ns, Ca, αc, F, αm αn; see Table 3) related with the conformational and structural aspects of the enzyme. However, properties more likely to induce changes in the
chemical environment (e.g., properties pK', pHi, Pr and P
and Hp; see Table 3) were, overall, less affected by adaptative selection. Site 98, which was detected in a great
number of branches (Figure 10), was the site containing
the highest number of properties influenced by positive
destabilizing selection (Table 3).
The evidence of positive selection, suggested both by the
gene-level and the protein-level approaches in the lineage
separating human/chimpanzee from orangutan reflects
both the particular higher nonsynonymous than synony-

mous substitutions in that lineage and also the fact of
most of the amino acid changes were nonconservative,
thus likely to result in modifications of the physicochemical amino acid properties (Figure 10). Human/chimpanzee and orangutan differed in seven and five (three in case
of chimpanzee) nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, respectively. By contrast, the other eutherian
mammal branches revealed a considerably greater
number of synonymous than nonsynonymous substitutions (results not shown). Among primates, human and
chimpanzee proteins were identical while a higher
number of amino acid differences was observed between
human (and chimpanzee) and orangutan (seven) relatively to the orangutan and macaca (three) (Figure 10).
This suggests that different rates of protein evolution
might have occurred in the evolution of the great ape
ABAD/HSD10 proteins. Of the six positively selected sites
in the branch separating human/chimpanzee from orangutan, three were localized in loop D (98, 106 and 108)
and one in substrate-binding loop (214). It is also interesting to note that in two of the six positive selected sites
(106 and 108), the changes occurring in the human/
chimpanzee sequences were not seen in the other eutherian ABAD/HSD10 proteins, and in three sites (80, 119

Discussion
Here, we present a comprehensive comparative genomic
analysis of the HADH1 gene encoding ABAD/17β-HSD10

across 21 species. HADH2 gene revealed a substantial
conserved organization across a large evolutionary distance: vertebrate and nematode HADH2 genes showed a
six-exon/five-intron gene organization, but insects
showed a reduced and varied number of exons (two to
three). In general, HADH2 genes were less than 3.20 Kb
long (Table 1; Figure 1), with the exception of zebrafish

Page 15 of 20

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:202

gene which was much larger (9.38 Kb). At nucleotide
level, a notable characteristic of HADH2 genes was the
extensive variation in GC3 content.
The reduced conservation in noncoding regions between
human and the non-eutherian vertebrate orthologues,
reinforce previous conclusions that in general, few noncoding functional sequences remain conserved for large
evolutionary distances [33]. Several studies [34-36] have
shown that the conservation in non-coding regions
between human and distant vertebrate species (e.g.,
fishes) is restricted to a subset of genes that are involved
in pivotal biological processes such as development and
transcription regulation. These genes display a high density of conserved elements in their introns and intergenic
regions, which is related with the need to preserve complex and crucial regulatory mechanisms in basic vertebrate
development [36,37]. A recent broad study [38] about
intron conserved elements between human and various
vertebrates, including chicken and fishes, reported that
multispecies conserved noncoding sequences distribution
is not uniform across human introns. Indeed, the longer
introns of the genes involved in development and transcription regulation showed a tendency to accumulate
conserved sequences, while the majority of relatively short
introns (< 9 Kb) displayed none or few conserved elements [38]. In view of the limited conservation between
human and distantly vertebrates, it has been assumed that
for the majority of human genes, comparisons between
multiple, moderately related species might represent a
better strategy to search for potential regulatory elements
[39], although cautious is required as the high degree of
similarity might also reflect low substitutions rates of evolution. It is possible that some of the HADH2 conserved
noncoding sequences, identified in the comparisons
between human and the five moderately related eutherian
mammals might indeed represent regulatory elements,
and thus be good candidates for functional experimental
studies. For instance, the significant sequence similarity
throughout the upstream regions, namely in the region
about 1 kb of the transcription start site, may suggest the
presence of regulatory elements, likely involved in transcription. The first part of intron 1 was found to be highly
conserved among eutherian mammals and interestingly,
it was the highest conserved intronic region between
Tetraodon and Fugu. Given that intron-associated regulatory elements on genes tend to be localized preferentially
in intron 1 [40], such pattern of conservation in eutherian
mammals and in pufferfishes genes suggests that HADH2
intron 1 may potentially contain a regulatory element.
Previous studies [41,42] reported an increase in both exon
and intron conservation in the regions flanking conserved
alternative splice sites. The conserved alternative splicing
event between human and dog HADH2 genes raises the

possibility that some of the conserved intronic regions,
particularly in the introns flanking exon 5 (intron 4 and
5), might reflect the presence of splicing regulatory elements subject to purifying selection. In addition, the high
conservation found in the exons 5 and 6 likely reflect their
importance in coding for residues of the substrate binding
cleft, but it might also be related with the presence of conserved exonic splicing regulatory elements. The conservation of human and dog HADH2 alternative donor splice
sites in other eutherian mammals, suggests they can
potentially also express an identical alternative splicing
variant. However, as previously noted [43,44], conservation of a splice site is not enough to predict the existence
of a variant. Thus, the evaluation of identical alternative
splice variants in the other mammals, including the one
identified solely in dog, will help to further elucidate the
potential functional importance of the conservation of
intronic elements in eutherian HADH2 genes.
Curiously, the two identified alternative splicing events
interfere with the enzyme C-terminal, an important functional region. In the dog variant 3 (169 amino acid), the
last 92 amino acids are replaced by seven new ones. As
this leads to the loss of two residues of the catalytic triad
and of the substrate binding loop residues, likely, the dog
variant 3 is non-functional. The production of non-functional transcripts is not uncommon, with many genes
using that as a mechanism to control the mRNA expression levels [45,46]. In human and dog variant 2, the loss
of strand βF, which is one of the seven strands that compose the core β-sheet of the ABAD/HSD10 Rossmann fold
dinucleotide-binding motif, may have both structural and
functional consequences, as this strand is adjacent to the
region containing the substrate binding loop and is also
involved in the substrate binding [2]. However, the fact
that the substrate binding cleft residues are retained and
the existence of a shared variant between human and dog
suggest that it might be functional. The assessment of the
alternative splice variants functionality, as well as the
mechanisms regulating splice sites selection, and of the
regional expression levels, will be fundamental to determine the implications of the alternative splicing in the
physiological and pathophysiological functions of ABAD/
HSD10. Of special importance is how ABAD/HSD10
alternative splice variants behave in an Aβ-rich environment? In this respect, since the human variant 2 has a normal N-terminal region, which is responsible for the
interaction with Aβ [12], it may still retain the ability to
interact with Aβ. Moreover, the human variant 2 is supported by an mRNA sequence (BC008708) derived from
neuroblastoma cell lines, suggesting that it may be
expressed in the human brain.
At protein level, ABAD/HSD10 showed a high similarity
across the different species, namely in regions compre-

hending the substrate binding cleft and the subunit association, clearly suggesting that ABAD/HSD10 maintained
a substantial structural and functional conservation across
a very large evolutionary distance. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that the rat and fruitfly orthologues
exhibit enzymatic activities similar to those of the human
enzyme [2,47], suggesting that ABAD/HSD10 might have
important functions both in vertebrates and invertebrates.
However, despite being recognized that the broad substrate specificity of ABAD/HSD10 enables it to participate
in several metabolic pathways, the physiological properties of the enzyme are not yet completely understood. In
mammals, ABAD/HSD10 was suggested to have an
important role in metabolism of sex steroid hormones
[10]. It was reported to be expressed in the Leydig cells of
testes from various mammals and the differentiationdependent expression of ABAD/HSD10 in rodent testes
suggested that this enzyme might contribute to protecting
Leydig cells from the effects of estrogens [10]. The great
importance of fruitfly ABAD/HSD10 (termed scully) was
demonstrated by the mutational inactivation of the
enzyme, which induced a lethal phenotype during embryonic and pupal development, with mutants displaying
non-functional gonads, lipid accumulation and aberrant
mitochondria [48]. Human ABAD/HSD10 deficiency
causes a disorder in which the isoleucine degradation is
impaired [6]. Patients with this deficiency show severe
neurological abnormalities, including psychomotor retardation and progressive infantile neurodegeneration. A
beneficial role in the cellular response to metabolic stress
was attributed to the ABAD/HSD10 enzyme, due to its
ability to utilize the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate as a
substrate [49]. ABAD/HSD10 may also be important in
the stabilization of mitochondrial function [14] and in
the maintenance of normal functions of GABAergic neurons [11].
Despite the high degree of conservation among eutherian
ABAD/HSD10 proteins, suggesting strong purifying selection pressures, we investigated signatures of positive selection by using both a gene-level and protein-level
approaches. The failure of the gene-level approach in providing significant evidence of molecular adaptation across
eutherian mammal orthologues, probably reflect the
known lack of power of the used LRTs in detect positive
selection when divergence between sequences in the data
set is low [50]. By contrast, the significant evidence of positive selection provided by the protein level approach
indicates its ability to identify molecular adaptation even
when proteins are highly conserved [51]. An interesting
finding, was the detection of positive selection in important functional regions, in particular in the lineage separating human/chimpanzee from orangutan, which,
contrasting with other eutherian mammal branches, accumulated a higher number of nonsynonymous than syn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/202

onymous substitutions. Of the seven residues differing
between human and orangutan, the protein-level
approach detected six to be under molecular adaptation,
four of which localized in particularly important functional regions. Specifically, three sites were localized in
the loop D (site 98 in a region belonging to the substrate
binding cleft and sites 106 and 108 in insertion 1 region)
and a fourth site (214) was localized in the substrate binding loop. The previous sites 98 and 108, plus three additional sites (95, 102, 103) localized in loop D and site 202
belonging to the substrate binding loop were also identified to be under positive selection in other eutherian
mammal branches. The potential functional meaning of
the positive selection in eutherian mammal ABAD/
HSD10 proteins, particularly in the regions belonging to
the substrate binding cleft is, however, difficult to ascertain given the enzyme multiple substrate specificities and
participation in various metabolic pathways. As stated
behind, ABAD/HSD10 seems to have maintained a considerable structural and functional conservation across a
very large evolutionary distance. However, it is important
to say that although the identification of positively
selected amino acid sites do not necessarily prove that
such amino acid replacements modify the protein function, their occurrence in functional important sites provide a strong evidence for further functional experimental
analyses. In this respect, particularly appealing is the evidence of positive selection in loop D, given its involvement in Aβ binding. Recently, the determination of the
crystal structure of ABAD/HSD10 bound to Aβ and mutational studies on loop D furnished strong evidence for this
loop functions as the binding site for Aβ [12].

Conclusion
The sequencing of various genomes provided the opportunity to study the molecular evolution of the HADH2
gene encoding ABAD/HSD10. Our study revealed that
HADH2 genes maintained a very similar organization and
substantial conservation at amino acid level over more
than one billion years. The identification of a conserved
alternative splicing event between human and dog and
highly conserved noncoding regions among eutherian
mammals may provide a framework for further investigation of HADH2 gene regulation. The evidence of positive
selection across eutherian mammal ABAD/HSD10 proteins may be of importance for more applied biomedical
research on the enzyme function and its implication in
the Alzheimer's disease.

Methods
Database search of HADH2 gene sequences
The sequences of the HADH2 gene encoding ABAD/
HSD10 protein (synonymous names include SCHAD,
ERAB, MHBD, and scully for the Drosophila orthologue)
were retrieved from Ensembl [52], NCBI [53] and TIGR

Page 17 of 20

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:202

[54] databases (Table 1). Gene sequences were identified
either by TBLASTN searches within the various species
genome sequence projects using known ABAD/HSD10
amino acid sequences as queries or manually reconstructed from whole genome shotgun (WGS) traces
through MEGABLAST searches. For some species, the
HADH2 genes retrieved were only partially sequenced
(see figure 1). Additionally, BLAST searches were performed against species specific mRNA reference sequence
(RefSeq) databases at NCBI to detect alternative splicing
variants.
Sequence conservation
The amount and composition of repetitive elements was
investigated using RepeatMasker [55], CENSOR [56] and
Tandem Repeats Finder v.3.01 [57]. After removing repetitive motifs, Pip software analysis [58] was used to align
and identify patterns of sequence conservation across vertebrates, fishes and nematodes HADH2 genes. The 2 kb
region upstream the HADH2 genes was included in the
analysis, excepting for cat and orangutan genes, where
only a smaller portion was available (1 kb for cat and 200
bp for orangutan). Protein sequences were aligned with
CLUSTALW [59]. Sliding window percent amino acid
identity analyses (excluding indels) were conducted using
Swaap 1.0.2 [60].
Phylogenetic analyses
HADH2 sequences were investigated for variation in base
composition (or compositional bias), mutational saturation, and gene conversion, which are events known to disturb phylogenetic reconstructions. The chi-square test of
homogeneity implemented in TREE-PUZZLE v5.2 [61]
was used to evaluate variation in base composition at each
codon position. GENECONV v1.81 [62] was employed,
using the default settings, to detect recombination/gene
conversion events in the data set. To test for mutational
saturation, we plotted the number of transitions and
transversions from first, second, and third-codon positions against the pairwise genetic distances. The SYM+G+I
model was identified with Modeltest v3.06 [63] as the
best evolutionary model fitting the data. Transitions and
transversions for all pairwise sequence comparisons were
calculated using MEGA v3.1 [64], whereas genetic distances were calculated in PAUP v.4.0 b10 [65]. In the
absence of mutational saturation, genetic distances and
nucleotide substitutions give a linear relationship. Conversely, in case of nucleotide saturation, genetic distances
are larger than substitutions [66,67].

The phylogenetic relationships among HADH2 sequences
from different species were determined using Maximumlikelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods, implemented in
PAUP v.4.0 b10 [65] and MRBAYES v3.1 [68], respectively. The ML tree was reconstructed through a heuristic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/202

search with ten random additions of taxa and tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm.
Bootstrap support (BS) values were estimated with 100
replicates. In the Bayesian analysis, four markov chains
were run for 500,000 generations with burn-in values of
2,500 generations and trees being sampled every 100 generations. Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) were used
to evaluate branch support. Both trees were rooted using
C. elegans and C. briggsae sequences as outgroups.
Detection of positive selection
Positive selection analyses were restricted to eutherian
mammals to avoid violations in the evolutionary assumptions, i.e. absence of nucleotide saturation and base compositional bias, which requires closely related sequences
(see Table 1 and Figure 6). We used two strategies to identify positive selection: (i) a gene-level approach based on
the ratio (ω) of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS)
substitutions rate (i.e., ω = dN/dS), and (ii) a protein-level
approach which evaluates the physicochemical importance of amino acid changes on the protein structure. The
unrooted eutherian mammals ML tree was used in the
analyses.

The gene-level approach implemented in PAML v3.14
[69] uses likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to compare two
nested models, a model that does not account for sites
with ω > 1 (null model) and a model that does (positive
selection model) [70]. We used two LRTs based on site
specific models, which compare the null models M1a and
M7 against the alternative models (positive selection
models) M2a and M8, respectively. The posterior probability of a site being under positive selection was obtained
using the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) method implemented in PAML [71]. We also constructed two LRTs
based on branch models, the first compares one ratio
model (M0, assumes the same ω ratio for all branches)
with the free-ratios model (allows an independent ω ratio
for each branch) and the second compares model M0
with the two-ratio model (assumes a ω ratio for foreground branch different from that of background
branch). The two-ratio model was applied in a specific
branch (see results for details).
The protein-level approach implemented in TreeSAAP
[72] measures the selective influences of 31 physicochemical properties across a phylogenetic tree following
McClellan and McCracken method [73]. The program
uses a gradient of categories to classify each property
change from conservative to radical, and calculates a zscore which indicates the direction of selection. In our
analysis, we were interested in detecting positive-destabilizing selection as this results in radical structural or functional shifts in local regions of the protein, thus, being
unambiguously correlated with molecular adaptation. An

amino acid property is said to be affected by positivedestabilizing selection when the frequency of changes in
radical magnitude categories exceeds the frequency(s)
expected by chance, as indicated by positive z-scores.
VMD program [74] was used to map the positively
selected amino acid sites on the crystal structure of human
ABAD/HSD10 (PDB 1U7T) [15].
