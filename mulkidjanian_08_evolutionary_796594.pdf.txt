Abstract
Background: The F- and V-type ATPases are rotary molecular machines that couple translocation
of protons or sodium ions across the membrane to the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. Both the
F-type (found in most bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts) and V-type (found in
archaea, some bacteria, and eukaryotic vacuoles) ATPases can translocate either protons or
sodium ions. The prevalent proton-dependent ATPases are generally viewed as the primary form
of the enzyme whereas the sodium-translocating ATPases of some prokaryotes are usually
construed as an exotic adaptation to survival in extreme environments.
Results: We combine structural and phylogenetic analyses to clarify the evolutionary relation
between the proton- and sodium-translocating ATPases. A comparison of the structures of the
membrane-embedded oligomeric proteolipid rings of sodium-dependent F- and V-ATPases reveals
nearly identical sets of amino acids involved in sodium binding. We show that the sodiumdependent ATPases are scattered among proton-dependent ATPases in both the F- and the Vbranches of the phylogenetic tree.
Conclusion: Barring convergent emergence of the same set of ligands in several lineages, these
findings indicate that the use of sodium gradient for ATP synthesis is the ancestral modality of
membrane bioenergetics. Thus, a primitive, sodium-impermeable but proton-permeable cell
membrane that harboured a set of sodium-transporting enzymes appears to have been the
evolutionary predecessor of the more structurally demanding proton-tight membranes. The use of
proton as the coupling ion appears to be a later innovation that emerged on several independent
occasions.

Background
The vast majority of the cellular ATP is produced by the
membrane ATP synthases, reversible, rotary molecular
machines that couple ion transfer across the membrane
with the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. These machines
belong to two distinct types, namely, F-type that is present
in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles [1-4] and V-type,
represented in archaea and in some bacteria [5-9]. The
membranes of eukaryotic cells, in particular, vacuoles,
contain V-type ATPases which use the energy of ATP
hydrolysis to acidify cellular compartments [10-12].
The F/V-type ATPases couple transfer of protons or
sodium cations across their membrane moieties with the
concomitant hydrolysis or synthesis of ATP via a bindingchange mechanism in their protruding catalytic parts
[1,3,9,13]. Together with two evolutionarily unrelated
families, the P-type ATPases and ABC transporters, the F/
V ATPases belong to a heterogeneous group of enzymes
that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to translocate inorganic cations across membranes [14]. The F/V type
ATPases, however, are unique functionally, because they
can efficiently operate in the ATP synthase regimen, and
mechanistically, in that their reaction cycle is accompanied by rotation of one enzyme part (rotor) relative to the
other (stator) [3,15-17].

H+ or Na+

All F/V-ATPases have a mushroom-like structure, with the
head protruding ~100 Å from the membrane (see refs.
[5,7,9,12,18] and Figure 1). The head of the better studied
F-type ATPase is a hexamer of three α and three β subunits
(Figure 1A); each of the latter carries an ATP/ADP-binding
catalytic site [18]. The ion-translocating, membrane-spanning FO sector of bacterial F-type ATPases is a complex of
the integral membrane a subunit, two b subunits, and
10–15 small c subunits [3,19-21]; FO is connected to F1 by
two distinct stalks [22,23]. The peripheral stalk consists of
the protruding parts of the membrane-anchored b subunits that are connected to the α3β3 hexamer via the δ subunit [23]. The central stalk is formed by the elongated γ
subunit that connects the two parts of the enzyme and the
globular ε subunit that performs regulatory functions
[18,22]. The F-type ATPase is a rotary dynamo machine in
which sequential hydrolysis of ATP molecules by the α3β3
catalytic hexamer drives the rotation of the central stalk
together with the ring of c-subunits [1,15-17]. The c-ring
(rotor of the dynamo) is thought to slide along the interface with the a subunit that is rigidly bound via the
peripheral stalk to the α3β3 hexamer and forms part of the
stator; this sliding movement is coupled to the transmembrane ion transfer and generation of membrane potential.
When the enzyme functions as ATP synthase, the ion current through FO causes the rotation of the γ1ε1c10–15 complex relative to the other subunits, and the catalysis of ATP

Structure and evolutionary relationships of F- and V-type ATPases. Orthologous subunits are shown by the same
color and shape, and unrelated but functionally analogous subunits of the central stalk are shown by different colors and
shapes. The subunits that show structural analogy but might not be homologous are shown by different but similar colors. The
minimal, prokaryotic sets of subunits are depicted both for the F- and V-type ATPases. In the case of those V-ATPase subunits
that are denoted by different letters in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, double notation is used: eukaryotic/prokaryotic. For further details, see ref. [37].

synthesis is mediated by sequential interaction of the
rotating γ subunit with the three catalytic β subunits
[3,13,17,24].
The V-type ATPases, while sharing a common overall scaffold with F-ATPases, differ from them in many structural
and functional features (see refs. [7,10-12] and Figure 1B).
In particular, besides the large a-subunit and the c-oligomer (hereafter the eukaryotic notation is used [7]), the
VO sector contains the d subunit, which serves as a socket
for the D and F subunits of the central stalk of V1 [25,26].
The F/V-type ATPases are ubiquitous in the three domains
of cellular life (bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes) and
comprise the centerpiece of cellular metabolism owing to
their unique ability to utilize ion gradient for ATP production. Therefore, in addition to being the paradigmal biological nanomotors [17], these enzymes, depending on
their ion specificity, define the nature of the bioenergetic
cycle in any organism. The textbook bioenergetic cycle
that operates in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most
prokaryotes includes the generation of proton-motive
force (PMF) by primary transport systems (H+-pumps)
and its utilization for ATP synthesis, as well as for solute
transport, motility, reverse electron transport, etc [27].
However, certain extremophilic (in particular, thermophilic and alkaliphilic) and anaerobic bacteria and
archaea use Na+ as a coupling ion instead of or in addition
to H+ [28-30]. Similarly to the H+ cycle, a Na+ cycle
includes primary Na+ pumps, a Na+-transporting membrane ATP synthase, Na+-dependent membrane transporters, or a Na+-dependent flagellar motor.
Owing to its nearly ubiquitous presence in cells, the PMF
has been generally viewed as the primary intermediate in
biological energy transduction, in terms of both evolutionary history and of current importance for photosynthesis and respiration (see e.g. ref. [31]). By contrast, the
ability of some prokaryotes to utilize sodium gradient for
ATP synthesis is usually construed as a later exotic adaptation to survival in extreme environments [29,32-34]. Here
we combine structural and phylogenetic analyses to show
that sodium-translocating ATPases, most likely, antedated
proton-translocating ATPases during evolution, so that
the primordial membrane bioenergetics operated on
sodium gradients.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary relationships of
F- and V-ATPases
Sequence and structural comparisons of F- and V-type
ATPases revealed homology between the subunits of the
catalytic hexamer (α and B, β and A, respectively), membrane-embedded c/K-oligomers, and, perhaps, some subunits of the peripheral stalk (see Fig. 1), whereas the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/13

subunits of the central stalk have been found to be unrelated [8,35-37]. Based on this distribution of homologous
and non-homologous subunits in the structure of F- and
V-type ATPases, we recently outlined a scenario according
to which F/V-ATPases evolved from ATP-dependent RNA/
protein translocases that contained the translocated polymer at the place of the central stalk and, initially, functioned within primordial membranes that were
permeable for small ions, but not for RNA or protein [37].
This analysis seems to bring some certainty into the hotly
debated classification of rotary ATPases. While most
authors prefer to speak of eukaryotic and bacterial V-type
ATPases [7,9,38], some consider prokaryotic V-ATPases to
be a separate group of A-type (from archaeal, as suggested
by Gogarten and Starke [39]) ATPases, at the same level
with eukaryotic V-type ATPases and F-type ATPases
[5,40,41]. The latter division largely ignores the fact that
V-type ATPase genes are encoded in many recently
sequenced bacterial genomes, and the sequences of the
bacterial V-ATPase subunits are closely related to their
eukaryotic and archaeal counterparts (Table 1). Indeed, VATPases are the only type of membrane ATPases in all
members of the bacterial phylum Deinococcus-Thermus
[8] and most Chlamydia and Spirochaetes (Table 1).
Taken together, the presence of an F-ATPase operon in
Protochlamydia amoebophila (supposedly, an ancestral
form of the phylum) and the existence of spirochetes that
encode only F-ATPases (e.g. Leptospira spp.), as well as the
universal presence of V-ATPases in archaea and their
patchy phyletic distribution among bacteria, strongly suggest that bacteria acquired V-type ATPases from archaea,
via multiple horizontal transfers [42]. Likewise, the presence of F-ATPase genes in the genomes of archaea Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina barkeri [43], but
not in Methanosarcina mazei, probably reflects acquisition
of the corresponding genes from bacteria. In any case,
Table 1 shows that V-ATPases are widespread in bacteria,
many of which encode both F- and V-ATPases.
Furthermore, the absence of homology between the subunits of the central stalk indicates a major dichotomy
between the F-type ATPases, on the one hand, and V-type
ATPases, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, on the other
hand. In contrast, all subunits of prokaryotic V-type
ATPases (A-type ATPases, according to refs. [5,40,41])
have their counterparts in the vacuolar V-ATPases of
eukaryotes. Eukaryotic V-ATPases are more complex than
their archaeal and bacterial counterparts owing to the
presence of several additional subunits [7,9]. A similar
phenomenon, however, is observed in F-ATPases, where
the mitochondrial enzyme has several extra subunits as
compared to the bacterial one [2,44]. Sequence analysis
also indicates that the primary evolutionary split lies
between the F-type and V-type ATPases followed by sec-

a The table lists bacterial species (with strain numbers) whose genomes have been found to encode V-type ATPases based on BLAST [109] searches
of the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Availability of complete genome sequences is listed as of 12/31/2007. The absence of the F-ATPase
genes in complete genomes is indicated with a dash; in incomplete genomes, it is marked as n/d, which stands for "not detected".

ondary splits between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic
enzymes in each of the branches: in phylogenetic trees,
bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic V-ATPase subunits
invariably cluster together and separately from the F-type
ATPases [35,42,45]. This is a remarkable, rather rare case
where the evolutionary affinity between archaea and
eukaryotes is seen outside the information processing systems. Thus, consideration of A-type ATPases as a separate
class of rotary ATPases does not seem fully justified, not to
mention that it obscures the use of the archaeal enzyme as
a model for studying the eukaryotic V-ATPase.
Structural superposition of the Na+-binding sites of F- and
V-ATPases
Proton-translocating and Na+-translocating forms are
found among both F- and V-type ATPases. Notably, Na+dependent ATPases are capable of translocating protons
in the absence of Na+ [29,34], whereas H+-dependent
ATPases cannot translocate Na+ [46]. The apparent cause
of this asymmetry is that sodium translocation is more
structurally demanding: the coordination number of Na+
is 6, hence multiple, specific amino acid ligands are
required to draw a sodium cation from water and to keep
it in the non-polar inner space of the membrane.

The structures of the membrane-spanning, rotating oligomers of two Na+-translocating ATP synthases have been
recently reported. The oligomer ring of the Ilyobacter tartaricus F-type ATP synthase consists of 11 c-subunits [47]
whereas the ring of the Enterococcus hirae V-ATP synthase
is composed of 10 K-subunits [38]. These structures show
the same overall configuration of the Na+-binding sites
(Fig. 2). All the four Na+-binding amino acid residues of I.

tartaricus have readily identifiable counterparts in the E.
hirae ATPase, and the two sets of ligands perfectly superimpose in space (Fig. 3). Even the position of a non-ligating tyrosine that stabilizes the principal, Na+-binding
glutamate [34] is conserved. The K subunit of E. hirae
ATPase contains an additional Na+-binding ligand, Gln65
[38], which is not shown on Fig. 3. The corresponding residue in the I. tartaricus c-subunit, Thr67, is much smaller,
but, apparently can bind Na+ ion through a water molecule. Sequence alignment of c/K subunits (Additional File
1) shows that all (predicted) Na+-translocating ATPases
contain, in this position, a polar residue, Ser, Thr, Gln, or
Arg, that is capable of coordinating the Na+ ion either
directly (Gln or Arg) or, in the case of Ser and Thr, via a
water bridge [48]. In contrast, in all (predicted) H+-translocating ATPases, the corresponding position is occupied
by an aliphatic residue incapable of making a hydrogen
bond (Leu, Ile or Val). The sixth coordinating bond for the
Na+ ion, in all likelihood, is provided by a water molecule.
In enzymes of both types, this water molecule might
occupy the pocket between the conserved Pro/Ser28, Gly/
Ala29 (see Fig. 4), and the Na+ cation.
High-resolution crystal structures of H+-translocating coligomers are currently unavailable. However, sequence
comparison indicates that they lack at least some residues
that function as Na+ ligands except for the principal acidic
(Glu or Asp) cation-binding residue (see Fig. 4 and Additional File 1).

two identical subunits, A (green) and B (ice-blue), while in E.
hirae the Na+ ion is bound by a four-helical bundle that
results from a subunit duplication. In both structures, major
coordinating bonds to the Na+ ion are provided by the principal ligand (Glu65A in I. tartaricus and Glu139 in E. hirae);
other bonds come from a conserved glutamine (Gln32A in I.
tartaricus and Gln110 in E. hirae), a hydroxy group of Ser66B
in I. tartaricus and Thr64 in E. hirae (as initially predicted from
sequence comparison [48] and a backbone carbonyl (Val63B
in I. tartaricus and Leu61 in E. hirae). In E. hirae one more
bond is provided by Gln65 (not shown, see the text). The
remaining bonds are provided, most likely, by the unseen
water molecules.

The ancestral status of sodium bioenergetics inferred from
phylogenetic analysis
The identical arrangement of the Na+-binding sites in the
F-type and V-type Na+-translocating ATPases implies two
mutually exclusive evolutionary scenarios:

1) the ancestor of the F/V ATPases was a H+-translocating
enzyme, so the Na+-binding sites evolved independently
in the two lineages via the recruitment of the same residues in the same positions, i.e., by convergence;
2) the common ancestor of the F/V ATPases was a Na+translocating enzyme, but the ability to bind and translo-

Convergence in the evolution of enzymes, manifest in the
independent evolution of the same set of ligands conferring the same specificity in two lineages, is rare but not
unheard of, as illustrated by the seminal study of Stewart
et al. on the evolution of the langur monkey lysozyme
that independently gained the same 7 ligands as the ungulate lysozymes during adaptation to a cellulolytic diet
[49]. Thus, to distinguish between the two evolutionary
scenarios, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of the catalytic subunits of the V- and F-ATPase and superimposed
on it the known or predicted cation specificity, based on
the available experimental data and presence or absence
of the complete set of Na+-binding ligands (Fig. 5). The
catalytic subunits were employed for this analysis because
these are large proteins with numerous phylogenetically
informative positions (see Additional File 2); by contrast,
membrane-spanning c-subunits that harbor the cationbinding sites are short proteins that carry a weak phylogenetic signal, at best [45].
In the resulting tree, Na+-translocating ATPases did not
form a clade within either the F or the V branch but
instead comprised three distinct lineages among VATPases and at least three lineages among F-ATPases (Fig.
5). The monophyly of each clade of Na+-translocating
ATPases was supported by moderate to high bootstrap
values. In each of these clades, the same set of Na+ ligands
was conserved (Fig. 4). The independent emergence of
(nearly) identical ensembles of Na+ ligands in 6 distinct
lineages of Na+-translocating ATPases can be, effectively,
ruled out, leading to the conclusion that the common
ancestor of V- and F-ATPases had a Na+-binding site.
Unlike independent gain of the Na+ ligands in multiple
lineages, multiple independent losses of subsets of these
ligands appear plausible and could have led to the multiple transitions to proton translocation, provided that the
membranes in the respective organisms became protontight.
The caveat beyond this conclusion is, of course, the uncertainty of the tree topology which remains a concern in any
phylogenetic tree involving the deepest branchings in
life's history. To address this concern, we performed statistical testing of alternative phylogenetic hypotheses using
the approximately unbiased (AU) test. The AU test
showed that the transition between Na+ and H+ translocation occurred at least twice, i.e., at least once in the V-lineage and at least once in the F-lineage: the topology with
monophyletic Na+-translocating and H+-translocating
ATPases was unequivocally rejected (Figure 6a). Moreover, the topology where the primary split in both the Vlineage and the F-lineage was between Na+-specific and

and Tyr68 in E. hirae) that is located beneath the Na+ ion and stabilizes the principal Glu ligand.

H+-specific forms was rejected as well (Figure 6b). This
result suggests that the switch, actually, occurred more
than once in both V-type and F-type ATPases although
topologies with a single switch in one of the principal
branches could not be formally rejected (Figure 6c–h).
The test failed to discriminate between the topologies
where Na+-translocating or H+-translocating forms occupy
the basal position in either the V-ATPase and F-ATPase
clades (Fig. 6c,e,f,h). As discussed above, extraneous criteria, namely, the far greater likelihood of multiple losses of
Na+ ligands compared to that of multiple, independent
acquisitions of these ligands strongly point to the ancestral status of Na+ translocation.

Evolution of the c subunits of F/V-type ATPases by
duplication and loss of Na+ ligands
The c subunits of F-type and some prokaryotic V-type
ATPases are formed by two transmembrane (TM) segments that fold into a single helical hairpin and are less
than 100 amino acid residues long. Some of these proteins carry the complete set of Na+-ligands, e.g. in the c
subunits of the F-ATPase of Thermotoga maritima and the
V-ATPase of Nanoarchaeum equitans (see Additional File
1), whereas others have a partial set of Na+ ligands or even
retain only the principal Glu/Asp cation-binding residue
(e.g. F-ATPase from Escherichia coli or V-ATPase from Pyrobaculum aerophilum). Thus, H+-specific ATPases could have
evolved from Na+-specific ATPases on multiple occasions
and via somewhat different routes. The alignment of 2helical c subunits shows patterns of loss/replacement of
cation-binding residues that are generally consistent

Fig. 3 are indicated with arrows. The logo was constructed based on an alignment of single-hairpin c subunits (see Additional
File 1). The alignment of Na+-translocating c subunits also included 13 hairpin domains from the Methanopyrus kandleri ATP synthase (see text and ref. 50). Note that the conservation of the Na+-ligands (e.g. Gln/Glu32, Glu65, Ser/Thr66) is partly absent
in H+-binding subunits. It is noteworthy that the sodium ligands did not disappear completely; in addition to the principal acidic
(Glu or Asp) residue, some Na+ ligands are conserved in a variety of F-type and V-type H+-ATPases (see Additional File 1). This
might reflect binding of the H3O+ ion, rather than free proton, as first suggested by Boyer [107], in some enzymes, given that
H3O+ requires at least three coordination bonds [108].

within bacterial and archaeal phyla, suggesting that these
replacements occurred early in the evolution of the respective lineages (see Additional File 1). This finding corroborates the recent report of von Ballmoos and Dimroth on
different modes of proton-binding by different F/V-type
ATPases [34]. The pH-profiles of (i) the ATP hydrolysis
and (ii) the modification of the principal carboxyl residue
by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) were similar in the
Na+-binding F-type ATPase (I. tartaricus and Propionigenium modestum) and H+-translocating V-type ATP synthase of Halobacterium salinarium. However, these profiles
dramatically differed from the corresponding profiles of
the F-type ATPases of E-coli, spinach chloroplasts, and
bovine mitochondria. The revealed difference in the
modes of proton-binding in the active site might reflect
independent transition to H+-ATPase in different lineages.

In c/K subunits of other V-type ATPases, the 2-TM hairpins
are duplicated, resulting in proteins with 4 TM segments
(Fig. 2). Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and some other
methanogens have a triplication of the 2TM hairpin,
whereas Methanopyrus kandleri encodes a single protein of
1021 amino acid residues that encompasses 26 TM segments in 13 hairpins [50]. An early phylogenetic analysis
of the two-hairpin c subunits has suggested that they
evolved via several independent gene duplication and
fusion events [45]. Assuming that the ancestral state was a
Na+-translocating single-hairpin c subunit similar to the
ones in T. maritima or N. equitans, it becomes possible to
reconcile the history of duplications of the sequences
encoding 2TM hairpins with the accompanying changes
in cation specificity. Obviously, gene duplication per se
could have occurred without any loss of the Na+-binding
residues, as seen, e.g., in the proteins from Methanothermo-

Phylogeny of Na+-translocating and proton-translocating F/V-ATPases in Archaea (A), Bacteria (B) and
Eukarya (E). The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of a sequence alignment of β-subunits
of F-ATPases and A subunits of V-ATPases (see Additional File 2). The names of organisms with experimentally characterized
ATPases are shown in bold and colored red for Na+-dependent enzymes and blue for H+-dependent enzymes. The ATPases
whose c subunits carry all Na+-ligands and are hence predicted to translocate sodium are denoted by red circles, and those
lacking one or more of these ligands (and so predicted to translocate protons only) are denoted by blue circles. The numbers
at internal branches indicate the RELL bootstrap probabilities (expressed as percentage points). The root position was forced

bacter thermautotrophicus or Methanobrevibacter smithii (see
Additional File 1). In the M. kandleri protein, each of the
13 hairpins retains the complete set of Na+-binding residues such that one Na+ ion per hairpin can be bound (see
Additional File 1). However, in other V-ATPases, the
duplication of the 2TM hairpins is often accompanied by
the loss of one or more Na+ ligands in one or both hairpins. In these cases, the hairpin duplication is not accompanied by the increase in the number of bound Na+ ions
(as in E. hirae, see Fig. 2). While in single-hairpin c subu-

nits, as discussed above, the loss of even one ligand is
likely to hamper Na+-binding, in the double-hairpin but
single Na+-ion-binding c/K subunits, replacement/reshuffling of Na+-binding residues appears to be possible,
being, however, constrained so that residues from two different hairpins provide the full complement of ligands for
a Na+ ion as seen in the E. hirae V-ATPase (Fig. 2).
Primordial sodium bioenergetics and evolution of
membranes
The possibility that sodium bioenergetics antedated proton bioenergetics has been considered previously
[28,30,51] but has not drawn much attention, and proton-dependent bioenergetics is widely believed to be
ancestral [31,34,52]. This view is attractive considering
the intrinsic chemical coupling between protonation/
deprotonation events and redox reactions, in particular,
those of water and diverse quinones [53-55]. However,
proton energetics demands sophisticated, proton-tight
membranes. In the scenario of the origin of F/V-ATPases
from ATP-dependent RNA/protein translocases [37], with
the translocated polymer initially taking the position of
the central stalk, these primordial tranlocases were proposed to function within primitive, ancient membranes
that were permeable for both H+ and Na+ but not for RNA
or protein. Under this model, the evolution of F/VATPases was concomitant with the evolution of modern,
complex, ion-tight membranes from primordial, semipermeable membranes [37]. Conceivably, the ancient
translocase employed sodium cations to crosslink and stabilize the subunits of the c-oligomer (as in I. tartaricus, see
Fig. 3), preventing its destruction by the translocated polymer. Thus, even at the stage of the RNA/protein translocase, when the primordial membranes might have been
leaky to both Na+ and H+, there could have been a mechanistic demand for Na+-binding and, accordingly, selection for the corresponding set of amino acid ligands. This
scenario is supported by experiments demonstrating a
dramatic decrease in the stability of the c-oligomers of
Na+-translocating F-ATPases from I. tartaricus and P. modestum in the absence of Na+ [56].

When considering the possibility that primordial bioenergetics functioned on a sodium gradient, a biogeochemical
reality check is important: was there enough sodium in
the ancient ocean? Currently, there is a consensus that the
primordial ocean formed owing to the condensation of
the atmospheric water vapor upon cooling of the Earth
[57]. Hence, the primordial ocean was fresh at the time of
its emergence. However, it became salty relatively fast as
can be judged from the chemical composition of geologically trapped water (reviewed in [57,58]). In particular,
quartz crystals found in iron oxide structures from the 3.53.2 Ga Barberton greenstone belt, South Africa, contain
fluid inclusions with a Na/Cl ratio that is the same as in

Page 10 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:13

the present-day ocean (0.858), but the total amount of
sodium and chlorine in these inclusions is 1.6 times the
present day value [59]. Similarly, primary fluid inclusions
from intra-pillow quartz from the North Pole Dresser Formation Pilbara craton, Western Australia (3.490 Ga), contain saline fluid with 12 wt% equivalent NaCl and a Cl/Br
ratio of 631 [60]. Since this Cl/Br ratio is very close to that
of modern seawater (Cl//Br = 647), it appears likely that
this saline fluid is, indeed, archaeal seawater. Its higher
salinity as compared to present seawater is believed to be
due to the more intensive leaching of sodium (and other
metals) from the crust by hot hydrothermal fluids [57,58].
Only starting from Proterozoic terrains, the water inclusions show salinity close to that of modern seawater [61],
perhaps, reflecting certain calming of the hydrothermal
activity.
Thus, the above data indicate that, by the time of emergence of the first cells, sodium concentration in the ocean
was comparable to or even exceeded that in extant oceans.
Therefore, the next stage of evolution can be envisaged as
selection for tighter membranes that would maintain the
ionic homeostasis of the evolving cells, which would be
particularly important given the increasing ocean salinity,
and concomitantly, would create the opportunity for the
utilization of ion gradients. As suggested by Skulachev
[28], sodium-tight membranes could precede protontight membranes as structurally less demanding (see also
below). In response to the increasing salinity of the primordial ocean, cells would need a mechanism for pumping Na+ ions out of the cell, driving the transition from a
protein translocase to the precursor of an ion-translocating membrane ATPase, as described elsewhere [37]. These
ancestral ATPases would pump Na+ along with the Na+transporting pyrophosphatase [62] and chemically-driven
Na+-pumps, such as Na+-transporting decarboxylase
[29,63], which, being found in both bacteria and archaea,
appear to antedate the divergence of the three domains of
life. Unlike the other Na+ pumps, the common ancestor of
the V/F-ATPases, by virtue of its rotating scaffold, would
be able to translocate Na+ ions in both directions, so that,
upon further increase in the external salinity, reversal of
the rotation could result in Na+-driven synthesis of ATP by
this primordial rotary machine. This would be the beginning of membrane bioenergetics: together with the
ancient Na+ pumps, the V/F-type ATP synthase would
complete the first, sodium-dependent bioenergetic cycle
in a cell membrane (Figure 7).
The subsequent transition to the H+-dependent bioenergetics required proton-tight membranes. The conductivity
of lipid bilayers for protons is by 5–7 orders of magnitude
higher than the conductivity for Na+ and other small cations [64-66] and dramatically increases with temperature
[32]. This difference stems from the unique mechanism of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/13

transmembrane proton translocation. Whereas transfer of
other cations depends on their ability to penetrate the
phospholipid membrane, crossing of the membrane/
water interface by protons is not rate-limiting [64-67]:
protons, being confined to the membrane ionizable
groups [68], can apparently enter transient water clusters
nested between the lipid hydrocarbon chains. The rate of
proton transfer across the membrane is limited by proton
"hopping" across the middle of the bilayer, with the protons transferred from one side of the membrane to the
other via collisions between a protonated water cluster in
one monolayer and a cluster in the opposite monolayer
[65,66]. The rate of proton translocation, while independent of pH and insensitive to the H2O/D2O substitution
[64-67], is determined by the frequency of these collisions
which explains the dependence of the proton transfer rate
on the overall bilayer dynamics and on temperature. Proton leakage can be suppressed by decreasing lipid mobility and/or increasing hydrocarbon density in the
midplane of the bilayer, which can be achieved by either
branching the ends of the lipid chains or incorporating
hydrocarbons with a selective affinity to the cleavage
plane of the bilayer [66].
In agreement with the hypothesis of independent evolution of proton energetics in multiple lineages, proton
tightness of membranes appears to be achieved by radically different means in different organisms, namely, the
mobility of side chains is restricted in distinct ways and
diverse hydrocarbons are packed in the midplane of the
H+-tight membranes [32,66]. Specifically, the fatty acid
chains in the membrane of many bacteria have branched
termini (see [66] and references therein). In some thermoacidophiles, the lipid chains terminate with alicyclics
(cyclohexane and/or cycloheptane), resulting in additional crowding of the midplane of the bilayer [69]. In
archaea, lipids consist of two phytanyl (isoprenoid)
chains which are linked via a ether bond to glycerol or
other alcohols such as nonitol [70]. Extreme thermophilic
and acidophilic archaea possess membrane-spanning lipids in which the phytanyl chains of two diether lipids are
fused to a C40 core [32,70]. Both the chain fusion and the
involvement of a rigid ether bond restrict the hydrocarbon
chain mobility. In addition, different organisms pack different hydrocarbons in the midplane of their H+-tight
membranes, namely, phytosterols in plasma membranes
of plants and protozoa, and hopanoids and squalane in
bacteria (see [66] and references therein). In alkaliphilic
bacteria, where H+-tightness is crucial, the squalane content is elevated as compared to mesophiles [71]. In
eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, the middle of
the bilayer is occupied by the ubiquinone and plastoquinone tails [72]. Remarkably, plasma membranes of animal cells, as emphasized in Fig. 4, have remained "sodium

The proposed scenario for the evolution of membrane bioenergetics
The proposed scenario for the evolution of membrane bioenergetics. The scheme shows the proposed transition

(dashed lines) to the membranes that were impermeable to H+ and Na+ (solid lines). Dashed arrows show symbiotic acquisitions of α-proteobacteria (purple arrow) and of cyanobacteria (green arrow). The scheme emphasises that proton tightness of

membranes" [28] inasmuch as they cannot maintain H+
potential.
Taken together, the abundance of Na+-dependent thermophiles among deeply branching archaea and bacteria
[30,32,73], the existence of unrelated mechanisms that
make membranes H+-tight in different lineages [66], the
discovery of opportunistic, chemically driven Na+-translocating enzymes in several deeply branching organisms
[29,62,63,74], and the prevalence of the Na+-coupled
membrane transport systems over H+-coupled ones in
extremophiles [32] appear to provide strong support for

the "Na+-translocating ATPase first" scenario. This scenario involves a gradual transition from the primordial
membranes that were leaky to both Na+ and H+ to the currently predominant, more complex H+-tight membranes
via Na+-tight, but H+-permeable membranes, which are
still employed in animal cells, as well as, perhaps, in some
bacteria and archaea with sodium energetics (Figure 7).
Considering the ubiquity of the F/V-ATPases in cellular
life, their common ancestor is believed to have been
present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of
cellular life forms [75]. Here we argue that this enzyme

Page 12 of 19

Biology Direct 2008, 3:13

possessed a Na+-binding site. Thus, the LUCA either had
leaky membranes such that the common ancestor of the
F/V ATPases operated as polymer translocase with Na+
ions performing a structural role, or the membrane of the
LUCA was tight to sodium but permeable to protons and,
accordingly, the LUCA would have sodium energetics
(Figure 7). It seems highly unlikely that the LUCA had
modern, proton-tight membranes: as discussed above,
such membranes, probably, evolved later, independently
in different lineages, a feature that might underline the
fundamental difference in the lipid structure between bacteria and archaea [76].
As noted above, proton energetics has a major advantage
over sodium energetics because proton transfer can be
chemically coupled to redox reactions, thus, enabling the
advent of efficient redox-driven generators of proton
potential, such as cytochrome bc1 complex [55], cytochrome oxidase [54], or the oxygen-evolving photosystem
II [77,78]. Once membranes capable of maintaining proton gradient have evolved, separately in bacteria and
archaea, the sodium-binding sites of the F/V ATPases
became dispensable and deteriorated independently in
multiple lineages.

Conclusion
The presence of essentially identical Na+-binding sites in
the membrane-spanning c/K-oligomers of the F- and VATPases, combined with the scatter of Na+-dependent
ATPases among the more common, H+-dependent ones in
both the F and the V branches of the phylogenetic tree,
leads to the unexpected conclusion that, during evolution,
Na+-driven membrane bioenergetics preceded the protonbased energy conversion that is dominant in modern
cells. This conclusion is further buttressed by the substantially greater conductivity of lipid bilayers to protons than
to sodium cations and by the existence of distinct mechanisms that make membranes proton-tight in different lineages of cellular life. Under this scenario, the emergence of
membrane bioenergetics was constrained by the evolution of the membranes themselves, not only the energyconverting enzymes.

Methods
Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed using the MUSCLE program [79]. The consensus
patterns of protein sequence alignments were derived
using the SeqLogo format as implemented in the WebLogo tool {Crooks, 2004 #188;, 2007 #365}. Superposition of protein structures was performed using the VMD
software [80]. Maximum-likelihood unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MOLPHY program
(Jones-Taylor-Thornton model with uniform evolutionary rate across sites), and the same program was used to
compute the RELL bootstrap probabilities from 10,000

replications [81,82]. Statistical analysis of tree topology
was performed using the TreeFinder program [83], with
the Whelan and Goldman (WAG) evolutionary model
[84] and gamma-distributed site rates. Tree topologies
were compared using the Approximately Unbiased (AU)
test [85] implemented in the TreeFinder program.

Reviewers' reports
Reviewer's report 1
J. Peter Gogarten, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology,
University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, USA
The manuscript by Mulkidjanian et al. puts forward the
very interesting hypothesis that the V/F/A-ATPases first
evolved as Na+-pumps and only later acquired specificity
for protons several times independently. The main argument supporting this hypothesis is that the extant Na+
translocating V/F/A-ATPases do not group together in
phylogenetic reconstruction, and that it is unlikely that
the more complex binding site in sodium translocating
ATPases evolved multiple times independently. This
hypothesis is also in agreement with the hypothesis,
based on subunit stoichiometry, that these ATPases first
evolved as ion pumps and that the switch to ATP synthases occurred more recently [86].

On page 10 the authors appear to overstate their case "The
independent emergence of (nearly) identical ensembles
of Na+ ligands in at least 6 distinct lineages ... can be, effectively, ruled out". Indeed, 6 independent convergent
events are extremely unlikely, but the number 6 seems to
be derived from counting the groups of Na+ pumping
ATPases in Fig. 5. Cursory inspection shows that this tree
is as unreliable as should be expected for a tree-of-life
based on a single molecule. For example, Nanoarchaeon is
grouped separately from all other archaeal homologs,
whereas many multigene analyses [87,88] group Nanoarchaeon with the Thermo- and Pyrococci. If this were also
true for the catalytic ATPases subunit, the number of independent convergent events is reduced by one. From work
done in my lab [89] we know that the group constituted

by ATPase catalytic subunits from Chlamydia/Borrelia/
Treponema/Bacteroides is difficult to place, because these
sequences are very divergent. These sequences can be
attached almost anywhere within the A-ATPase part of the
tree without significantly increasing the likelihood. I suspect that the situation for the F-ATPases is similar. In part
this concern is addressed by the analysis depicted in Fig.
6, and this shows that a non Na+ pumping origin of the V/
F/A-ATPases necessitates the assumption of convergent
evolution or gene transfer, but it is not "at least 6" independent events, but only at least 2 independent events
that survive closer scrutiny.
Authors' response
The questionable wording was modified. "At least 6 independent events" is indeed an (over)optimistic estimate whereas "at
least 2 independent events" is a (overly) conservative one.

I have one concern that the authors might be able to
address experimentally: The phylogeny of the ATPases was
calculated using the catalytic subunits of the ATPases. The
authors' argument rests on the assumption that the ion
translocating proteolipid subunit and the ATP hydrolyzing subunits evolved as a unit.
While this is a reasonable assumption, in ABC transporters the ATP binding cassette subunit not always co-evolves
with the permease domains [90]. A similar situation
might have occurred in the evolution of V/F/A-ATPases.
While the proteolipid phylogeny is unresolved, using the
AU test one could at least test if the proteolipid dataset is
in significant conflict with the topology derived from the
catalytic subunits.
Authors' response
Given that the c/K subunits are short, highly diverged integral
membrane proteins, we believe that any phylogenetic reconstruction and testing would produce, at best, unreliable results
(not in the least due to the questionable applicability of the
canonical evolutionary models to transmembrane segments).
Thus, the evolutionary history of catalytic β/A subunit seems to
be the best attainable approximation of evolution of the entire
ATPase complex.
Reviewer's reponse in a second review
I did not suggest to replace the analysis of catalytic subunits with that of the c/K subunits, but to test that the latter
dataset is not in gross conflict with the phylogeny derived
from the former.
Authors' response
We appreciate this but even such tests hardly could be reliable
given the unreliability of the c/K tree.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/13

Reviewer's report continued
I would advise more cautious interpretation in placing the
evolution of ion specificity into the context of organismal
evolution and in relation to the most recent common
ancestor. As I pointed out previously, it can be misleading
to only consider branches in the tree of life that have
extant representatives [91]. Darwin's coral of life [92,93],
in which the layer of extant organisms sits on the dead
branches of their ancestors, might be a better picture to
visualize evolutionary history [94]. One should consider
the possibility that at the time of the organismal most
recent common ancestor ATPases with different ion specificity already existed and that these were distributed into
different extant lineages by horizontal gene transfer. These
considerations do not impact the way the properties of the
ancestral ATPase are reconstructed based on extant characteristics and phylogeny, but it changes the confidence
with which we ascribe properties to the last universal common ancestor.
Authors' response
Point well taken. We do not believe it necessary to modify the
main text of the article but let this comment be the word of caution. We do not at all dispute the coral of life idea. Neither do
we believe that the nature of LUCA is a resolved issue, so it is
indeed a possibility, even if a non-parsimonious one, that, at
this stage of evolution, both Na+-ATPases and H+-ATPases
already existed. However, we would like to note that the devices
for making a membrane proton-tight are much more complex
than those that are required for sodium tightness, and that proton tightness seems to have evolved on multiple occasions during life's history (see main text). Therefore, it seems highly
plausible that sodium bioenergetics antedated proton bioenergetics, even as we do not insist on our inference of the state of
affairs in LUCA.

The descriptions in the method section are very sparse.
Was the tree depicted in Fig. 5 calculated using a model
that takes among site rate variation into account? If not,
this might explain the deep divergence of the Chlamydia/
Borrelia/Treponema/Bacteroides sequences. These are fast
evolving sequences, and their placement as the deepest
branch within the V/A-ATPases likely is an artifact (see
above).
Authors' response
We did not find it necessary to expand the Methods section substantially given that the employed methods are well described in
the literature. However, specifics on the evolutionary model
used in our analysis were added. The tree depicted in Fig. 5was
reconstructed with a model with a uniform evolutionary rate
across sites. However, tree topology tests were performed using
a model with gamma-distributed site rates. We found that taking into account rate variation across sites did not change the
position of the V-type Chlamydia/Spirochetes/Bacteroidetes

Page 14 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:13

ATPase subunits. If this position is artifactual (which is a distinct possibility), the anomaly in the evolution of this branch is
so substantial that its position is insensitive to the details of the
evolutionary model used in phylogeny reconstruction.
Last and least, the question of terminology addressed by
the authors. I wholeheartedly agree that the primary split
in the evolution of V/F/A-ATPases is between F-ATPases
on one side and the V/A-ATPases on the other. I don't
think that I ever said anything to the contrary. The classification into V-, F- and A-ATPases never was intended to
result in co-equal categories, and in cladistic terms the AATPases likely represent a paraphyletic grouping. Nevertheless, I am not convinced that the distinction between
V- and A-type ATPases should be abandoned.
Authors' response
Currently, V-, F-, and A-ATPases are routinely treated as coequal classes (e.g., references 5, 6, 40, and 41), which compelled us to make a clear distinction between the F-type and the
V/A-type ATPases.

While this split is less deep with respect to time (and less
reflected in the primary sequence), with respect to function the A- and F-ATPases are more similar to each other
than to the eukaryotic V-ATPases, which no-longer function as ATP synthases in vivo, but as dedicated proton
pumps. Their function as an endomembrane and lytic
compartment energizing ATPase the eukaryotes is distinct
and different from that of the F- and A-ATPases. In my
opinion this difference in physiological role justifies giving the eukaryotic vacuolar type ATPases a distinct name,
and the term vacuolar-type seems appropriate, whereas
labeling the archaeal counterpart as vacuolar type ATPases
seems as strange as calling FtsZ a tubulin.
Authors' response
In our opinion, the difference in the physiological roles of A-type
and eukaryotic V-type ATPases, which is the ability of the
former class, but not the latter one to function as ATP synthases
is relatively minor, especially, given that bacterial V/A-type
ATPases are capable of synthesizing ATP [95,96]. Whether the
particular enzyme complex operates predominantly as an
ATPase or ATP synthase, is determined by two factors. The first
factor is the number of c-subunits per enzyme complex. The catalytic hexamer can always process 3 nucleotide molecules per
full rotation. The number of ions that are translocated per rotation is directly determined by the number of c-subunits, which
shows substantial variations. ATPases with 10 c-subunits, as in
mitochondria, E. coli or E. hirae, can operate either as ATPases
or as ATP synthases, depending on the conditions. If the
number of c-subunits is large, e.g. 13–15, as in chloroplasts
and cyanobacteria, then the driving force for ATP synthesis is
stronger, so the enzyme preferentially operates as an ATP synthase. By contrast, if the number of c-subunits is small, e.g. six,

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/13

as appears to be the case in eukaryotic V-ATPase, then the
enzyme, on the one hand, can utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to generate a large pH-gradient of up to 4–5 pH units, but,
on the other hand, would need an even larger ion-motive force
to function as an ATP synthase. Apart from these thermodynamic considerations, these enzyme complexes are regulated. It
has been shown that the conformation of the ε subunit in E. coli
determines whether the enzyme complex operates as ATP synthase or as ATPase [97,98]. It might well be that such regulation also affects eukaryotic V-ATPases. Nevertheless, it cannot
be ruled out that, when exposed to a sufficiently large ion gradient, even eukaryotic V-ATPases would be able to synthesize
ATP. To the best of our knowledge, such experiments have never
been reported.
Also, in discussing this point the text seems a little unfair:
as a criticism against the term A-ATPase, the authors argue
that it "largely ignores the fact that V-type ATPase genes
are encoded in many recently sequenced bacterial
genomes", but on the following pages the authors themselves point out that these bacterial A-ATPases were likely
acquired through HGT from archaeal donors. Clearly, AATPase is intended to stand for archaeal type ATPase, not
ATPase found in Archaea.
Authors' response
We could gladly agree with that distinction. However, ever
since the first description in Thermus thermophilus [99]and
Enterococcus hirae [100], bacterial non-F-type ATPases have
been invariably referred to as V-type ATPases (whereas the
reviewer has been using the term V/A-ATPase). The E. hirae
ATPase has been referred to as V-ATPase in the recent structural paper by Murata et al. [38]. Thus, given the wide use of
the term V-ATPase for bacterial enzymes, we felt compelled to
note that there are no substantial differences between bacterial
and archaeal enzymes of this class.
Reviewer's response in a second review
The characteristic of eukaryotic V-ATPases is that their
physiological role is to build up a proton gradient. This
change is related to a change in proton/ATP stoichiometry
which appears to be caused by the larger proteolipid size
[101]; and appears to have occurred early in the evolution
of eukaryotes [45]. The authors conjecture that given a
sufficiently large driving force (electrochemical gradient
for protons large as compared to the free energy of ATP
hydrolysis) the eukaryotic V-ATPases can synthesize ATP;
indeed, this was shown experimentally [102]. With
respect to stoichiometry and quaternary structure the
eukaryotic vacuolar type ATPases appear more uniform
than the more diverse archaeal and bacterial V/A-ATPases.
I don't think that those who use the term A-type ATPase
imply that the A-, F- and V-ATPases are co-equal groups as
suggested by the authors. The eukaryotic vacuolar type
ATPases is clearly derived from its archaeal counterpart

[103], and I don't think the authors of references 5, 6, 40,
and 41 suggest otherwise.
Authors' response
We appreciate the pointer to the important work of Hirata et
al.; their results indeed are quite compatible with the approach
to classification of membrane ATPases taken here.
Reviewer's report 2
Martijn A. Huynen, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences,
Radboud University, Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The
Netherlands
The manuscript of Mulkidjanian et al presents a thoroughly documented and compelling argument for the primacy of an Na+ dependent ATPase as the originator of
both V-type and F-type ATPase. In general I find little argument with their thesis and I thoroughly enjoyed reading
it.

Some points:
The lynch-pin of their argument is the very similar 3D
structure of the residues that are involved in Na+ binding
in a V-type and in an F-type Na+ ATPase. I do think that we
actually also need 2 structures of H+ transporting ATPases
to make the case that the latter are less "conserved" and/
or "constrained" in 3D structure. Although the results of
Ballmoos and Dimroth, argue, of course, against a conserved mechanism of proton translocation.
Authors' response
In order to assess structural constraints, at least, two structures
seem necessary, indeed. However, this is not our argument here
which is that, in H+-ATPases, the majority of Na+ ligands are
not conserved. Sequence analysis is sufficient to make this argument.

As the point of the prevalence of sodium energetics
among early branching is mentioned in the abstract, I
would like to see this more explicitly in the manuscript.
There are a lot of debates about which species are actually
early branching, and this referee does not feel like reading
that literature in order to figure out which species are
referred to in this manuscript. Maybe it can also be mentioned more explicitly that although Na+ transporters are
widely distributed in life [28,62,63], it cannot be concluded form that literature that they are older than H+
transporters.
Authors' response
The issue with "early-branching" prokaryotes is, indeed,
extremely difficult, and upon more careful deliberation, we
decided to drop this argument. As for Na+ transporters vs. H+
transporters, it is not quite clear what H+ transporters are
meant.

The "by virtue of its rotating scaffold" argument sounds
logical, but is it also thermodynamically true? I thought
that all reactions are, in principle, reversible.
Authors' response
Of course, all biochemical reactions are, in principle, reversible.
However, membrane ATPases are complex machines where
one, in principle, reversible enzyme, the ATPase, is mechanistically coupled with another reversible enzyme, the membrane
ion translocase. Whether the coupling between the chemical
reaction and ion translocation is reversible or not, is determined
by the coupling mechanism [104]. In particular, ATP synthesis
by diverse ABC-transporters or P-type ATPases (in their theoretically possible reverse mode of operation) has never been
reported. Apparently, the mechanics of these complexes are not
compatible with ATP synthesis powered by the transmembrane
ion gradient. Therefore, the rotating scaffold of the common
ancestor of F/V-type ATPases was an innovation of substantial
selective value, thanks to its ability to catalyze the ATP/ADP
conversion in both directions by simply changing the direction
of rotation. As already noted, at least some of the extant F-ATP
synthases are not straightforwardly reversible owing to a fairly
sophisticated regulatory mechanism [97]. However, this regulation is likely to have evolved after the emergence of the first
rotary ion-translocating ATPase.
Reviewer's report 3
Igor B. Zhulin, Joint Institute for Computational Sciences, The
University of Tennessee – Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak
Ridge, Tennessee, USA
This work by Mulkidjanian et al. builds on their previous
considerations of the evolution of the F-type and V-type
ATPases [37]. They now provide a significant body of evidence pointing toward a sodium ion as the ancestral form
of ion gradient-driven ATP synthesis. Historically, sodium
bioenergetics was viewed as secondary to classical, more
ubiquitous proton bioenergetics; therefore, the current
study is paradigm-shifting. The paper is well-written and I
do not have any specific concerns. Authors present independent lines of evidence to support their evolutionary
scenario (Fig. 7). These involve several types of structural
and sequence analyses, each carefully done and well presented. Phyletic distribution of sodium versus proton
energetics provides an extra argument and logical reasoning rounds up the story. As a result, a usual dilemma –
whether one favors gene loss over horizontal gene transfer
(in this case, convergent evolution) – does not appear
unsolvable. The probability of independent inventions is
so much lower than gene loss that in this case it is almost
prohibitive. Unless one provides strong counterarguments (I obviously do not have any), let sodium bioenergetics rule!

Authors' response
We appreciate this positive review. We must point out, however, that, under the current scenario, evolution of proton
bioenergetics involved independent loss of specific sets of amino
acid residues (Na+ ligands) rather than gene loss.
