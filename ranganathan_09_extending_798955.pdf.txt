Abstract
The 2009 annual conference of the Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet), Asia's oldest
bioinformatics organisation dating back to 1998, was organized as the 8th International Conference
on Bioinformatics (InCoB), Sept. 7-11, 2009 at Biopolis, Singapore. Besides bringing together
scientists from the field of bioinformatics in this region, InCoB has actively engaged clinicians and
researchers from the area of systems biology, to facilitate greater synergy between these two
groups. InCoB2009 followed on from a series of successful annual events in Bangkok (Thailand),
Penang (Malaysia), Auckland (New Zealand), Busan (South Korea), New Delhi (India), Hong Kong
and Taipei (Taiwan), with InCoB2010 scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, Sept. 26-28, 2010. The
Workshop on Education in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (WEBCB) and symposia on
Clinical Bioinformatics (CBAS), the Singapore Symposium on Computational Biology (SYMBIO)
and training tutorials were scheduled prior to the scientific meeting, and provided ample
opportunity for in-depth learning and special interest meetings for educators, clinicians and
students. We provide a brief overview of the peer-reviewed bioinformatics manuscripts accepted
for publication in this supplement, grouped into thematic areas. In order to facilitate scientific
reproducibility and accountability, we have, for the first time, introduced minimum information
criteria for our pubilcations, including compliance to a Minimum Information about a Bioinformatics
Investigation (MIABi). As the regional research expertise in bioinformatics matures, we have
delineated a minimum set of bioinformatics skills required for addressing the computational
challenges of the "-omics" era.

Overview
The Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet, [1])
is the oldest regional bioinformatics society, established
in 1998, to gather scientists from diverse disciplines to
work together to advance the frontiers of bioinformatics.
The first three annual meetings were held at the Pacific
Symposium of Biocomputing (1999-2001), in Hawaii, to
nucleate a bioinformatics core group in the region. With
the core group reaching critical mass, the APBioNet executive committee members assisted in organizing
InCoB2002 (the International Conference on Bioinformatics, 2002) in Bangkok, Thailand and adopted this
meeting as their annual conference. Following this successful event, InCoB meetings have been held in Penang,
Malaysia (2003); Auckland, New Zealand (2004); Busan,
South Korea (2005), New Delhi, India (2006); Hong
Kong/Hanoi (by videocasting) (2007) and Taipei, Taiwan
(2008, [2]).
In order to sustain the growth of bioinformatics in the
region, a special interest group meeting of bioinformatics
educators, the Workshop on Education in Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology (WEBCB) was organized at
InCoB2008, attended also by life scientists participating
in the symposium of the Federation of Asian and Oceanician Biochemists and Molecular Biologists (FAOBMB) at
the same location. WEBCB follows on the Workshops on
Education in Bioinformatics (WEB, initiated by SR) [3], to
incorporate bioinformatics into mainstream life science
research and its second meeting was held at InCoB2009,
along with tutorials in traditional and emerging topics as
part of APBioNet's training mandate.

diversity informatics as well as a case study on the impact
of e-learning tools in bioinformatics education.

Reviewing standards
Papers submitted to these proceedings were peer-reviewed
by at least three reviewers, from the APBioNet/InCoB program committee and invited external experts as required
(listed in Additional File 1). InCoB2009 also provided
multi-track submissions, with the inclusion of research
highlights from recent publications and for showcasing
technology developments along with posters. With tutorials, a specialist workshop on bioinformatics education
and two special interest research symposia, InCoB2009
provided a comprehensive five-day international bioinformatics meeting in the Asia Pacific.
The editors carefully screened the 90 full paper submissions and relegated two of these to the poster session, in
order to select only the best papers from more than a
dozen Asia Pacific countries, as well as UK and USA. From
the 88 full paper submissions reviewed, 49 were short
listed for oral presentation. This supplement features 34
papers addressing "-omics" data analysis, while 10 papers
were accepted for publication in the BMC Bioinformatics
supplement [6], reflecting an overall acceptance rate of
50%, with five more appearing in the online journal, Bioinformation [7]. Extensive collaboration in bioinformatics
research in the region is evident from co-authorship of
papers involving Australia, China, Hong Kong, India,
Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, UK and USA.
A brief review of the different themes is provided below.

Next-generation sequence analysis
The first ever Clinical Bioinformatics Symposium (CBAS)
was held prior to the InCoB2009 scientific conference,
while the Singapore chapter of the Regional Student
Group of the International Society for Computational
Biology organized the Singapore Symposium on Computational Biology (SYMBIO) to provide students and young
investigators an opportunity to present their ongoing
research work.
In order to provide opportunities for international peerreviewed high-impact factor journal publications, APBioNet embarked on further raising the standards for the
region by publishing a dedicated BMC Bioinformatics supplement, since 2006 [2,4,5]. In 2009, the manuscripts
from APBioNet members have diversified and increased
in quality and sophistication with computational biology
articles addressing analysis pertaining to "-omics" data
published in this supplement and a BMC Bioinformatics
supplement [6], focussing on protein sequence analysis,
genetic and population analysis, structural bioinformatics, text mining and ontology, chemoinformatics and bio-

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, nucleotide sequencing has become inexpensive,
albeit resulting in short sequence reads, requiring new and
efficient bioinformatics tools. Zhao et al. [8] present an
alignment tool, BOAT, capable of mapping large volumes
of short reads to reference sequences with better sensitivity and lower memory requirement than other currently
existing algorithms. Chung and Park [9] propose an
empirical method for choosing efficient discriminative
seeds for oligonucleotide design, while Piriyapongsa et al.
[10] have developed a new integrated primer design tool.
Venkatachalam et al. [11] have predicted the occurrence
of peroxisome proliferator response elements, which are
promising targets for cancer treatment, followed by in vitro
experimental validation. In order to accurately predict the
caspase degradome on a systems-wide basis, Wee et al.
[12] have developed a multifactor model incorporating
cleavage site prediction and structural factors.

Genome analysis
To track genome-wide transposon-based insertional
mutagenesis experiments, Yang et al. [13] have developed

BMC Genomics 2009, 10(Suppl 3):S1

MP-PBmice, a web-based application for large-scale insertional mutation mapping onto the mouse genome, while
Lim et al. [14] present BioBarcode, a database resource for
Asian biodiversity resources. Jenjaroenpun and Kuznetsov
[15] tackle the problem of identifying triplex DNA forming region, towards discovering biologically meaningful
genome modules and to optimize experimental design of
anti-gene treatments, while Saeed and Halgamuge [16]
propose a one-dimensional signature derived from oligonucleotide frequency, for efficient grouping or "binning"
of metagenome fragments, crucial to the success of microbial genome consortia. Chacko and Ranganathan [17]
present the genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing
in the bovine genome, with implications for using the
cow as a model for specific human diseases.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/S3/S1

Structural genomics
Towards understanding biological function, large-scale
biological structure determination projects are currently
underway, leading to structure analysis into protein
domains by Yoo et al. [27]. Where experimental structures
are not available, structure prediction is still an important
area of research, with Liu et al. [28] presenting a new
sequence-based hybrid predictor to identify conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins. Huang et al. [29]
have used sequence and structural information to predict
DNA-binding residues in transcription factors, while
Jongkon et al. [30] have predicted the binding preference
of various strains of avian influenza A to cognate human
receptors. Prasad et al. [31] have employed RNA secondary structure and sequence motifs for the phylogenetic
analysis of flukes.

Genetic and population analysis
For genotype-phenotype correlations, understanding
mitochondrial variations of each individual, haplogroup
or geographical location is of primary importance. MitoVariome (Lee at al. [18]) provides a human mitochondrial
variation resource for researchers in this area. To identify
splice variants and SNPs in short sequence reads from
next-generation sequencing approaches, Bao et al. [19]
have developed a software tool, MapNext.

Transcriptome analysis
DNA microarrays have led to a multitude of gene expression analysis studies. Nguyen and LiÃ³ [20] have developed a new metric, BayesGen, to measure the similarity
between gene expression profiles, for constructing
genome-wide co-expression networks, and for clustering
cancer human tissues into subtypes. Kuem et al. [21]
present a pathway-based gene expression similarity measure, which outperforms other commonly used similarity
measures, while Ho et al. [22] have used quantile regression models to characterize gene-expression patterns
underpinning the molecular regulatory mechanisms leading to mammalian ageing.

Interactome analysis
Interaction data from biology present enormous challenges to bioinformatics in the "-omics" era and contribute to our understanding the functions of biological
molecules and systems. Kadupitige et al. [23] present a
tool for exploratory analysis of gene interaction networks,
while Park et al. [24] have developed a prototype database
and server for analyzing protein interaction networks.
Maulik et al. [25] have applied protein interaction data to
understand plant defense mechanisms, while Reja et al.
[26] have developed MitoInteractome, a mitochondrial
protein interaction resource for characterizing the ageing
process.

Networks, pathways and systems biology
With the growing interest in systems biology, six studies in
computations approaches to networks, pathways and systems were presented at InCoB2009. Kim and Gelenbe [32]
propose the G-network for the steady-state behaviour of
gene regulatory networks for identifying disease-causing
genes while Le et al. [33] have applied rule induction
learning to characterise nucleosome dynamics from
genomic and epigenetic data. Chaturvedi and Rajapakse
[34] have developed a skip-chain model to study timedelayed regulation in gene regulatory networks. Rhee et al.
[35] identifed cell cycle-related regulatory motifs using a
kernel canonical correlation analysis. Mapping virus-host
protein interactions to host signalling pathways has been
carried out [36] to characterize alternative pathways that
can be targeted by drugs, while Min and Hong [37] has
analysed how rate-limiting enzymes influence metabolic
flux.

Disease informatics
The human genome was primarily sequenced to understand the genetic basis of diseases. In this area, Yang et al.
[38] have compiled a database of Parkinson's Diseaserelated genes and genetic variation. Khan and Ranganathan [39] have used a multi-species comparative structural approach of inherited mutations to correlate
genotype to phenotype in an inherited disease.

Clinical informatics
Ultimately, bioinformatics will have to process clinical
data to address the quest for personalized medicine. As
medical and biological data are commonly presented usually as small datasets without balanced class distribution,
Yang et al. [40] have developed a particle swarm approach
to address this imbalance for the discovery of new pathological conditions and disease subtypes. Jho et al. [41]
have developed a data deposition system integrated with

Conclusion

Competing interests

Judging from the breadth and depth of topics covered in
this issue, Asia Pacific bioinformatics research has not
only maintained its level of research achievement, but
extended computational approaches to systems biology
and medical and clinical informatics. Computational
biology is now acknowledged to be a core research discipline in our educational and research institutions. We also
note that several papers bearing graduate students as first
authors, testifying to the quality of research training
imparted. In order to effectively train new entrants to
undertake bioinformatics research in the "-omics" era,
WEBCB has, over the past two years, run discussion fora
to define the key elements constituting a minimum set of
bioinformatics skills. Based on the outcome of these discussions, Tan et al. [42] present the minimum skill set in
bioinformatics and computational biology that an ideal
graduating student in life sciences would possess.

The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Furthermore, computational biology is now considered
an essential area of research for supporting to "-omics"
and health research, as reported by scientists from Malaysia [43] and Singapore [44] and elsewhere. However, the
situation is plagued by author ambiguity especially for
Asian names, broken links for web tools, disappearing
databases and inadequate disclosure, not enough for
reproducibility.

New initiatives from the Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics network include compliance standards such as Minimum
Information about a Bioinformatics investigation
(MIABi), currently under development. This MIABi compliance will require, firstly, for authors to be issued with
unique author identifiers (e.g. see prototype at http://
aid.apbionet.org/) for identity disambiguation and
accountability purposes. Authors with multiple identifiers issued by various publishers (e.g. Schopus author ID,
researcherID) can now be resolved to a unique individual
through indentifiers cross-referencing.

Secondly, it will eventually require deposition of scientific
datasets through a central portal (e.g. http://docid.apbio
net.org/) for persistence, provenanc, accessibility and
reproducibility. All databses, datasets and codes cited in
papers published through our processes may be mandated to be archived in this way, supported by distributed
repository nodes, such as that of the Asian Bioinformation
Centers [45] initiative. Moreover, a database on a preconfigured operating system (OS) such as BioSlax (http://
www.bioslax.com) can also be archived as an image,
stored at such repositories. Even though the original database server may no longer be available, the database-OS
