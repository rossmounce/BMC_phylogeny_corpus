strain-specific virulence factors

Abstract
Background: Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila is a gram-negative g-Proteobacterium and the causative
agent of Legionnaires’ disease, a form of epidemic pneumonia. It has a water-related life cycle. In industrialized
cities L. pneumophila is commonly encountered in refrigeration towers and water pipes. Infection is always via
infected aerosols to humans. Although many efforts have been made to eradicate Legionella from buildings, it still
contaminates the water systems. The town of Alcoy (Valencian Region, Spain) has had recurrent outbreaks since
1999. The strain “Alcoy 2300/99” is a particularly persistent and recurrent strain that was isolated during one of the
most significant outbreaks between the years 1999-2000.
Results: We have sequenced the genome of the particularly persistent L. pneumophila strain Alcoy 2300/99 and
have compared it with four previously sequenced strains known as Philadelphia (USA), Lens (France), Paris (France)
and Corby (England).
Pangenome analysis facilitated the identification of strain-specific features, as well as some that are shared by two
or more strains. We identified: (1) three islands related to anti-drug resistance systems; (2) a system for transport
and secretion of heavy metals; (3) three systems related to DNA transfer; (4) two CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems, known to provide resistance against phage infections, one similar in
the Lens and Alcoy strains, and another specific to the Paris strain; and (5) seven islands of phage-related proteins,
five of which seem to be strain-specific and two shared.
Conclusions: The dispensable genome disclosed by the pangenomic analysis seems to be a reservoir of new traits
that have mainly been acquired by horizontal gene transfer and could confer evolutionary advantages over strains
lacking them.

Background
Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative facultative
intracellular pathogen, identified as the infectious agent
of the Legionnaire’s disease (LD) or Legionellosis in
1977 [1]. It is found in aquatic environments parasitizing its natural hosts, amoebae and protozoa. From this
environment, Legionella can colonize water treatment
plants, such as refrigeration towers, potable water pipes,
etc., and can cause infections in humans, when infected
aerosols are inhaled [2,3]. Despite efforts to keep water
systems free of Legionella, this pathogen is still causing
infection throughout the world, including Spain, where
it is endemic in some areas. From 1989 to 2005, around
310 outbreaks with 2,974 cases were recorded worldwide. In 2002 and 2005 there were two important

epidemic events with 1,461 and 1,292 cases respectively.
In Alcoy, an industrial town in the Valencian Region
(Spain), a large outbreak occurred during 1999-2000. A
strain that had caused several outbreaks and many
cases, named “Alcoy 2300/99”, was isolated from a
patient in that outbreak [4]. Since then, recurrent epidemics in Alcoy have harbored Alcoy 2300/99.
Currently, the genomes of five L. pneumophila
strains are available: Philadelphia (Lpg, USA) [5], Lens
(Lpl, France) and Paris (Lpp, France) [6], Corby (Lpc,
England) [7] and Alcoy (Lpa, Spain) (reported in this
work). As with the majority of other pathogenic Legionella strains, immunoassay analysis defined them as
belonging to the serogroup 1 [8]. A phylogeny based
on Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) showed that
all strains are closely related, Alcoy and Corby being
the closest [9].

Several features relating to the virulence of L. pneumophila are well known. For example, the mechanisms
responsible for entry into the macrophages [10,11], the
intracellular (host) trafficking of effectors [12] and the
membrane-associated protein involved in virulence
[9,13]. The data available disclose an almost complete
physiology of this organism and its relationships with
protozoa and human macrophages. An interesting question relating to L. pneumophila is its high rate of DNA
exchange, not only within species and other closelyrelated bacteria, but also with eukaryotic organisms [14].
Comparative genomics can give clues about the extent
of this process. Nowadays, the genome sequencing of
strains belonging to the same species offers the possibility of defining their pangenome, which helps in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of microbial species.
The pangenome comprises the core-genome, made up
of the genes shared by all strains, and the accessory or
dispensable genome compartment, consisting of the
genes that are strain-specific or shared by only some of
the strains [15]. Pangenome studies can disclose characteristics that are not easily perceptible using standard
annotation analysis [16]. For example, pangenome studies have facilitated identification of virulence factors or
anti-drugs systems in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus
agalactiae [17,18]. The dispensable genome compartment can provide evidence of lateral gene transfer
events that have occurred during the evolutionary history of a strain, probably offering additional evolutionary
potential to the organism.
In this work, we report the main genomic features of
L. pneumophila strain Alcoy 2300/99 and compare it
with the four previously sequenced strains. A detailed
description of the L. pneumophila pangenome is provided, and strain-specific features are catalogued in
terms of “islands”. Several islands containing virulence
factors were identified and, where possible, their evolutionary origins were also hypothesized. Although the
strains are phylogenetically closely related, the pangenomic approach allowed identification of distinctive

features, such as anti-drug related islands, strain-specific
transport or secretion systems, DNA transfer-related
islands, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats) systems, and integrated phage
insertions.

Results and Discussion
General features of the L. pneumophila Alcoy (Lpa)
genome

A total of 36,974 and 215,350 sequences were obtained
by the Sanger method (with an average length of
781 nt) and 454-technology (with an average length of
242 nt), respectively. The contigs were finally assembled
in one continuous strand, with average consensus coverage of 22.1 ×. The Lpa chromosome length was of
3,516,335 base pairs, and 3,197 open reading frames
were identified. The GC content was 38% and 1,175 predicted proteins were found to have unknown functions,
representing 36.7% of all CDSs. Similar to Lpc and Lpg
genomes, no plasmids were found in Lpa. Table 1 summarizes the main features of this genome compared to
the other four L. pneumophila sequenced strains.
Pangenome of L. pneumophila

Figure 1 summarizes the results obtained from comparing the five complete genomes of pathogenic L. pneumophila strains in relation to the orthologs/accessory gene
distribution. The pangenome consists of 2,957 CDS with
a core of 1,979 genes (66.9%) and a dispensable genome
of 978 CDSs (33.1%). A total of 342 genes were found
to be specific to the Lpa (53), Lpc (48), Lpg (88), Lpl
(64) and Lpp (98) genomes. It is worth mentioning that
287 out of these 342 accessory genes (83.9%) were
hypothetical proteins.
Lpa and Lpc are the strains that share most genes;
2,560 out of 3,196 in Lpa (80%) and 3,207 in Lpc
(79.8%). This result is in agreement with the phylogenetic tree obtained using MLST [9]. Compared with the
remaining genomes, Lpa and Lpc share 2,208 (69.1%)
and 2,181 (68%) genes with Lpl; 2,271 (71.1%) and 2,284

(71.2%) with Lpp; and 1,802 (56.4%) and 1,776 (55.4%)
with Lpg, respectively. Similarly, Lpp and Lpl also seem
to be close-related with a shared genome of 2,207 genes
out of 2,877 for Lpl (76.7%) and 3,026 for Lpp (73%).
Finally, Lpg seems to be the most distantly related, sharing 2,207 genes with Lpl (75%) and 1,792 (60.1%) with
Lpp.
Figure 2 shows the application of the rarefaction
methodology on the gene clusters from multiple genomes belonging to the same species. L. pneumophila
tends to reach a plateau, although, according to Tettelin
and collaborators [18], it should be considered an open
pangenome similarly to what happens in other pathogenic organisms, such as the pangenomes from the
same species of Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pyogenes
and Staphylococcus aureus [18,19]. In the case of E. coli,
despite the growing number of complete genomes, its
pangenome is still far from fully described [17]. It has
also been reported that clinically related pathogenic bacteria posses a lower level of variation than free-living

bacteria, which is probably due to niche restriction that
could lead to a wider core genome [20,21].
Functional classification of core and dispensable genes

Genes belonging to the core and dispensable genomes
have been classified according to their predicted function based on COG categories (Figure 3). L. pneumophila is characterized by quite a high number of
hypothetical proteins, for which annotation is still
incomplete. Of the 1,979 genes belonging to the core
genome, 1,131 (57%) were attributed to a COG category
(e value less than 10-15), and in the case of dispensable
genome, only 179 out of 978 (18.2%). These results are
in agreement with those obtained in other studies,
where hypothetical genes, and even genes with unknown
function are, in the majority, in the dispensable genome
[18]. Although the major proportion of the CDSs for
which a function could be predicted (according to the
COG database) falls within the core genome, minor differences between the two compartments were observed

for defense mechanisms (V) and intracellular trafficking,
secretion and vesicular transport (U) categories.
Genomic islands

Although the five strains are highly syntenic, most of the
genes that do not belong to the core genome are part of
genomic islands, absent in at least one of the genomes.
Table 2 reports the islands identified for each strain, Figure 4 describes the island positions for each genome following Table 2 classifications, while Figure 5a shows the
hypothesis of islands histories according to the MLST
tree topology obtained by D’Auria et al. [9]. Figure 5b
shows the alignment of the five genomes, the locally collinear blocks and the position of the islands according to
their genome locations. Twenty-eight islands were identified belonging to six different types (see Additional
File 1). Only one island (R1, see below) is present in all
five genomes; eighteen are strain-specific, probably
acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events; five
are common to Lpa/Lpc genomes (probably acquired by
the Lpa/Lpc common ancestor), whereas one island
(DT3, see below) could be interpreted as having been lost
in the common ancestor of Lpa/Lpc genomes.
Resistance-related islands (R)

We have identified two types of resistance-related
islands, R1 and R2 (see Figure 4 and Figure 5, blue

track). R1 maintains the same position, around 60 Kb at
the beginning of the chromosome, in the five strains,
inserted in a tRNA asn site, although the organization
and content is different. In Lpa, Lpc and Lpg, the island
is similar and contains several hypothetical proteins as
well as a methylase (lpa00094, LPC_0075, lpg0060), followed by a multi-drug resistance protein (lpa00095,
LPC_0076, lpg0061). In the Paris strain, the island also
begins with a methylase (lpp0063) and in the Lens strain
with a putative transposase (lpl0064). However, although
the position of the gene coding for the methylase is
quite similar in both genomes, the alignment is different, due to a relatively big deletion in Lpl, whereas in
Lpp it is followed by the antibiotic persistence-related
system HipB/HipA (lpp0065, lpp0064) with no homolog
in other Legionella strains. Although the mechanism of
this system is still not well known, much evidence
points to HipA as a toxin with bacteriostatic activity
which binds DNA/RNA, blocking macromolecule synthesis until HipB binds HipA, releasing the DNA/RNA so
microbial cells can survive extended exposure to drugs
[22,23]. This island is followed by various phage-related
proteins, elements of the Xre family of transcriptional
regulators, an LvrA protein, and three transporters
(lpp0077, lpp0078, lpp0079) of which the lpp0077 is
similar to the acriflavine multi-drug efflux pump [24].

Finally, the island ends with three hypothetical proteins
and an IS4-family transposase (lpp0083). Several genes
such as the TraK, the LvrA-related protein and the
phage-related integrases are also maintained in the same
positions in the Alcoy, Corby, Lens and Philadelphia
strains. A similar system (R2), was also found in the
Lens strain. It is a small region containing transposases
as well as two homologs of a stability system StbDE
(lpl1587, lpl1588). This island was originally associated
with plasmids [25], but it has also been found on the
chromosomes of other pathogenic bacteria [26].
Transport/secretion systems (TS)

Only one TS island has been found in the Lpa and Lpc
genomes. TS1 in the Alcoy strain is composed of 16
ORFs (lpa01590 to lpa01614). Three of these ORFs,
lpa01601, lpa01599 and lpa01598, are related to the
cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux HelABC transport system
that provides resistance against these heavy metals [27].
They are followed by lpa01604, which codes for the
metallo-regulator ArsR that, in the presence of metals,
derepresses the operator/promotor DNA, thereby activating the transcription of downstream genes [28]. As

happens in other islands, this ends with a phage integrase and three transposase-related ORFs, indicating a
possible exogenous origin in Legionella. It is worth mentioning that all five genomes carry a HelABC operon
belonging to the core genome, while Alcoy and Corby
strains also possess the two additional above-mentioned
systems.
In the Corby strain, TS1 is bigger than in the Alcoy,
spanning about 50 kb. It contains the previously mentioned HelABC operon (LPC_1847- LPC_1849), in addition to the HelABC systems present as part of the core
genome (LPC_02269, LPC_02270, LPC_02271), a transposase (LPC_1856) and a phage repressor protein
(LPC_1857). The first 9 ORFs of the TS1c island
(mainly hypothetical proteins and one transposase) are
syntenic with the Paris ND9 island (see below). The
island continues for about 19 kb with apparently no synteny with other genomes and then regains synteny with
the Paris ND10 island.
Interestingly, the TS1a-HelABC genes seem to be
more similar to the core Lpl operon than to that of Lpc
TS1 while TS1c-HelABC genes are more similar to

those of the Lpg genome. Conversely, core HelABC
genes in Lpa and Lpc are highly related.
DNA transfer-related islands (DT)

Three DT islands have been identified (DT1, DT2 and
DT3). DT1 and DT2 correspond to the Trb-2 and Trb-1
islands described by Glöckner and collaborator for the
Corby strain [7]. We have found that both islands are
also present in the Alcoy strain, although DT2a is
shorter than DT2c, thus suggesting that Lpa and Lpc
acquired these systems via DNA transfer prior to their
divergence (see Figure 5, green track). Some remarkable
features of DT1 are: a phage repressor (lpa00219,
LPC_0166), a set of tra and trb (conjugal transfer proteins) operons, a putative lamboid prophage Rac integrase (lpa00266, LPC_0199), another integrase
(lpa00270, LPC_0202), an htpX protease (lpa00275,
LPC_0205), and a prophage regulatory protein alpA
(lpa00278, LPC_0208). In the DT2 island, both strains
share a putative RNA helicase (lpa00835, LPC_2785),

two putative restriction enzymes (LPC_2788, LPC_2790,
lpa00832, and lpa_00829) and the set of the tra and trb
operons. Glöckner and collaborators [7] described that
Trb-1 (here DT2) is active and could be transferred to
other Legionella. In both genomes, DT1 and DT2 are
integrated, respectively, at the tmRNA and tRNA pro
sites.
Finally, we have identified a DNA transfer island, DT3,
in all strains with the exception of the Corby and Alcoy
ones. It is worth mentioning that this island was previously described in Lpg and Lpp, as an integrated plasmid-like element [5,29]. It contains lvh (Legionella vir
homolog), a type IV secretion system involved in conjugation [30,31]. The lvr (Legionella vir region) is located
downstream where LvrA is homologous to the CsrA
repressor, important for the inhibition of post-exponential phase activity (such as DNA transfer) [32]. A
CRISPR system was identified at the beginning of this
island.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
(CRISPR) systems (C)

CRISPR are bacteriophage resistance systems [33] that
have been identified in the Alcoy and Lens (C1), and in
Paris (C2) strains (Figure 5, pink track). Lpl also possesses one almost identical CRISPR system on the plasmid. Phylogenetic analyses reveal how Alcoy CAS
(CRISPR-associated genes) genes are more closely
related to the ones on the plasmidic CRISPR of the
Lens strain than to the chromosomal one. The CAS
genes identified were Cas1 (lpl2837, plpl0052, lpa01472),
Cas3-helicase (plpl0051, lpl2838, lpa01473), and
lpa01474 and lpa01475, which are two conserved proteins in bacteria, but with no relatives in other Legionella genomes. lpa01476, plpl0047 and lpl2842 belong
to the CRISPR-associated Csy4 family proteins (see
Additional file 2). Downstream of this cluster of proteins
begins the repeats of the CRISPR system (see Additional
file 3). The Alcoy and Lens strain repeats are almost
identical, except for one base (adenine in the Alcoy
strain and cytosine in the Lens, GTT(A/C)ACTGCCGCACAGGCAGCTTAGAA). Fifty-seven direct repeats
were found in Lpa, while 53 in the Lpl plasmid, and two
clusters of 52 and 12 on the Lpl chromosome. None of
the Alcoy spacers were found to be similar to other
spacers from the CRISPR database [34].
The Paris strain genome hosts a CRISPR system,
located at the beginning of the DT3 island. The first

Page 8 of 13

CRISPR-related protein is coded by lpp0160 and shows
a weak similarity to a putative CRISPR-associated large
protein. The cluster is followed by Cas1 (lpp0161), Cas2
(lpp0162), Cas4 (lpp0163) and 34 direct repeats. Interestingly, the repeats and the CRISPR-associated genes
are not related to the ones found in the Lpa and Lpl
genomes.
Phage related islands (PR)

Up to seven different phage-related islands have been
found. The Alcoy and Corby strains share PR1 and PR3
whereas all the other PR islands are strain-specific. PR1
in Lpa and Lpc are almost syntenic and could be considered an ancient infection that took place before the split
of the two lineages; a related region is also present in Lpg
genome. This island contains several phage-related proteins, several transposases belonging to the IS4 family, an
MviN virulence factor (lpa01685, LPC_2173, lpg1087), as
well as other not well-defined proteins containing DNA
cleavage or binding related domains. The MvinN-related
protein is additional, but not equivalent to the constitutive one present on the chromosomes (see Additional file
4) of the five strains (lpa0385, LPC_0506, lpg2635,
lpl2560, and lpp2688). MvinN has been described as an
important factor of virulence in Salmonella typhimurium
and Burkholderia pseudomallei [35]. Although its role in
pathogenicity is still not clear, this protein is a homolog
of the proposed lipid II flippase protein [36,37] that has
no virulence activity.

appearance according to the tree topology obtained by the phylogenetic analysis. Each color is related to island type (see legend). On the right

with identical colors in forward and reverse strands; diagonal lines connect homologous blocks from each genome; colored blocks (according to
island-type) on the light pink area between strands indicate the position of each island.

D’Auria et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:181
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/181

PR2 is specific to the Philadelphia strain and relies on
a probable hot spot region. It contains six residual
transposase-related ORFs followed by four hypothetical
proteins that correspond to the beginning of the DT1ac
islands.
PR3, as stated above, has been found only in the
Corby and Alcoy strains. It begins with an ankyrin
repeat-containing protein (LPC_1606, lpa03089).
Ankyrin-domain-containing proteins have a eukaryotic
origin and are related to intracellular trafficking. In
Legionella ankyrin-containing proteins may be secreted
by the Dot/Icm system and could play a role in intracellular bacterial replication [14,38]. The island also
contains several hypothetical proteins (LPC_1607LPC_1615, lpa03090-lpa03095) and a transposase
(LPC_1616, lpa03096).
PR4 is specific to the Lens strain genome and spans
around 29 kb. It seems to be a residual plasmid integrated into the chromosome, based on the presence of
several proteins relating to DNA organization, such as
lpl1068 containing SNF2-related protein domains that
seem to be similar to helicases, and an Omp/MotB
domain-containing protein (lpl1070) that may be related
to structural flagella membrane proteins. Several phagerelated proteins and transposases were found, together
with another predicted inner membrane protein
(lpl1073). Moreover, this island contains an ORF similar
to DNA damage-inducible protein J (lpl1084), and the
last two ORFs (lpl1092 and lpl1093) have high homology
to other plasmid maintenance killer/antidote systems.
The latter has been identified in several gram-negativerelated plasmids and it is known as a regulator of bacterial programmed cellular death, although in some cases (e.
g. E. coli) it is also integrated into the chromosome [39].
The Alcoy-specific island PR5 is integrated into a
[CAT]-tRNAile site. The first three ORFs code for proteins related to transposases, whereas the remainder
code for hypothetical proteins with no clear function.
None of these proteins appear to have any relationship
with other Legionella-related ORFs, and seem to be a
clear case of acquisition by HGT. Three genes with no
clear function, TraK gene (lpa03390), an inner membrane protein (lpa03394), and one hypothetical protein
(lpa03395), have been found to be syntenic with the Lpg
and Lpl genomes (lpg2365, lpg2366, and lpg2367;
lpl0071, lpl0070, and lpl006, respectively). lpa03400 is
similar to a phage-related integrase. The next ORFs (on
the reverse strand) are related to a cluster of genes
involved in bacilysin synthesis, known as one of the simplest antibiotic peptides active against some bacteria and
fungi [40] (see Additional file 5).
PR6 in the Philadelphia genome includes homologs of
a type IV secretion system, mobile genetic elements, and

Page 9 of 13

virulence factors. It has been described in detail by Brassinga and collaborator (2003) as a 65 kb pathogenicity
island [41].
Finally, the island PR7 in the Paris genome codes
almost exclusively for hypothetical proteins. Only a
putative primase/helicase (lpp2117), and a phage integrase (lpp2123) homolog seems to relate this island to
phage integration with an unpredicted function.
Not defined island (ND)

Up to thirteen islands, for which it has not been possible to establish a clear role, have been identified.
Interestingly, all but one (ND11 in Lpa and Lpc), are
strain-specific islands. ND1, ND2, ND3, ND8, ND9,
and ND10 are found in the Paris genome. ND1 hosts
a complete cytochrome o cluster (subunits II, I, III, IV
on lpp0294, lpp0295, lpp0296, lpp0297, respectively)
and a glycine/betaine transporter. ND2 contains
hypothetical proteins, a CsrA (Carbon storage regulator), and is located close to the chromosomal heavy
metals regulatory genes (HelABC). ND3 is formed by
two hypothetical proteins followed by the HupE/UreJ
membrane protein (lpp12118), homologs of Nickel/
Cobalt type II transport systems [42]. These elements
are followed by a thiocyanate hydrolase cluster for
subunits gamma, alpha and beta (lpp1219, lpp1220
and lpp122, respectively) that were previously identified as unique to the Paris genome when compared to
that from Lens [6]. This enzyme is the first key step
in thiocyanate degradation and it is important in the
detoxification processes [43]. ND8 is a small island
composed mainly of transposases. Finally, for ND9
and ND10, it was not possible to propose a role. ND4
and ND5 are specific to the Philadelphia strains. ND4
is a small island containing hypothetical proteins and
transposases, whereas ND5 contains a whole set of
transposases and phage integrases as well as hypothetical proteins. ND6 and ND13 are specific to the
Corby strain. ND6 spans a 7 kb region in the Corby
genome with no apparently exogenous genes; it contains mainly hypothetical proteins, although some
ORFs seem to be related to acetyltransferases. ND13
is syntenic with the terminal part of the Lpp island
ND10 and, similarly, consists of hypothetical proteins.
ND11 was found to be syntenic in both the Alcoy and
Corby genomes and contains transposases and
hypothetical proteins. ND7 and ND12 islands were
found only in the Lens strains. ND7 is another not
well-defined island consisting mostly of hypothetical
proteins. It contains an ORF related to filamentation
induced by a cAMP protein (lpl2288), an incomplete
homolog of a HipA system, as well as the R1p island
HipA/HipB system. Finally ND12 is made up exclusively of hypothetical proteins.

Conclusions
The virulence and persistence of L. pneumophila are
mainly due to specific mechanisms coded by part of its
core genome that makes L. pneumophila able to infect,
survive and replicate in macrophages [14,44-46]. Lpc
has been described as one of the most virulent strains
[47], while Lpp is responsible for sporadic cases but is
frequently recognized worldwide [48]. Lpl was responsible for important outbreaks in France during 2003-2004
with 86 registered cases resulting in 17 deaths [6].
Finally, although the Lpg strain was the first one isolated
for which the genome sequence was defined, it turned
out to be not so virulent as the other [49].
Comparative genomics of five strains isolated in different parts of the world of L. pneumophila disclosed
the presence of several HGT-related islands and an
evident history of recombination events. Here, we
reported a number of features connected to virulence
that could have been exchanged, or acquired by the
strains along with their evolution. The traces of these
events are mainly part of the dispensable genome
compartment.
The islands encountered from the dispensable pangenome compartment of the five genomes revealed factors
that can give additional virulence to each strain. Alcoy
and Corby strains are those in which more islands have
been found related to virulence and DNA transfer activities. Multi-drug efflux systems have been found in Lpa,
Lpc and Lpg, while stability systems have been found in
Lpl and Lpp genomes (R1). Lpa and Lpc strains are
probably potentially more resistant in the presence of
heavy metals, due to an additional HelABC system in
the TS1 island. Moreover, Lpa and Lpc seem to have
acquired, before to their lineage split, the ability to be
more successful in DNA transfer by the DT1ac and
DT2ac systems. Interestingly, Alcoy strain also acquired
a complete bacilysin system (PR5 island), probably by
precedent phage contact after separation from the
Corby lineage, which could represent an environmentally competitive advantage for this virulent strain. Lpa,
Lpc the Lpg also carry an additional Mvin virulence factor, although there is no experimental evidence of its
activity (island PR1). Moreover Alcoy, as well as Lens
and Paris, proved to carry phage resistance systems
(CRISPR on C1al and C2p islands). Several additional
specific features have also been reported, although their
role could not be predicted.
Finally, the data reported in this work show that the
Alcoy strain possesses additional features, making it different from other previously sequenced genomes, even
with the most closely related Corby strain. This finding
could be related to the recurrent and sometimes mortal
outbreaks recorded in the Spanish town of Alcoy.

Methods
Strains used in this work

L. pneumophila strain Alcoy 2300/99 was isolated from
sputum of a patient with Legionnaires’ disease (LD) and
associated with the LD outbreak detected in Alcoy
(Spain) in 1999. It belongs to the most predominant serogroup 1 [8]. The same strain was further isolated in
other successive LD outbreaks in 2000 and 2002. The
publicly available genomes of L. pneumophila used for
comparison were retrieved from GenBank database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html.
Abbreviations and accession numbers are reported in
Table 1.
DNA extraction, shotgun clone libraries and sequencing

DNA from L. pneumophila Alcoy was extracted as
described in D’Auria et al. (2008) [9]. Cloning and
sequencing were carried out as follows: two libraries
(inserts of 1-2 and 2-10 Kb) were generated by sonication of genomic DNA, followed by cloning of the fragments using the TOPO XL PCR Cloning Kit
(Invitrogen, #K4700-10). Plasmid DNA purification was
done with a Montage Plasmid Miniprep96 kit (Millipore,
#LSKP09624) on a MULTIPROBE II-Robot Liquid
Handling System (Packard Bioscience). Sequencing reactions were mainly performed using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator v3.0 Ready Reactions Kit and resolved
using the 3730 Xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To complete the assembly we used 454 pyrosequencing (Roche) performed on one half of a GS-FLX
PicoTiter plate, obtaining a total of 52 Mb. The combination of both sequencing methods allowed the genome
to be defined in 4 contigs. Finally, inverse PCR was
employed to fill the remaining gaps and close the
genome.
Genome assembly and annotation

Base-calling of each Sanger read was carried out with
the “Pregap4” interface from Staden Package [50]. All
reads were then checked manually by the “Trev” program and the assembly of Sanger sequences was performed by Cap4 program, both from the Staden
Package [50]. The 454 reads were assembled by the
Newbler assembler http://www.roche-applied-science.
com and then integrated with the previous Sanger
assembly. Open reading frame predictions were carried
out with the Glimmer3 program [51] assigning the “lpa”
locus tag to each sequence. All CDSs were searched by
BLAST [52] searches against the non-redundant GenBank database, the Cluster of Orthologous Groups [53]
and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
[54]. Annotation was then improved by homology
searches against previously sequenced genomes of the

D’Auria et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:181
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/181

Philadelphia, Lens, Paris and Corby strains (see Table 1
for genome accession numbers). Ribosomal genes were
identified by BLAST searches against “nt” databases.
tRNAs were identified by the tRNAscanSE software [55].
tRNA genes with anticodon CAT (tRNAIle, tRNAMet
and tRNAfMet) were identified by the method described
by Silva and collaborators [56].
Comparative analyses

CDSs from each genome were considered orthologous
when reciprocal BLAST best hits gave at least 70% of
overlap with a minimum of 80% similarity. A catalogue
of orthologs was compiled. GenomeViz2 software was
employed to draw genome plots [57]. Several Perl
scripts were compiled in our laboratory for massive data
handling (available upon request).
To define the coverage of the L. pneumophila pangenome, rarefaction curves were calculated from pools of
CDS from each genome. In ecology, rarefaction is a
technique applied in order to standardize and compare
species richness computed from samples of different
size [58]. Here, it is applied to compare gene cluster
richness among multiple genomes from the same species. The L. pneumophila pangenome was then compared with pangenomes from strains belonging to E. coli
(8 genomes), Streptococcus pyogenes (8 genomes), Staphylococcus aureus (9 genomes), Streptococcus agalactiae (8 genomes)(accession numbers are reported in
Additional file 6). For each genome BLASTCLUST software was used to define gene clusters (70% similarity
and 70% overlap). Gene abundance within each cluster
was used to calculate rarefaction curves by the RarefactWin.exe http://www.uga.edu/~strata/software/Software.
html program.
A comparative analysis among the five strains has
been carried out using the Mauve, multiple genome
alignment software [59].
Pangenome distribution

All CDSs from each genome were pooled together and
clustered by CD-HIT-EST software with at least 70% of
overlapping and a minimum of 80% similarity [60]. One
gene from each cluster was characterized by RPSBLAST
best match (e-values lower than 10-15) against the COG
database (Cluster of Orthologous Groups, [53]).
Determination of specific islands

Discontinuity of the homology (synteny) between CDSs
from a given genome and its ortholog in every comparison were considered to define an island. Generally,
islands were defined when more than 5 consecutives
CDSs were found to be specific for one strain. Syntenic
Alcoy/Corby orthologous genes which did not match in

Page 11 of 13

the other three genomes were also considered islands.
Islands were named according to their proposed function. A lowercase letter was added to the end of the
name referring to the genome to which it belonged and
letters were chosen according to the official locus tag
definition (“a” for Alcoy, “c” for Corby, “g” for Philadelphia, “l” for Lens and “p” for Paris; e.g. “TS1a": Transport/Secretion island number 1 from the Alcoy
genome). Due to the fact that the original annotations
of Lpc, Lpg, Lpl and Lpp genomes often report CDSs as
“hypothetical protein”, similarity searches of genes
within these islands were carried out against an updated
Refseq (GenBank) database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/RefSeq/.
Additional file 1: Presence/absence of islands among the five
considered genomes. The presence or absence of a given island
(column headers) is reported for every genome (line). Orange island is
common to all strain, blue islands are strain-specific islands, red islands
are common to Lpa and Lpc genomes, the green island is present in
Lpp, Lpg and Lpl but not in Lpa or Lpc genomes. For the other is not
possible to make a clear hypothesis about their origin.

Additional file 5: Bacilysin containing island from Alcoy genome.
Bacilysin cluster begins with an ORF homolog of a phospho-2-dehydro-3deoxyheptonate aldolase, which is an intermediate of the synthesis of
chorismate (lpa03410); the next four ORFs are homologs of bacilysin
biosynthesis BacA (lpa03409), BacB (lpa03408), BacC (lpa03407) and BacC
(lpa03406); lpa03405 is a transporter of the multidrug/metabolite
exporter family; lpa0304 is a purine metabolism-related protein. lpa03404
and lpa3403 are related to chorismate mutase and the subsequent
amino-transferase could be related to the final steps in bacilysin
biosynthesis [61]. Located further along the island, lpa03412 is a
homolog of an S24-like peptidase, followed by two hypothetical proteins
and a bacteriocin adenylyltransferase (lpa03416). The PR5 island ends
with an IS10-related transposase, lpa03419, two hypothetical proteins and
a phage related integrase (lpa03425). This island demonstrates evidence
of cluster acting in bacilysin-like bacteriocin production that is specific to
the Alcoy genome.
