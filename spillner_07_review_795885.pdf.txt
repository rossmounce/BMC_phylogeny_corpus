Overview
The main theme of the book is mathematical models of
evolutionary processes in biology. These models have
become increasingly complex in order to cope with the
various aspects involved in the study of these processes
and involve a wide range of concepts from different areas
of mathematics and computer science. This book gives an
overview of some of the key contemporary topics in the
field. The book is organized in 10 chapters, each written
by an expert or a group of experts on the topic addressed
in that chapter. At the end of many chapters directions for
future research are discussed. Each chapter comes with its
own list of references. At the end of the book the reader
can find an index that helps to locate quickly the context
within which a particular concept appears.

Contents
The book starts with a brief introduction by the editors.
They outline how the discovery of biological processes
such as alternative splicing and lateral gene transfer have
changed our view of evolution and how this has led to
very complex models of evolutionary processes in biology. The editors emphasize that a better understanding of
these processes is of great value for solving problems such
as the prediction of protein function from genomic
sequences or biodiversity conservation planning.
The first two chapters are grouped together under the
headline Evolution in Populations. Chapter 1, by J. Felsen-

stein, first reviews the basic concept of coalescents, that is,
trees that describe the ancestral relationship between copies of genes formed in populations. Next, to obtain a more
realistic model, the effects of population growth, migration, recombination and natural selection are taken into
account. Then, inference methods based on the model are
reviewed and at the end of Chapter 1 the reader can find a
list of available coalescent programmes. Chapter 2, by A.
Rodrigo et al., is centered around the concept of measurably evolving populations, that is, populations for which
sequence data is obtained over time and a significant
accumulation of substitutions is found. The authors
review methods for constructing evolutionary trees and
estimating quantities such as substitution rate, population size and migration rate under these circumstances.
Chapters 3 and 4 are dedicated to Models of Sequence Evolution. The first part of Chapter 3, by O. Gascuel and S.
Guindon, addresses the issue of variability of sequence
evolution, and the reader can find an extensive overview
of existing models that take this variability into account.
In the second part of the chapter, two data sets are used to
illustrate how these models can be employed to analyze
sequence data. In Chapter 4, by E. S. Allman and J. A.
Rhodes, the concept of phylogenetic invariants is reviewed.
The authors provide the reader with the necessary basic
terminology from algebraic geometry and then explain
how such invariants can be found and how they can help
to better understand models of sequence evolution.
Chapters 5 and 6, Tree Shape, Speciation, and Extinction,
focus on how to model diversification and assess biodiversity. In Chapter 5, by A. O. Mooers et al., several models are discussed for generating trees. The goal is to

generate trees whose shape is similar to that of evolutionary trees constructed from real biological data and,
thereby, to better understand the processes that lead to the
patterns found in those trees. Chapter 6, by K. Hartmann
and M. Steel, reviews a measure used in conservation
planning called phylogenetic diversity (PD). After presenting some of the mathematical properties of this measure
it is compared to other measures of biodiversity and issues
like the time scale for planning or budgetary constraints
are discussed. The chapter concludes with some statistical
properties of PD and its application in the reconstruction
of evolutionary trees.

ground knowledge. Depending on this background
knowledge, some readers aiming to understand in depth
the methods and results discussed will probably need to
consult the original papers. In conclusion, the book can
serve as a very good reference for researchers in the field
and to some extent as a source where the reader searching
for an appropriate method to analyze a particular data set
can find some guidance.

Chapters 7 and 8 are devoted to problems arising in the
context of the reconstruction of Trees from Subtrees and
Characters. In Chapter 7, by M. J. Sanderson et al., the
problem of fragmentation of the data in large scale phylogenetic analysis as addressed and strategies to deal with
this problem are discussed. The problems studied in
Chapter 8, by S. Grünewald and K. T. Huber, arise from
the question: When does a data set support an evolutionary history that is tree-like? After formalizing this question, a collection of well known and also more recent
combinatorial results that answer this question is
reviewed, including characterizations of phylogenetic
trees in terms of chordal graphs and closure rules.
The last two chapters, From Trees to Networks, are motivated by the fact that the evolutionary history of some sets
of taxa is better represented by a network rather than a
tree. Chapter 9, by D. Huson, first gives a short overview
of which types of networks are currently used to represent
biological data. Then several methods for computing such
networks are reviewed. In Chapter 8, by C. Semple, the
basic problem is to find a network that can explain the
biological data involving a minimum number of hybridization events. A characterization of such networks as well
as the connection to several related optimization problems along with their computational complexity is discussed.

Summary
In my opinion the book has achieved the goal of the editors to give a detailed overview of key topics in molecular
evolution. As with any selection of topics, especially in a
field developing as rapidly as phylogenetics, there are certainly topics that have not been addressed but are (or
soon turn out to be) of equal importance such as, e.g., the
simultaneous construction of sequence alignments and
evolutionary trees. The material that is covered in the
book can serve as an entry point which leads the reader
quickly to the relevant literature and also provides some
help for how different approaches to a particular problem
compare to one another. It is certainly not a textbook and,
depending on the topic, requires a good deal of back-
