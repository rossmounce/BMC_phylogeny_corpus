Abstract
Background: The evolution of the full repertoire of proteins encoded in a given genome is mostly
driven by gene duplications, deletions, and sequence modifications of existing proteins. Indirect
information about relative rates and other intrinsic parameters of these three basic processes is
contained in the proteome-wide distribution of sequence identities of pairs of paralogous proteins.
Results: We introduce a simple mathematical framework based on a stochastic birth-and-death
model that allows one to extract some of this information and apply it to the set of all pairs of
paralogous proteins in H. pylori, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. It was
found that the histogram of sequence identities p generated by an all-to-all alignment of all protein
sequences encoded in a genome is well fitted with a power-law form ~ p-γ with the value of the
exponent γ around 4 for the majority of organisms used in this study. This implies that the intraprotein variability of substitution rates is best described by the Gamma-distribution with the
exponent α ≈ 0.33. Different features of the shape of such histograms allow us to quantify the ratio
between the genome-wide average deletion/duplication rates and the amino-acid substitution rate.
∗
Conclusion: We separately measure the short-term ("raw") duplication and deletion rates rdup ,
∗
rdel which include gene copies that will be removed soon after the duplication event and their

dramatically reduced long-term counterparts rdup, rdel. High deletion rate among recently duplicated
proteins is consistent with a scenario in which they didn't have enough time to significantly change
their functional roles and thus are to a large degree disposable. Systematic trends of each of the
four duplication/deletion rates with the total number of genes in the genome were analyzed. All
∗
but the deletion rate of recent duplicates rdel were shown to systematically increase with Ngenes.

Abnormally flat shapes of sequence identity histograms observed for yeast and human are
consistent with lineages leading to these organisms undergoing one or more whole-genome
duplications. This interpretation is corroborated by our analysis of the genome of Paramecium
tetraurelia where the p-4 profile of the histogram is gradually restored by the successive removal of
paralogs generated in its four known whole-genome duplication events.

Background
The recent availability of complete genomic sequences of
a diverse group of living organisms allows one to quantify
basic mechanisms of molecular evolution on an unprecedented scale. The part of the genome consisting of all protein-coding genes (the full repertoire of its proteome) is at
the heart of all processes taking place in a given organism.
Therefore, it is very important to understand and quantify
the rates and other parameters of basic evolutionary processes shaping thus defined proteome. The most important
of those processes are:
• Gene duplications that give rise to new protein-coding
regions in the genome. The two initially identical proteins
encoded by a pair of duplicated genes subsequently
diverge from each other in both their sequences and functions.
• Gene deletions in which genes that are no longer
required for the functioning of the organism are either
explicitly deleted from the genome or stop being transcribed and become pseudogenes whose homology to the
existing functional genes is rapidly obliterated by mutations.
• Changes in amino-acid sequences of proteins encoded
by already existing genes. This includes a broad spectrum
of processes including point substitutions, insertions and
deletions (indels), and transfers of whole domains either
from other genes in the same genome or even from
genomes of other species.
The BLAST (blastp) algorithm [1] allows one to quickly
obtain the list of pairs of paralogous proteins encoded in
a given genome whose amino-acid sequences haven't
diverged beyond recognition. The set of their percentage
identities (PIDs) is a dynamic entity that changes due to
gene duplications, deletions, and local changes of
sequences. Duplication events constantly create new pairs
of paralogous proteins with PID = 100%, while subsequent substitutions, insertions and deletions result in
their PID drifting down towards lower values. A paralogous pair disappears from this dataset if one of its constituent genes is deleted from the genome, becomes a
pseudogene, or when the PID of the pair becomes too low
for it to pass the E-value cutoff of the algorithm. Thus the
PID histogram contains a valuable if indirect information
about past duplications, deletions, and sequence divergence events that took place in the genome. In what follows we propose a mathematical framework allowing one

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/32

to extract some of this information and quantify the average rates and other parameters of the basic evolutionary
processes shaping protein-coding contents of a genome.
The list of all paralogous pairs generated by the all-to-all
alignment of protein sequences encoded in a given
genome is generally much larger than the list of pairs of
sibling proteins created by individual duplication events.
For example, a family consisting of F paralogous proteins
contributes up to F(F - 1)/2 pairs to the all-to-all BLAST
output, while not more than F - 1 of these pairs connect
the actual siblings to each other. The identification of the
most likely candidates for these "true" duplicates is in general a rather complicated task which involves reconstructing the actual phylogenetic tree for every family in a
genome. This goes beyond the scope of this study, where
we employ a much simpler (yet less precise) Minimum
Spanning Tree algorithm to extract a putative non-redundant subset of true duplicated (sibling) pairs.
The idea of quantifying evolutionary parameters using the
histogram of some measure of sequence similarity of
duplicated genes in itself is not new. It was already discussed by Gillespie (see [2] and references therein) and
later applied [3] to measure the deletion rate of recent
duplicates. There are two important differences between
our methods and those of the Ref. [3]:
• We use relatively slow changes in amino-acid sequences
of proteins as opposed to much faster silent substitutions
of nucleotides used in the Ref. [3]. This allows to dramatically extend the range of evolutionary times amenable to
this type of analysis.
• In addition to PID distributions in the non-redundant
set of true duplicated pairs used in the Ref. [3] we also
study that in the highly redundant set of all paralogous
pairs detected by BLAST. It turned out that both these distributions contain important and often complimentary
information about the quantitative dynamics of the
underlying evolutionary process. The shape of the latter
(all-to-all) histogram is to a first approximation independent of duplication and deletion rates and thus it
allows us to concentrate on fine properties of amino-acid
substitution.
The central results of our analysis are:
• The middle part of the PID histogram of all paralogous
pairs detected by BLAST is well described by a powerlaw
functional form with a nearly universal value of the exponent γ Ӎ -4 observed in a broad variety of genomes. Our
mathematical model relates this exponent to parameters
of intra-protein variability of sequence divergence rates.

• The analysis of various features of the PID histogram of
all paralogous pairs and that of a subset consisting of true
duplicated (sibling) pairs allows us to quantify both the
long-term average duplication and deletion rates in a
given genome as well as a dramatic increase in those rates
for recently duplicated genes.
• Abnormally flat PID histograms observed for yeast and
human are consistent with lineages leading to these
organisms undergoing one or more Whole-Genome
Duplications (WGD). This interpretation is corroborated
by the genome of Paramecium tetraurelia where the PID-4
profile of the sequence identity histogram is gradually
restored by the successive removal of paralogs generated
in its four known WGD events.

of paralogous proteins allows one to study the variability

Results
Distribution of sequence identities of all paralogous pairs
in a genome
We studied the distribution of Percent Identity (PID) of
amino acid sequences of all pairs of paralogous proteins
in complete genomes of bacteria H. pylori, E. coli, a singlecelled eukaryote S. cerevisiae, and multi-cellular eukaryotes C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. Every protein sequence contained in a given genome was attempted
to be aligned with all other sequences in the same genome
using the blastp algorithm [1]. To avoid including pairs of
multidomain proteins homologous over only one of their
domains we have filtered the data by only keeping the
pairs in which the length of the aligned region constitutes
at least 80% of the length of the longer protein. Infrequent
spurious alignments between different splicing variants of
the same gene or between proteins listed in the database
under several different names were dropped from our
final dataset. The exact details of our procedure are
described in the Methods section. Fig. 1A shows the histogram Na(p) of amino-acid sequence identities (PIDs) p of
all pairs of paralogous proteins encoded in different

• The upper part of the PID histogram corresponding to
recently duplicated pairs (PID>90%) deviates from this
powerlaw form. It is exactly this subset of paralogous pairs
that was extensively analyzed in Ref. [3]. This feature is
consistent with the picture of frequent deletion of recent
duplicates proposed in Ref. [3].

teins they encode. Several versions of such models were
previously studied [4-7] most recently in the context of
powerlaw distribution of family sizes. Our model extends
these previous attempts by concentrating on evolution of
sequence identities as opposed to just the number of proteins in different families.

• Region I: There is a sharp and significant upturn in the
PID histogram above roughly 90–95% compared to what
one expects from extrapolating Na(p) from lower values of
p. Apparently the constants (or possibly even mechanisms) of the dynamical process shaping Na(p) are different in this region.

Amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions cause
the sequence identity of any given pair of paralogous proteins to decay with time. Consider two paralogous proteins with PID = p × 100% aligned against each other. In
the simplest possible case changes in their sequences happen uniformly at all amino acid positions at a constant
rate µ = const. The effective "substitution" rate µ combines
the effects of actual substitutions and short indels. The
PID of this paralogous pair changes according to the equation dp/dt = -2µp. The factor two in the right hand side of
this equation comes from the fact that substitutions can
happen in any of the two proteins involved, while the factor p – from the observation that only changes in parts of
the two sequences that remain identical at the time of the
given change lead to a further decrease of the PID. This
equation results in an exponentially decaying PID: p(t) ~
exp(-2µt). More generally the drift of PID could be
described by the equation dp/dt = -v(p). When substitution
rate varies for different amino acids within the same protein the relationship between v(p) and p would in general
be non-linear. For our immediate purposes we will leave
it unspecified. The negative drift of PIDs generates a pdependent flux of paralogous pairs down the PID axis
given by v(p)Na(p). The net flux into the PID bin of the

• Region II: This region covers the widest interval of PIDs
30% <p < 90%. Na(p) in this region can be approximated
by a power-law form of p-γ with γ ≈ 4 (shown as a dashed
line in Fig. 1A.) The best fits to the power-law form in the
Region II are listed in Table 1 and (with the exception of
yeast and human) they fall in the 3 – 5 range. The nearuniversality of the shape of the PID histogram is perhaps
best illustrated by an approximate collapse of PID histograms in different genomes when they are normalized by
the total number Ngenes(Ngenes - 1)/2, of all (both paralogous and non-paralogous) gene pairs in the genome (Fig.
1B).
• Region III: In this region p < 25 – 30% the histogram
Na(p) starts to deviate down from the p-γ powerlaw behavior. This decline is an artifact of the inability of sequencebased algorithms such as BLAST to detect some of the
bona fide paralogous pairs with low sequence identity.
This explanation is corroborated by the observation that
the exact position of the downturn of Na(p) in the region
III is determined by the E-value cutoff (see Additional file
1).
Birth-and-death model of the proteome evolution
In an attempt to interpret the empirical features of the PID
distribution described above we propose a simple stochastic birth and death model of the proteome evolution.
It consists of a sequence of random gene duplications,
deletions, and changes in amino-acid sequences of pro-

Our model also involves random gene duplication and
deletion events (birth and death of new protein-coding
genes) which happen at rates rdup and rdel correspondingly.
In Fig. 2B we illustrate the details of how a gene duplication event creates new pairs of paralogous proteins. When
a gene A is duplicated to A' a new pair of paralogs with
PID = 100% is created (dotted line) and added to the
rightmost bin of the PID histogram. Furthermore the
freshly created gene A' inherits both paralogous partners
(B and C) of the gene A. The PIDs of these two newly created paralogous pairs A'-B and A'-C (dashed lines) are also
added to the respective bins in the histogram. Thus a
duplication of any of the two paralogous genes with PID
= p among other things results in the creation of a new
pair of paralogs with the same PID. This process increases
Na(p) at a rate 2rdupNa(p). Similarly the deletion of any of
the two genes in this paralogous pair decreases Na(p) at
the rate 2rdelNa(p). The bin containing PID = 100% (p = 1)
has an extra flux term rdupNgenes from PIDs of the freshly
created pair of duplicated genes (A-A' in our example).
Here Ngenes is the total number of protein-coding genes in
the genome. Adding up contributions of the three main
processes (substitutions, duplications and deletions) one
gets

+ 2rdup N a(p, t ) − 2rdel N a(p, t ) + rdup N genesδ (p − 1).

In our model the total number of genes Ngenes in the
genome exponentially grows (or decays) according to
dNgenes/dt = (rdup - rdel)Ngenes. When the genome size of an
organism remains (approximately) constant with time
one can find the stationary asymptotic solution of the previous equation. In this case one must have rdup = rdel so
that the second term in the right hand side is equal to
zero.
In the case of an exponentially growing or shrinking
genome the stationary solution for Na(p, t) does not exist.
However, it exists for the histogram normalized by the
total number of protein pairs: It is easy to show that since
∂na(p, t)/∂t = (∂Na(p, t)/∂t)/[Ngenes(Ngenes - 1)/2] - 2(rdup rdel)Na(p, t)/[Ngenes(Ngenes - 1)/2] the equation for normalized PID histogram na(p, t) acquires an extra negative term
-2(rdup - rdel)na(p, t). This term exactly cancels the duplication and deletion terms in the equation for Na(p, t) and
considerably simplifies the equation for the normalized

(panel B) A single gene duplication event A → A' gives rise to three new paralogous pairs: A' - A, A' - B and A' - C. Immediately
after the duplication the pair A - A' has the PID = 100%, while PIDs of A' - B and A' - C are equal to those of A - B and A - C. Thus
the PID of every previously existing paralogous pair involving A gets duplicated along with the duplication A → A'.

Robustness of the functional form of Na(p) with respect to
assumptions used in the model
The birth-and-death model described above is based on a
simplified picture of genome evolution. In particular it
implicitly assumes:

(1)
In the steady state solution one has ∂na(p, t)/∂t = 0 = ∂/
∂p[v(p)na(p)] or
na(p) ~ Na(p) ~ 1/v(p).

(2)

The conjecture that the normalized PID histogram na(p) =
Na(p)/[Ngenes(Ngenes - 1)/2] indeed is nearly stationary during the course of evolution is corroborated by the fact that
all six na(p) curves in various genomes used in our study
approximately lie on top of each other in Fig. 1B (compared to unnormalized Na(p) shown in Fig. 1A).
Comparing the Eq. 2 with the empirical form of Na(p) ~
1/p4 in the region II of Fig. 1 one concludes that the drift
velocity in real genomes must obey v(p) ~ p4. Such a nonlinear dependence of v(p) could be explained by the variability of the effective substitution rate within proteins
(intra-protein variability). Assuming the intra-protein variability of substitution rates µ described by a PDF ρ(µ) one
gets the following expression for p(t) and v(t):

(4)

Eq. 3 is a generalization of the previously discussed exponential decay of p(t) derived for a constant substitution
rate µ. It simply weighs these exponentials by ρ(µ) – their
likelihood of occurrence. For any given ρ(µ) one could
exclude time from Eqs. 3 and 4 and express v as a function
of p. Such v(p) dependence could then be directly compared with the empirically derived formula. In the
absence of an analytical expression relating v(p) to (µ) one
is limited to use a trial-and-error method. We start with
Gamma-distributed ρ(µ) ~ µα-1 exp(-µ/µ0) which has been
predominantly used in the literature [8-10]. Inserting thus
defined ρ(µ) into Eqs. 3 and 4 one gets p(t) = (2µ0)-α/(t +
(2µ0)-1)α and v(t) = α(2µ0)-α/(t + (2µ0)-1)α+1 which leads
to v(p) ~ p(α+1)/α and thus to Na(p) ~ p-(α+1)/α.

• The neutrality of individual gene duplication and deletion events resulting in identical rates of these two processes in all paralogous families in the genome.
• Identical average amino-acid substitution rates µ0 in all
individual proteins.
Both of these assumptions are known to be not, strictly
speaking, true. Sequences of some "important" proteins
(e.g. constituents of the ribosome) are known to evolve
very slowly. Also, the families containing essential (lethal
knockout) genes were recently shown [11] to be characterized by higher average duplication and deletion rates than
those lacking such genes.
However, the validity of our main results goes well
beyond the validity of the approximations that went into
our birth-and-death model. The advantage of using the
histogram of sequence identities generated by the all-toall alignment (Na(p)) lies in its remarkable universality
and robustness. When the Eq. 2 is applied to individual
families one can see that family-to-family variation of
(and correlations between) the duplication rate rdup, the
deletion rate rdel, and the average substitution rate µ0 affect
only the prefactor in the powerlaw form of Na(p). Thus the
exponent γ = 1 + 1/α describing this powerlaw is very
robust with respect to assumptions of the model and
depends only to the exponent α quantifying the intra-protein variability of amino-acid substitution rates.
The exact mechanisms behind this apparent universality
of α are not entirely clear. Chances are that it is dictated
more by the protein physics rather than by organism-specific evolutionary mechanisms. A possible path towards
derivation of the exponent α from purely biophysical
principles starts with the results of Ref. [12], which models the effects of (correlated) multiple amino-acid substitutions on stability of the native state of a protein.
However, such analysis goes beyond the scope of the
present work and will be reserved for a future study.
Distribution of sequence identities of true duplicated pairs
A highly redundant dataset consisting of all paralogous
pairs present in the genome enabled us to quantify the
variability of intra-protein substitution rates. Another set
of important parameters describing proteome evolution
are average deletion/inactivation and duplication rates rdel
and rdup. As will be shown in the following, the reduced
non-redundant dataset consisting only of protein pairs

directly produced in duplication events allows us to estimate these rates.
To better understand the difference between those two
datasets we illustrate it with a simple example. The family
of four evolutionary related proteins A, B, C, D contributes six paralogous pairs to Na(p). This family was actually
created by three subsequent duplication events: first A
duplicated to give rise to B, then B duplicated to C and
finally C duplicated to D. Thus only three out of total six
paralogous pairs are directly produced in gene duplication
events. The actual number of duplicated pairs could be
even smaller if some intermediate genes were deleted in
the course of the evolution. In general a family consisting
of F proteins contributes at or around F(F - 1)/2 paralogous pairs to Na(p), but only F - 1 duplicated pairs to
Nd(p).
Nothing in the BLAST output for a given paralogous pair
contains any information if it should or should not be
included in the Nd(p). However, using the set of all
sequence identities of proteins for a given family one
could tentatively reconstruct the course of duplication
events that led to the appearance of this family. Generally
speaking, this is a rather complicated task involving
reconstructing the actual phylogenetic tree for every family in a genome. In this study we use a much simpler alternative based on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
algorithm (see Methods for more details). For each protein family this algorithm generates a tentative set of
duplication events in its past history. Numbers of pairs
included in Na(p) and Nd(p) distributions in different
organisms are listed in the Table 2.

gene A was duplicated. However, only the actual duplicated pair A-A' with initial PID of 100% (dotted line in
Fig. 2(B)) is included in the distribution of duplicated
pairs Nd(p). Thus the dynamics of Nd is described by

∂N d(p,t ) ∂
= [v(p)N d (p, t )] − 2rdel N d (p, t ) + rdup N genesδ (p − 1).
∂t
∂p

Once again the stationary solution exists for the normalized distribution. However, in this case the correct normalization factor is given by Ngenes and not Ngenes(Ngenes 1)/2 as for Na(p). Indeed, every duplication event increasing the number of genes by one adds just one duplicated
pair to Nd(p) but up to Ngenes pairs to Na(p). Thus the normalized PID histogram of duplicated pairs nd(p, t) = Nd(p,
t)/Ngenes evolves according to
∂n d(p,t ) ∂
= [v(p)n d (p, t )] − (rdup + rdel )n d (p, t ) + rdupδ (p − 1).

(5)
According to our empirical findings the average rate of
sequence divergence of paralogous proteins in most
organisms is described v(p) = 2 µ pγ, where µ is the substitution rate averaged over all amino-acid positions in all
proteins, and γ ≈ 4 is the exponent related to the intra-protein variability of µ. The steady state of Eq. 5: ∂nd/∂t = 0 is
satisfied by:

N d (p) ~ n d (p) =
The dynamics of the distribution of duplicated pairs Nd(p,
t) is described by simply excluding the duplication term
2rdupN (p, t) from the equation for Na(p, t). Indeed, this
term is caused by PIDs of non-duplicated paralogs A'-B
and A'-C (dashed lines in Fig. 2(B)) generated when a

our numerical model consists of a fixed number of "proteins" of identical lengths. At every timestep one takes the
sequence of a randomly selected protein and uses it to
overwrite the sequence of another randomly selected protein. This corresponds to a stationary genome case when
rdup = rdel. Each combined duplication/deletion event is
followed by random substitutions of several "aminoacids" (see Methods for details of our simulation). In the
beginning of the simulation each amino-acid position
within every protein was randomly assigned a substitution rate drawn from the Gamma-distribution with α = 1/
3. The proteome generated by this dynamical process is
periodically analyzed in terms of sequence identity of all
pairs of its proteins. The resulting distributions Na(p)
(filled circles) and Nd(p) (open circles) are shown in Fig.
3. They agree quite well with our theoretical predictions:
Na(p) ~ 1/p4 (solid line) and Nd(p) ~ 1/p4 exp(-rdel/[3µp3])
(dashed line). The best fit to Nd(p)/Na(p) generated in our
numerical simulation with A exp(-rdel/[3µp3]) gives rdel/µ
= 0.237 in excellent agreement with the actual value of
rdel/µ = 0.25 used in our simulation. This demonstrates
that evolutionary parameters can be successfully reconstructed from the shapes of Nd(p) and Na(p). This is especially encouraging in case of Nd(p) because of the

approximations that went into identifying true duplicated
(sibling) pairs by the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.
Fitting evolutionary parameters of real proteomes: the
long-term deletion rate
To estimate the average of deletion and duplication rates
we performed a two-parameter fit to the Nd(p)/Na(p) ratio

with A exp(-B/(γ - 1)pγ-1) (see Eqs. 2,6) in the 30% <p <
90% interval (region II in Fig. 1). Here A and B = (rdup +
rdel)/(2 µ ) are the two free fitting parameters. The exponent γ used in the fitting formula itself was obtained from
the best fit to Na(p) in the same region with the power-law
form p-γ (see column 3 in Table 1). The ratio rdel/ µ was
extracted from the best-fit value of B and the independently calculated duplication rate ratio rdup/ µ (see subsection below). It is listed in the sixth column of the Table 1.
Fitting evolutionary parameters of real proteomes: the
short-term deletion rate of recent duplicates
A very pronounced and reproducible feature in all organism-wide histograms is an abrupt drop as is lowered from
100% down to about 90–95% (region I in Fig. 1.) The
drop is as large as 30-fold in prokaryotes and is around 3to-10 fold in eukaryotes. It is subsequently followed by a
increase of in the region II which at low 25% (region III)
turns down again only due to limitations of our ability to
detect evolutionary related sequences. There exists several
possible explanations for this initial drop in the region I :

• The gene conversion process. In a gene conversion process a part or the whole sequence of one of the paralogous
genes is used as a template to modify the sequence of
another. It happens with a reasonable frequency only if
those two genes are sufficiently close to each other in their
sequences so that DNA repair mechanisms might mistakenly assume that one of them is the corrupted version of
the other. If gene conversion events are sufficiently common, the initial separation of a pair of freshly duplicated
genes may take a long time, as one of them would be getting constantly converted back to the other. This would
result in an abnormally small drift velocity v(p) for p close
to 100% and hence to an abnormally high Na(p) ~ 1/v(p).
Another, more plausible explanation is that freshly duplicated genes are characterized by a much higher deletion
∗
rate rdel Ŭ rdel [3]. Functional roles of such genes have not

had enough time to diverge from each other making each
of them more disposable than an average gene in the
genome. Indeed, for S. cerevisiae and C. elegans it was
empirically demonstrated [13,14] that the deletion or
inactivation of genes with a highly similar paralogous

no consequences for the survival of the organism than the
deletion/inactivation of genes lacking such a partner.

bin. The width of the bin is assumed to be small enough
so that the removal of genes from the bin due to deletion
is negligible in comparison to that due to the drift in their

sequences. Thus rdup / µ = 2Na(100%)/(Ngenes∆p). The

An estimate of the number of superfamilies in different
genomes
Any sequence-based method is bound to miss similarities
between some of the distant paralogs. The situation could
be somewhat improved [7] if one compares proteins'
three-dimensional structures which are conserved over
longer evolutionary times. The addition of previously
undetected paralogous pairs results in some of the
sequence-based families merging together to form larger
superfamilies. Our empirical observations allow us to estimate the number of such superfamilies contained in a
given genome. Indeed, the fraction of paralogous pairs
among all gene pairs in a genome consisting of NF mutually unrelated superfamilies is given by 1/NF. A rough estimate of NF is provided by extrapolation of the p-4
powerlaw into the Region III down to some cutoff PIDmin:

The exponent α in large individual families
The Gamma-distribution ~ µα-1 exp(-2µ/µ0) was traditionally used to model and fit the distribution of substitution
rates in individual families of proteins (this tradition goes
back to [16]). Our approach extends this approach to a
proteome-wide scale and demonstrates that beyond its
role as a ad hoc fitting function the Gamma-distribution
indeed provides an excellent quantitative description of
variability of intra-protein substitution rates.

The genome-wide value of the exponent α Ӎ 0.33
obtained in our analysis is consistent with its previous
estimates in large protein families. For example, the best
fits with the Gamma-distribution performed in Refs.
[9,10] resulted in the exponent α in the 0.2 – 0.4 range.
The authors of Ref. [8] quantified the variability of substitution rates using a large set of orthologous proteins in
different genomes (this should be contrasted with paralogous proteins used in our analysis). The fits with Gammadistribution resulted in a broad range of exponents α for
individual proteins. Still the distribution of exponents α
peaks around 0.25 (solid histograms in the Fig. 4 of Ref.
[8]).
In principle, our methods could be also applied to large
individual families of paralogous proteins. However, only
a few of the largest families in any genome contain sufficient number of paralogous pairs (up to F(F - 1)/2 in a
family of size F) to have a meaningful individual Na(p)
histogram. Fig. 5 shows the results of such analysis in C.
elegans with individual curves corresponding to Na(p) in
the 5 largest families of paralogous proteins. Without
exception all these histograms are well fitted by Cp-γ with
γLF Ӎ 5 – 6. This corresponds to the exponent α Ӎ 0.17 –
0.25, which is a somewhat lower than the exponent α =
0.33 that we observed for genomes as a whole.

Here A is the best fit to Na(p) with the p-4 in the region II.
Remarkably, the results of such calculation are roughly
genome independent. Using the lowest theoretical limit
PIDmin = 5% (the sequence identity of two unrelated
sequences composed of 20 amino-acids) results in the
effective number of superfamilies NF ranging between 4.7
in C. elegans and 9.9 in D. melanogaster. A more realistic
limit PIDmin = 8% [7], which takes into account the nonuniform frequency among 20 amino-acids, somewhat
increases the number of superfamilies to 36, 28, 31, 19,
40, and 35 for H. pylori, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D.
melanogaster, and H. sapiens correspondingly. These numbers are still respectably small compared to NF Ӎ 1000
one gets by using the cutoff PIDmin = 25% imposed by the
inadequacy of sequence-based methods to detect similarity of remote paralogs.

plotted versus the total number of genes Ngenes in an organism. Organisms in the order of increasing number of genes
are H. pylori, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, C. elegans,
and H. sapiens. As explained in the text, more complex
organisms (those with larger Ngenes) tend to be characterized
by higher values of the first three ratios but lower values of
the last ratio.

Smaller individual families do not hold sufficient statistical power to analyze the shape of Na(p). One approach
would be to group them together by some shared characteristic (e.g. by their size, or by whether or not they contain an essential gene as described in Ref. [11]). However,
the Na(p) histogram in such a group would depend on
additional parameters such as the rate of creation and
removal of families of a given type and thus will not be
amenable to our type of analysis. For example the collection of families binned by their size would have additional birth-and-death events due to whole families
entering or leaving the selected bin. The rates of these
processes would have a non-trivial dependence on the age
of a family and thus cannot be easily incorporated into
our mathematical framework.
It is important to emphasize once again that the exponent
α quantifies only the intra-protein variability of substitution rates at different amino-acid positions within individual proteins. Such variability should not be confused
with a much larger protein-to-protein variability of average substitutions rates. Indeed, sequences of different pro-

positively correlated with the complexity of the organism
quantified by the total number of genes in its genome (see
correspondingly filled circles, open diamonds, and open
squares in Fig. 4). This means that either the per-gene
duplication rate in more complex organisms is consistently higher than in their simpler counterparts or that
their average amino-acid substitution rate is lower. It is
likely that both above trends operate simultaneously. One
possible explanation for the latter trend is that the more
sophisticated mechanisms of DNA copying and repair of
higher organisms lead to lower average amino-acid substitution rates.
On the other hand, we find that the deletion rate of recent

duplicates, rdel / µ , (filled triangles in Fig. 4) is negatively

teins encoded in the same genome are known to evolve at
vastly different rates (see [8,10] and references therein).
Some sequences, such as e.g. those of ribosomal proteins,
remain virtually unchanged over billions of years of evolution, while others change at a much faster pace. In fact,
the very importance of a protein is sometimes quantified
by its average rate of evolution as more essential proteins
involved in core cellular processes tend to evolve at slower
than average rates.
Genome size dependence and other properties of longand short-term duplication and deletion rates
Our data indicate that the long-term duplication rate rdup

is of the same order of magnitude as the long-term deletion rate rdel (see columns 5 and 6 in the Table 1). This is
to be expected since any large discrepancy in these rates
would generate much greater differences in genome sizes
than actually observed in these model organisms. However, as was proposed by [3], both of these rates are considerably smaller than their short-term ("raw")

correlated with the number of genes in the genome. This
result is in agreement with Ref. [17] where this trend was
attributed to the decrease in effective population size in
more complex organisms.
The effects of whole genome duplications on the
histogram of sequence identities
Two of the organisms used in our study (S. cerevisiae and
H. sapiens) are characterized by a dramatically lower value
of the power-law exponent γ (1.8 for yeast and 2.4 for
human) and the overall poor quality of the power law fit
to Na(p). One plausible explanation of this anomaly is in
terms of Whole Genome Duplications (WGD) in lineages
leading to these genomes. It is well established [18] that
baker's yeast underwent a WGD event, which most likely
occurred about 100 Myrs ago. While the subject remains
controversial, it is also commonly believed that the vertebrate lineage leading to H. sapiens (among many other
vertebrate genomes) also underwent one or several largescale duplication events [19,20]. In the immediate aftermath of a WGD event the PID distribution changes as fol-

(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:32

To further test this hypothesis we analyzed the recently
sequenced genome [21] of a ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia.
This organism underwent as many as four separately identifiable WGD events [21]. We used our standard methods
to construct the PID histogram Na(p) from the all-to-all
alignment of its nearly 40,000 genes. Due to the sheer size
of this proteome we employed the same conservative 1030 E-value cutoff we used for H. sapiens and C. elegans.
Solid diamonds in the Fig. 6 correspond to the full PID
histogram in Paramecium tetraurelia consisting of all
103,828 paralogous pairs detected by our methods.
Authors of Ref. [21] identified the lists of putative pairs of
duplicated genes generated in each of the four WGD
events in the lineage leading to this genome. By dropping
one randomly-selected gene from these WGD pairs we
generated the set of four progressively more narrow PID
histograms. These histograms are also shown in Fig. 6:
41,890 pairs excluding the genes generated in the latest
WGD event (solid squares), 25,342 pairs excluding the
genes generated in the last two WGD events (solid circles),
22287 pairs excluding the genes generated in the latest
three WGD events (open triangles), and 21,417 pairs
excluding the genes generated in all four WGD events (red
stars). For comparison, the Fig. 6 also reproduces the histogram of 31,078 pairs in the Na(p) of H. sapiens (blue ×es). One can see that progressive elimination of pairs generated in WGD events gives rise to the Na(p) histogram
approaching the universal scaling form: Na(p) ~ p-4 (the
dashed line in Fig. 6). Furthermore, the PID distribution
of gene pairs generated in each of the WGD events has a
shape that is qualitatively consistent with the predictions
of our birth-and-death model. In particular, the gene pairs
from the latest round of WGD did not have time to sufficiently diverge. As a result, their PID-distribution (shown
in black in the Fig. 3a of the Ref. [21]) has a peak around
95% sequence identity with a half-maximum at 75%. The
analysis of Paramecium tetraurelia genome provides an
additional strong support to our conjecture that the unusually flat PID histograms in human and baker's yeast are
caused by WGD events in lineages leading to these two
organims.

lows: Na(p) → 4Na(p) for p < 100%, while Na(100%) →
4Na(100%) + Ngenes. Indeed, every ancestral paralogous
pair A-B would give rise to 3 new pairs with the same PID:
A-B', A'-B, and A'-B'. At the same time the bin containing
the PID = 100% would in addition get Ngenes (or fewer for
a large segmental duplication) of freshly created duplicated pairs of the type A-A' and B-B'. The subsequent
spread of this sharp peak at PID = 100% towards lower
values of PID accompanied by a rapid deletion of redundant copies of duplicated genes would result in an effective flattening of the Na(p) histogram in its upper range
and thus in lower effective value of the exponent γ.

Other histograms shown in this plot correspond to a progressive removal of new proteins created in the four WGD

(open triangles), and 21,417 pairs among 22,635 proteins
excluding those generated in all four known WGD events
(red stars). For comparison we copy from Fig. 1A the histogram of 31,078 pairs among 25,319 H. sapiens proteins (blue

pairs generated in WGD events the functional form of the
Na(p) histogram in Paramecium tetraurelia approaches the universal scaling form: Na(p) ~ p-4 (dashed line).

Methods
The details of generating lists of paralogous proteins
The proteomes of H. pylori strain 26695 and E. coli strain
K12-MG1655 were downloaded from the Comprehensive
Microbial Resource (CMR) [22] version 1.0. Sequences of
S. cerevisiae proteins are from the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD) [23] version number
20031001. The D. melanogaster's sequences are from the
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project [24], release 3.1. C.
elegans – Wormbase [25], release WS127.H. sapiens – the
NCBI database [26], build 34.1. The initial set of paralogous pairs for each of the organisms was identified by an
all-to-all alignment of sequences of its proteins to each
other using the BLASTP program [1]. For H. pylori, E. coli,
S. cerevisiae, and D. melanogaster genomes, the E-value
threshold of 10-10 was employed. This corresponds to p-

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:32

values of the order of 10-12 (for H. pylori) and lower. Due
to larger genome sizes of C. elegans and H. sapiens an even
more conservative E-value of 10-30 was used to reduce the
number of hits generated by the algorithm.
The "raw" datasets for worm, fly and human often contain
multiple overlapping protein sequences predicted by different gene models of the same gene (including but not
limited to different splicing variants). To avoid spurious
hits we first mapped entries in raw datasets to unique gene
IDs. This was easy to accomplish in the fly and worm datasets, where names of different gene models differ from
each other by the last letter. In human genome, this was
done by mapping the gi numbers of sequences in the raw
dataset to unique GeneID (LocusLink) identifiers from
the Entrez Gene database [27]. Subsequently, if multiple
BLAST hits were connecting the same pair of gene IDs we
kept the one with the longest aligned region. This way we
were guaranteed that one and only one pair of splicing (or
gene model) variants per pair of gene IDs would contribute to the PID histogram.
In all genomes, only pairs in which the aligned region
constituted at least 80% of the length of the longer protein
were kept [15]. This excludes contribution from pairs of
multi-domain proteins paralogous over only one of their
domains.
Initially, the PID histogram in S. cerevisiae had two very
sharp peaks at 51% and 70%. A close inspection revealed
that these peaks are produced by evolutionary related subfamilies of nearly identical transposable elements. To correct for this obvious artifact in S. cerevisiae we removed
108 proteins encoded by known transposable elements
listed in the Saccharomyces Genome Database [23] and
their homologs.
The overall shape of the PID histogram in regions I and II
is not sensitive to the E-value cutoff chosen. In Fig. 1S we
show that when the E-value cutoff in the fly dataset was
changed from a less conservative 10-10 to a more conservative 10-30 value, the shape of the histogram above 40%
remained virtually unchanged. Similarly, the results are
nearly independent on the type of the BLOSUM substitution matrix used (in the end we opted for the
BLOSUM45.) Finally, we verified that our results are independent of the alignment algorithm utilized to calculate
PIDs. Indeed, in the fly dataset we have recalculated PIDs
for all paralogous pairs detected by BLAST using much
more sophisticated Smith-Waterman algorithm [28]. The
resulting histogram (shown as blue stars in Fig. 1S) is virtually indistinguishable from that based on the blastp
output.

and 20 (20 types of "amino-acids"). This constitutes the
initial state of our artificial genome/proteome, encoding
2,000 "proteins" of 100 "amino-acids" each. Every aminoacid position in each of the proteins is randomly assigned
the substitution rate µ drawn from a Gamma-distribution
with α = 1/3. One evolutionary timestep consists of:

1. Duplicate a randomly selected gene in the genome and
use this duplicated copy to replace another randomly
selected gene (deletion). Thus in this model the deletion
rate is exactly equal to the duplication rate.
2. Randomly pick 400 amino-acid positions in the whole
genome and substitute amino-acids at those positions to
a randomly selected new value. The probability of a particular amino-acid position to be picked is proportional to
its substitution rate µ.
This choice of parameters in our model corresponds to
∗
∗
rdel / µ = rdel / µ = rdup / µ = rdup / µ = 0.25 .

Indeed,

the

average substitution rate per amino acid during one
timestep is given by 400/(100 × 2000) = 1/500. It is equal
to 0.25 of the per-gene per timestep duplication/deletion
rate of 1/2000. In this artificial evolutionary process we
have the advantage of keeping track of all the duplicated
pairs. Thus, after each duplication event the list of all
duplicated pairs is updated and can be directly read off.
After repeating the above steps for 20,000 times the full
genome alignment of all proteins is produced and stored.
The distributions of duplicated and all paralogous pairs
shown in Fig. 3 are generated by averaging over 20 such
samples.
Identification of true duplicated (sibling) pairs by the
Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
We are naturally not in possession of the set of protein
pairs that actually underwent duplication in the course of
evolution of a given genome. The identification of the
most likely candidates for these "true" duplicates is in general a rather complicated task which involves reconstructing the actual phylogenetic tree for every family in a
genome. However, we could make a much simpler educated guess about past duplication events by connecting
paralogous proteins in a given family with the Minimum
Spanning Tree (MST) that is the tree maximizing the sum
of PIDs along its edges (or, to agree with its name, minimizing its opposite sign value). For a family consisting of
F proteins such tree has exactly F - 1 edges representing
Page 13 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:32

our best guess about the actual duplication events. One
can prove the truth of this by induction: when a freshly
duplicated pair is created with PID = 100% it extends the
previously existing Minimum Spanning Tree of a family
by one edge. Assuming a constant rate of divergence for all
paralogous pairs in a given family, the set of duplicated
pairs would continue to form the Minimum Spanning
Tree at all times. We used the Kruskal algorithm [29] to
approximately detect the MST.
Detection of families of paralogous genes
Families of paralogous proteins used in Figure 5 are
defined as mutually isolated clusters of proteins in the
network in which paralogous pairs are connected by a
link. Every two nodes within a family are either directly or
indirectly connected to each other by at least one chain of
paralogous links, while different clusters (families) are
completely disconnected from each other. Because of our
requirement for the length of the aligned region to be
>80% of the length of the longest protein in a pair, all proteins within such families are rather homogeneous in
their lengths.

Reviewers comments
Reviewer 1: Eugene V Koonin, National Center for
Biotechnology Information, National Institute of Health,
Bethesda, Maryland, USA
This is quite an interesting, elegant study that presents a
mathematical model connecting the distribution of percent sequence identity in paralogous protein families with
the parameter of the gamma-distribution of intra-protein
variability. The latter parameter had been explored before,
and the values reported here are within the previously estimated ranges, but to my knowledge, this is the first work
that derives this parameter theoretically from completely
independent data. It is intriguing and, I suppose, important that the distributions of the identities between paralogs and, accordingly, the gamma-distribution parameter
are almost genome-independent. It seems like the latter
parameter is almost a "fundamental constant" that follows from the physics of protein structure that is, of
course, universal.

I have three comments that are rather technical but bear
on the robustness and generality of the conclusions.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/32

1. A trivial point ... but, I feel it would have been helpful
to increase the number of analyzed genomes, both in
terms of diversity, and by including more than one
genome from each of the included lineages (and others).
The analysis of sets of related genomes would (hopefully)
demonstrate the robustness of the obtained distributions,
and would also help assessing the significance of the differences in the exponents seen among genomes. In particular, similar, flat distributions found in human and in
yeast are somewhat strange given the huge difference in
the size and complexity of these genomes. This is attributed to the legacy of whole-genome duplications but I
find that explanation dubious. Traces of this duplication
in yeast and, especially, in vertebrates are very weak.
Including more genomes would help to clarify this issue.
The reported genome analysis is very simple, it cannot be
computationally prohibitive.
Authors response
We agree that extending our analysis to include more genomes
is fairly straightforward. However, we want to save the subject
of lineage-dependence of the exponent γ (apart from that
related to Whole Genome Duplications (WGD)) for future
studies and to report it in a separate publication. To check our
hypothesis that WGD are responsible for unusual profile of the
PID-histograms in human and yeast we analyzed the genome
of Paramecium tetraurelia. The lineage leading to this organism underwent as many as four separately identifiable WGD
events. The results of our analysis presented in Fig. 6 and the
accompanying section of the manuscript have beautifully confirmed our initial hypothesis: while the all-to-all Na(p) histogram in the whole proteome of Paramecium tetraurelia (solid
diamonds in Fig. 6) has an unusually flat profile similar to the
one we saw in human (blue ×-es in Fig. 6), the removal of proteins generated in WGD events results in a stepper PID-histogram (red stars in Fig. 6) which is in excellent agreement with
the universal p-4 functional form (dashed line in Fig. 6). This
provides necessary support to our original conjecture that unusually flat PID histograms in human and baker's yeast are also
due to (possibly less obvious) duplicated pairs of proteins generated in WGD events in these two lineages.

2. The mathematical model developed in the paper is a
typical birth-and-death model. I wonder why the phrase is
not used (it would immediately clarify the matter to those
familiar with the field) and some of the relevant literature
is not cited.
Authors response
We have modified our notation to incorporate this comment.
We also cited the appropriate literature on birth-and-death
models [4-6].

3. The "true" duplicates are identified using minimum
spanning tree under the constant rate assumption. This is

Page 14 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:32

quite a crude method and an unrealistic assumption, too.
Building actual phylogenetic trees, certainly, would be
more appropriate. This might be too hard technically for
this amount of material but, at least, the issues should be
acknowledged, I think.
Authors response
In the Background section of the manuscript we now explicitly
mention that the minimum spanning tree is just a simpler (yet
less precise) alternative to reconstructing the actual phylogenetic tree for every family in a genome.
Reviewer 2: Yuri Wolf, National Center for Biotechnology
Information, National Institute of Health, Bethesda,
Maryland, USA (nominated by Eugene Koonin)
The authors present an elegant model of protein evolution that ties together duplication, loss of paralogs and
sequence divergence. Under the assumption of the
gamma-distributed variation of intra-protein evolution
rates the model correctly predicts the power-law shape of
the distribution of distances between paralogs in fully
sequenced genomes. Analysis of the observed distributions allows to estimate the long-term rates of duplication, retention of paralogs and the shape parameter of the
intra-protein evolution rate distribution in different
organisms.

The authors are very explicit and thorough about the
model description. However one point should be emphasized for the sake of biologists among the Biology Direct
readership: the model is based on neutral evolution of
both protein sequence and the complement of paralogs in
the family and assumes that all protein families behave in
the same manner. This is, obviously, a gross (if necessary)
simplification of reality. The good agreement between the
model predictions and the observed data is quite amazing
and possibly deserves some discussion.
Authors response
I believe by this comment Dr. Wolf has raised an important
point which was inadequately presented in our manuscript.
While the model itself indeed was built using a simplified (completely neutral) picture of real evolutionary processes the results
of this analysis turned out to be independent of these assumptions. Thus they are expected to remain valid in a more realistic
evolutionary scenario (such as variable average substitution,
gene duplication and deletion rates in individual families)
when these assumptions are relaxed. We have added a new subsection "Robustness of the functional form of Na(p) with respect
to neutrality assumptions" to the Results section of the manuscript which describes in details our answer to this comment.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/32

shape parameter of the intra-protein evolution rate distribution (~1/3). This result is in surprising agreement with
earlier estimates, including our own [Grishin et al. 2000],
obtained using entirely different approaches. This might
be telling us that this parameter is a "universal constant"
of protein evolution and that it is dictated more by protein physics rather than organism-specific properties.
Authors response
This is now also discussed in the new section mentioned in our
previous response.

The section on the numerical simulations is somewhat
less justified in the eyes of this reviewer. The underlying
mathematical model appears to be fully solved analytically and simulations follow the model precisely. Thus the
results of the simulations are expected to agree with the
analytical solution unless some really dumb mistake was
made in the course of derivation or in the implementation
of the simulations. If I am missing something and the
impact of this section goes beyond the simple verification,
it probably should be discussed in the text.
Authors response
We agree that for the most part we use numerical simulations
just to confirm the validity of our analytical results. Still, we
decided to keep it in the manuscript since it clearly demonstrates (see Fig. 3) that the deletion rate used in the model
could be successfully reconstructed from the Nd(p) histogram.
This is not entirely obvious because of the approximations that
went into deducing the true duplicated (sibling) pairs using the
Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.
Reviewer 3: David Krakauer, Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe,
New Mexico, USA
The paper introduces a number of new ideas, including a
minimal spanning tree algorithm for eliminating redundant distance information in a full pairwise distance
matrix in order to yield an estimate of the true number of
paralogous genes.

I tend to view this paper as a contribution to the neutrality
literature which seeks to explain large scale patterns of
genomic evolution in terms of fundamental mutational
processes without invoking dedicated selection pressures
acting on specific genes. Having said this, selection could
be playing an important role in accounting for effective
rate variation in amino acid substitutions, and in establishing the parameters of duplication and deletion that
prevent excessive growth or shrinking of genomes. Whatever these selection pressures might be, they would seem
to have to apply across a number of species.

Probably the most interesting observation in the paper is
the near-constancy of the power of the middle part of the
distribution curve (~4) and, according to the model, the

Page 15 of 19

Biology Direct 2007, 2:32

I have a number of questions relating to the means of
establishing the empirical power law, and the interpretation of the results.
1. As the authors are aware straight lines in log-log plots
are not equivalent to having demonstrated a power law
distribution and least squares fitting frequently generate
biased estimates. Recent research (Clauset et al 2007)
presents maximum likelihood estimators for scaling
parameters free from these biases. How do the authors
establish confidence in their estimates of the exponent?
Authors response
Due to an unavoidably narrow range of our power law fits along
the x-axis (The region II includes 0.3 <p < 0.95 or half a decade) we didn't use any sophisticated techniques in our fitting
protocols. In fact, in this interval the exponential fits look only
marginally worse than those with a power law. Thus for us the
exponent γ of a power law fit is just a convenient single parameter quantifying the distribution which is A) consistent with the
Gamma-distribution traditionally used to describe substitution
rates; B) nearly universal in a broad variety of organisms ranging from H. pylori to D. melanogaster.

2. I was somewhat confused by the renormalization procedure for the raw distance histograms. While I understand that this is required in order to ensure a stationary
distribution, I do not see clearly what the biological implications or assumptions of this step are. Perhaps this could
be clarified?
Authors response
A standard mathematical approach to describing stationary
probability distributions in growing systems is to normalize the

histogram in question by the sum of its elements (∑pNa(p) in
our case). However, we noticed that the total number of paralogous pairs ∑pNa(p) detected by all-to-all alignment of all protein sequences grows at the same exponential rate 2(rdup - rdel)
2
as the square of the number of genes - N genes . Moreover, in
2
real genomes the relationship ∑pNa(p) ~ N genes holds very well

(see Additional file 2). Thus we decided to use the total number
2
of gene pairs Ngenes(Ngenes - 1)/2 ~ N genes (the theoretical

upper bound to the number of paralogous pairs) to normalize
the Na(p). The biological implication of this result is that the
fraction of paralogous pairs among all gene pairs is roughly the
same in all genomes (as manifested by the collapse of normalized distributions in Fig. 1B).
We have also added the new subsection "An estimate of the
number of superfamilies in different genomes" in which we
speculate that the p-4 could be extended well into the region III

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/32

down to its theoretical minimum of 5 – 8%. This could be (at
least partially) accomplished if in addition to sequence similarity one would use structural similarity to define superfamilies of
paralogous proteins. These results indicate that normalizing
Na(p) by Ngenes(Ngenes - 1)/2 is a remarkably close approximation to normalizing it by the actual (presently unknown)
number of paralogous pairs contained in the genome (including
the evolutionary relationships missed by sequence-alignment
algorithms).
3. I worried a little about the uniqueness of the Gammadistribution in generating the scaling behavior given the
absence of a robust test for the scaling exponent. How
many different distributions have been tested, and how
robust is the result to departure from the Gamma?
Authors response
As we explained in our response to your question #1, due to an
inherently narrow range of the Region II (half a decade) we
never state that the power law functional form resulting from
Gamma-distributed substitution rates µ is the unique way to
mathematically describe the Na(p) histogram in real genomes.
Thus we didn't test multiple µ-distributions. Our only claim is
that the observed shape of Na(p) is consistent with Gamma-distributed (α = 0.33) substitution rates of individual aminoacids within a protein.

4. A little more could have gone into the discussion on the
mutational processes and the role of selection. Should we
assume rate variation to be the outcome of selection (as in
the example of the slow rate of evolution of ribosomal
proteins) where perhaps an active site remains more
highly conserved, or is it the contention of the authors
that some purely stochastic process at the mutational level
accounts for this variation? A similar argument could be
made for the duplication and deletion equilibrium. As the
paper reads now, I am not sure what processes the authors
have in mind.
Authors response
These and other points are now explained in the new subsection
"Robustness of the functional form of Na(p) with respect to
assumptions used in the model" added to the Results section of
the manuscript.

5. Surely the study of evolution through the properties of
genetic distance histograms is older than Lynch and Conery (2000). I am aware of earlier work by Gillespie and
many others.
Authors response
Thank you for pointing this out. We have added the book by
Gillespie and references therein to our citation list.

6. The paper needs to be spell checked and grammar
checked.
Authors response
Done.
Reviewer 4: Eugene Shakhnovich, Harvard University,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
Power-law distributions are ubiquitous in Protein Universe and were reported to describe distribution of sizes of
gene families, fold families, structural similarity relationships and other properties (1–4). It had been widely
accepted that the underlying reason for their emergence is
in evolutionary dynamics of creation of new genes and
proteins and several dynamics models have been proposed to describe it (1, 3, 5, 6). Here the authors study the
distribution of amino acid sequence similarities in paralogous families and also find a regime where power-law
describes the observed histogram well. They proposed a
mathematical model akin to master equation approach
which essentially assumes that the rate of divergence is
non-uniform it depends on the sequence ID of genes in
question. The model and the analysis are interesting and
make a valuable contribution to the literature on evolutionary dynamics. The major strength of this study is in its
highly quantitative character which provides interesting
insights about duplication/deletion rates which are apparently dependent on past history. However I would like the
authors to address the following questions:

1) The authors consider all gene families in various organisms regardless of their functional distributions. However
recent work of B. Shakhnovich and Koonin (7) (which is
in a sense a forerunner of the present paper) has demonstrated that evolution of paralogous families is dramatically different in the case of families containing essential
(E-families) genes and families that do not contain such
genes (N-families). It would be interesting to carry out the
same quantitative analysis separately for E- and N-families
and check how different exponents of intermediate
power-law regimes are and how does it fit into IDdependent divergence rate picture.
Authors response
We agree that it would be interesting to separately analyze the
PID-histogram E- and N-families. The Fig 3B of the B. Shakhnovich and E. Koonin article (Ref. [7] in the list below)
essentially does that. From it one can see that while E-families,
which are on average larger ([7]) than N-families, have a
sequence identity histogram similar to the whole-genome Na(p)
in our study, the composite PID histogram of all N-families in
yeast is essentially flat. However, as we now explain in the
revised version of our manuscript our birth-and-death model
does not apply to collections of individual families grouped
together by some shared characteristic (e.g by their size or by

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/32

whether or not they contain an essential gene). Indeed, the
dynamics of such a group would depend on additional parameters such as the rate of creation and removal of families of a
given type. For example, the appearance of an essential gene
gene in an N-family would turn it into a new E-family and
remove its contribution to the histogram of all N-families. We
feel that modification of our analysis to incorporate these extra
terms goes beyond the scope of this article.
2) The major weakness of this analysis (and other phenomenological approaches) is that the "explanation" for
power-law regime comes from an assumption of a certain
form of the distribution of substitution rates in the form
of Gamma-function. While assuming Gamma-function
may result in good fits it is entirely mysterious why does
it emerge. The authors make a very interesting hint that
Gamma emerges from intra-protein variability of substitution rates but they do not dwell much further on that. In
fact such variability does exist. It was quantitatively studied in a microscopic protein evolution model by
Dokholyan and myself in 2001 [8]. It would be highly
instructive to check whether distributions of substitution
rates observed in [8] can provide additional insights into
the microscopic origin of empirical fits used in this work.
Authors response
It would be indeed extremely exciting to find a truly "microscopic" explanation of the universal parameters of the Gammadistribution reported in our manuscript along the lines of the
Ref. ([8]). We feel however, that this goes well beyond the
scope of this article. In the new subsection of our manuscript
"Robustness of the functional form of Na(p) with respect to
assumptions used in the model" we now cite the Ref. ([8]) and
mention that its results lead to a biophysical explanation to the
remarkable universality of the exponent a reported in our manuscript.

3) The effective distribution of intra-protein variability
seems to depend on family size. Why? Can it be related to
functional constrains (e.g. E- and N- families). A comment or further analysis will be helpful.
Authors response
Soon after sending our manuscript for review we realized that
our mathematical model is applicable only to whole genomes or
large individual families and does not describe PID histograms
in collections of many families grouped by their size. Indeed,
such collections would have additional birth-and-death events
due to whole families entering or leaving the selected bin of
family sizes. The rates of these processes would have a non-trivial dependence on the age of a family and thus cannot be easily
incorporated into our mathematical framework. Thus we
removed the Fig. 5B showing the apparent systematic variation
of the exponent γ with the family size, which, in the hindsight,
is likely caused by these extra birth-and-death terms. For the

Additional material

4) The power-law regime is observed only at sufficient
level of divergence. Why? How can current model be
modified to account for the full histogram, not only its
power-law part?

Additional file 1
The overall shape of the PID histogram is independent of the alignment
algorithm and the E-value cutoff. The PID histogram Na(p) in the fly (D.
melanogaster genomes when pairs of paralogous proteins were detected
using the blastp algorithm [1] with E-value cutoff of 10-10 (filled circles)
and 10-30 (open diamonds). The inset shows the ratio of these two histograms, which is very close to 1 for p > 40%. Thus the overall shape of
Na(p) in most of the Region II (Fig. 1) is nearly + cutoff independent.
The Na(p) also is insensitive to a particular algorithm used to align the
pairs. Indeed, when paralogous pairs detected by the blastp with the Evalue cutoff of 10-10 (filled circles) were realigned using the Smith-Waterman algorithm [28] the resulting distribution (blue stars) changed very
little.

Authors response
We attribute the upward turn in Na(p) for p > 90% (inside the
Region I) to much higher deletion rates of recently duplicated
genes caused by their apparent redundancy. The crossover to
power law in the Region II means that this redundancy tends to
be lost below this level of sequence identity. The combination of
our equations (1) and (7) provide a comprehensive mathematical description valid in both Regions II and I (as we explained
the crossover in the region III is an artifact caused by some bona
fide paralogous pairs being missed by sequence alignment algorithms).

Additional file 2
The quadratic scaling of the total number of paralogous pairs with the
number of genes in the genome. The total number of paralogous pairs
∑pNa(p) generated by the all-to-all alignment of all protein sequences
encoded in the genome (the y-axis) scales as the square of the total
number Ngenes of protein-coding genes in the genome. Solid symbols are six
model organisms used in our study. The solid line has the slope 2 on this
