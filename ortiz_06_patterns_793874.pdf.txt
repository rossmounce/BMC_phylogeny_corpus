Abstract
Background: Evolutionary analysis may serve as a useful approach to identify and characterize
host defense and viral proteins involved in genetic conflicts. We analyzed patterns of coding
sequence evolution of genes with known (TRIM5α and APOBEC3G) or suspected (TRIM19/PML)
roles in virus restriction, or in viral pathogenesis (PPIA, encoding Cyclophilin A), in the same set of
human and non-human primate species.
Results and conclusion: This analysis revealed previously unidentified clusters of positively
selected sites in APOBEC3G and TRIM5α that may delineate new virus-interaction domains. In
contrast, our evolutionary analyses suggest that PPIA is not under diversifying selection in primates,
consistent with the interaction of Cyclophilin A being limited to the HIV-1M/SIVcpz lineage. The
strong sequence conservation of the TRIM19/PML sequences among primates suggests that this
gene does not play a role in antiretroviral defense.

Background
Evolutionary genomics approaches have been proposed
as powerful tools to identify protein regions relevant for
host-pathogen interactions [1]. Identifying signatures of
genetic conflict can open the way to biological testing of
hypotheses regarding the function of host proteins. In retrovirology, the utility of this approach was recently demonstrated in evolutionary analyses of the antiretroviral
defense genes TRIM5α, encoding a retrovirus restriction
factor targeting the viral capsid [2,3], and APOBEC3G,
coding for a cytidine deaminase that hypermutates viral
DNA in primates [4-6]. Both genes were shown to have
been shaped by positive selection, which led to the rapid
fixation of adaptive amino acid replacement substitu-

tions. The two genes revealed two different patterns of
positive selection: a localized region of rapid change in
TRIM5α [3], and a pattern where positively selected residues are scattered throughout the sequence in APOBEC3G
[5].
To assess the potential of an evolutionary approach to
identify further primate genes/proteins involved in virus
defense, we analyzed coding sequence evolution of two
additional genes, TRIM19 (PML) and PPIA, and reassessed
the selective signatures of TRIM5α and APOBEC3G in a
common set of primates, representing 40 million years of
evolution [7]. TRIM19 (PML) was proposed to possess
anti(retro)viral activity [8,9], while Cyclophilin A,

encoded by PPIA (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase), is
incorporated into HIV-1 particles through an interaction
with the viral capsid [10]. Cyclophilin A is incorporated
only into viral particles of viruses of the HIV-1M/SIVCPZ
lineage, where it is required for viral replication [11].
To trace the evolutionary history of these genes, we first
sequenced their coding regions from eleven primate species [see Additional files 1 and 2]. We then analyzed their
substitutional patterns in the framework of the accepted
primate phylogeny [7] using several codon-based maximum likelihood procedures as implemented in the
codeml tool of the PAML program package [12] (Figure
1).
To obtain an overview of the coding sequence evolution,
we estimated the number of nonsynonymous (KA) over
synonymous (KS) substitutions per site (averaged over the
entire sequence) for each branch of the trees using the
free-ratio model of codeml [12]. Similarly to previous
reports [3,5,6], this analysis revealed generally high KA/KS
values on the different branches of the TRIM5α and
APOBEC3G trees (average KA/KS ~1.1 for both genes),
indicating that these genes show accelerated amino acid
replacement rates due to the action of positive selection
[13]. In contrast, PPIA and TRIM19 (PML) show low KA/

KS values (0.05 and 0.15, respectively, when averaged
over the entire tree), suggesting that their protein
sequences have been strongly preserved by purifying
selection (Figure 1).
In more detailed analyses, we then utilized models that
allow for different KA/KS rates at different sites of the
sequences, because adaptive evolution often occurs at a
limited number of sites [14]. We first compared a null
model ("M1a", [15,16]), which assumes two site classes
(sites under purifying selection and neutrally evolving
sites), to an alternative model ("M2a", [15,16]), which
adds a third site class that allows for sites with KA/KS > 1,
using likelihood ratio tests [17]. This comparison revealed
that the alternative model provides a significantly better
fit (P < 10-30) for the TRIM5α and APOBEC3G genes than
the null model, whereas the null model could not be
rejected for TRIM19 and PPIA (Table 1). The KA/KS for the
additional site class is larger than 1 for both TRIM5α (KA/
KS ~6.4) and APOBEC3G (KA/KS ~4.4), strongly suggesting
adaptive protein evolution driven by positive selection at
a subset of sites. Thus, this analysis supports the hypothesis that TRIM5α and APOBEC3G evolved under positive
selection. Contrary to this, nearly all sites of TRIM19 and
PPIA (91.5% and 100%, respectively) are under purifying
selection (Table 1).

Using a recently developed Bayesian approach [16], we
analyzed the site class under positive selection in TRIM5α
and APOBEC3G in more detail. For TRIM5α, 11 of 493
(2%) codon sites can be predicted to be positively selected
with high confidence (P > 0.95, Figure 2A). Two clusters
of positive selection are found in the SPRY domain. The
first cluster resides between amino acids 322 to 340 in the
variable region 1 (v1, [18]), a region previously described
as a "patch" of positive selection [3]. Replacement of the
v1 region, or of specific amino acids within v1, modifies
the restriction pattern of TRIM5α [19,20]. The second
cluster, localized between amino acids 381 to 389, corresponds to the previously described variable region v2 of
the SPRY domain [18]. Substitution of the human v2
region by a Rhesus monkey v2 exhibits no inhibitory
activity against HIV-1 or a N-MLVL117H chimera [19,20].
However, the role of v2 in species-specific lentiviral
restriction has not yet been extensively tested.
The analysis also predicts a large number (24 of 384, 6%)
of positively selected sites in the APOBEC3G (Figure 2B)
sequence. This result is consistent with previous reports by
Sawyer et al. [5]. However, the inclusion of several new
species from an additional hominoid lineage, Hylobatidae (gibbons and siamangs), points to the existence of a
cluster of residues under positive selection between
amino acids 62 and 103, the region that defines the Vifinteraction domain [21]. The protein Vif, which counteracts the activity of APOBEC3G, is encoded by nearly all
lentiviruses [22]. Within the Vif-interaction domain of
APOBEC3G, 10 residues can be pinpointed to have
evolved under strong positive selection. Interestingly, the
APOBEC3G amino acid position 128, which controls the
ability of the HIV-1 Vif protein to bind and inactivate this
host defense factor [23,24], is correctly identified as being
positively selected (P > 0.987).
The parallel assessment of multiple genes in the same set
of primates allows for several considerations and conclusions. First, by including additional primate lineages, we
modify and complement previously observed patterns for
two antiviral defense genes/proteins. For TRIM5α, our
analysis confirms previous results by Sawyer et al [3], but
underscores the potential interest of the second variable
region of the SPRY domain that may be of functional relevance and merits further experimental analysis. With
respect to APOBEC3G, our analysis extends previous
reports that showed protein-wide distribution of positively selected residues. It suggests that this protein potentially carries a functionally relevant cluster of selected
residues that coincides with the region of HIV-1-Vif interaction [23,24]. Positive selected sites by Bayes Empirical
Bayes Inference with probabilities P > 0.95 for the two
proteins are listed in Additional file 3.

Second, the failure to identify signatures of positive selection in the TRIM19 (PML) gene suggests that its encoded
protein does not have antiviral activity, or that the protein
acts as an intermediary, lacking a physical protein-protein
interaction with the pathogen. TRIM19 (PML) has been
implicated in many functions, for example, in apoptosis
and cell proliferation [9]. In addition, TRIM19 (PML)
expression may act as an effector of the antiviral state
induced by type I interferons [9]. Overexpression of
TRIM19 (PML) is reported to confer resistance to infection
by vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus. Rabies,
Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus replicate to higher levels in PML-negative cells, whereas overexpression of the protein has no significant effect. Various
roles have been proposed for TRIM19 (PML) in retroviral
replication [8,25], although these findings remain controversial [26]. Many other viruses, including herpes simplex
type 1 disturb the nuclear bodies that contain, among
other proteins, TRIM19 (PML). However, it is unclear
whether these effects are a consequence of the viral infection or a sign of its participation in antiviral defense. Thus,
the effect of TRIM19 (PML) might be indirect. Failure to
identify a signature of positive selection militates against
a direct role of this protein in antiviral defense, because it
would be expected that a prolonged contact with multiple
pathogens over long evolutionary time periods would
have resulted in signatures of positive selection indicative
of a genetic conflict.
Finally, the absence of a signature of positive Darwinian
selection in Cyclophilin A provides a complement to the
understanding of the role of this protein in retroviral
pathogenesis. Cyclophilin A interacts directly with the
HIV-1 capsid, an interaction that may protect HIV-1 from
antiviral restriction activity [27]. Although required by
members of the HIV-1M/SIVCPZ lineage for replication, it
is not needed by other primate immunodeficiency viruses
[11]. Owl monkeys exhibit post-entry restriction of HIV-1
mediated by a TRIM5-Cyclophilin A fusion protein generated by retroposition [28]. Evolutionary analysis of PPIA
indicates that Cyclophilin A has been preserved by strong
purifying selection, leaving its protein sequence virtually
unchanged. This is consistent with the interaction of
Cyclophilin A and the viral capsid being limited to the
HIV-1M/SIVcpz lineage.
Together, the results presented here further support that
an evolutionary genomics approach may be very useful
for systematically assessing functional roles of primate
host proteins potentially relevant in viral pathogenesis
[29]. Candidates for this approach may include other
members of the TRIM or APOBEC families [30,31] as well
as proteins involved in pathogen recognition and life
cycle. Signatures of positive selection, but also the absence
of signs of a genetic conflict, constitute relevant informa-
