Background

their codon usage. The majority of genes (typically in the
range of 90%) are not highly expressed, and the codon usage
of these genes appears to be more strongly influenced by
mutations than by selection during the course of evolution
[1].
Based on these observations, several approaches to measuring codon usage have been proposed to predict the level of
protein expression, such as the frequency of optimal codons
[2], the codon preference statistic [3], the codon adaptation

information

Differential codon usage represents an evolutionary strategy
to modulate gene expression, and hence mathematical formulations of the codon usage bias have widely been used to
predict gene expression on a genomic scale. This is based on
the assumption that codon usage bias is correlated with protein levels. Indeed, highly expressed genes have been found
almost exclusively to use those codons translated by abundant tRNAs in Escherichia coli and budding yeast, whereas
genes that are not highly expressed appear to be less biased in

refereed research

Results: The level of correlation between these two CAI methods is a simple and intuitive
measure of the degree of translational bias in an organism, and from this we confirm that fast
replicating bacteria are more likely to have a dominant translational codon usage bias than are slow
replicating bacteria, and that this translational codon usage bias may be used for prediction of highly
expressed genes. By analyzing more than 300 bacterial genomes, as well as five fungal genomes, we
show that codon usage preference provides an environmental signature by which it is possible to
group bacteria according to their lifestyle, for instance soil bacteria and soil symbionts, spore
formers, enteric bacteria, aquatic bacteria, and intercellular and extracellular pathogens.

deposited research

Background: Codon adaptation indices (CAIs) represent an evolutionary strategy to modulate
gene expression and have widely been used to predict potentially highly expressed genes within
microbial genomes. Here, we evaluate and compare two very different methods for estimating CAI
values, one corresponding to translational codon usage bias and the second obtained
mathematically by searching for the most dominant codon bias.

index (CAI) [1], the 'effective number of codons' used in a
gene [4], and predicted highly expressed genes [5]. Of these,
the CAI has survived the test of time and has now been cited
more than 700 times, with 58 citations in 2005 alone. This
method is based on a known set of 27 highly expressed E. coli
genes [6], from which a codon bias signature was deduced
that was most likely to be efficient for translation. This bias
was then used to derive codon adaptation indices for all genes
in E. coli.
Although the first species examined - namely E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae - provided strong evidence of high
translational codon usage bias, recent studies have reported
on bacterial species with little codon usage bias [7,8], often
species with extreme AT or GC content. In these studies,
whole genome information was used to obtain a universal
CAI, applying a mathematical measure to derive the most
dominant codon bias based on the codons from all potential
open reading frames from a genome. This CAI, which ignored
the codon usage of experimentally determined highly
expressed genes, demonstrated that codon bias, as such, is
not necessarily translational nor correlated with gene expression, especially in slow growing bacteria [8]. Consequently, it
is not trivial to deduce and compare codon usage biases
across a vast range of bacterial species available in sequence
databases, including species rich in AT or GC, and to the best
of our knowledge this type of large-scale comparison has not
previously been conducted.
Although an early report found little correlation between
mRNA and protein concentration, the correlation was considerably greater for highly expressed genes [9], and a recent
study found a significant relationship between protein levels
and mRNA levels in yeast [10]. Consequently, microarray
gene expression data are useful for confirming predicted
highly expressed genes, as a substitute for protein levels.
Here, we calculate and compare a translational CAI (tCAI)
based on that proposed by Sharp and Li [1] with a purely
mathematical dominant CAI (dCAI) [8] for 318 bacterial and
5 fungal genomes for which full sequences are deposited in
Genbank and available from the Genome Atlas Database (version 19.1) [11]. We compare the ability of both types of CAI to
estimate the translational codon bias of an organism and
show that codon usage preferences provides an environmental signature by which it is possible to group bacteria according to lifestyle. Furthermore, we examine how well each CAI
measure correlates with microarray gene expression data for
six selected organisms and show that the tCAI measure is
generally better than dCAI in predicting highly expressed
genes.

Results and discussion

The two types of CAI were calculated for all genes in 318 bacterial strains and fungal genomes, and the correlations

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/12/R114

between the derived tCAI and dCAI values are illustrated for
eight different bacterial phyla, with any remaining bacterial
species grouped into 'Other bacteria', and fungi depicted separately (Figure 1). For most groups, the correlation between
the two CAI measures is high (median above 0.5). Only for
chlamydiae and spirochaetes are the median correlations
below 0.5, indicating that the dominating codon biases are
not translational for most of the species included in these
groups. However, it is not surprising that there appears to be
little selection for strong tCAI bias in these genomes because
most of the bacteria in both of these phyla have slow replication times. Presumably, fast-replicating bacteria have optimized their replication machinery as opposed to slowreplicating bacteria, for which other factors might be more
important [7,8,12]. Consequently, we were able to confirm a
significant relationship between the level of translational
codon adaptation and replication time across the entire range
of genomes (Spearman's rank correlation, rho about 0.46)
using the number of 16S rRNAs as an indirect measure of
doubling time, as previously suggested [13], since the number
of 16S rRNAs indirectly influence replication times [14].
Next, the codon preferences, which are measurable by the relative adaptiveness of each codon (wij), were compared
between tCAI and dCAI and the difference (wij for tCAI minus
wij for dCAI) was used for cluster analysis of all 318 bacterial
strains and the five fungal genomes (Figure 2a; also see Additional data file: 1, additionally available at our website [15]).
Figure 2a shows a clear separation into several clusters with
AT-rich bacteria towards the left and GC-rich bacteria
towards the right, whereas bacteria with intermediate base
composition are in the middle. This is also reflected in the
clustering of codons, which are separated into two distinct
clusters in which either a codon preference for A/T (lower
half) or G/C (upper half) in the third position for dCAI is evident (GC3/AT3 skew dominates over translational bias).
However, although the AT content appears to be a significant
factor in the clustering, merely ordering by AT content does
not yield the same highly distinguishable clusters. Consequently, the correlation between the level of translational
codon adaptation (measured by the correlation between tCAI
and dCAI) and the genomic AT content was indeed very low
but still significant (rho about -0.14, P value about 0.015),
supporting the minor although unmistakable correlation
between AT content and clustering order visible in Figure 2a.
Furthermore, from the color bar in Figure 2a, indicating the
phylogeny of each microbe, we observe that the clustering is
not related to known phylogenetic relationships based on
sequence homology. Although smaller clusters of microbes of
the same bacterial species are indeed observed, this is perhaps not surprising because genomes of the same species
would be expected to have essentially the same codon usage
preferences. However, microbes from the same phylum are
not clustered but rather are scattered throughout the figure,
while many clusters contain organisms that are quite far apart
phylogenetically.

Looking at the remaining regions in Figure 2a, we observe
that the first (left-most) region consists of slow-growing
intracellular pathogens (Mycoplasma, Rickettsia, and
Chlamydia, among others) and other small pathogens (Bartonella, Helicobacter, Ehrlichia, and Campylobacter),
mostly with genome sizes less than or close to 1 megabase
(Mbp). The content of this region reflects the observation that
many organisms with reduced genomes have very low GC
content and supports the speculations that there is a selective
pressure in this group of bacteria to lower the nitrogen
requirement for DNA synthesis [17] by adapting the codon
usage to favor codons with more As and Us. The second

The fourth region mostly consists of bacteria living in aquatic
environments such as marine waters (Thermotoga maritima,
Prochlorococcus marinus, Desulfotalea psychrophila, Syne-

chococcus species), groundwater (Dehalococcoides), freshwater (Synechococcus elongatus), and hot springs
(Thermosynechococcus elongatus). Although other P. marinus strains cluster in the first region, strain MIT9313 is lowlight-adapted and has almost as many strain-specific genes as
it has genes in common with its high-light-adapted relative,

divided into three distinct regions (ignoring a few smaller
clusters on its left side). This division results in a total of five
distinct regions, as illustrated in Figure 2a. Figure 2b provides a zoom of the third and fourth region from the left. The
third region consists mainly of 'enterics' (intestinal bacteria)
living in the human intestine (for example, Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella, Bacteroides), the fly intestine (Yersinia pestis), and the animal intestine (Yersinia pseudotuberculosis).
The yeast genome, S. cerevisiae, clusters with the enterics.
Although fungi are clearly quite distant from bacteria phylogenetically, both can be relatively fast replicating and hence
would face the same selective pressure on codon usage. Moreover, Kluyveromyces lactis also groups with the enterics,
including E. coli K-12, with whom it is often grown together in
fermentors to produce chymosin (rennet) on a commercial
scale, reflecting similar preferences on growth environment.

tCAI is a 'forced' measure of translational bias, whereas dCAI
is a measure of the most dominating bias for an organism
independently of the type of bias (GC skew bias, strand bias,
and so on). For this reason, the correlation between these two

The above comparison of microarray data with tCAI values
demonstrates that even for organisms that are evolutionarily
far from E. coli (for which the bacterial reference set of highly
expressed genes was derived), it is possible to predict highly
expressed genes by their tCAI values even when the most
dominating bias in an organism is not translational, by comparing codon usage for each gene to that of genes in the

Prediction of highly expressed genes

To further analyze and compare genes predicted as being
highly expressed by tCAI versus genes having extreme codon
bias according to dCAI values and versus the highly expressed
genes estimated by microarray analysis, the overlap between
the top 10% genes was found and visualized in Venn diagrams
(Figure 3). For both S. cerevisiae and E. coli there is good
overlap of all three circles; that is, many of the same genes
with high tCAI also have high dCAI values, and furthermore
these genes are also found to be highly expressed in microarray experiments. For Bacillus subtilis, a smaller but similar
trend is evident. For the remaining bacteria, a significantly
higher number of genes with high expression values (microarray data) overlap with genes with high tCAI values than
with genes having high dCAI values. An investigation of the
functional categories to which the dCAI reference genes (top
1% of genes) belonged revealed that for S. cerevisiae, E. coli
and B. subtilis, a significant fraction of ribosomal proteins
were included, whereas for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Campylobacter jejuni and Geobacter sulfurreducens, no
ribosomal proteins where found among dCAI reference
genes. This is in agreement with the ribosomal criterion
defined by Carbone and coworkers [7], which states that that
ribosomal proteins have significantly higher dCAI values than
other protein encoding genes in translationally biased organisms. Thus, organisms having few or no ribosomal proteins
among dCAI reference genes exhibit little translational codon
usage bias as compared with organisms having many ribosomal proteins among dCAI reference genes.

reports

By the above described approach, we were able to divide the
organisms into three overall groups reflective of the genomic
AT/GC content as previously demonstrated, based on distances between binarized codon weights from dCAI [7]. However, rather than merely discriminating between classes of
lifestyle in terms of mesophily, thermophily and hyperthermophily - as previously shown based on either amino acid
composition [20,21] or by codon usage [7] - we obtained an
environmental signature based on differences in codon
weights between evolutionary more dominant codons and
codons preferred by the translational machinery. Consequently, we demonstrate that differences in codon usage bias
by tCAI and dCAI provide an environmental signature by
which it is possible to group bacteria into environmental
groups, such as soil bacteria, enterics, sporeformer, and intracellular pathogens. Moreover, this environmental signature
does not reflect already known phylogenetic relationships,
and as such the approach described above is not intended to
replace or extending the existing methods in phylogeny that
are based on sequence homology. These results build on a
previous finding that GC content of microbial communities is
influenced by the environment [22].

measures is a simple and intuitive yet strong indication of
whether the most dominating bias is translational, and consequently of how well the dCAI values explain gene expression.
In this sense, it is not surprising that the correlation between
the two CAI measures also gives an indication of how well
tCAI explains gene expression levels. This trend holds true at
least for the six organisms for which we compared CAI values
with microarray data, where the correlations between the two
CAI measures are significantly correlated with the degree of
how well tCAI correlates with gene expression (rho = 0.6).

region mainly consists of spore formers, including Gram-positive bacteria. Many of the bacteria in this region can replicate
quite rapidly, and exhibit other evidence of selective pressure
for optimization of the genome for quick replication on
demand. For example, the Vibrio (a Gram-negative, nonspore-former) and Bacillus (a Gram-positive spore-former)
cluster close together; and they have the largest number of
rRNAs and tRNAs out of several hundred bacterial genomes
sequenced so far. Finally, the fifth (right-most) region mainly
consists of soil bacteria, soil symbionts and plant pathogens,
as well as a few mammalian pathogens. Among additional
bacteria in this region, we found an intercellular pathogen,
Brucella melitensis, that may have evolved from soil and
plant associated bacteria [18] and a pathogen, Wolinella succinogenes, in which several soil-related genes have been identified [19]. Thus, we find that, upon closer inspection,
apparently misplaced genomes in a region may reflect similar
shared ecologic niches in the past.

Figure 3
Venn diagram evaluating the prediction of highly expressed genes (tCAI and dCAI) by comparison with microarray gene expression data (Expr). The
overlap between genes with top 10% tCAI, dCAI, and Expr values are pictured as overlapping circles, in which the number of genes found by either
method is given. The organisms are sorted in order of decreasing correlation (rho) between tCAI and dCAI values based on all genes in each organism.
For organisms with high correlation (high rho) between tCAI and dCAI values, most genes are predicted as highly expressed by both measures. Moreover,
these predictions overlap significantly with genes found to be highly expressed experimentally by microarrays. For organisms with low correlation (low
rho) between tCAI and dCAI values, few genes are predicted as highly expressed by both measures. Here, more genes predicted as highly expressed by

reference set of highly expressed genes using tCAI. This demonstrates that although the assumption that the same 27
genes are highly expressed in all bacteria may not be entirely
true, the codon usage pattern for these genes do provide a
useful signature for predicting highly expressed genes. However, the level of confidence decreases with decreasing levels
of translational codon adaptation in the dominating codon
usage biases (as estimated from the correlation between tCAI
and dCAI). Thereby, better performance was obtained than
by employing merely the most dominating codon usage bias
identified by dCAI, especially for organisms for which translational bias is not dominant (as also observed by Carbone
and coworkers [7]); in the latter case, dCAI would not be useful for predicting gene expression at all.

Conclusion

It was previously postulated that fast-growing bacteria share
codon usage preferences because they have more abundant
and similar tRNAs [12]. Here, we offer a biological explanation by showing a clear relationship between environment
and similarities in codon usage biases. Specifically, differences in codon preferences of translational codon adaptation
and dominant codon adaptation provide an environmental
signature by which it is possible to divide bacteria into groups
representing different lifestyles, such as soil bacteria and
symbionts, enterics, aquatic bacteria, spore formers, and
small intercellular and extracellular pathogens.
Moreover, our study confirms - across a wide range of bacteria and fungi - that the observed variations in correlation

between codon adaptation and gene expression are related to
differences in replication times. For organisms with low correlations between tCAI and dCAI, the dominant codon bias is
not translational, and consequently the dCAI values do not
reflect translational bias. Nonetheless, comparisons of microarray data with tCAI values indicate that this codon adaptation index is still useful for predicting a set of highly expressed
genes, although the level of confidence decreases along with
the magnitude of the translational bias.

Gene expression data

Where L is the number of codons in a given gene.
In order to identify a set of constitutively highly expressed
genes for each of the 318 bacterial genomes analyzed in this
work, the reference set of 27 very highly expressed E. coli
genes originally compiled by Sharp and Li [6] was aligned at
the protein level against all genes annotated in the Genbank
entry for each genome using BLASTP version 2.2.9 [33]. For
each of these very highly expressed genes, the gene with the
best alignment was added to a set of very highly expressed
genes if it had an E value below 10-6 (the absolute minimum
accepted only if an alignment with a better score could not be
identified), and these were used as a reference set for the
given organism. Similarly, for the five fungal genomes, we
used the reference set of very highly expressed S. cerevisiae
genes identified by Shartp and coworkers [34], removing the
second ribosomal protein 51 gene (rbs51B), resulting in a list
of 37 genes.
By this procedure, we were able to construct reference sets
containing a minimum of 15 genes for the Firmicute Clostridium tetani E88, and a maximum of 27 highly expressed E. coli
reference genes for 26 Proteobacteria strains. Consequently,
bacteria more related to E. coli exhibited a higher level of conservation. Thus, the number of identified reference genes
ranged from a median of 24 for Proteobacteria to a median of
21 for Actinobacteria. For the fungal genomes, a median of 36
genes was found in the reference sets.

The CAI measure of translational adaptation is an updated
version of the original codon adaptation index reported by
Sharp and Li [1], and in the following we refer to this CAI
measure as the 'translational codon adaptation index' (tCAI).
Although Sharp and Li, in their original work from 1987, were
forced by lack of data to assume a background codon usage
corresponding to equal usage of the synonymous codons for
any given amino acid, we now have vast libraries of complete
genomic sequences available. Consequently, we calculate the
relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for each organism
by comparing the codon distribution from a set of highly
expressed genes with a background distribution estimated

Dominating codon bias index
A purely mathematical CAI measure was proposed by Carbone and coworkers [8], and in this report we refer to this CAI
measure as 'dominant codon adaptation index' (dCAI). It
detects the most dominant codon bias in the genome, regardless of whether this bias is translational. The algorithm
screens a genome for genes that score the highest values on
the CAI scale and selects these as its reference set. For dCAI
values, we have used the tool CAIJava available from Carbone
