systems of Pantoea and Erwinia species reveals
the presence of putative effector islands that may
be translocated by the VgrG and Hcp proteins

Abstract
Background: The Type VI secretion apparatus is assembled by a conserved set of proteins encoded within a
distinct locus. The putative effector proteins Hcp and VgrG are also encoded within these loci. We have identified
numerous distinct Type VI secretion system (T6SS) loci in the genomes of several ecologically diverse Pantoea and
Erwinia species and detected the presence of putative effector islands associated with the hcp and vgrG genes.
Results: Between two and four T6SS loci occur among the Pantoea and Erwinia species. While two of the loci
(T6SS-1 and T6SS-2) are well conserved among the various strains, the third (T6SS-3) locus is not universally
distributed. Additional orthologous loci are present in Pantoea sp. aB-valens and Erwinia billingiae Eb661.
Comparative analysis of the T6SS-1 and T6SS-3 loci showed non-conserved islands associated with the vgrG and
hcp, and vgrG genes, respectively. These regions had a G+C content far lower than the conserved portions of the
loci. Many of the proteins encoded within the hcp and vgrG islands carry conserved domains, which suggests they
may serve as effector proteins for the T6SS. A number of the proteins also show homology to the C-terminal
extensions of evolved VgrG proteins.
Conclusions: Extensive diversity was observed in the number and content of the T6SS loci among the Pantoea
and Erwinia species. Genomic islands could be observed within some of T6SS loci, which are associated with the
hcp and vgrG proteins and carry putative effector domain proteins. We propose new hypotheses concerning a role
for these islands in the acquisition of T6SS effectors and the development of novel evolved VgrG and Hcp proteins.

Background
The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) was first identified
in the human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Vibrio cholerae and was shown in the latter to function
as an injectisome for the delivery of pathogenicity effector proteins into the host cell [1,2]. T6SS have since
been identified in genome sequences of many Gram
negative bacteria, including those of several animal and
plant pathogens, but also in symbiotic and free-living
bacteria [3]. This has led to the speculation that the
T6SS is involved in other non-pathogenic functions
including inter-bacterial communication, regulating

biofilm formation and environmental stress response
[4,5]. In the animal pathogens Salmonella enterica
subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and Helicobacter
hepaticus mutational analysis indicated that the T6SS
suppresses virulence and promotes replication in host
cells, thus contributing to long-term colonization [6,7].
In other bacteria, including the animal pathogen Yersinia pestis and the phytopathogen Pectobacterium atrosepticum, this increased proliferation has been
hypothesized to result in increased fitness and, subsequently, increased virulence [8,9]. The T6SS of the plant
symbiont Rhizobium leguminosarum has been linked to
host-specificity, where a T6SS deletion mutant of a
strain restricted to Trifolium subterraneum (clover cv.
Woogenellup) acquired the ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on the non-host Pisum sativum (pea) [10].

Several authors have identified an antibacterial role for
the T6SS. A secreted effector, Tse2, in P. aeruginosa has
been shown to have toxic effects on other bacteria [11].
Furthermore, the T6SS effectors Tse1 and Tse3 represent lytic enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan in the cell
walls of closely related Gram negative bacteria [12].
Similarly, bactericidal functions have been ascribed for
T6SSs in V. cholerae [13] and S. enterica [14]. The availability of more genome sequences and more experimental data will facilitate a greater understanding of new
and known functions of the T6SS. Several bacteria
encode multiple T6SS loci on their genomes. For example, the genomes of P. aeruginosa, Y. pestis and Burkholderia pseudomallei encode three, four and six T6SS loci,
respectively [3]. These seemingly non-paralogous loci,
together with the divergent functions of the T6SS suggests that this secretory system could influence a variety
of interactions within a single species, with various
hosts, and/or with other bacteria occupying the same
niche [3].
While the biological roles of the T6SS in many Gram
negative bacteria still need to be elucidated, other
aspects of this secretory system, including evolutionary,
genetic, structural and regulatory facets are becoming
better understood. T6SS loci are generally comprised of
15-25 genes and include a core of 16 conserved proteins, which assemble the T6SS apparatus in the cell
membrane [15]. These conserved proteins include IcmF
(COG3523) and DotU (COG3455), which have homology to proteins associated with the type IV secretion
system and are thought to stabilize the T6SS apparatus
in the cytoplasmic membrane [15]. An AAA+ ATPase,
ClpV (COG0542) may energize the assembly of the
apparatus. Other conserved proteins include the
DUF770 (COG3516) and DUF877 (COG3517) proteins,
which are predicted to function as chaperones and the
COG3521 outer membrane lipoprotein [15]. The outer
component of the T6SS apparatus is comprised of two
proteins, VgrG (COG3501) and Hcp (COG3157), which
have also been identified as secreted effectors of the
T6SS [16]. These proteins resemble both structurally
and genetically the components of the T4 bacteriophage
tail spike, suggesting that the VgrG-Hcp combination
forms a similar membrane penetrating structure and are
evolutionarily related [16,17]. Hcp proteins form hexameric rings that are conceivably stacked to form a tube
penetrating the outer membrane through which proteins
are transported into the extracellular space [18]. The
VgrG protein is postulated to puncture the outer cell
membrane to allow extrusion of the Hcp tube and subsequently breach the host cell membrane [16].
VgrG proteins have been demonstrated to be secreted
by the T6SS and are themselves required for the secretion

Page 2 of 15

of other effector proteins, such as the Tse3 effector in P.
aeruginosa [19]. However, a VgrG protein in this organism
has been shown to be secreted in a T6SS-independent
manner [19]. This indicates that the VgrG proteins are distinct and may perform diverse functions. Some VgrG proteins have been found to carry C-terminal extensions,
which carry conserved domains of various predicted functions. The N-terminal of these “evolved VgrGs” may serve
in assembly of the T6SS machinery, while the C-terminal
portion functions as effector [16]. One such evolved VgrG
in V. cholerae (VgrG-1) carries an actin-binding domain in
its C-terminal extension which has been shown to be
involved in host cell toxicity [20]. The C-terminal extension of a VgrG in S. enterica subsp. arizonae (IIIa) carries
an S-type pyocin domain which has been proposed to
function in bacterial cell killing [14]. Over 500 VgrG
orthologs have been identified in bacterial genome
sequences with many of these representing evolved VgrGs.
In a number of organisms for which genome sequences
are available, additional Hcp and VgrG paralogs with a
function in T6SS, termed “orphan” Hcps and VgrGs are
encoded by genes located on the genome separately from
the T6SS loci [14,21].
The genera Pantoea and Erwinia include ecologically
diverse species, including the plant pathogens Erwinia
amylovora and Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, which
are linked to devastating diseases of rosaceous plants
and maize, respectively [22,23]. The opportunistic plant
pathogen Pantoea ananatis causes disease on a broad
range of host plants and has been associated with
human bacteremia [24]. Several Erwinia species, including Erwinia billingiae and Erwinia tasmaniensis, are
found as part of the normal epiphytic microflora of
plants [25]. Strains of Pantoea agglomerans and Pantoea
vagans have recently received attention as potent biological control agents [26-28]. Strains of both Pantoea and
Erwinia have also been isolated from insects [29,30].
The complete and draft genomes of several Pantoea and
Erwinia species have recently been sequenced, which
provide an extensive base to identify genomic differences that may be linked to the divergent biological and
ecological phenotypes of these species. We used the
genome sequences to identify the T6SS in these organisms. An in depth analysis was undertaken which
showed that not all T6SS loci are universal to the
sequenced Pantoea and Erwinia species and that there
are notable anomalies between some of the loci that are
conserved among the compared organisms. We show
that these differences occur in putative genomic islands
associated with the Hcp and VgrG proteins and postulate that these islands represent regions of rapid and
extensive evolution, which may drive functional diversification of the T6SS.

Results and Discussion
Several orthologous T6SS loci occur in Pantoea and
Erwinia species

By means of baiting with the conserved proteins from
several characterized T6SS in other bacteria, between
two and four T6SS loci were identified in the complete
or draft genome sequences of five Pantoea and four
Erwinia strains (Figure 1). These strains were the Eucalyptus pathogen P. ananatis LMG 20103 [31], the biological control strains P. vagans C9-1 [32] and P.
agglomerans E325 (Smits and Duffy, unpublished
results), the insect-associated strains Pantoea sp. aBvalens [29] and Pantoea sp. At-9b [30] which represent
novel species of the genus Pantoea, the fire blight
pathogens E. amylovora CFBP 1430 [22] and E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163T [33] and the apple epiphytes E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 [34] and E. billingiae Eb661 [25]. Two
orthologous loci are found in all Pantoea and Erwinia
strains, while a more restricted distribution could be
observed for the T6SS-3 locus (Figure 1). Additional
T6SS loci were identified in the genome sequences of E.
billingiae Eb661 and Pantoea sp. aB-valens, respectively.
The T6SS-1 loci range in size from 28.8 and 40.0 kb and
are built around a well-conserved and syntenous core
which includes orthologs of all sixteen conserved T6SS
proteins identified by Boyer et al. [15] (Figure 2 and 3).
Additional genes encode a serine/threonine protein kinase
(PpkA) and serine/threonine phosphatase (PppA). These
proteins interact with the Fork Head-Associated (FHA)
domain protein (COG3456) for the post-translational regulation of the T6SS [35]. In both Pantoea and Erwinia

Page 3 of 15

strains the conserved core T6SS proteins are arranged in
two syntenous clusters (block I and III - Figure 2 and 3).
These are separated by a variable region (block II), which
is linked to the hcp gene (COG3157). A further variable
region occurs next to the vgrG gene (block IV). In all
sequenced Pantoea and Erwinia genomes, with the exception of E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163T, this variable region is
flanked at the 3’ end by a gene encoding a re-arrangement
hot spot (rhs) element [36]. In P. agglomerans E325, E.
amylovora CFBP 1430, E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163T and E.
tasmaniensis Et1/99, an additional copy of the vgrG gene
occurs within this variable region. A non-conserved region
harboring two hypothetical genes, which is not associated
with a vgrG or hcp gene could be observed between
COG3520 and clpV in E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 and E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163T (Figure 3).
The T6SS-2 loci of the Pantoea strains and E. billingiae Eb661 are structurally and genetically conserved
and consist of eight syntenous genes which encode proteins that are highly conserved among the sequenced
strains (Figure 4). Only four of these belong to conserved T6SS proteins outlined by Boyer et al. [15], suggesting the T6SS-2 loci encodes a partial and potentially
non-functional T6SS. An average amino acid identity of
52% could be observed between the proteins encoded in
the T6SS-2 locus and their respective paralogs in the
T6SS-1 locus for each of the strains. This suggests that
the T6SS-2 locus could have arisen through a partial
duplication of the T6SS-1 locus. This is supported by
phylogenetic analysis with the IcmF (COG3523) protein
sequences (Figure 5), where the T6SS-2 loci branch

while the non-conserved hcp and vgrG islands are not shaded. Genes encoding conserved domain proteins are represented by green arrows
while the grey arrows indicate other genes conserved among the Pantoea and Erwinia T6SS-1 loci which were not identified as part of the
conserved core described by Boyer et al. [15]. Red arrows represent the hcp and vgrG genes while genes not conserved among the Pantoea and
Erwinia species are colored in white. Graphs show the G+C content (%) (window size = 50 bp, step = 10 bp) in the respective T6SS-1 loci.

from the T6SS-1 loci. The E. amylovora CFBP 1430 and
E. pyrifoliae DSM12613T T6SS-2 loci encode only four
proteins, lacking the genes encoding the serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase required for posttranslational regulation, while an FHA domain (COG3456)
protein is encoded in these loci. The icmF gene in the
E. pyrifoliae DSM12613T T6SS-2 locus is inactivated by
a frameshift [33], while the E. tasmaniensis Et1/99
T6SS-2 locus is missing the FHA domain gene, indicating further gene loss in these T6SS loci (Figure 4).
The Pantoea and Erwinia T6SS-3 loci are between
18.8 and 34.6 kb in size and encompass 19 to 32 protein
coding sequences. In contrast to the T6SS-1 and -2 loci,
the T6SS-3 locus is not universal to all Pantoea and
Erwinia strains (Figure 1). The phylogeny based on the
IcmF protein shows a greater evolutionary distance
between the Pantoea and Erwinia T6SS-3 loci, which
are interspersed with those of other Enterobacteriaceae
(Figure 5), indicating that this locus may have been
acquired through horizontal gene transfer. This can also
be correlated with greater diversity in gene content and
order between the various Pantoea and Erwinia T6SS-3
loci (Figure 6 and 7). Thirteen of the T6SS conserved
core proteins identified by Boyer et al. [15] are encoded
within the T6SS loci. Genes encoding orthologs of the
COG3913, COG4455 and FHA domain (COG3456) proteins are absent. No PpkA or PppA orthologs are
encoded in the T6SS-3 loci either, suggesting that this
locus is not post-translationally regulated. As in the case

of the T6SS-1 loci, syntenous blocks of core genes can
be observed in the T6SS-3 loci (block I, III and V - Figure 6 and 7). Here, the hcp gene is included in a conserved block (Figure 6 and 7). The non-conserved
regions in the T6SS-3 loci are generally associated with
a vgrG gene. An additional complete and two partial
vgrG genes can be found in the T6SS-3 locus of E. amylovora CFBP 1430. An additional non-conserved region,
encoding two predicted proteins, PANA_4135 and
PANA_4136 can be observed in the P. ananatis LMG
20103 T6SS-3 locus (Figure 7).
A further T6SS locus was identified in Pantoea sp. aBvalens (Figure 8). This 19.6 kb locus encodes thirteen
conserved core proteins. The IcmF phylogeny shows this
T6SS locus to be distantly related to all other Pantoea
and Erwinia T6SS loci. Similarly, an additional partial
T6SS locus is encoded on the E. billingiae Eb661 genome, which contains four T6SS core proteins. A nonconserved region associated with the vgrG gene is likewise present. This E. billingiae Eb661 T6SS locus is
flanked at both the 5’ (EbC_39320 - phage integrase) and
3’ end (EbC_393430-39600 - hypothetical phage genes)
by genes of an integrated phage element. A phage origin
has previously been hypothesized for the T6SS [17].
Different VgrG proteins are encoded in the T6SS-1, T6SS3 loci and additional T6SS loci

billingiae and Pantoea sp. aB-valens were analyzed for
the presence of conserved and evolved domains. The Nterminal region of all T6SS-1, T6SS-3 and additional
T6SS VgrG proteins is conserved among all Pantoea
and Erwinia species and contains a conserved VgrG
(TIGR3361 [37]) and phage Gp5 (pfam04717 [38])
domain (Figure 9). However, as has been observed in
other bacteria, the VgrG proteins differ considerably in
length between the various Pantoea and Erwinia species.
This can be attributed to variable C-terminal regions,
which suggest that they represent evolved VgrG proteins. Seven of the thirteen Pantoea and Erwinia T6SS-1
VgrG proteins contain such C-terminal extensions (Figure 10). Analysis of these C-terminal extensions showed
that several of them contain conserved domains. The P.
agglomerans E325 T6SS-1 VgrG2 protein (Pagg_1105)
contains a peptidoglycan (PG)-binding domain
(Pfam09374 [38] - Cdsearch score: 45) as well as
COG3926 and COG5526 lysozyme domains [39,40],
which were also found in the lytic bacteriophage 8,

suggesting a bacteriolytic function for this VgrG protein.
A similar function can be expected for the Pantoea sp.
aB-valens T6SS-1 VgrG (PANABDRAFT_2668) which
contains a b-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase domain
(COG4193 [40] - Cdsearch score: 58.5) in its C-terminal
extension. The E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 T6SS-1 VgrG2
(ETA_06370) C-terminal extension shows structural
homology to the Streptomyces sp. N174 chitosanase
(1_chk_A - Hhpred score: 190) [41].
The C-terminal extensions of VgrG proteins encoded
in the T6SS-3 loci of all Pantoea and Erwinia species
contain a conserved domain of unknown function
(COG4253), which is absent in the T6SS-1 loci VgrG
proteins (Figure 9). This domain has also been identified
flanking the N-terminal region of the S. enterica subsp.
arizonae IIIa VgrG proteins, while it is not present in
the VgrG proteins of other Salmonella serovars [14]. A
role for the COG4253 domain, which links the N-terminal VgrG transporter and C-terminal extension, in
modulating the function of the VgrG between secretion

and virulence has been suggested [15]. However, with
the exception of the P. agglomerans E325 T6SS-3 VgrG
protein, which carries a C-terminal extension subsequent to the COG4253 region, no further C-terminal
extensions are present in the Pantoea and Erwinia

T6SS-3 VgrG proteins. An alternative function in host
cell adhesion has also been suggested [16]. The latter
function would imply that the COG4253-positive T6SS3 and COG4253-negative T6SS-1 VgrG proteins could
have different targets and serve different functions. A

phylogeny based on the T6SS-1 and T6SS-3 VgrG proteins shows that they branch into two distinct clades
suggesting distinct evolutionary backgrounds for these
paralogous proteins (Figure 10). The VgrG protein
found in the additional T6SS locus in E. billingiae
Eb661 also contains a conserved COG4253 domain and
clusters with the T6SS-3 VgrG proteins, while the additional Pantoea sp. aB-valens VgrG paralog clusters with
the other VgrG proteins lacking this domain.
Non-conserved hcp/vgrG regions represent islands within
the T6SS loci

While the T6SS-1 and T6SS-3 loci share conserved and
syntenous cores among the various Pantoea and Erwinia
strains, considerable variability in the vgrG and hcp regions
can be observed. The G+C deviation across these T6SS
loci was determined. This showed that for the T6SS-1 and

T6SS-3 loci, there is a much lower G+C content in the
variable regions associated with the hcp and vgrG genes
compared to the conserved core regions (Figures 2 and 4).
In the T6SS-1 loci, the conserved core regions had an
average G+C content of 60.17% across all strains, while
the hcp regions (average G+C% = 42.30) and vgrG regions
(average G+C% = 47.91) had a much lower G+C content.
The substantial G+C deviations, variability in the gene
content of the hcp and vgrG regions and the differential
homology of proteins encoded in these regions to proteins
in bacteria in other genera indicates that these regions
represent variable islands within the T6SS loci. Similar G
+C deviations could be observed for the vgrG regions in
the additional Pantoea sp. aB-valens and E. billingiae
Eb661 T6SS loci, which further supports that these regions
serve as “hot spots” for rearrangement [36]. These hot
spots are frequently associated with Rhs proteins which

De Maayer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:576
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/576

are capable of displacing its C-terminal tip and replacing it
with a non-homologous alternative. By this means, the
Rhs protein can drive the sequential insertion of heterogeneous C-terminal sequences into the hot spot [36]. As the
additional E. billingiae Eb661 T6SS locus occurs within an
integrated phage element, we postulate that transducing
phages may play a role in the horizontal acquisition of
non-conserved genes in the vgrG and hcp regions. Similar
vgrG/hcp islands have also been identified in a number of
Pseudomonas species [42]. These islands are associated
with “orphan” vgrG and hcp paralogs separately located
from the remainder of the T6SS loci. In contrast, this is
the first observation of hcp and vgrG islands associated
with the conserved core T6SS loci. Analysis of the T6SS
loci of other bacteria (data not shown), however, shows
that this phenomenon is not restricted to Pantoea and
Erwinia.
Hcp/VgrG islands harbor putative effector proteins

The proteins encoded in the variable hcp and vgrG islands
in the T6SS-1 and T6SS-3 loci in the different Pantoea
and Erwinia species were analyzed for sequence similarity
and structural homology to known proteins and the presence of conserved domains. The majority of proteins
encoded on the islands showed homology to proteins of
unknown function. However, a number of island proteins
share high sequence identity and contain conserved
domains which suggest they may represent T6SS effectors
with putative functions in host-microbe and inter-bacterial
interactions (Additional File 1 Table S1).
The amino acid sequence of ETA_06430 encoded in the
E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 T6SS-1 vgrG island shares homology with a phospholipase in V. cholerae HE48
(VCHE48_2681 - 40% aa identity) while that of E. billingiae Eb661 EbC_4130 encoded on the T6SS-3 vgrG
island shows homology to a lipase/esterase in Yersinia bercovieri ATCC 43970 (Yberc0001_35290 -64% aa identity).
The former also shows structural homology to a P. aeruginosa lipase (1ex9_A - Hhpred score: 115) while the latter
shows structural homology to a lipase in Penicillium
expansum (3g7n_A: Hhpred score: 157), supporting that
these two proteins represent lipases. Similarly, EbC_39360
encoded in the additional T6SS of E. billingiae Eb661
shares weak structural homology with a lipase in Archaeoglobus fulgidus (2zyr_A - Hhpred score: 81.1). Lipases
hydrolyze long-chain triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol and have been shown to represent major virulence
factor in both animal and plant pathogens [43,44]. Genes
encoding lipases were also identified in the vgrG islands of
P. aeruginosa and transcriptome analysis showed that
their expression is co-regulated with that of the T6SS [42].
These lipases may therefore represent T6SS-secreted effectors in P. aeruginosa as well as the Erwinia species. Several
genes in the vgrG regions of both Pantoea and Erwinia

Page 11 of 15

T6SS-1 and T6SS-3 loci may encode proteases. The P.
agglomerans E325 Pagg2200 and E. tasmaniensis Et1/99
ETA_6240 proteins share 28% and 32% aa identity respectively with a putative zinc protease in Acinetobacter baumanii (AbauB_010100012633) and show weak structural
homology to a zinc metalloproteases in Geobacter sulfurreducens (3c37_A - Hhpred score: 47.3 and 51.3, respectively). Furthermore, the P. agglomerans E325 Pagg_1085,
E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 ETA_6210 and E. amylovora CFBP
1430 EAMY_3018 protein sequences show weak structural
homology to the secreted cysteine protease stathopain
(1cv8_A - Hhpred score: 29.8 34.2 and 34.2, respectively),
which plays a role in skin infection by Staphylococcus aureus [45]. EbC_39340 and EbC_39350 localized in the vgrG
island in the additional T6SS locus of E. billingiae Eb661
encode proteins with weak structural homology to the
secreted Clostridium perfringens sialidase NanI (2bf6_A Hhpred score: 46 and 44.3, respectively) which is involved
in the removal of sialic acids from host glycoconjugates
with an important role in bacterial nutrition and pathogenesis [46]. PANA_4143 associated with the T6SS-3 in P.
ananatis LMG 20103, shares high sequence homology
with the M23 peptidase of Klebsiella sp. 92-3
(HMPREF9538_05689: 78% aa identity) and extensive
structural homology to the secreted chitinase G of Streptomyces coelicolor of (1chk_A - Hhpred score: 203). Chitinases degrade chitin, the carbohydrate polymer found in
insect shells and the cell walls of fungi, suggesting the
T6SS of P. ananatis LMG 20103 may secrete an effector
with an antifungal or insecticidal function [47].
Two proteins, PANA_2363 and Pagg_2194, encoded
in the T6SS-1 and T6SS-3 hcp islands of P. ananatis
LMG20103 and P. agglomerans E325, respectively contain conserved peptidoglycan binding (Pfam01474 PG_binding_1) and LysM (Pfam01476) domains which
are typically associated with proteins involved in bacterial cell wall degradation. The latter also shows sequence
homology to a putative lytic enzyme in Acinetobacter
calcoaceticus RUH2202 (HMPREF0012_02474 - 34% aa
identity). Similarly, E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163T Epyr_0675
shares sequence homology with a Edwardsiella tarda
FL6-60 lysozyme (ETAF_ple052 - 32% aa identity) and
also contains a conserved peptidoglycan binding domain
(Pfam09374 - PG_binding_3) and a domain of unknown
function (DUF847) frequently observed in lysozymes.
The E. billingiae Eb661 EbC_05851 protein also shares
sequence homology with the Pseudomonas phage PaP1
endolysin (PaP1_gp072 - 46% aa identity). The presence
of domains conserved in bacterial cell wall degrading
enzymes and the sequence homology to these enzymes
indicate that these proteins may play a similar role
to the Tse1 and Tse3 lytic enzymes in P. aeruginosa
in the degradation of the bacterial cell wall and may
thus have a bactericidal function [12,48]. Furthermore,

De Maayer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:576

PANA_4136 encoded in the additional non-conserved
region in the P. ananatis LMG 20103 T6SS-3 locus
shows extensive sequence homology to S-pyocin domain
containing proteins in E. coli 3030-1 (EC30301_3278 58% aa identity) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IP
31758 (YpsIP31758_0897 - 53% aa identity) and shows
weak structural homology to the colicin S4 of Escherichia coli (3few_X - Hhpred score: 45.5). Similarly, weak
structural homology to colicin S4 can be observed for
the T6SS hcp island P. vagans C9-1 Pvag_1032, Pantoea
sp. At-9b Pat9b_2515 and Pantoea sp. aB-valens
PANABDRAFT_2446 proteins (3few_X - Hhpred score:
60, 58.5 and 58.4, respectively). Colicins and pyocins are
bacteriocins that are involved in killing closely related
bacterial species [49]. The presence of bacteriocin-like
proteins in the T6SS loci of these Pantoea species agrees
with the finding of a potential function for the T6SS in
antibiosis and competition [11,12].
Pantoea and Erwinia VgrG and Hcp proteins may carry
effector proteins encoded in the vgrG and hcp islands

Analysis of the G+C contents of the Pantoea and Erwinia
T6SS-1 vgrG genes shows that the N-terminal regions,
which contain the conserved VgrG and Gp5 domains,
have an average G+C content of 63.68%, which is similar
to the conserved core of the T6SS-1 loci. By contrast, the
C-terminal extensions have an average G+C content of
46.59%. This is similar to the non-conserved vgrG island,
suggesting that the C-terminal extensions form part of
the vgrG islands. In the T6SS-3 loci, the conserved Nterminal region of the vgrG genes has an average G+C
content of 59.01% while the vgrG islands have an average
G+C content of 48.38%.
Some of the proteins encoded in the vgrG islands show
sequence homology and contain conserved domains found
in the C-terminal extensions of evolved VgrG proteins.
The E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163T T6SS-1 Epyr_00675 amino
acid sequence shares 75% aa identity with the C-terminal
region of the P. agglomerans E325 T6SS-1 evolved VgrG
(Pagg_1105). The P. ananatis LMG 20103 T6SS-1
PANA_2363 and the C-terminal region of the evolved
T6SS-1 VgrG of P. agglomerans E325 (Pagg_1105) also
each contain a PG-binding domain and a LysM domain
(Pfam01476) found in lytic enzymes, and show structural
homology a cell wall degrading lysozyme in Pseudomonas
phage Phikz (2kbh_A - Hhpred score: 128 and 44.5,
respectively). BlastP analysis with the proteins encoded in
the vgrG islands against the NCBI protein database
showed that proteins encoded in the vgrG islands of several Pantoea and Erwinia species show substantial
sequence identity to the C-terminal extensions in VgrG in
bacteria belonging to other genera (Additional File 1 Table
S1). The putative lytic enzymes encoded in the T6SS-1
vgrG islands of P. ananatis LMG 20103 (PANA_2363) and

Page 12 of 15

E. billingiae Eb661 (EbC_05851) share homology with the
C-terminal extensions in the VgrG proteins of V. cholerae
TMA21 (VCB_002278 - 41% aa identity) and V. cholerae
CT 5369-63 (VIH_000452 - 49% aa identity), respectively.
The putative zinc proteases encoded in the P. agglomerans
E325 T6SS-3 vgrG island (Ppag_2200) and the E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 T6SS-1 vgrG island (ETA_06240) share 43
and 46% aa identity with the C-terminal extension of a
Burkholderia sp. 383 VgrG protein (Bcep18194_C7612).
Similarly, the putative E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 lipase
(ETA_06430) shows 42% aa identity to the Burkholderia
glumae BGR1 VgrG (Bglu_2g02560). The sequence
homology and the presence of shared conserved domains
between the C-terminal extensions of evolved VgrG proteins and putative effector proteins encoded in the vgrG
islands, suggest that VgrG proteins may carry effector proteins encoded in the vgrG islands. The COG4253 conserved domain found at the C-terminal end of all the
T6SS-3 VgrG proteins may be involved in the anchorage
of the VgrG transporter to the effector proteins, thereby
modulating the function of the VgrG protein as a structural component of the T6SS apparatus and the transport
of effector proteins [15]. This domain is absent in the
T6SS-1 loci, and the means by which effectors become
associated with the VgrG transport region would need to
be determined.
In the fish pathogen Edwardsiella tarda, the secreted
effector protein EvpP has been shown to interact with
the Hcp protein [50]. Furthermore, Hcp orthologs with
C-terminal extensions have been identified in S. enterica,
which may represent evolved Hcp proteins [14]. It is
therefore plausible that, as is the case for the Pantoea
and Erwinia VgrG proteins, the Hcp proteins may transport effector proteins encoded on the hcp islands. By this
means, various effector proteins could be tagged to the
VgrG and Hcp proteins, thereby forming different VgrGeffector and Hcp-effector combinations, which may perform different biological functions. The VgrG or Hcp
proteins could transport bacteriocins or pyocins, which
would allow the bacterium to target other bacteria competing for an ecological niche. A chitinase effector carried
by the VgrG protein could play an antifungal or insecticidal role in the Pantoea and Erwinia species. These and
other putative pathogenicity factors encoded by hypothetical proteins in the hcp and vgrG islands translocated by
the VgrG and Hcp proteins may therefore enable Pantoea and Erwinia species to target a range of bacterial,
invertebrate, vertebrate and or plant hosts.

Conclusions
Comparative analysis of the genome sequences of several
Pantoea and Erwinia species revealed that they encode
between two and four T6SS loci. This suggests an important biological role for this secretion system in these two

De Maayer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:576

genera. Two of the T6SS loci, T6SS-1 and T6SS-2 are
shared among all Pantoea and Erwinia strains, while
orthologs of the third locus are only found in four of five
Pantoea species and two of four Erwinia species, suggesting acquisition by horizontal gene transfer of this locus.
Pantoea sp. aB-valens and E. billingiae Eb661 encode
additional T6SS loci. Analysis of the T6SS-1, T6SS-3 and
additional loci in Pantoea sp. aB-valens and E. billingiae
Eb661 showed that while synteny is conserved among the
Pantoea and Erwinia species for each locus, non-conserved regions could be observed associated with the hcp
and vgrG genes. The G+C contents of these non-conserved regions differ substantially from the conserved
portions of the loci, indicating horizontal acquisition of
these regions separate from the rest of the T6SS loci. Several of the VgrG proteins encoded in the loci have a Cterminal extension and represent evolved VgrG proteins.
These C-terminal extensions likewise have lower G+C
contents than the remainder of the T6SS suggesting they
form part of the vgrG islands.
Many of the proteins encoded in the vgrG and hcp
islands carry conserved domains and show sequence
and structural homology to proteins with various biological functions including antibiosis, fungal cell wall
degradation and putative roles in animal and plant
pathogenesis. We postulate that the vgrG and hcp
islands may represent evolutionary hot spots for genes
that encode effector proteins. Similar rearrangement hot
spots have been observed in the regions adjacent to the
hcp and vgrG genes in the T6SS loci of other bacteria
[18,36], suggesting that this is a more widespread phenomenon. The sequence similarity and structural
homology of some of these putative effector proteins to
C-terminal extensions in characterized evolved VgrG
proteins suggest that they may become tagged to the
conserved core VgrG proteins which serve as transporters for these effectors, thereby forming new evolved
VgrG proteins. Similarly, putative effectors encoded in
the hcp islands may become associated with the Hcp
proteins to form evolved Hcp proteins. We could therefore speak of “evolving” Hcp and VgrG proteins. By tagging various effector proteins different VgrG-effector
and Hcp-effector combinations could be formed which
may perform different biological functions. Thereby, the
genomic islands associated with the Hcp and VgrG proteins could drive functional diversification of the T6SS,
which may explain the plethora of biological roles
described for this secretion system.

Methods
In silico identification of the T6SS loci in Pantoea and
Erwinia

The T6SS loci in five Pantoea and four Erwinia species,
for which complete or draft genome sequences are

Page 13 of 15

available, were identified: Pantoea ananatis LMG 20103
[31], Pantoea vagans C9-1 [32], Pantoea agglomerans
E325 (Smits and Duffy, unpublished results), Pantoea
sp. aB-valens [29], Pantoea sp. At-9b [30], Erwinia amylovora CFBP 1430 [22], Erwinia pyrifoliae DSM 12163T
[33], Erwinia tasmaniensis Et1/99 [35] and Erwinia billingiae Eb661 [25]. Identification of the T6SS loci was
done by BlastP analysis [51] with the conserved core
proteins identified by Boyer et al. [15] against local protein databases created for the Pantoea and Erwinia
strains. Proteins neighboring Pantoea and Erwinia T6SS
clusters were compared using BlastP against the NCBI
protein database [52] to identify to full extent of the
T6SS loci. Sequence manipulations were conducted with
multiple subroutines of the LASERGENE package
(DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).
Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic analyses were done using the procedures
outlined by Bingle et al. [53]. A ClustalW alignment
with default parameters was performed with the IcmF
(COG3523) amino acid sequences, as this represents the
only protein conserved among all Pantoea and Erwinia
T6SS loci. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) v.
5.0.3 software package [54], using the neighbor-joining
method, with Poisson correction, complete gap deletion
and bootstrapping (n = 1,000) parameters. The IcmF
amino acid sequences from the T6SS loci of several closely related organisms as identified by BlastP analysis
against the NCBI protein database [52] were included in
the tree. This same procedure was employed to construct phylogenetic trees for Gyrase B (GyrB) and the
VgrG proteins.
Analyses of the hcp/vgrG islands

The average G+C contents for the conserved core
regions and hcp and vgrG islands of the T6SS loci were
determined using the Bioedit v.7.0.5.3 package [55]. The
G+C content was determined using 50 bp windows in
10 bp steps. Similarly, the G+C contents for the vgrG
genes were determined for the conserved N-terminal
region, which included the conserved Vgr and Gp5
domains, and for the C-terminal extension which was
considered as all nucleotides located at the 3’ end of the
Gp5 domain. Proteins encoded in the vgrG and hcp
islands were identified using the FgenesB [56] and Orf
finder [57] web servers. The amino acid sequences for
the proteins encoded in the hcp and vgrG islands were
analyzed for sequence identity by BlastP analysis against
the NCBI protein database [51,52] the presence of conserved domains by Blast analysis against the Conserved
Domain Database (CDsearch) [58,59]. Structural homology of the vgrG and hcp island proteins to those for

De Maayer et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:576

which the chemical structure has been determined was
performed using the HHpred server (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred) [60,61].
