Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic promoter prediction using computational analysis techniques is one of
the most difficult jobs in computational genomics that is essential for constructing and
understanding genetic regulatory networks. The increased availability of sequence data for various
eukaryotic organisms in recent years has necessitated for better tools and techniques for the
prediction and analysis of promoters in eukaryotic sequences. Many promoter prediction methods
and tools have been developed to date but they have yet to provide acceptable predictive
performance. One obvious criteria to improve on current methods is to devise a better system for
selecting appropriate features of promoters that distinguish them from non-promoters. Secondly
improved performance can be achieved by enhancing the predictive ability of the machine learning
algorithms used.
Results: In this paper, a novel approach is presented in which 128 4-mer motifs in conjunction with
a non-linear machine-learning algorithm utilising a Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to
distinguish between promoter and non-promoter DNA sequences. By applying this approach to
plant, Drosophila, human, mouse and rat sequences, the classification model has showed 7-fold
cross-validation percentage accuracies of 83.81%, 94.82%, 91.25%, 90.77% and 82.35% respectively.
The high sensitivity and specificity value of 0.86 and 0.90 for plant; 0.96 and 0.92 for Drosophila;
0.88 and 0.92 for human; 0.78 and 0.84 for mouse and 0.82 and 0.80 for rat demonstrate that this
technique is less prone to false positive results and exhibits better performance than many other
tools. Moreover, this model successfully identifies location of promoter using TATA weight matrix.
Conclusion: The high sensitivity and specificity indicate that 4-mer frequencies in conjunction with
supervised machine-learning methods can be beneficial in the identification of RNA pol II
promoters comparative to other methods. This approach can be extended to identify promoters
in sequences for other eukaryotic genomes.

1 Background
A promoter is a signal element on a DNA molecule that
specifies a controlling region of a gene where RNA
polymerase binds to initiate the transcription of the gene.
RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) in eukaryotic cell binds
the promoter signals of all protein-coding sequences. As
there is no common collective occurrence of these signals
it is extremely difficult to predict the promoter efficiently
using an arbitrary or small set of predetermined signals.
The approach adopted in this research considers a much
larger set of signals that are not mutually exclusive and
increases the success rate of finding a promoter in a given
sequence significantly. A number of methods for the prediction of promoters, TSS (Transcription Start Signals)
and TF (Transcription Factor) binding sites in eukaryotic
DNA sequence presently exist [1,2].
Although contemporary algorithms have improved on
predictive ability, a lot more research is required to
achieve satisfactory levels of performance. Many generalpurpose promoter prediction implementations can typically recognize only ~50% of the promoters with a false
positive (FP) rate of ~1 per 700–1000 bp [2]. A stepwise
strategy method CorePromoter based on localization of
functional promoter and TSS region was suggested by
Zhang. [3] The use of Markov chain models in promoter
prediction tools by Ohler et al. [4] improved the results
slightly but they identified the same 50% of promoters
from the dataset analyzed by Fickett and Hatzigeorgiou
[2], while having a false positive prediction rate of 1/849
bp. Later Ohler [5] improved the result by incorporating
some prominent motifs such as TATA, DRE, INR, DPE,
MTE [6] to discriminate promoter and non-promoter
using Hidden Markov Model. Also, another promoter
identification program, Promoter 2.0, designed by Knudsen [7] applied a combination of neural networks and
genetic algorithms. Promoter 2.0 was experienced on recognizing promoters in the complete Adenovirus genome
(35,937 bp). The program predicted some known promoter sites such as TATA box, cap site, CCAAT box and GC
box on the positive strand and 30 false promoters. Pandey
et. al. [8] analyzed plant promoters in terms of their structural and sequence dependent properties like curvature
and periodicity. Promoters with TATA box and without
TATA box have also been analyzed in this regard.
Since completion of the sequencing of the human
genome, the efficiency of promoter prediction tools
became critical and still poses a major challenge. PromoterInspector program [9] was the first software tool used
to identify the promoters in human chromosome 22. This
method identifies ~50% of known promoters as genomic
regions up to 1 kb in length by discriminating them from
the exon, intron and 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR)
sequences. Davuluri et al. proposed FirstEF program

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/414

which included a decision tree based on structural and
compositional discriminating features such as CpG
islands, promoter regioins and first splice-donor sites
[10]. In 2002, Bajic et al. [11] reported the Dragon Promoter Finder (DBF) program [12], which used sensors for
three functional regions: promoters, exons and introns.
Their findings claimed that DBF has higher accuracy than
three other promoter finding programs which they had
investigated namely: NNPP 2.1 [13-15] Promoter2.0
[7,16]and PromoterInspector [17]. Also in 2002, Down
and Hubbard [18] reported a novel hybrid machine-learning method capable of predicting > 50% of human TSS
with a specificity of > 70%. Xiao et. al. [19] predicted Pol
II promoter sequence by cooperating Transcription Factor
Binding Site (TFB) with the promoter sequence. They have
identified that nearly 71% of the promoter sequences contain transcription factor with known cooperation. Rajeev
et. al. [20] proposed another promoter identification tool
where they identified the promoter sequence from non
promoter sequence using non linear time series descriptor
using non linear machine learning algorithm, such as
SVM. Their approach showed 87% accuracy in 10 fold
cross-validation test with an independent test having
accuracy of near 85% in identifying promoter and nonpromoter. Yet another promoter prediction tool, TSSPTCM has been trained and adapted for plants [21]. In the
test set of TATA promoters, the program correctly predicted TSS for 35 out of 40 (87.5%) genes. For 25 TATAless promoters, TSSs were predicted for 21 out of 25
(84%) genes, including 14 cases of 5 bp distance between
annotated and predicted TSSs. A different approach was
undertook by Gershenzon and Ioshikhes, besides identifying core promoter elements in Human they tried to
demonstrate the synergistic effect of the combination of
several core promoter elements for the initiation of the
transcription [22]. While Jin et al. later in their study
revealed a three-way synergistic effect using a degree of
conservation between orthologous mouse and human
sequence [23].
The proposed method in this paper demonstrates that
with the aid of PromMachine- a machine-learning tool,
promoters are distinguished from the non-promoter
sequences on the basis of abundance of some characteristic 4-mer motifs. The PromMachine is trained with 128
distinguishing 4-mers that can discriminate between promoter and non promoter. Using this knowledge the
machine-learning tool can efficiently decide whether a
given sequence contains a promoter or not.
With high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy the proposed approach shows high efficiency in promoter prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences. Being applicable
for any reasonable length (251 bp length of a promoter is
considered to be a reasonable length) of given sequences

this approach can become a dynamic tool for finding promoters of other eukaryotes.

achieved, which demonstrates the high performance of
the proposed model for correctly identifying a promoter
as a promoter and a non-promoter as a non-promoter.
Also it demonstrates that, the model is less prone to false
positive and false negative. Besides sensitivity and specificity, a number of other statistical procedures such as correlation coefficient (Corr.), false positive rate (FPR), false
negative rate (FNR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood (PL) and
negative likelihood (NL) are also calculated for each of the
species. The FPR values for each species show that the proportions of negative instances that are erroneously
reported as being positive are low.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Prediction Accuracy
Different statistical measures have been used to analyze
the performance of the proposed model. In order to test
the prediction accuracy, 50 known promoter sequences
from each species i.e. human, mouse, plant, rat and Drosophila as well as 50 known non-promoter sequences for
each of those five species are initially taken for the test.
Then taking one species at a time i.e. 50 known promoter
and 50 known non-promoter for that species, the previously trained model is applied and tested upon these test
data. It is to be mentioned that these test dataset are completely independent from the training set. In most of the
case the model correctly predicts the promoters and nonpromoter in these test data. Sensitivity and specificity are
two widely used techniques for performance evaluation,
which are defined as following, where TP is true positive,
FN is false negative, FP is false positive and TN is truly negative.

Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN)

(1)

Specificity = TN/(FP + TN)

The PPV values in Table 1 shows that about 80% times a
promoter is correctly identified as promoter in rat,
whereas this accuracy increased to 83% in mouse, 89% in
plant and 92% for both Drosophila and human. However, because the PPV depends on the prevalence of the
dataset, a same proportion of positive and negative data
are taken for the test. The likelihood ratios are also calculated, as it is independent of the prevalence (Table 1).

(2)

Cross validation is another statistical process for estimating the predictive accuracy of a classifier on data. In this
process, the whole dataset i.e. both positive and negative
data for a given species is partitioned into subsets in such
a way that the analysis is made on one subset while all the
other subsets are used for training. To analyze the performance of some other n-mers; first, 3, 4 and 5-mers are
generated and tested against the same dataset. A cross-validation accuracy of 81.78%, 83.81% and 83.27% are

The results of sensitivity and specificity for all the species
are recorded in Table 1. As it can be seen from Table 1 a
sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 90% for plant; 96%
and 92% for Drosophila; 88% and 92% for human; 78%
and 84% for mouse and finally 82% and 80% for rat are

obtained, which justifies the use of 4-mer motif for proposed promoter prediction methodology. A differential
hexamer technique was used earlier by Hutchinson for
identifying vertebrate promoter; on 29 test sequences he
correctly distinguished 18 promoters as true positive
whereas 11 were false positive, which gave him a Sensitivity of 62.1%. The result improved up to 71.4% when only
sequences of length above 10,000 were considered [24].
Also Chan and Kibler have used 6-mer distribution for
identifying cis-regulatory motifs in Drosophila and
obtained a Sensitivity and Specificity of 38.68%, 93.77%,
and the PPV was 36.05% [25], which is significantly
improved upon by the method proposed in this paper
(Table 1). This supports the significance of 4-mer distribution used here compared to other n-mers. The rational of
4-mer giving better results is, for lower or higher mers the
frequency distribution of the feature set are not descriptive
enough for the SVM classifier to distinguish promoters
from the non-promoters. Moreover a significant overrepresentation of 4-mer motif such as ATAA, TATA or TCAG
was confirmed earlier by Ohler et al. [26], it may also
speculate the justification of 4-mer performing better than
some other n-mers.
When the model presented in the paper is trained with the
128 discriminating 4-mer features of a given species and
tested; the results from the model are promising. A 7-fold
cross validation for all five species displays accuracy of
83.81%, 94.82%, 91.25%, 90.77% and 82.35% for plant,
Drosophila, human, mouse and rat respectively (Table 2).
The high-percentage of correct value, correlation coefficient for this proposed model clearly indicates that calculated frequencies of 4-mer sequences are capable of
discriminating with high accuracy between promoter and
non-promoter regions. The top five 4-mers which are
most frequent in the promoter dataset of all five species
are listed in Table 3. A union of these motifs across the
species results in a total of 18 motifs all together. The positional distributions of these 18 motifs for each of the five
species are shown in Figure 1. Although measuring the
conservation of these 4-mer motifs across different species
is outside the scope of this research but positional conserveness of the 18 motifs in each five species i.e. where in
the sequence dataset for a given species these 18 motifs
mostly exists, can be observed from the figures presented.

Also the top 10 discriminating features (motifs) between
plant promoter and plant non-promoter are listed in
Table 4.
In addition, the proposed method identifies the location
of the TATA box using TATA weighted matrix [27]. For this
a sliding window technique is used with a window size of
12 and cutoff score of the matrix is selected as 7.16. Each
time the window is shifted by 1 bp across the sequences.
The windows with a TATA box score exceeding the cutoff
score are accepted as TATA Box. This indicates the possible
location of promoter. As TATA box is usually located 25
base pairs upstream to the transcription start site (TSS),
using this information TSS can also be identified in the
TATA Box containing promoter sequences.
2.2 Comparison with existing methods
Similarity based methods such as BLAST is normally the
first choice to distinguish between two different set of
data. But no significant distinguishable features are identified using promoter-promoter, non-promoter – nonpromoter and promoter-non-promoter BLAST search. To
date various algorithms and methods are used for promoter prediction. Using these algorithms, some widely
used promoter prediction tools have been developed, e.g.
Soft Berry, Dragon Promoter Finder, Neural Network Promoter Prediction, Promoter 2.0 Prediction Server and Promoter Scan.

However, the model proposed here demonstrates even
better performance than these tools. The results shown in
Table 5 clearly indicate that the prediction accuracy of the
model is much higher in comparison to other tools. There
are a number of key features in this model which contribute to the improved performance such as the use of larger
sets (128) of discriminating features between promoters
and non promoters and the utilisation of the supervised
learning system- SVM. Other prominent promoter prediction tools use either a statistical approach or Neural Network such as SoftBerry (TSSP). However, SVM has outperformed both of these approaches in pattern matching
and supervised learning. Also most of the afore-mentioned approaches are limited in the number of features
used as the promoter signals such as TATA box or Initiator
etc. In contrast, the model described in this paper, uses
SVM to detect a greater set of signals than previously
attempted to date to decide whether a sequence is a promoter or non promoter. The additional features developed in the course of this research show that a significant
increase in promoter prediction can be achieved using this
method.

in this paper is not likely to vary much using other database, cause the proposed method does not rely on the
identification of the TATA box for discriminating promoters from non-promoters. Incorporating comparative
genomics certainly can extend the method. It would
reduce the false discovery rate further, as at a moderate
phylogenetic distance the functional elements are known
to be more conserved for orthologous gene [23,29]. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the approach proposed here
would be a extremely useful and an efficient tool to meet
the demands of the molecular biologists.

4 Methods
4.1 Promoter Sequence Database
To accomplish the task of RNA polymerase II promoter
prediction, the plant promoter dataset is taken from
PlantProm database [27]. A total of 305 entries of plant
promoter sequence are obtained from PlantProm DB.
Also to make the model applicable to predict promoters
in Drosophila, human, mouse and rat, a number of 1922,
1863, 190 and 119 promoter sequences respectively are
collected from EPD (Eukaryotic Promoter Database)
[30,31]. These data are used for training the proposed
model and tested against mutually exclusive data from the
same data source. Sequence segments from -200 to +51
relative to TSS are considered from the EPD for the experiment. On the other hand -200 to +51 segments are taken
from PlantProm DB.

3 Conclusion
The successful prediction of promoters with high accuracy
using frequency distribution of 4-mer sequences shows
that this novel method has significant merit as an
approach for successful eukaryotic promoter prediction.
The principal objective of this work was to develop an efficient tool that can discriminate between promoter and
non-promoter in an unknown sequence with high accuracy. The high accuracy of promoter prediction in plant,
human, Drosophila, mouse and rat (Table 2) using our
approach has validated the use of frequency distribution
of 4-mers in discrimination between promoter and non
promoter regions in eukaryotic sequences. However,
though the approach is very efficient in predicting the
presence of promoter in a given sequence, it cannot locate
the position of the TSS when TATA box is not present. This
challenge should be resolved in future if other signals can
be characterized for specific position in the sequence. The
improvement of identification of all TSS site will be considered in future using various published databases such
as MPromDB, TRED, DBTSS etc. Though the EPD is
known to have a TATA bias [23,28], the result presented

4.2 Non-Promoter Sequence Database
The non-promoter sequences are extracted from Unigene
database that belongs to EMBL. CDSs are the best non
promoter sequence because it contain no promoter
sequences and so for every organism specific model an
equal number of CDSs are usaed in the training process as
the non promoter sequence.
4.3 Support Vector Machine
SVM, a supervised machine-learning technique has been
used for discriminating between promoter and non-promoter sequences. SVM classifiers solve multi-class classification problems using the structural minimization
principle. Given a training set in a vector space, SVMs can
find the best decision hyper plane, which separates two
classes. The quality of the decision hyper plane depends

on the difference margin between the two hyperplanes
defined by the SVM [32]. For a typical learning task P(X,
y) = P(y|X)P(X), an inductive SVM learner aims to build a
decision function. Here Xi ∈ X are objects of the training
set and yi ∈ {-1, 1} are their known classes.
fn: X → {-1,1} based on a training set S which is fn =
fn(Strain)
where Strain = (X1, y1), (X2, y2),..., (Xn, yn).
It is necessary to select a kernel function and the regularization parameter in each Binary Classifier and in this
instance, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) [32] is selected
as the kernel function. Because the RBF kernel nonlinearly
maps samples into a higher dimensional space, it can handle cases where the relations are non linear. The SVM classification problem can be formulated in terms of a convex
quadratic optimization problem as

4.4 Procedure
4.4.1 Selection of features
Taking all four nucleotides (A, T, C and G) a 44 = 256 different 4-mers combinations are generated. In order to
select most discriminating features the frequency of each
of these features are calculated. In this procedure the fij
and fnij are calculated, where fij is the frequency of each ith
4-mer motif (i = 1...256) in jth known promoter sequence
and fnij is the frequency of each ith 4-mer in jth known
non-promoter sequence. Then this fij and fnij are used for
calculating Pi and NPi for which the equation is given
below.

Where, Pi is the summation of frequencies in n promoter
sequences for each ith 4-mer (i = 1...256) and NPi is the
summation of frequencies in n non-promoter sequences
for each ith 4-mer. The absolute difference between the
numbers of occurrences of all 256 possible combinations
of 4-mers in known promoter and non-promoter
sequences are calculated using Diffi = |Pi - NPi |, where Diffi
is the absolute difference of the occurrence of ith 4-mer
between known promoter and non promoter. The value
of these 256 Diffi are then sorted in descending order and
the top 128 4-mers for which the Diffi is maximum are
selected as features of the proposed model. All the selected
n known promoter and n known non-promoter sequence
are of length 251 bp. A single strand search of 251 bp window has been conducted during the frequency calculation.

In the above equation N is the total number of input vectors, αi is any real value that maximizes the function, xi is
any real number as the input vectors and yi be their corresponding target class, which is either -1 or 1 in binary classifier. LIBSVM – a library for SVM developed by ChihChung
Chang
and
Chih-Jen
Lin
http://
www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ is used to train in a
supervised manner on a collection of promoter and nonpromoter training sequences. The model developed from
this training set is then used to predict the promoter
sequences from a test sequence.

4.4.2 Training with SVM
The frequency fij of the top 128 4-mer motifs are used to
find the promoter (or non-promoter) in a given sequence.
Here i range from 1 to 128 and j range from 1 to n. A scaling factor is introduced to bring the numerical value of fij
in between 0 and 1 using equation 4.

d ij =

f ij − min( f1, f 2 ,..., f128 )

(6)

max( f1… f128 )

Here, the numerical value of dij ranges from 0 to 1.
Here, the value dij is the scaled value of ith 4-mer in jth
sequence. A complete set of dij values of all the promoter
and non-promoter sequences is then used to train the
SVM for a given species.
Libsvm [33], which is an efficient software for SVM classification and regression, is trained with the frequency patterns of the 128 characteristic 4-mer motifs in known
promoters and non-promoters. A model is then built that
can be used to distinguish between promoter and non
promoter in test sequences.
4.4.3 Testing
To substantiate the machine-learning model, Jackknife
[34] validation could be the ideal process. Jackknife is a
method that creates a series of statistics from a single data
set by generating that statistic repeatedly on the data set
leaving one data value out each time which produces a
mean estimate of the parameter and a standard deviation
of the estimates of the parameter. This validation method
is time consuming. So to speed up the process, a 7-fold

cross-validation is performed where the whole dataset is
divided into 7 random parts and 7 iterations are performed to predict the accuracy. In every iteration 6 parts
are used for training and the other part is used for testing.
In the following iteration the other 6 parts are used for
training and the remaining part is used for testing.
