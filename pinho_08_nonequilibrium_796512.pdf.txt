Abstract
Background: The study of recently-diverged species offers significant challenges both in the
definition of evolutionary entities and in the estimation of gene flow among them. Iberian and North
African wall lizards (Podarcis) constitute a cryptic species complex for which previous assessments
of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and allozyme variation are concordant in describing the existence
of several highly differentiated evolutionary units. However, these studies report important
differences suggesting the occurrence of gene flow among forms. Here we study sequence variation
in two nuclear introns, β-fibint7 and 6-Pgdint7, to further investigate overall evolutionary dynamics
and test hypotheses related to species delimitation within this complex.
Results: Both nuclear gene genealogies fail to define species as monophyletic. To discriminate
between the effects of incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow in setting this pattern, we
estimated migration rates among species using both FST-based estimators of gene flow, which
assume migration-drift equilibrium, and a coalescent approach based on a model of divergence with
gene flow. Equilibrium estimates of gene flow suggest widespread introgression between species,
but coalescent estimates describe virtually zero admixture between most (but not all) species pairs.
This suggests that although gene flow among forms may have occurred the main cause for species
polyphyly is incomplete lineage sorting, implying that most forms have been isolated since their
divergence. This observation is therefore in accordance with previous reports of strong
differentiation based on mtDNA and allozyme data.
Conclusion: These results corroborate most forms of Iberian and North African Podarcis as
differentiated, although incipient, species, supporting a gradual view of speciation, according to
which species may persist as distinct despite some permeability to genetic exchange and without
having clearly definable genetic boundaries. Additionally, this study constitutes a warning against the
misuse of equilibrium estimates of migration among recently-diverged groups.

Background
The study of emerging species poses several challenges for
evolutionary biologists. From a phylogenetic perspective,
for example, attempts to reconstruct relationships among
such taxa are often hampered by a poor resolution of relationships, by lack of monophyly inferred from individual
gene genealogies due to incomplete lineage sorting or,
when multiple loci are analysed, by discordant scenarios
portrayed by distinct genealogies. When a species splits
into two, the diverging forms will share much of their
genetic variation for a long period of time and the preexisting polymorphism may be sorted in a stochastic fashion or reflect differential selective pressures, not necessarily tracking species-splitting events. Moreover, closelyrelated species are likely to retain some permeability to
the exchange of genes, which may affect some loci more
than others [1,2]. These features become even more striking when more than two species are involved; in rapidly
radiating taxa the chance of incomplete lineage sorting
increases and complex patterns of admixture often arise,
complicating the recognition of species boundaries in the
context of both biological and phylogenetic species definition criteria [3-6]. As a consequence, an additional complication arises when attempting to estimate levels of gene
flow among such nascent species because of the need to
discriminate between the amount of polymorphism that
is shared due to incomplete lineage sorting and to actual
genetic exchange. In fact, several widely-used estimates of
gene flow such as Wright's [7] equation relating FST and
the product Nm assume equilibrium migration and therefore may not perform well in species that are still undergoing lineage sorting and therefore violate this
assumption [8-10]. Recent analytical methods [10,11], in
contrast, do not assume equilibrium and allow the analysis of gene flow and divergence in the same framework,
thus being appropriate tools to evaluate migration rates
among recently diverged taxa.
Podarcis wall lizards in the Iberian Peninsula and North
Africa constitute a cryptic species complex that has been
studied using both mtDNA [12-15] and allozyme data
[16-18]. In concordance with emerging morphological
evidence [19-21] both types of markers have documented
the existence of several highly differentiated population
groups, some of which correspond to the currently
accepted species (P. bocagei, P. carbonelli and P. vaucheri),
whereas others constitute different forms within the polytypic and, from a mitochondrial perspective, paraphyletic
P. hispanica. Reported genetic distances at the mitochondrial level are higher than traditional species-delimitation
thresholds proposed for squamates [22]. However, not all
the mitochondrial DNA lineages seem to belong to clearly
distinct morphological entities [23]. Moreover, although
both nuclear and mitochondrial markers provide roughly
concordant species delimitation, a detailed comparison of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/63

both analyses reports two significant differences [18].
First, not all of the forms detected using mtDNA are readily distinguishable using allozymes, which could result
either from massive introgression of the nuclear genome
or from the low number of loci studied coupled with low
overall diversity levels observed in allozymes, limiting
their ability to detect subtle population structure. Secondly, evolutionary relationships between species and
forms within P. hispanica as depicted by mtDNA are very
well supported, suggesting a "step-by-step" speciation scenario, whereas the analyses of allozymes produces only a
few well-supported multi-species clusters, implying a radiation scenario. These discordant results were interpreted
as reflecting the shorter time required by mtDNA to
achieve monophyly [18]. Despite their utility in this case
of corroborating the major partitions inferred from
mtDNA, allozyme analyses have several drawbacks, of
which the most important for comparing the patterns of
mitochondrial and nuclear levels of divergence is the lack
of a genealogical framework to understand the relationships between alleles and the evolutionary processes
underlying the distribution of genetic variation.
In this work we aim to analyse the evolutionary history of
the Iberian and North African Podarcis species complex
from a yet unexplored perspective: nuclear genealogies.
We studied nucleotide variation at two nuclear introns in
individuals representing all known morphotypes and
mitochondrial lineages. Our main goals were: a) to investigate whether species and forms of Podarcis are monophyletic with respect to nuclear genealogies; b) if not, to
assess the relative roles of incomplete lineage sorting and
gene flow in shaping the observed patterns; and ultimately c) to understand if the genetic boundaries delimiting forms within the Podarcis species complex are welldefined. Our results evidence a striking contrast between
monophyly of mitochondrial DNA and extreme
polyphyly of nuclear genealogies. Moreover, because
equilibrium-based, classic estimates of gene flow among
forms are remarkably different from those estimated in a
divergence, non-equilibrium framework, this study highlights the confounding effect that incomplete lineage sorting may have in migration rate estimates and consequent
inference of species boundaries when recent divergence is
not taken into account.

Results
Mitochondrial DNA assignment
In order to assign individuals to a mitochondrial DNA lineage, we sequenced a portion of the ND4 gene in all analysed individuals. The mitochondrial data set included 78
sequences and was trimmed to a common fragment of
534 bp. Previously unpublished sequences have been submitted to GenBank, accession numbers EU269551–
EU269594. This data set contained 187 polymorphic

positions, of which 179 were parsimony informative.
None of these polymorphisms correspond to insertions or
deletions, which conforms to the coding nature of the
region analysed. An ML tree depicting the relationships
between the observed haplotypes is shown in Figure 1.
Because it includes less informative characters, the
depicted tree does not reflect the same well-supported
relationships that were inferred in a previous phylogenetic
study including 2425 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence
data [15] although exactly the same major phylogroups
were recovered. This tree was used to assign individuals to
a mitochondrial group. All the individuals that had a prior
morphological assignment clustered within the expected
mitochondrial lineage, with the exception of the individual BEV7337, which morphologically resembles a "Galera
type" individual (P.A. Crochet, pers. comm.) but that nevertheless clustered within the sympatric P. hispanica sensu
stricto.

towards rare alleles. Both genes failed to pass the fourgamete test of Hudson and Kaplan [24] and were inferred
to have suffered several recombination events (at least 7 in
the case of 6-Pgdint7 and at least 8 in β-fibint7). However,
when applying the more sensitive test of Bruen et al. [25]
we were not able to reject the null hypothesis of no recombination (P-values for the permutation test shown in
Table 1).

Nuclear gene variability and recombination
We studied DNA sequence variation in two nuclear
introns, 6-Pgdint7 and β-fibint7, in individuals representing all known mtDNA lineages. Alignment of the 6Pgdint7 sequences for 136 chromosomes was trimmed to
a common fragment of 503 bp. This 503 bp alignment
required 10 insertions or deletions, from 1 bp to 23 bp
long, and included a small poly-G repetitive region with
size variability. Indels were inserted to maximise base pair
identity in conserved sequenced blocks flanking the indel.
A total of 65 different alleles were detected. Alignment of
β-fibint7 was pruned to a common fragment of total
length 951 bp for 140 chromosomes; this alignment
required several insertions and deletions, including a very
large (~350 bp) insertion in all samples bearing the
"Galera" mtDNA lineage plus sample BEV7337 which was
probably responsible for the failure to amplify the complete intron in these samples using primers BF8 and BFXF.
At least 80 alleles were detected. The "Galera" insertion
showed a poly-C/poly-T motif within it, with size variability, but each allele's number of repeats could not be
resolved. Complete allele sequences have been submitted
to GenBank, accession numbers EU269595–EU269659
(6-Pgdint7) and EU269471–EU269550 (β-fibint7). Correspondence between alleles, the samples in which they
were detected and accession numbers is given in Additional File 1.

The most evident result is a complete lack of monophyly
of the mitochondrial-defined groups. Many alleles are
even shared by distinct species. Moreover, although the
outgroup P. muralis represents a relatively distinct lineage
according to both genes, the group formed by all Iberian
and North African Podarcis is not monophyletic with
respect to this species according to the β-fibint7 genealogy,
since one individual carrying P. hispanica type 3 mtDNA
exhibits an allele that falls within the clade formed by P.
muralis.

Polymorphism levels calculated from the data sets without alignment gaps are presented in Table 1. The nuclear
loci analysed in this study, despite being introns, show
polymorphism levels considerably lower than those
observed in the mitochondrial DNA fragment analysed
(e.g. π6-Pgdint7 = 0.01721; πβ-fibint7 = 0.01269; πND4 =
0.10738). Interestingly, both nuclear genes show significantly negative values of Tajima's D, indicating a skew

Nuclear gene genealogies
The haplotype networks inferred for both nuclear genes
are shown in Figure 2. These networks were built after
removing all but the first base of each indel (see Methods), which resulted in 100 variable characters and 61
alleles in 6-Pgdint7 and 113 characters and 72 alleles in βfibint7. The correspondence between alleles represented in
the haplotype networks and the complete alleles that have
been deposited in GenBank is given in Additional File 1.

Because this lack of monophyly could result from an
insufficiency of data to recover correct relationships, we
tested alternative hypotheses based on mitochondrial
DNA phylogenetic relationships using a ShimodairaHasegawa test [26]. Using datasets without removing
indels (but excluding the poly-C/poly-T region in
"Galera" samples), we enforced two distinct topological
constraints for each gene: i) monophyly of all species; ii)
monophyly of the three major groups recovered for Iberian and North African Podarcis by Pinho et al. [15] (group
1: P. bocagei, P. carbonelli, P. hispanica type 1A and 1B, P.
hispanica type 2; group 2: P. hispanica sensu stricto, P.
vaucheri, P. hispanica Tunisia and P. hispanica Jebel Sirwah;
group 3: P. hispanica type 3 and P. hispanica Galera). In
both of these analyses P. muralis was also included and
constrained to monophyly. Because a few cases of allele
proximity could at a first glance be interpreted as suggestions of recent gene flow, we also conducted the same
analyses excluding these alleles (BEV7337A and
BEV7337B in 6-Pgdint7; BEV7337A, BEV7337B, Get1A
and Get1B in β-fibint7). All these tests suggest that
enforced topologies are significantly less likely than the
ones observed (p < 0.01), with the exception of the division into three groups in β-fibint7 excluding the putative
introgressed alleles.

Genetic differentiation and equilibrium gene flow
estimates between groups
We evaluated overall genetic differentiation among
mtDNA-defined species by computing FST for the two data
sets. These results are shown in Table 1. Values obtained
for the mitochondrial DNA are also shown for comparison (noting, however, that "species" are, by definition,
monophyletic with respect to the mtDNA, leading to necessarily high levels of differentiation). Despite the lack of
monophyly, differentiation between the 12 species
accounts for around 61% of genetic variation in 6-Pgdint7
and 51% in β-fibint7; these values fall to around 46% and
40%, respectively, when the outgroup P. muralis is
excluded from the analyses.

Examination of pairwise Nm values in more detail (Table
2) reveals distinct trends across species pairs; in general
Nm values based on nuclear genes are different from 0,
ranging from 0.01 (between P. muralis and both P. bocagei
and P. hispanica Tunisian type) to 1.76 (between P. hispanica types 1A and 1B). Besides this last case, other species pairs exhibit Nm values higher than 1, suggesting
large levels of gene flow under this model: P. vaucheri vs.
P. hispanica types 1A and 1B, P. hispanica type 1B vs. P. hispanica type 2 and P. hispanica sensu stricto vs. P. hispanica
type 3.

Application of the isolation with migration model to
Iberian and North African Podarcis
Independent runs using IM converged on approximate
marginal posterior probability distributions. We were
able to obtain reliable estimates for θ1, θ2 and migration
rates across most of the tested pairs; however, some 90%
highest posterior density (HPD) intervals could not be
reliably assessed either for θ or migration. The posterior
probability distributions for the ancestral population
sizes were generally flat or had a maximum at the lowest
bin; our data do not therefore seem to incorporate enough
information for these estimates to be reliable. Time since
divergence scaled by the mutation rate (t) was also not
recovered with confidence for a few species pairs because
the distributions were flat (albeit non-zero), particularly
in the comparisons involving species that are reciprocally
monophyletic for both genes. Most of the curves, however, were well resolved or presented a clear peak although
their tails did not reach 0; in these cases we report a value
for the HPD, without obtaining a reliable 90% HPD interval.

In order to convert IM estimates into biologically meaningful values (effective population sizes, divergence times
in years or migration rates) one needs an estimate of

mutation rate. For the two genes included in the analyses,
we have no information regarding the mutation rate and
no straightforward way of calibrating a molecular clock.
We therefore focused on estimates that do not require the
assumption of a particular evolutionary rate: the population migration rate (2Nm) and estimates of relative divergence times (t = tµ) between species pairs. These results
are given in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. In these tables,
results involving P. hispanica sensu stricto and P. hispanica
type 3 were estimated excluding alleles presumably introgressed from P. hispanica Galera type and P. muralis,
respectively (obviously, the comparisons with the species
from which the alleles were introgressed were performed
on the complete data sets). Confirmation that these alleles
and not others were introgressed from the other species
was obtained when runs excluding them yielded migration rates of 0, in contrast to the levels estimated when
they were present. In other cases of introgression, alleles
that were obviously introgressed could not be a priori pinpointed with confidence.
Population migration rates obtained using this method
are strikingly different from those calculated using classic
estimators of gene flow. In fact, 2Nm values between species pairs are in general very low, close to zero. Most of

*: migration rate significantly different from 0 (P < 0.05).
‡, +: the actual interval could not be reliably estimated because the likelihood surfaces for θ (‡) or m (+) were relatively flat.

these values are at the lower limit of resolution because
the obtained migration parameter estimates (m1 and m2)
correspond to the first bin of the surveyed parameter
space. However, non-zero estimates of gene flow were
obtained between eight species pairs. The highest population migration rates were documented from P. bocagei into
P. hispanica type 1A. A relatively high (2Nm > 1) migration
rate was also detected from P. hispanica "Galera" type to P.
hispanica sensu stricto and from the latter to P. vaucheri;
lower but still non-zero rates were also observed from P.
hispanica type 1B into P. carbonelli, from P. hispanica sensu
stricto to P. hispanica type 1B, from P. hispanica type 3 into
P. vaucheri, from P. hispanica Tunisian type to Jebel Sirwah
type, and from P. muralis to P. hispanica type 3. Curiously,

all these cases involve instances of asymmetrical gene
flow.
In preliminary analyses, very high levels were also suspected to occur from P. hispanica sensu stricto into P. hispanica type 3, although estimates were not completely
reliable because migration curves from both runs showed
two peaks: one, corresponding to the maximum likelihood estimate, reflecting high levels of migration, and a
smaller peak close to zero. That is, the program could not
confidently choose between the hypotheses of high or
zero gene flow. To solve this situation, we performed a
second set of runs with a narrower prior distribution for
divergence time (based on the clear peak obtained in the

parameters, suggesting virtually zero gene flow between
the two forms.

of mtDNA, allozymes and both the nuclear genealogies,
which is a close relationshp between P. hispanica from
Tunisia and Jebel Sirwah.

Of these eight cases of non-zero migration rates, only
three were found to be significantly different from zero (P
< 0.05) according to a likelihood ratio test: from P. bocagei
into P. hispanica type 1A, from P. hispanica "Galera" type
into P. hispanica sensu stricto and from the latter to P.
vaucheri.

This situation of polyphyly in nuclear genealogies relative
to mitochondrial data is not uncommon (see for example
[27-29], amongst many others, for similar results). At first
glance, this discordance could suggest that mitochondrial
DNA-defined species of Iberian and North African Podarcis do not correspond to true evolutionary entities and
that this differentiation is the result of stochastic or deterministic effects acting only on the mitochondrial genome.
In fact, it has been demonstrated that quite deep phylogeographic breaks in single gene genealogies may appear in
the absence of historical barriers to gene flow simply
because of stochastic lineage sorting [30,31]. It has also
been shown that mitochondrial DNA divergence may not
be necessarily corroborated by nuclear divergence because
of selection acting on mitochondrial DNA [32]. However,
there is a remarkable degree of concordance between the
units defined based on mitochondrial DNA [12-15] and
those observed by morphological analyses [19-21] and
multilocus nuclear data [16-18]. It is therefore unlikely

Estimates of relative divergence times range from 1.64
between P. hispanica sensu stricto and P. hispanica type 3,
to 3.83 between P. carbonelli and P. hispanica type 2.

Discussion
Lack of population structure in nuclear genealogies
The most striking result emerging from this study is a
complete lack of monophyly at nuclear genes in Iberian
and North African species of Podarcis. Both nuclear genealogies fail to detect obvious population structure that
relates to that observed in mitochondrial DNA. In fact,
there is a single common pattern emerging from the study

Page 9 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:63

that subdivision within Iberian and North African Podarcis
is nonexistent. Why, then, do nuclear genealogies apparently not support the partitions observed in mtDNA and,
in particular, in allozyme data?
A simple explanation could be a low level of diversity and
consequently of resolution in estimates of relationships.
However, monophyly of Podarcis mtDNA lineages has
been observed even in mitochondrial genes evolving at a
very slow rate (such as the control region data set analysed
by Pinho et al. [15], for which ~14.5% of the positions are
variable (compared to ~22% in 6-Pgdint7 and ~19.7% in
β-fibint7); also, if a lack of resolution was responsible for
the polyphyly of mtDNA groups, then we would expect
that no significant differences would be observed in tree
likelihoods with and without enforced species' monophyly. Tests involving topological constraints, however,
demonstrated that this is not the case.
Distinguishing between incomplete lineage sorting of
ancestral polymorphism and gene flow
Given that lack of informative variation is not a satisfactory explanation for the discrepant results observed
between mtDNA and nuclear genealogies, we are left with
two possible scenarios, which are not mutually exclusive:
a) incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism
and b) gene flow, particularly male-biased.

In order to investigate whether, despite their polyphyly,
species of wall lizards are differentiated with respect to
nuclear genealogies, it becomes critical to discriminate
between the influences of these two scenarios in shaping
the patterns of allele sharing. In order to do so, we estimated levels of gene flow based on nuclear genealogies.
Our data strongly suggest that, although gene flow may be
important between some species pairs, the polyphyletic
pattern mostly derives from the incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism. This is a likely scenario
because nuclear genes take on average four-times as much
time to reach monophyly than mitochondrial DNA does
[33]. Therefore, when differentiation is recent, there is a
distinct possibility that mitochondrial lineages may not
be monophyletic with respect to nuclear genealogies.
Three major lines of evidence support our conclusion of a
greater effect of incomplete lineage sorting:
Comparison with allozyme variation
If gene flow was the main cause for the non-monophyly
of species when considering nuclear gene variation, then
allozyme data would also fail to observe any differentiation. This is certainly not the case in Iberian and North
African Podarcis. A recent study documented not only that
species are in general highly differentiated and monophyletic when considering a population tree, but also that
most species can be individualized as discrete clusters by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/63

taking into account individual multilocus genotypes [18].
There are nevertheless exceptions with this regard, since
some species pairs could not be distinguished, but even if
these exceptions resulted solely from introgression, the
correspondent pattern in nuclear genealogies would be
the sharing of alleles between these particular hybridizing
forms and not others, which is not verified.
Relationships between allele age and transpecificity
A second line of evidence suggesting a major role for
incomplete lineage sorting relies on the simple observation of patterns of allele relationships, particularly on the
β-fibint7 data set. If gene flow was the main cause for the
observed species polyphyly, we would expect that both
ancestral (alleles that have a central position in the haplotype network) and derived alleles were transpecific or
closely related to alleles found in other species. However,
we do not detect this pattern; instead, we find that putatively older alleles are more widespread among species
than alleles placed as tips, which are likely to have arisen
after the species were separated. In order to visualize this
trend, we plotted for the β-fibint7 data set the number of
mutations separating a given haplotype from haplotype
BR25, placed in the centre of the network, against the
number of mutations separating that particular haplotype
from the nearest haplotype found in another species (Fig.
3). The ancestral nature of haplotype BR25 was confirmed
using an alternative method of haplotype network construction [34], which pinpoints the haplotype that is most
probably the ancestral within a network. Although Figure
3 is a very rough representation, it clearly illustrates the
relationship between allele "ancestrality" and trans-species proximity. Exceptions to this "rule" therefore constitute the most obvious cases of gene flow, as documented
by the outlier position of the haplotypes BR62 and BR66
(putatively introgressed from P. hispanica Galera type into
P. hispanica sensu stricto). The results are not as clear for
6-Pgdint7, both because a central haplotype cannot be
pinpointed with confidence and because this gene shows
more segregation between species groups. Nevertheless,
there is still a positive correlation between both measures
(results not shown).
Non-equilibrium estimates of gene flow between species
Inferences based on coalescent simulations in a divergence with gene flow framework [11] suggest low levels of
gene flow among forms, since we estimated virtually zero
levels of historical gene flow between all but eight species
pairs, of which only three cases were actually found to be
significantly different from zero, Moreover, only one of
these corresponds to important levels of gene flow since
divergence.

Taken together, these results illustrate that the
polyphyletic pattern probably arises as a consequence of

the incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphism, and that, even though they are non-monophyletic,
Iberian and North African wall lizard species are indeed
overall differentiated with respect to nuclear genealogies.
Differences between equilibrium and non-equilibrium
estimates of migration rates
This study highlights how different estimates of gene flow
provide different pictures of the evolutionary dynamics of
a species group. On one hand, according to FST-based estimates of Nm, most species pairs have exchanged genes
since they began to diverge; indeed, only a few comparisons suggest the absence of gene flow (Table 2). Based on
these estimates, we would be led to think that gene flow is
a strong evolutionary force shaping genetic variability
between species of Podarcis. On the other hand, gene flow
estimates based on an isolation with migration model
revealed only a few cases of clear genetic exchange
between species. These results need to be interpreted with
caution because the isolation with migration model that
was fitted to our data does not directly apply to a multispecies scenario. However, as discussed above, these
results are inline with inferences based on allozyme data
and with the patterns of allele sharing or proximity, sug-

gesting that gene flow, although existent, has probably
had a minor role in shaping these lizards' evolution.
These differences between both classes of estimators are
not completely unexpected. Wright's [7] island model of
migration, on which the relationship between FST and Nm
is based, is indeed subject to numerous assumptions, of
which several (if not all) are hardly met in most biological
systems. One assumption of particular relevance to this
study is that of equilibrium between migration and drift,
which is violated in populations that have recently
become completely isolated. In such cases low FST does
not necessarily translate into high levels of gene flow. This
is a particular concern when estimating gene flow between
species rather than populations, since in these cases effective population size are typically high and migration rates
low, which implies that equilibrium conditions will take
a very long time to be reached [9].
The pitfalls of gene flow estimates based on FST have been
widely debated in the literature [8,9,35]. However, only a
few studies have actually demonstrated the influence of
these limitations in the inference of migration rates in
non-equilibrium conditions [36,37]. The present study

Page 11 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:63

therefore provides an additional warning against the misuse of equilibrium-based measures of gene flow on
recently-diverged evolutionary groups.
Noteworthy, this warning is valid not only for FST-based
estimates but for any method that assumes equilibrium
migration, even if other problems inherent to FST are minimized [38].
Evidence for historical gene flow among Podarcis species
Although our results argue in favour of a major role for
incomplete lineage sorting in shaping the observed
polyphyletic patterns in nuclear gene genealogies, we
identified a few species pairs that have probably been
exchanging genes.

Very high levels of admixture were detected from P.
bocagei to P. hispanica type 1A. Albeit lower, still significant levels were detected from P. hispanica "Galera" type to
P. hispanica sensu stricto and from P. hispanica sensu
stricto into P. vaucheri. Excluding the latter, these cases do
not constitute a surprise since suggestions of hybridization and introgression between these species pairs have
been described before. Concerning P. bocagei and P. hispanica type 1A, these were based on individual multilocus
genotype clustering [18] and the observation of interspecific matings in nature (R. Ribeiro and M. A. Carretero,
pers. comm.). Similarly, gene flow between P. hispanica
"Galera" type and P. hispanica sensu stricto had also been
reported based on discordance between mitochondrial
and morphological variation, with some additional evidence from nuclear data [23].
Our results suggest that gene flow seems to have been
more frequent between forms that are sympatric at least in
part of their distribution (P. bocagei/P. hispanica type 1A;
P. hispanica "Galera"/P. hispanica sensu stricto), which is
not totally unexpected. However, we also find strong support for gene flow events between P. vaucheri and P. hispanica sensu stricto. These two species still have poorly
studied distribution limits, so it is yet unknown if they
establish contact zones or if they are completely allopatric. Nevertheless, in theory present contact should not be
a prerequisite for gene exchange; given that species have
most likely suffered repeated pulses of range expansions
and contractions due to geological or climatic events,
presently allopatric pairs of species may have met at some
point in their past and then hybridized.
Besides spatial considerations, other results regarding
introgression between species are noteworthy. First, in the
case of P. bocagei and P. hispanica type 1A, the inferred levels of admixture were surprisingly high, above the values
considered as thresholds for the maintenance of genetic
differentiation [7]. However, the two species are sympatric

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/63

and nevertheless maintain their morphological identifiability. It has also been shown that males discriminate conspecific from heterospecific females based on chemical
stimuli, which suggests at least some degree of assortative
mating [39]. Furthermore, the two species correspond to
clearly distinct genetic clusters as shown by almost perfect
assignment using individual allozyme multilocus genotype clustering approaches [18]. It therefore seems that
the present estimates of gene flow between these two species are slightly inflated; this unexpected outcome could
result from our limited sampling and therefore needs further clarification.
Second, we should discuss in more detail the situation of
P. hispanica sensu stricto. It has been suggested that the
divergent mitochondrial clade that we refer to as P. hispanica sensu stricto is a "ghost" lineage; in other words,
this divergent mtDNA clade would be an extant signature
of a nowadays extinct species whose mtDNA survived in
the nuclear background of other species inhabiting its
former area of distribution (namely P. hispanica Galera
type and P. hispanica type 3) [23]. Similar scenarios of
mtDNA persistence through interspecific capture and
nuclear dilution have in fact been shown to occur in several other cases [40,41], so this hypothesis would not be
completely farfetched. However, our results do not agree
with this scenario. On one hand, we find that significant
amounts of gene flow have indeed occurred between the
mtDNA-defined P. hispanica sensu stricto and P. hispanica
Galera type. However, these levels do not seem to have
been large enough for the two forms to stand out as undifferentiated. The same situation is suggested by analyses of
allozyme variation, which report high levels of differentiation and a complete lack of gene flow between nearby
interspecific populations of these two taxa [18]. On the
other hand, with respect to P. hispanica type 3, although
this was unclear in preliminary runs, IM returned very low
population migration rates in both directions. This therefore contrasts with analyses of allozyme data, in which
these two forms were found to be non-diagnosable [18].
Because data with respect to the nuclear differentiation of
mitochondrial DNA lineages from eastern Iberian Peninsula thus remains controversial, this subject clearly needs
further assessment.
Third, although migration from P. muralis to P. hispanica
type 3 was found to be non significant according to the
test proposed by Nielsen and Wakeley [10], there is strong
evidence suggesting that gene flow may have occurred
between these two species. In fact, an allele separated by a
single mutation from those typical of P. muralis alleles,
which in turn are distinct by several mutations from the
ingroup, was detected in an individual with P. hispanica
type 3 mtDNA. For this to correspond to an allele shared
by incomplete lineage sorting, it would imply that a single

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:63

mutation had occurred in either of the lineages since the
divergence of these two species (over 10 million years ago
[42]), which is unlikely. We therefore believe this to be a
false negative for the occurrence of migration, which the
conservative significance test is prone to produce [10].
Although the confirmation of this result requires further
investigation, this may imply that species of Podarcis take
a long time of divergence to acquire complete reproductive isolation.
Nevertheless, this study should not be taken as a definitive
assessment of gene flow among Podarcis species. First,
because other false negatives may exist among the species
pairs in which IM identified non-trivial migration rates.
Second, and most importantly, because our limited sample size does not allow pinpointing with complete certainty which species have exchanged genes and which
have not. We may infer from this work that historical gene
flow among Iberian and North African Podarcis has been
low, yet existent; however, a detailed analysis of the patterns of genetic exchange across species will require the
detection and thorough characterization of contact zones.
Implications regarding the evolutionary patterns of Iberian
and North African Podarcis
A primary observation that can be drawn from this work
is that single nuclear genealogies do not reflect a branching pattern related to putative isolation in allopatry that
led to the formation of the observed species, mainly
because of shared ancestral polymorphism. Hudson and
Coyne [43] estimated that, assuming that mutation and
drift are the only evolutionary forces operating, reciprocal
monophyly should be attained at ~95% of nuclear loci 9N
to 12N generations after the population split. It is noteworthy that the minimum separation time between the
various lineages has been estimated to be around 5 million years (i.e ~2 million generations), based on mtDNA
phylogenetic analyses. Assuming that these estimates are
correct, the fact that mtDNA lineages are not reciprocally
monophyletic at the nuclear level suggest that the majority, if not all, of extant Iberian and North African Podarcis
lineages were able to maintain a relatively high historical
effective population size throughout their presumably
eventful history, which allowed sorting of mtDNA lineages to monophyly without the corresponding pattern in
nuclear genes. We hypothesise that larger effective population sizes in Podarcis might explain the contrasting patterns of subdivision observed at nuclear loci between wall
lizards and, for example, the Iberian newt Lissotriton
boscai. This species complex is characterized by similarly
old or even younger mtDNA splits [44], but in this case
the various groups have reached almost complete reciprocal monophyly at the β-fibint7 locus [45].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/63

Pinho et al. [18] suggested that contrasting evolutionary
scenarios inferred for the evolution of the genus on the
basis of mitochondrial vs. nuclear markers (i.e. step-bystep speciation vs. radiation) could be accommodated
taking into account the different effective population sizes
that characterize both classes of markers. Indeed, speciation may have occurred at a rate fast enough so that
nuclear gene genealogies are uninformative regarding species relationships but mitochondrial genealogies are not.
In fact, although multi-species clades in Pinho et al.'s [15]
mitochondrial phylogenetic assessment of relationships
are supported by high bootstrap values, internal branches
are short, which is consistent with a fast speciation rate.
Accordingly, our estimates of divergence time between
mtDNA-defined lineages on the basis of nuclear markers
do not correlate to mitochondrial DNA branching patterns; for example, the largest time since divergence was
inferred for the mitochondrial sister pair P. carbonelli/P.
hispanica type 2.
An intriguing characteristic of both nuclear gene genealogies isthe detection of a skew towards rare alleles, as suggested by largely negative and significant Tajima's D.
Although such a multilocus pattern can usually be interpreted as a signature of demographic growth, it has been
shown that the same patterns may also arise as a consequence of fine-scale population structure, which is translated as a bias into sampling schemes such as ours, in
which few individuals from multiple populations are analysed [46].
A gradual view of speciation
With the analyses of nuclear genealogies in Podarcis wall
lizards from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, we
have provided compelling evidence for general historical
reproductive isolation among distinct lineages despite
their non reciprocal monophyly. These results are therefore in accordance with emergent morphological data and
previous reports of mitochondrial and nuclear gene variation suggesting that these forms may correspond to different, almost completely reproductively isolated species.
We have also provided evidence for the existence of limited to important levels of gene flow among a few species
pairs, also in accordance with previously published data.
Although the effect that such admixture processes may
have in species differentiation remains to be completely
acknowledged, preliminary work on the contact zone
between P. bocagei and P. carbonelli suggests spatiallyrestricted genetic exchange and a bimodal hybrid zone
concordant with the existence of strong barriers to gene
flow [47].

The lack of reciprocal monophyly and the permeability to
gene flow implies that wall lizard lineages will fail to be
considered good species in the light of most species con-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:63

cepts. Nevertheless, it appears that most forms remain differentiated despite the merging influence of gene flow.
Our results in Podarcis wall lizards therefore add to recent
evidence stemming from the study of other incipient species groups (such as heliconiine butterflies [48] for example) illustrating that the acquisition of reproductive
isolation is a gradual process and contributing to the
establishment of a "species with fuzzy borders" paradigm.
Podarcis wall lizards in the Iberian Peninsula and North
Africa present a wide variety of distribution patterns,
including sympatric, parapatric and allopatric forms and
will therefore constitute an excellent model for testing
hypotheses related to the origin and maintenance of
reproductive isolation in closely related species.

Conclusion
Along with a growing body of work focusing on recent
species complexes, this study supports a progressive view
of speciation, according to which species may persist as
differentiated despite remaining porous to genetic
exchange and having poorly-defined genetic boundaries
for a very long period of time after divergence. Such recent
species complexes often have not yet achieved equilibrium between migration and drift, a condition which will
strongly influence the outcome of studies aiming at quantifying gene flow if recent divergence is not taken into
account.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction
Currently, 11 evolutionary units have been identified
using mitochondrial DNA within the Iberian Peninsula
and North Africa clade of Podarcis. The species used here
as an outgroup, P. muralis, is phylogenetically distinct
from the other forms [42,49] and has a wide distribution
range throughout Europe, including Northern Iberian
Peninsula. Our sampling scheme was designed to incorporate a minimum of five individuals per species, morphotype or mtDNA lineage (Table 5). The majority of
individuals were preliminarily identified and assigned to
an evolutionary group using morphological criteria.
Because some mtDNA lineages have not been studied in
detail morphologically and others that have are indistinguishable, our final assignment was based on mitochondrial DNA sequencing (see below). We will, from here on,
refer to the defined groups as "species" for a matter of simplicity. It should be noted, however, that the specific status of some of these groups still remains to be evaluated.
The sampling scheme was as representative of the species
distributions as possible. In total, 78 individuals were
analysed. The geographical locations of the samples, as
well as a preliminary distribution map of mitochondrial
lineages are shown in Figure 1. Samples consisted of a
small tail clip, obtained taking advantage of the lizard's

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/63

natural tail autotomy capacity. All lizards were released
after sample collection. Samples were stored in ethanol or
frozen at -80°C prior to DNA extraction, which was
accomplished following standard protocols [50]. All
mitochondrial DNA sequences from P. bocagei, P. carbonelli and P. vaucheri individuals, as well as several individuals from other species (identified in Table 5) were
generated for previous studies on mitochondrial variation
[15,51].
DNA amplification, sequencing and haplotype
determination
We generated sequences from two nuclear genes: β-fibrinogen intron 7 (β-fibint7) and 6-phosphogluconic acid
dehydrogenase intron 7 (6-Pgdint7). To establish a correct
assignment of all individuals to a mitochondrial DNA lineage, we further sequenced a mitochondrial fragment
comprising the 3' end of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene and adjacent tRNAs (from here on referred to as
ND4). A list of the primers that were developed for amplification of the three studied genes is given in Table 6.

Amplification and sequencing of the ND4 gene was
accomplished using primers ND4 and Leu [52] and followed the conditions described by Pinho et al. [15]. In this
work the authors reported the existence of a nuclear pseudogene of ND4 in the P. hispanica morphotype from the
population of Galera that was amplified instead of the
mitochondrial fragment (see [15] for details). To avoid
the amplification of this nuclear copy we developed primers targeting only the mitochondrial sequence observed in
this morphotype (primers GalND4F and GalND4R,
described in Table 6). Sequences obtained through the use
of these primers were apparently single-copy and similar
to the mitochondrial sequence inferred by Pinho et al.
[15].
At a preliminary stage, amplification of the β-fibint7 gene
was accomplished using primers FIB-B17U and FIB-B17L
[53] under the conditions described by Godinho et al.
[54], but lowering the annealing temperature to 50°C.
However, because amplification and sequencing success
was low with these primers, we tried several other combinations of primers, both already published and newly
designed for this study. The definitive amplification and
sequencing of this gene was accomplished using primer
BFXF described in Sequeira et al. [55], as well as a new
primer (BF8) designed considering the alignment of
sequences from Podarcis with those from several Lacerta
species [54]. Amplification was carried out in 20 µL volumes, containing 2 µL 10× reaction buffer (Ecogen), 2
mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM each dNTP, 0.2 µM each primer, 1
unit of Ecotaq DNA polymerase (Ecogen) and approximately 100 ng of genomic DNA. Amplification conditions
consisted of a pre-denaturing step of 3 min at 92°C fol-

lowed by 40 cycles of a denaturing step of 30 s at 92°C,
annealing at 53°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 90
s. The final extension was accomplished at 72°C for 5
min. This protocol failed to amplify some of the samples,
including all P. hispanica with the Galera mtDNA type. We
therefore designed an internal primer, BfibR, which was
used together with primer BF8 under the same conditions
described above.
The locus 6-Pgdint7 was chosen for this work based on
very high polymorphism levels observed for the studied
lizards in the allozyme encoded by the 6-Pgd gene [1618]. We began by aligning mRNA sequences for several
organisms (Homo sapiens, accession number BC000368,
Mus musculus, accession number BC011329, Danio rerio,
accession number AY391449 and Lasaea australis, accession number AF345495). Highly conserved regions situated on human exons 7 and 8 were targeted to design
multiple degenerate primers for exon-primed, introncrossing (EPIC) PCR [56]. Several combinations of these
were tried on a limited number of Podarcis samples under
gradients of annealing temperatures and MgCl2 concen-

trations. The beginning, supposedly exonic portions of
the amplified fragments revealed a high degree of homology with the mRNA sequences used to construct the initial
alignment, suggesting that the sequenced genomic portion was indeed intron 7 of the 6-Pgd gene. New primers,
named PgdP7F and PgdP8R, specific for Podarcis, were
then designed in the exons and allowed successful amplification of this gene region. Optimal amplification was
achieved using the same conditions described above for βfibint7, with the exception that some samples required
annealing temperatures of 60°C. An internal reverse
primer, PGD500, was also designed for sequencing purposes.
The PCR products were enzymatically purified and
sequenced using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle
sequencing protocol in an ABI Prism 310 automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the same primers
used for amplification.
We used two approaches to resolve the haplotype phase of
nuclear DNA sequences. First, for sequences that were het-

erozygous for insertions or deletions, we used the method
described by Flot et al. [57]. Second, we used the Bayesian
algorithm implemented in the PHASE software [58],
using known phases of haplotypes determined by the previous method. Several individuals were sequenced for
which the haplotype phase could not be completely determined; these individuals were not included in subsequent
analyses and for simplicity are not represented in Table 5
and Figure 1. Sequences were aligned manually using
BIOEDIT v. 7.0.5.2 [59]. For nuclear genes, each allele was
coded with the name of the individual carrying it following by the letters A or B.
Analytical methods
Mitochondrial DNA phylogeny
We used an alignment of 536 bp of the ND4 gene to carry
out phylogenetic analyses under a maximum likelihood
approach using GARLI version 0.95 [60,61]. This software
allows simultaneous estimates of tree topology, branch
lengths and model parameters under the general-timereversible model of sequence evolution.
Nuclear gene genealogies
To illustrate relationships between haplotypes, a medianjoining network [62] was built using NETWORK [63]. We
preferred this method of representing genealogies rather
than phylogenetic trees because the levels of polymorphism observed at both nuclear genes were much lower
than those observed in mitochondrial DNA. For these situations, haplotype networks constitute a better way of
representing relationships [64]. Because multiple-base
insertions or deletions are likely to have resulted from a
single evolutionary step, we pruned the data in order to
leave only the first base of the indel. We chose this
approach rather than completely removing indels because
this would significantly reduce the number of polymorphic sites used to build the network and disregard much
of the information contained in the data sets. Nevertheless, some segregating positions located within areas of
indels were removed by this pruning method.

In order to test alternative hypotheses (see Results) relative to the topology of the nuclear gene genealogies, we
also searched for ML trees that better represented the phylogeny of the observed haplotypes using GARLI. Under
the model of sequence evolution derived from these analyses, we performed new ML searches enforcing a particular topology using PAUP* 4.0b10 [65] and compared the
resulting trees' likelihoods with those obtained from
unconstrained analyses using Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests
[26] under the RELL approximation with 1000 bootstrap
replicates. This step was conducted using the full data sets
(i.e. without removing indels from the alignment).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/63

DNA sequence polymorphism, population subdivision and
recombination
All the following analyses were performed using reduced
data sets from which all indels were eliminated. We calculated summary diversity statistics (number of haplotypes,
number of segregating sites, nucleotide diversity, π, and
the population mutation parameter θ [66] for the three
data sets and separately for each partition. We also computed Tajima's D [67] to test for non-neutral evolution of
the analysed data-sets. We also computed values of Hudson et al.'s [68]FST between all species pairs. These analyses
were conducted in DNASP [69]. To evaluate the possibility of recombination in the nuclear genes, we computed
Hudson and Kaplan's [24] Rm statistic (representing the
minimum number of recombination events) using
DNASP. Because this statistic is likely to be highly affected
by homoplasy, we also used the software PHIPACK [70]
to test for recombination using the pairwise homoplasy
index (Φw statistic) of Bruen et al. [25]. This statistic is a
powerful detector of recombination and has been shown
by simulation studies to be less sensitive to the effects of
mutation rate correlation than other available statistics,
which are prone to falsely infer recombination when levels of recurrent mutation are high [25]. PHIPACK provides P-values for the acceptance of the null hypothesis of
no recombination. We used the two available options to
estimate such P-values: an analytical approach and a permutation test (1000 permutations).
Estimation of migration rates between species
We used two different approaches to assess levels of gene
flow between forms. First, Nm values were inferred from
FST according to Wright's [7] island model of population
structure using the expression FST ≈ (1+2Nm) for mitochondrial DNA and FST ≈ 1/(1+4Nm) for nuclear autosomal loci. Traditional, FST-based methods of estimating
Nm make many unrealistic assumptions, among which is
the equilibrium between drift and migration. Species that
have recently diverged often share much of their genetic
variation not only due to gene flow but also because of
retention of ancestral polymorphism. In these cases,
obtaining realistic estimates of migration between populations is challenging. Nielsen and Wakeley [10] developed a model which takes into account population
divergence and gene flow in the same framework, thus
being appropriate to disentangle between the relative
effects of isolation and migration in shaping the patterns
of variation among diverging species. This model was
extended to incorporate multilocus data by Hey and
Nielsen [11], as implemented in the IM computer program, which works under a two-population model and
uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate
six parameters scaled by the neutral mutation rate: effective population sizes for both extant populations and
their ancestor, time since divergence and migration rates

on both directions. This model was developed for a simple two-population scenario and therefore does not
directly apply to the complexity inherent to divergence
within Iberian and North African Podarcis, in which eleven
mitochondrial DNA lineages have been described. Nevertheless, because no applications of this model have been
developed to deal with more than two populations, we
performed pairwise analyses to assess historical migration
rates between all species pairs. We included the outgroup,
P. muralis, in these analyses, because preliminary inspection of sequence data for one of the studied gene regions
suggested that introgression with the ingroup could have
occurred (see Results). Several analyses involving more
than two species have been successfully performed using
IM or similar methods [29,36,71-73]. It should be kept in
mind, however, that using a two population model influence from other populations might have an unpredictable
effect on our estimates. In order to minimize such effect,
we performed a second set of runs for comparisons
involving P. hispanica sensu stricto and P. hispanica type 3,
excluding alleles that were apparently introgressed from
other species (see Results).
Since IM cannot accommodate gaps in DNA sequence
data, we pruned all gaps and missing data from the data
sets. An assumption made by IM is no recombination;
because we had no evidence for recombination in our
data sets using Bruen et al. 's [25] method (see Results), we
used the complete data sets in the analyses. We used the
HKY [74] model in all analyses. After several experimental
runs to assess appropriate parameter settings and ensure
proper mixing, IM was run for each two-species data set
for 20 million steps along the Markov Chain after 1 million steps of burn-in (using the ramped heating scheme,
option -bh), with 5 Metropolis-coupled chains with linear
heating. For each data set, a second, smaller run with 10
million steps using the same options and a different random seed was used to confirm convergence of parameter
estimates.
To investigate whether estimates of migration rates were
significantly different from zero, we compared the value
of the likelihood for zero migration with the maximum
likelihood for this parameter, by calculating the log-likelihood ratio between the two. The distribution of the loglikelihood test statistic (minus two times the log-likelihood ratio) can be approximated taking into account the
distribution of a random variable which takes the value 0
with probability 0.5 and takes on a value from a χ2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom with 0.5 probability [10].
