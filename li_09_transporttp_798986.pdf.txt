Abstract
Background: Membrane transporters play crucial roles in living cells. Experimental characterization of transporters is costly and time-consuming. Current computational methods for
transporter characterization still require extensive curation efforts, especially for eukaryotic
organisms. We developed a novel genome-scale transporter prediction and characterization
system called TransportTP that combined homology-based and machine learning methods in a twophase classification approach. First, traditional homology methods were employed to predict novel
transporters based on sequence similarity to known classified proteins in the Transporter
Classification Database (TCDB). Second, machine learning methods were used to integrate a
variety of features to refine the initial predictions. A set of rules based on transporter features was
developed by machine learning using well-curated proteomes as guides.
Results: In a cross-validation using the yeast proteome for training and the proteomes of ten
other organisms for testing, TransportTP achieved an equivalent recall and precision of 81.8%,
based on TransportDB, a manually annotated transporter database. In an independent test using the
Arabidopsis proteome for training and four recently sequenced plant proteomes for testing, it
achieved a recall of 74.6% and a precision of 73.4%, according to our manual curation.
Conclusions: TransportTP is the most effective tool for eukaryotic transporter characterization
up to date.

Background
Membrane transporter proteins, or simply transporters,
play crucial roles in living cells, such as importing
essential nutrients and exporting toxic cellular metabolites, mediating signal transduction, and maintaining
ionic and osmotic homeostasis.
A handful of in-vitro or in-vivo experimental methods
have been developed and applied to study transporter

mechanisms, such as the patch-clamp techniques for
analyzing ion channels [1] and heterologous expression
and mutant complementation approaches, which are
often coupled with the use of isotopically-labeled
substrates [2,3]. These methods are costly and timeconsuming, both of which limit their applications in
identifying transporters on a large scale. Therefore,
computational methods are desired for selecting and
sorting potential targets on a genome scale prior to

laboratory experiments. Homology searches against
experimentally-determined transporters is heretofore
the most common approach in inferring novel transporters, as exemplified by BLAST searches [4] against the
Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) [5,6].
Employing this approach, a putative transporter database named TransportDB was constructed for hundreds
of completely sequenced genomes [7,8]. The wide
adoption of TCDB for transporter annotation is due to
its unique characteristics. It contains comprehensive
information on experimentally-characterized transporters. These transporters are organized within a simple
tree structure based on both function and homology,
which contains over 550 transporter families. The
transporter families possess a distinct functional-phylogenetic property, i.e. the members in a transporter family
are not only homologous but also share similar
transporter mechanisms. Other classification systems
such as Pfam [9] and Gene Ontology [10] do not have
this property. In the Pfam system, a specific domain may
be contained within proteins of different functions. In
the Gene Ontology system, a transporter may logically
belong to multiple transporter terms or functions due to
the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) adopted to represent
relationships among protein functions.
Homology methods may reveal new putative transporters, but they can also generate many false positive
assignments, due to systematic errors arising from
homology inference, since nontrivial functional variations may be induced during gene duplication or
domain shuffling [11,12]. For example, paralogs often
exhibit distinct functions [13]. As a result, more
complicated modeling of transporter families have
been proposed, including profile based methods like
HMMER [9] and PST [14], and machine learning
methods like SVMProt [15]. Profile based methods rely
heavily on regions of local conservation among family
members. However, the level of conservation within
many transporter families, such as potassium channels,
may be very low [16,17], which limits the effectiveness
of these methods. Machine learning methods can sidestep lack of conservation by utilizing quite distinct
features such as physicochemical properties and overall
composition of amino acids [15,18,19]. However, both
methods, especially the machine learning ones, require
many examples of a transporter family for effective
modeling, which may be a limitation for many
transporter families with few experimentally determined
members.
Recently, some integrative methods have been reported
that incorporate at least two data sources or methods.
We proposed a nearest neighbor approach previously
which integrated BLAST, Hidden Markov model (HMM)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/418

and topology analysis [20]. Another transporter annotation pipeline named TransAAP was launched along with
TransportDB [8]. It searches TCDB [5], PFAM [9] and
Gene Ontology [10], and utilizes a couple of empirical
rules for decision. Though TransAAP currently works
effectively for prokaryotic organisms, it is still weak in
handling eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, existing computational tools for transporter prediction, including
integrative methods, suffer from insufficient predictive
coverage or low accuracy. Extensive curation efforts are
still required for transporter annotation on a genomewide scale.
Here, we present an automatic transporter prediction
and characterization system called TransportTP which
has significantly increased predictive performance than
existing systems, including our previous work [20],
requiring, therefore, much less manual curation. TransportTP utilizes a two-phase classification approach
(Figure 1). Firstly, traditional homology-based
approaches are adopted to search the TCDB database
[5], during which pairwise and domain similarities are
integrated and initial predictions are made. The phase is
similar to our previous approach except that topology
analysis is not included [20]. Secondly, machine learning
methods are used to improve the initial predictions,
during which both non-homology evidence and homology evidence from other sources are integrated, such as
transmembrane segments and the consistency of TC
families of the top-K nearest neighbors in TCDB [20],
homologs in Pfam [9] and Gene Ontology [10]
databases, and non-transporter homologs from SwissProt [21]. All forms of evidence are converted into
features of a refining classifier and rules to discriminate
true positives from false positives of the initial classifier
are learned from some well-studied model organisms.
Unlike TransAPP [8], which integrates evidence by
empirical rules, TransportTP searches for discriminative
rules using machine learning methods, which is more
efficient and systematic, since certain types of evidence
may be conflicting with each other, or may be biased in
different databases, such as Pfam [9] and Gene Ontology
[10]. Thus, manual handling of empirical rules are very
difficult to be efficient, but machine learning methods
are efficient at searching for the discriminative boundary
in a large evidence space.
TransportTP was implemented as both Linux command
lines and a web server. Only basic information, such as
nucleotide/amino acid sequences, predictive options like
training organisms and initial e-value threshold, are
required by TransportTP for prediction. The predictive
results are presented in a user-friendly manner through a
web interface, enumerating all evidence used in decision
making and providing cross-links from the evidence to

related databases for further verification. Results are
sortable via various criteria selected by the user, to
accommodate specific interests or curation emphasis.
Implementation of the system is very efficient due to the
use of parallel computing algorithms among multiple
CPUs in a single computer and/or computers spanning a
local network.

Results and Discussion
Data and performance assessment
The databases for implementation and testing of
TransportTP were downloaded in September 2008. The

TCDB [5] for the initial classifier consisted of 5,005
transporters within 557 TC families/superfamilies, of
which 173 possessed at least 5 members with corresponding HMMs. The terms of family and superfamily
are alternatively used in this manuscript because they
mix in the third taxonomic level of the TC system. If a
superfamily exists in a hierarchical branch, the superfamily was studied rather than its constituent TC
families. Pfam (ver 23.0) [9], Gene Ontology (GO)
[10] and SwissProt (ver 14.2) [21] databases contained
10,340 domains, and 163,260 and 398,181 curated
sequences, respectively. Eleven organisms were chosen
for cross-validation of TransportTP, including seven

model organisms (Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933,
Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C, Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa
and Homo sapiens), and four non-model organisms
(Picrophilus torridus DSM 970, Photobacterium profundum
SS9, Desulfotalea psychrophila LSv54 and Aspergillus fumigatus). Sequences and functional annotations of the
eleven organisms were acquired from NCBI, except for S.
cerevisiae and O. sativa, which were obtained from SGD
ftp://ftp.yeastgenome.org/yeast/data_download/
sequence/genomic_sequence/orf_protein/archive/ and
JCVI ftp://ftp.jcvi.org/pub/data/Eukaryotic_Projects/
o_sativa/annotation_dbs/pseudomolecules/version_5.0/
respectively. Five plant organims were chosen for case
studies, including Sorghum bicolor, Populus trichocarpa,
Vitis vinifera, Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii. The genomic sequences of the five plant
organisms were downloaded from JGI Microbial Genomics ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data, except for Vitis
vinifera, which was downloaded from Genoscope http://
www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/Download/Projets/Projet_ML/data/annotation/Vitis_vinifera_peptide_v1.fa.
Three measurements were applied in the performance
assessment of TransportTP. The first was recall, defined
as the proportion of transporters in test sets which were
exactly categorized by TransportTP with the same TC
family or superfamily. The test sets were either TransportDB [8] in cross-validations or curated transporters in
case studies. The second measurement was precision,
defined as the proportion of predicted transporters by
TransportTP which exactly matched the test sets in TC
family/superfamily. The third measurement was
balanced accuracy, which was the overall assessment of
a single test and was defined as:

Balanced _ acurracy =

2*Recall*Precision
Recall + Precision

(1)

These three measurements are also known as sensitivity,
selectivity, and F-measure, respectively. The average
value of each measurement on multiple testing organisms reflects the predictive performance of TransportTP
on the specific training organisms(s). Specificity and the
Receiver Operating Characteristic curve were not used in
our assessment because non-transporters are much more
than the transporters, making them less informative.
Cross-validation test
The performance of TransportTP was tested by two crossvalidation schemas: (1) Leave-one-in (LOI) cross-validation, i.e. choosing the proteome of one model organism
for training and the proteomes of other ten organisms for
testing; (2) Leave-multiple-in (LMI) cross-validation, i.e.
choosing the proteomes of all seven model organisms for

training and only the proteomes of the four non-model
organisms for testing. Redundant protein sequences with
a similarity of 40% or above were removed during the
training to avoid potential overestimation of prediction
accuracy. TransportDB [7,8] was used as a benchmark
transporter database in the cross-validation.
The leave-one-in cross-validation intended to examine
whether the classification rules learned from one model
organism can effectively predict transporters in other
organisms. S. cerevisiae (yeast) was chosen as an example
organism in our analysis with e-value threshold set to
0.1, since the best predictive results were often achieved
around this e-value threshold for most training organisms. The cross-validation results of the example are
shown in Table 1. On average, 81.8% (recall) of the
curated transporters of the ten non-yeast testing organisms in TransportDB were exactly predicted by TransportTP. The exact matches accounted for 81.8%
(precision) of the predictions and corresponded to a
balanced accuracy of 81.8% as well. Besides, there were
7.6% of predictions validated by a text mining program
through the comparison of functional annotation along
with the protein sequences (See Methods Section for
details). Those predictions were not counted in the
stringent assessment but they might be bona fide
transporters excluded by TransportDB [8]. The mismatch
at superfamily or family level between our predictions
and TransportDB was only 0.2% among the predicted
population. Only a slight difference in performance was
observed between model and non-model organisms,
with the balanced accuracy of 82.0% and 81.4%, average
recall of 81.7% and 81.8%, and average precision of
82.2% and 81.1%, respectively. This result indicated that
the over-representation of transporters of model organisms in the training datasets did not influence significantly the predictive accuracy due to efficient avoidance
of overtraining by the Support Vector Machines [22]
applied in the refining classifier. On the contrary, other
factors such as evolutionary distance between the
training organisms and the testing organisms may
contribute more to the difference of predictive accuracy.
The performance between model and non-model organisms training on other individual organisms also
supports this hypothesis (see Additional file 1).
Predictive performance differed significantly between
major transporter classes. The best performance was
achieved for carriers, followed by channels, and finally
primary active transporters. More specifically, TransportTP achieved a balanced accuracy of 87.9% on 74
carrier families, 61.5% on 31 channel families, and 54.6%
on 8 primary active transporter families that TransportDB
reported on the ten non-yeast testing organisms, at the
e-value threshold of 0.1 (see Additional file 2 for details).

Average on all testing proteomes

The proteome of the yeast was used for training and the ten non-yeast proteomes were used for testing at the e-value threshold of 0.1. TransportDB
was chosen for the benchmark transporter database. The “matches” column represents the number of proteins predicted by TransportTP and
curated by TransportDB with the same TC family or superfamily (the third taxonomic level). The “mismatches” column corresponds to the number
of proteins predicted as transporters by both methods but with conflicting TC classification. The column of “TransportDB unique” is the number of
proteins annotated by TransportDB but absent in the predictions of TransportTP. The number of “text mining validated” corresponds to the number
of proteins not annotated by TransportDB but predicted by TransportTP and validated by our text mining program through the functional
annotations together with protein sequences.

This difference in performance is likely due to factors such
as distinct transporter mechanisms within transporter
classes, other than difference in sequence divergence in
transporter families, since the correlation between the
balanced accuracy and sequence identity of the predicted
families/superfamilies on the ten testing organisms was
0.23, a weak correlation.
The complete results of leave-one-in cross-validation
tests at the e-value threshold of 0.1 are shown in Figure 2
and Additional file 3. Although the performance varied
with respect to various training and testing organisms, it
can be summarized as follows: (1) the average balanced
accuracy was 80.6% among 70 cross-validations (excluding self-training and testing), of which 43 (61%) crossvalidations had a balanced accuracy of over 80%. If
e-value thresholds were variable for specific training and
testing organisms, 53 out of the 70 (76%) crossvalidations achieved a best balanced accuracy of over
80%; (2) E. coli yielded the worse performance among
the seven training model organisms because it was the
only prokaryotic organism used for training. C. elegans
had the worst testing performance for most training
organisms probably due to the poor annotation of this
organism, as reflected by many un-annotated proteins in
NCBI; (3) The performance of a testing organism was
greatly influenced by the evolutionary distance to the
training organism. The diagonal elements in the figure
generally served as the performance peaks since they
correspond to zero evolutionary distances between
training and testing organism.

The leave-multiple-in (LMI) validation results using all
model organisms for training and the four non-model
organisms for testing are shown in Table 2 and
Additional file 4. Two fold results were observed from
the comparison of this approach with leave-one-in (LOI)
approach using individual model organism for training.

corresponding degree of balanced accuracy in percentage,

The proteomes of seven model organisms were used for training and proteomes of four non-model organisms were used for testing at the e-value
threshold of 0.1. TransportDB was chosen for the benchmark transporter database. The definition of the columns can be referred to Table 1.

The LMI approach achieved better balanced accuracy on
the four non-model testing organisms than the LOI
approach using C. elegans, D. melanogaster, H. sapiens
and E. coli for training, but comparable to that using
S. cerevisiae, A. thaliana and O. sativa for training. For
example, the LMI approach achieved comparable
balanced accuracy (80.2%) to that yielded by the yeast
alone (81.4%) in the LOI approach. Nevertheless, the
maximal loss of balanced accuracy using all model
organisms for training was 3.2%, compared with any
individual organism for training at the same e-value
threshold, therefore, it seems to be a good trade off using
all model organisms for training if no well-studied
model organism exists.
Comparative study of performance
The performance of TransportTP was also studied by
comparing it with other approaches, using at a broad
range of e-value thresholds between 10 and 1e-50, to
reveal the comprehensive characteristics of TransportTP
and alternative strategies.

Firstly, TransportTP was compared with BLAST search,
the approach used widely by biologists, and the
integration of BLAST and HMM, the approach applied
in our initial classifier. S. cerevisiae (yeast) was again
chosen as an example training organism for analysis. The
comparative results are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.
TransportTP significantly outperformed both BLAST
search and BLAST plus HMM, as measured by precision
versus recall over a wide range of E-value thresholds
(Figure 3). Superior performance of TransportTP versus
BLAST plus HMM demonstrates the value of integrating
various transporter-related evidence in the refining
classifier of our method. Figure 3 also demonstrates
the value of integrating HMM models with BLAST search
in the initial classifier of TransportTP since BLAST plus
HMM was always superior to BLAST alone.
The advantages of TransportTP are further demonstrated
in Figure 4, which shows the average balanced accuracy
of the ten non-yeast testing organisms versus e-value

thresholds adopted in the initial classifier. TransportTP
outperformed both BLAST plus HMM and the BLAST
search alone in balanced accuracy, especially at commonly used e-value thresholds. At the threshold e-value
10, TransportTP outperformed BLAST plus HMM by
49.3%. The great increase of balanced accuracy resulted
from an increase of precision from 14.1% to 63.8%
along with a relatively small decrease of recall from
91.6% to 87.2% (corresponded to the rightmost points
of the two curves in Figure 3). At this high e-value
threshold, most transporters were covered in the initial
classifier, making it possible for the refining classifier to
discriminate the true positives from the false positives. At
very low e-value thresholds, many true positives are
excluded and few false positives are included, limiting
the power of the refining classifier to generate effective
discriminative rules.

Figure 3
Precision versus recall of TransportTP compared
with alternative approaches. Precision versus recall was
comparatively studied among TransportTP, BLAST plus
HMM, and BLAST alone. The yeast proteome was used for
training and the proteomes of ten other organisms was used
for testing at e-value thresholds between 10 and 1e-50
(e-values not shown). Precision and recall were averaged on
the ten non-yeast testing organisms.

on plant transporters in general. Finally, although most
of these organisms were recently sequenced, they lack
good annotation for membrane transporters [8].

Figure 4
Balanced accuracy of TransportTP compared with
alternative approaches. Balanced accuracy was
comparatively studied among TransportTP, BLAST plus
HMM, and BLAST alone. The yeast proteome was used for
training and the proteomes of ten other organisms was used
for testing.

TransportTP was also compared with other reported
methods. Compared with our previous work [20], which
was similar to our initial classifier but included the TMS
filtering, TransportTP achieved a better balanced accuracy of 81.8% compared with 67.0% in the previous
approach. More specifically, TransportTP significantly
improved the precision from 55.9% to 81.8%, with a
slight sacrifice in recall from 83.6% to 81.8% (For
fairness, validations through the text mining program in
the previous approach were excluded in this comparison). Compared with SVMPort [15], TransportTP
achieved better performance in recall, precision and
most importantly, the much larger coverage of TC
families, since SVMPort only achieved an average recall
of 81.0% and an average precision of 26.1% among five
TC superfamilies and three families in an independent
evaluation set.
Case studies
The performance of TransportTP was investigated further
using sequences from five model plant oraganisms,
based on the availability of whole proteome and their
evolutionary divergence. Sorghum bicolor (sorghum),
Populus trichocarpa (poplar) and Vitis vinifera (grape) are
important agricultural organisms. Physcomitrella patens
(moss) is a simplest plant model for plant functional
evolutionary studies, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
(green alga) is a single-cell green alga organism,
representing the group from which land plants evolved.
These organisms span a large part of the plant family
tree, from single-celled to vascular plants, including
monocots to dicots, so that the performance on these
organisms should reflect the performance of TransportTP

The performance of TransportTP on plant organisms was
evaluated via the comparison of the predictive results of
the program with the manual curation by our biologists.
Automatic transporter prediction was learned from the
model plant organisms Arabidopsis thaliana at an e-value
threshold of 10, to cover as many transporters as
possible. Manual transporter curation was carried out
via human review of all transporter-related evidence
from candidate proteins, specifically transmembrane
proteins and homologs of TCDB transporters. The
evidence included all data utilized by TransportTP,
such as predicted membrane topology, presence of
homologs in TCDB [5], conserved Pfam domains [9],
Gene Ontology terms [10], and presence of homologs in
SwissProt database [21]. In addition, evidence which was
difficult to manage by automatic prediction, such as
annotation of homology hits in the NCBI NR-Refseq
database [23], were also reviewed. Curated putative
membrane transporters were organized into confidence
levels based on types of confidence for the classification.
Level one corresponded to the highest confidence, in
which almost all expected pieces of evidence for a
transporter superfamily/family supported the classification. Level two corresponded to a moderate confidence,
where a minor piece of evidence was conflicting or
missing (such as a little bit short of protein length). Level
three corresponded to the lowest confidence level, in
which multiple types of evidence or an important
evidence were missing (such as lack of characteristically
conserved domains and/or too small protein length),
raising doubts about the transporter functionality or
gene annotation. The union of level-one and level-two
confidence levels was considered as a benchmark for
manual curation of membrane transporters, while the
level-three was only taken as reference and disregarded
in further analysis. The detailed results are hosted at
http://bioinfo3.noble.org/transporter/model.htm.
The comparative results for manual curation versus
automatic prediction of transporters for the five plant
organisms are shown in Table 3. On average, 74.6% of
putative transporters curated manually for the four plant
organisms, excluding the green alga, were exactly
predicted by TransportTP. The exact matches accounted
for 73.4% of the automatic predictions. Another 8.6% of
automatic predictions exactly matched manual curation
with level-three confidence, which may also include
some bona fide transporters.
Predictions of the green alga were less successful
presumably because of the evolutionary distance from

The manual curation and automatic prediction by TransportTP were compared in five plant organisms at the e-value threshold of 10. The column of
curated is the number of transporters manually curated with confidence level 1 or level 2. The fourth column corresponds to the number of
predictions matched the curation with confidence levels 1 and 2. The last column is the proportion of predictions matched the curation with
confidence level 3.

Arabidopsis, the training organism. Nevertheless, TransportTP still achieved a recall of 56.6% with respect to the
manual curation approach and a precision of 72.0% on
the automatic prediction. Compared with TransportDB
which includes P. patens and C. reinhardtii, TransportTP
achieved a recall of 77.6% and a precision of 78.6% on
P. patens at an e-value threshold of 1, and achieved a
recall of 71.5% and a precision of 72.8% on C. reinhardtii
at an e-value threshold of 0.01 (see Additional file 5 for
details). The results demonstrate a solid performance of
TransportTP in predicting transporters on plant organisms using a model plant proteome for training.
Further investigation of the comparative results revealed
that the confidence levels of manual curation were
correlated with their recall of TransportTP on the groups.
Specifically, 79.6%, 49.2% and 19.4% of curated
transporters in confidence levels 1, 2 and 3 were exactly
predicted by TransportTP, respectively, on the five plant
organisms explored (details not shown). The low recall
made by TransportTP for confidence level 3 does not
deny the effectiveness of TransportTP, since the manual
curation could not reliably assert this group of potential
transporters into superfamilies/families, indicating
major problems for classification of these proteins.

Discussion
We adopted stringent assessment in the cross-validation
of TransportTP, where only predictions matching with
curated transporters in TransportDB were counted in
correct ones during the training and the testing.
However, TransportDB manually excluded some categories of transporters [8], resulting in these transporter
categories incorrectly trained and undetectable in the
testing for any genome being annotated. Therefore, if
the coverage of the benchmark database improves, the
predictive performance will be further increased, both
for the cross-validation and for case studies.
We did not adopt the standard k-folds or leave-one-out
cross-validations but instead, used leave-one-in strategy,

because the underlying transporter mechanisms in
different organisms may be distinct although they
share very large similarity. For example, the distribution
of transporter families and the gating mechanisms of
transporters are likely to be different between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [24]. Thus, the combination of multiple organisms for training a classification
model may not always increase the predictive accuracy,
as shown in Additional file 4.
We did not adopt traditional Support Vector Machine
(SVM) but used an ensemble and balanced SVMs in the
refining classifier, to handle the unbalanced data
produced by the initial classifier. The comparative results
of using traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) [22]
without the ensemble and balanced technology are
shown in Additional file 6. Although TransportTP with
and without the ensemble of balanced SVMs achieved
almost equivalent balanced accuracy with respect to the
same e-value threshold used in the initial classifier,
TransportTP outperformed traditional SVMs measured
by precision versus recall, especially when the initial
predictions were highly imbalanced with true and false
positives. Similarly, the ensemble and balanced techniques brought improvement to precision versus recall for
decision trees like CART [25]. However, the balanced
random forest of decision trees [26] was not adopted in
TransportTP because of its over-training on model
organisms and unstable performance, as shown in
Additional file 6.
Despite of the effectiveness and efficiency, some potential pitfalls of TransportTP exist. Firstly, although nonhomology pieces of evidence contribute significantly to
the performance, sequence homology still plays a
nontrivial rule in the inference of novel transporters. If
some proteins are very similar to transporters but in fact
they are not transporters, for example, receptors or
sensors, which evolved from transporters but diverged
functionally since the evolutionary split [27], they may
be annotated as transporters incorrectly. Fortunately, the

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:418

inclusion of characteristic features such as presence of
conserved domains and number of transmembrane
segments in our method may help distinguishing these
proteins from the transporters in a great extent.
Secondly, TransportTP targets on individual transporters
rather than multimeric transporters, which are complex
functional structures assembled from products of multiple genes. For example, human TAP transporters dimers
[28], while glutamate transporters are trimers [29]. For
those multimeric transporters, each polypeptide chain is
classified individually into a transporter family according to the characteristics assigned for the chain, even
when some other chains are not found to complete the
transporter function. We opted to offer the possibility for
the researchers to find the whole multimeric transporter
structure, which would require further analysis such as
examining the interactions among the chains and
functional evolution of each chain.
Thirdly, TransportTP generally relies on complete protein sequences for classification, since partial sequences
will introduce doubts on functionality of the gene/
peptide, thus being confined to lower confidence levels.
When handling partial sequences such as some ESTs, the
classification will depend on the key regions of the
proteins available for classification, such as unique
conserved domains and transmembrane segments. In a
nutshell, the system is built to rely on whole protein
sequences, but can be useful for partial sequences, with
loss of robustness.

Conclusions
In summary, the effectiveness and the utility of
TransportTP has been demonstrated in detail through
cross-validation between model and non-model organisms, comparative study with alternative strategies in the
cross-validation, and the case studies of plant organisms.
TransportTP will be of importance for researchers working on annotation of newly assembled genomes,
especially eukaryotic genomes, and will probably be
used as an additional step for classification of genes/
proteins that cannot be clearly classified as transporters
by using existing database resources. The approach of
TransportTP may be of interest for improvement of
broad classification tasks, showing how new classification rules can be extracted from sequences through
combination of homology and non-homology evidence.

Methods
Preprocessor
The framework of TransportTP is shown in Figure 1. It
consisted of two components, a pre-processor and a
predictor, and two interfaces, i.e. a web interface and a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/418

command line interface. The predictor was further
divided into two phases: an initial classifier followed
by a refining classifier.
The pre-processor constructed transporter-related databases and models for the predictor. A transporter-related
Gene Ontology database [10] was constructed through
the exaction of a subgraph rooted at the term
GO:0022857, which corresponded to transmembrane
transporter activities. The subgraph contained 561
transporter terms and associated 5,393 transporter
sequences. Meanwhile, a transporter-related Pfam
domain database was constructed via: (1) all crosslinks between Pfam domains and TC families embedded
in the Pfam database [9], (2) additional mapping
between TC families and Pfam domains, constructed
via all-versus-all HMM search [9] between TC sequences
and Pfam domains, where a TC family was linked to a
Pfam domain if at least a proportion (50% in implementation) of members in the TC family contained the
Pfam domain, (3) other manually curated mappings.
Consequently, 487 Pfam domains were mapped to 320
TC families or superfamilies (see Additional file 7). The
construction of transporter-related databases was necessary because the inclusion of non-transporter terms or
domains had little contribution to the predictive
performance while significantly increased the computation cost. Two kinds of models were built for the
predictors. An HMM model was constructed for each TC
family/superfamily in TCDB [6] for the initial classifier if
having enough cardinality, through the SAM program
due to no pre-alignment requirement of member
proteins [30]. A classification model was constructed
for the refining classifier from some well-studied model
organisms during which the initial classifier was invoked
but the refining classifier was not involved, to avoid
potential circling.

Initial classifier
The initial classifier of TransportTP started categorization
of unknown proteins among hundreds of TC families in
the TCDB and an exceptional group, i.e. non-transporter,
using sequence homology based search. The BLAST and
HMM e-value scores of an unknown protein, corresponding to the pairwise and family similarity with
respect to the TCDB database, were combined, since this
combination improves the predictive accuracy [20,31].
Specifically, the two similarity scores were weighted by
the square root of their product, to trade off the two
similarities. The transporter in the TCDB database which
had the smallest weighted score was said to be the
nearest neighbor of the unknown protein. Correspondingly, the attached TC family/superfamily of the nearest
neighbor was initially predicted as the family or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/418

superfamily of the unknown protein if the weighted
score was below a user-specified threshold; otherwise, it
was categorized as a non-transporter. To handle the case
that many transporters in TCDB might not be associated
with HMM scores due to the limited member of
transporters in their TC families, thus impossible to
develop HMM models, a weighted score may be directly
compared with an unweighted score, for the comparability arising from their roughly equivalent implications. The formalization of the initial classifier is in
Equation 2 and more details can be referred to our
previous paper [20].
⎧ blast(p, q ij ) * hmm(p, MDL i ) | Fi |≥ κ & blast(p, q ij ) ≤ τ

⎧ arg i s(p) if s(p) ≤ λ

⎩ nontransporter if s(p) > λ

(2)
In equation 2, p is an unknown protein for prediction,
s(p) is the weighted score, f(p) is the classification
function and l is the threshold to discriminate transporters from non-transporters; qij is the jth transporter in
the ith TC family Fi, blast(p, qij) is the BLAST e-value
between the protein p and the transporter qij and the
hmm(p, MDLi) is the HMM score of protein p on the
transporter family Fi, where MDLi is the HMM model
built for the family, |Fi| is the cardinality of family Fi,  is
the threshold of family cardinality for construction of
HMM models and τ is the threshold of BLAST search. The
three cases in calculating s(p) for transporter qij corresponds to 1) both BLAST and HMM scores being
available, 2) only HMM e-value being available and 3)
only BLAST e-value being available.
Refining classifier
The refining classifier was to distinguish false positives
from true positives generated by the initial classifier,
because numerous false positives may be generated due
to the lack of negative features of non-transporters in the
TCDB database. The discriminative rules between false
positive and true positives were learned from some wellstudied model organisms based on a variety of transporter-related features. The excluded non-transporters by
the initial classifier were not further refined because the
initial classifier was designed to cover most of true
positives, thus the small number of false negatives, i.e.
missed transporters, would not influence the overall
predictive accuracy while greatly increasing the efficiency. Seven categories of features for initially categorized proteins were extracted from transporter-related
databases and the input sequences. The first was the
basic homology scores to TCDB database generated by

the initial classifier, specifically the BLAST and HMM evalue scores, calculated by Tera-BLASTP [4] and SAM
[30], respectively. The second category of features was
the initially categorized transporter classes, such as
channels, carriers, or primary active transporters, and
the sizes of the initially categorized transporter families,
since the size may impact the quality of the homology
inference. The family size was transformed logarithmically to avoid potential dominative impact.
The third category of features for initially categorized
proteins was the number of transmembrane segments
(TMS) in the proteins and in the initially categorized TC
families. The number of TMS within most TC families
are conserved throughout evolution, due to specific
functional requirements [24]. Therefore, beyond the
TMS number as a basic feature of an unknown protein,
a z-score measurement [32] was applied as another
feature of the protein, to approximately estimate the
match extent between an unknown protein and the
predicted TC family in TMS number. The z-score was
calculated as follows:

z score (p, F ) =

tms(p)−π (tms(F ))
σ (tms(F ))+ξ

(3)

where tms(p) was the number of TMS of a protein p,
taken as the maximum calculated by HMMTOP [33] and
TMPRED [34], π and s were the mean and standard
deviation of TMS of the initially categorized TC family F
of the protein p and ξ was a tiny constant to prevent the
denominator of being zero.
The fourth category of features for an initially categorized protein was the consistency of TC families among
the top-K homologs (K is a small constant [35]) of the
protein in the TCDB, evaluated by the proportion of the
top-K homologs possessing the same TC families as that
of the top homolog of the protein in the TCDB. High
consistency is a very positive sign for potential transporters. The feature was also amended as an additional
feature for the cases where the cardinalities of the
predicted families were smaller than the constant K, in
which K was adjusted to the cardinality of the initially
categorized family to capture the maximal possibility of
consistency.
The fifth category of features for an initially categorized
protein was the occurrence of transporter-related Pfam
domains, calculated by HMMER [9] with user specified
e-value threshold. The occurrence of transporter-related
domains provided an important clue for the potential
transporters, especially for families showing characteristically conserved domains. Two Pfam features of an
unknown protein were extracted for the refining

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:418

classifier. The first feature was the best e-value score
among the transporter-related Pfam domains and the
second was whether the occurred Pfam domains coincided with the initial categorized TC family of the
unknown protein, through checking the mapping
between Pfam domains and TC families established in
the preprocessor.
The sixth category of features for an initially categorized
protein was the hits of transporter-related Gene Ontology terms [10], via the BLAST search of the protein
against the transporters attached in transporter-related
GO terms [4]. A hit of transporter-related GO terms was
a positive sign of potential transporters and the best evalue score among the hit transporter sequences in the
transporter-related GO database was extracted as a GO
feature of the unknown protein for the refining classifier.
Whether one of the hit GO terms coincided with its
initially categorized TC family in function was considered as another feature of the unknown protein. To
simplify the situation where each transporter logically
belonged to a branch of GO terms, TransportTP only
counted the directly belonging GO terms as hit terms
and searched for the functional coincidence between
these hit terms and the initially predicted TC families,
using a text mining program we developed. The text
mining program justified the consistency between two
descriptions if enough significant overlapping words
were found. Obviously insignificant English words were
filtered but compatible words were counted, based on a
series of compatibility rules generated on the basis of
biological activity; for example: the abbreviation K+ was
compatible with words such as potassium, ions and
metal. The last category of features was the negative
information from UniProt/SwissProt [21]. If the nearest
neighbor of an unknown protein in SwissProt was more
similar to the protein than the nearest neighbor in TCDB
and its function in SwissProt implied a non-transporter
function, such as a transcription factor, the initial
categorization of the protein based on TCDB was more
likely to be a false positive. Based on this principle, the
existence of this kind of confliction between the nearest
neighbors in TCDB and SwissProt was extracted as a
feature of the protein for the refining classifier. The list of
keywords chosen for detection of non-transporter functions is shown in Additional file 8.
The classification value of an initially categorized protein
for the refining classifier was defined as whether the
initial classifier categorized the protein with a correct TC
family. A false classification value meant that the protein
should be removed from the final predictions. A true
classification value of a training protein in the refining
classifier was determined by the match with a curated
transporter at family or superfamily level in TransportDB

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/418

[7,8]. TransportDB was chosen as a benchmark database
because the transporters collected in this database were
curated by biologists, hence the data therein was
relatively reliable.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the Weka package [36]
was adopted in the training and testing of the refining
classifier because it could optimally determine the
decision boundary of two classes with the least overtraining [22]. An ensemble of balanced SVM approach
was developed to specifically handle the highly imbalanced data in the refining classifier at most e-value
thresholds. All instances of the minor classes were
selected but only a part of instances in the majority class
with the amount equal to the cardinality of the minor
class were randomly selected without replacement for
each SVM classifier. The number of SVMs in the ensemble
was proportional to the imbalanced ratio, which was:

n SVM =

N major
N minor

*β +1

(4)

where Nmajor and Nminor were the number of instances in
the majority and minority classes, respectively, and b was
a constant. If b was large enough, being 10 in our
implementation, most instances in the majority class
would have a chance to be explored. The ensemble of
balanced SVMs vote by their confidences to decide the
final predicted classification value for an unknown
protein. The stochastic and voting strategies have been
similarly applied in handling imbalanced data and
proved to be effective [37,38].
