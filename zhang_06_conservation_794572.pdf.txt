Abstract
Background: Microsatellites are extremely common in plant genomes, and in particular, they are
significantly enriched in the 5' noncoding regions. Although some 5' noncoding microsatellites
involved in gene regulation have been described, the general properties of microsatellites as
regulatory elements are still unknown. To address the question of microsatellites associated with
regulatory elements, we have analyzed the conserved noncoding microsatellite sequences
(CNMSs) in the 5' noncoding regions by inter- and intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting in the
Arabidopsis and Brassica genomes.
Results: We identified 247 Arabidopsis-Brassica orthologous and 122 Arabidopsis paralogous
CNMSs, representing 491 CT/GA and CTT/GAA repeats, which accounted for 10.6% of these
types located in the 500-bp regions upstream of coding sequences in the Arabidopsis genome.
Among these identified CNMSs, 18 microsatellites show high conservation in the regulatory
regions of both orthologous and paralogous genes, and some of them also appear in the
corresponding positions of more distant homologs in Arabidopsis, as well as in other plants. A
computational scan of CNMSs for known cis-regulatory elements showed that light responsive
elements were clustered in the region of CT/GA repeats, as well as salicylic acid responsive
elements in the (CTT)n/(GAA)n sequences. Patterns of gene expression revealed that 70–80% of
CNMS (CTT)n/(GAA)n associated genes were regulated by salicylic acid, which was consistent with
the prediction of regulatory elements in silico.
Conclusion: Our analyses showed that some noncoding microsatellites were conserved in plants
and appeared to be ancient. These CNMSs served as regulatory elements involved in light and
salicylic acid responses. Our findings might have implications in the common features of the overrepresented microsatellites for gene regulation in plant-specific pathways.

Background
Microsatellites, as one of the major repeat classes, are
extremely common in eukaryotic genomes [1]. They are
generally thought to result from the mutation effects of
replication slippage [2]. Different from the origin of microsatellites from repetitive DNA in animals [3], plant microsatellites show a significant association with
nonrepetitive DNA [4]. They can be found abundantly
within or near genes in plant genomes, and in particular,
some types are significantly enriched within the 5' noncoding regions of plant genes [5-7]. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, this feature is mostly attributable to the fact
that CT/GA and CTT/GAA repeats are more frequently
found in 5'-flanks than in other genomic regions, suggesting that they can potentially function as factors in regulating gene expression [7].
For quite a long time, microsatellites were only considered as genetic markers in DNA fingerprinting and diversity studies due to the extensive length polymorphisms.
However, recent findings show that some of them act as
cis-regulatory elements which can be recognized by transcription factors [8,9]. It has been well known for socalled GAGA elements, comprising the dinucleotide
repeat sequence (GA)n to be present in promoters regulating numerous developmental genes in animals [10,11].
Similarly, the (GA)n sequences in regulatory regions of
some plant genes can also be recognized by GAGA-binding factors [12-14], and more generally, the GA-rich element, a more complex 9 base pairs (bp) based (GA)n
repeat, has been shown to have protein-binding affinity
[15]. Another major microsatellite in plants, the trinucleotide repeat sequence (GAA)n presented within 5'UTR of
ntp303 was found important in the modulation of transcription and translation efficiency [16]. Furthermore,
some unusual phenotypic variations were found to be
associated with the length of 5' noncoding microsatellites.
A typical example was reported by Bao and his colleagues
that variation in the number of CT/GA repeats in the
5'UTR of the waxy gene was correlated with amylose content in rice [17]. Although the mechanism is still unclear,
the microsatellite length polymorphism is thought to
affect the expression of the related genes of amylose synthesis.
Regions of DNA involved in gene regulation are expected
to exhibit sequence conservation between related species
over evolutionary time due to functional constraints. It
has been recognized that comparative analyses of noncoding DNA sequences in multiple species, known as phylogenetic footprinting, can help identify conserved putative
regulatory elements [18]. Successful identification of conserved noncoding sequences in comparisons among different grass genomes and cruciferous species, as well as
between closely related genomic sequences from Arabi-

dopsis and Brassica species has provided some good references for discovery of Conserved Noncoding
Microsatellite Sequences (CNMSs) by phylogenetic footprinting in plants [19-22].
If microsatellites are important for regulating gene expression, they should be conserved in the homologous promoters through gene duplication or speciation during
plant evolution. To address the question of microsatellites
associated with gene regulatory elements, we used interand intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting to analyze
the dominant microsatellites in the 5' noncoding regions
of Arabidopsis and Brassica oleracea genes for CNMSs.
About 10% of 5' noncoding CT/GA and CTT/GAA repeats
are conserved in the Arabidopsis genome, and they are preferentially involved in gene regulation in plant-specific
pathways.

Results
Distribution of microsatellites in different genomic regions
The characteristics of microsatellite occurrences were surveyed among the different genomic regions in the Arabidopsis genome. It was obvious that microsatellites were
found to be highly abundant in the regulatory regions,
and the over-representation of CT/GA and CTT/GAA
repeats contributed most to the increase of microsatellites
in these regions (Figure 1A, 1B). This preference of CT/GA
and CTT/GAA repeat occurrences indicated that they
might have the role in regulating genes.
Conservation of microsatellites in Arabidopsis
Regulatory sequence elements within promoter DNA are
often short, orientation independent and contain frequent gaps of variable size. Thus, we determined the conserved noncoding microsatellite sequences as candidate
regulatory elements based upon the following criteria:
that there were at least 6-bp overlapping regions of the
corresponding microsatellites between the aligned
sequences. According to the criteria, we identified 247
Arabidopsis-Brassica orthologous CNMSs and 122 Arabidopsis paralogous CNMSs [see Additional file 1], involving
491 CT/GA and CTT/GAA repeats respectively (Table 1),
which accounted for 10.6% of these types located in the
500-bp regions upstream of coding sequences in the Arabidopsis genome. These CNMSs do not randomly occur in
different noncoding regions and they tend to be found
more frequently near the initiation codon (Figure 2A, 2B).

In order to validate the above study and to ensure that the
observation of CNMSs was not simply due to its over-representation in plant genomes, a similar analysis was carried out on three different random datasets, i.e. the 1000
homologous pairs of 5' noncoding sequences in Arabidopsis as dataset 1, the 1000 randomly shuffled pairs of 5'
noncoding sequences as dataset 2 and the 1000 random

pairs of genomic DNA sequences as dataset 3, as well as
the three corresponding datasets of Arabidopsis and
Brassica sequence pairs with the same data size. Figure 3
showed the frequencies of CNMS (CT/GA)n and (CTT/
GAA)n in dataset 1, dataset 2 and dataset 3, respectively.
Obviously, there was very little probability that CNMSs
were found in the 500-bp genomic DNA sequence pair by
chance. In contrast with the random pairs of noncoding
sequences, the homologous noncoding sequences
showed significant high in the frequency of CNMS occurrences. Taken together, these tests indicated that some
microsatellites in regulatory regions were conserved from
common ancestors during plant evolution.
Evolution of conserved microsatellites in Arabidopsis
To gain insight into the evolutionary relationship of Arabidopsis-Brassica and Arabidopsis-Arabidopsis CNMSs, the
synonymous substitution rate (Ks) was calculated for the
corresponding gene pairs. For Arabidopsis-Brassica orthologous CNMS gene pairs, the frequency distribution showed
a clear peak for Ks values of 0.4 to 0.5 (Figure 4A), suggesting that these CNMSs were conserved from a common
ancestor over a 15 million years (Myr) period, which was
consistent with the divergence time frame estimated at

14.5 to 20.4 Myr based on mitochondrial DNA data [23].
On the other hand, we noticed two peaks in the Ks distribution of Arabidopsis paralogous CNMS gene pairs, and
the Ks values were 0.8 to 0.9 and 1.2 to 1.3, respectively
(Figure 4B). The former group contained most of the paralogous CNMSs which were originated from large scale
gene duplication over 28 Myr ago, which was consistent
with the recent polyploidization event during evolution
of the Arabidopsis genome [24]. The latter group were
duplicated from the common ancestor over 42 Myr ago,
which probably occurred at the time of the divergence of
brassicaceae family [25].
The results from the evolutionary relationships of Arabidopsis-Brassica and Arabidopsis-Arabidopsis CNMSs suggested that most paralogous CNMSs pre-dated the
divergence of the two species; hence, many paralogous
CNMSs in Arabidopsis were likely to find their counterparts
in Brassica. Further comparisons of paralogous and
orthologous genes from Arabidopsis and Brassica were
made for common CNMSs (Figure 5A, 5B). With the same
criteria, we identified 18 CNMSs found in Arabidopsis paralogous pairs that also were coincident with CNMSs from
at least one orthologs in Brassica (Table 2). We called these

conserved elements, shared among paralogous and
orthologous genes, Ultra-CNMSs. An example of such
Ultra-CNMSs was shown in Figure 5C, and the three
homologous CT repeats were highly conserved from a
common ancestor over 48 Myr.
Conservation of microsatellites in plants
As expected, analysis of regulatory regions of related gene
families revealed that many Ultra-CNMSs were conserved
across a number of more distantly homologous genes in
Brassicaceae species and other plants. Figure 6A showed
that CNMSs (CT)n were conserved among orthologous
genes from Arabidopsis, Brassica, Medicago and rice, as well
as among more distantly paralogous genes in Arabidopsis.
These genes are representatives of a larger family of transmembrane receptor kinases and related non-transmembrane kinases in plant genomes. Many of them arised
from a common ancestor of dicots and monocots.
Another striking CNMS was found in the regulatory
regions of GATA transcription factor genes from Brassica,
Arabidopsis and rice. Of 14 members in subfamily I in the
Arabidopsis genome [26], five of them have the same
CNMSs found in their regulatory regions (Figure 6B).
These CNMS associated transcription factor genes that fell
into two subgroups indicated they diverged before the
dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants [26]. It
was obvious that these Ultra-CNMSs had been passed
down from a common ancestor of dicots and monocots
under extreme purifying selection for more than 170 Myr
[27].
Annotation enrichment and depletion of CNMS associated
genes
We tested whether CNMSs in genes were influenced by the
function of the proteins they encode. There were 206 Ara-

bidopsis-Brassica and 194 Arabidopsis-Arabidopsis CNMS
associated genes with known function in the Arabidopsis
genome. We looked for categories of biological process
and molecular function defined in the Gene Ontology
(GO) database that were significantly enriched or
depleted in these genes [28,29]. These CNMS associated
genes showed significant functional enrichment for transcription factor activity (P < 1.8 × 10-7 for orthologous
CNMS genes, and P < 7.7 × 10-7 for paralogous CNMS
genes, against all GO annotated Arabidopsis genes) and
transcription (P < 4.5 × 10-4 for orthologs and P < 6.6 × 105 for paralogs) (Figure 7), and genes that performed the
functions of the two types accounted for about 23% of all
known genes. However, they were obviously depleted for
DNA metabolism (P < 2.2 × 10-4 for orthologous CNMS
genes, and P < 1.8 × 10-2 for paralogous CNMS genes).
These findings suggested that CNMSs might be specifically associated with regulation of transcription at the
DNA level, but not involved in DNA metabolism.
CNMSs as regulatory elements in plants
To further investigate the regulatory nature of these
CNMSs, we employed a computational method to discover cis-elements that were similar to function assigned
elements based on the PlantCARE [30,31] and PLACE
databases [32,33]. The identification of cis-elements
showed that some binding sites were clustered in the consevered microsatellite regions, and these regulatory elements were involved in plant-specific functions in
response to some environmental stimuli (Table 3). The
CNMS (CT)n include the TCTCtCT sequences similar to
the TCCC motif known as part of conserved DNA module
array AtpCD-CMA involved in light responsiveness
[34,35]. Another function of CNMS (CT)n may be as an
enhancer due to the same motif (TCTCTCTCT) found in a

60-nt region downstream of the transcription start site of
the CaMV 35S RNA, which can enhance gene translation
in plant protoplasts [36]. As complementary sequences to
(CT)n, (GA)n serve as regulatory element having similar
functions, which contain a series of overlapped GAG
motifs (AGAGAGa) involved in light regulation [35,37].
In soybean, it is clear that the 18-bp GAGA element
sequence within the Gsal promoter can be recognized by
GBP encoded by a light-regulated gene [12]. The CNMS
(CTT)n contain sequences similar to the TCA-element
(TCATCTTCTT) which is a binding site for salicylic acidinducible proteins [38]. Similarly, the CNMS (GAA)n contain AGAA sequences having the characteristic of the core
recognition sequence (tcAGAAgagg) for salicylic acidresponsive genes [39].

Although CNMSs (CT)n/(GA)n and (CTT)n/(GAA)n are
similar to known regulatory elements, most of them have
no experimental verification for their functions. Therefore, all CNMS (CTT)n/(GAA)n associated genes were
selected to investigate their changes in expression levels
after the treatment of salicylic acid. The abundance of
gene transcripts evaluated by the MPSS showed these
CNMS (CTT)n/(GAA)n associated genes had distinct
expression characters with salicylic acid treatment (Figure
8A, 8B). About 70–80% of CNMS (CTT)n/(GAA)n associated genes in Arabidopsis leaves were regulated by salicylic
acid, while others were undetectable with and without salicylic acid treatment. Among these salicylic acid-responsive genes, only about 15–23% of them were up-regulated
by salicylic acid, and most of them were inhibited after the

treatment. Seven CNMS (CTT)n/(GAA)n associated genes
were additionally analyzed for expression patterns after
salicylic acid treatment. The RT-PCR showed that these
investigated genes, excepted At2g05920 and At5g67360,
were obviously down-regulated by salicylic acid (Figure
9), which were consistent with the patterns of gene expression from the Arabidopsis MPSS database. According to the
expression patterns by RT-PCR, we found the preliminary
correlation between repeat number of CTT/GAA motif
and gene in response to salicylic acid. The (CTT)4/(GAA)4
sequences were associated with gene down-regulation
with salicylic acid stimulus, but the (CTT)5 and (CTT)7
associated genes were not obviously regulated by salicylic
acid. These findings implied that regulation of CNMS
associated gene expression by salicylic acid might be
dependent on the number of CTT/GAA repeats.

Discussion
Microsatellites (CT)n/(GA)n and (CTT)n/(GAA)n are well
presented in the Arabidopsis genome, and in particular,
they are preferentially located within the 5' noncoding
regions. In this study, we identified 491 conserved CT/GA
and CTT/GAA repeats for candidate regulatory elements
by inter- and intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting.
These CNMSs tend to occur within these regions near the
initiation codon with the preference of CT and CTT
motifs, which are consistent with the characteristic of pyrimidine-rich repeat distribution in these regions [5,7].
Another striking feature of CNMS distribution is that they
are rarely found in the peri-centromeric regions; in contrast, their related genes are always clustered in chromosome arms (data not shown). The reasons for the absence
of CNMS on peri-centromeric regions are still unclear, but

Annotation enrichment and depletion of CNMS associated genes
Annotation enrichment and depletion of CNMS associated genes. In the top half of the figure, the maroon bars
("observed") give the numbers of orthologous CNMS genes that are annotated in the Arabidopsis GO database with molecular
function "transcription factor activity" or biological process "transcription regulation" and "DNA metabolism". The blue bars
("expected") give the number of genes that one would expect to obtain if the same number of genes were chosen at random
among all genes annotated in the relevant database. The bottom half of the figure gives similar information for paralogous
CNMS genes in Arabidopsis.

CNMS associated genes occurring in clusters on chromosome arms is probably attributable to co-expression.
Microsatellites generally evolve rapidly, but there are
about 10% of 5' noncoding CT/GA and CTT/GAA repeats
which show high conservation in occurrences and appear
to be ancient. In particular, the Ultra-CNMSs have been
under purifying selection for more than 42 Myr, and some
of them for at least 170 Myr. This conservation may be
explained by function constraint so that many homologous genes have the corresponding microsatellite
sequences in their regulatory regions. Most microsatellites

of CT/GA and CTT/GAA types seem to be originated by
recent mutations under positive selection [4,7], which
lead to the significant over-representation of microsatellites in the 5' noncoding regions compared with other
genomic fractions. The reasons of positive selection for
some repeat occurrences are still unknown. However, at
least, they may provide opportunities for rapid adaptive
changes in these regulatory regions or play specific roles in
gene regulation.
It is well known that intergenomic phylogenetic footprinting is an effective method for the discovery of regulatory

multiple species [18-22]. In plant genomes, intragenomic
phylogenetic footprinting represents another powerful
strategy to detect regulatory elements due to the facts that
most plant genomes are rich in duplicated genes and large
fractions of these gene pairs share transcriptional characteristics [40]. Although detection of the full complement
of cis-elements is not feasible by this approach due to
potential acquisition and loss of individual regulatory elements between duplicated promoters, we can readily
identify several specific regulatory elements which show
high conservation in duplicated genes. Using this
approach, we have successfully identified 122 Arabidopsis
CNMSs as candidate regulatory elements of plant-specific
function. Most of paralogous CNMSs were originated
from the recent polyploidization event before the divergence between Arabidopsis and Brassica [23], implying that
they might be conserved with their counterparts in
Brassica. We compared the data generated by inter- and
intragenomic phylogenetic footprinting and found 18
CNMSs highly conserved in both orthologous and paralogous sequences. The number of the identified ultraCNMSs may be underestimated for the incomplete reference genome sequences of Brassica or the false orthologous relationships. These conserved microsatellites
occurring among three or more homologous genes provides greater evidence that these CNMS are likely to be significant in gene regulation.
Functional annotation showed that CNMS associated
genes were obviously depleted for DNA metabolism, such
as DNA replication, DNA recombination and DNA repair.
It is possible that genes that are essential for survival, lack
CNMSs within their 5' noncoding regions because these
genes do not need some specific regulatory elements. In
contrast, these CNMS genes are preferentially associated
with regulation of transcription in plants. CNMSs serve as
regulatory elements and their related genes can be responsive to one or more forms of environmental stimuli (Table
3). The functional biases imply that CNMS associated
genes (e.g. transmembrane receptor kinase genes and
transcription factor genes) encoding proteins are involved
in upstream pathways of defense responses in plants.
Although GAGA elements are known to be involved in the
regulation of numerous developmental genes in animals
[10,11], we believe that CNMSs (CT)n/(GA)n are likely to
be associated with transcriptional regulation in light signaling pathways in plants [35]. These CNMSs are often
found in a number of different light-regulated genes
[12,41]. Although expression of most CNMS (CT)n/(GA)n
associated genes was not significantly changed with light/
dark transitions, three Ultra-CNMSs related genes
(At5g52430, Atlg21920 and At3g62650) were obviously
induced with longer periods of darkness according to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/323

microarray gene expression data of 7800 unique Arabidopsis genes [42]. This was consistent with the fact that about
9% of these CNMS genes were significantly down-regulated, while only 2% of them were up-regulated for light
by a whole-genome expression analysis in seedling of Arabidopsis [43]. It is possible that the expression level
changes of most CNMS (CT)n/(GA)n associated genes are
not obvious under light since they are always in upstream
of related pathways. However, CNMSs (CT)n/(GA)n, at
least parts of them, may be the binding sites for trans-acting regulators involved in light signaling pathways and
their associated genes can be induced under darkness.
Salicylic acid is well known as an important signaling
molecule involved in both locally and systemically
induced disease resistance responses [44]. Many salicylic
acid responsive genes have been found in plant defense
pathways. The CNMS (CTT)n/(GAA)n associated genes
exhibit distinct expression characters with salicylic acid
treatment, implying that they may be associated with a
range of different stresses [38]. CNMSs (CTT)n/(GAA)n as
regulatory elements regulating gene expression are associated with the repeat number in salicylic acid signaling
pathways. They may not act as isolated transcription factor binding sites to regulate gene expression. Instead, they
are likely to co-operate with other elements to perform
complex regulatory functions in transcription. Perhaps
some of them may perform roles in RNA interference by
forming RNA duplexes with complementary antisense
microsatellite sequences, which lead to quite a few CNMS
genes whose transcripts are undetectable in Arabidopsis
leaves.

Conclusion
Microsatellites (CT)n/(GA)n and (CTT)n/(GAA)n are preferentially associated the 5' noncoding regions in the Arabidopsis genome. Parts of them are conserved among the
homologous genes and appear to be ancient. The computational prediction and gene expression analysis indicated
that CNMSs (CT)n/(GA)n and (CTT)n/(GAA)n acted as regulatory elements involved in light and salicylic acid
responses. From our analysis, the presence of CT/GA and
CTT/GAA repeats in regulatory regions may be particularly
useful as a guide for further experiments of plant regulatory networks in response to environmental stimulus.

Methods
Plant materials
The Arabidopsis plants were grown in soil in a growth
chamber at 20°C with 8 hours of light for 40 days. Plants
were sprayed to run-off with 1 mM salicylic acid in 0.5%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for different time scales. One,
four, twelve and forty-eight hours post-treatment, leaves
were cut and harvested respectively, quick-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, then stored at -80°C. Total RNA was later

extracted using Plant RNA Mini Kit (Watson Biotechnologies INC., China).
Sequence data sources
The annotated sequences of the five chromosomes of Arabidopsis (accession numbers: NC_003070, NC_003071,
NC_003074, NC_003075, and NC_003076, updated 25JAN-2005) were downloaded from the Genomes Division
of GenBank [45,46]. Intergenic regions were defined as
being a part of DNA from the end of the last exon of one
gene to the beginning of the first exon of the following
gene. A set of 16223 full-length cDNA sequences containing both 5' and 3'UTRs for Arabidopsis was extracted from
the TAIR database [47]. The preliminary sequences of
Brassica genome were obtained from The Institute for
Genomic Research website [48].
Identification of orthologous and paralogous gene pairs
To identify putative Arabidopsis-Brassica orthologous gene
sets, each preliminary sequence from Brassica was
searched against 1-kb sequences (fragments from the
position -500 to +500 relative to the translation initiation) of all genes from Arabidopsis using BLASTN [49] and
then the fragments from Brassica were clustered according
to the best match gene of the Arabidopsis genome. Conversely, each 1-kb gene sequence from Arabidopsis was
searched against the contigs from Brassica. Two sequences
were defined as orthologs if each of them was the best hit
of the other in the aligned regions and if the expect value
(E) was <le-10. A list of the identified Arabidopsis-Brassica
orthologs in the study is provided as supplementary data
[see Additional file 2].

For identifying the paralogous gene pairs from a recently
common ancestor in the Arabidopsis genome, each annotated coding sequence was searched against all other coding sequences using BLASTN. The best pair was
considered significant if each of them was the best hit of
the other and the expect value was <le-10. A file of the list
of the paralogous gene pairs is included as supplementary
data [see Additional file 3]. To avoid the negative conservation of microsatellites caused by the effects of insufficient randomizing mutations, the tandemly repeated gene
pairs separated by less than 25 intermediate genes were
ignored in further analysis.
Microsatellite detection
Microsatellites were found in sequences using the modified Sputnik repeat-finder [50]. Di-and trinucleotide
repeats were identified when a total size of at least 12-bp,
allowing up to about 10% deviation from a perfect repeat.
Repeat motifs consisting of different frames (e.g. GAA,
AGA and AAG) were regarded as the same type of repeat.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/323

Identification of CNMSs
Because gene fragments of Brassica were derived from preliminary contigs with no annotated open reading frames,
each pair of Arabidopsis-Brassica sequences were aligned
using DiAlign2 with translation option to identify the 5'
noncoding sequences and coding regions in the Brassica
orthologs [51]. The 5' noncoding sequence pairs were
aligned using DiAlign2 for finding conserved microsatellites. To exclude nonspecific alignments, a stringent
threshold parameter of 3 was used. The CNMSs were identified when the corresponding loci had at least 6-bp overlapping sequences between the aligned microsatellite
sequences.
Selection of random data sets
To ensure that CNMSs were not to occur by chance, we
used two different datasets of random pairs as negative
controls to validate the results. One control dataset contained 1000 random pairs of 500-bp upstream noncoding
sequences in the Arabidopsis genome, and another control
dataset of 1000 pairs was randomly generated from the
500-bp sequences of Arabidopsis genomic DNA fragments.
The reference dataset of equal data size was randomly
selected from the 500-bp paralogous noncoding sequence
pairs in Arabidopsis. The 1000 paralogous pairs, the 1000
shuffled pairs of noncoding sequences and the 1000 random pairs of genomic sequences were respectively
referred as dataset 1, dataset 2 and dataset 3 in further
analysis. Similarly, three corresponding datasets of Arabidopsis and Brassica sequence pairs were generated with the
same data size. The dataset 1 consisted of 1000 Arabidopsis-Brassica orthologous pairs of 5' noncoding sequences,
and the dataset 2 contained 1000 random pairs of Arabidopsis and Brassica upstream noncoding sequences, and
the dataset 3 of 1000 pairs was randomly generated from
the Arabidopsis and Brassica genomic DNA sequences. The
same criteria of CNMS detection was applied in the test.
Occurrences of CNMSs were analyzed in analogous manner for 10 different random sets with equal data size.
Estimation of duplication and speciation time
We used the level of synonymous substitution of CNMS
associated coding sequences to estimate the Ks of CNMSs.
For each pair of CNMS associated genes, the two protein
sequences were aligned by ClustalW, and the resulting
alignment was then used as a guide to align the nucleotide
sequences [52]. After removing gaps, the level of synonymous substitution was estimated using the yn00 program
in PAML [23]. The time of divergence (T), between two
sequences was calculated from this as T = Ks/2λ, where Ks
is the fraction of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site and λ is the mean rate of synonymous substitution. The estimate value for λ in dicots is 1.5 synonymous
substitutions per 108 years [53].

Estimation of gene expression level
Gene expression level was estimated using the data from
the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) database of Arabidopsis [54,55]. The MPSS data of three different libraries was generated from untreated leaves and
treated leaves 4 and 52 hours after salicylic acid treatment,
respectively. For the three libraries, a total of 9,081,200
17-bp signatures were obtained in multiple sequencing
runs and in two sequencing frames. The abundance for
each signature was normalized to transcripts per million
(TPM) to facilitate comparisons across libraries.

RT-PCR of Arabidopsis CNMS associated genes was conducted using the one-step RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa) with
gene specific primers [see Additional file 4]. The 0.5 µg
total RNA was used as the template to be amplified with
the following program: an initial 50°C for 30 min and
94°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 30s,
54°C for 30s and 72°C for 1 min. The house-keeping
gene actin2 (At3gl8780) was used as an internal control in
RT-PCR reaction.
