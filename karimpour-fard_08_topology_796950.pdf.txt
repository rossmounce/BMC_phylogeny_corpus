Abstract
Background: Protein-protein interactions networks are most often generated from physical proteinprotein interaction data. Co-conservation, also known as phylogenetic profiles, is an alternative source of
information for generating protein interaction networks. Co-conservation methods generate interaction
networks among proteins that are gained or lost together through evolution. Co-conservation is a
particularly useful technique in the compact bacteria genomes. Prior studies in yeast suggest that the
topology of protein-protein interaction networks generated from physical interaction assays can offer
important insight into protein function. Here, we hypothesize that in bacteria, the topology of protein
interaction networks derived via co-conservation information could similarly improve methods for
predicting protein function. Since the topology of bacteria co-conservation protein-protein interaction
networks has not previously been studied in depth, we first perform such an analysis for co-conservation
networks in E. coli K12. Next, we demonstrate one way in which network connectivity measures and
global and local function distribution can be exploited to predict protein function for previously
uncharacterized proteins.
Results: Our results showed, like most biological networks, our bacteria co-conserved protein-protein
interaction networks had scale-free topologies. Our results indicated that some properties of the physical
yeast interaction network hold in our bacteria co-conservation networks, such as high connectivity for
essential proteins. However, the high connectivity among protein complexes in the yeast physical network
was not seen in the co-conservation network which uses all bacteria as the reference set. We found that
the distribution of node connectivity varied by functional category and could be informative for function
prediction. By integrating of functional information from different annotation sources and using the
network topology, we were able to infer function for uncharacterized proteins.
Conclusion: Interactions networks based on co-conservation can contain information distinct from
networks based on physical or other interaction types. Our study has shown co-conservation based
networks to exhibit a scale free topology, as expected for biological networks. We also revealed ways that
connectivity in our networks can be informative for the functional characterization of proteins.

Background
Co-conservation, a measure of the degree to which proteins are gained and lost together through evolution (also
known as a phylogenetic profile [1]), has demonstrated
utility as a protein function prediction method [2-13],
particularly in bacteria. Pairwise co-conservation scores
can be aggregated into networks [7], and assessments of
connectivity within the resulting graph can further
improve the quality of function prediction. Function prediction methods based on biological networks is an active
area of research [14].
Topological analysis of other types of biological networks,
including protein-protein interactions, regulatory interactions, and metabolic networks, has demonstrated that
structural features of network subgraphs can provide
quantitative insight into biological function [15-33]. For
example, Maslov and Sneppen analyzed the stability of
interaction networks by comparing patterns in average
connectivity of interaction and regulatory networks [26].
Characterizations of the structural features of metabolite
networks [15,16,20,25,29-31] demonstrate a correlation
between topologically defined subnetworks and biochemical function. Topological characterizations also illuminate evolutionary issues. For example, Fraser et al.
observed that the effect of an individual protein on cell fitness correlates with the number of its interaction partners
[23]. Jeong et al. showed that most highly connected proteins in protein-protein interaction networks are crucial to
cell viability [24].
Due to the availability of genome-wide data, nearly all
previous investigations of network topology have been in
yeast, and the majority has been based on high-throughput assays of protein-protein interactions (PPI). In contrast, this paper examines co-conservation networks in
bacteria using different reference genomes, the first indepth study to our knowledge, of the topological characteristics of such networks. This characterization can be
used for current and future comparison to like studies in
other organism and network types. Co-conservation networks are distinct from physical interaction networks as
they capture putative functional relationships which are
not necessarily dependent on direct protein binding. We
find that bacterial co-conservation networks show both
biologically important similarities and differences with
yeast PPI networks. For example, similar to reports of significance in yeast PPI networks [24,34,35], node degree
(the number of other proteins that a protein is connected
to) in bacterial co-conservation networks is predictive of
broad functional categories, such as essentiality. Unlike
yeast PPI networks [26,28,34], the bacterial co-conservation network using all bacteria as the reference set does
not demonstrate high connectivity among proteins that
form complexes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/313

Such differences call into question the broad applicability
of the yeast methods for predicting function based on network topology. Here, the topological properties of bacterial co-conservation networks and their relationship to
function are examined. Based on this assessment, we demonstrate the use of co-conservation network topological
properties to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins.

Results and discussion
The bacterial co-conservation network constructed from
E. coli K12 and 267 other completely sequenced bacteria
(referred to as the All reference set) is shown in Figure 1a.
This network captures, for each E. coli K12 protein, which
other proteins it is co-conserved with in a large reference
group. We have previously described how such interaction networks can vary with the selection of reference
group [8] and that networks conserved across multiple
species can provide insight into the function of proteins
that act in coherent biological processes [7]. Here, we
assessed the topological characteristics of bacterial coconservation networks for the purpose of using such characteristics to improve protein function prediction.
Though most results are reported using the All genomes
reference set, we also provide comparison to using Motile,
Proteobacteria and Aerobic reference sets.
Topological features of E. coli K12 networks
The E. coli K12 co-conservation network using all
genomes as reference (the All network) contained 6,987
interactions, among 1,700 proteins, forming 312 disconnected subgraphs, called clusters (Table 1). The remaining
2,537 E. coli K12 proteins were not co-conserved with any
others, and would be singletons if they had been included
in the graph. Three large clusters were apparent, containing 417 proteins (with 4,157 interactions), 80 proteins
(with 203 interactions) and 58 proteins (with 353 interactions). Surprisingly, networks constructed from the other
reference sets (Motile, Proteobacteria, and Aerobic) contained roughly the same number of proteins as the All network, yet the number of interactions varied widely (Table
1).

The clustering coefficient was defined as the edge density
in the neighbors of a protein. The average clustering coefficient of the All network was high (0.81), indicating that
proteins tend to be co-conserved in highly connected
groups. The average shortest path (5.11) indicated that
there was a short path between any two proteins in a cluster. The average clustering coefficient remained high for
Motile, Proteobacteria, and Aerobic networks. Though the
connectivity average increased as the number of interactions increased, the average shortest path appeared to be
large in the Motile network, relative to the others. Moreover, the diameter of the Motile network was dispropor-

tionately large. This occurred because the Motile network
consisted of two large densely connected clusters bridged
by only a few edges and there existed many smaller clusters extending by long paths from the two dense cores
(Additional file 1).

The connectivity distribution P(k), the probability that a
protein interacts with k other proteins, shown in Figure 1b
for the All network, had a heterogeneous, skewed shape,
and indicated that most proteins were linked to only a few
proteins, but a few proteins had a large number of connections. P(k) in this graph was consistent with a power law

distribution P(k) ~ k-Î³, with Î³ = 1.77 (Figure 1b), indicating a scale free network. In the log-log plot of Figure 1c,
there was a high correlation (r = 0.98) between connectivity (k) and connectivity distribution (P(k)) for a large
range of k. However the correlation broke down for highly
connected nodes. Topological analysis is summarized in
Table 1 using different reference sets. Like many other biological networks [22,25,31], the bacterial co-conservation
networks using difference reference sets were all scale-free
(Additional file 1).
Hubs in scale free networks distinguish essentiality and complexes
Scale-free networks share a number of properties, including sensitivity to disruptions of highly connected "hub"
nodes and robustness to interference with non-hub
nodes, among others. Therefore, this result suggests that
the collection of hub nodes in bacterial co-conservation
networks should include a higher proportion of essential
proteins than the collection of non-hub nodes. Indeed,
essential proteins in our bacterial co-conservation network had significantly more interactions than non-essential proteins (see Table 2, except Proteobacteria),
validating earlier findings in yeast using other types of
interactions [24,35,36]. For example, the average degree
of essential proteins in the All network was 15.77 (SD =
19.93), while that of non-essential proteins was 7.87 (SD
= 12.49) (p = 0.0003). Note that the disparity of mean
connectivity between essential and non-essential proteins
suggests that connectivity alone can be used as a proxy for
essentiality. In the Proteobacteria network, the essentiality
is not predictable (Table 2). In that essentiality is not
evenly distributed among functional categories, these
results suggest that connectivity, and possibly other measures of network topology, might also be useful for
improving function prediction.

Unlike yeast PPI networks [26,28,34], high connectivity
in bacteria co-conservation networks does not allow identification of protein complexes. We noted that when the
reference genome was All, there was no significant difference between the connectivity of complex proteins vs.
non-complex proteins (Table 2). The small difference
between mean connectivity in the Aerobic network is statistically significant due to low overall standard deviation
of connectivity (Table 1). Interestingly, high connectivity

in the Motile and Proteobacteria networks corresponds to
non-complex proteins. This is in contrast to yeast PPI networks where high connectivity corresponds to protein
complexes.
Relationship between protein-protein interaction and coconservation networks
The co-conservation network was compared to the E. coli
K12 protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, obtained
from the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) [37],
which contained 4,922 interactions over 1,266 proteins.
The PPI network had no interactions for 1,144 proteins
that had at least one interaction in the co-conservation
network (the All network). Of these 1,144 proteins in the
co-conservation network, 533 were unclassified using
KEGG (42% have at least 1 annotated neighbor), 182
were unclassified using COG (80% with an annotated
neighbor) and 460 were unclassified using TIGR (57%
with an annotated neighbor). These proteins represent
examples where the co-conservation network allowed the
assignment of function to proteins which could not be
annotated using the PPI network.
Relationships among topological characteristics and
protein function
Function annotation homogeneity within clusters
The co-conservation protein clusters in the All network
ranged in size from 2 to 417 proteins. Considering clusters with at least two annotated proteins, the proteins in
all but the largest clusters tended to have identical function annotations, regardless of the source of annotation
(Figure 2). For clusters of size less than 11, the majority
are homogeneous for all different sources. Though some
medium and large clusters contained proteins with different function annotations, these proteins are often
involved in inter-dependent processes that contribute to a
common phenomenon [8]. For example, many clusters
contain proteins annotated to some specific function and
also to "regulation," where the regulation activity turns
out to be regulating the process in which the other proteins participate. The proteins that underlie a function and
its regulation were co-conserved. This was not an indication of functional heterogeneity, but was an artifact of the
annotation scheme.

Function and connectivity
Different functional classes displayed different average
connectivity (Figure 3). Since the definition of a functional class varied among different annotation databases,
Figure 3 shows the connectivity of each protein versus
KEGG [38], COG [39], and TIGR [40] functional categories. For KEGG and COG, regardless of the reference set,
proteins with high connectivity were generally involved in
cellular processes (Figure 3, green bars), which was interesting given that there were few cellular process proteins
in each network. In contrast, metabolism proteins (pink
bars) were abundant and generally had the lowest average
connectivity.

Using COG, cell division and chromosome partitioning
(D) in Figure 3 had high average connectivity using all reference sets except Aerobic. In the Proteobacteria network,
the most highly connected protein were intracellular trafficking and secretion (U) while the most highly connected
proteins in the Aerobic network were motility proteins
(N). TIGR classification showed proteins involved in
Motility had high average connectivity, while Central
intermediary metabolism and Cofactors were the least
connected (Figure 3).
Translation is one of the most ancient processes in the cell
and previous studies have shown that these proteins have
a high average connectivity [27,41]. The average connectivity of these nodes in our networks was low (J in COG
and Protein synthesis in TIGR, Figure 3); this was because
most of these proteins appeared in more than 90% of
organisms and were removed in the preprocessing step as
described in the Methods section. Additional file 2, 3, 4
show the presence of high connectivity among these proteins in networks when proteins that appear in more than
90% or less than 10% of the genomes in a reference set
were not removed. Interestingly, Przulj et al. have earlier
observed that in the yeast protein-protein interaction network, stress and defense and transport proteins are less
connected than transcription and translation proteins
[28]. Though the annotation sources for E. coli are completely different, the average connectivity in TIGR for
transporter and transcription were similar (Figure 3 and
Additional file 2, 3, 4). It is interesting that DNA metabolism is most connected in All, followed by DNA/Protein/
Amino acid in motile, followed by Protein in Proetobacteria, and finally amino acid in aerobic.
Function and hub proteins
Power law networks have a few nodes with many connections while the majority of nodes have few links. The
nodes with many connections (hubs) are shown to be
particularly interesting in a biological context as they can
have important roles for drug targets and are crucial in cell
viability, among other traits [24]. Intriguingly, in the All

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/313

network, many of the hubs (connectivity > 19) had no
functional classification in any annotation source (Table
3, Figure 4, Additional file 5, 6). Maslov and Sneppen
argue that hub proteins tend not to interact with other
hub proteins in yeast, but rather prefer to interact with
sparsely connected proteins [26]. This assertion was not
true in the bacterial co-conservation networks. In bacterial
co-conservation networks, hubs tended to interact with
other hubs. For example in the All network, of 3,943 interactions (173 hub proteins) where at least one partner was
a hub, only 24% (951 interactions) were between a hub
and a non-hub while 76% (2,992 interactions) were
between two hubs. Hubs were defined as the top 10% of
highly connected proteins; the same pattern holds when
the hubs were defined to be the top 20% of highly connected proteins (connectivity > 9). For hubs defined as the
top 10%, hub-hub connectivity was high in the Motile
(70% for connectivity > 44), Proteobacteria (66% for connectivity > 89) and Aerobic (57% for connectivity > 13)
networks. Although beyond the scope of this work, it
would be interesting to better understand why bacterial
hub nodes are highly interconnected and what effect on
network properties such interconnectedness confers. Our
interest is how connectivity information improves function prediction.
Using topological features to assign function to
uncharacterized proteins
Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that
specific aspects (i.e. connectivity) of network topology
could be used to improve function prediction of uncharacterized proteins. A popular approach to function prediction is to use the most frequently occurring function
among the neighbors of an uncharacterized protein [42].
One problem with this approach is that many neighbors
of unclassified proteins tend to also be unclassified. For
example, combining functional information from KEGG
[43], COG [39] and TIGR [44], 41% of the total number
of interactions (2,863/6,987 interactions) contained at
least one unclassified protein (546 proteins, 233 unclassified) in the All network. In 67% of the 2,863 interactions,
one partner was unclassified (479 proteins, 166 unclassified), while in the remaining 33% both proteins in the
pair were unclassified (184 unclassified proteins).

Importantly, the majority (60%) of neighbors of the
unclassified proteins were also unclassified using KEGG.
Based on our observations regarding the topology of the
co-conservation network described above, we hypothesized that extending the function prediction strategy to
include the majority function assignment of a cluster,
rather than just the neighbors of a protein, would improve
prediction.

The accuracy of this prediction strategy was validated by
determining the average percentage of proteins which
were assigned the majority function within their cluster.
The percentage value that defines the majority was calculated for each cluster and averaged over all clusters that
had at least three proteins and at least two were classified.
On average, 93% of classified proteins in a cluster were
assigned the KEGG function which was the majority
assignment in the cluster. This means taking the majority
vote of the cluster had an average prediction error of 7%.
Figure 2 further indicates how the prediction accuracy is
influenced by cluster size. Although 16% of the clusters
have no characterized proteins at all, using the entire cluster to predict function of unclassified proteins is a large
improvement over using immediate neighbors since 60%
of those were unclassified using KEGG.
The distribution of functional assignment of neighbors of
an unclassified protein also varied based on the connectivity of the protein (Figure 5a). There was a higher probability that an unknown protein connected to an
Environmental or Metabolism protein if the connectivity
was low (k = 1â15) whereas it was improbable to connect
to an Environmental protein for connectivities of 22â34.
In fact, the distributions suggested the unknown proteins
of degree 12 and 24 might be Metabolism proteins, as
only that category appeared among their notated neighbors. For connectivity 12, there were 13 classified proteins; 12 are Metabolism proteins and 1 was involved in
Genetic information processing. For the 5 classified proteins of connectivity 24, all of them were Metabolism proteins.
Predicting function based on the majority assignment of
immediate neighbors or entire cluster both rely on the
assumption that like interacts with like. However, it is
interesting to note that this may not be valid, as suggested
by the distributions of functional assignments of neighbors of characterized proteins (Figure 5b). Though the
accuracy of the distributions was confounded by the
strong presence of unclassified proteins, they suggested
Cellular Process proteins preferentially interacted with

Genetic Information Processing proteins. Moreover,
Genetic proteins slightly preferred to partner with Metabolism proteins, with a small bias against interacting with
Environmental proteins. For Environmental Information
Processing and Metabolism proteins, we see the expected
behavior of interactions between proteins of the same
function. This suggests that function prediction based on
majority function will be more accurate for proteins
whose true function is either of the latter and less accurate
for the two former categories. This claim is investigated
below.
Evaluating predictions based on topological properties
Of the 730 unclassified proteins (using KEGG) in the All
co-conservation network, 369 proteins had no annotated
neighbors, while 271 proteins were contained in a cluster
containing no annotated neighbors. This means that in
the former case, a function prediction algorithm based on
immediate neighbors would fail, while in the latter case, a
prediction algorithm which uses the entire cluster would
fail. For cases such as these in which nearby annotations
are not available, the distributions of Figure 5 suggest
ways in which topological information might instead be
exploited in function prediction algorithms.

Based on the observations detailed above, new predictions strategies were created to incorporate the connectivity of the protein and the differential preference of
interaction based on the functions assigned to a protein
pair. The contribution of each type and the combination
of topological information was evaluated using a cross
validation scheme where 10% of the 1,700 classified proteins in the All network with at least one classified neighbor were taken at random as the test set, their functions
hidden and predicted from quantities computed on the
remaining 90% of classified proteins (training set). From
this training set, distributions of node connectivity, function within a cluster, and function among immediate
neighbors in a cluster were calculated.

while Methods 11â15 apply Methods 3â7 to hub proteins
(top 10%, connectivity > 19).
Results in Figure 6 show that the two baseline prediction
methods, 1-SAMPLEUNIF and 2-SAMPLEGLOBAL, which
do not incorporate topological information had the poorest performances regardless of the annotation source used.
A significant improvement (p < 0.001 for all three annotation sources) over these baseline algorithms was seen
using connectivity information alone (5-SAMPLECON-

NECT). Using KEGG, nearly 44% of the proteins were
classified correctly using just connectivity information.
These results on classified proteins argue that despite
being a simple topological characterization, connectivity
could be particularly useful for unclassified proteins residing in clusters with no functional information, since
majority-based methods can not be applied.
Methods which can incorporate functional information of
the cluster in any form (Methods 3â4, 6â7) show substan-

tial improvement over the baselines. Though the 3MAJORITYNEIGH method outperformed the 4-MAJORITYCLUST method, the prediction task was made easier in
the evaluation than would be the case for true unclassified
proteins; the requirement that each test protein be connected to at least one other (true) classified protein
ensured that there were likely labeled proteins in the
immediate neighborhood from which to predict (proteins
which had no classified neighbors as a result of creating
the test set were not considered in the percent correct
count).

SAMPLECONNECT (5 vs. 13) showed a sharp increase in
performance for the set of hubs. The SAMPLENEIGH
method (14), based on neighbor information, suffered
from noise introduced from the high connectivity, yet
when combined with connectivity information (NEIGHCONNECT, 7 and 15) allowed further improvement over
connectivity information alone, even for the hubs. Moreover, for the highly connected proteins, the topological
based methods SAMPLECONNECT and NEIGHCONNECT outperformed the majority based methods,
MAJORITYNEIGH and MAJORITYCLUST.

The combination (7-NEIGHCONNECT) of connectivity
information (5-SAMPLECONNECT) and preference bias
for non-like pairs (6-SAMPLENEIGH) showed a significant improvement over preference bias alone for COG (p
< 0.0001) and KEGG (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 7-NEIGHCONNECT showed no statistically significant difference
in performance from 4-MAJORITYCLUST for KEGG and
COG (p < 0.0001 for TIGR).

Together these results suggest an improved function prediction algorithm for truly unclassified proteins, based on
the topological properties examined here. When there is a
single function assigned to the classified proteins in the
cluster, use the majority function of the cluster (4-MAJORITYCLUST) for the uncharacterized protein. Homogeneous neighbors and clusters are generally found for low
connectivity proteins. When there is more than one function represented by classified proteins in the cluster, use a
combination of connectivity and preference bias information (7-NEIGHCONNECT) for prediction. This situation
generally occurs for highly connected proteins.

These results indicated that choosing the majority function of the cluster or immediate neighborhood were better
methods on average. However, when the set of proteins
was divided into those whose function was predicted correctly or incorrectly using 4-MAJORITYCLUST, most
incorrect predictions were for proteins from clusters with
a heterogeneous, almost uniform, distribution of function
within the cluster. Of the proteins whose function was
predicted correctly by 4- MAJORITYCLUST, only 30%
resided in clusters with more than one function, compared to 100% for the set of incorrectly predicted proteins.
Methods 8â10 show the value of using connectivity information or preference bias of interaction when the function of the protein is not the majority function of the
cluster. The results show the benefit of using connectivity
and preference bias information, allowing up to 44% correct prediction (KEGG) for the set of proteins completely
missed by one of the best methods, 4-MAJORITYCLUST.
Though the average value was similar for 2-SAMPLEGLOBAL and 5-SAMPLECONNECT on all proteins, SAMPLEGLOBAL
performed
much
worse
than
SAMPLECONNECT on this set of proteins (average for
SAMPLEGLOBAL was 10% that of the average of SAMPLECONNECT, data not shown). Interestingly, the average
connectivity of this set of incorrectly predicted proteins
was high (KEGG 18.53, COG 31.65 and TIGR 28.19), suggesting that using topological information in predictions
might be most useful for hub proteins.
Methods 11â15 test the prediction accuracy on the hub
proteins, showing dramatic drops in performance for
MAJORITYNEIGH (3 vs.11) and MAJORITYCLUST (4 vs.
12). In contrast, using connectivity information within

Overall, our results show connectivity is particularly useful for characterization of unclassified proteins residing in
clusters where majority based methods either cannot be
applied (i.e. clusters lacking functional information) or
would likely fail (i.e. highly connected proteins).
Function predictions
In the artificial situation represented by our cross validation study, results showed that the majority based methods were effective for proteins whose immediate
neighbors or cluster members were generally assigned a
single function. For the true unclassified proteins, Additional file 7 shows the majority cluster method applied to
the smaller clusters containing at least one unclassified
protein and at least one classified protein using any annotation source. Of the 96 proteins in these 22 clusters, 38
proteins were unclassified by any annotation source.
Comparing our predictions to a later release of the COG
database which provided new annotations for 14 of the
38 proteins, we predicted 13 out of the 14 correctly using
the majority cluster method.

Conclusion
Bacterial co-conservation networks share some topological properties with yeast protein-protein interaction and
other biological networks, but differ in important aspects.
Like in yeast PPI networks, highly connected nodes are
related to essential functions, and the co-conserved protein-protein interaction network appears to be scale free.

It is unclear if the lack of variation observed in the remaining classes represents a true biological phenomenon or a
limitation of resolution. There is no difference between
the connectivity distributions of complexed and noncomplexed proteins in our data to justify the use of connectivity for complex prediction. In this respect, co-conservation networks appear to be distinct from physical
interaction networks. However connectivity in our networks does appear to be a reliable predictor for essentiality, in congruence with previous findings [24,35,36,45].
We took advantage of several properties of the network to
infer function for several of the uncharacterized proteins
in E. coli K12 (Additional file 7). The analysis of functional assignment for individual proteins and all protein
pairs (Figure 4 and Figure 5) showed that the frequency of
interaction between proteins depended on the function of
each partner and on connectivity. An interesting future
direction would be to incorporate these global observations within a function prediction algorithm and test the
accuracy of using connectivity and neighbor function
assignment information together to refine the likelihood
of assigning a given function to an unknown protein.

Methods
Bacteria selection
At the time of this implementation (June 2006), 268 complete microbial genomes were available through the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
and were downloaded from their ftp site [46]. E. coli K12
was selected as the target since a well curated dataset of
protein functions was available [47] and substantial
experimental data existed for this bacteria. Phenotypic
information such as motility and oxygen requirement was
generated manually from available data at NCBI. Several
different reference genomes were used in our system: 1)
All the fully sequenced bacteria available at NCBI (All
(268 bacteria)); 2) selecting based on Motility (Motile
(104 bacteria)); 3) selecting all proteobacterial species
(Proteobacteria (130 bacteria)); and 4) selecting based on
oxygen requirement (Aerobic (91 bacteria)).
Creating phylogenetic profiles matrix
Pairwise one-against-all BLAST searches were performed
to identify all proteins in the set of reference organisms
homologous to proteins in the target. For each protein i of
the target organism E. coli K12, the BLAST E-value of the
top scoring sequence alignment between protein i and all
the proteins of each reference genome j was assign to Eij.
The phylogenetic profile was constructed as a vector with
elements Pij, where Pij = 1 if a homolog exists (Eij < 10-5)
for the same protein in genome j, otherwise Pij = 0.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/313

similarities (as described below) since proteins that
appear in almost all organisms are likely to fall in many
functional categories (thereby adding unnecessary noise
to the prediction task) and proteins that appear in few
organisms are likely to be organism specific. Eliminating
these proteins avoid erroneously asserting interactions
among proteins whose profiles artificially have high correlation due to an overabundance of zeros or ones, rather
than any real biological significance. Previous work [8]
characterized the discarded proteins based on COG classifications and the majority of proteins that appeared in
more than 90% of the reference genomes were involved in
translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis. Additional file 8 and Additional file 2, 3, 4 provide the complementary topological analysis and comparison of
connectivity when the proteins appearing in more than
90% or less than 10% of the reference genomes were not
removed.
Measuring profile similarities
Given a set of phylogenetic profiles, the similarity
between any pair of proteins can be calculated using the
Pearson correlation coefficient. Similarity between two
profiles for protein X and Y using Pearson correlation
coefficient was calculated as in [1,4,48]

r=

f Z â f X fY
2
2
( f X â f X )( f Y â f Y )

where
fX = (I/N), fY = (J/N), and fZ = (K/N).
N is the number of organisms in the reference set, I is the
sum of PXj over all reference genomes j, J is the sum of PYj
over j, and K is the sum over the subset of genomes that
contain homologs of both X and Y.
Generating the interaction networks
Networks were created and presented as graphs in which
each protein was represented as a node and an interaction
between proteins was represented by an edge. In the coconservation networks, an edge existed between a pair of
proteins whose phylogenetic profiles similarity score
exceeded a given threshold (> 0.80). The physical proteinprotein interaction network was created by extracting all
interactions available for E. coli from the Database of
Interacting Proteins (DIP) [37], downloaded 7 July 2007.
For separation of connected components of the network
and building the clusters of proteins, breadth-first search
graph algorithms were used. Network graphs were visualized using Cytoscape [49] an open-source, platform-independent environment software.

We eliminated the proteins that appear in more than 90%
and less than 10% of organisms before measuring profile

Functional classification
The functional annotations of E. coli K12 proteins were
extracted from four databases: Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of proteins (COG) at NCBI [39] (downloaded 1/
5/2007), KEGG [38] (downloaded 1/5/2007), TIGR [40]
(downloaded 1/5/2007) and EcoCyc [47] (version 10.5).
E. coli protein complex data was also extracted from EcoCyc. Essential proteins were extracted from DEG database
[50]. KEGG classified proteins into four functional categories: Metabolism (Carbohydrate Metabolism, Energy
Metabolism, Lipid Metabolism, Nucleotide Metabolism,
Amino Acid Metabolism, Metabolism of Other Amino
Acids, Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism, Biosynthesis
of Polypeptides and Non ribosomal Pept, Metabolism of
Cofactors and Vitamins, Biosynthesis of Secondary
Metabolites and Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism); Genetic Information Processing (Transcription,
Translation, Folding Sorting and Degradation and Replication and Repair); Environmental Information Processing (Membrane Transport, Signal Transduction and
Signaling Molecules and Interaction); and Cellular Processes (Cell Motility and Cell Growth and Death) [38].
Since TIGR and COG classify proteins into 15 and 18 categories respectfully, these categories were manually
aligned to roughly correspond to the four KEGG categories for comparison (see Figure 2).
Analyzing the topology of the network
The degree of a node in a graph is the number of edges
connected to that node and proteins that are joined by an
edge are said to be neighbors. The clustering coefficient C
indicates the degree to which k neighbors of a particular
node are connected to each other. Let ki be the number of
neighbors of node i and ni be the number of edges in the
network that exist among the neighbors of i. The clustering coefficient [51] of node i is given as

Ci = 2 ni/(ki * (ki-1)).
Then the average clustering coefficient was calculated by
averaging Ci over all nodes i.
The connectivity distribution P(k), i.e., the probability
that a protein interacts with other proteins, was evaluated
empirically. The regression coefficient r between log (P
(k)) and log (k) could then be calculated. The exponent of
the power law distribution Î³ was estimated from the
observed distribution, as the slope of the line log (P (k))
versus log (k). The topology in relation to the function
was validated from available information in COG [39],
TIGR [40], KEGG [38] and EcoCyc [47] sources. The diameter and average shortest path of the network was calculated using a breath-first search algorithm.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/313

Defining hubs in network
As connectivity scales with network topology, we did not
assign a static degree to define the hubs. The hubs in the
network were defined to be the top 10% of the most connected nodes in our network, corresponding to a connectivity exceeding 19 in the All network.
Determining statistical significance
In Table 2, p-values in Table 2 were calculated using nonparametric Wilcoxon RankSum test in SAS [52].
Function prediction cross-validation
From the 1,700 proteins in the All co-conservation network, the set of classified proteins with at least one classified neighbor (910, 1321 and 921 respectively according
to KEGG, COG and TIGR) was divided uniformly at random into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets. The function of the proteins in the training set were hidden and
predicted from methods applied to the training set, and
the percentage of correctly predicted proteins was calculated over 100 cross validation splits. Using the training
set, the distribution of functional assignment versus connectivity was calculated for all classified training proteins.
Additionally, for each cluster, the distribution of the
number of interactions between proteins assigned with
each pair of functions was calculated. For each distribution, predictions based on sampling the function ignored
the count for unclassified proteins, renormalizing among
the remaining categories. The following prediction methods were used:

SAMPLEUNIF: predicted function is sampled uniformly at
random from the set of categories (KEGG 4 categories,
COG 18 categories, TIGR 15 categories)
SAMPLEGLOBAL: predicted function is sampled based on
the global distribution of known function among all proteins in the training set (similar to Figure 5c yet calculated
on the training set only)
MAJORITYNEIGH: predicted function is the majority
assignment to immediate neighbors (ties are broken randomly)
MAJORITYCLUST: predicted function is the majority
assignment within the cluster
SAMPLECONNECT: predicted function is sampled from
the distribution of functions for given connectivity (similar to Figure 5 yet calculated on the training set only)
SAMPLENEIGH: predicted function is based on first determining the majority function of the immediate neighbors,
examining all protein pairs in the cluster involving proteins with that function and sampling from the distribu-

tion of functional assignments for the other partners of
the pairs (similar to Figure 5b where the function indexed
by Protein is the majority function of immediate neighbors and Neighbor refers to partners of all proteins in the
cluster with that function)
NEIGHCONNECT: predicted function is sampled from
the combined distribution of SAMPLENEIGH and SAMPLECONNECT, calculated by multiplying the two distributions category-wise and then renormalizing across
categories.
