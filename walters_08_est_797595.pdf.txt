Abstract
Background: Heliconius butterflies possess a remarkable diversity of phenotypes, physiologies, and
behaviors that has long distinguished this genus as a focal taxon in ecological and evolutionary
research. Recently Heliconius has also emerged as a model system for using genomic methods to
investigate the causes and consequences of biological diversity. One notable aspect of Heliconius
diversity is a dichotomy in mating systems which provides an unusual opportunity to investigate the
relationship between sexual selection and the evolution of reproductive proteins. As a first step in
pursuing this research, we report the generation and analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
from the male accessory gland of H. erato and H. melpomene, species representative of the two
mating systems present in the genus Heliconius.
Results: We successfully sequenced 933 ESTs clustering into 371 unigenes from H. erato and 1033
ESTs clustering into 340 unigenes from H. melpomene. Results from the two species were very
similar. Approximately a third of the unigenes showed no significant BLAST similarity (E-value <105) to sequences in GenBank's non-redundant databases, indicating that a large proportion of novel
genes are expressed in Heliconius male accessory glands. In both species only a third of accessory
gland unigenes were also found among genes expressed in wing tissue. About 25% of unigenes from
both species encoded secreted proteins. This includes three groups of highly abundant unigenes
encoding repetitive proteins considered to be candidate seminal fluid proteins; proteins encoded
by one of these groups were detected in H. erato spermatophores.
Conclusion: This collection of ESTs will serve as the foundation for the future identification and
evolutionary analysis of male reproductive proteins in Heliconius butterflies. These data also
represent a significant advance in the rapidly growing collection of genomic resources available in
Heliconius butterflies. As such, they substantially enhance this taxon as a model system for
investigating questions of ecological, phenotypic, and genomic diversity.

Background
One of the most promising and productive research
approaches in contemporary biology involves deploying
modern genomic methods to investigate the origin, maintenance, and function of biological diversity present in

natural populations. Research efforts in this nascent field
of evolutionary and ecological functional genomics
(EEFG) generally can be split into two categories [1,2].
One approach studies natural populations of the few taxa
(or their close relatives) that are already well-established

laboratory model systems, making use of the extensive
molecular genetic and genomic resources available for
such organisms (e.g. Drosophila and Arabidopsis) [3,4]. The
alternative approach focuses on taxa which may be less
tractable from a methodological perspective but which
offer superb opportunities to investigate interesting and
important ecological and evolutionary phenomena. In
the case of such emerging model taxa, the development of
genomic resources such as genetic libraries, linkage maps,
and sequence databases are necessary and fundamental
first steps in any EEFG research program [2].
Heliconius butterflies stand out among emerging model
taxa for their extensive history in ecological and evolutionary research [5-12]. The genus Heliconius, comprised
of ~40 neotropical species, contains a remarkable diversity of phenotypes, behaviors, and physiologies, all of
which have evolved relatively recently [7,13-15]. The most
conspicuous and well-studied aspect of this diversity is the
variation, convergence, and mimicry of wing-color patterns present both within and between species [6,9,1621]. Efforts to identify the genetic basis of this wing pattern diversity have driven the recent development of
genomic resources for Heliconius butterflies [20,22,23].
The accumulation of such resources now provides a strong
precedent for investigating additional aspects of Heliconius
diversity.
Here we present the first genomic foray into facets of Heliconius diversity other than wing pattern. We focus on the
striking dichotomy of mating systems found within the
genus and sample the transcriptome of male reproductive
tissues from species representative of the two mating systems. Our two focal species are the co-mimetic H. erato
and H. melpomene. These species have an average synonymous site divergence of 14.5%, do not interbreed, show
extensive parallel radiations of wing patterns, and are the
primary focus for wing pattern research in the genus
[20,23,24]. Consequently, these species possess the vast
majority of genomic resources available for Heliconius:
BAC libraries, linkage maps, and extensive collections of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated from wing tissue
and curated in a lepidopteran-specific database,
[20,23,25-27].
Heliconius erato and H. melpomene represent the two divergent mating systems found in the genus. About half of
Heliconius species, including H. erato, exhibit an unusual
pupal mating behavior: females are mated before or during eclosion and typically mate only once (i.e. females are
monandrous). Otherwise, Heliconius butterflies, such as
H. melpomene, mate as fully developed adults and regularly mate more than once (i.e. females are polyandrous)
[7,8,10,13,28]. Heliconius species fall evenly into two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/592

major clades which correspond exactly with mating system [13].
This difference in mating system can engender very different regimes of sexual selection between the two clades. For
instance, the pupal mating system drives extremely
intense pre-mating sexual selection; males compete vigorously for mating position on the female chrysalis [8]. In
contrast, the lack of remating in pupal mating females
likely precludes most aspects of post-mating sexual selection such as sperm competition and cryptic female choice
(reviewed in [29]). Therefore this phylogenetically concordant split in mating systems presents an unusual
opportunity to explore hypotheses relating sexual selection to the molecular evolution of reproductive proteins.
Reproductive proteins include proteins mediating gametic
interactions or those found in seminal fluid. These proteins tend to diverge rapidly between related species and
often evolve via positive Darwinian selection (reviewed in
[30-32]). This is a pattern widely observed among animals
and also often in plants. It is commonly hypothesized that
post-mating sexual selection is the primary evolutionary
process underlying this pattern [33-38]. However, there
are very few data currently available that directly address
this hypothesis (but see [39,40]).
Ultimately we will use the dichotomous mating systems
in Heliconius to test for a relationship between intensity of
post-mating sexual selection and evolutionary rates of
reproductive proteins. To do this it is first necessary to
identify reproductive proteins in Heliconius butterflies.
Here again we take our cues from previous EEFG research,
though this time not from Heliconius but from Drosophila
fruit flies and from two genera of crickets. In these taxa
researchers focused on proteins secreted by the accessory
glands – part of the male reproductive tract – into seminal
fluid. Early work in this field focused on indirect criteria
such as the presence of a signal peptide and accessory
gland biased expression to identify genes encoding accessory gland proteins (ACPs) which were assumed to be
transferred to females in seminal fluid. Using modest
numbers of ESTs generated from cDNA libraries enriched
for male-biased transcripts, this work identified dozens of
ACPs in these species [36,41,42]. Subsequent studies at
the protein level verified that many of these ACPs are
transferred to females in seminal fluid [43-47]. These proteins have diverse and often dramatic effects on female
reproductive physiology and behavior, including stimulating egg-laying, facilitating sperm storage, and inducing
refractoriness to remating [48,49]. Moreover, in Drosophila melanogaster, genetic variation in seminal fluid proteins has been correlated with sperm competitive ability,
indicating an important link between reproductive protein evolution and sexual selection [50,51].

In this paper we present parallel analyses of ESTs generated from male accessory glands of the pupal mating H.
erato and the adult mating H. melpomene. These data constitute an important first step toward identifying a set of
seminal fluid proteins in Heliconius butterflies and using
these genes to examine the relationship between postmating sexual selection and the molecular evolution of
reproductive proteins. These data also contribute significantly to the development of Heliconius butterflies into a
sophisticated model system for genomic explorations of
ecological and evolutionary phenomena.

Results and discussion
Library construction and EST assembly
The accessory glands from 11 adult male H. erato and 10
adult male H. melpomene were dissected from live butterflies and pooled within species to generate two tissue-specific directional cDNA libraries. The H. erato and H.
melpomene libraries respectively contained 7 × 106 and 1.3
× 105 colony-forming units. To enrich for transcripts
expressed primarily in male tissue, both libraries were
screened with cDNA generated from conspecific female
abdominal tissue, and only non-hybridizing clones were
sequenced. Approximately 1150 clones were sequenced
from each species to generate a collection of ESTs which
then were trimmed of low quality reads and poly-A tails,
clustered, and assembled into contigs. We presume these
assembled clusters, or unique gene objects (unigenes), represent distinct transcripts. Results were very similar in
both species. H. erato yielded 371 unigenes and H. melpomene yielded 340. The two libraries were comparable in
number of high quality ESTs, average read length, and the
frequency spectrum of ESTs per unigene (Tables 1, 2). In
both libraries the vast majority of unigenes were represented by a single EST and ~90% of unigenes corresponded to three or fewer ESTs (Table 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/592

All EST sequences have been submitted to GenBank. H.
erato, [GenBank: GE841215–GE842150; H. melpomene,
[GenBank: GE842151–GE843183]. Complete unigene
sequences from H. erato and H. melpomene are available in
additional files 1 and 2, respectively.
Unigene Annotation
We annotated the unigenes using BLASTX and BLASTN to
search for similar sequences in GenBank's protein and
nucleotide non-redundant databases; a significance cutoff of E-value < 10-5 was used for both searches. Results are
summarized in Table 1; the top-five best BLAST hits for
each unigene are reported in additional file 3.

Overall, 69% of unigenes in each species yielded significant BLAST hits to GenBank sequences (H. erato: 257 of
371 unigenes; H. melpomene: 235 of 340). This suggests
nearly a third of the unigenes obtained from each species
may correspond to novel and previously undescribed
genes. In both species many unigenes with significant
BLASTN hits to GenBank lacked significant BLASTX hits
(H. erato: 41 unigenes, 11%; H. melpomene: 17 unigenes,
5%). These discrepancies could be explained in one of two
ways: 1) these unigenes corresponded to ribosomal RNA
or 2) these unigenes contained a Heliconius specific novel
repetitive element and were similar only to a few other
Heliconius sequences in GenBank containing such repeats
[52] (see section below: Novel Heliconius repetitive elements;
unigene sequences were not masked for GenBank
BLASTs). Nineteen unigene pairs were reciprocal bestBLAST-hits between H. erato and H. melpomene and also
showed no significant similarity to sequences in GenBank.
We used SignalP to identify protein-coding unigenes containing a predicted signal peptide sequence [53]. ACPs are

extracellularly secreted proteins and are therefore
expected to have a signal peptide [41,42]. Results were
again similar between libraries, with 86 (24.4%) secreted
proteins in H. erato and 92 (27.8%) in H. melpomene
(Table 1).
Gene Ontology
Where possible, we assigned Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to protein-coding unigenes using the Annot8r
application in the PartiGene software package [54,55].
Annot8r assigns GO terms to unigenes based on BLASTX
similarity (E-value < 10-5) to proteins with known GO
annotations; results are summarized via GO-slim terms
corresponding to broad functional classes. GO annotations fall into three independent categories (Biological
Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component)
and a single sequence may be annotated in any or all categories. Moreover, a single sequence may be associated
with multiple GO annotations within a single category,
giving rise to more GO-annotations than sequences annotated (Table 3). The complete set of GO annotations is
provided in additional file 4.

Overall we assigned GO annotations to 187 (50%) and
203 (60%) unigenes from H. erato and H. melpomene,

respectively. With one exception, the distribution of
annotations across GO-slim summary terms is quite similar between the two species for all three GO categories
(Figs. 1, 2, 3). The one exception is the class "structural
molecule activity" in the category Molecular Function
(Fig. 1). The proportion of H. melpomene annotations in
this class is twice that obtained from H. erato. This discrepancy clearly results from the greater number of ribosomal
proteins represented in the H. melpomene ESTs, although
it is unclear whether this reflects any biologically significant difference between the two species.
Novel Heliconius repetitive elements
Recently, Papa et al. identified nine novel, short (200–600
bp) Heliconius specific repetitive elements in BAC
sequences from H. melpomene and H. erato [52]. We used
RepeatMasker to identify and mask these repetitive elements in both accessory gland and wing unigenes [56].
Overall, each of the nine repeats were identified among
the unigenes, but not all were present in each library
(Table 4; Additional file 5).

As reported by Papa et al., repeat #7 was by far the most
abundant and was significantly more common in H. erato
(detected in 4.3% of unigenes) than H. melpomene (2.2%;
one-tailed test of proportions, p < .001). To better characterize the nature of these Heliconius repeats we further
examined repeat #7. Instances of this repeat typically fell
outside ORF predictions from the PartiGene software, suggesting that when present in transcribed sequence it
occurs in 3' or 5' untranslated regions of genes, not in the
coding sequence. For one H. erato accessory gland unigene
(Her00086), three of five ESTs lacked the repeat sequence;
this indicates that for at least one locus the repeat motif is
polymorphic (i.e. present/absent) among individuals
pooled for library construction. Finally, BLAST searches in
GenBank revealed repeat #7 was present in the introns of
two additional Heliconius species (H. doris, mannose phosphate isomerase, [GenBank:AF413748]; H. himera, dopa
decarboxylase I [GenBank:AY437779]). These results are

consistent with the interpretation of Papa et al. that these
repetitive elements likely arise from the replication and
insertion of transposable elements that are common
among Heliconius butterflies.

because the transcribed genes are truly homologous or
because a repetitive element occurs in both transcripts. We
therefore used the masked unigenes for all BLAST searches
between H. erato and H. melpomene libraries. We assume
that significant similarity scores produced using these
masked unigenes indicate homologous transcripts and
not spurious similarity due to sharing of repetitive
sequence.

These repeats present a practical problem when using
BLAST to identify homologous unigenes within and
between Heliconius species. Such searches may generate
significant alignment scores between unigenes either

libraries (Fig 4). For this analysis we assume that a highly
significant RBBH between unigenes indicates that these
transcripts originate from the same locus (within species)
or orthologous loci (between species). However, we fully
recognize that such questions of identity and orthology
can only be conclusively determined in the context of
complete genome sequences and that the modest number
of ESTs generated for some of these libraries hardly represents an exhaustive profiling of the tissue's transcriptome.
Nonetheless, contrasting the overlap in ESTs sampled
between species or tissues is useful for identifying qualitative differences and similarities in the results. For instance,
comparing wing and accessory gland RBBHs between species as a percentage of total H. melpomene unigenes yields
similar results: ESTs sampled from accessory glands (84/
340 = 24.7%) and from wing (537/1869 = 28.7%) show
similar proportions of unigenes shared between species.
We used H. melpomene unigenes as the denominator in
this comparison because H. melpomene has fewer ESTs
sampled from both tissues, which we assume is a limiting
factor in identifying RBBHs. These results suggest consistency between libraries, but must be interpreted with caution due to differences in library construction and EST
sampling. We anticipate that the numbers of genes identified in common between these species will increase dramatically as more ESTs become available.
A useful comparison can also be made between tissues
within species. Genes common among accessory gland

ESTs but absent from wing ESTs are promising candidates
for encoding seminal fluid proteins. Encouragingly, the
results from both species clearly indicated that a majority
of transcripts sampled from the accessory glands were not
present in wing tissue unigenes (Fig 4). In H. erato only
141 accessory gland unigenes had high-scoring BLAST hits
(E-value < 10-10) to wing unigenes, of which 135 were
RBBHs. In H. melpomene there were 125 high-scoring
BLAST hits to wing unigenes, with 117 RBBHs. Therefore,
in both species about 65% of accessory gland unigenes
were not found among transcripts sampled from wing tissue.
Considered broadly, this lack of overlap indicates that the
set of genes sampled from accessory glands is qualitatively
different from the set of genes previously sampled from
developing wing tissues. The wing libraries were not
screened or subtracted and were well-sampled (H. erato,
17,573 ESTs;H. melpomene, 4,976 ESTs) [27], so this discrepancy in genes sampled from the two tissues likely
reflects two phenomena, one biological and one methodological. Biologically, it might be that patterns of gene
expression are quite different between these two tissues;
the differences in sampled genes therefore may reflect substantial differences in transcript abundances. However,
verifying this would require much deeper EST sampling
and a methodologically consistent approach for profiling
transcripts (e.g. microarrays). Apart from any underlying
biological differences, our sampling method was also
explicitly biased: we probed our libraries with female
cDNA and sequenced non-hybridizing clones in order to
enrich our ESTs for male-specific transcripts. Although we
do not have unbiased samples for comparison, the relatively low and stable proportion of unigenes shared
between wing and accessory gland ESTs suggests that the
enrichment for male-specific transcripts was moderately
successful and that the resulting accessory gland ESTs will
prove a useful resource for identifying seminal fluid proteins. Nonetheless, the enrichment process was clearly not
perfect. For instance, many accessory gland unigenes
showed highly significant BLAST hits to well-known
'housekeeping' genes which presumably exhibit little differential expression between sexes (e.g. cystathionine betasynthase,elongation factor 1-α, ribosomal proteins, and
ribosomal RNAs) (see additional file 3).
Highly abundant transcripts are repetitive, secreted
proteins
Both the H. erato and H. melpomene libraries contained a
few unusually abundant transcripts (i.e. >20 ESTs per unigene, Maximum: H. erato, 168; H. melpomene, 133; Table
2). BLAST searches within libraries revealed that these
abundant transcripts were highly similar to several other
less-abundant transcripts. Overall there were three such
groups each composed of about ten unigenes. Each group

Page 6 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:592

encoded highly repetitive proteins, two with a repeat
structure rich in tyrosine and one rich in asparagine; all
had a predicted signal peptide (Fig 5). These same three
groups were identified in both species and sequences
within groups were clearly similar between species. Similarities were also evident in the repeat structure present in
the two tyrosine-rich groups. Unfortunately, extensive
indel variation and the repetitive nature of these
sequences precluded reliable alignments among any of
these unigenes. Therefore robust inferences of homology
between these sequences were not possible either within
groups or between species. Sequences included in Figure
5 have been submitted to GenBank [GenBank: FJ465130
– FJ465135].
It is worth noting that the H. erato transcripts from the
third (asparagine-rich) group exhibited some exceptions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/592

to the patterns uniting these groups of proteins. First, they
completely lacked the repetitive asparagine-rich C-terminus motif that characterizes their H. melpomene counterparts (Fig 5). Nonetheless, the H. erato transcripts were
clearly homologous to the non-repetitive N-termini of the
H. melpomene sequences. Second, there were only two unigenes in this H. erato group while the other groups contained around ten unigenes. Nonetheless, one of these
two unigenes, Her00048, was comprised of 35 ESTs and
was the third most abundant transcript sampled from that
library.
Sequences from these three groups of transcripts did
exhibit weak but significant similarity to sequences or
protein domains in public databases (determined via
BLAST and InterProScan). However, after inspecting these
results we concluded that these similarities did not reflect

true homology. Rather, these significant scores arose spuriously from matches to the repetitive motifs found in
these sequences. No similar sequences were found among
wing unigenes.
Accessory gland ESTs facilitate identifying reproductive
proteins
In insects, most work identifying seminal fluid proteins
has focused on two major criteria: enriched expression in
accessory glands and the presence of a computationally
predicted signal peptide [42,57]. Genes (and their
encoded proteins) meeting these two criteria are commonly called ACPs (accessory gland proteins) and early
work in Drosophila using western blots generally supported the assumption that these proteins are transferred
to females in seminal fluid [44,46,58]. More recent proteomic studies have broadly confirmed this assumption
but have also revealed that many genes encoding seminal
fluid proteins show significant expression outside of
accessory glands [43,45,47]. In light of this precedent, we
focused on the highly abundant tyrosine- and asparaginerich transcripts to demonstrate the utility of our ESTs for
identifying Heliconius ACPs and seminal fluid proteins.

The high abundance of these transcripts in the accessory
gland make them obvious candidates for being ACPs
encoding seminal fluid proteins. The presence of a signal
peptide in all groups meets one of the major criteria for
identifying insect ACPs. None of these sequences were
found among ESTs generated from developing wing tissue
in either species; this absence, contrasted with their abundance among accessory gland ESTs, provides support for
the criterion of accessory-gland biased expression. We further evaluated this criterion using reverse transcription
PCR (RT-PCR) to amplify these transcripts from male and
female abdomen and also male thorax. Species-specific
primers were designed to fall in regions of robust alignment between all members of each group so that tests of
tissue-specific patterns of expression were inclusive of all
transcripts and were therefore conservative. We used
primers designed for α-tubulin as a positive control. RTPCR results were similar for all three groups of transcripts
in both species: there was robust amplification from male
abdomen but weak or no amplification from male thorax
and female abdomen (Fig 6). In contrast, α-tubulin amplified robustly from all tissues. These three observations: 1)
the presence of a predicted signal peptide, 2) the discrepancy in EST abundance between wing and accessory gland
tissue, and 3) the tissue-specific patterns of expression, are
consistent with these transcripts being ACP genes and suggest they encode seminal fluid proteins.
We used shotgun peptide sequencing (2d-LC/MS) to
search for these candidate seminal fluid proteins in H.
erato spermatophores, the proteinaceous packet contain-

of highly abundant accessory gland transcripts and α-tubulin
were assayed in three males (abdomen and thorax) and three
females (abdomens only). PCR primers were designed to
amplify universally from all transcripts in each of the three
groups, two corresponding to tyrosine-rich proteins and one
to asparagine-rich proteins. First-strand cDNA synthesized
from equal concentrations of total RNA was used as template. For each primer set, equal amounts of PCR amplicon
(ranging between 4 and 9 μL) were electrophoresed on 1.2%
agarose gels. NC = negative control (no template added to

ing sperm and seminal fluid transferred from males to
females during copulation. In Heliconius, spermatophores
can be easily and cleanly dissected from freshly mated
females; we crushed the spermatophores in buffer, pelleted the remnants via centrifugation, and reserved the
supernatant for analysis. Tandem mass spectra generated
from this supernatant were searched against protein translations of the combined H. erato and H. melpomene accessory gland and wing unigenes. This search yielded a
significant match (p < .005) to the Tyrosine-Rich 1 group
of proteins from H. erato (Fig. 5), which includes the single most abundant transcript (168 ESTs) sampled from
the accessory glands. This result confirms that at least one
of the three groups of transcripts encodes a seminal fluid
protein. More generally, it demonstrates the utility of
these accessory gland ESTs as a resource for identifying
seminal fluid proteins in Heliconius butterflies.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of similarity to other
known sequences it is difficult to predict the molecular
function of the Tyrosine-Rich 1 group of proteins or the
two others which were not detected in the 2d-LC/MS
experiment. However, we note the similarity between our
results and other studies in crickets reporting abundant,
hyper-variable, repetitive, secreted proteins with accessory
gland biased expression and which were present in the
spermatophore [36,41,43]. These authors speculate that
the abundance and repetitive nature of these proteins suggest they are structural components of the spermatophore,

Page 8 of 13

which are generally known to be encoded by male insect
accessory glands [41,48]. Although the tyrosine- and
asparagine- rich Heliconius proteins do not appear to be
homologous to the cricket proteins or another spermatophore protein reported in beetles [59,60], if these Heliconius proteins are structural components of the
spermatophore it offers a possible explanation for the failure to detect the two additional groups in our proteomic
assay. These proteins are unlikely to be water-soluble and
the centrifugation step could have removed most of the
spermatophore's structural components from the supernatant which was analyzed. Future work on the biochemical properties and structure of these three proteins will be
informative in this matter, as will precisely specifying
where in the spermatophore the Tyrosine-Rich 1 proteins
are located. Alternately, it may be that the two undetected
proteins are not present in the spermatophore and are not
seminal fluid proteins, in which case useful biological
insights will likely arise from investigating this functional
difference between otherwise similar proteins. Either way,
this combined approach using focused EST sequencing, in
silico and in vitro expression assays, and proteomic analyses has successfully identified novel and noteworthy Heliconius proteins for future research.

Conclusion
We report the successful sequencing of 936 ESTs, corresponding to 371 unigenes, and 1033 ESTs, corresponding
to 340 unigenes, from the male accessory glands of H.
erato and H. melpomene, respectively. Overall the results
from the two species were very similar; our analyses did
not reveal any obvious patterns that might reflect differences between the pupal and adult mating system.
Approximately one-third of these unigenes showed no
significant BLAST similarity to sequences in GenBank's
non-redundant databases, indicating that a large proportion of novel genes are expressed in Heliconius male accessory glands. In both species only a third of accessory gland
unigenes were also found among unigenes derived from
wing tissue. About 25% of unigenes from both species
encode secreted proteins. This includes three distinct
groups of unigenes which consist of a few highly abundant transcripts and several less-abundant related transcripts, all differentiated by extensive indel variation.
Patterns of tissue-specific expression suggest that they are
ACPs; proteomic analysis confirmed the presence of proteins from one of these groups in the spermatophore.
These EST sequences lay the foundation for future
research investigating the patterns and processes of molecular evolution among reproductive proteins in Heliconius
butterflies. In particular, the striking dichotomy in mating
systems offers a promising opportunity to explore the role
of post-mating sexual selection in contributing to the
rapid evolution of reproductive proteins. More generally,

Heliconius butterflies are a remarkable system for investigating patterns of genetic diversity in the context of wellcharacterized ecological and phenotypic diversity. The
two species studied here are also the focal taxa for research
examining the genetic basis of wing pattern diversity in
Heliconius. Our results comprise the first major expansion
of genomic-scale research into other aspects of Heliconius
biology. They therefore mark a significant advance in the
development of these species, and the Heliconius genus, as
model systems for connecting various aspects of genomic,
phenotypic, and ecological diversity.

Methods
RNA isolation and cDNA library construction
Male accessory glands were dissected from 11 adult male
Heliconius erato petiverana (from stocks maintained at the
University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras) and 10 adult male
Heliconius melpomene rosina (from stocks maintained at
the University of Texas, Austin). Tissue samples were
placed immediately in TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and homogenized. These and other subsequent total RNA extractions were done using TRIZOL and
following the manufacturer's protocol.

Two directional cDNA libraries were constructed, one for
each species, using the Creator SMART cDNA library kit
(Clontech BD Bioscience, Mountain View, CA). Briefly,
first-strand cDNA was reverse transcribed from 1.2 μg (H.
erato) and .7 μg (H. melpomene) total RNA. Second-strand
synthesis and amplification of cDNA pools for library
construction were accomplished via Long Distance-PCR
using the following cycling program: 1 min denaturation
at 95°, 20 cycles of 30 sec at 95° then 6 min at 68°, and a
final extension step of 6 min at 68°. Primers provided by
the manufacturer were used for these reactions.
Seventy-five μL of the PCR-amplified cDNA were cleaned
with Qiaquick PCR clean-up kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
and digested with SfiI. Digested cDNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% TBE agarose gels and size-selected for
transcripts >800 bp in length by gel extraction using a
Qiaquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The
size-selected cDNA was ligated into the pDNR-LIB vector
and used to transform electromax DH5α E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) via electroporation with 2.5 kV/
cm, 200 ohms, and 25 μF. Recombinant colonies were
grown on chloramphenicol-selective LB agar medium.
The H. erato and H. melpomene libraries contained 7 × 106
and 1.3 × 105 cfus respectively.
Library screening and EST sequencing
To enrich for transcripts expressed primarily in male tissue, both libraries were screened with cDNA generated
from female abdominal tissue and only non-hybridizing
clones were sequenced. Aliquots were plated at low den-

sity on chloramphenicol-selective LB agar medium and
grown overnight at 37°. Colony lifts were made on
Hybond XL membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Cells were lysed and DNA was fixed to the membrane by dry-cycle autoclaving at 250° (5 min sterilize, 5
min dry) followed by baking at 80° for two hours.
The probe for screening was generated from total RNA isolated from a single female abdomen. Four μg total RNA
were used in a first-strand reverse transcription and subsequent second-strand synthesis/PCR amplification following the method of Chenchik et al. [61]. Approximately 50
ng amplified cDNA was labeled with 32-P dCTP using the
RADprime labeling kit (BioRad).
Before hybridization, membranes were soaked in 2× SSC
solution and then incubated for 2 hours at 65° in hybridization buffer (0.5% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS, 0.5 M
sodium phosphate). After 2 hours of pre-hybridization
the radio-labeled female cDNA was added to the buffer
and incubation continued overnight at 65°. Following
hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 20 min
with 1× SSC/0.5% SDS at 65°, rinsed twice with 2× SSC at
room temperature, dried, and imaged with x-ray film
using a 5-day exposure.
In addition to screening with female cDNA, the H. melpomene library was simultaneously screened for four
highly abundant transcripts and the stuffer fragment from
the pDNR vector. The four highly abundant transcripts
were identified by random sequencing of 356 clones
before any hybridization screen. PCR primers were
designed to amplify a portion of these 5 templates and 5
ng of amplicon from each, purified with a Qiaquick PCR
clean-up kit, were combined and labeled with P32-dCTP
using the RADprime labeling kit (BioRad). This probe was
added to the hybridization buffer at the same time as the
probe generated from female cDNA. See Additional file 6
for primer details.
Clones which failed to hybridize were manually picked
into 50 μL 5 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and lysed by heating at 99°
for 5 min. One μL of this "boil prep" was used as template
in a 10 μL PCR reaction using m13 primers (Clontech),
platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
the following cycling program: initial denaturation of 95°
(2 min), 35 cycles of 95° (50 sec) then 52° (1 min) then
72° (1 min), and a final extension of 72° (4 min). PCR
amplified inserts were enzymatically cleaned with
EXOSAP and single-pass sequenced from the 5' end using
the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing chemistry and a vector specific primer, SeqPrim3 (Additional
file 6). Sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI
3730 automated sequencer.

EST analysis
EST data analysis was automated using the PartiGene suite
of bioinformatic software [55]. Raw sequences were
trimmed of vector sequence, low-quality base calls, and
poly-A tails (cutoff of 12 contiguous A's). Trimmed
sequences >100 bp in length were clustered into putative
unique gene objects (unigenes). Consensus sequences
from each unigene were annotated via BLAST searches to
public databases (e.g. GenBank, SwissProt). Local BLAST
databases were also used for all-vs-all BLAST searches to
identify related sequences within and between libraries.
Unigenes from wing tissues were downloaded from ButterflyBase [27]. All BLAST searches were performed using
the parallel-BLAST server hosted by the Cornell University
computational biology service unit (cbsuapps.tc.cornell.edu). BLAST results were organized and analyzed
using relational databases developed in Microsoft Access
(Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). We screened the unigenes for nine Heliconius repetitive elements using the
RepeatMasker software [52,56].

Putative open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and
translated using the PartiGene suite's application
prot4EST [62]. Prot4EST utilizes several different methods
for ORF prediction, including a hidden Markov model
(HMM) approach implemented in ESTScan, which
requires a large training set of complete coding sequences
[63]. At the time of analysis, a dataset of this type was not
publicly available for any Lepidopteran species, so a 'simulated transcriptome' was generated for HMM training (J.
Wasmuth, Personal Communication) [64,64]. First,
codon usage statistics were estimated from pooled wing
and accessory gland Heliconius erato unigenes for which
coding sequences could be reliably identified via BLAST.
Next, a 'simulated transcriptome' was generated by
reverse-translating the D. melanogaster proteome using
codon usage statistics estimated for Heliconius erato. The
resulting data set was then submitted as a training set for
ESTScan.
About one third of automatically predicted ORFs were
manually inspected and, if necessary, edited using the
Aligner (CodonCode Corp., Dedham, MA) or BioEdit
[65] software packages. These unigenes received this extra
attention either due to their inclusion in the set of
orthologs for evolutionary analysis or their correspondance to the highly abundant tyrosine and asparagine rich
proteins (see Results and Discussion for further information). For these unigenes, automated ORF predictions
were replaced with manually edited versions for Gene
Ontology annotations.
Where possible, Gene Ontology (GO) classifications were
assigned to each protein translation based on BLASTX (E-

value<10-5) similarity to entries in a GO-annotated database (UNIPROT). GO annotations were summarized
using 'GO-Slim' terms [54]. This process was automated
using the Annot8r application in the PartiGene package
[55]. Secretory signal sequence peptides were predicted
with the SignalP software [53,66].
Patterns of tissue specific expression
We examined patterns of tissue-specific expression for a
few unigenes of particular interest. Differences in expression were assayed via RT-PCR from three different tissues:
male abdomen, male thorax, and female abdomen. PCR
primers were designed within the predicted ORF of each
unigene assayed (see Additional file 6 for primer details).
Primers were designed with the Primer3 software [67]; see
additonal file 6 for primer sequences. Total RNA was isolated from three adult male and female butterflies. A
standard concentration of total RNA from each of these
RNA extractions (H. erato, 1 μg; H. melpomene, 0.5 μg) was
treated with DNase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse
transcribed into single stranded cDNA using poly-T primers, SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and
following the manufacturer's protocol. One μL of a 3-fold
dilution of this cDNA was used as template in a 20 μL
touch-down PCR with the following cycling parameters:
initial denaturation of 95°C (2 min), 12 cycles of 95°C
(30 sec) then 65-53°C (30 sec, decreasing one degree per
cycle) then 72°C (2 min), 23 cycles of 95°C (30 sec) then
53°C (30 sec) then 72°C (2 min), and a final extension of
72°C (4 min). For each set of primers an equal amount of
PCR amplicon (between 4 and 9 μL) from each of the nine
templates was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV
light.
Spermatophore collections and proteomic analysis
H. erato individuals used in this experiment were taken
from breeding stocks maintained at the Niagara Butterfly
Conservatory, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Matings
were performed in a 3 m × 3 m × 3 m screen cage inside a
green house. Females recently emerged from their chrysalis were placed in the cage with several males taken from
larger rearing populations. The cage was checked for coupled pairs approximately every 30 min. Coupled butterflies were placed in individual plastic boxes until they
separated. Afterwards males were discarded and the spermatophore was immediately dissected out of the female's
bursa copulatrix. Dissections were performed in ice-cold
insect Ringer's solution. A total of 12 spermatophores
were homogenized in a single microfuge tube containing
75 μL cold Phosphate Buffered Saline solution and centrifuged at 4°C for 15 minutes at 13,000 rpm. The resulting
supernatant was stored at -80°C and sent to the Genome
BC Proteomics Centre (University of Victoria, Canada) for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/592

two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem massspectrometry (2d LC/MS) proteomic analysis. We describe
this experiment only briefly here; complete details are
provided in additional file 7. Initial separation of the spermatophore protein sample was performed with strong
cation exchange (SCX) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These SCX fractions were then analyzed
on a Hybrid Quadrupole-TOF LC/MS/MS Mass Spectrometer (QStar Pulsar I, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
with data acquired automatically using the Analyst QS 1.0
software (ABI MDS SCIEX, Concord, Canada). The resulting spectra were searched using the MASCOT 2.0 software
(Matrix Science, Boston, MA) against a protein database
generated from Heliconius unigene sequences. The protein
database, created using custom Perl scripts, consisted of
all ORFs ≥ 10 amino acids long from all three forward
reading frames from the combined H. erato and H. melpomene accessory gland and wing unigenes. It contained
approximately 180,000 protein sequences derived from
Heliconius unigenes as well as likely contaminants: pig
trypsin and human keratin.
