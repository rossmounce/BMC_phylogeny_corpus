Abstract
Background: High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) have been considered as
most important seed storage proteins for wheat flour quality. 1Ay subunits are of great interest
because they are always silent in common wheat. The presence of expressed 1Ay subunits in
diploid and tetraploid wheat genotypes makes it possible to investigate molecular information of
active 1Ay genes.
Results: We identified 1Ay subunits with different electrophoretic mobility from 141 accessions
of diploid and tetraploid wheats, and obtained the complete ORFs and 5' flanking sequences of 1Ay
genes including 6 active and 3 inactive ones. Furthermore, the 5' flanking sequences were
characterized from 23 wild diploid species of Triticeae. All 6 active 1Ay possess a typical HMW-GS
primary structure and some novel characteristics. The conserved cysteine residue within the
repetitive domain of y-type subunits was replaced by phenylalanine residue in subunits of 1Ay (Tue1), 1Ay (Tu-e2), 1Ay (Ta-e2) and 1Ay (Td-e). Particularly, 1Ay (Ta-e3) has an unusual large
molecular weight of 2202 bp and was one of the known largest y-type HMW-GSs. The translations
of 1Ay (Tu-s), 1Ay (Ta-s) and 1Ay (Td-s) were disrupted by premature stop codons in their coding
regions. The 5' flanking sequences of active and inactive 1Ay genes differ in a few base substitutions
and insertions or deletions. The 85 bp deletions have been found in promoter regions of all 1Ay
genes and the corresponding positions of 6 species from Aegilops and Hordeum.
Conclusion: The possession of larger molecular weight and fewer conserved cysteine residues are
unique structural features of 1Ay genes; it would be interested to express them in bread wheat and
further to examine their impact to processing quality of wheat. The 1Ay genes from T. urartu are
closer to the genes from T. turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum, than those from T. monococcum
aegilopoides. The 85 bp deletion and some variations in the 5'flanking region, have not interrupted
expression of 1Ay genes, whereas the defects in the coding regions could be responsible to the
silence of the 1Ay genes. Some mutational events in more distant distal promoter regions are also
possible causes for the inactivation of 1Ay genes.

Background
In wheat and its relatives, seed storage proteins are mainly
composed of glutenins and gliadins [1]. High-molecularweight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are important storage proteins in endosperm of wheat and its related species
[1]. HMW-GSs play a key role in determining wheat gluten and dough elasticity which promote the formation of
the larger glutenin polymer [2,3]. The allelic variation in
HMW-GS compositions has been reported to account for
up to 70% of the variation in bread making quality among
European wheats, even though they only account for
about 10% of seed storage proteins [2,4]. Therefore,
HMW-GS genes are important and useful in molecular
modification to improve the wheat grain quality.
HMW-GSs are encoded by the Glu-1 loci on the long arms of
chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D, and each locus consists of 2
tightly linked genes encoding an x-type and a y-type subunit,
respectively. Theoretically, hexaploid wheat could contain 6
different HMW-GSs, however, gene silence resulted in variation of HMW-GS number: from 3 to 5 subunits in hexaploid
bread wheat and from 1 to 3 subunits in durum wheat [5,6].
Among all 6 HMW-GSs, 1Dx, 1Dy and 1Bx are always active,
and 1Ax and 1By sometimes appear silent. In hexaploid
wheat, the gene encoding 1Ay subunit is always silent. However, 1Ay subunits have been reported in some diploid and
tetraploid wheats [7]. Although the expressed 1Ay subunits
in 2 accessions of wheat have been reported [8,9], such subunits have never been confirmed by further molecular characterization. To date, more than 20 HMW-GS alleles have
been isolated from wheat and its related species [10-30], and
these information has greatly improved our understanding
in structure, heredity and expression of HMW-GSs. However,
our knowledge on 1Ay genes is still deficient. The expression
of 1Ay subunits in some wild diploid and tetraploid wheats
offers an opportunity to isolate and analyze nucleotide
sequences of active HMW glutenin 1Ay genes [7,19,31,32].
Triticum urartu (AA, 2n = 14), Triticum monococcum aegilopoides (AA, 2n = 14) and Triticum turgidum dicoccon (AABB,
2n = 28) are important species possibly involved in the evolution process of hexaploid wheat. These species possess
many excellent characteristics such as high content of seed
protein and high resistance to stripe rust, scab and stress,
which could be potentially employed to improve the agronomic traits of common wheat [33].
In this study, we reported the identification of expressed
1Ay subunits from total 141 accessions of T. urartu, T.
monococcum aegilopoides and T. turgidum dicoccon, and the
characterization of the coding and promoter region
sequences of 6 active and 3 inactive 1Ay genes. To further
understand the control of this allele expression, we also
characterized the 5' flanking sequences of y-type HMWGS genes from 23 wild diploid species of Triticeae. The
objectives of this study are: 1) to compare promoter and
coding region structures of active and inactive 1Ay alleles,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/16

and further to understand the control of 1Ay gene expression; 2) to compare the primary structure of 1Ay subunits
with other known HMW-GSs and analysis the evolution
of Glu-A1-2 alleles; 3) to provide the basis of the genetic
transformation of active 1Ay gene to verify their effect on
wheat processing quality.

Results
SDS-PAGE profiles of HMW-GSs
The SDS-PAGE profiles of HMW-GSs showed that 1Ay subunits were differentially expressed in T. urartu, T. monococcum aegilopoides and T. turgidum dicoccon, whereas 1Ax
subunits were expressed in all accessions of these 3 species
(Figure 1). In T. urartu and T. turgidum dicoccon, 1Ay subunits displayed an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of
1Dy12 subunit. 1Ay subunits from T. monococcum aegilopoides migrated slower than those of T. urartu, showing a
similar electrophoretic mobility with 1By8. Interestingly,
1Ay subunit in one accession (PI306526) of T. monococcum
aegilopoides migrated slower than all y-type subunits and
1Bx7. To our knowledge, the y-type HMW-GS with such
slower electrophoretic mobility has never been reported,
indicating that this subunit might possess a molecular mass
larger than other y-type subunits. We also found that for the
expression frequency of 1Ay subunits, diploid wheats are
higher than tetraploid wheats (Additional file 1).
Characterization of 1Ay coding sequences from diploid
and tetraploid wheats
In genomic PCR, there is only one amplified fragment in
each of T.urartu and T.monococcum aegilopoides, whereas 4
fragments were amplified in 2 T.turgidum dicoccon accessions. The amplified fragments in T. urartu and T.monococcum aegilopoides ranged from1800 to 2202 bp (Figure 2).
It is close to the size of those typical y-type HMW-GS
genes except for the fragment of 2202 bp. In T.turgidum
dicoccon accessions, the molecular weight of fragments is
between 1.8 and 2.5 kb (Figure 2). All amplified products
were cloned. By terminal sequencing and enzyme digestions, the ORFs representing different 1Ay alleles were
determined. The full length sequences of 1Ay ORFs were
obtained by using the method of nested deletion. The 9
sequences were named as 1Ay (Tu-e1), 1Ay (Tu-e2) and
1Ay (Tu-s) to represent the ORFs of 1Ay subunits from T.
urartu;1Ay (Ta-e1), 1Ay (Ta-e2), 1Ay (Ta-e3) and 1Ay (Tas) to represent the ORFs of 1Ay subunits from T. monococcum aegilopoides; and 1Ay (Td-e) and 1Ay (Td-s) to represent the ORFs of 1Ay subunits from T.turgidum dicoccon
(the letter e and s represent the expressed and silenced
subunits, the numbers represent different alleles.). All
sequences were deposited in NCBI database with Genbank accession numbers from:EU984503 to EU984511.

of amino acid sequence indicated that the ORFs of 6 active

expressed in some accessions of T. urartu, T. monococcum aegilopoides and T. turgidum dicoccon while 1Ax subunits were
expressed in all accessions (marked by tailed-arrows). The expressed 1Ay subunits were marked by solid and the hollow
arrows indicated the area where the absent subunit band might have been.

1Ay genes possess a typical primary structure shared by
other published HMW-GSs, although these subunits differ greatly in sizes (Figure 3 and Table 1). Each of these
deduced subunits consists of a signal peptide with 21
amino acids (aa), a conserved N-terminal region, a central
repetitive domain and a C-terminal region. The N-terminal regions of these 6 subunits contain 104 aa and the Cterminal regions have 42 aa. Central repetitive domains of

these subunits are composed of a similar repeat structure
to other known y-type subunits. The subunit 1Ay (Ta-e3)
is composed of 732 aa, larger than all other known y-type
HMW-GSs. The difference between 1Ay (Ta-e3) and other
y-type HMW-GSs were entirely due to variations of the
number of repeat motifs. Compared to other 1Ay subunits, 13 extra hexapeptides and 5 extra nonapeptides have
been inserted into the repetitive domain of 1Ay (Ta-e3),
which resulted in 123 aa increases in its molecular mass.
All conserved cysteine residues presented in known
HMW-GSs from wheat and its relative grasses were
observed in the aa sequences of 1Ay (Ta-e1) and 1Ay (Tae3). For 1Ay (Ta-e1) and 1Ay (Ta-e3), the distributions of
the 7 cysteine residues are conserved with 5 in N-terminal
region, 1 at the end of central repetitive domain and 1 in
C-terminal region. However, the conserved cysteine residues at the end of the central repetitive domain of 1Ay
(Tu-e1), 1Ay (Tu-e2), 1Ay (Ta-e2) and 1Ay (Td-e) was
replaced by phenylalanine residues (Figure 3, Table 1).
The translation of the sequence of 1Ay (Tu-s), 1Ay (Ta-s)
and 1Ay (Td-s) were disrupted by in-frame premature stop
codons (Figure 3). In the coding sequences of 1Ay (Tu-s)
and 1Ay (Ta-s), there is 1 stop codon located in the N-terminal and C-terminal region, respectively; and 4 stop
codons were located in the repetitive domain of 1Ay (Tds). If the premature stop codons were ignored, the resulted

All y-type HMW-GS genes of hexaploid wheat have a conserved cysteine residue at the end of repetitive domain. However, this cysteine residue
was found not always present in wild wheats.

peptides of 1Ay (Tu-s), 1Ay (Ta-s) and 1Ay (Td-s) would
also have typical characteristics of HMW-GSs.
Structural features of the 5' flanking promoter regions of
Glu-A1-2 alleles and those in 23 Triticeae species
The 5' flanking promoter regions of both active and inactive 1Ay from diploid and tetraploid wheat species were
amplified using the primers P3 and P4. In previous study,
regulatory elements (TATA box, complete HMW
enhancer, partial HMW enhancer, E motif and N motif)
have been identified in the study of promoter activity in
wheat endosperm [34,35]. D'Ovidio (1996) previously
reported the sequence locations of 5' flanking promoter
regions of 1Ay alleles in T. urartu to the positions of -595
bp upstream of translational start codon. In this study, we
extended the sequences to the positions -845 bp to cover
all recognized elements mentioned above. It's more scientific to carry out the promoter comparison using the
sequences including all recognized elements. Although
comparative analysis of promoter could not directly
decide difference in function, it would useful in identification of regulatory elements variations which are relevant
to gene function and evolution.

All characterized promoter regions of 1Ay were aligned to
the homologous regions of 1Ay (Cheyenne) (from common wheat cv. Cheyenne), 1By9 and 1Dy10. The 5' flanking promoter regions of both inactive and active 1Ay from
T.urartu, T.monococcum aegilopoides, T.turgidum dicoccon
and T. aestivum were compared. A few base substitutions
and insertions or deletions were found even though the
alignment showed high similarity (Figure 4). The N motif,
E motif, complete enhancer and TATA box were well conserved in all compared alleles. An 85 bp deletion, in
which the partial HMW enhancer was also included, was
observed in the 5' flanking promoter regions of all 1Ay
genes from diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats
when compared to 1By9 and 1Dy10 (Figure 4). Our inves-

tigation in the region extended to -845 bp did not find any
obvious basis for differential expression. The y-type
HMW-GS promoter regions are conserved out to -1200 bp
even though some of these genes diverged 4–5 million
years ago and the non-coding sequences of wheat diverge
fast. Some potential regulatory elements might be in the 845 to -1200 bp region.
In order to further understand the control of HMW-GS
1Ay gene expression, we also characterized the corresponding 5' flanking regions from 23 diploid species of
Triticeae. The length of entire 5' flanking regions in 23
Triticeae species varied from 845 to 915 bp (GenBank:
EU4233–EU4242, EU4245–EU4257). Multiple sequence
alignment showed the 5' flanking of 23 Triticeae species
regions were conserved but have more variations than
those of Glu-A1-2 alleles (Additional file 2). A few substitutions were found in the elements of E motif, N motif,
Partial enhancer and Enhancer. Interestingly, the 85 bp
deletion was also found in the corresponding regions of ytype HMW-GS and D-hordein genes from six diploid species of Aegilops umbellulata (U), Ae. uniaristata (N), Hordeum bogdanii (H), H. brevisubulatum (H), H. bulbosum (I)
and H. spontareaum (H) (Figure 5).
Evolutionary analyses of Glu-A1-2 alleles
The phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate
the evolutionary relationships among the alleles encoded
by Glu-A1-2, Glu-B1-2 and Glu-D1-2 (Figure 6). The 5'
flanking sequences plus the sequences encoding the signal
peptides and N-terminal domain were chosen to construct the phylogenetic tree under several principles for
the sequence selections [36]. Firstly, we found that the
regulatory elements that control the tissue specificity and
expression level of different HMW-GS genes are well conserved in HMW-GS alleles from 23 diploid species. Secondly, the sequences encoding signal peptides and Nterminal domain are also relative conserved. Therefore,

high conservation with enough variations suggested these
HMW-GS sequences are phylogenetically informative.
The resulted phylogenetic tree was divided into 2 clusters,
comprising the Glu-A1-2 alleles at the top and the alleles
of Glu-B1-2 and Glu-D1-2 at the bottom. In the cluster of
Glu-A1-2 alleles, 1Ay genes from each species were clustered together, respectively. The 1Ay genes have been further divided into 3 clusters. 1Ay (Tu-e1), 1Ay (Tu-e2), 1Ay
(Tu-s), 1Ay (Td-e), 1Ay (Td-s) and 1Ay (Cheyenne) were
included one groupe showing close relationship; the
genes in this group are from T. urartu, T.turgidum dicoccon
and T. aestivum respectively. Three genes, 1Ay (Ta-e1), 1Ay
(Ta-e2) and 1Ay (Ta-s) from T. monococcum aegilopoides,
were clustered together while 1Ay (Ta-e3) was put outside
of this cluster. In spite all 1Ay alleles from different wheats
show a close relationship, we noted 1Ay genes from T.
urartu, T.turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum which were
important species involved in wheat evolution, were
tightly clustered together in one group; however the 1Ay
genes from T. monococcum aegilopoides exhibited a more
distant relationship to the genes of this group. And this
group is supported by high bootstrap values, indicating
that strong statistic support for the close relationship of
the Glu-A1-2 alleles from T. urartu, T.turgidum dicoccon and
T. aestivum.

Discussion
The HMW-GS 1Ay subunits are special because they are
always silent in hexaploid wheat. Relative fewer researches
have been conducted on this allele when compared to
other loci of Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 [20,32,37]. These informations are not sufficient to understand the expression
and heredity of 1Ay subunits. Our investigations on 1Ay
alleles with differential expressions would be useful to
enhance our knowledge on Glu-A1-2 alleles. In genomic

PCR, the high fidelity polymerase was used to ensure that
the amplified fragments are the accurate representative of
interest genes. To avoid potential mistakes introduced by
amplification and sequencing, each nucleotide sequence
of coding and 5' flanking promoter was determined by
using sequencing results of multiple independent clones.
Therefore, the molecular information we generated for
1Ay genes is reliable and effective for exploring structural
differentiation and evolution of Glu-A1 alleles.
The structure variations and evolution of Glu-A1-2 alleles
Previous genetic researches suggested that there are two
tightly linked HMW-GS genes for each genome of wheat
and its wild relatives. However, we have only amplified
one band representing y-type HMW-GS genes in genomic
PCR of T.urartu and T.monococcum aegilopoides. Bai et al
[32] reported their PCR amplification for HMW-GS ORFs
could not obtain x-type genes either. Liu et al. have shown
the similar results in the cloning of HMW-GS genes from
decaploid Agropyron elongatum [30]. Only 15 of 20 genes
can be isolated; the rest of 5 x-type ones can not be
obtained, and they proposed that the failure in amplification was possibly due to the x-type genes were less conserved or polymeric than y-type ones. In addition, either
deletion of sequences/genes or transposon insertions can
also prevent the amplification of interest fragments.
Therefore, sequence polymorphisms, deletion or transposon insertions may be the reason why we could not obtain
the other fragment for x-type amplicon in diploid wheats.

The possession of larger molecular mass and fewer conserved cysteine residues are unique characteristics of 1Ay
subunits tested in this study. 1Ay subunits differs from
each other and those of known HMW subunits by substitutions, insertions or/and deletions involving single or
more amino acid residues (Figure 3). The repetitive

domains of 1Ay subunits possess most variations, whereas
the N- and C-terminal are relatively conserved only with
some substitutions of single amino acid. With a larger
molecular weight than other y-type subunits, 1Ay (Ta-e3)
is one of the known largest y-type HMW-GS genes. The
unusual large size of 1Ay (Ta-e3) is mainly due to the
insertions of repeat units in central repetitive region. Belton [38] and Feeney et al. [39] proposed a model in which
the gluten polymers interact via inter-chain hydrogen
bonds between the subunit repetitive domains, and more
stable interactions can be formed with longer subunits.
The positive relationship between the size of HMW-GSs
and their effect on dough strength has been reported [40].
The 1Ay (Ta-e3) is longer than other y-type subunits, so
we predicted it may have a potential ability to strengthen
the gluten polymer interactions.
The y-type HMW-GSs (i.e., Glu-B1-2 and Glu-D1-2
encoded subunits) in hexaploid wheat have a cysteine residue at the end of repetitive domain. We found that this
cysteine residue is not always present in wild wheats. This
cysteine residue is replaced by phenylalanine since whose
codons, TTT or TTC can be easily converted from cysteine
codons TGT or TGC. The number and distribution of
cysteine residues in HMW subunit proteins are relevant to

their ability to form high molecular polymers stabilized
by inter-chain disulphide bonds [41]. In previous report,
the substitutions of two cysteine residues in the N-terminal of subunit 1Bx20 resulted in its negative effect on
dough strength [42]. This type of cysteine composition in
1Ay subunits has never been reported before our study, it
is unknown what would be the effect of the cysteine substitution within repetitive domain to their high order
structures. It would be important to express 1Ay subunits
in bread wheat to verify their impact to flour quality. In
addition, to expressing 1Ay subunit in bread wheat cultivar with 5 native expressed subunits to construct novel
transgenic plants which allowed express all 6 x- and y-type
HMW-GSs would be considerable interesting.
Because relatively fewer Glu-A1y alleles were identified
and characterized, the evolution of these alleles has never
been reported. Prior to our study, the molecular information on gene structure of Glu-A1-2 alleles was only available for 1Ay from T. urartu and T.timopheevi [19,32]. In this
study, we are able to investigate the evolution of these
alleles based on the identification of novel 1Ay alleles
from more diploid and tetraploid wheats. The close relationship between 1Ay from T. urartu and those from T.turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum is supported by

phylogenetic analysis and comparison of amino acid
sequences; while the 1Ay genes from T. monococcum aegilopoides have a little more distant relationship to those of
T.turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum (Figure 3 and 6). For
the close relationship of these alleles, it may be explained
that T. urartu is generally accepted donor specie of A
genome of T.turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum [43,44].
The evolution of new allelic subunit can be formed
through the variations of number and distribution of
cysteine residues [36]. For example, the good quality subunit 1Dx5 is a novel subunit with an extra cysteine residue
in the repetitive domain [3]. In our finding, the conserved
cysteine residue at the end of the repetitive domain were
all replaced in 1Ay subunits from T. urartu, T.turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum while this cysteine residue is still in
1Ay subunits of T. monococcum aegilopoides. We suppose
that the substitution of this cysteine residue could be relevant to the evolution of Glu-A1-2 alleles. The difference
in cysteine residue together with results of phylogenetic
analysis and protein sequence comparison further supported that 1Ay genes from T. urartu, T. turgidum dicoccon
and T. aestivum are closed, but differed from those of T.
monococcum aegilopoides.
Gene silencing in Glu-A1-2
We focused on both promoter and coding regions to
understand the silence of 1Ay alleles. The development of
the primers specific for the 5'flanking promoters of 1Ay
genes made it possible to extend these sequences to cover
all recognized elements and compare them. Our investigations in the extended 5' flanking promoter sequences
identified a few base substitutions and insertions or deletions among 1Ay alleles with differential expressions.
Because these substitutions and insertions or deletions are
not specific to active or inactive 1Ay genes, the correlation
between these variations and expression of 1Ay genes has
not been supported.

The deleted fragment of 85 bp contained partial HMW
enhancer which is a partial copy of complete HMW
enhancer. Halford et al. proposed that the 85 bp deletion
was responsible for the silencing of 1Ay gene [45],
whereas Colot et al. reported later that the corresponding
fragment of 1Dy12 was not essential for gene regulation
[46]. Prior to our study, it has been observed only in the
5' flanking regions of 1Ay alleles from T. urartu, cv. Cheyenne and cv. Chinese spring [13,37,45]. In this study, the
85 bp deletion was also found in the corresponding
regions of all 1Ay genes from T. monococcum aegilopoides
and T. turgidum dicoccon (Figure 4). Further examinations
in the 5' flanking sequences of Glu-1-2 alleles from 23
wild diploid wheat species revealed that the 85 bp fragment deletion was also present in 6 species of Aegilops and
Hordeum. Therefore, the 85 bp deletion is not specific for
inactive 1Ay genes. Anderson et al. and Li et al. reported

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/16

there was a 185 bp insertion in the 5' flanking regions of
1Bx7 and 1Bx14 when compared to 1Bx17 and 1Bx20
[36,47]. They concluded that this insertion has not disrupted the expression of 1Bx14 and 1Bx20. Because the
1Bx gene of cv. Chinese spring has apparently higher
expression than the allelic of cv. Cheyenne 1Bx gene, the
relationship of the 1Bx promoter cereal box duplication to
protein synthesis levels was examined. Since both 1Bx
genes contain the same duplication in the promoter, the
relationship between different levels of hexaploid 1Bx
genes and the duplication of regulatory elements is not
supported [47]. These finding further supported the 85 bp
deletion has not disrupted the control of 1Ay gene expression and is obviously not responsible for the silencing of
1Ay genes in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats.
Three silenced genes of 1Ay (Tu-s), 1Ay (Ta-s), 1Ay (Td-s)
characterized in this study together with 1Ay (Cheyenne),
showed that their translations were disrupted by the inframe premature stop codons. It indicated that they were
highly unlikely to be expressed as a full length protein. In
fact, such information is consistent with our SDS-PAGE
results. However, the silencing of 1Ay gene in cv. Chinese
spring is accompanied by the insertion of an 8 kb transposon-like in its coding region [48]. The defects in the coding regions (premature stop codons and insertion of large
transposon-like elements) would be possibly responsible
for the silencing of the 1Ay genes in diploid, tetraploid
and hexaploid wheats (Table 2). However, the mechanisms of gene expression and silencing are complicated
and could involve the interactions of a number of factors,
including specific nucleotide sequencing, chromosome
rearrangement, and methylation, etc. Some mutational
events in more distant distal promoter regions are possible causes for the inactivation of 1Ay genes; and more distal sequences are necessary to be examined. In addition,
the experiments of 1Ay promoter function in wheat are
required to further study the mechanism of the silencing
of Glu-A1-2 alleles.

Conclusion
The possession of larger molecular mass and fewer conserved cysteine residues are unique characteristics of 1Ay
subunits tested in this study. Particularly, 1Ay (Ta-e3) with
an unusual large size, is one of known largest y-type HMWGS gene and may contribute more to the gluten polymers
than other known y-type subunits. It is also interested in
observing that the conserved cysteine residue within the
repetitive domain of the y-type genes of hexaploid wheat is
not always present in wild wheats. The 1Ay genes from T.
urartu have a closer relationship among, T.turgidum dicoccon
and T. aestivum than those from T.monococcum aegilopoides.
The 85 bp deletions are present not only in the promoter
regions of Glu-A1-2 alleles with different expressions but
also in the corresponding positions of 6 species of Aegilops
and Hordeum. The 85 bp deletion and some variations in

Both active and inactive 1Ay genes from T. urartu, T. monococcum aegilopoides, T. turgidum dicoccon and T. aestivum shared high homology promoter
sequences including 85 bp deletions. Nevertheless, the defects (premature stop codons and transposon-like insertion) were found in the coding
regions of all silenced 1Ay genes.

the 5'flanking region, have not interrupted expression of
1Ay genes, whereas the defects in the coding regions (premature stop codons and insertion of large transposon-like
element) would be possibly responsible to the silencing of
1Ay genes. Some mutational events in more distant distal
promoter regions might also be the possible cause of the
inactivation of 1Ay gene.

Methods
Plant materials
One hundred and forty-one accessions of T.urartu, T. monococcum aegilopoides, T. monococcum monococcum and T. turgidum dicoccon were used in SDS-PAGE analysis. All accessions
were kindly provided by USDA-ARS http://www.arsgrin.gov. Fifty-three accessions with expressed 1Ay subunits
were screened out from 141 accessions, and 6 accessions
with expressed 1Ay subunit plus 3 ones without 1Ay subunit
were chosen for cloning experiments (Table 3).
SDS-PAGE
HMW-GSs of T. urartu, T. monococcum aegilopoides and
T.turgidum dicoccon were extracted from single half seed
according to Mackie et al [49]. SDS-PAGE was conducted
as described in Wan et al. [19]. HMW-GSs from hexaploid
wheat cv. Chinese Spring (null, 1Bx7+1By8,
1Dx2+1Dy12) were used as references.
Characterization of the complete ORFs of 1Ay from
diploid and tetraploid wheats
CTAB method was carried out to extract genomic DNA
from the leaves of two-week-old single plant [50]. For
amplifying the complete coding sequence of 1Ay, a pair of

primers,
P1
(5'-ATGGCTAAGCGGC/TTA/GGTCCTCTTTG-3')
and
P2
(5'-CTATCACTGGCTG/
AGCCGACAATGCG-3'), were designed according to the
nucleotide sequences conserved in the 5' or 3' ends of the
ORFs of published HMW-GSs. The LA Taq polymerase
(TaKaRa) with GC buffer for GC-rich template was used in
the PCR amplification to avoid introducing errors into the
sequence. The cycling parameters was 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 40 sec, 68°C for 5 min,
and a final extension step at 68°C for 15 min[51]. PCR
products were separated in 1% agarose gels and all DNA
fragments were recovered and purified from agarose gels,
and ligated into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa). Then the
ligation mixtures were transformed into Escherichia coli
DH5α competent cells. To obtain the full-length
sequence, the strategy of primer walking and the nest deletion method according to Sambrook et al. [52] were used.
The sequencing was performed by Invitrogen Company
(Shanghai, China). The final nucleotide sequences for
each ORF of 1Ay were determined from the sequencing
results of 3 independent clones.
Isolations of the 5' flanking promoter region of 1Ay genes
Based on the alignment of the sequences of published
HMW glutenin genes 1Ax1 (GenBank: X61009), 1Ax2*

pair of primers (P3 and P4) specific for the promoter
region of 1Ay was designed. The P3 primer (5'-AGGGAAAPage 10 of 13

GACAATGGACATG-3') was designed from the sequence
which was strictly conserved in the 5' flanking regions of
all Glu-1 loci, whereas the P4 primer (5'-CATCTGGAGCCCCGTGCTC-3') was derived from the sequence
coding for 6 amino acid residues (STGLQM) which
existed only in y-type HMW-GSs. The amplification profile was 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for
40 sec, 60°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min 30 sec, and a
final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were
purified, cloned into pMD18-T, and sequenced. The final
nucleotide sequences for 1Ay promoter were also constructed on sequencing at least 3 independent clones.
Further investigation of the corresponding 5' flanking
promoter regions of 23 different diploid wheat species
When carrying out the present studies, we found that all
the 5' flanking regions of both inactive and active 1Ay
genes from T. urartu, T. monococcum aegilopoides, T. turgidum dicoccon and T.aestivum, shared an 85 bp deletion.
This deletion has only been identified in the 5 flanking
regions of Glu-A1-2 alleles but not in any other locus. To
ensure the 85 bp deletion was either specific for Glu-A1-2
alleles or also present in other alleles, we focused on the
corresponding regions of Glu-1-2 of other diploid species
of Triticeae. It will be helpful to understand the relationship between HMW-GS gene expression and their 5' flanking sequence variations. Then, the 5' flanking sequences
of Glu-1-2 were characterized by using primers P3 and P4
from 23 diploid species of Triticeae. The PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing were the same 1Ay promoter
characterization mentioned above.
Nucleotides and protein sequence analyses and
evolutionary relationship investigations
The translation of nucleotide sequences was performed by
DNAman software package (V5. 2. 10; Lynnon Biosoft).

Multiple alignments were carried out with Clustal W
(V1.83) for comparisons of DNA or protein sequences
[53]. The alignment was further improved by visual examination and manual adjustment. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship of 1Ay genes from different wheat
species with previously characterized Glu-1-2 alleles (represented by 1By9 and 1Dy10), we selected the nucleotide
sequences of the 5'flanking region plus the sequences
encoding signal peptides and N-terminal domain (the
corresponding region of 1Dx5 was used as outgroup) to
create a multiple alignment by the Clustal W program.
The software MEGA 4.02 was used to create phylogenetic
trees by neighbour-joining (NJ) method [54].
