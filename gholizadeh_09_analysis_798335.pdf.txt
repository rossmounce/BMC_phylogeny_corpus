Abstract
Background: The identification of key molecules is crucial for designing transmission-blocking
vaccines (TBVs), among those ookinete micronemal proteins are candidate as a general class of
malaria transmission-blocking targets. Here, the sequence analysis of an extra-cellular malaria
protein expressed in ookinetes, named von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein (WARP),
is reported in 91 Plasmodium vivax isolates circulating in different regions of Iran.
Methods: Clinical isolates were collected from north temperate and southern tropical regions in
Iran. Primers have been designed based on P. vivax sequence (ctg_6991) which amplified a fragment
of about 1044 bp with no size variation. Direct sequencing of PCR products was used to determine
polymorphism and further bioinformatics analysis in P. vivax sexual stage antigen, pvwarp.
Results: Amplified pvwarp gene showed 886 bp in size, with no intron. BLAST analysis showed a
similarity of 98–100% to P. vivax Sal-I strain; however, Iranian isolates had 2 bp mismatches in 247
and 531 positions that were non-synonymous substitution [T (ACT) to A (GCT) and R (AGA) to
S (AGT)] in comparison with the Sal-I sequence.
Conclusion: This study presents the first large-scale survey on pvwarp polymorphism in the world,
which provides baseline data for developing WARP-based TBV against both temperate and tropical
P. vivax isolates.

Background
Plasmodium vivax is one of the two most prevalent species
of human malaria parasites that occurs throughout the
tropics, except in western and central sub-Saharan Africa,
where the absence of Duffy factor on the surface of red
blood cells largely protects the local populations [1]. In

addition, recent studies have suggested that vivax malaria
can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum
malaria [2-5]. To date, the anti-malarial treatment and the
vector control measures have not had a significant impact
on the transmission of malaria from humans to mosquitoes. Therefore, vaccine-targeting antigens expressed on

the surface of the sexual stages of malaria parasites, such
as gametocytes, gametes, zygotes and ookinetes, are being
considered for the development of a transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) [6-8], a promising strategy for malaria
control. The parasite has to undergo a complex development programme inside the mosquito from gametocyte to
sporozoite [9]. So far, several studies have focused on the
identification and characterization of TBV targets [10-14].
One of the TBV targets is a soluble protein that is called
von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein (WARP),
which is expressed in late ookinetes and early oocysts
[14,15]. WARP could mediate ookinete attachment to the
mosquito midgut, differentiation of ookinete to oocyst,
and interactions with the mosquito basal lamina. Oocyst
formation was reduced significantly when mosquitoes fed
on an infected mouse passively immunized with the antiWARP antibody. This indicates that the antibody interferes with WARP function by recognizing the protein on
the surface of the parasite and makes it a candidate antigen for a TBV [14].
The malaria endemic area of Iran is located in the southeastern part of the country, bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea. This corner of
Iran consists of Sistan and Baluchistan, Hormozgan and
the tropical part of Kerman provinces, where malaria
transmission has been found to be perennial, with Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles culicifacies, Anopheles fluviatilis and
Anopheles pulcherrimus as the main vectors. More than
90% and 70% of the infections were due to P. vivax in the
first and second peaks of transmission in 2007, respectively. In North, although malaria is under control since
its re-emergence in 1994, Anopheles maculipennis and
Anopheles sacharovi are the main vectors, while Anopheles
superpictus and Anopheles hyrcanus are suspected as the secondary vectors.
Using asexual blood stages antigens, PvCSP and PvMSP-1,
Zakeri et al [16,17] revealed the extent of genetic diversity
in Iranian P. vivax populations. They also reported that
both csp sequence types, VK210 and VK247, and the three
allelic types of msp-1 (Belem, Sal-I and recombinant type)
gene were identified among P. vivax populations [16,17].
Further, they reported limited sequence polymorphism in
sexual stage antigens (pvs25 and pvs28) among field P.
vivax populations in Iran [18]. Therefore, this investigation was designed to analyse the degree of polymorphism
in the warp gene of P. vivax in low transmission areas in
Iran by using sequence analysis. The rational explanation
for high priority selection of this gene is: 1) the limited
information on P. vivax sexual stage antigens in mosquito
and their importance for TBV in the states under WHO
Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) and 2)
anti-WARP polyclonal antibody strongly inhibits (70–
92%) Plasmodium development in the mosquito [14,19].

Moreover, this study will provide a baseline data for further applied studies including eventual field trials of
experimental vaccines. On the other hand, despite the differences in vector composition and other epidemiological
features in various endemic areas, this protein was
reported to be highly conserved within and among different Plasmodium species [19]. Therefore, it is conceivable to
use this TBV candidate of P. vivax for other Plasmodium
species, such as Plasmodium falciparum. Furthermore, the
present results would complement the available information regarding TBV candidate and would allow comparing
and contrasting the Iranian P. vivax populations to those
from different epidemiological settings. Therefore, to
achieve this goal, first specific primers were designed to
amplify the pvwarp gene and then characterize the gene
structure among temperate and tropical Iranian P. vivax
populations.

Methods
Study areas and sample collection
Samples were collected from symptomatic P. vivaxinfected patients during 2000–2003 from the Ardebil
province in the north of Iran (n = 31) and Sistan and Baluchistan province in the south (n = 60) during 2000–
2006. In the North, malaria re-appeared after 20 years following a large displacement of people from the Republic
of Azerbaijan and to some extent from Armenia in 1994;
however, it came under control in northern Iran through
a multi-disciplinary strategy in 2003. The transmission
season is from June to October [17] and P. vivax is the
only Plasmodium species detected microscopically. In
addition, mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum infections were
detected only by sensitive molecular methods in this
region [20].

The second study areas are in the southern parts of Iran,
including Sistan and Baluchistan bordering Afghanistan,
Pakistan, the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea. There are
two peaks of malaria transmission in this area: the first,
from May to August when P. vivax is the predominant species and the second, from October to November when
both P. vivax and P. falciparum occur, sometimes in equal
numbers.
All temperate and tropical P. vivax clinical isolates were
diagnosed by light microscope examination of Giemsastained blood smear. The blood samples (1 ml) were collected on admission after informed consent was obtained
from adults or from the parents or legal guardians of children. This study was approved by Ethical Review Committee of Pasteur Institute of Iran.
The extraction of P. vivax DNA
Plasmodium vivax genomic DNA was extracted from the
infected blood by standard phenol/phenol-chloroform

extraction and ethanol precipitation as described by Snounou et al [21]. The DNA was dissolved in 30 μl of TE buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and kept at 20°C until use.
Primer designing
At the time of designing this study, the only available
sequence for pvwarp gene in GeneBank was related to
accession no. AB051630 (Tsuboi, direct submission).
Therefore, the first set of primers was designed based on
this sequence by using Gene Runner (version 3.05, 1994,
Hastings Software Inc.) and BLAST [22] softwares. These
newly desinged primers were used for amplification of
pvwarp gene followed by cloning and sequencing of the
amplified fragment. The sequencing results revealed that
the first 50 amino acids of the outcoming sequence did
not match the submitted sequence to GeneBank by
Tsuboi. Thus, the second set of primers were designed
from a 108 bp upsream based on sequence of P. vivax
(ctg_6996) [23] as follow:

PvWF: 5'TAAGAGGGCAACACAAACG3'
PvWR: 5'ATCTTCACCTGCCCACTCC3'
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of pvwarp fragment was
conducted by the above mentioned primers in all 91 Iranian P. vivax isolates. The reaction was carried out for 35
cycles at 95°C for 5 minutes, 95°C for 1 minute, 62°C for
1 minute and 72°C for 1 minute and a final primer extension at 72°C for 10 minutes.
Molecular analysis of pvwarp gene
In order to define the extent of variability within pvwarp,
the PCR products from 15 northern and 35 southern isolates were directly sequenced by using the designed primers. For this purpose, a ABI 3100 DNA sequencer (Kawsar,
Biotech, Iran) was used. Nucleotide and amino acid
sequences were aligned with the corresponding Sal-I
sequence ([GenBank: XM-001608555]) by using MEGA4
[24] and CLUSTAL W [25]. Major alleles were classified
based on protein sequence alignment and the tree was
constructed with the neighbor-joining method, Kimura
two-parameter and pairwise deletion, based on amino
acid sequences of PvWARP from Iranian isolates and
other Plasmodiun species in GenBank.

To identify B-cell epitope binding sites and secondary
structure in two groups, further bioinformatic analysis
was done on amino acid sequences of PvWARP protein by
using B-cell epitope prediction [26] and Jemboss [27]
softwares. Nucleotide sequences are available in the GenBank, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)
and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) databases under
[GenBank: FJ170289 to FJ170338].

Results
In the primary phase of this study, pvwarp was sequenced
by using designed primers based on the only available reference sequence (AB051630). The obtained 886 bp
sequences from Iranian P. vivax isolates were aligned with
that reference ([GenBank: AB051630]) reported by
Tsuboi, and also with Salvador-I sequence ([GenBank:
XM-001608555]), which showed 98% and 99% similarity, respectively. In the second phase, because the
sequencing results revealed that the first 50 bp of the
obtained sequences did not match the submitted
sequence to GeneBank, a new pair of primers (PvWF and
PvWR) were designed from a 108 bp upsream based on
sequences of P. vivax (ctg_6991) [23]. These primers
amplified a fragment of about 1044 bp in 31 temperate
northern and 60 tropical southern isolates from Iran, with
no size polymorphism. Sequencing the target amplified
fragment showed that this gene contains a 886 bp open
reading frame encoding a putative 295 amino acid protein
with a calculated molecular mass of ~32.2 kDa. The analysis of the primary structure by SignalP [28] indicates that
the first 69 bp of nucleotides (23 amino acids) are signal
sequences, and the remaining sequences from amino
acids 93–286 contain a von Willebrand factor type A
module like domain (domain A) (Figure 1).
Finally, based on the sequencing result, 15 northern and
35 southern P. vivax isolates were selected randomly for
sequencing analysis and the results revealed three distinct
variants among the 50 sequenced samples (Figure 1). Two
isolates from each study area showed 100% similarity to
Sal-I sequence ([GenBank: XM-001608555]), while the
majority (13 isolates from north and 23 isolates from
south) had 99% homology with Sal-I isolate (Table 1).
Based on nucleotide analysis, in pvwarp gene, four substitutions at positions 102, 222, 247 and 531 were detected.
In Sal-I sequence ([GenBank: XM-001608555]), amino
acids at residues of 83 and 177 are T (ACT), and R (AGA).
However, in 13 isolates from north and 21 isolates from
south, those positions substituted with A (GCT) and S
(AGT), respectively, and in two remaining isolates from
south, only one substitution at position 83 was observed
in comparison with Sal-I (substitution of T to A) (Figure
1). In addition, PvWARP has two synonymous and two
non-synonymous substitutions in amino acid sequence in
northern and southern isolates from Iran. Further analysis
of amino acid sequences with B-cell epitope prediction
software showed that non-synonymous substitutions are
not in epitope sites, and the analysis of protein secondary
structure in two groups showed that non-synonymous
substitutions have not changed the structure of PvWARP.
Total frequency of the three PvWARP haplotypes (I, II and
III) in examined samples are (T/R, 8%), (A/S, 88%) and
(A/R, 4%) respectively (Figure 2).

Amino acid sequence alignment of the three pvwarp variants in 50 Iranian P. vivax isolates. The sequences were
compared with Sal-I ([GenBank: XM-001608555] and represent the secretary signal sequence (SS), the A domain. The representative PvWARP haplotypes are: PvWARP-I (T/R, 8%), PvWARP-II (A/S, 88%) and PvWARP-III (A/R, 4%). //, indicates conserved sequences and dots represent identical residues.

Phylogenetic tree constructed based on the PvWARP
sequences originated from this study revealed that 50
sequences were divided into three distinct haplotypes. The
first haplotype includes Sal- I and sequences derived from
the present study, the second one includes sequences that
contain two non-synonymous substitutions, and the last
one includes sequences that contain one non-synonymous substitution in comparison with Sal-I strain. Plasmodium knowlesi is the nearest taxa to P. vivax, while P.
falciparum, Plasmodium chabaudi, Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium gallinaceum stand at farther
distance from P. vivax (Figure 3).

Discussion
Plasmodium vivax remains a significant public health problem in parts of Latin America and Asia, where it can
account for 40–90% of malaria cases. In addressing the
developing a vaccine for P. vivax malaria, understanding
the epidemiology of P. vivax and the polymorphism of
different vaccine candidate antigens at sexual and asexual

stages is highly needed. Recent advances increase confidence that a mosquito stage transmission-blocking
malaria vaccine will be feasible [29]. For identifying
malaria TBV targets, most strategies have been focused on
gametocytes, gametes or zygotes [7,30].
Little is known about the mechanisms that direct parasite
development to its mosquito host. More recently, some
plasmodial proteins have been identified as potential
antigens for a mosquito-stage transmission-blocking vaccine, including chitinase [19,31,32], CTRP [19,33-35],
secreted ookinete adhesive protein (SOAP) [36], membrane-attack ookinete protein (MOAP) [37], WARP [19]
and lectin adhesive-like protein (LAP)[38,39]. In mosquito infectivity, an important role has been shown for
each of these proteins through knockout experiments, but
their utility for mosquito stage vaccine is still unclear [29].
WARP, a gene encoding a Plasmodium surface protein with
a von Willebrand factor A like adhesive domain, is
expressed only in late ookinetes and early oocysts [15].

Frequency (%)

The study conducted by Li et al [19] showed that anti-P.
falciparum WARP significantly reduced the infectivity of P.
gallinaceum to Aedes aegypti and P. falciparum to Anopheles
mosquitoes. On the other hand, Richards et al [40]
reported a limited polymorphism in PfWARP within clinical isolates collected from a wide variety of geographical
regions. They showed three non-synonymous substitutions in positions 140 (F to L), 148 (V to F/L) and 228 (T
to A) in comparison to P. falciparum 3D7 strain sequence
[40]. However, so far, there was not any published data on
polymorphism of WARP of P. vivax field isolates. Therefore, this investigation was designed to analyse the
sequence of WARP in 50 field isolates from two different
malaria settings in north (re-emerged) and south
(endemic) of Iran.

[GenBank: FJ170328] is the representative isolate from
PvWARP-III haplotype ([GenBank: AJ170330 from south])
that has one non-synonymous amino acid sequence. The previously published sequences are Sal-I ([GenBank: XM001608555]), P. knowlesi ([GenBank: AM910983]), P. falciparum ([GenBank: XM 001349468]), P. gallinaceum [19], P.
chabaudi ([GenBank: XM 739938]), P. berghei ([GenBank:
AY247951]) and P. yoelii ([GenBank: XM 723529]).

The result revealed a limited polymorphism in pvwarp
gene of P. vivax field isolates in low transmission malaria
settings with different vector composition. Nucleotide
sequence analysis showed that these isolates have polymorphisms in four positions 102, 222, 247 and 531 with
only two non-synonymous substitutions at residues 83 (T
to A) and 177 (R to S). However, these polymorphic positions in P. vivax are not homologous to those reported for
the P. falciparum gene (positions 140, 148 and 228). Furthermore, the comparison of Iranian isolates with
AB051630 by BLAST (direct submition by Tsuboi in
2001) showed a similarity of 98%. However, the [GenBank: AB051630] in the first 50 amino acid residues dose
not match the recently published Sal-I gene sequence
([GenBank: XM-001608555]). This may be due to the
misread or sequencing error in the original study. Having
all reading frames, the correct amino acids could be
detected by looking at frameshift against Sal-I sequence.
In this regard, it might be required to revise the AB051630
sequence in the GenBank.
The secondary structure of deduced amino acid sequence
of PvWARP was analysed by using Jemboss software [27].
In comparison with Sal-I strain, the two non-synonymous
positions (aa. 83 and 177), that are located in β-sheet and
coil region, did not change the protein configuration in
three detected haplotypes within 50 sequenced samples,
indicating the conserved nature of this gene in Iranian isolates.
The outcoming results from 50 sequences addressed for
the first time the sequence diversity in PvWARP from vivax
endemic region in the Middle East. In spite of detecting
two and three haplotypes in temperate northern and tropical southern isolates of Iran based on their frequency distribution (Figure 2), the majority of the isolates were
categorized in two types: type 1 was 100% similar to Sal-I
strain and type 2 had two non-synonymous substitutions
at amino acid residues 83 and 177. Southern isolates had

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:137

one more type (type 3) that contains a non-synonymous
substitution in comparison with Sal-I strain (Figure 1).
The present results were in parallel to the findings
reported by Richards et al [40], in which limited polymorphism (three positions) was detected in PfWARP within
19 different geographical fields and three laboratory
strains.
In addition, phylogenetic tree were constructed based on
PvWARP amino acid sequences from the present study
and from different Plasmodium species available in GenBank. The high similarity (61%) among PvWARP and
PfWARP sequences at amino acid level suggests significant
conservation of WARP primary structure among these two
distinct Plasmodium species. As mentioned by Yuda et al
[15], it is assumed that the common invasion mechanism
may widely exist throughout the Plasmodium parasites.
This finding was also supported by the work carried out by
Li et al [19], in which the sera produced against PfWARP
significantly reduced the infectivity of PgWARP to Aedes
aegypti. Based on these findings, it is postulated that theoretically, WARP can be used as an universal TBV against
mixed P. vivax and P. falciparum. However, it should be
noted that it is not clear whether the antibody-binding
sites for WARP, which play a role in differentiation of ookinete to oocyst in mosquito midgut, are located within the
identical amino acid regions of both species.
On the other hand, pvmsp-1 and pvcsp genes are two vaccine candidates for blood stage of malaria infection. Zakeri et al [16,17] reported a csp genetic diversity among
temperate and tropical P. vivax isolates from Iran. Parasites collected in the northern area were almost exclusively
of the VK210 (99.5%) type, while both VK210 (70.5%)
and VK247 (17.5%) types were present in the southeastern areas. Among sequenced isolates in the present study,
we did not detect any correlation between the pvwarp haplotypes and the type of either pvcsp or pvmsp-1 because
these three haplotypes were distributed among both three
haplotypes of pvwarp (Table 1). However, this is not consistent with the findings of this study showing the presence of different Anopheles vector species, zoogeography,
ecology and vectorial capacity in the study areas. This may
point the fact that the polymorphisms are not selected/
correlated with transmission by different vector species in
two different malaria settings of Iran. This provides an
advantage for the wider use of proposed WARP-based
transmission-blocking vaccine. Furthurmore, although
the endemicity is low in both areas in the south, malaria
has never been interrupted, while the northern areas were
malaria-free for a period of more than 30 years till 1994.

vides a baseline data for developing WARP-based TBV
against both temparate and tropical P. vivax isolates. So
far, the polymorphisms in the few proteins of sporogony
cycle of malaria parasites studied. Low degree of the polymorphism in Iranian PvWARP state that the proteins
expressed in the mosquito stages appear to be less polymorphic than those expressed in the blood stages, which
might indicate that the selective pressure in the mosquito
is less strong than that in the mammalian host. Accordingly, limitted polymorphism in PfWARP and PvWARP
sequences seems to be useful for TBV studies in the oriental corner of EMRO, including Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Further experimental work is under progress in to
define the transmission blocking activity of anti-WARP
antibodies to disrupting the development of ookinete to
oocyst within the mosquito vectors.
