Abstract
Background: The y-larva, a crustacean larval type first identified more than 100 years ago, has
been found in marine plankton samples collected in the arctic, temperate and tropical regions of all
oceans. The great species diversity found among y-larvae (we have identified more than 40 species
at our study site alone) indicates that the adult organism may play a significant ecological role.
However, despite intense efforts, the adult y-organism has never been identified, and nothing is
therefore known about its biology.
Results: We have successfully and repeatedly induced metamorphosis of y-larvae into a novel,
highly reduced juvenile stage by applying the crustacean molting hormone 20-HE. The new stage is
slug-like, unsegmented and lacks both limbs and almost all other traits normally characterizing
arthropods, but it is capable of vigorous peristaltic motions.
Conclusion: From our observations on live and preserved material we conclude that adult
Facetotecta are endoparasitic in still to be identified marine hosts and with a juvenile stage that
represents a remarkable convergence to that seen in parasitic barnacles (Crustacea Cirripedia
Rhizocephala). From the distribution and abundance of facetotectan y-larvae in the world's oceans
we furthermore suggest that these parasites are widespread and could play an important role in
the marine environment.

Background
Crustacean y-larvae (subclass Facetotecta) were first
described from marine plankton in the late 1800s [1,2],
and they have since been recorded from the arctic to the
tropical waters of all oceans [3,4]. The adult organisms
have never been identified, and the Facetotecta is the only
crustacean group with a formal taxonomy based solely on
larval stages [5,6]. At our study site, Sesoko Island near
Okinawa, Japan, the enigmatic y-larvae form a significant

and diverse component in the plankton. Based on previous extensive sampling at Sesoko Island [7] and on an
extensive collection of mounted final naupliar exuviae
(obtained from individual rearing surveys from 1996 to
2004) we found that more than 40 morphological types
of y-larvae occur there, often abundantly and all representing undescribed species. Ontogenetic, morphological
and molecular evidence all point to a taxonomic relationship with the crustacean class Thecostraca. These comprise

the well-known barnacles (Cirripedia) and the Ascothoracida, but the Facetotecta forms a separate subclass and is
not an ingroup in any of these two taxa [5,8,9]. Thecostracan crustaceans have sessile adults and a development
comprised of a series of nauplius larvae and a final stage,
the cyprid, specialized for attachment [10]. Similarly, the
developmental sequence hitherto known for y-larvae
(Facetotecta) comprises a series of (five) naupliar instars
and a succeeding stage, the y-cyprid (Additional file 1),
which is obviously adapted for settlement [5,11]. Among
the related groups, the Ascothoracida are parasites in
anthozoans and echinoderms while the Cirripedia,
mostly comprised of suspension feeding organisms, also
include the Rhizocephala, one of the most specialized
groups of parasites within Crustacea [12,13]. This has
prompted speculations that the Facetotecta are also parasitic [10], whence a study of the metamorphosis of their
larvae could yield crucial information about the unknown
adults. However, until now it has not been possible to rear
y-larvae past the cyprid stage [3].

Results
Exposure to 20-HE at concentrations within the effective
range (1.04–2.08 μM) induced y-cyprids to metamorphose into a new and unexpected instar (Figure 1). This
300–400 μm long juvenile has a greatly simplified morphology and is surrounded by an extremely thin (<5 nm)
cuticle. We documented this metamorphosis from several
'species' of y-cyprids by still photography, video and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM); see Figures 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Following exposure to the hormone, metamorphosis begins after 12–24
hours by a retraction of all, or nearly all, cyprid tissues
into a compact body anteriorly, which is then surrounded
by the newly secreted, thin cuticle. While still inside the ycyprid, the body of the juvenile begins to exhibit contractions and bending motions. Aided by these motions it
exits from the y-cyprid after 31–72 hours through a hole
between the bases of the antennules in a process lasting 2–
4 hours (Figure 1A and Additional file 2). The molted
juvenile has been named the 'ypsigon', which refers to
'ypsilon' (the Greek letter y) and 'gonos' (Greek for
'larva'). The ypsigon is unsegmented, slug-like and lacks
appendages (Figures 1B and 1C). The body motions persists after escape and allow the ypsigon to crawl on the
bottom of the culture vessel and move several body
lengths away from the spent y-cyprid within a few minutes
(Additional files 3 and 4).
Like the preceding y-nauplius and y-cyprid stages, the
ypsigon lacks a functional gut, but an elongated, dark
mass of cells filled with fat globules and extending
through most of the body may represent a vestige of this
organ system (Figures 1B and 2C). Within the ypsigon
body the muscles and compound eyes of the preceding y-

cyprid stage are in a state of advanced degeneration (Figure 2A).
The ultrathin cuticle and the decomposing compound
eyes are the only morphological indications of its arthropod affiliation (Figures 2A and 2B). According to the species tested, the resulting ypsigon could differ in
morphology from being elongated to having a rather
plump shape, but it always exhibited the same simplified
structure (Figures 3, 4, 5). Ypsigons kept alive in culture
for more than 24 hours passed through a molt that
yielded another, second juvenile stage (Figures 2C and
2D). This second ypsigon stage had the same morphology
as the first and continued to exhibit the same bending
motions until they were preserved 48 hours after emerging from the y-cyprid (Additional file 5).

Discussion
Within Arthropoda, the extreme morphological reduction
seen in the new ypsigon stage is matched only by the early
endoparasitic 'vermigon' stage recently discovered in certain parasitic barnacles, the Rhizocephala Kentrogonida
[14,15]. Both the vermigon and the ypsigon are formed by
comparable metamorphic molts, in which the epidermis
withdraws from the old cuticle, closes around all organs in

the body and thereby forms the new slug-shaped stage. In
addition, both the vermigon and the ypsigon exhibit vigorous body movements after their escape from the cypris,
and they have virtually the same reduced morphology,
being surrounded only by an exceedingly thin and very
pliable cuticle and lacking segmentation, appendages and
sensory organs. Metamorphic stages of rhizocephalans,
similar to those emerging from naturally settled larvae
[13,16], have been produced when chemically inducing
cyprids to metamorphose in vitro [17]. By analogy with
the rhizocephalan vermigon [15,18] and our observation
that the ypsigon does not change morphology at the first
molt after escape, all evidence appears consistent with the
ypsigon also being endoparasitic, eventually giving rise to
a parasitic adult. This conclusion is also supported by
comparison with the similarly apodous commiform larvae in the more distantly related entoniscid Isopoda
[19,20]. However, while rhizocephalans are incontestable
members of the barnacles (Cirripedia), facetotectans
diverge as a separate subclass at the base of the thecostracan phylogenetic tree and must represent a wholly separate evolution of extremely specialized parasites [5,8,9].
The evolution of very similar, slug-shaped endoparasitic
stages (vermigon, ypsigon) in two different lineages
(Rhizocephala, Facetotecta) is therefore a stunning example of convergent evolution. Analogy with the Rhizocephala also leads to the prediction that the adult
facetotectan will turn out to have a highly simplified structure and this may help to explain why they have escaped
observation. Future efforts will focus both on culturing

the ypsigon in vitro to more advanced stages and screening
of the local fauna to identify the host animals.

Conclusion
While we cannot yet identify the adult y-organism or its
host, the new, highly aberrant and obviously endoparasitic stage in the life history of the Facetotecta takes us a
major step towards the solution of an enigma that has
puzzled zoologists for more than 100 years [2,4,10,2123]. It has been documented that parasites can significantly affect the structure of ecosystems, especially when
they are parasitic castrators and/or are affecting host
behavior [24]. Our observation of more than 40 facetotectan 'species' at a single study site indicates that a hitherto unknown and diverse fauna of advanced
endoparasites remain hidden and could play important
roles in many marine habitats.

Methods
Field collection and handling of larvae
Plankton was caught several times daily in September and
October of 2004 and 2005 from the pier of the Sesoko
Laboratory, Tropical Biosphere Research Center, University of the Ryukyus, on the southeast coast of Sesoko
Island (26°38'N 127°52'E). We used a hand-thrown net
with a 62 μm mesh width, and complete daytime samples
were sorted for larvae. Dusk and nighttime samples were
prefiltered at 1000 μm to exclude larger organisms and
make sorting easier. Samples were inspected and sorted
under a dissection microscope with transmitted light. As

in other thecostracan Crustacea, facetotectan species can
have either feeding (planktotrophic) or non-feeding (lecithotrophic) nauplii, while cyprids never feed [16]. From
each plankton catch, we isolated the non-feeding y-nauplii into a 30 mm diameter plastic Petri dish with coarsely
filtered (62 μm) seawater; any y-cyprids were isolated separately. The dishes were maintained at ambient room
temperature (24–28°C). Those containing nauplius batch
cultures were inspected at least three times daily and dead
larvae were removed. When noted, stage-five nauplii,
identified by the development of the pigmented compound eyes of the y-cyprid, were isolated singly into Petri
dishes. After each stage-five nauplius had molted into a ycyprid, the shed naupliar cuticle (exuvium) was individually mounted on a glass slide in glycerine jelly. This
allowed us to document, which morphological type or
'species' it represented based on our extensive, unpublished records and collections of mounted larvae from this
area. Occasionally y-cyprids appeared in the batch cultures between examinations, but apart from these and a
few caught directly from the plankton, the great majority
of all y-cyprids used in our induced metamorphosis trials
(around 400) can thus be backtracked to a known naupliar type and be allocated to species, when a formal taxonomy for the Facetotecta is eventually established
[3,4,6,25].
Experimental setup
For the induction of metamorphosis, single cyprids were
introduced into standard plastic plates with 15 mm wells
containing the test solutions and incubated at 24–28°C.
A preliminary experiment was set up to test the effect of

three different metamorphosis-inducing compounds on
the y-cyprids. They were dissolved in Millipore-filtered
seawater and used in concentrations tested previously on
cyprids of parasitic barnacles (Rhizocephala) [17]: 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX at 4.5 μM), 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE at 208 μM, 20.8 μM, 2.08 μM, 1.04 μM
and 208 nM), and juvenile hormone (JH at 37.5 nM, 375
nM and 3.75 μM). This screening showed that only 20-HE
was able to induce the y-cyprids to metamorphose, and
another preliminary trial established that the most efficient concentration was between 1.04 and 2.08 μM. All
subsequent experiments were conducted within this
range.
Photo/video documentation
All y-cyprids tested were used within 24 hours after the
molt from the nauplius stage five. Well plates were
inspected several times daily using an Olympus inverted
microscope. Stages of metamorphosis were photographed
with an Olympus C5050 digital camera and digital videos
obtained with a Sony HAD Power Head. The plastic well
plates do not allow optimum conditions for microphotography. To obtain better micrographs and videos,
selected specimens were temporarily transferred to glass
slides with seawater and observed using a Nikon Microphot with up to 40× objectives. Digital images were optimized for contrast and color using Corel X3 suite. The
only other manipulation was to touch up the background,
not the specimen, in some scenes to remove extraneous
particles.
Transmission electron microscopy
For TEM, selected stages of metamorphosing y-cyprids
and free juveniles were fixed and stored in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Millipore-filtered seawater buffered to pH 7.4
with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate. Following three rinses in
the same buffer, specimens were postfixed in 1% OsO4,
dehydrated with dimethoxypropane and embedded in
TAAB 812 ('Epon') resin. Sections were mounted on slot
grids, stained with uranyl-acetate and lead-citrate and
inspected using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron
microscope fitted with a GATAN digital camera.
