Abstract
Background: Gene duplication has been a fundamental process in the evolution of eukaryotic
genomes. After duplication one copy (or both) can undergo divergence in sequence, expression
pattern, and function. Two divergent copies of the ribosomal protein S13 gene (rps13) of
chloroplast origin are found in the nucleus of the rosids Arabidopsis, Gossypium, and Glycine. One
encodes chloroplast-imported RPS13 (nucp rps13), while the other encodes mitochondriaimported RPS13 (numit rps13). The rps13 gene has been lost from mitochondrial DNA (mt rps13)
of many rosids.
Results: We studied sequence evolution of numit rps13 in comparison with nucp rps13 in seven
rosid genera. Ka/Ks analysis and likelihood ratio tests showed considerably higher Ka values and Ka/
Ks ratios in numit rps13 than in nucp rps13, indicating increased amino acid sequence divergence in
numit rps13. Two positively selected codons were detected in numit RPS13 in regions that are
inferred to interact with the 16S rRNA. Several amino acids in numit RPS13 have changed from the
one present in nucp RPS13 to the one present in mt RPS13, showing that numit rps13 is becoming
more like mt rps13. Comparison of expression patterns and levels of numit rps13 and nucp rps13
in Arabidopsis using microarray data indicated divergence in gene expression. We discovered that
in addition to numit rps13, Malus (apple) contains a transcribed mt rps13 gene. To determine if
partitioning of expression takes place between numit rps13 and mt rps13, expression of both copies
and RNA editing of mt rps13 were examined by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and sequencing from 14
different organ types plus seedlings subjected to five different abiotic stresses. Co-expression of
numit rps13 and mt rps13 was observed in all the organs and various stress treatments. We
determined that purifying selection is acting on both numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus.
Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that numit rps13 genes in rosids have experienced
adaptive sequence evolution and convergent evolution with mt rps13. Co-expression of numit
rps13 and mt rps13 and purifying selection on both genes in Malus suggest that both are functional.
The three organellar rps13 genes in rosids provide a distinctive case of gene duplication involving
the co-evolution of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes.

Background
Gene duplication has been an ongoing process during
eukaryotic evolution that has provided genetic raw material for the evolution of new gene functions that can lead
to morphological and physiological novelty. Duplicated
genes can undergo sequence divergence caused by positive
selection or neutral drift [1-3] and divergence in expression patterns and function. Two common fates of retained
duplicated genes are neofunctionalization – gain of a new
function or expression pattern by one copy [4] and subfunctionalization – partitioning of ancestral function or
expression pattern between both copies [5,6]. Plant
genomes contain large numbers of duplicated genes,
derived by polyploidy, segmental duplications, tandem
duplications, and retroposition of cDNAs. Many duplicated genes in plant genomes have been preserved and
undergone purifying selection, a few have undergone positive selection and functional diversification, and some
have experienced subfunctionalization [7-10].
There are three genes that code for organellar ribosomal
S13 genes among rosid species. Analysis of rps13 genes in
the rosid species Arabidopsis thaliana, cotton (Gossypium
arboreum), and soybean (Glycine max) revealed the presence of two expressed copies of rps13 in the nucleus that
were derived by gene duplication [11,12]. Both in vitro
and in vivo RPS13 protein import experiments indicated
that one copy encodes the chloroplast-imported protein
(nucp rps13) while the other encodes mitochondriaimported RPS13 (numit rps13) [11,12]. It was inferred
that the missing mt rps13 gene product has been functionally replaced by the product of numit rps13 in a common
ancestor of Arabidopsis, cotton, and legumes. Thus the
function of numit rps13 has been modified after gene
duplication, and one could argue that numit rps13 has
gained a new function because it is operating in a new cellular context (the mitochondrial ribosome instead of the
chloroplast ribosome). Subsequently mt rps13 was lost
from mitochondrial DNA many times during the evolutionary history of rosids, as inferred from a Southern blot
hybridization survey [13](see Additional File 1). Surprisingly, however, there were many species of rosids that do
appear to retain rps13 in the mitochondrion, based on
Southern blot hybridizations, but the gene in some species may not be intact or functional.
The organellar rps13 genes in rosids provide an intriguing
system to study gene duplication because the subcellular
location and site of action of numit RPS13 has changed
after gene duplication from the chloroplast to the mitochondrion. We have studied sequence evolution of numit
rps13 among rosids to determine what kinds of amino
acid changes have taken place and where those amino
acids are located in the tertiary structure, as well as to test
the hypothesis that there has been adaptive evolution.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/25

Also we have examined the divergence of expression patterns between numit rps13 and nucp rps13. After finding
intact and expressed numit rps13 and mt rps13 genes in
Malus we tested the hypothesis that there has been expression partitioning of the two genes in different organ types
and/or stress conditions to preserve both genes.

Results
Identification of numit rps13 in Malus, Populus, and
Citrus and phylogenetic analysis
To study the evolution of numit rps13 sequences in the
rosids, we identified sequences homologous to numit
rps13 in Malus, Populus, and Citrus by BLAST searches of
the NCBI expressed sequence tag (EST) database using the
numit rps13 from Arabidopsis as a query. ESTs (see Materials and Methods) were aligned and the open reading
frames were identified. The genes in each species are predicted with high probability to encode mitochondrial
proteins by four prediction programs: MitoProt [14], TargetP v1.1 [15], Predotar v1.03 [16], and iPSORT [17].
Three of the four programs discriminate mitochondrial
from chloroplast proteins and no support was obtained
for chloroplast targeting. Alignment of the N-termini with
mitochondrial targeting presequences from numit rps13
in other rosid species shows sequence conservation and
indicates that they are homologous genes (Figure 1).
Because numit rps13 in Arabidopsis, Gossypium, and Glycine
have been experimentally shown to be imported into
mitochondria but not chloroplasts (Adams et al., 2002),
we infer that the products from the homologous genes in
Malus, Populus, and Citrus also are targeted to mitochondria. We found numit rps13 sequences only in species
belonging to the rosid lineage, suggesting that the gene
duplication event that created numit rps13 likely occurred
after the emergence of the rosid lineage. We did not find a
numit rps13 sequence in Vitis, a group at the base of rosids
[18,19], despite the mostly sequenced genome [20] and a
large EST collection available at NCBI. We infer that the
gene duplication event occurred at the base of the eurosids
after separation from the Vitaceae lineage (see Additional
File 1).

Nucp rps13 sequences from seven rosid species were
obtained from GenBank by BLAST searches using the previously characterized nucp rps13 from Arabidopsis [21] and
aligned with the numit rps13 sequences. Phylogenetic
analysis of the sequences verified the orthologous relationships of numit rps13 and nucp rps13 sequences (Figure 2). The phylogenetic relationships inferred from nucp
rps13 and numit rps13, however, did not follow established relationships of rosid species [18]. For numit rps13,
the positions of Populus and Gossypium in the tree are
switched; for nucp rps13 the gene positions in the tree are
completely scrambled. The lack of congruence between
the gene trees and organismal phylogeny is probably due
to the short sequences being analyzed (about 242 bp after
excluding the third codon position). Alternatively, it
might be caused by the complex history of multiple polyploidy events and subsequent loss of duplicated genes
during rosid evolution. For example, after polyploidization the lineage containing legumes and Malus might have
retained copy 1 while Arabidopsis, Citrus, Gossypium and
Populus retained copy 2 (Figure 2). Comparisons of
branch lengths showed that numit rps13 sequences have
diverged rapidly with much longer branch lengths than
the nucp rps13 sequences, suggesting there has been accelerated evolution of numit rps13 in each lineage, and consistent with results from Adams et al. [11] that included
fewer species of rosids.

Accelerated nucleotide substitution rates and positive
selection on numit rps13
To better quantify the rate increase and to determine if
both Ka and Ks (or just Ka) are accelerated in numit rps13
sequences, the Ka, Ks values, and Ka/Ks ratios were compared between nucp rps13 and numit rps13 in the rosids.
Significantly higher Ka values and Ka/Ks ratios were
observed in the numit rps13 genes than in the nucp rps13
genes (P < 0.05; Table 1; see Additional file 2). The Ka values in the numit rps13 genes were 3–4 times greater than
in the nucp rps13 genes. No significant difference in Ks values, however, was found between the nucp rps13 and
numit rps13 copies (P > 0.05; see Additional file 2). These
results show that numit rps13 has been experiencing a
considerably accelerated rate of non-synonymous substitutions compared with the nucp rps13 in all seven lineages
of rosids.

Although simple pair-wise comparison of Ka and Ks analysis provides some insights into the accelerated amino acid
substitution in numit rps13, branchwise estimation of Ka,
Ks values, and Ka/Ks ratios can provide additional information such as positive selection and adaptive molecular
evolution along certain branches and clades [22-26]. To
detect if there has been positive selection acting on numit
rps13 and nucp rps13 in different rosid species, site specific
model analysis was conducted using PAML [23].
(Although synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions are abbreviated as dS and dN in PAML analysis, we
use the common designations Ks and Ka to refer to synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, respectively.)
Both the rps13 tree (Figure 2) and the species tree that
reflects our current understanding of rosid phylogeny [18]
were used for detection of positive selection to determine
if the tree topology influenced detection of positively
selected sites, and no differences were found in this
regard.
One ratio model (M0) shows that the Ka/Ks ratio of numit
rps13 is about 4 times higher than nucp rps13 (Table 2),
congruent with observations from simple Ka and Ks analysis. For each dataset, likelihood ratio tests (LRT) for detection of positive selection were examined using M7-M8
and M8a-M8 comparisons. For numit rps13, M8 is significantly better than M7 and M8a in numit rps13 (P < 0.05)
and 2.3% of sites are inferred to undergo positive selection (Table 2), suggesting there has been positive selection
acting on numit rps13. In addition, based on Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis, two codon sites in numit rps13
were identified as showing strong positive selection (posterior probability > 0.8; Table 2). However, there is no evidence for sites under positive selection in nucp rps13. In
nucp rps13, M8 is not significantly better than M7 and
M8a (Table 2). These results indicate that strong positive

selection acts on the evolution of numit rps13among the
rosid species, particularly at codons 28 and 114.
Structural location of positively selected amino acids
Relative locations of the two positively selected sites were
plotted on the tertiary amino acid structures of RPS13
from Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus (Figure 3)
to infer approximate locations in numit RPS13. Except for
the C-terminal end which is longer and contains one
more α-helix structure in T. thermophilus, the overall structure of RPS13 from E. coli and T. thermophilus are relatively
similar (Figure 3). RPS13 residues at positions 28 and 114
in E. coli (28 and 116 in T. thermophilus) correspond to the
positively selected sites in numit RPS13 based on the
amino acid alignment (Figures 3, 4). Previous structural
and functional studies of Thermus RPS13 showed that
there are two structurally important regions where RPS13
interacts with the 16S rRNA [27-29]. One of them is the
loop region between helix 1 and turn 1 (residues 22–25)
[29]. One of the positively selected residues found in our

analysis is close to that region. The second positively
selected residue in numit Rps13 is located in the highly
basic COOH-terminal extended region (Figure 3). This
region is virtually devoid of secondary structure and
found to interact with the 16S rRNA at the P-site and Asite (residues 116–120 for P-site and residues 120–122 for
A-site) [27-29]. Positively selected sites in or near regions
that interact with the 16S rRNA suggest that there has been
functional refinement of numit RPS13 to interact better
with the 16S rRNA.
Amino acid changes in numit rps13 that increase identity
to mt rps13
Because numit rps13 was derived from nucp rps13 and
encodes a RPS13 protein that functions in the mitochondria, we were interested in determining if the numit
RPS13 has become more like the mt RPS13 amino acid
sequence. We determined if there have been mutations in
the numit rps13 genes in any of the seven rosid species
that change an amino acid to the residue that is present in

occurred (Figure 4B). Mutations are inferred to have
occurred along most of the branches, suggesting continuous refinement of the numit rps13 sequence. We infer that
three mutations occurred in the common ancestor of all
the species, with a subsequent mutation at site 80 in Arabidopsis from D to E (a conservative substitution) and at
site 110 in Gossypium from A to S, although scenarios with
multiple recent mutations cannot be ruled out.

(Figure 4). Red regions and plus signs indicate relative positions of positively selected sites. Green regions and asterisks
indicate relative positions of amino acids in numit Rps13 in at
least one rosid species that have mutated to the amino acid
present in mt rps13 genes (Figure 4). Among them, sites 4
and 10 (Figure 4) are located in the coil region of the N-terminal end, site 15 is in the beginning of the first β-sheet, site
21 is in the first α-helix, site 32 is in the second α-helix, sites
42 and 43 are in the coil region between the second α-helix

region.

mt RPS13. In our alignment of nucp RPS13, numit RPS13,
and mt RPS13 across different plant species, sixteen sites
were identified where numit RPS13 in one or more species has the same amino acid at the corresponding site in
mt RPS13 from seven angiosperms, and the amino acid is
different from the amino acid(s) present in nucp RPS13
(Figure 4A). The sixteen sites are relatively evenly distributed in the RPS13 tertiary structure (Figure 3). Although
little is known about the exact functions of those regions,
some of the mutations might help improve the function
of numit RPS13 in the mitochondrial ribosome. We plotted the sixteen amino acid changes on the phylogeny of
the seven rosid species to infer when they might have

Expression evolution of numit rps13
Having studied sequence evolution of numit rps13 we
next tested the hypothesis that there have been changes in
expression patterns and levels of expression of numit
rps13 relative to nucp rps13. Extensive microarray data are
available for Arabidopsis thaliana including a single study
that examined expression in 51 organs and developmental stages using the ATH1 array [30]. We analyzed expression data for numit rps13 and nucp rps13 using an ANOVA
approach (see Methods). Nucp rps13 is expressed a higher
level than numit rps13 in most organs (P < 0.05; Figure
5A; Additional file 3). Notable exceptions were roots,
senescing leaves and pollen where numit rps13 is more
highly expressed (P < 0.05; Figure 5A). When comparing
expression levels of the two genes among organs, sometimes the levels of both genes go up or down together, but
sometimes the levels go in opposite directions. Overall
the organ-specific expression patterns between the two
genes show both similarities and differences (R = 0.31, P
< 0.05), depending on the organs compared.

To compare expression patterns of numit rps13 to other
nuclear encoded ribosomal protein genes, we analyzed
expression data for three other nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes: rps9, rps10, and rps11
[31]. The expression levels and patterns of all four genes
were highly similar (R = 0.73–0.94, P < 0.0001), although
rps11 expression levels were lower in some organs (P <
0.05; Figure 5B). Thus numit rps13 has evolved an expression pattern similar to that of other nuclear-encoded
genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and its
expression has diverged from that of nucp rps13.
Malus contains an expressed and RNA-edited copy of
rps13 in the mitochondrion
Having studied the sequence and expression evolution of
numit rps13 we next consider the fate of mt rps13 in rosids.
A large number of rosids, including Arabidopsis, Gossypium,
Glycine, and Citrus have lost mt rps13, as judged by DNA
gel blot hybridization [13] (see Additional file 1), but
some rosids retain rps13 in mitochondrial DNA. We identified a transcribed copy of rps13 in Malus domestica
(apple) from BLAST searches of the NCBI EST database
that is 90–92% identical with the rps13 gene in the mitochondrion of several eudicots. The sequence was derived
from a study of ESTs in Malus [32]. A similar gene (97%

to those that are evolutionarily conserved [33]. Among
angiosperm rps13 genes, nine possible edited sites have
been identified (see Additional file 4). Four of those sites
are already T's instead of C's in the genomic DNA
sequence of mt rps13 from Malus, and thus RNA editing
might be expected at five sites in the Malus cDNAs. No
editing was observed in the two ESTs from Malus, and the
EST from Prunus had editing at only one site (the 100th
base). To verify the lack of RNA editing, we amplified and
directly sequenced mt rps13 cDNAs from leaves and petals
of Malus. Unexpectedly five RNA editing sites were discovered in both leaves and petals at five sites (see Additional
file 4). After transcription, RNA editing converts codons
from serine to leucine (the 26th, 56th, and 287th bases)
and from arginine to cysteine (the 100th and 256th
bases). The changes made by RNA editing would restore
an evolutionarily conserved amino acid sequence and
make the resulting protein likely to be functional, should
the transcripts be translated.

the Rosaceae family. We evaluated the rps13 sequence
from Malus for sites of C-to-U RNA editing by PCR amplifying and sequencing rps13 from genomic DNA and comparing the gDNA sequence to the EST sequences. C-to-U
RNA editing plays an important role in the expression of
plant mitochondrial genes to restore certain amino acids

Co-expression of numit rps13 and mt rps13 in 14 different
organ types and under five different stress conditions
We conducted expression assays of numit rps13 and mt
rps13, and RNA editing examination of mt rps13, in Malus
to test the hypothesis that expression patterns have been
partitioned between the two genes in different organ
types. RT-PCR was performed with (RT+) or without (RT-)
reverse transcriptase to check for DNA contamination
(Figure 6). Transcripts of numit rps13 and mt rps13 were
observed in roots (from seedlings), stems, stigmas +
styles, and ovaries. Transcripts of these two genes were
also observed in 10 additional organ types: hypocotyls,
cotyledons, young leaves (from seedlings), mature leaves,
peduncles, petals, seeds, sepals, stamens, and young fruit.
Mt rps13 cDNAs were sequenced from each organ type to
determine if any sites were edited. Different organ types in
apple all showed the five RNA editing sites mentioned
above. The results of the RT-PCR experiments show that
both copies are co-expressed in all examined organ types.

Although both copies of rps13 are expressed in many
organ types it is possible that there might be partitioning
of expression between the two genes under stress conditions. We tested the hypothesis by examining the expression patterns of numit rps13 and mt rps13 under five
different stresses including cold, dark, heat, salt, and water
submersion treatments to determine if expression partitioning occurs under different environmental stresses.
Apple seedlings were independently subjected to each of
these five stresses (see Materials and Methods). Four
organ types, including roots, hypocotyls, cotyledons, and
leaves were examined for expression of numit rps13 and
mt rps13. Based on RT-PCR results, transcripts of numit
rps13 and mt rps13 were observed under each of the five
stress conditions: cold, dark, heat, salt, and water submer-

organs showed at least half as many transcripts from
numit rps13 as rps10 (Figure 7A). Cold stress was an exception, where the numit rps13/rps10 ratios were less than 0.4
(Figure 7A). Mt rps13 transcripts were present at slightly
over twice the levels of cob transcripts in leaves (Figure
7B). The mt rps13/cob transcript ratio was above 0.5 in
most other organs and under cold stress. Overall there is
evidence for relatively high levels of steady-state transcripts from numit rps13 and mt rps13 in most organs.

that the transcripts were RNA edited at 5 sites, although in
some cases there was partial editing at one or more sites.
We have shown transcription of both numit rps13 and mt
rps13 in many organs and under several stress conditions.

To determine if abundant levels of steady-state transcripts
are derived from both genes, we used real-time PCR (qRTPCR) to assay transcript levels of numit rps13 and mt
rps13. We compared levels of numit rps13 to those of
another nuclear gene for a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, rps10 (for ribosomal protein S10), and we compared
levels of mt rps13 to those of another mitochondrial gene,
cob (for cytochrome b). We assayed expression levels in a
subset of 9 organs and two stress conditions that were
assayed above. Numit rps13 transcripts were present at or

Purifying selection acting on numit rps13, nucp rps13, and
mt rps13 in Malus
Detecting purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection on each of the three rps13 genes would provide insights into the selective forces at work and could
indicate if one copy is a pseudogene. A Ka/Ks ratio less
than one would indicate purifying selection and be evidence for a functional gene, and a Ka/Ks ratio of about one
would be evidence of neutral evolution and thus probably
pseudogenization. The branch specific model in PAML
was used to detect adaptive molecular evolution in numit
rps13, nucp rps13, and mt rps13 for the Malus branches by
comparing with other plant species. For each LRT, M1 is
the model assuming neutral evolution among sites,
MAtest1 assumes that there are positively selected amino
acid sites for the foreground lineage, and MAtest2, is used
to test if the detection of positive selection is an artifact.
LRTs showed that MAtest1 is not significantly better than
M1 and MAtest2 in Malus numit rps13 and Malus mt rps13,
indicating that there is no positive selection for these two
branches (Table 3). For nucp rps13, MAtest1 is significantly
better than M1, but not better than MAtest2 (Table 3), suggesting that there is no positive selection in nucp rps13. In
addition, branch specific models can provide detailed
information about how many sites are undergoing purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection.
For numit rps13, 65% of the sites are under purifying
selection with Ka/Ks less than one, 28% of sites are under
neutral evolution with Ka/Ks close to one, and 7% of sites
are under positive selection with Ka/Ks greater than one
(Table 3) without statistical support by LRTs. For nucp
rps13, 90% of sites are under purifying selection, 7% of
sites are under neutral selection, and 3% of sites are under
positive selection (Table 3) although the positively
selected sites are not supported by LRTs. For mt rps13,
66% of sites are under purifying selection and 34% of sites
are under neutral selection (Table 3). The number of sites
experiencing each type of selection in numit rps13 in
Malus is similar to numit rps13 in other rosids that do not
have mt rps13 (Table 4). Overall our results reveal that the
three ribosomal protein S13 genes in Malus are undergoing higher purifying selection than neutral evolution, sug-

gesting that their functionality is maintained by purifying
selection.

Discussion
Continuous accelerated evolution and molecular
adaptation of numit rps13 among rosids
After gene duplication some retained duplicated genes
undergo asymmetric rate divergence and the faster evolving copy experiences relaxed constraint or positive selection [34,35]. The increased Ka rate, Ka/Ks ratio, and
positively selected sites detected in numit rps13, compared
with nucp rps13, across different rosid species show there
has been accelerated sequence evolution of numit rps13.
The increased Ka rate is likely to be correlated with the
modified function of numit rps13 – from encoding a chloroplast ribosomal protein to a mitochondrial ribosomal
protein. Some amino acid sequence changes were probably necessary for numit RPS13 to interact well with other
proteins in the mitochondrial ribosome. The increased
rate of non-synonymous substitutions is a continuing
process instead of there being a burst of sequence change
upon formation of numit rps13 followed by a prolonged
period of lower rates of non-synonymous substitutions.
The continued higher Ka rate, and the two positively
selected codons in numit rps13 near the positions where
RPS13 interacts with 16S RNA domain, show that the
sequence, and suggest that the function, of numit RPS13
in mitochondria is continuing to be refined. Site-specific
positive selection has been detected in other duplicated
genes [36-38]. For example, in duplicated AP3 and PI
genes there has been functional diversification driven by
positive selection acting on different sites within a functional domain involved in heterodimerization [39].

The sixteen amino acids in one or more rosid species that
have changed to the amino acid present in mt RPS13 (Figure 4) indicate that numit RPS13 is becoming more like
mt RPS13. We propose that this is a type of convergent
sequence evolution of numit rps13 that possibly improves
the function of numit RPS13 in the ribosome. The amino
acid changes appear to have been taking place continuously during rosid evolution (Figure 4B), with the largest

number (five) having occurred on the branch leading to
the legumes Glycine and Medicago. We speculate that some
of the amino acid changes that have taken place along the
terminal or subterminal branches of the tree might have
allowed numit rps13 to be selected for, over mt rps13, and
allowed multiple independent losses of mt rps13 in different lineages (see Additional file 1). In species where mt
rps13 has been lost the product of numit rps13 presumably
functions as well as, or perhaps better than, mt rps13 or
else there would have been selection for retention of mt
rps13. Overall the adaptive and convergent evolutionary
forces that seem to be acting on numit rps13 have continued during rosid evolution instead of being factors only
soon after gene duplication in a common ancestor of
most rosids.
Expression evolution of numit rps13 and nucp rps13 in
Arabidopsis
Expression patterns of some duplicated genes have been
shown to evolve in a divergent and sometimes asymmetric manner [40-42]. For example, many of the genes
derived by an ancient polyploidy event in the Arabidopsis
lineage have undergone considerable expression divergence [43-45], some of which may have been asymmetric
between the two duplicates. Considering that numit rps13
and nucp rps13 show asymmetric divergence in sequence,
and different subcellular locations of their protein products, we predicted that they also would show asymmetric
divergence in expression, with the expression pattern of
numit rps13 being similar to that of other nuclearencoded genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins.
Numit rps13 and nucp rps13 did show some differences in
expression patterns although the differences were only
dramatic in roots, senescing leaves, and pollen. Numit
rps13 has evolved a similar expression pattern to three
other genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, per-

haps by gaining regulatory elements from another gene
for a mitochondrial protein, as have several mitochondrial genes that have been transferred to the nucleus [46].
Alternatively there may have been mutations in the regulatory elements of numit rps13 soon after gene duplication that produced an expression pattern similar to that of
other genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Considering that numit rps13 was formed in a common ancestor of most rosids, distinguishing between the above
possibilities about the origin of its regulatory elements is
impossible. Overall numit rps13 and nucp rps13 add to
the growing number of duplicated genes reported in Arabidopsis thaliana that have experienced divergence in
expression patterns.
Co-expression of numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus
We have shown that numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus
are both transcribed in 14 different organ types and under
five abiotic stress conditions, mt rps13 is RNA edited at
sites to make the transcripts contain an evolutionarily
conserved sequence, and abundant steady-state transcripts from both genes are present in a variety of organs.
Both genes are experiencing purifying selection. Taken
together, the data obtained in this study indicate that it is
likely that both numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus are
functional genes and not pseudogenes. However there is
the possibility, albeit unlikely, that transcripts from one
gene (particularly mt rps13) might not be translated. Even
if both proteins are present, there is the possibility that
only one is assembled into mitochondrial ribosomes, and
that process could vary among organs and environmental
conditions. Showing that both numit RPS13 and mt
RPS13 proteins are assembled into mitochondrial ribosomes, especially in a variety of organ types and under various environmental conditions, is beyond the scope of the
current evolutionary study.

Although we have provided evidence for the functionality
of the gene products from numit rps13 and mt rps13 in
Malus, might numit rps13 have experienced functional
reversion to encode a chloroplast protein? Several lines of
evidence do not support that possibility. The mitochondrial targeting presequence of numit RPS13 is similar to
those of numit RPS13 in Arabidopsis, Gossypium, and Glycine (Figure 1), each of which was experimentally determined to be imported into mitochondria but not
chloroplasts [11,12]. Numit rps13 in Malus does not have
a greatly accelerated rate of sequence evolution or show
more sites under positive selection, compared with numit
rps13 in other rosids, as might be expected if its product
now functions in the chloroplast. Instead purifying selection is operating on numit rps13 in Malus. Finally, there is
no evidence to suggest that nucp rps13 in Malus is a pseudogene and indeed the gene is experiencing strong purifying selection.
Co-expression of numit rps13 and mt rps13 genes in Malus
contrasts with the atp9 genes in Neurospora crassa where
the nuclear and mitochondrial copies are expressed during different stages of the life cycle [47] and expression has
been partitioned between the two genes. Presumably the
nuclear copy of atp9 was derived from transfer of the mitochondrial gene to the nucleus in an ancestor of Neurospora, and the current availability of several ascomycete
genome sequences could shed light on the evolutionary
timing of the gene transfer. Only three other cases of coexpression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes have been
reported, to our knowledge, including cox2 genes in multiple legume species within the Phaseoleae tribe [48], rpl5
genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum) [49], and sdh4 genes in
Populus [50]. Those genes contrast to rps13 in rosids
because the nuclear copies were derived by transfer of the
mitochondrial gene to the nucleus.
Considering that numit rps13 was created by gene duplication in the common ancestor of most rosids, co-expression of mt rps13 and numit rps13 in Malus has presumably
occurred for a long period of evolutionary time. Other
cases of co-expression of nuclear and mitochondrial genes
in plants represent evolutionarily recent gene transfers to
the nucleus. Indeed following transfer of a mitochondrial
gene to the nucleus the mitochondrial copy is often lost in
a relatively short amount of time [13]. Thus it was unexpected that numit rps13 and mt rps13 have been preserved
without partitioning of expression patterns. Why would
both copies continue to be retained and expressed? One
possibility is that there is partitioning of expression in
organs, tissues, or cell types, or under environmental conditions that were not examined in this study. Another possibility is that, despite the considerable level of sequence
divergence between numit rps13 and mt rps13 (about 42%
identity), the product of either gene functions well in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/25

mitochondrial ribosomes of Malus. That possibility is supported by the fact that some rosids (such as Arabidopsis,
Gossypium, Glycine, and Citrus) have only the numit rps13
and non-rosid angiosperms have only mt rps13. Another
possibility is that mutations have not occurred in numit
rps13 from Malus that cause it to be selected for over mt
rps13, as presumably occurred in other lineages of rosids
that have lost mt rps13. In this regard it is notable that
there are no amino acid changes in numit RPS13 to the
residue present in mt RPS13 that occurred along the terminal branch leading to Malus (Figure 4B), unlike all of
the other terminal branches on the tree leading to species
that have lost mt rps13.

Conclusion
The accelerated rate of amino acid evolution, positive
selection on specific sites, and amino acid changes to the
residue present in mt RPS13 provide evidence that numit
rps13 genes in rosids have experienced adaptive evolution
and convergent sequence evolution with mt rps13. Numit
rps13 provides an example of a gene that has experienced
site-specific positive selection while the gene as a whole
has been under purifying selection. Expression patterns of
numit rps13 have diverged to become similar to those of
other genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Malus
contains intact genes for both numit rps13 and mt rps13
that are transcribed in a range of organs and under several
abiotic stresses. Abundant levels of steady state transcripts
from both numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus in a variety
of organ types, as well as purifying selection acting on
both genes, suggest that both genes are functional and not
pseudogenes. The three organellar rps13 genes in rosids
provide a distinctive case of gene duplication involving
the co-evolution of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes.

Methods
Database searches
The following expressed sequence tags (EST) for numit
rps13 were obtained from GenBank by BLAST searches
using numit rps13 from Arabidopsis thaliana (DR380621)
as a query: Citrus sinensis (CX672493), Malus domestica
(DR995890, CN494589, CN925904, and CX023021),
Populus trichocarpa (DT496554), Medicago truncatula
(BI272420), Glycine max (BM188020), and Gossypium hirsutum (DW488419). The following ESTs for nucp rps13
were obtained from GenBank by BLAST searches using
nucp rps13 from Arabidopsis thaliana (DR367899) as a
query: Citrus sinensis (CX053776), Glycine max
(EH261685), Gossypium hirsutum (DW226103), Malus
domestica (DT000985), Medicago truncatula (BI265445)
and Populus trichocarpa (DT486949). Mt rps13 ESTs from
Malus (CN871057 and CN875489) and Prunus persica
(AJ873687) were identified by BLAST searches of GenBank using mt rps13 from Beta vulgaris as a query. Mt rps13
genes used in this study include: Triticum aestivum

Helianthus annuus (AJ243789), Daucus carota (X54417),
Oenothera berteriana (X54416), Beta vulgaris (DQ381464)
and Marchantia polymorpha (M68929).
Sequence alignment/analysis and phylogenetic analysis
Sequence alignment was done using transAlign, which
aligns protein-coding DNA sequence based on the alignment of amino acids [51]. Aligned sequences were refined
with BioEdit [52] for further phylogenetic and codon substitution analysis (see Additional file 5). For phylogenetic
analysis, maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was conducted with MultiPhyl v1.0.6 [53] with SPR (subtree
pruning and regrafting) branch swapping. The optimal
evolutionary model selected for ML was K81uf+I+G
(Kimura three parameter with unequal base frequencies +
proportion of sites + gamma distribution) using the following parameters: assumed nucleotide frequencies A =
0.36736, C = 0.20950, G = 0.27698, T = 0.14616; expected
transition/transversion ratio = 0.94; expected pyrimidine
transition/purine transition ratio = 0.30; proportion sites
assumed to be invariable = 0.29; rates for variable sites
assumed to follow the gamma distribution with shape
parameter = 4.28. Bootstrapping was performed using
MultiPhyl v1.0.6 with neighbor-joining algorithm and
100 replicates [53].
Ka/Ks analyses and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) for positive
selection
Nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) nucleotide
substitution rates were calculated by using program yn00
in PAML v3.15 [23] (see Additional file 2). The t-test was
used for testing for significant differences of Ka, Ks, and Ka/
Ks ratios between the nucp rps13 and numit rps13 cDNA
sequences. The statistically significant level was set at
95%. The statistical analysis in this study was implemented by using the statistical package R [54].

For detection of positive selection, codon-based analysis
was implemented using codeml in PAML v3.15 [23]. The
mature coding region, without the mitochondrial targeting presequences, was included in our analysis. Site specific models were used for testing positive selection on
numit rps13 and nucp rps13 [25]. Two LRTs were used for
the detection of positive selection: M7-M8 and M8a-M8
[22,25,26]. Because comparison of M7 and M8 provides a
more powerful test of positive selection and has less sensitivity to large evolutionary distances and G+C content
than comparison of M1 and M2 [55,56], only comparison
of M7 and M8 was used for the detection of positive selection in this study. M7 and M8a models are the null models without positive selection (no codon with Ka/Ks > 1)
and the M8 model is the alternative model with positive
selection. Branch specific model was used to test if there
has been positive selection for Malus branch in numit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/25

rps13, nucp rps13, and mt rps13 [25]. For this analysis, the
branch which we are interested in testing positive selection was assigned as foreground lineage. Therefore, Malus
branch in numit rps13, nucp rps13, and mt rps13 were set
as foreground lineage and the rest of other rosid species
were designated as background lineage. For branch specific model, two LRTs were used for detection of positive
selection as follows: M1-Model A test1 (MAtest1) and
Model A test2 (MAtest2)-MAtest1 [25,26]. M1 and MAtest2
models are the null hypothesis without positive selection
(no codon with Ka/Ks > 1) and the MAtest1 model is the
alternative selection with positive selection. For site-specific and branch-specific models used for detection of positive selection, M8a is more stringent than M7 and MAtest2
is more stringent than M1 because their ω2 (Ka/Ks) is fixed
at 1. For all LRTs, the first model is simpler than the second one, with fewer parameters and poor fit to the data.
Therefore, the first model has a lower maximum likelihood index. To test if there is statistically better maximum
likelihood for the second model, twice difference of log
maximum likelihood values between the two compared
models [2δL = 2(Ln2-Ln1), where Ln1 and Ln2 represent
for log of maximum likelihood value in the first model
and the second model] was compared against χ2 distribution. The degrees of freedom (d.f.) equals to the additional parameters used in more complex model. The d.f.
is 2 for M7-M8 and M1-MAtest1, while the d.f. is 1 for M8aM8 and MAtest2-MAtest1. However, it was argued that the
appropriate model comparison for M8a-M8 would be to
use 50:50 mixture of d.f. = 0 and d.f. = 1 [22]. In this study,
the calculation of P value for M8a-M8 was followed as
described in Kapralov and Filatov [57]. P value was first
obtained using d.f. = 1 and then divided by 2. Bayes
empirical bayes (BEB) approach was used to determine
positive selected sites in M8 model and MAtest1 model. In
BEB analysis, the posterior probabilities were calculated to
select the codon with Ka/Ks greater than 1. Because BEB
analysis is more powerful to detect positive selection than
naive empirical Bayes (NEB) analysis [58], only BEB analysis was considered in this study.
Structural analysis of RPS13
Using first approach mode in SWISS-MODEL [59], nucp,
numit, and mt RPS13 amino acid sequences in Malus were
selected to search for a suitable template for further structural analysis. Based on the results, RPS13 of Escherichia
coli and Thermus thermophilus were chosen for the following structural analysis. RPS13 structural data file for E. coli
(PDB ID: 2gy9M) [60] and T. thermophilus (PDB ID:
1fjgM) [27] were obtained from RCSB Protein Data Bank
[61]. Location and property of each amino acid in E. coli
and T. thermophilus RPS13 was analyzed using DeepViewSwiss-PdbViewer v.3.7 [59]. Selected positive sites
obtained by BEB analysis and sites shared with similarity
between numit RPS13 and mt RPS13 were plotted in the

relative position of RPS13 in E. coli and T. thermophilus
according to amino acid alignment (Figure 4).
Microarray data analysis
Raw Affymetrix ATH1 microarray data [30] were downloaded from the TAIR website (TAIR accession number:
ME00319)[62]. Raw data were processed and normalized
based on the GC-RMA method [63]. The expression values were converted into log2 numbers by only considering values of perfect-match probes [63]. Normalization
and analysis of the microarray data were implemented
using Bioconductor. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to statistically compare the similarity of expression
profile among rps9, rps10, rps11, and numit rps13, and
between numit rps13 and nucp rps13. The correlation
coefficient (R) values correspond to the similarity of the
expression profile between two genes. A one-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni post hoc tests was used to test if there is a
significant expression difference between two different
genes or any two different organ types. All statistical analyses were implemented using statistical package R [54].
The statistically significant level was set at 95%.
Plant materials and abiotic stress treatments
Several organ types, including stems, leaves, peduncles,
sepals, petals, stamens, stigmas+styles, and young fruit of
apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) were collected from the
University of British Columbia's Botanical Garden. Seedlings were used for abiotic stress experiments. Prior to
sowing, apple seeds were soaked in distilled water at 4°C
for 6 weeks for vernalization. Seedlings were cultivated in
a peat-vermiculite soil mixture under fixed day/night (16
h day/8 h night) and temperature of 20–23°C. After germination and emergence from the soil for 7 days, the
plants were subjected to five different abiotic stresses: 4°C
for 7 days (cold treatment), 37–40°C for 12 hours (heat
stress), 100 mM NaCl solution for 7 days (salt treatment),
submerged in distilled water for 4 days (water submersion
treatment), and dark for 7 days (dark treatment). After
stress treatments, roots, hypocotyls, cotyledons, and
leaves were collected and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until nucleic acid extraction.
Nucleic acid extraction, gene amplification, and
sequencing
Genomic DNA extraction was done using the DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA extraction was performed as described
previously [64]. The extracted nucleic acid concentrations
and purities were determined by using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. The quality was checked by running on
1.5% agarose gels. Before reverse transcription, 3 μg of
RNA (500 μg/μl) was treated with 1 unit of DNaseI (New
England Biolabs) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min twice.
Then 4 μg of DNase-treated RNA was reverse-transcribed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/25

by using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The
reverse transcription conditions were 25°C for 10 min,
37°C for 60 min, and 70°C for 15 min. Finally, the
reverse-transcribed samples were treated with RNase (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 20 min.
The rps13 genes were amplified from genomic DNA and
cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genespecific primers (see Additional file 6). The PCR was performed in a reaction mixture (10 μl) consisting of 4.88 μl
of ddH2O, 1 μl of genomic DNA/cDNA solution, 1 μl of
PCR buffer, 1 μl of 2.5 mM MgCl2 solution, 1 μl of 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 0.5 μl of 0.4 μM each primer, and 0.12 units of
Taq DNA Polymerase (Sigma). The PCR conditions were
96°C for 4 min, and 30 cycles of 96°C for 40 s, 60°C for
40 s, 72°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and extracted from the
gel using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). PCR
products amplified from genomic DNA and cDNA were
sequenced directly. The sequencing was performed in a
reaction mixture containing 0.4 μl of ABI BigDye Version
3.1 (Applied Biosystems), 3.6 μl of BigDye buffer, 5.5 μl
of 50 ng template, and 0.5 μl of 0.4 μM forward or reverse
primer. The sequencing reaction was carried out with the
following program: 1 min at 96°C, and 25 cycle of 10 s at
96°C, 5 s at 50°C, and 4 min at 60°C. The sequencing
products were run on an ABI 377 DNA Sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) at the UBC Centre for Plant
Research, or on an ABI 3730 Sequencer at the Nucleic
Acids Protein Service unit at UBC. The GenBank accession
number for mt rps13 in Malus, including information
about RNA editing sites, is [GenBank: EU084692].
Real-time qRT-PCR
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with a BioRad iQ5 system using SYBR green master mix (BioRad)
following the manufacturer's instructions, except that
25μl total reaction volumes were used. The PCR conditions were 96°C for 3 min, and then 35 cycles of 96°C for
10 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Gene-specific primers are listed in Additional file 6. For each sample, two
technical replicates were performed. Reactions for a standard curve were run with each set of experimental reactions.
After the completion of PCR, the melting curves were analyzed to distinguish the true product from artifacts such as
primer dimers. The iQ5 software and Microsoft Excel were
used for data analysis. Normalization was done using the
actin gene ACT2. GenBank accession numbers for
sequences used to design primers are: Malus ACT2:
CN903171, CN902302, and N917499; Malus cob:
CN872477, CN856986, CN856316; Malus rps10:
CV882925.
