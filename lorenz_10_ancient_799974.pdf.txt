Abstract
Background: Expansion of multi-C2H2 domain zinc finger (ZNF) genes, including the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)
subfamily, paralleled the evolution of tetrapodes, particularly in mammalian lineages. Advances in their cataloging and
characterization suggest that the functions of the KRAB-ZNF gene family contributed to mammalian speciation.
Results: Here, we characterized the human 8q24.3 ZNF cluster on the genomic, the phylogenetic, the structural and
the transcriptome level. Six (ZNF7, ZNF34, ZNF250, ZNF251, ZNF252, ZNF517) of the seven locus members contain
exons encoding KRAB domains, one (ZNF16) does not. They form a paralog group in which the encoded KRAB and ZNF
protein domains generally share more similarities with each other than with other members of the human ZNF
superfamily. The closest relatives with respect to their DNA-binding domain were ZNF7 and ZNF251. The analysis of
orthologs in therian mammalian species revealed strong conservation and purifying selection of the KRAB-A and zinc
finger domains. These findings underscore structural/functional constraints during evolution. Gene losses in the
murine lineage (ZNF16, ZNF34, ZNF252, ZNF517) and potential protein truncations in primates (ZNF252) illustrate
ongoing speciation processes. Tissue expression profiling by quantitative real-time PCR showed similar but distinct
patterns for all tested ZNF genes with the most prominent expression in fetal brain. Based on accompanying
expression signatures in twenty-six other human tissues ZNF34 and ZNF250 revealed the closest expression profiles.
Together, the 8q24.3 ZNF genes can be assigned to a cerebellum, a testis or a prostate/thyroid subgroup. These results
are consistent with potential functions of the ZNF genes in morphogenesis and differentiation. Promoter regions of the
seven 8q24.3 ZNF genes display common characteristics like missing TATA-box, CpG island-association and
transcription factor binding site (TFBS) modules. Common TFBS modules partly explain the observed expression
pattern similarities.
Conclusions: The ZNF genes at human 8q24.3 form a relatively old mammalian paralog group conserved in eutherian
mammals for at least 130 million years. The members persisted after initial duplications by undergoing
subfunctionalizations in their expression patterns and target site recognition. KRAB-ZNF mediated repression of
transcription might have shaped organogenesis in mammalian ontogeny.

tion [1-7]. Members of the most prominent subfamily contain the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) transcriptional
repressor domain at their N-terminus [8-10]. The Krüppeltype zinc finger domain was originally identified in Xenopus laevis TFIIIA [11] and the Krüppel mutant of Drosophila melanogaster [12]. It is known as nucleic acid
interaction domain but can also contribute to protein-pro-

tein interactions [13-16]. The classical zinc finger fold consists of an approximately 30-amino acid unit of two
antiparallel β strands linked to an amphipathic α-helix with
two cysteines and two histidines coordinating a zinc ion to
stabilize the structure [17]. DNA-binding-specificity relies
on amino acids within the α-helix reaching into the major
groove of DNA [18]. According to the crystal structure of
DNA bound EGR1/Zif268, the residues most crucial for
DNA binding are localized at positions -1, 3 and 6 with
respect to the start of the α-helix. Position 2 is also involved
in DNA binding, but makes contact to the complementary
strand [13]. Zinc finger domains usually occur in arrays of
multiple C2H2 zinc finger modules comprising from only a
few up to more than thirty units [19]. The individual units
are separated by a conserved sequence (consensus TGEKP)
called HC link.
The KRAB domain was originally described as heptad
repeat of leucines in KOX1/ZNF10 [8] and shown to be
evolutionarily conserved [9], for review see [20]. The
KRAB domain of KOX1 consists of a KRAB-A and a
KRAB-B subdomain of which the KRAB-A subdomain
mediates transcriptional repression [21-23] and the KRABB part enhances the repression in conjunction with KRABA [24]. Later on, different KRAB-B subdomains with different properties have been discovered [19,25,4]. The
KRAB domain, early postulated as a protein-protein interaction domain [8], has been shown to interact with the
RBCC domain of TRIM28 (tripartite motif-containing 28,
also known as KAP-1, KRIP-1, TIF1β; reviewed in [20]).
This protein is considered essential for KRAB-mediated
transcriptional repression and recruits various chromatinmodifying protein complexes, thus leading to a repressive
chromatin state [26-28]. It is most likely that all KRAB
C2H2 zinc finger proteins mediate transcriptional repression in a sequence-specific manner. It is currently unresolved how many target genes are regulated by an
individual KRAB zinc finger protein. In case of KOX1/
ZNF10, initial knockdown experiments with KOX1 specific antisense oligonucleotides combined with transcriptome analysis argued that a KRAB-ZNF protein might
modulate the expression of 50 to 80 target genes in a direct
or indirect manner [29].
Interestingly, functions of most KRAB-ZNF genes
remain elusive so far. Recent reports showed evidence that
KRAB-ZNF genes and TRIM28 are involved in differentiation and development [30-35]. Furthermore, genetic studies
linked members of the KRAB-ZNF family to human disease [36-39].
The PFAM protein family database states that KRABZNF genes occur in all tetrapodes from amphibians to birds
and in all mammalian species (see http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/
family?entry=krab&type=Family), whereas fish species
like Fugu do not appear to encode any KRAB-ZNF genes
[3,6]. Noteworthy, less than 20 KRAB-ZNF genes are

found in the genome of amphibians (Xenopus laevis/tropicalis) compared with the human genome for which comprehensive studies list 300-400 KRAB-ZNF protein-coding
genes [4,5,40,6]. Thus, KRAB-zinc finger genes presumably coevolved with or occurred shortly after the appearance of tetrapodes and underwent a huge expansion during
mammalian evolution. It was hypothesized that KRAB-like
sequences in the histone methyltransferase Meisetz date the
origin of this domain back to the last common ancestor of
chordates and echinoderms [41]. However, this KRAB-like
domain is closely related to the KRAB-like domain of the
SSX proteins that does not interact with TRIM28 and consequently does not initiate transcriptional repression [42].
Initial mapping data on KOX zinc finger genes already
indicated that most ZNF genes are clustered in the human
genome [43]. This was confirmed by detection of 23 chromosomal KOX gene ZNF loci [44]. Numerous ZNF gene
clusters have been defined over the years [45-48,3,49] and
catalogued to a total of about 60-90 genomic loci [4,5,40],
depending on definition. Diversification of ZNF genes during evolution is reflected by duplication and deletion of
zinc finger domains thereby modifying recognition specificities for RNA/DNA binding [50,2,51]. Individual degenerate non-functional zinc finger domains do occur within a
sequence as well as after truncation by introduction of an
in-frame stop codon (reviewed for KRAB-ZNFs in [52]).
Lineage-specific expansions and losses within ZNF clusters
contribute to evolutionary adaptation [2,3,49,51,5,6].
In this manuscript we focus on the human ZNF cluster at
8q24.3 that had not been investigated in detail. It was chosen because of the presence of several KOX ZNF genes
(ZNF7/KOX4, ZNF16/KOX9 and ZNF34/KOX32) for
which we have a longstanding interest [44]. We sequenced
the locus as part of the german HUGO initiative on chromosome 8 and identified seven ZNF genes. These genes form
a paralog group well separated from other ZNF subfamilies.
We show here that subfunctionalization of the individual
members occurred through the modification of structural
properties (KRAB protein interaction domain; ZNF DNA
binding domain) as well as through fine-tuned tissue
expression patterns. Phylogenetic analysis in several mammalian species indicated strong conservation and purifying
selection of the KRAB and ZNF domains of these genes on
one hand. On the other hand, gene loss and potential protein
truncations in some species also denoted ongoing evolution. RNA expression was found to prevail in tissues with
high degree of differentiation, most notably in fetal brain.
Our investigation of the human 8q24.3 ZNF locus illustrates principles of ZNF gene evolution. The ZNF gene
family provides a rich repertoire of transcription factors
with distinct RNA/DNA binding specificities. In particular
ZNF genes encoding the KRAB transcriptional repression
domain represent a great regulatory potential to tune

expression of numerous target genes thus contributing to
the biodiversity seen in tetrapod evolution.

Results
Organization of the ZNF cluster at chromosome 8q24.3

The ZNF cluster was initially determined by chromosome
mapping of sixteen different ZNF PAC clones to genomic
locus 8q24.3 of which thirteen were specific for this locus
[44] whereas three clones showed signals of comparable
intensities on other chromosomes as well. Fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) on interphasic nuclei and molecular combing techniques allowed to approximate the size and
the organization of the 8q24.3 ZNF cluster. A first approach
on interphasic nuclei was employed to select the closer colocalizing PAC clones from the more distant mapping ones.
Two Pac clones, RP5-1109M23 and RP4-698E23 were
clearly delimiting the borders of the cluster. FISH on
combed DNA, performed with two series of three PAC
clones, confirmed the close proximity of the ZNF PAC
clones all along the cluster and allowed to estimate an
approximate size for each probe taking into account a 10%
variability for the resolution. Overall alignment lengths of
209 kb and 383 kb were obtained for RP5-1124C13/RP1291P5/RP4-718C10 and RP5-1109M23/RP4-626A24/RP4698E23, respectively (Figure 1A).
The 16 different PAC clones were aligned to genomic
sequence information confirming that 13 ZNF PAC clones
belong to one contig. The sequence of the contig is formed
by the PAC clones XX-P7B3, RP4-659B21, RP5-1056B24
and RP5-1109M23 over a total size of 430 kb (Figure 1B).
The other nine ZNF PACs cover the same region. Sequence
data analysis confirmed the exclusion of the three ambiguously mapping PAC clones from the 8q24.3 ZNF contig.
The respective lengths of the thirteen overlapping PACs
have been established and are in agreement with the data
obtained with the combed DNA. The whole 8q24.3 ZNF
contig has been filed under GenBank accession number
AF235103. Individual sequence information of the PAC
clones can also be accessed at the Genome Analysis center
in Jena http://genome.imb-jena.de under human chromosome 8q24.3 locus. The information obtained from
sequencing of the PAC clones led to the identification of
seven C2H2 Krüppel-type zinc finger genes in the 8q24.3
contig within a distance of nearly 300 kb (Figure 1B). With
respect to orientation, two genes, ZNF517 and ZNF7, show
a transcriptional direction towards the telomere whereas the
five others, namely ZNF251, ZNF34, ZNF250, ZNF16 and
ZNF252 are encoded on the complementary strand and are
transcribed towards the centromere direction.

Acembly and ENSEMBL databases resulted in the definition of transcript sequences for the seven ZNF genes. The
focus was the definition of the longest possible open reading frame, not taking into account the possibility of different splice forms. All the gene models together encompass
an approximately 282 kB piece of the qter region. The characteristics of the ZNF transcripts are given in Table 1. Out
of the seven longest open reading frames for each gene five
transcripts encode potentially functional Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domains in the setting KRAB-A and
KRAB-B. The comparison of the defined transcripts with
the human genome (see Methods section) resulted in the
description of the individual genomic organization for each
ZNF gene. The individual cDNA sequences of the gene
models can be found in the supplementary material (Additional file 1). A common theme among the seven ZNF
genes are 5' untranslated exons, the coding of the C2H2
zinc finger modules all in one exon and, in the case of the
five KRAB-containing ZNF genes, the typically separated
KRAB-A and KRAB-B exons. Concerning ZNF252, we
have been able to confirm both transcripts (see Figure 2A),
the one with four 5' untranslated upstream exons as well as
the one with only one 5' untranslated exon, by RT-PCR with
specific primers that resulted in exon spanning products
(data not shown). Both transcripts encode the same amino
acid sequences from within the last exon. Interestingly, the
amino terminus of the largest open reading frame contains a
KRAB-B domain disrupted by a stop codon and exon 2 of
the 5-exon form encodes a KRAB-A peptide. In between
resides an additional exon, unusual for KRAB-ZNF genes.
However, there is currently no evidence for a transcript that
links KRAB-A and zinc finger domains in the same open
reading frame. Noteworthy, the ZNF252 3' untranslated
region contains a row of eleven complete as well as degenerate zinc fingers motifs after the stop codon of the longest
open reading frame (see Additional file 2 for sequence).
The stop codon is confirmed in the human genome
sequence (e.g. in our PAC clone RP5-1109M23 GenBank
AC087815), in cDNA and EST sequences (e.g. AK128723,
BX505655, CD251662).
Searches for further KRAB-A, KRAB-B and C2H2
sequences on contig AF235103, besides the ones in the
above described genes, revealed (Figure 1B) a pseudogene
with potentially a complete set of KRAB-A, KRAB-B and
zinc finger sequences at the centromeric end of the cluster
(krab A1, krab B1, pseudo 1), truncated KRAB-A and
KRAB-B sequences near each other (krab A2, krab B2), an
isolated KRAB-B sequence (krab B3) and zinc finger
sequences at the telomeric end of the cluster (pseudo 2).
With the exception of krabA1 and krabB1, all these
sequences are characterized by numerous stop codons and
degenerate domain structure (nucleic acid sequences
included in Additional file 1).

The domain organization of the proteins predicted from
the gene models is presented in Figure 2B (see Additional
file 2 for amino acid sequences). The KRAB-A and -B
boxes of the five KRAB zinc finger proteins are located
near the amino terminus followed by non-conserved linker
sequences and numerous C2H2 zinc finger modules. Most
of them are in a consecutive order joined by the conserved
HC link sequences and equipped with the two cysteines and
two histidines in the correct spacing. In some circumstances
the consecutive zinc finger array is broken by gaps, e.g in
the case of ZNF251, in such a way that the twelfth finger is
isolated. In addition, some motifs are more degenerated, i.e.
they lack one of the hallmark cysteine or histidine amino
acid residues at the right position or are not complete (see
e.g. ZNF7). Comparison of the KRAB-B domains of the
8q24.3 ZNF proteins to several other KRAB-B domains
defining the KRAB AB or Ab subfamilies [19] clearly indicated that they belong to the KRAB AB subfamily (data not
shown). ZNF252 and the KRAB-less ZNF16 are characterized by considerable stretches of peptide sequence without
known conserved domain at the amino terminus followed
by consecutive zinc finger arrays of seventeen or eleven
zinc fingers, respectively.
Phylogeny of the ZNF genes in the human 8q24.3 cluster in
mammals

As a first step to analyze evolutionary conservation of the
human 8q24.3 locus we searched for orthologs in other
mammalian species by reciprocal BLAST searches and
inspection of the syntenic regions. The region syntenic to
human 8q24.3 (AF235103) in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, PanTro2) contains all seven ZNF genes defined in the
human and spans about 355 kB on chromosome 8 (bases
149.153.255-149.508.639; still numerous gaps). The gene
structures of the chimpanzee ZNF orthologs are identical to
the human ones. As expected sequence similarities between
the human and chimpanzee orthologs are very high, ranging
from 96 to 99% identity on the amino acid level (data not
shown).
The murine syntenic regions of the human 8q24.3 ZNF
region are on mouse chromosome 15 between approximately 76.682 and 76.766 Mb and on rat chromosome 7
between approximately 114.897 and 114.983 Mb. Using
various search tools like BLAST, BLAT and the
ENSEMBL database (as described in Material and Methods) and the human sequences as input, we were able to
define three likely functional orthologs for the human ZNF
genes from 8q24.3 in mouse and rat (Figures 1B, 2C). The
mouse genes were well supported by cDNA and EST
sequences. With the help of the mouse sequences we
defined the corresponding rat orthologs from genomic
sequences and adjusted the predicted gene models in GenBank for further phylogenetic examinations (see below).
The rat gene models have the disadvantage not to be built

Page 5 of 30

on cDNA sequences due to the rat cDNA/EST databases
being far less comprehensive in comparison to mouse or
human. The nucleotide and peptide sequences we introduced in the analysis are again given in Additional files 1
and 2 and cornerstones of mouse/rat 8q24.3 ZNF orthologs
are summarized in Additional file 3.
The three mouse and rat ZNF genes in the syntenic region
of human 8q24.3 are all KRAB-A and -B box-containing
genes. Like in human, KRAB-A and KRAB-B as well as
the C2H2 coding genomic sequences are organized in separate exons. Gene organization and protein structure (Figure
2B, D) clearly reflect the closely related mouse/rat ortholog
pairs and also correspond to the human ortholog. In addition to the three functional ZNF genes we found sequences
homologous to human ZNF16 in the mouse and rat regions
syntenic to human 8q24.3 by BLAT searches and HMMER
search of C2H2 domains: There are continuous stretches on
the reverse strand of the respective chromosome that are
homologous to sequences of the zinc finger exon of ZNF16.
If translated, the mouse as well as the rat genomic pieces
would result in "broken" protein sequences of canonical
mixed with degenerate C2H2 zinc fingers, disrupted by
stop codons and jumping between reading frames. These
findings support the notion, that the ZNF16 relatives in
mouse and rat are pseudogenes without functional polypeptides. HMMER searches did not unravel any other KRAB
box or C2H2 zinc finger fragments in these mouse and rat
genomic regions syntenic to human 8q24.3. The only
exception was an isolated sequence at the 3'-end of the ZNF
locus in the rat genome that would potentially encode
KRAB-B-like amino acid sequences. Since the best hit was
the dog ZNF252 KRAB-B box using BLASTp against
mammalian sequences, this might be the rat remnant of
ZNF252 (designation "rnZNF252_krab_B"; see Figure 1B;
sequences in Additional files 1, 2). Interestingly, it resides
on the opposite strand with respect to the ZNF16 pseudogene. Because of its shortness the sequence was not
included in further analyses.
Comparison of locus organization in mouse/rat and
human shows that the mouse/rat region encompassed by the
conserved non-ZNF genes RPL8 and COMMD5 is inverted
in human such that the two genes reside on the opposite
strand with ZNF7 and the human specific ZNF517 in
between (Figure 1B).
The phylogenetic analysis was extended to all orthologs
of the human 8q24.3 ZNF genes detected in respective
genome assemblies of other mammalian species, namely,
rhesus monkey, dog, cow and opossum (for nucleotide and
amino acid sequences see Additional files 1 and 2; genome
assembly references given in Methods). With respect to
ZNF16 orthologs, rhesus monkey, dog as well as cow
appear to have, like the primates, fully functional genes in
contrast to mouse and rat (see above). Since ZNF34,
ZNF517 and ZNF252 orthologs are likely to exist in other

Figure 2 Gene models (A, C) and protein domain organization (B, D) of the seven human ZNF genes at 8q24.3 (A, B) and their murine orthologs (C, D). In the gene models (A, C) exons are shown as boxes (white parts are untranslated, filled parts are translated), introns as solid lines. KRABA, KRAB-B and non-KRAB domain encoding sequences are shaded in dark blue, light blue and black, respectively. Numbers above exons/introns indicate their size (bp). Genes are drawn to scale with smaller exons additionally magnified for more detail. Introns interrupted by two perpendicular bars
are not fully drawn out. Names of genes and proteins are given on the left of each model. Mouse and rat orthologs are indicated by prefixes mm (Mus
musculus) or rn (Rattus norvegicus). * in the ZNF252 5-exon model indicates out of frame KRAB-A coding sequence, ** designates a degenerate KRABB box disrupted by a stop codon. The genes' direction of transcription is given by "+" or "-" (towards telomere or centromere, respectively). Genomic
order of the human genes is indicated by the arrow in A. Exact genomic locations are displayed for mouse and rat genes (based on UCSC assemblies
mm9 and rn4). Small arrows denote positions of presumable translational starts. Drawn to scale protein architectures (B, D) depict KRAB-A (dark blue),
KRAB-B (light blue) and C2H2 ZNF domains (numbered boxes; black boxes represent complete, grey boxes degenerate or non-canonical fingers). Only
fingers with at least two of the four conserved C2H2 residues were considered.

mammals (e.g. dog and cow for ZNF34, dog for ZNF517,
dog and opossum for ZNF252), it seems that these genes
were lost in the murine genomes.
ZNF252 in the evolution of eutheria

The peculiar open reading frame with broken KRAB
domain and premature stop codon of human ZNF252
inspired us to carry out a more detailed comparison of the
mammalian ZNF252 orthologs (Figure 3). The chimpanzee
has the same 5' exon structure as the human ZNF252, i.e.
out-of-frame KRAB-A and B exons with an additional exon
inserted in between as well as a stop codon. However, the
transcript apparently does not even encode any complete
C2H2 zinc finger since a stop codon disrupts already the
first would-be C2H2 domain between the C2 and H2 parts.

Additional stops can be found just before sequences that
would encode zinc fingers 9, 10 and 11. Thus, the chimpanzee ZNF252 protein, if expressed at all, is devoid of KRAB
effector and ZNF DNA binding domains.
By using the tool RepeatMasker (A.F.A. Smit, R. Hubley
& P. Green at http://repeatmasker.org) we found sequences
homologous to Long and Short Interspersed Elements
(LINE/SINE repeats) in the KRAB-A and the following
exon and the interjacent intron of the human and chimpanzee ZNF252 transcripts (data not shown). This raises the
possibility, that insertion of repeat sequences was responsible for the frame shift between the KRAB-A and the more
downstream protein-encoding sequences. In contrast, the
ZNF252 orthologs in rhesus monkey, dog (cDNA experimentally defined; GenBank: AJ388557) and opossum

clearly harbor a fully developed KRAB-AB domain in the
same open reading frame as the zinc fingers. In addition,
the zinc fingers of ZNF252 extend to a number of 19-22
without disruption by any stop codon. The unusual additional exon between the KRAB-A and -B exons appears to
be primate-specific. In conclusion, ZNF252 is an example
for ongoing evolution in the mammalian lineage from fully
functional KRAB zinc finger protein (e.g. dog) to residual
protein fragment without KRAB and zinc fingers (chimpanzee) with recent considerable changes occuring after the
divergence from the common ancestor of rhesus monkey
and human/chimpanzee.
Phylogenetic relationship of the human 8q24.3 cluster ZNF
genes

In order to characterize the evolutionary relationships, we
constructed phylogenetic trees after alignment of the seven
human 8q24.3 ZNF genes along with their mouse and rat
predicted orthologs. The analysis also contained the Xenopus KRAB-ZNF gene Xfin as outlier and human KRAB
zinc finger genes from different genomic locations. The latter included seven ZNFs from locus 19q13.2, recently analyzed in detail [3], as reference group for comparison and in
order to assess the stability of resulting clades. Alignments
were performed with the cDNA sequences, the total amino
acid sequences, the overall zinc finger DNA binding
domains and the KRAB effector domains of the proteins.
Phylogenetic relationships were then predicted by tree construction methods (see Methods).
The analysis of the 8q24.3 members revealed that, in general, the genes disperse into well separated clades/subclades
with long branch lengths and often with many nodes in
between (Figure 4), indicating relatively large phylogenetic
distances and thus divergence times. This was the case for
trees based on all four different alignments. In particular
ZNF16 and ZNF252 exhibit a very distant relationship to
the other 8q24.3 ZNF genes and stay closest to each other
but well separated by long branches. This behavior of the
8q24.3 ZNFs is different from the members of the human
ZNF locus at 19q13.2 that form a closed clade with much
narrower relationships. We also did a second series of analyses with extended mammalian ortholog sequences of the
human 8q24.3 ZNF genes as well as the above mentioned
pseudogene sequences at our 8q.24.3 locus. The results
were qualitatively similar to the one described above in that
the different 8q24 ZNF genes with their respective
orthologs were always clearly separated in their own clades
and not intermingling, indicating significant phylogenetic
distance from each other (see Additional file 4). With
respect to the residual ZNF sequences on the pseudogenes
named pseudo 1 and pseudo 2, the phylogenetic analysis
did not indicate close relationships to any 8q24.3 ZNF
gene.

The 8q24.3 genomic sequences encoding isolated or disrupted KRAB domains (krab A1B1, A2B2) separated in the
phylogenetic analysis of the KRAB domain from the other
genes of that locus (Figure 4D and Additional file 4D).
However, the krab A1B1 putative KRAB domain displayed
the highest score with sequence identities of 56% (36/64)
with ZNF251 when using TBLASTN. The krab A2B2
8q24.3 piece that represents a more degenerated KRAB
domain showed best matches with two predicted ZNF
genes (XM_498167 30/73 = 41%; XM_938315 28/67 =
41%) and then with ZNF7 (28/72 = 38%). Thus, these
KRAB domains, especially krab A1B1 with the nearby
pseudo1 ZNF sequence appear to be distant relatives of the
other 8q24.3 KRAB domains. They might originally have
been part of ancient locus members that lost their function
long ago.
Despite the distant relationship TBLASTN searches of
the reference human mRNA database with the different
8q24.3 ZNF protein sequences indicated that another member of the 8q24.3 locus was in general the closest relative
based on overall sequence similarity. The closest human
paralog of ZNF34 was ZNF250 (identities 268 out of 554
residues = 48%), that of ZNF517 was ZNF251 (identities
220/499 = 44%), and ZNF16's closest human relative was
ZNF252 (identities 333/677 = 49%). The most similar paralog based on TBLASTN of ZNF250, ZNF251 and ZNF7
was ZNF184 at 6p21.3, that of ZNF252 was ZNF167 at
3p22.3-p21.1. Still, 8q24.3 members were not far off with
respect to score (data not shown).
As part of the phylogenetic analysis, synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitution rates within an ortholog group
of each 8q24.3 ZNF gene were determined with focus on
the analysis of differences between the rates for the different domains, KRAB-A, KRAB-B, non-conserved linker
and zinc finger array. Estimation of these rates was carried
out using maximum likelihood (software PAML, [53,54]
see Methods). The results for the individual pairwise comparisons of the four domains for each ortholog group are
listed in Additional file 5. In order to generalize the findings, the average non-synonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios were calculated for each domain (Figure 5).
Overall, the zinc finger array of each ortholog group
showed strong purifying selection (ω = dN/dS around 0.1)
with mostly highly significant p-values. This result was not
surprising since the conserved zinc finger framework residues need to be maintained in order to adopt the correct 3D
structure. The KRAB domain appeared to be under purifying selection as well. However, our calculation argues that
the purifying evolutionary pressure was generally stronger
on the KRAB-A (ω around 0.15) compared to the KRAB-B
domain (ω around 0.4). The linker part of the ZNF genes/
proteins, which in case of the 8q24.3 ZNF sequences and
their orthologs does not contain any conserved domain, followed neutral evolution (ω near 1). When we restricted the

Figure 4 Phylogenetic relationships between the human ZNF genes from 8q24.3, their murine orthologs and other human ZNF genes. The
analysis relied on alignments of full nucleotide cDNA sequences (A), of whole polypeptide sequences (B), of the array of all C2H2 zinc finger domains
of each protein and of the KRAB domains using the neighbor-joining method. The analysis also included Xenopus Xfin as a distant outlier and as reference group seven KRAB-ZNFs from human 19q13.2 and eight KRAB-ZNFs from other genomic locations. Numbers indicate bootstrap values in percent based on 1000 replicates. To the right of the different clades the genomic localizations of the human genes are given. Note that the two KRAB
domains of presumable pseudogenes (krab A1B1, krab A2B2) within 8q24.3 as well as an artificially combined human ZNF252 KRAB domain (labeled
"art") have been added; see text for more details. Since the ZNF16 ortholog cDNAs from mouse and rat do most likely not give rise to a functional
protein, protein sequences were not included in the analyses. The full nucleotide and protein sequences are given in Additional files 1 and 2, respectively.

analysis to a stretch of sequence encoding the amino acids
that mainly determine DNA binding specificity (see next
paragraph), again, the values obtained showed strong purifying selection as for whole zinc fingers.

Comparative analysis of zinc finger DNA binding domains

Specific amino acid residues positioned in the C2H2 zinc
finger domain play a key role in determining their nucleic
acid binding specificities. Based on the EGR1/Zif268 protein-DNA crystal structure, helical positions -1, 3 and 6
with respect to the start of the α-helix are especially important for DNA-binding specificity [17]. When comparing

Figure 5 Estimation of the evolutionary selection pressure on the different domains of the ZNF genes/proteins from 8q24.3 and their orthologs. The histogram plots the average ω (= ratio between dN, the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site, and dS,
the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) for each domain, KRAB-A, KRAB-B, linker (LINK) and zinc finger array (ZNF, the consecutive sequence of all C2H2 zinc fingers of the gene/protein) of the ZNF genes/proteins. The data labeled 7AA DBD only consider the sequences -2 to
6 with respect to the a-helix of each C2H2 zinc finger for analysis, except for conserved position 4. The ω values of smaller than 1, equal to 1 or larger
than 1 refer to negative purifying selection, neutral evolution or positive selection, respectively. Error bars represent the respective standard deviations.
The means of the different domains were statistically compared by a T-test, the asterisks indicate the high significance (p < 0.0001).

these important residues along each group of orthologs
(from opossum to human, as available), it became immediately evident, that they are highly conserved (see graphical
depiction in Additional file 6). Analysis of the mutational
trends in this region of the α-helix between the 8q24.3 ZNF
paralogues should help to clarify likely duplication scenarios and functional, i.e. nucleic acid binding residue, variability. To that purpose, principal component analysis of the
conservation profile of the individual zinc finger sequences
was performed. The analysis is based on the multiple alignment of the region encompassing the 8-residue long
stretches from positions -2 to 6 with respect to the α-helix
of each C2H2 zinc finger. Principal component analysis
identifies new axes in a multiple alignment matrix by
weighting positions with high co-variation and deemphasizing positions that show little co-variation with other positions. Positions in the stretch of binding residues most
tightly connected with one another thus reflect correlated
mutations that are under evolutionary selection and are
more likely to be important for nucleic acid binding. The
first principal component, plotted on the x-axis of Figure

6A, contains position 6 (weight -0.82) and the correlated
position 5 (weight -0.44). The second principal component,
plotted on the y-axis, is based on position -2 (-0.92) and 1 (0.27). For both axes, zinc-finger domains sharing the prevalent amino acids in the respective positions are in the negative and genes with mutations in these positions in the
positive regions. The sequences assigned to the different
regions with the plotted matrix values are given in Additional file 7. Region I contains all zinc finger domains with
a significantly overrepresented motif S [Q, R]S---IQ (a
dash stands for any amino acid) with frequencies S(49%),
[Q(35%), R(19%)], S(45%), I(44%), and Q(49%). S-----IQ
is found in nearly all 8q13.4 genes (only ZNF7 has the
mutational variant R-----IQ). The subgroups in region I represent the motif SQ----IQ present in individual zinc fingers
of human/mouse/rat ZNF250, human ZNF16, ZNF34 and
ZNF252, and its relative, the motif SR----IQ present in
human/mouse/rat ZNF251 as well as human ZNF517 zinc
fingers. Region I also includes the motif S-S---IQ found in
C2H2 domains of human/mouse/rat ZNF251, and human
ZNF34 and ZNF16. In zinc finger domains of region II the

serine is still at position -2; however, mutations in positions
5 and 6 have occurred (e.g. zinc fingers ZNF7-12 SQ----IY,
ZNF7-2 SD----KH, while in region III the serine at -2 is
lost, but the IQ at position 5 and 6 is conserved (e.g. ZNF74 RL----IQ). As expected, residues in the binding region of
the 8q24.3 zinc finger domains are frequently modified to
alter or refine their binding specificity; yet, specific amino
acids at positions -2, 1 and 5, 6 are significantly overrepresented in the 8q23.4 sub-family of zinc fingers pointing to a
common conserved framework of DNA binding.
Multiple alignments are a means to compare and relate
zinc finger domains. However, the search for the best alignment is often complicated if different numbers of the highly
conserved zinc finger motif are present in the sequences to
be aligned. Therefore, we sought an alternative way to compare zinc finger sequence similarity and thus DNA binding
specificity: We computed ZNF motif matrices for each
8q24.3 ZNF gene based on the codon-aligned individual
zinc finger sequences (see Methods). These matrices were
then used to calculate a pairwise similarity table between
the genes (Figure 6B). The results argued that the closest
relatives with respect to their DNA binding domain were
ZNF7 and ZNF251. Yet several other similarities were not
that far off, e.g. those between ZNF250 and ZNF16, ZNF7
and ZNF16 and ZNF34 and ZNF16. In contrast ZNF252
and ZNF517 exhibited the most distantly related matrices.
In order to define the closest paralogs in human with
respect to the ZNF domain we extended the analysis to all
human C2H2 genes in the SysZNF database [40]. The computed pairwise similarity tables were used to construct ZNF
similarity networks. The graphical display allowed us to
visualize the closest paralogs with respect to ZNF matrix
similarity in a cluster-wise fashion. In order to avoid overcrowding and pinpoint the closest relationships between
ZNF genes we limited the network by chosen thresholds.
With a threshold of 2.01 we found five of the seven 8q24.3
genes (ZNF7, ZNF16, ZNF34, ZNF250, ZNF251) within
one sparse isolated cluster of the network construction (Figure 6B). In this cluster another member of the locus was
always nearest neighbor as indicated by the similarity values. Thus, no other human ZNF gene was found that was
more closely related in the ZNF domain. The cluster contained two additional ZNF genes with close similarities,
ZSCAN12 from chromosome 6 (NCBI GeneID:9753) and
ZNF623 (GeneID:9831) that, interestingly, is located
upstream not far from our 8q24.3 locus at approximately
144.8 Mb. ZNF517 and ZNF252 are missing from the cluster and have closest relationships in their ZNF matrix with
ZNF324B (GeneID:388569, at 19q13.43; similarity 2.466)
and ZNF184 (GeneID:7738, at 6p21.3; similarity 2.189).
As reference group we looked at the genes from cluster
19q13.2 again. They too were grouped within one cluster
(Figure 6C) and displayed higher ZNF matrix similarities
among themselves than the 8q24.3 sequences. The closer

Page 14 of 30

relationship within the group was also obvious from the
higher interconnectivity, i.e. the gene nodes had a higher
number of connecting edges. Thus, despite clear divergence, the analyses of the ZNF DNA binding domains provide evidence for a common evolutionary history of the
8q24.3 zinc finger genes.
Tissue expression profiles of the ZNF genes in the 8q24.3
cluster

The profiling of expression signatures provides a means to
functionally compare the transcription regulatory sequences
of the 8q24.3 ZNF genes. Therefore we recorded the gene
expression profiles of the 8q24.3 ZNF genes in twentyseven human tissues by quantitative RT-PCR and compared
them to those of ZNF genes at other chromosomal localizations (Figure 7, see also individual data in Additional file
8). We also included the analysis of the KRAB-ZNF corepressor gene TRIM28 and the housekeeping gene
GAPDH. Each gene-specific assay gives a measure of the
relative expression in the different tissues (fold changes
with respect to the value in heart tissue that was set to 1).
Transcripts of all 8q24.3 ZNF genes turned out to be detectable in all tissues, though, the results indicated overall
strong expression differences in individual tissues for most
of the genes. For the 8q24.3 genes the smallest overall deviations between tissues were seen with ZNF517 (maximal
factor of 13.5: lung 0.36 and thyroid 4.86), whereas the
highest differences were observed with ZNF251 (maximal
factor of 358: heart 1 and fetal brain 358.31). Interestingly,
in most cases the maximal relative expression levels of the
8q24.3 ZNF genes were reached in fetal brain, testis, cerebellum and thyroid. On the other hand, the 8q24.3 ZNF
genes were generally the least abundant in heart, liver, fetal
liver and lung. Noteworthy, similar expression profiles
were also observed for the non-8q24.3 ZNF genes tested
but not for the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Visual inspection of the profiles led us to subgroup the ZNF genes into 3
groups, based on tissues with the highest expression. ZNF7
and ZNF16 fell into the testis group, ZNF34, ZNF250 and
ZNF251 into the cerebellum group and ZNF252 into the
prostate/thyroid group. These expression signatures may
hint at more prominent roles of these genes in the respective
tissues. ZNF517 was left unassigned since overall expression changes were relatively small compared to the other
genes. With respect to TRIM28 we recorded a profile that
parallels the testis subgroup of ZNF expression signatures,
yet the absolute expression changes between tissues were
smaller (maximal factor ~ 30: liver 0.49, testis 14.65).
Since relative quantification of the number of transcript
molecules was performed, absolute differences in expression levels between different genes could only be estimated
by the values of the respective threshold cycles (Ct; lower
values mean higher number of starting RNA molecules;
note the exponential relationship). Assuming similar PCR

finger genes compared to those of ten other C2H2 zinc finger genes, the KRAB domain-interacting partner TRIM28 and of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Relative expression levels with the respective value for heart tissue set to 1 were determined with gene-specific assays by quantitative RT-PCR.
The ordinate displays fold changes compared to heart. The different tissues as source for total RNA are labeled with letters and are indicated on the
bottom of the bar plots. The maximal fold change between the tissue with the highest and the lowest values is indicated in the histograms ("max").
Bars represent means of three replicates ± SD within one assay. The profiles are arranged in subgroups: Strong overrepresentation in fetal brain compared to all other tissues ("fetal brain group"); values in testis similar or larger to those in fetal brain ("testis group"), prominent thyroid and prostate
expression ("prostate/thyroid group"); highest expression in thymus ("thyroid group"); at least 50fold increased expression in cerebellum compared
to heart and ratio fetal brain/cerebellum < 3.5 ("cerebellum group"). ZNF517 was unassigned, TRIM28 and GAPDH were put into a non-ZNF group.

Lorenz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:206

efficiencies, the RT-PCR data indicate that transcripts of all
8q24.3 ZNF genes were much less abundantly expressed
than those of TRIM28 or GAPDH (see Additional file 8 for
the primary quantitative PCR data). In heart tissue, e.g.,
most 8q24.3 ZNF gene transcripts were detectable at Ct
values between 30 and 31 whereas TRIM28 and GAPDH
displayed values of 22.9 and 19.13, respectively. In testis,
the 8q24.3 ZNF RNAs were detected earlier at Ct values of
about 24-26, demonstrating the higher expression in this
tissue. Here, TRIM28 and GAPDH were detectable at Ct 19
and 19.6, respectively.
The different gene expression patterns were compared
using hierarchical cluster analysis. Clustering was done for
the genes under study as well as for the different tissues
(values for distance measures are given in Additional files 9
and 10). As noted above, we observed overall high similarities of the ZNF expression profiles. Expression of 8q24.3
and non-8q24.3 ZNF genes is similar, but different from a
group of unrelated genes (see Additional file 10). The heatmap in Figure 8 visualizes the results for the ZNF genes.
Based on gene expression similarity clustering different
subgroups can be identified, corresponding to the manually
compiled ones in Figure 7. The genes of our 8q24.3 locus
spread into several well-separated clades. Among the locus
members, ZNF250 and ZNF34 displayed the closest tissue
expression profiles. Furthermore, ZNF251 was the next
related ZNF gene of 8q24.3. Similarly, ZNF16 and ZNF7
were closest neighbors. ZNF252 is the most distant with
respect to the other 8q24.3 ZNF genes. This more distant
relationship is indicated by a lower expression in cerebellum and a higher expression in prostate and thyroid. This
places ZNF252 into a clade with ZNF136 and ZNF224. The
data implicate that many KRAB-ZNF genes display similar
tissue expression profiles. Genes from the same genomic
locus with close profiles like ZNF250/ZNF34 or ZNF16/
ZNF7 might share common regulatory sequences.
Considering tissue clustering, fetal brain and testis separate most from the other tissues. The latter fall into three tissue groups: Group I with usually high expression comprises
prostate, thyroid, thymus, cerebellum and kidney. Group II
with usually low expression consists of pancreas, salivary
gland, liver, heart, fetal liver, lung and placenta. Group III
shows moderate expression compared to the others. In
terms of the three germ layers there does not seem to be
overrepresentation of a particular one in a group. Still, the
tissues are made up of different cell types and it remains
unknown which cell types contribute most to the ZNF
expression levels.
Sequence similarity implies expression profile similarity

We compared the four different sequence similarity matrices with the expression profile similarity matrices. We concentrated on those KRAB domain encoding genes that are
also included in the phylogenetic sequence comparisons

Page 16 of 30

(Figure 4). The results are summarized in Table 2. The three
columns correspond to all sixteen ZNF genes, 8q24.3 and
non-8q24.3 genes, respectively. Generally, there is a moderate, but nevertheless significant, positive correlation
between sequence and expression profile similarities. Considering all sixteen genes, the ZNF domain sequence similarity correlates best with gene expression similarity (0.42).
Interestingly, the correlation between sequence and expression similarity is highest for the six 8q24 KRAB-ZNF
genes. This holds for all four different sequence similarities
(all four rows), but is most striking for the KRAB domain
sequence. So we conclude that KRAB-ZNF genes from the
8q24.3 locus with similar KRAB domain sequence have a
very similar expression profile implying involvement in
connected biological processes.
Computational comparison of the promoter regions of the
seven human 8q24.3 ZNF genes

To investigate if expression profile similarities were due to
promoter similarities (same transcription factor binding
sites (TFBS)), we analyzed the proximal promoter regions
of the seven ZNF genes for (i) general properties and especially (ii) common TFBS (see Methods for details).
The basic characteristics of the seven promoter regions
are summarized in Table 3 (promoter sequences are given
in Additional file 11): With the exception of ZNF34 the
ZNF genes exhibit more than one major transcriptional start
site (TSS) in the analyzed regions, three of them even four.
The promoter regions overlap with CpG islands and experimentally defined binding regions of the RNA polymerase II
core enzyme (see Additional file 12). Concerning classical
core promoter elements, the seven ZNF promoter regions
do neither contain classical Initiator (INR) elements, nor a
TATA-box, a downstream promoter element (DPE) or a
TFIIB recognition element (BRE) in a typcial configuration
in relation to a TSS. Interestingly, an INR-DPE module can
be found in the ZNF34 promoter region, although in an
atypical constellation upstream of the TSS. The motif ten
element (MTE), originally identified in Drosophila appears
to act synergistically with INR [55]. Though lacking the
INR, the ZNF34 promoter region displays this element in a
typical position downstream of the TSS. Also the promoter
regions of ZNF7, ZNF16 and ZNF517 show such an element less than 50 bp from the default location (for a
detailed list of the sequence elements see Additional file
13). Finally, an X core promoter element (XCPE1) is found
properly spaced to a TSS in the ZNF16 and ZNF252 promoter regions. This element can utilize free TATA-binding
protein or the complete TFIID complex, usually in TATAless genes and in conjunction with sequence-specific transcriptional activators [56].
Next we looked for common sequence-specific TFBS
among the promoter regions of the seven ZNF genes. We
searched for predefined functional transcription factor mod-

ules using Genomatix ModelInspector (see Methods). This
approach is based on the occurrence of usually two combined TFBS that have been experimentally shown to be
functionally connected [57]. This strategy increases the
likelihood to detect TFBS of biological relevance. Using a
simple counting strategy on the thus obtained data we found
eight module families that were shared in at least three of
the seven ZNF promoter regions (Table 4; further details in
Additional file 14). The lowest number of common mod-

ules was found in the ZNF34 promoter region. The eight
module families cover 46 out of a total of 93 defined individual modules. The module families ETSF_SP1F,
EGRF_SP1F and SP1F_ETSF occurred in six of the seven
analyzed sequences. Certain families of TFBS like SP1-,
ETS- und EGR-families occurred with high frequency in
these modules. In order to pinpoint the involved elements
we separated the eight module families into TFBS families
and individual TFBS (Table 5). The most frequent TFBS

from the modules, found in all seven promoter regions,
were SP1 recognition sites. Almost as prominent was a
motif for EGR1 that occurred in six regions. TFBS recognized by the ETS family of transcription factors were also
frequent. However, the motifs belonged to three different
family members, SPI1, ELK1 and Ets-1. Finally, modules
contained recognition sites for AP-2 alpha and IKZF1 in
five and four promoter regions, respectively. A graphical
overview of the TFBS in the modules as well as the core
promoter elements is shown in Additional file 15.
Summarizing, our analysis shows that the proximal promoter regions of the seven 8q24.3 ZNF genes share core
promoter properties like association with CpG islands and
being TATA-less. Common TFBS modules could partly
explain expression similarity of the ZNF genes.

Discussion
Transcription factors are key elements in orchestrating gene
expression programs with respect to development and differentiation and in response to the environment. A recent
census of human transcription factors stated that out of
approximately 1700-1900 transcription factor genes
roughly 700 encode C2H2 zinc finger domains including,
with a number of about 400, the largest subgroup of all, the
KRAB-ZNF proteins [7]. There is evidence to suggest that
KRAB zinc finger genes and thus KRAB-mediated transcriptional repression initially accrued 360 million years
ago at a time when the first tetrapod/amphibian genomes
were established [3]. The ZNF family continuously grew
during phylogenesis with particular emphasis on the mammalian and therein the primate lineage, with often lineagespecific expansions [2,58,59,51,5,6,60]. The expansions are

considered the result of repeated tandem gene duplication
followed by diversification. Gene duplication is a key
mechanism in driving evolution by providing opportunities
for the selection of new phenotypes. Upon duplication the
gene copies might diversify, thus developing new functionalities (neo- or subfunctionalization), they might contribute
to genetic robustness or one of the copies might be lost (for
review see [61]). Neo- and subfunctionalization can be
brought about on different levels: Mutations in protein coding sequences may confer novel properties e.g. for transcription factors altered DNA binding sites and thus
modified target gene lists. Changes in regulatory regions
may lead to quantitative and qualitative expression differences like altered tissue expression profiles. A recent study
on a large set of human transcription factors supports these
notions [62]. Both, positive selection between paralogs for
altered C2H2 zinc finger DNA binding domains [59,6] as
well as diversification of the expression patterns between
paralogs [51] has been shown for the (KRAB) ZNF family.
In a study of coding sequence polymorphisms identified in
humans compared to chimpanzee, the KRAB zinc finger
gene family was classified as having an excess of rapidly
evolving genes, with an enrichment for positively selected
genes [63].
Here we focused on the human 8q24.3 zinc finger cluster
comprising seven members near the telomere. Our phylogenetic analysis in mammals revealed both, considerable evolutionary pressure to keep effector domain structure as well
as ongoing evolution: Purifying selection on the KRAB and
the zinc finger domains, including the major residues influencing DNA binding specificity were indications of the
conservation in mammals and thus a likely functional

importance of the 8q24.3 ZNF genes in biological processes. Evolutionary constraints on the zinc finger region
and purifying selection between orthologs has been generally noted for the C2H2 family [6]. In contrast, the lack of
functional ZNF16, ZNF34, ZNF252 and ZNF517 ortholog
genes in the rodent lineages pointed to persisting evolutionary dynamics. ZNF252 is of particular interest. It appears
that even within the primate lineage it can encode a fully
functional KRAB-ZNF protein (in rhesus monkey), a protein with a disrupted KRAB domain and truncated C2H2
zinc fingers (in human) or only a remnant without KRAB
and ZNF sequences (in chimpanzee). Sequences homologous to LINE/SINE repeats in the human and chimpanzee
orthologs might be responsible for the disruption of the
open reading frame in the 5' part. ZNF16 remained the only
8q24.3 locus member without evidence of containing a
KRAB domain in a mammalian species.
Since human C2H2 ZNF genes probably originated from
common ancestors as products of gene duplication, they
most likely retained common structural and transcriptional
regulatory features that should be apparent in the family
members of established ZNF clusters. Our alignments/tree
building, reciprocal database searches and ZNF domain
characteristics revealed that the ZNF genes from 8q24.3
generally share higher similarities to members of their own
locus than to ZNF genes in other genomic loci. Thus, the
seven ZNF genes comprise the closest paralogs for each
other. They appear to form a rather remote genomic locus
without close ties to other ZNF clusters. Furthermore, in
contrast to other clusters, e.g. the one at the 19q13.2 locus
described before [3] and used as an outlier group in the
present study, the 8q24.3 ZNF genes show considerably
less phylogenetic relatedness within the cluster. One expla-

nation for this relative distance within 8q24.3 could be that
duplication events leading to the paralogs happened quite
early in mammalian evolution, most likely more than 130
million year ago before the split of Theria and Eutheria.
The high degree of conservation in dog, cow, mouse/rat and
human in combination with the location in syntenic regions
argues that the 8q24.3 ZNF locus is as old as the Eutheria.
The robustness of at least three members of this locus
(ZNF7, ZNF250, ZNF251) is probably due to essential
functions that are conserved during mammalian evolution.
The ZNF252 ortholog found in the marsupial opossum
raises the likelihood that the locus existed even before in
the Theria. The fact that we were currently unable to define
other orthologs in opossum is probably due to the preliminary state of the genome assembly of this species. Without
data from other phylogenetically older species than mammals it is difficult to assess which gene might have been
descended from a more ancestral gene. Furthermore, it
remains unclear from which ancestral locus the 8q24.3
locus originally derived.
Expression profiles are indirect means for the comparison
of regulatory regions of different genes. The recorded tissue
expression profiles of the 8q24.3 ZNF genes showed overall relatively similar patterns in that mostly the same tissues
displayed the highest or lowest relative expressions, respectively. This implies common regulatory principles, e.g. similar cis-acting elements or transacting factors. Yet,
subgroups could be distinguished, too. A possible subspecialization after duplication, while still showing overlap or
even redundancy, was conceivable. In order to gain insights
into the gene control regions of the seven 8q24.3 ZNF
genes we performed a computational comparison of their
proximal promoter regions with focus on common proper-

ties and elements. There was evidence that the promoters
can be classified as TATA-less and CpG island-associated
as well as (with the exception of ZNF34) displaying multiple start points for transcriptional initiation. Thus, they
would mostly fit a class of core promoters dubbed "dispersed" that are evolutionary younger and more common in
vertebrates and whose exact mechanisms of regulation by
transcription factors are less understood than those of the
class termed "focused" [55]. The most prominent individual
TFBS module discovered in six of the seven ZNF promoter
regions (not in that of ZNF16), was made up of EGR1 and
SP1, both C2H2 zinc finger proteins. The two factors have
been shown to be able to act reciprocally on promoters in
this module configuration, i.e. SP1 as transactivator and
EGR1 as repressor [64]. The interrelationship between
these two factors was also shown by in vivo occupancy
changes in genome-wide studies during monocytic differentiation [65]. SPI1, an ETS-domain transcription factor
also known as PU.1 and with essential functions during
hematopoiesis [66], was found as part of modules in five
ZNF promoter regions. Interestingly, genome-wide experimental investigation of SP1, EGR1 and SPI1 binding sites
in the above mentioned cell model of monocytic differentiation [65,67] corroborated the potential functionality of
most of our bioinformatically determined sites: We
accessed the data through the online genome explorer of the
Genome Network Platform http://genomenetwork.nig.ac.jp/
. The transcription factor occupancies represented there
indicate e.g. binding of SP1, EGR1 and SPI1 to the
ZNF251, ZNF250 and ZNF252 promoter regions, but not to
that of ZNF16. This coincides with our predictions. SP1 is a
ubiquitously expressed transcription factor involved in
many processes through transcriptional regulation of
numerous genes [68]. The immediate-early response gene
EGR1/Zif268 also has been implicated in many processes.
In light of the strong expression of 8q24.3 ZNF genes in
fetal brain and also cerebellum it is noteworthy that EGR1
was described to also play a role in spatial memory [69].
Since transcription factors have a high potential for functional pleiotropy based on broadly defined DNA binding
specificity, crosstalk with each other and dependence on
cell and tissue specific influences, it will be pivotal to determine the roles of the TFBS detected in the 8q24.3 ZNF
genes experimentally. The closest pairs with respect to their
expression patterns were ZNF34/ZNF250 and ZNF16/
ZNF7 (see cluster analysis in Figure 8 and expression similarity calculations in Additional file 10). Our analyses of
the proximal promoter regions revealed that ZNF34 shares
one TFBS module with ZNF250 and ZNF16 shares two
TFBS modules with ZNF7 (see Table 4). This could partly
explain expression similarity, but regulatory elements from
outside the proximal promoter regions might also contribute. Furthermore, other regulatory principles like chromatin
organization or regulation by small RNAs might also play a

Page 22 of 30

role. A next step for further elucidation would be an analysis of the expression profiles of the corresponding transcription factors.
Surprisingly, KRAB-ZNF genes from other genomic loci
exhibited similar tissue signatures as well, raising the possibility that there are underlying causes for these patterns of
ZNF genes. It is generally assumed that higher expression
of a gene in one compared to another tissue points to a more
important function in the tissue with the more prominent
transcript levels and may be connected to tissue function
[70,71]. Thus, our recorded profiles especially emphasize
fetal brain and, for particular genes of the familiy, also testis, cerebellum, prostate and thyroid as tissues in which the
examined ZNF genes might serve important roles (see Figures 7, 8). Interestingly, tissues like heart and liver display
consistently low levels of expression of the seventeen tested
ZNF genes. Therefore, one might infer that (KRAB) ZNF
proteins are predominantly influencing morpho-/organogenic processes of organs such as the brain that have been
more strongly modified during tetrapode to primate evolution than liver and heart.
Fetal brain is a tissue undergoing complex developmental
differentiation processes, notably neurogenesis. Testis as
well is characterized by a major differentiation program,
spermatogenesis. Both tissues display, compared to other
tissues, above average features of transcriptional regulation:
Fetal brain and testis belong to the tissues with the highest
number of alternative splicing events [72], testis tissue
expresses a large number of tissue-specific exons [73] and
has the highest frequency of tissue-specific putative alternative promoters [74]. A recent detailed global transcriptome
analysis of human mid-fetal brain regions revealed a high
percentage of expressed genes with a large number of specific gene expression and alternative splicing patterns [75].
The transcript patterns corresponded to anatomical and
functional subdivisions of brain. C2H2 ZNF genes were
sometimes also found to be enriched in some fetal brain
regions. With respect to the 8q24.3 ZNF locus, most members were not scored as over/underrepresented in a particular brain region. Only ZNF250, along with at least 15 other
C2H2 ZNF genes, was underexpressed in thalamus tissue
compared to average expression in other regions. Prominent cell types of testis comprise the epithelial Sertoli cells,
the androgen producing Leydig cells and the developing
germ cells, the spermatocytes. The latter cells display transcriptional properties that are conceptually different from
somatic cells: Distinctive features include use of alternative
promoters, alternate starts sites, use of alternate transcription factors, altered genome packaging and arrest of transcription during spermatogenesis [76]. Involvement of
KRAB-ZNF proteins in spermatogenesis can be inferred
from the fact that their co-repressor protein TRIM28 was
shown to be required for the maintenance of this process in
mouse [31]. In addition to reports on prominent expression

Lorenz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:206
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/206

of KRAB-ZNF genes in testis in embryos and adults [7781], there is accumulating evidence that KRAB-ZNF genes
play a role in sex determination, spermatogenesis and
imprinting [35,81]. We therefore assume that KRAB zinc
finger genes/proteins play especially important roles in differentiation processes in fetal brain and testis, e.g. by
switching off distinctive target genes in distinct temporal
and spatial patterns. In this respect it is noteworthy that
KRAB-ZNF genes can be found in expression signatures of
stem cells and change in response to reprogramming and
Oct4 knock-down [82-84]. A recent publication provided
even evidence for the mouse KRAB-ZNF protein ZFP809
as a stem-cell-specific retroviral restriction factor [85].
Comparison of sequence similarities with expression pattern similarities uncovered higher positive correlations for
the 8q24.3 locus KRAB-ZNF group than for the more heterogeneous non-8q24.3 group (see Table 2). They probably
reflect the closer phylogenetic relationships in the 8q24.3
group. Notably, cDNA and KRAB domain similarity correlations deviate a lot between the two groups. These findings
imply that sequences within the cDNA and in particular
those encoding the KRAB domain of the 8q24.3 genes are
somehow involved in specifying the expression profiles
observed. It is probably more likely that cis-regulatory
sequences near the KRAB-encoding exons rather that the
KRAB exon sequences themselves contribute to this phenomenon. Such surrounding sequences might form an evolutionary linked unit with the KRAB exons.
Expression profiling is constrained by the samples and
methodologies that are being used. As in many published
studies on human tissue-specific expression analyses (e.g.
[70,51,72]) we depended on commercial RNA samples
from human materials that represented pools from different
individuals. With respect to the methods, the amplicons our
quantitative PCR relied on do not likely interrogate all possible transcripts of a gene nor do they necessarily measure
the same isoforms that are measured by microarray applications. A polyA-based priming step in many labeling protocols for microarray hybridization is an example: It leads to
a considerable 3' bias [29]. Sensitivity of quantitative PCR
exceeds that of the classical microarray platforms [86].
High sensitivity is of particular interest for the robust detection of (KRAB) ZNF transcripts which are often low abundant. Therefore, despite the wealth of published gene
expression data, problems of bias and sensitivity affect the
expression profiling of (KRAB) ZNF genes and result in an
incomplete picture of their transcript patterns in cells and
tissues. Detailed, high sensitive profiling of all transcripts
of a (KRAB) ZNF gene will be instrumental in understanding their spatial and temporal patterns of expression. As for
most other members of the ZNF superfamily, information
on the proteins and function of the 8q24.3 ZNF genes is
scarce. One study discovered a complex of human ZNF7
protein with autoantigen L7 and ribosomal protein S7 [87].

Page 23 of 30

ZNF16 was proposed to have a role in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and to harbor a transactivation
domain N-terminally to the zinc finger domain [88,89].
Another report associated ZNF250 with cell proliferation
[90]. Recently, a localization study on endogenous mouse
ZNF250/Zfp647 uncovered a novel type of nucleoplasmic
body containing KRAB-ZNF proteins and TRIM28 in differentiated cells [91].

Conclusions
In summary, our analysis characterizes the six KRAB and
one KRAB-less members of the human 8q24.3 C2H2-ZNF
locus as an old mammalian paralog group that probably
already existed around the split of theria and eutheria 130
million years ago. Subfunctionalization of a more ancient
presumable ancestor(s) included modified DNA binding
specificities and qualitative and quantitative expression differences. Ongoing evolution is evident from the loss of four
orthologs in the murine lineage and truncations of one
member in primate species. This raises the question what
the primary functions of the lost/truncated genes might be
that turned out to be dispensable in some species. The measured gene expression profiles highlight in particular fetal
brain as a primary tissue that utilizes KRAB-ZNF gene
functions. We assume that expanded and altered target gene
repertoires in conjunction with diversified expression patterns of the KRAB zinc finger protein family in general
contributed to amelioration of differentiation and developmental programmes during speciation. The expansion of
KRAB-ZNF genes in mammalian evolution resulted in an
increase in diversity and complexity of transcriptional gene
regulation by modulating and modifying gene expression
signatures from cell type to cell type in space and time.
Methods
Fine-mapping of ZNF gene cluster on human chromosome
8q24.3

FISH techniques were employed to fine-map PAC clones
assigned to human chromosome 8q24.3 [44]: The apparent
colocalization of the PAC clones on chromosome 8q24.3
was analyzed using two or three differently labeled probes
on interphasic nuclei to obtain a relative order. In a second
approach using molecular combing technologies, genomic
DNA was obtained from a control lymphoblastoid cell line.
Cells were embedded in low-melting agarose blocks (106
cells per block equivalent to 6 μg of DNA)[92]. DNA was
diluted to approximately 1.5 μg/ml in 400 mM MES-NaOH
pH5.5 (Sigma). Combing was performed using the Molecular Combing Apparatus™ (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France
and Genomic Vision) on silanized surfaces[92]. Each probe
(1 μg) was labeled by random priming (Bioprime DNA
labeling system, Invitrogen) either with fluorescein-11dUTP (FluoroGreen, Amersham), digoxigenin-11-dUTP
(Roche Diagnostics) or biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen) and

purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).
Nine hundred nanograms of each probe were competed
with 12-fold excess human Cot-1 DNA (1mg/ml; GibcoBRL). Hybridisation was performed as previously
described [92,93]. Biotinylated, digoxigenin- and fluorescein-labeled probes were detected with AMCA, Texas Red
and fluorescein respectively, using four or five successive
layers of antibodies as follows: (1) and (3) AMCA-avidin
(diluted 1:10; Vector Laboratories) + Texas Red-conjugated
mouse anti-digoxigenin (1:50; Jackson ImmunoResearch) +
rabbit anti-fluorescein (1:10; Molecular Probes); (2) and (4)
biotinylated goat anti-avidin (1:50; Vector Laboratories)
digoxigenin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10; Roche
Diagnostics) + fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:10; Valbiotech); (5) AMCA-avidin (diluted 1:10; Vector
Laboratories) + Texas-Red-conjugated mouse anti-digoxigenin (1:50; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Signals were
observed under an epifluorescence Leica DMRB microscope and captured with IPLab Spectrum-SU2 software
(Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA) using an NU 200 CCD
camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA). Image analyses
were performed with CartographiX software (X. Michalet,
Institut Pasteur, Paris, France and Genomic Vision).
Sequencing and genomic sequence assembly

The complete sequences of 13 ZNF PAC clones belonging
to the chromosome 8q24.3 ZNF contig (see Figure 1) are
available in the Jena databases http://genome.imb-jena.de/.
For genomic sequencing, the PACs were nebulized and subcloned into M13mp18 vector [94]. At least 3000 plaques
were selected from each clone library and shotgun
sequenced using dye-termination, ThermoSequenase
(Amersham) and universal M13-primer (MWG Biotech).
The gels were run on ABI-377 sequencers and data were
assembled and edited using the GAP4 Program [95]. Initial
genomic DNA sequence analysis was performed using the
automated sequence annotation system RUMMAGE [96].
The final assembly is represented in GenBank accession
numbers AF186192 and AF235103.
In order to look for all KRAB-A, KRAB-B and C2H2
zinc finger domains in the human 8q24.3 region the
sequence from GenBank accession AF23513 was subjected
to HMMER version 2 search http://hmmer.janelia.org/ with
the matrices defining the KRAB-A and C2H2 zinc finger
domains taken from PFAM http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/; [97]) and KRAB-B by the HMMBUILD part
of the HMMER program with an alignment of KRAB-B
taken from known sequences [19]. Only hits with scores
higher than 5 and E-values smaller than 0.0001 were considered.
Analysis of gene models and orthologs

Originally defined gene sequences and gene models
obtained during sequence assembly (see above) were used

Page 24 of 30

to do in-depth searches in various public databases. NCBI
BLASTn http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ was used
to find cDNA and EST sequences in GenBank that belong
to a particular gene model and to find exon/intron borders
in the genomic sequences of the NCBI genome build 36.1.
In parallel using either previously defined cDNA sequences
or GenBank accession numbers the resources ENSEMBL
and
Acembly
http://
http://www.ensembl.org
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/
were
accessed to compare gene models. Furthermore the BLAT
search algorithm of the UCSC genome browser was used to
find the best alignments in the human genome http://
genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat. All the information was
integrated into building gene models for seven C2H2 zinc
finger genes on 8q24.3 that represented in general the longest open reading frame supported by cDNAs and ESTs.
The exact position of the gene models within the genome
was determined by mapping the sequence to human reference sequence assembly hg18, March 2006 (UCSC
browser) that is based on NCBI Build 36.1 http://
genome.ucsc.edu/. The search for orthologs in chimpanzee,
mouse and rat was done in a similar way using BLASTn,
BLASTp, BLAT (nucleic acid and protein levels) and information on syntenic regions (ENSEMBL). Alignments of
presumable orthologs using T-Coffee http://www.tcoffee.org/[98] served to inspect the similarities. Reciprocal
BLAST searches against the human database were done to
confirm the closest relationship with the presumable
ortholog. Since the mouse sequences were far better supported by cDNAs and ESTs, they also served to define the
respective rat genes and the transcript they presumably
encode by searching for homologies in the rat genomic
sequence. Genomic annotation was again based on the
UCSC browser (for chimpanzee pantro2, March 2006
based on GSC build 2.1; for mouse mm9 July 2007 based
on NCBI 37; for rat rn4 November 2004 based on HGSC
build 3.4; see UCSC website for more details). Furthermore, we searched the mouse and rat genomic regions that
are syntenic to our human 8q24.3 ZNF locus for remnants
of KRAB-A, KRAB-B and C2H2-ZNF encoding sequences
using HMMER as described above for the human sequence.
After setting up the gene models in human, chimpanzee
and, if available, also in mouse and rat, we used all the
information to find orthologs in other mammalian species
by the means described above. Not surprisingly, in many
cases the gene models in rhesus monkey (UCSC genome
assembly rheMac2), dog (canFam2), cow (bosTau4) and
opossum (monDom5) suffer from the early stage of genome
assembly and the lack of known cDNAs. In most cases we
were left with deduced coding sequences inferred from
homology comparisons. All transcript and protein
sequences derived from these combined efforts are given in
Additional files 1 and 2, respectively.

Phylogenetic analyses, alignments and clustering

Multiple alignments of protein and cDNA sequences were
generated with ClustalW.1.83 using Gonnet/IUB matrices
and default parameters [99]. Phylogenetic trees were calculated by the neighbor-joining algorithm [100]. Bootstrap
values of the trees were calculated for 1000 trials using the
MEGA4 program package [101]. Given the close evolutionary relationship of duplicated genes, a maximum parsimony analysis was performed for protein sequences using
the program PROTPARS of the PHYLIP package [102].
Since internal rearrangements of zinc finger domains were
expected from domain organization and initial neighborjoining tree inspections, this analysis was best suitable for
the KRAB domain. In addition, all zinc finger domains
were analyzed by principal component analysis individually (see below). Other human C2H2 zinc finger genes and
distant relative Xenopus laevis Xfin [GenBank:X06021,
GenBank:EU277665] were included in some analyses as
outgroups (see respective figures and Additional files 1 and
2 for accession numbers and sequences).
Calculation of substitution rates between ortholog gene
sequences

To estimate selective evolutionary pressure on different
parts of the gene sequences encoding the different domains
we employed the YN00 module of the PAML software
package version 3.14 [53,54]. The codon-based alignments
of the domains/regions KRAB-A, KRAB-B, linker
("LINK") and zinc fingers ("ZNF") were done separately
using ClustalW 1.83 [99]. We calculated the ratio ω of the
number of non-synonymous (dN) and the number of synonymous (dS) substitutions per site for each pairwise comparison in a multiple alignment of ortholog sequences. Values
of ω < 1, = 1 and > 1 refer to negative purifying selection,
neutral evolution or positive selection, respectively. Z
scores as output of the Z-test of selection were calculated
from: Z score = (dN-dS)/sqrt (dN_SE2 + dS_SE2) with SE
being the standard deviation of the mean. The accompanying p-value was determined through: p = 1-normsdist
(abs(Z score)).
ZNF motif matrix analysis

DNA sequences encoding zinc finger motifs of individual
ZNF genes were compared to all ZNF sequences in the SysZNF data base ([40]) and ranked according to their similarity with the tool ZNFMotifMatrix (see SysZNF webpage at
http://lifecenter.sgst.cn/Utilities2007/znfMotifMatrix/:
First, ZNF motif DNA sequences of each ZNF gene were
aligned on the codon level. Then, a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) was constructed for this multi-alignment. Fortunately, the ZNF motifs have a fixed length of ~
72 nucleic acid residues, facilitating comparisons of
PSSMs. We built PSSMs for all human and mouse ZNF
genes and obtained genome-wide PSSMs datasets. Thus,

Page 25 of 30

we can compare the PSSM of a selected ZNF gene with the
PSSMs in the pre-constructed PSSM datasets and find the
most similar matrices (Euclidean distance), i.e the closest
relative with respect to C2H2 zinc finger sequences. For
visualization we employed Cytoscape 2.6.2 (http://
www.cytoscape.org, [58])
Analysis of binding residues

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the
multiple sequence alignment of the 8-residue stretch of
individual C2H2 zinc finger domains starting after the
highly conserved phenylalanine and ending before the first
zinc coordinating histidine. This region is involved in determining DNA/RNA-binding specificities as confirmed by 3D structure analysis [13]. These residues are numbered -2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with respect to the start of the α-helix
of a C2H2 zinc finger. Here, an N × 8 matrix was computed
containing explicitly the degree of conservation at each
position of the aligned 8-residue binding stretch for each of
the N zinc finger domains. For example, at position -2 42%
of the domains contained a serine, thus the conservation
matrix was filled with 0.42 for all domains with serine at
this position. Principal component analysis of the conservation matrix was then performed using the Matlab Statistics
toolbox (The Mathworks Inc., MA, USA). Pre-analysis
revealed that the positions 2 (73% S) and 4 (93% L) are
highly conserved and thus uninformative with respect to
functional changes; these were removed from the conservation matrix before principal component analysis. The plot
of the first against the second principal component representing the variation in position -2 and 1 or 5 and 6, respectively, was used for evolutionary analysis of functional
residues.
Tissue expression profiling of zinc finger genes

Total RNA from twenty-seven different human tissues was
purchased from Clontech. First strand synthesis was performed with 5 μg total RNA and the Superscript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed with random hexamer oligodeoxynucleotides according to the recommendations of
the supplier. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
with the TaqMan 7700 cycler (Applied Biosystems) with an
input of first strand sythesis product equivalent to 25 ng
total RNA. The probe/primer combinations for the genespecific amplicons were either designed by the PrimerExpress 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems) or purchased in a
ready-to use format (Applied Biosystems TaqMan Gene
expression assays). The assays for ZNF251, ZNF34,
ZNF517, ZNF7, ZNF250 as well as ZNF10, ZNF136,
ZNF439, ZNF248 and ZNF25 detected sequences in the
KRAB A and B exons, thus monitoring all KRAB-containing transcripts. The assays for the KRAB-ZNF genes
ZNF23 and ZNF101 probe the zinc finger exon sequences
and for ZNF20 the 3'UTR. The assay for ZNF16 spans two

Lorenz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:206
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/206

exons (exon 2, 3) as does the one for ZNF252 (exons 1,2
and 4,5, respectively, depending on gene model: see Figure
2A). Order numbers of the commercial as well as probe/
primer sequences of the assays we developed are given in
Additional file 8. Real-time PCR runs were performed with
the TaqMan PCR core reagent kit (part N808-0228, Applied
Biosystems) under the supplier's recommended standard
conditions. Relative RNA expression levels are proportional to [1/(2 exponent Ct] (see Applied Biosystems
777802-002: ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system
user bulletin 2) with Ct being the threshold cycle of the
reaction. Ct was determined from a log-linear plot of the
PCR signal (fluorescence) versus the cycle number by the
instrument's software. Relative expression values were
computed for each gene and referred to the value in heart
tissue which was set 1, since heart tissue showed the lowest
expression signals in the majority of assays. Since the
expression levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH
changed considerably (as much as by a factor of ~ 80; lowest relative expression 0.06 in pancreas, highest 4.87 in
skeletal muscle) normalization based on its expression was
omitted and comparisons were based on RNA input.
For cluster analysis of the tissue expression profiles of the
various ZNF genes the original relative quantitative RTPCR values were used to calculate trees: The ZNF gene tree
is based on Pearson correlation distances and the tissue tree
on euclidean distances, both with single linkage, using R
software http://www.r-project.org. The corresponding heatmap (Figure 8) was drawn with CIMminer http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cimminer.
Comparison of expression and sequence similarities

The analysis of sequence similarities for the different ZNF
DNA/protein sequences was based on distance matrices
obtained with the MEGA4 software package [101]. Alignments were made with ClustalW 1.83 [99] using IUB
(DNA) or Gonnet (protein) matrices. Distance calculations
employed the Tamura-Nei method [103] on DNA or Poisson correction on the amino acid level, both with the pairwise deletion option of missing data. Four different
similarities based on the sequences of cDNAs, of whole
proteins, and of only the ZNF- and the KRAB domains,
respectively, were computed. Similarities of expression
profiles were quantified by Pearson correlation coefficients.
In order to examine whether sequence similarity was associated with expression profile similarity, we quantified the
similarities between the different similarity matrices by the
Pearson correlation of all corresponding matrix elements.
We considered all 16 ZNF genes with available expression
data and KRAB domains. Since only the underlying similarity matrices were analyzed, this approach is independent
of any tree-reconstruction method [104]. All correlations
were calculated using Mathematica (Wolfram Research
Ltd.).

Computational analysis of promoter regions

The proximal promoter sequences of the seven ZNF genes
were extracted with the Gene2Promoter software module of
the GenomatixSuite (Genomatix, Germany; sequences
given in Additional file 11). The software takes into
account known transcripts as well as recorded CAGE (cap
analysis of gene expression) tags that correspond to the 5'end of capped transcripts and thus provide a picture of TSS.
The promoter regions encompass 500 bp upstream and 100
bp downstream of a TSS. If more than one TSS was present
the sequence stretch was calculated from the most upstream
and most downstream sitting sites, respectively. For comparison, we annotated the extracted regions with the UCSC
Genome Browser using tracks for known promoter features. Examples are CpG islands, RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation footprints and TSS predictions
by other software (see visualizations in Additional file 12).
Core promoter elements were predicted by Genomatix MatInspector 8.0 with default settings using position weight
matrices for respective TFBS [105] and are listed in Additional file 13. Then the promoter regions were subjected to
the Genomatix Suite tool ModelInspector version 5.6.5
using default conditions. This tool employs predefined
functional modules that usually combine two TFBS in a
conserved configuration and with known synergistic, additive or antagonistic relationship [57]. The current promoter
module library (version 5.1) consists of 657 vertebrate regulatory modules that on average detect less than 1 match
per 10000 bp in genomic sequence. The modules combine
redundant elements since they group TFBS into families
covering closely related transcription factors. For simplicity, we further consolidated modules into module families
based on the presence of the same TFBS families and used
the data for a simple counting strategy: A module family
was taken into account if it was predicted in at least 3 of the
8q24.3 ZNF promoter regions. Such modules are listed in
detail with their TFBS in Additional file 14 and served as
input to generate the summarized data of Tables 4 and 5.
