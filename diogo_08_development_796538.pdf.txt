Abstract
Background: During vertebrate head evolution, muscle changes accompanied radical modification
of the skeleton. Recent studies have suggested that muscles and their innervation evolve less rapidly
than cartilage. The freshwater teleostean zebrafish (Danio rerio) is the most studied actinopterygian
model organism, and is sometimes taken to represent osteichthyans as a whole, which include bony
fishes and tetrapods. Most work concerning zebrafish cranial muscles has focused on larval stages.
We set out to describe the later development of zebrafish head muscles and compare muscle
homologies across the Osteichthyes.
Results: We describe one new muscle and show that the number of mandibular, hyoid and
hypobranchial muscles found in four day-old zebrafish larvae is similar to that found in the adult.
However, the overall configuration and/or the number of divisions of these muscles change during
development. For example, the undivided adductor mandibulae of early larvae gives rise to the
adductor mandibulae sections A0, A1-OST, A2 and Aω, and the protractor hyoideus becomes
divided into dorsal and ventral portions in adults. There is not always a correspondence between
the ontogeny of these muscles in the zebrafish and their evolution within the Osteichthyes. All of
the 13 mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles present in the adult zebrafish are found in at
least some other living teleosts, and all except the protractor hyoideus are found in at least some
extant non-teleost actinopterygians. Of these muscles, about a quarter (intermandibularis anterior,
adductor mandibulae, sternohyoideus) are found in at least some living tetrapods, and a further
quarter (levator arcus palatini, adductor arcus palatini, adductor operculi) in at least some extant
sarcopterygian fish.
Conclusion: Although the zebrafish occupies a rather derived phylogenetic position within
actinopterygians and even within teleosts, with respect to the mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial
muscles it seems justified to consider it an appropriate representative of these two groups. Among
these muscles, the three with clear homologues in tetrapods and the further three identified in
sarcopterygian fish are particularly appropriate for comparisons of results between the
actinopterygian zebrafish and the sarcopterygians.

Background
The Osteichthyes, including bony fishes and tetrapods, is
a highly speciose group of gnathostomes, comprising
more than 42,000 living species. Two main osteichthyan
groups are usually recognized: the Actinopterygii (rayfins,
> 28,000 extant species) and Sarcopterygii (lobefins and
tetrapods, > 24,000 living species; note that bony fishes
constitute a paraphyletic group, as they only become
monophyletic if tetrapods are excluded; Fig. 1) [1]. One of
the most studied osteichthyan model organisms is the
zebrafish Danio rerio, a small actinopterygian freshwater
fish from the teleostean order Cypriniformes (Fig. 1) [25]. Comparisons between zebrafish and other vertebrates
are often made in developmental studies, the zebrafish
being sometimes taken as a 'good representative' of teleosts, of actinopterygians and even of bony fishes [2]. To
what extent is this true for the cranial musculature?

Among studies dealing with zebrafish myology, only a
few focus on cranial muscles, and these mainly concern
larval stages (e.g. [3,5-10]). In fact, as stated by Schilling,
"no study has carefully described the anatomy of the musculature of the adult zebrafish" [5]. This is surprising given
that the cranial myology of other adult members of the
order Cypriniformes has been described in detail in the
literature [11-20]. Schilling provided a short summary of
the myology of the adult zebrafish but, as he recognized,
this was mainly based on an extrapolation from his "own
observations of larval cranial muscles" and from "studies
in other teleosts", and not from direct dissection of adult
specimens of Danio rerio [5].
Aside from the poor knowledge of the late stages of development of zebrafish cranial muscles there are also problems with the identification of homologies between some
of these muscles and those of other vertebrates. The main
reason for the scarce knowledge of the homologies and

evolution of osteichthyan cranial muscles is that most of
the works dealing with the comparative anatomy of
Osteichthyes concern skeletal structures. The most
detailed published comparative analyses of osteichthyan
cranial muscles based on direct observation of a wide
range of taxa derive from long ago [12,21-23]. Edgeworth's volume [12] continues to be a fundamental
source of information on vertebrate muscles. However,
Edgeworth could not, for instance, study the muscles of
the then undiscovered coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae
[24], or know of the essential role of neural crest cells in
the development and patterning of vertebrate cranial
muscles [3,25-33].
About 15 years ago, Miyake et al. [34] published an analysis of the cranial muscles of chondrichthyan batoids, in
which they re-examined and discussed various hypotheses
proposed by Edgeworth [12]. They noted that "Noden
[26-28] elegantly demonstrated with quail-chick chimeras
that (certain) cranial muscles are embryologically of somitic origin and not, as commonly thought, of lateral plate
origin, and in doing so corroborated the nearly forgotten
work of Edgeworth". They also pointed out that molecular
developmental studies such as Hatta et al. [7,35] "have
corroborated one of Edgeworth's findings: the existence of
one premyogenic condensation (the constrictor dorsalis)
in the cranial region of teleost fish". Edgeworth [12] recognized various presumptive premyogenic condensations: mandibular, hyoid, branchial, epibranchial, and
hypobranchial. According to him, developmental pathways leading from these condensations to myogenesis in
each cranial arch involve migration of premyogenic cells,
differentiation of myofibers, directional growth of
myofibers and possibly interactions with surrounding
structures. These events occur in very specific locations,
e.g. dorsal, medial or ventral areas of each arch. Although
exceptions may occur [36], Edgeworth's mandibular muscles are generally innervated by the Vth nerve, the hyoid
muscles by the VIIth nerve, and the branchial muscles by
the IXth and Xth nerves. His epibranchial and hypobranchial muscles are "developed from the anterior myotomes of the body" and thus "are intrusive elements of the
head"; they "retain a spinal innervation" and "do not
receive any branches from the Vth, VIIth, IXth and Xth
nerves". It should, however, be noted that recent developmental data has shown that head mesoderm is initially
unsegmented and that, contrary to Edgeworth's hypothesis, it may not generate a migratory population of myoblasts as is the case in the anterior somites which give rise
to the hypobranchial muscles. Instead, the mandibular,
hyoid and branchial muscles appear to develop in situ
under the influence of cephalic neural crest cells [30-33].
The main aim of the present paper is to provide a solid
basis for future molecular, evolutionary and developmen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/24

tal work concerning zebrafish cranial musculature, by
addressing four main questions: 1) How do the mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles of zebrafish
develop until they reach their adult form? 2) To which
muscles of other osteichthyans do these muscles correspond? 3) Is there a correspondence between the ontogeny of these muscles in the zebrafish and their
evolutionary history within the Osteichthyes? 4) Regarding these cranial muscles, is it appropriate to consider the
zebrafish as a "good representative" of teleosts, of actinopterygians and/or of bony fishes?

Results
We examined the mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial
muscles of Edgeworth [12], i.e. the 'superficial cranial
muscles' of Diogo and Vandewalle [37]. With exception to
those few cases in which it is stated otherwise, our observations of these muscles in the early larvae analyzed
mostly agree with those done in previous works [3,5,810]. The larval branchial and ocular muscles of the
zebrafish have been described [3,5-10]. The configuration
of the ocular muscles in adults is essentially similar to that
found in larvae (data not shown).
Mandibular musculature
According to Schilling and Kimmel, five bilateral mandibular muscles innervated by the Vth nerve are formed in the
first three days of zebrafish development: the intermandibularis anterior, the intermandibularis posterior, the
adductor mandibulae, the levator arcus palatini and the
dilatator operculi [3]. In their study, the adductor mandibulae began myosin protein expression at 53 hours post
fertilization (53 hpf), the other four mandibular muscles
appearing at 62 hpf [3]. These five muscles were found in
the 4 day old (4-d) larvae examined in the present work
(Fig. 2).

During development, the intermandibularis posterior
becomes deeply associated with the hyoid muscle interhyoideus, forming the protractor hyoideus (Figs. 2A, B, 3, 4
and 5C). In contrast to earlier stages (Figs. 2A, B and 3A),
in 35-d juveniles and adults two protractor hyoideus portions, dorsal and ventral, can be recognized (Figs. 4A, B
and 5C). In adults, the ventral portion connects the anterior ceratohyal and ventral hypohyal bones to the ventromesial surface of the dentary bone of the mandible. The
dorsal portion runs from the anterior ceratohyal to the
ventromesial margin of the dentary bone (Table 1). Thus,
the protractor hyoideus is a complex muscle innervated by
both the Vth and VIIth nerves that results from a fusion of
the posterior portion of the intermandibularis posterior to
the anterior portion of the interhyoideus, followed by a
longitudinal splitting to generate dorsal and ventral portions. This muscle is usually, but not always, associated
with the elevation (protraction) of the hyoid bars, as well

as with the depression of the mandible [38]. The overall
configuration of the intermandibularis anterior remains
rather unchanged during development. In adults this
muscle connects the two dentary bones, thus joining the
two mandibles (Figs. 2A, B, 3A and 5B, C; Table 1).
As described in 5 and 6-d larvae [3,8-10], in the 4 and 9-d
larvae observed the adductor mandibulae is constituted

by a single mass of fibers (Fig. 2A, B). However, in the 14
and 24-d larvae examined, three different adductor mandibulae portions can be recognized (Fig. 3A, B and data
not shown): they seemingly correspond to the adductor
mandibulae A2, the Aω, and the A0/A1-OST of adults (of
Diogo and Chardon [39]; Fig. 5A, B). In 35-d juveniles
there is apparent separation between the adductor mandibulae A1-OST and the A0, the fibers of the former being

adductor mandibulae A0 runs from the preopercle and

attached on the maxilla and not on the mandible, it does
not directly drive mandibular adduction. It is instead
directly associated with adduction of the maxilla, and thus
of the upper jaw, participating in the peculiar mechanisms
of mouth protraction/retraction found in the zebrafish
and other extant cypriniforms [11,20,14-16,39,40]. Thus,
the larval adductor mandibulae undergoes splitting to
generate different portions of diverse function in the
adult.

mainly associated with opercular abduction (Fig. 5A;

levator operculi. The interhyoideus and hyohyoideus
appear at 58 hpf, the adductor hyomandibulae and
adductor operculi at 68 hpf, and the levator operculi at 85
hpf [3]. These five muscles, innervated by the VIIth nerve,
are found in the larvae, juveniles and adults examined in
the present work (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5A, C). As mentioned
above, in the zebrafish, as in most other teleosts, the interhyoideus becomes associated with the intermandibularis
posterior, forming the protractor hyoideus.
As in most other teleosts, in the adult zebrafish the hyohyoideus is innervated by the VIIth nerve, indicating its second arch origin [[3,13,38,40]; data not shown].
Hyohyoideus is divided into three paired structures: the

hyohyoideus inferior runs from the anterior ceratohyals
to a mesial aponeurosis in which it meets its contralateral
counterpart; the hyohyoideus abductor runs from the first
branchiostegal ray to a mesial aponeurosis that is attached
by means of two thin tendons to the ventral hypohyals
and in which it meets its contralateral counterpart; the
hyohyoidei adductores connects the branchiostegal rays,
the opercle and the subopercle of a single side of the fish
(Fig. 5C; Table 1). As stated by Stiassny [38] "there is little
commentary in the literature regarding the function of the
hyohyoideus inferior but adduction of the hyoid bar is
suggested by its position and presumed line of action".
Regarding the hyohyoideus abductor and hyohyoidei
adductores, which are often considered as parts of a hyohyoideus superior, they are usually associated with the
expansion and constriction of the branchiostegal membranes, respectively (Fig. 5C; Table 1). A reference point
that is often used to distinguish the hyohyoideus abductor
and the hyohyoidei adductores is the position with
respect to the most mesial branchiostegal ray: the hyohyoideus abductor is mesial to it and the hyohyoidei adductores lateral (Fig. 5C) [13]. At 9, 14, 24 and 35-d, the
hyohyoideus is already separated into three portions that
appear to correspond to the hyohyoideus inferior, hyohyoideus abductor and hyohyoidei adductores in adults
(Figs. 3, 4, 5C and data not shown). In the 4-d larvae
examined, the hyohyoideus is clearly divided into an
anterior part, the hyohyoideus inferior, and a posterior
part, named here hyohyoideus superior, but it is unclear if
this latter is already differentiated into hyohyoideus
abductor and hyohyoidei adductores (Figs. 2A, B and data
not shown). In some zebrafish specimens, ossification of
the branchiostegal rays (dermal bones directly derived
from connective tissue) occurs by 4-d while in others it
occurs later; it is thus likely that some 4-d larvae already
have a hyohyoideus superior divided into hyohyoideus
abductor and hyohyoidei adductores (separated by the
most mesial branchiostegal ray) and others not [2].
The dorsal hyoid muscles adductor operculi and levator
operculi are well separated throughout the zebrafish
stages examined (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5A). The adductor operculi of adults lies mesial to the levator operculi and connects the pterotic to the posterodorsal surface of the
opercle (Fig. 5A; Table 1). As its name indicates, it is
mainly associated with opercular adduction (i.e. closure)
[38]. The adult levator operculi runs from the ventrolateral margin of the pterotic to the dorsomesial edge of the
opercle (see Fig. 5A; Table 1). The action of the levator
operculi of teleosts is usually related to a peculiar mechanism mediating lower jaw depression via the so-called
'four-bar linkage system' in which the force of contraction
of this muscle is transmitted through the opercular series
(opercle, preopercle and/or interopercle) and the interoperculo-mandibular ligament to the lower jaw [38]. Our

observations of zebrafish larvae and adults indicate that
the action of the zebrafish levator operculi is similar to
that found in other teleosts.
In addition to the five hyoid muscles described by Schilling and Kimmel [3], we observed in all specimens examined (from 4-d larvae to adults), an additional muscle, the
adductor arcus palatini (Figs. 2B, C, 3A–B, 4A and 5A)
[13]. In the other bony fishes in which this muscle is
found, it is hyoid arch derived (see Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
In the adult zebrafish, the adductor arcus palatini runs
from the neurocranium to the mesial sides of the hyomandibula, metapterygoid and entopterygoid (Fig. 5A;
Table 1). It is anterior to, and broader than, the adductor
hyomandibulae, which connects the neurocranium to the
mesial margin of the hyomandibula. To confirm this
observation, we examined 5-d alpha-actin GFP transgenic
zebrafish larvae by confocal microscopy. The adductor
arcus palatini and the adductor hyomandibulae effectively constitute separate muscles, which are often hidden
behind the dilator operculi and levator arcus palatini in
whole mount preparations (Fig. 2D). Although in the larval and juvenile specimens observed in the present work
the adductor arcus palatini and adductor hyomandibulae
lie close to each other, they also constitute distinct muscles (Figs. 2, 3A–B, and 4A). Our observations indicate
that the action of the zebrafish adductor arcus palatini is
somewhat similar to that found in other teleosts: it promotes the adduction of the suspensorium (a structural
complex formed by the hyomandibula, quadrate and
pterygoid bones), thus acting as the antagonist of the levator arcus palatini (see above) [38].
Hypobranchial musculature
There is a single hypobranchial muscle in the zebrafish:
the sternohyoideus ([12]; Figs. 2A, B, 3A and 5C). In the
study of Schilling and Kimmel [3] this muscle, innervated
by the anterior branches of the occipito-spinal nerves,
appeared at 53 hpf. In early stages the sternohyoideus is
markedly divided longitudinally, its right and left parts
only meeting anteriorly, near the region of the hyohyoideus inferior (Figs. 2A, B). As described in zebrafish and
several other teleosts, each of these parts consists of three
myomeres separated by two myocommata [3,12,13]. In
older stages of development the right and left parts
become closer to each other; in adults they are connected
mesially throughout their lengths, forming a large coneshaped structure that originates from the anterior region
of the cleithrum and passes dorsally to the hyohyoideus
inferior and hyohyoideus abductor in order to attach on
the urohyal (Fig. 5C; Table 1). The sternohyoideus plays a
major role in hyoid depression, and, through a series of
mechanical linkages, in mouth opening and suspensorial
abduction [8,38]. As in numerous other teleosts [12,13],
the posterior portion of the sternohyoideus lies near the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/24

anterior attachment of the hypaxialis (ventral body musculature) on the pectoral girdle (Figs. 2A, B, 3A, and 4B),
the fibers of the former being sometimes associated posteriorly with fibers of the latter (e.g. Fig. 2B). Therefore, the
contraction of the hypaxialis during a feeding strike may
not only prevent the origin of the sternohyoideus from
moving anteriorly, but also facilitate a greater ventral displacement of the hyoid (= hyoid depression) by pulling
the posterior portion of the sternohyoideus backwards
[8]. In zebrafish larvae the anterior portion of the epaxial
and hypaxial body muscles extend anteriorly to attachments on the back of the skull and pectoral girdle, thus
lying near to, and eventually associating with, the head
muscles (e.g. Fig. 3C, D). This configuration is also seen in
the adult zebrafish (Fig. 5A).

Discussion
Homologies of the zebrafish mandibular, hyoid and
hypobranchial muscles
As raised in the Background section, a major question
addressed is the present paper is: to which muscles of
other osteichthyans do the mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles of the zebrafish correspond? Here we
add the zebrafish to the up-dated compilation of the
extant data and discussion of the development, evolution
and homologies of cranial muscles within various major
groups of Osteichthyes [36]. Our discussion provides a
starting point for investigating the identity and homologies between zebrafish mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles and the muscles found in other
osteichthyans (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
Mandibular muscles (Tables 2, 3)
According to Edgeworth [12], in numerous gnathostomes
the embryonic mandibular muscle plate gives rise dorsally
to the premyogenic condensation constrictor dorsalis and
medially to the premyogenic condensation adductor
mandibulae. To this can be added, ventrally, the intermandibularis (Tables 2, 3). Molecular developmental
studies have supported the existence of the constrictor
dorsalis in the cranial region of teleosts [7,35]. Expression
of Engrailed genes marks muscle cells associated with the
dorsal region of the first arch [7,35]. The constrictor dorsalis was plesiomorphically found in osteichthyans and
then independently lost in dipnoans and amphibians
(Tables 2, 3; see fig. 1). The constrictor dorsalis that gave
rise to the levator arcus palatini and dilatator operculi in
zebrafish and other actinopterygians is therefore homologous with the constrictor dorsalis that gives rise to e.g. the
levator arcus palatini in extant sarcopterygian fishes such
as Latimeria and to the protractor pterygoidei and levator
pterygoidei in certain amniotes (Tables 2, 3).

Regarding the ventral portion of the mandibular muscle
plate, in all major osteichthyan groups listed in Tables 2

and 3 it gives rise to the intermandibularis. In adult extant
members of Actinistia, Chondrostei, Ginglymodi and
Dipnoi the intermandibularis is mainly undivided. Adults
of Amia, Latimeria, and numerous amphibian, amniote
and teleostean genera, including Danio, exhibit an intermandibularis anterior and an intermandibularis posterior. It is, therefore, difficult to discern if the
intermandibularis was divided or not in plesiomorphic
adult osteichthyans (Tables 2, 3).
As in the zebrafish, in most teleosts the intermandibularis
posterior and interhyoideus form the protractor hyoideus,
which is thus derived from the mandibular and hyoid
muscle plates (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5C). Although a protractor
hyoideus is not found in a few teleosts such as Albula and
Mormyrus [13,41,42], this muscle was seemingly present
in the ancestors of extant teleosts (Table 2). Based on the
altered morphology of the protractor hyoideus in morpholino-mediated Hox PG2 (hoxa2b and hoxa2a) knockdown larvae, Hunter and Prince [10] suggested that in the
zebrafish "the basihyal (cartilage) may be important for
the proper ontogenetic organization" of the intermandibularis posterior and the interhyoideus, and, thus, for the
association of their fibers and the formation of the protractor hyoideus. Further studies are needed to check if
this is so and if it is a general feature within the Teleostei.
The adductor mandibulae is found in members of all
major osteichthyan groups (Tables 2, 3). The number of
divisions of this muscle is highly variable within these
groups (Tables 2, 3). As often occurs with other muscles,
different names are used in the literature to designate the
adductor mandibulae divisions in different osteichthyan
taxa, and sometimes within the same taxon. This is a
major reason for the historical confusions concerning the
homologies and evolution of these divisions within
osteichthyans. The names employed in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7 are those often used by researchers working with phylogenetically more plesiomorphic groups. Our observations
regarding the development, function and adult configura-

tion of the zebrafish adductor mandibulae A2 and Aω
indicate that these sections correspond to the A2 and Aω
found in most major osteichthyan groups. Regarding the
zebrafish adductor mandibulae A1-OST and A0, these
divisions correspond to adductor mandibulae sections
that are exclusively found in ostariophysan teleosts and in
cypriniforms, respectively [19,39]. Hernandez et al. [9]
stated that the adult zebrafish has an adductor mandibulae Aω and three further sub-divisions, as we also observe.
The adductor mandibulae A1, A2 and A3 of Hernandez et
al. probably correspond, respectively, to the A0, A1-OST
and A2 of the present study (see Table 2; Figs. 5A, B).
Hyoid muscles (Tables 4, 5)
Edgeworth [12] suggested that a constrictor hyoideus condensation usually gives rise to dorso-medial and ventral
derivatives throughout the major groups of gnathostomes. Two dorso-medial hyoid muscles were seemingly
found in plesiomorphic osteichthyans: the adductor arcus
palatini and the adductor operculi (Tables 4, 5). These
muscles are found in most teleosts, including the
zebrafish (Figs. 2B, C, 3, 4, and 5A). A few teleosts lack an
adductor operculi (e.g. saccopharyngiforms) [43-45].
Apart from the adductor arcus palatini and the adductor
operculi, other dorso-medial hyoid muscles are found in
certain living osteichthyans (Tables 4, 5). For example, the
zebrafish, as most extant teleosts and the halecomorph
Amia, has a muscle levator operculi (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5A).
Millot and Anthony [24] stated that Latimeria has a 'levator operculi'. However, whether this muscle is homologous to the levator operculi of zebrafish is doubtful for
two main reasons. First, the muscles have distinct function: contrary to the zebrafish and other teleosts and to
Amia, Latimeria does not have an interoperculo-mandibular ligament and, therefore, does not have an opercular
mechanism mediating mandible depression [36]. Second,
and more importantly, it is cladistically more parsimonious to consider that these muscles were independently
acquired in actinistians and halecostomes (2 steps) than
to have one acquisition (in the node leading to osteich-

thyans) and various independent losses (at least in nonactinistian sarcopterygians, in cladistians, in chondrosteans and in ginglymodians) (see Fig. 1). On balance, our
view is that the 'levator operculi' of Latimeria is unlikely to
be homologous with the levator operculi of the zebrafish
and other teleosts and of Amia (see Tables 4, 5). Similar
reasoning applies to the 'adductor hyomandibulae' of Latimeria and to the adductor hyomandibulae found in the
zebrafish and certain other teleosts (see below). However,
further studies, and particularly more detailed palaeontological data, are needed to clarify the exact taxonomic distribution of these muscles within osteichthyans. The
dipnoan 'levator operculi' illustrated by Kardong [46],
which may correspond to the adductor operculi of other
bony fishes but forms, in extant adult dipnoans, a continuous sheet of fibers together with other cranial muscles
[12,21,23,47-51], seemingly corresponds to the constrictor operculi of Bemis and Lauder [50]. Therefore, the levator operculi found in the zebrafish, most other teleosts
and Amia is seemingly not homologous with any of the
individual cranial muscles of other extant osteichthyans:
it probably derived evolutionarily from the adductor
operculi at the node leading to the Halecostomi (Fig. 1,
Table 4) [36].
Apart from the adductor arcus palatini, some osteichthyans have other muscles connecting the neurocranium to
the palatoquadrate/suspensorium and promoting the
adduction of these latter structures. This is the case in
zebrafish, which exhibit an adductor arcus palatini and an
adductor hyomandibulae according to Winterbottom's
nomenclature [13]. There is much confusion in the literature concerning these muscles. As explained by Winterbottom [13], in most teleosts there is a single muscle
connecting the neurocranium to the mesial surface of the
suspensorium and thus acting to adduct this latter structure. Winterbottom opted to designate this muscle 'adductor arcus palatini' and not 'adductor hyomandibulae'
because the latter name becomes inappropriate in the
numerous taxa in which this muscle is expanded anteriorly along the floor of the orbit and attaches on elements
of the suspensorium other than the hyomandibula, for
example the metapterygoid and/or entopterygoid (as is
the case in the adult zebrafish). He therefore used the
name 'adductor hyomandibulae' to designate a muscle
that is only found in a few osteichthyans (one of them
being the zebrafish) and that is usually situated posteriorly to his adductor arcus palatini, connecting the neurocranium to the mesial surface of the hyomandibula. This
nomenclature is followed in the present study (Tables 4,
5). At least some of the muscles 'adductor hyomandibulae' of osteichthyans are non-homologous, as they may
originate "1) either from the posterior region of the
adductor arcus palatini or 2) from the anterior fibers of
the adductor operculi" [13]. This is for instance the case of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/24

the 'adductor hyomandibulae' found in Latimeria [24]
and in various teleosts (Tables 4, 5; see above). In order to
distinguish the 'adductor hyomandibulae' of the zebrafish
from the 'adductor hyomandibulae' of Latimeria, these
muscles are designated in Tables 4, 5 as 'adductor hyomandibulae X' and 'adductor hyomandibulae Y', respectively.
Examples of dorso-medial hyoid muscles that are not
found in the zebrafish, but which are present in other
osteichthyans, are the levator hyoideus and the depressor
mandibulae, which seemingly gave rise to the stylohyoideus, digastricus posterior, stapedius, and possibly part of
the facial muscles of mammals (Table 5). The levator
hyoideus is usually related with the elevation of the posterodorsal portion of the ceratohyal, whereas the depressor mandibulae is usually related with the opening of the
mouth [49,50]. The levator hyoideus is found in at least
some developmental stages of extant dipnoans and of
numerous extant tetrapods [12]. The depressor mandibulae of extant dipnoans such as Lepidosiren and Protopterus
seems to be homologous with part of the depressor mandibulae of tetrapods (see Table 7). Interestingly, works
such as Köntges and Lumsden [30] have shown that in
tetrapod taxa such as birds the posterior region of the
mandible to which the depressor mandibulae attaches is
constituted by neural crest derivatives of the hyoid arch,
and not of the mandibular arch. This is one of the several
examples given by these authors to illustrate the highly
constrained pattern of cranial skeletomuscular connectivity found in these tetrapods: each rhombomeric neural
crest population remains coherent throughout ontogeny,
forming both the connective tissues of specific muscles
and their respective attachment sites onto the neuro- and
viscerocranium. It would be interesting, therefore, to
investigate if the depressor mandibulae of dipnoans such
as Protopterus and Lepidosiren also attaches in a region of
the mandible constituted by neural crest derivatives of the
hyoid arch. If future investigation shows that the mandible of extant non-dipnoan bony fishes is exclusively
formed by mandibular neural crest derivatives, this would
indicate that the presence of a depressor mandibulae in
tetrapods and dipnoans might be related with an evolutionary change in which hyoid neural crest derivatives
have become incorporated in the formation of the lower
jaw.
The plesiomorphic condition for osteichthyans is seemingly that in which the ventral portion of the hyoid muscle plate gives rise to a single division, designated here as
interhyoideus (Tables 4, 5). In most extant actinopterygians part of the interhyoideus separates into a distinct
muscle during development, the hyohyoideus (Table 4).
In adult zebrafish, as in most other teleosts, the hyohyoideus is divided into hyohyoideus inferior, hyohyoideus

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:24

abductor and hyohyoidei adductores (Fig. 5C; Tables 4,
5). Beyond teleosts, the presence of these three divisions
is only found in the extant halecomorph Amia (Tables 4,
5). An independent hyohyoideus in seemingly missing in
extant Sarcopterygii (Table 5). Although there are some
sarcopterygians in which the portion of the hyoid muscle
plate that gives rise to the interhyoideus and hyohyoideus
in actinopterygians eventually becomes somewhat
divided into bundles that resemble these two muscles,
these bundles remain deeply mixed throughout all developmental stages. This is the case of the interhyoideus anterior and interhyoideus posterior of various salamanders
(Table 5) [52-58]. It is seemingly also the case of the
"géniohyoïdien" and "hyohyoïdien" described by Millot
and Anthony [24] in Latimeria (Table 5). Further studies
are needed to determine whether splitting of interhyoideus evolved repeatedly in osteichthyans.
Hypobranchial muscles (Tables 6, 7)
The plesiomorphic condition for osteichthyans is seemingly that found in adult members of Actinistia and Dipnoi, which exhibit two hypobranchial muscles: a
coracomandibularis and a sternohyoideus (Tables 6, 7).
In extant cladistians, chondrosteans and halecomorphs
the coracomandibularis is modified into a peculiar muscle branchiomandibularis that connects the branchial
arches to the mandible. A coracomandibularis/branchiomandibularis is missing in living ginglymodians and teleosts, including the zebrafish (Table 6). Therefore, contrary
to what is sometimes stated in the literature, the geniohyoideus of tetrapods does not correspond to the zebrafish
protractor hyoidei, nor to any of its constituents (i.e. the
intermandibularis posterior and the interhyoideus)
(Tables 6, 7). The absence of a coracomandibularis/branchiomandibularis in living ginglymodians and in teleosts
is seemingly due to a secondary loss [59-61]. In extant
tetrapods, there are various hypobranchial muscles that
are not found in other extant osteichthyans, for example
the omohyoideus, sternothyroideus, thyrohyoideus and
the specialized glossal muscles related with the movements of the tongue (Table 7) [12,46,53,54,62-68].
Ontogeny and Phylogeny
Another major question addressed by this paper is: does
the development of the mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles in the zebrafish correspond to the evolution of these muscles within the Osteichthyes? Our
analysis shows that only in certain cases is this true. For
example, based on our previous cladistic analysis [36],
within osteichthyan evolutionary history the mandibular
muscles intermandibularis anterior, intermandibularis
posterior, adductor mandibulae and levator arcus palatini
were seemingly present in basal osteichthyans; the dilatator operculi was apparently only acquired later in evolution, being exclusively found in actinopterygians (Table

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/24

2). However, according to Schilling and Kimmel, sarcomeric myosin expression (SME; i.e. contractile function) of
the dilatator operculi, levator arcus palatini, intermandibularis anterior and intermandibularis posterior begins
ontogenetically at about the same time in the zebrafish,
i.e. at 62 hpf (the adductor mandibulae appears at 53 hpf)
[3]. In contrast, the development of the zebrafish adductor mandibulae divisions does seem to follow the order in
which these divisions were acquired in evolution. The
adductor mandibulae A2 and Aω were acquired first in
evolution, being plesiomorphically found in osteichthyans; the adductor mandibulae A1-OST and A0 were
acquired later, namely in the nodes leading to ostariophysans and to cypriniforms, respectively (Tables 2, 3) [36].
During zebrafish development, the adductor mandibulae
A2 and Aω also form earlier, being already separated in
the 9-d larvae examined. The adductor mandibulae A1OST and A0 were only distinguished in 35-d juveniles and
adults.
The order in which the hyoid muscles were acquired in
evolution is: first, the interhyoideus, adductor operculi
and adductor arcus palatini (plesiomorphically found in
osteichthyans); then, the hyohyoideus (only found in
extant actinopterygians); then, the levator operculi (only
found in extant halecomorphs and teleosts); and, lastly,
the adductor hyomandibulae X (found in some teleosts,
seemingly not homologous with the adductor hyomandibulae Y of Latimeria) (Table 4) [36]. According to Schilling and Kimmel, in the zebrafish SME of the
interhyoideus and hyohyoideus begins at 58 hpf, of the
adductor operculi and adductor hyomandibulae at 68
hpf, and of the levator operculi at 85 hpf [3]. Thus, as in
phylogeny, in the zebrafish SME of the levator operculi
begins later than SME of the interhyoideus, the hyohyoideus and the adductor operculi. However, unlike phylogeny, SME of the zebrafish hyohyoideus begins earlier than
the adductor operculi.
The single hypobranchial muscle in the zebrafish, the sternohyoideus, begins SME at 53 hpf and consists of left and
right parts [3]. We show that these parts gradually fuse
during later development. Interestingly, in adult basal
actinopterygians, the sternohyoideus is longitudinally
divided into left and right parts that remain physically
separate [69]. This plesiomorphic configuration was,
however, modified in the node leading to the Teleostei: in
adult teleosts, including the zebrafish, the sternohyoideus
is a cone-shaped structure in which the left and right parts
are hardly distinguished from each other. Thus, during
zebrafish development the overall configuration of the
sternohyoideus becomes modified in a manner that
resembles the changes that occurred in actinopterygian
evolution.

The examples above show that although in certain cases
there is a correspondence between the ontogeny of the
mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles in the
zebrafish and the evolution of these muscles within
Osteichthyes, this is not always the case. This also applies
to other zebrafish head muscles, as well as certain cartilages and bones. For example, as shown in Figure 2A, B, in
4-d zebrafish larvae the levator arcus branchialis 5 is
already much broader than the other branchial muscles,
prior to the splitting of the adductor mandibulae into different sections. However, in evolution the hypertrophy of
the levator arcus branchialis 5 occurred only in the node
leading to cypriniforms, much later than the division of
the adductor mandibulae in different sections (Fig. 1;
Table 2) [36]. The modification of the muscle levator
arcus branchialis 5, as well as of the skeletal structure that
is moved by this muscle, the ceratobranchial 5, is related
with the specialized feeding mechanisms of cypriniforms
[2,3,11-18]). Ceratobranchial 5 bears teeth and ossifies
earlier than other ceratobranchials in cypriniforms, a case
of 'acceleration' of development [3]. Such coordinated
ontogenetic timing changes may ensure proper size relationships between skeletal and myological structures.
Conclusion: zebrafish as a case study
The zebrafish is the most studied model organism among
osteichthyan fishes, and is often taken as a 'good representative' of teleosts, of actinopterygians, and even of
bony fishes in developmental and molecular studies. But,
regarding its mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles, to what extent is it appropriate to consider the
zebrafish as an appropriate 'representative' of these
groups?

As can be seen in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all of the 13 mandibular, hyoid and hypobranchial muscles found in the
adult zebrafish (intermandibularis anterior, protractor
hyoideus, adductor mandibulae, levator arcus palatini,
dilatator operculi, hyohyoideus inferior, hyohyoideus
abductor, hyohyoidei adductores, adductor arcus palatini,
adductor hyomandibulae, adductor operculi, levator
operculi, and sternohyoideus) are found in at least some
other living teleosts, and all except the protractor hyoideus are found in at least some non-teleost extant actinopterygians. Therefore, although the zebrafish occupies a
rather derived phylogenetic position within the Actinopterygii and even within the Teleostei (Fig. 1), with respect
to these muscles, it seems justified to consider the
zebrafish as a potential representative of these two groups.
Moreover, of these 13 muscles, about half are found in at
least some extant sarcopterygian fishes (six muscles;
namely the intermandibularis anterior, adductor mandibulae, levator arcus palatini, adductor arcus palatini,
adductor operculi, and sternohyoideus). About a quarter
can be confidently identified in at least some extant adult

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/24

tetrapods (three muscles; the intermandibularis anterior,
adductor mandibulae, and sternohyoideus). Therefore,
among the cranial muscles discussed in this paper, these
three latter muscles are particularly appropriate for direct
comparisons between the results obtained in molecular
and developmental studies of the zebrafish and the data
obtained from model tetrapod organisms from clades
such as Amphibia and/or Amniota. The information provided here forms a solid basis for future analyses on
zebrafish cranial muscles and for a proper comparison
between these muscles and those found in other osteichthyans.

Methods
King's wild type or Tg(acta1:GFP) [70] zebrafish were
reared according to Westerfield [71]. 4-d (96 hpf, 10 larvae, mean total length 3.2 mm), 9-d (216 hpf, 10 larvae,
mean total length 4.0 mm), 14-d (336 hpf, 10 larvae,
mean total length 4.5 mm), 24-d (576 hpf, 10 larvae
mean total length 6.5 mm) and 35-d (986 hpf, 10 juveniles, mean total length 7.4 mm) were killed and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde. Larval or juvenile fish were
bleached in 1%H2O2 5% formamide solution to remove
pigment, processed for immunohistochemistry with antimyosin heavy chain antibody A4.1025 as previously
described [3], and viewed and photographed on a Zeiss
Axiophot. Adult specimens (10, from the collection of the
Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales de Madrid, about
1-year-old, mean length 45.2 mm) were alcohol-preserved. Dissections and morphological drawings of adult
specimens were made using a Wild M5 dissecting microscope equipped with a camera lucida. The nomenclature
used to designate the skeletal and muscular structures follows that of Diogo [36]. The phylogenetic framework for
the discussions provided in the present paper is based on
the results of a recent cladistic analysis of osteichthyan
higher-level phylogeny including 356 phylogenetic osteological and myological characters and 80 extant and fossil
terminal taxa (Fig. 1) [36].
