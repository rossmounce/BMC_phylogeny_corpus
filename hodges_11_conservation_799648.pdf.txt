Conservation of ciliary proteins in plants with no
cilia
Matthew E Hodges1,3, Bill Wickstead2,3, Keith Gull3 and Jane A Langdale1*

Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic cilia are complex, highly conserved microtubule-based organelles with a broad
phylogenetic distribution. Cilia were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor and many proteins involved
in cilia function have been conserved through eukaryotic diversification. However, cilia have also been lost multiple
times in different lineages, with at least two losses occurring within the land plants. Whereas all non-seed plants
produce cilia for motility of male gametes, some gymnosperms and all angiosperms lack cilia. During these
evolutionary losses, proteins with ancestral ciliary functions may be lost or co-opted into different functions.
Results: Here we identify a core set of proteins with an inferred ciliary function that are conserved in ciliated
eukaryotic species. We interrogate this genomic dataset to identify proteins with a predicted ancestral ciliary role
that have been maintained in non-ciliated land plants. In support of our prediction, we demonstrate that several of
these proteins have a flagellar localisation in protozoan trypanosomes. The phylogenetic distribution of these
genes within the land plants indicates evolutionary scenarios of either sub- or neo-functionalisation and expression
data analysis shows that these genes are highly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana pollen cells.
Conclusions: A large number of proteins possess a phylogenetic ciliary profile indicative of ciliary function.
Remarkably, many genes with an ancestral ciliary role are maintained in non-ciliated land plants. These proteins
have been co-opted to perform novel functions, most likely before the loss of cilia, some of which appear related
to the formation of the male gametes.

Background
Centrioles and cilia/flagella are microtubule-based organelles involved in cellular motility and signalling (for
review see [1]). The ultrastructural morphology of these
ancient organelles is remarkably conserved in extant
eukaryotes and their phylogenetic distribution pattern
suggests that the last eukaryotic common ancestor
(LECA) possessed the ability to produce a centriole plus
cilia with both sensory and motility functions [2-4].
Despite this widespread phylogenetic distribution, lineage specific modifications have been shown to occur
and numerous instances of independent cilia loss have
been reported [5-9].
In recent years, multiple high-throughput proteomic
studies and bioinformatic analyses in disparate species

have identified a cohort of proteins associated with centriole and ciliary functions [2,3,10-16]. These proteins
include both those with ciliary-specific roles (such as
intraflagellar transport proteins, outer- and inner-dynein
arms and radial spoke proteins) as well as those such as
tubulins that are also involved in other cellular functions
(for an extensive database see Cildb [17]). To date, however, little is known about what happens to genes
involved in ciliary function when an evolutionary transition to cilia loss occurs.
The land plant lineage is a good model for studying
the transition to ciliary loss for several reasons. First,
this ancient monophyletic group was ancestrally ciliated,
but there have been at least two independent loss events
within the group, once in gymnosperms and once at the
base of the angiosperms [18-20]. Second, sufficient
genomic information exists for an in-depth analysis of
protein compositional changes during the process of
ciliary loss. Third, the land plants are a sister lineage to

the Chlorophyta, a group that includes the well-studied
ciliary model species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The
Chlorophytes thus provide a good outgroup for identification and analysis of genes with ciliary function.
Within the ciliated basal land plants, cilia are produced only in specialised sperm cells [4]. Ciliogenesis in
these cells occurs de novo, as opposed to the canonical
template pathway seen in animal lineages [21]. It can
thus be assumed that there are regulatory mechanisms
that ensure correct spatial and temporal expression of
genes required for ciliary function within this restricted
phase of the plant life cycle. On losing the ability to produce cilia, it is unclear whether these regulatory
mechanisms are also lost.
Here, we describe an approach that uses phylogenetic
profiling to identify a core set of ciliary function proteins. By applying a scoring system to orthologous sets
of proteins within 45 eukaryotic species we aimed to
identify proteins with an ancestral ciliary function that
are maintained in non-ciliated land plants. We then
tested this ancestral ciliary function in the flagellated
protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, and investigated potential plant roles through analysis of gene expression data
and phylogenetic inference. We conclude that at least
some of the genes identified in cilia formation in nonseed plants retain a role in male gametophyte development in seed plants.

Results
Identification of ciliary proteins by phylogenetic
distribution

To gain a deeper understanding of the key proteins
involved in ciliary function across eukaryotes, we analysed the distribution of orthologuos proteins encoded
in the genomes of 45 species (Additional file 1). The
species were selected to represent a wide evolutionary
spread across six major groups of eukaryotes (namely:
Archaeplastida, Excavata, Chromalveolata, Holozoa,
Fungi and Amoebozoa). For each species, a complete or
near-complete genome sequence is publically available.
The species analysed include organisms that produce
cilia/flagella at some point in their life cycle (which we
refer to here as “ciliated species”) and those that do not
(referred to here as “non-ciliated species”). Proteins
which are phylogenetically conserved in ciliated, but not
in non-ciliated species, are considered to possess a “ciliary profile” and are predicted to perform a ciliary
function.
To identify proteins with a ciliary profile, we performed a reciprocal best BLAST (RBB) analysis using
the predicted proteome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
to identify putative orthologues encoded in the genomes
of 44 other eukaryotic species. The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was chosen as the query genome

due to its phylogenetic position in the sister lineage to
(at the base of) the land plants. The relatively short phylogenetic distance to the land plants, when compared to
the spread of the eukaryotic phylogeny, reduces the
chance that sequence divergence would prevent accurate
identification of orthologues. Furthermore, Chlamydomonas is a well-studied ciliary model species.
The predicted proteome of Chlamydomonas has
15,143 proteins. Of these, 6,982 proteins have more
than one putative orthologue. To reduce the noise of
false positives in the dataset, only proteins with identifiable hits in at least 5 species within the analysis were
retained. This cut-off resulted in a final defined dataset
of 4,802 proteins (31.7% of the proteins in the Chlamydomonas predicted proteome) (Additional file 2). Within
this dataset, 772 proteins (16.1%) have a putative orthologue in each of the major eukaryotic groups used in
this analysis. The most parsimonious explanation for the
phylogenetic distribution of these 772 proteins is that
these proteins were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), and that they have subsequently
been lost in certain lineages through evolutionary
divergence.
We found that a simple presence or absence analysis
of protein phylogenetic distribution in ciliated and nonciliated species was too stringent to identify proteins
with ciliary function because of false negatives. Therefore, we allowed for both false positives and negatives in
the dataset by applying a positive score for a hit in a
ciliated species, and a negative score for a hit in a nonciliated species (see Methods). By using this scoring system we found that out of the 4,802 proteins in the dataset, 213 (4.4%, Additional file 3) proteins possess a score
indicative of a ciliary profile (examples in Figure 1). As
an indication that the method to identify ciliary proteins
is accurate, 157 of these 213 (73.7%) proteins have been
previously detected within cilia in proteomic analyses.
This equates to 33.3% of all proteins (472) found in proteomic analyses of cilia. The remaining 56 proteins with
a ciliary profile currently have no known function. We
hypothesise that these represent a novel set of proteins
with an as yet uncharacterised ciliary function.
Ciliary profile proteins localise to the flagellum of
trypanosomes

Most of the ciliary profile proteins have been detected in
one or more proteomic studies of cilia [10,12,14,22]. To
test whether the 56 proteins which have not been previously identified in proteomic studies are likely to play
a role in cilia function, we investigated the cellular localisation of one of these proteins in the single-celled
excavate Trypanosoma brucei. T. brucei is a notable
model organism for cilia studies, with many examples of
transgene introduction for localisation studies. Many of

the ciliary profile proteins with known function have
already been localised in T. brucei (for review see [23]).
We selected a candidate protein, FBB17, which has a
putative trypanosome orthologue (herein called
TbFBB17) encoded by the gene Tb10.406.0130, for
endogenous locus TY-YFP-tagging in T. brucei.
TbFBB17 is a putative zinc carboxypeptidase which has
not been detected in any cilia proteomic study to date
[10,12,14,17,22]. The tagging strategy ensured that the
YFP-TbFBB17 chimera is transcribed by the endogenous
gene promoter. This strategy has previously been shown
to produce protein levels similar to wild-type for other
loci [24]. The correct incorporation of the YFP-tag at
the 5’ end of the targeted Tb10.406.0130 gene was
checked by PCR (data not shown) and by immunoblotting of cell lysates with monoclonal antibodies directed
against the short epitope TY-tag [25](Figure 1).

To determine the intracellular localisation of
TbFBB17, transformed cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Figure 1 shows that TbFBB17 is
found along the length of the flagellum (white arrow).
This observation supports the prediction that the identified ciliary profile proteins do indeed play a role in ciliary function. To determine whether TbFBB17 is stably
associated with the cytoskeleton, we assessed the localisation of the tagged protein in cells which had been
detergent-extracted to remove non-cytoskeletal components. In such cells the TbFBB17 flagellum signal is
removed (data not shown). This explains the lack of
identification of TbFBB17 in the trypanosome cilia proteome as the proteomes are derived from cytoskeletal
cell fractions [5]. A similar explanation may apply to the
other 55 proteins that have been identified in this study
but not in ciliary proteomic screens.

Identification of ciliary proteins in non-ciliated land plants
and fungi

In land plants cilia have been lost at least twice, once in
the gymnosperms and once at the base of the angiosperms [18-20]. Such evolutionary transitions pose the
question of what happens to ancestral ciliary proteins
when the ability to produce cilia is lost. To investigate
this phenomenon, a scoring system was defined that
identified proteins with putative orthologues conserved
in both ciliated species and also land plants, but not in
other non-ciliated species (CCP, for conserved in ciliated
and plants, see Methods). This analysis identified 21

Page 4 of 9

CCP proteins, out of the dataset of 4,802 proteins
(0.44%), that have been retained in land plants which do
not possess the ability to produce a cilium (Figure 2,
Additional file 4). In agreement with our predictions,
one of these proteins (BUG22) has previously been
detected in ciliary proteomic studies [12,26]. The
remaining proteins have no characterised ciliary function. A similar analysis within the non-ciliated fungal
lineages (present in ciliated species and non-ciliated
fungi) identifies two proteins (0.04% of the 4,802 proteins in the dataset). Neither of these two proteins are
present in the CCP set, and neither have been detected

in any proteomic study. The lower number of proteins
identified in the fungal analysis may reflect the high
level of genomic streamlining in this lineage [27].
CCP proteins localise to the trypanosome flagellum

To test the hypothesis that CCP proteins possess an
ancestral ciliary function, localisation of three proteins
from this subset was examined in T. brucei cells. These
three proteins, named TbCCP1 (the putative p60 subunit of katanin), TbBUG22 (the trypanosome orthologue
of BUG22), and TbCCP2 (a proteins of hypothetical
function) are encoded by genes Tb11.02.1370,
Tb10.70.5560 and Tb927.8.5380, respectively. Orthologues of CCP1 and CCP2 have not been detected in any
previous ciliary proteomic study, whereas BUG22 has
been identified in a proteomic analysis of Chlamydomonas cilia [12]. The localisation of each protein was investigated using endogenous locus N-terminal TY-YFP
tagging as for TbFBB17. Correct insertion of the tag was
checked by PCR (data not shown) and immunoblotting
of cell lysates with monoclonal antibodies directed
against the TY tag (Figure 2).
Fluorescence microscopy of transformed cells demonstrated that all three proteins have a localisation pattern
consistent with a role in ciliary function. Both TbCCP1
and TbBUG22 localise to the flagellum of T. brucei
throughout the cell cycle (Figure 2, white arrows). Interestingly, TbCCP2 was found to localise to a position
consistent with the basal body of the flagellum in a cellcycle regulated fashion (Figure 2, white arrows). Trypanosomes undergo morphological changes which can be
used to position cells within the cell cycle (see cartoons
in Figure 2). Early in the cell cycle, the pro-basal body
matures to form a second basal body from which a new
flagellum will extend. Shortly thereafter, the kinetoplast
(an organelle containing all the mitochondrial DNA)
divides, coupled to the separation of the two basal
bodies and extension of a new flagellum from the posterior basal body. Once the new flagellum is fully
extended, nuclear mitosis occurs and finally cytokinesis.
Examination of TbCCP2 fluorescence in the light of this
positional information reveals that TbCCP2 is not
detected just before kinetoplast division, nor during
nuclear division, but it is present on or near the basal
bodies throughout the rest of the cell cycle (Figure 2).
In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the identified
CCP proteins do indeed perform a ciliary function in a
species which can produce flagella.
Evolutionary history of CCP proteins

To investigate possible functions of the CCP proteins in
non-ciliated land plants we performed phylogenetic analysis of the identified protein sets. Understanding the
evolutionary relationships of the CCP proteins provides

Page 5 of 9

insight into possible mechanisms of neo- or subfunctionalisation. Bayesian phylogenetic inference of the identified homologous proteins of BUG22 (Figure 3) suggest
that the gene duplicated at the base of the land plants
because Physcomitrella patens a basal land plant with
the ability to produce cilia, possesses four copies of the
gene that resolve in 2 clades. Subfunctionalisation may
then have occurred with one copy retaining the ancestral ciliary role and the other being co-opted for alternative roles. Subsequently the ancestral copy was lost
within the non-ciliated land plants (represented by Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa). In contrast, the Bayesian phylogenies of the
other CCP orthologues are consistent with the hypothesis of neofunctionalisation/co-option of an ancestral
ciliary protein upon the evolutionary transition to loss
of ability to produce cilia because the genes resolve into
a single land plant clade (Figure 3).
CCP proteins are highly expressed in male floral organs
and mature pollen

While the CCP proteins have a ciliary role in ciliated
species, the question of what their function is within the
non-ciliated land plants remains. To this end, we analysed microarray data mined from a public database of
the non-ciliated flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana
[28]. The expression pattern of each of the genes at different developmental stages is shown in Figure 3,
(expression data in Additional file 5). Clustering of the
CCP expression data by fold change shows that the
genes are highly expressed in mature pollen, with an
average fold increase of 2.8. In contrast, the expression
pattern of a number of control genes shows a more ubiquitous expression pattern. We performed a Monte
Carlo estimation analysis to calculate the sum fold
change of pollen expression data for 22,640 random sets
of 21 genes within the Arabidopsis genome to determine
how likely such a fold increase in expression is. This
showed that pollen expression levels of the CCP proteins was very highly significant (p = 0.0006).

Discussion
Over 300 proteins have previously been associated with
ciliary function (for example see [17]) with most being
identified through proteomic analysis of isolated cilia (e.
g. [10,12,14,15]). However, such studies fail to detect
proteins which are not stably associated with the protein preparation used. Here, we have identified a novel
set of 56 proteins possessing a ciliary profile, through
phylogenetic distribution analysis and experimental validation in T. brucei (Figure 1). In addition we identified
21 proteins with a predicted ancestral ciliary role that
have been maintained in non-ciliated land plants (Figures 2, 3).

Flowering plants have retained CCP proteins despite loss
of ability to produce cilia

The phylogenetic distribution of cilia in land plants
shows that cilia loss occurred at least twice: once in
gymnosperms at the divergence of Ginkgo and the
Cycads from the Conifers and Gnetals and once at the
base of the flowering plants [18,19]. All other land
plants produce cilia only within specialised sperm cells
([29-32], reviewed in [20]). During the evolutionary transition to loss of cilia, many ciliary function proteins were

also lost (Additional file 3). However, we have identified
21 proteins with identifiable orthologues that are conserved in ciliated species and in the land plants (CCP
proteins). At least a subset of these proteins possess a
ciliary function in the flagellated Trypanosoma brucei,
but the function of orthologues within the non-ciliated
land plants has presumably diverged. Interestingly, a
similar analysis for those proteins conserved during the
evolutionary loss of cilia in fungal lineages identifies
only two proteins, neither of which is present in the

Hodges et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:185
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/185

CCP set. Such low (21 and 2) numbers suggest that
while loss of proteins is widespread during evolutionary
transitions, it is relatively rare for a protein to be coopted to a different function without undergoing significant sequence divergence.
The flagella localisation of all three tested CCP proteins in trypanosomes (Figure 2) supports their hypothesised ancestral ciliary role and validates the scoring
system that we used for CCP identification. While there
is limited data on the putative roles of the 21 CCP proteins in non-ciliated plants, it is of note that where
information is available they are generally associated
with cytoskeletal/microtubule roles. For example, CCP1
is a putative katanin, a class of known AAA+ microtubule-severing proteins [33] and when mutated the CCP
gene tonneau2/fass1 markedly affects cell shape and
arrangement in Arabidopsis thaliana, due to cytoskeletal
abnormalities [34]. Another CCP protein, FUSED, has
been shown to be involved in the hedgehog signalling
pathway in Drosophila, and hedgehog receptors localise
to the cilium in many species [35]. Together, these
observations suggest that CCP proteins play regulatory
roles that were ancestrally associated with cilia, but are
now maintained for cytoskeletal functions in nonciliated plants. Examination of the CCP proteins for
Pfam domains [36] which include ubiquitanases, AAA+
domain containing proteins, protein kinases, tubulintryosine ligases and phosphatidic acid phosphatases,
supports the suggestion that ancestral ciliary function
proteins have been co-opted in land plants to perform
cytoskeletal roles. Picket-Heaps [37] proposed an autogenous origin of cilia from a microtubule-organising
centre ancestrally involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic and mitotic microtubules [4]. If this was the case, it
is equally possible that upon loss of cilia evolutionary
pressures drove the co-option of cytoskeletal functions
in the opposite direction.
CCP protein function can also be inferred from the
observation that CCP genes are highly expressed within
mature pollen [28] (Figure 3, Additional file 5). This
expression pattern is curious given the ancestral role of
these proteins in ciliary formation in the sperm cells of
basal land plants and the fact that sperm cells in pollen
are not ciliated. It is conceivable that genes involved in
the cell-specific formation of cilia in basal land plants
may have acquired additional (new) functions in
gametes before the loss of cilia, and are thus maintained
in pollen on loss of cilia to perform similar cell-specific
(possibly cytoskeletal) roles in a non-ciliary context.
Such specificity would explain why only a small number
of ciliary function genes were maintained or co-opted
on the evolutionary transition to loss of cilia in seed
plants, whereas the majority were lost or diverged.

Conclusions
The work presented here demonstrates the existence of
a set of ancestral ciliary proteins within non-ciliated
land plants, and suggests that the process of cilia loss
can be accompanied by the co-option of ciliary function
proteins into novel contexts.
Methods
Bioinformatic definition of protein sets

Every predicted protein encoded in the Chlamydomonas
genome was used as a query in a reciprocal best BLAST
(RBB–see below) search with an e-value threshold of < 105
against each of the predicted proteomes of each of 45
eukaryotic organisms. During RBB, a BLAST search is performed using a query sequence against a target genome. If
the top hit from the target genome identifies the query
sequence in the reciprocal BLAST, the sequence identified
is a RBB hit. The species used in the analysis have a broad
phylogenetic distribution and include 29 organisms which
produce centriole/cilia/flagella at some point in their lifecycle (termed “ciliated”) and 16 organisms which do not
(termed “non-ciliated”). Importantly, each of these species
possess a complete or near-complete genome sequence
which is publically available. If the top hit from the RBB
was the initial query sequence from Chlamydomonas, the
identified target sequence was inferred to be an orthologue
and was thus included in the dataset. Non-reciprocating
sequences were discarded. The ciliary profile proteins
were determined as those proteins whose evolutionary distribution of orthologues within the 45 species scored
above 10 for a metric of b - 10a, (where a was the number
of non-ciliated species possessing an orthologue and b was
the number of ciliated species possessing an orthologue).
The conserved in ciliated species and plants (CCP) protein
set was defined as proteins with plant orthologues where b
> 18 and μ < 2, (where μ was the number of non-ciliated
species, excluding plant species, possessing an orthologue).
Phylogenetic inference

For phylogenetic analysis, the sequences of each protein
set were aligned using MAFFT6.24 [38] adopting the LINS-I strategy, and trimmed by eye to well aligned
blocks. A Bayesian phylogeny was inferred from the protein alignment using the metropolis-coupled Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) method as implemented in the program MrBayes3.1.2, with 2 independent
runs from random start trees using the WAG substitution matrix with a gamma-distributed variation in substitution rate approximated to 4 discrete categories [39].
Endogenous-locus tagging

Endogenous-locus tagging was performed using procyclic-form Trypanosoma brucei Lister 427 cells [40]. Cells

were maintained as axenic cultures in SDM79 supplemented with 10% v/v foetal calf serum (FCS) at 28°C, as
described by Brun and Schӧnenberger [41]. Sequences
were integrated at endogenous gene loci following the
strategy outlined in [42]. Briefly, genomic DNA for PCR
was isolated from strain Lister 427 T. brucei procyclic
cells as in [43]. PCR amplicons containing ~200 bp
from the 5’end of the target cDNA sequence (CDS) with
a linearisation site added to the 5’ end of the 3’ primer,
and ~200 from the 3’end of the 5’ intergenic region for
the target CDS with the same linearization site incorporated into the 5’ primer for this fragment, were cloned
together into the XbaI-BamHI sites downstream of TYYFP in the pEnT6P vector, such that the N-terminal
end of the CDS was in frame with YFP. The vector was
then linearised at the site between the 5’end of the CDS
and intergenic region fragments prior to transfection
into procyclic-form Lister 427 T. brucei cells as
described previously [44]. Post-electroporation, cells
were allowed to recover in normal growth media for 14
h, after which time a stable transformant population was
selected by the addition of 1 μg ml-1 puromycin.
