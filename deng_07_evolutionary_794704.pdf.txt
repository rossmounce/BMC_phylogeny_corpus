Abstract
Background: The Cytochrome P450 system is important in fungal evolution for adapting to novel
ecological niches. To elucidate the evolutionary process of cytochrome P450 genes in fungi with
different life styles, we studied the patterns of gene gains and losses in the genomes of four
filamentous Ascomycetes, including two saprotrophs (Aspergillus nidulans (AN) and Neurospora
crassa (NC)) and two plant pathogens (Fusarium graminearum (FG) and Magnaporthe grisea (MG)).
Results: A total of 376 P450 genes were assigned to 168 families according to standard
nomenclature. On average, only 1 to 2 genes per family were in each genome. To resolve conflicting
results between different clustering analyses and standard family designation, a higher order
relationship was formulated. 376 genes were clustered into 115 clans. Subsequently a novel
approach based on parsimony was developed to build the evolutionary models. Based on these
analyses, a core of 30 distinct clans of P450s was defined. The core clans experienced contraction
in all four fungal lineages while new clans expanded in all with exception of NC. MG experienced
more genes and clans gains compared to the other fungi. Parsimonious analyses unanimously
supported one species topology for the four fungi.
Conclusion: The four studied fungi exhibit unprecedented diversity in their P450omes in terms
of coding sequence, intron-exon structures and genome locations, suggesting a complicated
evolutionary history of P450s in filamentous Ascomycetes. Clan classification and a novel strategy
were developed to study evolutionary history. Contraction of core clans and expansion of novel
clans were identified. The exception was the NC lineage, which exhibited pure P450 gene loss.

Background
Fungi comprise a large and diverse kingdom of organisms.
It is estimated that as many as 1.5 million species exist in
the planet today [1,2]. Most described fungi grow by producing long, multi-celled hyphae, and are known as filamentous fungi. Filamentous fungi occupy a wide range of
ecological niches with diverse life histories and physiological processes. Many live as saprotrophs decomposing and

absorbing nutrients from dead materials while others
have evolved the ability to be pathogens deriving their
nutrients from living or dying hosts. Taking advantage of
available genome sequences to explore the evolution of
important gene families may help shed light on the processes that have allowed fungi to exploit diverse habitats.

The P450-containing monooxygenase system, an ancient
multicomponent electron transfer chain system, plays an
important role in a myriad of hydroxylation and oxidation processes leading to degradation, detoxification and
syntheses of life critical compounds. P450 proteins, as the
terminal oxidases of the system, are the ideal materials for
evolutionary studies of biodiversity and adaptation for
several reasons. First of all, P450 enzymes form a superfamily with similar heme-thiolate structures that are distributed widely throughout life forms. This implies a very
early origin of this superfamily. The first P450 gene may
have emerged more than 3.5 billion years ago, shortly
after the origin of terrestrial life [3]. Secondly, the P450
superfamily consists of a large number of genes, contributing a broad array of biological functions in individual
organisms. In addition to housekeeping functions, many
have highly specialized function as the product of adaptive evolution. For example, pisatin demethylase gene
(PDA) from Nectria species detoxifies one specific class of
the plant defence compound [4]. On the other hand,
P450s in fungi are required for biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites such as toxins and hormones. Thirdly,
expansion and divergence of P450s has closely paralleled
the evolution and coevolution of organisms. In fact, P450
gene evolution is thought to be correlated with historical
biota evolution and atmosphere oxygen concentration
flux [3]. Specifically, the occurrence of certain important
biota in history has been linked with a major branching of
P450s followed by a great expansion of the diverged
branch. In a case study of coevolution of plants and animals, it was proposed that intraspecific and interspecific
polymorphisms of P450s in the predator (animals) and
prey (plants) may be the product of the evolutionary warfare between them, i.e. plants are driven to produce
defence chemicals-toxins while animals strive to produce
new detoxifying genes [5]. For example the expansion of
CYP6 gene family in the swallowtail butterfly appears to
be linked to the ability to detoxify xanthotoxin [6].
In spite of the wide sequence diversity and function of
P450s, certain sequence motifs corresponding to the conserved tertiary structure and enzyme functions are identifiable. The signature motif (F-G-R-C-G) is required to
bind heme, however, only cysteine is absolutely conserved across all P450 genes. Another motif called the ER-R triad is thought to be important for locking the heme
pocket into position and to assure stabilization of the conserved core structure. The E-R-R triad lies in the K-helix
beginning with consensus (E-R) and ending with the Arg
in the "PER" consensus. A third relatively conserved motif
is the I-helix oxygen binding domain [A/G]G-[E/D]T [T/
S]. All these motifs are short overall and somewhat variable. To group members within the P450 superfamily,
genes are assigned into families and subfamilies based
mainly on amino acid sequence identity. Genes are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

assigned to families when they share greater than 40%
amino acid identity with reference sequences and are
assigned to subfamilies when there are more than 55%
identical [7]. Families are designated a CYP number based
on blocks of numbers reserved for different taxonomic
groups. Thus CYP51 to CYP69 and CYP501 to CYP699 are
fungal families. A higher order for grouping P450 genes,
called the clan has been proposed and applied to studies
of P450s from different kingdoms. The introduction of
clan attempts to group genes based on robust phylogenetic relationships. Genes within a clan likely diverged
from a common ancestor gene [8] and may share common functions [9]. However, clan membership parameters have not been clearly defined [10]. In fungi, few
phylogenetic studies using P450s have been reported. In a
recent report of P450ome for P. chrysosporium, 12 CYP
families were classified into 11 clans based on a phylogeny inferred by UPGMA [11].
In this study, we chose to characterize the P450s from four
filamentous fungi for which draft sequence was recently
released. We compared 2 plant pathogens, M. grisea (MG)
and Fusarium graminearum (FG), both of which are classified taxonomically as Pyrenomycetes with 2 saprotrophs,
Aspergillus nidulans (AN) and Neurospora crassa (NC). NC
is also a Pyrenomycete whereas AN is classified as a related
Plectomycete. All four fungi are Ascomycetes and share
some common ecological features. All are able to grow on
non-living organic matter, i.e. have a saprotrophic component in their lifecycle. However, MG and FG are distinct
from AN and NC because they can also derive nutrients
from living plants, behaving as parasites. In nature, MG
typically infects above ground tissue, causing foliar blast
disease of grasses and is particularly devastating on rice.
The fungus can also infect root tissue under laboratory
conditions. Its closest relatives in the Magnaporthaceae
family are all root pathogens. FG is the most common
causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease, causing sterile florets, withered kernels and mycotoxin contamination
of small grains. Both FG and MG over-winter in plant
debris or soil where they live as saprotrophs. AN and NC,
on the other hand, are not pathogenic. AN is cosmopolitan and is commonly isolated from soil. NC is also widely
distributed and typically is associated with decay of
organic materials following fires. NC is notable for the
discovery of an active defence mechanism called repeatinduced point mutation (RIP). RIP effectively mutates
duplicated DNA sequence such as invading mobile elements and has been shown recently to be present in several other fungi including MG and some Aspergillus
species. RIP has had a profound effect on the genome evolution of NC. Because gene duplication is one of the major
mechanisms for the evolution of the P450 superfamily,
we were particularly interested to investigate what effect

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

RIP may have had on the evolution of P450s in NC and
the other three fungal species.
To carry out the comparative analyses of P450s in these
fungal genomes, all identified P450 genes needed to be
first clustered in order to begin an assessment of their evolutionary relationships. However, clustering of these P450
genes was complex due to unprecedented sequence divergence. Conflicting membership of some genes to particular clusters were found when comparing results based on
standard family classification and other clustering and
phylogenetic analyses. In this report, we demonstrate that
these conflicts can be resolved through the formulation of
a standardized methodology to define high order clans. In
addition, a novel approach is designed to reconstruct the
P450 gene gain and loss history during the evolution of
these four fungi by applying comparative studies using
parsimony models.

Results
Distribution of P450 genes and designated gene families in
filamentous fungi
Inspection of the predicted open reading frame revealed
that the fungal genomes contained between 107 and 122
P450s, with exception of NC which contained 41 (Table
1). In total, 381 ORFs were identified as P450 genes from
the four filamentous fungi. Three were possible pseudogenes and two were less than 200 amino acids long, which
were excluded from further study. For the remaining 376
genes, 322 appeared to be correctly predicted. Others were
modified by the P450 nomenclature committee for possible incorrect exon calls, gene calls or fused ORFs (see
Additional file 1). Based on the standard nomenclature,
P450s with greater than 40% sequence identity were classified into a family. As a result, the 376 genes were
assigned to 168 families. One hundred and nine P450
genes in AN were placed in 79 families, 107 genes in FG
in 73 families, 119 genes in MG into 74 families and 41

genes in NC into 39 families (Table 1). Among the 168
total families, only 70 contained 2 or more members and
the other 98 families contained only a single gene, i.e.
were orphan families. Forty orphan families were present
in AN, 25 in FG, 28 in MG and 5 in NC, respectively (Figure 1). On the other hand, only 21 families contained
more than 4 genes. The largest family in this study was
CYP65 which contained 20 members. However, members
of this family were quite divergent in terms of the
sequence identity (see below, complete linkage analyses).
Furthermore, 113 families were represented in only one
fungal genome, defined as self family, in a sharp contrast
to only 13 families that were present in all four fungi (Figure 2). On average, a standard family contained less than
2 genes in each fungal genome. The sequence divergence
of P450s in these fungal genomes was considerably more
prominent than observed in animals (3~6 genes per family per genome) and plants (5~8 genes per family per
genome). In summary, our results revealed that fungal
genomes contain large number of P450 genes that have
undergone extensive sequence diversification. Relatively
few homologous gene sets are shared among the four
fungi while large numbers of gene families are unique to
a particular fungal genome.
Optimization of P450 sequence alignment
Of the total 376 genes in this study, our motif finding procedure identified the heme binding signature motif in 362
genes; oxygen binding motif in 189 genes and ERR triad
motif in 212 genes. Without any further adjustment in
repositioning these motif sequences, we found the percentage of genes with each motif aligned correctly were
93.1%, 87.3% and 96.7% respectively. To improve alignments, the 376 sequences were split into three groups
based on their signature motif alignment pattern. Group I
contained 339 genes (90.2% of 376) with their signature
motifs aligned well. Group II contained 15 (4%) genes
whose signature motifs aligned together but were 11

I. The remaining (22 genes) including the 14 P450s,
which lacked a clear signature for the heme binding motif,
were singleton sequences. Following building the profile
alignment for group I and group II separately, the two
aligned profiles were merged using profile alignment
option from ClustalX. Finally, we aligned the merged
alignment with the unaligned 24 sequences. As a result,
we obtained an improved alignment for all 376 genes; the

percentage of genes with aligned signature motif rose to
97.5% while the percentage of genes with aligned oxygen
binding motif and ERR triad motif increased to 95.8%
and remained at 96.7%, respectively.

four fungi. The three internal nodes of the cladogram are named as LCA, Node 1 and Node 2 and leaf nodes are named corresponding to the four fungi. Branches connecting these nodes are named as '0,'1','2','A','F','M','N' as shown in the square embedded in each branch. Colour codes are explained below. B.

single branch when all Operational Taxonomic Units
(OTUs) in a particular clade were from one family (see
Additional file 4 and 5). Analyses of these two collapsed
trees revealed that out of a total of 70 families containing
2 or more genes, only 7 families did not form monophyletic groups on either tree (Table 2). It should be

noted that the three families containing the largest
number of genes in the four fungi, CYP65, CYP68 and
CYP532, were within the list of 7. In addition, two families were monophyletic on the MP consensus tree but not
on NJ tree and three families were monophyletic on the
NJ tree but not on the MP consensus tree. Overall,

although the grouping of most multi-member families
was supported by the phylogenetic analyses, there were 12
exceptions (Table 2). This suggests possible inaccuracy in
tree construction or more likely inappropriate assignment
of P450s to particular families. To investigate this further,
additional analyses were conducted.
COGs are commonly used to identify sets of orthologous
genes. Our COGs analyses resulted in 80 orthologous
groups (see Additional file 6). Ten groups contained
members from all four fungi while 41 groups contained
orthologous pairs from just two genomes. Comparing the
COGs groups with the standard family designation
revealed 17 groups contained members from more than
one standard family. These results further support the
need for efforts to classify P450 genes beyond standard
family designation.
Clustering all our P450s genes was also performed based
on pairwise sequence percentage identity using the complete linkage algorithm [12]. A cutoff value of 39% was
found to yield the greatest degree of concordance with the
standard family designation. At this cutoff, we obtained
208 complete linkage families of which 137 were identical
to the standard families (see Additional file 7). Therefore,
out of 168 standard families, only 31 did not cluster as
one complete linkage group or contained member(s)
from another family. The 31 families included 29 multimember families and 2 orphan families. Inspection of all
members of a particular discordant family revealed that
the majority of multi-member families were split into several groups. Occasionally, these groups harboured members from one or more families. There were examples
where a higher degree of sequence identity was observed
to genes from other family(ies) than to members of its
own family members, even though it formed a monophyletic group with its family members.
Overall, our results from the COGs clustering and complete linkage clustering demonstrate extensive overlap
with the grouping designated by standard families. However, as noted above, members of some standard families
fell into other groupings. To investigate whether these
conflicts could be resolved, we decided to evaluate higher
order relationships.
Higher order grouping resolves the conflicting results from
different clustering methods
To establish higher order relationships, we combined all
genes belonging to one clade derived from NJ into a clan
when the connecting branch was supported by bootstrap
values >70%. According to Hillis and Bull [13], "70%"
bootstrap value corresponds to a probability >= 95% that
the clade is real. However, we recognize that equating
bootstrap value with statistical significance is not univer-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

sally accepted. Only two exceptions were made. The clade
containing all three CYP530 genes was only supported
with a bootstrap value of 44% (Table 2). However, we
included them as a clan because the three genes formed a
COG and they shared as high as 59% percent sequence
identity (see Additional file 7). In addition, we forced the
orphan clan anCYP671A1 into clan 574 that contained
anCYP671B1, the only other CYP671 family member in
our study. These two genes shared more than 43%
sequence identity, thus forcing them in same clan conserved the original nomenclature. Overall, this resulted in
115 clans (Table 2, Figure 2); 40 were shared clans (contained members from 2 to 4 fungal genomes) and 75 were
self clans (members from single fungal genomes). This
revised classification reduced the self units by 38, from
113 families to 75 clans, and cut orphans (only harbouring a single gene) by 32, from 98 families to 66 clans, indicating that we were able to identify additional
orthologous/paralogous relationships. Similarly, the
shared standard families were reduced from 55 to 40
shared clans while 70 multi-member families were
reduced to 50, reflecting a trend to cluster different families into a clan.
However, there were two exceptions to this trend. The
CYP65 family was split into 14 clans and the CYP532 family was assigned into two clans (Table 2). Our new clustering schema nevertheless resolved the vast majority of
conflicting results between standard family clustering and
other clustering methods as described in detail below:
1). Comparison of NJ tree and MP tree with standard family designation. As shown in Table 2, seven multi-member
families did not form monophyletic groups on either the
NJ tree or the MP tree. As a result of formulating clans, 5
were resolved into five multi-family clans. The remaining
2 families, CYP65 and CYP532 were split. Splitting the
CYP65 family was supported by both phylogenetic analyses and complete linkage clustering analysis. CYP65 members were dispersed on 7 and 10 different branches and
interlaced with other family members in the NJ tree and
the MP tree, respectively. Furthermore, CYP65 members
were dispersed over 10 different complete linkage groups
at cutoff value of 39%. In fact, the percent identity among
some pairs of CYP65 members was as low as 22.5%, lower
than 99.5% of all gene pairs used in this study. Therefore,
it was not surprising to find that the 20 CYP65 family
members were divided into 14 clans as a result of our reclassification process. As for CYP532, results of every analysis including the NJ tree (used to define clans), the MP
tree and complete linkage analysis supported CYP532E1
being split from the family and merged with CYP531 and
CYP631 families. Combining them formed a new clan,
clan 531.

2). Comparison of COGs clustering with standard family
designation. Out of the 17 orthologous groups which contained members from multiple families, 13 groups were
resolved into clans after our re-classification efforts (see
Additional file 6). The COG consisting of CYP614A1CYP590A1 pair and another COG consisting of
CYP665A1-CYP592A1 pair would each be clustered into a
particular clan respectively if the bootstrap cutoff was
relaxed slightly; 66% and 59% respectively. Thus, only 2
COGs, CYP60B1-CYP65A2 pair and the CYP611A1CYP636A1-CYP660A1 triplet had poor bootstrap support.
3). Comparison of complete linkage clustering with
standard family designation. There were 29 multi-member families and 2 orphan families which were not identical to complete linkage families formed at a cutoff of a
39% sequence percentage identity (see Additional file 7).
Reducing the cutoff brought together the respective members of 15 families. All members of the other 12 multimember families (not counting the two split families,
CYP65 and CYP532) could be rejoined with their respective family members by reducing the cut-off. However,
this resulted in the inclusion of members from other families. Nevertheless, each of these composite families fell
into one particular clan (see Additional file 8). Finally,
one orphan family, CYP545 was combined with CYP529
family members. This was also supported by our clan definition.
Species topology of four filamentous fungi
For four taxa there are three possible unrooted trees (Figure 3). The species tree topology constructed by the MP
algorithm based on character data matrix derived from
standard family clustering, clan clustering and COGs clustering unanimously support tree 1 (Figure 3). In a recent
comprehensive analysis, this tree is supported by the evaluation of 25 genes in 33 fungal species [14]. The monophyletic relationship of the Pyrenomycetes was supported
by phylogenies constructed using 75 randomly selected
sets of 20 concatenated genes[15]. Based on this topology,
AN, a Plectomycetes, is first split from the other Pyrenomycetes. Within the three Pyrenomycetes, FG split from the
common ancestor of MG and NC. This topology was also
supported by results from our reconcile analyses (Figure
3). In total, 17 clans contained members from all four species. Reconciling each of the 17 genes trees to each of the
three species tree topology resulted in three cost values for
each clan corresponding to each species tree topology.
Summing the cost value for each species tree topology
across all 17 clans provided the total cost for each species
tree. Tree 1 resulted in the least cost among the three
topologies (Figure 3). However, species trees constructed
using sequences of three classical genes, 18S rRNA, Î±
tubulin and elongation factor 2 did not uniformly sup-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

port a particular topology (Figure 3). Among the trees
constructed from DNA or protein sequences of each of the
3 genes and 3 different tree construction methods, all
three possible unrooted trees obtained support from at
least one gene combined with one method. However, in
many cases the bootstrap support was very weak. In the
only three cases were bootstrap values more than 95%,
two supported tree 2 and 1 supported tree 1, our preferred
topology. Interestingly, in many cases using DNA
sequence and protein sequence for the same gene resulted
in different supported trees. Regardless of the inconsistent
results using individual genes, additional analyses were
conducted using tree 1, the phylogeny supported by all
parsimonious analyses results using P450s.
Reconstruction of the phylogenetic origin of clans
Among the 15 possible character state combinations representing all possible combinations of presence or
absence of clans distributed within the four fungi (Figure
2), nine were unambiguous. Thus, the phylogenetic origin
of 79 of 115 clans could be assigned definitely on the species tree. Clans associated with the remaining patterns had
two equally parsimonious paths. Two of these, pattern 7
and pattern 8, could be resolved based on the reasonable
expectation that if a clan was present in 2 separate fungal
lineages, the clan was present in the LCA of the two lineages. To account for the remaining four patterns, we developed 2 parallel models; a gain and a loss model (see
Methods). In the gain model, ambiguous clans were considered to be absent in LCA of the four fungi followed by
a gain (0->1) event on one branch (either branch 1 or
branch A of Figure 2A) and no change (0->0) on the other
branch. For the loss model, the LCA were assumed to possess the clan, i.e. state 1, followed by a loss (1->0) event
on one branch and no change (1->1) on the other branch.

Regardless of whether considering the gain or loss model,
the number of clans gained and lost on each branch
descended from Node 1, the ancestor of the Pyrenomycetes, were the same. However, the origin of some of these
clans was dependent on these two models. In the gain
model, some clans lost in MG or NC lineages first
appeared in branch 1 (Figure 2A). In contrast, in the loss
model, all clans that were lost in MG or NC were already
present in LCA. A common finding between both models
was that only one clan was gained in the NC lineage while
30 clans were gained in MG and 18 clans were gained in
the FG lineage. On the other hand, the number of clans
gained by the AN lineage was model dependent and
ranged between 0 and 26. A further difference between the
two models was the number of clans present in the LCA;
30 based on the gain model and an additional 34 for a
total of 64 based on the loss model.

Gene duplications and losses within each clan
The number of duplication and loss events within individual clans that occurred on all branches of the species
cladogram was inferred as described in Methods. Twentyseven clans appeared to have had at least one duplication
event before AN split from the LCA (Figure 4), independent of gain or loss model, suggesting that the LCA genome
contained more than one member of these clans. In total,
genes from these 27 clans accounted for 103 P450 genes
in the LCA genome. In particular, clans containing larger
numbers of genes were usually present in the LCA. For 28
clans which contained 4 genes or more, 24 of them were
unambiguously inferred to be present in the LCA. Furthermore, we found a positive relationship (correlation coef-

ficient = 0.7) between the number of genes within a
current clan and the inferred number of ancestral genes of
the clan present in the LCA genome. However, one obvious exception was clan CYP68, the third largest clan. It
contained 20 P450 genes from the four fungi. However,
only 2 CYP68 ancestral genes were inferred to be present
in the LCA genome. Thus, it appeared that clan 68 must
have experienced considerable expansion after the AN
split. Our data suggest that there were 5 duplication events
on branch 1, 4 in branch A, 2 in branch F and 3 in branch
M (Figure 4). Therefore, clan 68 is a clear example of an
orthologous group of genes that resulted from filamentous fungal lineage specific expansion.

The remaining 88 clans from the total of 115 clans were
predominantly small clans; only three clans contained
more than 4 genes. Among these 88 clans, the number
and branch location where duplication and loss events
occurred could be unambiguously inferred for 54 clans.
For the residual 34 clans, the number of duplication or
loss events only differed between the gain and loss model
at two branches; branch A and branch 1. However, the difference between the two models was exactly "1" representing either a gain of new clan or a loss of ancestral clan in
either of the two branches.
Final resolution of gains and losses
Based on the inferred origin of each clan and the inferred
gain or loss of genes within each clan, we deduced a complete picture of the evolutionary history of P450 genes in
these four fungi (Figure 5). From the gain model, which
we favour over the loss model (see discussion), the LCA
genome had 106 P450 genes from 30 clans compared to
140 genes from 64 clans in the loss model. Since the gain
and loss models are based on two alternative extremes,
the actual number of P450 genes and clans in the LCA
may lay within these boundaries. For genes belonging to
the 30 clans present in the LCA based on the gain model
(Figure 5A), our analyses revealed that overall loss of
ancestral genes was much more prevalent than expansion.
This trend was prominent on almost every branch with
the exception of branch 1 where gene losses equalled
gains. For example, of the 106 LCA genes belonging to 30
clans, 39 in 22 clans (1.8/clan) were lost but only 13 in 7
clans (1.9/clan) were gained in the branch A descended
from LCA. Similarly, in the branch F, 39 ancestral genes
derived from LCA clans were lost in 22 clans (1.8/clan)
and only 9 in 6 clans (1.5/clan) gained. Moreover, branch
F completely lost 2 LCA clans. NC was the most extreme
example. On branch N, 47 genes derived from 24 LCA
clans (2/clan) were lost and there was no evidence of gene
gains. Furthermore, 8 LCA clans were completely lost in
this lineage. However, this trend was more modest in
branch M. Only 21 genes in 16 clans (1.3/clan) were lost,
10 genes in 6 clans (1.7/clan) were gained and 2 LCA clans
were completely lost. In sum, gene losses from the LCA
derived clans appear to have occurred much more frequently than gene gains on all branches descended from
Node1 as well as on the branch A during evolutionary history, regardless of model. The rate of gene duplication and
loss within clans was similar for three of the fungal lineages, AN, FG and MG, ranging between 1.3 and 2 events
per clan in the gain model. In the NC lineage, on the other
hand, the LCA derived genes were exclusively lost.

In addition to gene duplication and loss events from
within LCA derived clans, a large number of new clans
were created in each fungal lineage with the exception of
NC. In the NC lineage branch (branch N), there was only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

evidence for the gain of a single new clan (one gene),
whereas AN, FG and MG gained 26 (29 genes), 18 (21
genes) and 30 (37 genes) new clans, respectively (Figure
5A). These lineage specific gains occupy a significant part
of current P450omes in AN, FG and MG. They also appear
to compensate for gene losses that occurred from within
the LCA clans so that the current P450omes of the three
fungi are approximately similar in size to the predicted
number present in the LCA. NC is an obvious exception
and has much smaller P450ome compared to the LCA
and the other three fungi. This appeared to be the result of
losses of ancestral P450 genes coupled with only a single
gene gain.
Our observations above are in general consistent when
the loss model is applied (Figure 5B), the only major
exception being that the LCA genome would possess a
much larger P450ome (140 genes in 64 clans). Another
consequence of applying the loss model is that there
would be no lineage specific gains and more contraction
of the LCA clans on branch A and in the branch 1. Therefore, invoking the loss model as the other extreme does
not compromise but actually strengthens our conclusion
that the LCA derived clans experienced significant loss
events and few gains. Furthermore, the total number of
gains and losses were the same regardless of whether
applying either model on all branches descended from
Node 1, the ancestor of the Pyrenomycetes.
Evaluating the overall gene gains and losses on each of the
four fungal lineage specific branches, regardless of origin,
revealed that MG lineage gained nearly twice as many
genes compared to losses. This is in complete contrast to
FG, AN and NC. The MG lineage branch gained 51 genes
and lost 26, whereas the FG lineage branch gained 31 and
lost 44 and AN gained 42 and lost 39 in the gain model
and gained 16 and lost 47 in the loss model. The NC lineage only gained 1 and lost 54. The large number of gene
gains in the MG lineage is intriguing because this lineage
presumably evolved more recently, particularly compared
to the AN lineage.
P450 genes do not appear to be highly clustered in
filamentous Ascomycete fungal genomes
We defined a gene cluster as 4 or more P450s present
within a 100 kb sliding window of genome sequence. This
revealed the presence of 3, 3, 3 and 0 P450 gene clusters
in the genomes of AN, FG, MG and NC, respectively (Figure 6 and Additional file 9). However, none of the clusters
contained all P450 genes from the same family or clan. At
most, two genes were from the same clan or family in any
gene cluster. Furthermore, the gene pairs which resulted
from lineage specific duplication events, as inferred by our
gain model, were not located within the same clusters.

Intron-exon structure is marginally conserved
Among the 376 P450 genes, 15 contained no introns. In
contrast, CYP659A1 from AN had 24 introns, while the
next highest number of introns in a P450 gene was 12. The
remaining P450s harboured between 1 and 10 introns
(see Additional file 10). The average number of introns
present in each gene was 3.2 and totalled 1207. As

described above, P450 genes were associated with 50
multi-member clans and 65 orphan clans. Nine hundred
and eighty-six (986) introns were present in the 311 genes
belonging to multi-member clans. A string of numbers
representing the intron-exon structure and Unique Intron
Position (UIP) value for each clan are shown in Table 2
and Additional file 11. The results demonstrate that the

Page 14 of 22
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:30

intron-exon structure is not well conserved for most clans.
First of all, only 16 multi-member clans (only 4 of them
contained more than 3 genes or more) had at least one
consensus intron (an intron shared by all members of a
clan at the same aligned position). There were a total of 28
clans with more than 3 members, only 4 had at least one
consensus intron. Secondly, 39% (383) of the total 986
introns were unique (intron occupying a unique position
in the alignment). The remaining 606 introns were
present in 179 positions among the 50 clans. Therefore, it
was not surprising to observe a UIP value as high as 0.45
on average, across all clans. Thus approximately half of
the introns within each clan were unique. However, the
UIP value varied greatly among clans. There were 4 clans
with a UIP value 0 (no intron occupied a unique position)
as well as 4 clans with a value 1 (all introns occupied a
unique position) (Table 2). Values from clans other than
these eight exhibited approximately a normal distribution
with a mode value around 0.5 (see Additional file 12).
Therefore, intron-exon structures were not well conserved
for most P450 clans with a small number of apparent
exceptions. When considering individual genomes of the
four filamentous fungi, the UIP value for the majority of
clans were also high with consensus introns being rare.
For example using the largest clan, clan CYP58, consisting
of 23 genes (see Additional file 13), the UIP was 0.43 for
all 32 introns in 10 AN P450 genes in this clan, 0.22 for
22 introns in 6 FG P450 genes, 0.20 for 11 introns in 5
MG P450 genes and 0.60 for 13 introns in 3 NC P450
genes, as compared to an overall UIP value for this clan of
0.3.

Discussion
P450ome of filamentous ascomycetous fungi exhibit
considerable divergence in terms of sequence, intron-exon
organization and genome location
In this work, we discovered that filamentous ascomycetous fungi, with the noticeable exception of NC, contain in
excess of 100 cytochrome P450 genes. This is close to the
number found in the basidiomycetous fungus (P. chrysosporium), animals (human, mouse, D. melanoganster and
C. elegans), but considerably fewer than found in plants
(A. thaliana and O. sativa). Overall, between 0.2â1.1% of
the entire predicted open reading frames encode P450s. A
notable difference between the P450s in the filamentous
Ascomycetes and other organisms is the level of sequence
divergence. P450s in the fungi studied here are considerably more divergent. With the exception of NC, P450 genes
within filamentous Ascomycetes fall into more than 70
distinct families, each possessing ~1.5 genes on average,
whereas for plants and animals, the number of distinct
families ranges between 17 and 48, with each family containing between 3 to 7 members on average. In NC, each

defence mechanism, known as RIP which serves to
destroy repeat DNA sequence such as invading viruses
[16]. This mechanism presumably was able to effectively
suppress creation of new genes via gene duplication. In
contrast, P. chrysosporium has been reported to contain relatively few distinct families, each contained 10 members
on average [11]. In plants, animals as well as P. chrysosporium, intron-exon organization is well conserved
[11,17,18]. For example, the A-type (plant specific) P450
clade in Arabidopsis which contains 72 genes and several
families has very few unique introns (UIP value <0.1) and
forms a single monophyletic group. In addition, there is
one clearly conserved intron present at the same position
of almost all of the genes (group consensus intron). This
is significant because half of the genes have only one
intron while the others possess at most three introns with
one exception. This is in distinct contrast to our findings
for filamentous Ascomycetes. The vast majority of clans
containing multiple members did not contain a conserved
intron, and nearly half of the introns were unique. It is
noteworthy that the intron positions in P. chrysosporium
members of two well studied families (CYP63 and
CYP505) were generally well conserved and co-localized
in the genome [11]. This suggests that gene duplication
typically occurred locally and that these events occurred
relatively recently. In contrast, there is little evidence of
co-clustering of family members in the genome of filamentous Ascomycetes, suggesting they are more ancient
as evidenced by sequence divergence and that they have
become widely distributed about the genome predominantly through translocation events [19]. With more
sequenced fungal genomes being sequenced, we are currently investigating whether it is generally true that Ascomycetes tend to have a much more diverged P450ome
than basidiomycetes. If this turns out to be true, does this
trend apply to other gene families?
Need for higher order classification of fungal P450 genes
Our attempt to reconstruct the phylogeny for P450s in filamentous Ascomycetes was hampered by their extreme
sequence divergence and the large number of genes
involved. To initiate phylogeny reconstruction, we identified the three core sequence motifs as an aid to ensure the
best possible alignment of the sequences. The motif logo
was useful for the signature motif, but due to sequence
divergence, our ability to define good sequence logos for
the other motifs was limited. We also used introns-exon
structures to check the accuracy of our final alignments. As
shown in Additional file 11, intron position generally
aligned well in the few cases where they were conserved.
Attempts to reconstruct the overall phylogeny using the
aligned sequences by distance (NJ) or parsimonious (MP)
method were unsuccessful due to conflicting relationships
obtained by the different methods. However, by proposing a higher order grouping, the clan, the vast majority of

these conflicts evaporated. Moreover, the clan groupings
were generally very well supported by both COGS and
complete linkage clustering.
The concept of "clan" was proposed to accommodate the
flood of new P450 families designated by the standard
nomenclature committee. P450 clans were proposed to
encompass genes derived from a single common ancestor
and could contain one or more families [8]. However, previous efforts to define P450 clans in plants and animals
are somewhat arbitrary and clan classification has not
been standardized. Consequently, ten and nine clans were
proposed to occur in plants and vertebrates respectively
[20-22]. In order to formalize the clans for Ascomycete
fungal P450s, we selected groupings that were supported
by a bootstrap value of >= 70%. This value has been
adopted by many systematists as an indication of support
for a particular topology [23]. Using the 70% cutoff value
on a phylogenetic tree, we found that the vast majority of
conflicting clustering results from the different methods
used in our studies were resolved. This cutoff maybe too
stringent in some instances to define clans because there
were several examples of where pairs of orthologous genes
were clearly grouped together on the phylogenetic tree
with bootstrap value of <70%. However, making these
assessments requires considerable manual inspection.
A novel strategy to trace the ancestral history of genes in
a highly divergent superfamily
After assigning P450s into clans, we wished to identify the
ancestral origin of each clan and to explain the current distribution of genes in the four fungal species on a clan by
clan basis. An approach to begin to address these questions is to view each clan as an evolving character in the
hierarchical context of the species tree [24]. As described
in results, there is not universal support for one particular
species topology for the 4 fungal species used in our study,
however, most evidence points to the tree we settled on
for our evolutionary reconstruction studies (Tree 1, Figure
3). This topology is supported by our P450 data as well as
a recent report from Galagan et al [14], which used 33
fungi, including the 4 used in our studies, and protein
sequences from 25 genes. To reconstruct the phylogenetic
origin of P450 clans, we applied Wagner parsimony to
infer the ancestral state, which assumes gain and loss are
equally parsimonious. A common assumption was made
that clans present in two descendents were inherited from
their last common ancestor in order to resolve some paths
that were equally parsimonious. In other cases where
ambiguity could not be resolved, two models were proposed, a gain model and a loss model. The number of
character state changes resulting from application of these
two models likely represents the two extremes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

Parsimony analysis using the reconcile process was used
to explain the current distribution of P450 genes within
clans for the 4 fungal species superimposed upon the species tree. Identification of the duplication and loss events
is straightforward in the clans that exhibited a single most
parsimonious path when inferring their origin. However,
for clans that originated in branches descending from the
LCA node, it was necessary to impose a gain event at the
branch where the clan originated. On the other hand, for
clans whose origination was ambiguous, the gain or loss
model needed to be inferred prior to applying the reconcile process.
Gain and loss models were introduced to account for the
parsimonious ambiguity for inferring the origin of certain
clans. Comparing the virtues of the gain and loss models,
we believe the gain model more closely represents the real
world situation for the following reasons. First, the overall
branch length in the gain model appears to be more compatible with species evolution than the loss model,
assuming the branch length is proportional to the sum of
clans (or genes) gained and lost by each lineage. For
example, in the gain model, 26 new clans appear in the
AN lineage and no loss events from the LCA. In the FG lineage 26 clans were gained and 2 were lost for a total of 28
from the LCA (see Figure 5). Similar values would be
expected because the same period of time has elapsed
from when the Pyrenomycetes split from the Plectomycetes. In contrast, in the loss model, the AN lineage gained
no new clans and lost 8, whereas the FG lineage gained 18
and lost 28 for a total of 46. Furthermore, under the loss
model, it would not seem reasonable that while FG and
MG lineages gained new clans none appear to be gained
in the AN lineage.
It is worth noting that the number of clans and genes
present in the ancestor of the Pyrenomycetes (Node 1)
and the total number gained and lost on the descendent
branches are not model dependent, suggesting that the
evolutionary history of these P450s are robustly predicted.
The evolution of P450s in filamentous Ascomycetes
By comparing the number of genes under both models,
the LCA genome may have possessed between 106 to 140
P450 genes. The LCA thus had a similar size of P450ome
compared to the current filamentous Ascomycetes except
for NC. Thus, the P450ome size does not appear to have
undergone expansion for around 6 hundred to 7 hundred
Million years in the Ascomycete branch within the tree of
life [25]. However, based on the gain model favoured by
us as discussed above, the P450 genes in the LCA were
classified into 30 clans compared to the >50 present in
AN, FG and MG. In particular, regardless of gain or loss
model, the last common ancestor of the three Pyrenomycetes (Node 1) contained 36 clans, considerably fewer than

Page 16 of 22

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:30

present in FG and MG. Thus, during the evolution of these
fungal lineages the P450ome has continued to diverge
with the apparent loss of members from these 30 clans
and the emergence of genes in new clans. It is intriguing
to speculate whether there exists a certain selection pressure or stabilizing requirement which prohibited an overall gain in the size of the P450ome during the evolution
of these four fungi. Also, whether there is any selection
pressure to maintain a balance between these 30 conserved clans and those that newly emerged. These 30 clans
may represent the minimum P450ome of filamentous
Ascomycetes as most of them are maintained in the four
fungi (AN retains all 30 while FG lost 2 and MG lost 2,
whereas NC with a much smaller P450ome, maintained
22 of these clans). These conserved clans may represent
the core functions of P450s required by filamentous Ascomycetes and most are likely present in other related filamentous Ascomycetes. Notably, eight out of the total
eleven P450 clans in the basidiomycetous fungus P. chrysosporium [11] overlapped with these core clans. These core
clans usually contained multiple members (average 3.3)
in the LCA. Thus the loss of entire clan in other fungal lineages after the LCA would require multiple loss events of
ancestral genes, which is unlikely and would be probably
selected against. Ancestral genes in these clans were
gained and lost at a very similar rate until the FG lineage
emerged. During this same period, several new clans
appeared. Thereafter, but before the emergence of the MG
and NC lineages, loss instead of gain dominated the evolution of genes with respect to these core clans. In the NC
lineage, loss of P450 genes from core clans continued. In
the MG lineage, there was expansion of some of the core
P450 clans accompanied by the appearance of a large
number of new clans. As described in results, it is perhaps
not surprising that the NC lineage was unable to evolve
new clans and that genes were lost from ancestral clans
due to the presence of RIP. However, it is interesting to
note that regardless of invoking the gain or loss models
that there were very few genes gains to new or core clans
immediately prior to the MG and NC split. This suggests
that the ancestor common to MG and NC may also have
had a mechanism to eliminate duplicated genes. Indeed,
a RIP-like mechanism has been reported in MG and several other fungi including Aspergillus species [26]. However, RIP is not active in all MG strains and appears to be
much milder than observed in NC. Other factors, nevertheless, such as selective pressure, ecological niche adaptation may also have driven P450ome evolution. For
example, after NC and MG lineage split, the expansion of
P450ome in the MG lineage may have resulted from
increased selection pressure to successfully adapt to its
pathogenic life style on a number of grass host species. In
contrast, it is possible that P450 gene expansion would
interfere with or provide no advantage for NC to survive
as a saprotroph.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

For clans which we were unable to reliably assign origin to
the LCA, they may have been either derived from a gene
which was horizontally transferred, such as the CYP55
clan, or diverged to the extent that we can not trace their
origin to a core clan. Genes in CYP55 clan, such as
P450norA and P450norB from Fusarium oxysporum, which
encode nitric-oxide reductase, have been shown, based on
sequence comparison [27] and phylogenetic analyses
[28], to be more closely related to bacterial genes such as
streptomycetes CYP105 and CYP107 than to eukaryotic
P450s. In the latter and more typical instance, members of
new clans likely represent genes which experienced neofunctionalization following duplication from the ancestor
P450omes. These genes probably evolved at a fairly fast
rate after duplication while the selective constraint was
relaxed. Thereafter, there may have been a period of positive selection, which resulted in neofunctionalization and
their retention in the genome. Our parsimonious analyses
revealed that 31% of the MG P450ome, 20% of FG
P450ome and 2% of the NC P450ome were derived from
clans created within their own lineage. For AN, 26% were
derived from its own lineage based on the gain model.
Therefore, the MG lineage appears to have experienced a
higher degree expansion of new clans compared to the
other fungi in our study. Additionally, the contraction of
core P450 clans appears milder in MG compared to the
other three. The biological relevance of these events is
unknown; however, it may suggest that the MG has been
involved in more intense warfare with its hosts than the
other plant pathogen, FG, and/or MG has been more
active in exploiting diverse habitats than the other three
fungi. Detailed analyses including functional studies of
specific clans in these four fungi that exhibit differential
expansion or contraction are currently under investigation.

Conclusion
Our understanding of the processes that fungi evolved to
exploit a variety of ecological niches is limited but of fundamental biological importance. Among all gene families,
the P450 superfamily likely plays an invaluable role. The
four fungal genomes we studied contained a relatively
large number of P450 genes. Although, it is known that
this superfamily exhibits considerable divergence, the
level of divergence in ascomycetous fungi appears to be
unprecedented. The degree of divergence greatly hampered our ability to apply advanced or traditional phylogenetic models to build the phylogeny for these genes,
and required us to develop a novel strategy. To define
more robust gene sets, each possibly derived from a single
ancestral gene, we compared the standard family classification with results from other clustering methods. By proposing a standardized clan with 70% bootstrap support,
we successfully resolved conflicting results from a variety
of analyses. Combined with applying parsimonious prin-

ciples, we are able to construct a model which more
clearly explains the evolutionary path of P450 genes in the
four fungi used in our study. We identified 30 clans which
may represent the core functions of ascomycetous fungi
and found that the contraction of genes in these clans was
more prominent than gene gains. To compensate in some
way, a large expansion of new clans was found in three
fungal genomes, the exception being NC, which was perhaps predictable based on the presence of the RIP mechanism. Intriguingly, this expansion was even more
prominent in MG lineage. These results combined with
our other findings such as the prominent lack of conservation of intron-exon structure for P450 genes and little
clustering of homologous genes in the genome, suggest
the evolutionary history of ascomycetous fungal
P450ome is not simple and may include rapid sequence
evolution and genome evolution. It is possible that this
rapid and complicated evolutionary history may be an
essential feature for fungi to have emerged as highly successful inhabitants of planet earth.

Methods
Identification of P450s
Release 3, Release 2, Release 4 and Release 3 of predicted
open reading frames for Aspergillus nidulans, Fusarium
graminearum, Magnaporthe grisea and Neurospora crassa
respectively were downloaded from the Broad Institute
[29]. InterProScan v3.1 package [30] was downloaded
from the European Bioinformatics Institute website and
run on the coding sequence dataset for each fungus. Cytochrome P450 genes were identified containing the InterPro domain IPR001128.

All predicted P450 genes were submitted to the P450
nomenclature committee [7] for confirmation, assigning
a CYP name which provides a "standard" family and subfamily designation for each particular gene. Possible pseudogenes or genes with less than 200 amino acids were
excluded from further analyses.
Orthologous groups clustering and complete linkage
clustering
1). Orthologous groups:

Orthologous groups were formed following the COGs
(Clusters of Orthologous Groups) construction protocol
[31] with minor changes. Specifically, sets of P450s from
each genome were reciprocally blasted [32] in all combinations of genome pairs using BlastP program with an E
value cutoff of 1E-50. Genome-specific reciprocal best hits
(BeTs) between two genes from two genomes were considered a COG. Three genes from different genomes were
linked together to form a COG when all pairwise comparison resulted in BeTs. For 4 genes to be considered a COG,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

at least 5 of the 6 pairwise comparisons had to result in
BeTs.
2). Complete linkage clustering:
All pairwise combinations of P450 genes were aligned
using amino acid sequences by the SSEARCH program
[33] of the FASTA package (Pearson, W. R). SSEARCH was
run using the BLOSUM50 matrix with gap open and
extension penalties of -3 and -1, respectively. P450 genes
were then clustered using the complete linkage algorithm
of the OC cluster analysis program [12] based on the
sequence identity of all pairwise genes reported from
SSEARCH.
Identification of P450 conserved sequence motifs
Typically, P450s contain three sequence motifs. The P450
heme binding signature motif was identified by searching
for the sequence motif 'F**G***C*G'(* represents any
amino acid). Where no such sequence pattern was found,
we carried out a two-round search for variants. For the first
round, we searched for variants including '***G***C*G'
or 'F******C*G' or 'F**G***C**'. The search concluded
if at least one variant was found. Otherwise, we went to a
second round of searching for variants including
'F******C**' or '***G***C**' or '*******C*G'. When
more than two signature motifs were found, the one
which resided closest to the C terminal was selected. The
P450 ERR triad motif was identified by searching for the
sequence motif "*E**R*+PER*" (+ represents variable
length of amino acids). If more than two ERR triad motifs
were found, the one whose length was closest to 50 amino
acids and at the N-terminal side of signature motif was
chosen. P450 oxygen binding motif was identified by
searching for the sequence motif '[A/G]G* [E/D]T [T/
S]'([/]represents either or). If more than two oxygen motif
motifs were found, the one closest to the N-terminal side
of ERR triad motif was selected.
Sequence alignment
All multiple sequence alignments in the study were constructed using ClustalW [34]. For multiple sequence alignment of all P450 genes, several steps were applied based
on the aligned positions of the three motifs (P450 signature motif, ERR triad and oxygen binding site). The protocol involved: 1), a multiple sequence alignment of amino
acid sequences for all genes using ClustalW with a gap
penalty of 10, a gap extension penalty of 0.05 and Blosum
as protein matrix series; 2), marking the start position of
the three motif sequences on alignments; 3), where the
signature motifs were not aligned, genes were divided into
groups so that each group consists of genes whose signatures motifs were aligned together; 4), perform multiple
sequence alignment for each group; 5), perform profile
alignment combining all groups' alignment profiles and

6), removal of N and C terminal columns when less than
2 amino acids in data columns.
Phylogenetic tree reconstruction and assignment of genes
to clans
Neighbour Joining (NJ) including bootstrapped trees and
Maximum Parsimony (MP) trees were generated using
MEGA3 [35]. Multiple substitutions were corrected using
the Poisson distance model. Alignment gaps were treated
by choosing pairwise deletion option for the NJ method.
Close-neighbour-interchange algorithm was used to find
the MP trees. Consensus trees were generated using Consensus Program of Phylip v3.6 package [36]. Monophyletic clades in both the NJ tree and the majority
consensus tree of all MP trees whose Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) were from same family were collapsed
if they contained members from the same family. Bootstrap tests of 1000 trials were carried out for the NJ tree.
Each monophyletic clade supported by a bootstrap value
> 70% was designated as a new gene unit, defined here as
clan.
Inferring gene gains and losses
Gene gain and loss events in the whole evolutionary history of the four fungi were constructed in a two step procedure. 1. Infer origin of each clan. 2. Infer gene
duplication and loss events within each clan.

To infer the origin of each clan in the evolutionary history
of these four fungi, a two-dimensional matrix was first
built using discrete characters 1 and 0, representing the
presence or absence of member of a predefined clan in
each fungus. Each family or clan was assigned to one of a
total of 15 ((44) + (43) + (42) + (41)) possible character state
combinations. The Mix program of Phylip v3.6 package
was then applied to infer the most parsimonious species
cladogram as well as the origin and subsequent state
change of each character. The Wagner parsimony method
was chosen to allow 0->1 change and 1->0 change with
equal weight. "Print out steps in each character" and
"Print states at all nodes of the tree" options were chosen
to view the state change process for each clan. To account
for the ambiguous origination of some clans, one assumption and two alternative models were proposed. The
assumption was that clans defined by us represent truly
orthologous or paralogous groups. Thus, for clans that
contained genes from different fungal species, the common ancestor of these fungal species contained the ancestor gene of this clan. To explain clans whose origination
was not resolved after applying the assumption, a gain
model and a loss model were proposed simultaneously.
For the gain model, gain (0->1) is more possible than loss
when two equally parsimonious paths existed and verse
visa for the loss model.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/30

To infer gene duplication and loss events within each clan,
reconciling gene tree of each clan to species tree was carried out using GENETREE 1.3 [37]. To obtain a gene tree
for each clan, Maximum Likelihood phylogenies with
bootstrap were generated using Seqboot, Proml and Consensus program of Phylip v3.6 package with the JTT probability model. The diatom CYP51C1 gene sequence was
used to root all gene trees. A member of the CYP51 was
selected because CYP51 formed a distinctive evolutionary
cluster independent of other P450 families and all
"extant" CYP genes in eukaryotes were presumably
derived from this family [38-40]. The species cladogram
obtained from step 1 was used as the species tree input for
GENETREE. Specifically, three cases needed to be taken
into consideration. First, for clans that originated before
the last common ancestor (LCA) of the four fungi (see
LCA in Figure 2A), gene gain and loss events were read
directly from the reconciled trees. Secondly, for the shared
clans (contained members from 2 to 4 fungal genomes)
whose origination was after the split of AN from LCA, one
additional duplication event was required to be added in
the branch corresponding to the gain of the new clan.
Thus, the gene trees of these clans only needed to be reconciled with the corresponding 3-taxon species tree (FG,
MG, NC) for clans originated on branch 1 (see branch 1
in Figure 2A) or 2-taxon species tree (MG, NC) for clans
that originated on branch 2 (see branch 2 in Figure 2A) to
infer the following gain and loss events after the gain of
the clan. Thirdly, for clans that originated specifically in
each of the AN, FG, MG or NC lineages, the number of
duplication events for this clan in the corresponding fungal lineage equals the number of genes. Final models representing the reconstructed gain and loss events laid upon
the phylogeny of the four fungi were derived by combining results from step 1 and step 2 as described.
Species phylogeny
The species cladogram of the four filamentous fungi was
studied using three different approaches. First, we derived
the maximum parsimonious species topology using discrete characters data consisting of 1 and 0 representing
presence and absence of a certain "group" in each fungal
genome. The group data was derived from 1). standard
families 2). COG groups and 3). groups based on our
defined clans. The Mix program of Phylip v3.6 package
was implemented with Wagner parsimony. Secondly, we
used data from the reconciled gene trees of several clans to
create species trees. Specifically, we chose those clans
whose members were present in all fungi and built the
gene tree phylogeny for each of them. The cost of embedding a gene tree for a clan within a species tree (three possible topologies) was calculated by the Genetree program.
We then summed the reconcile cost of all clan gene trees
for a particular topology to calculate its overall cost. The
tree with the lowest cost was considered to most parsimo-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:30

nious. Finally, we used three classical genes, 18S rRNA,
elongation factor-2 and Î± tubulin to build the species
phylogeny. Both DNA sequence and encoded protein
sequence were used for elongation factor-2 and Î± tubulin.
In addition, NJ, MP and Maximum Likelihood methods
were applied using the protocol as described for constructing the phylogeny for P450s.
Genome distribution of pattern of P450 genes
The versions of genome assembly used to map P450 genes
on four fungal genomes were: Release 4 for MG; Release 2
for FG; Release 3 for An; and Release 3 for NC. The location of P450 genes were mapped to their respective contigs, supercontigs with orientation noted. The positions of
P450s in each genome were drawn by a custom Perl script.
Intron-exon structure
Intron and exon structure information for each P450 gene
was downloaded from Broad Institute [29]. For some
genes whose coding sequences were revised by the Standard Nomenclature Committee, the intron-exon structures
were revised in accordance. Intron-exon structure divergence between two genes was quantified as the number of
discordant introns (introns in one gene without counterpart intron in the same position and same phase in other
genes). To detect discordant introns between two genes,
sequences were aligned first using ClustalW, followed by
marking the intron positions and then comparing the
position and phase of all introns between genes. For a clan
of P450s, the intron-exon structure pattern was presented
by a number string separated by '-', which summarized
how many introns were shared by how many clan members, i.e. the first number in the pattern represented the
number of group consensus introns (introns present in all
group members because of same aligned position). The
second number following the separator '-' represented the
number of introns present in all but one gene. The third
number following the separator '-' represented the
number of introns present in all but two genes, etc. The
last number in a pattern represented the number of singleton introns in a group. In addition, we propose here
Unique Intron Proportion (UIP) to account for the dissimilarity of the intron-exon structures among a group of
P450 genes. UIP is the proportion of unique introns
(introns present at a unique position in the alignment).
Groups with higher UIP values indicate higher proportion
of unique introns and thus are less conserved for their
intron-exon structures.

The physical location of all P450 genes in AN, FG and NC genomes.
Each horizontal line represents a chromosome. Those at the bottom followed by a number represent unanchored contigs. A vertical bar above (on
5-3' strand) or below (3'-5' strand) horizontal line marks the position and
orientation of each CYP gene, the name of which is marked by omitting
the leading "CYP". The number after each gene in parenthesis represents
the clan to which this gene was assigned. For colour codes, see Figure 2.
