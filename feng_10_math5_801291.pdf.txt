cell fates

Abstract
Math5-null mutation results in the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in a concurrent increase of amacrine
and cone cells. However, it remains unclear whether there is a cell fate switch of Math5-lineage cells in the
absence of Math5 and whether MATH5 cell-autonomously regulates the differentiation of the above retinal neurons. Here, we performed a lineage analysis of Math5-expressing cells in developing mouse retinas using a conditional GFP reporter (Z/EG) activated by a Math5-Cre knock-in allele. We show that during normal retinogenesis,
Math5-lineage cells mostly develop into RGCs, horizontal cells, cone photoreceptors, rod photoreceptors, and amacrine cells. Interestingly, amacrine cells of Math5-lineage cells are predominately of GABAergic, cholinergic, and A2
subtypes, indicating that Math5 plays a role in amacrine subtype specification. In the absence of Math5, more
Math5-lineage cells undergo cell fate conversion from RGCs to the above retinal cell subtypes, and occasionally to
cone-bipolar cells and Müller cells. This change in cell fate choices is accompanied by an up-regulation of NEUROD1, RXRg and BHLHB5, the transcription factors essential for the differentiation of retinal cells other than RGCs.
Additionally, loss of Math5 causes the failure of early progenitors to exit cell cycle and leads to a significant
increase of Math5-lineage cells remaining in cell cycle. Collectively, these data suggest that Math5 regulates the
generation of multiple retinal cell types via different mechanisms during retinogenesis.
Introduction
In the developing central nervous system (CNS), different types of neurons are generated from a common
pool progenitors in a phylogenetically conserved order.
Though it is thought that the sequential generation of
CNS neurons is regulated by both extrinsic and intrinsic
factors, it is not well understood what the intrinsic factors are and how they determine the neuronal birth
order. Vertebrate retinas consist of six major neuronal
cell types and one glial cell type that originate from a
common pool of retinal progenitors [1,2] and are
arranged in three well-defined cellular layers. The primary light-sensing neurons, cones and rods, are located
in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). The interneurons,
amacrine, bipolar and horizontal cells, and Müller cells
compose the inner nuclear layer (INL). The ganglion
cell layer (GCL) contains displaced amacrine cells and
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The generation of these
retinal cells follows a defined sequence that ganglion,

horizontal, amacrine, and cone cells are the first-born
retinal cell types, and rod, bipolar and Müller cells are
generated later [3]. Loss-and gain-of-function studies
have demonstrated that transcription factors of the basic
helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain (HD) classes
play key roles in retinal cell fate determination. The retinogenic bHLH factors, such as MASH1, MATH3,
NGN2, and NEUROD1, are essential for the specification of major retinal cell types via a combined function
with HD proteins CHX10, SIX3 and PAX6 [4-8].
Though alterations in the expression of above genes
often lead to an increase or decrease in one or more retinal cell types, it is not clear whether the change in cell
types arise from cell fate switch due to the lack of cell
lineage analysis.
The vertebrate homolog of Drosophila atonal (ato),
Ath5 (atonal homolog 5), is a key regulator of retinogenesis. Null mutations of ath5 lead to agenesis of nearly all
RGCs in mice and fish and to a concurrent increase of
cone and amacrine cells [9-11]. Previous cell lineage studies using the Cre-loxP recombination system in mice
showed that during normal retinal development Math5lineage cells differentiate into ganglion, horizontal, cone,

and amacrine cells [12]. Nevertheless, it remains
unknown what the cell fate choices of these Math5-lineage cells are in Math5-null retinas and how MATH5 regulates the differentiation of non-RGCs. Furthermore, the
effect of Math5-null mutation on retinal progenitors is
not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that loss of
Math5 leads to an increase of cone, rod, and the displaced amacrine cells originating from Math5-lineage
cells and infrequently to the ectopic formation of conebipolar and Müller glial cells from Math5-lineage cells.
The observed cell fate conversion is accompanied by the
premature expression of non-RGC retinogenetic factors.
Without Math5, an increased number of Math5-lineage
cells remain in cell cycle or undergo apoptosis. The number of proliferating progenitors is transiently increased
during early retinogenesis and is reduced in the postnatal
retina. Thus, our analysis unveils a comprehensive function of Math5 in the generation of multiple retinal cell
types during the retinal development.

Results
Altered cellular composition in Math5-null retina

To investigate the multiple effects of Math5-null mutation, we first assessed the change in different retinal cell
types by co-labeling adult control and Math5-null retinal sections with cell type-specific markers (Table 1)
and quantified the labeled cells separately in three cellular layers. In the GCL of Math5-null retinas, there was
an increase in BHLHB5+ (GABAergic subtype), PROX1
+ (A2 subtype) and GAD65+ (GABAergic subtype) amacrine cells (6-, 2-and 3-fold, respectively; Figure 1A-C,
I). The ISL1+ and calretinin+ (ganglion and cholinergic
amacrine) cells were reduced by ~50% (Figure 1D, E, I),
likely due to the absence of RGCs. Consequently, the
total number of PAX6+ cells in the GCL, including all
amacrine and ganglion cells, was not significantly changed (Figure 1I and Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1A). In the INL, the amacrine cells of GABAergic
(GAD65+) subtype were reduced by 29.5% ± 9.2% and
of cholinergic (calretinin+) subtype by 34.4% ± 13.4%
(Figure 1C, D, I).
In the INL of Math5-null retinas, the total number of
amacrine (PAX6+) cells was reduced by 21.9% ± 6.2%
(Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1A) and specifically, a decrease in GAD65+ (29.5% ± 9.2%) and calretinin+ (34.4% ± 13.4%;) subtypes (Figure 1C, D, I). There
was also an overall reduction in bipolar cell number
(36.7% ± 7.5% less CHX10+ cells; Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1B) and specifically, total ON-bipolar
cells (Goa+) reduced by 37.1% ± 7.0% (Figure 1I and
Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1C); ON-rod
bipolar cells (PKCa+) by 43.5% ± 11.0%; OFF-cone
bipolar cells (VSX1+) by 48.2% ± 3.9%; and recoverin+
Type 2 OFF-bipolar cells by 76.9% ± 11.2% (Figure 1I

Page 2 of 16

and Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1C, S1D).
The reduction of amacrine and bipolar cells in the INL
of Math5-null retina was also revealed by immunolabeling with anti-BHLHB5 (46.8% ± 9.0% reduction), antiPROX1 (21.3% ± 3.8% reduction), and anti-ISL1 (19.7%
± 5.4% reduction) (Figure 1A, B, E, I). Interestingly,
while all other neuronal cell types in the INL were
reduced, the number of horizontal cells (calbinidin+)
remained the same in control and Math5-null retinas
(Figure 1I and Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure
S1F). In the ONL, rhodopsin+ and NRL+ rod photoreceptors were reduced by 30.1% ± 5.2% (Figure 1G, 1I,
and Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1G) whereas
RXRg+ cone photoreceptors were increased by 2-fold in
Math5-null retinas (Figure 1H, I). Thus, targeted disruption of Math5 resulted in significant changes in almost
every type of retinal neurons.
Fate conversion of Math5-lineage cells in Math5-null
retinas

To investigate whether there is a fate conversion of
Math5-lineage cells in Math5-null retinas, we used
Math5-Cre knock-in mice and Z/EG GFP reporter mice
to trace the fate of Math5-lineage cells. Upon activation,
Z/EG mice express a conditional GFP reporter gene uniformly in all retinal cell types (Additional file 2: Supplemental Figure S2). First, we compared the distribution
of Math5-lineage cells in the control (Math5Cre/+; Z/EG)
and Math5-null (Math5Cre/lacZ; Z/EG) retinas. Anti-GFP
labeling showed similar onset of GFP expression in control and Math5-null retinas at E12 (Figure 2A), one day
after the onset of endogenous Math5 expression. From
E12.5 to E13.5, while GFP was expressed in the neuroblast layer (NBL), the presumptive GCL, and newly
formed RGC axons in control retinas, GFP expression in
Math5-null retinas were observed in the NBL but not in
the GCL nor RGC axons (Figure 2B-D), suggesting the
agenesis of RGCs. From E15.5 to E17.5, compared with
GFP+ cells seen in the GCL and the presumable cones
in the outermost NBL of control retinas, the number of
GFP+ cells in Math5-null retinas was increased in the
NBL and in the outermost NBL but was reduced in the
innermost NBL (Figure 2E, F). At P0, GFP+ cells with
the morphology resembling horizontal cells could be
identified in the INL of the control and Math5-null retinas (Figure 2G; arrows). At P7, Math5-null retina had
more GFP+ cells in the ONL and some GFP+ bipolarlike cells in the INL (Figure 2H; arrow). At P28, GFP+
cells resembling the morphologies of photoreceptors,
horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells were seen in
control retinas (Figure 2I). In Math5-null retinas, no
discernible change in the number of GFP+ cells was
observed in the GCL and INL compared to control
retina, however, GFP+ cells in the ONL were increased

To determine the identities of Math5-lineage cells in the
ONL, we immunolabeled retinas with anti-RXRg and
anti-rhodopsin for cone and rod cells, respectively. In
Math5-null retinas, the cones and rods of Math5-lineage
(GFP+) were increased by 1.5-and 4-fold, respectively
(Figure 3A-D, 4F, and Additional file 3: Supplemental

not detect any overt change in the total number of
Math5-lineage amacrine cells in the absence of Math5
(Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3B). However,
Math5-lineage GABAergic amacrine cells (BHLHB5+ or
GAD65+) were significantly reduced in Math5 mutants
(Figure 3E-H, 4F). In contrast, there was an increase of
Math5-lineage A2 (PROX1+), cholinergic (ISL1+) and
calretinin+ amacrine cell subtypes in Math5-null

compared to control (Figures 3I, 3J, 4F and Additional
file 3: Supplemental Figure S3 D and S3C). In the GCL
of Math5-null retinas, there was an increase in displaced
amacrine cells (BHLHB5+ and GAD65+) of Math5-lineage (Figure 3E-H, 4F). In addition, anti-PROX1 labeled
GFP+ displaced amacrine cells were found in the GCL
of Math5-null retinas, which were not detected in control retinas (Figure 4F and Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3C).
In control retinas, Math5-lineage cells were not observed
in bipolar cells but loss of Math5 led to the appearance of
bipolar cells expressing CHX10 and GFP (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, these cells expressed Goa, Vsx1, or recoverin
(Figure 4B-D) but not PKCa (Figure 4E), demonstrating
that a small percentage of Math5-lineage cells switch their
fate to cone-bipolar but not to rod-bipolar cells in the
absence of Math5. Moreover, compared to the absence of

control (top panels) and Math5-null (bottom panels) retinas at indicated developmental stages were immunolabeled with anti-GFP (green) to
mark the Math5-lineage cells. (A) The onset of GFP expression starts at E12 in the NBL of the control and Math5-null retinas. (B and C) At E12.5E13, GFP+ cells are present in the NBL, the newly formed GCL, and the RGC axon bundles (arrow) of the control retina. In the Math5-null retina
no GCL neurons or RGC axon bundles are observed and there are significantly more GFP+ cells in the outermost NBL. (D-F) At E13.5-E17.5,
compared to GFP+ cells located in the GCL and the outermost NBL of the control retina, GFP+ cells in the Math5-null retina are detected
throughout the retina but no visible GFP+ RGC axon bundle are present. Moreover, there is an increase in GFP+ cells in the NBL and a decrease
in the GCL. (G) At P0, GFP is expressed in the horizontal-like cells (arrows) in the INL of control and Math5-null retinas. (H and I) At P7 and P28,

Müller cells originating from Math5-lineage in the control,
loss of Math5 also resulted in a very small number of
Math5-lineage cells adopting the fate of Müller cells
(p27kip1+/GFP+; Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure

of horizontal cells (Figure 4F and Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3E).
Changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis in Math5-null
retinas

Due to the lack of working anti-MATH5 antibody, it
remains unknown whether MATH5 is expressed in progenitors or postmitotic cells. We genetically tagged

MATH5 by fusing a HA-tag in-frame to MATH5’s Cterminus using the knock-in approach in mice and used
anti-HA to monitor MATH5 expression. The homozygous
Math5HA/HA mice were normal and had retinas indistinguishable from their wild type controls (data not shown),
indicating that the HA-tag does not interfere with the function of MATH5. Co-immunolabeling of Math5-HA retinas
at E12.5 with anti-HA and cell cycle markers demonstrated
MATH5’s expression in the NBL where it partially overlapped with BrdU and Ki67 (Figure 5A,B), indicating that
some MATH5+ cells are proliferating progenitors. When
the GCL is clearly identifiable at E13.5, labeling of Math5HA retinas showed that MATH5 expression was mostly

detected in the NBL where it partially colocalized with
BRN3B, but was absent in the newly formed GCL where
BRN3B and p27kip1 were highly expressed (Figure 5C, D).
Thus, our data indicate that MATH5 is expressed in retinal
progenitors as well as in the nascent, migrating RGCs but

its expression is turned off in the post-migration RGCs in
the GCL of the early retina.
A recent study has shown that MATH5 promotes cell
cycle exit of retinal progenitors in E12.5 mouse retinal
explants [13]. To test whether Math5-null mutation

at M-phase were increased by 10.5-fold (Figure 6E-H).
There was no significant change in the total number of
proliferating cells at E12.5 and E17.5 (Figure 6G, 6H,
and Additional file 4: Supplemental Figure S4). In postnatal retinas, loss of Math5 resulted in a reduction in
the number of BrdU+ cells by 37.1% ± 5.1% at P0 and
55.1% ± 6.4% at P3 (Figure 6C, D, G, H).
Additionally, we examined the change in apoptosis of
Math5-lineage cells by co-immunolabeling with antiGFP and anti-activated caspase-3. Compared to a low

number of apoptotic cells of Math5-lineage in control
retinas, loss of Math5 resulted in a significant increase
in apoptosis of Math5-lineage cells at E12.5 to E17.5
(Figure 7) but no overt change was found after P0 (data
not shown). Moreover, a majority of the apoptotic
Math5-lineage cells were located in the innermost layer
of developing retinas, the presumable GCL. Thus, the
change in proliferation and apoptosis could contribute
to the broad effect of Math5-null mutation on multiple
retinal cell types.

Premature expression of non-RGC regulator proteins in
Math5-null retinas

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
increased number of displaced amacrine cells in Math5null retina, we analyzed the expression of NEUROD1
and BHLHB5, two essential molecules in the genesis of

photoreceptor and amacrine cells [14-16]. Compared to
the expression of BHLHB5 and NEUROD1 in a very few
Math5-lineage cells at E13.5 in control retinas, there
was a significant increase in Math5-lineage cells expressing BHLHB5 and NEUROD1 in Math5-null retinas
(Figure 8A, B). Such an increase was first detected at

Figure 8 Loss of Math5 leads to an up-regulated expression of non-RGCs factors in Math5-lineage cells. Retinal sections from the control
(top panels) and Math5-null (bottom panels) embryos at the indicated developmental stages were immunolabeled with cell type markers (red)
and anti-GFP (green). (A, B) At E13.5, many GFP+ Math5-lineage cells express BHLHB5 (A) or NEUROD1 (B) (arrows) in the Math5-null retina but
not in the control retina. (C) At P3, compared to the control, more GFP+/BHLHB5+ cells (arrows) are seen in the GCL and less in the INL of
Math5-null retinas. (D, E) The number of GFP+/RXRg+ cone cells (arrows) is increased in Math5-null retinas at E13.5 (D) and P6 (E). Enlarged view
of boxed regions in E is shown in E’. Scale bars equal 100 μm.

E12.5, the earliest stage when Math5-lineage cells could
be identified by the Cre-loxP approach (Additional file
5: Supplemental Figure S5A, B). At E17.5, anti-BHLHB5
labeling marks cells mostly located at the opposing borders of the GCL and the developing INL (Additional file
5: Supplemental Figure S5C), these are amacrine cells.
In the absence of Math5, RGCs were rarely detected by
anti-BRN3B labeling (Additional file 5: Supplemental
Figure S5D), while more BHLHB5+ cells of Math5-lineage were seen in the GCL (Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S5C). This change was more obvious at
postnatal stages (Figure 8C, arrows). Similarly, more
amacrine cells were identified by anti-ISL1 labeling
(Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S5E), but not by
anti-calretinin that marks the late-born amacrine cells
(Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S5F).
We also analyzed the expression of NEUROD1 and
RXRg that are required for the genesis of photoreceptors. At E17.5, many NEUROD1+ cells were located
near the outermost NBL in both control and Math5null retinas. The location of these cells suggests that
they are photoreceptor cells (Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S5G). Co-labeling the retinas with
anti-RXRg (cone marker) at E13.5, E17.5, and P6
demonstrated that many of the additional GFP+ photoreceptors are in fact cone photoreceptors of Math5lineage (Figure 8D, 8E, and Additional file 5: Supplemental Figure S5H).

Discussion
In this study, we have used the Cre/loxP approach to
trace and compare the fates of Math5-lineage cells in

normal and Math5-null retinas. The results presented
here demonstrate that in the absence of Math5, there is
an increase of Math5-lineage cells adopting amacrine,
cone, and rod cell fates or choosing the new fates of
cone bipolar and Müller cells. Furthermore, the loss of
Math5 has a broad effect on retinal development including the development of multiple retinal cell types, cell
proliferation, and cell survival.
Role of MATH5 in regulating multiple retinal cell fates

Cell lineage tracing studies have revealed that all retinal
neurons and Müller cells are derived from a common
pool of progenitors, and the daughter cells of a progenitor often assume distinct neuronal identities [17-20].
These studies suggest that cell fate decisions are made
during or after the terminal neurogenic cell cycle under
the influence of environmental cues. Subsequent studies
have shown that transcription factors play pivotal roles
in the specification and differentiation of distinct retinal
cell types [8,21-23]. Thus, the interplay between cellextrinsic cues and cell-intrinsic factors is critical for the
outcome of retinal cell differentiation.
Previous analysis of Math5-lineage cells during normal
retinal development reveals that Math5 is expressed in
retinal progenitors giving rise to all horizontal and ganglion cells and to some amacrine and photoreceptor cells
[12]. Nevertheless, it is not well understood whether the
development of other retinal cells is affected and
whether there is a fate conversion of Math5-lineage
cells in the absence of Math5. Using lineage tracing analysis, we have found that in the INL of Math5-null retinas, there is a reduced number of GABAergic amacrine

Feng et al. Molecular Brain 2010, 3:36
http://www.molecularbrain.com/content/3/1/36

cells accompanied by an increase in cholinergic and A2
glycinergic amacrine cells from Math5-lineage (Figure
3). Similarly, in the GCL of Math5-null retinas, the loss
of RGCs goes together with an increase of the displaced
amacrine cells from Math5-lineage, and more rod and
cone cells arise from Math5-lineage in the ONL of
Math5-null retinas (Figures 3, 4 and Additional file 3:
Supplemental Figure S3). All of these changes clearly
demonstrate cell fate switch in Math5-lineage cells after
the ablation of Math5. Moreover, we have observed a
small number of Math5-lineage cells adopting the fate
of cone bipolar cells and Müller cells in Math5-null retinas despite that these retinal cell types are generated
postnatally during normal retinal development (Figure 4
and Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3).
The fate conversion of Math5-lineage cells from RGCs
to other retinal neurons and Müller glial cells in Math5null mice demonstrated here, extends previous loss-offunction analysis of Math5 and suggests that MATH5
directly regulates the acquisition of multiple cell fates by
retinal progenitors. MATH5 not only promotes RGC
fate but also suppresses the fate choices of amacrine,
cone, rod, cone bipolar, and Müller cells. We analyzed
the expression of NEUROD1, RXRg, and BHLHB5 that
are implicated in the development of cones, pan-amacrine cells and the subset of GABAergic amacrine cells,
respectively [15,16]. Interestingly, the fate conversion of
Math5-lineage cells is associated with the precocious
expression of these transcription factors (Figure 8).
Since Math5-lineage cells give rise to RGC and other
retinal neurons during normal development [12],
MATH5 functions as a RGC competence factor and it
alone is insufficient to specify RGC fate. We hypothesize
that during normal retinogenesis, the transient MATH5
expression provides progenitors with a brief window of
opportunity to choose RGC fate as the first choice (Figure 9). During this RGC competence period, MATH5
transiently suppresses the differentiation program of
selected retinal neurons by directly or indirectly regulating Neurod1, Bhlhb5, and RXRg and possibly interacting
with other non-RGC regulators such as Foxn4. Through
this mechanism, MATH5 influences cell fate choice and
determines birth order of retinal cells that RGCs are
generated first. Likewise, the cell fate switch of Math5lineage cells from RGC to cone-bipolar cells could result
from the up-regulation of BHLHB5 as BHLHB5 is associated with the genesis of a subset of off-cone bipolar
cells [16].
Though cell birthdating experiments show that retinal
neurons are generally produced in two phases: ganglion,
horizontal, amacrine, and cone cells are generated during the early embryonic phase, and rod, bipolar and
Müller cells are produced in the later postnatal phase
[3]. It is not clear whether the early embryonic

Page 12 of 16

progenitors in the early environment are competent to
differentiate into later born retinal cells. Surprisingly, we
have observed that in Math5-null retinas, an increased
number of Math5-lineage cells are converted into the
late born rod, cone bipolar and Müller cells (Figure 4
and Additional file 3: Supplemental Figure S3). Previous
birthdating studies in Math5-null retinas have also
shown that some Müller cells are born precociously as
early as at E11.5 [24]. Taking together, these findings
suggest that the early retinal environment could permit
the differentiation of late-born retinal cells but intrinsic
factors, such as MATH5, suppress progenitors’ potential
to differentiate into these late born retinal cells. Future
birthdating experiments of Math5-lineage cells in
Math5-null retinas will confirm this possibility. Additionally, the cell fate conversion of Math5-lineage cells
into cone bipolar cells in Math5-null retinas suggests
that the differentiation of specific bipolar subtypes
might require different intrinsic and or environment factors. Alternatively,
The role of Math5 in cell cycle

The multiple retinal cell fates of Math5-lineage cells
imply that these Math5-expressing cells are not yet
committed to a particular cell fate. We found that in
the absence of Math5, the number of proliferating retinal progenitors is transiently increased at E13.5 to
E15.5 but is reduced later in the first postnatal week
(Figure 6). The postnatal drop in cell proliferation rate
could be caused by the loss of RGCs in Math5-null retinas since SHH produced by the early born RGCs are
required to maintain the proliferation of the late retinal
progenitors and the loss of RGCs results in down-regulation of GLI1, a SHH effector, in retinal progenitors
[25]. It is likely that loss of Math5 leads to the reduced
expression of GLI1, which in turn, could account for
the reduced proliferation later. The early transient
increase in cell proliferation in Math5-null retinas is
consistent with the previous report [24]. However, it
remains uncertain whether MATH5 plays a role in driving the progenitors to exit cell cycle and whether
Math5-lineage cells remain in or re-enter cell cycle
without MATH5. Using lineage analysis, we have
observed that in the absence of Math5, the number of
mitotic Math5-lineage cells is significantly increased
(Figure 6) at E13.5 to E15.5. In a recent study, the ectopic expression of Math5 and another neurogenic gene
Ngn3 in E12.5 mouse retinal explants leads to a significant reduction in the number of progenitors in BrdUlabeled S-phase [13]. Thus, it is likely that a key role of
MATH5 in retinal development is to drive the cell cycle
exit of progenitors. Without MATH5, the retinal progenitors continue proliferating or delay the cell cycle
exit.

Figure 9 A model for the role of MATH5 in the sequential formation of early-born retinal neurons. During normal retinogenesis, the
expression of MATH5 starts in selected retinal progenitors and promotes the cell cycle exit. The transient expression of MATH5 makes the
postmitotic precursors become RGC-competent and temporarily blocks non-RGC differentiation programs by suppressing the expression of
retinogenic factors such as NEUROD1, NGN2, MATH3, BHLHB5, and RXRg. During this competence period, MATH5 activates a network of
transcription factors including BRN3B and ISL1 in some precursors to initiate the RGC differentiation program. The remaining precursors lose
RGC-competence when MATH5 expression ceases, express other retinogenic factors and generate horizontal cells (all horizontal cells are of
Math5-lineage), or along with the non-Math5-lineage precursors, produce amacrine, rod, and cone cells.

Previous studies showed that Math5 mRNA expression is largely restricted in the NBL, suggesting its
expression in progenitors [12,26]. However, studies
using Math5-lacZ reporter mice revealed a largely postmitotic expression pattern of lacZ, implying Math5
expression after the cell cycle exit of progenitors [12,24].
These contradicting observations likely reflect the transient nature of Math5 mRNA and the long half-life of
lacZ reporter protein. To resolve this issue, we have
genetically tagged endogenous MATH5 with HA-tag.
Colocalization of HA-tag and cell cycle markers reveals

significant more mitotic progenitors expressing MATH5
than previously reported using the Math5-lacZ reporter.
One possible explanation of this apparent discrepancy is
that lacZ protein is more stable than MATH5 and persists in postmitotic, differentiated cells, such as the
newly formed RGCs [12,24]. On the other hand,
MATH5 expression, revealed by the HA-tag, is likely
highly transient and mirrors the dynamic mRNA expression pattern in cells of the NBL but not in the GCL
[12,26]. The observation of Math5-lacZ expression
mostly in postmitotic RGCs of the GCL and of

Feng et al. Molecular Brain 2010, 3:36
http://www.molecularbrain.com/content/3/1/36

MATH5-HA in cells of the NBL further demonstrates
that the onset of Math5 expression begins in progenitors in the NBL and that MATH5 expression drives progenitors to exit cell cycle and to differentiate into RGCs
and other retinal neurons.
Our results have also revealed another function of
MATH5 in cell survival. Based on the increased apoptotic cells from Math5-lineage in Math5-null embryonic
retinas, MATH5 could suppress the apoptosis of retinal
cell types during normal embryogenesis. The spatiotemporal pattern of these apoptotic cells suggests their identities as RGCs and amacrine cells because most of these
cells are located near the innermost region (the presumptive GCL) of Math5-null retinas and are found
soon after the activation of lineage reporter GFP (Figure
6). Future experiments are needed to address how
MATH5 regulates the apoptosis. Nevertheless, it is likely
that the apoptosis partially accounts for the reduced cell
numbers of RGCs or amacrine cells in adult Math5-null
retina.

Materials and methods
Animals

The Math5-lacZ and Math5-Cre knock-in mice were
generated previously in our laboratory [12,27]. CMV-ßactin-Cre [28], R26R-lacZ [29], xstpx-lacZ [30], and Z/
EG [31] mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). PCR genotyping of the
reporter mice was performed according to protocols
provided by The Jackson Laboratory. Embryos were
identified as E0.5 at noon on the day at which vaginal
plugs were first observed. All animal experiments performed in this study were approved by the University
Committee of Animal Resources (UCAR) at University
of Rochester.
Immunohistochemistry

Staged mouse embryos were dissected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS at 4°C for 1-2 hours.
Isolated postnatal and adult retinas were fixed for 30
minutes. Fixed samples were saturated in 20% sucrose
in PBS and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura,
Torrance, CA) for cryosections cut at a thickness of 14
μm. Immunofluorescent labeling and BrdU pulse-labeling experiments were performed as described [12].
Working dilutions and sources of antibodies used in this
study are listed in Table 1. Alexa-conjugated secondary
antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes
(Eugene, OR) and were used at a concentration of
1:1,000. Images were digitally captured using a Zeiss 510
META confocal microscope. To quantify immunolabeled retinal cells, the number of cells per retinal section or within 350 μm field length was counted for each

Page 14 of 16

retina and at least five retinas were averaged for each
cell type. All results were analyzed for student’s t-test
significance using Microsoft Excel program.
