Abstract
Background: Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is involved in diverse cellular processes, and is targeted
to substrates via interaction with many different protein binding partners. PP1 catalytic subunits
(PP1c) fall into PP1α and PP1β subfamilies based on sequence analysis, however very few PP1c
binding proteins have been demonstrated to discriminate between PP1α and PP1β.
Results: URI (unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor) is a conserved molecular chaperone
implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including the transcriptional response to nutrient
signalling and maintenance of DNA integrity. We show that Drosophila Uri binds PP1α with much
higher affinity than PP1β, and that this ability to discriminate between PP1c forms is conserved to
humans. Most Uri is cytoplasmic, however we found some protein associated with active RNAPII
on chromatin. We generated a uri loss of function allele, and show that uri is essential for viability
in Drosophila. uri mutants have transcriptional defects, reduced cell viability and differentiation in the
germline, and accumulate DNA damage in their nuclei.
Conclusion: Uri is the first PP1α specific binding protein to be described in Drosophila. Uri protein
plays a role in transcriptional regulation. Activity of uri is required to maintain DNA integrity and
cell survival in normal development.

Background
Biochemical analysis of protein phosphatase activity led
to the identification of distinct enzyme classes based on
sensitivity to inhibitors, in vitro substrate specificity and
cation requirements. Type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) is
one of the major serine/threonine phosphatase classes
found in all eukaryotic cells. Cloning of the catalytic subunits of PP1 (PP1c) revealed that there are distinct

enzyme forms which had not been distinguished biochemically. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that there
is an evolutionarily conserved distinction between animal
PP1α (human PP1α and γ; Drosophila PP1α87B, PP1α13C
and PP1α96A) and PP1β (human PP1β or PP1δ; Drosophila PP1β9C) implying that the gene products have distinct biological functions despite their identical
biochemical properties in vitro and >85% sequence idenPage 1 of 17

tity [1]. In Drosophila larvae, PP1α87B provides 80% of
the total PP1 catalytic activity [2], with 10% each being
attributed to PP1α96A and PP1β9C [3]. PP1α87B and
PP1β9C are both essential for viability, however PP1α96A
and PP1α13C are dispensable [1,2,4,5].

RPB5 subunit of RNA polymerase, and was demonstrated
to have weak transcriptional co-repressor activity [24,25].
URI (lacking the first 75aa) has also been named NNX3
[26]. Here we present a functional analysis of the Drosophila uri gene.

PP1 has numerous diverse functions within the cell
including regulation of cell cycle, cytoskeleton, transcription and synaptic plasticity [6-9]. While, in vitro, the catalytic subunit (PP1c) dephosphorylates a wide variety of
substrates, the enzyme in vivo is found in a variety of complexes with different protein partners [10]. These PP1
interacting proteins target PP1c to specific subcellular
locations, and modulate its activity towards different substrates. When complexed to a regulatory subunit, PP1c
becomes much less promiscuous in its activity, so genuine
PP1 interacting proteins tend to inhibit PP1c activity in
standard in vitro assays (against phosphorylase a or myelin basic protein), even though their in vivo role is to promote PP1c's activity towards a specific substrate. At least
50 PP1c targeting subunits have now been described,
including the G-subunit, that targets PP1c to glycogen particles, the M-subunit that targets PP1c to myosin, and Sara
that targets PP1c to the TGFβ receptor [10-13].

Results

The three human PP1c isozymes localise to different subcellular regions in both mitotically active cells and in terminally differentiated cells [14-17]. This suggests that
there are targeting subunits that differentiate between the
PP1c proteins. So far, mammalian neurabin I and neurabin II/Spinophilin, have been shown to selectively coprecipitate with mammalian PP1γ and PP1α in preference
to PP1β [18,19]. Repo-man has a modest (3-fold) preference for PP1γ over PP1α, however the ability of Repo-man
to distinguish between PP1γ and PP1β has not been
reported [20]. Recent co-immunoprecipitation assays
have identified a few more mammalian isozyme specific
PP1-interacting proteins [21]. In Drosophila, one PP1βspecific binding protein has been described, MYPT-75D;
this probably is important for mediating the single essential function of PP1β in flies, which is regulation of nonmuscle myosin [3]. No Drosophila proteins with a preference for binding PP1α rather than PP1β have been
described.
URI (unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor) has been
implicated in modulation of the transcriptional response
to nutritional cues in humans and S. cerevisiae [22]. URI
mutant S. cerevisiae are viable, but constitutively overexpress genes important for amino acid metabolism. C.
elegans uri-1 mutant animals are also viable, but have
defects in germ cell proliferation and DNA stability [23].
Human RMP (RPB5-mediating protein) is identical to
URI, except that the clone described lacks the N-terminal
25aa. RMP was identified through its ability to bind the

Uri is a PP1α specific binding protein
To identify potential regulatory subunits of the major protein phosphatase catalytic subunit of Drosophila we
screened a yeast two-hybrid library using Drosophila
PP1α87B as a bait and isolated 25 cDNAs representing 16
different genes. One of these genes (CG11416, uri) was
represented by 2 independent clones. CG11416 has been
described as the Drosophila homologue of URI since the Nterminal region (aa 30–124, wavy box in Figure 1B) contains a Prefoldin domain, most similar to that of human
URI (RMP, NNX3), and the C-terminus contains a short
region of homology termed the URI-Box (aa 720–729,
grey box in Figure 1B) (Full alignment shown in [22], supplementary material). The uri predicted transcript encodes
a protein of 731 amino acids with a calculated molecular
weight of 84 kDa, although the protein runs at 110 kDa in
SDS PAGE, and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.66. Two
coiled coil domains outside the prefoldin domain are predicted (striped boxes in Figure 1B). Human URI does not
contain additional coiled-coil regions, but C. elegans uri-1
does. The overall acidity of the protein is partly explained
by a very acidic region at aa 170–185. Human URI also
has an acidic domain, as does worm uri-1. Drosophila Uri
has three putative PP1c binding motifs ([KR]X{0,1} [VI]X
[FW]) [27,28] at amino acids 337 (KVNF), 403 (RISF) and
469 (RNIEF), (asterisks in Figure 1B), while human URI
and worm uri-1 each contain one PP1c binding motif
(RVEF in human; KIKF in worm) at the end of the prefoldin domain. Drosophila Uri contains four predicted
nuclear localisation signals (NLS) (inverted triangles in
figure 1B); both human URI and worm uri-1 have two
NLSs. The C-terminal region of Drosophila Uri contains a
repeat sequence (from aa 504–568 and aa 587–651, stippled in Figure 1B) that shows no homology to the URI
proteins from other species, or to any other protein
sequence in the database (NCBI Blast).

The Drosophila PP1c genes encode proteins that are >85%
identical to each other and have indistinguishable activities in vitro. Nevertheless, PP1β9C is structurally distinct
from the PP1α isozymes and is encoded by an essential
gene [1], suggesting some binding partners can distinguish between PP1c isozymes. Although uri was isolated
in our small scale PP1α87B yeast two-hybrid screen, no
uri clones were isolated in a 10-fold larger scale screen
from the same library using PP1β9C as a bait [12], suggesting that Uri may be a PP1α-specific binding protein.
We directly tested this in yeast two-hybrid, and found that

Truncated proteins that could be encoded by the transcript remaining in uri110b are indicated.
Uri was able to bind all three PP1α forms, but was unable
to interact with PP1β9C (Figure 2A).
PP1c dephosphorylates a wide range of substrates in vitro;
substrate specificity in vivo is provided by targeting subunits. Addition of a PP1 targeting subunit will typically
alter substrate specificity in the in vitro reaction, and therefore inhibit the ability of PP1c to dephosphorylate a wide
variety of phosphosubstrates. We tested the ability of Uri
to inhibit the myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphatase
activities of recombinant PP1α87B and PP1β9C. Bacterially expressed Uri inhibited the PP1α87B MBP phosphatase activity with higher affinity than the PP1β9C MBP
phosphatase activity. The Uri IC50 against PP1α87B was

about 25-fold lower than that of Uri against PP1β9C (Figure 2B). No antibodies have been produced that can distinguish between the Drosophila PP1 proteins, so, to test
the interaction between Uri and PP1α and PP1β in vivo,
we ectopically expressed HA-tagged PP1α87B and
PP1β9C proteins in flies, and tested their ability to coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous Uri. arm-GAL4 [29]
flies have low-level ubiquitous expression of the yeast
transcription factor Gal4p, which activates expression of
transgenes under the control of the Gal4p target site, UAS.
Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates of arm-GAL4; UASHA-PP1α87B and arm-GAL4; UAS-HA-PP1β9C flies with
anti-Uri antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with
anti-HA antibodies, showed that HA-PP1α87B co-precip-

Uri is a PP1α specific binding protein. A. Uri binds all three Drosophila PP1α isozymes (PP1α13C, PP1α87B and PP1α96A)

reciprocal experiment, immuno-precipitation with anti-

HA antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-Uri antibodies confirmed this difference in the strength of the
interactions (data not shown). Therefore Uri is the first

Drosophila PP1c interacting protein to be shown to interact with PP1α with significantly higher affinity than with
PP1β.
Since human URI also contains a predicted PP1c binding
motif we investigated its ability bind different human
PP1c isozymes. FLAG-tagged URI/RMP was transiently
expressed in COS 7 tissue culture cells along with V5tagged human PP1α or PP1β; PP1α was expressed more
strongly in these experiments than PP1β. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibodies followed
by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibodies showed that
human PP1α co-precipitated efficiently with the human
URI. Co-immunoprecipitation of PP1β and FLAG-tagged
URI/RMP was not detected (Figure 2C). A deletion construct of human URI/RMP (RMP-D2) has been reported
[25], the region of URI/RMP included in this construct is
indicated by the bracket below the human protein in Figure 1. The putative PP1 binding sites in URI/RMP are
missing in this deletion derivative. We found no coimmunoprecipitation between either of the PP1 isozymes
and URI/RMP-D2. This consistent with the notion that
the RVEF putative PP1 binding site on URI is important
for the URI-PP1c association, although other sites missing
in the truncated protein could also be implicated in the
interaction. Drosophila Uri could also bind mammalian
PP1α with higher affinity then PP1β when they were coexpressed in mammalian tissue culture (data not shown).
Therefore, despite low overall sequence homology, the
ability of Uri to discriminate between different PP1c isozymes is evolutionarily conserved.
Uri protein is predominantly cytoplasmic
Human URI is an RPB5 binding protein [25]. This interaction, along with the predicted nuclear localisation
sequence and the known role for human URI in transcriptional regulation, would predict that at least some URI
protein should be nuclear and chromatin associated. To
test this, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged Drosophila
Uri, human URI/RMP and URI/RMP-D2 and visualised
their localisation by immunofluorescence. URI/RMP-D2
lacks the prefoldin domain but retains the ability to bind
RPB5 in COS7 mammalian tissue culture cells [25]. We
found that Uri (Drosophila) and URI/RMP (human) proteins were predominantly cytoplasmic with perinuclear
localisation (Figure 3A, B). This is consistent with the
cytoplasmic localisation for the N-terminally deleted
NNX3 clone of URI/RMP [26]. When URI/RMP-D2 was
expressed, strong nuclear localisation of the protein was
observed (Figure 3C), indicating that the regions deleted
from this construct are important for regulation of the
nuclear localisation of URI protein. Human URI/RMP has
been shown to bind DMAP1, a DNA methyltransferase-1
associated protein implicated in gene silencing, and this
interaction promotes the nuclear re-localisation of URI/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/36

RMP [24]. To test whether the interaction between Uri
and PP1 similarly altered the subcellular localisation of
either protein, we co-expressed Drosophila Uri with
PP1α87B in COS7 cells. PP1α87B, when expressed alone,
can be detected in the cytoplasm, but is primarily nuclear
(single transfected cell indicated by an arrow in Figure
3E). When PP1α87B was co-expressed with Uri, both proteins were more abundant in the cytoplasm; both the
nuclear accumulation of PP1α87B and the perinuclear
accumulation of Uri was lost (Figure 3D–F, arrowhead
indicates nucleus of a co-transfected cell).
uri is expressed throughout development, but is most
abundant during embryogenesis, pupariation, and in adult
gonads
We examined the developmental protein expression profile by Western blotting and found Uri protein to be most
abundant in early embryos and pupae. The protein could
not be detected in extracts of whole adult flies, or adults
lacking gonads, however Uri was detected in extracts of
ovaries and testes (Figure 4A). To determine the cellular
and tissue distribution of uri transcription we used RNA in
situ hybridisation. uri mRNA expression was uniform in
embryos, imaginal discs, and larval brains (data not
shown). In testes, uri was expressed in mitotically proliferating spermatogonia and in early primary spermatocytes,
with staining levels decreasing as spermatocytes matured
(Figure 4B). No transcripts were detected in post-meiotic
stages. Male germline stem cells may express low levels of
the mRNA.
Uri protein is in cytoplasmic speckles in vivo
Examination of protein subcellular localisations after
ectopic expression can be complicated by artefacts associated with saturating the normal localisation machinery.
Therefore we examined the subcellular distribution of
endogenous Drosophila Uri, using the anti-Uri antibody,
in tissues in which we know from Western blotting there
are significant levels of Uri protein. In wild type primary
spermatocytes (all stages), and maturing spermatids (not
shown) Uri was found throughout the cytoplasm, with a
distinctive concentration in small speckles (Figure 5A–C).
No specific localisation to the nucleus was apparent. Persistence of Uri into post-meiotic stages indicates that it has
a long half life, as no transcript was detected at this stage.
To test whether the localisation in testis is simply an oddity of this tissue we examined Uri localisation in salivary
glands and embryos. In salivary gland Uri was predominantly cytoplasmic, with a mild perinuclear accumulation
(Figure 5D–F). In embryos we also found that Uri protein
in interphase cells is primarily cytoplasmic, and some protein was in speckles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The speckles and uniform staining persisted in
mitotic cells, and no localisation to condensed chromosomes was found (Figure 5G–I).

Figure 3
Uri is cytoplasmic when expressed in COS7 cells, and can cause re-localisation of PP1α. FLAG-tagged Uri (A),
URI/RMP (B) or URI/RMP-D2 (C) were expressed in COS7 cells and visualised by immunofluorescence. Uri and URI/RMP
were predominantly cytoplasmic, with a perinuclear concentration and weak nuclear staining. URI/RMP-D2 truncated protein
predominantly localised to the nucleus, although cytoplamic labelling was also seen. D-F, COS7 cells transfected with FLAG-Uri
(red) and HA-PP1α87B (green). The cell indicated by an arrow is only expressing HA-PP1α87B, and shows that HA-PP1α87B
is nuclear when expressed in COS7 cells. The cell indicated by the arrowhead is expressing both HA-PP1α87B and FLAG-Uri,
and shows a predominantly cytoplasmic co-localisation for Uri and HA-PP1α87B.

Uri protein is associated with transcriptionally active
regions of polytene chromosomes
Although the majority of endogenous Drosophila Uri protein is cytoplasmic, the published interactions between
Uri homologues and RNA polymerase II suggested that at
least some Uri protein would be associated with chromatin. We examined the localisation of Uri on spreads of larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes and found that
Uri stains numerous discrete bands. Only chromatin associated proteins are preserved for staining in these spread
preparations, explaining the discrepancy between the
chromatin localisation seen in spreads and the cytoplasmic localisation seen in whole mount. Co-labelling with
an antibody recognising active RNA polymerase II
revealed that the majority of the Uri positive bands are
sites of active transcription (Figure 6A–C). Drosophila lar-

vae, when stressed by heat shock, shut off most transcription and only actively transcribe from the heat shock
response loci. This is associated with re-localisation of
RNA polymerase II to a small number of heat-shock
induced puffs on the polytene chromosomes [30]. We
found that Uri also relocated to the heat shock puffs, and
was lost from the remainder of the polytene chromosomes, on heat shock treatment (Figure 6D–F). Therefore,
although most Uri protein is cytoplasmic in salivary gland
cells, some is nuclear, and associated on chromatin with
sites of active transcription.
uri is essential for viability in Drosophila
Mutation of C. elegans uri-1 leads to sterility as well as
multiple and variable somatic defects [23]. The budding

sion of genes in the nutrient response pathway [22]. To
determine the requirement for uri in Drosophila somatic
and germ-line development we isolated loss of function
mutant alleles. Searches of extant P-element insertion
lines revealed that P{GSV6}GS16344, from the Drosophila
Gene Search Project [31] was inserted 9 bp 5' of the annotated uri transcription start; we named this allele uri1. As
the annotated 5' UTR was very short (28 bp), we used RTPCR with primers upstream of this site to delimit the
actual 5' end of the gene, and found that uri transcription
started 112–208 bp upstream of the annotated transcription start. Therefore the uri1 insertion is within the 5' UTR
of uri, 37 bp upstream of the translation start site (Figure
1A).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/36

The uri1 chromosome was homozygous lethal, however
uri1/Df(2R)Px2 males and females were viable, fertile, and
did not exhibit a detectable phenotype (Df(2R)Px2 deletes
the uri locus). Thus the lethality of the uri1 chromosome
was due to one or more second-site lethal mutations. Pelement insertions in promoters or 5' UTRs often downregulate transcription of the respective gene. Using RTPCR designed against a region 3' of the uri1 insertion, we
found that there was considerably less uri transcript in
uri1/uri1 compared to uri1/CyO, act-GFP first instar larvae,
showing that the P element in uri does indeed down-regulate uri transcription (data not shown). To generate
stronger loss of function mutant alleles, we screened for
deletions caused by imprecise excision of the uri1 P-element and found nine that specifically disrupted uri. These
deletions varied in size from 0.6 to 1.7 kb. We selected
uri110b for further analysis as it has the largest deletion,
removing the translation start, exon 2 and most of exon 3
(Figure 1A). The second site lethal mutation from the original chromosome was separated from the uri110b allele by
meiotic recombination. Although uri110b deletes a significant proportion of the uri gene, we found that a transcript
annealing most of the 5' UTR to the final 634 bp of the
wild type transcript is expressed in uri110b mutant
embryos. Two possible peptides encoded by this mutant
transcript are shown (Figure 1B).
uri is required for full expression of some genes in embryos
uri110b homozygote embryos hatch normally, as do uri110b/
Df(2R)Px2 embryos. The mutant first instar larvae
appeared sick, for example showing very little locomotion
or feeding activity, and died soon after hatching. To determine whether this lethality could be attributed to defects
in transcriptional activity we used RT-PCR to compare
expression levels of several genes in mutant vs heterozygous sibling embryos. We chose to analyse expression
of ebony, CG3999 and CG1315, the Drosophila homologues of S. cerevisiae LYS2, GCV2 and ARG1 respectively,
which were shown to be regulated by scUri [22]. Expression of ebony and CG1315 was significantly and reproducibly lower in mutant embryos than wild type embryos,
while expression of CG3999 was slightly elevated, or not
altered in the mutant background (Figure 6G). Selection
of a control gene in these experiments is not straightforward, standard choices such as a ribosomal protein are
not necessarily appropriate when signalling downstream
of TOR, which regulates growth and metabolism, could be
affected. As a control we chose PP1β9C, which we had no
reason to expect to change. Over several experiments
expression of PP1β9C was somewhat variable between in
mutant vs wild type, but there was never more than a 2fold difference in expression of this gene in the two conditions. Drosophila uri is therefore essential for normal
expression of at least two (probably more) target genes in

control embryos, PP1β9C on average was equal in mutant compared to control. CG1315 and ebony mRNA levels were significantly and reproducibly lower in the mutant embryos than in control embryos. GFP control primers confirm the accuracy of
embryo selection based on fluorescence. Asterisks indicate primer dimer bands.

embryos, but is not required for the expression of all
genes.
uri is required for cell viability in the germline
Expression of His-Myc tagged Uri was able to partially rescue the uri110b/Df(2R)Px2 lethality, so that flies of the genotype UAS-HM-uri, uri110b/arm-GALl4, Df(2R)Px2 were
mostly late pupal lethal, with approximately 2% adult
survivors. The surviving adults had weak locomotory ability and activity, and died within 24 hours. Nearly all of
them exhibited additional wing vein material along the
wing veins L2, L4, and L5; some pharate adults had small
eyes. We found that expression of a hairpin uri RNAi construct in the eye imaginal disc gave a similar small eye
phenotype (data not shown). We confirmed the absence
of full length Uri protein in uri110b with Western blotting
on wing disc samples from UAS-HM-uri, uri110b/armGAL4, Df(2R)Px2 third instar larvae (Figure 5C).

Uri protein is apparently gonad specific in adults (Figure
4A), we therefore wanted to examine the mutant phenotype in ovaries and testes. UAS-HM-uri is a P{UAST}
derivative which does not express in the female germ-line
[32], while arm-GAL4 does not express efficiently in the
male germline. This lack of germline expression means
that the UAS-HM-uri, uri110b/arm-GAL4, Df(2R)Px2 are
essentially only rescued in the soma, allowing us to analyse the requirement for uri in the germline. These animals
are developmentally delayed compared to wild-type, so
their gonads had later stages of spermatogenesis or oogenesis than age matched controls.
Testes from uri somatically-rescued males were much
smaller than their wild type counterparts (compare Figures 7A to 7B, and 7D to 7E). The testes contained a few
apparently normal spermatogonia and spermatocytes
(Figure 7E, arrow) as well as some elongated spermatids.
Post-meiotic spermatids usually had abnormal morphology, although some testes contained a small number of
normal motile sperm (Figure 7B, arrow). In addition to
the healthy cells, mutant testes were full of dying cells and
debris from dead cells (Figure 7E, asterisk). We were able
to partially rescue the testis phenotype of somatically rescued uri110b/Df(2R)Px2 mutants by additional expression
of uri in late spermatogonia and spermatocytes using the
Bam-GAL4-VP16 driver [33]. These pharate adult males
had longer testes than those lacking the germline expression (Figure 7C); the testes contained many later stages of
spermiogenesis, and numerous motile sperm (arrow in
Figure 7C). They were however not fully rescued, as they
contained only a few cysts of spermatogonia and spermatocytes, and post-meiotic spermatids were located much
closer to the apical tip of the testis than is normal (Figure
7F, asterisk, compare to 7D).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/36

The ovarioles in ovaries of wild type pharate adult females
typically have a germarium and three egg chambers, the
oldest of which is at about stage 5 of oogenesis. Ovaries
from uri somatically-rescued pharate adult females were
small, and the germaria of these ovaries were thinner than
wild type (data not shown). Most ovarioles lacked well
defined stage 1 and later egg chambers, although one or
two apparently normal later stage (up to stage 7) egg
chambers were present in most ovaries.
uri mutant cells contain damaged DNA
C. elegans uri-1 mutants, while viable, were sterile due to
germline proliferation failures caused by loss of DNA
integrity. To test whether the Drosophila uri gene also has
a role in DNA maintenance we examined testes of somatically rescued uri110b male larvae using TUNEL labelling.
As a positive control we treated wild type testes samples
with DNAse to induce DNA breaks, while untreated wild
type testes served as a negative control. We observed high
levels of TUNEL labelling of DNA in uri somatically rescued testes, indicating that these cells contained damaged
DNA (Figure 8A, B). The most mature primary spermatocytes showed lower levels of TUNEL labelling. Negative
control testes showed only background TUNEL labelling
in the cytoplasm (Figure 8C, D). We also saw elevated levels of TUNEL labelling in somatic tissues, for example in
fat body, from these larvae, consistent with their low viability to adulthood (data not shown).

Discussion
S. cerevisiae scUri (BUD27) mutants have defects in bud
site selection and in the transcriptional response downstream of TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling [22,34].
siRNA mediated depletion of URI also led to TOR
response defects in human tissue culture cells [22]. C. elegans uri-1 mutants, while viable, had pleiotropic developmental defects and were sterile due to germline
proliferation failures caused by loss of DNA integrity [23].
These apparently unconnected phenotypes suggest that
uri is involved in multiple processes, making a strong case
for its further characterisation.
Numerous lines of evidence implicate uri in transcriptional regulation. Both human and yeast URI proteins
function as weak transcriptional repressors; scUri is also a
context dependent activator [22,24,25]. Yeast URI
(Bud27p) also binds to Gis1p's jmjC (histone demethylase) domain [35]. Human RMP (URI) was identified as a
binding partner of RBP5, an RNA polymerase subunit.
Consistent with this, we found that a fraction of endogenous Uri protein is associated with sites of active transcription on salivary polytene chromosomes and this
association was maintained as the transcriptional profile
changed in response to heat shock. This is consistent with

uri is required for male germline viability and differentiation. A, wild type testis from male pharate adult. Stem cells
reside at the apical tip (asterisk), cells move distally as they mature so most of the apical region is taken up by maturing primary
spermatocytes. Elongating spermatids are seen pushing up the length of the testis. No motile sperm have yet developed. B,

a role for Uri in general transcriptional activation rather
than repression.
Given the chromatin functions of Uri-containing complexes it is surprising that endogenous Uri is predominantly cytoplasmic. The URI/RMP prefoldin domain Cterminal half, with a predicted coiled-coil structure, acts as
a cytoplasmic anchor in human cells [24]. This region
interacts with DNA methyltransferase 1-associating protein, and this interaction promotes nuclear re-localisation. The putative PP1c interacting motif of the human
protein also resides at the prefoldin domain C-terminus.
Over-expression of Drosophila Uri prevented nuclear accumulation of co-expressed PP1α, indicating that PP1 does
not promote Uri nuclear localisation (Fig 4). When ectopically expressed in human tissue culture cells, Drosophila
Uri and human URI showed a perinuclear accumulation,
this was also seen in salivary glands in vivo. In other cells,
most obviously spermatocytes, Uri localised to cytoplasmic speckles. We are unsure what organelle or subcellular
structures are associated with Uri speckles, although the
speckles do not co-localise with the Golgi apparatus, or
with P-bodies, which have similar speckled cytoplasmic
localisation patterns in spermatocytes (data not shown).
Since both ScUri and human URI have been implicated in
TOR signalling we examined expression in uri null
embryos of Drosophila homologues of genes downstream
of scUri. Two of the genes tested, CG1315 and ebony were
reproducibly expressed at lower levels in mutant embryos.
Thus, in contrast to the yeast situation, uri is required for
full expression of these genes. TOR signalling in Drosophila
is important for larval growth; mutant larvae grow slowly,
but live for up to 30 days [36]. uri110b larvae die soon after
hatching and are not developmentally delayed, indicating
that, although uri may be implicated in regulation of TOR
target genes, it probably has a wider range of target genes
and/or other cellular functions. Further examination of
the transcript profiles in mutant animals, for example by
microarray analysis, would reveal the full extent of the
transcriptional defect in uri mutant larvae. Human URI
was isolated in a complex that also contained TIP48,
TIP49, RBP5 and several small prefoldin domain proteins
[22]. Like uri, Drosophila TIP48 (reptin) and TIP49 (pontin) mutant die as first instar larvae with no obvious
defects [37], so uri lethality could potentially be attributable to defects in a complex containing these ATPases.
Uri protein is most abundant in embryos, pupae and in
adult gonads; where expression is higher in germline than
soma. This germline enrichment of fly Uri correlated well
with the sterility phenotype in worms, and led us to investigate uri's role in gonads in more detail. Partial somatic
rescue of uri mutant flies enabled us to analyse the cell
autonomous germline role, and revealed strong effects in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/36

both males and females. In both sexes the major defect
was reduced cell viability. Spermatogenesis in flies is
maintained by a population of stem cells, which give rise
to spermatogonia. Defects in stem cell self renewal or survival eventually lead to empty (or nearly empty) testes, as
stem cells are not maintained. Similarly, defects in spermatogonial survival lead to extremely small testes, as only
stem cells remain. The somatically rescued uri male phenotype is consistent with loss of stem or early spermatogonial cells. The testes were mostly filled with dead or
dying cells, indicating that uri is required for cell viability.
Very few late spermatids were found, although we could
occasionally see motile sperm. These would have initiated
spermatogenesis in early larvae, and may have been saved
by perdurance of maternally provided Uri protein. Provision of Uri to the germline using Bam-Gal4-VP16, which
expresses in late spermatogonia and early spermatocytes,
partially rescued the testis phenotype. Many more later
stages of spermatogenesis were seen, indicating that uri is
required for the viability of late spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Testes rescued by expression of uri with BamGal4-VP16 had fewer early spermatogonia than wild type
testes. The inefficient rescue of these cells show that uri is
required in all spermatogonia, and possibly also in germline stem cells, to maintain cell viability. The RNA in situ
confirms that uri is most highly expressed in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes. Somatically rescued uri
females had thinner germaria than wild type, and mostly
lacked later oogenesis stages.
C. elegans uri-1 is important to maintain DNA stability in
the worm germline. By analogy with worms, the cell death
could be due to accumulation of DNA damage; it could
also be due to transcriptional defects, as uri is required for
transcription. We established that uri mutants have
defects in maintenance of DNA integrity, as shown by
TUNEL staining. This is in complete agreement with the
C. elegans findings. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that primary defects in transcriptional regulation
lead to the DNA damage phenotype as a secondary effect.
Most PP1c interacting proteins do not discriminate
between PP1α and PP1β isozymes. MYPT-75D was the
first Drosophila protein to show differential binding, having higher affinity to PP1β than PP1α. This specificity is
linked to the essential role of PP1β in flies – non-muscle
myosin regulation [3]. Uri is the first Drosophila protein to
be demonstrated to have a strong preference for PP1α
over PP1β. An essential, non-redundant function for
PP1α is suggested by inability of PP1β to rescue PP1α
mutants [5]. Lethality of uri mutants supports the notion
that PP1α has a role that cannot be supplied by PP1β. Uri
can bind all the Drosophila PP1α isozymes, and indeed
was identified as a PP1α96A putative interacting protein
in a large scale yeast two-hybrid screen [38]. Canonical

PP1c binding sites in human and worm URI suggested
that binding to PP1 was probably conserved for this protein. We confirmed the human URI-PP1c interaction
directly, adding URI to the ever-growing list of PP1c binding proteins. More excitingly, we show that interaction
with PP1α in preference to PP1β is conserved between fly
and mammalian URI.

Conclusion
Here we have shown that Drosophila uri, is an essential
PP1α-specific binding protein. Using genetic and biochemical analyses we implicate uri in regulation of transcription, germ-line and somatic cell viability and
maintenance of DNA integrity.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/36

The pAS2-PP1c constructs used contain full length PP1c
(PP1α87B, PP1α96A, PP1α13C or PP1β9C) fused to the
DNA binding domain of GAL4 [41]. A partial cDNA clone
of the Drosophila homologue of NIPP1 (NIPP1Dm) fused
to the activation domain of GAL4 in pACT served as a positive control for two-hybrid interactions. pNKFlag-RMP
and pNKFlag-RMP-D2 mammalian expression constructs
were kindly provided by Seishi Murakami (Kanazawa
University, Japan). Mammalian tissue culture expression
constructs of human PP1α (clone H-X70848M) and
human PP1β (clone H-X80910M) in the vector
pcDNA3.1/GS were from Invitrogen. The Rpb5 ORF was
amplified by PCR from Drosophila genomic DNA and subcloned into the pET28a bacterial expression vector (Novagen).

Methods
Drosophila culture and strains
Drosophila were cultured on standard yeast/glucose/
maize (or wheat flour) media, at 25°C. Wild-type was
OregonR. P{GSV6}GS16344 was generated by DGSP [31]
and kindly provided by Toshiro Aigaki (Tokyo Metropolitan University, Japan). Bam-Gal4-VP16 was provided by
Dennis McKearin [33]. Other lines used were obtained
from Bloomington Drosophila stock centre, and are
described in Flybase [39]. UAS-HM-uri transformants
were selected by standard techniques after injection of
pP{UAS-HM-uri} into w1118 embryos. The uri110b deletion
was made by selection of w- excisions of the
P{GSV6}GS16344 element using CyO, ∆2–3 as a transposase source. In total 509 excision lines were generated,
of which 31 were lethal in trans to Df(2R)Px2. These were
tested by PCR to identify which genes in the region were
affected (CG11414, uri or CG12252).
Yeast two-hybrid screen
A two-hybrid Drosophila third instar larval cDNA library
constructed in pACT [40] was screened in the yeast strain
Y190 using a full length PP1α87B cDNA fused to GAL4
(pAS2-PP1α87B) as a "bait", as described in [41]. Two
independent clones of uri (CG11416) were isolated.
Molecular cloning and plasmid construction
A full-length uri cDNA was created from the longest partial EST available at the time (LD39507) whose 5' end is
13 bp downstream of the uri ATG initiation start codon.
The cDNA was amplified by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA
Polymerase (GIBCO BRL) with the missing sequence, to
the ATG incorporated within the 5' primer. This yielded a
2437 bp PCR product that was directionally cloned into
NdeI/NotI sites of pGBKT7 for yeast two-hybrid screening.
This uri fragment was subcloned into FLAG-pcDEF3 for
mammalian tissue culture expression, into pET-28m for
bacterial expression, and into pP{UAS-HM} [42] to create
pP{UAS-HM-uri} for Drosophila transgenesis.

Preparation of protein extracts from flies
Adult females were collected and either stored at -80°C or
used immediately. Flies were homogenized at 4°C in IP
buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol containing EDTAfree protease inhibitor mix (Roche, Indianapolis)).
Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (20 min at
10000 × g, 4°C) and the supernatants used in immunoprecipitation and pulldown experiments.
Western Blotting
For developmental western blotting, embryos, larvae,
pupae and flies were collected, frozen, homogenised in 2
× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Samples were
stored at -20°C and spun again before loading. For wing
disc samples, 20 wing imaginal discs were taken up in 10
mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 180 mM KCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM
NaVO4, 10 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 1% Triton X-100,
0.1% Tween 20 and stored at -80°C. An equal volume of
2 × SDS sample buffer was added before boiling and loading. Protein extracts were run on 10% SDS polyacrylamide
gels, and transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF nylon membrane. Western blots were stained with Ponceau S, washed
and blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk and then probed
sequentially with the primary and HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Detection was by Supersignal
chemi-luminescence (Pierce).
Preparation of recombinant proteins and phosphatase
assays
Recombinant NH2-terminal His6-tagged PP1β9C,
PP1α87B, (cloned into pET28a) and Uri (pET28m) were
expressed in E. coli BLR21 (DE3) cells. His6-tagged proteins were purified using NiNTA agarose (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Renaturation of PP1c
was carried out as described in [43]. Recombinant
PP1β9C was expressed in P. pastoris as described in [44]
and was used for the myelin basic protein phosphatase
(MYBPP) assays. The myelin basic protein phosphatase

Page 14 of 17

BMC Molecular Biology 2008, 9:36

(MYBPP) assays were performed using a Protein Serine/
Threonine Phosphatase (PSP) Assay System (New England Biolab) and [32P] ATP (5000 Ci/mmole from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One unit of MYBP
phosphatase is defined as the amount of enzyme which
releases 1 nanomole of [32P] phosphate/minute from 32P
labelled MYBP in the standard assay.
Transient transfection of COS7 mammalian cells was
achieved using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Recombinant proteins were detected by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.
Antibodies
Anti-Uri polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunising guinea pigs with recombinant full length bacterially-expressed Uri protein (Moravian-Biotechnology).
Guinea pig anti-Uri antibody was used at a dilution
1:500–1000 for Western blotting and 1:100 for immunofluorescence (1:20 for polytene chromosome). Antilamin antibody (T47, monoclonal supernatant) was
kindly provided by D. Glover (Cambridge University, UK)
and was used at 1:20–50 dilution for immunofluorescence. Anti-RMP antibody was used for Western blotting
at 1:2000 dilution and was kindly provided by Seishi
Murakami (Kanazawa University, Japan). Anti-RNAPII
H14 (Covance/BabCo) was used at 1:500 dilution for
Western blotting and at 1:100 for immunofluorescence.
Anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) was used at a dilution
1:1000 for Western blotting. Anti-Arm was used at 1:300
(DSHB, Iowa). Secondary antibodies coupled to Cy3,
Cy5, FITC and Alexa 488 were used at a dilution 1:1000
(Jackson or Molecular Probes) for immunofluorecence.
Secondary antibodies coupled to HRP were diluted
1:10000 for Western blotting.
Immunoprecipitation from flies
Lysates were pre-cleared by addition of 50 µl of Protein G
Sepharose resin (Pharmacia). Following a 15 minute
incubation on ice this mixture was centrifuged at 4°C for
1 minute 2500 × g. Aliquots of cleared lysates with 250 µg
total protein content were withdrawn and used in IP
experiments. After incubation of cleared lysates with the
antibody required, 50 µl of equilibrated Protein G Sepharose was added and incubated for 1 hour on ice. Then
resin was pelleted as before and washed 3 times with ice
cold IP buffer. The beads were finally separated by centrifugation at 4°C 20 min at 10 000 × g, resuspended in 2 ×
SDS sample buffer and subjected to western blotting.
Immunoprecipitation from COS7 cells
Transfected COS7 cells were washed twice in PBS and
lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH (7.4–8.0),
0.5% Triton-X100, 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/36

(Roche). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with 1–2 µg antibody for 1–3 h on ice with gentle
agitation. Equilibrated protein G-Sepharose was added
and incubated for 1 hour, pelleted and washed with lysis
buffer. Beads were resuspended in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample
buffer and subjected to Western blotting.
Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridisation
For tissue culture immunofluorescence, mammalian
COS7 cells were grown on coverslips, transfected as
described above, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10
minutes and permeabilized with methanol. Samples were
blocked in 10% FCS in PBS for 1 hr and then were incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody in
blocking solution. After washes the coverslips were incubated with fluorescence labelled secondary antibody for 2
hours at room temperature, were mounted on slides, and
examined by confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence
staining of Drosophila embryos and intact salivary glands
after formaldehyde fixation, and methanol devitellinisation for embryos, was carried out using standard protocols; testes were stained as in [45]. For in situ hybridisation
an anti-sense uri dig-labelled RNA probe was made by in
vitro transcription using partial cDNA in pBluescript KS as
a template, and Roche Dig-RNA labelling mix according
to manufacturer's instructions. The probe was hydrolysed
to give an average length of 100 nucleotides, hybridisation was carried out as described [46].
Staining of larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes
Immunostaining of polytene chromosomes was performed as described by [47], with minor modifications
[48]. For heat shock experiments, larvae were heat
shocked at 37°C for 20 min in a water bath and salivary
glands were dissected in PBS warmed to 37°C to prevent
recovery. DNA was detected with Hoechst 33258 (0.5 µg/
ml in water). Slides were mounted in 85% glycerol/PBS/
2.5% n-propyl-gallate. Images were collected using a Qimaging Retiga 1300 digital camera mounted on an
Olympus BX50 epi-fluorescence microscope.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR
For reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) non-fluorescent
uri110b (or uri1) homozygotes were sorted from their fluorescent uri110b (or uri1)/CyO, act-GFP heterozygous siblings. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR on uri110b three
(18.5–20.5 hours after egg laying) embryos were pooled,
and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen).
cDNA was generated from all the extracted RNA using
Superscript II (Invitrogen), and 1/40th of the cDNA reaction product was used as a template for each PCR (30
amplification cycles for ebony, 35 cycles for CG1315,
CG3999, PP1β9C and GFP). To analyse expression of uri
transcripts, and to map the 5' end of uri, RNA was
extracted from first instar larvae and processed as above.

TUNEL labelling of testes
TUNEL labelling was carried out with the "In situ cell
death detection, Fluorscein" kit (Roche). Testes were dissected from male larvae in testis buffer, transferred to a 20
µl drop of testis buffer on a poly-l-lysine treated slide, cut
open, and 40 µl of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS was
added. After 15 minutes the cells were squashed by addition of a coverslip which was then flipped off after freezing in liquid nitrogen. Slides were washed briefly in PBS,
permeabilised in PBS+ 1% Triton + 0.5% acetic acid,
rinsed in PBS then permeabilised again in 0.1% Triton,
0.1% (Tri-)Na Citrate for 4 min. As a positive control one
slide was treated with DNAse for 10 minutes. Labelling
was carried out for 1 hr at 37°C in a humid chamber using
5 µl enzyme solution and 45 µl label solution per slide.
After washing with PBS the slides were incubated with 1
mg/ml RNase A for 15 min or 0.5 mg/ml RNase A overnight at 4°C, counter-stained with propidium iodide (1
µg/ml in PBS), mounted and observed with confocal
microscopy.
