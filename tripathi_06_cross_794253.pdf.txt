Abstract
Background: Serine proteases are one of the largest groups of proteolytic enzymes found across
all kingdoms of life and are associated with several essential physiological pathways. The availability
of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa) genome sequences has permitted the identification and
comparison of the repertoire of serine protease-like proteins in the two plant species.
Results: Despite the differences in genome sizes between Arabidopsis and rice, we identified a very
similar number of serine protease-like proteins in the two plant species (206 and 222, respectively).
Nearly 40% of the above sequences were identified as potential orthologues. Atypical members
could be identified in the plant genomes for Deg, Clp, Lon, rhomboid proteases and species-specific
members were observed for the highly populated subtilisin and serine carboxypeptidase families
suggesting multiple lateral gene transfers. DegP proteases, prolyl oligopeptidases, Clp proteases
and rhomboids share a significantly higher percentage orthology between the two genomes
indicating substantial evolutionary divergence was set prior to speciation. Single domain
architectures and paralogues for several putative subtilisins, serine carboxypeptidases and
rhomboids suggest they may have been recruited for additional roles in secondary metabolism with
spatial and temporal regulation. The analysis reveals some domain architectures unique to either
or both of the plant species and some inactive proteases, like in rhomboids and Clp proteases,
which could be involved in chaperone function.
Conclusion: The systematic analysis of the serine protease-like proteins in the two plant species
has provided some insight into the possible functional associations of previously uncharacterised
serine protease-like proteins. Further investigation of these aspects may prove beneficial in our
understanding of similar processes in commercially significant crop plant species.

Background
The proper functioning of a cell is ensured by the precise
regulation of protein levels that in turn are regulated by a
balance between the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. Protein degradation is mediated by proteolysis,
which paves the way for recycling of amino acids into the
cellular pool. In addition to degradation, regulated prote-

olysis plays a major role in diverse cellular processes by
regulating biochemical activities of proteins in concert
with other cellular mechanisms such as post-translational
modification[1,2]. Serine proteases are one of the largest
groups of proteolytic enzymes involved in numerous regulatory processes. They catalyse the hydrolysis of specific
peptide bonds in their substrates and this activity depends

on a set of amino acids in the active site of the enzyme,
one of which is always a serine. They include both
exopeptidases that act on the termini of polypeptide
chains and endopeptidases that act in the interior of
polypeptide chains and belong to many different protein
families that are grouped into clans[3,4]. A clan is defined
as a group of families, the members of which are likely to
have a common ancestor. Currently there are over 50 serine-protease families known as classified by MEROPS
database[5], an information resource for peptidases and
their inhibitors.
Serine proteases appear to be the largest class of proteases
in plants[2]. Consistent with their regulatory role, plant
serine proteases have been shown to be involved in
diverse processes regulating plant development and
defense responses[2,6-8]. In addition, some of plant serine carboxypeptidases (Family S10) function as acyltransferases rather than hydrolases, suggesting diversification
of function to regulate secondary metabolism in plants [911]. However, the function and regulation of plant proteases is poorly understood primarily due to lack of identification of their physiological substrates. While there is
extensive literature available on plant serine proteases,
particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana, most of these studies
are either restricted to specific families [11-13] or specific
physiological aspects (please see the references above).
Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa constitute model systems for Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons respectively,
the major evolutionary lineages in angiosperms[14,15].
The availability of the complete genomic sequence of
these two species renders it possible to carry out a comprehensive analysis of serine-protease families to gain
insights into their function and to ascertain their evolutionary relationships.
The current analysis aims at the identification and analysis
of serine protease families encoded in the genomes of the
two plant species. The domain organization of the putative serine proteases in the two plant genomes have been
analysed employing several sensitive sequence search
methods [16-18] that have provided insights into different domain architectures. To understand the evolutionary
relationships among the Arabidopsis and rice serine protease-like proteins, phylogenetic analysis was performed
based at their protease domains. Cross genome comparison of the serine proteases across the two genomes has led
to the identification of members likely to be conserved
across the two species. Predictions of the sub-cellular
localizations of serine protease-like proteins to obtain further insight into their possible functional associations
were carried out using TargetP[19]. Comparison of plant
serine proteases with other major eukaryotic lineages
reveals selective expansion of serine protease families in
plants and identification of plant specific serine proteases.

This paper reports the first bioinformatics genome-wide
survey of plant serine proteases and cross-comparisons of
several serine protease families across monocots and
dicots. Species-specific proteases and existence of evolutionary changes like lateral gene transfer and gene shuffling were observed at the catalytic domain. Further
experimental characterization of Arabidopsis and rice serine proteases that are likely to be involved in basic functions associated with various physiological processes in
plants would be useful in expanding the current understanding of these processes in regulating plant growth and
development. This would prove beneficial in understanding protease processes in plants and application of this
knowledge to important crop species.

Results and discussion
Despite the differences in genome sizes between Arabidopsis and rice (125 Mb and 389 Mb respectively) and
encoded number of genes (25,498 and 37,544 non-transposable-element-related-protein-coding[14,15]
and
55,890 in total as in TIGR[20] rice database), the two
plant species appear to encode a very similar number of
serine protease-like proteins (206 and 222 putative numbers, respectively; Table 1; see additional files 1.2: Table
S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). These include several putative serine protease homologues that are apparently catalytically
inactive, since they either lack the amino acid residues
that are believed to be essential for catalysis or carry
amino acid substitutions at positions corresponding to
catalytically active sites. Such inactive-enzyme homologues are not restricted to serine proteases, but have been
identified in diverse enzyme families, chiefly among proteins involved in signaling pathways and proteins that are
apparently extracellular in function and are conserved
across metazoan species. They are believed to have
acquired newer and more distinct functions, in the course
of evolution, thereby adding to the complexity of various
regulatory networks in the cell[21]. We discuss below the
occurrence, phylogenetic patterns of serine protease
domains in the plant genomes by grouping according to
MEROPS classification[5]. Only serine protease families
with non-zero occurrence of putative members in the two
genomes are discussed.
DegP proteases (Family S1)
DegP proteases are a group of ATP-independent serine
proteases that belong to MEROPS[5] family S1 (trypsin
family). E.Coli DegP is a peripheral membrane protein
located in the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane.
It is a heat-shock protein that combines both chaperone
and proteolytic activities that switch in a temperaturedependent manner. The chaperone activity is predominant at low temperatures, while the proteolytic activity
takes over at higher temperatures[22]. Crystal structure of
E.coli DegP reveals that the proteolytic site is inaccessible

at low temperatures and thus, enzyme exists in chaperone
conformation (See additional file 3: Table S3.pdf)[22].
PDZ domains are known to modulate the function and/or
localization of their associated proteins and it has been
shown that PDZ domains are involved in substrate recognition and binding in certain proteases [23-26].
DegP-like proteins have been identified in bacteria and
eukaryotes but appear to be absent in archaea, and are
believed to have spread to eukaryotic lineages via horizontal gene transfer events [27-29]. The exact functions of
DegP-like proteins in plants remain unknown. A plant
DegP homolog, DegP1, was first identified in Arabidopsis
and was found to be strongly associated with the lumenal
side of the thylakoid membrane. It was found to be rapidly upregulated in response to elevated temperatures and
DegP homologue associated membrane fraction was
found to have serine-type proteolytic activity, suggesting a
possible role in chloroplast heat response[30,31]. More
recently, a chloroplast DegP was shown to function in the
initial cleavage of D1 protein of PSII (Photosystem II)
subsequent to photoinhibition[32].
16 DegP-like proteins could be identified in Arabidopsis
proteome, higher than an earlier estimate of 14[6]. Likewise, 15 DegP-like proteins were identified in rice. A
majority of these are predicted to localise to either chloroplast or mitochondria (See additional file 2: Table
S2.pdf). Of these, four gene products (At3g03380,
At3g27925, At5g27660, At5g39830) from Arabidopsis and
four
(LOC_Os02g48180,
LOC_Os04g38640,
LOC_Os05g49380, LOC_0s11g14170) from rice are predicted to contain PDZ-like domains C-terminal to the
protease domain, while the rest appear to be a single protease domain containing proteins. The absence of PDZlike domains in majority of plant DegP-like proteins has
been suggested to have as of yet unclear functional implications for these proteins[6]. We identified seven ortholo-

gous pairs of DegP-like proteins across the two genomes
(See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf). Arabidopsis DegP1
(At3g27925) was found to be chloroplast localised and
was rapidly upregulated in response to elevated temperatures[30]. We identified an At3g27925 orthologue in the
rice proteome (LOC_Os05g49380) nearly identical in size
that shares a high sequence similarity with At3g27925
and may function in a similar manner. The significant
number of predicted DegP-like proteins in the two plant
species suggests the presence of a conserved repertoire of
proteins that are likely to be upregulated in response to
elevated temperatures in thylakoid lumen and mitochondrial matrix in plants. Some putative gene products in
both the genomes are likely to be proteolytically inactive
due to either mutations or deletions in the active site residues (See additional file 5: Figure SF1.pdf). It remains
unclear whether these proteolytically inactive members
retain their chaperone activity at low temperatures, they
may modulate the function of active gene products by regulating substrate association and complex formation.
Phylogenetic analysis of the protease domains of Arabidopsis and rice DegP-like proteins showed that a majority
of sequences cluster into three major clades, supported by
high bootstrap values, with additional members less
related to the three clusters (See additional file 5: Figure
SF1.pdf). Clade I, the largest of three clusters consists of
14 DegP-like proteins that are more varied in sequence
and share between 35 and 95% pairwise amino acid
sequence identity, Clade II consists of six closely related
sequences that share between 50 and 93% pairwise
sequence identity with each other. Clade II includes two
sequence pairs At3g27925:LOC_Os05g49380 and
At5g39830:LOC_Os04g38640 that carry a PDZ domain
each C-terminal to the protease domain and share 93%
and 87% pairwise sequence identity respectively. Clade
III, the smallest of three clades, consists of five sequences
that share between 51 and 94% pairwise sequence iden-

tity with each other. In addition, there are two pairs of

proteins,
At5g27660:LOC_Os11g14170
and
At3g03380:LOC_Os02g48180, that share 58 and 50%
pairwise sequence identity respectively.
Subtilisins (Family S8)
The subtilisin family is the second largest family of serine
proteases identified till date with over 200 known members across lineages in eubacteria, archaebacteria, eukaryotes and viruses. Crystal structures reveal that subtilisins
utilize a highly conserved catalytic triad similar to the
members of chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase clans
but have a different order of Asp, His and Ser residues in
the sequence (D137, H168, S325) with no other structural similarity[33] posing a case of convergent evolution.
MEROPS database[5] subdivides the subtilisin family into
two subfamilies: S8A (subtilisin subfamily) consisting of
true subtilisins and S8B (kexin subfamily) consisting of
proprotein-processing enzymes. An interesting feature of
the subtilisin family is that some members appear to be
mosaic with little or no sequence similarity to any other
known proteins[33] and with large N- and C-terminal
extensions.

A large number of subtilisin-like serine proteases have
been identified in various plant species, where they have
been implicated in diverse processes (See additional file 3:
Table S3.pdf) and all appear to correspond to S8A subfamily, while kexin-type proteins appear to be absent
from plants[2,12,34,35]. It has been reported that both
Arabidopsis and rice are characterised by significantly
larger number of subtilases in comparison to other organisms such as human, Caenorahabditis and Drosophila, suggesting that expansion of the subtilase gene family in the
two plant species is due to multiple duplication
events[35].
We have identified 56 subtilisin-like proteins in Arabidopsis proteome, similar to the figures reported elsewhere[12,35] and 63 in rice. A majority of these gene
products, as expected, are predicted to be secretory pathway proteins, though a few are predicted to localise to
chloroplasts and mitochondria (See additional files 1, 2:
Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The analysis of the domain
architectures of Arabidopsis and rice subtilisin-like proteins
reveals that most of these gene products consist of three
domains: an N-terminal Subtilisin_N domain that is
removed prior to activation of the enzyme, Peptidase_S8
domain and the protease associated (PA) domain, that
occurs as a C-terminal insertion in the Peptidase_S8
domain of a majority of subtilisin-like proteins identified
in these two plant species (See additional files 1, 2: Table
S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The PA domain is believed to be
involved in protein-protein interactions or mediate sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

strate recognition by peptidases and is believed to have
been associated with ancestral subtilases[35,36]. In addition, most subtilisin-like proteins identified in the two
plant species, carry short insertions ranging from 15â45
amino acid residues in length in the N-terminal region of
their predicted protease domains. These insertions do not
share any obvious sequence similarities with any other
known module and are likely to be unique in their association with Arabidopsis and rice subtilisin-like proteins
(data not shown). However, the presence of gene products
in both the proteomes with only the protease domain suggests that this domain alone is sufficient for the activity of
these enzymes (See additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf,
Table S2.pdf). The Arabidopsis proteome contains two
gene products At2g19170 and At4g30020 that appear to
possess an additional module, classified as DUF1034
(Pfam[37] accession: PF06280), C-terminal to the PA
domain, while a single similar gene product
LOC_Os06g48650 was identified in rice proteome, suggesting a duplication of this gene in Arabidopsis subsequent to dicot-monocot divergence (Figure 2; see
additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The lack
of diverse domain architecture in plant subtilisin-like proteins, suggests that specific expansion of subtilisin gene
family in the two plant species has been facilitated by
extensive gene duplication. This is further supported by
the observation that only 16 orthologous pairs were identified across the two species, suggesting that the majority
of subtilisin-like proteins in the two species arose after
dicot-monocot divergence, possible due to gene duplication (See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf). It is likely that
spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression patterns may play a major role in regulating the activity of
subtilisin-like proteins in plants. The presence of a large
number of subtilisin-like proteins in the two plant species
suggests possible functional redundancy, while on the
other hand it may be indicative of functional diversification. A significant number of plant subtilisins may have
been recruited for functions in plant secondary metabolism, in a manner similar to some serine carboxypeptidase-like proteins. The subtilisin-like proteins identified
here in Arabidopsis and rice as well as those reported from
other plant species show maximum similarity to
MEROPS[5] S8A subfamily of subtilisins. A few gene
products are likely to be proteolytically inactive due to
mutations in the catalytic residues and are most likely to
be evolutionary intermediates (See additional file 6: Figure SF2.pdf).
Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice subtilisinlike proteins was carried out with the S8 protease domain
minus the insertions. The analysis reveals the presence of
five major gene clusters of which four consist of subtilisinlike proteins from both Arabidopsis and rice including
orthologous pairs (Figure 1). Clade I consists of 13

sequences that share between 44 and 76% pairwise
sequence identity with each other. Clade II, the smallest of
five clusters consists of six sequences from Arabidopsis
and three from rice that share between 48 and 84%
sequence identity with each other. Clade III consists of 31
sequences from both the plant species that share between
40 and 80% sequence identity with each other. The members of Clade III may be grouped into two sub-clusters.
Clade IV appears to be the largest and most diverse cluster
of Arabidopsis and rice subtilisin-like proteins. It includes
40 sequences that share between 35 and 92% pairwise
percentage identity with each other. On the basis of pairwise percentage identities between the constituent
sequences, Clade IV may be further subdivided into three
subclusters: Clade IVA, IVB and IVC. Clade IVA consists
exclusively of Arabidopsis sequences that share between
47 and 91% sequence identity with each other and
between 35 and 60% sequence identity with the rest of the
Clade IV sequences. In contrast, Clade IVB and Clade IVC,
consist exclusively of rice subtilisin-like proteins. Clade
IVB the smallest of three subclusters, consists of sequences
that share between 45 and 81% sequence identity with
each other, while sharing between 35 and 60% sequence
identity with the remaining members of Clade IV. Clade
IVC sequences share between 54 and 92% sequence identity with each other and between 44 and 61% sequence
identity with the rest of the constituents of Clade IV. Clade
V is an exclusive cluster of Arabidopsis subtilisin-like proteins that are between 41 and 85% identical with each
other and most likely represent an Arabidopsis specific
subfamily of subtilisin-like proteins. Our observations
appear consistent with a recent report that identifies the
presence of four major clusters of orthologous groups and
a fifth cluster of Arabidopsis sequences within the phylogenetic tree constructed with Arabidopsis and rice sutbilisin-like proteins[35]. We identified a few gene subclusters that consist exclusively of Arabidopsis or rice subtilisin-like gene products indicating the existence of Arabidopsis or rice subtilisin-like genes and by extension
putative dicot- and monocot-specific subtilisin-like genes
(Figure 1).
Prolyl oligopeptidases (Family S9)
The members of Prolyl oligopeptidases (POPs) family of
serine peptidases belong to the Î±/Î² hydrolase fold
grouped into SC clan of serine peptidases. The family
includes members of different types and with distinct specificities. For example, prolyl oligopeptidase is an
endopeptidase localised to the cytosol, while dipeptidyl
peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a membrane bound exopeptidase. According to MEROPS database[5], POPs may be
classified into four subfamilies with prolyl oligopeptidase
(S9A), dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (S9B), aminoacyl-peptidase (S9C) and glutamyl endopeptidase (S9D) being the
typical examples of their respective subfamilies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

POPs have been implicated in degradation of biologically
important peptides such as peptide hormones and neuropeptides associated with learning and memory and
therefore have become significant targets for drug
design[38]. They have been identified in organisms from
all forms of life, though members of this family display
differences in mutation rates and appear to have undergone several changes in their localization over the course
of evolution[39,40].
We identified 23 genes encoding prolyl oligopeptidaselike proteins in Arabidopsis and 23 in rice. A majority of
these either lack a predicted signal sequence or are predicted to localise to chloroplast and mitochondria. Only
few gene products identified here are predicted to carry a
Î²-propeller N-terminal to the protease domain (See additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The absence
of the N-terminal domain in a majority of plant POP-like
proteins is intriguing since it is likely to have a functional
implication for these proteins. Following a careful inspection of the amino acid residues in the vicinity of the active
site serine residue, we were able to unambiguously assign
a few POP-like proteins in the two plant species to different subfamilies of POP-like proteins as classified by
MEROPS[5].
These
include
At1g76140,
LOC_Os01g01830 (GGSNGGLL; S9A); At5g24260
(GWSYGGY; S9B); At2g47390, LOC_Os03g19410,
LOC_Os07g48970 (GGHSYGAFMT; S9D) (See additional file 7: Figure SF3.pdf). We identified 14 orthologous pairs of POP-like proteins across the two plant
species, suggesting high degree of conservation in the
function of POP-like proteins across the two species (See
additional file 4: Table S4.pdf). It also suggests that majority of these enzymes were present prior to dicot-monocot
divergence, consistent with the ancient evolutionary origin of these proteins. Phylogenetic analysis, however,
reveals presence of several gene clusters of Arabidopsis and
rice POP-like proteins that share low pairwise sequence
identity with each other and significant bootstrap values
(Figure 3).The largest of these clusters Clade I consists of
12 POP-like gene products from the two plant species that
are closely related and the pairwise percent sequence identity between any two sequences within the cluster ranges
from 60 to 96%. The second major cluster Clade II is more
varied in composition and consists of 10 sequences that
may further be grouped into two subclusters Clade IIA
and Clade IIB based or pairwise percent sequence identity
between any two sequences falling into the cluster. Clade
IIA includes four sequences (At1g20380, At1g76140,
LOC_Os01g01830 and LOC_Os04g47360) that are
between 72 and 89% identical with each other. Clade IIB
includes six sequences that share between 32 and 85%
pairwise sequence identity with each other. The members
of two subclusters share between 22 and 32% pairwise
sequence identity with each other. Clade IIA includes two

sequences (At1g76140, LOC_Os01g01830) identified as
members of the POP (S9A) subfamily of Prolyl oligopeptidase-like proteins (see above) suggesting that the
other members of this subcluster may possibly belong to
the S9A subfamily (Figure 3). No species-specific clusters
were identified in this family.
Serine carboxypeptidases (Family S10)
Serine carboxypeptidases catalyze the hydrolysis of the Cterminal bond in proteins and peptides. Crystal structures
show that serine carboxypeptidases belong to the Î±/Î²
hydrolase fold and possess a catalytic triad similar to
members of chymotrypsin and subtilisin families in the
order Ser, Asp and His (S257, D449, H508)[5].

Serine carboxypeptidase-like proteins (SCPLs) have been
identified in several plant species, where they form large
and diverse gene families in contrast with prokaryotes and
other eukaryotes. Plant SCPLs have been implicated in
several biochemical processes including secondary metabolism (See additional file 3: Table S3.pdf) and are
believed to be essential to plant growth and development[2,9-11], [41-43].
We identified 54 genes coding for serine-carboxypeptidase (SCP)-like proteins in Arabidopsis and 66 in rice. A
majority of these gene products are predicted to be secretory pathway proteins, though a number of rice SCP-like
proteins are either predicted to localise to mitochondria
and chloroplasts or lack a predictable signal sequence (See
additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The analysis of domain architectures of Arabidopsis and rice SCP-

like proteins reveals that nearly all gene products identified here are single domain proteins containing a single
protease
domain,
with
the
exception
of
LOC_Os01g22970 that carries a single zinc binding module (zf-CCHC; Pfam[37] accession: PF00098) N-terminal
to the protease domain and LOC_Os06g32740 that carries a conserved transposable element module
(Transposase_21; Pfam[37] accession: PF01359) C-terminal to the protease domain (Figure 2). This clearly indicates that the predicted serine carboxypeptidase domain is
usually sufficient for biological activity of the majority of
gene products identified in the two plant species. The lack
of diverse domain architecture suggests that spatial and
temporal regulation of gene expression patterns may play
a major role in regulating the activity of SCP-like proteins
in Arabidopsis and rice. We identified 17 orthologous pairs
across the two species suggesting, as in the case of subtilisin-like proteins, a majority of SCP-like proteins in Arabidopsis and rice probably arose due to extensive gene
duplication subsequent to dicot-monocot divergence and
that has contributed to their forming a large gene family
in the two species (Tables 2, 3; see additionals files 4, 8:
Table S4.pdf, Figure SF4.pdf). The presence of a large
number of SCP-like proteins in the two plant species suggests a possible functional redundancy, while on the other
hand it may indicate of functional diversification, where a
significant number of these proteins may have been
recruited for functions in plant secondary metabolism to
catalyze novel reactions (See additional file 3: Table
S3.pdf). SCP-like enzymes have been shown to function
as acyltransferases in several plant species including Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis

shown to function as acyltransferases in phenylpropanoid
metabolism[41,43]. Studies have shown that Arabidopsis
SMT is a heavily glycosylated protein that localises to central vacoules of the leaf tissue, suggesting that some SCPlike proteins identified in the two plant species may also
be vacoule localised[44].
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the majority of Arabidopsis and rice SCPL proteins cluster into two major
clades, but there are some additional SCPL proteins that
are less closely related to members of the clades (See additional file 8: Figure SF4.pdf). Clade I may further be subdivided into three subgroups, Clade IA (includes only
Arabidopsis SCPL proteins), Clade IB (includes only rice
SCPL proteins) and Clade IC (includes a pair of Arabidopsis and rice SCPL proteins). Clade IA includes known
SCPL acyltransferases such as SMT (At2g22990) and SCT
(At5g09640). Clade IA and IB consist exclusively of Arabidopsis and rice sequences respectively that have no identifiable orthologues in either subcluster. Therefore these
two subclades may represent early diversification of certain SCPL proteins followed by their lineage specific
delineation and expansion subsequent to speciation (See
additional file 8: Figure SF4.pdf).
Clade II, the larger of two major clades, consists of
sequences that share between 33 and 82% pairwise
sequence identity with each other. Earlier observations
have suggested that Clade II consists of more varied
sequences in terms of pairwise sequence identity, conservation of key residues and exon/intron splice positions[45]. In contrast to Clade I, Arabidopsis and rice
sequences falling into Clade II, are interspersed with each

other with the exception of a small number of rice
sequences that form an exclusive subcluster. The members
of the two clades mostly share between 20 and 30% pairwise sequence identity. However, of the three subclusters
identified among Clade I proteins, the members of Clade
IC appear to be closer to Clade II sequences than members
of Clade IA and Clade IB and share between 25 and 35%
pairwise sequence identity with the members of Clade II.
Serine beta-lactamases (Family S12)
Serine beta-lactamases are a group of hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of Î²-lactam
antibiotics such as penicillins. They were first identified in
penicillin-resistant bacterial isolates and have been found
to be widely distributed in eubacterial genomes. On the
basis of sequence similarity, they have been classified into
three classes A, C and D, where class B consists of metallobeta-lactamases. Class A (penicillinase type) proteins were
the first to be identified and are the most common betalactamases. All these proteins share sequence similarity
within the class but not with members of other classes.
However, proteins of different classes share significant
structural similarity and are believed to be homologues
that have undergone divergent evolution. Structure-based
phylogeny studies suggest that beta-lactamases are ancient
enzymes that probably evolved as means of protection
against beta-lactam antibiotics[46]. Site-directed mutagenesis and structural analyses have helped to unravel the
catalytic mechanism of Î²-lactamases and led to the identification of their active site residues (S93, K96,
Y190)[47,48].

Serine beta-lactamases are widespread in bacterial
genomes, and their corresponding genes may occur on

bacterial chromosomes or on plasmids. This allows for
their transfer to distant species and may account for their
distribution and diversity[48]. Serine beta-lactamase
homologues have been identified in eukaryotes, mainly as
a consequence of ongoing genome sequencing programs.
However, little function information is available about
these proteins in eukaryotes.
We have identified a single serine beta-lactamase like gene
product each in Arabidopsis and rice proteomes, both of
which are predicted to localise to mitochondria. An interesting feature is the presence of a single ABC1 domain
(Pfam[37] accession: PF03109) N-terminal to the serine
Î²-lactamase domain (Figure 2; see additional files 1, 2:
Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). ABC1 domains are associated
with a family of proteins that include members from yeast
and bacteria that display a nuclear or mitochondrial subcellular location in eukaryotes. Some members of the
family are believed to regulate mRNA translation and are
essential for electron transfer in the bc1 complex[37] (See
additional file 9: Figure SF5.pdf).
Clp ATP-dependent proteases (Family S14)
Clp proteases are a group of ATP-dependent serine
endopeptidases that belong to MEROPS[5] family S14.
E.coli ClpP is an ATP-dependent serine protease that consists of a smaller protease subunit ClpP, and a larger chaperone regulatory ATPase subunit (either ClpA or ClpX).
Though the protease domain is capable of proteolysis on
its own, the ATPase subunits are essential for effective levels of proteolysis. Structural analysis (See additional file 3:
Table S3.pdf) reveals that the catalytic triad residues SerHis-Asp (S111, H136, D185) are enclosed in a single cavity that allows for degradation of small peptides but precludes the entry of large folded polypeptides (See
additional file 3: Table S3.pdf)[6,7,49].

Clp proteases have been identified in bacteria and eukaryotes but appear to be absent from archaea. They have been
implicated in protein quality control and degradation of
misfolded nascent peptides[50]. Plant Clp proteases were
first identified with the discovery of the plastid-encoded
gene clpP1, orthologous to E.coli clpP and in most higher
plants it is transcribed by genes rps12 and rps120[6,7].
Though the exact function for Clp proteases remains to be
worked out, they appear to be essential for chloroplast
function and viability. Clp proteases are likely to play a
role in protein degradation in stroma and thylakoid membrane under particular stress conditions thereby ensuring
removal of aberrant polypeptides and recycling of the
nutrient pool[7,13]. They have also been implicated in
shoot development[51] suggesting a broad regulatory role
for Clp proteases in plants.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

We have identified nine different ClpP genes encoding the
proteolytic subunit of the Clp protease in the Arabidopsis
nuclear proteome and 13 in rice nuclear proteome. Eight
of the nine Arabidopsis ClpP-like proteins are predicted to
localise to chloroplast, while At5g23140 gene product is
predicted to be mitochondria localised, though experimental evidence suggests that At5g23140 gene product
appears to localise to both chloroplasts and mitochondria[52]. Likewise, in rice, 11 ClpP-like proteins are predicted
to
be
chloroplast
localised,
while
LOC_Os08g15270 gene product is predicted to localise to
mitochondria, while subcellular localization for
LOC_Os12g1059 could not be determined (See additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). We observed
that some ClpP gene products identified in the two species
have lost the catalytic protease site and therefore do not
appear to take part in proteolysis. However, they are
believed to play a significant role in proper assembly of
functional ClpP protein complex and potentially influence chaperone interaction (Figure 4). Interestingly, we
identified orthologues for all nine Arabidopsis ClpP gene
products in rice, suggesting high degree of evolutionary
conservation of Clp function in the two species (See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf). Recently, a 325-kDa complex
consisting of 10 Clp isoforms including the chloroplast
encoded pClpP and nuclear encoded Clp proteins was
identified in Arabidopsis chloroplasts and a 320-kDa
homotetradecameric complex consisting of only ClpP2
gene products was identified in mitochondria. These protein complexes are believed to be involved in degradation
of misfolded or unassembled peptides in an ATP-dependent manner[52]. High evolutionary conservation of ClpPlike proteins across the two species suggests that some rice
ClpP homologues may participate in the assembly of a
similar regulatory complex in rice chloroplasts and mitochondria.
Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice Clp-like proteins reveals the presence of several gene clusters (Clades
I-VIII) that share comparatively low pairwise sequence
identity with each other, as opposed to the members
within a cluster that share significant sequence similarity
with each other (Figure 5). We identified eight Clp-like
proteins from both Arabidopsis and rice that are likely to
have lost their catalytic protease activity due to mutations
of key residues in protease active site (Figure 4). Six of
these gene products (At1g09130, At1g49970, At4g17040
from
Arabidopsis
and
LOC_Os01g16530,
LOC_Os03g22430, LOC_Os05g51450 from rice) fall into
a single gene cluster (Clade I) and share between 36 and
72% pairwise sequence identity with each other (Figure
5). The above sequences have a 9â10 amino acid insert
(L1 inserts) that are believed to affect the presentation of
the substrate to the neighboring catalytic triads in ClpP
proteins and also known to contribute residues to puta-

tive lateral openings likely to stimulate or inhibit exit of
peptide fragments from the core[52] (Figure 4). The other
ClpP-like gene products identified in the two species
mostly cluster into independent gene clusters, Clades IIVIII (Figure 5). The sequences constituting the gene clusters share high pairwise sequence identity with each other,
but are between 25 and 45% identical to the rest of ClpPlike proteases identified across the two species.

Lon proteases (Family S16)
Lon proteases are also a group of ATP-dependent serine
proteases. Unlike the Clp proteases, the catalytic and
ATPase domains of the Lon proteases reside in the same
polypeptide. They are conserved in prokaryotes and
eukaryotic organelles such as chloroplast and mitochondria. E.coli Lon protease was the first ATP-dependent protease to be described and consists of three functional

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:200

domains: the N-terminal domain (LON), a central ATPase
domain (AAA+ module) and a C-terminal proteolytic
domain (Lon_C). The N-terminal LON domain along
with the AAA module is believed to impart substrate specificity to Lon proteases[6,53]. Structure and sequence
analysis along with site-directed mutagenesis indicate that
Lon proteases employ a Ser-Lys (S679, K/R722) catalytic
dyad instead of a canonical serine protease catalytic
triad[53]. Based on the conservation of residues around
the catalytic residues, the Lon proteases have recently
been proposed to be divided into two subfamilies: LonA
and LonB[53].
Unlike Clp proteases, Lon proteases appear to be present
in organisms from all forms of life. They are believed to
play a significant role in removal of aberrant proteins and
thereby maintain cellular stability. Interestingly, an
archaeal membrane bound Lon protease was found to
have both ATP-dependent and ATP-independent proteolytic activities towards folded and unfolded proteins
respectively[54]. Little is known of their function in
plants, but Lon1 from Arabidopsis has been implicated in
the control of cytoplasmic male sterility[55].
We have identified four protein sequences containing the
Lon proteolytic domain in Arabidopsis and an equal
number in rice. In addition, we also identified five protein
sequences containing only the Lon N-terminal domain in
Arabidopsis and four in rice (data not shown). Of the Arabidopsis Lon protease-like proteins, At3g05790 and
At5g26860 gene products are predicted to localise to chloroplast, while At3g05780 and At5g47040 gene products
are predicted to be mitochondria localised. All four Lon
protease-like proteins identified in rice are predicted to
localise to chloroplasts. The Lon-protease like proteins
identified in the two plant species share higher similarities
with the LonA subfamily (See additional file 10: Figure
SF6.pdf). The presence of LON-only sequences has been
known in several prokaryotic species and its presence in
Arabidopsis and rice proteomes suggests that LON domain
may have been recruited as a general module for regulating protein-protein interactions, particularly for targeted
protein degradation[56].
Sequence analysis reveals that Arabidopsis and rice Lon
protease like sequences fall into two clusters on the basis
of pairwise sequence identity (data not shown). The largest of these clusters consists of five sequences (At3g05790,
At5g26860,
At3g05780,
LOC_Os03g19350,
LOC_Os07g48960), all of which, except At3g05780 are
predicted to localise to chloroplasts and share between 76
and 91% pairwise sequence identity with each other. The
second cluster consists of two sequences (At5g47040 and
LOC_Os09g36300) that are 82% identical to each other
but predicted to have different subcellular localizations.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

At5g47040 is predicted to localise to mitochondria and
LOC_Os09g36300 is predicted to localise to chloroplasts.
The members of the two clusters display between 40 and
45% pairwise sequence identity with each other. A Lon
protease like gene product from rice, LOC_Os06g05820,
is less closely related and shares between 19 and 25% pairwise sequence identity with the rest of the Lon protease
like gene products from the two species.
Signal peptidases (Family S26)
Signal peptidases (SPases or leader peptidases) are a
diverse group of serine endopeptidases, that belong to
MEROPS[5] family S26 and are responsible for the
removal of signal peptides from preproteins within the
cell[57]. Signal peptides comprise the N-terminal part of
the polypeptide chain. They are essential for targeting various proteins to their correct destination and are cleaved
off subsequent to the transfer of the protein across the
membrane. The failure to remove signal peptides often
leads to protein inactivation and/or mislocalisation[57].

The Type I SPases are membrane-bound serine endopeptidases that were first identified in bacteria (E.coli lepB) and
homologues have subsequently been identified in
archaea, mitochondrial inner membrane, the thylakoid
membrane of chloroplasts and the endoplasmic reticulum membranes of yeast and higher eukaryotes[57,58].
The Type I SPase family is further divided into two subfamilies: members of S26A subfamily employ a serinelysine dyad for catalysis (S91, K146) and include prokaryotic, chloroplast and mitochondrial peptidases, while the
members of S26B subfamily that include ER SPC and
archaeal peptidases, employ a serine-histidine dyad (S44,
H83) based on the mechanism for catalysis[57,58].
In bacteria, Type I SPases appear to be essential for cell viability and their inactivation invariably leads to cell death.
Therefore they have been attractive targets for antibacterial drugs[57,58]. In higher plants, homologues of Type I
SPases, known as thylakoidal processing peptidases have
been identified and are involved in processing of protein
presequences required for integration into or translocation across thylakoid membranes. TPP, an Arabidopsis
homologue of E.coli LepB is a thylakoid membrane protein with its active site situated at the lumenal side[59,60].
An Arabidopsis plastidic SPase I (Plsp1, At24590) has been
found to be required for complete maturation of the plastid protein translocation channel Toc75. It is proposed
that Plsp1 may have multiple functions and is believed to
be essential for biogenesis of plastid internal membranes[61].
We have identified nine genes coding for signal peptidaselike proteins in Arabidopsis and seven in rice. A majority of
these gene products are predicted to localise to mitochon-

Multiple sequence alignment of the Type I Spase domain region of the annotated Arabidopsis and rice Type I Spase-like proteins.
The catalytic dyad residues are indicated. Gene names correspond to those in Additional files 1 and 2. For brevity, rice gene
names have been shortened to OsXXg##### instead of LOC_OsXXg#####, XX referring to chromosome 1â12 and a 5
digit number assigned to each gene. The variations in the second residue (K/H) of catalytic dyad can be identified here (see text
for details).
dria, though some are predicted to be chloroplast localised, membrane bound and even secreted (See additional
files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). Arabidopsis TPP
(At2g30440), though predicted by TargetP[19] to be
mitochondria localised, has been experimentally determined to be associated with chloroplast fraction. The
enzyme when overexpressed in vitro, was found to possess catalytic activity against the lumenal targeting presequence of the 23-kDa component of photosystem II[59],
suggesting a possible role for TPP and similar proteins in
processing of polypeptides during their transport through
cellular membranes. Most of the gene products analysed
here possess Ser and Lys as active site residues and are
likely to employ a serine-lysine catalytic dyad for proteolysis. Some gene products (At1g52600, At3g15710,
LOC_Os05g23260,
LOC_Os06g16260,
LOC_Os02g58140) appear to possess Ser and His as
active site residues and consequently may employ a serine-histidine catalytic dyad for proteolysis (Figure 6). We
identified five orthologous pairs of signal peptidase-like
proteins across the two species, suggesting conservation of

signal-peptidase function in the two species (See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf).
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Arabidopsis and rice
Type I SPase-like proteins cluster into two major clades
supported by high bootstrap values and high pairwise
sequence identity (See additional file 11: Figure SF7.pdf).
Clade I consists of 5 sequences (At1g06870, At2g30440,
At3g24590, LOC_Os09g28000, LOC_Os03g55640) that
are between 67 and 86% identical to each other. Clade II
consists of 5 sequences (At1g52600, At3g15710,
LOC_Os05g23260,
LOC_Os06g16260,
LOC_Os02g58140), that share between 67 and 96% pairwise sequence identity with each other. The members of
either cluster share low sequence identity with the rest of
the gene products. Interestingly, all the members of clade
II carry histidine as an active site residue instead of Lysine
and consequently are believed to employ a Ser-His dyad
for proteolysis and possibly correspond to S26B subfamily of Type I Spases (Figure 6; see above; see additional
file 11: Figure SF7.pdf). The remaining sequences carry

lysine as an active site residue and are consequently
believed to employ a Ser-Lys dyad for proteolysis likely to
correspond to S26A subfamily of Type I Spases (Figure 6;
see above; see additional file 11: Figure SF7.pdf). Clade I
sequences share between 8 and 10% pairwise sequence
identity with members of Clade II but share between 21
and 43% pairwise sequence identity with the remaining
Type I SPase-like gene products. Clade II members appear
to be less closely related and share between 8 and 15%
pairwise sequence identity with the rest of Type I SPaselike gene products. Taken together these observations suggest that functional clusters of Type I SPases employing
slightly varied catalytic mechanism were established early
during evolution and were subsequently retained, possibly for adaptation to different physiological processes.
Lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase family (Family S28)
This family includes several eukaryotic enzymes such as
lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (PCP), dipeptidylpeptidase II and thymus specific serine peptidase and is
grouped in MEROPS[5] clan SC along with MEROPS[5]
peptidase families such as S9, S10, S15 and S33. The predicted active site residues for the members of this family
(S179, D430, H455) occur in the same order in the
sequence as that of family S10.

Members of this family have been identified exclusively in
eukaryotes and have been implicated in several processes
(See additional file 3: Table S3.pdf)[4,62,63]. No functional information is available regarding their role in
plants.
Analysis of the Arabidopsis proteome revealed the presence
of seven genes encoding for the members of S28 family,
while five genes were identified in rice. Of these, a majority are predicted to be the members of the secretory pathway, while two rice gene products LOC_Os01g56150 and
LOC_Os10g36780 are predicted to be mitochondria
localised (See additional files 1, 2, 12: Table S1.pdf, Table
S2.pdf, Figure SF8.pdf). We further identified three orthologous pairs across the two species. S28 protease-like proteins identified here, like their eukaryotic counterparts are
believed to be involved in processing of penultimate Proline containing polypeptides in the two plant species (See
additional file 4: Table S4.pdf).
Phyolgenetic analysis reveals that Arabidopsis and rice proteins belonging to S28 family cluster into two clades (Figure 7). Clade I appears to be more diverse of the two
clades and consists of six sequences that share between 40
and 69% pairwise sequence identities among themselves.
Clade II consists of five sequences that are more closely
related to each other than Clade I sequences and between
61 and 92% identical. The members of the two clusters
share between 19 and 26% pairwise sequence identity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

with each other. These observations suggest the presence
of two evolutionary clades among Arabidopsis and rice
S28-like proteins prior to speciation.
C-terminal processing peptidases (Family S41)
C-terminal processing peptidases (Ctps) belong to
MEROPS[5] family S41. E.coli Tsp, a periplasmic endoprotease, was one of the first members of the family to be
identified (See additional file 3: Table S3.pdf). It was subsequently determined that Most family members are associated with PDZ domains that are protein-protein
interaction modules and are important for substrate recognition[24]. The C-terminal processing peptidase family
consists of two subfamilies, which differ greatly in activity,
sensitivity to inhibitors and molecular structure[5]. The
two subfamilies employ different mechanisms for catalysis. While, the C-terminal processing peptidase subfamily
(S41A) is found chiefly in bacteria and some eukaryotes
employing a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad (S452, K477), the tricon core protease subfamily (S41B) is largely confined to
archaea with few bacterial representatives employing a
catalytic tetrad consisting of Ser, His, Ser and Glu residues
(S745, H746, S965, E1023).

In bacteria, CPPs (such as E. coli Tsp) are believed to play
an important role in degradation of improperly synthesised proteins. For instance, proteins translated from damaged mRNA are modified by addition of a C-terminal tag,
which enables their recognition and degradation by
CPPs[64]. In plants, Ctps have been implicated in processing D1 protein of photosystem II, which is essential for
correct assembly and functioning of the plant photosynthetic apparatus[60,65,66].
We identified three genes each coding for Ctp-like proteins in Arabidopsis and rice proteomes. While the Arabidopsis proteins are all predicted to be soluble and have
been shown to be translocated into thylakoid lumen, two
of the three rice gene products (LOC_Os01g47450 and
LOC_Os02g57060) are predicted to be mitochondria
localised, while a single gene product LOC_Os06g21380
is predicted to be translocated to chloroplasts (See additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). All Ctp-like
proteins identified in the two plant species carry a PDZ
domain N-terminal to the protease domain (Figure 2; see
additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). PDZ
domains are protein-protein interaction modules that are
likely to mediate substrate recognition for plant Ctp-like
proteins[24]. Sequence analysis suggests that the Ctp-like
proteins identified here may employ a serine-lysine catalytic dyad for proteolysis and possibly belong to S41A
subfamily of C-terminal processing peptidases (See additional file 13: Figure SF9.pdf). We identified three orthologous
pairs

At5g46390:LOC_Os01g47450) of six Ctp-like proteins
across the two plant species (See additional file 4: Table
S4.pdf). Each gene product displays a higher sequence
identity with its orthologue in the corresponding genome
than similar gene products from the same species. This
suggests that these groups were most likely established
early in evolution and disseminated in the two plant species through speciation. Like prokaryotic Ctps, plant Ctplike proteins are believed to play a role in degradation of
incorrectly synthesised proteins in chloroplasts and mitochondria.
SppA/protease IV family (Family S49)
These groups of serine peptidases belong to MEROPS[5]
family S49 and were first identified on the basis of their
ability to degrade signal peptides that accumulate in the
cytosol subsequent to their removal from precursor
polypeptides by signal peptidases. Signal peptides are
responsible for targeting various proteins to their correct
subcellular localizations and are subsequently removed
from the preproteins. The signal peptides generated following this cleavage need to be rapidly degraded since
they may be harmful to cells by interfering with protein
translocation or may accumulate in the membrane leading to cell lysis. E.coli SppA (protease IV), an inner membrane protein was the first protein identified with signal
peptide peptidase activity (See additional file 3: Table
S3.pdf)[57,67]. The predicted active site serine residue for
members of Protease IV family and Clp protease family
occur in the same order in the sequence: S, R/H, D and
forms the basis for their assignment to SK clan[5].

Members of the protease IV family have been identified in
viruses, archaea and bacteria and among the higher
eukaryotes; they have been identified only in plants. Two
proteins, SppA1 and SppA2 have been identified in Synechosystis while a single homologue SppA has been identified in Arabidopsis that lacks the putative transmembrane
spanning segments predicted from the E.coli
sequence[68].
Protease IV family appears to be represented by single
members in Arabidopsis and rice proteomes and are not
represented in any other eukaryotes. Though predicted by
TargetP[19] to be mitochondria localised, experimental
evidence indicates that Arabidopsis SppA (At1g73390) is a
light-inducible membrane-bound protein with an unusual monotropic arrangement, associated with thylakoid
membranes and has been proposed to be involved in light
dependent degradation of photosystem II and LHCII
antenna proteins[68]. A single SppA homologue in rice
(LOC_Os2g49570) is also predicted to be mitochondria
localised and in absence of experimental evidence, it
would be tempting to speculate that the rice protein may
also localise to chloroplasts. At1g73390 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

LOC_Os02g49570 each carry two protease IV domains
(Figure 2; see additional files 1, 2, 14: Table S1.pdf, Table
S2.pdf, Figure SF10.pdf). Interestingly the N-terminal protease IV domain of At1g73390 is 63% identical to the Cterminal protease IV domain of the rice counterpart
LOC_Os02g49570, while sharing only 17% identity with
At1g73390 C-terminal protease IV domain and 14% identity with LOC_Os02g49570 N-terminal protease IV
domain. Likewise LOC_Os02g49570 N-terminal protease
IV domain is 75% identical to At1g73390 C-terminal protease IV domain and only 18% identical to
LOC_Os02g49570 C-terminal protease IV domain. This
clearly suggests that independent gene shuffling events
subsequent to acquisition of SppA homologues in the two
plant species may be responsible for the current domain
architecture. Similar to their prokaryotic counterparts,
they may function in association with signal-peptidases to
degrade leader peptides removed from precursor proteins
similar to their prokaryotic counterparts.
Rhomboids (Family S54)
Rhomboid proteins are a family of serine proteases that
cleave substrates within transmembrane domains[69,70].
Rhomboids are one of the most widespread membrane
protein families and are found in archaea, bacteria and
eukaryotes including plants[70,71] suggesting that while
their signaling mechanism particularly protease activity
may be conserved across lineages, they may have additional roles (See additional file 3: Table S3.pdf). A proposed catalytic triad comprising Asn169, Ser217 and
His281 has been identified using site directed mutagenesis and each of proposed active site residues is located
within a transmembrane domain[72]. However, a recent
report suggests that while Ser217 and His281 along with
a glycine residue (two residues N-terminal to Ser217) are
essential for catalysis, Asn169 is not required for catalytic
activity and that rhomboids likely function as endopeptidases with a serine-histidine dyad[73].

Rhomboid like proteins have been identified in plants,
however, there was no experimental information available about them till recently. A rhomboid homologue from
Arabidopsis AtRBL2 was recently isolated and shown to
have proteolytic activity and substrate specificity[74].
AtRBL2 was shown to cleave Drosophila ligands Spitz and
Keren but not similar proteins like TGFÎ±, when expressed
in mammalian cells, thereby releasing soluble ligands
from the cell into the media. AtRBL2 along with AtRBL1,
another Arabidopsis rhomboid homologue was found to
localise to Golgi apparatus in plant cells consistent with
previous observations where several eukaryotic rhomboid
proteins have been predicted to localise within Golgi
apparatus[72,74]. Interestingly, plants appear to lack any
component of the EGF signaling pathway other than
rhomboid and it has been suggested that rhomboid-like

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:200

proteins in plants may be involved in processing as yet
uncharacterised substrates that may be conserved in other
organisms as well[74].
We identified 20 genes coding for rhomboid-like proteins
in Arabidopsis and 18 in rice. Subsequent to multiple
sequence alignment, it became evident that several proteins appeared to be catalytically inactive, owing to loss or
mutation(s) in residues believed to be essential for catalysis. While the role of these catalytically compromised proteins remains unclear, it is believed that they may function
as regulators of active rhomboid proteases[71] (See additional files 1, 2, 15: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf, Figure
SF11.pdf). Of all the rhomboid-like proteins identified in
the two plant species, only a few are likely to carry additional domains. Three Arabidopsis gene products
(At2g41160, At3g56740, At3g58460) and two gene products from rice (LOC_Os01g16330, LOC_Os03g44830)
are predicted to possess a ubiquitin associated (UBA)
domain, C-terminal to the rhomboid protease domain.
An Arabidopsis gene product At3g17611 is predicted to
have a zinc finger-like module C-terminal to the predicted
rhomboid protease domain (Figure 2; see additional files
1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). We identified 10 orthologous pairs across Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting a high
degree of conservation of rhomboid mechanisms across
the two plant species (See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf).
TargetP[19] predictions suggest that a few rhomboid-like
proteins from both the plant species may localise to mitochondria or chloroplasts (See additional files 1, 2: Table
S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). Recently, a rhomboid protease was
identified in yeast mitochondria, where it is involved in
processing of substrates localised to the mitochondrial
intermembrane space[75]. Although rhomboid-like proteins are yet to be identified in chloroplasts, identification
of a yeast mitochondrial rhomboid protease coupled with
the possibility that a few rhomboid-like proteins in the
two plant species may localise to mitochondria and/or
chloroplasts suggests that rhomboid-like proteins may be
involved in regulatory processes in mitochondria and
chloroplasts of higher plants.
Phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and rice rhomboidlike proteins reveals presence of several gene clusters that
share low pairwise sequence identity with each other,
though the members within a cluster share significant
sequence similarity with each other (Figure 8). Clade I is
the largest of the clusters supported by high bootstrap values and consists of 15 sequences, most of which, carry
seven transmembrane helices (TMHs) and share greater
than 40% pairwise sequence identity with each other.
Three sequences in Clade I: At1g77860, At1g25290 and
At5g07250 have been previously designated as members
of RHO subfamily, one of the two major rhomboid subfamilies. The members of RHO subfamily typically have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

an extra TMH C-terminal to the 6-TMH core typical of
most rhomboid-like proteins[71]. Since a majority of
sequences that cluster into Clade I carry seven TMHs (data
not shown), it is likely that they correspond to the RHO
subfamily of rhomboid-like proteins. Clade II is the second largest cluster supported by significant bootstrap values and consists of five sequences (At2g39060,
At3g07950, LOC_Os03g24390, LOC_Os04g01300 and
LOC_Os07g46170). Arabidopsis genome encodes for four
gene products (see below in bold) that were earlier identified as members of the PARL subfamily, the other major
subfamily of rhomboid-like proteins[71]. The four gene
products cluster into four independent groups, Clade III,
consisting of four (At1g18600, At1g74130, At1g74140
and LOC_Os01g55740; 29â56% pairwise sequence identity), Clade IV, consisting of two (At3g58460,
LOC_Os03g44830; 72% identical), Clade V, consisting of
two (At3g17611, LOC_Os01g18100; 66% identical) and
Clade
VI
consisting
of
two
(At3g59520,
LOC_0s01g67040; 80% identical) sequences respectively
(Figure 8). A majority of rhomboid-like proteins identified in the two plant species were found to be single
domain proteins, containing a single rhomboid protease
domain. However, three Arabidopsis gene products
(At2g41160, At3g56740 and At3g58460) were found to
carry an additional UBA domain and At3g17611 was
found to carry a zf-RAN domain C-terminal to the rhomboid protease domain (Figure 2; see additional file 1:
Table S1.pdf). Two gene products in the rice genome,
LOC_Os03g44830 and LOC_Os01g16330 were found to
carry a UBA-domain C-terminal to the rhomboid protease
domain (Figure 2; see additional file 2: Table S2.pdf).
Interestingly, the UBA domain containing rhomboid-like
proteins were observed to fall into two clusters Clade IV
(At3g58460 and LOC_Os03g44830) and Clade VII
(At2g41160, At3g56740 and LOC_Os01g16330; 69â85%
pairwise sequence identity), suggesting that the rhomboid-UBA domain architecture probably evolved early in
evolution, prior to divergence of dicot and monocot lineages in higher plants.
The members of individual gene clusters (except Clade II)
share high pairwise sequence identities with each other
(see above) but share low sequence identity with other
rhomboid-like proteins identified in the two plant
genomes and are likely to have diverged early in evolution. Our results may in part be explained by previous
observations by Koonin and coworkers that reveal a
polyphyletic origin for eukaryotic rhomboids and the possibility of a bacterial origin for rhomboid-like proteins
and their subsequent dissemination in other lineages
through multiple horizontal gene transfer events followed
by extensive gene duplication[71].

Nucleoporin autopeptidases (Family S59)
Nucleoporin autopeptidases are a group of autocatalytic
serine endopeptidases belonging to MEROPS[5] family
S59. Most nucleoporins are synthesised as precursors and
processed by autoproteolysis prior to their association in
the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). Studies have indicated
that the C-terminal domain of the nucleoporins is essential for their localization to the NPC. Mutations that block
proteolytic processing within the C-terminal domain prevent their association with the pore and inhibit their ability to form NPCs[76,77]. Structural analysis of the
proteolytic cleavage site confirms the presence of a catalytic dyad (H879, S881) within HisPheSer motif and an
intein-like mechanism for autoproteolysis (See additional
file 3: Table S3.pdf)[77].

Members of the S59 family have been identified across
eukaryotes, from yeast to humans. Recently, a protein

MOS3 with high sequence similarity to human nucleoporin 96 has been identified in Arabidopsis and shown to be
required for activation of disease resistance response
against bacterial pathogens. It was experimentally shown
to localise to the nuclear envelope, suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking may play a significant role in
plant disease resistance[78].
Analysis of Arabidopsis and rice proteomes led to identification of three genes each coding for nucleoporin-like
proteins (See additional files 1, 2, 16: Table S1.pdf, Table
S2.pdf, Figure SF12.pdf). As mentioned earlier, MOS3
(At1g80680), a likely homologue of human nucleoporin
96, plays a significant role in Arabidopsis resistance to bacterial pathogen[78]. We identified a MOS3 orthologue in
rice, LOC_Os03g07580, which is of similar size and may
play a similar role in defense response to bacterial pathogens in rice (See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf). In addi-

tion, Arabidopsis proteome also contains two gene
products At1g10390 and At1g59660 that are 76% identical and show high similarity to human Nup98. In
humans, Nup96 and Nup98, are encoded by the same
gene and synthesised as a part of the same precursor
polypeptide while, in Arabidopsis, they are encoded at different chromosomal locations. Rice proteome contains
two
gene
products
LOC_Os12g06870
and
LOC_Os12g06890 that are 95% identical and are very
similar to At1g10390 and may be involved in similar
functional pathways in rice.
Domain architectures
A protein domain maybe defined as an independent evolutionary unit that may either occur on its own in a single
domain protein or alongside other similar units in a
multi-domain protein. A domain may have an independent function or may contribute to the function of a multidomain protein in cooperation with other domains.
Some of the major mechanisms that lead to multi-domain
proteins and novel combinations are domain shuffling
and gene fusion[79,80].

The serine protease-like proteins belonging to different
families identified in the two plant species exhibit 31 different domain architectures (Figure 2; see additional files
1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The different serine protease-like proteins display a preference for co-existing
domain(s), when present in multi-domain polypeptides,
where the co-existing domains are believed to either facilitate protein-protein interactions or help evolve newer
and more diverse functions for serine protease-like proteins in the cellular networks. We observed that a majority
of serine protease-like proteins belonging to a specific
family exhibit the same domain architectures with a few
members exhibiting different domain architectures (Figure 2; see additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf).
We identified some gene products that contain serine protease-like domains and exhibit novel domain architectures specific to either of the two plant species. The
information on co-existing domains described below was
obtained from Pfam[37] (See Figure 2 for Pfam[37] accessions).
1. LOC_Os01g17160 (Subtilisin family S8)- Domain
architecture SN-S8-PA-zfCCHC (Figure 2; see additional
file 2: Table S2.pdf). The putative gene product is associated with a Zinc knuckle motif C -terminal to the subtilisin protease domain, which is associated with
nucleocaspid protein of some retroviruses such as HIV. It
is required for viral genome packaging and is also found
in eukaryotic proteins involved in RNA binding or single
stranded DNA binding.

2. LOC_Os04g02960 (Subtilisin family S8)- Domain
architecture Ex2-S8-zfCCHC-rve (Figure 2; see additional
file 2: Table S2.pdf). The putative gene product carries an
Extensin_2 domain N-terminal to the subtilisin protease
domain. This domain is associated with a family of plant
hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) found in
plant extracellular matrix that play a major role in cell wall
self-assembly and cell extension. The gene product also
contains a zhCCHC domain and an RVE domain C-terminal to the protease domain. The RVE (integrase core)
domain is associated with viral proteins that mediate the
integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the
host chromosome.
3. LOC_Os06g06800 (Subtilisin family S8)- Domain
architecture S8-zfCCHC-rve. The putative gene product
carries a zhCCHC domain and an rve domain C-terminal
to the protease domain (Figure 2; see additional file 2:
Table S2.pdf).
4. LOC_Os06g40700 (Subtilisin family S8)- Domain
architecture SN-S8-PA-Arf2-C2. The putative gene product
carries an Arf2 and a C2 domain C-terminal to the subtilisin protease domain (Figure 2; see additional file 2: Table
S2.pdf). Arf2 domain is associated with members ADPribosylation factor family that includes small GTP-binding proteins that are major regulators of vesicle biogenesis
in intracellular traffic. C2 domain is a calcium-dependent
membrane-targeting module found in many cellular proteins associated with signal transduction or membrane
trafficking.
5. LOC_Os06g32740 (serine carboxypeptidase family
S10)- Domain architecture S10-Transposase_21 (Figure 2;
see additional file 2: Table S2.pdf). The putative gene
product is associated with Transposase_21 domain C-terminal to the serine carboxpeptidase domain. The TP21
domain is associated with a group of proteins that include
a transposable element.
6. LOC_Os11g27170 (serine carboxypeptidase family
S10)- Domain architecture S10-Retrotrans_gag (Figure 2;
see additional file 2: Table S2.pdf). The putative gene
product is associated with a Retrotrans_gag domain C-terminal to the serine carboxypeptidase protease domain.
The Retrotrans_gag domain is associated with groups of
proteins that include eukaryotic Gag or capsid-related retrotranposon-related proteins.
7. At5g24810, LOC_Os06g48770 (serine Î²-lactamse family S12)- Domain architecture ABC1-S12. The putative
gene products are associated with an ABC1 domain N-terminal to the serine Î²-lactamase domain (Figure 2; see
additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). ABC1
domains are associated with a family of proteins that

Page 23 of 31

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:200

include members from yeast and bacteria that display a
nuclear or mitochondrial subcellular location in eukaryotes. Some members of the family are believed to regulate
mRNA translation and are essential for electron transfer in
the bc1 complex.
8.
At2g41160,
At3g56740,
At3g58460,
LOC_Os01g16330, LOC_Os03g44830 (rhomboid family
S54)- Domain architecture S54-UBA. The putative gene
products are associated with an UBA domain C-terminal
to the rhomboid protease domain (Figure 2; see additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). UBA-domain
is a novel sequence motif found in diverse proteins associated with ubiquitin and the ubiquitination pathway.
9. At3g17611 (rhomboid family S54)- Domain architecture S54-zfRanBP. The putative gene product is associated
with a zf-RanBP domain C-terminal to the rhomboid protease domain (Figure 2; see additional files 1, 2: Table
S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). The zf-RanBP domain is associated
with a group of proteins that include Ran binding proteins
that play a role in transport between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm.
The gene products above, unlike other members of their
respective serine protease families, are associated with
domains forming novel domain combinations. It is likely
that the protease domains may be responsible for regulating the activities of the associated domains for some of the
gene products.
Orthologue sequence analysis and gene duplications
Orthologues are genes in different organisms that have
evolved from a common ancestor gene by speciation.
They normally retain the same function in the course of
evolution and the identification of orthologues is important for reliable prediction of gene functions and for comparing genome organizations[81]. Nearly 40% of genes
encoding for serine protease-like proteins in the two plant
species were identified as orthologues, suggesting that serine protease functions may have been established prior to
dicot-monocot divergence (See additional file 4: Table
S4.pdf). Comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana serine protease-like genes of known functions with similar gene
products encoded in the rice genome has enabled the
identification of rice serine-protease like gene products
likely to be involved in similar physiological processes in
rice (See additional file 4: Table S4.pdf).

When comparing multi-gene families between species it is
frequently observed that several genes in one species may
collectively be orthologues of a single gene in the other,
indicating recent duplications exclusive to the former. In
such cases, knowledge of gene function of certain members allows confirmation of orthologous and paralogous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

relationships. One such instance is Arabidopsis AIR3
(At2g04160), which has been associated with lateral root
emergence[12] and has a putative orthologue
(LOC_Os02g10520) in rice (See additional file 4: Table
S4.pdf). However, AIR3 also appears to be an orthologue
of LOC_Os06g40700, which is most closely related to
LOC_Os02g10520 and LOC_Os08g23740, which is also
closely related to LOC_Os02g10520 in terms of sequence
similarity. Therefore, the aforementioned rice genes represent paralogous genes resulting from recent duplication
events and it would be interesting to investigate whether
they are also associated with lateral root emergence like
their Arabidopsis counterpart and whether they display
redundancy in function. Similarly, Arabidopsis ARA12 [12]
(At5g67360)
has
a
putative
orthologue
LOC_Os03g55350 in rice (See additional file 4: Table
S4.pdf) and is likely to be associated with cell wall metabolism. ARA12 also appears to be an orthologue of
LOC_Os03g40830 which, is a likely paralogue of
LOC_Os03g55350 (Table 3), suggesting a recent duplication event in rice genome with respect to At5g67360
(ARA12) in Arabidopsis.
Gene duplication, resulting from regional events or
genome-wide polyploidization is a significant aspect of
plant genome evolution. It is generally believed that
extensive gene duplication is responsible for functional
divergence, increased genomic and phenotypic complexity and may constitute a major factor in speciation. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie gene duplication
is vital since these provide greater insights into genomewide aspects of evolutionary processes that shape genome
organizations, evolutionary relationships and interactions[82,83]. Comparison of plant serine proteases with
those of other major eukaryotic lineages reveals identification of plant specific serine proteases and selective expansion of serine protease families in plants (data not
shown). In order to explore possible functional redundancy in plant serine protease-like proteins, we investigated chromosomal locations of serine protease-like
proteins from the two plant species and inferred probable
gene duplication events that may have facilitated this distribution. We observed that plant serine protease-like proteins are distributed on nearly on all the chromosomes in
the two plant species. Several serine protease-like proteins
in the two plant species were found to occur in tandem
repeats, suggesting that local duplication events may have
contributed to expansion of these gene families (See additional files 1, 2: Table S1.pdf, Table S2.pdf). It was also
noted that several sequences identified as probable most
recent gene duplicates in the two plant species were
located on different chromosomes (Tables 2, 3). In order
to analyse the role of segmental duplications in generating
these gene duplicates, we compared our results on most
recent gene duplicates with the TIGR[20] dataset of genes

Page 24 of 31

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:200

found within segmentally duplicated regions of the Arabidopsis and rice genomes and were able to identify
instances of segmentally duplicated genes corresponding
to certain families of serine proteases in Arabidopsis and
rice genomes (Tables 2, 3). Therefore, some of the
observed most recent gene duplications on different chromosomes in Arabidopsis and rice genomes may be attributed to segmental duplications. It seems likely that the
expansion of certain serine protease families in the two
plant species may be a consequence of extensive segmental and tandem gene duplication events subsequent to
speciation (Tables 2, 3). Our analysis appears to be consistent with recent observations that segmental and tandem gene duplication events may have led to selective
expansion of several gene families in Arabidopsis and rice
genomes[84,85]. It has been suggested that, in general,
duplicated genes have a tendency to acquire newer and
more distinct functions. This is possible mainly due to differential sequence evolution and divergent expression
patterns thereby adding to the complexity of cellular networks[15,84-87].

Conclusion
The current analysis provides an overview and a comparison of serine protease families of Arabidopsis and rice, the
two plant species with completely sequenced genomes
that constitute model plant systems for dicots and monocots, respectively. The genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and
rice encode very similar number of serine protease-like
gene products despite large differences in gene size and
gene content. Similar results have been obtained from
comparison of other gene families such as ABC transporters and P-ATPases though unlike serine proteases, a differential distribution of families and subfamilies has been
observed in the above two cases. Nearly 40% of genes
encoding for serine protease-like proteins in the two plant
species were identified as orthologues, suggesting that
some essential plant serine protease functions may have
been established prior to dicot-monocot divergence. This
is further supported by our observation that almost all the
phylogenetic clades corresponding to different serine protease families taken up for study in this analysis include
both Arabidopsis and rice gene products indicating that
divergence of these clades occurred prior to the divergence
of two species. However, several clades display an unequal
representation of gene products from the two species indicating that a significant number of serine protease genes
in the two plant species may have evolved by gene duplication events subsequent to speciation. In addition, plants
appear to share with prokaryotes, some specific sets of serine protease-like proteins, not identified in other eukaryotes, which may have originated from ancestral
chloroplast genomes and may be indicative of ancient
endosymbiotic events leading to evolution of chloroplasts. Comparison of Arabidopsis thaliana serine protease-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

like proteins of known functions with similar gene products encoded in the rice genome has enabled the identification of rice serine-protease like proteins likely to be
involved in similar physiological processes associated
with growth and development in rice. In addition, identification of serine protease-like proteins in either plant species with no apparent counterpart in the other species
indicates the existence of Arabidopsis and rice specific serine protease-like proteins and by extension, dicot- and
monocot-specific serine protease-like proteins. The systematic analysis of the serine protease-like proteins in the
two plant species has provided some insight into the functional associations of previously uncharacterised serine
protease-like proteins. Further investigation of these
aspects may help unravel more specific functional roles
for several serine protease-like proteins in various cellular
and physiological processes in Arabidopsis and rice and
may prove beneficial in our understanding of similar
processes in commercially significant crop plant species.

Methods
Sequences encoded by the complete Arabidopsis and rice
(Oryza sativa L.ssp. japonica) proteomes were obtained
from The Institute for Genomic research (TIGR[20]).
Search for serine proteases in the two plant genomes
a. A preliminary search for serine-proteases was performed using BLASTP[88] on Arabidopsis and rice proteomes, using Type sequences for each serine-protease
family as classified by MEROPS[5] as queries. MEROPS[5]
employs a hierarchical structure based classification of
proteins and groups the peptidases together on the basis
of statistical similarities in amino acid sequence and tertiary structure. Each family has a type example around
which the family is built. All the members from the resulting list of similar sequences were retrieved for another
round of searching and new accession numbers added to
the original list of sequences. The procedure was repeated
for five iterations with an E-value threshold of 10-3.

b. The protein sequences thus obtained were scanned further against a dataset of hidden Markov models (HMMs)
obtained from the Pfam A database[37], employing the
Hmmsearch of the HMMER suite[16], with the E-value
thresholds set to 0.1[89].
c. A complimentary approach of matching sequences to a
database of annotated profiles was also employed. Each
Arabidopsis and rice genome sequence was matched to sensitive protein family profiles obtained from the PfamA
database[37], using IMPALA[17]. A sequence aligning
with any of the serine-protease domains considered for
study with an E-value of <10-5 by IMPALA[17] was considered as a potential member of that family.

d. A similar approach was carried out where each of Arabidopsis and rice genome sequences was scanned against
protein family profiles obtained from the NCBI (National
Centre for Biotechnology Information) conserved
domain database (NCBI-CDD[18]), a compilation of
multiple sequence alignments representing protein
domains. It has been populated with alignment data from
Pfam[37] and SMART [90], plus contributions from NCBI
such as COG[91] using RPS-BLAST[18]. The E-value
threshold was the same as employed for IMPALA[17].
e. The hits obtained from all the above methods were
pooled together and a non-redundant dataset was
derived. Proteins in this dataset were clustered using CDHIT program[92] and MALIGN[93] and the hits sharing
100% sequence identity with other proteins were classified as redundant and not considered for further analysis.
Proteins appearing as fragments or identical to larger proteins were also purged from the dataset.
Sequence properties of Arabidopsis and rice serine
proteases
a. The cellular localizations of serine protease-like proteins identified in the two plant species was predicted
using TargetP[19].

b. Co-existing domains were predicted employing
HMMPFAM[16] and RPS-BLAST[18] sequence to profile
matching methods. Each serine-protease sequence was
matched to protein family profiles corresponding to
PfamA[37] and NCBI-CDD[18]. Conservation of domain
architectures across various lineages (Figure 2) was determined using NCBI Conserved domain architecture
retrieval tool (CDART)[94] and Pfam database[37].
Orthologue sequence analysis
Each of the Arabidopsis and rice serine protease-like proteins was searched against the other proteome and conversely, the nearest homologue was searched back in first
proteome. Two sequences were defined as orthologues
when each of them was the best hit of the other and if they
exhibit the same domain architecture (See additional file
4: Table S4.pdf).
Chromosomal locations and recent duplications
The chromosomal locations for all Arabidopsis and rice serine protease sequences were retrieved from TIGR[20].
Subsequently, the Arabidopsis and rice proteomes were
searched for gene paralogues using a BLAST[18] based
approach similar to the one employed for orthologue
sequence analysis and two sequences were defined as
most recent paralogues when each of them was the best
non-self hit of the other (Tables 2, 3).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/200

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments of the serine-protease
domains were performed using CLUSTALW program[95].
In order to compare equivalent regions, the domain
regions were retrieved employing HMMALIGN[16],
sequence to profile matching method against the PfamA
database[37]. Proteins lacking a significant portion of the
protease-like domain were not included in alignments. A
Blosum 30 matrix, an open gap penalty of 10 and an
extension penalty of 0.05 were the parameters employed
for multiple sequence alignment. An overall phylogenetic
tree was inferred from the multiple sequence alignment
with PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) 3.65[96].
Bootstrapping was performed 100 times using SEQBOOT[96] to obtain support values for each internal
branch (to reduce the sampling error, bootstrapping is a
method of testing the reliability of a dataset by the creation of pseudo replicate datasets by resampling. Bootstrapping assesses whether stochastic effects have
influenced the distribution of amino acids). Pairwise distances were determined with PROTDIST[96]. Neighborjoining phylogenetic trees were calculated with NEIGHBOR[96] using standard parameters. The majority-rule
consensus trees of all bootstrapped sequences were
obtained with the program CONSENSE[96]. Representations of the calculated trees were constructed using
TreeView[97]. Clusters with bootstrap values greater than
50% were defined as confirmed subgroups, and sequences
with lower values added to these subgroups according to
their sequence similarity in the alignment as judged by
visual inspection. The pairwise percentage identity
between the serine protease-like domain regions of any
two sequences belonging to the same serine protease family was determined by MALFORM, a constituent of
MALIGN multiple alignment program[93].
