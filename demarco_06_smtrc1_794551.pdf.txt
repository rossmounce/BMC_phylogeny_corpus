Abstract
Background: The CACTA (also called En/Spm) superfamily of DNA-only transposons contain the
core sequence CACTA in their Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and so far have only been
described in plants. Large transcriptome and genome sequence data have recently become publicly
available for Schistosoma mansoni, a digenetic blood fluke that is a major causative agent of
schistosomiasis in humans, and have provided a comprehensive repository for the discovery of
novel genes and repetitive elements. Despite the extensive description of retroelements in S.
mansoni, just a single DNA-only transposon belonging to the Merlin family has so far been reported
in this organism.
Results: We describe a novel S. mansoni transposon named SmTRC1, for S. mansoni Transposon
Related to CACTA 1, an element that shares several characteristics with plant CACTA
transposons. Southern blotting indicates approximately 30–300 copies of SmTRC1 in the S. mansoni
genome. Using genomic PCR followed by cloning and sequencing, we amplified and characterized
a full-length and a truncated copy of this element. RT-PCR using S. mansoni mRNA followed by
cloning and sequencing revealed several alternatively spliced transcripts of this transposon,
resulting in distinct ORFs coding for different proteins. Interestingly, a survey of complete genomes
from animals and fungi revealed several other novel TRC elements, indicating new families of DNA
transposons belonging to the CACTA superfamily that have not previously been reported in these
kingdoms. The first three bases in the S. mansoni TIR are CCC and they are identical to those in
the TIRs of the insects Aedes aegypti and Tribolium castaneum, suggesting that animal TRCs may
display a CCC core sequence.
Conclusion: The DNA-only transposable element SmTRC1 from S. mansoni exhibits various
characteristics, such as generation of multiple alternatively-spliced transcripts, the presence of
terminal inverted repeats at the extremities of the elements flanked by direct repeats and the
presence of a Transposase_21 domain, that suggest a distant relationship to CACTA transposons
from Magnoliophyta. Several sequences from other Metazoa and Fungi code for proteins similar to
those encoded by SmTRC1, suggesting that such elements have a common ancestry, and indicating
inheritance through vertical transmission before separation of the Eumetazoa, Fungi and Plants.

Background
Transposable elements constitute a large portion of the
genomes of eukaryotes and play an important role in
genome structure and evolution [1,2]. They can be
assigned to two broad groups, retroelements (Class I) and
DNA-only transposable elements (Class II). Unlike the
retroelements, DNA-only transposons do not rely on a
RNA intermediate, but transpose directly from DNA using
a multi-step cut and paste mechanism catalyzed by a
transposase that recognizes the transposon DNA by its
Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) (Reviewed in [3]). Class
II elements in eukaryotes can be categorized on the basis
of sequence similarities into nine superfamilies: MarinerTC1; hAT; P; Mutator; CACTA; PIF/Harbinger; Transib;
piggyBac; and Merlin [3-5].
Most elements of the CACTA superfamily of DNA-only
transposons (also called En/Spm) contain the core
sequence CACTA in their TIRs and so far have only been
described in plants [3,5]. The prototypical CACTA maize
Suppressor-mutator (Spm) transposon was one of the first
transposons described by Barbara McClintock [6], and
subsequent studies have shown that most of its length is
occupied by a single transcription unit, which can be alternatively spliced to generate four distinct transcripts (tnpA
to tnpD) encoding different proteins [7]. Two of these
transcripts, tnpA and tnpD, encode proteins that have been
shown to be essential for transposition [8,9]. TNPA protein has been shown to perform a role in reactivating the
methylated transposon promoter and to repress active
unmethylated promoter [10,11], while TNPD protein
interacts directly with TNPA and stabilizes its binding to
DNA [12].
Schistosoma mansoni, a digenetic blood fluke, is a major
cause of schistosomiasis in humans and an important
source of morbidity on a global scale. The disease is
endemic in 74 developing countries, infecting about 200
million individuals, and an additional 500–600 million
are estimated to be at risk [13]. The S. mansoni genome is
approximately 270 Mbp long [14] and 55% of its content
is expected to comprise mobile elements or other repetitive sequences [15]. Recently, independent transcriptome
and genome sequencing initiatives have provided an
extensive repository for the discovery of novel genes and
repetitive elements [16,17]. Despite the extensive description of retroelements in S. mansoni [15,18,19], so far the
presence of just a single DNA-only transposon, belonging
to the Merlin family, has been reported in this organism
[4].
Using the public repository of S. mansoni sequence data as
a starting point, we describe a novel S. mansoni transposon
named SmTRC1, an element that shares several characteristics with plant CACTA transposons, which suggests a dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/89

tant relationship between these elements. A survey of
complete genomes from the Animal and Fungi kingdoms
revealed novel families of DNA transposons belonging to
the CACTA superfamily.

Results and discussion
Isolation of SmTRC1 clones from S. mansoni genome
Our attention was drawn to the S. mansoni genomic
sequence of Supercontig_0018735 available at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [20] while we were manually
examining the splicing pattern of the gene represented by
transcript SmAE C610100.1 [16]. Three exons of the latter
mapped to bases 2032 to 2160, 6905 to 6961 and 7001 to
7231 of Supercontig_0018735. Upon examining the
intron formed between bases 2160 to 6905 we detected a
4.5 kbp element that extended between bases 2164 and
6907 with one Open Reading Frame (referred to as
SmTRC1-ORF in the following text) of 1,683 bp, which
codes for a sequence with similarity (E-value 10-5) to a
DNA-only transposon. An inverted repeat motif was
found at both extremities (the left with 54 bp and the
right missing only one base), suggesting that this intron is
an inserted mobile element (Figure 1B). Although the element may be considered large (4.5 kpb) in comparison,
for example, to Mariner family transposons (1.3 to 2.4
kpb) [21], it is considerably smaller than CACTA elements
such as Spm/En (8.3 kpb) [8] and Rim coding elements
(14.1 kpb on average) [22]. We detected several other copies of the element in the S. mansoni genome sequence
dataset displaying a perfect 54 bp inverted repeat at both
extremities, confirming the sequence and correct length of
the Transposon Inverted Repeat (TIR) (Figure 2A). We
named these elements SmTRC1 (an abbreviation for
Schistosoma mansoni Transposon Related to CACTA transposons) because of its several similarities to transposons
of the CACTA family, as described in the text below.

We found a 2 bp direct repeat suggestive of target site
duplication flanking the inverted repeat in 7 out of 14
(50%) of the copies of these elements analyzed (Figure
2B). Three of these copies were found to be inserted into
repetitive elements of the S. mansoni genome. Two of
them were inserted into copies of the S. mansoni LTR retrotransposons Saci-1 and Saci-4 [18,19] and one into an
unidentified repetitive element of which there are at least
40 copies in the preliminary assembly of the S. mansoni
genome. When the flanking sequences of these three elements were aligned with paralogous sequence copies of
the respective repetitive element [GenBank:BH202328.1,
GenBank:BN000802.1, GenBank:AL620357.1] obtained
from either the GSS or the nr databases at GenBank, it was
clear that the original repetitive element (not having an
inserted transposon) contained none of the direct repeats
flanking the SmTRC1 elements (Figure 2C); one of the
2bp direct repeat motifs was missing from the original

repetitive element. This suggests that the direct repeats are
in fact target-site duplications created by insertion of the
SmTRC1 element. It is well known that transposon integration results in the duplication of a short host sequence
at the insertion site and that the length of the target-site
duplication is determined by the properties of each transposase [3], therefore these data provide further evidence
for the mobility of SmTRC1 elements.
Using different combinations of a set of primers designed
from the extremities of the transposon sequence from
Supercontig_0018735, we performed several PCR reactions to amplify genomic copies of SmTRC1. A typical
result is shown in Figure 1A; the major products are
approximately 2.5 kbp. Cloning and sequencing of this

major band revealed a 2274 bp clone that represented a
truncated copy of SmTRC1, which we designated
SmTRC1d1 (Figure 1B, bottom). This element displays a
truncated ORF that codes for only 98 amino acids out of
the 560 deduced from the full-length transposon. The
entire sequence of SmTRC1d1 aligns with the full-length
genomic transposon, but it lacks part of the ORF and its 3'
tandem repeat (Figure 1B), hence its short length. The
diversity of lower molecular weight bands generated by
PCR (Figure 1A) suggests that SmTRC1 copies of several
sizes, differently truncated, must exist in the S. mansoni
genome.
For one set of PCR amplifications with genomic DNA as
template, we used a 16 bp region downstream from the

left TIR as forward primer, and a sequence composed of 8
bp overlapping the 3'-end of the right TIR plus a 12 bp
region immediately downstream as reverse primer. This
primer set permitted a copy of approximately 4.7 kb to be
amplified; this copy was cloned and sequenced (Figure
1B, middle). The sequence was named SmTRC1f1; it
lacked 71 bp at its 5'-end, including the left TIR, owing to
the design of the primer used in the amplification reaction, but otherwise it appears to represent an integral copy
of SmTRC1 (Figure 1B, middle). In fact, this clone displays 99.8 % nucleotide identity (only 9 mismatches over
4675 nucleotides) with the element described in
Supercontig_0018735, and one base in the left TIR is
deleted in both sequences. This suggests that we had
cloned from the PCR products a copy representing the
sequence contained in Supercontig_0018735; the nine
mismatched bases may have arisen from mutations generated either naturally in the field among the copies from
individual parasites, or artificially from the Taq polymerase during the PCR amplification step.
Identification of TRC transposons in other species
A BLASTP search against the nr database at GenBank was
performed using the protein encoded by SmTRC1-ORF as
query. The highest hits produced were with two proteins
of unknown function from Schistosoma japonicum [GenBank:AAW24935.1] (with E-value 10-20) and Anopheles
gambiae [GenBank:EAA01922.3] (with E-value 10-9). The
next best hits (E-value 10-5) were with the TNPD proteins
of CACTA transposons from Oryza sativa. It is worth noting that the region displaying similarity corresponds
exactly to the Transposase_21 domain (Pfam 02992). In
fact, as described below, global alignment of this region of
the SmTRC1-ORF product with the Transposase_21
domains of CACTA transposons indicates several conserved residues.

The SmTRC1-ORF sequence was used as query to perform
an additional TBLASTN search directly into several complete animal and fungal genomes using the Genomic Blast
tool at NCBI. This search produced hits indicating high
similarity (E-value 10-88 to 10-30) between the deduced
SmTRC1-ORF translated sequence and translated
sequences from genomes of such diverse animals as
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Ciona intestinalis, Danio rerio
and Aedes aegypti. In all these cases, practically the whole
protein was aligned, not only the Transposase_21
domain. The search against fungal genomes produced hits
indicating moderate similarity (E-values 10-16 to 10-4)
between the deduced SmTRC1-ORF translated sequence
and translated sequences from the genomes of e.g. Rhizopus oryzae, Coprinopsis cinerea and Phanerochaete chrysosporium. For several of the above organisms, multiple hits
were generated in the TBLASTN searches against the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/89

genomic sequence, indicating that more than one copy
must be present in their genomes.
As noted earlier, SmTRC1 has a 54 bp TIR sequence at its
extremities, which is consistently present in all copies
examined. Also, the S. mansoni TIR sequence has an internal repeat of the motif AAAGGGGAAATAAAG. A TRC element of approximately 5.2 kb was detected in the
Tribolium
castaneum
genomic
sequence
[GenBank:AAJJ01002287.1], and displays at its extremities an
inverted repeat of 27 bp with the sequence CCCTAGTAGCACCGAATATTTGTAAAA. In addition, we found a 10 bp
inverted repeat (CCCAGTCAAC) flanking a TRC in an A.
aegypti genomic segment [GenBank:AAGE02020512] that
delimits a 9.2 kb element. Both elements have a 2 bp
direct repeat adjacent to each inverted repeat (Figure 2B),
suggesting that target site duplication occurred when the
mobile elements were inserted, analogous to the situation
in the S. mansoni genomic sequences.
It is interesting to note that the first 3 bases in the TIRs
from the T. castaneum and A. aegypti elements are identical
to those in the TIR of S. mansoni (Figure 2D), suggesting
that animal TRCs may display a CCC core sequence in
their TIRs analogous to the CACTA core sequence in TIRs
from CACTA transposons. Comparison of these animal
TIRs with those of the plant CACTA transposons showed
a high similarity between the T. castaneum TIR core
sequence and the CACTA core sequence of plants, with
only one mismatched base (Figure 2D). No such level of
similarity is found in S. mansoni or A. aegypti TIR core
sequences, which display only 3 and 2 coincident bases,
respectively. Owing to the low numbers of bases and
examples involved, it is difficult to determine whether the
matching bases in T. castaneum are coincidental or reflect
an evolutionary process.
We have not been able to characterize the TIRs flanking
the ORFs of TRC elements in organisms other than those
described above, namely S. mansoni, A. aegypti and T. castaneum. In some animal species, the TIRs may have
become unrecognizable because of mutations or have
been lost through further recombination. Another possibility is that some of these elements may represent domesticated transposases [23-26], which no longer transpose
but perform another cellular function instead. Further
analyses of these animal elements are warranted to determine which is the case for each particular element.
Estimation of the number of copies of SmTRC1 by
Southern blotting
Southern blot analysis using a probe from the 5' end
region of SmTRC1 detected multiple bands when hybridized to EcoRI-digested genomic DNA, showing the existence of multiple copies (Figure 3). In parallel

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:89

experiments, we used the same number of radioactive
counts and probes of approximately the same size for
SmTRC1 and Saci-2, a previously described S. mansoni retrotransposon [18]. This allowed us to compare the two
hybridization signals directly to estimate the number of
SmTRC1 copies. The hybridization image was processed
to measure the signal intensity in each lane. For each
digestion, we divided the intensity from SmTRC1 by that
from Saci-2. The results from both EcoRI and StuI digestions show that SmTRC1 has approximately 1/3 of the
number of copies of Saci-2 (estimated at 85–850 by
DeMarco et al. [18]) (Figure 3). Extrapolation of these
data indicates that there are approximately 30–300 copies
of SmTRC1 in the S. mansoni genome. Amplification of
SmTRC1 genomic DNA by PCR suggested that most of the
genomic copies are not integral, implying that there are
only a few full-length copies of SmTRC1 in the genome.
SmTRC 1 produces multiple spliced transcripts
Mapping of the S. mansoni ESTs available at GenBank
dbEST to the full-length genomic copy of SmTRC1 produced a discontinuous alignment of 64 ESTs (Figure 4B
shows some representative examples), indicating that
messages transcribed from this transposon are subject to
alternative splicing. Moreover, several of the predicted
introns contain the canonical GT-AG splicing sites at their
extremities (Figure 4B). The diversity of patterns obtained
for different ESTs mapping to the same locus indicates that
a number of variant messages are produced by alternative
splicing.

Intriguingly, no S. japonicum ESTs with homology to
SmTRC1 were found by either BLASTN or TBLASTN
searches using the full-length S. mansoni element as query
against GenBank dbEST. This contrasts with the 70 S.
mansoni ESTs (64 with discontinuous and 6 with continuous alignments) that were found with an E-value lower
than 10-10 by a BLASTN search against the same database.
This leads us to hypothesize that these elements either
have a much lower transcriptional activity in S. japonicum
than in S. mansoni or have been eliminated from the S.
japonicum genome.
To document the existence of alternatively spliced transcripts in S. mansoni better, we used the sequences at the
extremities of many of the 70 ESTs known to align to
SmTRC1 to design primers for amplifying additional
SmTRC1 transcripts by RT-PCR using mRNA as template.
The RT-PCR reaction produced a strong amplification
band of approximately 900 bp and sub-products of lower
molecular weight, plus a faint amplification band of
higher molecular weight, which suggests that full-length
transcripts may be expressed at a low level (Figure 4A). No
amplification was seen in the control without reverse tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/89

scription, indicating that the amplification products were
in fact derived from bona fide transcribed messages.
We cloned and sequenced these different RT-PCR products. Mapping the different sequences to the full-length
SmTRC1 genomic sequence confirmed a diversity of splicing patterns, as already suggested by mapping of previously existing GenBank ESTs (Figure 4B). Two of the
sequenced clones (Clones B1 and B2) are similar in size to
the major band from the RT-PCR reaction, indicating that
this band may contain more than one product. These two
products did not overlap the ORF region, and the intron
formed between their exons 1 and 2 does not display the
canonical CT-AG splicing sites. However, mapping of
these transcripts to the entire S. mansoni genome showed
that canonical splicing sites are present at the extremities
of the same intron in some truncated forms of the element
(data not shown). This indicates that these transcripts
probably originated from truncated copies that are apparently transcriptionally active, being responsible for a considerable fraction of the SmTRC1 transcripts detected.
Clone B1 has an ORF of 681 bp that is interrupted by a
TGA stop codon at bases 439 to 441. However, alignment
with the SmTRC1f1 sequence shows substitution of the
TGA by CTA, which codes for isoleucine (Figure 4C). We
named this hypothetical protein product SmTRC-PrA (S.
mansoni TRC Protein A). In addition, a 4 bp deletion at
base 37 of this clone in relation to SmTRC1f1 produces a
frame shift at the beginning of the message. This suggests
that the transcript was generated from a truncated copy of
this element and that degeneration has produced the stop
codon interrupting the ORF. Clone B2 has a shorter ORF
that codes for a product very similar to the deduced N-terminal amino acids of the ORF product of clone B1; this
hypothetical protein product was named SmTRC-PrB.
Although most of the ESTs exhibit a splicing pattern that
does not include the SmTRC1-ORF sequence in any exon,
the presence of a few ESTs mapped in the region of the
SmTRC1-ORF suggests that it is actually transcribed and
translated. We were not able to clone the high molecular
weight products directly from the first RT-PCR using primers designed from the extremities of EST sequences, but we
designed a primer from the 5'-end of the SmTRC1-ORF
sequence and used a primer from the 3' extremity of the
transcripts. The ensuing RT-PCR resulted in the amplification of a partial transcript of 1.3 kb (data not shown).
Cloning and sequencing of this message showed that it
was indeed derived from exons mapping to the SmTRC1ORF as well as from other exons in the 3' region (Figure
4B, clone B4). It codes for an incomplete hypothetical
protein product of 125 amino acids named SmTRC-PrC.
A longer, complete version of the message encoding a
longer SmTRC-PrC protein is expected to exist, including

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:89

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/89

the Transposase_21 domain in its amino-terminal portion. Clone B4 also exhibits a second ORF coding for a
protein of 299 amino acids, 175 of which are shared with
SmTRC-PrA (76% of the SmTRC-PrA amino acids). In
view of this level of conservation, we named this protein
SmTRC-PrA2. Characterization of additional clones could
eventually identify further alternatively spliced forms of
SmTRC1-derived transcripts.
The Spm element of Maize has been shown to display four
different transcripts (TnpA-D) generated by alternative
splicing, each coding for a different protein product [7].
One of these transcripts (TnpD) spans the entire region
comprising ORFs 1 and 2 predicted in the spm DNA,
which explains the selection pressure that maintains such
ORFs in the transposon structure. Similarly, we predict the
existence of a spliced transcript spanning all the TRC1ORF to explain the maintenance of such a large ORF and
the conserved amino acid sequence observed on comparison with elements from other animals. The diverse splicing pattern of the transcribed S. mansoni messages results
in distinct ORFs coding for different proteins; only the
Transposase_21 domain of proteins encoded by these
transposons has a detectable similarity with proteins from
CACTA transposons. The other portions of the proteins
encoded by these alternatively spliced S. mansoni transcripts appear not to be detectably conserved.

Figure 3
Southern blotting of SmTRC1
Southern blotting of SmTRC1. S. mansoni genomic DNA
(5 µg) digested with the indicated restriction enzyme was
loaded in each lane and analyzed by Southern blotting with a
specific radiolabeled probe for SmTRC1. A parallel experiment was run with a probe for the Saci-2 retrotransposon
[18], which was used as a benchmark. Probes of similar sizes
and the same number of radioactive counts were used for
each of the two hybridizations. Below the figure, the ratio
between the total intensities of the SmTRC1/Saci-2 signals is
indicated. This value was calculated for each digestion by
integrating the signal from all the bands, and the average and
total deviation was obtained by computing data from the two
different digestions.

Spm TnpA, a short alternatively spliced transcript that
lacks the Transposase_21 domain, is apparently more
abundantly transcribed in plants than the other, longer
transcripts. This reflects the results of RT-PCR experiments
suggesting that shorter TRC transcripts are more abundantly transcribed in S. mansoni than the longer alternatively spliced transcript that includes the Transposase_21
domain. Spm TnpD displays two ORFs in tandem, one
coding for TNPD and the other for TNPA [8]. Likewise,
clone B4 also exhibits two ORFs in tandem, one coding
for SmTRC-PrC and the other for a SmTRC-PrA-like protein.
SmTRC 1 ORF contains a conserved Transposase_21
domain
Multiple protein sequence alignment (Figure 5) of the
Transposase_21 domain (PFAM# PF02992) was performed using sequences from known CACTA transposons
from several plants [22,27,28], together with the related
domain in the deduced ORFs from S. mansoni and several
other metazoan and fungal elements identified in the
present work by BLAST analysis (as described above).
Although there is a visible divergence between the
domains from elements derived from different phyla,
conservation of several residues is apparent (Figure 5). It
is also interesting to note that the TRC-like sequence
derived from the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans has sev-

eral characteristics that distinguish it from the other fungal sequences, which are apparently very similar to one
another.
Three different conserved motifs can be discerned,
marked I-III in the aligned proteins (Figure 5). In most of
the elements, a first conserved motif I/L/V-X-I/L/V/F-X-I/
L/V/F-X2-D-G-X3-F/Y-X7–9-W-P-I/L/V of Transposase_21
domain is present (Figure 5, box I); however, in 3 out of 4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/89

fungal sequences this motif shows an interchange
between tryptophan and glycine residues. This suggests
that these two residues have an important role and that
only the position of one residue relative to the other is
essential for activity of this protein. In the second conserved domain (Figure 5, box II), the fungal proteins show
a level of conservation comparable to Magnoliophyta and
higher than Eumetazoa. Thus, only proteins from Fungi
and Magnoliophyta have a proline immediately after the

eleven novel CACTA-related elements identified here were included: seven from Eumetazoa and four from Fungi. Shading indicates the level of conservation of each residue. Boxes with Roman numbers I to III indicate conserved motifs of the
Transposase_21 domain in all organisms. Box marked with A indicates a Transposase_21 motif displayed only by Eumetazoa
and Fungi proteins.

conserved glycine residue (Figure 5, box II), and an additional P-L/I conserved motif in the middle of this domain;
both are absent from Eumetazoa. Interestingly, we identified a L/V/I-D-X-L/M-H-X3-L-G motif in the
Transposase_21 domain that is present in the eumetazoan
TRC elements (Figure 5, box A) and also in 3 out of the 4
fungal TRC proteins, but is absent in proteins from Magnoliophyta.
Among the conserved residues there are two aspartyl residues (DD), one in the first and one in the third conserved
domain, separated by 80 residues; this is very similar to
the distance between the two aspartyl residues in the DDE
motifs in Tn3 transposases [29]. There is also a glutamyl
residue (E) in the conserved domain 2 in all but three
sequences, two of which have this residue in adjacent
positions and one in a position 2 residues away. It is possible that conservation of such an amino acid triad reflects
a similar catalytic mechanism in the DDE motif despite
the different arrangement of residues. In this case its function would be similar to that described for the DDE motif,
which is presumed to coordinate divalent metal ions to
promote catalysis of DNA cleavage and ligation [3]. Moreover, there is a conserved CXXC motif in the conserved
domain 3 that is identical to the configuration of cysteines
in the zinc-finger-like motifs (HHCC domains) of retroviral integrases, suggesting that TRC cysteines may also be
involved in DNA binding.
A phylogenetic tree (Figure 6) was generated from the
three conserved regions (I-III) shown in the alignment of
Figure 5. Although the analysis does not permit a clear
inference of phylogeny within the Eumetazoan elements,
it clearly shows the separation of the Eumetazoa and Plant
branches (Figure 6). Interestingly, three of the Fungi elements appear to be distinct from the others, but one of
them, the C. neoformans element, appears to be at a basal
position in relation to plant transposons. With the exception of the latter, the analysis clearly shows the separation
between Plants, Fungi and Eumetazoa.

Conclusion
The DNA-only transposable element SmTRC1 from S.
mansoni exhibits various characteristics, such as generation of multiple spliced transcripts, the presence of terminal inverted repeats at the extremities of the elements
flanked by direct repeats and the presence of a
Transposase_21 domain, that suggest a distant relationship to CACTA transposons from Magnoliophyta. Despite
these similarities, conservation of proteins deduced from
this new family of transposons in relation to CACTA
transposons is restricted to the Transposase_21 domain.
The presence in S. mansoni of multiple transcripts and a
higher expression level of a shorter alternatively spliced
transcript coding for an ORF lacking the Transposase_21

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/89

domain suggests that similar strategies are employed by
transposons from animals and plants. The absence of conservation between SmTRC-PrA/SmTRC-PrB and plant
TNPA protein indicates that these S. mansoni proteins
either have a different evolutionary origin or are very
divergent. The latter is more probable since we could
detect no similarity between the S. mansoni proteins
SmTRC-PrA and SmTRC-PrB and any sequences encoded
in other animal or fungal TRC elements by BLASTP or
TBLASTN comparison to the genomes of these organisms,
suggesting that this protein is rapidly evolving. Nevertheless, SmTRC-PrA must perform an analogous role to the
DNA binding function described for TNPA in plant transposons, and experimental verification of this hypothesis is
warranted.
Several sequences from Metazoa and Fungi code for proteins similar to those encoded by SmTRC, providing evidence that this superfamily exists in branches other than
Plants. Data from phylogenetic analysis of the
Transposase_21 domain suggests a common ancestry for
such elements, and indicates inheritance through vertical
transmission before the separation of Eumetazoa, Fungi
and Plants. This organization permits a division of the
CACTA superfamily into 3 different families, each represented by one of these branches (circles in Figure 6). The
C. neoformans element appears to be an exception, being
more closely related to the plant transposon family than
to the Fungi family.
In view of the evolutionary distance between these related
elements, the few conserved amino acids of the
Transposase_21 domain must be essential for TNPD function. These conserved residues are preferential targets for
future mutagenesis experiments to determine the importance of the Transposase_21 domain for TNPD function,
as they are expected to abolish or significantly alter the
domain functionality.
Discovery of this new transposable element in S. mansoni
should help in obtaining a more complete annotation of
the genome of this parasite. Apparently DNA transposons
are not as widespread as retroelements in S. mansoni, since
only 2 elements of the former type ([4]; this report) and
28 of the latter type [15,19] have been described. Nevertheless, DNA transposons may have a significant impact
on the biology of the parasite. Comparison between Merlin and SmTRC1 shows that these elements have very distinct characteristics, the former being more compact (1.4
kpb [4] as opposed to 4.5 kbp) and presenting a slightly
higher copy number, with an estimated 500 copies [4]
compared to 30–300 for SmTRC1. On the other hand,
most of the copies from both SmTRC1 and Merlin elements appear to be internal deletion derivatives. Several
transcripts of both elements have been detected in the S.

mansoni EST database, suggesting that both are transcriptionally active.
In addition, it is interesting to consider the SmTRC1 element as a potential new tool for insertional mutagenesis
experiments in Schistosoma and other platyhelminths;
CACTA elements have been successfully used for this pur-

pose in plants [30,31]. Moreover, other superfamilies of
transposons have been widely used for invertebrate and
vertebrate transgene experiments and constitute a valuable tool for analyzing gene function and effects on phenotype [32-34]. Further studies on other Metazoa and Fungi
elements from the family described here will certainly
provide candidate vectors for several other organisms.

Methods
RT-PCR and genomic DNA PCR
The BH isolates of S. mansoni were maintained in the laboratory by routine passage through mice and snails. Adult
parasites were obtained by portal perfusion of hamsters 7
to 8 weeks after infection. Tissues were conserved in
RNALater (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Tissue mRNAs were extracted using MAC isolation kits (Miltenyi Biotec). mRNA samples were treated
with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (1 U/10 µl; Promega) for 30
minutes at 37°C. cDNAs were prepared using the Superscript II first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. A parallel
control reaction was performed without the addition of
reverse transcriptase and used as template for a PCR reaction to detect any genomic DNA contamination. The PCR
step was performed using Advantage II polymerase (Clontech) with the buffer supplied by the manufacturer, 200
µM dNTPs, and 200 nM of each primer using the following program: 95°C (1 min); 35 cycles of 95°C (30 s),
55°C (30 s) and 68°C (4 min); and final extension at
68°C (3 min). The reaction products were cloned into
pGem-T vector (Promega) and sequenced.

Genomic DNA was extracted from 800 mg of adult worms
(approximately 3,000 worms) using the protocol
described by Ausubel et al. [35]. PCR reactions were performed using the same conditions as described in the previous paragraph.
Southern Blot
Southern blot experiments for estimating the number of
copies of SmTRC1 were performed according to the protocol described by DeMarco et al. [18], except that StuI
was used in place of BamHI and that Saci-2 was used as a
benchmark. The total signal intensity for each lane was
calculated using ImageQuant v5.1 (Molecular Dynamics),
with a fixed area rectangle to delimit the area for each
sample analyzed.
Sequence alignment and construction of phylogenetic
trees
Using the deduced protein sequence of the
Transposase_21 domain from SmTRC1, we retrieved several other sequences that showed significant similarity (Evalues less than 10-4) in a tBLASTn search against genomes
of Metazoa and Fungi at NCBI. We used these sequences
along with the sequences of known CACTA transposons
from Magnoliophyta to perform an alignment using ClustalX v1.83 [36]. Alignments were imported to the GeneDoc program V2.6.002 for shading of conserved residues.
Further analysis with Clustal X and the neighbor-joining
method, using the three conserved regions indicated by
boxes I to III in Figure 5 and excluding positions with
gaps, resulted in the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 6.
