Genetic and functional characterization of the
NanA sialidase from Clostridium chauvoei

Abstract
Clostridium chauvoei is the causative agent of blackleg, a wide spread serious infection of cattle and sheep with
high mortality. In this study we have analyzed the sialidase activity of the NanA protein of C. chauvoei and cloned
the sialidase gene nanA. Sialidase is encoded as a precursor protein of 722 amino acids with a 26 amino acid
signal peptide. The mature sialidase has a calculated molecular mass of 81 kDa and contains the carbohydrate
binding module 32 (CBM32, or F5/8 type C domain), the sialic acid binding module CBM40 and the enzymatically
active sialidase domain found in all pro- and eukaryotic sialidases. Sialidase activity does not require the CBM32
domain. The NanA protein is secreted by C. chauvoei as a dimer. The nanA gene was found to be conserved and
sialidase activity was found in C. chauvoei strains isolated over a period of 50 years from various geographical
locations. Antiserum directed against a recombinant 40 kDa peptide containing CBM40 and part of the
enzymatically active domain of NanA neutralized the secreted sialidase activity of all C. chauvoei strains tested.
Introduction
Clostridium chauvoei is an anaerobic, endospore-forming Gram-positive bacterium known to be the causative
agent of blackleg, a severe disease with high mortality
affecting young cattle and sheep of any age. While C.
chauvoei infections are specifically found in ruminants,
a case of human fulminant gas gangrene caused by C.
chauvoei was recently described [1]. Ingestion of C.
chauvoei spores is probably the most common form of
exposure and infected ruminants do not directly transmit the disease to other animals. The endospores of C.
chauvoei can lie dormant in the soil for years and, after
ingestion by the animal, they are assumed to cross over
the gastro-intestinal tract, enter the bloodstream and
finally migrate in various organs and muscles, where
they remain dormant until stimulated to cause disease
[2]. These spores are only activated in a low oxygen
environment, such as that of damaged or bruised tissue
in cattle. In sheep, blackleg is frequently associated with
wounding, such as at shearing cuts, tail docking and castration site [3]. Once these stimulating events occur, the
spores in the infected tissue germinate and multiply into

the disease-causing C. chauvoei bacteria. Then, the disease progresses rapidly, with the infected animal dying
in 12 to 36 h after the appearance of the first symptoms
[4]. The molecular mechanisms of blackleg are not
clearly understood. Due to the peracute evolution with
severe oedematous lesions restricted to the local area,
fever, loss of appetite, lameness and depression observed
in blackleg outbreaks, it is speculated that virulence of
C. chauvoei is caused by rapid spread of the activated,
vegetative form of the bacterium in the infected tissue,
followed by the production of potent toxins [4,5].
Although sialidases and toxins produced by C. chauvoei
are believed to play a significant role in the spread of
the pathogen and in the induction of lesions in affected
tissues [5], they have not yet been characterized at the
molecular and genetic level. It has to be mentioned here
that, to date, only a few DNA sequences of C. chauvoei
have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases
including the 16S and the 23S rRNA genes, the 16S-23S
rRNA spacer region, and the flagellin gene [6,7].
Sialidases, or neuraminidases (EC 3.2.1.18), are
enzymes that cleave N-acetylneuraminic acid from carbohydrate polymers, such as mucin, glycoproteins, gangliosides and other sialoglycoconjugates, located on many
mammalian cell membranes. The mature sialidase is
generally composed of three main domains (Figure 1).
At its N-terminal end, it contains the F5/8 type C

domain, alternatively designated CBM32 (carbohydrate
binding module 32) or discoidin domain, that appears to
be primarily involved in binding of terminal galactoconfigured sugar residues and is also found in the C.
perfringens sialidase NanJ [8]. The central domain contains a CBM40 module (or lectin-like sialic acid binding
domain) that was shown to be specific for binding sialic
acid residues in NanJ of C. perfringens [8]. The enzymatically active site of sialidases is in the C-terminal end
that contains the usual catalytic residues that are common to all sialidases [9-11], including a catalytic nucleophile tyrosine, an arginine triad that interacts with the
carboxylate group of sialic acid, a tryptophan residue
that forms a weak H-bond with the glycerol side chain
of sialic acid, and an aspartic acid that forms H-bonds
with the four OH-groups of sialic acid. Furthermore, the
enzymatically active domain contains four “Asp-boxes”
[10] characterized by the motif Ser-X-Asp-X-Gly-XThr-Trp, and the first arginine of the catalytic triad of
sialidases generally belongs to a RIP (Arg-Ile-Pro) motif
[12].
Sialidases have been found in viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi and metazoans [13]. In viruses, parasites and
bacteria, sialidases are thought to be important for survival and pathogenicity of the organisms [14]. It has
been established that viral sialidases have a central role
in the pathogenesis of influenza [14,15]. The importance
of sialidase in respiratory tract infections has been
demonstrated for two bacterial species: Streptococcus
pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The neuraminidases (sialidases) NanA and NanB of S. pneumoniae
have been shown to be essential for successful colonization of both upper and lower respiratory tract and for
pneumococcal survival in the blood using an outbred
MF1 mouse or chinchilla model [16,17]. The sialidase
produced by P. aeruginosa has been shown to be a

critical factor for colonization of the upper respiratory
tract. It has also been shown that viral neuraminidase
inhibitors blocked biofilm production and the bacterial
colonization by P. aeruginosa [18]. Recently, Mally and
colleagues [19] demonstrated the impact of sialidase in
Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal canine bacterium of the oral flora, that can cause severe septicaemia and meningitis in humans [20]. Wild type C.
canimorsus is dependent on a surface exposed sialidase
for growth and persistence in a murine infection model,
whereas a sialidase deficient C. canimorsus mutant was
unable to grow and persist in mice [19]. Sialidase may
have an important role in blackleg by degrading tight
junctions upon cleavage of sialic acids at a high rate,
thus allowing the bacterium to spread through host tissue [5]. A sialidase activity has been reported in C.
chauvoei [21], but the sialidase enzyme has not yet been
characterized in detail [22,23]. Furthermore, the molecular and genetic basis of sialidase in C. chauvoei is still
unclear.
This study reports the cloning of the nanA sialidase
gene from C. chauvoei, its expression and the characterization of the sialidase NanA protein. Under native conditions in bacterial culture medium, C. chauvoei
sialidase is found as a 150 kDa protein, in the form of a
dimer of two NanA peptides with an apparent molecular
mass of 72 kDa.

(Becton Dickinson AG, Allschwil, Switzerland), 2% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1%
yeast extract (Becton Dickinson AG), and 0.1% Lcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich chemical)) at 37°C for up to 72
h. Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani
(LB) broth or on LB agar at 37°C. Antibiotics (ampicillin, 100 μg/mL) were added for selection of E. coli carrying recombinant plasmids.
DNA from C. chauvoei strains was extracted by the
guanidium thiocyanate method [24]. Ligation, subcloning, plasmid extraction of the DNA fragments and agarose gel electrophoresis (0.7%) were performed as
described [25]. Plasmid extraction from recombinant E.
coli clones was done by alkaline lysis using a Miniprep
kit (PeqLab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany).
Sequence analysis was performed using an ampli-Taq FS
dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) and the universal primers complementary to the
T3 and T7 promoters flanking the multiple cloning site
of pBK-CMV, or primers that were derived from
obtained DNA sequences.
Comparisons of DNA sequences and their corresponding amino acid (aa) sequences with DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases were performed using BLAST analysis
[26]. The molecular mass and theoretical isoelectric
points (pI) of the sialidase were calculated using ProtParam [27]. Pattern and profile searches were carried out
at the online servers Motif Scan [28] and InterProScan
[29]. The presence and location of signal peptide cleavage
sites in the amino acid sequence were predicted with the
program SignalP 3.0 [30]. Prediction of transmembrane
helices and topology of the sialidase was carried out with
the programs HMMTOP 2.0 [31] and Phobius [32]. The
neighbour joining tree of aa sequences from clostridial
sialidases was constructed with multiple amino acid
sequence alignment by ClustalW2 [33].

medium was centrifuged at 9000 × g at 4°C for 20 min.
Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated overnight
at 4°C upon addition of 70% (w/v) ammonium sulphate.
Precipitated proteins were sedimented by centrifugation
for 10 min at 12000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 10
mL of dialysis buffer (0.1 M Na-bicarbonate, pH 8.3,
0.25 M NaCl) and then dialyzed overnight at 4°C with
gentle stirring. Aliquots of 500 μL containing 200 μg of
dialyzed proteins or 50 μg of purified recombinant protein were mixed with the same quantity of Gerbu adjuvant (Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH, Gaiberg, Germany) for
immunizing rabbits three times at intervals of two
weeks. Rabbits were bled two weeks after the last immunization and all serum samples were then incubated for
30 min at 56°C to inactivate complement.
Construction of a genomic library, cloning of the nanA
gene and DNA sequence analysis

Genomic DNA of C. chauvoei strain JF4135 (other
name: C6 O/D1126/04; Table 1), a strain that caused
acute blackleg in Switzerland in 2004, was partially
digested with Sau3AI and fragments from 2 to 4 kb
were selected to construct a genomic library, using
BamHI-digested l-ZAP-express vector arms, which was
packaged with the Gigapack-11 packaging system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The phage library was plated
using standard protocols on the E. coli strain XL-1 Blue
MRF’. Screening of transformed E. coli was performed
with rabbit serum against secreted proteins of C. chauvoei, raised as described above, used at a dilution of
1:100. Positive clones were amplified and finally subjected to in vivo excision using the f1 helper phage in E.
coli strain XLOLR to obtain phagemid clones in expression vector pBK-CMV. A clone that strongly reacted
with the rabbit hyper-immune serum was revealed to
contain a 1.7 kb fragment whose sequence showed similarity to the sialidase gene of Clostridium septicum [34],
as determined by BLAST analysis. The remaining part
of the sialidase gene, named nanA (neuraminidase A),
was detected by screening the same genomic DNA
library by DNA:DNA hybridization with a 512 bp digoxigenin-labelled probe amplified from the cloned 1.7 kDa
fragment with primers digSiaCC_605F (TTACTAGTGGAAATGGTG)
and
digSiaCC_1117R
(CTTTTGCTGTAGTTTCAC). Digoxigenin labelling of
the probe was done according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland).
Upon analysis of few clones harbouring partial
sequences of nanA by primer walking with an ABI
Prism model 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems), the complete DNA sequence of the cloned gene
and the sequences upstream and downstream were
determined. Sequence alignment and editing were performed using the software Sequencher 3.0 (GeneCodes,

Vilei et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:2
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/2

Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The full length nanA gene of
strain JF3703 (other name: 595E; Table 1), a highly virulent strain isolated in New Zealand in 1959, was determined by PCR amplification and DNA sequence analysis
using the same primers as for strain JF4135. The
sequence data of the sialidase gene nanA have been
deposited in the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database
(European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK)
under accession numbers FM213081 for strain JF3703
and FM213082 for strain JF4135.
PCR analysis

The presence of the nanA gene of C. chauvoei was
demonstrated in all seven C. chauvoei strains examined
(Table 1) by PCR using the primers SiaCC_1371F
(ATCAGCAATAGATACATC) and SiaCC_1789R
(TGACCTCTTCCTGGTCCTGT). PCR was carried out
in 30 μL reaction mixtures containing 1 × reaction buffer B (supplied with FIREPol ® DNA polymerase), 2.5
mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM of each primer, 1 mM dNTPs, and
2.5 U of FIREPol ® polymerase (Solis BioDyne, Tartu,
Estonia). Approximately 100 ng of genomic DNA was
added as template. Cycling conditions on a 9800 Fast
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) were 3 min denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s,
56°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s. A final extension step
for 7 min at 72°C was included. Amplicons were purified with the High pure PCR product purification kit
(Roche Diagnostics).
Cloning and expression of the CBM40 module of the C.
chauvoei sialidase and production of antibodies

To generate polyclonal antibodies directed against the
CBM40 sialic acid binding domain of NanA, the coding
region from nt position 367 to 1389 of the nanA gene
(corresponding to aa 123 to 463), which also includes
the first Arg residue and the RIP (Arg-Ile-Pro) motif of
the catalytic site of sialidases, was amplified from C.
chauvoei strain JF4135 using the primers Sia40_NcoIF
(ggtcccatggGTATAAAAGAATACAAAATTTATGCG)
and Sia40_HindIIIR (cccaagcttGATGTATCTATTGCTGATGATGCTCC) (nucleotides in lower case are extensions and underlined nucleotides are recognition sites
for the restriction enzymes NcoI or HindIII). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA) and
transformed into E. coli strain DH5a. Recombinant plasmids with the correct sequence were then digested with
NcoI and HindIII, and the DNA fragments were inserted
into the expression vector pETHIS-1 [35]. The cloned
insert was sequenced to ensure correct fusion with the
vector’s poly-His codons before being transformed into
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells [36] for expression. Induction
and subsequent purification of the recombinant 40 kDa

Page 4 of 9

His-tagged protein was performed as described [37].
Purified 40 kDa His-tagged protein was used to immunize rabbits as described above.
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting

Pellets and supernatants of C. chauvoei strains (Table 1)
incubated at 37°C under anaerobic conditions in TGY
medium for 72 h were examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were separated on 12% acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE under
denaturing or non-denaturing conditions [38]. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed in the
absence of reducing agents. In order to detect the sialidase, the immunoblot membranes were incubated with
rabbit polyclonal anti-sialidase 40 kDa peptide serum
(diluted 1:1000), followed by incubation with a phosphate- or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
heavy and light chains (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) diluted 1:2000.
Expression of functional NanA in E. coli DH5a

To express enzymatically active recombinant NanA, we
amplified the part of the nanA gene from nt position 364
to 2316 (corresponding to aa 122 to 772), encoding
CBM40 (sialic acid binding module) and the enzymatically
active domain but not CBM32 (Figure 1), from C. chauvoei
strain JF4135 using the primers SiaCC_BssHIIF
(ttggcgcgcAATGATAAAAGAATACAAAATTTATGCG)
and
SiaCC_HindIIIR
(cccaagcttTATAAATTTCCATTTTCTGTTATTAAACC) (nucleotides in lower case
are extensions containing recognition sites for the restriction enzymes BssHII and HindIII, respectively, that are
underlined). The resulting PCR product was cloned into
the vector T-easy (Promega Corp.) and transformed into E.
coli strain DH5a. Recombinant plasmids with the correct
sequence were then digested with BssHII and HindIII, and
the DNA fragment was ligated into the multiple cloning
site of vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
digested with BssHII and HindIII. Vector pFastBac1 was
chosen in order to express active NanA in both prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells, such as insect cells, utilizing the baculovirus expression system. This plasmid harbours the polyhedrin promoter from the baculovirus, which was shown
to also have an adequate ability for initiating expression of
introduced heterologous genes in E. coli [39]. E. coli DH5a
was transformed with pFastBac1::nanA and with empty
vector pFastBac1. Sialidase activity of recombinant E. coli
was measured using the sialidase spot test described below.
Sialidase activity tests

The fluorogenic substrate 2’-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-dN-acetylneuraminic acid (MU-Neu5Ac) (Sigma-Aldrich

chemical) was used to assay sialidase activity in a spot
test [40] and in a fluorimetric determination in culture
fluids [41,42].
For the spot test, a working solution of 15 μM MUNeu5Ac in 0.17 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) was
prepared. Either colonies of C. chauvoei, recombinant E.
coli, or 10 μL of supernatant from liquid C. chauvoei
cultures were spotted onto 1-mm Whatman filter paper
that had been previously moistened with the MUNeu5Ac working solution, and then incubated at 37°C
for 15 min. The reactions were stopped (0.085 M glycine, 0.2 M sodium carbonate, pH 9.4), the filter papers
air-dried and fluorescence observed under a UV light
(360 nm excitation wavelength). Observable bright blue
fluorescence was recorded as positive. Anti-sialidase 40
kDa peptide serum or pre-immune serum (both diluted
1:10) obtained from the same rabbit were spotted onto
the filter paper, at some distance from the bacterial
spots but still partially overlying them, to assess the neutralizing effect of the anti-sialidase serum against sialidase activity.
For the fluorimetric determination of culture fluid sialidase activity, strain JF4135 was grown anaerobically for
1 day at 37°C. After cell counting (OD600 nm), the culture was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min and the
supernatant was centrifuged again at 15000 × g for 15
min to obtain cell-free supernatant. The reaction was
performed in a total volume of 100 μL containing 30 μL
of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0), 10 μL of a 1
mM MU-Neu5Ac solution in water and 60 μL of sample
(each sample consisted of 54 μL cell-free supernatant
pre-incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 6 μL of anti-sialidase or pre-immune serum (at several dilutions) prior to
fluorimetric quantification of sialidase activity). Samples
were incubated at 37°C for 60 min and quantification of
sialidase activity was carried out kinetically (at 30 sec
intervals) in triplicate with an FLx800 fluorescence
microplate reader (BioTek, Luzern, Switzerland). Liberated 4-methylumbelliferone (MU) was quantified at 360/
40 nm excitation and 460/40 nm emission in relation to
a calibration curve obtained with MU standards (serial
2-fold dilutions ranging from 0 to 100 μM).

Results
Characteristics of the Clostridium chauvoei sialidase

The full length sialidase gene nanA of C. chauvoei strain
JF4135 consists of 2319 bp. A strong ribosome binding
site (AGGTGG) is found eight bases upstream of the
putative start codon ATG and is preceded by a potential
clostridial promoter sequence including a TATA box
(TATAAAAT) and a -35 element (TTTACA) (Figure 1).
The NanA protein derived from the nucleotide sequence
consists of 772 aa, with a predicted molecular mass of
84.0 kDa and a pI of 4.89. The aa sequence derived

Page 5 of 9

from the DNA sequence reveals a leader sequence peptidase cleavage site between position 26 and 27 (Ile-TyrAla↓Asp-Ile), which is characteristic for secreted proteins of Gram-positive bacteria. The putative mature sialidase consists of 746 aa with a calculated molecular
mass of 81.1 kDa. At its N-terminal end, aa residues 42
to 186 (numbering always includes the aa residues of
the precursor) form the CBM32 module (Figure 1). In
the central portion of NanA, aa 190 to 370 form the
CBM40 module. The enzymatically active site ranging
from aa 384 to 770 contains the usual catalytic residues,
common to all sialidases: Tyr-728 (catalytic nucleophile),
Arg-400, Arg-613 and Arg-693 (forming the arginine
triad, whereas Arg-400 is contained in the RIP motif),
Trp-577 (that interacts with the glycerol side chain of
sialic acid) and Asp-582 (that forms H-bonds with the
four OH-groups of sialic acid). Moreover, the four “Aspboxes” are found at aa positions 437-444, 570-577, 634641 and 707-714 (Figure 1).
The aa sequence of NanA from strain JF3703 differs
from that of JF4135 at 18 aa loci that do not affect catalytic domains or “Asp-boxes”. Amino acid similarities to
NanA were found with several clostridial sialidases (Figure 2). Most closely related is the sialidase from C. septicum with an aa homology of 79% and 82% identical
nucleotides at the gene level.
Sialidase activity and presence of nanA in C. chauvoei
strains

All seven C. chauvoei strains used (Table 1) contained
the nanA gene as revealed by PCR. Sequencing of the
amplicons revealed minor nucleotide changes that do
not affect however the size of expressed proteins. Monospecific polyclonal antibodies directed against the
recombinant 40 kDa peptide representing the CBM40
domain of NanA (Figure 1) reacted on standard immunoblots containing supernatants of C. chauvoei cultures
of all strains with a 150 kDa and to a lesser extent with
a 72 kDa band (Figure 3 shows the results for strains
JF3703 and JF4135). The latter band was somewhat
smaller than the predicted molecular mass of 81 kDa for
mature NanA calculated from the DNA sequence of the
nanA gene. When non-denaturing gels were used for
the immunoblots, only the 150 kDa band was detected
(Figure 3), indicating that the C. chauvoei sialidase is a
150 kDa dimer of the 72 kDa NanA polypeptide.
All strains were positive in the sialidase spot test,
showing the same spot diameter. Sialidase activity was
observed directly with bacterial colonies spotted onto
the filter, as well as with supernatant of C. chauvoei cultures grown in TGY medium (Figure 4), showing that
sialidase was secreted. Moreover, when part of the nanA
gene encoding the lectin-like sialic acid binding module
CBM40 and the enzymatically active domain, but not

kDa peptide serum under denaturing conditions (panel A) showing

CBM32, was cloned into plasmid pFastBac1 and transformed into E. coli strain DH5a, sialidase activity was
found in culture supernatant of the recombinant E. coli
strain harbouring the plasmid pFastbac1::nanA but not
in the E. coli control strain harbouring the empty vector
pFastBac1 only (not shown). Sialidase activity secreted
by all C. chauvoei strains used in this study and by
recombinant E. coli was neutralized by monospecific
polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit against the recombinant 40 kDa peptide (Figure 4 shows the results for
strain JF4135), showing the functional impact of the
CBM40 module covered by this peptide.
Similarly, the anti-sialidase 40 kDa peptide serum had
an inhibitory effect on the sialidase activity in culture
supernatants of C. chauvoei as determined by a kinetic
fluorimetric assay (Figure 5 shows the results for strain
JF4135). The assay monitored the cleavage of the glycosidic linkage of 100 μM of substrate MU-Neu5Ac upon
incubation at 37°C for 60 min with C. chauvoei culture
fluids. While the culture fluid of 5 × 107 cells was able
to release approximately 10 μM MU from the substrate,
anti-sialidase serum could inhibit this activity by 60%
when diluted 1:10 (Figure 5). Anti-sialidase serum
diluted 1:100 and 1:1000 inhibited the activity by 40%
and 20%, respectively. As expected, pre-immune serum
from the same rabbit, used as a control at different dilutions, did not affect the C. chauvoei culture fluid sialidase activity.

Discussion
Due to the rapid progression and severity of blackleg, it
is appropriate to assume that potent toxins are responsible for the rapid spread of C. chauvoei and for the
severe lesions that are produced by the pathogen in the
target tissues. It has previously been hypothesized that
sialidase may have an important role in blackleg by aiding the spread of the bacterium through the tissue [5].
Furthermore, sialidases from S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. canimorsus have been demonstrated to be
crucial for infection and colonization of the host
[16-19]. From these data, it can be hypothesized that

Figure 5 Fluorimetric determination of culture fluid sialidase activity. Cell-free supernatant of C. chauvoei strain JF4135 was pre-incubated
with different dilutions of anti-sialidase 40 kDa peptide serum or pre-immune serum from the same rabbit. Liberated 4-methylumbelliferone
(MU) obtained upon cleavage of substrate MU-Neu5Ac with sialidase in culture fluids of 5 × 107 C. chauvoei cells was recorded at 30 sec
intervals. Black circles, no pre-incubation with antibodies; white triangles, pre-incubation with pre-immune serum (diluted 1:10); squares, preincubation with anti-sialidase serum (white, diluted 1:1000; gray, diluted 1:100; black, diluted 1:10). Plots are the mean of three kinetic
measurements of sialidase activity.

the sialidase of C. chauvoei might have an important
role in the early stage of blackleg infection by degrading
tight junctions upon cleavage of sialic acid from mucins
and glycoproteins in the infected tissue. Cleavage of sialic acid results in decreased rigidity of the cell surface,
thereby facilitating cell motility and thus rendering the
target site vulnerable to massive attack by the pathogen
that rapidly spreads in the infected tissue. Then, the
production of toxins such as hyaluronidases (gammatoxins), deoxyribonucleases (beta-toxins) and oxygenlabile hemolysins by these bacteria may give rise to
necrosis of the infected muscles and alteration of vascular endothelium, both known as characteristic signs of
blackleg [5].

Sialidase activity of C. chauvoei was reported previously [21] but the corresponding enzyme was characterized only biochemically and not genetically [22,23].
Our genetic and biochemical data reveal a sialidase,
named NanA, in C. chauvoei that is a 150 kDa homodimer composed of two identical polypeptides of an
apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa. Differences between
the predicted size calculated from the nucleotide
sequence of nanA (81 kDa) and the apparent size
observed by SDS-PAGE (72 kDa) have previously been
reported for several bacterial sialidases, such as S. pneumoniae [43,44], Clostridium tertium [45] and C. septicum [46]. Native sialidase enzymes from bacteria are
described as multimers, mostly dimers, of polypeptides

Vilei et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:2
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/2

having molecular masses ranging between 50 and 80
kDa [45], which agrees with our data for the sialidase of
C. chauvoei. Although the 300 kDa sialidase described
by Heuermann et al. [22] might represent a multimer of
the 72 kDa NanA protein, we did not detect such a protein on our immunoblots. The sialidase NanA of C.
chauvoei is most closely related to the sialidase of C.
septicum and to NanJ and NanI of C. perfringens (Figure
2), the structures of which have been studied in detail
[8,10]. In this respect, it is interesting to note that C.
chauvoei and C. septicum are phylogenetically very closely related [47] and at one time were classified phenotypically as the same species [48].
The C. chauvoei sialidase NanA displays the same
motifs as the C. perfringens sialidase NanJ [10]. NanA
has a CBM32, or F5/8 type C domain, located at position 42 to 186, which is absent in C. perfringens NanI
[8,10]. This domain does not seem to be essential for
enzyme activity as demonstrated by the sialidase activity
of the recombinant NanA without CBM32. This is in
agreement with recent data that classify the CBM32
module as a special domain that is involved in binding
complex sialic acid substrates containing galactose residues [9,11]. The lectin-like sialic acid binding module
CBM40 and the enzymatic active domains show strong
similarities to NanI and NanJ of C. perfringens. The latter domain contains all the characteristic residues necessary for sialidase activity, as seen in all prokaryotic and
eukaryotic sialidases [11], including the catalytic arginine
triad with the RIP motif on the first of the three Arg
residues, and the characteristic “Asp-boxes”. Antibodies
directed against the recombinant 40 kDa peptide that
includes the entire CBM40 module and part of the
enzymatically active domain of NanA, in particular the
RIP motif (Figure 1), neutralized the secreted sialidase
activity of C. chauvoei strains (Figures 4 and 5), confirming their importance in sialidase activity. Furthermore, this result suggests that NanA is the sole or
predominant secreted sialidase of C. chauvoei. If other
sialidases antigenically similar to NanA were present in
C. chauvoei, supplementary protein bands would have
been detected on immunoblots using the same antiserum against the 40 kDa peptide, but no such additional sialidases were observed (Figure 3).
Since prevention of contact of ruminants with the
endospores of C. chauvoei that are present in the contaminated soil is virtually impossible, vaccination is the
only preventive measure to effectively control blackleg.
Current vaccination strategy against this disease relies
on the use of a suspension for injection containing formaldehyde-inactivated cultures of virulent strains of C.
chauvoei and culture supernatant, generally presented in
polyvalent formulations. These vaccines are efficient but
the particular antigens necessary to induce protective

Page 8 of 9

immunity against blackleg are unknown, thus requiring
expensive work-intensive animal models for potency
testing of vaccine batches. Moreover, molecular quality
control of current vaccines, design of novel vaccines and
diagnostic tests are mainly hampered by the lack of
basic knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of
pathogenicity of C. chauvoei. Studies on the role of sialidases of Streptococcus pneumoniae in otitis media in
children and of Propionibacterium acnes in acne vulgaris have shown that sialidases of these species induce
antibodies that inhibit propagation of bacteria in the
host tissues [17,49,50]. When challenged, chinchillas
vaccinated with recombinant sialidase from S. pneumoniae, expressed in E. coli, showed significantly reduced
colonization and middle ear invasion compared with
non-vaccinated individuals. Taken together, these findings in animal studies and the data of the present work,
whereby antibodies raised against the sialidase 40 kDa
peptide of C. chauvoei effectively neutralized the activity
of the infectious agent, indicate that sialidase of C.
chauvoei may be a good vaccine candidate to protect
ruminants against the pathogen and to prevent the
occurrence of blackleg. Furthermore, we expect that a
combination of this antigen with one or more polypeptides derived from the toxins produced by C. chauvoei
may have a potentiated protective effect against
blackleg.
