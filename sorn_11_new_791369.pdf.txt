Background
In Cambodia, the highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) A subtype H5N1 virus was detected for the first
time in January 2004. From 2004 to 2010, there have
been 26 outbreaks in poultry and 10 human cases
reported in the country but the origin of these epizootics remains unclear.
Methods
The phylogenetic relationships among the H5N1 strains
were reconstructed by neighbour-joining and Bayesians
methods. We analyzed the sequences of all 8 genomic
segments of 40 H5N1 Cambodian viruses together with
sequences from over 100 isolates from Southeast Asia
including Vietnam, Thailand and Laos.
Results
All viruses isolated in Cambodia since 2004 belong to
clade 1, genotype Z. Based on phylogenetic relationships, HPAI H5N1 virus was probably introduced from
Thailand in 2004. In 2005 and 2006, several sublineages
emerged in Cambodia and were probably the result of
multiple introductions of H5N1 virus from Vietnam
where similar strains were detected before outbreaks
occurred in Cambodia. Interestingly, in 2006, we
observed a north to south spread of the virus following
a main road. A new sublineage appeared in summer
2006. Since then, all viruses isolated in Cambodia and
South Vietnam clustered into this group, suggesting that
this sublineage became endemic in the Southern Indochina peninsula. Other clades which have been imported

to neighboring countries by migratory birds (i.e., clade
2.2) have not been detected in Cambodia.

Conclusion
Cambodia is essentially a poultry-importing country.
The first poultry deaths were observed in semi-industrial
farms that imported broiler and layer parental stocks
from a sister company in Thailand, where concomitant
outbreaks occurred. Then, multiple introductions of
H5N1 viruses most likely occurred through illegal trading in poultry from Vietnam. Our data suggest that the
clade 1 H5N1 virus is spreading essentially through
poultry trading, particularly along road transportation
routes. The role of the migratory birds appeared to be
at most limited to local or regional transmission.
The mechanisms described here would explain the
maintenance and extension of the H5N1 virus within
the Cambodia-South Vietnam regions for the last 6
years. This also highlights the persistent risk of H5N1
virus transmission in humans in the region while the
new H1N1 pandemic virus that affects millions of
humans is also frequently detected in pigs and shows a
dangerous propensity to recombine.
