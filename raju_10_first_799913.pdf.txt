Abstract
Background: Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp) is one of the major grain legume crops of the tropics and
subtropics, but biotic stresses [Fusarium wilt (FW), sterility mosaic disease (SMD), etc.] are serious challenges for
sustainable crop production. Modern genomic tools such as molecular markers and candidate genes associated
with resistance to these stresses offer the possibility of facilitating pigeonpea breeding for improving biotic stress
resistance. Availability of limited genomic resources, however, is a serious bottleneck to undertake molecular
breeding in pigeonpea to develop superior genotypes with enhanced resistance to above mentioned biotic
stresses. With an objective of enhancing genomic resources in pigeonpea, this study reports generation and
analysis of comprehensive resource of FW- and SMD- responsive expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
Results: A total of 16 cDNA libraries were constructed from four pigeonpea genotypes that are resistant and
susceptible to FW (’ICPL 20102’ and ‘ICP 2376’) and SMD (’ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’) and a total of 9,888 (9,468 high
quality) ESTs were generated and deposited in dbEST of GenBank under accession numbers GR463974 to
GR473857 and GR958228 to GR958231. Clustering and assembly analyses of these ESTs resulted into 4,557 unique
sequences (unigenes) including 697 contigs and 3,860 singletons. BLASTN analysis of 4,557 unigenes showed a
significant identity with ESTs of different legumes (23.2-60.3%), rice (28.3%), Arabidopsis (33.7%) and poplar (35.4%).
As expected, pigeonpea ESTs are more closely related to soybean (60.3%) and cowpea ESTs (43.6%) than other
plant ESTs. Similarly, BLASTX similarity results showed that only 1,603 (35.1%) out of 4,557 total unigenes
correspond to known proteins in the UniProt database (≤ 1E-08). Functional categorization of the annotated
unigenes sequences showed that 153 (3.3%) genes were involved in cellular component category, 132 (2.8%) in
biological process, and 132 (2.8%) in molecular function. Further, nineteen genes were identified differentially
expressed between FW- responsive genotypes and 20 between SMD- responsive genotypes. Generated ESTs were
compiled together with 908 ESTs available in public domain, at the time of analysis, and a set of 5,085 unigenes
were defined that were used for identification of molecular markers in pigeonpea. For instance, 3,583 simple
sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were identified in 1,365 unigenes and 383 primer pairs were designed. Assessment of
a set of 84 primer pairs on 40 elite pigeonpea lines showed polymorphism with 15 (28.8%) markers with an
average of four alleles per marker and an average polymorphic information content (PIC) value of 0.40. Similarly, in
silico mining of 133 contigs with ≥ 5 sequences detected 102 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 37
contigs. As an example, a set of 10 contigs were used for confirming in silico predicted SNPs in a set of four
genotypes using wet lab experiments. While occurrence of SNPs were confirmed for all the 6 contigs for which
scorable and sequenceable amplicons were generated. PCR amplicons were not obtained in case of 4 contigs.
Recognition sites for restriction enzymes were identified for 102 SNPs in 37 contigs that indicates possibility of
assaying SNPs in 37 genes using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) assay.

Conclusion: The pigeonpea EST dataset generated here provides a transcriptomic resource for gene discovery and
development of functional markers associated with biotic stress resistance. Sequence analyses of this dataset have
showed conservation of a considerable number of pigeonpea transcripts across legume and model plant species
analysed as well as some putative pigeonpea specific genes. Validation of identified biotic stress responsive genes
should provide candidate genes for allele mining as well as candidate markers for molecular breeding.

Background
Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp) is one of the
major grain legume crops of the tropical and subtropical
regions of the world [1]. It is the only cultivated food
crop of the Cajaninae sub-tribe and has a diploid genome with 11 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 2× = 22) and
a genome size estimated to be 858 Mbp [2]. The genus
Cajanus comprises 32 species most of which are found
in India, Australia and one is native to West Africa.
Pigeonpea is a major food legume crop in South Asia
and East Africa with India as the largest producer (3.5
Mha) followed by Myanmar (0.54 Mha) and Kenya (0.20
Mha) [3]. It plays an important role in food security,
balanced diet and alleviation of poverty because of its
diverse usages as a food; fodder and fuel wood [4]. Several abiotic (e.g. drought, salinity and water-logging) and
biotic (e.g. diseases like Fusarium wilt, sterility mosaic
and pod borer insects) stresses, are serious challenges
for sustainable pigeonpea production to meet the
demands of the resource poor people of several African
and Asian countries.
Fusarium wilt (FW) caused by Fusarium udum is an
important biotic constraint in pigeonpea production in
the Indian subcontinent, which results in 16-47% crop
losses [5]. The fungus enters the host vascular system at
the root tips through wounds or invasion made by
nematodes, leading to progressive chlorosis of leaves,
branches, wilting and collapse of the root system [6]. In
India alone, the loss due to this disease is estimated to
be US $71 million and the percentage of disease incidence varies from 5.3 to 22.6% [7].
Sterility mosaic disease (SMD) caused by pigeonpea
sterility mosaic virus (PPSMV) is one of the wide spread
diseases of pigeonpea, which is transmitted by an eriophyid mite (Aceria cajani Channabasavanna). The disease is characterized by the symptoms like bushy and
pale green appearance of plants followed by reduction
in size, increase in number of secondary and mosaic
mottling of leaves and finally partial or complete cessation of reproductive structures. Some parts of the plant
may show disease symptoms and other parts may
remain unaffected [8].
Due to the above mentioned factors combined with
limited water resources to the fields in the semi-arid
tropic regions, where the crop is grown, the productivity
has remained stagnant at around 0.7 t/ha during the

past two decades [1]. With the advent of genomic tools
such as molecular markers, genetic maps, etc., conventional plant breeding has been facilitated greatly and
improved genotypes/varieties with enhanced resistance/
tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses have been developed
in several crop species [9,10]. In case of pigeonpea, however, a very limited number of genomic tools are available so far [11,12]. For instance, 156 microsatellite or
simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers [13-16], 908
expressed sequence tags (ESTs), at the time of undertaking the study, were available in pigeonpea. For enhancing the genomic resources in pigeonpea, transcriptome
sequencing to generate ESTs should be a fast approach.
ESTs, which are generated by large-scale single pass
sequencing of randomly picked cDNA clones, have been
cost - effective and valuable resource for efficient and
rapid identification of novel genes and development of
molecular markers [17]. Further, ESTs have been
employed in bioinformatic analyses to identify the genes
that are differentially expressed in various tissues, cell
types, or developmental stages of the same or different
genotypes [18,19].
In view of above facts, this study was undertaken to
obtain a comprehensive resource of FW- and SMDresponsive ESTs in pigeonpea with the following objectives: (i) generation of FW- and SMD- responsive ESTs,
(ii) functional annotation of assembled unigenes, (iii) in
silico identification of putative FW- and SMD- responsive genes, and (iv) development of novel SSR and SNP
markers in pigeonpea.

Results
Root tissue is the site for Fusarium udum infection, the
causal fungal agent of Fusarium wilt in pigeonpea. With
an objective to evaluate the transcriptional responses
after infection of roots by F. udum, six unidirectional
cDNA libraries were constructed. These are from each
of FW- infected root tissues of resistant (’ICPL 20102’)
and susceptible (’ICP 2376’) genotypes at different stages
viz. 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 days after inoculation (DAI).
Infected roots were examined by light microscopy upon
harvest at different stages. The severity of wilt disease in
both susceptible and resistant genotype was observed in
longitudinal sections of stem and root vascular region at
15 and 30 DAI (Figure 1). Likewise for SMD, leaf tissue
is the specific site of infection and therefore leaf samples

of SMD infected genotypes, ‘ICP 7035’ (SMD resistant)
and ‘TTB 7’ (SMD susceptible) were harvested at 45 and
60 days after sowing (DAS). RNA was extracted and
consequently unidirectional cDNA libraries were constructed (see Additional file 1).
Generation of FW- and SMD- responsive ESTs

A total of 16 unidirectional cDNA libraries were constructed from all the four genotypes i.e. ‘ICPL 20102’
and ‘ICP 2376’; ‘ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’ which represent
parents of mapping population segregating for FW and
SMD, respectively. Using Sanger sequencing approach
3,168 ESTs were generated from root cDNA libraries of
‘ICPL 20102’ and 2,880 from ‘ICP 2376’. Similarly, 1,920
ESTs were generated from each leaf cDNA libraries of
SMD- responsive genotypes, ‘ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’.
Details of EST generation from different cDNA libraries
are given in Figure 2. In brief, a total of 9,888 ESTs
were generated and after stringent screening for shorter
(<100 bp) and poorer quality sequences, 9,468 high
quality ESTs were obtained, with an average varied-read
length of 514 bp (Figure 2). All EST sequences were
deposited in the dbEST of GenBank under accession
numbers GR463974 to GR473857 and GR958228 to
GR958231.
Pigeonpea EST assembly

With an objective to minimize redundancy, clustering
and assembly was done for different EST datasets to
define unigenes for (a) FW-responsive ESTs, (b) SMD-

responsive ESTs, (c) FW- and SMD-responsive ESTs,
and (d) the entire set of pigeonpea ESTs including those
from the public domain. These unigene (UG) sets were
referred to as UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV, respectively. The UG-I comprised of 3,316 unigenes with 389
contigs and 2,927 singletons by clustering of 5,680 high
quality ESTs. Similarly, for UG-II, clustering of 3,788
high quality sequences resulted in 1,308 unigenes (328
contigs and 980 singletons). Based on clustering of all
the 9,468 high quality sequences generated in this study,
the UG-III was defined with 4,557 unigenes (697 contigs
and 3,860 singletons). The cluster analysis of 908 ESTs
available in the public domain along with 9,468 pigeonpea ESTs resulted in UG-IV that included 5,085 unigenes with 871 contigs and 4,214 singletons. The
number of ESTs in a contig ranged from 2 to 573, with
an average of 7 ESTs per contig. As expected, contigs
with two EST members exhibited a higher percentage
(46.7%) than contigs with three or more EST members
(Figure 3).
Comparison of pigeonpea unigenes with other plant EST
databases

All the four sets of unigenes i.e. UG-I, UG-II, UG-III
and UG-IV were analyzed for BLASTN similarity
search against available EST datasets of legume species
namely chickpea (Cicer arietinum), pigeonpea (Cajanus
cajan), soybean (Glycine max), Medicago (Medicago
truncatula), Lotus (Lotus japonicus), common bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris) and three model plant species

namely Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza
sativa) and poplar (Populus alba). An E-value significant threshold of ≤ 1E-05 was used for defining a hit.
Detailed results of BLASTN analyses for all the four
unigenes sets are given in Table 1. For instance, analysis of UG-III found highest identity of 60.3% with soybean, followed by cowpea (43.6%), Medicago (43.0%),
common bean (42.2%), Lotus (37.2%), and the least
identity with chickpea (23.2%). Comparative BLASTN
analysis of pigeonpea unigenes with EST databases of
model plant species showed, high identity with poplar
(35.4%), followed by Arabidopsis (33.7%) and the least
similarity with rice (28.3%). Of 4,557 unigenes, 2,839
(62.2%) showed significant identity with ESTs of at
least one plant species analysed, while 227 (4.9%)

showed significant identity across all the plant EST
databases in this study. It is also interesting to note
that 39 unigenes did not show any homology with the
legume species examined.
To identify the putative function of all the unigenes
compiled in this study, the unigenes from all the four
sets (UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV) were compared
against the non-redundant UniProt database, using the
BLASTX algorithm. At a significant threshold of ≤ 1E08, 1,005 (30.30%) of UG-I, 638 (48.77%) of UG-II,
1,603 (35.17%) of UG-III and 1,777 (34.94%) of UG-IV
unigenes showed significant similarity with known proteins (Figure 4). Details of BLASTX and BLASTN analyses against UniProt database for all four unigene sets
are provided in Additional files 2, 3, 4 and 5.

Figure 4 BLASTX analysis of pigeonpea unigenes against UniProt database. BLASTX homology search was performed for all the four
unigene groups (UG-I, UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV) against the non-redundant UniProt database. The values against each bar represent total number
of unigenes, total number of hits, significant hits at ≤ 1E-08 and no hits for each unigene set.

Functional categorization of pigeonpea unigenes

The unigenes from all the four sets that showed a significant hit (≤ 1E-08) against the UniProt database were
further categorized into functional categories. As a
result, 640 (63.6%) of UG-I, 448 (70.2%) of UG-II, 997
(62.1%) of UG-III and 1,119 (62.9%) of UG-IV unigenes
were successfully annotated into three principal GO
categories i.e. biological process, molecular function and
cellular component. Like in earlier studies of this nature,
it was observed that one gene could be assigned to more
than one principal category, thus the total number of
GO mappings from each category exceeded the number
of unigenes analyzed. Details on full list of gene annotation for significant hits of four unigene sets are given in
Additional file 6, 7, 8 and 9. For instance, of 1,603
(35.1%) unigenes of UG-III, only 997 (21.8%) were
assigned to three principle categories. As a result, a total
of 132 were grouped under biological process, 132
under molecular function and 153 under cellular component (Figure 5). Under the biological process category,
cellular process accounted to 101, followed by metabolic
process (82), biological regulation (32) and response to
stimulus (21). In the cellular component category, 160
unigenes coded for cell part, 112 to organelle, and 70 to
organelle part. In the last category of molecular function, majority of the unigenes were involved in binding
(95) and catalytic activity (44). The remaining 606
unigenes which could not be classified into any of the
three GO categories were grouped as “unclassified”. The
distribution of unigenes (UG-III) along with corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) categories are provided in
Additional file 10. Based on GO annotation, enzyme
commission IDs were also retrieved from the UniProt

database to get an overview of unigenes (UG-III) putatively annotated to be enzymes. The major group of unigenes are included under oxidoreductases (107) followed
by transferases (91), hydrolases (90), lyases (36), ligases
(21) and isomerases (18). Similar patterns of distribution
were observed in all the remaining Unigene sets.
In silico expression analysis

The identification of differentially expressed genes
among specific cDNA libraries of FW- and SMDresponsive genotypes based on EST counts in each contig was done using a web statistical tool IDEG.6. As a
result, 19 genes were identified to be differentially
expressed between ‘ICPL 20102’ (FW- resistant) and
‘ICP 2376’ (FW-susceptible) genotypes, similarly, 20
genes were differentially expressed between ‘ICP 7035’
(SMD- resistant) and ‘TTB 7’ (SMD- susceptible) genotypes (Figure 6 and 7).
To assess the relatedness of each library and expressed
genes in terms of expression pattern, a cluster analysis
on the basis of EST abundance in each contig was
performed [20]. Of the 697 contigs (UG-III), that were
subjected to R-statistics [21] only 71 contigs were normalized with a true positive significance (R>8) and were
eventually subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis
(Additional file 11). The correlated gene expression pattern of all normalized 71 contigs/genes is displayed in
Figure 8. All the 12 FW- derived libraries were grouped
into a single cluster, while all the four SMD- challenged
libraries were grouped into another cluster. About 49
genes were highly expressed in SMD- challenged
libraries than in FW- challenged libraries and can be
attributed to high accumulation of defence proteins

during SMD infection. In the cluster of FW- challenged
libraries, the ‘ICPL 20102’-30 DAI library was distantly
placed between FW- susceptible challenged libraries
‘ICP 2376’ - 6 DAI and ‘ICP 2376’ - 30 DAI. Each cluster represents a different pattern of gene expression as
shown in Figure 8. Based on the clustering pattern and
library specificity, Clusters I and IV were further divided
into sub-clusters (represented in different colour bars).
The above results indicated that the pattern and percentage of genes expression varied according to severity of
the stress in specific library.
In Cluster I, 11.3% (8) of total genes were grouped and
further sub divided into two groups with each sharing
2.8% (2) and 8.5% (6) genes, respectively. Similarly, Cluster II and Cluster III accounted for 4.2% (3) and 15.5%
(11) genes and the largest Cluster IV, included 69.0%
(49) of total genes with three sub groups IVa, IVb and
IVc each sharing 14.0% (10), 10% (7) and 45% (32) of
genes, respectively. Cluster analysis also showed high
level expression of genes related to chloroplast/photosystem related proteins (22.5%), developmental proteins
(19.7%), cellular proteins (15.4%), metabolic proteins
(14.0%), defence/stimulus responsive proteins (4.3%),
protein specific binding proteins (2.8%) and few uncharacterized proteins (19.8%).

Marker discovery

EST based markers can assay the functional genetic variation compared to other class of genetic markers and
hence were targeted for marker development [22]. The
unigene set based on generated ESTs in this study as
well as the ones available in public domain was used for
development of simple sequence repeats (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.
Identification and development of genic microsatellite
markers

The entire set of 5,085 pigeonpea unigenes derived from
UG-IV was used to identify the SSRs using MISA

SSRs were identified at the frequency of 1/800 bp in
coding regions (Table 2). 698 ESTs contained more than
one SSR and 1,729 SSRs were found as compound SSRs.
In terms of distribution of different classes of SSRs i.e.
mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide
repeats, mononucleotide SSRs contributed to the largest
proportion (3,498, 97.6%). Only a limited number of
SSRs of other classes were found. For instance, di- and
tri- nucleotide SSRs accounted for 40 (1.1%) and 33
(0.9%) respectively. On the other hand, 9 tetrameric, 2
pentameric and 1 hexameric microsatellites were present
(Figure 9). While using the criteria for Class I (> 20

and Kantety and colleagues [25], on all SSRs 641 SSRs
represented Class I while 2,942 SSRs represented Class
II (Table 2).
In general, mononucleotide SSRs are not included for
primer designing and synthesis. However, as only a very
limited number of SSR markers are currently available
for pigeonpea in public domain and in a separate study
some mononucleotide SSRs were found polymorphic
[15], primer pairs were designed for 383 SSRs including
mononucleotide SSRs. A total of 94 primer pairs were
considered for validation after excluding the primers for
monomeric SSR motifs and compound SSRs with mononucleotide repeats. However based on repeat number
criteria, such as 5 minimum for di-, tri-, tetra-, pentanucleotides, primer pairs were synthesized for 84 SSRs.
The details of newly developed pigeonpea EST-SSR primers along with corresponding SSR motif, primer
sequence, annealing temperature and product size are
provided in Additional file 12.
Newly synthesized 84 markers were analyzed on 40
elite pigeonpea genotypes (Additional file 13). As a

result, 52 (61.9%) primer pairs provided scorable amplified products and 26 primer pairs produced a number
of faint bands indicative of non-specific amplifications.
A total of 15 (28.8%) markers showed polymorphism
with 2-7 alleles with an average of 4 alleles per marker
in genotypes examined. These markers showed a moderate PIC value ranging from 0.20 to 0.70 with an average
of 0.40 (Table 3). To evaluate the genetic variability
within a diverse collection of pigeonpea accessions
which are parents of different mapping populations segregating for important agronomic traits and also to
determine genetic relationship among them, phylogenetic analysis on the basis of dissimilarities was performed using NTSYS software package. The UPGMA
cluster diagram showed clear segregation of wild and
cultivated species (Figure 10).
SNP discovery and identification of CAPS markers

SNPs are an important class of molecular markers
which are becoming more popular in recent times. To
enhance the reliability of SNPs identification, the SNP
which occurred in a contig ≥ 5 ESTs from more than
one genotype was considered. In silico analysis showed a
total of 102 SNPs in 37 (27,659 bp) contigs with a

frequency of 1/271 bp (Table 4). With an objective of
validating these in silico identified SNPs, as an example,
10 contigs were used to generate PCR amplicons and
sequence four genotypes namely ‘ICPL 20102’, ‘ICP
2376’, ‘ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’. While a scorable and
sequenceable amplicon was obtained in case of 6 contigs
(contig 210, contig 433, contig 535, contig 555, contig
620 and contig 718), the scorable amplicons were not
obtained in case of four contigs (contig 67, contig 330,
contig 587 and contig 632). Sequencing of amplicons for
all the four genotypes for all the six contigs showed
occurrence of SNPs as predicted in silico (Additional file
14). For instance, for contig 433, a comparison of the
amplified DNA sequences for four genotypes (’ICPL
20102’, ‘ICP 2376’, ‘ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’) with the 5
EST sequences coming from two genotypes (’ICP 7035’
and ‘TTB 7’) showed the occurrence of the same SNP G
to C between ‘ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’ (Figure 11).
In order to perform cost-effective and robust genotyping
assay for the detected 102 SNPs in 37 contigs, efforts
were made to identify the restriction enzymes that can

be used to assay SNPs via cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) assay. Results indicated that
SNPs present in 37 contigs can be evaluated by using
CAPS assay (Table 4).

Discussion
Plants are known to have developed integrated defence
mechanisms against fungal and viral infections by altering spatial and temporal transcriptional changes. The
EST approach was successfully utilized in identification
of disease-responsive genes from various tissues and
growth stages in chickpea [26], Lathyrus [27], soybean
[28], rice [29] and ginseng [30]. Many earlier studies
have shown that resistant genotypes have efficient
mechanisms for stress perception and enhanced expression of defence-responsive genes, which maintain cellular survival and recovery [31]. Hence, the present study
was undertaken to identify catalog of defence related
genes in response to FW and SMD infection in pigeonpea by generating ESTs from different stress challenged
tissues at various time intervals.

Generation of cDNA libraries and unigene assemblies

Roots provide a structural and physiological support for
plant interactions with the soil environment by conducting transport of water, ions and nutrients. Plants are
encountered with many biotic stress factors which
includes bacterial, fungal and viral infection. Roots and
leaves are the primary sites of infection by these organisms. Therefore, a total of 16 cDNA libraries were generated at different time intervals to specifically target the
roots infected with Fusarium udum and leaves infected
with SMD. In total 5,680 high quality ESTs were generated from FW- and similarly 3,788 high quality ESTs
from SMD- challenged genotypes. Earlier, at the time of

analysis in November 2008, the public domain consisted
of only 908 ESTs for pigeonpea. Thus the present study
contributes approximately 10-fold increase in the
pigeonpea EST resource and an addition of 4,557
pigeonpea unigenes (UG-III).
Functional annotation of pigeonpea unigenes

Homology searches (BLASTN and BLASTX) against
other plant ESTs and functional characterization was
done for all the defined unigene datasets (UG-I, UG-II,
UG-III and UG-IV). Of the 5,085 unigenes (UG-IV)
assembled from all the pigeonpea ESTs, 3,280 (64.5%)
had significant identity with ESTs of at least one plant

species analyzed, 299 (5.8%) unigenes showed significant
identity with ESTs of all analyzed plant species in the
study, while 41 (0.8%) were found to be novel to pigeonpea. A high significant identity was observed with soybean (56.3%), and the least percentage of similarity was
observed with chickpea (22.7%) (Table 1). A similar
BLASTN results were observed for the remaining three
unigenes sets (UG-I, UG-II and UG-III) against the
ESTs of plant species surveyed. Comparative analysis of
newly defined UG-III dataset (4,557) with 908 public
domain pigeonpea ESTs showed that only 508 (11.1%)
shared identity and indicated that our EST sequencing
study identified 4,049 (88.9%) new set of pigeonpea unigenes. Relatively, very low similarity of 36.5% with Lotus
and 42.3% with Medicago was observed compared to
soybean and cowpea than other legume species. These
observations are in accordance with phylogenetic relationships of legumes [32].
The pigeonpea ESTs showed higher similarity to
legume ESTs databases (22.7-56.3%) of the legume

species than monocot species (27.3-33.4%). Comparative
analysis of pigeonpea ESTs with monocot species like
rice (27.3%) showed that the percentage of significance
is much lower compared to any other legume species,
inspite of larger EST repository. This is clearly attributed to phylogenetic divergence between dicots and
monocots in course of evolution. These comparisons
also indicate that several unigenes that were absent in
analysed non-legumes but present in all legume species
may be specifically confined to legumes.
BLASTX analyses indicated that those ESTs without
significant identity to any other protein sequences in the
existing database may be novel and involved in plant
defence responses. Hence, this novel EST collection
represented a significant addition to the existing pigeonpea EST resources and provides valuable information
for further predictions/validation of gene functions in
pigeonpea.
A comprehensive comparison of functionally categorized unigenes of all the four unigenes data sets (UG-I,
UG-II, UG-III and UG-IV) showed a similar distribution. A large number of unigenes were involved in cell
part, organelle, binding, organelle part, metabolic and
cellular process among the significantly annotated ones.
These observations are consistent with the earlier
reported functional categorization studies in rice [29],
soybean [33], barley [34] and tall fescue [35]. However,
the sequences encoding activities related to categories
such as biological regulation and response to stimulus
are 28 and 20 incase of FW-responsive ESTs compared
to 0 and 2 in case of SMD-responsive ESTs. This was
possibly due to the fact that the ESTs generated from
FW- challenged root libraries were most abundantly
involved in stimulus to pathogenesis and ESTs derived
from SMD stress are chloroplast binding proteins. Earlier studies such as Lee and colleagues [36], Ablett and
colleagues [37], also reported that photosynthesis-related
proteins were the most prevalent from aerial parts of
the plant, which would help to make energy related
activities such as cell division, growth, elongation and
development. Similarly in this study, photosynthesis
related genes were identified in larger proportion (30%)
in SMD-responsive cDNA libraries derived from leaf
tissues.
In silico differential gene expression

The invasion of pathogen not only results in expression
of novel genes/transcripts, but also in altering the abundances of different ESTs resulting in induction or
repression. This was evident from differential expression
of 19 genes between FW-responsive genotypes and 20
genes between SMD-responsive genotypes. It is however,
important to mention that in silico method of gene
expression is not the ideal method to identity the

differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, as large
scale EST data were generated from FW- responsive
and SMD- responsive genotypes, an effort like some
earlier studies [18-21,34] was made to identify some
putative genes differentially expressed in FW- and
SMD- resistant and sensitive genotypes. Validation of
these candidate genes by Northern analysis or real-time
quantitative PCR analysis is essential before these candidate genes are deployed in some other studies.
Significant number of unigene sequences related to
proteins like kinases, phosphatases, peroxidases, ribonucleases, endochitinases, glucanases and hormones like
Abscisic acid responsive (ABA) genes were identified to

be differentially expressed and are known to play a vital
role in defence mechanism. For example, the cell wall
degrading enzymes like endochitinases (EC: 3.2.1.14)
implicate a major defence mechanism against pathogen
[27]. Similarly, kinases play a major role in the plant’s
recognition to pathogen [38,39]. For instance, chitinase
protein (UniProt ID: P23472), a class of pathogenesis
related (PR) proteins with bi-functional role in lysozyme/chitinase activity involved in random hydrolysation of N-aetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide-beta linkages in
chitin and chitodextrins during systemic acquired resistance (SAR), was expressed at higher concentrations in
FW-responsive resistant genotype (’ICPL 20102’) compared to susceptible genotype (’ICP 2376’). The high
expression levels of chitinase in resistant genotype indicate the effectiveness within a narrow range of pathogenesis [40,41].
Similarly, the protein coding for ABA-responsive protein (ABR18) (UniProt ID: Q06930), which is involved
in stimulus mechanism and cell localization etc. during
plant development and one of the vital roles is in
defence mechanism during biotic stress signaling. This
gene was identified to be expressed relatively higher in

SMD-resistant pigeonpea genotype ‘ICP 7035’ compared
to the susceptible genotype ‘TTB 7’. During pathogen
infection ABA inhibits the transcription of a basic b-1,
3-glucanase (EC: 3.2.1.39) that can degrade the b-1, 3glucan callose, forming a physical barrier to viral spread
through plasmodesmata. This down regulation of b-1, 3glucanase by ABA can be termed as a resistance factor
in plant pathogen interactions [42]. In our study, significant expression signals were observed in SMD resistant
genotype ‘ICP 7035’ during viral infection. This positive
correlation between the ABA levels and disease resistance was reported in plant species like common bean
[43], rice [44] and tobacco [45]. Different enzymes like
methyltransferases (HMT3) (UniProt ID: Q8LAX0) and
dehydrogenases (G3PC) (UniProt ID: P34921) are putatively involved in synthesis of lignin in cell walls. These
enzymes also play a major role in defence against pathogen interaction [46,47].
An in silico hierarchical clustering analysis of 71 differentially expressed and genes across 16 cDNA libraries
using HCE V 2.0 was done to infer potential relation
between the co-expressed genes. The profiles of some of
the interesting gene families and genes that could play
an important role in stress stimulus were explained.
In Cluster I, of the 8 contigs, 6 were identified to be
highly expressed in FW- challenged libraries of susceptible genotype. The cluster includes genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stability,
Na+/H+ exchanger and a few uncharacterized proteins.
The sub cluster Ia includes two ESTs, which are highly
expressed in ‘ICPL 20102’ libraries (15 DAI and 25
DAI). The genes connected in sub cluster Ib are highly
expressed in ‘ICP 2376’ libraries (6 DAI and 15 DAI).
One of the putative proteins TAR1 (Transcript Antisense to Ribosomal RNA), a mitochondrial protein is
known to be involved in regulation and respiratory

metabolism. Over- expression of this protein suppresses
the respiration-deficient petite phenotype of a point
mutation in mitochondrial RNA polymerase that affects
mitochondrial gene expression and mtDNA stability.
This dysfunction of mitochondria might occur in
response to biotic or abiotic stress [48]. The overexpression of these genes was observed only in 15 DAI
libraries of both the FW- responsive genotypes. And
their immediate disappearance in the later stages of
infection in resistant genotype libraries and continued
expression in susceptible genotypes supports a hypothesis that continual expression of this protein may lead
to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell
degeneracy.
Another protein Na + /H + exchanger 7 (UniProt ID:
Q8BLV3) is an ubiquitous ion transporter that serves
multiple cell physiological processes such as intracellular
pH homeostasis and electro neutral exchange of protons
for Na + and K + across endomembranes. Biochemical
studies suggest that Na+/H+ exchangers in the plasma
membrane of plant cells contribute to cellular sodium
homeostasis during salt stress, although the above protein is expressed in high salt stressed plants, it may also
be expressed during biotic stress. Its high expression in
susceptible genotype ‘ICPL 2376’ at 6 and 15 DAI
libraries shows the severity of stress during fungal
pathogenesis. And in the remaining FW- and SMDchallenged libraries this shows normal expression.
Cluster II genes include hevamine (EC: 3.2.1.14) and
Leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (EC: 1.14.11.19) specifically expressed in ‘ICPL 20102’ 30 DAI library. The
important protein hevamine represents a new class of
polysaccharide-hydrolyzing (ba)8 barrel enzyme belonging to families of plant chitinases and lysozymes, which
are vital for plant defence against pathogenic bacteria
and fungi. Recent results indicate that these enzymes

Raju et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/45

may be involved not only in defence-related process or
general stress response but also in growth and development processes [49]. The high expression of these proteins in the late phase of Fusarium infection indicates
their prolonged defensive role against fungal
pathogenesis.
The genes connected in Cluster III are highly
expressed in FW-challenged ‘ICP 2376’ - 25 and 30 DAI
libraries. The genes related to endoprotease activity,
beta-glucan synthesis, carboxypeptidases, alkaloid biosynthesis, secologanin biosynthesis, beta-galactosidase
activity, microtubule-stabilizing activity, nucleic acid
binding protein, ribonucleoprotein and a few uncharacterized proteins were constituted in this cluster. For
instance, antifungal class proteins such as betaglucanases (EC: 3.2.1.39) and Hansenula mrakii killer
toxin-resistant proteins (UniProt ID: P41809) located in
epidermal leaf cells are believed to be involved in cell
differentiation and defence against fungal pathogens
[50]. Plants deficient in these enzymes generated by
antisense transformation showed markedly reduced
resistance to viral and fungal infection. Similarly,
another class of proteins carboxypeptidases (EC: 3.4.16 3.4.18) with diverse functions ranging from catabolism
to regulating biological processes, including function as
a defence against pathogen attack [51].
The majority of genes (49) segregated in Cluster IV
were highly expressed in SMD-responsive cDNA
libraries derived from leaf tissues. In total Cluster IV
genes showed high gene expression in SMD derived
libraries. As expected, photosynthesis related transcripts
were abundantly represented in sub clusters IVa, IVb
and IVc, and these include putative transcripts like ribosomal proteins, mitochondrial proteins, chloroplast precursor proteins, photosystem I and II reaction centre
proteins. The observed expression pattern of photosynthesis related proteins in this study is also consistent
with experimental observations in barley [34].
Overall, the differentially expressed genes are involved
in diverse pathways, displaying complex expression patterns. The different clusters based on monitoring of
gene expression patterns propose that various pathways
in response to biotic stress exist in pigeonpea and their
interaction can lead to differential stress tolerance. The
uncharacterized class of transcripts co-expressed could
be repository of novel proteins and further characterization of these may reveal their significant role in plant
stress responses [52].
Development of functional markers

One of our primary goals of our research programme is
to develop molecular markers based on expressed
sequences and screen them for polymorphism. During
the last decade, microsatellites or SSRs have proven to

Page 15 of 22

be useful markers in plant genetic research and have
been used for marker-assisted breeding purposes. The
presence of SSRs in the coding region suggests their
importance as functional or gene based markers
[1,11,53]. Unfortunately, development of microsatellite
markers is expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming if they are being developed from genomic libraries
[54]. The data mining of microsatellites markers from
EST data can be a cost effective option. The cost of
mining EST libraries is far lower than other traditional
methods, and SSR development from ESTs has been
successful in EST data mining [22,23,53-56]. SSR motifs
with repeats more than eight for di-nucleotides, six for
tri-nucleotides, and five for tetra-nucleotides were considered. Dimeric repeat motifs (40) were relatively abundant than trimeric repeats (33). In addition to this,
tetra-, penta- and hexameric repeat motifs were considerably less represented. A total of 94 SSR markers have
been synthesized and characterized for polymorphism
survey. However, there are some distant contrasts in frequency and distribution of SSRs in ESTs and in genomic
survey sequences (GSSs). In general di-nucleotide SSRs
of all repeat lengths are more common in GSSs and trinucleotide SSRs are common in the ESTs [22,23,56,57].
As against these reports, in our findings we observed
that di-nucleotide repeats are more abundant than trinucleotide repeat motifs [58,59]. However this observation is not unexpected as the frequency and distribution
of SSR depends on several factors such as size of dataset, tools and criteria used for SSR discovery [22].
In this study, a total of 15 polymorphic EST-SSRs primer pairs were validated and used for diversity study on
forty pigeonpea genotypes representing 32 cultivated
(C. cajan) and 8 wild species (six C. scarabaeoides and
two C. platycarpus). All markers detected at least one
allele in all genotypes tested, suggesting transferability of
all markers across the Cajanus genus. In addition to
high transferability, EST-SSRs are good candidates for
the development of conserved orthologous sequence
(COS) markers for genetic analysis and breeding of different species [10]. However, EST-SSRs were reported
to be less polymorphic than genomic SSRs in crop
plants due to greater DNA sequence conservation in
transcribed regions [22,60]. For instance, the 15 SSR loci
provided only 60 alleles with an average of 4 alleles per
loci and an average 0.43 PIC value. Similar kind of
diversity features were observed in earlier SSR based
diversity studies in pigeonpea [14,15].
EST-SSR profiles obtained on 40 pigeonpea genotypes
were used to compute pair-wise genetic distances
among different genotypes to construct a dendrogram
based UPGMA clustering. The neighbor joining tree
grouped 40 pigeonpea genotypes into three major clusters (Figure 10). The Cluster I comprising 32 genotypes

Raju et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/45

(cultivated) is the largest cluster followed by Cluster III
containing six wild genotypes (C. scarabaeoides) and
Cluster II is the smallest cluster with two wild genotypes
belonging to C. platycarpus species revealing clear segregation of the cultivated and the wild species. Less
genetic variation was detected with in cultivated species,
with only nine markers detecting polymorphism and a
total of 35 alleles. The low genetic variability amongst
cultivars when compared with the wild species genotypes suggests that natural and artificial selection has
contributed to the selection of specific alleles and to
changes of allelic frequencies at specific loci as reported
by Odeny and colleagues [14]. The distinctness of
C. platycarpus with C. scarabaeoides accessions
observed in this study correlate well with earlier studies
[61]. It is also important to note that ‘ICPL 20097’ and
‘ICP 2376’ genotypes were found closely related with
high genetic similarity as both of these genotypes belong
to the same geographic region. In conclusion, EST-SSR
markers developed in this study complement the currently available or ongoing efforts on development of
genomic SSRs that will be a valuable resource for linkage map development and marker assisted selection in
pigeonpea [12].
SNPs and indels are an essentially inexhaustible
resource of polymorphic markers for use in the highresolution genetic map development of traits and for
association studies. Although a variety of molecular
markers are available SNPs are comparatively advantageous because of their abundance and amenability to
high throughput approaches [62]. In addition, SNPs also
offer several advantages like high-throughput and costeffective genotyping [63] and identification of functional/gene-based markers for complex trait through
linkage map development or association genetics
[9,10,64,65]. Although SNP discovery was a cost effective task in past, advances in next generation sequencing
technologies have made SNP discovery cheaper and faster [66]. However in case for a given species, ESTs are
available from more than one genotype, in silico mining
of ESTs is still a very inexpensive and fast approach for
SNP discovery [17,64] and therefore we used this
approach for mining SNPs in this study.
By using in silico mining approach in a total of 871
contigs coming from 10,376 ESTs (9,888 generated in
this study and 908 available in public domain), a total of
102 potential SNPs were identified in 37 contigs that
were consisted of ≥ 5 ESTs. Smaller contigs were not
considered for SNP mining as these contigs are prone to
errors due to lack of read depth as reported by Wang
and colleagues [67]. Sequence analysis of PCR products
for a subset of 6 out of 10 contigs confirmed the occurrence of SNPs in all the cases. As PCR products could
not be generated for remaining four contigs, the

Page 16 of 22

presence of SNPs could not be confirmed in those
cases. Furthermore, as SNP genotyping is another
important criteria in breeding programmes, identification of CAPS markers for 37 contigs will facilitate SNP
genotyping even in low tech laboratories [63].

Conclusion
This study has contributed a new and significant set of
9,888 ESTs that together with 908 public domain ESTs
provides a unigene set of 5,085 sequences for pigeonpea.
Detailed analysis of these datasets have provided several
important features of pigeonpea transcriptome such as
conserved genes (across legumes and model plant species) as well as possible pigeonpea specific genes, assignment of pigeonpea genes to different GO categories,
identification of differentially expressed genes in
response to FW- and SMD- stresses, etc. In terms of
applied aspect of developed resource in breeding, this
study has demonstrated development and application of
gene-based molecular markers i.e SSRs, SNPs and
CAPS. In summary, it is anticipated that this study is a
significant contribution to enhance genomic resources
in a so called orphan legume crop that will eventually
impact pigeonpea breeding [11,12].
Methods
Plant material

Four pigeonpea genotypes namely ‘ICPL 20102’ (FWresistant), ‘ICP 2376’ (FW- susceptible), ‘ICP 7035’
(resistant to SMD) and ‘TTB 7’ (highly susceptible to
SMD) were used for constructing the cDNA libraries
and generating the ESTs. Seeds of two genotypes (’ICPL
20102’, ‘ICP 2376’) were procured from Legume Pathology section at ICRISAT and for the remaining two
genotypes (’ICP 7035’ and ‘TTB 7’) were obtained from
Dr. M Byregowda, University of Agricultural Sciences,
Bangalore, India.
A total of 40 genotypes including 32 genotypes from
cultivated species (C. cajan) and 8 genotypes from 2 wild
species (C. platycarpus and C. scarabaeoides) were used
for validation and diversity analysis with new set of ESTSSR markers. These genotypes were obtained from
Pigeonpea Breeding (Dr. KB Saxena) and Genebank (Dr.
HD Upadhyaya) and have been listed in Additional file 13.
Inoculation treatment for FW and SMD

Seeds of FW-tolerant (’ICPL 20102’) and FW-susceptible
(’ICP 2376’) were germinated in 15-inch deep polythene
covers filled with sterile soil and sand (1:1) in a glass
house at 23 ± 3°C under 80% relative humidity. The
root, being the primary target of the pathogen Fusarium
udum and the possible site of the initial defence
response, was selected as the tissue of study. Ten days
old seedlings were uprooted from pots and the root

Raju et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/45

system was thoroughly washed in running tap water and
rinsed with distilled water. Seedlings of each genotype
were inoculated by immersing the roots for 2 min in
fungal inoculum (Fusarium udum culture). The spore
suspension at 6 × 105 conidia/ml, was made by adding
fungal spores from several culture plates (Fusarium was
grown on potato dextrose media supplemented with
0.25 μg/ml tetracycline). Immediately following the
inoculation, the seedlings were transplanted to sterilized
sand and soil mixture (1:1) in pots and were transferred
to glass house.
In order to capture the genes expressed in resistant
and susceptible genotypes at different time periods after
inoculation, six stages i.e. 6, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days
after inoculation (DAI) were selected arbitrarily to construct the cDNA libraries. From 6-15 DAI, chlorosis
symptoms were observed on the leaves and aerial parts
of plant material, indicated the severity of Fusarium wilt
disease. Furthermore, from each stage of days after
inoculation, shoot and root section cuttings were made
and observed the fungal penetration into the vascular
tissues. Based on microscopic observations at different
stages, initial symptoms of fungal infection were noticed
in root vascular tissue at 15 and 20 DAI stages. Beyond
20 DAI, though the fungus penetrates deeper into the
vascular tissues of susceptible and resistant varieties to
some extent, the susceptible variety shows complete
Fusarium symptoms where as the resistant variety prevents most of the attacking fungus from reaching
maturity and developing symptoms.
For SMD study, highly susceptible (’TTB 7’) and resistant (’ICP 7035’) pigeonpea genotypes that are parents
of a mapping population segregating for resistance to
SMD were chosen. Forty seeds from each accession
were sown in plastic bags filled with sterilized soil and
were maintained in a glass house under optimal physiological conditions as described above. Ten days after
sowing, the aerial parts of the seedlings were stapled
with mosaic virus infected leaves. The viral disease is
caused by pigeonpea sterility mosaic virus (PPSMV) and
transmitted by an eriophyid mite Aceria cajani Channabasavanna [7]. The disease slowly spreads into the vascular tissues from the aerial parts through mite
population which is characterized by a bushy and pale
green appearance of plants. Based on the severity of disease symptoms, leaves with visible SMD lesions were
harvested at 45 and 60 days after sowing (DAS) stages
for construction of cDNA libraries.
cDNA library construction

Root and leaf tissue samples were collected from FWand SMD- responsive genotypes at different time-points
till the infection stage reached stagnant phase. RNA was
isolated from the above two tissue samples according to

Page 17 of 22

the protocol described by Schmitt and colleagues [68].
RNA quality was assessed using formamide gel electrophoresis and poly (A)+ RNA was isolated with poly (A)
tract mRNA isolation system IV (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) as described by the manufacturers. Doublestrand cDNA was constructed using Super SMART ™
PCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Clontech®, Mountain View,
CA, USA) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting cDNA was size fractioned on 1.2%
agarose gel. cDNA fractions containing fragments
greater than 500 bp were selected for library construction. Subsequently, the cDNA was ligated into pGEM®
Easy vector (Promega®, Madison, WI, USA) and ligation
was allowed to proceed overnight at 14°C. The resulting
plasmids were electroporated using One Shot® Top 10
Electrocomp ™ cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The transformants were spread on LB Agar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin for direct picking. Based
on blue/white screening, recombinant clones were
picked into Nunc-Immuno ™ 96 MicroWell ™ Plates
(Nunc™, Roskilde, Denmark) containing LB broth with
100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for overnight at 37°C
on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm. Glycerol stocks in 96well format were prepared by combining 38 μl of 60%
(v/v) glycerol with 150 μl of culture and frozen at -80°C.
EST sequencing, editing and assembly

Clones were randomly selected and on an average of
500 clones were sequenced per library in case of FWresponse study and 1000 clones per library in case of
SMD-responsive study. The plasmid DNA from these
clones (i.e. colonies) was extracted using a 96-well alkaline lysis method prior to sequencing [69]. Plasmid
DNA sequencing was performed by commercial DNA
sequencing service provider (Macrogen Inc., Korea)
using the standard M13 forward primer.
The FASTA files containing the raw sequences were
edited by the software Sequencher ™ 4.0 (Gene Codes
Corporation, Ann Arbor. MI, USA) to remove the vector sequences. The vector screened sequences were subjected to EST trimmer [70], to trim poly-A ends and
low quality sequences. High quality sequences of >100
bp were selected for further sequence analysis. ESTs
were clustered and aligned into contigs and singletons
using the CAP3 program [71].
In order to assess the number of unique and overlapping transcripts among the 16 libraries, four data sets
were generated; those derived from libraries constructed
from of FW-responsive genotypes (UG-I); those derived
from libraries constructed from of SMD-responsive genotypes (UG-II); combined dataset of FW- and SMDresponsive ESTs (UG-III); and also from public domain
sequences with total generated ESTs in this study (UGIV). In addition to the above assembly of unigene sets,

Raju et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/45

CAP3 analysis was also performed to libraries derived
from FW- resistant genotype, FW- susceptible genotype,
SMD- resistant genotype and from SMD- susceptible
genotype individually.
Homology search and functional annotation

The unigene sequences were also characterized for
nucleotide homology search against the EST datasets of
selected legume species [pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)-908,
chickpea (Cicer arietinum)-7,097, soybean (Glycine
max)-880,561, Medicago (Medicago truncatula)-249,625,
common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)-83,448, cowpea
(Vigna unguiculata)-183,757 and Lotus (Lotus japonicus)-183,153] and selected model plant species [rice
(Oryza sativa)-1,240,613, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)-1,527,298 and poplar (Populus alba)-418,223]
available at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using
BLASTN algorithm [72]. A match was considered significant at E-value ≤ 1E-05.
Each unigene dataset was subjected to BLASTX analysis against the non-redundant protein database of UniProt to deduce a putative function. Sequence similarity
was considered as significant at E-value ≤ 1E-08. Each
unigene was assigned a putative cellular function based
on the significant database hit with lowest e-value. Subsequently, unigenes that showed a significant BLASTX
hit were used for functional annotation based on Gene
Ontology categories from UniProt database (UniProtGO). This process allowed assignment of unigenes to
the GO functional categories of biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Distribution of
unigenes was further investigated in terms of their
assignment to sub-categories of the main GO categories.
In silico expression and hierarchical clustering

In order to identify the differentially expressed genes in
FW- and SMD- responsive genotypes, 389 contigs coming from FW-responsive genotypes and 328 contigs
coming SMD-responsive genotypes were analyzed by
using IDEG.6 web interface tool [73,74]. The IDEG.6
web tool allows running six different statistical analyses
for the detection of differentially expressed genes in
multiple tag experiments. For pair-wise comparisons,
the Audic and Claverie test, Fisher exact test and chisquare tests (Χ2) were used and in multiple comparisons
R- statistics test, Greller and Tobin test and chi-square
tests (Χ2) were used [73,74].
Further, gene expression analysis was performed with
hierarchical clustering expression (HCE) version 2.0 beta
software [75] using transcript abundance data from UGIII set that includes 697 contigs derived from both the
stress responsive libraries. As a pre-requisite for HCE
analysis, all 697 contigs were subjected to R statistics

Page 18 of 22

(R>8) and only those contigs (71) were selected that
have; (i) minimum 5 ESTs, and (ii) differential abundance of ESTs coming from different libraries. The
matrix file developed based on the frequency of ESTs to
each of 71 contigs was used as input file for above mentioned HCE tool.
Identification and development of SSR markers

A total of 5,085 unigenes (unigene set, UG-IV) developed based on 9,888 ESTs generated in this study and
908 public domain ESTs were searched with a Perl
script program, MISA (MIcroSAtellite) [23,76] for identification and localization of SSRs. The SSR motifs, with
repeat units more than five times in di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta- and hexa- nucleotides were considered as SSR
search criteria in MISA script. The Primer3 programme
[77] was used for designing the primer pairs for SSRs
and custom synthesized by MWG (MWG-Biotech AG,
Bangalore, India).
The primer pairs for SSRs were tested for their utility
as potential genetic markers on 40 elite genotypes of
pigeonpea (Additional file 13). PCR amplifications were
performed in 5 μl reactions containing 5 ng of genomic
DNA, 1× SE-Taq DNA polymerase buffer (including 1.5
mM MgCl2), 2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer and
0.1 U Taq DNA polymerase (SibEnzyme, Novosibirsk,
Russia) with the following touch down profile; 3 min at
95°C; 5 cycles of 20 sec at 94°C, 20 sec at 60°C minus 1°
C/cycle, 30 sec at 72°C; 40 cycles of 20 sec at 94°C, 20
sec at 56°C, 30 sec at 72°C; and 20 min at 72°C for final
extension. PCR products were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels for 3 h at 600 V and
visualized by silver staining. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of individual EST-SSR markers was
calculated by using the standard formula [62]. Only data
from polymorphic SSR loci were used for diversity analysis. Genetic similarities between any two genotypes
were estimated according to Nei and Li [78]. All 40 genotypes were clustered with the Unweighted Pair Group
Method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) in the
SAHN procedure of the NTSYS-PC v2.10t [79].
SNP detection and their conversion into CAPS

All 871 contigs obtained from the collection of 5,085
unigenes (UG-IV) were searched for putative SNP/indels
by using an integrated pipeline for large scale SNP discovery [80,81]. The pipeline utilized the CAP3 output
files as input to detect SNPs/indels based on the nucleotide redundancy in the multiple sequence alignments.
The auto SNP pipeline generated text file includes contig ID, number of sequences in the contig ID, consensus
length, number of SNPs, mutation type and SNP frequency. The threshold for identification of SNPs was
based on the number of sequences (≥ 5) in each

Raju et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:45
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/45

consensus sequence and two or more sequences from
different genotype. In order to verify the SNPs at
sequence level, the PCR amplicons of all four genotypes
were sequenced using the corresponding forward and
reverse primers for a set of 10 contigs (see Additional
file 14). The amplicons were purified and further
sequencing was done as described [80]. The sequenced
data along with the sequences of ESTs (that provided
the SNPs initially) were aligned and analyzed using
BioEdit programme http://www.mbio.nesu.edu/BioEdit.
html.
For converting SNPs into cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers, SNPs present in 37
contigs were analyzed to identify the recognition site for
any of commercially available 725 restriction enzymes
[82] by using integrated SNP2CAPS pipeline [80].
