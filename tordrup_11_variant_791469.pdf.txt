Variant Plasmodium ovale isolated from a
patient infected in Ghana
David Tordrup1, Jakob Virenfeldt2, Felicie F Andersen1, Eskild Petersen2*

Abstract
Recent data have found that Plasmodium ovale can be separated in two distinct species: classic and variant P. ovale
based on multilocus typing of different genes. This study presents a P. ovale isolate from a patient infected in
Ghana together with an analysis of the small subunit RNA, cytochrome b, cytochrome c oxidase I, cysteine
protease and lactate dehydrogenase genes, which show that the sample is a variant P. ovale and identical or
highly similar to variant P. ovale isolated from humans in South-East Asia and Africa, and from a chimpanzee in
Cameroon. The split between the variant and classic P. ovale is estimated to have occurred 1.7 million years ago.
Background
It is usually assumed that the four major human malaria
species Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax,
Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae have no
animal reservoirs and that zoonotic Plasmodium infections in humans are highly unusual. The recent finding
that Plasmodium knowlesi is found in several countries
in Southeast Asia, where it has been wrongly classified
as P. malariae, shows that molecular typing may change
the understanding of human malaria as an infection
strictly transmitted between humans [1,2]. Plasmodium
ovale was first described from West Africa in 1922 and
subsequently from every continent [3]. In West Africa, a
blood film P. ovale parasite positive rate between 0.7%
and 10% has been found [4]. However, in other areas
the occurrence of isolated cases is difficult to explain
without an animal reservoir [3].
Characterization of P. ovale from Southeast Asia based
on the small subunit rRNA gene and parts of the
cysteine protease, ookinete surface protein and cytochrome b genes indicate that P. ovale can be divided
into at least two types, classic and variant, which do not
differ morphologically [5,6]. Variant P. ovale seems to
be associated with higher parasite density in humans
[7-9]. A recent study of 55 P. ovale isolates from around
the world clearly showed that variant and classic
P. ovale co-exist and do not recombine [10].

A study comparing sequences from the cytochrome b,
cytochrome c oxidase 1 and lactate dehydrogenase genes
of Plasmodium spp. from gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) with P. ovale from
humans found one variant P. ovale in a chimpanzee
closely related to the human variant [11].
This study describes the molecular characterization of
a P. ovale isolate from a patient infected in Ghana,
showing that the isolate is a variant P. ovale based on
the characterization of five genes, and that it is identical
or highly similar to a P. ovale variant isolated from a
chimpanzee [11] and from humans in two separate studies [5,10]. The time of the phylogenetic split between
the two species is estimated at 1,7 million years ago.

Methods
Patient

The patient was a 59-year-old Danish male, admitted
with fever in March 2009 after traveling in Ghana for
two weeks in November 2008, who had not taken prophylaxis regularly. The itinerary included Accra, the
Volta River and a resort on the Cape Coast.
Except for hypertension and atrial fibrillation, he was
previously healthy. He had visited Ghana for short visits
in 2005, 06 and 07. Fever started nine days before admission, with no focal symptoms. Physical examination at
admission was normal. At admission the laboratory tests
showed a C-reactive protein of 59.9 mg/l (< 8), haemoglobin 9.4 mmol/lit (8.1 - 10.3), white blood cell count of
6.0 with relative lymphopenia of 0.21 (1.3 - 3.5 x 10^9/l)
and a thrombocytopaenia of 93 (145 - 350 x 10^9/l).

Thick and thin blood films showed a P. ovale infection
with an initial parasitaemia of 0.5% and numeration of
the parasite density found 11,600 parasites per μl blood
(Figure 1). The second day the parasitaemia was estimated to 0.1% with a density of 1,100 parasites per μl
blood. Quick-test (Binax, Bedford, UK) was negative.
Chest X-ray showed pneumonia on the left side, and the
patient was treated with ceftriaxone intravenously.
The patient was treated with chloroquine phosphate
over three days followed by primaquine 15 mg daily for
2 weeks. During the first two days hypotension with a
systolic pressure of 80 mmHg was successfully treated
with infusions of saline. The patient was discharged on
day 7 in good condition and no relapse has been
observed over an eighteen month follow up.
Isolation of parasitic genomic DNA and PCR

Parasitic genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood
using NucleoSpin Blood QuickPure (Macherey-Nagel,

Page 2 of 5

Düren, Germany) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
All PCR reactions were performed with Expand High
Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using
primers and concentrations as described in Additional
file 1: table S1. Reactions also contained 5 μL 1/100
diluted genomic DNA (possrdna) or 1uL 1/10 diluted
DNA (all other genes), 200 μM each dNTP, 2,6U
enzyme (1U for poldh and possrnda inner nests) and
1,5 mM MgCl2 in Expand High Fidelity Buffer, final
volume 50 μL (20 μL for inner nest reactions).
Cloning of PCR products

The PCR products were cloned into either the pYES2.1/
V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California)
and progated in E. coli Top10 cells (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California) (possrdna, pocytb) or cloned into
the pcDNA2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) and propagated in XL1-Blue cells
(pocox1, poldh, pocysp) under ampicillin selection

Plasmid purification and sequencing

Plasmids were purified using Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturers
protocol. Sequencing was performed with BigDye Terminator 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) on
an ABI3130 platform. Three separate clones from each
construct (except pocysp for which only one clone was
sequenced) were sequenced; conflicts were resolved by
majority vote.
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses

Sequencing data was assembled and consensus
sequences aligned in CLC Main Workbench 5.6 (CLC
bio, Aarhus, Denmark), gap open cost = 10, gap extension cost = 1 and end gap cost = as any other. Phylogenetic trees were calculated in CLC Main Workbench
5.6 using Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny. The initial
tree was calculated by Neighbor Joining and a HKY substitution model with a transition/transversion ratio of
2.0 was used for inferring phylogenetic relationships.
Estimation of divergence time

The sequences of pocytb and pocox1 from the patient isolate were concatenated in CLC Main Workbench 5.6 and
the resulting sequence was aligned to concatenated
pocytb and pocox1 sequences from 11 Plasmodium species in NCBI GenBank (for classic P. ovale FJ409567 and
FJ409571 were used for pocytb and pocox1 respectively).
The final alignment was 1671 nucleotides in length. The
BEAST software [12] was used to estimate the divergence
time, using Plasmodium gallinaceum as an outgroup and
assuming a divergence time of 6 +/- 0.5 MY (normal distribution) for P. falciparum/Plasmodium reichenowi for
calibration of the tree. The site model was HKY with estimated base frequencies and a 4 category gamma site heterogeneity model. An uncorrelated lognormal relaxed
clock was used, and the tree prior was set to Yule Process. The chain was run for 2.000.000 cycles and data
points were logged at every 200 cycles.

Results
Fever developed four months after a two-week visit to
Ghana and at admission, the patient had a microscopically diagnosed P. ovale infection with a parasitaemia of
0.5% and the presence of asexual forms, early schizonts
and gametocytes (Figure 1). A rapid test (Binax® ) was
negative. Because of the recent reports of variants of
P. ovale and because the patient had a negative rapid test,
the isolate was sequenced for further characterization.
Part of the asexually transcribed small subunit (18S)
ribosomal DNA (possrdna) gene from the isolate was
compared with classic and variant sequences published
in recent studies from Asia and Africa [5,10], revealing

Page 3 of 5

closer resemblance to the variant type from both studies
(table 1). To further characterize the isolate, the pocytb,
pocysp, pocox1 and poldh genes were sequenced and
compared with sequences from three recent studies.
The isolate sequences were 100% identical to the pocytb
variant type sequences reported in all three studies
[5,10,11], 99,8% identical to variant type cysp from
Asian isolates [5], and 100% identical to variant type
pocox1 and poldh from African isolates [11]. The isolate
was also compared to pocytb, pocox1 and poldh
sequences isolated from a chimpanzee [11], revealing
100% identity in all three genes (Table 1).
A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the
concatenated sequences of all five genes studied and
sequences published in GenBank (Figure 2). The
P. ovale variant type together with the present isolate
formed a clade related to but separate from the classic
type. Calculation of phylogenetic trees based on individual genes yielded equivalent results. To estimate the
split between variant and classic P. ovale, Bayesian Inference was used as implemented in the BEAST software
[12] with a calibration point of 6 Million Years (MYs) +/0.5 MYs for the human/chimpanzee speciation event as
represented by the P. falciparum/P. reichenowi split,
which gave an estimated age of 1.7 MY (95% Highest
Posterior Density 0.25-4.44MY) for the most recent
common ancestor of the variant and classic P. ovale.

Discussion
The recent study of 55 P. ovale isolates from around the
world clearly showed that P. ovale can be divided in two
species: classic and variant (suggested named Plasmodium
ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri) [10]. The
two species currently circulate side by side in the same
geographical areas and are not recombining even though
they infect the same host. It is not known whether variant P. ovale continues to circulate in both humans and
primates and it is intriguing that the variant and classic
strains do not recombine. One explanation for the speciation could be specificity for different Anopheles species
[10,13], another possibility is receptor divergence.
Humans ceased producing N-glycolylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Gc) around 2 to 3 million years ago but continued
producing N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in contrast
to old-world primates who synthesize both [14]. Neu5Gc
has been shown to interfere with the binding of P. falciparum Erythrocyte-Binding Antigen 175 (PfEBL-175) to
chimpanzee erythrocytes, possibly explaining why P. falciparum does not infect chimpanzees [15]. The evolutionary timing of the loss of Neu5Gc coincides with our
estimated divergence time of 1.7 million years, which is
in agreement with the estimate of Sutherland et al. [10],
and could explain the split between the two P. ovale

variants by a similar mechanism in which only classic
P. ovale is sensitive to Neu5Gc interference.
The chimpanzee can be infected with P. ovale, but the
infection is self-limiting [16,17], though it is not known
whether these experiments were performed with variant
or classic P. ovale. P. ovale in chimpanzees closely
related or identical to human variant P. ovale has been
described in Cameroon [11], and three different genes
from the isolate described here (pocytb, pocox1 and
poldh) are 100% identical to this variant. This suggests
that the P. ovale used by Bray [16,17] was a classic
P. ovale strain. The data presented here further indicate
that P. ovale which naturally infects chimpanzees can
also infect humans, and that the isolate described here
is identical or closely related to the variant isolates
sampled in South-East Asia [5,10] and Africa [10]. All
five genes sequenced here support the segregation of
P. ovale into two distinct species.
Molecular typing has clearly demonstrated that
P. knowlesi infections in Southeast Asia has been misdiagnosed as P. malariae and that P. knowlesi is much
more widespread than previously thought [1,2]. Few

data exist on P. falciparum, but the recent finding of a
new Plasmodium in chimpanzees in Gabon closely
related to P. falciparum and P. reichenowi [18,19], show
that more studies are needed to fully understand the
dynamics of malaria transmission between humans and
potential animal reservoirs.
