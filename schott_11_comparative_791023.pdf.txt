Comparative Genomics of Helicobacter pylori and
the human-derived Helicobacter bizzozeronii CIII-1
strain reveal the molecular basis of the zoonotic
nature of non-pylori gastric Helicobacter
infections in humans
Thomas Schott, Pradeep K Kondadi, Marja-Liisa Hänninen and Mirko Rossi*

Abstract
Background: The canine Gram-negative Helicobacter bizzozeronii is one of seven species in Helicobacter heilmannii
sensu lato that are detected in 0.17-2.3% of the gastric biopsies of human patients with gastric symptoms. At the
present, H. bizzozeronii is the only non-pylori gastric Helicobacter sp. cultivated from human patients and is
therefore a good alternative model of human gastric Helicobacter disease. We recently sequenced the genome of
the H. bizzozeronii human strain CIII-1, isolated in 2008 from a 47-year old Finnish woman suffering from severe
dyspeptic symptoms. In this study, we performed a detailed comparative genome analysis with H. pylori, providing
new insights into non-pylori Helicobacter infections and the mechanisms of transmission between the primary
animal host and humans.
Results: H. bizzozeronii possesses all the genes necessary for its specialised life in the stomach. However, H.
bizzozeronii differs from H. pylori by having a wider metabolic flexibility in terms of its energy sources and electron
transport chain. Moreover, H. bizzozeronii harbours a higher number of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins,
allowing it to respond to a wider spectrum of environmental signals. In this study, H. bizzozeronii has been shown
to have high level of genome plasticity. We were able to identify a total of 43 contingency genes, 5 insertion
sequences (ISs), 22 mini-IS elements, 1 genomic island and a putative prophage. Although H. bizzozeronii lacks
homologues of some of the major H. pylori virulence genes, other candidate virulence factors are present. In
particular, we identified a polysaccharide lyase (HBZC1_15820) as a potential new virulence factor of H. bizzozeronii.
Conclusions: The comparative genome analysis performed in this study increased the knowledge of the biology of
gastric Helicobacter species. In particular, we propose the hypothesis that the high metabolic versatility and the ability to
react to a range of environmental signals, factors which differentiate H. bizzozeronii as well as H. felis and H. suis from
H. pylori, are the molecular basis of the of the zoonotic nature of H. heilmannii sensu lato infection in humans.

Background
Helicobacter pylori is established as the primary cause of
gastritis and peptic ulceration in humans and has been
recognised as a major risk factor for mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma [1]. However, in gastric biopsies of a minority of

patients (0.17-2.3%) with upper gastrointestinal symptoms,
long, tightly coiled spiral bacteria, referred to non-H. pylori
gastric Helicobacter species (NHPGH), have been observed
[2,3]. Although NHPGH-associated gastritis is usually mild
to moderate compared to H. pylori gastritis, severe complications of NHPGH infection have been reported, and it is
important to note that MALT lymphoma is significantly
more frequent in NHPGH-infected patients compared to
those infected with H. pylori [4].

As a strictly human-associated pathogen, H. pylori is
transmitted from human to human. In contrast, NHPGH
are zoonotic agents for which animals are the natural
reservoir [5]. Recently, the term H. heilmannii sensu lato
has been proposed to be used to refer to the whole group
of NHPGH detected in the human or animal stomach
when only morphology and limited taxonomical data are
available [3]. Indeed, H. heilmannii s.l. comprises seven
described Helicobacter species: the porcine Helicobacter
suis; the feline Helicobacter felis, Helicobacter baculiformis
and Helicobacter heilmannii sensu stricto (s.s.); and the
canine Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter salomonis
and Helicobacter cynogastricus [3]. These Helicobacter
species are very fastidious microorganisms and difficult to
distinguish from each others with conventional identification procedures. Due to difficulties in the isolation and
identification of H. heilmannii s.l., its epidemiology in
human infections remains unclear. Although development
of specific isolation methods has allowed to identify several
new species considered to be uncultivable (i.e.: H. suis and
H. heilmannii s.s. [2,3]), up to now only H. bizzozeronii
has been cultivated from the gastric mucosa of two human
patients [6-8].
H. bizzozeronii, described as a new species in 1996 [9],
is a canine-adapted species that is often found during a
histological examination of gastric biopsies of dogs both
with and without morphological signs of gastritis [10].
Virtually all animals are infected, and the pathogenic significance of H. bizzozeronii in dogs remains unknown
[2,10]. Experimental infection studies using mice [11]
and gerbils [12] have suggested that H. bizzozeronii
appears to be associated with a lower pathogenicity than
H. pylori or H. felis. Even in cases of heavy bacterial loading, the only pathological finding observed was focal
apoptotic loss of gastric epithelial cells [12]. Despite the
lack of connection between H. bizzozeronii and gastric
diseases in both naturally and experimentally-infected
animals, H. bizzozeronii has been associated in both
human cases with severe dyspeptic symptoms [7,8].
Moreover, the human H. bizzozeronii strain CIII-1 was
isolated from antrum and corpus biopsies that revealed
chronic active gastritis [8], indicating that this species is
able to induce similar injuries in the human gastric
mucosa to those observed in H. pylori-infected patients.
Several genome sequences of H. pylori are available,
and recently, the genomes of other gastric Helicobacter
species were also published [13-16]. Among H. heilmannii s.l., the genomes of the type strain of H. felis [16],
isolated from a cat, and of two strains of H. suis [15],
both isolated from pigs, were determined. Recently, we
sequenced the genome of the H. bizzozeronii human
strain CIII-1, isolated in 2008 from a 47-year-old
Finnish woman suffering from severe dyspeptic symptoms [17]. To our knowledge, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 is

Page 2 of 21

the only human H. heilmannii s.l. strain for which the
genome is available and constitutes a keystone in the
comprehension of non-pylori Helicobacter infections
and of the mechanisms of transmission between the primary animal host and humans. Moreover, although the
role of H. bizzozeronii in human gastric disease is limited compared to H. pylori, both of the species persistently colonise the same niche and possibly exploit
similar mechanisms to interact with the host and induce
gastritis. Thus, a comparative genome analysis between
H. pylori and the human H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 would
expand our knowledge of the biology of gastric Helicobacter spp. and of the pathogenesis of human gastritis.
In this study, we provide a detailed comparative genome
analysis of H. pylori and the human H. bizzozeronii CIII-1
strain. We advance the hypothesis that the zoonotic nature
of H. bizzozeronii, and, by extension of H. heilmannii s.l.,
is explicable from its high metabolic versatility, which
probably supports the growth of this bacterium in a wide
range of niches.

Results and discussion
General features and comparison with other taxa

The general features of the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome
were previously described [17]. Briefly, the chromosome is
similar in size and GC content (46%) to other sequenced
gastric Helicobacter species [13,16] and includes 1,894
protein-coding sequences (CDSs) in a coding area of 93%.
A putative function could be predicted for 1,280 (67.7%)
of the CDSs, whereas 614 (32.4%) of the CDSs were annotated as hypothetical proteins. A summary of the features
of the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome is provided in
Table 1, and a circular plot of the chromosome showing
GC content and GC skew is presented in Figure 1.
The taxonomy of the best BLAST hits for the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 CDSs is shown in Table 2. Approximately
94% of the CIII-1 proteins have their best matches in proteins encoded by ε-proteobacteria, 97% of which belong to
Helicobacteracae, and 95% are similar to proteobacterial
proteins. H. felis is the most closely related organism, covering almost 50% of the best matches, followed by H. suis
(36%) and H. pylori (2.7%). However, 33% of the CDSs
have a homologue from H. pylori within the 5 best BLAST
matches. Among the Campylobacter spp., C. rectus is the
closest to H. bizzozeronii (0.9%; 16/1894) even though the
homology is limited to the prophage region (see below).
Matches to non-ε-proteobacteria are found within the Firmicutes (1.58%), g-proteobacteria (0.9%), Bacteroides
(0.6%) and also within the Eukaryota (0.9%).
We further compared the genome of H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1 with the genomes of 10 human H. pylori strains to
identify proteins that are unique to H. bizzozeronii as well
as proteins found in H. pylori but lacking in H. bizzozeronii. The H. pylori core genome and H. bizzozeronii CIII-1

have 1,034 groups of orthologues in common, to which
1,052 CDSs from CIII-1 belong. Moreover, 412 groups are
found in H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 and in at least two H. pylori
strains, and 192 groups are common in CIII-1 and in at
least one H. pylori strain. The H. pylori core genome contains 151 groups of unique orthologues while a total of
562 CDSs are unique to H. bizzozeronii CIII-1. Among the
562 unique H. bizzozeronii CDSs, a putative function was
predicted for only 147 (26%). Each of these 147 CDSs was
searched against the NCBI nr database using BLASTp to
identify homologies with other H. pylori strains. A total of
59 out of the 147 CDSs showed a homology to proteins of
at least one H. pylori strain, restricting the number of

unique H. bizzozeronii CDSs with a predicted function to
88. Excluding the proteins associated either with bacteriophage or with plasmid replication, the functions of the
majority of the unique H. bizzozeronii genes are linked to
chemotaxis and metabolism (Figure 1).
General features involved in the colonisation of the
stomach: acid acclimation, mobility and chemotaxis

As described for the H. pylori genome [18], the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome contains a complete urease gene
cluster (ureABIEFGH; HBZC1_10430 to HBZC1_10490)
that is essential for acid acclimation and pH homeostasis, crucial mechanisms for the gastric colonisation. The

Schott et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:534
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/534

urease gene cluster showed the same syntheny as in
H. pylori. Unlike the other animal gastric Helicobacter
species, H. felis and H. mustelae [13,16], H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1 lacks the additional urease genes (ureAB2). Other
essential mechanisms for the colonisation of the gastric
mucosa participate in pH homeostasis [18]: H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 contains the periplasmic a-carbonic anhydrase
orthologue HBZC1_14670, which contributes to the
urease-dependent response to acidity in H. pylori [19],
but lacks an orthologue for the b-carbonic anhydrase. In
addition, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 carries both the asparagine and glutamine deamidase-transport systems of
AnsB (HBZC1_05200 and HBZC1_12160) plus DcuA
(HBZC1_00140) and gGT (HBZC1_08080) plus GltS
(HBZC1_14360) that contribute to periplasmic ammonia
production in H. pylori and may have a possible role in
the resistance to weakly acidic conditions and in
the pathogenesis of gastritis [20]. A unique feature of
H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 that might also contribute to acid
acclimation is the presence of two copies of a putative
allophanate hydrolase (HBZC1_04550 and HBZC1_
09470). This enzyme catalyses the second reaction of
the two-step degradation of urea to ammonia and CO2
and is usually found adjacent to a biotin-containing urea
carboxylase gene (HBZC1_04560 and HBZC1_09490,
respectively), which functions as an allophanate synthase
from urea [21]. Orthologues of allophanate hydrolase
have been found to be widely distributed among several
subdomains of Bacteria, including Campylobacter
species and H. felis, but their role in urea degradation
has been demonstrated only in the environmental aproteobacteria species Oleomonas sagaranensis [21].
In H. bizzozeronii the orthologue could contribute to
the cytoplasmic degradation of urea in combination
with urease. However, other functions, such as the
degradation of aromatic compounds [22], could not be
excluded.
Motility is fundamental for colonisation of the mucosa
by gastric Helicobacter species [23], and, similarly to other
flagellated bacteria, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 harbours a large
group of genes distributed widely in the genome, encoded
by the fla, flg, flh and fli gene families, which are involved
in the regulation, secretion and assembly of flagella [24].
Chemotactic pathways that are governed by two-component regulatory systems, histidine kinase proteins and regulatory proteins, modulate the direction and speed of
motility using responses of specific signals detected by
receptors formed by methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins
(MCPs). The repertoire of the chemotactic signal pathways
of a microorganism is correlated to the environments it
can transfer, the hosts it colonises and the diseases it can
cause [25]. Despite the similar number of two-component
systems, 4 histidine kinases and 10 regulatory proteins
[26], H. bizzozeronii harbours five times more MCPs than

Page 7 of 21

H. pylori. Twenty MCPs, one containing a PAS domain,
were detected in the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome compared to the four predicted in H. pylori 26695 (Figure 1;
see additional file 1: Table S1) [26]. The abundance of predicted MCPs, similarly observed in H. felis [16], indicates
an elaborate sensing capability of H. bizzozeronii that
allows the bacterium to survive in different ecological
niches and probably supports its capability to transfer
between different hosts.
The central intermediary metabolism

Understanding the metabolic properties of any pathogen is
crucial to gain a full picture of the pathogenicity of related
diseases. For example, C. jejuni is a more versatile and
metabolically active pathogen than the more specialised
H. pylori. The metabolic versatility of C. jejuni enables the
bacterium to survive in different environments and to
colonise a variety of animal species, while the high specialisation of H. pylori is probably the result of a process of
adaptation to the human stomach [27]. Although H. pylori
and H. bizzozeronii colonise similar niches, an important
difference between these two species is the capability of
H. bizzozeronii to move from a dog to a human host [2].
The central metabolism of H. bizzozeronii, which can be
inferred from the genome of the human strain CIII-1,
appears to be more flexible than that of H. pylori and
could explain the zoonotic nature of this species.
As observed for H. pylori [28,29], even though the glycolysis pathway is incomplete because of the lack of phosphofructokinase, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 may use glucose as
a source of energy through the pentose phosphate reactions and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. However, in
contrast to what was observed in H. pylori, H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1 possess three genes organised in a single operon
that are required for glycerol metabolism: glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD, HBZC1_03150), glycerol
kinase (glpK, HBZC1_03160 and HBZC1_03170) and a
glycerol uptake facilitator protein (glpP, HBZC1_03180).
Glycerol-3-phosphate is a central intermediate in glycolysis and in phospholipid metabolism [30]. The enzyme
glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase converts glycerol-3phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which can enter
the glycolysis pathway, conferring significant metabolic
advantages on this species.
The absence of obvious homologues of succinyl-CoA
synthetase indicates the presence of the alternative citric
acid cycle (CAC), which has been described in H. pylori
[31] (Figure 2; see additional file 1: Table S2). However, in
contrast to H. pylori [27], the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome contains several genes involved in the anaplerotic
replenishment of oxaloacetate, succinate and a-ketoglutarate (Figure 2; see additional file 1: Table S2). Like C. jejuni
[27], the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome includes a homologue of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase

(HBZC1_05500) that may function in oxaloacetate synthesis. In addition, the genome harbours genes encoding
enzymes potentially involved in the 2-methylcitric acid
cycle (HBZC1_01560; HBZC1_08220; HBZC1_08230;
HBZC1_06010) that produces succinate and pyruvate from
the breakdown of propionate [32]. Moreover, a group of
three genes, 4-aminobutyrate transaminase (HBZC1_
12340), NADP+-Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase
(HBZC1_12330) and an amino acid permease (HBZC1_
12320), share homology with the gabDTP operon of E. coli
but do not have orthologues in any of the H. pylori
sequenced genomes. These genes are potentially involved
in the production of succinic acid from the degradation of
polyamines or g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [33]. The
synthesis of GABA from L-glutamate might occur in
H. bizzozeronii trough the action of a glutamate decarboxylase (HBZC1_04360/HBZC1_04370) which does not have
orthologue in H. pylori. Downstream of the putative H. bizzozeronii gabDTP operon, there are two gene homologues

to the E. coli carbon starvation-induced protein (csiD,
HBZC1_12310) and L-2-hydroxygluturate oxidase (lhgO,
HBZC1_12300). In E. coli, lhgO, located immediately
downstream of csiD and upstream of the gabDTP operon,
plays a role the recovering a-ketoglutarate, an intermediate
in CAC, reduced by other enzymes [34]. In E. coli, all of
these genes are regulated by the CsiR repression and sS
induction acting on csiDp during carbon starvation and the
stationary phase [35]. H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 lacks both of
these transcriptional regulators but it contains a homologue of carbon-starvation regulator (CsrA, HBZC1_09070)
that controls the H. pylori response to environmental stress
[36] and could play a similar role in H. bizzozeronii.
Finally, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 harbours a cluster of 4
conserved genes (HBZC1_00410 to HBZC1_00460), annotated as acetophenone carboxylase subunits 1 to 4, which
show a low homology with microbial hydantoinases. This
group of genes is located near to the SCOT (scoAB,
HBZC1_00390 and HBZC1_00400) and acetoacetyl-CoA

Schott et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:534
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/534

thiolase (fadB, HBZC1_00380) genes. A similar gene cluster, encoding a set of enzymes capable of metabolizing
acetone to acetyl-CoA, has also been described in H. pylori
(scoAB, fadB and acxABC) [37]. However, the homology
between the H. pylori acxABC and the H. bizzozeronii
acetophenone carboxylase gene cluster is very low (<30%),
indicating that the H. bizzozeronii genes could be involved
in an alternative pathway.
Physiology of microaerobic growth

The complexity of the electron transport chain is another
important element in the ability of bacteria to grow under
a variety of environmental conditions, determining the
metabolic flexibility of the bacterium based on the variety
of electron donors and acceptors that can be used to support growth [38]. The respiratory chain in H. bizzozeronii
appears to be highly branched and more complex than
described for H. pylori (Figure 3; see additional file 1:
Table S2).

Page 9 of 21

In addition to hydrogenase HydABCDE (from
HBZC1_10200 to HBZC1_10150) and other dehydrogenases in common with H. pylori (Figure 3; see additional
file 1: Table S2) [39], the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome
contains a putative formate dehydrogenase enzyme complex, organised in a operon (from HBZC1_13510 to
HBZC1_13550), which could enable the bacteria to use
formate as an electron donor, as observed in other ε-proteobacteria [38]. In addition, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (HBZC1_03150) provides H. bizzozeronii CIII-1
an extra possibility for substrate-derived electrons to be
donated to the membrane-bound electron transport chain.
H. bizzozeronii requires oxygen for growth and is unable
to survive under anaerobic conditions [9]. As previously
observed in H. pylori, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 possesses only
one terminal oxidase, ccoNOQP (from HBZC1_08510 to
HBZC1_08540), which encodes a cytochrome cb-type
enzyme, the major factor in aerobic respiratory metabolism [38]. In addition to using an oxygen-dependent

electron transport, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 could use as electron acceptors fumarate by a fumarate reductase system
(FrdABC, from HBZC1_01900 to HBZC1_01920), as
described in H. pylori [39]. However H. bizzozeronii could
also utilize nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors. This
characteristic had been already shown in C. jejuni but not
in H. pylori [38]. Nitrate could be reduced by a periplasmic
nitrate reductase system (NapAGH, from HBZC1_08800
to HBZC1_08830; NapB, HBZC1_04310; NapFD;
HBZC1_03530-HBZC1_03540), which differs from the C.
jejuni system for the absence of NapL homologues and by
the fact that it is not organised in a single operon (Figure
1) [38]. Moreover, although a clear C. jejuni nitrite reductase orthologue is absent, the genome of H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1 contains a cluster of two genes encoding a putative
periplasmic nitrite reductase (HBZC1_10540) and a cytochrome-c nitrite reductase subunit c552 domain containing protein (annotated as hydroxylamine oxidoreductase;
HBZC1_10550), suggesting that nitrate could be used in
anaerobic respiration by this species. In addition to using
nitrate and nitrite, H. bizzozeronii could also use S- or Noxides as electron acceptors, as observed in other ε-proteobacteria [27]. In fact, trimethylamine-n-oxide (TMAO)
and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) could be reduced by a
putative periplasmic system, a homologue of Cj0264c/
Cj0265c (HBZC1_10800/HBZC1_10810) [38]. In H. pylori
a putative trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase is present
(HP0407 in H. pylori 26695; 41% amino acid identity with
HBZC1_10810 over 93% of sequence length). Although a
homologue of the monoheme c type cytochrome
(HBZC1_10800/Cj0265c) is absent, we cannot exclude
that H. pylori may also be able to use TMAO/DMSO in
respiration through a different pathway.
Other genes possibly involved in the electron transport
chain that are present in the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome
without clear homologues in H. pylori are: two copies of
an NAD(P)H-dependant oxidoreductase (HBZC1_02100
and HBZC1_08240), a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase (HBZC1_01010) and an aldo/keto reductase
(HBZC1_08400). Although it is not possible to predict the
functions of these genes, their presence increases the complexity of the electron transport chain of H. bizzozeronii
and clearly differentiates this species from H. pylori.
Like H. pylori [39], because of its microaerophilic
requirements, H. bizzozeronii expresses several defence
mechanisms against oxidative stress. These include an
iron-cofactored superoxide dismutase SodB (HBZC1_
11160/11150), catalase enzyme KatA (HBZC1_12240),
Cytocrome-c peroxidase (HBZC1_05800) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (HBZC1_01800). Moreover, because
metal ions like iron and nickel favour the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the detoxification of ROS needs
to be coupled tightly to the control of intracellular metal
concentrations, ensuring metal ion homeostasis by the

Page 10 of 21

regulation of metal uptake, export and storage [40]. H. bizzozeronii contains all of the genes involved in nickel and
iron uptake, storage and metabolism that have been
described in other Helicobacter species [13,40].
Features involved in the interaction with the host: surface
structures and secreted proteins

H. bizzozeronii is able to persistently colonise the stomach of both dogs [2] and humans [6-8]. Therefore, the
bacteria need to constantly interact with the hosts
directly, using fixed bacterial surface molecules that mediate adherence, and indirectly, by the secretion of soluble
proteins that act on respective host receptors.
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) play important roles
in the interaction with the host by mediating the adhesion to the mucosa and, therefore, the colonisation of the
stomach and modulating the host immune response.
Moreover, OMPs are essential for the general metabolism of the bacteria, preserving the selective permeability
of the outer membrane to different substrates [41]. The
H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome encodes a total of 51 putative OMPs (see additional file 1: Table S3) that are phylogenetically related to the five OMP families described in
H. pylori [42]. Twenty of the H. bizzozeronii OMPs are
similar to the Family 1 OMPs of H. pylori that include
both Hop and Hor proteins. In contrast to the common
finding that H. pylori attaches to the membrane of
epithelial cells using different adhesive structures [42],
studies on non-pylori Helicobacter species in mice and
Mongolian gerbils [11,43] and in dogs [44] showed no
evidence of a tight attachment to gastric epithelial cells
by H. bizzozeronii. In fact, although 8 out a total of 20
H. bizzozeronii Family 1 OMPs belong to the Hop category, none of them could be considered as orthologues of
the BabA, BabB or SabA adhesins, which play a major
role in H. pylori adhesion to the gastric mucosa [45].
However, H. bizzozeronii was found in the intracellular
canaliculi and in the cytoplasm of the parietal cells of
canine gastric mucosa [44]. Although it is not clear how
this Helicobacter sp. penetrates into the cytoplasm of parietal cells, a possible role of the H. bizzozeronii Hop proteins as adhesins with a different receptor specificity
from that described in H. pylori, should be considered.
Excluding the hofA homolog (HBZC1_6200), the other
eight H. bizzozeronii hof genes are organised in a single
operon (hofHHBFEGCD; from HBZC1_06760 to
HBZC1_06830). This region is characterised by an anomalously low GC content and was identified as potential
laterally acquired DNA by the Alien Hunter program
[46]. Hof family was identified from the H. pylori proteome based on a heat-stable 50 KDa OMP [41], but its
role is still unknown. Three of the H. bizzozeronii OMPs
belong to Hom Family 3, and a total of 5 putative efflux
pump OMPs (Family 5) were identified. Moreover,

Schott et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:534
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/534

5 iron-regulated OMPs (Family 4) were detected in the
H. bizzozeronii genome. Finally, the remaining 10 H. bizzozeronii OMPs are currently unclassified, including the
putative VacA-paralog (HBZC1_11860/11850), a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (HBZC1_14500), the
membrane-associated lipoprotein Lpp20 (HBZC1_01250)
and a putative protease (HBZC1_01500).
The communication between a microbial pathogen and
its host occurs also due to the recognition of cell surface
glycomolecules, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), capsular polysaccharides and N- and O-glycoproteins, the
structure of which depends of the presence and functional
transcription of the genes encoding glycosyltransferases
(GTs) [47]. A total of 24 GTs were annotated in the
genome of H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 (see additional file 1:
Table S4), 22 of which belong to 10 distinct GT-families
according to the sequence-based classification of GTs
available in the CAZy database [48]. In addition, the genome of H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 harbours 20 orthologues of
genes implicated in the biosynthesis of glycan structures in
other bacterial species (see additional file 1: Table S4),
including a complete flagellin O-glycosylation pathway
that is essential for flagella assembly and motility [49]. The
LPS of H. pylori, which displays Lewis blood-group (Le)
antigens, is a primary host-interacting structure, and several lines of evidence indicate that it is involved in hostadaptation and virulence [50]. Distinct from H. pylori,
H. bizzozeronii produces a predominantly low-molecularweight LPS and does not apparently exhibit a molecular
mimicry of Lewis and other blood group antigens [51].
However, anti-H. pylori LPS core antibodies reacted with
the H. bizzozeronii LPS, indicating a shared epitope
between these two species [51]. Several genes are involved
in the biosynthesis of LPS in H. bizzozeronii and are
dispersed across the genome as they are described in
H. pylori [26]. In addition to the conserved genes of the
LPS biosynthesis pathway (see additional file 1: Table S4),
the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome includes a putative
a1,3-fucosyltransferase (GT10; HBZC1_11830), a tandem
of two putative galactosyltransferases (GT25; HBZC1_
4780/4770/4760 and HBZC1_4800/4790) that are fragmented due to the presence of homopolymeric runs, a
putative a1,3-sialyltransferase (GT42; HBZC1_02560) and
other putative glycosyltransferases that belong to GTfamily 2 or 4 or are unclassified. Structural analysis of the
H. bizzozeronii LPS have shown the presence of fucose
[51] and sialyl-lactoseamine (M. Rossi, unpublished data),
confirming the role of GT10, GT25 and GT42 in the modification of the oligosaccharide region of LPS. However,
several other GTs cannot be confidently included in a specific biosynthesis pathway. Among these genes, a cluster of
6 GTs (from HBZC1_07440 to HBZC1_07490) and a
putative polysaccharide deacetylase (HBC1_07500) are
particularly interesting (Figure 1). Orthologues of these

Page 11 of 21

genes are not found in H. pylori. Although some of these
genes have homologues in the H. felis and H. suis genomes
[15,16], the number and synteny of the genes appear to be
specific characteristics of H. bizzozeronii.
The extracellular proteins of H. pylori are known to
mediate pathogen-host interaction during infection [52].
To export proteins H. bizzozeronii, as a gram-negative
bacterium, utilises the Sec or the twin-arginine secretion
(Tat) systems to transport proteins into the periplasmic
space and uses different approaches to move the proteins
through the outer membrane [53]. In H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1, the Sec system, which lacks a homologue to SecB,
is dispersed through the genome, as it is in other Helicobacter spp. [13,53] and the Tat system is composed of
three genes that are homologous to the TatABC traslocation proteins TatA (HBZC1_10870) and YatBC (HBZC1_
10370-10380) and a putative deoxyribonuclease that is
orthologous to H. pylori tatD (HBZC1_14750). Both of
the systems recognise an N-terminal signal peptide of the
protein that is required for translocation [53]. More than
200 proteins were predicted to have a Sec signal peptide
using the SignalP software [54] (data not shown). However, only 50 proteins, 22 of which harbour a signal peptide, appear to be located in the periplasmic space or
outside of the outer membrane, as predicted using the
PSORTb v3 tool [55] (Table 3). Nevertheless, the subcellular locations of more than 600 H. bizzozeronii CIII-1
proteins were not identified. Several proteins that share a
clear homology with excreted proteins in H. pylori were
predicted to be located in the cytoplasm, indicating that
the repertoire of secreted proteins in H. bizzozeronii
could be considerably different from what predicted
using PSORTb.
It has been shown in H. pylori that some proteins could
be exported from the cytoplasm to the extracellular
milieu or directly to the cytoplasm of the host through
Sec-independent secretion systems [53]. H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1 genome lacks orthologues of CagPAI that encode
a type IV secretion system responsible in H. pylori of the
translocation of the effector protein CagA into the cytosol of the host [23]. In addition to containing the secretion system that exports the flagella subunit across the
membrane, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 harbours a type IV
secretion systems derived from genes orthologues of
comB2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 that are organised in different operons dispersed throughout the genome (Figure
1; see additional file 1: Table S5). In H. pylori, the comB
components are required for uptake DNA by natural
transformation [56], and its orthologues likely encode
same function in H. bizzozeronii.
H. bizzozeronii is able to induce similar injuries in the
human gastric mucosa as is H. pylori, indicating that
both of the species express similar virulence factors.
Although VacA and CagA homologues are missing,

are present in the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome and
typically share a high degree of similarity. These virulence factors could contribute to the disease outcome
and include the following: the immunomodulator NapA
(HBC1_08880); the peptidyl propyl-cis,trans-isomerase
(HBZC1_06110), involved in the TLR4-dependent NFB and in AP1 activation of macrophages [57]; the
tumour necrosis factor alpha-inducing protein (Tipa,
HBZC1_02220), described in H. pylori as a carcinogenic
factor [58]; and the secreted serine protease (HtrA,
HBZC1_01610), which cleaves the ectodomain of the
cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin providing an access
to the intercellular space for H. pylori [59] (Figure 1). A
putative virulence factor in H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 that
does not have homologues in any H. pylori is HBZC1_
15820, encoding a polysaccharide lyase belonging to
Family 8 (Figure 1) [48]. A similar gene was found in the
genome of H. felis [16], but a homologue is absent in all
of the other sequenced ε-proteobacteria. Polysaccharide
lyases are eliminases that cleave acidic polysaccharides,
such as glycosaminoglycans, at specific glycosidic linkages [60]. Family 8 includes hyaluronate, chondroitin
AC/ABC and xanthan lyases that have been isolated from
several bacterial species, both non-pathogenic and pathogenic, including Bacillus spp., Penibacillus spp., Proteus
spp., Clostridium spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. [48]. In certain pathogenic species the polysaccharide lyases represent a virulence factor that is
important, for example in Staphylococcus aureus, in the
early stages of infections [61]. The role of this putative
polysaccharide lyase in both H. bizzozeronii and H. felis is
completely unknown and requires further study.
Genome plasticity

H. bizzozeronii is well adapted to colonise the stomach of
dogs [44] and has probably coevolved with its natural host,
as has been demonstrated for other gastric Helicobacter
species [1,14]. However, H. bizzozeronii is not strictly
restricted to the canine gastric mucosa but is able to colonise different hosts [2]. Therefore, when transferring from
dogs to humans, H. bizzozeronii necessarily undergoes
intensive changes to adapt to a new host. As is the case for
H. pylori [1], the ability of H. bizzozeronii for ongoing
host-adaptation is related to its high level of genome
plasticity.
The H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome lacks multiple genes
in the methyl-directed mismatch repair system (MMR),
similar to other ε-proteobacteria [13,62]. A consequence
of such a defect in the MMR is the formation and extension of multiple hypervariable simple sequence repeats
(SSRs), potentially responsible for the phase variation in
H. bizzozeronii. SSRs are subject to slipped-strand mutations, therefore inducing frameshift of the gene if the

Page 14 of 21

repeats are located in a protein-coding region or alteration
of the gene expression when the repeats affect the promoter [63]. It has been shown that the physiological role of
SSRs may not be limited to phase variation, but can
include reorganisation of the chromosome, influence on
protein structure and function, and possible antisense regulation [16,64,65]. A total of 80 SSRs, 71 of which are
homopolymeric runs of ≥9 units of a single nucleotide,
were detected dispersed across the H bizzozeronii CIII-1
genome, with 64 (the majority) located inside the coding
regions. The frames of 54 genes are affected by the
slipped-strand mispairing associated with SSRs. After the
exclusion of essential genes which are unlikely subjected
to phase variation by slipped-strand mispairing (i.e.,
tRNA-guanine transglycosylase, cell division protein FtsK,
DNA polymerase and spermidine synthase) we were able
to identify a total of 43 potentially phase-variable genes
(Table 4). Similar number of contingency genes was also
described in H. pylori [66], and, as observed in C. jejuni
and H. pylori, the dominant function of the contingency
genes in H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 is the modification at either
the protein or carbohydrate level of the surface architecture, suggesting that these structures play an important
role in the adaptation to different hosts [67,68].
The extreme genetic diversity observed among the
H. pylori strains appears to also be generated by horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) as a result of DNA recombination via
natural transformation [1]. Foreign DNA acquired by
HGT can be associated in bacteria with insertion sequence
(IS) elements or tRNA genes and can be identified by an
anomalous GC content or as a change of code usage [69].
The H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome harbours five IS elements, with two belonging to the IS200/IS605 family and
three to the IS607 family according to the semi-automatic
annotation system provided by the ISsaga tool [70]. Each
IS element includes two genes, the orfA and orfB transposases. In addition, H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 contains 22
almost identical mini-IS elements of 232 bp with ~98%
nucleotide identity uniformly distributed across the genome (Figure 1). The Mini-IS elements are vestigial remnants of full-length elements and have also been described
in H. pylori [71,72]. Although it is not known if any of
these elements have significant functional roles, the miniISs could be responsible for the alteration of the expression of some genes, and they may mediate HGT, thereby
contributing to the genetic diversity among H. bizzozeronii
strains.
Large inserts of laterally acquired DNA containing
functionally related genes are often referred to as genomic islands (GIs) and are typically associated with an
increased virulence [13]. The Island Viewer and Alien
Hunter programs were able to identify a putative GI of
~70 kb (41 GC %) in the H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 genome
from base 1,559,252 to 1,628,818 (Figure 1). The GI is

flanked by two IS elements and contains 77 CDSs (see
additional file 1: Table S6) of which a putative function
was assigned to 24 (31%). The H. bizzozeronii GI does
not include the type IV secretion system or known virulence factors, and some genes, such as conjugal transfer
protein (HBZC1_17110), replication A protein (HBZC1_
17000) and the plasmid partitioning protein ParA
(HBZC1_16910), appear originally have been plasmidrelated features. These results suggest that a transposition event may have been responsible for the integration
of a plasmid in the chromosome as already observed in
C. jejuni [73] and in H. pylori [74].
A putative self-replicating circular plasmid pHBZ1, 52
kb in length, was sequenced from H. bizzozeronii CIII-1
(FR871758). Among the 21 genes for which a putative
function was predicted (see additional file 1: Table S7), the
plasmid contains the following elements: two copies of an
aldo-keto reductase (HBZC1_p0200 and HBZC1_p0210),
a complete type I restriction modification system (from
HBZC1_p0340 to HBZC1_p0380), a protein containing
the HipA-domain (HBZC1_p0540; [75]) and two copies of
an adenine-specific methyltransferase (HBZC1_p0660 and
HBZC1_p0680). The distribution of this plasmid among
other H. bizzozeronii strains and its role in the adaption to
the host and pathogenesis are unknown and merit further
study.
Finally, immediately downstream of the H. bizzozeronii
GI, a putative prophage region of about 37 kb was identified using Prophage Finder program [76] and it harbours
several elements with homology to C. rectus RM3267
phage genes (Figure 1). However, excluding those involved
in the phage replication, the majority of the genes included
in the prophage region did not have any predictable
function.

repertoire of genes involved in metabolism and chemotaxis observed in H. bizzozeronii. Thus, is tempting to
speculate that the zoonotic nature of H. heilmannii s.l.
infection in humans is explicable by the high metabolic
versatility of these species which probably supports the
growth of the microorganisms in a wide range of niches.
Although H. bizzozeronii lacks orthologues of some
major H. pylori virulence genes, other candidate virulence factors are present. In particular, we identify a
polysaccharide lyase as a potential new virulence factor
of H. bizzozeronii. Efforts are ongoing to define molecular methods for H. bizzozeronii in order to provide
experimental evidence of the function of potential new
virulence factors involved in the developing of human
gastritis and MALT lymphoma.

Conclusion
In this study, a detailed comparative genomic analysis
between the human strain H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 and
H. pylori showed important differences between these two
human gastric pathogens, providing new insights into the
comprehension of the biology of gastric Helicobacter species. Although H. bizzozeronii possesses all genes necessary for its specialized life in the stomach, it differs from
H. pylori having a wider metabolic flexibility in term of
energy sources and electron transport chain. Moreover,
H. bizzozeronii genome harbours higher number of MCPs
compared to H. pylori, allowing the bacterium to respond
to a wider spectrum of environmental signals. The high
metabolic flexibility in combination with extraordinary
genome plasticity gives to H. bizzozeronii the ability to
easily move through several environments and adapt to
different hosts. This ability is probably a common feature
among all the species belong to H. heilmannii s.l. since
both H. felis and H. suis genomes harbours a similar

Genome sequencing and assembly

Methods
Cultivation, growth conditions and DNA extraction

The human H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 strain was isolated in
March 2008 from a 45-year-old Finnish female who was
suffering from severe dyspeptic symptoms and for whom
antrum and corpus biopsies revealed chronic active gastritis [8]. The strain was cultured on HP medium (LabM
Limited, Lancashire, UK) containing 5% of bovine blood
and Campylobacter selective supplement (Skirrow, Oxoid
Ltd., Cambridge, UK) for 4 days at 37°C in an incubator
with a microaerobic atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 5% O2
(Thermo Forma, Series II Water Jacketed Incubator;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA 02454 USA). The
high molecular-weight genomic DNA of H. bizzozeronii
was extracted as described before [8], and the genomic
DNA for the Solexa 5 kb mate pair library was extracted
using a ZR Fungal/Bacterial RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo
Research Co, Irvine, CA, USA).

The genome sequence of H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 was
obtained as described previously [17]. Briefly, a combination of 454 Titanium (43x genome coverage, 8 kb mate
pair library, performed by LGC Genomics GmbH, Berlin,
Germany) and Solexa (50 cycles, 132x coverage, 5 kb mate
pair library, performed by BaseClear BV, Leiden, The
Netherlands) was assembled into 2 scaffolds representing
a circular chromosome and a circular plasmid using the
MIRA 3.2.1, SSAKE and the Staden software package. The
assembly of the chromosome was validated by mapping to
a MluI optical map produced by OpGen Inc. (Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). The sequences were deposited in
the EMBL bank under the accession numbers FR871757
and FR871758.
Annotation and comparative genomic

For gene finding and automatic annotation, the sequences
were uploaded to the RAST server [77]. We further

Schott et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:534
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/534

analysed the coding sequences using the Artemis tool [78]
and manually re-annotated the genes of special interest.
The homologues were identified using NCBI’s BLAST
suite of programs with NCBI nr and nt and Swissprot as
reference databases. Two proteins with amino acid identity
greater than 40% over 80% sequence length were considered homologues. The conserved functional domains in
proteins were identified using the hmmer program on
Pfam database [79] as well as the InterProScan [80]. For
the prediction of glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases,
polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases, we
referred to the annotation available in the CAZy database
[48]. The metabolic pathways were reconstructed using
KEGG and SEED as reference databases [77,81]. The subcellular locations of proteins were predicted using the
PSORTb tool via the psort web server [82], and signal peptides were identified using SignalP [55], TatP [83] and
LipoP [84].
To identify the proteins unique to H. bizzozeronii as well
as the proteins found in H. pylori but missing in H. bizzozeronii, we determined the core genome of 10 H. pylori
strains (J99, 26695, B8, HPAG1, B38, P12, G27, Shi470,
SJM180 and PeCan4) using OrthoMCL with a BLAST Evalue cut-off of 1.0 e-6 and an inflation parameter 1.5 [85].
We compared the core genome with the H. bizzozeronii
CIII-1 genome, as previously described [86]. Briefly, based
on the all-against-all BLASTp results, the proteins were
clustered into groups of orthologues and recent paralogues. The proteins from H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 that did not
cluster with any H. pylori proteins were considered to be
specific to the species.
We identified the putative outer membrane proteins
using BLASTp against the OMP database [87] and a set of
known and categorised OMPs from H. pylori [42] using a
BLASTp score ratio cut-off of 0.4 [88]. For further classification the resulting set of proteins was combined with the
set of H. pylori OMPs and the phylogenetic relationships
were analysed as described previously [13].
The H. bizzozeronii CIII-1 chromosome was searched
for simple sequence repeats (SSRs) potentially involved in
slipped-strand misparing using Msatfinder [89]. The
thresholds for this study were as follows: mono (repeat
unit length), > 8 (threshold value of repeat units); di > 5;
tetra, penta, hexa and hepta, > 3. The positions of each of
the SSRs (intergenic or intragenic) were identified using
Artemis [78]. The lengths of all of the intragenic SSRs
were artificially modified to assess the likely significance of
the repeat-length variation on the expression of the associated reading frame.
The regions in the genome possibly acquired by horizontal gene transfer events as well as genomic islands
were predicted using Alien Hunter [46] and Island Viewer
[90], respectively. The potential prophage loci within the

Page 18 of 21

genome were predicted using the Prophage finder [76].
The possible IS elements were identified using the semiautomatic annotation system provided by ISsaga and were
manually checked [70].
