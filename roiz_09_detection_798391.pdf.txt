Abstract
The presence of DNA sequences integrated from a new flavivirus related to Cell Fusing Agent and
Kamiti River Virus was identified in wild Aedes albopictus mosquito populations from the provinces
of Trentino and Padova, Northern Italy. Field work was developed during August–October 2007
with BG-traps, and mosquitoes were screened for flavivirus and alphavirus. No alphavirus was
detected, indicating that Chikungunya virus is not present in these mosquitoes in Trentino and
Padova area. However, 21% of the pools were positive for flavivirus, further recognised with
BLAST as similar to Kamiti River Virus. Phylogenetical analysis with 708 nucleotides from the NS5
gene identified this virus as a new member of the insect flavivirus clade, together with others like
Kamiti River Virus, Cell Fusing Agent or Culex flavivirus, and in the group of those transmitted by
Aedes. Furthermore, the treatment with RNAse, indicated that this flavivirus should be integrated
in the genome of Ae. albopictus. These results propose that these sequences are transmitted by both
sexes, and with different prevalence in the studied populations, and support the idea of a
widespread distribution of integrated genomes in several mosquitoes from different areas, as first
demonstrated with Cell Silent Agent. Evolutionary implications of this discovery and application in
flavivirus phylogeny are discussed.

Findings
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a competent
vector of more than 20 arboviruses, such as Dengue, and
has been the principal vector of Chikungunya around the
Indian Ocean, India and recently Italy [1]. Apart from
Chikungunya, an outbreak of West Nile virus has been
reported in Northern Italy [2,3]. Within the genus Flavivirus, some viruses belonging to the insect flavivirus group
propagate only in mosquito cells and not in mammal

cells. They may represent a basal lineage of the genus that
diverged from other flaviviruses before the separation of
the mosquito- and tick-borne groups [4]. Cell Fusing
Agent virus (CFAV) isolated from Aedes aegypti and Kamiti
River virus (KRV), isolated from Aedes macintoshi [5], were
the first insect flaviviruses to be described. Culex flavivirus
(CxFV) was isolated from Culex pipiens in Japan and Indonesia [6], and from Culex quinquefasciatus in Guatemala
[7].

Recently, a DNA sequence named Cell Silent Agent (CSA),
related to the NS1-NS4A genes of CFAV and KRV, was
identified in an uninfected Ae. albopictus C6/36 cell line
and in wild and laboratory-bred mosquitoes from different areas of the world [8]. This mechanism for the capture
of genomic information from a non-retroviral RNA virus
is also described in other flaviviruses, such as Tick-Borne
Encephalitis virus [9]. Several flaviviruses, phleboviruses
and DNA sequences of insect flaviviruses have been
recently described in mosquitoes and sand flies from
Spain [10].
Mosquitoes were collected by BG-traps (BioGents, Germany) at Arco and Riva del Garda, (Trento) and Padova,
Italy, during August–October 2007. Each individual mosquito was identified and pooled according to species, sex,
locality and date with a maximum of 50 adults per pool.
A volume of 560 μl of AVL carrier/buffer RNA solution
(Qiagen) was added to each pool before being conserved
at -80°C. RNA was extracted with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen). A combination of West Nile virus (strain Eg101) and Ross River virus (strain T-48) was used as a positive control. A nested PCR was performed for all RNA
extracts using degenerate primers targeting flavivirus [11]
and alphavirus [12] in a Peltier Thermal cycler PCT-200
(MJ Research, Watertown, MA, USA). Positive PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit
and a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), the latter for
unspecific bands. Several samples were cloned with a
Topo-TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Amplified products
(143 bp for flavivirus, and 195 bp for alphavirus) were
further sequenced with ABI Prism BigDye Terminator
Cycle sequencer v3.1 ready reaction (Applied Biosystems)
and analyzed with the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis was carried out
with EditSeq and SeqMan software (DNASTAR Inc.). The
relatedness of these sequences to the databases was
assessed with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool,
implemented using the NCBI against the complete GenBank database.
A RT-PCR for the NS5 gene that codifies for the non-structural 5 protein (A. Vazquez, unpub. data) was used to clarify the phylogenetic relationships between the detected
flaviviruses. The phylogenetic analysis covered a region of
708 pb and 154 flavivirus sequences obtained from GenBank (Fig. 1). The neighbour-joining method and distance-p model were used to construct a tree with the
MEGA 3.1 software [13] with 1000 replications for
obtaining the bootstrap values. The phylogenetic tree (Fig.
1) was reconstructed using alignments of the amino acid
sequences and the nucleotide sequences.
In order to verify that positive pools were the result of
RNA amplification and not of integrated DNA, 5 μl from

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/93

different positive samples was digested with 2 μl of bovine
pancreas RNAse (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C
[10]. We applied a generic multiplex RT-nested-PCR for
flavivirus and phlebovirus with internal control of the
phlebovirus Toscana, derived from previously published
methods [10-12,14], and these treated extracts were
directly amplified without a previous retro-transcription
step. In a parallel analysis, each of these positive aliquots
was assayed by RT-nested-PCR for flavivirus using 5 μl of
untreated extracts to confirm that RNA was not degraded.
Out of the 969 mosquitoes collected, 727 (75%) were
females, distributed over a total of 32 pools of 3 to 50
individuals each (Table 1). None of the pools was positive
for alphavirus or West Nile, indicating that Chikungunya
and the West Nile virus were not present in these mosquitoes. However, 21% (a total of 7 pools) were positive for
flavivirus amplification and showed similarities with KRV
using BLAST software. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the
seven NS5 sequences using 154 homologous sequences of
flavivirus, with robustness bootstrap values, identified
this insect flavivirus as a new group; separate from KRV
and CFAV but in the same clade (Fig. 1). These results bore
strong similarities with other classifications [4] and confirmed the evolutionary relationship of this insect virus
with KRV and CFAV. The percentages of identity between
the sequences found in this study and KRV, CFAV and
CxFV were 73.3%, 72% and 62,1% respectively in nucleotides and 86.9%, 84.3% and 63.6% respectively at the
amino acidic level. Therefore, this virus clearly belongs to
the insect flavivirus clade, but is more closely related to
KRV and CFAV than to Culex flavivirus. As these sequences
could have been either RNA or DNA [8,10], further treatment with RNAse allowed for subsequent PCR amplification. The results showed that these sequences are DNA
molecules and not RNA and provide evidence for integration into the mosquito genome.
It has been suggested that the genus Flavivirus may include
a large number of species yet to be identified and several
of them could be insect flaviviruses, as proved by this
work and other recent field investigations in different
areas of the world [5-8,10,15]. Based on the data reported
in this study, we consider these sequences to be a new
group belonging to the insect flavivirus clade and integrated into the Ae. albopictus genome. The cluster of these
sequences, which are more closely related to insect flaviviruses associated with Aedes (CFAV, KRV) than to the Culex
flavivirus (CxFV), suggests that there is host-virus specificity within the insect flavivirus clade and that these groups
have evolved independently [6]. This result supports the
existence of several flavivirus-related sequences integrated
into the DNA of several mosquito species in several locations in the world, as well as the existence of several integration events [6,8]. Integration events have been

described only in Aedes species, but could also be
described in other genera, such as Culex, and other arthropods, such as ticks. These sequences could be integrated
into the genes of Ae. albopictus following infection by the
corresponding flavivirus (that has yet to be discovered),
and may be a source of evolution for Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, representing a different mechanism with which
genetic diversity may be generated in eukaryotic cells [8].
As mosquito-borne viruses are supposed to have evolved
from insect flavivirus, further analysis of these results and
of the other insect flaviviruses will help to clarify the
nature, origin and evolution of the flavivirus genus. It is
important to analyze more thoroughly whether the presence of insect flavivirus infecting Ae. albopictus and other
arthropod vectors could interfere with infection by other
arboviruses, subsequently altering the transmission capacity of certain vector populations for several vector-borne
diseases.
