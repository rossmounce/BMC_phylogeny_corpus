Abstract
Background: Bupleurum chinense DC. is a widely used traditional Chinese medicinal plant. Saikosaponins are the
major bioactive constituents of B. chinense, but relatively little is known about saikosaponin biosynthesis. The 454
pyrosequencing technology provides a promising opportunity for finding novel genes that participate in plant
metabolism. Consequently, this technology may help to identify the candidate genes involved in the saikosaponin
biosynthetic pathway.
Results: One-quarter of the 454 pyrosequencing runs produced a total of 195, 088 high-quality reads, with an
average read length of 356 bases (NCBI SRA accession SRA039388). A de novo assembly generated 24, 037 unique
sequences (22, 748 contigs and 1, 289 singletons), 12, 649 (52.6%) of which were annotated against three public
protein databases using a basic local alignment search tool (E-value ≤1e-10). All unique sequences were compared
with NCBI expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (237) and encoding sequences (44) from the Bupleurum genus, and with
a Sanger-sequenced EST dataset (3, 111). The 23, 173 (96.4%) unique sequences obtained in the present study
represent novel Bupleurum genes. The ESTs of genes related to saikosaponin biosynthesis were found to encode
known enzymes that catalyze the formation of the saikosaponin backbone; 246 cytochrome P450 (P450s) and 102
glycosyltransferases (GTs) unique sequences were also found in the 454 dataset. Full length cDNAs of 7 P450s and
7 uridine diphosphate GTs (UGTs) were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or by cloning
using 5’ and/or 3’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Two P450s and three UGTs were identified as the most likely
candidates involved in saikosaponin biosynthesis. This finding was based on the coordinate up-regulation of their
expression with b-AS in methyl jasmonate-treated adventitious roots and on their similar expression patterns with
b-AS in various B. chinense tissues.Conclusions
A collection of high-quality ESTs for B. chinense obtained by 454 pyrosequencing is provided here for the first time.
These data should aid further research on the functional genomics of B. chinense and other Bupleurum species. The
candidate genes for enzymes involved in saikosaponin biosynthesis, especially the P450s and UGTs, that were
revealed provide a substantial foundation for follow-up research on the metabolism and regulation of the
saikosaponins.

Background
Bupleurum chinense DC., a perennial herb native to
China, belongs to the Umbelliferae family and the genus
Bupleurum L. This herb is used worldwide for medicinal
purposes, but is especially common in China, Japan, and

South Korea [1]. In traditional Chinese medicine, the
roots of B. chinense and other Bupleurum species are
known as Chinese thorowax roots (Radix bupleuri), or
“chaihu” in Chinese. For more than 2, 000 years these
roots have been used for their anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and anti-hepatotoxic effects in the treatment of
common colds, fever, influenza, hepatitis, malaria, and
menoxenia [2,3]. The major bioactive components of
Radix bupleuri are the saikosaponins (SSs), which

belong to the oleanane-type triterpene saponins.
Although more than 75 monomer SSs have been isolated from Radix bupleuri [4,5], only SS-a, SS-b2, SS-c,
and SS-d have been pharmacologically examined [6-10],
because of the low SS content (usually ca. 1% w/w in
dried roots) [11]. Different monomer SSs have been
reported to exhibit different predominant pharmacological effects. For example, among the SSs isolated from B.
falcatum, SS-a and SS-d, but not SS-c, have anti-inflammatory activities [12]. Whereas SS-c has no correlation
with cell growth inhibition, other SSs can inhibit cell
growth, as well as induce cancer cell differentiation and
apoptosis. Hence, SS-c may have the potential for therapeutic angiogenesis, but is unsuitable for cancer therapy
[10]. Roots derived from various Bupleurum species
such as B. chinense, B. scorzonerifolium, B. falcatum,
and B. kaoi, have been widely used in various medicinal
decoctions. The content and proportion of the monomer SSs are extremely diverse in these medicinal materials. The concentration and composition of the SSs in
the roots is even more complex when studied in combination with diverse planting and harvesting environments and different management methods.
The ability to control the SS content of these medicinal materials by up-regulating the genes involved in the
biosynthesis of the different SS monomers or by using
bio-engineering techniques would greatly improve their
reliability. To be able to attempt this, an understanding
of SS biosynthesis is required [13]. The putative SS biosynthetic pathway in B. chinense is shown in Figure 1.
This pathway is based on previous studies on the biosynthetic pathway of other triterpene saponins in some
plant species [14,15], as well as the pathways of SSs in
B. falcatum [16] and B. kaoi [17]. The putative SS biosynthetic pathway initiates the isoprenoid pathway, mediates the cyclization of oxidosqualene, and then
undergoes some modifications of oxidation, glycosylation, and other secondary transformations. Finally, the
formation of the various monomer SSs is completed.
The cDNA of b-amylase (b-AS) that catalyzes the formation of b-amyrin has been cloned in B. kaoi [18], and
two different cDNAs that may encode different isoforms
of b-AS have been cloned in B. chinense. Recently, these
clones have been characterized in our laboratory
(unpublished). In our previous studies, the cDNAs that
encode enzymes involved upstream of the SS biosynthetic pathway in B. chinense have also been cloned
[19-21]]. The biosynthetic pathways of the other saponins are not fully understood. Similarly, the reactions
downstream of the SS biosynthetic pathway after the
cyclization of b-amyrin remain largely unknown. One
proposal involves oxidization/hydroxylation and glycosyl
transfer catalyzed by specific cytochrome P450s and uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs),

respectively [14,22,23]]. To date, no P450 or UGT genes
involved in SS biosynthesis have been identified in B.
chinense or in other SS-producing plants. To the best of
our knowledge, only a few P450s and UGTs have been
verified to be involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid
saponins [24-28]; recent reviews in [29,30]]. This situation is inconsistent with the fact that saponins are
widely distributed in plants [31]. The biosynthetic pathway of the saponins still has to be clarified.
Studies have shown that the sequencing and analysis
of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), combined with
genetic and phytochemical methods are effective tools
for discovering novel genes in non-model plants
[32-34]]. Some genes involved in natural product biosynthetic pathways have been identified via EST analyses
[24-26,28,35,36]]. The 454 pyrosequencing technique,
with its advantages of throughput, read length, and
accuracy, can greatly accelerate the discovery of novel
genes in non-model organisms [37-39]]. Candidate
genes involved in the metabolic pathways of natural products have been identified using the 454 pyrosequencing
technique. These natural products usually have diverse
and important functions in plant growth, and are also
invaluable as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Examples of such important natural products include triterpene saponins in American ginseng [15] and
Glycyrrhiza uralensis [40], flavonoids in Artemisia
annua [41], alkaloids in Huperzia serrata and Phlegmariurus carinatus [42], and cyanogenic glucosides in
Zygaena filipendulae [43]. The specific functions of the
candidate genes reported in the abovementioned studies
are still being validated. Even so, the 454 pyrosequencing is still the preferred choice for novel gene discovery, especially for members of known gene families.
In the present study, 195, 088 high-quality (HQ) reads
from a cDNA library of B. chinense were obtained using
the Roche GS FLX Titanium platform. The reads were
assembled into 24, 037 unique sequences comprising
22, 748 contigs and 1, 289 singletons. Only 864 ESTs
were identical with those derived from the 3, 111 ESTs
generated in our previous study from a B. chinense root
cDNA library using the Sanger sequencing method [19]
and the Bupleurum sequences from NCBI. A total of
246 P450s and 102 glycosyltransferases (GTs) including
49 UGTs were screened. The assembled full-length
cDNAs of the P450s and UGTs were verified. Several
partial cDNAs of the P450s and UGTs were extended
to full length by 5’ and/or 3’ rapid amplification of
cDNA ends (RACE). The candidate P450s and UGTs
that may participate in SS biosynthesis were screened
via methyl jasmonate (MeJA) inducibility and tissue-specific expression pattern experiments. These P450s and
UGTs will be the targets of further research on SS
biosynthesis.

seeds, and seedlings. A total of 195, 088 HQ reads with
an average sequence length of 356 bp were obtained

singletons), equal to 13.8 Mb of sequence data, had an
average length of 576 bp with a range of 43-2, 756 bp.
The sequencing and assembly statistics are shown in
Table 1. The size distribution of the consensuses is
shown in Figure 2.
Functional annotation

The assembled 24, 037 unique sequences were successively compared with the sequences in three major public protein databases (KEGG, Nr, and UniProt) using the
basic local alignment search tool X (BLASTX) algorithm
with an E-value cutoff of < 10 -10 . A total of 12, 649
unique sequences, accounting for 52.6% of the total
unique sequences, were annotated (See additional file 1:
Summary of the annotation of the 454 assembled
unique B. chinense sequences). In our previous study, a
total of 3, 111 cDNA clones derived from a B. chinense
root cDNA library were 5’ single-pass-sequenced using
the Sanger sequencing method [19]. In the present
study, the unique sequences obtained via 454 pyrosequencing were compared with the 3, 111 ESTs and with
an additional 237 ESTs downloaded from GenBank. The
unique sequences were also compared with the 44
Bupleurum protein-encoded sequences from GenBank.

Only 864 unique sequences from the 454 dataset overlapped with other ESTs. Therefore, the 454 dataset must
contain thousands of novel genes for the genus
Bupleurum (Figure 3).
A sum of 10, 734 (44.7%) of the total unique sequences
were further annotated based on their similarity with
The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) proteins,
before gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned. The
categories of molecular function, biological process, and
cellular component are shown in additional file 2: Functional annotations of the 454 unique sequences of B.
chinense based on GO categories. A high percentage of
the unique sequences were annotated to hydrolases,
kinases, and transferases in the molecular function category. For the biological process category, a large number
of genes were annotated to metabolic processes,
response to abiotic or biotic stimulus, and response to
stress. Hence, the 454 dataset should substantially aid
the discovery of novel genes involved in the metabolism
of SSs and other secondary natural products. A total of
10, 277 unique sequences were annotated using KEGG;
2, 849 of them were related to metabolism, 36 to the
metabolism of terpenoids polyketides, and 101 to the
biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (see additional file 3: Summary of metabolic pathway assignments of the 454 assembled unique sequences based on
KEGG).
Candidate genes related to SS backbone biosynthesis

Similar to other triterpene glycoside pathways, the SS
biosynthetic pathway is generally divided into three
stages (Figure 1). The first stage is the formation of
the isoprene units isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)
and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), the second
is the formation of the triterpene skeleton (b-amyrin),
and the third stage is the modification of the skeleton.

Figure 3 Comparison of the 454 EST dataset and other EST datasets obtained for the genus Bupleurum. The overlapping section
represents the ESTs that are present in the two datasets.

Based on our current knowledge, no definite sequence
features can be used to identify the specific P450s and
UGTs involved in the modification of the triterpene
skeleton. Therefore, the unique sequences that were
annotated as responsible for the formation of the SS
backbones in the first two stages of the pathway were
first screened. As shown in Table 2, except for mevalonate-5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD), the putative
genes that encode all the enzymes for the biosynthesis
of SS backbones were found. Triterpenoids are generally considered to be formed in the cytoplasm via the
mevalonate (MVA) pathway. However, recent reports
have demonstrated that the cytosolic MVA pathway
and the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP)
pathway may mutually communicate through the regulatory role of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPPI),
which maintains the appropriate levels of IPP and
DMAPP in the cytoplasm and plastids [44,45]. Consequently, three putative genes that encode the enzymes
involved in the MEP pathway were also searched for
and found in the 454 dataset. These genes were DXP
reductoisomerase (DXPS; EC 1.1.1.267), MEP cytidylyltransferase (MEPCT; EC 2.7.7.60), and 4-hydroxy-3methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase (GcpE/IspG;
EC 1.17.7.1).

Full-length cDNA cloning of P450s and UGTs

The P450s constitute one of the biggest gene families in
plant genomes, accounting for more than 1% of the
total gene annotations in each plant species [22]. In our
unique sequences, a total of 239 contigs and 7 singletons were annotated as P450s accounting for about
1.02% of the 24, 037 unique sequences (see additional
file 4: Putative P450 and GT genes in the 454 dataset).
According to the best-hit description in the annotation
databases, the P450s encoded by these unique sequences
were classified into 30 families and 44 subfamilies; four
of the P450s were unclassified (see additional file 5:
Summary of family classification of the annotated P450s
from the 454 assembled unique sequences). Two annotated full-length P450s were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Three
P450s that had single terminals in the 454 dataset, and
two P450s derived from our previous cDNA library,
were extended by RACE PCR. As a result, seven fulllength P450s were obtained. The seven full-length P450s
were further analyzed using BLASTX in NCBI. The
deduced amino acid sequences were aligned with homologous Arabidopsis thaliana P450s and some functionidentified P450s from other species. A neighbor-joining
tree was constructed based on the alignment (Figure 4).

The seven P450s were named by Nelson [46] as
BcCYP82T1,
BcCYP90D18,
BcCYP707A67,
BcCYP716A41, BcCYP736A53, BcCYP736A54, and
BcCYP712F1.
GTs are a superfamily of enzymes in plants. GTs catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor
molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds. Currently, there are 92 families and some
non-classified sequences at the superfamily level http://
www.cazy.org/GlycosylTransferases.html. Glycosylation
is one of the major factors that determine the bioactivity
and bioavailability of natural plant products, such as flavonoids and terpenoids.
The GTs that are responsible for the glycosylation of
natural products are members of the family 1 GTs, the
UGTs [23]. In our unique sequences, there were 102
annotated GTs (see additional file 4: Putative P450 and
GT genes in the 454 dataset) of which 49 were UGTs.
All the GTs were classified into 14 categories according
to the GO term assignment (see additional file 6: Classification of the candidate glycosyltransferase/glucosyltransferase genes). Two full-length UGTs were verified
by RT-PCR. Four partial UGTs from the 454 dataset
and one UGT derived from our previous cDNA library
were extended by RACE PCR, resulting in seven fulllength UGTs tentatively named BcUGT1, BcUGT2,
BcUGT3, BcUGT4, BcUGT5, BcUGT6, and BcUGT7.
The deduced amino acid sequences of these seven
UGTs were aligned with some UGTs from other species,
and a neighbor-joining tree was constructed based on
the alignment (Figure 5). The UGTs from the other
plant species were selected based on the BLASTX
results for the seven UGTs cloned in the present study.
Most of these UGTs were function identified. GmSGT2
(AB473730) and MtGT3 (FJ477891) were identified with
functions in the biosynthesis of saponins.
AsUGT709A10 (EU496501) and CsUGT4 (GQ221689)
may be involved in the formation of triterpenoids and
monoterpenoids, respectively, because both were registered in GenBank and relevant unpublished papers. The
others were identified as flavonoid GTs. Although the
functions of a UGT cannot be deduced from the
sequence alignment alone, the functions of BcUGT3
(JF803819) and BcUGT6 (JF803822) were first verified
in the course of SS-related UGT identification. Both of
these UGTs had high sequence similarities with previously identified terpene GTs.
Expression characteristics of P450s and UGTs

The pentacyclic triterpenoid SSs are considered to be
synthesized using b-amyrin as a substrate via a series of
reactions thought to be catalyzed by P450s and UGTs.
MeJA is known to induce the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites, such as ginsenoside [47,48] and SSs

Page 7 of 16

[17,49]. MeJA also up-regulates metabolite-related
enzyme genes [50]. The expression of genes involved in
SS skeleton biosynthesis has not been studied in MeJA
treatment experiments. However, the expression of b-AS
is up-regulated with increased accumulation of SSs in
the hairy roots of B. falcatum using altered culture
media [16]. Therefore, in the present study, MeJA-treated adventitious roots of B. chinense were used to investigate the expression of b-AS, and to screen the putative
P450s and UGTs involved in SS biosynthesis. Based on
the classifications and read abundances, a total of 14
P450s and 20 UGTs were selected for MeJA inducibility
analyses using real-time PCR with actin as the internal
reference gene. All selected P450s belonged to the two
clans, CYP71 and CYP85, that include all known triterpenes and sterol hydroxylases. As shown in Figure 6, bAS expression increased about fourfold in MeJA-treated
adventitious roots compared with in the control. All
P450s and UGTs assayed were up-regulated by MeJA,
whereas the elevated fold expressions of four P450s and
eight UGTs were more than that of b-AS. Therefore, the
four P450s (P450-4, P450-5, P450-7, and P450-12) and
the eight UGTs (UGT-1, UGT-3, UGT-5, UGT-6, UGT11, UGT-15, UGT-19, and UGT-20) were further
assayed for their tissue-specific expression patterns.
Five tissues, roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits,
were used to analyze the tissue-specific expression patterns of the abovementioned four P450s and eight
UGTs. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using btubulin as the internal reference gene. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the expression patterns of two P450s
(P450-7 and P450-12) and three UGTs (UGT-3, UGT-5,
and UGT-15) showed strong similarities with that of bAS. P450-12 was obtained from our previous cDNA
library. P450-7, UGT-3, UGT-5, and UGT-15 were all
obtained from the 454 dataset. The sequence similarity
results suggest that UGT-3 and UGT-5 are members of
the UGT85 family, whereas UGT-15 belongs to the
UGT76 family. These P450s and UGTs can be considered as candidate genes encoding enzymes responsible
for SS biosynthesis, and require further study.

Discussion
The 454 pyrosequencing technology is regarded as a
prime choice for novel gene discovery in non-model
organisms. In the present study, this technology was
applied with the main goal of identifying the P450s and
UGTs involved in the biosynthesis of SSs in B. chinense.
In previous reports, CYP93E1 from Glycine max was
shown to hydroxylate b-amyrin and sophoradiol with
the formation of olean-12-ene-3b, 24-diol, and soyasapogenol B, respectively [24]. CYP88D6 from Glycyrrhiza
uralensis was identified as a b-amyrin 11-oxidase [25].

[26,27] and UGT74M1 from Saponaria vaccaria [28]
have been identified to be involved in triterpene biosynthesis. Thus far, no P450 or UGT were identified in
SS-producing plant species. All known triterpenes and
sterol hydroxylases have been classified into the CYP71
and CYP85 clans [24,25,51,52]. In our 454 dataset, 114
unique sequences in 8 families and 52 unique sequences
in 4 families belong to the CYP71 and CYP85 clans,

respectively. Of these 49 were UGTs representing nine
families, namely, UGT71, UGT72, UGT73, UGT74,
UGT76, UGT84, UGT85, UGT91, and UGT94. Our
data provide a promising opportunity for identifying the
P450s and UGTs involved in SS biosynthesis. In the present study, 14 unique sequences of P450s and 20 UGTs
were screened. Two P450s and three UGTs that may be
involved in the biosynthesis of SSs, based on MeJA

inducibility and tissue-specific expression patterns, were
found. They are currently being identified by their heterologous expression in Escherichia coli or yeast, as well
as by their overexpression and gene silencing in transgenic B. chinense plants. More candidate SS-related
P450s and UGTs may be found among the annotated
P450s and UGTs. Along with the identified P450s and
UGTs, our results may also be helpful in revealing the
formation mechanism of diverse monomer SSs and in
elucidating other saponin biosynthetic pathways.
In the present study, the full-length cDNA clones of
seven P450s and seven UGTs were obtained. Two of the
P450s belong to the CYP736 family and the other five
P450s belong to the CYP82, CYP712, CYP90, CYP707,
and CYP716 families. The catalytic function of the
CYP736 family is still unknown. Recent reports have
shown that CYP736B in grapes may be involved in the
host response to Xylella fastidiosa infection [53].
CYP736A34 in soybean is also highly co-expressed with
genes involved in root and Rhizobium-induced nodule
development [[54]; review in [55]]. CYP82 and CYP712
are part of the CYP71 clan family. Some members of
the CYP82 family were found to mediate plant-specific
alkaloid pathways, for example, CYP82E4 and
CYP82E5v2 in tobacco were identified with nicotine Ndemethylase activity [56,57]. Arabidopsis CYP82C2 and
CYP82C4 are 8-methoxypsoralen hydroxylases that

mediate modifications of toxic furanocoumarin [58].
However, a recent study has shown that CYP82G1 functions in the terpene pathway as a DMNT/TMTT (C11homoterpene (E)-4, 8-dimethyl-1, 3, 7-nonatriene/C16homoterpene (E, E)-4, 8, 12-trimethyltrideca-1, 3, 7, 11tetraene) homoterpene synthase [59]. CYP712 and the
CYP93s may catalyze successive steps in the same pathway(s) in different plants [55]. One of the CYP93s,
CYP93E1, was found to participate in the triterpene
pathway [24]. CYP90, CYP707, and CYP716 are part of
the CYP85 clan family. CYP90 is the first family of
CYPs required for brassinosteroid synthesis. CYP90Bs,
-As, -Ds, and -Cs successively act in the brassinosteroid
pathway [60,55]. The CYP707s inactivate ABA via 8’hydroxylation to form phaseic acid, and thereby, play a
key role in the regulation of ABA-mediated physiological processes [61]. The CYP716s do not have a known
function, but their closest non-plant relatives, CYP26As,
are involved in the hydroxylation of retinoic acid [55].
Based on sequence similarity, CYP716 was close to
CYP725 in the neighbor-joining tree (Figure 4). A previous study using a broader range of plants also showed
some overlap in CYP716 and CYP725. This overlap is
evidence of the extensive divergence occurring within
this subset of genes in the CYP85 clan. CYP725A has
been shown to act on taxane diterpenoids [60]. However, it is still unclear whether these two families share

similar functions. The seven UGTs for which full-length
cDNAs were generated in the present study have
sequence similarities with members of different UGT
families. This finding implied that the UGTs identified
in the present study may be members of these different
UGT families. Based on the neighbor-joining tree (Figure 5), BcUGT3 was found to be close to members of
the UGT73 family, in particular to GmSGT2
(UGT73P2), MtGT3 (UGT73F3) and GeGT (UGT73F1);
BcUGT6 was close to a UGT709 member. BcUGT2 and
BcUGT7 were also close to UGT73 members and to
other UGTs without definite family ascriptions.
BcUGT1 was close to a UGT90 member. Previous studies [62,63] have indicated that UGT73 and UGT90
belong to the same orthologous group, OG1 [63].
UGT73B2 was shown to exhibit flavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase activity [64], UGT73A7 has been reported to
exhibit 4, 2’, 4’, 6’-tetrahydroxy chalcone 4’-glucosyltransferase activity [65], and UGT90A7 was shown to
exhibit luteolin 4’/7-O-glucosyltransferase activity [66].

BcUGT4 and BcUGT5 may belong to the UGT94 family
because they have sequence similarities with UGT94s.
Previous studies have shown that UGT94D1 has UDPglucose: sesaminol 2’-O-glucoside-O-glucosyltransferase
activity and UGT94F1 has anthocyanin 3-O-glucoside2’’-O-glucosyltransferase activity [67]. Although the definite functions of the seven P450s and seven UGTs from
B. chinense identified in the present study still have to
be verified by further experiments, the isolation of their
full-length cDNAs will be significant for elucidating
their biofunctions in the growth and development of B.
chinense.
The biosynthesis and regulation of bioactive components was the main focus of the present study on B. chinense. In addition to SSs isolated from members of the
genus Bupleurum that exhibit pharmacological activity,
several other groups of secondary metabolites with relevant biological activity have been characterized, for
example, polysaccharides with anti-ulcer activity and lignans with anti-proliferative activity [68]. Genes involved

in polysaccharides and lignans were searched for in the
present 454 dataset. For example, enzymes encoded by
genes related to polysaccharides include (1, 3)-beta-Dglucan synthase, alpha-1, 6-xylosyltransferase, alpha-(1,
4)-galacturonosyltransferase, xylan 1, 4-beta-xylosidase,
etc. [69] and enzymes encoded by the genes related to
lignans, are phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4hydroxylase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, hydroxycinnamoyl
CoA: shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase,
caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, isoeugenol synthase,
and dirigent protein oxidase [70]. Therefore, the present
454 dataset is valuable not only in the exploration of
genes involved in SS biosynthesis, but also for the discovery of genes involved in other bioactive secondary
metabolites derived from the genus of Bupleurum. Additionally, the agronomical traits of B. chinense, such as
drought resistance, have been investigated [71,72]. In
our 454 dataset, 2, 933 and 3, 280 unique sequences
were annotated as related to responses to abiotic or

biotic stimulus and to stress, respectively. These annotations were based on the GO terms. These sequence data
may be beneficial to further molecular studies on the
stress response of B. chinense. Further, a total of 415
and 209 unique sequences were annotated with transcription factor activity and signal transduction, respectively. Some of these sequences may play roles in
regulating SS metabolism and the stress response. These
unique sequences deserve to be cloned and functionally
analyzed in future studies.
Currently the 454 pyrosequencing technology is considered as a rapid and economical method to generate
high-quantity sequence data. Although a large number
of 454 reads were obtained by a quarter run in the present study, nearly a quarter of the ESTs from the Sanger-sequenced 3, 111 clones from our previous cDNA
library were not sequenced. The different cDNA
libraries (the Sanger sequenced root cDNA library and
the 454 sequenced combined cDNA library with roots,

Sui et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:539
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/539

seeds, and seedlings) and the fact that only the 5’ end of
the cDNA was sequenced in the Sanger sequencing may
explain, to some extent, this difference. In some reports
that compared 454 pyrosequencing and traditional Sanger sequencing, bias was found because of differences in
the two sequencing methods [73]. Combinations of
these two methods have been used in some studies: (1)
to generate a high number of good-quality ESTs with
improved clustering analysis and with more full-length
sequences [73]; (2) to obtain a less biased method for
the identification and diversity analysis of microbes and
fungi [74,75]; and (3) to assemble genome sequences
[76]. Recently, Radix bupleuri has aroused global interest, especially in Europe [review in [68]]. However, studies on the molecular biology of Bupleurum are still
limited. More transcriptome data will facilitate a deeper
understanding and enable the rapid development of
Radix bupleuri applications.

Conclusions
In the present study, a 454 dataset of B. chinense was
analyzed. These data represent a substantial contribution
to the functional genetic studies of B. chinense. The
identification of enzymes involved in SS biosynthesis
may enable the regulation and improvement of SS production levels in plants or in microbial hosts by metabolic engineering. Almost all of the known genes that
encoded enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the SS
backbones were explored. A total of 246 P450 and 102
GT unique sequences containing 49 UGTs were
obtained. These sequences will be invaluable to the elucidation of the SS biosynthetic pathway and to the
exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying the
biosynthesis of different monomer SSs. The full-length
cDNAs of seven of the P450s and seven of the UGTs
from our present 454 dataset and previous Sanger’s
sequencing data were cloned using the RACE method.
This procedure may help in elucidating the functions of
the P450s and UGTs. MeJA inducibility and tissue-specific expression pattern experiments were used to screen
two P450s and three UGTs that may be involved in SS
biosynthesis.
Methods
Plant material and adventitious root preparation

The roots of one-year old plants of “Zhongchai No. 1”, a
mass-selected cultivar of B. chinense field-grown in
IMPLAD, were collected during the flowering stage
because more SSs were found to be contained in the
roots during this period [77]. Further, a previous study
showed that the SS-d and SS-c content significantly
changed in germinating seeds and the content of SS-d
peaked on the fourth day [78]. Hence, to acquire a high
number of unique candidate genes involved in SS

Page 12 of 16

biosynthesis the experimental material used in the present study was 4-day geminating seeds, 12-day seedlings,
and the roots of one-year-old Zhongchai No. 1 plants
during flowering. The germination was performed in
germination boxes under 25°C/15°C, 8L/16D conditions.
Before germination, the seeds were soaked for 24 h in
tap water, which was changed four times. After harvest,
all materials were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored in a -80°C freezer for RNA extraction.
To analyze the MeJA inducibility of P450s and UGTs,
the adventitious roots of Zhongchai No. 1 were cultivated as described earlier [79]. Similar to the results of
our previous experiment, the SS content was approximately doubled in 8 h MeJA-treated (200 μM, dissolved
in ethanol) adventitious roots of B. chinense, assayed by
high performance liquid chromatography [80]. MeJA
(200 μM) was then added to the cultivation media; an
equal quantity of ethanol was used as the control. After
8 h, the treated and control adventitious roots were collected and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen for
RNA extraction. For the tissue-specific expression pattern experiments, five tissues (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits) were collected and similarly restored as
described in our previous report [81].
RNA extraction, cDNA library construction and 454
sequencing

Total RNA was isolated using an RNA purification kit
(Norgen Biotek Corp., ON, Canada). RNA purity and
degradation were checked on 1% agarose gels. Equivalent RNAs from roots, germinating seeds, and seedlings
were pooled. Approximately 1 μg of RNA was reverse
transcribed using a Super SMART™ PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View,
CA, USA). This kit was used in combination with a
modified poly (T) primer to overcome the limitation of
long poly (A/T) tails in cDNA for the 454 sequencing
[15]. Double-stranded (ds) cDNA was synthesized using
an Advantage® 2 PCR kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.)
and was then digested overnight with BsgI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The ds cDNA was
finally purified using a PureLink™ PCR purification kit
(Invitrogen Life Science Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). About 5 μg of ds cDNA was sent to the Roche
454 Company (Branford, CT, USA) for pyrosequencing
using a GS FLX titanium kit.
The 454 EST assembly and annotation

A pretreatment process that involved trimming the
adapter and poly (A/T), as well as removing short
sequence (< 50 bp) and low quality files (quality score
threshold = 20) was performed. The Mira 3.0.5 software
was used for sequence assembly using the default parameters. Reads that did not fit into a contig were defined

Sui et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:539
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/539

as singletons. A total of 195, 088 HQ reads assembled in
22, 748 contigs and 1, 289 singletons were finally
obtained for further functional annotation with the
BLASTX program. The databases KEGG http://www.
genome.jp/kegg/, Nr http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, and
UniProt http://www.expasy.ch/sprot were used for the
search. GO terms were assigned to the assembled
unique genes based on similarities with A. thaliana protein sequences (TAIR9, http://www.arabidopsis.org). A
cut-off value of E < 1.0 -10 was used in all BLASTX
searches. The newly assembled unique genes were compared against the Bupleurum EST/protein encoding
sequences in GenBank. The ESTs were derived from a
B. chinense root cDNA library that was sequenced by
our group using an ABI 3730 sequencer [19].
Searching for candidate genes involved SS biosynthesis

The candidate genes HMGR, IPPI, FPS, SQS, SE, b-AS,
P450, and UGT that are known to be involved in the
biosynthesis of SSs were searched for within the text of
the annotated unique genes based on their gene names
and synonyms. The items from different annotation
databases that were repeated were manually erased.
Full-length cDNA verification and cloning of P450s and
UGTs

The assembled full-length P450 and UGT cDNA
sequences were verified by RT-PCR. Some partial
sequences were extended to full length using 5’ and/or
3’ RACE. The amino acid sequence alignments of the
full-length P450 and UGT cDNAs were created in
MEGA 4 using CLUSTALW with default settings. Phylogenetic neighbor-joining trees were constructed and
bootstrapped with 1000 iterations in MEGA 4. Corresponding sequences from other plants with the most
similarity to each full-length P450 and UGT cDNA
(obtained both in our present and previous studies) [19]
were identified and downloaded from GenBank. These
sequences were used for the alignments and tree
constructions.
Real-time PCR analysis

Actin was chosen as the internal reference gene for the
real-time PCR gene expression analysis of MeJA-treated
B. kaoi [17]. Similar to our previous report, b-tubulin
was the most suitable reference gene for the real-time
PCR analysis of tissue-specific gene expression patterns
in B. chinense [81]. According to one of our previous
experiments (data unpublished), EF1a was also a suitable internal reference gene for real-time PCR analysis in
MeJA-treated B. chinense. In the present study, the suitability of actin, b-tubulin, and EF1a as internal reference genes in the MeJA-treated adventitious roots of B.
chinense was first determined. Based on the results (see

Page 13 of 16

additional file 7: Screening of internal reference genes
for real-time PCR analysis of MeJA inducibility), actin
was selected as the internal reference gene for the MeJA
inducibility experiment. For the tissue-specific expression pattern experiment, b-tubulin was selected as the
internal reference gene based on our previous research
[81]. All real-time PCR analyses were performed according to our previous report [81] with the following modifications: the RNA was extracted using an RNA
purification kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.); the quantification
of cDNA was performed on a NanoDrop ND 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA); and a SYBR® PrimeScript® RT-PCR kit
II (Perfect Real-Time; TAKARA Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan)
was used for the reverse transcription and real-time
PCR. Two-step amplification conditions were used: 3
min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, and 20 s at 58°C.
For the analyses of the tissue-specific expression patterns, the expression in the root was arbitrarily chosen
as the calibrator for each gene. For the MeJA inducibility experiment, the expression of each gene in the control was used as the calibrator. All primers used are
listed in additional file 8: The primers used in the present study.
