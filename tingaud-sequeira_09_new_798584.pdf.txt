Abstract
Background: The Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) is a marine flatfish of increasing commercial interest. However,
the reproduction of this species in captivity is not yet controlled mainly because of the poor knowledge on its
reproductive physiology, as it occurs for other non-salmonid marine teleosts that exhibit group-synchronous ovarian
follicle development. In order to investigate intra-ovarian molecular mechanisms in Senegalese sole, the aim of the
present study was to identify differentially expressed genes in the ovary during oocyte growth (vitellogenesis), maturation
and ovarian follicle atresia using a recently developed oligonucleotide microarray.
Results: Microarray analysis led to the identification of 118 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 20 and 8 were
monitored by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization, respectively. During vitellogenesis, many up-regulated ovarian
transcripts had putative mitochondrial function/location suggesting high energy production (NADH dehydrogenase
subunits, cytochromes) and increased antioxidant protection (selenoprotein W2a), whereas other regulated transcripts
were related to cytoskeleton and zona radiata organization (zona glycoprotein 3, alpha and beta actin, keratin 8),
intracellular signalling pathways (heat shock protein 90, Ras homolog member G), cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix
interactions (beta 1 integrin, thrombospondin 4b), and the maternal RNA pool (transducer of ERBB2 1a, neurexin 1a).
Transcripts up-regulated in the ovary during oocyte maturation included ion transporters (Na+-K+-ATPase subunits),
probably required for oocyte hydration, as well as a proteinase inhibitor (alpha-2-macroglobulin) and a vesicle calcium
sensor protein (extended synaptotagmin-2-A). During follicular atresia, few transcripts were found to be up-regulated,
but remarkably most of them were localized in follicular cells of atretic follicles, and they had inferred roles in lipid
transport (apolipoprotein C-I), chemotaxis (leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2,), angiogenesis (thrombospondin), and
prevention of apoptosis (S100a10 calcium binding protein).
Conclusion: This study has identified a number of differentially expressed genes in the ovary that were not previously
found to be regulated during ovarian development in marine fish. Specifically, we found evidence, for the first time in
teleosts, of the activation of chemoattractant, angiogenic and antiapoptotic pathways in hypertrophied follicular cells at
the onset of ovarian atresia.

Background
Our understanding of the molecular pathways underlying
reproductive processes and oogenesis in vertebrates is still
limited even in mammalian models. Teleosts show the
most diversified reproductive strategies among vertebrates
making it even more difficult to uncover the underlying
molecular mechanisms. In addition, several factors can
modulate the reproductive processes of teleost fish such as
photoperiod and temperature [1,2], nutrition [3], captivity [4] and endocrine disruptors [5,6]. Accordingly, most
studies to date on female teleosts have mainly investigated the effect of these conditions on the circulating sex
hormone levels or the reproductive success in terms of
spawning performance (e.g., fecundity, egg and larval survival). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
involved still remain poorly understood.
The development of methods for large-scale gene expression analysis (e.g., microarrays) in model fish species,
such as the zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as in salmonids
is improving our knowledge of the molecular basis of
ovarian physiology in teleosts [7]. In the zebrafish, cDNAand oligo-based microarrays have been employed to
assess the transcriptome profile of differentiating and
adult gonads. These studies have identified a number of
genes involved in mitochondrial organization and biogenesis, cell growth and maintenance, and germ-line differentiation, as well as some with sexually dimorphic coexpression in both the gonads and the brains [8-10]. Mass
sequencing of zebrafish expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
from the ovary [11], or from isolated fully-grown ovarian
follicles through serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)
[12], has also discovered germ cell-specific genes and
established the complete sequence data set of maternal
mRNA stored in oocytes at the end of oogenesis. In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and coho salmon (O. kisutch), cDNA microarrays printed on slides or nylon
membranes, as well as reciprocal suppression subtractive
hybridization (SSH), were used to investigate changes in
the ovarian transcriptome during primary growth and
maturation and bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced
ovarian apoptosis [13-17]. These studies revealed changes
in the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, immunoregulation, apoptosis, cell cycling, and in different
endocrine and paracrine systems, which might be important during ovarian development. The control of ovulation by either hormonal induction or photoperiod
manipulation has also been shown to induce differences
in the egg mRNA abundance of specific genes, which may
affect their developmental competence [18].
However, despite the significant information obtained
from zebrafish and salmonids, no data is currently available on the changes of the transcriptome during ovarian

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

development in other marine teleosts, such as flatfish,
some of which are of economical importance. Particularly, little is known on the molecular pathways involved
in ovarian follicular atresia, a degenerative and resorptive
process of ovarian follicles that determines fecundity in
both natural and captive conditions [19-22]. The use of
functional genomics approaches would contribute with
the identification of molecular signatures associated with
abnormal ovarian development or premature ovarian
regression in cultured fish species, thus providing potentially useful markers to control sexual maturation.
The Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis, is a marine flatfish
of high commercial value in Southern Europe and Asia
[23]. However, the industrial production of this species is
largely based on wild breeders after long periods of acclimation to captivity, and reproduction is not yet controlled
[26]. The F1 generation of fish raised in captivity often fail
to reproduce naturally because egg fertilization is dramatically reduced [24,25]. In some F1 females, an increased
ovarian follicle atresia and/or dysfunctions of the ovulatory process might also occur, but no precise studies have
been performed to clarify this phenomenon. In order to
obtain information on the molecular basis of ovarian
development in Senegalese sole, the present study aimed
at performing a transcriptomic analysis of the ovary during oocyte growth (vitellogenesis), maturation and follicular atresia using a recently developed oligonucleotide
microarray [27]. The analysis revealed the differential
expression of more than one hundred genes during ovarian development, some of them with yet unknown functions in the fish ovary. In addition, determination of the
cell type-specific expression in the ovary of selected transcripts suggest the activation of genes presumably
involved in chemotaxis, angiogenesis and prevention of
apoptosis in follicular cells of atretic follicles, which have
not been described before in teleosts during ovarian
atresia.

Results
Stages of ovarian development
To identify differentially expressed genes during ovarian
development in Senegalese sole, samples of ovarian tissue
were collected from adult females sacrificed throughout
the annual reproductive cycle [28,29] or after hormonal
treatment (Figure 1). Thus, samples of ovaries at previtellogenesis (Figure 1A and 1B), vitellogenesis (Figure 1D
and 1E), maturation (Figure 1G and 1H), and undergoing
follicular atresia (Figure 1J, K and 1L), were used for transcriptome analysis. As many other fractional spawner teleosts, the Senegalese sole has a group-synchronous ovary
in which follicles of all sizes up through vitellogenesis are
present at any time, and populations (or clutches) of follicles are periodically recruited into maturation from a
population of oocytes in late vitellogenic stages [30].

Therefore, the increased frequency of vitellogenic, mature
or atretic ovarian follicles in the ovary, as determined by
histological analysis (Figure 1C, F, I and 1M), defined the
ovarian developmental stages used in the present study.
The previtellogenic ovary was formed by exclusively ovarian follicles with oocytes at the primary growth stage
(oocyte/follicle diameter up to approximately 150 μm) in
which vitellogenin incorporation and yolk formation did
not yet start (Figure 1A-1C). In the vitellogenic ovary, a
population of follicles were recruited into vitellogenesis,
and consequently the proportion of follicles at the primary growth stage decreased (Figure 1D-1F). At this stage,
follicles containing oocytes at the cortical alveolus stage
(up to approximately 300 μm), characterized by the presence of nascent cortical alveoli within the ooplasm, were
more abundant (Figure 1D, inset). Vitellogenic oocytes
surrounded by the zona radiata and the somatic follicular
cells, granulosa and theca cells, increased in size (up to
500 μm in diameter at late vitellogenesis) and their cytoplasm was filled with yolk granules where vitellogeninderived yolk proteins are stored (Figure 1E). As a result of
this growing phase, the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of
females increased by approximately 7-fold (Figure 1C and
1F).

large vacuoles (Figure 2). At this stage, accumulation of
blood cells, erythrocytes and leukocytes in the follicle, as
well as in the oocyte, was also noted (Figure 2B).
Microarray analysis
Differential gene expression in the four ovarian developmental stages was determined using a Senegalese sole-specific oligonucleotide microarray containing 60-mer
probes representing 5,087 unique genes [27]. This platform was previously designed from a Senegalese sole EST
database derived from a multi-tissue normalized cDNA
library from different adult tissues (including ovaries at

Maturing ovaries containing follicle-enclosed oocytes
undergoing meiosis resumption, and ovaries carrying
mature oocytes prior to ovulation, were collected 24-48 h
after treatment of vitellogenic females with gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist [D-Ala6, Pro9, NEt] (GnRHa)
[24]. In the mature ovary, a population of follicleenclosed oocytes at late stages of vitellogenesis was further
recruited into maturation (Figure 1G-1I). In these oocytes,
the germinal vesicle migrates towards the animal pole and
yolk globules fuse one another (Figure 1G), eventually
forming a large mass of yolk (Figure 1H). The mature
oocyte reached 800-900 μm in diameter due to water
uptake (hydration), resulting in a further 2-fold increase
of the GSI (Figure 1F and 1I).
Finally, atretic ovaries were collected from females showing spontaneously occurring ovarian follicle atresia during the spawning season, or induced after GnRHa
treatment. In these ovaries, approximately up to 30-40%
of the ovarian follicles showed different levels of atresia
and maturing/mature oocytes were absent (Figure 1J-1M).
In early atretic follicles, vitellogenic oocytes shrank, the
zona radiata folded, and follicles became irregularly
shaped (Figure 1K and 1L). The follicular cells were hypertrophied and the theca was poorly developed. Advanced
follicular atresia was characterized by breakdown and
resorption of the zona radiata, and the appearance of
highly columnar follicular cells apparently showing an
intense phagocytic activity as suggested by the presence of

different developmental stage) and larval and juvenile
stages [27]. Therefore, although this platform was not
ovary-specific and most likely did not contain all the transcripts expressed in the sole ovary, its was useful to obtain
a first insight into the overall changes of gene expression
during ovarian development.
To determine the false discovery rate (FDR) in each of the
differential gene expression experiments (vitellogenic vs.
previtellogenic ovaries, mature vs. vitellogenic ovaries,
and atretic vs. vitellogenic/mature ovaries), an additional
microarray experiment was performed by hybridizing differentially labelled (Cy3 and Cy5) aliquots of amplified
RNA (aRNA) from the same sample (previtellogenic
ovary). As expected, there were few differences between
the Cy3 and Cy5 signals for most of the microarray spots
in these experiments giving an estimated overall FDR of
3.0, 3.8 and 5.6% for vitellogenic vs. previtellogenic ovaries, mature vs. vitellogenic ovaries, and atretic vs. vitellogenic/mature ovaries, respectively (see Additional file 1).
Microarray data analysis indicated significant (p < 0.01)
regulation of genes in vitellogenic (46 ESTs), mature (46
ESTs) and atretic ovaries (26 ESTs), which showed fold
change (FC) values from 1.4 up to 5.1. These ESTs, and the
corresponding GenBank accession numbers are listed in
Tables 1, 2 and 3. In Table 3, differential expressed genes
in atretic ovaries relative to vitellogenic or mature ovaries
are pooled together. Some of these ESTs (26%) could not
be annotated, even after sequencing the respective clones
from the 5' end, and are not included in these tables.
Gene ontology annotation
To obtain a first assessment of the more important physiological processes occurring during ovarian development,
gene ontology (GO) analysis was carried out using the
BLAST2GO v1 program [31]. Most of the annotated ESTs
(93%) had GO assignments, and many of those had 3-6
assignments each (49%) and a significant proportion
(34%) had 7 or more assignments.

Figure 3 shows the differentially expressed genes in the
three ovarian stages (vitellogenesis, maturation and follicular atresia) classified according to GO terms biological
process (level 3), cellular component (level 5) and molecular function (level 3). During vitellogenesis, the majority
of regulated ESTs were dedicated to metabolic process,
oxidation reduction, regulation and anatomical structure
development, in the biological process category. A similar
distribution of GO terms was seen within the EST cluster
regulated during maturation, although in this case transcripts related to cell cycle, localization of cell, cellular
component organization, and system process, were also
detected. During ovarian follicle atresia, most regulated
genes fall in the cellular metabolism, establishment of

and

component

organization

During vitellogenesis and maturation, most protein products were mainly inferred to be associated with mitochondria based on the cellular component category, although
some also might be in the cytoskeleton (specially during
vitellogenesis), the nucleus, and intracellularly in
organelles. Interestingly, during atresia, the products of
most of the up-regulated genes showed putative extracellular location, whereas the products of the down-regulated genes had membrane and nucleus locations.
Finally, classification using the molecular function category indicated that most of the gene products regulated
during vitellogenesis and maturation were dedicated to
binding and catalytic functions, including nucleotide
binding, protein binding, ion binding, and transferase
and hydrolase activities. However, products involved in
transmembrane transporter activity only appeared during
maturation. In the atretic ovary, the majority of products
were associated with ion and lipid binding.
Vitellogenesis
In the vitellogenic ovary, 34 and 12 transcripts were found
to be up- and down-regulated, respectively, relative to previtellogenic ovaries; 35 had a significant hit in Swiss-Prot
database (Table 1). The most highly up-regulated transcripts corresponded to selenoprotein W2a (sepw2a),
hypothetical 18K protein from Carassius auratus mitochondrion, muscle-specific beta 1 integrin binding protein 2 (mibp2), zona pellucida protein 3 (zp3),
cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1), cytochrome b
(cytb), cytosolic heat shock protein 90 beta (hsp90b),
NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (nd3) and 1 (nd1), and
beta actin 1 (bactin1). The sequence similarity of clone
pgsP0015N21 to tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) sepw2a
was low (4E-04) possibly because its nucleotide sequence
only covered the C terminus of tilapia sepw2a.

Other up-regulated genes in the vitellogenic ovary, but at
lower levels, were additional components of the cytoskeleton, such as alpha actin (actc1l), keratin 8 (krt8),
tropomyosin1-1 (tpm1-1), myosin (myh11), and transgelin (tagln), or of intracellular signaling pathways, such as
Ras homolog member G (rhog), a novel protein similar to
serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (sgk) also found in
zebrafish, and inositol monophosphatase 3 (impa3). Proteolytic complexes and enzymes, such as protein arginine
methyltransferase (prmt1), acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2 (acaa2), and creatine kinase (ckb), and the putative homeodomain transcription factor 1 (phtf1),
transducer of ERBB2 (tob1a), neurexin 1a (nrxn1a) and
thrombospondin 4b (thbs4b) were also up-regulated in
vitellogenic ovaries.

Two transcripts similar to CDC-like kinase 2 (si:ch21181a5.7) and CD53 cell surface glycoprotein (zgc:64051),
as well as alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (agxt), were
the most down-regulated genes during vitellogenesis.
Other down-regulated genes included the actin-binding
protein scinderin (scin), mitochondrial enzymes, such as
NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 alpha subcomplex
subunit 11 (ndufa11) and a dihydrodipicolinate synthaselike enzyme, proteolytic complexes and enzymes, as proteasome subunit beta type-9 precursor (psmb9a) and carboxypeptidase H (cph), a hypothetical protein-encoding
gene also found in Xenopus laevis (LOC735233), and a
coiled-coil domain containing 90B novel product
(ccdc90b).
Ovarian maturation
Microarray analysis detected 26 up-regulated and 20
down-regulated transcripts in maturing/mature ovaries
relative to vitellogenic ovaries, and 32 transcripts could be
annotated (Table 2). The most highly up-regulated transcript corresponded to an EST showing sequence similarity to the amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae)
BRAFLDRAFT_128798 gene, which encodes an hypothetical protein with inferred cysteinyl-tRNA aminoacylation
activity. However, the BLAST E-value for the similarity of
Senegalese sole clone pgsP0012B12 to this protein was
relatively low (2E-14), and therefore conclusive annota-

tion will require the cloning of the sole full-length cDNA.
Other highly up-regulated transcripts encoded Na+/K+ATPase subunits, such as the beta subunit 1a (atp1b1a),
alpha subunit 1 (atp1a1) and another isoform of the beta
subunit (atpb), and alpha-2-macroglobulin (a2m).
Cytoskeletal proteins, myosin 10 (myo10) and type II keratin E3-like protein, and proteins involved in transcriptional and translational responses, such as makorin RING
zinc finger protein 1a (mkrn1) and ribosomal protein L36
(rpl36), were other up-regulated transcripts in mature ovaries. Interestingly, a regulator of vesicular traffic, novel
protein similar to vertebrate ADP-ribosylation factor 4
and extended synaptotagmin-2-A (e-syt2-a), was also upregulated. Other transcripts were retinoic acid receptor
responder protein 3 (rarres3), thioredoxin interacting protein (txnip), mitogen-activated protein kinase p38delta
(mapk13), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1), UDPglucose dehydrogenase (ugdh), and myeloid-associated
differentiation marker homolog (myadm). Some transcripts that were up-regulated during vitellogenesis
showed a further increase during maturation, such as
tob1a and nd1.
During ovarian maturation, more genes appeared to be
down-regulated than during vitellogenesis. Among those
transcripts, we found type II Na/Pi cotransport system

protein (slc34a2a) and enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (sdhb) and fructose-1,6bisphosphatase (fbp1), involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and impa3, which was up-regulated during vitellogenesis. Transcript abundance was also reduced for some
components and regulators of the cytoskeleton, such as
myosin binding protein H (mybph), gelsolin (gsna), and
centaurin delta 2-like (LOC100005008). Other transcripts
were thrombin (f2), monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (myst3), 14-3-3 protein epsilon (ywhae), an apolipoprotein L-like protein (LOC100150119), zona pellucida
C2 (zpc2) and histone H2B (hist1h2be). These mRNAs are
potentially implicated in proteolysis (f2), transcription
and signal transduction regulation (myst3 and ywhae,
respectively), lipid transport (LOC100150119), formation
of the zona radiata (zpc2), and chromatin compaction
(hist1h2be).
Follicular atresia
The comparison of ovaries undergoing follicular atresia vs.
vitellogenic and mature ovaries revealed the up- and
down-regulation of 10 and 16 transcripts, respectively,
and 18 transcripts could be annotated (Table 3). One of
these transcripts (GenBank accession number FF286365),
which was the most highly up-regulated, had sequence
similarity to two unknown predicted proteins from gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and the puffer fish Tetraodon nigroviridis (BLAST E-values of 9E-08 and 3E-04,

respectively). This EST apparently encoded a full-length
polypeptide which shared 25% identity with a protein
named gastrula-specific embryonic protein 1 found in the
orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The corresponding cDNA clone (pgsP0015C05) was then
sequenced in full-length, and the presence of conserved
motifs in its deduced amino acid sequence was investigated. These analyses, together with a preliminary phylogenetic reconstruction, clearly indicated that sole
FF286365 encoded an ortholog of apolipoprotein C-I
(apoc1) (Additional file 2). The nucleotide and amino acid
sequence of this cDNA was deposited in GenBank with
accession number EU835856.
Other transcripts also significantly up-regulated in atretic
ovaries were leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (lect),
thrombospondin (thbs), heme-binding protein 2 (hebp2),
apolipoprotein A-I (apoa1), S100-like calcium binding
protein (s100), and enolase (eno3). The S100-encoding
EST (pgsP0020M08) was a full-length cDNA which
allowed further analysis of its deduced amino acid
sequence. The analysis indicated that this transcript
belongs to the S100a10 subgroup of the EF-Hand calcium-binding proteins superfamily (Additional file 3).
Regarding
down-regulated
transcripts,
BRAFLDRAFT_128798 and a2m showed the strongest
repression in atretic ovaries, which interestingly were

very long chain fatty acids protein 1 (elovl1b), which may
be involved in the control of cell projections and fatty acid
biosynthesis, respectively, were also down-regulated.
Validation of microarray data by real-time qPCR
A number of differentially expressed ESTs (n = 20) in vitellogenic, mature and atretic ovaries were further selected to
verify the changes in expression by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR (qPCR). The expression of all twenty genes followed the same pattern whether evaluated by microarray
or qPCR (Figure 4). Two genes, tob1a and LOC100090881,
were however an exception. For tob1a, a significant
increase during maturation observed with the microarray
could not be detected (p = 0.78) by qPCR (Figure 4B and
4C), whereas the significant down-regulation of
LOC100090881 during atresia could not be confirmed (p
= 0.88) by qPCR (Figure 4C). All other genes showed in
general a similar relative expression pattern by both
microarray and qPCR, resulting in an overall success rate
of 91% (2 inconsistencies out of 22 comparisons, since
tob1a and BRAFLDRAFT_128798 were significantly regulated both during vitellogenesis and atresia by microarray
analysis). For a2m, however, the FC determined with the
array (2.35) was about 10 times lower than that measured
by qPCR (18.38), which is a known phenomenon
observed in oligo-arrays when background subtraction is
not performed (as in the present study) [32]. Usually, a
two-fold change is considered as the cut-off around which
microarray and qRT-PCR data begin to loose correlation
[33]. Finally, few transcripts that did not show significant
differences in expression levels with the microarray were
also selected for qPCR. These analyses did not show significant changes in the expression level consistent with the
array data (data not shown).

Differential expression during follicular atresia
Some regulated transcripts in atretic ovaries relative to
mature/vitellogenic ovaries, such as apoc1, apoa1, thbs,
lect2, s100a10, a2m and BRAFLDRAFT_128798, were further analyzed by qPCR to investigate how broadly they
might be expressed during ovarian development (Figure

ovaries, whereas a2m and BRAFLDRAFT_128798 transcripts were accumulated in mature ovaries and strongly
down-regulated in atretic ovaries, thus demonstrating the
same expression pattern as that observed with the microarray. The data also revealed that apoa1, thbs and lect2
showed relatively high relative expression levels in previtellogenic ovaries in addition to during atresia.

Cellular localization of differentially expressed genes
To determine the cell type-specific expression of representative transcripts in the ovary, in situ hybridization was
carried out on ovarian histological sections using specific
antisense riboprobes. For these experiments, we selected
transcripts that were up-regulated in vitellogenic and
mature ovaries, zp3, tob1a, mapk13 and mkrn1 (Figure 6),
or in atretic ovaries, apoc1, s100a10, thbs and lect2 (Figure
7). The zp3 hybridization signal was weakly detected in
the cytoplasm of previtellogenic oocytes, whereas the signal increased in early cortical alveolus stage oocytes to
subsequently diminished again at later stages (Figure 6A
and 6B). The staining was absent in vitellogenic oocytes as

well as in the surrounding follicle cell layers. A similar
localization pattern was observed for tob1a (Figure 6D
and 6E) and mkrn1 (Figure 6J and 6K), although their
hybridization signals remained visible, but much weaker,
in the cytoplasm during vitellogenesis. A weak mkrn1
staining was also seen in follicular cells of vitellogenic follicles. mapk13 transcripts were exclusively localized in the
surrounding follicular cells of late vitellogenic oocytes,
whereas expression in ovarian follicles at other stages was
not consistently detected (Figure 6G and 6H). For all these
transcripts, sense probes resulted in no signal (Figure 6C,
F, I and 6L).

Regarding the transcripts up-regulated during ovarian
atresia, apoc1-specific antisense probes showed an intense
and specific staining in hypertrophied and vacuolized follicular cells of atretic follicles, which was increasing as follicular atresia progressed (Figure 7A and 7B). The same
staining pattern was found for s100a10 (Figure 7D and
7E) and thbs (Figure 7G and 7H). The lect2 transcripts
were found in theca cells of atretic follicles (Figure 7K
inset) but a weaker and more diffuse staining was also
detected in hypertrophied granulosa cells (Figure 7K). Primary growth oocytes, including cortical alveolus stage
oocytes, also expressed thbs and lect2 mRNAs (Figure 7J),
in agreement with their increased levels previously found
in previtellogenic ovaries by qPCR (Figure 5B and 5G).
Sense probes for all of these transcripts were negative (Figure 7C, F, I and 7L).

Discussion
The present work has identified a number of differentially
expressed genes in the Senegalese sole ovary that may play
different roles during ovarian follicle growth and maturation, as well as several genes that were not previously
found to be regulated in the teleost ovary. The expression
of some genes specifically in follicular cells of atretic follicles suggest the role of these cells in the activation of
molecular pathways associated with ovarian follicle
atresia which have not been previously recognized in fish.
Microarray performance
In this study, a first-generation Senegalese sole oligonucleotide microarray was employed. This array represents the
second high-density microarray available for commercial
flatfish, in addition to that recently published for Atlantic
halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) [34], and has been previously shown to perform well to detect differences in
gene expression [27].

Transcriptome analysis during ovarian growth, maturation, and follicular atresia in Senegalese sole showed the
differential expression of 118 genes. This number of regulated genes is lower than that reported in similar studies
on trout ovaries by using cDNA microarrays [13,15] or
SSH [17], where changes in the expression of up to 600
genes have been reported. However, our data are more
similar to the expression profiling obtained from the comparison of halibut larval stages not very distant during
development (e.g., mouth opening vs. post-hatch) by
using an oligo microarray (44 differentially expressed
genes in Atlantic halibut [34]). The apparent discrepancy
in the overall number of genes regulated during ovarian
development observed in this work with respect to published reports in salmonids using cDNA microarrays may
be related to the limited number of unique genes represented in our array when compared with the salmonid
platforms, or to the fact that oligo arrays are usually more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

stringent than cDNA arrays [35]. Another important
aspect that can be considered is that salmonids have synchronous ovaries, unlike the Senegalese sole that has a
group-synchronous ovary, and therefore ovarian follicles
at different developmental stages are present at any time
during the spawning season.
Folliculogenesis and oocyte growth
The period of ovarian vitellogenesis in fish is mainly regulated by the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
involves the differentiation and growth of ovarian follicles
mainly by the incorporation of circulating vitellogenins
and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the oocyte
[36]. Among the genes regulated in Senegalese sole vitellogenic ovaries, the GO terms overrepresented belong to
the metabolic, cellular, biological and developmental
processes categories, and this is consistent with the rapid
rates of growth and development of the ovarian follicles at
this stage. Thus, transcripts possibly related to mitochondrial energy production (cox1, cytb, nd3, nd1, acca2), cystoskeleton formation and organization (bactin1, actc1l,
tagln, tpm1-1, krt8, myh11), intracellular signaling pathways (rhog, sgk), and cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions (mibp2, thbs-4b, zgc:64051), that may play different
roles during the formation and growth of the ovarian follicles, were over-expressed relative to previtellogenic ovaries. Also, as seen in previous ovarian transcriptome
studies in salmonids and tilapia [15,17,37], as well as in
zebrafish fully-grown ovarian follicles [12], zona radiata
(zp3) and hsp90b transcripts were strongly up-regulated.
Vertebrate members of the heat shock protein 90 family
play a post-translational regulatory role within the cell by
interacting with several important cellular signalling molecules and transcription factors, such as steroid receptors,
modulating their activity [38]. High abundance of hsp90b
transcripts is a common feature of mammalian, fish and
Drosophila ovaries and eggs [12].

During oocyte growth, meiosis is arrested at prophase I,
and it will not proceed until it is activated by the maturation promoting (MPF). The MPF is a cytoplasmic complex
specifically formed during oocyte maturation consisting
of cyclin B and Cd2, a serine-threonine protein kinase
[39]. Studies in zebrafish have shown that immature
oocytes contain Cd2 proteins but not cyclin B, and therefore the absence of cyclin B translation is likely the main
mechanism to maintain meiosis arrest [40]. However, the
roles of other cyclins (e.g., cyclin A) and protein kinases
during this process in growing fish oocytes is poorly
known. It is therefore of interest the strong repression of a
transcript similar to vertebrate CDC-like kinase 2
(si:ch211-81a5.7) in sole vitellogenic ovaries.
The vitellogenic period is also characterized by intense
deposition of RNA and proteins, as well as lipids, vitamins

and hormones, which are necessary during the earliest
steps of embryonic development [41]. Maternal RNAs are
produced endogenously by the oocyte and stored during
oogenesis, and they become usable for embryogenesis
upon egg activation and fertilization, usually sometimes
after a process of activation involving translation or protein modification [42]. One of these transcripts found in
the Senegalese sole ovary, and highly expressed in previtellogenic oocytes of vitellogenic ovaries, was tob1a.
Interestingly, the array and qPCR analyses detected the
up-regulation of tob1a only in vitellogenic ovaries, which
may suggest that this transcript starts to be accumulated in
previtellogenic oocytes at the onset of vitellogenesis. tob1a
is also found in trout ovaries [15] and encodes a transcriptional repressor of the BTG/Tob family of antiproliferative
proteins [43]. Tob1a plays an important role during
embryonic dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish by inhibiting transcriptional regulation stimulation by β-catenin, a
factor that is essential for the dorsal development of
amphibian and fish embryos [44]. Other transcripts that
may also be stored in oocytes are nrxn1a and mkrn1.
nrxn1a is a member of a family of adhesion molecules
involved in the formation and function of synapses. In
both zebrafish and amphibians [45,46], neurexins genes
are expressed in the ovary and in embryos before the activation of zygotic transcription, and interestingly, a parental origin of some of the embryonic neurexin isoforms has
been suggested [45]. The mkrn1, as tob1a, was detected at
high levels in Senegalese sole previtellogenic oocytes of
vitellogenic ovaries. This transcript encodes a putative
ribonucleoprotein with a distinctive array of zinc finger
domains that may play an important role in embryonic
development and neurogenesis, as reported for the
amphibian makorin-2 [47].
The most highly up-regulated transcript in sole vitellogenic ovaries showed sequence similarity to tilapia selenoprotein W2a (sepw2a). Selenoproteins are a diverse group
of proteins, with 25 members in humans [48], that contain selenocysteine (Sec) which is incorporated by a redefined in-frame UGA codon and requires the involvement
of a complex translational machinery [49]. Selenoproteins with characterized functions are enzymes involved
in redox reactions, such as glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and iodothyronine deiodinase, and thus
they are believed to protect the cells from oxidative damage and apoptosis [49]. Expression of selenoproteins in
fish ovaries has also been reported in salmonids [15] and
tilapia [37]. These coincident findings suggest that seleneproteins might be accumulated in fish follicles for protection against oxidative stress during folliculogenesis and
oocyte growth. In mammals, selenium stimulates proliferation of granulosa cells from small follicles and also
potentiates FSH induction of estradiol secretion [50]. In
addition, accumulation of maternal selenoproteins in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

ovarian follicles may have a role for antioxidant protection of the offspring [50].
Oocyte maturation and hydration
During the maturation of follicle-enclosed oocytes, meiosis is reinitiated in response to progestagens produced by
the follicular cells after luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation [39]. During this process, the germinal vesicle
migrates towards the oocyte periphery, the nuclear envelope breaks down, the first meiotic division occurs, and
the chromosomes proceed to second meiotic metaphase
where they arrest; at this point, the oocyte will ovulate and
becomes an egg [51]. Oocyte maturation is also accompanied by important changes in the cytoarchitecture and
function of the ovarian follicle, since steroidogenic pathways in granulosa cells are switched from estrogen to progestagen production, intercellular communication
oocyte-granulosa cells is resumed, and the zona radiata
becomes more compacted [39,52,53]. At this stage, ovarian transcripts associated with the regulation of intracellular signalling pathways (such as mapk13 in follicular cells,
and ywhae), and cystoskeleton (mybph, gsna, myo10,
LOC100005008), as well as in the assembly of the nucleosome (hist1h2be, myst3), were significantly regulated in
Senegalese sole, which is consistent with the important
nuclear and cytoplasmic changes occurring in the ovarian
follicle during oocyte maturation.

One transcript overexpressed in mature ovaries was e-syt2a which is related to the synaptotagmin family of vesicle
proteins that are believed to function as calcium sensors
for vesicle exocytosis at synapsis [54]. It is known that fish
oocytes, as the eggs of most organisms, suffer a transient
elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ following fertilization,
an event that triggers a series of biochemical pathways
required for the block of polyspermy, activation of metabolism, re-entry into the cell cycle, and execution of the
developmental program [55]. One of the earliest
responses to the C2+ wave in the oocyte is the cortical alveoli exocytosis wich produces an elevation of the chorion
and the separation of the egg surface [55]. Studies in
mammalian eggs suggest that the release of cortical granules in mature eggs is dependent upon calcium-dependent synaptosome-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) which
might be regulated by binding to Ca2+-dependent synaptotagmins as it occurs in neurons [56,57]. These observations therefore suggest that the induction of e-syst2-a
transcripts in sole mature ovaries might be part of the
molecular pathways activated in the oocyte in preparation
for fertilization.
In marine teleost that produce buoyant (pelagic) eggs,
such as the Senegalese sole, oocytes continue to enlarge
during maturation owing to hydration [58]. The hydrolysis of the oocyte yolk proteins by the lysosomal proteases

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:434

cathepsin B (Catb) and/or cathepsin L (Catl) that occurs
during maturation results in the increase of free amino
acids in the ooplasm, incrementing the osmotic pressure
of the oocyte, and hence facilitating water uptake mediated by aquaporin-1b (Aqp1b) [58-60]. Current evidence
in some fish species suggest that both Catb and Aqp1b are
regulated post-translationally rather than transcriptionally in oocytes during meiotic maturation [61-63].
Accordingly, in the present study, we did not detect
changes in the expression levels of aqp1b and catl, as well
as of other cathepsins and proteases, for which specific
oligos were present in the microarray. However, probes
for catb were lacking, and therefore the regulation of this
transcript during oocyte maturation in Senegalese sole can
not be ruled out. Nevertheless, the up-regulation of
zgc:77650, a transcript showing sequence similarity to a
GTP-binding protein (ADP-ribosylation factor 4)
involved in protein trafficking that may modulate vesicle
budding and uncoating within the Golgi apparatus [64],
it is of interest. This observation may indicate a role of vesicle trafficking during oocyte maturation that might be
important, for instance, in the delivery of lysosomal
cathepsin to yolk granules or in the control of Aqp1b
shuttling into the oocyte plasma membrane. These mechanisms are however not yet elucidated in fish oocytes and
need to be investigated in the future.
The accumulation of inorganic ions in oocytes undergoing maturation, mainly K+ and Na+, may account for
about 50% of the final osmotic pressure, and therefore it
is considered as an additional mechanism mediating fish
oocyte hydration [59]. Interestingly, we found that three
of the most highly up-regulated transcripts in mature ovaries corresponded to Na+-K+-ATPase subunits (atp1b1a,
atp1a1 and atpb), whereas the solute carrier slc34a2a, also
known as the type II Na+/Pi cotransporter, was one of the
most down-regulated transcripts. In trout, slc26 (Na+independent chloride/iodide transporter) and aquaporin4 (aqp4) were found to be overexpressed in ovarian tissue
at maturation [13]. The causes for the different ion and
water transport-associated transcripts regulated during
oocyte maturation in sole and trout are intriguing,
although the fact that trout oocytes exhibit a much lower
hydration than Senegalese sole oocytes, resulting in the
production of demersal eggs, may be one of the reasons.
In vertebrates, retinoic acid regulates the transcription of
many genes involved in embryonic development and
germ cell differentiation through binding to nuclear
receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs and retinoid ×
receptors, RXRs) [65]. In mammals, retinoic acid also
affects the acquisition of developmental competence of
oocytes and the steroidogenesis of ovarian follicle cells
[66,67]. In fish, recent studies in trout suggest that follicular cells express several genes associated with retinoid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

and carotenoid metabolism indicating the presence of an
additional pathway to provide retinoids to the oocyte in
addition to the receptor mediated uptake of lipoproteins
[68]. A transcript related to this system was induced in
Senegalese sole mature ovaries, rarres3, which shows
sequence similarity to the tazarotene (synthetic, topical
retinoid)-induced gene 3 (TIG3; Retinoic Acid Receptor
Responder 3). This gene encodes a growth regulator that
possibly mediates some of the growth suppressive effects
of retinoids [69]. Although the cell localization of rarres3
in the ovarian follicle was not determined here its overexpression in the mature sole ovary may indicate that retinoids could play an additional paracrine role by affecting
the expression of suppressor/growth regulatory pathways
in the ovary.
Another gene that could play a paracrine role in the sole
ovary at the maturation stage is the proteinase inhibitor
a2m. In the mammalian ovary, a2m modulates the actions
of growth factors and cytokines, and recent works suggest
that it may have autocrine or paracrine roles in granulosa
cells potentially important for regulation of estradiol production and development of dominant follicles [70].
Interestingly, we observed that the expression of this
mRNA was specifically up-regulated during maturation,
whereas in atretic ovaries its induction was prevented. In
contrast, down-regulation of a2m was reported in trout
precocious mature ovaries [15].
Finally, similarly to that described in trout ovaries at the
time of meiosis resumption, we found high levels of coagulation factor II (thrombin I), f2, in mature ovaries. In
trout, overexpression of the coagulation factor V (cf5) has
been speculated to be related with the prevention of
bleeding from ruptured ovarian follicles at the time of
ovulation [13]. Although in Senegalese sole we found the
induction of an apparently different coagulation factor, a
similar scenario may be considered to occur in the flatfish
ovary.
Follicular atresia
Ovarian atresia is a common phenomenon in teleosts
under both natural and experimental conditions during
which a number of vitellogenic ovarian follicles fail to
complete maturation and ovulation, degenerate and are
eventually reabsorbed [19,20]. Ovarian follicle atresia in
fish seems not to be mediated by apoptosis in the follicular cells, unlike in mammals, and thus this process
appears to be different than the post-ovulatory follicular
reabsorption mechanism, which is apparently mediated
by apoptosis [22,71,72]. Therefore, apoptosis may not be
relevant at the onset of atresia, although it may contribute
to a more efficient removal of atretic follicles during ovarian follicular regression after spawning [73,74]. The ovarian transcriptome analysis in Senegalese sole might

Page 18 of 25

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:434

support this view since the expression levels of none of the
apoptosis-related genes that were represented in the
microarray, identified by GO annotation, changed in
atretic ovaries related to vitellogenic/mature ovaries.
In Senegalese sole, as in other teleosts [19,20], the process
of ovarian follicle atresia and resorption is preceded by
marked morphological changes in both the oocyte and
follicular cells, such as the disintegration of the oocyte germinal vesicle and of other cytoplasmic organelles, the
fragmentation of the zona radiata, and the hypertrophy of
the granulosa cells. These cells become phagocytic with
digestive vacuoles and incorporate and digest the oocyte
yolk as well as other oocyte components and organelles,
and they may also secrete enzymes which digest the yolk
[19,20,73,75]. In atretic ovaries, two of the up-regulated
genes corresponded to apoa1 and apoc1, which are part of
chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and
high density lipoproteins (HDL) involved in lipid transport in the bloodstream [76]. In addition, we found
reduced elovl1b transcripts possibly involved in the control of the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids and
sphingolipids in the ovary [77]. Studies in rainbow trout
have shown that during the course of follicular atresia
there is a massive transfer of the oocyte yolk proteins, and
possibly lipids, into the bloodstream combined with HDL
[78], as a result of the ingestion and digestion of the yolk
by the follicular cells [19,20]. The finding of high apoa1
and apoc1 transcript levels in hypertrophied follicular cells
(at least for apoc1) of Senegalese sole, together with that
recently reported for the fatty acid-binding protein 11
(fap11) [79], provides additional evidence for this mechanism in teleosts. However, the nature of the numerous
invasive apoc1- and fabp11-expressing cells (theca or granulosa cells) remains to be clearly established. Nevertheless, these data suggest the importance of lipid-metabolic
processes during follicular atresia in fish [79], which may
have evolved to facilitate the redistribution of energy-rich
yolk materials from oocytes that fail to develop properly
[80].
In humans, Apoc-I is primarily expressed in the liver but
also in the lung, skin, spleen, adipose tissue, and brain
[81]. ApoC-I can interact with lipid surfaces and play an
important role in controlling plasma lipoprotein metabolism by the regulation of several enzymes, such as lipoprotein lipase or phospholipase A2 [76]. The expression of
ApoC-I in the mammalian ovary has not been reported,
unlike that of ApoA-I and ApoE which are expressed by
luteinizing granulosa cells and theca cells, respectively, of
atretic follicles [82,83]. Intraovarian ApoE controls theca
cell production of androgens as well as limiting the size of
the theca cell compartment [83]. Teleost ovary and
embryos also express an ApoC-I ortholog as it has been
recently shown [18,84,85] and confirmed in the present

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

study, although its function is largely unknown. In the
embryo, apoc1 is localized in the yolk syncytial layer [85],
along with apoe, apoa1 and apo14 [86,87], suggesting its
role in the nutrition of the developing embryo through
the synthesis and secretion of apolipoproteins and lipoproteins. Therefore, the expression of apoc1 in follicular
cells of fish atretic follicles, which has not been previously
reported, may have a similar role for the resorbption of
lipids and lipoproteins stored in the oocyte. Interestingly,
trout eggs obtained by hormonal induction, which result
in alevins with a high percentage of morphological abnormalities at the yolk-sac resorption stage, also show a dramatic increase of apoc1 [18]. Altogether, these findings
suggest that ApoC-I could be a useful marker to identify
factors involved in premature ovarian regression and
abnormal embryo development in cultured fish. It is
worth noting that in humans it has been recently proposed that serum ApoC-I may be useful for early demonstration of metabolic abnormality in women with
polycystic ovary syndrome [88].
In histological sections of Senegalese sole ovarian follicles
at advanced atresia, we observed the presence of blood
cells such as erythrocytes and leukocytes, possibly derived
from the ovarian stroma and/or the theca, which invaded
the degenerating oocyte. The presence of granulocytes
(polymorphonuclear leukocytes) in atretic follicles is
reported in other fish species [21,89,90], and suggest a
relationship between follicular regression and immune
cells [73]. The specific function of immune cells (eosinophilic granulocytes and macrophages) during follicular
atresia in fish is not well known, although it has been proposed that they may act synergistically with follicular cells
in the resorption of the oocyte by releasing their granules
containing lytic enzymes [89]. In the mammalian ovary,
the leukocyte-ovarian cell interactions through the release
of chemokines is believed to play an important role for
leukocyte recruitment and activation during follicular
atresia, ovulation and luteal function [91]. In teleosts,
however, the molecular mechanisms mediating the invasion of immune cells in atretic follicles are largely
unknown. In the present study, we noted high lect2
expression levels in theca cells of atretic follicles, a transcript related to mammalian Lect2 which encodes a protein with chemotactic properties for human neutrophils
[92]. This observation may provide evidence for the presence of a chemotaxin-mediated mechanism for leukocyte
accumulation in fish follicles at advanced atresia, similarly to that occurs during the formation of the corpus
luteum in the mammalian ovary [91]. However, whereas
a number of different chemokines have been found in the
mammalian ovary [91], ovarian expression of Lect2 has
not been yet reported, and therefore the structural and
functional relationships of Senegalese sole lect2 with
other ovarian chemokines requires further investigation.

In addition to lect2, we also found high expression levels
of the calcium binding protein-encoding gene s100a10 in
atretic follicles. In mammals, S100 proteins are localized
in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells
and are involved in the regulation of a number of cellular
processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation
[93]. In the ovary, S100a10 plays an antiapoptotic function by binding the Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter and its expression in granulosa cells is stimulated
by gonadotropins and follicle survival factors, including
the epidermal growth factor, the basic fibroblast growth
factor, and interleukin-1β [94]. It is known, however, that
some S100 proteins can also be released into the extracellular space and act as chemoattractants for leukocytes or
activators of macrophages [93]. Therefore, the high
expression levels of s100a10 in sole atretic follicles may
play a dual function, to protect follicular cells from apoptosis during atresia and to act as chemoattractant for leukocytes and macrophages. In support of this hypothesis is
the reported down-regulation of an S100 homologue in
trout post-ovulatory follicles [95], which based on our
phylogenetic analysis is in fact an s100a10 ortholog.
The mammalian ovary is distinctive in that it is a tissue
that undergoes physiological angiogenesis, in which
blood vessels are programmed to develop and regress in a
cyclic manner [96]. This mechanism is tightly regulated by
pro- and antiangiogenic factors such as the members of
the thrombospondin (TSP) family TSP-1 and TSP-2,
which are among the naturally occurring inhibitors of
angiogenesis. These secreted proteins are expressed by
granulosa cells of atretic follicles and in the corpus luteum
after ovulation in rats and primates [96,97], suggesting
that they may be involved in the cessation of angiogenesis
in follicles undergoing atresia [96]. Our microarray analysis revealed that a thrombospondin isoform (thbs), distinct from thbs4b which was overexpressed in vitellogenic
ovaries, was up-regulated in Senegalese sole follicular cells
during follicular atresia. thbs was similar to mammalian
TSP-1 and TSP-2, which indicates that the inhibition of
angiogenesis may be an important mechanism regulating
atresia in both mammalian and fish ovarian follicles.
However, primary growth oocytes also expressed thbs
which may point to an additional role of this protein during folliculogenesis and/or as a maternal molecule for
early embryonic development.
In contrast to apoptosis, Wood and Van Der Kraak [22,80]
proposed that proteolytic degradation of yolk proteins,
mediated by the differential activation of Catl in the
oocyte, may be the initial event leading to follicular atresia
in fish. In the present study we did not detect changes in
the expression of catl transcripts in atretic ovaries, which
may suggest a potential post-transcriptional regulation of
this protease during ovarian follicle atresia as discussed
earlier. In any event, the specific oocyte mechanisms

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

involved in the regulation of protease activity during
atresia in fish, as well as the origin of the signals that presumably activate this system, are still largely unknown
and warrant further investigation.

Conclusion
The present study has contributed to identify differences
in gene expression during ovarian development in Senegalese sole despite that, at this point, the microarray platform employed was not ovary-specific and contained a
limited number of represented genes. Some of the genes
identified were not described before in the teleost ovary,
and therefore the present data provide a basis for future
studies on their regulation and function. Particularly,
determination of the cell-type specific localization of
some transcripts suggest the involvement of follicular cells
in yolk resorbption, chemotaxin-mediated leukocyte
migration, angiogenesis and prevention of apoptosis during ovarian atresia. These observations also indicate that
some of the transcripts, such as e-syt2-a, apoc1 and
s100a10, may be useful markers contributing to the identification of factors involved in the acquisition of egg fertilization competence and follicular regression. Clearly,
however, further experimental studies will be necessary to
determine when these mRNAs are translated as well as the
physiological functions of the encoded proteins. The
future increase in the sequencing of the Senegalese sole
ovarian transcriptome will enhance our knowledge on the
molecular pathways involved in oogenesis, and will facilitate the comparative genomic analysis of gonad development in teleosts.

Methods
Animals and biological samples
Adult Senegalese sole (1219 ± 90g) F1 generation were
maintained as previously described [24]. Females (n = 35) were sacrificed at different times during the annual
reproductive cycle, corresponding to different folliculogenesis stages [24,28]. Thus, females with previtellogenic
and vitellogenic ovaries were collected during July and
November, respectively. Maturing and mature ovaries
were collected from females treated with intramuscular
injection of 5 μg/kg GnRHa and killed 24-48 h later as
described [24]. Finally, atretic ovaries were obtained in
April-May, as well as from females treated with GnRHa. At
all sampling times, fish were sedated with 500 ppm phenoxyethanol, killed by decapitation, and the body and
gonads of each animal weighed to calculate the GSI
(gonad weight/body weight × 100). Pieces of the ovaries
were immediately removed and placed in Petri dishes
containing 10 ml of 75% Leibovitz L-15 medium with Lglutamine (Sigma) and 100 mg gentamicin/ml, pH 7.5
[60]. Follicle-enclosed oocytes at vitellogenesis, maturation and atresia were manually isolated from the rest of
the ovary using watchmaker forceps. One piece of the
ovary, as well as the isolated ovarian follicles, were deepPage 20 of 25

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:434

frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until RNA
extraction. Two additional pieces of the gonad, adjacent
to the piece sampled for RNA extraction, were fixed in
modified Bouin solution (75% picric acid and 25% formalin) for histological analysis, or in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for in situ hybridization. Procedures relating
to the care and use of animals were approved by the Ethics
Committee from Institut de Recerca i Tecnologia Agroalimentàries (IRTA, Spain) in accordance with the Guiding
Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Histological analysis
Ovaries fixed in Bouin solution for 3-4 h were dehydrated,
embedded in paraplast, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained
with hematoxilin-eosin. Alternatively, fixed gonads were
embedded in glycol methacrylate resin (Technovit 7100,
Heraeus Kultzer), sectioned at 3 μm and stained with
methylene blue/azure II/basic fuchsin. The percentages of
previtellogenic, early vitellogenic, vitellogenic, mature
and atretic oocytes were calculated by counting 100-150
total ovarian follicles in at least three different histological
sections from the same ovary, as previously described
[24].
RNA extraction, microarray hybridization and analysis
Total RNA was extracted from ovaries at previtellogenesis,
vitellogenesis, maturation and atresia, determined by histological examination, using the RNeasy extraction kit
(Qiagen) and treated with DNAse following the manufacturer's instructions. For each ovarian developmental stage,
RNA was extracted from the ovary of three different
females. The quality and concentration of the RNA was
analyzed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and NanoDrop™ ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific). Samples with RNA
integrity number (RIN; [98]) < 6.0 were discarded. Total
RNA (0.5 μg) from each of the twelve samples was amplified and labelled with fluorescent cyanine dyes, Cy3 or
Cy5, using the Eberwein mRNA amplification procedure
[99] employing the MessageAmp™ aRNA amplification kit
from Ambion (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. The Cy3and Cy5-labelled aRNAs synthesized from RNAs originated from two different ovarian stages were mixed in
equal amounts and hybridized to an oligonucleotide
microarray representing 5,087 Senegalese sole unigenes
[27]. These 60-mer probes were designed against the
3'end sequences of Senegalese sole expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) [27]. Each hybridization was done in triplicate
with aRNA from three different females, so three different
biological replicates per ovarian stage were analyzed. To
estimate the rate of false-positive expression, a self-to-self
hybridization was carried out, in which total RNA from
two different aliquots of previtellogenic ovaries were used
to produce either Cy3 or Cy5 labelled aRNA. Hybridizations were carried out for 17 h at 60°C using Agilent's gaskets G2534-60002, G2534A hybridization chambers, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/434

DNA Hybridization Oven G2545A, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Microarray raw data were obtained using Agilent's DNA
Microarray Scanner G2505B and Feature Extraction software (v10.1). The raw fluorescence intensity data were
processed using the Polyphemus™ software (Oryzon
Genomics), which includes spatial data compensation,
non-significant expressed data filtering, and data normalization. Data normalization was carried out by an
improved version of the nonlinear Q-splines normalization method [100], enhanced with robust regression techniques. Normalized and log-transformed data were used
to calculate the FC values. Differential expression was
assessed with Polyphemus™ analyzing biological replicates based on repeated experiments using robust statistics
on average technical replicates removing the outlier
points (caused by dust or array imperfection). The p-values
were calculated based on the absolute value of the regularized t-statistic [101], which uses a Bayesian framework to
derive the algorithm, using internal replicated controls to
assess the minimum technical variability of the process. A
p-value < 0.01 was considered significant. Cut-offs for significant changes were always greater than the inherent
experimental variation as assessed by the FC of internal
controls and/or self-to-self hybridizations. The microarray
data have been deposited in NCBI's [102] Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [103] and are accessible through
GEO Series accession number GSE17337 [104].
EST Annotation, gene ontology and amino acid sequence
analysis
Annotation of ESTs and extraction of GO terms to each
obtained hit using existing annotations was done using
the BLAST2GO v1 program [31] as previously described
[27]. ESTs that were considered significantly expressed
after microarray analysis, but that they could not be initially annotated, were sequenced from the 5' and 3' ends
using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) software
[102], employing the 5'end nucleotide sequences or the
consensus 5' and 3' end sequence, was used to re-annotate
these ESTs. For some of these ESTs, further annotation
required the search for conserved motifs using PROSITE
[105] and multiple amino acid sequence alignments
using ClustalW [106]. The neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis [107] of the amino acid alignments was also
carried out based on mean character distances. The
robustness of the phylogenetic tree was tested by bootstrap analysis [108] with 1000 repetitions.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
The relative mRNA levels of selected ESTs during ovarian
development were determined by qPCR on the same RNA
samples than those employed for the microarray. Total RNA
from the ovary was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (QiaPage 21 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:434

gen), and treated with DNase I using the RNase-Free DNase
kit (Qiagen). An aliquot of the RNA (0.5 μg) was reversetranscribed using 20 IU of AMV RT (Stratagene), 0.5 μM
oligo(dT)12-18 (Invitrogen) and 1 mM dNTPs for 1.5 h at
50°C. Real-time qPCR amplifications were performed in a
final volume of 20 μl with 10 μl SYBR® Green qPCR master
mix (Applied Biosystems), 2 μl diluted (1:5) cDNA, and 0.5
μM of each primer (see Additional file 4). The sequences
were amplified in duplicate for each sample on 384-well
plates using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification protocol was as
follows: an initial denaturation and activation step at 50°C
for 2 min, and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of
95°C for 15 s and 63°C for 1 min. After the amplification
phase, a temperature-determinating dissociation step was
carried out at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 95°C for 15
s. For normalization of cDNA loading, all samples were run
in parallel using 18S ribosomal protein (18S) as reference
gene, since its expression between experimental samples did
not show significant differences (data not shown). Negative
control samples were also run in which the template was not
added. To estimate efficiencies, a standard curve was generated for each primer pair from 10-fold serial dilutions (from
100 to 0.01 ng) of a pool of first-stranded cDNA template
from all samples. Standard curves represented the cycle
threshold (Ct) value as a function of the logarithm of the
number of copies generated, defined arbitrarily as one copy
for the most diluted standard. All calibration curves exhibited correlation coefficients higher than 0.97, and the corresponding real-time PCR efficiencies were above 99%. Values
of relative expression in ovaries at different developmental
stage were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA. The significance level was set at 0.05.
In situ hybridization
Samples of ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
16-20 h at 4°C, and subsequently dehydrated and embedded in Paraplast (Sigma). In situ hybridization on 7-μm
sections was carried out with digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase (DIG-AP) incorporated cRNA probes as previously described [109]. DIG-AP riboprobes were
synthesized with T3 and T7 RNA polymerases using the
DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche). The DIG-labeled probes
were detected as previously described [105], and the
resulting dark blue to purple color indicated localization
of the transcripts. Sections were examined and photographed with a Leica DMLB light microscope.
