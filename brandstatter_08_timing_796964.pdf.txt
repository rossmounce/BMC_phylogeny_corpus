Abstract
Background: Nearly half of the West Eurasian assemblage of human mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) is fractioned into numerous sub-lineages of the predominant haplogroup (hg) R0. Several
hypotheses have been proposed on the origin and the expansion times of some R0 sub-lineages,
which were partially inconsistent with each other. Here we describe the phylogenetic structure and
genetic variety of hg R0 in five European populations and one population from the Middle East.
Results: Our analysis of 1,350 mtDNA haplotypes belonging to R0, including entire control region
sequences and 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the coding region, revealed significant
differences in the distribution of different sub-hgs even between geographically closely located
regions. Estimates of coalescence times that were derived using diverse algorithmic approaches
consistently affirmed that the major expansions of the different R0 hgs occurred in the terminal
Pleistocene and early Holocene.
Conclusion: Given an estimated coalescence time of the distinct lineages of 10 – 18 kya, the
differences in the distributions could hint to either limited maternal gene flow after the Last Glacial
Maximum due to the alpine nature of the regions involved or to a stochastic loss of diversity due
to environmental events and/or disease episodes occurred at different times and in distinctive
regions. Our comparison of two different ways of obtaining the timing of the most recent common
ancestor confirms that the time of a sudden expansion can be adequately recovered from control
region data with valid confidence intervals. For reliable estimates, both procedures should be
applied in order to cross-check the results for validity and soundness.

Background
According to the newest interpretation of C14 calibration
data, and according to previous studies on human evolution, Europe was populated around 41–46 thousand years
ago (kya) [1-3]. The main features of the post-glacial colonization of Europe was reliably reconstructed using parts
of the human mitochondrial genome (mainly the hypervariable segment I; HVS-I [2-5]) or the entire mtDNA molecule [6-8].
In Europe, with the exception of U5 and V, which most
likely arose in situ, all mtDNA hgs (H, I, J, K, T, U2e, U3,
U4, X, and W) are most likely of Middle Eastern origin and
were introduced by either the protocolonization 41–46
kya, by later arrivals in the late Paleolithic or more recent
contacts [2,9,10].
Nearly half of the West Eurasian pool of human mtDNA
lineages is composed of subclades of the predominant
West Eurasian hg R0 [6,11-13]. R0, formerly known as
pre-HV [14], is defined by substitutions at nucleotide
positions (nps) 73 and 11719 relative to R [15,16]. Its frequency as a whole declines towards the East and South,
but in the Near East, the Caucasus and Central Asia its frequency is still as high as 10–30% [6,13,17]. Until now,
more than 20 sub-lineages of hg H, the predominant subclade of R0, which accounts for roughly 40% of West Eurasian mtDNAs, have been described [6,12,13,17] and the
variance of their regional distributions has been discussed
[4,6,13,17,18].
Previous studies have proposed that hg H originated in
the Middle East ~30 – 25 kya, expanded into Europe in
association with a second Paleolithic wave (25 – 20 kya)
and was strongly involved in late-glacial expansions from
ice-age refugia after the LGM (20 kya) [2,9]. For a few subhg of hg H, coalescence ages were determined using either
entire mtDNA genomes [6] or parts of the mtDNA control
region [17]. Hg H1, H3 and V share an estimated common origin in the terminal Pleistocene (16 – 11.5 kya),
with major expansion in the early Holocene (~10 kya) [6].
Recent estimates on expansion times of selected H subhgs [17] are in conflict with the appraisals derived by [6],
thus leaving the question on the reliability on the applied
methods unanswered.
The objective of this study was to provide new information concerning the phylogenetic characteristics of macrohg R0, as well as to determine spatial distribution patterns
and coalescence ages of all its major sub-hgs.

Results and Discussion
In a total of 3,569 samples from five European populations residing in Central and South-East Europe (Austria,
Germany, Hungary, Macedonia and Romania) and one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/191

Middle East population (Dubai), we found 1,408 samples
(~39%) to belong to hg R0 based on either control region
or coding region analysis. Of these, 1,350 samples contained enough DNA to obtain a dataset of full haplotypes
consisting of entire control region sequences and 45 SNPs
from the coding region. These haplotypes are listed in the
Additional file 1.
Haplogroup frequencies
The frequency of R0 in the different populations varied
significantly (chi-square test; df = 5; p < 0.01) when taking
all populations into account. Within Europe however, no
significant differences were observed between populations (chi-square test; df = 4; p < 0.01). The location of the
chosen populations and the respective proportion of R0
are shown in Figure 1. The five European populations
from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia and Romania showed significant differences in the abundance of
hgs H*, H2, H3, H7, H8, H9, H11, H12, HV0, HV1, R0a
and V (chi-square test; df = 4; unadjusted p < 0.01). The
prevalence of the remaining sub-hgs H1, H5, H6, H10,
H13, H14, H15, H16, H17 and H21 was consistent across
Europe (Table 1). Analyses of molecular variance
(AMOVA; Tables 2, 3, 4) revealed significant statistical differences between most of the populations, except for the
German population sample, which reflected well the typical European haplotype composition. A highly probable
cause for the pronounced heterogeneity of the genetic
substructure of R0 between the different populations (Figure 2) is genetic drift, which is particularly strong for less
frequent haplogroups as most of R0 sub-haplogroups. Hg
H was under-represented in the two Hungarian speaking
populations Csángó and Székely from Romania, which
could be explained by the described effects of genetic isolation especially in the Csángó population [19]. H2 and
H3 exceeded the expected values in Austrians, while these
hgs were not observed in the Romanians at all. H7, H11
and V occurred at unexpectedly high frequencies in the
Hungarians from Romania and Macedonians. H12 was
only found in the Macedonian population sample. Apart
from Dubai, R0a was only observed in Romanian Hungarians. This observation reflects well the spatial frequency
distribution of R0a, with the center of gravity in the Arabian Peninsula and only faint concurrencies in the southeastern part of Europe [4].
Phylogenetic topology of haplogroup R0
R0 delineates from R* by the absence of nucleotide substitutions relative to the rCRS at positions 73 and 11719
and it can further be divided into two major clades: HV*
is defined by the absence of transition C14766T, while
R0a is defined by a set of variants at positions 64, 2442,
3847, 13188, 16166, and 16362 [20]. Figure 3 gives an
overview of the phylogenetic backbone of R0 as described

before and updated by [17] including new information
from the present study.
The R0a sub-lineage is defined by the motif C64T T2442C
T3847C C13188T T16126C T16362C [20]. This hg shows
a particular instability in the neighborhood of position
64. All of our R0a samples showed C64T (which is part of
the basal motif), half of them showed a T-insertion at
position 60 (indicated in [20] as 57+T). This constitutes a

sub-clade of R0a, R0a2; in [20] this sub-clade is named as
(preHV)1b). All but one of the 20 R0a samples carried an
additional transition T58C; which could correspond with
(preHV)1a1 in [20]; this seems to constitute part of the
motif defining a sub-branch of hg (preHV)1a (identified
by transition 827 on top of the basal motif); here we
rename (preHV)1a and (preHV)1a1 as R0a1 and R0a1a
for consistency. Transition T58C appears also within R0a2
[20]. Conclusively, we found four different haplotypes

individuals), 60.1T-C64T (1 individual), T58C-64T (7
individuals) and C64T alone (2 individuals). In [20] we
find additional variation at this segment, for instance,

Transition 16209C was found in eleven out of twelve
H1a1-samples; therefore, this variant could be perfectly
part of the motif of an H1a1 sub-branch. Position 73 has
been traditionally used as a diagnostic position of hg R
together with only one coding region transition,
G11719A; this variant appears also quite often within hg
H [21]. In addition, this variant appears for instance in
complete mtDNA genomes within H1a (e.g. [6]), H3 [22],
H4a (e.g. [23]), etc. Therefore, defining hg R by only A73G
is imprecise. In our dataset, we observed for example the
occurrence of A73G within H4a1. Within H7, a new sublineage, here identified as H7-709 seems to be characterized at least by the following array of variants G709A,
T16172C and C16173T. This lineage seems to be geographically restricted to eastern Europe since it appears
only in the Székely [19]; note that the control region motif
T16172C C16173T appears also in the Kurdish ([24], but
within hg I, as well as in other L and M hgs [25,26]. Within
H10, another new sub-lineage carrying the additional
control region markers T16093C and C16221T could be
distinguished; the complete genome #32/H from [22]
give support to this new branch. The transition C16114T
could be part of the motif of a sister clade, as inferred from
two complete genomes: Tor31 (AY738970; [6]) and the
one from Family Tree DNA retrieved from GenBank with
accession number EU073971. Transition T195C is probably part of the basal motif of H11, as identified in three
complete genomes [6,27]. Our data also support the
unnamed cluster identified by [17] characterized by the
transition G7337A (and also T13326C). It can be tentatively said that H17 is additionally identified by position
G16129A; however, so far there is only one complete
genome available supporting this fact (AY495154; [23]).
Demographic expansion and coalescence times
In order to estimate the time of the most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA) of the different R0-subclades, two different approaches were applied: on the one hand, the
shape of the distribution of the number of observed differences between pairs of entire control region sequences
(16024–16569; 1–576) was used for timing expansions
[28]. The mismatch distribution is usually multimodal in
samples drawn from populations at demographic equilibrium, as it reflects the highly stochastic shape of gene
trees, but it is usually unimodal in populations having
passed through a recent demographic expansion [29,30]
or through a range expansion with high levels of migration between neighbouring demes [31,32]. On the other
hand, model-free rho statistics [33] were calculated on the
basis of HVS-I (16024–16365) and entire control region
sequences and used for estimating the coalescence time of

the different subclades. Finally, the results were compared
to each other and to so far published estimates (Table 5).
Interestingly, although different sequence ranges were
used and different mathematical and conceptually different methods were applied, the estimates of the majority of
subclades corresponded well with each other. In general,
it can be said that most hg H sub-lineages show a strong
signal for the beginning of the population expansion after
the LGM, covering the Late Pleistocene and early
Holocene.
The coalescence age for the entire hg H was estimated as
18.7 ± 2.4 thousand years ago (kya) using the parameter τ
from the MMD of the entire CR, and 17.4 ± 4.1 kya using
rho statistics based on HVS-I. Both estimates are in good
concordance with each other and with the estimate from
[6] (18.4 ± 2.0 kya). The expected and the observed MMD
for hg H were found to be in good agreement (Figure 4),
with an SSD P value of 0.312. SSD P values > 0.05 hint to
the adequacy of the sudden expansion model, thus making the observed mismatch distributions compatible with
the estimated parameters [28]. Despite an apparent lack of
goodness-of-fit of some distributions (Figure 4), the adequacy of the sudden expansion model could only be
rejected for hg H5 (SSD P value = 0.006). Interestingly, the
rho estimate derived from entire CR sequences was low
(11.0 ± 1.5 kya).
The near eastern hg R0a, which is geographically centred
in the midst of the Arabian Peninsula [4], was estimated
to have expanded between 26.4 ± 9.1 kya (rho statistics
from the CR) and 35.0 ± 6.6 kya (MMD); the estimate
derived from HVS-I lay in between (30.3 ± 12.4 kya).

The oldest sublineage of hg H was found to be H14, with
highly concordant estimates for the TMRCA of 25.6 ± 5.4
kya (MMD) respectively 23.7 ± 8.6 kya (rho statistics). As
in hg H, the estimate derived from CR rho statistics was
lowest (20.6 ± 8.3 kya).
Consistent estimates for the TMRCA using both computational methods were obtained for most of the hgs (e.g. H,
H1, H1a, H5, H6, H7, H13a1, H14, H15, H16) (Table 5).
However, apart from H1 and H13a1, where our three estimates (MMD, rho statistics from entire CR and from HVSI sequences) were highly consistent with each other,
matching estimates were derived by comparing the MMD
estimate with rho statistics from either CR or HVS-I
sequences. In hgs H11 and HV0 the different approached
used yielded very different mean values but associated
with very large and overlapping confidence intervals.
Published estimates for the coalescence time of hg H3 lay
at 16.0 ± 8.1 kya [17] or 10.3 ± 2.4 kya [6]. Our estimates
were 10.2 ± 5.0 kya (MMD), 10.2 ± 2.8 kya (rho CR) and
16.7 ± 6.1 kya (rho HVS-I). Thus, both our values (MMD
and rho) derived from entire control region sequences fit
very well with the estimate from coding region sequences,
while our rho estimate from HVS-I sequences fits well
with the Roostalu's et al. HVS-I appraisal. It seems that
HVS-I sequences in hg H3 do not correspond to the
molecular clock calibration from the Eurasian tree, in a
sense that mutations in HVS-I occur at a higher rate in H3
compared to phylogenetically closely related lineages.
Most recently, molecular dating has been questioned fundamentally, and the calibration of the molecular clock of
the mtDNA control region as basic requirement for timing

the most recent common ancestor has led to an ongoing
discussion (for a review see [34,35]). However, occasional
concerns that the molecular clock might be elusive and
not tick regularly for human mtDNA were widely eliminated [35]. A coding-region rate estimate of 5140 years
per substitution [36] corresponds well with estimates for
the HVS-I rate [33] and with a rate of one control-region
mutation per 9250 years for the Eurasian tree [35] and can
be used to estimate the coalescence time of various haplogroups of the mtDNA phylogeny. A straight forward way
to estimate the age of a particular "root" haplotype, given
the mutation rate, is to consider all available descendant

individual sequences and take the arithmetic mean over
all distances to the root haplotype. This method is referred
to as "rho" estimation [33] and can be performed using
the freely available software package Network.
One of the disadvantages of the simple rho method is the
conversion of DNA-data into files that can be handled
with the network program. Without some in-house executables that assist the conversion, this would be an elaborate and error-prone process. On the other hand,
network offers the calculation of the standard error of rho,
which would be very complicated if calculated by hand.

Backbone of the phylogenetic tree of R0 subclades. Mutations are transitions unless the base change is explicitly indicated. Deletions are indicated by a "d" following the deleted nucleotides. Underlining indicates recurrent mutations, whereas
mutations in grey were added when observed with a high frequency in a certain branch. Mutations in grey boxes can be targeted with the SNP-multiplex published in [12].

The estimation of the demographic parameter τ from the
mismatch distributions between pairs of sequences can be
performed with ARLEQUIN, which seems to be more
user-friendly regarding data import. One of the disadvantages of this method is that it does not account for the rate
heterogeneity of the different mutations, and that it needs
calibration against an archaeological or historical record.

ing. Under this perspective, it seems advisable to follow
both approaches for timing the coalescence age of phylogenetic clusters, and to put the estimates into a geologicalhistorical context. In general, more complete genome
information is desirable in order to get more accurate estimates.

The observed differences between the two approaches
might thus rely on the slightly imprecise estimate of the
mtDNA control region's molecular clock affecting the rho
estimate and on the disregard of variation in site-specific
mutation rates affecting the MMD estimation.

Genetic variability within R0-subhaplogroups
Hg H1 accounted for 12.4% of the samples and showed a
high diversity in terms of different lineages (Additional
file 2; mean number of pairwise differences: 4.92). Reticulations within H1 were mainly caused by mutational
hotspots in the control region that emerged in its different
sub-hgs, such as variation at 16129, 16189, etc.

It seems that the rho statistics derived from entire CRsequences tends to underestimate the TMRCA, while the
rho statistics derived from HVS-I sequences tends to predate the TMRCA. This is most likely due to the calibration
of the molecular clock of the different DNA stretches of
the mitochondrial genome, which need further fine-tun-

Hg H2a represented 4.6% of the samples and displayed
less genetic variation (Additional file 3; mean number of
pairwise differences: 4.62). The control region marker 456
identifies hg H1d [17] and H5, but also popped up on an
H2a2 background and led to one reticulation in the H2a

network. This transition is however slightly unstable since
it appears frequently in other non-H hg backgrounds,
such as hg K [37].
Hg H3 was assigned to 5.6% of samples and was characterized by several clusters of identical profiles, thus implying little genetic differentiation (Additional file 4; mean
number of pairwise differences: 3.06). The network of
Additional file 4 shows just two reticulations provoked by
two fast control region variants, T152C and T16311C.
Hg H4 corresponded to 2.5% of the samples, and showed
very little genetic variation (Additional file 5; mean
number of pairwise differences: 3.12). As in hg H3, mutations at position 16311 were responsible for network
reticulations.
Hg H5 was realized in 9.2% of samples and revealed an
enormous amount of lineage diversity (Additional file 6;
mean number of pairwise differences: 4.51), especially
when compared to the putatively same-aged Hg H3.
Again, some fast positions are responsible for a number of
reticulations, 146, 152, etc.
Hg H6 appeared in 3.1% of the samples and in relation to
its relatively recent arrival in Europe (~9.7 kya), it exhib-

ited pronounced genetic diversification (Additional file 7;
mean number of pairwise differences: 2.97).
Hg H7 rendered for 3.9% of samples and demonstrated
perfect tree-like evolution of lineages (Additional file 8;
mean number of pairwise differences: 2.61).
Hgs H8, H9, H12, H17 and H21 could be differentiated in
less than 0.5% of samples each. Due to small sample sizes,
corresponding networks could only be constructed for H8
(Additional file 9) and H17 (Additional file 10).
Hg H10 was determined in 3.3% of the sequences but
manifested hardly any genetic heterogeneity (Additional
file 11; mean number of pairwise differences: 1.70).
Hg H11 encompassed 2.6% of the profiles and was estimated to have arisen 43.9 kya [17]. With respect to its frequency, its genetic distinction (Additional file 12; mean
number of pairwise differences: 4.67) and our TMRCA
estimations, the age estimate of [17] seems overstated.
Hg H13a1 comprised 2.7% of samples and similar to hg
H7, the profiles grouped in big clusters mirroring a perfect
tree-like pattern of evolution (Additional file 13; mean
number of pairwise differences: 2.60).

Figure 4 distributions within 18 different sub-hgs of R0 analyzed for the entire mitochondrial DNA control region
Mismatch
Mismatch distributions within 18 different sub-hgs of R0 analyzed for the entire mitochondrial DNA control
region. Upper and lower limits represent 95% confidence intervals for the mismatch distributions. In all cases, an infinite-sites
mutation model was used, assuming gamma distribution of mutation rates (α = 0.2).

Hg H14 and H16 covered 1.3% of sequences each, but the
network of H14 (Additional file 14; mean number of pairwise differences: 5.84) indicated higher genetic diverseness than the network of H16 (Additional file 15; mean
number of pairwise differences: 1.80).
Hg H15 embraced 1.5% of samples and was characterized
by an array of uncommon mutations that led to a reticulation-free structure of the network (Additional file 16;
mean number of pairwise differences: 4.91).
Hg H* (without the above described sub-hgs) was found
in 25.6% of samples and showed an amazingly high grade
of diversification (Additional file 17; mean number of
pairwise differences: 4.13).
Hg R0a spanned only 1.5% of samples, but the corresponding network suggest an old age of the hg, with a

complete tree-like structure (Additional file 18; mean
number of pairwise differences: 5.85).
Hgs V, HV* (without H), HV1, HV0 and HV0a together
comprehended 5.3% of the study individuals and map
onto a straightforward phylogenetic network, with reticulations mainly caused by mutations on position 72 (Additional file 19).

Conclusion
Our analysis of 1,350 mtDNA haplotypes belonging to
R0, the most common hg-cluster in West Eurasia, revealed
significant differences in the distribution of different subhgs even between geographically closely located regions.
Given an estimated coalescence time of the distinct lineages of 10 – 18 kya, the differences in the distributions
could hint to either limited maternal gene flow after the
LGM due to the alpine nature of the regions involved, or

to a stochastic loss of diversity due to environmental
events and/or disease episodes occurred at different times
and in distinctive regions (e.g. Black Plague between
1347–1666), or most likely, to genetic drift, particularly
strong for less frequent haplogroups as most of R0 subhaplogroups characterized here.
Our comparison of two different ways of obtaining the
timing of the TMRCA confirms that the time of a sudden
expansion (τ) can be adequately recovered from control
region data with valid confidence intervals. The observed
differences between the two approaches might rely on the
slightly imprecise estimate of the mtDNA control region's
molecular clock affecting the rho estimate and on the disregard of variation in site-specific mutation rates affecting
the MMD estimation. So for reliable estimates, both procedures should be applied in order to cross-check the
results for validity and soundness.

remaining polymorphisms within the control region were
assigned weight 10. All coding region SNPs were assigned
weight 25. Length heteroplasmic C-insertions at 309 and
315 were weighted by zero.

Methods
DNA samples
A total of 1,350 samples that belong to the hg cluster R0
were selected from five West Eurasian populations and
one population from the Middle East, corresponding to a
total of 3,569 samples. The majority of samples came
from Austria (nr. of total samples: 2,487; nr. of R0-samples: 973) [12,38], the donors of the remaining samples
originated in Germany (nr. of total samples: 100; nr. of
R0-samples: 31) [39], Hungary (nr. of total samples: 173;
nr. of R0-samples: 71) [40], Macedonia (nr. of total samples: 200; nr. of R0-samples: 100) [41], Romania (nr. of
total samples: 360; nr. of R0-samples: 124) [19] and
Dubai (nr. of total samples: 249; nr. of R0-samples: 51)
[42].
Genotyping
All samples were sequenced for the entire mtDNA control
region (positions 16024–16569; 1–576) as described in
[38] and screened for hg R0-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms within the mtDNA coding region as
described in [12]. 847 Austrian samples had already been
typed for the 45 coding region SNPs before [12] and were
sequenced for the entire control region for the present
study. Of the remaining 503 samples the control region
sequences had been generated before [19,38-42] and the
coding region SNPs were additionally typed for the
present study.
Phylogenetic reconstructions
Phylogenetic networks were constructed with Network.exe [43] applying the median joining algorithm [44]
with the parameter epsilon set to 0. Polymorphisms
within the control region were divided into five classes
roughly according to their presumptive mutation rate
[35]. Superfast positions (152, 16519, insertions at 573)

Population genetic analysis
ARLEQUIN (Version 2.0; [45]) was used for the calculation of haplotype frequencies and analysis of molecular
variance (AMOVA). Permutation tests (1,000 replicates)
were used to evaluate the significance of FST inter-population genetic distances. For all population genetic analyses,
length heteroplasmic C-insertions were not taken into
consideration.
Demographic expansion and coalescence ages
The mismatch distributions (MMDs) within hgs (based
on entire control region sequences) were calculated as the
distribution of the observed number of differences
between pairs of haplotypes with ARLEQUIN. The age of
the demographic expansion, i.e. the demographic parameter τ, was estimated from the mismatch distributions of
the different R0 subclades using a generalized nonlinear
least-square approach [28]. The demographic parameter τ
was calculated by minimizing the sum of square deviations (SSD) between the observed mismatch distribution
and its expectation under an infinite-sites model. Approximate confidence intervals for τ were obtained by parametric bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. In order to test
the validity of the sudden expansion model, SSD was
complementarily used as a test statistic. The conversion of
the expansion time τ into years since a population entered
a demographic expansion phase was performed according
to the equation τ = 2 ut, where u is the total mutation rate
per generation per gene and t is the number of generations
passed since the demographic expansion. Assuming a
(matrilineal) generation time of 25 years, and dating the
age of hg H at 18,400 years [6], u is estimated as 0.0022 in
correlation with a value for τ of 3.3 (Table 5).

As a complementary model-free approach to date the
most recent common ancestor of R0 sub-clades, medianjoining networks of hypervariable segment I (HVS-I)
sequences (16024–16365) and of entire control region
sequences were constructed with the parameters as
described above. The rho (ρ) statistics were calculated as
the average number of mutations from the nodes to the
root of the sub-hg networks and scaled by the mutation
rate for HVS-I, where one transitional step was taken equal
to 20,180 years [33], or by the rate of one control region
mutation per 9,250 years [35]. Standard deviations for age
estimates were calculated as in [46].
