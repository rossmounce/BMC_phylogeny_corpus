Abstract
Background: Karl Ernst Von Baer noted that species tend to show greater morphological
divergence in later stages of development when compared to earlier stages. Darwin originally
interpreted these observations via a selectionist framework, suggesting that divergence should be
greatest during ontogenic stages in which organisms experienced varying 'conditions of existence'
and opportunity for differential selection. Modern hypotheses have focused on the notion that
genes and structures involved in early development will be under stronger purifying selection due
to the deleterious pleiotropic effects of mutations propagating over the course of ontogeny, also
known as the developmental constraint hypothesis.
Results: Using developmental stage-specific expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries, we tested the
2 hypotheses by comparing the rates of evolution of 7,180 genes obtained from 6 species of the
Drosophila melanogaster group with respect to ontogeny, and sex and reproduction-related
functions in gonadal tissues. Supporting morphological observations, we found evidence of a
pattern of increasing mean evolutionary rate in genes that are expressed in subsequent stages of
development. Furthermore, supporting expectations that early expressed genes are constrained in
divergence, we found that embryo stage genes are involved in a higher mean number of interactions
as compared to later stages. We noted that the accelerated divergence of genes in the adult stage
is explained by those expressed specifically in the male gonads, whose divergence is driven by
positive selection. In addition, accelerated gonadal gene divergence occurs only in the adult stage,
suggesting that the effects of selection are observed primarily at the stages during which they are
expected occur. Finally, we also found a significant correlation between temporal specificity of gene
expression and evolutionary rate, supporting expectations that genes with ubiquitous expression
are under stronger constraint.
Conclusion: Taken together, these results support both the developmental constraint hypothesis
limiting the divergence of early expressed developmentally important genes, leading to a gradient
of divergence rates over ontogeny (embryonic < larval/pupal < adult), as well as Darwin's 'selection
opportunity' hypothesis leading to increased divergence in adults, particularly in the case of
reproductive tissues. We suggest that a constraint early/opportunity late model best explains
divergence over ontogeny.

Background
For over a century, developmental biologists have noted
an ontogenic pattern among evolutionary relationships:
earlier developmental stages are morphologically more
similar across species than later stages; this is also known
as Von Baer's third law [1-4]. While more recent studies in
vertebrates have determined that the very earliest stages of
ontogeny (for example, gastrulation) may be subject to
substantial variation even among closely related species,
upon reaching the tailbud stage, embryos begin to share
more similarity in appearance that gradually declines with
subsequent development [5]. This 'hourglass' model of
developmental similarity among vertebrates suggests that,
while certain stages of development undergo substantial
change over evolutionary time, there exists a significant
conservation of the mechanisms underlying development
across vertebrates [6-9]. Darwin originally interpreted Von
Baer's observations via a selectionist framework [10,11].
He suggested that divergence should be greatest during
ontogenic stages in which organisms experienced the
most varying 'conditions of existence' and, as a result,
occasioned opportunity for differential selection [2].
Embryos of varied species are therefore more similar than
adults due to exposure to very similar fetal environments.
Furthermore, he noted that derived features rarely
appeared in an organism before the stage when they were
used, indicating that the effect of selection was also specific to the stage where selection pressure actually
occurred. This observation was important to his overall
hypothesis, as selection pressures occurring during one
stage that selected for traits expressed in other stages
would be inconsistent with Von Baer's observations.
Using secondary sexual traits as a primary example, Darwin compiled a large number of observations indicating
that male-specific structures known to be highly divergent
even among closely related species rarely developed until
reproductive maturity was reached [10,12].
Modern interpretations of Von Baer's third law have
focused on another, non-mutually exclusive mechanism:
genes implicated in early aspects of development are more
likely to regulate a large number of downstream effectors
via hierarchical regulatory cascades, and are thus more
evolutionarily constrained due to the large deleterious
pleiotropic effects of mutations. This is known as the
developmental constraint hypothesis [3,13,14]. The complex hierarchical nature of gene regulatory networks has
become a focus of major interest in the field of organismal
development [15,16] with special attention being paid in
particular to those network modules critical to early development and conserved over broad evolutionary distances
[17]. For instance, the well known homeotic genes
involved in establishing the anterior/posterior axis in the
early development of most metazoans provide a striking
example of highly conserved genes whose mutations are
known to have extensive pleiotropic consequences [18-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/42

20]. These transcription factors are also known to act as
master regulatory switches in cascades involved in regulating the proper expression of many downstream, developmentally important effectors [21]. Another example is the
gene regulatory feedback loop required for endoderm
specification in echinoderms, which encodes several transcription factors whose inactivation has catastrophic
effects on the entire body plan [17,22]. These instances
highlight the strength of purifying selection acting on specific genes known to be involved in complex developmental regulatory networks; however a more recent interest
has concerned the broader evolutionary patterns of the
genome with respect to ontogeny.
The evolutionary dynamics of genes expressed over the
course of development have recently been examined at
the genomic level in the case of flies and nematodes, using
microarray-based information about the developmental
timing of gene expression [23-25]. Castillo-Davis and
Hartl [23] used previously published, developmental
stage-specific microarray data [26] in order to compare
the rates of coding sequence divergence of a relatively
small number of genes (224) between Caenorhabditis elegans and C. briggsae (20 million to 120 million years
diverged (MYD)). Genes in their dataset were classified
either as 'non-modulated' genes (that is, invariant in
expression level over development), early-expressed genes
(that is, embryonic), or late-expressed genes (that is, larval
and adult) based on the developmental stage at which
their peak level of expression occurred. The authors found
no significant difference in the rates of protein evolution
among the three categories, though the early-expressed
genes showed a higher rate of synonymous substitution as
well as a lower codon usage bias (CUB) than lateexpressed genes. The analysis of the same 2 species was
subsequently refined by Cutter and Ward [24] using a
larger dataset of 7,281 genes and a larger source of developmental expression data [27,28]. Their results support
some theoretical predictions of both the developmental
constraint as well as Darwin's 'selection opportunity'
hypothesis: when genes were classified based on the stage
at which their peak expression level occurred, adult genes
were found to be evolving more rapidly than those in the
earlier, larval stage. Expression level in the larval stage, relative to the adult, was also found to be negatively correlated with sequence divergence, while the opposite was
observed for expression in adults. However, the authors
noted no unidirectional trend in evolutionary rates in
genes expressed over the course of embryogenesis, as
would be predicted by the developmental constraint
hypothesis, leading them to suggest that constraint may
not explain the evolutionary rates of proteins expressed
during embryonic development in these species. Furthermore, when examining the tissue specificity of genes
expressed in adult nematodes, the authors found that the
majority, though not all, of the acceleration in evolutionPage 2 of 14

ary rate observed in this stage was explained by genes
expressed primarily in the male gametes, providing evidence of a significant effect of sexual selection, presumably acting through sperm competition between males and
hermaphrodites or antagonistic coevolution between
genes expressed in sperm and oocytes [24].
Davis et al. [25] used the results of a microarray study of
the expression levels of 4,028 genes over the course of
Drosophila melanogaster ontogeny [29] and examined their
rates of sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and
D. pseudoobscura (25 to 55 MYD). They noted that gene
expression level in the late embryo relative to later stages
was negatively correlated with sequence divergence, while
the opposite was observed in the case of adult males.
However, the authors noted no significant correlation
between expression levels and sequence divergence for the
many of the sampled developmental stages. Unfortunately the species pairs used in both of these studies were
quite distantly diverged and thus interpretation of these
data is limited due to the saturation of synonymous site
divergence (dS), which largely prevents investigation of
questions regarding evidence of selection [30,31]. Furthermore, comparisons at such evolutionary distances
allow the possibility that expression patterns (for example, time of expression, sex bias, and so on) have diverged
between species, questioning whether similar selective
pressures are acting along both lineages at the level of
individual genes [32].
Holometabolic insects such as Drosophila provide an
excellent model for studying gene evolution over ontogeny as they pass through four separate, unambiguous
developmental stages (embryo, larva, pupa, and adult). A
large body of information about the evolutionary dynamics of the genomes of drosophilids has accumulated,
aided significantly by the recent release and analysis of the
complete genomes of 12 Drosophila species [33]. However, the relationship between development and genomic
evolution remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze a
larger dataset than was previously available, using information generated from publicly available developmental
stage-specific expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries to
assign genes to specific developmental stages and determine their evolutionary patterns within the D. melanogaster group, allowing more reliable estimates of
divergence parameters as well as reducing the caveats
associated with comparing distantly related species [25].
We report a gradient of increasing mean evolutionary rate
in genes expressed in subsequent stages of fly development, culminating in exaggerated gene sequence divergence specifically in adult males. When comparing genes
expressed specifically in the gonads of embryos to adults,
we found that the increased rate of divergence observed in
adults is explained entirely by those genes expressed in the
testis. No such pattern of accelerated gene divergence is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/42

observed in the embryonic gonads, supporting Darwin's
expectations that selection pressures should act predominantly in the stage where the opportunity for selection
occurs [10]. Finally, when classifying genes into specific
developmental stages using a series of increasing stagespecificity thresholds, we found a significant correlation
between specificity of temporal stage of expression and
evolutionary rate. We also reanalyzed the dataset used by
Davis et al. [25] using our methods in order to refine their
estimates of divergence and test the generality of their
results (Additional files 1, 2, and 3). Taken together, our
results support both developmental constraint acting to
limit the divergence of early expressed, developmentally
important genes [5,8], as well as the notion that accelerated divergence in adults is primarily due to increased
selection pressures occurring during this stage.

Results
Analysis of the EST library-based developmental profile
We obtained developmental stage specific information for
7,180 genes found in the 6 species of the D. melanogaster
group (~17 MYD) [34] in the Drosophila 12 Genomes
Consortium dataset [33] from UniGene [35] (see Methods), representing an approximate 2.5-fold increase in
size over the Drosophila developmental timecourse dataset
used by Davis et al. [25]. We were unable to obtain separate libraries representing the larval and pupal stages,
therefore we pooled all available EST libraries into three
developmental stages based on the stage during which
they were generated: embryonic, larval/pupal, and adult.
Genes were classified into developmental stages based on
the stage during which they show their highest proportion
of representation in the EST libraries, under the assumption that this represents a biologically reasonable proxy of
when the majority of a gene's function(s) occur. However,
given that such a method of classification may be subject
to complications arising from normal within individual
variation in gene expression levels, we reclassified genes
using increasing stage-specificity thresholds (see Methods,
Table 1 and Additional file 4).

As a test of our assumption that a gene's highest stage of
expression is also the stage during which the majority of
its functions occur, we performed pairwise comparisons
of the lists of genes classified at each stage for each specificity threshold using FatiGO [36,37] (Additional file 5).
We found that certain 'biological process' gene ontology
(GO) terms associated with temporal-specific functions
were consistently over-represented among genes classified
into the stage(s) during which such functions were
expected to occur. For instance, in the embryogenic versus
adult comparison, terms associated with development
and regulation (for example, 'regulation of biological
process' (GO:0050789), and 'multicellular organismal
development' (GO:0007275)) were consistently over-represented among genes classified as embryonic, while

terms associated with detection and response to external
stimuli were over-represented among genes classified as
adult
(for
example,
'detection
of
stimulus'
(GO:0051606), and 'response to abiotic stimulus'
(GO:0009628)). Similar trends were observed in the comparison between the combined larval and pupal stages
versus the adult stage, where for example, the term 'postembryonic development' (GO:0009791) was over-represented among larval/pupal genes, as expected. In the comparison between the embryonic versus larval/pupal stages
terms associated with regulation (for example, 'regulation
of biological process' (GO:0050789)) tend to be over-represented among embryonic genes while those associated
with energy metabolism (for example, 'generation of precursor metabolites and energy' (GO:0006091) and 'carbohydrate metabolic process' (GO:0005975)) tend to be
over-represented in the larval/pupal stage, as may be
expected given the large amount of organismal growth
occurring during the larval stage [38]. Curiously, the term
'sexual reproduction' (GO:0019953) is consistently overrepresented among genes classified as being specific to the
embryonic and larval/pupal stages as compared to the
adult stage (Additional file 5). These genes may be associated with organogenesis of sexual organs, which occurs
prior to adulthood, or with spermatogenesis, which
begins in the third instar larval stage [39]. However, in
general, terms were over-represented in pairwise comparisons in the expected direction, providing support to our
assumption of an association between expression level
and temporal function.

We found that adult stage genes are evolving more rapidly
than earlier stages in non-synonymous site divergence
(dN), dS, and dN/dS at most specificity thresholds (KruskalWallis rank sum test P < 0.01; Bonferroni correction was
applied to all pairwise comparisons) (Figure 1, Additional
file 5). Moreover, at all specificity thresholds, genes classified into the larval/pupal stage experience a higher dN/dS
than those of the embryonic stage (P < 0.05). To our
knowledge, this represents the first empirical evidence of
a gradient in evolutionary rates spanning the whole of
Drosophila ontogeny, wherein genes represented at their
highest level in the adult are evolving more rapidly than
those in the pooled larval and pupal stages, and both are
evolving more rapidly than those in the embryonic stage
(that is, embryonic < larval/pupal < adult). Under most
specificity thresholds, the dN of larval/pupal genes was
also significantly greater than those of embryo genes;
however, the dS of larval/pupal genes was significantly
lower than that of embryonic genes, such that the relationship among stages in terms of the dS was larval/pupal
< embryonic < adult (Additional file 6). Previous studies
have demonstrated a positive relationship between tissue
specificity of expression and evolutionary rate, presumably due to selection against the deleterious pleiotropic
effect of mutation restricting the divergence of broadly
expressed genes [40-42]. We sought to test for a similar
relationship between temporal specificity of gene expression (that is, stage specificity) and the rate of evolution by
comparing the mean dN/dS between our specificity thresholds at each of our three developmental stage classifica-

developmental stages, but also that the proportion of
genes showing evidence of positive selection should
increase with subsequent developmental stages [43]. We
tested this prediction by performing pairwise comparisons of the proportion of genes showing significant evidence of positive selection using the comparison between
models 7 and 8 in phylogenetic analysis by maximum
likelihood (PAML) [44] according to the Drosophila 12
Genomes Consortium data [33], at each stage and for
each specificity threshold (Additional file 4). After applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, we found
no significant differences in the proportion of genes
showing evidence of positive selection in any pairwise
comparisons between stages (Additional file 9).

the distributions between stages within a specificity threshold

within a stage were also found to be statistically significant in
most pairwise comparisons (P < 0.05) (Additional file 7).

tions (Figure 1). We performed Bonferroni corrected,
pairwise permuted Kruskal-Wallis tests between the distributions of divergence parameters at each of the specificity
thresholds within each stage (Additional file 7), and
found that there is a clear relationship between the stage
specificity of representation in EST libraries and the mean
evolutionary rate of genes at that stage: for most comparisons, the more specific a gene's representation at a particular stage, the higher its rate of divergence (P < 0.05)
(Figure 1). The large confidence intervals associated with
the larval/pupal stage are likely due to a reduced number
of genes classified as specific to this stage, especially in the
case of the higher specificity thresholds (Table 1). Similar
results are seen in the case of dN, however, in the case of dS
there was no significant difference between specificity
thresholds (Additional file 8), with the exception of the
adult stage, where the highest specificity thresholds have
a significantly higher dS than low specificity thresholds
(for example, genes showing greater adult stage specificity
tend to have a higher dS) (Additional file 7).
The selection opportunity hypothesis [10] predicts not
only that the average rate of change must increase over

Stage specificity of selection pressure
A key postulate of the selection opportunity hypothesis
[10] is that the effects of late-stage acting selective pressures primarily affect features specific to the stage at which
they occur. As a test of this hypothesis, we sought to compare the effect of expression of genes within gonads relative to those expressed in the rest of the body at the two
stages in which we had tissue-specific EST library representation information: embryo and adult. Genes were
separately classified into either four different stage/tissue
categories (embryonic general, embryonic gonads, adult
general, and adult gonads) or five tissue categories
(wherein the adult gonad library is separated into adult
ovary or adult testis) (see Methods, Table 1 and Additional file 4). It should be noted that the 'embryonic general' class was generated from whole-body tissue
(including the gonads), and also that in the generation of
the embryonic gonad EST libraries individuals were not
sexed, and thus the ESTs reflect undifferentiated gonads
pooled from both sexes [45].

We found that genes classified as being expressed in combined adult gonads are evolving significantly more rapidly
than all other stages in dN, dS, and dN/dS at all specificity
thresholds (P < 0.01), with sole exception of the comparison between the dS of adult and embryonic gonads,
which is non-significant (Figure 2, Additional files 10 and
11). When adult gonads are separated into either 'adult
ovary' or 'adult testis', we found that only genes expressed
in the testes showed an accelerated mean rate of evolution
(dN and dN/dS) relative to other stages. Under those specificity thresholds where a significant difference in evolutionary rate was found between adult ovaries and other
tissues, the mean rate of evolution of genes expressed in
the ovaries was significantly lower than the other tissues
(P < 0.05; Figure 2; Additional files 10 and 11). Contrary
to what is observed in the adult, genes expressed in the
embryonic gonads are evolving more slowly than nongonadal tissues (dN and dN/dS; P < 0.05). We found no
consistent significant differences in the rate of evolution

between genes expressed in non-gonadal adult or embryonic tissue, supporting the results of previous studies indicating that gonadal expression plays a large role in
explaining evolutionary rate differences in the adult stage
[24,25].
As in the case of genes classified into specific stages, we
performed pairwise comparisons of the proportion of
genes showing evidence of positive selection for each tissue/stage and for each specificity threshold. Again, no
comparisons were statistically significant after Bonferroni
correction, with the sole exception that genes classified as
unique to the adult testis have a significantly higher proportion of genes showing evidence of positive selection
than genes classified as unique to the adult general category (χ2 value = 8.76, df = 1, P = 0.0308) (Additional

Gene interaction profiles during development
The development constraint hypothesis is predicated on
the notion that development is coordinated by hierarchical genetic networks [15,16,46] and therefore features of
early development are more likely to be constrained by
selection against the deleterious pleiotropic effects of
mutations [3,5,17]. A logical prediction of such theory is
that genes involved in earlier stages of development
should represent more central regulatory nodes and, on
average, be involved in more interactions as a consequence. Using the BioGRID database [47] we obtained the
total number of interactions associated with each gene
from the EST-based dataset for which interaction information was available, resulting in a total of 4,422 genes
involved in 34,462 interactions (Additional file 12). We
found a significantly higher mean number of interactions
per gene for genes specific to the embryonic stage as compared to the larval/pupal stage at no specificity threshold
and a greater than twofold proportional representation
threshold (Kruskal-Wallis permuted rank sum test, P =
0.0162 and 0.0003, respectively; Table 2; Additional files
12 and 13). The mean number of interactions was also
higher for genes specific to the embryo as compared to the
adult stage at most specificity thresholds (P < 0.05; Additional file 13). All other comparisons, including those
between the larva/pupal and adult stages were non-significant. In order to minimize the potential effect of stagespecific ascertainment bias in the BioGRID database's
genetic interaction data (that is, a greater proportion of
genetic interaction experiments are likely performed during embryogenesis), we also performed the same analysis
using only BioGRID's data on direct protein-protein interactions (yeast two-hybrid system; 4,092 genes involved in
23,712 interactions; Additional file 13). Our results
remained qualitatively unchanged when using all yeast
two-hybrid interaction data, however the majority of statistically significant comparisons disappeared when we
limited our analysis only to the 'high-confidence interactions' as defined by Giot et al. [48] (2,736 genes involved
in 5,589 interactions, Additional file 13), though the
embryonic stage continues to show a higher mean
number of interactions as compared to the larval/pupal
stage at no specificity threshold and a greater than twofold
proportional representation threshold (P = 0.0165 and
0.0471, respectively).

When comparing the average number of interactions per
gene between gonadal and non-gonadal tissues in the
adult and embryonic stages, we observed significantly
fewer interactions in both the adult non-gonad and adult
gonad categories as compared to the embryonic general
category at no specificity threshold and a greater than twofold proportion of representation threshold (P < 0.05).
The embryonic gonad category showed a significantly
higher mean number of interactions than both adult gen-

Classifications using no threshold and greater than twofold proportional representation threshold are shown. (n) Indicates the number of genes in
each category. Larval/pupal represents the pooled larval and pupal stages. The average number of interactions per stage was found to be statistically
significantly higher in the embryonic stage as compare to the other two stages (P < 0.5). When the adult stage is separately classified into general,
ovaries, and testis categories, only the general and testis categories show a statistically significantly fewer average number of interactions than the
embryonic categories, when significant (Additional file 12).

eral and adult gonad categories only when no specificity
threshold was used in classification (P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). No other pairwise comparisons of mean
number of interactions per gene were statistically significantly different, including both within-stage comparisons
of gonadal to non-gonadal tissue. When adult gonads
were separated into either ovary or testis-specific genes,
only genes classified as testis specific had significantly
fewer mean interactions (P < 0.05 at no specificity threshold and a greater than twofold proportion of representation threshold). We then reanalyzed the data using only
direct protein-protein interactions and again, results were
qualitatively similar, though no pairwise comparison was
statistically significant after Bonferroni correction when
adult ovaries and testes were classified separately (with
the sole exception of the embryo general category which
shows a significantly higher mean number of interactions
than the adult general category using no specificity threshold, P = 0.0180). Also similarly, limiting our analysis to
'high-confidence' interactions resulted in most of the significant comparisons to becoming non-significant, likely
owing to the smaller total number of interactions as compared to the total dataset (Additional file 13).
Previous studies have demonstrated a significant negative
correlation between the total number of interactions in
which genes were involved and their rate of evolution
[49,50]. Given our observation that increased stage specificity was positively correlated with evolutionary rate, we
tested for a significant correlation between the number of

stages in which a gene was represented and its number of
interactions. We found a significant positive correlation
between the number of stages in which genes are represented and the number of interactions in which they are
involved (Kendall rank sum correlation test τ = 0.0848, P
= 4.501 × 10-12).

Discussion
Our study provides molecular confirmation of two different but non-mutually exclusive hypotheses seeking to
explain Von Baer's 'Third Law', noting that morphological
similarity among organisms tends to decrease over ontogeny [1]. Our findings consist of (1) evidence for stronger
purifying selection during embryonic development as predicted by the modern developmental constraint hypothesis [3,5], (2) evidence for selection-driven accelerated
divergence of genes in the adult stage, exemplified by
those expressed in males, as predicted by Darwin [10],
and (3) the existence of a temporal pleiotropy restricting
the divergence of genes that are broadly expressed over the
course of development.
Expression patterns across the Drosophila phylogeny
All developmental and spatial representation of gene
expression information in our study is based on data collected in D. melanogaster, therefore an underlying assumption is made that developmental and spatial expression
patterns, or more specifically that the stage/tissue of highest expression level, do not vary significantly among species of the D. melanogaster subgroup. While several studies

BMC Biology 2009, 7:42

have shown considerable variation in expression levels
between species at the adult stage [51,52], to our knowledge, there are no studies that have directly compared
expression levels between species over development on a
large scale. A study conducted by Rifkin et al. [53] found
that approximately 17% of genes surveyed (2,193/
12,866) had significant differences between species in the
degree to which genes in expression pattern changed during the onset of metamorphosis in D. melanogaster, D.
simulans, and D. yakuba. However, it is unclear if such
changes imply that the stage of highest level of expression
changes between species. Regardless, if patterns of expression varied considerably between the species used in our
study, we would expect this to add noise to the evolutionary signals we observed rather than produce systematic
biases in our dataset.
Divergence patterns over development
The results of our analysis indicate that sequence follows
the pattern observed in morphology over the course of
development: we observed a positive gradient in the rates
of divergence (dN and dN/dS) in subsequent stages of
ontogeny (Figure 1, Additional file 1). However, in the
case of the synonymous rate of substitution, dS is highest
in adults and lowest in the larval/pupal stage (that is, larval/pupal < embryonic < adult) (Additional file 8). These
observations are consistent with either (a) systematic variation in the level of codon usage bias between developmental stages, or (b) a systematic difference in the rate of
mutation between stages of development. A recent study
performed by Vicario et al. [38] confirmed that CUB varies
significantly among developmental stages when estimated in both D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Furthermore, the pattern of variation in CUB that they
observed (adult < embryonic < larval) mirrors the rate of
synonymous substitution measured at each stage in our
study, consistent with CUB being responsible for the patterns of variation in dS that we observe (that is, high CUB
reduces dS by selecting against substitutions generating
non-optimal codons) [54]. A similar analysis of the
Codon Adaptation Index [55] using codonW [56] on our
dataset agreed with Vicario et al.'s results (data not shown)
[38]. While it is not possible to rule out the hypothesis of
different mutation rates affecting genes expressed in different stages of ontogeny, the non-concordance between
the patterns observed in the synonymous and non-synonymous rates of substitution, dS and dN, indicates that differential mutation rate alone is insufficient to explain the
positive gradient of divergence in dN and dN/dS observed
over ontogeny. However, a gradient in these divergence
rates over development is predicted by both the developmental constraint and selection opportunity hypotheses
and thus evidence supporting either or both will be considered below.

Embryonic developmental constraint
Supporting the developmental constraint hypothesis, we
observed an increased mean number of interactions per
gene among genes showing their highest level of expression in the embryonic stage when compared to those specific to other stages (Table 2). This is consonant with the
notion that the products of genes expressed in this stage
are involved in a greater number of highly connected regulatory networks, and are thus constrained in their divergence due to the cascading effects of deleterious
mutations [15,16]. We observed that genes classified as
specific to the embryonic gonadal category were involved
in significantly more interactions than those specific to
the adult gonads, suggesting that lack of pleiotropy-mediated constraint may play some role in explaining the tolerance for evolutionary divergence of adult gonad specific
genes when compared to those of other tissues and stages.
This is particularly so in the case of the testis (Additional
file 11).

A potential caveat to such analysis could occur if the
majority of interaction studies in Drosophila were performed with the intention of identifying interactions in
the embryo, thus biasing the data in favor of a greater
number of embryo-specific gene interactors. However,
when we limited our analysis to interactions derived from
yeast two-hybrid experiments using gene predictions from
the whole Drosophila melanogaster genome [48,57], our
results remained qualitatively unchanged, suggesting that
our dataset is not significantly biased towards any specific
stage. It should be noted that the yeast two-hybrid technique is known to generate a large number of false positive predictions of protein-protein interactions (reviewed
in [58]). However, in order for such false positives to have
a significant effect in biasing our data, it would require
that the whole genome yeast two-hybrid studies from
which the interaction data are derived [48,57] preferentially produce false positives among genes expressed at
their highest level in the embryonic stage. A large number
of interactions in BioGRID's database are not derived
from yeast two-hybrid studies, and limiting our analysis
to these studies supports the results observed from the
analysis of the entire dataset (data not shown). However,
it is likely that interactions derived from these genetic
studies are biased towards experiments conducted during
embryogenesis, and thus such observations should be
interpreted with caution.
Noting that very early ontogenic processes such as gastrulation can show considerable divergence among closely
related species, Raff [5] suggested that developmental constraint may imperfectly reflect the sequence of organismal
ontogeny, but rather that the constraining effects of pleiotropy should be highest during those developmental
stages showing the least amount of modularity, or disas-

sociation, between regulatory pathways. It is possible that,
given the large scale morphogenesis that occurs during
both embryogenesis and metamorphosis in Drosophila,
more genes expressed during the embryonic and pupal
stages occur in highly interconnected regulatory networks
and thus are constrained by greater pleiotropy than those
specific to the larval and adult stages. However, our analysis of the mean number of interactions of genes classified
into the pooled larval and pupal stages found no significant difference when compared to genes classified into the
adult stage (Table 2, Additional file 13). While this may be
an effect of larval stage genes obscuring the signal of a
greater number of interactions in the metamorphosis
stage, this seems unlikely as under the strict predictions of
the developmental constraint hypothesis, larval genes
should be, on average, more conserved than those of the
subsequent metamorphosis stage and therefore possibly
involved in more interactions. Unfortunately, separate
larval-derived and pupal-derived EST libraries will be
required to answer such concerns. It should be noted that
Arbeitman et al. [29] observed that the transcriptomes of
the embryonic and pupal stages are more similar to one
another than either is to the larval or adult, suggesting that
many genes classified as embryonic specific may have
important functions in metamorphosis.
Selection opportunity and adult divergence
Unlike the developmental constraint hypothesis, which
predicts that the gradient in divergence rates observed
over ontogeny is produced by relaxed selective constraint
occurring on genes expressed in later stages, Darwin's
selection opportunity hypothesis argues that this gradient
is driven by positive selection [10]. Unfortunately, an
increase in dN and dN/dS over development, as we
observed, is consistent with both positive selection and
relaxed selective constraint. However, as part of the predictions of the selection opportunity hypothesis, we
should also observe an increase in the proportion of positively selected genes in later stages of development [43].
When examining the proportion of genes showing evidence of positive selection among our three developmental stages, the differences between stages were not
statistically significant (Additional file 9). It should be
noted however, that the number of genes in our dataset
showing significant evidence of positive selection was
quite small (359 out of 7,180 genes classified under no
specificity threshold) and may represent too limited a
dataset from which to draw statistically meaningful conclusions. While this may suggest that our results do not
support Darwin's hypothesis, it is interesting that our
study of both EST and microarray-based datasets noted
that the accelerated rate of evolution observed in the adult
stage is explained by the rapid evolution of male-biased
genes and, more specifically, those expressed in the testis
(Figure 2, Additional files 1 and 2). This result is consistent with previous morphological studies conducted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/42

within the D. melanogaster species complex that found
that sexual traits (for example, genital arch area, testes
length and area) show consistent, statistically significant
differences between species, whereas non-sexual traits (for
example, wing length and width, tibia and femur length,
and malpighian tubules length and area) do not [59].
Numerous studies have found that genes involved in sex
and reproduction diverge rapidly under the effect of positive selection [60-64] and, more specifically, that genes
with sex-biased expression show greater evidence of positive selection than non-sex biased genes [65,66]. Thus
there appears to be evidence that the accelerated evolution
observed in later stages of development is driven by
unique selective pressures such as sexual selection (but see
also [67,68] for examples of theory and empirical evidence suggesting relaxed selective constraint has a large
effect in explaining the rapid evolution of genes with sexlimited expression).
Darwin's hypothesis that selection opportunity increases
over the course of ontogeny also requires that the effects
of selective pressure should only be observed at the stage
in which the pressure occurs, and for which he presented
secondary sexual traits as an example [10]. While few
studies have analyzed the rate of evolution of embryonic
genes [23-25], numerous analyses have shown that adult
traits and genes involved in reproduction, particularly in
male reproductive organs, often evolve at accelerated evolutionary rates when compared to most other tissues
[12,36,41,60-65]. As expected, we observed that genes
expressed in the pooled gonads of the adult fly are evolving more rapidly than non-gonadal adult tissue (Figure
2a, Additional file 11). In the case of the pooled embryonic gonads, under all specificity thresholds where the differences were statistically significant, genes classified as
embryonic gonad specific are evolving less rapidly than
whole embryonic tissue. Thus the situation of accelerated
evolution of gonad specific genes in the adult is reversed
in the embryo, suggesting that the selective forces occurring in the adult reproductive stage are acting primarily on
genes expressed at that stage; or at least are not affecting
the embryonic stage.
Temporal pleiotropy and protein evolution
A negative correlation between breadth of gene expression
and protein divergence has been observed in taxa as distant as primates and flies [40-42] suggesting the existence
of a broadly applicable mechanism constraining the
divergence of genes expressed in multiple tissues. The
most plausible of such mechanisms is negative selection
against the deleterious pleiotropic effects engendered
from mutations occurring in highly connected genes
[49,50,69]. Our data suggest that such a model should be
extended to include temporal pleitotropy to the well supported spatial pleiotropy observed in previous studies. We
observed a clear pattern of increasing evolutionary diverPage 9 of 14

BMC Biology 2009, 7:42

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/42

gence (in both dN and dN/dS) with increasing stage specificity of representation (Figure 1, Additional file 7),
suggesting that genes expressed ubiquitously over the
course of development are subject to similar, pleiotropymediated evolutionary constraints as genes that are ubiquitously expressed across different tissue types [40-42].
Furthermore, our observation of a significant positive correlation between the number of stages at which genes
were represented and the average number of interactions
in which these genes are involved strongly suggests that
temporally ubiquitously expressed genes are involved in a
greater number of cellular and organismal functions than
their stage specific counterparts, and could thus be under
more restricted evolutionary divergence due to the large
effect of deleterious mutations at these loci.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we found support for both pleiotropy
mediated developmental constraints, as well as Darwin's
selection opportunity, having a significant impact on the
rates of divergence of genes over the course of ontogeny in
Drosophila. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive,
but rather may work in tandem, each primarily influencing different stages of development in order to explain the
ontogenic patterns observed among species. Therefore,
given our observations, we propose a 'constraint-early/
opportunity-late' model of evolutionary divergence over
ontogeny (Figure 3), such that the reduced divergence of
early-expressed embryonic genes is primarily explained by
strong purifying selection minimizing the deleterious
pleiotropic consequences of mutation. The accelerated
divergence of late-expressed adult genes is primarily
explained by unique selective pressures driving their
divergence at this stage. More data and the availability of
separate larval and pupal stage specific representation
information will be required in order to determine the relative contributions of constraint and selection in these
mid-ontogenic stages. Finally, our data imply that we
ignore a large amount of information about the evolutionary dynamics of gene divergence by studying spatial
gene expression at only a single stage. Any holistic
approach to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of
gene divergence will have to take into account temporal
pleiotropy in addition to spatial pleiotropy, and as such,
more temporal information about gene expression will be
required in order to generate a better understanding of
evolutionary divergence in which both constraint and
opportunity play a role.

Methods
Gene evolutionary rate estimates
All estimates of gene evolutionary rates were obtained
from the Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium Sequencing/Annotation Project [33] according to their PAML estimates [44] performed on six species of the D. melanogaster
group: D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, D. yakuba,

Constraint-early/selection-late model of developmental
Constraint-early/selection-late model of developmental divergence. Reduced divergence rates of embryonic genes relative to those of later stages are explained by
purifying selection against the deleterious pleiotropic effects
of mutation. Later stage genes are not simply 'less constrained', but experience unique selective pressures, such as
sexual selection, driving accelerated divergence.

D. erecta, and D. ananassae [42]. dN, dS, and dN/dS (ω in
PAML) as calculated under model 0 were used in this analysis. For the EST library-based developmental profile (see
below) the number of genes showing evidence of positive
selection at each stage and for each stage/tissue category
were obtained from the FDR corrected non-branch specific comparisons of models 7 and 8 in the Drosophila 12
Genomes Consortium dataset [33].
EST library-based developmental profile
We obtained information about the representation of all
7,180 genes in the Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium
[33] dataset that were found in all stage-specific D. melanogaster EST libraries in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) UniGene database (release
version 53) [35,70]. EST libraries separately representing
the larval and pupal stages were unavailable, therefore
libraries were pooled into one of three developmental
stage categories based on the stage from which they were
generated: embryonic, larval/pupal, and adult. Genes
were then classified into developmental stages based on
the stage in which they showed their highest proportion
of representation among sequenced ESTs (that is, the
number of sequenced ESTs from each gene divided by the
total number of ESTs sequenced in that stage's pooled
libraries). Genes were reclassified into developmental
stages using a series of arbitrarily chosen specificity thresholds, such that in order for a gene to be classified as specific to a stage, its highest proportion of representation
Page 10 of 14

BMC Biology 2009, 7:42

had to occur at that stage and also exceed the proportion
of representation at any other stage by a threshold of more
than twofold, fourfold, or eightfold. Genes were also classified into a 'unique' category if they were represented
only in libraries generated from a single stage, therefore
producing a series of five separate sets of genes assigned to
specific developmental stages (Table 1, Additional file 4).
EST libraries from the embryonic and adult stages were
separated into those derived specifically from the gonads
and those derived from whole embryos (including the
gonads) in the case of the embryo, and from all other tissues (not including the gonads) in the case of the adult.
Genes were then classified into embryonic general,
embryonic gonads, adult general, and adult gonads as
indicated above, using the same specificity thresholds. In
the case of the adult stage, testis-derived and ovaryderived libraries were either classified together as 'adult
gonads' or separated into 'adult testis' and 'adult ovary'
categories. For the purposes of this comparison, all genes
classified as larval/pupal-specific were ignored. The
number of genes classified into each category and proportion of representation threshold from the EST analysis is
shown in Table 1. In the comparison of adult and embryonic gonads and non-gonadal tissue, it is important to
note that the numbers of genes classified into each category varies based on whether the adult gonads are combined or separated, especially at lower specificity
thresholds, owing to the change in proportional representation introduced when the testis and ovary libraries are
pooled.
FatiGO validation of EST-based classification
We obtained NCBI 'CG' numbers for all stage classified
genes for which they were available (7,027 genes) using
the 'symbol: symbol synonyms' tag in Flybase's [71] batch
download feature. In the case where a Flybase gene (FBgn)
was associated with multiple CG numbers, the CG
number presented under the 'annotation symbol' heading
of that FBgn's 'gene report' page was used. The few duplicate CG numbers occurring due to multiple FBgns linking
to the same CG number were not removed. These duplicates most likely result from the splitting of what was originally a single gene into two when genome projects are
reannotated. The list of CG numbers classified as specific
to each stage were compared to one another using
FatiGO[36,37,72], searching for over-representation of
GO-biological processes in Drosophila melanogaster using a
two-tailed Fisher exact test without duplicate filtering.
Only significantly over-represented terms at GO levels 3
and 4 were collected.
Developmental profile of interactions
We collected protein and gene interaction data for the
4,422 genes from the EST dataset (Additional file 4) that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/42

were represented in the BioGRID database (release
2.0.36) [47,73]. The total number of interactions, irrespective of the experimental methodology used to obtain
them, that each gene was involved in was compiled and
used in the analysis. We also compiled a dataset limited
only to those interactions derived from yeast two-hybrid
experiments for the purpose of ascertaining potential artifacts generated by biased stage sampling of genetic interactions (see Results) (Additional file 12). Finally, we also
analyzed the dataset using only 'high-confidence' yeast
two-hybrid interactions as defined by Giot et al. [48] (that
is, those interactions with a confidence score greater than
0.5).
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical package [74]. Permuted Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests
and 95% confidence intervals were computed using
10,000 permutations of the data using the 'coin' and
'boot' packages, respectively. Pairwise comparisons of the
proportion of genes under positive selection were performed using χ2 tests. A Bonferroni correction for the
effect of multiple tests was applied to all pairwise comparisons.
