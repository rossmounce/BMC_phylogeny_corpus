Identification and characterization of repetitive
extragenic palindromes (REP)-associated tyrosine
transposases: implications for REP evolution and
dynamics in bacterial genomes
Jaroslav Nunvar*, Tereza Huckova, Irena Licha

Abstract
Background: Bacterial repetitive extragenic palindromes (REPs) compose a distinct group of genomic repeats. They
usually occur in high abundance (>100 copies/genome) and are often arranged in composite repetitive structures bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs). In BIMEs, regularly spaced REPs are present in alternating
orientations. BIMEs and REPs have been shown to serve as binding sites for several proteins and suggested to play
role in chromosome organization and transcription termination. Their origins are, at present, unknown.
Results: In this report, we describe a novel class of putative transposases related to IS200/IS605 transposase family
and we demonstrate that they are obligately associated with bacterial REPs. Open reading frames coding for these
REP-associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs) are always flanked by two REPs in inverted orientation and thus
constitute a unit reminiscent of typical transposable elements. Besides conserved residues involved in catalysis of
DNA cleavage, RAYTs carry characteristic structural motifs that are absent in typical IS200/IS605 transposases. DNA
sequences flanking rayt genes are in one third of examined cases arranged in modular BIMEs. RAYTs and their
flanking REPs apparently coevolve with each other. The rayt genes themselves are subject to rapid evolution,
substantially exceeding the substitution rate of neighboring genes. Strong correlation was found between the
presence of a particular rayt in a genome and the abundance of its cognate REPs.
Conclusions: In light of our findings, we propose that RAYTs are responsible for establishment of REPs and BIMEs
in bacterial genomes, as well as for their exceptional dynamics and species-specifity. Conversely, we suggest that
BIMEs are in fact a special type of nonautonomous transposable elements, mobilizable by RAYTs.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs), or transposons, are a large
group of mobile genetic elements with ability to actively
transfer themselves into new locations in their host´s
DNA. This process, called transposition, is catalyzed by
transposases, coded for by TEs themselves. Insertion
sequences (ISs) present the simplest examples of TEs.
The IS200/IS605 family of transposable elements was
first described in genus Salmonella [1] and further in
many other bacterial and archaeal genomes [2]. Contrary to the majority of TEs that transpose using

transposases whose active site is composed of a triad of
acidic residues (DDE transposases), known members of
the IS200/IS605 family lack terminal inverted repeats
and do not generate larger target site duplications upon
transposition [3]. Crystal structures of two IS200/IS605
transposases have been solved (PDB IDs: 2a6o and 2f4f)
[4,5]. Their fold is remarkably similar to proteins
involved in rolling circle (RC) replication - conjugative
plasmid relaxases and viral Rep proteins [4,5]. This similarity is further supported by shared mechanism of DNA
cleavage: transesterification reaction takes place between
DNA strand and conserved tyrosine residue, resulting in
covalent protein-DNA intermediate. A histidine-hydrophobic-histidine motif and a divalent metal (magnesium)
cation are another mandatory components of properly

assembled active site, aiding the nucleophilic attack of
catalytic tyrosine [6,7]. Next trait common for both
IS200/IS605 transposases and RC enzymes is that the
cleavage of DNA depends on the recognition of stemloop structures, present at either the origin of RC replication or IS termini [6,7]. IS200/IS605 transposases are
the smallest transposases known, with average length
below 150 amino acids. To encompass size limitation,
they work as a homodimer with two hybrid active sites,
each composed of tyrosine from first unit and the histidine-hydrophobic-histidine motif from second unit [4,5].
As determination of eukaryotic genomic sequences
progressed in the last two decades, it has become
obvious that their genetic information is littered with
highly repetitive, “junk” DNA. More detailed analyses of
these repetitive elements revealed that many of them are
actually special cases of TEs. They generally retain conserved terminal sequences (for example inverted repeats)
of their corresponding full-length transposons, which
are important for transposition initiation, but lack completely or partially the transposase gene. Therefore,
transposase encoded by “parental” full-length transposons needs to be supplied in trans. These repetitive elements are thus called nonautonomous TEs. Three
groups of nonautonomous TEs account for substantial
fractions of eukaryotic genomes. The first group is
represented by short interspersed nuclear elements
(Alu-like), derived from non-LTR-retrotransposons [8].
Helitrons, the second type of nonautonomous TEs, are
thought to be mobilized by Y-2 type transposases, that
are homologous to RC replication relaxases [9]. The last
type, miniature inverted repeat transposable elements
(MITEs), is present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Most studied MITEs are related to two homologous
insertion sequence families, IS630 (prokaryotic) and TcMariner (eukaryotic) [10], both employing DDE catalytic
mechanism. IS630-derived MITEs in prokaryotic genomes include Correia elements in Neisseria species [11]
and RUP elements in Streptococcus pneumoniae [12].
Besides these, MITEs related to other IS families have
been identified in prokaryotes [2].
Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences (REPs)
were originally identified in enteric bacteria [13] and
later in several other bacterial taxa [14-16] as a class of
abundant repeats with characteristic architecture. REP
elements contain imperfect palindrome in their
sequence. The majority of REPs are arranged in repeats
of higher order, bacterial interspersed mosaic elements
(BIMEs) [17]. In BIME-1, two oppositely orientated
REPs are located close to each other. The inter-REP
sequence interacts with integration host factor (IHF)
[18]. BIME-2 and atypical BIMEs are composed of several tandemly repeated BIME-1-like units [19] and have
been shown to strongly bind DNA gyrase [20]. REPs

themselves interact with DNA polymerase I [21] and
facilitate Rho-dependent transcription termination [22].
Our present results describe an intimate relationship
between REP and BIME elements and one apparently
monophyletic group of IS200/IS605 transposases.
Because of striking similarities to known nonautonomous TEs, we propose that BIMEs are in fact nonautonomous TEs and that IS200/IS605 transposases are
responsible for their mobilization.

Results
Case study - genus Stenotrophomonas

We have studied mechanisms of high-level tetracycline
resistance in bacteria from agricultural soil treated with
manure from tetracycline-fed animals. Among tetracycline-resistant isolates, identified as Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia, Variovorax paradoxus and Chryseobacterium balustinum, horizontal gene transfer from S. maltophilia to other two species was detected. The
transferred nucleotide sequence was 90% identical to a
histidine kinase/response regulator/sodium-symporter
family gene, present in both sequenced S. maltophilia
strains. We investigated the region surrounding this
gene in sequenced stenotrophomonads for the presence
of genes known to be involved in horizontal transfer of
genetic information. A putative transposase of the
IS200/IS605 family was found one gene away from histidine kinase in S. maltophilia R551-3. Analysis of
sequences flanking the transposase gene revealed
inverted repeats containing an imperfect palindrome.
More sequences identical to these inverted repeats were
observed scattered in several instances between neighboring genes (Figure 1A).
We performed a BLAST search that revealed five
apparent homologs of this transposase in genomes of
sequenced stenotrophomonads. Their genes were all
found to be delimited by inverted repeats of the same
architecture (Figure 1B). The 5-GT(A/G)G “head” is
immediately followed by perfectly complementary, GCrich palindrome, interrupted by 2-4 bases in its middle
(Table 1, bottom). Due to the presence of multiple
copies of these repeated sequences in the proximity of
the transposase gene (see above), we scanned whole Stenotrophomonas genomes for additional copies of repeats
flanking each particular transposase homolog. The number of hits ranged from 37 up to 427 perfect copies of
given repeat per genome (Table 1, bottom). Because of
their palindromic nature and abundance, features they
share with published REP sequences, they will be called
REPs and their cognate transposases will be called REPassociated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs).
We noticed that some of the REPs identified were
arranged in clusters. Ten clusters composed of REPs
were then analysed in detail (Figure 2). The core (basic

module) of each of these compound structures consists
at least of two inverted REPs, separated by two intervening segments. Several of these basic modules are connected to each other in a head-to-tail fashion. The
inter-REP segments do not show any homology with
each other and vary substantially in length, suggesting
that these clusters arose repeatedly and independently.
Because of their exceptional structural similarities with
published BIMEs, they will be called BIMEs.
Stenotrophomonas BIMEs show several interesting
aspects. Some of them are hybrid and contain REPs
from two different RAYTs. Moreover, slightly modified
REPs occur in BIMEs, differing only in a few nucleotide
positions. Still, in all cases, the palindromic features of
REPs are preserved, suggesting selection for complementary mutations. Intriguingly, one rayt gene (Smal4)
is directly associated with a BIME, its downstream REP
being one of the BIME-constituting REPs.
Since all six rayt genes are flanked by two inverted
REPs, this type of organization is likely to be subject to
evolutionary preservation. To estimate evolutionary relationship between these elements, phylogenetic trees
were constructed from RAYT amino acid sequences and
REP nucleotide sequences, respectively. Both phylograms
display the same topology (Figure 3), suggesting that
RAYTs coevolve with their cognate REPs and that their
typical organization is ancestral.
RAYTs in other bacteria

We wondered if similar RAYTs, REPs and BIMEs also
occur together in other bacterial taxa. Using Smal1
RAYT sequence as query, exhaustive BLAST search was

performed to identify RAYT homologs in other prokaryotic organisms. Retrieved homologs, all of which contained the “Pfam01797: Transposase_17” domain
(peculiar to IS200/IS605 transposases), were tested for
the presence of palindrome-containing inverted repeats
flanking their genes. Subsequently, the number of these
putative REPs in host genomes was determined. Only
RAYTs associated with abundant REPs were further
analysed. Detected RAYTs are listed in Table 1. RAYT
homologs suiting our criteria were only found in
gammaproteobacteria.
All detected REPs consist of GT(A/G)G head and GCrich imperfect palindrome with potential to form stemloop structures in single-stranded state (Table 1).
Importantly, in all cases when REP sequences were
determined in bacterial species taken into our analysis
prior to this work, REPs identified by our approach are
in agreement with these sequences. This concerns
Escherichia coli [19], Salmonella sp. [23], Pseudomonas
putida Pput2 [16] and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
Smal4 [24] REPs. For example, E. coli RAYT-coding
gene (yafM) is delimited by two different REPs (Table
1). These are in fact Y and Z2 palindromic units, constituents of modular BIMEs (BIME-2 and atypical BIMEs)
[25]. E. coli rayt itself is flanked by BIME-2 on both
sides. Similar direct association with BIME was observed
in total for one third of detected RAYTs (Table 1) in
various species.
Further, we examined distribution of identified REPs
in host genomes. Analysis revealed that most REPs are
arranged in clusters (Additional file 1). In some cases

coordinates. Each unique inter-REP sequence is assigned a different letter. Basic modules are bracketed, their numbers are denoted. REPs and
their orientation are marked with arrows: red - Smal4 REP, green - Smal3 REP, blue - S_sp2 REP. Asterisks indicate modified REPs. Large orange
arrow denotes gene coding for Smal4 RAYT.

(pseudomonads, Thioalkalivibrio sp.), the most predominant type of clusters is a doublet of REPs in inverted
orientation. These REP doublets, together with
embedded inter-REP sequences, might themselves represent compound repeated elements, analogous to E. coli
BIME-1. This is supported by structure of recently
described Pseudomonas fluorescens repeats [26]. The R0
family consists of 612 repeats (89 bp in length) that
have two inverted elements at their termini, identical
with Pflu1 REPs.

In contrast to the doublet arrangement, Xanthomonas
campestris REPs are in great majority found in large
clusters, consisting of regularly spaced REPs in alternating orientations (Additional file 1), typical features of
BIMEs. In remaining cases, solitary REPs are found
along with doublets and BIMEs.
Preliminary analysis confirmed that the great majority
of all identified REPs are extragenic (data not shown)
and thus further fulfill the definition of REP elements.

Figure 3 Coevolution of RAYTs and REPs. Unrooted phylograms,
constructed from (A) Stenotrophomonas RAYT amino acid
sequences and (B) Stenotrophomonas REP nucleotide sequences.

Evolution of RAYTs and REPs

Since REPs share several common structural features,
they are likely to represent a group of related elements.
We wondered if the same is true for RAYTs. Because
RAYTs were detected due to similarity of their protein
sequences (see above), they are thought to be structurally related. To specify this relationship, an alignment
of selected RAYTs together with reference set of “typical” IS200/IS605 transposases was constructed (Figure
4). The alignment reveals that all catalytically confirmed
residues - histidine-hydrophobic-histidine motif and
nucleophilic tyrosine - are conserved in both groups. It
is thus reasonable to conclude that RAYTs are capable
of cleaving DNA with formation of DNA-RAYT covalent intermediate. On the contrary, several motifs and
conserved residues are peculiar only to RAYTs. This is
in particular true for 100% conserved threonine near Nterminus and the NP(L/V)(R/K)xG motif that is located
close to C-terminus adjacently to nucleophilic tyrosine.
The presence of these unique structural features could
signify that RAYTs are monophyletic group of proteins.

Page 6 of 13

The question therefore arises as to whether the entire
RAYT clade has been evolving with their corresponding
REPs, as seen in Stenotrophomonas (Figure 3). Due to
rather high divergence of REPs, it is not possible to construct their accurate phylogram. However, REPs show
group-specific features that correlate well with phylogenetic grouping of their cognate RAYTs. For example,
enterobacterial RAYTs are clearly monophyletic (Additional file 2) and accordingly, their REPs are rather long,
substantially dimorphic and their palindrome is interrupted twice (Table 1). Furthermore, uniquely for REPs
of monophyletic Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas
RAYTs (Additional file 2), 5´-GA-3´ dinucleotide is
inserted between their GT(A/G)G head and palindromeforming part (Table 1). Together, these observations
support long-term coevolution of RAYTs and and their
cognate REPs.
Next, we examined chromosomal localization of rayt
genes. Among RAYTs listed in Table 1, three couples of
orthologous rayt genes (Pput1 and Pput2, Pput3 and
Pput4, Smal3 and S_sp2), located in the same genomic
context in different host species or strains, were identified (Figure 5). These orthologs have, due to the shared
synteny, unambiguously evolved from a common ancestor and allow us to trace back changes they have gone
through following divergence event. Although orthologous rayt genes do not change their genomic position,
their flanking REPs differ in up to three point mutations
(Table 1) and still retain palindromicity and inverted
repeat arrangement. Evidently, strong selective pressure
works for preservation of these REP traits, underlining
their functional importance. It is extremely improbable
that repeated changes in REP sequences flanking these
orthologs result merely from random fixation of successive random mutations.
Comparison of sequence identity between orthologous
rayt genes revealed an interesting phenomenon. In all
three cases, the degree of identity of the RAYT amino
acid sequences was significantly less than that of the
flanking genes (Figure 5), suggesting that RAYTs evolve
more faster than protein products of common genes.
Possible explanation for this accelerated evolution is
included in the Discussion section.
Relationship of RAYTs, REPs and BIMEs

We have shown so far that RAYTs and REPs are evolutionarily and physically connected. Since REPs are
known to be species (or strain)-specific and the same
applies to RAYTs (Table 1), it is possible that the presence of a particular RAYT itself in one bacterium
might be responsible for proliferation of corresponding
REPs.
Where genome sequences suitable for comparison
were available, strains differing by the presence or
absence of a particular rayt gene were tested for

prevalence of REPs in their genomes. In most cases, a
strong correlation between rayt presence and total number of its cognate REPs was found (Table 2), rayt-bearing strains containing on average ten times more REPs
in their genomes than strains devoid of rayt genes.
These results indeed suggest that presence of a given
RAYT is the direct cause of REP sequences proliferation
over host chromosome.
In search of support for this hypothesis, we found that
in three marine gammaproteobacteria and one betaproteobacterium (all possessing clear RAYT homologs), the
distribution of inverted palindromic repeats flanking
their rayt genes is not genome-wide (as in other REP
cases). Instead, REPs are accumulated proximally to particular rayt gene (Additional file 3). The REP-containing
regions span at most two hundreds of kilobases. In the
case of the marine gammaproteobacteria, the physical
association between rayt genes and REPs is very pronounced. Thauera sp. (a betaproteobacterium) is of special interest because it has obviously acquired its RAYT
by horizontal transfer from gammaproteobacteria. This
RAYT displays highest sequence similarity to Pseudomonas RAYTs (56% identical residues), has no counterpart
in other betaproteobacteria and its REP sequences are
also Pseudomonas-like (Table 1, Additional file 3). High
numbers of REPs are present in the Thauera genome.
More than a third are located proximally to rayt gene.
This suggests that, following acquisition of the rayt
gene, new REP copies have been preferentially produced
in its vicinity.
Physical association with rayt genes was already
shown for BIMEs (Table 1). Upon closer examination,
we detected four cases where 3´ end of rayt gene,
together with sequence between rayt stop codon and

downstream REP, is integrated into BIME, becoming a
part of BIME´s inter-REP segment (Additional file 4).
This unexpected observation proves that the mechanism
responsible for establishment of BIMEs is also directed
to rayt genes.

Discussion
We have characterized a novel class of transposases, closely related to IS200/IS605 family. What makes these
transposases (RAYTs) unique is the obligate delimitation
of their genes by two inverted palindromic sequences
(REPs), which are at the same time highly overrepresented in host genomes. We have shown that this type
of organization (REP-rayt-REP, Figure 1B) has been preserved during evolution and that both RAYTs and REPs
undergo long-term coevolution. Characteristic structural
elements in both RAYT and REP sequences suggest that
all detected RAYTs and REPs are descendants of a common ancestor. We propose that their origin dates to the
period after branching of the gammaproteobacteria,
since no homologs have been found in other major bacterial lineages.
The structure of a rayt gene flanked by two oppositely
orientated REPs is strikingly reminiscent of the organization of a typical bacterial insertion sequence. The
position of REPs as terminal sequences for RAYTencoding genes is supported by the fact that they are in
many cases located very close or even immediately
downstream of the rayt gene stop codon (Additional file
4), excluding additional terminal sequences. There are
other known transposase genes associated with REPs,
however, all of them are contained in bona fide ISs,
complete with their own terminal sequences [27-34].
These ISs use REPs as targets for their transposition.
We have not found typical signs of IS-like mobility for
RAYTs, i.e. presence of their multiple copies in host
genomes and changes of chromosomal location. This
might indicate that RAYTs have lost the ability to transpose their own genes. Still, there are at least two reasons
to assume that RAYTs recognize REPs and cleave DNA
strand in their proximity. By mere analogy, transposases
always bind and cleave sequences that flank their genes
during the course of transposition. This precise positioning of REPs by rayt genes is conserved. Moreover,
related IS200/IS605 transposases recognize stem-loop
structures [4,5] that can readily arise from imperfect
palindromes like those contained in REP sequences.
One of the most interesting outcomes of this study is
the previously unrecognized wide distribution of BIME
elements. BIMEs were detected in most of RAYT- and
REP-carrying species (Figure 2 and data not shown).
Apparently, there is a common mechanism of BIMEs
formation. The mechanism is targeted to rayt genes,
one third of which are directly associated with BIMEs

(Table 1). Furthermore, 3´ termini of rayt genes were
found captured between REPs in four rayt-adjacent
BIMEs (Additional file 4). BIMEs are known to exhibit
extensive interstrain differences in length and distribution [24,27] that seem unlikely to result solely from processes such as homologous recombination or DNA
polymerase strand-slippage. We hypothesize that the
putative RAYT-catalyzed reaction, as described further,
may pose the driving force behind BIME establishment
and dynamics.
In the simplest case, the information contained in a
REP sequence would be sufficient for its recognition
and cleavage by RAYT. Because of high level of conservation of the 5´ head sequences (Table 1), we hypothesize that they might serve as determinants of position of
cleavage site. Presumed REP-targeted RAYT activity
would then result, for example, in reversible formation
of a free hydroxyl group and covalent attachment of 5´

terminus of REP sequence to RAYT protein (Figure 6A).
Host genomes typically harbor hundreds of REPs and all
of them present potential substrates for RAYTs. The
RAYT activity can thus account for various imaginable
DNA rearrangements. There are two important aspects
of presumed RAYT catalysis. Firstly, the transiently present free hydroxyl group can serve as a primer for initiation of DNA replication. Secondly, in trans ligation
(reverse RAYT-catalyzed reaction) might occur relatively
frequently between two RAYTs that act on different
REPs. Because the assembly of catalytic site in related
IS200/IS605 transposases is achieved by dimerization
(due to their limited size), RAYTs probably form dimers
as well. The physical proximity of two subunits
enhances the frequency of in trans ligations.
We suggest that REP-dependent RAYT activity is
responsible for some of the unusual observations regarding REPs. For example, high number of REPs in host

genome is conditioned by presence of their cognate
RAYT (Table 2). Further, the substitution rate for rayt
genes was shown to greatly exceed the rate of substitutions in surrounding host genes (Figure 5). If RAYTs
cleave in adjacency of their flanking REPs, resulting OH
groups may prime DNA replication into rayt gene, leading to partial or complete replacement of one or both
strands. When several rounds of such replication are
performed during each cell cycle, excessive mutations
accumulate. Although this is a rather complicated theory, the alternatives, like strong positive selection for
mutated RAYTs, are equally uneasy to substantiate.
Another process we propose is RAYT-dependent is
the preferential formation of new REPs in vicinity of a
rayt gene (Additional file 3), following its horizontal
transfer into the host. In this case, acquired RAYT
obviously causes new REPs´ production, possibly
through multiplication of existing REPs flanking its
gene.
A possible model of BIME formation is depicted in
Figure 6B. Starting with one basic module of BIMEs
(two directly repeated REPs and one REP between them
in inverted orientation - Figure 2), RAYT dimer cleaves
at both top-strand REPs. Another RAYT dimer works
on bottom strand, due to presence of single REP, only
one unit of the dimer is attached to REP after cleavage.
Upon in trans ligation within the frame of “yellow”
dimer, circularized basic module and bottom strand
hold together by their complementary parts. The circle
is primed by the free OH group resulting from RAYT
cleavage of bottom strand. At this point, rolling circle
replication of basic module begins. The main replicative
DNA polymerase (Pol III holoenzyme in E. coli) might
accomplish the process on its own, since it was shown
to possess intrinsic moderate strand-displacement activity [35]. The amplified basic module (BIME) is cut off
from the rolling circle after the second unit of “blue”
RAYT dimer cleaves newly synthetized REP. Then, second in trans ligation within the frame of “blue” dimer
integrates BIME into the bottom strand. Following replication of chromosome and separation of daughter cells,
one of them contains a modular BIME in its genome.
Taken together, we have gathered considerable
amount of in silico evidence to propose significant role
of transposases in generation of bacterial intergenic
repeats. If our assumptions are true, then REPs and
BIMEs represent a novel class of nonautonomous TEs.
To confirm this, additional experiments are needed to
simulate interaction between RAYTs and REPs in vivo
and in vitro.

Conclusions
Our findings offer an alternative approach for rapid
identification of REPs in gammaproteobacterial genome

sequences. Putative RAYT homologs can easily be found
by a simple BLAST of conserved C-terminal part of any
of known RAYTs against particular genome sequence.
Invertedly positioned REPs can then be located flanking
the rayt gene. Known REPs proved to be a useful tool
for typing of intraspecific isolates, with high discriminatory power due to extensive REP dynamics [16,36]. REP
typing is, compared to other methods, very fast and
inexpensive, since it only requires one PCR, run from
REP-complementary primers against chromosomal DNA
template.
Upon determination of REP sequences, BIMEs can
readily be identified in host genomes. Since BIMEs exhibit exceptional length polymorphism, they have been
utilized as reliable markers for strain determination. As
in previous case, the procedure is advantageous because
of its quickness and simplicity [24,27].

Methods
Bacterial genome sequences were downloaded from
NCBI web site [37].
Direct and inverted repeats in rayt-flanking sequences
were looked up with OligoRep [38].
REPs position and total number determinations and
graphical plots were performed using pDRAW32 [39].
Multiple protein sequence alignments were constructed using MCOFFEE [40]. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed using Drawtree or Drawgram applications
from MOBYLE package [41]. Protein sequence trees
were constructed from template CLUSTALX tree files (.
ph) generated during MCOFFEE alignment. REP
sequence trees were constructed from CLUSTALX
guide tree files (.dnd) after being aligned with CLUSTALW [41].
