Origin and evolutionary plasticity of the gastric
caecum in sea urchins (Echinodermata:
Echinoidea)
Alexander Ziegler1*, Rich Mooi2, Gauthier Rolet3, Chantal De Ridder3

Abstract
Background: The digestive tract of many metazoan invertebrates is characterized by the presence of caeca or
diverticula that serve secretory and/or absorptive functions. With the development of various feeding habits,
distinctive digestive organs may be present in certain taxa. This also holds true for sea urchins (Echinodermata:
Echinoidea), in which a highly specialized gastric caecum can be found in members of a derived subgroup, the
Irregularia (cake urchins, sea biscuits, sand dollars, heart urchins, and related forms). As such a specialized caecum
has not been reported from “regular” sea urchin taxa, the aim of this study was to elucidate its evolutionary origin.
Results: Using morphological data derived from dissection, magnetic resonance imaging, and extensive literature
studies, we compare the digestive tract of 168 echinoid species belonging to 51 extant families. Based on a
number of characters such as topography, general morphology, mesenterial suspension, and integration into the
haemal system, we homologize the gastric caecum with the more or less pronounced dilation of the anterior
stomach that is observed in most “regular” sea urchin taxa. In the Irregularia, a gastric caecum can be found in all
taxa except in the Laganina and Scutellina. It is also undeveloped in certain spatangoid species.
Conclusions: According to our findings, the sea urchin gastric caecum most likely constitutes a synapomorphy of
the Euechinoidea. Its occurrence in “regular” euechinoids is linked to the presence of an additional festoon of the
anterior stomach in ambulacrum III. Both structures, the additional festoon and the gastric caecum, are absent in
the sister taxon to the Euechinoidea, the Cidaroida. Since the degree of specialization of the gastric caecum is
most pronounced in the predominantly sediment-burrowing irregular taxa, we hypothesize that its evolution is
closely linked to the development of more elaborate infaunal lifestyles. We provide a comprehensive study of the
origin and evolutionary plasticity of a conspicuous digestive tract structure, the gastric caecum, in a major taxon of
the extant invertebrate macrozoobenthos.

Background
With few exceptions, metazoans possess an alimentary
canal comprising a sac- or tube-like invagination of the
body wall. The evolution of an internalized intestinal
tract offered the possibility of digesting larger food particles [1]. The digestive system may form a simple or
ramified cavity with a single aperture (as in the Cnidaria
and the Platyhelminthes) or a tube with openings at its
two ends that constitute a distinct mouth and anus,
allowing the food to pass in one direction through a

tubular system [2]. Subsequently, this has led to the specialization of entire digestive tract regions. The invertebrate gut can be subdivided into three major parts: the
foregut (usually comprising mouth, pharynx, and esophagus), the midgut (crop, gizzard, and stomach), and
the hindgut (intestine, rectum, and anus) [3]. In most
taxa, the midgut serves as the primary site of digestion
as well as nutrient absorption and is therefore often
characterized by the presence of glands and caeca that
serve secretory or absorptive functions.
In the context of the general pattern described above
for typical bilaterian animals, it is important to note that
even secondarily radial forms such as echinoderms tend
to follow the same overall model of gut organization.

Among the Echinodermata - a taxon of marine invertebrate deuterostomes - sea urchins (Echinoidea) are considered one of the best studied groups and serve as
model organisms for a wide range of biological disciplines. The digestive tract of echinoids is usually subdivided into mouth, buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus,
stomach, intestine, rectum, and anus [4-6], with the
mouth forming the proximal and the anus the distal

segments. However, not all sea urchin taxa possess all of
these gut sections and some are characterized by the
presence of additional digestive tract structures such as
festoons, siphons, Gregory’s diverticulum, an intestinal
caecum, or a gastric caecum [7]. The gastric caecum is a
conspicuous organ that was first described by C.K. Hoffmann [8] in Spatangus purpureus, a species within the
derived Spatangoida (Figure 1A), a monophyletic taxon

of irregular sea urchins characterized by an infaunal lifestyle. Several spatangoid taxa have been shown to possess this large, non-contractile pouch that is connected
to the anterior stomach through a slit-like opening (Figure 1C). This pouch is also well-connected to the haemal system through numerous haemal ducts within its
connective tissue layer [9-12]. A number of hypotheses
regarding the function of this structure in spatangoids
have been presented. Some authors believed it to be a
glandular organ whose secretions leak into the stomach
[13], an absorptive structure [12,14], a site of microbial
fermentation [15,16], or simply an organ that acts generally in digestion [17,18].
In contrast, the digestive tract in “regular” sea urchins is not characterized by the presence of such a
highly specialized structure (the “regular” echinoids do
not form a monophyletic group, hence the quotes; in
contrast, the Irregularia is a recognized monophyletic
taxon [19]). However, several authors [5,9,14,20-24]
reported a more or less developed dilation at the proximal part of the anterior stomach in certain “regular”
sea urchin taxa (Figure 1B, D). According to most
authors, this dilation in “regular” sea urchins did not
display any functional specialization and was therefore
seen merely as a lateral outcrop of the stomach
[5,9,22,23]. R. Koehler - who had systematically studied
sea urchin internal anatomy - was presumably the first
and so far the only author to briefly mention the
potential homology of the dilation observed in “regular” sea urchins with the highly specialized gastric caecum found in the infaunal spatangoids and other
irregular taxa in which the caecum had been described
[9]. However, the precise evolutionary relationship
between these structures has not yet been systematically elucidated, largely because a comprehensive analysis encompassing all major sea urchin taxa was not

Page 3 of 32

possible due to the lack of data. In addition, the multitude of terms assigned by several authors to the
observed dilation of the sea urchin anterior stomach as
well as the gastric caecum in the Irregularia has greatly
complicated matters by obfuscating direct comparisons
among observed occurrences (Table 1).
In order to provide an example for the evolutionary
plasticity of invertebrate digestive tract structures, we
here describe the diversity observed in the morphology
of the sea urchin anterior stomach by investigating taxa
representing a wide diversity of forms within the Echinoidea. The aim of our study was (i) to catalogue the
diversity of the anterior stomach morphology observed
among sea urchins, (ii) to suggest a number of homology criteria that apply to the observed structures in all
sea urchin taxa included in our analysis, (iii) to elucidate
the evolutionary origin of the highly specialized gastric
caecum found in the derived Spatangoida, and (iv) to
evaluate implications for sea urchin phylogeny. Using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction in combination with dissection and an extensive literature survey, we were able to
incorporate 168 sea urchin species belonging to 51
extant families into our analysis (Figure 2). This comprehensive survey will serve as a basis for future studies
involving the ecology, histology, ultrastructure, and
function of digestive tract structures in a major taxon of
the invertebrate macrozoobenthos.

Results
The following descriptions give an overview of the anterior stomach found in 51 echinoid families (Figure 2).
We focus here on the general location of this part of
the digestive tract within members of each family as
well as the presence or absence of sub-structures. Intraand inter-specific variability exists for certain internal

techniques not used in this study have been shown to
be essential in determining presence or absence of the
primary siphon [28].
The topographic reference system for our descriptions
is based upon Lovén’s system [29] as depicted in Figure
1 A, B [ambulacra I-V (Amb I-V) and interambulacra 15 (IAmb 1-5)]. Furthermore, Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
denote whether the specimen is viewed aborally (AB),
laterally (LA), or orally (OR). Figure 9 provides an overview of the general sea urchin digestive tract morphology - the models presented in this figure are entirely
based on 3D MRI datasets [25,30]. Finally, Figure 10
provides three interactive 3D models of the digestive
tracts of selected taxa. In all figures within the present
article, except for a number of lateral views, Amb III is
always facing upwards. The images taken from the literature have in some cases been modified slightly
through removal of labels used by the original author(s).
All images were chosen based on the quality and plausibility in the manner in which digestive tract structures
in particular had been depicted.
Specimens were aligned according to Lovén’s system
by first locating the axial complex within the specimen.
The axial complex is a structure formed by various primary and secondary body cavities which is located in
IAmb 2 underneath the madreporic plate - see [31] for
a survey of this structure within the Echinoidea. Tables
2 and 3 provide information on all species analyzed
within this study, in particular on the method forming
the basis of the description (i.e. dissection, MRI, or literature references [32-70]).

structures in sea urchins [25]. Therefore, we only mention the relevant deviations from our general findings at
the family level. We regard the anterior stomach as
beginning immediately distal to the junction of esophagus and stomach in the vicinity of the branching-off
point of the primary siphon (some irregular taxa possess
a secondary siphon [5]). A certain degree of histological
specialization is known to exist in the anterior part of
the stomach in “regular” taxa [24,26,27]. The primary
siphon, although a derivative of the entire stomach
and therefore also present in the anterior stomach, is
not considered here, primarily because histological

The digestive tract of “regular” sea urchin species consists of two loops that lie more or less on top of each
other and usually bear so-called festoons, i.e. vertical
inflections of the gut (Figure 9A-K).
Histocidaridae

The anterior stomach of Histocidaris elegans, Histocidaris variabilis (Figure 3A), and Poriocidaris purpurata
is located in Amb III. The slightly curving esophagus is
initially directed towards Amb III. The anterior stomach
spans Amb III horizontally and is composed of a single
festoon. A small dilation extends adapically immediately
distal to the junction of esophagus and stomach.
Ctenocidaridae

The morphology of the anterior stomach in Ctenocidaris
nutrix and Notocidaris gaussensis closely resembles that
found in the Histocidaridae. The anterior stomach spans
Amb III horizontally close to its connection with the
esophagus, and is composed of a single festoon. A small
dilation extends adapically immediately distal to the
junction of esophagus and stomach.

10A), Eucidaris thouarsii, Eucidaris tribuloides, Goniocidaris parasol, Hesperocidaris panamensis, Phyllacanthus
parvispinus, and Stylocidaris affinis are characterized by
an anterior stomach that is located at the border of
Amb III and IAmb 3. The esophagus is initially directed
towards IAmb 3-Amb III and consists of a short,
straight tube. The anterior stomach consists of a single
festoon. A small dilation extends adapically just distal to
the junction of esophagus and stomach. In his detailed
description of the internal anatomy of Cidaris cidaris,
Prouho [33] specifically mentioned the absence of any
kind of caecum at the junction of esophagus and

stomach. Stereocidaris indica deviates from this general
description, with a situation that more closely resembles
that found in the Histocidaridae and the Ctenocidaridae.
Psychocidaridae

The anterior stomach of Psychocidaris ohshimai is
located at the border of IAmb 3 and Amb III. The esophagus is initially directed towards Amb III and consists
of a short, slightly curved tube. The anterior stomach
consists of a single festoon. A small dilation extends
adapically and towards IAmb 2 just distal to the junction of esophagus and stomach.
Phormosomatidae

A long esophagus that is initially directed towards Amb
I connects the pharynx to the anterior stomach in Phormosoma bursarium (Figure 3D) and Phormosoma

placenta. The anterior stomach spans Amb III and is
located between IAmb 3 and IAmb 2. It consists of two
separate festoons and a large lateral dilation within
IAmb 2. Unfortunately, Schurig [34] did not specifically
mention the morphology of the anterior stomach in his
detailed report on the internal anatomy of Phormosoma
bursarium and a number of other species of the
Echinothurioida.
Echinothuriidae

The digestive tract of the echinothuriid species analyzed
so far is characterized by a long esophagus which can
sometimes double back on itself. The esophagus in Sperosoma obscurum (Figure 3E) is initially directed towards
Amb II but connects with the anterior stomach in Amb

III after making almost a full turn. The anterior stomach
of this species consists of two large, separate festoons
and a large dilation in IAmb 2. The size of the dilation
can vary in echinothuriid species, being largest in Sperosoma obscurum and rather medium-sized in Tromikosoma hispidum (Figure 3F) and Tromikosoma tenue.
The anterior stomach of Asthenosoma ijimai (Figure
3G) differs in lacking the dilation as well as the additional festoon of the anterior stomach - however, a conspicuous structure, drawn as part of the intestine,
occupies the respective void in Amb III.
Pedinidae

The species of the genus Caenopedina that have been
analyzed so far possess an anterior stomach located

between IAmb 3 and Amb III. The winding esophagus
is initially directed towards Amb IV in Caenopedina
hawaiiensis (Figure 3H) and Caenopedina mirabilis
(Figure 3I). The anterior stomach consists of two horizontally fused festoons and a lateral dilation located in
Amb III.
Micropygidae

The anterior stomach of Micropyga tuberculata (Figures
3J, 9B) is located in Amb III, but also reaches laterally
into IAmb 2. The winding esophagus is initially directed
towards IAmb 5, but connects to the anterior stomach

in Amb III. The anterior stomach consists of two separate festoons and a lateral dilation located in IAmb 2.
This dilation extends considerably along the oral-aboral
axis of the species. Mortensen [38: 142] also noted that
“at the passage from the long oesophagus to the intestine there is a large blindsac” (Mortensen’s usage of
“intestine” = stomach in the present article).

located between IAmb 3 and IAmb 2. The winding esophagus is initially directed towards Amb IV before connecting to the anterior stomach in Amb III. The
anterior stomach consists of two separate festoons and a
conspicuous lateral dilation located in IAmb 2.
Diadematidae

Diadematids possess a complex anterior stomach that is
located between IAmb 2 and IAmb 3. The winding esophagus is initially directed towards Amb IV or V. The
anterior part of the stomach in Astropyga radiata (Figure 4A), Diadema antillarum, Diadema savignyi (Figure
9C, interactive Figure 10B), Diadema setosum, Echinothrix calamaris (Figure 4B), and Echinothrix diadema
(Figure 4C) consists of two separate festoons and a
well-developed dilation. This dilation seems to be less
developed in Centrostephanus longispinus and Centrostephanus rodgersii. However, in Chaetodiadema pallidum
(Figure 4D), the anterior stomach is characterized by a
single festoon only which is located in IAmb 3. Both the
additional festoon and the dilation are absent from this
species. According to Lewis [24: 552], the digestive tract
of Diadema antillarum consisted “of five sections: esophagus, caecum, foregut, hindgut, and rectum” and “The
caecum is a large blind sac. It is continuous with the

first loop of the foregut but can be distinguished from
the latter by its brighter colour”. Lewis also mentioned
the presence of “a valve at the junction of caecum and
foregut”. The above-mentioned dilation can be seen in a
recent picture of Diadema setosum (Figure 1A in 28:
note the adaxial part of the crenulated structure at the
right hand side of the junction of esophagus (es) and
stomach (st)). In some diadematid species, particularly
in Astropyga, Diadema, and Echinothrix, a fusion of
both “ends” of the lower gut loop through mesenteries
can be observed at the border of Amb III and IAmb 2
(Figure 4A).
Glyptocidaridae

The only extant species in this family, Glyptocidaris crenularis (Figure 4E), is characterized by the presence of
an anterior stomach that is located in Amb III. The
winding esophagus is initially directed towards Amb IV.
The anterior stomach consists of two separate festoons
and a large dilation that extends slightly into IAmb 2.
Stomopneustidae

The digestive tract of Stomopneustes variolaris (Figures
4F, 9D) is very similar to that found in Glyptocidaris
crenularis. The anterior stomach consists of two separate festoons. The esophagus displays some degree of

at the border of Amb III and IAmb 2.
Arbaciidae

The arbaciid species analyzed so far, Arbacia dufresnii,
Arbacia lixula (Figures 4G, 9E), Arbacia punctulata,
and Coelopleurus floridanus (Figure 4H), possess an
anterior stomach that is located in Amb III. The esophagus is initially directed towards Amb III, but later
undulates towards IAmb 2 proximal to its junction with
the stomach in Amb III. Due to the horizontally more

depressed aspect of the entire arbaciid gut, differentiation of separate festoons and dilations is difficult. However, slight undulations of mesenteries indicate the
presence of two horizontally fused festoons in Amb III
as well as a small dilation extending into IAmb 2.
Saleniidae

Similar to that in arbaciid species, the saleniid gut does
not exhibit pronounced vertical festooning. In Salenocidaris miliaris (Figure 4I), Salenia goesiana (Figure 4J),
Salenocidaris hastigera (Figure 9F), and Salenia pattersoni (Figure 4K), the short esophagus is initially directed

analyses indicate that in all species the slightly winding esophagus is initially directed towards Amb III.
The anterior stomach is characterized by the presence
of two horizontally fused festoons located in Amb III.

albida spans the entire Amb III, also reaching into
IAmb 2, the anterior stomach in Genocidaris maculata
is located mainly in IAmb 3 and only slightly extends
into Amb III. However, both species are characterized
by a small dilation of the anterior stomach pointing adapically distal to the junction of esophagus and stomach.
Due to the flattened aspect of the entire stomach it is
hard to differentiate individual festoons, but slight undulations of mesenteries indicate the presence of two horizontally fused festoons in Amb III.
Parasaleniidae

All known species in this monogeneric family are characterized by an oval test. In Parasalenia gratiosa, the
only species analyzed here, the anterior stomach is largely located in Amb III, but reaches into IAmb 2 and 3
as well. The winding esophagus is initially directed
towards IAmb 3, but distally bends towards Amb III
where it enters the stomach. The anterior stomach consists of two separate festoons as well as a large dilation
located at the border of Amb III and IAmb 2. This dilation extends towards the apex.
Parechinidae

In specimens of Loxechinus albus, Paracentrotus lividus
(Figures 1B, D; 5A, B), Parechinus angulosus, Psammechinus microtuberculatus, and Psammechinus miliaris
(Figures 5C, D; 9I), the anterior stomach is located in

Amb III. The short esophagus is initially directed
towards Amb III where it also connects to the anterior
stomach. The two individual festoons in Amb III are
horizontally fused. A small dilation is located just distal
to the junction of esophagus and anterior stomach. Several authors have noted this dilation in Paracentrotus
lividus, among them Koehler [9], Tiedemann [20],
Valentin [21], and Bonnet [22].
Echinidae

Data on the anterior stomach of echinids are available
for eight species: Echinus esculentus (Figure 5E), Echinus
melo, Gracilechinus acutus (Figure 5F), Gracilechinus
alexandri, Polyechinus agulhensis, Sterechinus agassizi,
Sterechinus antarcticus, and Sterechinus neumayeri. In
all species, the anterior stomach is largely located in
Amb III, but also extends slightly into IAmb 2. The
moderately winding esophagus is initially directed
towards Amb III, where it also connects to the anterior
stomach. This part of the digestive tract is characterized
by the presence of two horizontally fused festoons as
well as a small dilation that reaches into IAmb 2.
According to Koehler [9], this dilation distal to the junction of the esophagus with the anterior stomach is more
developed in Echinus melo than in Echinus esculentus.
Echinometridae

This taxon incorporates species with either an oval or
circular test. The anterior stomach in Caenocentrotus
gibbosus, Echinometra lucunter, Echinometra mathaei
(Figures 5G, 9J), Echinometra viridis, Echinostrephus
molaris, Evechinus chloroticus (Figure 5H), Heliocidaris
crassispina, Heliocidaris erythrogramma, and Heterocentrotus mammillatus is largely located in Amb III, but

specimens where applicable, and the respective references. Numbers in brackets behind “MRI” represent the resolution of the dataset. An overview of scanning

extends into IAmb 2 and 3 as well. The winding esophagus is initially directed towards the apex before descending towards IAmb 3; it joins the anterior stomach in
Amb III. The anterior stomach is characterized by the
presence of two separate festoons and a large, adapically
oriented dilation located near IAmb 2. McRae [23: 238]
described the internal anatomy of Evechinus chloroticus
and noted that the anterior stomach is characterized by
the presence of a “sac-like dilatation” that is connected
to esophagus and axial complex “through sheets of
mesentery”.
Strongylocentrotidae

The anterior stomach of Pseudocentrotus depressus,
Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Figure 5I), and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Figures 5J; 9K) is located in
Amb III. The moderately winding esophagus is initially
directed towards the apex before descending towards
IAmb 3; it later connects to the anterior stomach in
Amb III. The two individual festoons in Amb III are
horizontally fused for parts of their length. A small dilation occurs immediately distal to the connection of esophagus and stomach. This dilation is directed adapically
and extends into IAmb 2.
Toxopneustidae

The species that so far have been analyzed in this taxon
all possess a prominent anterior stomach located in
Amb III. In Gymnechinus robillardi, Lytechinus variegatus, Nudechinus scotiopremnus, Sphaerechinus granularis
(Figure 5K, L), Toxopneustes pileolus, Tripneustes esculentus, Tripneustes gratilla, and Tripneustes ventricosus,
the two individual festoons of the anterior stomach are
moderately fused and located in Amb III. The winding,
short esophagus is initially directed towards the apex
before descending towards IAmb 3; it later connects to
the anterior stomach in Amb III. A variably sized

dilation of the anterior stomach, largely located in IAmb
2, is oriented adapically. The esophagus in Tripneustes
spp. doubles back on itself [49].
Irregularia

Irregular sea urchins can be distinguished from “regular”
species by the absence of festoons in their entire digestive tract (Figure 9L-T).
Echinoneidae

The anterior stomach of Echinoneus cyclostomus (Figures 6A, 9L, interactive Figure 10C) is located in Amb
III and also extends into IAmb 3. The short esophagus
ascends from the mouth towards Amb III where it joins
the anterior stomach. A large pouch is located in Amb
III distal to the junction of esophagus and anterior stomach. The pouch is connected to the anterior stomach
through a small opening in the middle of the lower rim
of the pouch. In lateral view, the pouch is triangular,
with one apex towards the echinoid’s anterior edge. The
aboral edge of the pouch closely follows the arched
form of the test in Amb III. This pouch extends from
the anterior part of the stomach in Amb III, close to the
ampullae of the tube feet, until it reaches the axial complex located in the central oral-aboral axis. The surface
of the pouch is covered with numerous small folds. The
pouch is broader at its adoral edge than towards the
apex.
Apatopygidae

The anterior stomach of Apatoypgus recens (Figure 6B)
is located in Amb III. The short esophagus ascends
from the mouth towards Amb III where it joins the
anterior stomach. The apical side of the anterior stomach is characterized by the presence of a large pouch
that extends obliquely within Amb III from the anterior
part close to the test, until it reaches the axial complex

for an explanation of abbreviations.

that bulges anteriorly. The pouch is connected to the
anterior stomach through a broad canal located at the
anterior end of its adoral edge. The general form of the
pouch is triangular, the anterior point being located in
Amb III. The surface of the pouch is characterized by
numerous folds running along the oral-aboral axis. The
aboral edge of the pouch closely follows the arched
form of the test in Amb III.
Cassidulidae

In Cassidulus caribaearum (Figure 9M) and Rhyncholampas pacificus (Figure 6C), the anterior stomach is

located in Amb III and IAmb 3. The short esophagus
ascends from the mouth towards Amb III until it joins
the anterior stomach. At the junction of esophagus and
anterior stomach, a cluster of small, smooth, finger-like
pouches can be found. These pouches are directed
towards the apex of Amb III and split into two smaller
clusters, one directed laterally towards IAmb 2, the
other oriented towards IAmb 3. The number of pouches
in an adult specimen of Cassidulus caribaearum was
found to be approximately four to six on each side. The
apical side of the entire structure is in close proximity

Ziegler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/313

to the apical part of the test of Amb III. Agassiz [13]
and Gladfelter [70] provided similar descriptions of this
cluster of pouches located at the apex of the anterior
stomach.
Echinolampadidae

The anterior stomach of Echinolampas depressa (Figure
9N) is primarily located in IAmb 3, but reaches into
Amb III as well. A short esophagus ascends from the
mouth towards Amb III where it joins the anterior stomach. At the apical part of the anterior stomach, a cluster of small, smooth, pointed pouches are located. As in
Cassidulus, these pouches are directed towards the apex
of Amb III and later divide to form two smaller clusters
that are directed laterally, one towards IAmb 2, the
other towards IAmb 3. The pouches are wedged
between the upper coil of the digestive tract and are not
in close proximity to the apical part of the test in Amb
III. The number of pouches in an adult specimen of
Echinolampas depressa was found to be approximately
eight to twelve on each side.
Neolampadidae

The digestive tract of the single specimen of Neolampas
rostellata (Figure 6D) that could be analyzed in the
course of this study is characterized by the presence of
the anterior stomach in Amb III. The short esophagus
ascends from the mouth towards the anterior stomach,
joining it in Amb III. A considerable dilation or pouch
can be found branching off the anterior stomach
towards IAmb 2. On the apical side of this structure,
another knob-like dilation or pouch can be found. Its
surface consists of several smooth, finger-like folds that
adhere to each other.
Clypeasteridae

The anterior stomach of all species within the genus
Clypeaster that have been analyzed so far is located in
Amb III and IAmb 3. The short esophagus, originating
from the top of Aristotle’s lantern, is directed towards
Amb III where it joins the anterior stomach. Distal to
this junction, a grape-like cluster of pouches is present
both in juvenile specimens of Clypeaster europacificus
and adult specimens of Clypeaster annandalei, Clypeaster destinatus (Figure 6E) (Mortensen 71 regards the
former two species as synonymous), Clypeaster humilis,
Clypeaster rarispinus (Figure 6F), Clypeaster reticulatus
(Figure 9O), and Clypeaster rosaceus. This cluster
extends along the anterior stomach towards the anterior
part of the animal in Amb III, and consists of dozens of
smooth, grape-like nodules. Koehler [51: 27] described
this structure as a “glande intestinale”.
Arachnoididae

The anterior stomach in Arachnoides placenta (Figure
6G, H) is located in Amb III and reaches into Amb 2. A
short esophagus connects the pharynx with the anterior
stomach in Amb III. Between the central oral-aboral

Page 20 of 32

axis and the anterior tip of the test in Amb III, a cluster
of pouches shaped like bunches of grapes extends laterally from the anterior stomach into IAmb 2. This cluster
is present both in juvenile (Figure 6G) and adult specimens (Figure 6H), although its relative size seems to
increase with age. The surface of each of the numerous
individual pouches is smooth; some are more elongated
than others. In adult specimens (ca. 10 cm test diameter), the entire cluster may attain a length of approximately 2 cm. Koehler [51: 27] described this structure as
a “glande intestinale”.
Laganidae

The anterior stomach in Laganum bonani, Laganum
decagonale, Laganum depressum, Laganum joubini,
Laganum laganum (Figures 7A, 9P), as well as in Peronella lesueuri and Peronella orbicularis (Figure 7B) is
located in Amb III and IAmb 2, in some species extending well into Amb II. A short and broad esophagus
reaches from the surface of Aristotle’s lantern towards
the anterior stomach in IAmb 2. The antero-lateral edge
of the anterior stomach is slightly lobate in some species, particularly so in Laganum laganum. No particular
dilation or pouch of the anterior stomach was observed
in members of this taxon. Mortensen [71: 246] stated
that in the Laganidae “...the intestinal gland appears to
be lacking completely, in contradistinction to the Clypeastrids proper and Arachnoides.”
Fibulariidae

The digestive tract of Echinocyamus pusillus (Figure 7C)
is characterized by the presence of the anterior stomach
at the border of Amb II and IAmb 2. The antero-lateral
edge of the anterior stomach is smooth. The short esophagus connects the pharynx from the apical surface of
Aristotle’s lantern to the anterior stomach in IAmb 2.
Dilations or pouches are absent from the anterior
stomach.
Rotulidae

The anterior stomach of Rotula deciesdigitata (Figure
9Q) is located between Amb II and Amb III. A short
esophagus spans from the surface of Aristotle’s lantern
towards the anterior stomach located in IAmb 2. The
antero-lateral edge of the anterior stomach is smooth.
Koehler [53] described the anterior stomach of Rotula
deciesdigitata as considerably enlarged in comparison to
the rest of the stomach. No dilations or pouches could
be observed in the anterior stomach. Recent analysis of
the subgenus Fibulariella (sensu Mortensen [71]) indicates that it is most closely related to the rotulids, not
the fibulariids [72]. Accordingly, we report here that in
Fibulariella acuta (Figure 7D), the configuration of the
anterior stomach is similar to that in Rotula.
Echinarachniidae

The anterior stomach in Echinarachnius parma (Figures
7E, F; 9R) is located between Amb II and III. A short,

Ziegler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/313

Page 21 of 32

broad esophagus connects the pharynx with the anterior
stomach in IAmb 2. The abaxial edge of most parts of
the stomach is characterized by the presence of a conspicuously frilled zone (Figure 7F) that can reach from
IAmb 2 as far as IAmb 4. No particular dilation or
pouch of the anterior stomach was observed.

stretched from Amb III towards IAmb 1. This in turn
creates a digestive tract area not present in non-atelostomate taxa. Histological and ultrastructural data support this view, but such data are patchy and currently
available only for a limited number of taxa [4,8,9,12,69].

Dendrasteridae

The anterior stomach in Corystus relictus (Figure 8A)
extends from IAmb 1 until about IAmb 3. A large
pouch is located on top part of the anterior stomach
and extends clockwise from IAmb 3 until IAmb 5. Its
connection with the anterior stomach is located in
IAmb 3. The surface of the pouch is smooth.

Data on the internal anatomy of dendrasterid sand dollars are available for Scaphechinus griseus, Scaphechinus
mirabilis, Scaphechinus tenuis (Figure 7G), Dendraster
excentricus (Figure 7H), and Sinaechinocyamus mai (Figure 7I). The anterior stomach is located between IAmb
2 and Amb III. A short, broad esophagus connects the
pharynx with the anterior stomach at the border of
Amb III and IAmb 2. Dilations or pouches of the anterior stomach could not be found. According to Reisman
[55: 8], the stomach of Dendraster excentricus “is differentiated into a narrow, brown, fluted outer region and a
wide mustard-yellow less fluted inner region.”
Astriclypeidae

The digestive tract in Astriclypeus manni and Echinodiscus auritus (Figure 7J) is characterized by the presence
of an anterior stomach located in IAmb 2 and Amb III.
The short esophagus connects the pharynx with the
anterior stomach in Amb III. The abaxial edge of most
parts of the stomach consists of a smooth to frilled area
that reaches from Amb III as far as Amb V. No particular dilation or pouch was observed in members of this
taxon.
Mellitidae

The anterior stomach in Encope stokesii (Figure 7K),
Leodia sexiesperforata, and Mellita quinquiesperforata
(Figure 7L) is located in IAmb 2 and Amb III. A short
esophagus connects pharynx with anterior stomach at
the border of IAmb 2 and Amb III. The abaxial edge of
parts of the stomach is characterized by the presence of
a conspicuously frilled zone (Figure 7L) that may reach
from IAmb 2 as far as Amb IV. The anterior stomach is
devoid of any dilations or pouches.

Corystidae

Urechinidae

The anterior stomach in Antrechinus nordenskjoldi (Figure 8B) and Urechinus naresianus (Figure 8C, D)
extends from IAmb 1 until about IAmb 3. A large
pouch is located on top of the first part of the anterior
stomach, extending from its connection to the former in
Amb III clockwise towards IAmb 1. The surface of the
pouch may be smooth (Figure 8B) or slightly lobate
(Figure 8C). Mortensen [62: 42] states, that a “well
developed diverticulum” is present in Urechinus
naresianus.
Plexechinidae

The anterior stomach of Plexechinus aoteanus is characterized by the presence of a large pouch that connects
to the underlying anterior stomach in Amb III.
Pourtalesiidae

The digestive tract of Pourtalesia jeffreysi (Figure 8E),
Pourtalesia hispida (Figure 8F), and Pourtalesia wandeli
(Figure 9S) is characterized by an anterior stomach that
stretches between IAmb 1 and IAmb3. A large pouch is
located on top of the first part of the anterior stomach,
pointing from its connection to the former in Amb III
straight towards IAmb 5. The apical surface of the
pouch is smooth, whereas its sides as well as the adoral
surface are lobate. According to Mortensen [62: 62],
“the blind diverticulum is well developed, lobate” in the
Pourtalesiidae.
Aeropsidae

Atelostomata

Members of the following families all belong to a monophyletic taxon, the Atelostomata. All are characterized
by the absence of Aristotle’s lantern during all ontogenetic stages. Furthermore, the esophagus is directed
towards the posterior part of the animal, i.e. IAmb 5,
where it curves counter-clockwise until about IAmb 1,
the branching-off point of the large primary siphon.
Whether the subsequent part of the digestive tract from
IAmb 1 to Amb III is derived from the esophagus or
the stomach is currently a matter of debate. In the present study, we assume that the point at which the primary siphon branches off marks the end of the
esophagus, implying that the anterior stomach has

The anterior stomach of Aeropsis fulva (Figure 8G)
stretches approximately from IAmb 1 to IAmb 3. The
esophagus is thin and joins the stomach presumably in
IAmb 1. No particular dilation or pouch was observed
in the vicinity of the anterior stomach. Although Agassiz
[36] depicted a lateral view of the internal anatomy of
Aeropsis rostrata, he unfortunately did not specifically
mention the absence or presence of a pouch in the
respective area of the digestive tract.
Hemiasteridae

The anterior stomach in Hemiaster expergitus (Figure
8H) is located between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3. A large
pouch is located on top of the first part of the anterior
stomach, pointing from its connection to the former in

Ziegler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/313

Amb III straight towards IAmb 5. The apical surface of
the pouch is smooth, whereas its sides as well as the
adoral surface are lobate. Koehler [63] mentions a long
and only very slightly lobate pouch to be present at the
same location in Hemiaster hickmanni.
Palaeopneustidae

In his account on various spatangoid species, Chesher
[64] described the internal anatomy of Spatangus purpureus (see Spatangidae below), also mentioning the
presence of a large pouch on top of the anterior stomach. For Paleopneustes cristatus and Paleopneustes
tholoformis he noted that their internal anatomy largely
resembled that of Spatangus purpureus, implying that
there is a pouch present on top of the anterior stomach
in these two palaeopneustid species as well.
Prenasteridae

Similar to his observations on palaeoneustid species,
Chesher [64] noted that the internal anatomy of Prenaster enodatus largely resembled that of Spatangus purpureus, implying that there is a pouch present on top of
the anterior stomach in this species as well.
Schizasteridae

The anterior stomach in Schizaster canaliferus, Abatus
cavernosus (Figure 9T), Abatus cordatus, Brisaster antarcticus, Brisaster fragilis, and Brisaster latifrons (Figure
8I) is located between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3. A large
pouch is located on top of the first part of the anterior
stomach, pointing from its connection to the former in
Amb III straight towards IAmb 5. The apical surface of
the pouch is smooth, whereas its sides as well as the
adoral surface are lobate. However, Koehler [9]
described the pouch in Schizaster canaliferus as having
simple, flat, and smooth walls. Later [63], he described
the internal anatomy of other schizasterids and noted
that the digestive tract in Hypselaster kempi is similar to
the digestive tract in Hemiaster hickmanni, including
the presence of a large pouch on top of the anterior stomach. On the other hand, Koehler [63] mentioned that
there is no gastric caecum (= pouch in this description)
in Aceste ovata.
Brissidae

The anterior stomach in Brissus agassizii, Brissus unicolor and Meoma ventricosa (Figure 8J, K) is located
between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3. A large pouch is located
on top of the first part of the anterior stomach, pointing
from its connection to the former in IAmb 3 towards
IAmb 5 in an oblique manner. The apical surface of the
pouch is smooth, whereas its sides as well as the aboral
surface are lobate. According to Chesher [67,: 99], the
pouch is a “highly vascularized, thin, convoluted sac
which occupies a major portion of the coelom between
intestine and the gonads. Sand does not enter the caecum.” Agassiz [13: 677] gave a differing description of
the anterior stomach in another brissid, Metalia

Page 22 of 32

sternalis: “...at the junction of the esophagus with the
alimentary canal proper is found a cluster of small
diverticula resembling those of Rhynchopygus, and not a
single large diverticulum as in Spatangus proper.”
(Rhynchopygus = Rhyncholampas in the present article,
see Cassidulidae).
Brissopsidae

The anterior stomach in Brissopsis lyrifera (Figure 8L) is
located between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3. A large pouch is
located on top of the first part of the anterior stomach,
pointing from its connection to the former in IAmb 3
towards IAmb 5 in an oblique form. The apical surface
of the pouch is smooth, whereas its sides as well as the
adoral surface are lobate. According to Chesher [64],
the following taxa closely resemble Brissopsis lyrifera
with regard to internal anatomy, implying the presence
of a pouch on top of the anterior stomach: Brissopsis
alta, Brissopsis atlantica, Brissopsis elongata, and Brissopsis mediterranea.
Loveniidae

The anterior stomach in Echinocardium cordatum (Figure 8M) is located between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3. A
large pouch is located on top of the first part of the
anterior stomach, pointing from its connection to the
former in IAmb 3 towards IAmb 5 in an oblique form.
The apical surface of the pouch is smooth, whereas its
sides as well as the adoral surface are lobate. According
to De Ridder & Jangoux [12: 338], the anterior stomach
of Echinocardium cordatum is characterized by the presence of “a large, translucent, turgid (fluid-filled), and
non-contractile triangular pouch”. Their analyses reveal
that “no muscular sphincter is associated with the caecal
opening, but a small prominence of dense connective
tissue occurs at the level of the caecal slit. This prominence locally brings both faces of the caecal slit closer
to each other, the opening never being tightly closed”.
Koehler [9] briefly described the internal anatomy of
Echinocardium cordatum as well as Echinocardium flavescens and noted the presence of a large pouch with
flat, simple, and smooth walls. Furthermore, Holland &
Ghiselin [4] mentioned the presence of a large pouch
atop the anterior stomach in Lovenia subcarinata.
Spatangidae

The anterior stomach in Spatangus purpureus (Figures
1A, C; 8 N, O) is located between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3.
A large pouch is located on top of the first part of the
anterior stomach, pointing from its connection to the
former in IAmb 3 towards IAmb 5 in an oblique form.
The apical surface of the pouch is smooth, whereas its
sides as well as the adoral surface are lobate. Several
authors described the pouch on top of the anterior stomach in Spatangus purpureus [8,9,13,14,17,18]. For
example, Agassiz [13: 677] described the pouch as a “...
huge diverticulum, trending upwards and towards the

Ziegler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/313

posterior extremity...”, while Koehler [9] noted that the
connection between the anterior stomach and the pouch
appeared as a narrow elliptical orifice. He also mentioned the presence of numerous transverse folds in the
walls of the pouch. Finally, Henry [17: 1318] stated that
“...l’intestin du Spatangus est absolument bourré de
sable et de coquilles fines, le caecum, au contraire, ne
contient pas un grain de sable...”. Data on the internal
morphology of spatangids are available for two additional species, Plethotaenia angularis and Plethotaenia
spatangoides: according to Chesher [64], their digestive
tract anatomy closely resembles that of Spatangus purpureus, indicating the presence of a large pouch. MRI
data reveal the presence of a smaller pouch atop the
anterior stomach in Pseudomaretia alta. In this species,
the pouch is connected to the exterior part of the anterior stomach in IAmb 3 and extends in an oblique form
towards Amb II.
Maretiidae

Holland & Ghiselin [4] described the presence of a large
pouch on top of the anterior stomach in Maretia
planulata.
Asterostomatidae

The anterior stomach in Heterobrissus niasicus (Figure
8P) is located between IAmb 1 and IAmb 3. A large
pouch is located atop the first part of the anterior stomach, pointing from its connection to the former in
IAmb 3 towards IAmb 5 in an oblique form. The apical
surface of the pouch is smooth, whereas its sides as well
as the adoral surface are lobate. Wagner [69: 35]
described the pouch in Heterobrissus niasicus in detail
and noted that “...das (erste) Divertikel ist ein breiter
Blindsack, der an der Außenseite der unteren Darmwindung im Radius III entspringt...” and “...es ist von unten
nach oben abgeplattet, und seine Oberfläche ist von
zahlreichen Falten bedeckt...”. Koehler [63] briefly mentioned the internal organization of Heterobrissus hemingi
and stated - based on Wagner’s detailed description that it is very similar to that in Heterobrissus niasicus.
He furthermore noted the presence of a long, slim
pouch on top of the anterior stomach in Elipneustes
denudatus, whose general internal anatomy also closely
resembled that of Heterobrissus niasicus.

Discussion
Our conclusions are possible through comprehensive
analyses of 168 sea urchin species representing almost
all extant sea urchin families. This approach entails the
combined use of invasive and non-invasive techniques,
which permits to reconsider data provided in publications dating back almost 200 years. However, in many
cases our observations had to be based upon single specimens due to the scarcity of certain species, especially
those from the deep sea. It should be noted that the

Page 23 of 32

exact delineation of digestive tract structures such as
the esophagus, stomach, intestine, and rectum is still
under debate. Holland & Ghiselin [4] homologized substructures based on histological analyses. However, Jensen [6] mentioned - similar to Lewis’ observations on
Diadema antillarum [24] - that she had found valves
within the digestive tract that would permit recognition
of unequivocal homologies of sea urchin digestive tract

published, so we base our designations primarily on
Holland & Ghiselin’s scheme [4].
Criteria employed to homologize substructures of the sea
urchin anterior stomach

In this section, we present a number of homology
hypotheses that apply to all sea urchin taxa analyzed in
this study: (i) presence or absence of festoons and of a
gastric caecum in ambulacrum III; (ii) shape and size of
the gastric caecum; (iii) mesenterial suspension of the
anterior stomach and any substructures; and (iv) integration of the anterior stomach and any substructures
into the haemal system of the digestive tract. The following sections include generalisations that are necessary in order to reveal the underlying homologies.
However, we are aware that a certain degree of intraspecies variability present in sea urchins could result in
slightly differing conclusions. A condensed compilation
of the findings presented in this section is available in
Table 4.
(i) Absence or presence of festoons and of a gastric caecum
in the anterior stomach

The entire stomach is always more or less festooned in
“regular” sea urchins (Figure 9A-K), whereas in irregular
sea urchins these vertical inflections are absent (Figure
9L-T). In “regular” and basal irregular sea urchin species, the anterior stomach is always located in Amb III
or in Amb III and its adjoining interambulacra. In contrast, in the Atelostomata (Figure 9S, T), the anterior
stomach extends from about Amb I to at least IAmb 3,
although the exact homologies are still a matter of
debate [4,6,12,15]. The number of festoons in Amb III
may vary from none in the Irregularia, a single one in
the Cidaroida (at the border of Amb III and IAmb3), to
two in the “regular” Euechinoidea (at the borders of
Amb III and IAmb 2 as well as Amb III and IAmb 3).
This finding implies that the Cidaroida generally possess
nine stomach festoons in total, whereas the “regular”
Euechinoidea possess ten stomach festoons. Apart from
the additional festoon in Amb III, the “regular” Euechinoidea deviate from the cidaroid scheme by the presence of a more or less developed dilation lateral to the
additional festoon located at the border of Amb III and
IAmb 2. It is this dilation that in the Irregularia is present in the form of a pouch, and we therefore

The results have been condensed in order to provide a general overview of the phylogenetically informative characters (13 in total) that could be derived from
our analysis. See the “Phylogenetic implications” section of the “Discussion” for an explanation of the characters used. - = not applicable, ? = data not available.

homologize these structures, designating them from
here on with the term “gastric caecum”. This potential
homology was also briefly mentioned by Koehler [9].
Of specific interest are those sea urchin taxa that lack
a gastric caecum entirely or in which this structure can
be found either in a reduced state or fused with adjoining structures. The single echinothurioid species so far
known to lack the additional festoon as well as the gastric caecum is Asthenosoma ijimai, as depicted by Agassiz & Clark [32]. Since this description deviates from
that of other species within the Echinothuriidae, it
might be possible that the conspicuous lateral outcrop
of the intestine in Amb III (Figure 3G) could actually be
a part of the anterior stomach. Although the morphology of the esophagus in Chaetodiadema pallidum (Figure 4D) closely resembles that in other diadematid
species, the stomach resembles that of cidaroids with
respect to festoon number (nine) and gastric caecum
(absent) in Amb III. Since this observation diverges
from that in other diadematids, it needs to be verified in
additional material. The digestive tract in arbacioids and
salenioids is unlike those of most other “regular” sea
urchin species because of its largely un-festooned, flat
aspect that resembles the situation found in irregular
sea urchins. Although it is difficult to differentiate individual festoons and the gastric caecum macroscopically
in the Arbacioida and Salenioida, mesenterial strands
connecting the digestive tract with the test clearly reveal
the presence of these structures.
The apparent lack of a gastric caecum in the derived
Clypeasteroida (Laganidae onwards, see Figure 2) is
notable. Koehler [63] also mentioned the absence of
such a structure in the derived clypeasteroids that he
had termed the “glande intestinale” based on his analyses of the Clypeasteridae and Arachnoididae. However,
he rejected a potential homology between this structure
and the gastric caecum which he had previously
observed in spatangoid taxa. Based on our data, we do
not follow Koehler and instead consider the gastric caecum to be present in at least the two basal-most extant
clypeasteroid taxa, the Clypeasteridae and the Arachnoididae. Whether the frilled zone (or sacculated area) at
the abaxial edge of most parts of the stomach in certain

derived clypeasteroid taxa must be considered a derivative of the gastric caecum needs to be assessed using
comparative histological analyses on freshly fixed specimens. Our preliminary analyses using museum specimens were not successful due to the state of the
material. Histological or even ultrastructural inferences
might also be needed to determine whether the gastric
caecum could have been internalized in taxa that lack
both the gastric caecum as well as the sacculated area
such as the Laganidae, the Fibulariidae, and the Rotulidae. Two further taxa within the Irregularia in which a
gastric caecum appears to be absent are the two spatangoid genera Aeropsis and Aceste. No histological data
are currently available for these taxa, and unfortunately
not much is known regarding the biology of these deepsea echinoids. So far, these two genera are the only
known to lack the prominent gastric caecum that seems
to be a characteristic feature of all other members of
the Atelostomata.
(ii) Shape and size of the gastric caecum

The gastric caecum observed in the “regular” as well as
the irregular Euechinoidea varies greatly in shape and
size. In “regular” species, this structure is most prominent in taxa such as the Echinothurioida (e.g. Figure
3D) or the Diadematidae (e.g. Figure 4C). In the latter
taxon, its orientation has additionally shifted from a lateral towards an adaxial position. However, a large gastric caecum can also be found in basal echinacean taxa
such as Glyptocidaris crenularis (Figure 4E) and Stomopneustes variolaris (Figure 4F), its position lateral to the
additional festoon in Amb III resembling the situation
in the Echinothurioida rather than that in the Diadematidae. A small lateral dilation may be present in the
Cidaroida as well, but based on the above mentioned
homology hypothesis, we rule out any evolutionary relationship of this structure with the gastric caecum present in the Euechinoidea. Whether the cidaroid dilation
has to be seen as the precursor (or the successor) of the
additional festoon in Amb III encountered in “regular”
euechinoids is impossible to determine based on the
currently available data alone.
Although a gastric caecum is present in the more
derived taxa of the Echinacea such as the Arbacioida,

Ziegler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/313

the Salenioida, and the Temnopleuroida, its exact size
and shape are difficult to determine because it is largely
fused with the adjoining additional festoon in Amb III.
The distributional patterns of shape and size of the gastric caecum are more complex within the taxon Echinoida. Here, in the Parasaleniidae, Echinometridae,
Strongylocentrotidae, and in part also the Toxopneustidae, the morphology of the anterior stomach closely
resembles that found in Stomopneustes variolaris (Figures 4, 5, and 9). In contrast, the anterior stomach in
the Parechinidae, Echinidae, and in part also in the Toxopneustidae is characterized by a gastric caecum that is
largely fused with the additional festoon in Amb III, and
which therefore more closely resembles the situation
encountered in the Temnopleuroida.
A rather common feature of the gastric caecum in the
Irregularia is its position at the outer edge of the anterior stomach. However, despite this trait, the greatest
variability in size and shape of the gastric caecum can
be observed in irregular sea urchins. Here, the gastric
caecum can either be absent (as in the derived Clypeasteroida and certain Spatangoida) or present in the form
of multiple small nodules (basal Clypeasteroida), as multiple finger-like pouches (certain Cassiduloida), as well
as in the form of a single smooth or lobate pouch that
may extend from about a third (e.g. Echinoneus, Figure
9L) to more than half of the specimen’s entire test
length (e.g. Abatus, Figure 9T). In addition, the connections of the gastric caecum to the anterior stomach may
be either through a broad canal or through a slit-like
opening which may aid in preventing sediment grains
from entering - the gastric caecum of the irregular sea
urchins observed in this study always had a liquid content (Figure 11H-L). Furthermore, the macroscopic
appearance of the gastric caecum in most Irregularia is
always that of a thin-walled, semi-transparent pouch
which in most cases easily permits distinction of this
part of the stomach.
Interestingly, the description by Agassiz [13] of the gastric caecum in Metalia sternalis, a derived spatangoid,
closely resembles that of the gastric caecum found in cassiduloids. Since we have never found a similarly shaped
gastric caecum in any other spatangoid, we presume that
Agassiz must have erred when determining the species.
Although Koehler [9] noted differences in the extent to
which the walls of the gastric caecum are covered in
folds within spatangoids, we were not able to identify any
meaningful pattern within this taxon. However, the gastric caecum in the Cassidulidae, Echinolampadidae, Neolampadidae, basal Clypeasteroida, as well as certain
Holasteroida is smooth-walled; we consider this condition to be a derived feature, based on the presence of a
lobate gastric caecum in the more basal irregular taxa
Echinoneidae (Figure 9L) and Apatopygidae (Figure 6B).

Page 26 of 32

Analyses of different developmental stages of specimens from five species, Paracentrotus lividus, Psammechinus miliaris, Echinometra viridis, Echinoneus
cyclostomus and Arachnoides placenta reveal that the
additional festoon as well as the gastric caecum are present already in juvenile specimens. The observed distinct
architecture of the anterior stomach must therefore be
considered as a development-independent feature.
(iii) Mesenterial suspension of the anterior stomach

Of particular interest for the elucidation of gastric caecum homologies are the various mesenteries that are
involved in the suspension of the anterior stomach. The
abaxial edge of the entire stomach is usually attached to
the test through a more or less continuous mesenterial
sheet that also follows the vertical inflections of the festoons, in turn permitting to identify individual festoons
using primarily MRI. A second mesentery, termed the
dorso-ventral mesentery, attaches the esophagus to the
test as well as to the axial complex [31]. The gastric caecum is partly surrounded by and, therefore, included
within this mesentery. Except for the Cidaroida (which
do not possess the additional festoon in Amb III as well
as the gastric caecum) and atelostomates (detailed
below), the dorso-ventral mesentery extends from the
central oral-aboral axis towards the test near the border
of IAmb 2 and Amb III (Figure 11B-J). In the more
derived Spatangoida (Brissidae onwards, see Figure 2),
this connection has shifted counter-clockwise at least as
far as IAmb 3, resulting in an oblique form of the entire
gastric caecum (Figure 11K, L) as opposed to a straight
form seen in most other irregular sea urchins (Figure
11H-J). A similar observation can be made in certain
holasteroid species, especially in Corystus (Figure 8A)
and Urechinus (Figure 8C).
Further suspension of the anterior stomach can be
observed in the Diadematidae, where the “ends” of the
lower gut loop (i.e. the stomach) are fused by a strong
mesentery (Figure 4A). A similar - clearly convergent development can be observed in the Clypeasteridae (Figure 6E).
(iv) Integration of the anterior stomach into the digestive
tract haemal system

Sea urchins are characterized by a relatively complex
haemal system [9,22,33,43]. The stomach is well integrated into this system and is supplied by an inner as
well as outer marginal haemal duct. The inner marginal
haemal duct ascends from the esophageal haemal ring
along the esophagus and borders the adaxial edge of the
anterior stomach (Figure 12A). The outer marginal haemal duct borders the abaxial edge of the anterior stomach and sends out branches towards the dorso-ventral
mesentery which is connected to the axial complex and
its haemal spaces. The outer marginal haemal duct is
present in this form presumably in all “regular” sea

Stomopneustidae (C), Temnopleuridae (D), Parasaleniidae (E), Parechinidae (F), Strongylocentrotidae (G), Echinoneidae (H), Cassidulidae (I),
Schizasteridae (J), Loveniidae (K), and Spatangidae (L). The gastric caecum - where present - is attached to esophagus, axial complex, and the
test through the dorso-ventral mesentery (arrows). In the Cidaroida (A), the dorso-ventral mesentery attaches to the single festoon present in
ambulacrum III. In the more derived spatangoid and certain holasteroid taxa, this mesentery is shifted away from its original insertion near
ambulacrum III towards interambulacrum 3, resulting in an oblique position of the gastric caecum (K, L). Note that the gastric caecum, in
contrast to the rest of the digestive tract, is always free of sediment grains in the burrowing irregular taxa (H-L). Not to scale.

urchins (Figure 12B). In the Spatangoida, the outer marginal haemal duct is located on the aboral side of the
gastric caecum (Figure 12C). The inner marginal haemal
duct, however, underwent considerable changes,
although the precise timing of these events is difficult to
trace based on the present data alone. These changes
have led to the evolution of a side-branch of the inner
marginal haemal duct which descends from the main

branch in order to supply the adoral side of the gastric
caecum. Such a novel side-branch can be found in the
Clypeasteroida (Figure 6E, F) as well as the Spatangoida
(Figure 12D). We were not able to identify this structure
in the Echinoneoida, the Cassiduloida, or the Holasteroida and are therefore unsure about its origins. As indicated above, a number of authors elaborated on the
complex anatomy of the sea urchin haemal system and

branches towards the dorso-ventral mesentery (dm) which is connected to the axial complex (ac) (A). The gastric caecum (gc) - if present (B-D) is well-integrated into the haemal system. The black arrow in (D) depicts the conspicuous side branch of the inner marginal haemal duct

so far the Cidaroida [33], the Echinothurioida [34], the
Arbacioida [22], the Echinoida [22,23,43,48], the Temnopleuroida [41], the Clypeasteroida [40,55], and the
Spatangoida [8,9,12,64,66,69] have been covered. Since
the present study did not reveal any novel data on this
subject, we will not consider the haemal system of the
digestive tract any further.
Evolutionary origin of the highly specialized gastric
caecum

As detailed in the previous section, we believe the gastric caecum found in most irregular sea urchins to be
homologous with the dilation of the anterior stomach
observed in the “regular” Euechinoidea. This dilation
can therefore be seen as the precursor of the spatangoid

gastric caecum, proposing a solution for the question of
the evolutionary origin of this enigmatic organ.
If we consider the presence of the additional festoon
as well as the gastric caecum in Amb III as a synapomorphy of the Euechinoidea, in turn the question of the
origin of these structures arises. Since the extant sister
group to the Euechinoidea, the Cidaroida, possesses
only a single festoon in Amb III, we are not able to
determine precisely what the condition in the ancestor
of both taxa might have been. To clarify this aspect,
analyses of mesenterial strand imprints upon the internal part of the test, potentially visible in extant and
well-preserved fossil specimens (sensu Roman [73]),
might be helpful. It seems obvious to assume that the
ancestor of both Cidaroida and Euechinoidea should

Ziegler et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:313
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/313

have possessed two festoons in Amb III, given the
otherwise strong pentameric arrangement of the internal
anatomy of “regular” sea urchins. This notion is supported in part by the comparatively large anterior stomach in two basal cidaroid taxa, the Histocidaridae and
the Ctenocidaridae, which could hint at a stepwise
reduction of the additional festoon within the Cidaroida.
But then the question arises as to why the Cidaroida
had lost this part of the anterior stomach, since there is
no structure occupying the void between the first (in
Amb III) and the last (in Amb II) festoon of the stomach that can be found in all cidaroids - Stewart’s
organs as well as large gonads are present in the basal
Euechinoidea as well. Further studies on the general
homology of mesenteries in sea urchins might help to
answer this question.
A probable explanation for the presence of additional
digestive tract elements in the basal Euechinoidea such
as the Echinothurioida or Diadematidae might be that
their feeding habits differ from those of the Cidaroida.
Most “regular” sea urchins are considered omnivorous,
although cidaroids display a certain degree of carnivory,
whereas most other “regular” echinoids are considered
omnivorous with herbivorous habits [5]. In addition, the
“regular” euechinoids are capable of forming so-called
food pellets, primarily using their buccal cavity and
pharynx. To what degree the additional festoon as well
as the gastric caecum might play a role in processing
mucous-enclosed food pellets needs to be addressed in
future studies. One might hypothesize that water circulation throughout the digestive tract is facilitated when
the gut content is packed into pellets which in turn
could contribute to the feeding process and its
dynamics. Extended comparative histological analyses
will be necessary to elucidate any potential usefulness of
the gastric caecum in “regular” euechinoids with regard
to feeding or nutrient absorption.
Once present, the gastric caecum was modified during
evolution, with a number of significant changes in “regular” and irregular sea urchins becoming apparent: (i)
reduction of stomach festoons and fusion of the additional
festoon with the lateral dilation (Arbacioida, Salenioida);
(ii) fusion of the additional festoon with the lateral dilation
(Temnopleuroida, some Echinoida); (iii) specialization of
the lateral dilation into a thin-walled, fluid-filled, semitransparent pouch always free of sediment (Irregularia);
(iv) division of the single pouch into numerous finger-like
sacs and further reduction into grape-like nodules (some
Cassiduloida and Clypeasteroida); (v) enlargement of the
pouch combined with a shift of the opening towards the
anterior (some Cassiduloida, Atelostomata), and finally (vi)
shifting of the axis of orientation of the pouch from an
axis along Amb III-IAmb 5 to IAmb 3-Amb I (some
Holasteroida and Spatangoida).

Page 29 of 32

The drastic changes observed within the Irregularia,
including the wholesale reduction of the gastric caecum in
some taxa, presumably correlate with feeding habits and
lifestyle of the various taxa. Although the precise function
of the gastric caecum remains unknown, it seems obvious
that a role in the digestive process can be assumed. Irregular sea urchins are primarily infaunal deposit feeders and
are known to inhabit various types of sediment [74].
Future studies will therefore have to address the question
to what extent the shape and size of gastric caeca might
correlate with sediment type and feeding habits.
Phylogenetic implications

From our anatomical descriptions it becomes clear that
the absence or presence as well as shape and relative
size of the gastric caecum characterizes individual sea
urchin taxa. The compilation of our findings presented
here suggests a number of phylogenetic conclusions.
This includes support for the monophyly of the Cidaroida, the Euechinoidea, as well as the Irregularia. The
divergent shapes of the gastric caecum in cassiduloid
families suggest a potential non-monophyly of the Cassiduloida, a conclusion reached by others (e.g. [75,76]).
The loss of a gastric caecum could furthermore support
the monophyly of the currently unnamed taxon comprising the Laganina and the Scutellina, with additional
support for the Scutellina being obtained through the
presence of a conspicuously frilled zone at the abaxial
edge of most parts of the stomach. Loss of the gastric
caecum in the spatangoid genera Aeropsis and Aceste
could be indicative of the need to group these taxa
more closely together. The presence of a flattened stomach without festoons is in support of a potentially
close relationship between the Salenioida and the Irregularia. The morphology of the anterior stomach in sea
urchins provides a number of characters with phylogenetic signal (see Table 4 for a character matrix):
1. Anterior stomach extends into ambulacra I and II:
absent (0) (Figure 3A); present (1) (Figure 8G).
2. Stomach festoons: absent (0) (Figure 9L); present
(1) (Figure 9C).
3. Number of festoons in ambulacrum III: one (0)
(Figure 3C); two (1) (Figure 3D).
4. Festoons in ambulacrum III: separate (0) (Figure
4F); fused (1) (Figure 4G).
5. Stomach sacculated at abaxial edge: absent (0) (Figure 7C); present (1) (Figure 7L).
6. Gastric caecum: absent (0) (Figure 3B); present (1)
(Figure 3E).
7. Shape of gastric caecum: dilation (0) (Figure 5H);
single pouch (1) (Figure 6A); multiple pouches (2) (Figure 6C).
8. Shape of multiple pouches: finger-like (0) (Figure
6C); grape-shaped (1) (Figure 6E).

9. Mesenterial suspension of gastric caecum: along
axis from ambulacrum III to interambulacrum 5 (0)
(Figure 11J); along axis from interambulacrum 3 to
ambulacrum I (1) (Figure 11K).
10. Position of connection(s) between gastric caecum
and anterior stomach with regard to the gastric caecum:
median (0) (Figure 6A); anteriorly (1) (Figure 8I).
11. Macroscopic appearance of gastric caecum: undifferentiated from stomach (0) (Figure 5B); thin-walled,
semi-transparent (1) (Figure 8M).
12. Stomach ends fused in ambulacrum III: absent (0)
(Figure 4E); present (1) (Figure 4A).
13. Position of dilation in ambulacrum III: lateral (0)
(Figure 4E); adaxial (1) (Figure 4A)

Conclusions
The present study constitutes a contribution towards
better understanding of digestive tract structures in sea
urchins from an evolutionary perspective. Our data
permit identification of the relevant transformational
stages in the course of the evolution of the highly specialized gastric caecum present in the derived Spatangoida. According to our findings, the sea urchin gastric
caecum constitutes a synapomorphy of the Euechinoidea. Its occurrence in “regular” euechinoids is linked
to the presence of an additional festoon of the anterior
stomach in Amb III. Both structures, the additional
festoon and the gastric caecum, are absent in the
Cidaroida. Since the degree of specialization of the gastric caecum is most pronounced in the predominantly
sediment-burrowing irregular taxa, we hypothesize that
its evolution is closely linked to the development of
more elaborate infaunal lifestyles. We provide a comprehensive study of the origin and evolutionary plasticity of a conspicuous digestive tract structure, the
gastric caecum, in a major taxon of the extant invertebrate macrozoobenthos.
Methods
Species used in this study

The specimens referred to in this study are listed in
Tables 2 and 3 together with information on the systematic classification of each species, the source of the
data used in the study, specimen ID where applicable,
and literature references. The freshly fixed specimens
were collected in Elba (Italy), Heligoland (Germany),
Sydney Harbour (Australia), Discovery Bay (Jamaica),
New Caledonia (France) or were purchased from aquarium supply companies. The systematic classifications
are based upon results obtained by [75-84].
Dissection and photography

Dissection was performed on freshly fixed as well as
museum specimens under direct observation through a

Page 30 of 32

stereo-microscope equipped with a digital camera for
documentation.
Magnetic resonance imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed using the
methods described in [25,85,86]. Imaging was carried
out in Berlin and Würzburg, Germany using high-field
small animal MRI scanners equipped with 7 T, 9.4 T,
and 17.6 T super-conducting electromagnets, respectively. The resolution of the datasets acquired varied
between ~(20 μm)3 and (96 μm)3 for 3D protocols and
was 50 × 50 × 200 μm3 or 78 × 78 × 300 μm3 for the
2D protocols employed. Tables 2 and 3 list the resolutions achieved for every species analyzed by MRI. Image
processing was carried out using ImageJ 1.42q (NIH,
USA) and its Volume Viewer plugin. Unfortunately, we
are currently unable to provide the raw image data
online due to the lack of a centralized repository for
digital morphological data (see [87] for discussion).
3D modelling and visualization

3D image reconstruction and modelling were performed
using the methods described in [25,85,86]. The interactive 3D models in Figure 10 were embedded using the
Adobe 3D Reviewer software (part of the Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended suite) according to procedures
described in [88-90]. All figures were arranged and
assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Adobe
Illustrator CS3.
