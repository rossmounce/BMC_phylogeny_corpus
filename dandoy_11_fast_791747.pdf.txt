Abstract
Background: In industrial fermentation processes, the rate of milk acidification by Streptococcus thermophilus is of
major technological importance. The cell-envelope proteinase PrtS was previously shown to be a key determinant
of the milk acidification activity in this species. The PrtS enzyme is tightly anchored to the cell wall via a
mechanism involving the typical sortase A (SrtA) and initiates the breakdown of milk casein into small
oligopeptides. The presence or absence of PrtS divides the S. thermophilus strains into two phenotypic groups i.e.
the slow and the fast acidifying strains. The aim of this study was to improve the milk acidification rate of slow S.
thermophilus strains, and hence optimise the fermentation process of dairy products.
Results: In the present work, we developed for the first time a strategy based on natural transformation to confer
the rapid acidification phenotype to slow acidifying starter strains of S. thermophilus. First, we established by gene
disruption that (i) prtS, encoding the cell-envelope proteinase, is a key factor responsible for rapid milk acidification
in fast acidifying strains, and that (ii) srtA, encoding sortase A, is not absolutely required to express the PrtS activity.
Second, a 15-kb PCR product encompassing the prtS genomic island was transfered by natural transformation
using the competence-inducing peptide in three distinct prtS-defective genetic backgrounds having or not a
truncated sortase A gene. We showed that in all cases the milk acidification rate of transformants was significantly
increased, reaching a level similar to that of wild-type fast acidifying strains. Furthermore, it appeared that the prtSencoded activity does not depend on the prtS copy number or on its chromosomal integration locus.
Conclusion: We have successfully used natural competence to transfer the prtS locus encoding the cell-envelope
proteinase in three slow acidifying strains of S. thermophilus, allowing their conversion into fast acidifying
derivatives. The efficient protocol developed in this article will provide the dairy industry with novel and optimised
S. thermophilus starter strains.

Introduction
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used as starter cultures in the manufacture of dairy products due to their
efficient utilisation of milk constituents, principally lactose and caseins. Their capacity to produce lactic acid as
the main metabolic end-product of lactose fermentation
is of major economic importance, since acidification
inhibits the growth of spoilage organisms. Previous studies highlighted a link between the presence of an efficient casein proteolytic system and fast growth and
acidification rate of LAB in milk [1]. Casein breakdown
is initiated by the cell-envelope proteinases (CEPs) and
the resulting oligopeptides are then transported into the
cell where they are further hydrolysed by a set of various
intracellular peptidases [2,3]. LAB possess generally only
one CEP, but some strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii
subsp. bulgaricus present two or more CEP-encoding
genes [4-6]. Similar to many surface proteins such as
adhesins, CEPs generally contain a C-terminal LPXTG
motif and are anchored to the cell wall via a mechanism
involving the typical sortase A (SrtA) in Gram-positive
bacteria [3,7]. Transpeptidation of LPXTG proteins by
the membrane-bound SrtA involves two steps: (i) a cleavage reaction inside the LPXTG motif, and (ii) covalent
attachment of the processed and exported N-terminal
form to the pentapeptide chain of one peptidoglycan
repetition unit [8,9].
Streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic LAB
which is considered as the second most important
industrial dairy starter culture after Lactococcus lactis

[10]. The CEP from S. thermophilus, PrtS, is a
LPXTG-containing serine proteinase of the subtilisin
family, similar to the cell envelope protease from other
LAB [7,11,12]. In monoculture, PrtS is essential for
rapid growth of S. thermophilus in milk and therefore
confers a competitive advantage compared to PrtSdeficient strains [1]. However despite its relevant role
for growth in milk, only 21 strains among the 135
strains of the INRA historical collection displayed a
high level of proteinase activity, indicating that this
characteristic is not common in this species [13]. Since
S. thermophilus is generally found in mixed cultures,
growth of PrtS-deficient strains relies on the use of oligopeptides released by other LAB such as L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus or
L. lactis[1]. However, during the last 10 years, this
important metabolic trait for milk adaptation was drastically selected by the dairy industry, resulting in a
strong increase of PrtS+ strains in industrial dairy products [14,15]. These probably result from the attractive
technological implications associated with PrtS +
strains, such as optimal development in milk containing high protein content, rapid milk acidification, and
acceleration of cheese ripening. Recently, Delorme and
co-workers showed that in S. thermophilus, prtS is
located in a 15-kb genomic island that was probably
acquired by horizontal gene transfer [13]. Indeed, this
region which consists of three open reading frames
(ORF) present upstream of prtS is flanked by tandem
repeats of IS elements (Fig. 1).

Besides the fast acidifying phenotype, some S. thermophilus strains harbour other industrially relevant phenotypes such as texturing properties, bacteriocins
production, and phage resistance. However, these features are rarely found together in a single starter strain.
Our objective was to develop a strategy to transfer the
rapid acidification phenotype in different genetic backgrounds. In a first step, we defined the minimum
genetic information associated with this phenotype by
investigating the contribution of PrtS and Sortase A. In
a second step, we took advantage of competence to
transfer prtS from the fast-acidifying strain DGCC7710
into three different slow strains. The PrtS-positive transformants were characterised at the genetic level by PCR
mapping and at the phenotypic level by performing proteinase plate assays and monitoring milk acidification.

Bacterial strains and growth conditions

The S. thermophilus strains used in this study are listed
in Table 1. Strains were grown at 37°C or at 40°C. For
natural transformation experiments, M17 broth (Difco
Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI) and reconstituted CDM
[16] were used. These media were supplemented with 1%
(wt/vol) of lactose (M17L or CDML, respectively).
Two different skimmed milks were used to assess the
proteinase phenotype of strains: 10% (vol/vol) UHT milk
(Candia GrandLait, Candia, France) and reconstituted 9%
(wt/vol) milk (Humana Milchunion, Germany). Solid
agar plates were typically prepared by adding 2% (w/v)
agar to the medium. When necessary, 5 µg ml-1 chloramphenicol was added to the media. Inoculated solid plates,
solely, were incubated in anaerobic conditions (BBL
GasPak Systems, Becton Dickinson, Franklin lakes, NJ).
Proteinase plate assay

The PrtS proteinase phenotype of S. thermophilus
strains was determined on bacterial colonies grown on
Fast Slow Difference Agar (FSDA) medium after 48 to
72 h of incubation at 37°C, as previously reported [17].
This medium contains 1.5% (wt/v) agar, 1.9% (wt/v)
Sodium glycerophosphate (Prolabo, Merck, West Chester, PA), 10% (vol/vol) UHT half-skimmed milk (Candia GrandLait, Candia, France) and 0.001% (wt/v) of the
bromocresol purple (BCP) indicator (Prolabo, Merck,
West Chester, PA). On FSDA plates, bacteria possessing
a proteinase activity appear as yellow, big, opaque colonies surrounded by a yellow area (fast acidifying phenotype), whereas proteinase-negative colonies appear
small, flat, and translucent (slow acidifying phenotype).
Determination of the kinetics parameters of acidification

The acidification activity of S. thermophilus strains was
evaluated by calculating the maximum acidification rate

and time necessary to reach pH 5.2. Practically, reconstituted 10% (wt/vol) UHT skimmed milk (autoclaved during 10 minutes, 110°C) was inoculated with 2% (vol/vol)
of a 5ml-culture of S. thermophilus grown at 37°C during 24h in M17L broth. After 24h of incubation at 37°C,
the cultures were inoculated at 1% (vol/vol) in 150ml
skimmed milk i.e. either 10% (vol/vol) UHT milk (Candia GrandLait) or 9% reconstituted (wt/vol) milk
(Humana Milchunion, Germany). The cultures were
then incubated in a water bath at 40°C and the pH (pH
electrode Mettler 405 DPAS SC, Toledo, Spain) was
monitored during 16 hours using the CINAC system
(Alliance Instruments, France) as previously described
[18,19]. The pH was measured every second and values
obtained during 5 minutes were averaged. The

maximum acidification rate (Vm), defined as the maximum slope of the pH curve (dpH/dt), was calculated
using the CINAC v2.07 software and expressed as pH
units/minute.
Natural transformation experiments

Transformation experiments were performed as previously described [20,21]. Briefly, an overnight culture of
S. thermophilus grown in M17L at 37°C was washed
twice (5,000 × g, 9 min, room temperature) in one
volume of CDML and resuspended in one volume of
CDML. The washed culture was then 30-fold diluted in
CDML and DNA was added to small volumes (300 μl).
The amount of DNA used was either 25 ng (purified
overlapping PCR products) or 10 μg (PCR product
encompassing the prtS genomic island). After 1h30 of
incubation at 37°C, 1 μM of peptide ComS17-24 (purity
>95%; supplied by Peptide 2.0 (Chantilly, VA)) was
added to the culture. After 5 hours, samples (100 μl of
serial dilutions in M17 broth) containing DNA, or not
(negative control), were spread on selective plates and
incubated anaerobically at 37°C. These plates contained
M17L broth supplemented with 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (transformation of lox66-P32-cat-lox71-containing
PCR products) or FSDA medium (transformation of the
prtS genomic island). In the latter case, 108 cells were
plated on FSDA dishes. After 72 hours of incubation,
colonies displaying a fast acidifying phenotype (see
above) i.e. colonies emerging on the lawn of slow acidifying colonies were recovered and isolated on FSDA
plates. The presence of prtS in fast acidifying colonies
was then validated by PCR extension.
DNA techniques

For general molecular biology techniques, we followed
the instructions given by Sambrook et al. [22]. Preparation of S. thermophilus chromosomal DNA was performed as described previously [23]. The primers used
in this study were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing,
Belgium) and are listed in Table S1 of the Additional
file 1. PCRs were performed with Fhusion high-fidelity
DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Espoo, Finland) or LA
Taq™ Polymerase (Takara bio, Otsu, Japan) in a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA).
Construction of prtS and srtA deletion mutants

Mutant strains (ΔsrtA::lox66-P32-cat-lox72 and ΔprtS::
lox66-P32-cat-lox72) of LMD-9 and DGCC7710 were
constructed by replacing the sequence between the start
and stop codons of srtA and prtS with the chloramphenicol resistance cassette lox66-P32-cat-lox71 according
to the procedure described by Fontaine et al. [20].

The primers used to construct these strains are listed in
Table S1 of the Additional file 1.

Results and discussion
Fast acidifying strains contain the prtS genomic island
and a full-length srtA gene

The strategy chosen to optimise the acidification rate of
S. thermophilus strains consists of transferring the minimal genetic requirements associated with the fast acidifying phenotype. Based on previous knowledge on the
functional role of PrtS and Sortase A in the acidification
rate [1,11,12] and activity of LPXTG-surface proteins
[24-26], respectively, we focused our attention on the
co-occurrence of srtA and prtS in fast strains. For this
purpose, we analysed a sample of fast and slow acidifying strains of S. thermophilus. Their phenotype was
determined by a FSDA plate assay (Data not shown and
[20]). They were selected by industrial manufacturers
for their relevant phenotypes related to milk fermentation [20].
The presence of prtS was firstly analysed by PCR
using primers specific to the prtS ORF or flanking genes
(Additional file 1, Table S1). These primers were
designed based on the sequence of the prtS genomic
island in strain LMD-9. Amplification products of the
expected size were obtained for 11 out of the 26 strains
tested (22 strains plus the 4 sequenced strains LMD-9,
LMG18311, CNRZ1066 and ND03) (Data not shown).
As expected, the presence or absence of prtS was in perfect agreement with the fast or slow acidifying phenotypes of strains on FSDA medium, respectively (Table
1). In addition, the systematic finding of a PCR amplification product with primers targeting the two genes
flanking prtS strongly suggests that its genetic context is
similar to that described by Delorme and co-workers
(Additional file 1, Fig. S1) [13]. Next, the 11 prtS ORFs
were sequenced and the corresponding proteins were
aligned with known sequences from strains LMD-9,
CNRZ385 and JIM8232 (Additional file 1, Fig. S2). PrtS
sequences share a high level of conservation at the protein level (between 96% and 100% of identity in pairwise
alignments), which suggests a recent acquisition as
hypothesised by Delorme et al. [13]. However, the phylogenetic tree deduced from the multiple alignment of
PrtS sequences shows that they form three distinct
groups (Additional file 1, Fig. S1). Each cluster is similarly represented, which suggests that at least three different sub-populations have emerged since the initial
acquisition of the prtS locus.
A conserved LPNTG sorting motif was identified in
the C-terminus part of all PrtS proteins (Additional file
1, Fig. S2), supporting our hypothesis of a putative role
for Sortase A in PrtS activity of fast isolates.

PrtS is essential for fast milk acidification while SrtA is
not required

The individual contribution of SrtA and PrtS proteinase
on milk acidification was investigated by replacing the
corresponding ORFs in fast strain LMD-9 and
DGCC7710 by a chloramphenicol resistance marker.
The physiological effects in milk-based medium were
investigated by plating the parental and mutant strains
on FSDA medium and by measuring their acidification
rates in UHT skimmed milk. As expected, both ΔprtS::
lox66-P32-cat-lox71 derivative strains displayed the typical phenotype of slow acidifying strains on FSDA medium. Surprisingly, no striking morphological difference
was observed between colonies of WT and ΔsrtA::lox66P32-cat-lox71 derivatives (Data not shown). These
results were confirmed by monitoring the pH and measuring the acidification kinetics of strains growing in
two skimmed milks: UHT and reconstituted milk. Similar acidification rates were obtained for wild-type and
SrtA-defective strains, while prtS-negative mutants were
severely impaired in their acidification capacities (Data
shown for DGCC7710 and its derivatives in Fig. 2).
Altogether, our results show that prtS is the predominant genetic determinant required for the fast acidification phenotype of S. thermophilus in milk-based
culturing conditions.
Isolation of fast acidifying PrtS+ transformants deriving
from three slow strains

The transfer of prtS from fast to slow strains was
achieved using the natural competence protocol that
was recently developed [20]. The model strains selected
for the proof of concept were DGCC7710 as donor, and
LMG18311, DGCC7666 and DGCC7891 as receivers.

Consequently, the srtA ORFs were PCR-amplified from
the 22 strains, sequenced and compared to srtA from
strains LMD-9 (ster_1255), LMG18311 (stu1277stu1278), CNRZ1066 (str1277-str1278) and ND03
(STND1228). The SrtA proteins are more divergent than
PrtS proteins since they share between 93% and 100%
identity (deduced from pairwise alignments) (Additional
file 1, Figs. S3 and S4). We found that srtA from 7 out
of 26 strains contains the same nonsense mutation that
shortens the ORF size (378 bp instead of 758 bp) (Additional file 1, Fig. S4). The Y123STOP mutation probably
abolishes SrtA activity in those strains. Interestingly, all
PrtS+ isolates encode a full-length srtA ORF. Their SrtA
protein also contains the conserved catalytic residues
(H147, C212 and R220), essential for sortase activity
[8,9]. The co-occurrence of a full-length srtA and prtS
in fast acidifying isolates strongly suggests that these
two components are both required for an optimal fast
acidifying phenotype in S. thermophilus.

crosses) and PrtS- (ΔprtS:: lox66-P32-cat-lox71; green triangles)
derivatives. All experiments were performed in the reconstitued milk
at 40°C.

These latter strains were chosen for different reasons: (i)
they encode, or not, a full-length srtA ORF (Table 1),
(ii) they display different transformation rates [20], (iii)
they display different industrially-relevant properties
[20], and (iv) their genome has been sequenced (draft
genome for DGCC7666, unpublished data; and
DGCC7891 is closely related to the recently sequenced
strain ND03) [29]. A 15,283-kb PCR product encompassing the whole prtS island (between ster_0839 and
ster_0850) (Fig.1) from strain DGCC7710 was used as
donor DNA. The entire region was sequenced and
shares 99 % identity with the prtS region of LMD-9.
The IS elements (ISSth1 and IS1167) flanking the prtS
locus would mediate double homologous recombination
events between the PCR-amplified DNA fragment and
the chromosome of receiver strains. Indeed, these elements are widespread among S. thermophilus genomes
(Table 2; Additional file 1, Fig. S3). The natural competence experiments were performed in the presence of
10 µg of the purified PCR fragment and transformants
displaying a fast acidifying phenotype were recovered on
FSDA plates. After three successive rounds of isolation
on FSDA plates, the stable acquisitions of the prtS genomic island in fast acidifying clones were confirmed by
PCR mapping. The integration site(s) of the prtS island
were then determined by PCR on 3 to 5 clones
per strain using a primer specific to ISSth1 or IS1167
flanking genes, and the prtS locus (Additional file 1,
Table S1). A random insertion of the prtS locus in both

To further characterise the phenotype of PrtS+ derivative strains, their performance was analysed by determining kinetics parameters of acidification in milk. We
tested culture conditions that are mimicking those
encountered in industrial fermentation processes i.e. in
the 10% UHT skimmed milk (vol/vol), and the 9% (wt/
vol) reconstituted skimmed milk. The results are presented in Fig. 3 and in Table 3. Compared to the parental strains, acidification rates of all derivatives were
remarkably improved (2.4 fold) in both milks. In addition, we observed a reduction of the latency period i.e.
the time before the pH begins to decrease (Fig. 3 and
Data not shown). Consequently, a significantly shorter
fermentation time is needed to obtain pH 5.2 (2 to 3fold) (Table 3). Interestingly, the acidification curves
obtained in both milks were almost identical among all
PrtS + clones deriving from the same parental strain.
They were also similar to natural fast acidifying strains
DGCC7710 or LMD-9 (Table 3 and Data not shown).
Altogether, our results show that the transfer of the
prtS island between S. thermophilus strains is sufficient
as such to convert slow acidifying strains into transformants displaying fast activities similar to PrtS+ natural
isolates. In addition, acquisition of this property was
shown to be independent of the prtS copy number or
the chromosomal integration locus.

ISSth1 and IS1167 loci was detected among strains and
isolated clones (Table 2). Multiple insertions were also
observed, reaching in some cases up to seven copies of
prtS in the same clone (Table 2). The stable maintenance of prtS copies in three clones per strain was then
studied in liquid milk-based medium. After ~160 generations, the copy number and the insertion profile
determined by PCR mapping remained unchanged in all
isolates (Data not show).

Conclusion
To our knowledge, we performed for the first time a
stable and fully functional transfer of the prtS locus in
PrtS-deficient backgrounds of S. thermophilus. By comparing the PrtS+ derivative transformants isolated in this
study to (i) natural fast and slow acidifying isolates and
(ii) prtS and srtA mutants, we have ultimately shown
that PrtS is the most relevant trait responsible for rapid
milk acidification. In monoculture, acquisition of a proteolytic system capable of producing short oligopeptides
from the casein matrix fulfils thus optimally the nutritional requirements of S. thermophilus in milk. The
housekeeping sortase A is not required for full PrtS
activity and optimal milk acidification. However, we can
not exclude that it could be required in other culturing

conditions or for the anchorage and activity of others
putative sortase substrates. In absence of sortase A, it is
probable that most of active PrtS proteins remain
anchored in the cell membrane through their C-terminal
hydrophobic domain (downstream of the LPXTG motif).

Further studies would be required to fully explore the
relation between the SrtA protein and its PrtS substrate
in S. thermophilus.
The PrtS+ phenotype was previously reported to be
only present in a few strains of S. thermophilus. However, since a decade the proportion of strains isolated
from industrial dairy products displaying this phenotype
has sharply increased, indicating a significant interest of
the food industry for this infrequent adaptation [11-15].
The transfer protocol developed in this work is applicable to all transformable S. thermophilus strains, provided the insertion sites for prtS island i.e. ISSth1 or
IS1167 elements are present in their genome. It will
thus provide the dairy industry with novel and improved
starter strains of S. thermophilus, which performed better under fermentation processes and may have a nonGenetically Modified Microorganisms (GMM) status
according to the European Legislation [20,30].
