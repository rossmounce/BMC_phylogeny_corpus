Interspecific and interploidal gene flow in Central
European Arabidopsis (Brassicaceae)

Abstract
Background: Effects of polyploidisation on gene flow between natural populations are little known. Central
European diploid and tetraploid populations of Arabidopsis arenosa and A. lyrata are here used to study
interspecific and interploidal gene flow, using a combination of nuclear and plastid markers.
Results: Ploidal levels were confirmed by flow cytometry. Network analyses clearly separated diploids according to
species. Tetraploids and diploids were highly intermingled within species, and some tetraploids intermingled with
the other species, as well. Isolation with migration analyses suggested interspecific introgression from tetraploid A.
arenosa to tetraploid A. lyrata and vice versa, and some interploidal gene flow, which was unidirectional from
diploid to tetraploid in A. arenosa and bidirectional in A. lyrata.
Conclusions: Interspecific genetic isolation at diploid level combined with introgression at tetraploid level
indicates that polyploidy may buffer against negative consequences of interspecific hybridisation. The role of
introgression in polyploid systems may, however, differ between plant species, and even within the small genus
Arabidopsis, we find very different evolutionary fates when it comes to introgression.

Background
Polyploidy, i.e. whole genome duplication, has long been
considered a major evolutionary force in the Plant Kingdom [see e.g., [1-5]], and even though large advances in
our understanding of polyploidy have been made during
the last couple of decades, there are still many questions
unanswered [reviewed by [6]]. We still don’t have a general agreement on classification of polyploids, for
instance. Some authors work with strict taxonomic definitions; autopolyploids are the result of polyploidisation
events involving only a single species, and allopolyploids
are the result of interspecific hybridisation [e.g., [3]].
Others base their definitions on inheritance patterns
and the presence or absence of multivalents [e.g., [7]].
However, most would agree that auto- and allopolyploids are the extremes of a continuous range. There
are also still controversies about how polyploids should
be treated taxonomically. Soltis et al. [8] suggest that
autopolyploids deserve species rank taxonomically, with
ploidal level as part of the name. Others do not even

give allopolyploids species status due to lack of morphological distinctness (e.g., lack of diagnostic qualitative
and discrete characters), and include them as subspecies
of one of the parents [e.g., [9]]. Yet others separate morphological and biological species where the first may
contain several of the latter [e.g., [10]].
Traditionally, polyploidisation events have been considered to result in total reproductive isolation of the
new polyploid from the parent (s), and thus regarded as
instant speciation [e.g., [11]]. More recent research has
shown that recurrent formation of polyploids and triploid bridges contribute to interploidal gene flow
[3,12,13]. To what extent, however, is still not known
[6]. Multiple independent polyploidisation events have
been shown to be common for both allopolyploids [e.g.,
[14,15]] and autopolyploids [e.g., [16-18]]. Population
studies and modelling of sympatric Chamerion angustifolium (L.) Holub revealed that autotetraploids are not
necessarily instantly isolated from their diploid progenitors, but that the isolation can become more prevalent
through time [19,20]. Slotte et al. [21] showed that there
is unidirectional gene flow from diploid Capsella rubella
Reuter to its allotetraploid descendant C. bursa-pastoris
(L.) Medicus. Furthermore, if polyploidisation events

result in immediate isolation from the progenitors, the
result should be a major bottleneck. However, several
studies have shown higher genetic diversity in polyploids
compared to their progenitors [22-26], although this is
not always the case [14,27-30]. The increased diversity
may be the result of either recurrent formation of the
polyploids [e.g., [1]], or past or ongoing interploidal
gene flow through, for instance, triploid bridges [e.g.,
[19]]. These different models of polyploidisation can be
seen as a gradient. Single event polyploidisation with
subsequent reproductive isolation represents one end of
this gradient whereas polyploidisation with ongoing
gene flow or recurrent polyploidisation represents the
other. Instances where polyploidisation is followed by
historical gene flow which later stopped, or where polyploidisation is followed by reproductive isolation and
subsequent gene flow in the form of secondary contact
[31], could be considered as intermediate forms. Criteria
and methods to distinguish between these different categories, though, have not yet been proposed [6].
Arabidopsis (DC.) Heynh. is a small genus consisting
mostly of diploids, but includes both allopolyploids
[14,32-35] and taxonomic autopolyploids [36-41]. As the
genus includes the geneticists’ pet plant A. thaliana L.,
plenty of molecular tools are available also for its relatives [e.g., the recent release of the A. lyrata genome,
[42]], making the genus ideal for studying polyploid evolution. In Central Europe two species have been
recorded with two ploidal levels each: A. arenosa (L.)
Lawalrée (hereafter arenosa) represents a complex species aggregate [38] with diploid taxa occurring mainly in
the Carpathians and possibly in a few regions further
south in Hungary and Croatia, whereas tetraploid arenosa is found in most of Central Europe. In contrast A.
lyrata (L.) O’Kane & Al-Shehbaz (hereafter lyrata) is
mostly diploid throughout its European distribution
range, but several tetraploid populations are found in
the Eastern Austrian Forealps and neighbouring regions
[39,43,44]. Schmickl and Koch [45] detected significant
levels of introgression from tetraploid arenosa into the
gene pool of diploid and tetraploid lyrata, resulting in
introgressed tetraploid populations in the Eastern Austrian Forealps and the northerly adjacent Danube Valley,
using microsatellite markers and morphometrics. These
results, based on genetic and morphological admixture
and differentiation, suggest past and ongoing gene flow
between the two taxa. To distinguish between ancient
and recent gene flow, especially in polyploid complexes,
has long been controversial, and no clear criteria have
yet been commonly acknowledged [6]. Here we use lowcopy nuclear and plastid DNA sequences from the Arabidopsis model system and different analytical methods
to study interspecific and interploidal gene flow in lyrata and arenosa, specifically asking, 1) whether

Page 2 of 13

interploidal gene flow takes place in one or both directions, 2) how polyploidisation affects interspecific introgression and 3) whether it is possible to distinguish
between recurrent formation and introgression from
progenitors.

Methods
Material

Three to five Central European populations of each ploidal level (2x and 4x) from both arenosa and lyrata were
included in this study (Table 1; Figure 1) with a total of
16 populations. Lyrata 2x, lyrata 4x and arenosa 4x
were mostly sampled in close proximity in the Eastern
Austrian Forealps. Arenosa 2x was sampled in Slovakian
Carpathians. The material was collected in the wild as
living plants or seeds from defined single mother plants
and grown in the Botanical Garden, University of Heidelberg, and the Phytotron, University of Oslo. Fresh
leaves of 1-43 plants from most populations (274 individuals in total; Table 1) were later collected for flow
cytometry analyses. Leaves from two specimens per
population were dried using silica gel to preserve DNA
before extraction.
Flow cytometry

Relative nuclear DNA content of 274 specimens from 14
populations (Table 1) were estimated by flow cytometry
analyses performed by G. Geenen (Plant Cytometry Services, Schijndel), using DAPI staining, the Arabidopsis
buffer described in Doležel and Suda [46] and Ilex crenata Thunb. ‘Fastigiata’ as internal standard, otherwise
following the protocol described in Jørgensen et al. [30].
The populations a4_GER and a4_AUT3 were not
included in the analyses as we did not have living material from these at the time of the analysis. However,
microsatellite data for these populations indicate that
they are tetraploid (Schmickl and Koch, in preparation).
T-tests were done in SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago) to
test for differences in means of nuclear DNA content
between the taxa.
DNA extraction, cloning, and sequencing

Whole genomic DNA was extracted from leaf tissue
using the DNeasy Plant Mini protocol (Qiagen, Hilden).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the low-copy
nuclear regions chalcone synthase (CHS) and short
chain alcohol dehydrogenase (scADH) was carried out
in 25 μl volumes with 1× DyNAzyme EXT buffer (Finnzymes, Espoo), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.6 μM of each
primer (Additional file 1, Table S1), 0.2 U DyNAzyme
EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes), and 2 μl 10 times
diluted DNA template. Thermocycling conditions consisted of 3 min at 94°C, and 35 cycles of 30 s at 93°C,
30 s at 55°C, 2.5-3 min at 70°C, and a final extension

for 5 min at 70°C. PCR products were cloned using the
TOPO-TA kit for sequencing with the pCR4-TOPO
vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad). Colonies were checked for
inserts by running a PCR with M13 or T7 primers. At
least six insert-containing clones from each PCR reaction were sequenced in both directions. The plastid
region trnL-F was amplified using PuReTaq Ready-ToGo PCR beads (GE Healthcare, Waukesha) with 0.6 μM
of each primer (Additional file 1, Table S1) and 2 μL 10
times diluted DNA template. For each DNA region,
both strands were sequenced using BigDye v3.1 7 cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City) and
M13F/M13R or T7 primers. Products of the cyclesequencing reactions were separated on an ABI 3700
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The resulting
sequences were assembled and edited using Vector NTI
advance 10 (Invitrogen), and consensus sequences representing each allele and alignments were made using
BioEdit version 7.0.5 [47]. For the plastid trnL-F region,
only the first 700 base pairs were included in the analyses, to avoid unambiguous alignment due to the presence of pseudogenes [48,49].
PCR-mediated recombinants (chimeras) constitute a
well-known problem in PCR-based cloning protocols
[e.g. [50-55]], and to distinguish between PCRmediated and real recombinants is not possible via
PCR-based methods. However, the risk of obtaining

recombinants as PCR artefacts increases with the concentration of template [51], and the expected frequency of these should be lower than for real
recombinants [50,52]. In this study we omitted clones
that were recombinants of other cloned sequences
from the same individual, and that were present at low
frequencies, as PCR artefacts. Discrepant bases supported by only a single clone were assumed to be due
to polymerase reading error and were corrected based
on consensus sequences of other clones from the same
individual.
Data analyses

Intragenic recombination events may be relatively common [56], and should be taken into consideration when
choosing methods for phylogenetic analysis [57]. Minimum number of recombination events [RM; [58]] per
region was calculated using DnaSP version 5.10 [59]. As
we found substantial recombination for most regions
(Additional file 1, Table S1), phylogenetic relationships
were analysed for each region using neighbour networks
[60], with Jukes-Cantor distances in the program SplitsTree4 [61]. Gaps were included following the simple
coding strategy introduced by Simmons and Ochoterena
[62] as implemented in the software SeqState version
1.4.1 [63]. For all marker systems the datasets were analysed by: 1) splitting the individuals into subsets

according to taxa, 2) including all individuals, and 3)
including only diploids.
When two or three different alleles are found in a tetraploid individual, it is not possible to determine the
true genotype although dosage may give an indication.
Computational methods based among others on the EM
algorithm have been developed to infer genotypes
assuming random mating and populations at equilibrium [e.g. [64]]. As we have sampled two individuals
from several distinct populations, we cannot assume
equilibrium, and chose not to use any statistical method.
To roughly assess the impact of assuming different
numbers of allele copies, we reconstituted genotypes at
random using the following approach: For each tetraploid individual with two or three alleles, a random
number between 1 and 3 was generated. For individuals
with two alleles, 1 corresponded to three copies of the
first allele and one copy of the second (the order was
arbitrary), 2 corresponded to two copies of each allele
and 3 corresponded to one copy of the first allele and
three copies of the second. For individuals with three
alleles, 1 corresponded to duplicating the first allele, 2
to duplicating the second allele and 3 to duplicating the
third allele. Three different datasets (D1, D2, D3) were
generated using this approach. Assuming that the three
allele proportions 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1 are equally probable
for tetraploids with two distinct alleles at a locus leads
to a deficit of 2:2 individuals compared to equilibrium
expectations. Therefore we created a fourth dataset
(D22) where all individuals with two distinct alleles were

Page 4 of 13

considered to have a 2:2 genotype. The four datasets
were used both in diversity calculations and isolation
with migration (IM) analyses.
Diversity indices were calculated for each molecular
region and each species/ploidal level, separately. For the
tetraploids we calculated the indices for the duplicated
datasets D1, D2, D3, and D22, and averaged the estimates. Arlequin version 3.11 [65] was used to calculate
gene diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity averaged over
loci (π), and average number of nucleotide differences
(k) with standard deviations. Differences in diversity
between ploidy levels and between taxa were assessed by
two sided T-tests computed using the standard deviations given by Arlequin.
The parameters of the IM model were estimated as
implemented in the program IMa2 [66,67] to assess the
importance and direction of gene flow between the ploidal levels and species. Samples of arenosa and lyrata
were first analysed separately, to determine whether
there is gene flow between ploidal levels and in which
direction it occurs. Second, in order to assess gene flow
between species, both taxa with both ploidal levels were
analysed together in an analysis with four populations.
We assumed one ancestral population for each species,
and one ancestral population for the whole complex. In
such an analysis with four populations a large number
of parameters have to be estimated, requiring a large
amount of data to obtain reliable estimates. As the three
loci available here were somewhat limited in that
respect, we also analysed only the two diploid taxa to
assess evidence for interspecific gene flow. All analyses
involving tetraploids were carried out for the four different datasets of tetraploid genotypes. One of the assumptions of the IM model is that there is no important gene
exchange with populations not included in the analysis.
As there was evidence for significant gene flow between
ploidal levels in both species, we did not analyse the
two tetraploids together. Another assumption of IMa2 is
that there is no recombination. Tests for recombination
[58,68] showed, however, that there was considerable
recombination in the nuclear sequences used here. The
program IMgc [69] was used to find the largest subsets
of the data matrix without signs of recombination (nonrecombining blocks) by removing either sequences or
variable sites. The program can prioritise the number of
sequences kept or the number of variable sites. We first
used the default value 1 for the prioritising parameter.
As some of the sequences got very short (datasets def;
Additional file 2, Table S2), we produced additional subsets using a value of 0.5, retaining more variable sites
and fewer sequences (datasets seq). This option was
used for arenosa and lyrata, but it could not be used for
the total and diploid datasets, because it reduced the
number of sequences of diploid arenosa to three or less

Jørgensen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:346
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/346

(Table S2). Reducing the data to non-recombining
blocks reduces the amount of data and leads to a loss of
diversity, which may lead to a downward bias in estimates of effective population sizes obtained from IM.
Divergence time and gene flow estimates have, however,
been shown to be largely unaffected [70].
The parameter estimates provided by IMa2 are scaled
by the mutation rate. In order to convert them to demographic estimates, a mutation rate needs to be assumed.
We followed the procedure of Slotte et al. [21]: we
assumed a substitution rate of 6.5·10-9 [71,72] as a lower
boundary for the mutation rate and the synonymous
substitution rate of 1.5·10-8 per site per generation [73]
as an upper boundary, and used the mean of these two
estimates to calculate per-fragment mutation rates
(Additional file 3, Table S3).
IMa2 uses a Bayesian approach and Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to estimate parameters. Priors for effective population sizes (q = 4Ne*μ,
where μ is the migration rate per fragment, not per bp),
time since divergence (t = time*μ) and migration rates
(m = migration rate/μ) were initially chosen as recommended in the IM manual [74] and adjusted according
to the results of preliminary analyses. For the final runs
the following values were used (all values are scaled by
μ = 1.21·10-5): q = 17, t = 10 and m = 5 for arenosa, q
= 20, t = 7 and m = 5 for lyrata, q = 15, t = 10 and m
= 5 for the total dataset, and q = 12, t = 10 and m = 2
for the diploid dataset. The number of chains and the
heating scheme were also tested in several preliminary
runs. For the final runs we used 20 chains and heating
parameters of ha = 0.96 and hb = 0.9 for analyses with
two populations and 80 chains, and ha = 0.999 and hb
= 0.3 for analyses with four populations. The length of
the burnin was 1 000 000 MCMC iterations and estimates were based on between 10 and 27 million iterations. Mixing was assessed by trend plots for estimates
over the runs and by effective sample size (ESS) values.
Convergence was assessed by repeating runs several
times with different random seeds. Some IMa2 runs
were performed on BioHPC, Computational Biology
Service Unit, Cornell University.

Results
DNA content

The ploidal levels for the 14 populations examined are
given in Table 1. Only two populations showed signs of
more than one ploidal level. The tetraploid arenosa
population a4_AUT1 from Kernhof in Austria included
one diploid individual, and the diploid lyrata population
l2_CZE from NW Ivanice in the Czech Republic contained one triploid. The T-test showed that the two taxa
had significantly different DNA content within ploidal
levels for both diploids and tetraploids, lyrata having a

Page 5 of 13

slightly larger nuclear DNA content than arenosa in
both cases (0.23 vs. 0.20, and 0.44 vs. 0.43, P < 0.001).
Sequence variation and diversity

The obtained sequences were deposited to GenBank
with accession numbers GQ386471-GQ386654; 75
sequences of CHS, 59 sequences of scADH, and 32
sequences of trnL-F (Additional file 1, Table S1). Substantial recombination has taken place for both lowcopy nuclear regions. Minimum number of recombination events was 16 for CHS and 24 for scADH (Additional file 1, Table S1). For the plastid trnL-F region,
only a single recombination event was detected.
When analysed alone, the diploids were separated into
two groups corresponding to named taxa in the neighbour networks based on the nuclear markers (Figure 2a,
c), and partly also the plastid region (Figure 2e). CHS
split the lyrata diploids into two distinct groups with
absolutely no geographical structure; both clusters
included specimens from Germany, the Czech Republic,
and Austria (Figure 2a). There was no apparent geographical structure among arenosa specimens either. The
analysis of scADH gave no additional information (Figure 2d). The two taxa didn’t share trnL-F haplotypes,
but all three lyrata haplotypes clustered closer to arenosa than to each other (Figure 2e).
Adding the tetraploids to the neighbour networks
complicated the picture (Figure 2b, d, f). The majority
of the tetraploids clustered according to taxa; tetraploid
lyrata clustered with diploid lyrata, and tetraploid arenosa with diploid arenosa. There were, however, exceptions for all the marker systems. The CHS network
grouped five tetraploid lyrata sequences with tetraploid
arenosa (Figure 2b; Additional file 4, Table S4). These
represent three specimens (with a mixture of lyrataand arenosa-like alleles) of which two are from the
same population (l4_AUT1), collected in Wachau, and
the last one from Schrambach, also in Lower Austria
(population l4_AUT4). In the scADH network, one of
the specimens from the Wachau population
(l4_AUT1_11) shared an allele with a tetraploid arenosa
collected just a few kilometres away (a4_AUT2_18),
whereas the specimen from the Schrambach population
(14_AUT4_2) clustered with a tetraploid arenosa from
Wachau (a4_AUT4_15; Figure 2d; Additional file 4,
Table S4).
In the CHS network ten tetraploid arenosa sequences
clustered with the lyrata groups (Figure 2b). These
represent seven specimens (with a mixture of lyrataand arenosa-like alleles; Additional file 4, Table S4),
most of them from Lower Austria (populations
a4_AUT1, a4_AUT2, and a4_AUT4), but a single one
from Germany (a4_GER). Only one of these tetraploid
arenosa specimens (a4_AUT1_2) contained a lyrata-like

scADH allele and clustered with lyrata in the network
(Figure 2d; Additional file 4, Table S4).
The plastid trnL-F network separated specimens
according to taxa with one exception: the same tetraploid lyrata specimen from Wachau (l4_AUT1_11),
which clustered with arenosa also in the CHS and
scADH networks, shared a haplotype with diploid and
tetraploid arenosa (a2_SVK2, a4_AUT2, and a4_GER,
Figure 2f).
To summarise, these networks basically told the same
story with major splits between lyrata and arenosa, and
with ploidal levels to a high degree intermingled within
each taxon. Deviations from this pattern were found
more or less in the same populations for the different
markers; tetraploid arenosa: a4_AUT1, a4_AUT2,
a4_AUT4 and tetraploid lyrata: l4_AUT1 and l4_AUT4,
all populations from Lower Austria where the two taxa
are sympatric (Table 1; Additional file 4, Table S4).
Analysing the taxa separately for all marker systems
showed that the specimens did not cluster according to
ploidal level (Figure 3). For both species, the CHS and
scADH networks separated groups of a few tetraploids
from the remaining specimens, corresponding to the
deviations mentioned above (Figure 3a, b). Otherwise
specimens of different ploidal levels are completely
intermingled.
Both nuclear regions showed high levels of gene diversity (Hd = 0.93-0.99; Figure 4, Additional file 5, Table
S5). Differences in diversity among the duplicated tetraploid datasets (D1-22) were negligible, and there were
no clear differences between taxa or ploidal levels. For
trnL-F, the diversity was somewhat lower (Hd = 0.600.86), particularly for arenosa. For this marker the diversity was significantly higher in tetraploids than in
diploids of both species (p < 0.05; Figure 4). There were
no significant differences in nucleotide diversity (π) and
average number of nucleotide differences (k) between
ploidal levels or species for trnL-F and CHS. For
scADH, however, both estimates of molecular diversity
were significantly higher for arenosa than for lyrata, and
this was the case for diploids and tetraploids (π: p <
0.005 for tetraploids and p < 0.02 for diploids, and k: p
< 0.001 for tetraploids and p < 0.005 for diploids; Figure
4, Additional file 5, Table S5).
Isolation with migration results

For analyses of pairs of populations all runs reached ESS
values > 1000 and mixing seemed good based on trend
plots. Repeated runs indicated good convergence. The
analyses with four populations did, however, not perform equally well and ESS values remained < 50 for several parameters. We will therefore in the first place base
our conclusions on the pair wise runs, and only mention
the results of the four population runs as indicative.

The main aim of this study was to assess evidence for
gene flow between ploidal levels and species. For arenosa, the IM analysis revealed strong support for gene
flow from diploids to tetraploids, but not in the other
direction (Figure 5, Additional files 6, 7, Fig. S1, S2).
The 95% highest posterior density intervals (HPD) for
the migration rate from diploids to tetraploids excluded
0 for seven of eight datasets where it was estimated reliably (four variants of tetraploid genotypes × two options
of largest non-recombinant blocks; Additional file 2,
Table S2), whereas the estimate of m was at the lowest
value for migration from tetraploids to diploids in all
cases. Estimates of the number of migrants from
diploids to tetraploids were between 2.1 and 4.1, but
HPD intervals were large and overlapped considerably
among both migration directions (Additional file 2,
Table S2). The posterior distribution for time since
divergence did not go down towards 0 at the upper
limit of the prior interval, independent of prior choice,
and divergence time could thus not be properly estimated. Effective population size estimates were 1.5 to 2
times higher for tetraploids than for diploids (Additional
file 6, Fig. S1), but as these are estimates of the effective
number of genes, the estimated number of tetraploid
individuals was in fact somewhat lower than for
diploids.
For lyrata, there was also clear support for gene flow
between the ploidal levels. HPD intervals for gene flow
from diploids to tetraploids excluded 0 for five of eight
datasets (Additional file 2, Table S2) and all estimates of
m were larger than 0. For gene flow from tetraploids to
diploids, HPD distributions did not reach low levels at
high values for gene flow from tetraploids to diploids,
making them unreliable. Still the HPD intervals
excluded 0 for three out of four def datasets, and estimates of m were at the lowest point of the distribution
only for one def dataset and two seq datasets, indicating
gene flow from tetraploids to diploids. The discrepancies
between the different datasets resulted from the fact that
different parts of the sequences were kept by IMgc
(Additional file 2, Table S2). The effective number of
migrants per generation was estimated as 1.5 to 1.8
from diploids to tetraploids and as 1.2 to 1.4 from tetraploids to diploids. As for arenosa, the posterior distributions for time since divergence were not unimodal and
did not provide any reliable estimates. Estimates of
effective population sizes varied also somewhat between
datasets and were in general not different between ploidal levels.
The results of the analysis including all four taxonomic/cytogenetic entities (Additional file 2, Table S2)
were largely consistent with the results of the pair
wise runs, although these estimates have to be considered unreliable due to poor performance of the

Discussion
The overall picture indicated by our results is the following: Both the neighbour nets and the IM analysis
show that there is no gene flow between the two diploid
taxa, a result which is in agreement with expectations
based on their presently well separated distribution
areas [38]. There is, however, evidence for gene flow
from diploids to tetraploids in arenosa and possibly for
interploidal gene flow in both directions in lyrata. This
is consistent with the intermingling of sequences of
both ploidal levels revealed by the networks. The possibility of gene flow from tetraploids to diploids in lyrata
is further supported by the triploid individual found in
population l2_CZE. However, spontaneous occurrence
of triploids in diploid populations is a common phenomenon and might be alternatively explained by lowfrequency production of unreduced gametes. The networks including both species and ploidal levels clearly
indicate mixing of lineages between species. As there
seems to be no gene flow between diploids, we assume
that this mixing results from gene flow into tetraploids.
Consistent with this assumption, the IMa2 analysis of all
four taxonomic/cytogenetic entities suggests gene flow
from diploid and tetraploid arenosa into tetraploid lyrata, and possibly, with much lower frequency, also from
diploid lyrata into tetraploid arenosa.

MCMC (and are therefore not shown). In addition,
these runs suggested gene flow between species, from
diploid and tetraploid arenosa into tetraploid lyrata,
and for one dataset also from diploid lyrata into tetraploid arenosa.
Analysing the two diploid species together (Additional
file 2, Table S2) showed that there was no evidence
what so ever for gene flow between them.

It has been suggested that genotypes of tetraploids are
buffered against the shock of absorbing foreign genomes, and that extensive introgression often takes place
at the tetraploid level between species that are isolated
from each other at the diploid level [75,76]. Our analyses of Arabidopsis in Central Europe show that arenosa and lyrata are good biological species at the
diploid level. The network analyses show no sharing of
alleles, and the main splits are between the two taxa,
which is in agreement with a comprehensive large-scale
analysis of the genus [77]. Furthermore, isolation with
migration (IM) analyses of diploids show no gene flow
from 2x arenosa to lyrata or the other way around.
We do, however, find signs of introgression in the tetraploids on both sides; several tetraploid lyrata
sequences cluster with arenosa in the network analyses
(especially for the CHS region, but also for the other
two regions), and several tetraploid arenosa sequences
cluster with lyrata.
The pattern of gene flow that we observed could alternatively be explained by the fact that diploids of the two
species are spatially separated, whereas the tetraploids
largely overlap in distribution range. Because we lack
proper population samples in the present study, we
could not formally test to what extent a correlation

between genetic and geographic distance could explain
our results (using for instance a Mantel test). However,
the pattern resulting from the IM analyses cannot fully
be explained by geography. IM indeed indicated unidirectional gene flow into tetraploids in arenosa, despite
ploidal levels being at present allopatric. Gene flow from
diploid arenosa into tertraploid lyrata was also suggested by some of the IM results. Therefore our results
are very likely to reflect more than simple isolation by
distance.
To our knowledge there are not many studies that
have dealt with gene flow between sister species that
contain two (or more) ploidal levels. Luttikhuizen et al.
[23] found higher genetic diversity in autotetraploid Rorippa amphibia (L.) Besser compared to conspecific
diploids using microsatellites, and suggested that introgression as well as multiple origins of the tetraploids
might have contributed to the tetraploid diversity. Stift
et al. [78] used crossing experiments to show that there
are limited reproductive barriers between R. amphibia
and the sympatric tetraploid R. sylvestris (L.) Besser, and
concluded that gene flow between the two tetraploids is
the probable reason for the high diversity found in tetraploid R. amphibia by Luttikhuizen et al. [23]. Kloda et
al. [79] studied gene flow among diploid Ononis (O. spinosa L. and O. intermedia C.A.Mey. ex. A.K.Becker) and
tetraploids (O. repens L. and O. maritima Dumort.)
using microsatellites, and found that there were restrictions to gene flow between, but not within the ploidal
levels. In the genus Paeonia L. homoploid hybrid species
have been derived from allotetraploids, but not from the
diploid progenitors, suggesting that chromosomal structural differences induced by polyploidy might create
new opportunities for interspecific gene flow [80]. In
line with this previous evidence, our study suggests that
polyploids might tolerate introgression better than their
diploid progenitors, as suggested by de Wet & Harlan
[75] and Harlan & de Wet [76].

Interploidal gene flow

In general, high genetic diversity in polyploids, as our
network and genetic diversity analyses indicated for
both arenosa and lyrata, can be explained by multiple
independent origins of the polyploids, continuing introgression from the diploids, introgression from other
polyploid species (see above), or as a result of subsequent evolution following one or more old polyploidisation events [see e.g., [3,6]]. Our network analyses for
each species show no apparent clustering according to
ploidal levels; i.e. we do not see a separation of diploids
and tetraploids. For arenosa our IM analyses suggest
that the diploids and the tetraploids are two distinct
groups, with some migration from the diploid to the tetraploid level subsequent to the separation of the two
gene pools. As the diploids from the Carpathians and
the tetraploids from the Eastern Austrian Forealps and
Germany are no longer sympatric, the migration we
observe is probably the result of recurrent origin/introgression in the past. For lyrata our IM analysis suggests
that the gene flow is bidirectional. This is also consistent
with earlier studies [77] considering a broad geographic
and population sampling that demonstrate a deeper evolutionary split between arenosa and lyrata irrespective
of ploidal level variation.
In our flow cytometry data, we find signs of mixedploidy populations: a triploid plant was detected in the
mainly diploid l2_CZE population of lyrata from the
Czech Republic, and a diploid plant was detected in the
mainly tetraploid a4_AUT1 population of arenosa from
the Eastern Austrian Foreland. Also, the Central European Arabidopsis populations often have restricted distributions, and populations of different ploidal levels are
sometimes only a few kilometres apart. Thus, introgression is possible, especially along disturbed sites, e.g.,
along roads. However, the generally low migration rates
suggest that introgression remains a rare event. If this is
the case, the small genus Arabidopsis contains polyploids

Jørgensen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:346
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/346

with very different evolutionary fates when it comes to
introgression. The allotetraploid A. suecica (Fr.) Norrl. ex
O.E.Schulz has very low genetic diversity and has probably originated only once [34,81]. The allotetraploid A.
kamchatica (Fisch. ex DC.) K.Shimizu & Kudoh has
probably originated multiple times, and additionally
experienced some later introgression from the parental
diploids [14,35,82,83]. The tetraploid arenosa shows
some signs of introgression, and the tetraploid lyrata
shows signs of extensive ongoing introgression [cf. [45]].
As such, the genus Arabidopsis might be a good model
system to use for developing the criteria and methods
called for by Soltis et al. [6] for distinguishing between
recurrent formation and introgression from progenitors
as sources of diversity in polyploids. In this study we
used IM analysis [67] in an attempt to make this distinction. As we were not able to obtain credible estimates of
time divergence in our analyses, we could however not
answer this question properly. Nevertheless, the results
provide indications that different populations of the two
species, arenosa and lyrata, are placed in different positions along the gradient of possible polyploid evolution
models ranging from single event polyploidisation with
subsequent reproductive isolation at one end of the gradient to polyploidisation with ongoing gene flow or
recurrent polyploidisation at the other end.
Gene flow from diploids to tetraploid derivatives has
long been acknowledged as relatively common [see e.g.,
[2,3,6] and references therein, [12]]. The question of
gene flow in the opposite direction is more controversial. Stebbins [84] states that interploidal gene flow is
usually unidirectional from diploids to tetraploids for
two reasons: 1) offspring of triploid hybrids are usually
tetraploid or close to it in chromosome number, and 2)
diploids and tetraploids are often so highly incompatible
that triploid offspring cannot be formed at all. However,
studies involving natural triploids in euploid hybrid
swarms show that triploids may produce 1x, 2x, and 3x
gametes, and may therefore contribute to gene flow in
both directions [19,20,85]. Indeed, gene flow from tetraploids to diploids has been observed in some taxa, e.g.
Dactylorhiza maculata (L.) Soó [86] and Betula L [87].
In our study, we did not observe gene flow from tetraploid to diploid arenosa (m = 0; Figure 5), but as the
different ploidal levels are allopatric, we cannot distinguish between genetic/genomic and geographic barriers.
However, for lyrata, with diploids and polyploids in
close proximity, gene flow seems to be bidirectional.

Conclusions
In this study, we looked at the effect of polyploidisation
on interspecific introgression, and interploidal gene flow
using Central European Arabidopsis as a model system.
There was no evidence for interspecific gene flow

between 2x arenosa and 2x lyrata, which can be considered as good biological entities, but some support for
gene flow into 4x lyrata and possibly 4x arenosa. Thus,
whole genome duplication might decrease vulnerability
to interspecific hybridisation and buffer negative effects
of introgression. Interploidal gene flow was detected
from 2x to 4x in both species, and from 4x to 2x in lyrata. For arenosa, the two ploidal levels are allopatric,
and the lower level of gene flow could be the result of
geographic as well as genetic barriers. In lyrata, however, where geographic barriers are limited, gene flow is
bidirectional.
