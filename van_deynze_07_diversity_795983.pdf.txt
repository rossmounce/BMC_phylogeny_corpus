Abstract
Background: Tomato has excellent genetic and genomic resources including a broad set of
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data and high-density genetic maps. In addition, emerging physical
maps and bacterial artificial clone sequence data serve as template to investigate genetic variation
within the cultivated germplasm pool with the goal to manipulate agriculturally important traits.
Unfortunately, the nearly exclusive focus of resource development on interspecific populations for
genetic analyses and diversity studies has left a void in our understanding of genotypic variation
within tomato breeding programs that focus on intra-specific populations. We describe the results
of a study to identify nucleotide variation within tomato breeding germplasm and mapping parents
for a set of conserved single-copy ESTs that are orthologous between tomato and Arabidopsis.
Results: Using a pooled sequencing strategy, 967 tomato transcripts were screened for
polymorphism in 12 tomato lines. Although intron position was conserved, intron lengths were 2fold larger in tomato than in Arabidopsis. A total of 1,487 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 282
insertion/deletions were identified, of which 579 and 206 were polymorphic in breeding
germplasm, respectively. Fresh market and processing germplasm were clearly divergent, as were
Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiformae and Solanum pimpinellifolium, tomato's closest relatives. The
polymorphisms identified serve as marker resources for tomato. The COS is also applicable to
other Solanaceae crops.
Conclusions: The results from this research enabled significant progress towards bridging the gap
between genetic and genomic resources developed for populations derived from wide crosses and
those applicable to intra-specific crosses for breeding in tomato.

Background
Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum, Sl) has rich genetic and
genomic resources including comprehensive databases of
Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs), Bacterial Artificial Chro-

mosome (BAC) libraries, and genetic and comparative
maps which are in the process of being linked to a physical map and eventually the euchromatic genomic
sequence. These resources serve as template to study

genetic variation and to manipulate agricultural traits.
Current genetic maps for tomato include 2,200 Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Cleaved
Amplified Polymorphic Sequences (CAPs), and Simple
Sequence Repeats (SSRs), as well as emerging genetic
resources which include a comparative map with Arabidopsis of over 500 Conserved Orthologous Set (COS)
markers [1,2]. These maps were derived from populations
that were developed between wild relatives (various Solanum species) and cultivated varieties. This approach maximizes genetic variation and has led to the discovery and
introgression of novel alleles for disease resistance [3]and
fruit traits [4,5] into cultivated germplasm. However, the
nearly exclusive focus on wide crosses has left a void in
our knowledge and ability to manipulate other traits of
agricultural importance within cultivated tomato. There is
a lack of molecular markers that detect nucleotide polymorphisms among elite breeding lines. With the exception of genes that were introgressed from wild species, the
majority of the breeding efforts in tomato are derived
from elite-by-elite intra-specific crosses, resulting in consistent improvement for yield and fruit quality [6].
Increasing molecular marker density to facilitate the evaluation and analysis of elite-by-elite breeding populations
is highly desirable.
Given the discrepancy of resources available between
inter-specific and intra-specific crosses, we sought to test
the feasibility of a large-scale screen for identifying polymorphisms within cultivated tomato lines. Previous
examinations of EST databases suggested that Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) could be detected
within tomato EST databases [7,8]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, are highly abundant in plant species. They
can be associated with known genomic sequences and are
bi-allelic [9]. Current technology allows SNPs to be
assayed cost-effectively for applications in breeding programs and genetic studies. Analysis of tomato EST
sequences resulted in only limited information on SNPs
that occurred within cultivated tomato germplasm. In a
previous study, the GenBank EST database was mined for
SNPs which resulted in 101 putative SNPs, 83 of which
were confirmed empirically. Of the 83 validated SNPs,
53% proved useful within cultivated germplasm [8]. A
similar study using an algorithm that considered sequence
context, but not sequence redundancy, identified 764
putative SNPs from a similar dataset from which only
27% (28/103) of the putative SNPs tested could be validated experimentally [7]. The paucity of SNPs within the
ESTs can be attributed to low rate of polymorphism
within gene coding regions of tomato and a limited sampling of genotypes in the databases, and shallow sampling
within each of these genotypes. The current resources are
thus insufficient for breeding studies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/465

Extrapolation of these experimentally defined SNP rates
to the gene and genome level projects a rate of 1 SNP every
4000–8500 bp of coding sequence. Variation in genes has
been shown to be highest in untranslated regions (UTRs)
[9] and within introns in which nucleotide diversity is
more tolerated compared to protein coding regions [10].
Often, intron position is conserved between species [11],
therefore one can leverage the Arabidopsis genome
sequence and orthologous EST sequences from different
species to predict intron position. Thus, a strategy for SNP
discovery is to utilize available EST sequences and design
primers that flank introns or amplify the 3' or 5' UTR from
genomic DNA.
Genomic resources of Arabidopsis can be used to identify
single-copy genes in tomato which in turn can be used as
template to develop DNA markers. A COS is defined as a
set of genes that are conserved throughout plant evolution
in both sequence and copy number [12,13]. Sequences
from a single-copy COS of Arabidopsis can be used as a reference to bridge relationships across genes identified
through ESTs in crops. A COS in tomato (SGN COS I) was
identified by comparing the set of unique gene sequences
in tomato (Sl only) to all translated proteins in the fully
sequenced genome of Arabidopsis [12,14]. Approximately
10% of the 27,000 tomato unigene sequences meet the
defined COS criteria. The SGN COS I set was further
refined to include pepper, potato, eggplant and coffee for
a combined COS (SGN COS II) of 2,869 unigenes [14]
across five species. Southern hybridization revealed that
85% of the COS tested are single-copy sequences in
tomato and 13 other plant species from the Solanaceae,
Asteraceae, Leguminosae, Cucurbitaceae, Rosaceae,
Brassicaceae, Poaceae, and Malvaceae families [12]. Using
different approaches, we identified 2,185 sequences as a
COS between Arabidopsis and tomato, lettuce, sunflower,
soybean and maize, of which 1,704 are represented in
tomato. The parameters for developing the latter dataset
are described at Compositae Genome Project Database
[15] and summarized in Results and Discussion. A COS
database provides a unique resource that can be applied to
marker development for crop improvement and assist in
comparative genomic analyses. In this study, we developed primers flanking predicted introns in the tomato
COS and used these to amplify genomic DNA from several tomato genotypes. Amplified loci were pre-screened
to identify sequence variation using pools of DNA from
diverse genotypes. Loci identified as polymorphic were
subsequently sequenced for 12 genotypes representing
closely related wild relatives, processing tomato germplasm adapted to arid and humid growing conditions,
fresh-market germplasm, and heirloom germplasm. The
resulting sequence data, described in the current paper, is
intended to greatly increase the availability of DNA-based
markers for intra-specific tomato crosses and to character-

ize and manipulate traits important for tomato breeding
populations.

Results and Discussion
Conserved Orthologous Sets
Our goal is to identify and characterize sequence variation
within cultivated tomato in genes that can be used in
genetic analysis, functional genomic studies, and breeding efforts. By focusing on a COS as the basis for marker
discovery, we also intended to develop a sequence
resource representing single-copy loci that can be assayed
reproducibly for genetic analysis within Sl and in other
related species. The challenge to identify a COS with
incomplete EST datasets is to accurately predict singlecopy and orthologous genes that do not represent paralogs. EST databases are highly redundant and unigene sets
of assembled ESTs tend to over-represent the complement
of transcripts. For example, both the Arabidopsis and Rice
EST databases (> 700,000 ESTs) represent about 150,000
unigenes compared to less than 30,000–45,000 predicted
genes with whole genome sequence [16]. The difference
in number is attributable to allelic variation, sequencing
errors, alternative splice forms, and paralogs which can
not be easily addressed in the assembly of transcripts in
the absence of a complete genome and sequence of full
length cDNAs.

Designing a COS involves decisions regarding stringency
of match, order of comparisons, and definitions of
orthologs [14,17]. One approach taken to identify a COS
is to compare unigene sets anchored to single-copy loci in
Arabidopsis and generate reciprocal best matches for pairwise comparisons among several species and Arabidopsis
[14]. With this strategy, only unigenes with a single best
match to Arabidopsis are considered. In tomato, this
approach resulted in a COS of 2,587 sequences (SGN COS
II) which was further used to design primers with homology across species to amplify loci in tomato, pepper,
potato and coffee. Fifteen loci were sequenced across
these species for phylogenetic analysis. The strategy
resulted in a COS that over-represented genes involved in
organelle and chloroplast-associated proteins and DNA/
RNA metabolism, and under-represented cell wall, transcription factors, protein kinases and signal transduction
peptides [14]. We used a more conservative approach to
identify a COS by first identifying single-copy proteins in
Arabidopsis using a "BLASTP all-vs-all" search and then
comparing single-copy Arabidopsis genes to all tomato
ESTs (all S. lycopersicum, Solanum habrochaites and Solanum
pennellii ESTs in GenBank in 2003) using TBLASTX. From
these results, we identified the single best tomato EST
match (usually the longest) to an Arabidopsis sequence
and performed a BLASTN search against the Arabidopsis
genome to verify the hit. The 1,704 tomato ESTs that had
a single hit in Arabidopsis were included in a COS which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/465

we designate UCD COS to distinguish it from the SGN
COS I and SGN COS II. As the number of ESTs used to create the UCD COS was less than that used in the SGN COS
II created later we expect the UCD COS to have less
sequences than SGN COSII. By selecting a single EST for
each contig, incorrect assemblies of paralogs and errors
due to alternative splicing are avoided [15].
For transparency, we cross-referenced all UCD Tomato
COS to the SGN COS II integrated dataset for Solanum
species (Table 1, See Additional file 1,[14]). The 1,704
UCD COS have single hits with a BLAST expect value cutoff of e-20 over 80% of the UCD contig length to 1,611
SGN Unigenes (SGN build Tomato200607,[1]), 857
tomato, 729 potato, 418 pepper and 442 coffee COS II
markers. The UCD COS represents 847 unigenes that are
not in SGN COS II which expands the total COS by 33%
from 2,587 (SGN COS II) to 3,434 unigenes (See Additional file 1). To further investigate the application of the
UCD COS, we evaluated the ability of 96 primers
designed solely for tomato to amplify single-copy
sequences in pepper and eggplant. Primers designed from
loci with COS represented in at least two species and Arabidopsis were more likely to amplify single-copy loci in
eggplant (58 vs. 38%) and pepper (44 vs. 25%) than those
found only in the tomato COS. Only two primers in eggplant and four primers in pepper amplified multiple fragments (data not shown). This verifies the utility of
conserved sequence in species with less genomic
resources. Although the independent approaches to COS
development are similar, we have shown that they verify
each other, yet can be complementary. Nevertheless, both
COS sets empirically yielded genomic resources to characterize putative single-copy conserved genes.
The Size of Introns in Tomato
We designed primers spanning putative introns from
1,112 ESTs in the UCD COS. Greater than one primer set
was designed for some contigs. Intron positions were predicted by comparing tomato COS ESTs to Arabidopsis protein sequence (See Materials and Methods) [18]. With

these primers, 967 loci were amplified in 12 tomato lines
(Table 2). Consequently, forward and reverse sequence
across the resulting amplicons generated 1,241 predicted
introns from 1102 unique contigs (1.33 contigs/locus)
derived from 825 primer sets (Fig. 1). Greater than one
contig/locus resulted when forward and reverse sequences
did not overlap when primers spanned large introns. A
total of 825 of the 967 loci yielded BLAST hits to the original COS EST database. The loci with poor BLAST results
were due to the fact that the primers were located close to
the intron (> 100 bp) resulting in the near lack of
sequence to COS EST coding sequence. BLAST of genomic
sequence data generated from PCR amplicons back to the
corresponding EST allowed intron size to be estimated for
each contig by subtracting the last position (3') of a query
from the corresponding first position (5') of the next
match. Intron positions were accurately predicted greater
than 98% of the time based on differences between
expected and predicted fragment sizes on agarose gels and
sequence analysis. The experimentally estimated intron
size ranged from 63 to 1469 bp. For 310 loci, the intervening region was either too large to form a contig from forward and reverse sequence pairs, or had no hits to ESTs.
By assuming that the 310 pairs that did not assemble into
a contig were comprised of introns that were at least 1,250
bp in length, the predicted average intron length in
tomato would be 543 bp. These estimates are consistent
with the limited information in tomato and suggest a twofold intron size increase in tomato relative to Arabidopsis
[14,19,20]. Furthermore, 263 EST sequences (23.8%)
have more than one intron. A comparison of our intron
sequences to the tomato repeat database (unirepeats.30.20060602,[21]) using BLAST indicated that
there are few defined repeats in these tomato introns.
Only 26 introns had homology to repeats in the database;
one defined as a Long Terminal Repeat, another as DNA/
Mutator and the rest are annotated as unknown repeats.

Diversity of Tomato Introns
Pooling of samples has been used to efficiently screen
BAC libraries for presence of sequences, identify novel
mutations through TILLING, estimate gene frequencies in
populations, and identify variants for specific traits
through bulk-segregant analysis. We extended this idea to
pre-screen DNA sequences for polymorphism in germplasm. This approach is particularly efficient when screening narrow germplasm pools such as those found in the
majority of agricultural crops, especially self-pollinated
species such as tomato, which have gone through genetic
bottlenecks during domestication and selection. Singlestranded conformation polymorphism was suggested as a
tool for screening loci for polymorphism [22]. In our
experience, this approach was only effective for amplicons
smaller than 250 bp (data not shown), which is too small
for efficient marker discovery in species with limited
diversity and SNP density.

To develop an efficient strategy for SNP discovery in crops
with narrow germplasm, we empirically determined that
sequencing pools of four lines can effectively be employed
to screen for polymorphisms (see Material and Methods).
At first, we evaluated the variation among breeding lines
and between species by sequencing across introns of 30
COS loci in 12 select tomato lines (See Table 2). This
approach allowed us to refine the pooling strategy and
establish a base line for polymorphism rate. This initial
sequencing effort yielded 12 (40%) polymorphic loci.
Amplicons for the remaining 937 loci were then
sequenced in pools (See Materials and Methods) for polymorphism discovery. Of these loci, 309 (33%), showed
a potential polymorphism within or between pools
(Table 3). As the goal was to select for loci that were polymorphic in breeding germplasm, only Sl lines were
included in the pools for screening. The pooled strategy
had an accuracy rate of 98%, with 302 loci showing polymorphisms in at least one line when sequenced individually (Table 3, See Additional file 1). Therefore, we reduced

the sequencing efforts three-fold by using the pooled genotypes strategy.
By using a pooling and re-sequencing strategy, we uncovered variation in ten domesticated breeding lines of Sl,
one wild cherry tomato (S. lycopersicum var. cerasiformae,
Slc) and the progenitor species, S. pimpinellifolium (Sp)
across predicted introns in 302 of 967 ESTs (Tables 3 and
4). On average, we assayed a minimum of 985 high quality base pairs per locus (range 62–2262 bp) with an average sequence read length of 619 bp (see Additional file 1).
Overall, 1,487 SNPs were identified, of which 579 from
162 loci were polymorphic in Sl breeding germplasm; 586
between Slc and other lines; and 1,121 between Sp and
other lines (See Additional file 1). Interestingly, 402 SNPs
were present within processing tomato lines and 168
within fresh market lines, but 400 differentiated the
processing from fresh market classes indicating diversity
among gene pools (Table 4, See Additional file 1). In the
same samples, 282 indels were also detected in 153 contigs with 206 indels from 122 loci in breeding germplasm;
154 between Slc and other lines; and 152 between Sp and

other lines. Fresh market and processing tomatoes differed by 45 indels (Table 2, See Additional file 1). Only 13
loci had indels and no SNPs. Polymorphisms due to SNPs
or indels range from 8 to 24% between any two breeding
lines (See Additional file 1). SSR signatures (2 to 4 nucleotide repeats) were identified in 44 loci of which 12 were
polymorphic and 21 unique to the indel and SNP databases (See Additional file 1). Ten SSRs were scored as
indels as well. Overall, 967 EST loci have sequence information within introns, of which 302 are polymorphic. All
sequences are available at GenBank (ET165605 to
ET166001)[23].
Initial work [8] showed that SNP frequency is approximately 1/8500 bp when surveying coding sequence
(ESTs) between TA496 and Rio Grande. The work was
based on identifying SNPs between only two sequenced
genotypes, and therefore is an underestimate of the variation across a larger set of lines. Within the 10 Sl breeding
lines in the current project, 16.8% (162 of the 967 loci
tested, See Additional file 1) of the loci were polymorphic
with a SNP frequency of 1/1647 bp, a 5.2 fold increase
over coding sequence reported [8]. Although, these datasets are not directly comparable due to both the number
and actual lines and loci being compared, they are in line
with those reported in the literature. Previous studies on a
limited number of loci have reported a 2.7 to 5.3 fold
[8,14,24] increase in SNP frequency in tomato introns vs.
exons.

The results of our intron sequencing suggest that significant sequence diversity remains to be discovered in
domesticated germplasm of tomato. These results appear
to be corroborated by several studies in progress. Sequencing 48 COS for a set of 31 landrace Sl lines collected from
three centers of diversity, found an average SNP rate of 1/
149 bp across introns and exons with 60% of the SNPs
having an allele frequency below 10% [25]. A second
recent report showed that by randomly designing primers
across ESTs (including exons, introns and untranslated
regions) and sequencing 435 amplicons across 8 inbred
lines, polymorphism ranged from 3% to 24% among Sl
inbred lines to 63% between Sl inbred lines and S. pennellii, acc. LA716 [26]. The frequency of SNPs ranged from
10% of loci in processing lines, 11% in fresh market lines
and 14% in cherry tomatoes (Slc). The frequency of minor
alleles (allele with lowest frequency in germplasm surveyed) in tomato breeding germplasm was below 10% for
15/20 SNPs. The average frequency of minor alleles
(SNPs) in our study was 18% across all the germplasm
tested and 27% for breeding germplasm (See Additional
file 1). The allele frequencies in our study may be higher
as we pre-selected loci to be polymorphic in our germplasm and because our sampling was limited. SNPs with
moderate allele frequencies (above 15%) are particularly
useful as they are informative in relevant germplasm for
breeding. Conversely, rare alleles can be particularly interesting if linked or are functional alleles for rare phenotypes for genetic studies and crop improvement.
Although, we chose to sequence introns of ESTs from a
COS, the frequency of polymorphisms is in a similar
range as other reports [8,14,24]. It is not clear that COS
genes would have less recombination than genes not conserved among species, especially in introns. Increasing the
number and diversity of domesticated genotypes
sequenced may increase the discovery of polymorphisms
that can be applied to Sl breeding populations. The genotypes we screened (Table 2) represent genetic stocks and
lines used in commercial processing and fresh market
hybrids across the United States, Europe and Brazil.
In our data set, any given breeding line accounted for 11.3
to 23.8% of the polymorphism with 3–4 SNPs/locus in
polymorphic loci. Considering that we prescreened 967
loci and sequenced 308 polymorphic loci (32%), we estimate that 3.8 to 7.9% of all loci differ in elite-by-elite
crosses with the set of lines sampled. Sp was polymorphic
in 91% of loci sequenced with a SNP frequency of 1/851
bp (Table 4, See Additional file 1). As only loci that were
polymorphic in breeding lines were sequenced, this frequency for Sp is likely biased. Our estimate of polymorphism between Sp and Sl from the random set of 30 loci
sequenced for all lines is 73%. As we only sampled two
U.S. fresh market lines, our estimates for this class may
have also been biased. By cross-referencing our dataset to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/465

current resources in the Asterid family, including the
updated tomato unigenes and SGN COSII dataset [1,14],
we have expanded the available COS in Solanaceae; provided intron sequence associated with ESTs; and diversity
information relevant to loci that can form a core marker
set for translational genomics research in the Solanaceae.
Of the 967 loci screened, 122 including 29 SNP, 22 Indel,
and 6 SSR loci have been mapped [1] (Table 1, See Additional file 1); the remaining loci are currently being
mapped. These results further highlight that Sl has
evolved considerably from Sp and the dilemma of application of resources built around wide crosses to elite-byelite crosses. Our dataset represents the most in depth
study of variation in domesticated tomato and one of its
closest progenitor species to-date.

Conclusion
Leveraging of genomic tools across species boundaries to
assay variation in relevant germplasm is key to the application of these resources for crop improvement and comparative genomics. In species with limited variation due to
bottlenecks from domestication and subsequent breeding, identifying sufficient polymorphism for genetic studies will require that sequence data cover more varieties
and both coding and non-coding sequences. We have provided sequence data for 302 loci in 12 accessions relevant
to breeding and genetic mapping in tomato These
resources should enable SNP genotyping assays for highthroughput screening of germplasm for taxonomic,
genetic mapping, functional analysis and breeding.

Methods
Plant materials
The tomato lines and species screened for this study were
chosen based on their relevance to both tomato genetic
research and to breeding programs. Both fresh market and
processing germplasm are represented, with lines chosen
to represent a diversity of environmental adaptations,
market classes, parents of mapping populations, and
genomic sequencing efforts. Inbred tomato lines were
selected from the University of Florida and the University
of North Carolina fresh market breeding programs, with
selected lines of commercial interest (Table 2). Six
processing lines were chosen to represent adaptation to
arid (Sun1642 and M82) and humid environments
(OH8245, OH88119, OH9242, and H1706); to genetic
mapping (e.g. M82): and to the tomato genome sequencing project (H1706). The processing germplasm was also
chosen, based on studies with molecular markers, to span
sub-populations within the humid adapted germplasm
(D. Francis, unpublished). Several of the processing lines
are currently used as parents of hybrid varieties grown in
the U.S., Brazil, and Europe. Accessions of the heirloom
variety San Marzano, S. lycopersicum var. cerasiformae and
a progenitor species, S. pimpinellifolium (Table 2) were

selected to represent ancient varieties and closely related
progenitor species. Thus the germplasm and specific polymorphisms are expected to be relevant to multiple
genetic and plant improvement applications. All accessions represent inbred lines, thus should be homozygous
for the majority of the loci.
Defining intron position
Intron positions were predicted by comparing COS ESTs
to the Arabidopsis protein database[18] which also defines
the coordinates for intron positions in Arabidopsis. We
used GenBank Parser [27] to extract of intron/exon information from Arabidopsis GenBank files and compile a protein dataset with known intron/exon positions.
Individual COS ESTs were then queried using BLASTX
against the protein database. Predicted intron positions in
tomato ESTs, the best Arabidopsis hit and intron size in
Arabidopsis are displayed graphically, using an Extended
Mode add-on to the Contig Viewer Program [28].
Primer design and screening
A database was established representing a COS of 1,704
tomato unigenes (1612 Sl, 29 S. habrochaites and 63 S.
pennellii) from 113,932 ESTs [15]. From these, a single
and longest EST was chosen to design primers. Using the
tools developed for Compositae Genome database, the
position of introns was first estimated using the procedures above. A set of 1,268 primers were designed to
amplify across estimated intron sites with primers 50–100
bp from the intron. Amplification of primers was tested
on a single line, M82.

0.02" which translates to Phred 17 score. [29]. Assembly
was achieved with Phrap/Consed and options were set at
" -retainduplicates and -forcelevel 5". These options were
optimized to give the best trim and assembly parameters
for calling SNPs. Stringent trim parameters are favored in
this case to minimize the high number of false SNPs associated with poor sequence on the ends. Amplicon sizes
were estimated and included in Additional file 1, Tables
S2 and S3. To calculate a more accurate estimate than
from gel electrophoresis, the sequenced contig(s) size was
used as a minimum. When greater than one contig per
locus was obtained as a result of unpredictably large
introns, the forward and reverse contig sizes were added.
SNPs were first identified semi-manually using Polyphred
as heterozygotes within pools or homozygous differences
among pools. The line, M82, was used as reference to
screen amplicons for single copy number. Amplicons with
putative SNPs were then amplified in the individual 12
lines (Table 2) and sequenced as described above. Only
SNPs showing both homozygous alleles were called. Data
was extracted from Polyphred using custom scripts ([30]
See Additional file 1). Similarly, data for indels were
extracted from Polyphred. SSRs (di to tetra repeats) were
extracted from all sequenced loci for M82, our reference
line, and the various genotypes and reported for all
sequenced individuals. The sequence database was analyzed for all known repeats for tomato [1]. All loci were
cross-referenced to the SGN COSII for tomato, pepper,
potato and coffee and associated maps [14].

List of abbreviations
Primers that successfully amplified a product were tested
for polymorphism using sequencing in a series of three
pools representing different degrees of diversity. The
design has complementary pools representing each class
(fresh market, processing, other) with one diverse line
from an alternate class to maximize the chance of detecting a polymorphism within or among pools. Using a
series of empirical tests with lines with known SNPs in
ratios of 1:7, 1:5, 1:3 and 1:1, we determined that an
unknown polymorphism can be reliably detected with
sequencing with a 1:3 dilution. Pool 1 consisted of O
9242, FL7600, Ha7998, PI114490; Pool 2 included M82,
O 8245, O 88119, NC84173 and; Pool 3 consisted of
Sun1642, Heinz1706, O 9242, FL7600 (Table 2). DNA
was extracted from each line and was combined in equimolar concentrations.

BAC: bacterial artificial chromosome
COS: conserved orthologous set
EST: expressed sequence tag
Indel: insertion/deletion
Sl: Solanum lycopersicum
Slc: Solanum lycopersicum var cerasiformae
SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism

SSR: simple sequence repeat

For all sequencing reactions, forward and reverse primers
were tailed with M13 sequences and sequenced using
standard protocols for Sanger sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in forward and reverse directions
using a ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Trace files were trimmed with Phred options -trim_cutoff
