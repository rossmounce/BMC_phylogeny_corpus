Abstract
Background: Lamivudine is an oral nucleoside analogue widely used for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis B. The main limitation of lamivudine use is the selection of resistant mutations that increases with
time of utilization. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates have been classified into eight genotypes (A to H) with
distinct geographical distributions. HBV genotypes may also influence pathogenic properties and
therapeutic features. Here, we analyzed the HBV genotype distribution and the nature and frequency of
lamivudine resistant mutations among 36 patients submitted to lamivudine treatment for 12 to 84 months.
Results: Half of the patients were homosexual men. Only 4/36 (11%) patients were HBV DNA negative.
As expected for a Brazilian group, genotypes A (24/32 positive individuals, 75%), D (3/32, 9.3%) and F (1/
32, 3%) were present. One sample was from genotype C, which is a genotype rarely found in Brazil. Three
samples were from genotype G, which had not been previously detected in Brazil. Lamivudine resistance
mutations were identified in 20/32 (62%) HBV DNA positive samples. Mean HBV loads of patients with
and without lamivudine resistance mutations were not very different (2.7 × 107 and 6.9 × 107 copies/mL,
respectively). Fifteen patients showed the L180M/M204V lamivudine resistant double mutation. The triple
mutant rt173V/180M/204V, which acts as a vaccine escape mutant, was found in two individuals. The three
isolates of genotype G were entirely sequenced. All three showed the double mutation L180M/M204V and
displayed a large genetic divergence when compared with other full-length genotype G isolates.
Conclusion: A high (55%) proportion of patients submitted to long term lamivudine therapy displayed
resistant mutations, with elevated viral load. The potential of transmission of such HBV mutants should be
monitored. The identification of genotypes C and G, rarely detected in South America, seems to indicate
a genotype distribution different to that observed in non treated patients. Disparities in routes of
transmission (genotype G seems to be linked to homosexual behavior) and in pathogenic properties
(genotype C is very aggressive) among HBV genotypes may explain the presence of rare genotypes in the
present work.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an etiological agent of acute
and chronic liver disease. Despite the introduction of HBV
vaccination programs in the last decade, hepatitis B
remains a largely disseminated disease, with an estimated
350 million people chronically infected around the
world, and over 2 billion people who have already been
infected with the virus. It is estimated that between 1 and
2 million people die annually as a consequence of the
infection [1].
Based on sequence divergence in the entire genome
exceeding 8%, HBV is classified into eight genotypes (A to
H) (see [2-4] for reviews) that are related to their geographical origin. Most genotypes have been recently
divided into subgenotypes with distinct virological and
epidemiological properties. In addition, recombination
among HBV genotypes increases the variability of HBV
[5]. Genotype A is present in Europe, India, Africa and
Americas. Genotype A is subdivided into three subgroups
or subgenotypes (Aa/A1, Ae/A2 and A3). Isolates belonging to subgroup Aa/A1 have been identified in populations and descendents of African countries [6,7].
Subgenotype Ae/A2 has a European origin, whereas subgenotype A3 has been identified in Central and West Africa
[8,9]. Genotypes B and C are predominant in China,
Japan and Southeast Asia. Genotype D is widespread, predominating in the Mediterranean area and in the Middle
East region. Genotype E appears to derive from West
Africa. Genotype F is found in the aboriginal populations
of the Central and South America. Genotype H has been
described in Mexico and Central America [5,10]. Genotype G has been first identified in France and the United
States [4], and recently detected in Mexico [11]. It seems
that genotype G prevails in restricted areas in the world,
possibly disseminating via particular routes of transmission [12]. Genotype G has been found in a relatively high
frequency (28%) in Mexican men who have sex with men
[13]. Genotype G is usually coinfected with genotype A
[12] or, less frequently, with genotype H [13]. HBV genotype G is distinct from the genomes of the other seven
genotypes in that it possesses a 36-nt insertion at the 5'
end of the core (C) gene and translational stop codons at
positions 2 and 28 in the pre-C region, preventing HBeAg
synthesis [4]. Despite these stop codons, patients infected
with genotype G have been found positive for hepatitis B
e antigen (HBeAg) [14]. This could be explained by the
fact that genotype G is commonly found in coinfection
with genotype A. However, at least one case of monoinfection with genotype G alone has been described [15]. This
could suggest that HBeAg is dispensable for viral replication. When searched for, genotype G has not been identified in several countries, and seems to be an extremely rare
genotype in Japan [16].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/11

In Brazil, genotypes A, D and F are the most prevalent
[6,17,18]. In previous studies conducted in the general
Brazilian- or in the Afro-Brazilian population, subgenotype A1 was the most frequent subgenotype [6,19].
Lamivudine is an oral nucleoside analogue inhibiting the
reverse transcriptase activity of HIV and HBV [20]. This
drug is widely used in the treatment of hepatitis B and as
part of the treatment of HIV infection. A period of one
year of therapy in HBeAg positive patients has been associated with HBeAg loss in 17–33% of patients and HBeAg
seroconversion rates of 16–18% [21]. HBeAg seroconversion is the result of a profound suppression of viral replication, since it has only been found in patients with a
reduction in HBV DNA to <104 copies/mL [21,22]. The
major limitation in the use of lamivudine is the selection
of resistant mutations that may arise and accumulate during therapy. These mutations usually affect the YMDD
motif located in the C domain of the HBV reverse transcriptase (rt), by replacement of a methionine residue at
position 204 to either valine (rtM204V, occidental population) or isoleucine (rtM204I, oriental population) [2124]. The proportion of patients in whom YMDD variants
are detectable increases with time on lamivudine therapy,
rising from around 15–25% after one year of treatment to
70% by four years [21,25]. In addition, a second lamivudine resistance mutation (rtL180M), located in the B
domain of rt, has been identified [26]. This second mutation is associated with prolonged lamivudine treatment.
Such double mutations have notably been reported in
studies performed with HIV-HBV co-infected patients
[27,28]. More than 90% of the HIV-HBV co-infected
patients under lamivudine treatment display the double
resistant mutation rtL180M/rtM204V [28].
Hepatitis B acute exacerbation may occur after the appearance of YMDD mutants [29], accompanied by a rapid
increase of viral load and serum aminotransferase levels
[21]. Such exacerbations appear to be more severe than
those occurring during the natural course of wild type
HBV chronic infection [21]. At present, management of
patients with lamivudine mutations rests on addition or
replacement with other antiviral agents as adefovir
dipivoxil or entecavir, which may effectively suppress the
YMDD mutants [23,30,31].
The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of HBV DNA and viral load variations in patients
receiving lamivudine for a long period for HBV treatment,
to characterize HBV genotypes, and to determine the frequency and nature of lamivudine resistance mutations.
Furthermore the entire nucleotide sequences of three genotype G isolates recovered from this work were determined.

Results
Serological patterns and distribution of HBV genotypes
Among 36 HBsAg positive patients under long-term lamivudine treatment, only four (two male and two female)
were tested negative for HBV DNA by nested PCR. All four
were HIV negative, one was HBeAg positive and three

were anti-HBe positive (Table 1). Thirteen patients, all
men, were co-infected with HIV, 10 of them belonging to
risk groups associated with sexual transmission (homosexual or bisexual).

The genotype/subgenotype distribution of the HBV isolates showed a predominance of genotype A, subgenotype
A1 (Table 1). Noteworthy, three isolates belonged to genotype G, a genotype which had never been described in
Brazil. Genotypes A2, C, D and F were also identified.
The deduced amino acid sequences of the HBV DNA
polymerase demonstrated that 20/32 (62%) isolates had
lamivudine resistance mutations. The proportion of
mutants varied from 60% to 100%, depending on the
genotype, with the exception of genotype D, for which
none of the three isolates was mutated. Fifteen patients
showed the well-known double rtL180M/rtM204V mutation. Two others (03-hgg and 08-hgg) displayed a third
mutation (rtV173L) related to lamivudine resistance [32].
At last, three patients displayed a single (rtM204I, patient
05-hac) or double (rtL180I/rtM204I, 11-hgg and 01ufmt) mutation leading to the YIDD motif.
Patients infected with isolates showing lamivudine resistance mutations had HBV loads varying from 8 × 104 to 2
× 108 copies/mL (mean 2.9 × 107, median 5 × 106). Interestingly, values not very different (7 × 105 to 4 × 108 copies/mL [mean 6.9 × 107, median 4.5 × 106]) were found in
treated patients without mutations. Median values of
virus load were significantly higher in patients with
HBeAg (2 × 107copies/mL) than in patients with anti-HBe
antibodies (1 × 106 copies/mL) (p < 0.05).

genomic region. Digestion of PCR products derived from
sample 09-hgg with EcoRI restriction endonuclease (Fig.
1A, lane 3) showed the presence of two HBV populations,
one without EcoRI site (pattern predicted for genotype G,
shown in lane 1) and the other with one EcoRI site (pattern deduced for most HBV genotype A isolates, shown in
lane 2). A similar experiment performed with BamHI
restriction enzyme (Fig. 1B) suggested a coinfection of
patient 09-hgg with three HBV isolates, including G and
A2. Furthermore, restriction digests of the two other HBV/
G isolates from this study (05-hgg and 06-hac) showed
the presence of additional, faint DNA bands, not explainable by incomplete digestion, but suggesting the occurrence of coinfection with low titers of HBV genotypes
other than G. Such bands were not observed with isolates
not belonging to genotype G.
Complete nucleotide sequences of the three HBV/G isolates (09-hgg, 05-hgg and 06-hac) were determined. All
three had 3248 bp and showed a 36-nt insertion at the 5'
end of the C gene, a 3-nt deletion in the pre-S1 region, and
stop codons at positions 2 and 28 of the pre-core region,
i.e. all features characteristics of genotype G [4]. Phylogenetic trees based on the complete genome (Fig. 2) and on

Failure to lamivudine treatment (phenotypic resistance)
was evaluated by medical staff based in rapid increase of
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, sometimes
accompanied by detection of a rebound of HBV load.
There was a good correlation between phenotypic resistance and detection of lamivudine mutations. Indeed, 20/
24 (83%) patients showing phenotypic resistance displayed lamivudine resistant mutations, whereas 8/8
(100%) who had no medical signs did not (Table 1).
Complete sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of
genotype G isolates
As mentioned above, 3/36 patients were infected with the
rare HBV genotype G (HBV/G). All three were men who
reported sexual relationships with men. Two of them were
co-infected with HIV and were HBeAg positive: patient 09hgg had very high levels of HBeAg, and was negative for
anti-HBe, whereas patient 05-hgg had low levels of HBeAg
and anti-HBe. The third patient (06-hac) was anti-HBe
positive (Table 1).

HBV/G has been commonly found in patients coinfected
with an HBV isolate belonging to genotype A [12].
Whether the three HBV/G isolates from this study were
associated with an HBV isolate belonging to another genotype was evaluated by PCR-RFLP analysis of the pre-S/S

entire pre-S/S, pre-core/core and X (not shown) regions
confirmed the classification of isolates 09-hgg, 05-hgg and
06-hac into genotype G. It was observed that the three Brazilian G (HBV/G-Br) isolates were divergent between
them and from those described before. HBV/G-Br isolates
had a mean sequence divergence (1.9 ± 0.2%) higher than
that observed between the eight previously described
HBV/G isolates from other geographic regions (0.4 ±
0.1%). Such a divergence was even higher (2.3 ± 0.2%)
when pre-S/S region alone was analyzed. Genotypes F and
H were the genotypes (other than G) most distant from
the HBV/G-Br isolates (Table 2).

Deduced amino acid sequences of pre-S1 region were well
conserved among all G isolates. The three G isolates
belonged to subtype adw2 (aminoacid residues K122, P127
and K160). Pre-S2 and S regions of isolates 06-hac and 09hgg displayed several aminoacid variations that are
present in the sequence consensus of genotypes H and F,
whereas isolate 05-hgg showed aminoacid variations
related to genotype A (Table 3). Variations T49 (pre-S2)
and M195 (S) were observed in all three HBV/G-Br. The
last one resulted from the lamivudine resistance mutation
at rtL180M position.

Discussion
Lamivudine resistance is due to aminoacid substitutions
in the YMDD motif of the rt domain of the HBV polymerase. The resistance occurs by replacement of a methionine
residue at position rt204 by either valine (rtM204V) or
isoleucine (rtM204I), accompanied or not by a substitution at position rt180 [33] and more rarely by a substitution at position rt173 [32,34]. The occurrence of
mutations rtL180M and rtV173L has been associated with
prolonged lamivudine treatment [26,35]. Single mutants
in the YMDD motif (rtM204V/I) replicate substantially
more slowly in vitro than the wild type. Mutations at positions rt180 and rt173 may thus act as compensatory
changes which partially restore the replication fitness of
the virus. The triple mutation rtV173L/rtL180M/
rtM204V/I results in concomitant amino acid substitutions E164D and I195M in the small S protein. It has been
shown that this triple mutant has a reduced in vitro affinity
to anti-HBs antibodies, similar to what occurs with the
hepatitis B vaccine escape mutant G145R [32,35].
Here, most patients under prolonged lamivudine treatment displayed HBV DNA in serum. Lamivudine resistant
mutations were observed in 67% of the cases, while 33%
did not display recognized resistance mutations. In a previous study, performed with HIV infected patients with
occult HBV infection (HBsAg negative), the group of
patients without resistance mutations had a lower mean
viral load than patients with resistance mutations [36].
However, in the present study, where all patients were
HBsAg positive, no significant viral load differences were
observed between those with and without lamivudine
resistance mutations. In another study involving HBsAg
positive, HIV infected patients, almost 50% who were
HBV DNA positive did not display lamivudine resistance
mutations. Furthermore, high HBV load was observed in
at least one of these patients [34]. More detailed investigations of these patients, including adherence to treatment
and eventual presence of quasispecies with resistant
strains as minor populations, should be conducted.
Understanding the circumstances and the molecular
mechanisms leading to the circulation in relative high titers of HBV isolates with or without lamivudine resistance

HBV/G could be found in monoinfections. Strong evidence of HBV/G monoinfection was obtained in 2006 by
Chudy and colleagues [15]. HBV/G replication increased
markedly when coinfected with HBV isolates from other
genotypes [39]. The dynamics of co-infection of HBV/G
with other genotypes would indicate that coinfection with
genotype A is much more advantageous for enhanced replication than that occurring with other genotypes, including genotype C. Indeed, coinfection with HBV/A is
frequent in individuals infected with HBV/G [12,40].
Here, the three HBV/G infected patients displayed different HBeAg/anti-HBe status. Two were HBeAg positive.
One of them (09-hgg) was strongly positive while the
other (05-hgg) has low titres of both HBeAg, and anti-HBe
antibodies. The third sample was anti-HBe positive.
Despite this variability, all three HBV/G samples seem to
be cases of coinfection. As stated before [39], monoinfections should produce low serum HBV DNA titers, almost
at the limit of detection. Here it was possible to amplify
complete HBV/G genomes, that could hardly be done in
the case of HBV/G monoinfection. HBV/G isolates of the
present work displayed lamivudine mutations. To determine if there exists an association between Brazilian HBV/
G and lamivudine mutations, large surveys should be conducted among men who have sex with men.

Recent studies have suggested that the rate of lamivudine
resistance was higher in patients infected with HBV genotype A than in those with genotype D [37,38]. Here it was
not possible to correlate lamivudine resistant mutations
and genotype. Large surveys should be conducted to clarify the role of HBV genotype in the response of treatment.
The three HBV/G isolates described here displayed lamivudine resistance mutations. In previous studies, no particular association has been made between HBV/G and
lamivudine resistance. HBV/G was discovered in San Francisco [4], where a large community of homosexual men
lives. In a recent study conducted in Mexico, HBV/G was
found exclusively in men who have sex with men [13].
Here, the three HBV/G isolates infected homosexual men.
This supports the hypothesis of a major dissemination of
HBV/G isolates in homosexual men.
HBV/G displays two stop codons in the precore region,
abolishing HBeAg synthesis [4]. Despite this, a large proportion of patients infected with HBV/G are positive for
HBeAg. The reason is that HBV/G is usually found in coinfection with HBV isolates from other genotypes, mainly
genotype A [12]. Until recently, it was uncertain whether

The three HBV/G isolates characterized here had mean
sequence variations (1.9 ± 0.2%) higher than those (0.4 ±
0.1%) observed between HBV/G isolates from other geographic regions. Phylogenetic trees based on pre-S/S, precore/core and X regions confirmed the classification of
isolates 09-hgg, 05-hgg and 06-hac into genotype G. In
the case of isolate 05-hgg, the presence of amino acids
characteristics of genotype A in pre-S2 and S regions does
not allow excluding the occurrence of a recombination
event. Nucleotide sequencing of individual clones will be
necessary to test this hypothesis.

Conclusion
A high proportion (88%) of long term lamivudine treated
patients were HBV DNA positive. Most samples displayed
recognized lamivudine resistant mutations with viral
loads sufficiently high to be transmissible. Genotypes C
and G, rarely or never detected before in South America,
were identified. Disparities in routes of transmission (genotype G seems to be linked to homosexual behavior) and
in pathogenic properties (genotype C is more aggressive
than others) might explain the presence of these genotypes in the population studied. All three HBV/G isolates
detected here displayed lamivudine mutations and
showed large genetic variations between them. Large surveys conducted in the population of men who have sex

with men should be useful to better characterize HBV genotype G.

Methods
Patients and serological studies
The study group consisted of 36 HBV chronically infected,
ambulatory patients (29 male, seven female, mean age, 47
years) who were submitted to long-term (12 to 84
months, mean 39, median 35 months) lamivudine treatment at three public Brazilian hospitals (Gaffrée e Guinle
hospital and Alceu Carneiro hospital, Rio de Janeiro;
Infectious Diseases Ambulatory, Federal University, Cuiabá, Mato Grosso) between 2002 and 2004. All the patients
were HBsAg positive and anti-HBc positive. The protocol
used was approved by the Fiocruz Ethical Committee.
Thirteen patients were anti-HIV-1 positive by conventional serological tests, and lamivudine was administered
in these patients as part of antiretroviral treatment. The 36
patients belonged to different risk groups for HBV and
HIV infections. Twenty (56%) were homosexual or bisexual men. Six belonged to the blood transfusion risk group
and three were infected through vertical transmission. No
risk group was identified for seven patients.

All HIV positive patients demonstrated clinical signs of
lamivudine resistance, evaluated by medical staff. HBV

monoinfected patients were selected randomly. Serum
samples from all patients were initially tested for antiHBc, HBsAg and anti-HBs in the hospitals. These samples
were not available, and new blood samples were collected, retested for the presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Hepanostika Uniform Organon Teknika B.V., Boxtel, Holland) and further
used for genomic studies. Most HBsAg positive samples
were submitted to HBeAg and anti-HBe antibodies detection. This was performed by using the commercially
Axsym system (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL).
DNA extraction and conditions of PCR assays
DNA was extracted from serum samples using phenol/
chloroform after treatment of 250 μL of serum with 0.5
mg/mL of proteinase K in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl and
0.25% SDS for 4 hours at 37°C as reported previously
[17]. After precipitation with ethanol, the pellet was dried
and resuspended in 30 μL of distilled water. Semi-nested
and nested PCR assays were performed. PCR primers are
shown in Table 4. The first round of amplification was
performed with 1 μL of extracted DNA and one unit of
Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in a
final volume of 25 μL. After an initial DNA denaturation
for 3 min at 94°C, amplification was for 35 cycles at 94°C
for 40 sec, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min 30 sec, followed by a final elongation for 7 min at 72°C. The second
round was performed with 1 μL of first round PCR product in a final volume of 50 μL under the following parameters: 95°C for 30 sec, 52°C for 40 sec, 72°C for 2 min for
30 cycles, followed by a final elongation for 7 min at
72°C. Ten microliters of amplification products were
loaded on agarose gels, electrophoresed, stained with bromide and visualized under UV light.
Quantification of HBV DNA
HBV DNAs were quantified by real-time using the TaqMan technology, according to [41] with some modifications. A panel of reference sera was used for
quantification. This panel, kindly supplied by Dr. Ikuta
(Simbios biotecnologia, Lutherian University, Canoas,
RS, Brazil), has been calibrated against commercially
available panels (Optiquant HBV viral DNA, Acrometrix),
and contained known numbers of HBV DNA molecules.
Amplification assays were performed in a final volume of
25 μL of TaqMan universal MasterMix (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA) containing 2 μL of extracted DNA,
1 μM of each sense (5'-GGACCCCTGCTC GTGTTACA-3'
nt 184–203) and antisense (5'-AGAGAAGTCCACCMCGAGTCTAGA-3', nt 273–249) primers, as well as 0.3 μM
of probe (5'-FAM-TGTTGACAARAATCCT CACAATACCRCAGA-TAMRA-3', nt 218–247). After initial incubation steps of 2 min at 50°C and 10 min at 95°C, the PCR
cycling program consisted of 50 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and
60 s at 60°C. Reactions were performed in a 7700 SDS sys-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/11

tem (Applied BioSystems). The assay has a limit of detection of 10 copies/reaction, i.e. 100 copies/mL of serum.
Nucleotide Sequencing
PCR products of the partial S genomic region were directly
sequenced. These products were obtained by semi-nested
PCR amplification using primers PS1, S2 and S22 in the
first round and PS4, S2 and S22 in the second round
(Table 4). Complete nucleotide sequences of three genotype G isolates were determined after amplification by
using primers shown in Table 4. Amplification products
(50 μL) were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels, DNA
bands were extracted, and nucleotide sequences were
determined using the BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) and the same primers used for PCR amplification. Sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI373
automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences determined in this work have been
deposited in the GenBank database under the accession
numbers EF464070 to EF464099. Bioinformatics analysis
of the sequences was performed applying the University
of Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group package. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were drawn and rearranged
using the Mega program version 3 [42]. Representative
sequences of each HBV genotype/subgenotype were
selected after alignment of 884 full-length (>3100 nt)
sequences [43].
Genotyping by PCR-RFLP
A previously published PCR-RFLP genotyping method
[6,19], based upon pre-S/S genomic region, was used to
assess HBV coinfections with genotype G and other isolates. Required semi-nested PCR products were obtained
with the use of primers PS1, S2 and S22 in the first round
and PS1 and SR in the second round (Table 4).
