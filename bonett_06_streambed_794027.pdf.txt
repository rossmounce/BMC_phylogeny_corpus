Abstract
Background: Habitat variation strongly influences the evolution of developmentally flexible traits,
and may drive speciation and diversification. The plethodontid salamander Eurycea tynerensis is
endemic to the geologically diverse Ozark Plateau of south-central North America, and comprises
both strictly aquatic paedomorphic populations (achieving reproductive maturity while remaining
in the larval form) and more terrestrial metamorphic populations. The switch between
developmental modes has occurred many times, but populations typically exhibit a single life history
mode. This unique system offers an opportunity to study the specific ecological circumstances
under which alternate developmental and life history modes evolve. We use phylogenetic
independent contrasts to test for relationships between a key microhabitat feature (streambed
sediment) and this major life history polymorphism.
Results: We find streambed microstructure (sediment particle size, type and degree of sorting) to
be highly correlated with life-history mode. Eurycea tynerensis is paedomorphic in streams
containing large chert gravel, but metamorphoses in nearby streams containing poorly sorted,
clastic material such as sandstone or siltstone.
Conclusion: Deposits of large chert gravel create loosely associated streambeds, which provide
access to subsurface water during dry summer months. Conversely, streambeds composed of
more densely packed sandstone and siltstone sediments leave no subterranean refuge when surface
water dries, presumably necessitating metamorphosis and use of terrestrial habitats. This
represents a clear example of the relationship between microhabitat structure and evolution of a
major developmental and life history trait, and has broad implications for the role of localized
ecological conditions on larger-scale evolutionary processes.

Background
The ability to express alternate phenotypes enables populations to colonize and persist in variable environments
[1-4]. However, the role of phenotypic plasticity in the
evolution of traits, and subsequent diversification and
speciation, is understood in relatively few instances [4].

Populations experiencing a given environmental regime
across generations may undergo directional selection,
from a highly plastic trait to a single condition [4-6], thus
initiating phenotypic divergence among populations that
occupy different environments. Furthermore, selection
acting on reproductive traits may lead to reproductive isoPage 1 of 12

lation among populations. Especially for organisms with
complex life cycles, local selection involving major developmental shifts can produce rapid changes in ecology,
morphology and life history among populations, and
may hasten divergence and speciation [7-9].
Amphibians exhibit diverse life history strategies that enable them to exploit both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems
successfully [10-13]. Most amphibians have a free-living
aquatic larval stage followed by metamorphosis into a
more terrestrial adult form [10-13]. One deviation from
this pathway, exhibited by some salamanders, is paedomorphosis, whereby individuals reach adulthood while
maintaining many larval structures (particularly gills) and
an aquatic lifestyle [10,14]. In some groups of salamanders the switch between paedomorphosis and metamorphosis can be highly labile, and a multitude of ecological
and evolutionary trade-offs accompany each strategy
[extensively reviewed in [15-17]]. The most important
advantage of metamorphosis is the ability to leave ephemeral aquatic habitats [11,15,18,19], and in some situations metamorphosis could potentially increase gene flow
between otherwise isolated aquatic systems [20]. In permanently aquatic environments, especially those of high
quality, paedomorphosis may be optimal [11,15,21-24].
Also, paedomorphs remain in their breeding habitat, limiting mortality from breeding migrations and providing
the chronological advantage of early arrival [23,25]. In
regions where peripheral habitats are extremely harsh or
dry, remaining in the aquatic environment may be the
only viable strategy [11,26-28].
The Ozark Plateau of south-central North America is a
geologically diverse highland with many endemic species
[29-31]. Watercourses carve through the plateau at several
distinct stratigraphic levels, causing the deposition of different types of sediment among streams [32]. Silurian/
Ordovician chert strata are very hard and deposit as
loosely associated gravel in many western Ozark streams,
whereas in most other localities stream sediment is composed of densely packed clastic sediments such as sandstone and siltstone. The interstitial spaces within chert
gravel beds harbour a diverse fauna, including a variety of
arthropods, small fishes, and salamanders. Streambed
microstructure is critical for small aquatic organisms in
these communities, because it provides pathways to
underground water during harsh dry summer conditions,
when the surface can dry completely [29,33-35].
The plethodontid salamander Eurycea tynerensis is
restricted to the Ozark Plateau, and, until very recently,
was considered to be a strictly paedomorphic species, with
a distribution closely associated with Silurian/Ordovician
chert gravel streams in the western Ozarks [33-36]. However, recent molecular phylogenetic evidence revealed that

and OK, respectively.
E. tynerensis is composed of paedomorphic and metamorphic populations (the latter formerly considered E. multiplicata griseogaster), and paedomorphosis appears to have
arisen independently many times [37]. Populations of E.
tynerensis characteristically exhibit a single life-history
mode, suggesting that local habitat parameters are highly
influential, via either selection for a facultative response
or for particular genotypes [37]. This system offers a
unique opportunity to investigate the role of local microhabitat conditions responsible for major phenotypic
divergence.
Here we investigate the importance of streambed microstructure in the evolution of a major life-history polymorphism. We quantify substrate size, degree of sorting and
type for 22 populations (11 paedomorphic and 11 metamorphic; Fig. 1) of E. tynerensis from across the Ozark Plateau. Using a phylogeny based on 1,818 bp of the
mitochondrial genes cob and nad4 to assess relationships
among populations, we test for correlations between substrate parameters (size, sorting and type) and life-history
mode (paedomorphic vs. metamorphic) using phylogenetic independent contrasts. On the basis of our results we
make inferences about the evolution and maintenance of
alternate life-history modes in this group across the geologically diverse Ozark Plateau. Furthermore, we discuss
the role of microhabitat in initiating local divergence,

uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence ranged from
0.22 to 9.35 % among the 22 populations of E. tynerensis.
Bayesian analysis yielded a well-resolved tree with strong
support for most relationships (Fig. 2). Maximum parsimony analysis and nonparametric bootstrapping (not
shown) yielded very similar, well-supported trees. Phylogenetic independent contrasts calculated using the topology of the Bayesian tree were nearly identical to those
based on the maximum parsimony topology. Given the
similarity between the results of both methods, and since
Bayesian analyses provide a well-parameterized, modelbased estimation of branch lengths, we only show the
results based on the Bayesian tree.
Independent contrasts of substrate parameters
The distribution of substrate size differed in metamorphic
(M) versus paedomorphic (P) localities (Fig. 2). Most
notably, P localities lack substrate of the smaller size
classes. Phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) [3840] are powerful methods that account for ancestry when
testing for relationships between putative adaptations, or
adaptations and the environment. For each locality we
determined the proportion of sediment in three broad
size categories: sand/granule (0 to < 2 mm), small/
medium gravel (2 to < 12 mm), and large gravel (≥12
mm). Using PICs we found a significant negative correlation between paedomorphosis and the presence of material in the sand and granule (r2 = 0.7056; p < 0.001; Fig.
3A) and small/medium gravel (r2 = 0.3721; p < 0.002; Fig.
3B) categories.

which ultimately may result in large-scale changes in patterns of organismal development, morphology, ecology
and life history, as well as formation of new species.

Results
Sequence variation and phylogeny
The concatenated cob and nad4 sequences for all individuals formed an alignment of 1,818 homologous nucleotides. Each individual displayed a unique haplotype and

Sorting is a measure of the uniformity of particle sizes in
a substrate sample [41], and is an important parameter for
determining overall streambed compactness (embeddedness [33,34]). Streambeds composed of well sorted large
material provide open spaces between particles, whereas
weakly sorted streambeds (containing multiple size
classes) are much less penetrable because small material
fills in any interstitial spaces (see also discussion of
embeddedness below). To determine the degree of sorting, we counted the number of size classes (1 to 8) represented in the substrate samples at each locality. The size
class had to represent at least 5% of the total substrate
sample in order to be counted. The substrate in P localities
is very well sorted (i.e. composed of few size classes),
whereas M localities had substrate in many size classes.
We found a strong negative correlation between the
number of size classes and the presence of paedomorphs
(r2 = 0.7396; p < 0.001; Fig. 3C), indicating that substrate
particles were well sorted in P and poorly sorted in M
localities. Our samples were primarily composed of clastic
rocks (sandstone and siltstone) and chert. Clastic rocks
are composed of smaller particles (e.g., sand and silt),
while chert is an extremely hard siliceous substance. Eurycea tynerensis previously was found to be closely associated

with chert gravel, but transforming populations, which
were thought to be a different species, were not examined
in earlier studies [33-35]. Therefore, to quantify substrate
type for both life history modes we measured the proportion of the volume of each sample that was composed of
chert versus clastic material at each locality. The proportion of chert present in samples ranged from 0 to 97 %.
Paedomorph localities were primarily composed of chert,
while the M localities primarily contained clastic material.
We found a strong positive correlation between the presence of chert and paedomorphosis (r2 = 0.8464; p < 0.001;
Fig. 3D). Conversely, metamorphosis was strongly correlated with clastic substrates.

Discussion
Streambed microstructure and life history of E. tynerensis
Previous work has shown the presence of E. tynerensis to
be associated with Silurian and Ordovician chert gravel
streams in the western Ozark Plateau [33-35]. However,
because the authors of these studies considered only
paedomorphs as E. tynerensis, they were studying not the
distribution of the species but of a life history mode that
we now know to be independently derived in different
parts of a complex clade. In the light of new evidence that
E. tynerensis comprises both paedomorphic and transforming populations [37], we found that this developmental and life history polymorphism is strongly
correlated with several substrate parameters (size, degree
of sorting and type). These variables create distinctly different streambed microstructures where E. tynerensis
occurs (Fig. 4), which has major implications for the evolution of alternate life history modes.

Consistent with previous studies [33-35], we found that
paedomorphic populations are primarily restricted to
streams with chert gravel, which is very well sorted into
large size classes. Various factors have been hypothesized
to explain why chert gravel is important for paedomorphic E. tynerensis [33-35]. Chert is an extremely hard substance that breaks into sharp conchoidal patterns,
producing highly irregular shapes. When chert gravel is
deposited it creates very porous streambeds with large
interstitial spaces that can be utilized by small aquatic
organisms [33-35]. Previous studies have shown highly
embedded streams (containing a high percentage of fine
sediment) to be devoid of paedomorphic E. tynerensis
[33,34]. Owing to the very hard nature of chert, fracturing
is the primary mode of decomposition, and very little fine
material is released during a break. Furthermore, the irregular shapes and sharp edges of chert have been proposed
to promote turbulent currents between interstitial spaces,
which further inhibit deposition of fine sediments [35]. In
most localities the interstitial spaces between the chert
gravel are crucial to the existence of paedomorphic E. tynerensis for avoidance of both predators and desiccation [33-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/6

35]. During xeric summer conditions, most small streams
across the Ozark Plateau dry completely at the surface.
Interstitial spaces provide pathways for small fishes, crayfish, aquatic salamanders and other aquatic organisms to
access the water table far below the surface [29,34,35].
During extreme drought years, paedomorphic individuals
of E. tynerensis have been found at depths as great as 2.5
meters below the surface [29].
We found the substrate parameters for metamorphic populations to be different from those for paedomorphic
populations. In general, substrates in localities where E.
tynerensis metamorphoses contain very little chert gravel
and are primarily composed of poorly sorted and relatively smaller clastic (sandstone and siltstone) materials.
Clastic rocks are formed from compression of particulate
matter such as sand (sandstone) and silt (siltstone). Erosion of clastic rocks causes them to break down gradually
into constituents. For sandstone and siltstone, this causes
the deposition of a wide range of particle sizes (i.e., poorly
sorted material [41]) in streams where these rocks occur.
Small sediments fill in the interstitial spaces between
larger particles, forming a densely packed streambed
microstructure that is largely impenetrable [33]. Therefore
the substrate blocks access to any potential subterranean
water, so when surface water dries, metamorphosis is presumably critical at these localities. Metamorphic E. tynerensis have a relatively brief larval period (seven to eight
months) that matches the seasonality of surface habitat
moisture in the Ozark Plateau [42].
Owing to its direct connection with subsurface water, the
microstructure of streambed sediments appears to be a
major habitat feature determining life history mode in E.
tynerensis, although it may not be the only factor. Nutrient
abundance, persistence of underground water, availability
of suitable peripheral habitat, or many other factors may
also influence the distribution of alternate life history
modes in this group. The terrestrial habitats surrounding
paedomorphic E. tynerensis localities are often very dry,
because porous chert streambeds that extend outside the
stream proper are unable to sustain moisture. The lack of
suitable peripheral habitat for metamorphosing salamanders probably favours selection for paedomorphosis, or
the ability to shift facultatively to this life-history mode. A
similar situation occurs in the hot, dry Edwards Plateau of
central Texas: naturally metamorphosing populations of
Eurycea (members of the E. troglodytes complex sensu
[43,44]) appear limited to a small region of mesic canyons with moist streamside habitat, whereas all other
known Eurycea in the region are strictly paedomorphic
[44,45].
The relationships among all the 26 recognized species of
Eurycea [46] are unclear, but at least one highly relevant

aspect of the phylogeny has been established. Eurycea tynerensis is phylogenetically nested in a clade of otherwise
strictly metamorphosing species (E. multiplicata and E.
spelaea) [37,47]. Thus, paedomorphosis, or the ability to
be facultatively paedomorphic, probably evolved independently in the ancestor of the E. tynerensis group, while
the ability to metamorphose has also been maintained.
Paedomorphosis enables the exploitation of unique chert
gravel bottom streams that allow continuous access to
permanent water, while metamorphosis has permitted the
continued colonization of seasonally ephemeral aquatic
habitats throughout the Ozark Plateau. Several other species of Eurycea (E. longicauda, E. lucifuga, and E. spelaea) are

broadly sympatric with E. tynerensis, however none exhibit
paedomorphosis [48]. This may explain their restriction
to the headwaters of springs and to caves that contain
water, whereas the distribution of E. tynerensis extends
much further throughout the stream [49]. This further
supports the hypothesis that some independently evolved
feature of the E. tynerensis clade governs paedomorphosis.
Here we treat E. tynerensis as a single species, the most conservative approach given the well-supported monophyly
of the group. However, especially given the levels of
sequence divergence present, it seems likely that numerous independent lineages are evolving in response to

readily quantifiable habitat parameters, and multiple species may already be present. Whether because phenotypic
plasticity is retained over long periods of evolutionary
time or metamorphosis versus paedomorphosis is repeatedly selected for, members of the E. tynerensis group represent a clear example of evolutionary developmental
change in vertebrates attributable to differences in habitat
microstructure.
Developmental divergence in salamanders
Nine of the 10 salamander families exhibit paedomorphosis [10,14,48], a developmental deviation from the
typically biphasic amphibian life cycle to a strictly aquatic
one. All species in the families Amphiumidae, Cryptobranchidae, Proteidae, and Sirenidae are paedomorphic,
whereas within five other families (Ambystomatidae,
Dicamptodontidae, Hynobiidae, Plethodontidae, and
Salamandridae), paedomorphosis is variable within and
among species. All species of amphiumids, cryptobranchids, proteids, and sirenids, as well as some plethodontids and ambystomatids, are obligate paedomorphs
(i.e., cannot metamorphose) in nature [10,12,14]. For
many of these species the ability to metamorphose has
been completely lost, and cannot even be induced experimentally with hormonal treatment [12,14]. Conversely,
several species of ambystomatids, salamandrids, and possibly other salamanders are facultatively paedomorphic,
with life-history mode dictated by environmental conditions [10]. This plasticity allows populations, and even
individuals, to change strategies when faced with fluctuating environmental conditions. Individuals of some species may be paedomorphic for part of their life (i.e.
reproduce in the aquatic larval form) prior to metamorphosis [48,50].

Selection for plasticity in life-history strategies allows
individuals, populations and/or species to persist in
unpredictable environments [7]. However, selection on
populations in temporally very stable environments may
favour a single mode of life history and eliminate another
[21,23,51]. This seems to be the case for several paedomorphic populations of ambystomatids [20,26,28,52],
salamandrids [17,24], and plethodontids [[27,53], this
study] that inhabit relatively permanent aquatic systems,
where surrounding terrestrial conditions often are harsh
and not conducive for terrestrial salamanders. Arguably,
temporary aquatic habitats strongly select for metamorphosis in salamanders with an aquatic larval stage
[[50,51], this study]. Genetic crosses [54,55] and molecular genetic analyses [56-59] indicate that there are strong
heritable components to the variations in developmental
timing of closely related ambystomatid salamanders. Artificial selection studies on Ambystoma talpoideum demonstrated that pond drying can significantly increase the
frequency of metamorphosis over very brief periods (only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/6

four generations) [51]. Toward the opposite extreme,
obligately paedomorphic salamanders may arise from facultatively paedomorphic ancestors [15,20]. For example,
based on genetic linkage mapping in captive versus wild
populations of the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), Voss
and Shaffer [57] suggested that obligate paedomorphosis
in captive populations may have resulted from artificial
selection and/or bottlenecking when the colonies were
established. The seemingly irreversible evolution of obligate paedomorphosis may be the result of either strong
selection for paedomorphic "alleles", or loss-of-function
mutations in genes associated with metamorphosis. Consequently, the removal of ecological, developmental or
genetic constraints associated with metamorphosis or terrestriality may have allowed for the evolution of some of
the most morphologically divergent salamanders. Aquifer-dwelling paedomorphic plethodontids such as Eurycea
rathbuni and Haideotriton wallacei have extreme subterranean morphologies, and bear little resemblance to relatively
closely
related
surface-dwelling
species
[43,44,48,60]. Indeed, the obligate paedomorphic salamanders of the families Sirenidae and Amphiumidae,
each of which diverged from other salamanders by at least
the Upper Cretaceous [61], have evolved to be similar in
body form and ecology to "eel like" fishes and dipnoans.
Life history evolution and reproductive isolation in
plethodontids
More than two thirds (377 described species) of the
world's salamanders are in the Family Plethodontidae
[46], a group marked by extensive variation in ecology,
life history, developmental timing and morphological
innovation [53,62-64]. This diversity has been attributed,
in part, to relatively low dispersal rates among populations [65], combined with divergence in courtship behaviours and evolution of associated pheromones [66-70].
These important aspects of plethodontid biology lead us
to propose that reproductive isolation among populations exhibiting alternate developmental modes may
occur more readily in plethodontids than other salamanders. The Eurycea tynerensis group will be a useful system
for testing this hypothesis.

Morphological development and courtship behaviour are
decoupled in the salamandrid Triturus alpestris [71,72],
and paedomorphic and metamorphic individuals can
court and reproduce despite having divergent morphologies. However, we suggest that the developmental shift
from metamorphosis to paedomorphosis in plethodontids could have a profound impact on mate recognition.
Almost all metamorphosing plethodontids exhibit terrestrial courtship, a strategy that is uncommon among the
rest of the salamander families [66-70,73]. One diagnostic
feature of adult metamorphosing plethodontids that is
intimately associated with terrestrial courtship is the

BMC Biology 2006, 4:6

nasolabial groove, a tract on the surface of the skin that
leads from the nostril to the margin of the upper lip [6670,73]. To the best of our knowledge, the nasolabial
groove only develops completely in fully metamorphosed
individuals [[74-78], RMB pers obs, D. B. Wake pers com].
Therefore, we speculate that paedomorphic individuals
may retain the larval aquatic communication system,
while terrestrial metamorphs use other methods to find
mates.
Spatial segregation in breeding ponds creates asymmetric
reproductive isolation between sympatric morphs of the
mole salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum [79]. Metamorphic males rarely encounter paedomorphic females, but
no isolation is apparent between paedomorphic males
and metamorphic females [79]. This asymmetry is considered to have little influence on sympatric speciation of the
alternate phenotypes [79]. Little is known about the
reproductive biology of Eurycea tynerensis, but there are
notable differences between paedomorphic and metamorphosing populations [42,80]. For example, in many
localities courting pairs of transformed individuals are
commonly found at the edges of streams out of water,
where it would be impossible for paedomorphs to reproduce [RMB pers obs]. Consequently, in addition to possible selection for single, distinct life history modes among
populations, ecological, structural and behavioral differences could present barriers to communication between
paedomorphs and metamorphs, promoting reproductive
isolation in any areas where these two forms may meet.
This could provide the basis for speciation.

geographic distribution, which represent the full spectrum
of mitochondrial divergence within E. tynerensis [37].
Adult specimens from each of the 22 localities were collected for phylogenetic analyses. Salamanders were euthanised by submersion in a 10% solution of MS-222
according to IACUC protocols. Vouchers and tissues are in
the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) Amphibian
and Reptile Diversity Research Center. Over a five year
period (2000–2005) each of these localities was visited
multiple times, and adult individuals observed at each
locality were either all paedomorphic (sexually mature in
the aquatic larval form) or all metamorphic (completely
transformed). Sexual maturity of paedomorphs was determined by the presence of oviducal eggs in females and
well-developed pigmented testes in males. At all the metamorphic localities, females guarding eggs and/or immature larvae were found on at least one visit, indicating that
metamorphic E. tynerensis were breeding along these
streams and were not simply transients.

Methods

DNA isolation amplification and sequencing
DNA was isolated using DNeasy extraction kits (Qiagen).
Portions of two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b (cob,
1118 nucleotides) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4
(nad4, 700 nucleotides), were amplified via polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). The primer pairs MVZ15 5'- GAA
CTA ATG GCC CAC ACW WTA CGN AA -3' [81] and
ETCR 5'- TTC TAA ACT ACA ACA GCA TC -3' [37] were
used to amplify cob, and ND4F 5'- CAC CTA TGA CTA
CCA AAA GCT CAT GTA GAA GC -3' [82] and EML1R 5'CTT TCR TRT CTA GGG TCA CAG CCT AG -3' [37], were
used for nad4. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1%
agarose gels. Bands of the expected molecular weight were
excised, purified and ligated into a plasmid vector using
Topo-TA kits (Invitrogen). Plasmids were used to transform E. coli via heat shocking at 42°C. Transformed cells
were plated on kanamycin/X-gal plates for blue/white
selection. White colonies were picked and cultured overnight in Luria-Bertani broth. Plasmids were purified using
a Qiagen Plasmid Miniprep kit and standard protocols,
except that a 1:10 dilution of EB buffer:/water was used for
the final elution. Approximately 4 µl of plasmid was dried
for sequencing. SequiTherm Excel ™ sequencing kits (Epicentre Technologies) and infrared labeled primers were
used for sequencing reactions. Plasmids from at least two
different clones of each fragment, for each specimen, were
bi-directionally sequenced on a LiCor 4200 L long-read,
dual-laser sequencer. Both strands were sequenced completely for each sample.

Sampling localities and specimens
Eurycea tynerensis were collected from throughout the
Ozark Plateau of Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma by
RMB and colleagues from August 2000 – August 2003. We
selected 22 localities (11 paedomorphic and 11 metamorphic; Fig. 1; [see Additional File 1]) from throughout the

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
We used Sequencher ™ 3.1 (Gene Codes Corp.) to align
and edit sequences. No indels were observed, and alignment was unambiguous. Both gene fragments were translated in MacClade [83], and no stop codons were found.

Conclusion
The geologically diverse Ozark Plateau is a unique landscape where distinctly different stream habitats occur in
very close proximity. These habitat differences appear to
strongly influence the development of E. tynerensis, either
facultatively or by selection for alleles governing alternate
developmental strategies, as most populations are unimodal in life history. The remarkably robust association
between a relatively simple habitat feature such as streambed microstructure and developmental mode in salamanders of the Eurycea tynerensis group represents strong
evidence for the role of microhabitat factors that may ultimately determine major changes in ontogeny, ecology,
morphology and life history, and contribute to the process of speciation.

Sequences were deposited in GenBank [see Additional

of both genes was analyzed using Bayesian methodology.
Eurycea multiplicata and E. spelaea, two species closely
related to E. tynerensis [37,47], were used as outgroups to
root the trees. ModelTest v. 3.06 [84] was used to calculate
the most appropriate model of nucleotide substitution.
ModelTest selected the same model (HKY + I + Γ) for both
genes. For cob, transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio =
8.4750, proportion of invariable sites (I) = 0.4856,
gamma distribution shape parameter (Γ) = 0.8822, and
mean base frequencies were A = 0.3078; C = 0.2557; G =
0.1341; T = 0.3024. For nad4, Ti/Tv ratio = 11.2622, I =
0.3496, Γ = 0.3835, and mean base frequencies were A =
0.3404; C = 0.2768; G = 0.1179; T = 0.2649.
The data were partitioned by gene (cob and nad4) for Bayesian analyses (all partitions unlinked) implemented in
MrBayes 3.0 [85]. Analyses were run with four chains and
uniform priors for 5.05 million generations (with the first
50,000 discarded as burn-in; stationarity of likelihoods
achieved before this point). The resulting 50% majorityrule consensus of the 50,000 post burn-in trees, sampled
every 100 generations, was computed in PAUP*v 4.0b10
[86]. Bayesian branch lengths for the combined data set
were averaged across trees in MrBayes 3.0 [85].
Unweighted maximum parsimony analysis and nonparametric bootstrapping were also performed using PAUP*.
The resulting tree was congruent in most respects with the
Bayesian tree, with strong support for the same nodes that
were highly supported in the Bayesian analysis. Phylogenetic independent contrasts (see below) using topologies
and branch lengths from both methods of analyses
yielded nearly identical results. Given the high degree of
congruence between the results of both analyses, we only
show the results from Bayesian analyses.
Substrate sampling and quantification of size and type
Three stream substrate samples were collected from each
of the 22 localities. The first substrate sample was collected immediately adjacent to where the first E. tynerensis
at each locality was found during the sampling period.
The other two samples were randomly selected from one
to six meters up and downstream from where the first substrate sample was collected. The number of meters (1 to 6)
was decided by rolling a six-sided die. Substrate samples
were returned to the University of Texas at Arlington and
dried completely under incandescent lamps. Dried substrate samples were sorted by size using a cylinder of eight
hierarchically stacked screen sieves. Substrate samples
were poured into the top of the cylinder, which was then
capped and fixed to an orbit shaker (Lab Line Instruments
Inc.) and shaken at 250 rpm for five minutes. The sieves
separated the substrate into eight size classes (0 to < 0.25,
0.25 to < 0.5, 0.5 to < 2, 2 to < 4, 4 to < 6, 6 to < 12, 12 to

< 25, & ≥ 25 mm) based on mesh diameter. The total volume of substrate (in ml) in each category was measured
by water displacement in graduated cylinders. The three
substrate samples collected at each locality were combined on the basis of their extreme similarity.
Independent contrasts
Testing for correlations between organismal traits and
their environments is one of the many uses of phylogenetic comparative methods [38-40]. We used phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC) [38] calculated in
COMPARE version 4.6 [87] to account for possible phylogenetic non-independence of our data, when testing for
a correlation between stream substrate parameters (size,
degree of sorting and type) and life history mode. We
based our comparative analysis on the Bayesian phylogeny and branch lengths, although results based on the
maximum parsimony tree were almost identical (data not
shown). Our Bayesian topology had two trichotomies.
However, COMPARE cannot handle polytomies [87]. To
resolve these ambiguities we arbitrarily placed P8 as sister
to the clade containing M8, P9, M7, P7, P10 and P11, and
we made P5 and P6 a clade. We assigned extremely short
(0.000001 substitutions/site) lengths to internal branches
subtending these nodes [87].

Life history of salamanders at each locality was scored as
a categorical variable: paedomorphic (0) and metamorphic (1). PIC of life history mode was calculated against
four continuous substrate parameters (the proportion of
sand and granule, the proportion of small/medium
gravel, the number of substrate size classes, and the proportion of chert) for the 22 localities. Standard errors of
all variables were set to zero. Using SAS v. 8.2 (SAS institute Inc.), 1000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random iterations were used to create a random distribution
of r2 values based on the original data. To assess significance (p < 0.05), our observed r2 for each regression was
compared to this distribution to test the relationship
between life-history mode and a given substrate parameter. We also found streams containing large gravel to be
positively correlated with paedomorphosis, but we do not
formally test this because it is simply an "inverse" test of
sand and granule association with developmental mode.
The original application of phylogenetic comparative
methods such as independent contrasts was for interspecific comparisons, although intraspecific studies have
highlighted the utility of these methods within species
[88-90]. Recently, Niewiaroski and others [91] questioned
the necessity of applying phylogenetic comparative methods below the species level. They pointed out the possibility of making Type I errors (overlooking significant
correlations) by using such a conservative method at shallow levels of divergence, but noted that more studies at

this scale are warranted. Even though phylogenetic comparative methods may be statistically conservative, we
implement them here to be certain that our results are not
biased by common ancestry.
