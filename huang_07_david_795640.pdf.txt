Abstract
The DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov uses a novel
agglomeration algorithm to condense a list of genes or associated biological terms into organized
classes of related genes or biology, called biological modules. This organization is accomplished by
mining the complex biological co-occurrences found in multiple sources of functional annotation.
It is a powerful method to group functionally related genes and terms into a manageable number
of biological modules for efficient interpretation of gene lists in a network context.

Rationale

Biological interpretation of large gene lists derived from highthroughput genomic or proteomic studies can be a challenging and daunting process. Some of the difficulties include:
acquiring large amounts of functional annotation for every
gene; the distributed nature of annotation across numerous
sources, that is, not centralized; summarizing which genes
are associated with specific biological processes and ranking
these processes by over-representation analysis; condensing
repetitive or redundant annotation data; identifying functional biological modules consisting of related genes and
terms; and viewing inter-relationships between groups of
genes and groups of biological terms. A number of publicly

available bioinformatics tools have addressed the first three
points above, including, but not limited to, GoMiner, DAVID,
EASE, GOstat, Onto-express, GoToolBox, FatiGO, GOSSIP,
GFINDer, GOBar, and so on [1-25]. The power of many of
these applications is to systematically highlight the most
over-represented biological terms, out of a list of hundreds or
thousands of terms, to increase the likelihood of investigators
identifying biological processes most pertinent to the biological phenomena under study [17]. While these tools are
extremely useful, they are still weak in mining the many-tomany gene-to-term relationships found in functional annotation databases, as well as in condensing redundant contents.

Individual genes can clearly be associated with multiple biological terms and, conversely, individual biological terms can
be associated with multiple genes. These associations form a
complex relationship network of 'many-genes-to-manyterms' that represents the true complex nature of biological
processes. Data-mining tools that can extract these complex
and redundant relationships should be able to identify functional gene-term biological modules. This identification can
be accomplished by using exploratory statistical methods that
identify groups of genes sharing similar biological terms or,
alternatively, identifying groups of biological terms sharing
similar genes. For example, if a subset of genes in a list is
sodium transporters, then one can expect that they will have
major functional annotations in common. A method that can
group these genes based on the strength of overlap of the
functional annotation should identify modules of related
genes and terms. Similarly, terms that have many genes in
common can also be grouped into a module of related terms
and genes; for example, the terms 'apoptosis', 'cell death',
'death', and 'regulation of cell death' will be grouped together
because these terms share a large number of common genes.
The advantages of this method of classifying groups of genes
and terms into biological modules are: it largely reduces
redundant results into a manageable size; it is much easier to
understand and visualize gene-to-gene, term-to-term, and
gene-to-term relationships, since related genes and terms are
brought together in one place; and it is much easier to relate
biological modules of interest to a study than it is to relate
hundreds of individual terms.
The goals of the project are to identify groups of genes sharing
common biology or, alternatively, to identify groups of biological terms sharing common genes relevant to an investigator's study. Most importantly, the heterogeneous
annotations/genes can be grouped as long as they are within
the same, relevant biological context. In this sense, the definition of functional group in this work is much broader than the
traditional concept. The improvement of biological discovery
is through better organization of massive and redundant
results into a more readable and manageable format (that is
biological groups). To this end, we developed the DAVID (The
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery [26]) Gene Functional Classification Tool and the
DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering Tool to provide a
module-centric approach for functional analysis of large gene
lists. First, we developed a new method to measure gene-gene
similarity, based on the assumption that genes that share global functional annotation profiles are functionally related to
each other. Conversely, we measure term-term similarity
based on the assumption that terms that share global gene
profiles are functionally related to each other. Then, a DAVID
agglomeration method was developed to group related genes
or terms into functional groups (biological modules) based on
the similarity distances measure. The fuzziness feature of the
agglomeration method allows a gene or term to participate in
more than one functional group, better reflecting the true

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R183

'multiple-roles' nature of genes that can be lost if exclusive
methods, such as Hierarchical, K-means, or SOM clustering
are used. Functional groups are ranked based on all group
members' overall participation in the enriched biological
processes associated with the total gene list. A global view of
group-to-group relationships is also provided through a
unique fuzzy heat map visualization. A subset of 'drill-down'
functions associated with each biological module allows
investigators to explore and visualize relationships between
genes and terms. In this paper, we will mainly describe the
key algorithms associated with the DAVID Gene Functional
Classification Tool, illustrate the usefulness of several of the
functionalities, and demonstrate how quickly investigators
can apply the information in a biological module to their
study.

Implementation

The DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool [27] and
DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering Tool [28] are two
new components integrated in DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources [26]. They were designed as a server-client application on a UNIX server, with the Tomcat web server as the
serving engine. Java is the primary language used for calculations as well as the user interface, which utilizes Java Server
Page (JSP) technology. In-memory Java data objects containing all mappings between genes and annotation were developed to advance the calculation speed. The DAVID
Functional Annotation Clustering Tool uses the same algorithm as the DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool, but
conversely. Therefore, to illustrate the key scientific concepts,
we describe only the major procedures of the DAVID Gene
Functional Classification Tool. These procedures consist of
three major steps: measurement of functional relationship of
gene pairs, DAVID agglomeration method to partition genes
into functional gene groups, and visualization of results in
text and graphic modes (Figure 1).

Measuring functional relationship of gene pairs based
on the similarity of global annotation profiles
The traditional ways of grouping related genes are based on
either sequence similarity (sequence homologs), functional
categories (protein domain families), or co-expression clusters (microarray clusters). In fact, the majority of co-functioning genes are neither sequence-related nor in the same
protein families, such as genes in the same pathway. Therefore, the traditional phylogenetic grouping methods are powerful for evolution-based studies, but too specific and strict to
be of much use in classifying genes for the purpose of functional annotation. We propose a novel method to identify
related genes by measuring the similarity of their global
annotation profiles based on the hypothesis that if two genes
have similar annotation profiles, they should be functionally
related. This method is able to identify much broader gene
groups in which genes share major common biological features as well as tolerate some differences. For example, many

different types of genes, with or without too much sequence
similarity, could be grouped into a transcription regulation
class. We believe that the broader functional groups are more
useful for functional annotation purposes and, hence, biological interpretation.
Firstly, a gene-term annotation matrix (Figure 2a) was compiled in a binary mode using thousands of annotation terms
in 14 annotation categories (including Gene Ontology (GO),
Biological Process, GO Molecular Function, GO Cellular
Component, KEGG Pathways, BioCarta Pathways, Swiss-Prot
Keywords, BBID Pathways, SMART Domains, NIH Genetic
Association DB, UniProt Sequence Features, COG/KOG
Ontology, NCBI OMIM, InterPro Domains, and PIR Super-

Family Names) collected in the DAVID knowledgebase [29]
(Additional data file 7). Then, kappa statistics, a chance-corrected measure of co-occurrence between two sets of categorized data, is adopted to statistically measure the annotation
co-occurrence of any given gene pairs [30,31]. Since the annotation profile is in a binary categorical scale, kappa statistics
is more suitable than the Pearson correlation, which is typically used for continuous, non-categorical data.
For given annotation profiles of genes m and n, Omn represents the observed co-occurrence, Amn represents chance cooccurrence, and Kmn is the kappa value representing the
degree of annotation co-occurrence between genes m and n.

A hypothetical example of detecting gene-gene functional relationships by kappa statistics
Figure 2
A hypothetical example of detecting gene-gene functional relationships by kappa statistics. (a) The all-redundant and structured terms are broken into
'independent' terms in a flat linear collection. Each gene associates with some of the annotation term collection so that a gene-annotation matrix can be
built in a binary format, where 1 represents a positive match for the particular gene-term and 0 represents the unknown. Thus, each gene has a unique
profile of annotation terms represented by a combination of 1 s and 0 s. (b) For a particular example of genes a and b, a contingency table was constructed
for kappa statistics calculation. The higher kappa score (0.66) indicates that genes a and b are in considerable agreement, more so than by random chance.
By flipping the table 90 degrees, the kappa score of term-term can be achieved, based on the agreement of common genes (not shown). For more
information see Additional data files 11 and 12.

where Kmn is 1 for perfect co-occurrence and 0 for co-occurrence no better than random chance (Figure 2b).
While building the binary annotation matrix, the annotation
terms could be redundant or in a structured relationship
because many terms from different sources may have the
same biological meaning; in addition, GO terms fall into a
parent-child relationship in the GO hierarchical structure.
Some works demonstrate that gene-term enrichment analysis
is improved if the GO hierarchy is considered during the calculation of the enrichment score [32,33]. However, due to the

non-hierarchical structure of a majority of annotation
sources, we proposed a new 'flat' matrix strategy to break all
redundant and structured terms into 'independent' terms in a
flat, linear collection (Figure 2a). We believe that an equally
weighted, linear, all-inclusive strategy can greatly simplify
the situation, as well as maximally leverage the heterogeneous annotations in the similarity measurement (see Additional data files 11 and 12 for more discussion). To answer the
question, 'Can this strategy specifically detect the real relationship of gene-gene?', we conducted three studies. The first
was to compare the kappa score distribution of every possible
pair of human genes (approximately 300 million pairs) to
that of reported human protein-protein interaction pairs
[34]. The protein-protein interaction pairs should have a better chance to co-function in the same biological processes in

Figure 3 (see following page)
The gene-gene functional relationship can be specifically detected by kappa statistics
The gene-gene functional relationship can be specifically detected by kappa statistics. (a) Kappa scores were calculated for all possible combinations of
human gene-gene pairs (approximately 300 million). Only gene-gene pairs with a higher number of annotation terms in common possibly have good kappa
values. The box plot consists of the smallest and largest observations at the two end points (95% confidence interval), as well as a box from the 1st to 3rd
quartiles. The blue and red lines represent median and mean observations, respectively. (b) Kappa scores were calculated for all possible human gene-gene
pairs, gene-gene pairs with randomized annotation terms, all collected protein-protein interacting pairs, and all 'chemokine' gene pairs, respectively. The
distributions of those kappa scores from protein-protein interacting pairs (pink) and 'chemokine' gene pairs (light blue) significantly shift to the high value
end compared to human total (blue); conversely, the kappa score distribution (yellow) of gene pairs with randomized annotation terms remains in the
lower value end below 0.35. Interestingly, for the human genome (blue), over 50% of the kappa scores equal 0 (no detectable relationships) and >95% are
lower than 0.35. Altogether, this indicates that kappa statistics can specifically detect the gene-gene functional relationships.

contrast to random protein-protein pairs. Therefore, a certain
degree of functional relatedness should be observed by the
method, but not always. If the similarity measurement can
specifically detect gene-gene relationships rather than random noise, we would expect to see the score distribution of
the protein-protein interaction pairs to shift to the higher
value end (Figure 3b). The second study was to detect the
kappa score distribution of genes specifically selected
because their names contained the word 'chemokine'. Since
we selected genes with an extreme bias of similarity, we
expected the kappa scores to give much higher values (Figure
3). The third study was to compare the kappa score distribution of all human gene pairs to that of artificial gene pairs with
annotation profiles randomly generated, based on the true
human annotation frequency. It was expected that the simulated kappa scores would be located only in the lower value
end (Figure 3). The three independent studies, combined
with the extensive test analysis on microarray datasets,
strongly supported the strategy that functional similarity
measurement is able to specifically detect gene-gene relationships, particularly for the pairs with a kappa score 0.35 or
above, as suggested by our randomization study (Figure 3;
Additional data file 10). However, since the measurement
relies on known annotation profiles, this method, like any
other high-throughput functional analytical tools, will obviously not work for the genes that lack annotation.

A novel agglomeration method to classify a gene list
into functionally related groups based on the functional
similarity scores
After the kappa score matrix of all possible pair-wide genes is
calculated, it is possible to classify the highly related genes.
We examined the typical clustering methods, including hierarchical tree, K-means, hierarchical, FANNY, and SOM. All of
them produced weaker clustering results (Additional data file
5) with our test datasets. The poor clustering results stem
from one or more of the following weaknesses associated with
the aforementioned clustering algorithms. First,: genes must
be assigned to one cluster, even though their absolute relationship is weak to all clusters. This results in higher contamination of clusters with noise by forcing membership of
weakly related genes. Second, genes can belong to only one
cluster, which does not align well with the basic biological
nature of genes, in that one gene could participate in multiple,
different roles. Third, outliers and uneven cluster sizes can
greatly affect clustering quality. Fourth, it is difficult to know
the optimal K (number of clusters) for K-means, FANNY, or
SOM.
This situation motivated us to develop another agglomeration
approach, heuristic fuzzy multiple-linkage partitioning, to
better reflect the structure of functional annotation data. It
can be described as three major steps (Figure 4; see Additional data file 13 for a step-by-step example). Step 1, multiple
initial seeds: each gene is selected to serve as a medoid, or
center of an initial cluster, as long as it meets minimum relat-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R183

edness (user input parameters, such as genes, are related to
more than three other genes with kappa > 0.35) to other
genes in the list. Step 2, merge seeds by a minimum, multiple
linkage (that is, merge two seeds when they share 50% of their
group members). Step 3, repeat step 2 until no more merging
can occur.
This method works better than others for this particular type
of analysis (Additional data file 5). This method: eliminates
overall irrelevant/weak elements, as orphan genes, to significantly push the signal out of noise; allows for fuzziness by
allowing genes to be assigned to more than one cluster which
aligns with the biological nature; dynamically determines the
number of clusters based on the chosen threshold; generates
grand groups for easy interpretation; and tolerates outliers
extremely well by excluding them in step 1.
There is no gold standard or null hypothesis to evaluate clustering methods and hence no right or wrong answers for any
given clustering algorithms. One method may work better
than others in the sense that it is more sensitive to the natural
structure of a particular problem. However, this method, like
any other heuristic approach, has the common weakness that
an improper running criteria setting can lead to distorted
results. In order to aid less advanced users with the setting of
these criteria, we preset five general levels representing combinations of the detailed settings from very low to very high
stringencies; based on our extensive tests on multiple datasets, the default stringency level (medium) should be optimal
for most cases.
Since there is not a null hypothesis test to compare the quality
between clustering algorithms, we try to summarize the
quality of our agglomeration algorithm based on randomly
selected genes that all clearly belong to one protein family (for
example, kinase, phosphatase, chemokine, and so on). Then,
the genes were classified by the method. Since we have preknowledge about the gene family information, the gene(s)
that are grouped incorrectly or excluded from the correct
group(s) can be roughly estimated. We observed that the
leaking rate (that is, a gene not placed into a group to which it
does belong) is between 1% and 2%, and the noise rate (that
is, a gene incorrectly placed into a group to which it does not
belong) is between 1% and 5%. Most importantly, the method
is able to identify key members of groups so that the major
biology of each group can quickly be determined. Since the
analytical approach is biological module-centric, the major
biology associated with each gene group is determined by the
majority of gene members rather than by individual genes.
Thus, the biology of each group should be very stable, even
though there is a chance that a few members are excluded or
incorrectly included. In summary, this clustering method
shows reasonable performance by eliminating irrelevant,
'noisy' genes and by bringing together strongly related functional groups, while maintaining the fuzzy nature of biology
by which genes may be involved in multiple processes.

iteratively merged with each other to form a larger group based on the multi-linkage rule, that is, sharing 50% or more of memberships, until all secondary
clusters (thicker oval) are stable. Importantly, the genes not covered by any qualified initial seeding group are considered as outliers (in gray). (d) Finally,
three final groups (thicker ovals) are formed because they can no longer be merged with any other group. One gene (in red) belonging to two groups
represents the fuzziness capability of the algorithm. And outliers (in gray in (c)) are removed for clearer presentation. A step-by-step example can be
found in Additional data file 13.

The last question is, 'Which final functional gene groups are
more significant for the experiment?' We extended the traditional enrichment analysis logic so that a gene group is more
important if a majority of its gene members is associated with
highly enriched annotation terms as found in the traditional
enrichment analysis of the total gene list. Thus, the enrichment score of each group is measured by the geometric mean
of the EASE Scores (modified Fisher Exact) [2] associated
with the enriched annotation terms that belong to this gene
group. Importantly, the multiple testing correction issues are
considered in the individual EASE scores [2]. And all EASE
scores (significant or insignificant) associated with the group
participate in the algorithm. In order to emphasize that the
geometric mean is a relative score instead of an absolute p
value, minus log transformation is applied on the geometric
mean (Additional data file 6). Therefore, the group enrichment scores are intended to order the relative importance of
the gene groups instead of as absolute decision values. A
higher score for a group indicates that the group members are
involved in more important (enriched) roles. However, all
gene groups are potentially interesting despite lower
rankings.

Results and discussion

Visualization of results in a very simple text format and
a novel fuzzy heat map view

The following detailed discussion is mainly focused on the
second microarray dataset [39], of which the gene list is
available as demo list 2 on our tool entry page. In this example
dataset, authors treated freshly isolated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with an HIV envelope protein
(gp120) and further measured genome-wide gene expression
changes using Affymetrix U95A chips [40]. This study provides a global view of the complex interaction between viral
and cellular factors, which is an essential mechanism for HIV
replication in resting or suboptimally activated PBMCs. A
functionally significant annotation of approximately 400
genes (Additional data file 1) derived from the microarray
experiment was classified by the authors into five major functional categories: cytokines, chemokines, transcription
factors, kinases, and membrane fusion [39]. While the
cytokine and chemokine categories were systematically
highlighted by EASE (a GO enrichment analysis based on the
Fisher Exact Test) [2], other annotation categories reported
in the publication were discovered through semi-manual
analysis by bioinformatics experts with an advanced level of
knowledge of both biology and computer tools.

We implemented both a very simple text format (Figure 5)
and a comprehensive novel fuzzy heat map graphic view
(Additional data file 4) to present the functional groups
derived from the above procedure. The text format simply
lists all functional gene groups identified by the algorithm.
Although it looks like a linear format, the view allows the user
to visualize the multidimensional data of the groups, that is,
group members consisting of multiple related genes and
terms. Users are able to easily explore the major functional
groups by viewing many related genes and annotation terms
brought together by the tool. Some accessory, 'drill-down'
functionalities (for example, Enriched Terms Report, 2-D
View, and so on; Figure 5) are available for each functional
group for users to rapidly explore the associated biology in
detail. For example, the 'Enriched Term Report' button lists
the major annotation terms associated within the functional
groups based on the DAVID enrichment engine; the '2-D
View' button gives the detailed relationship of genes-to-terms
in a two-dimensional heat map view so that the user is able to
examine the rich relationship of related genes and annotations in-depth (Figure 6); the 'Related Genes' button allows
users to refine the group gene members in different scopes,
which can extend the membership of interest and also correct
potential type I and II errors in the clustering algorithm
(Additional data file 9C). Furthermore, the text format provides links to the list of orphan genes not classified into any
functional groups. These genes are orphaned because they do
not meet one or more of the partitioning criteria (that is,
group membership thresholds, and so on) The list is provided
since they may be important genes for the user to examine.

We examined the newly developed biological module-centric
tools (see Additional data file 8 for a graphical tutorial of
using the tools) on two published microarray datasets. It is
important to mention that, to avoid potential bias, the
datasets of the case studies are different from those used during algorithm development. For the first microarray dataset
[35], G1 response genes were identified by microarray experiments after introducing G1 cyclin Cln3p to cln- yeast cells
that were previously arrested with cdc34-2. For comparison,
the dataset was analyzed by tools with very different algorithms, that is, DAVID Tools [26], GoMiner [16], Ontologizer
[33], GOStat [3], ermineJ [36], ADGO [37] and GENECODIS
[38]. All tools are able to highlight the major terms (for example, cell cycle, DNA repair, DNA replication, budding, and so
on), consistent with previously published observations. However, the DAVID methods are more sensitive to a couple of
additional important terms (for example, cyclin-dependant
kinase activity, mating, and so on) that were not found among
the top terms in the output from the other tools. For more
detailed results, comparisons and discussion, see Additional
data file 14.

The same data re-analyzed by typical functional
annotation tools
After the continuous addition of annotations for genes as well
as the refinement of gene-term enrichment algorithms during
the years since the above study [39] was published, it is
interesting to see how the systematic results from current
functional annotation tools compare to those reported in this
publication. Some of the popular functional annotation tools,
such as DAVID Gene Functional Annotation Tool, GOStat,
GoMiner, TopGO, Ontologizer, ADGO and GENECODIS
[1,3,16,32,33,37,38], were chosen to identify major biological

A text format report from the Gene Functional Classification Tool
A text format report from the Gene Functional Classification Tool. The example shows the output of 16 genes (Additional data file 1) analyzed by the tool
with default settings. Without prior knowledge, the tool is able to classify genes into three functional gene groups. On each group header, a set of buttons
is provided for in-depth exploration of the annotation for the group. 'T' reports the major enriched annotation terms associated with the group. The 'Heat
Map' symbol provides a detailed graphical view of gene-term relationships. 'RG' searches other related genes in the genome but not in the list.

terms with the same gene list. In order to maximally reflect
the design spirit of each tool and also make the results more
comparable, we kept all default parameters of the tools
unchanged, except for synchronizing the data coverage scope
within all GO levels (DAVID covers multiple data sources and
GOstat covers GO level 3 or above by default). Although all of
the testing tools are based on similar gene-term enrichment
algorithms, the sensitivity and specificity could be different
due to different updates of GO data content, different background gene lists, different score systems, different gene ID
mapping schemes, and so on. After obtaining hundreds of
annotation terms reported by each of the above tools, the
terms, particularly at the top of the results, were compared
with each other (Table 1). Approximately 30% of the top
terms overlapped between at least two of the tools, for example, cytokine/chemokine activity, inflammatory response,
and so on. Some reported terms, for example, kinase, are not
ranked at the top by any of the tools (that is GOMiner, 49;
DAVID, 24; GOStat, 82; topGO, 76; Ontologizer, 111).

Even though the results from the tools all point in the same
biological direction, there are four obvious problems. First,
redundant/similar/hierarchical terms appear in different
(significance) positions within the reports (for example,
response to stress, response to wounding, response to pathogenic bacteria, response to other organisms, response to
external biotic stimulus, inflammatory response, and so on),
which makes it difficult for the user to gain or maintain a clear
focus of the whole biological picture. It is not easy for users to
comprehensively pool all genes related to the same key biology without manually summarizing all related redundant
terms. Second, the redundant/similar/hierarchical terms
could largely dilute the focus on other key biology that has few
or no redundancies (for example, only one term is for establishment of cellular localization). If several redundant/similar/hierarchical terms are represented in the top of the list,
less redundant terms may be pushed down the list, possibly
decreasing the chance of discovery; for example, a transcription regulation term, reported in an original publication, was

not listed in the top 20 by any of the tools. Third, in contrast,
due to differences of the annotation levels of different
sources, redundant/similar/hierarchical terms may themselves be diluted. While alone a single term may not be at the
top of the list, in combination with redundant/similar/hierarchical terms, the biological function may be very significant.
Fourth, current tools do not emphasize the inter-relationships between key biological terms (for example, relationships between chemokine/cytokine and signal transduction).
In conclusion, the recent improvement of functional annotation tools provides a powerful means for users to systematically identify key biological functions associated with a gene
list. However, due to the weaknesses discussed above, refinement of current gene-term enrichment algorithms and
improvement of software usability alone may not address all
the issues. Therefore, the development of novel alternative
algorithms as a complement is still very necessary.

The same data analyzed by the DAVID Gene
Functional Classification Tool
The same gene list (Additional data file 1) was submitted to
our newly developed DAVID Gene Functional Classification
Tool described previously (Additional data file 8). The tool is
able to efficiently handle up to 3,000 genes at a time, within a
few seconds. The tool classified the approximately 400 genes
into 16 functional groups (Table 2 and Additional data file 2).
The result is much more focused, simplified, and in a manageable size for investigators' interpretation compared to working with a few hundred terms, of which many are redundant
in results derived using the traditional tools discussed in the
previous section. More importantly, all five reported annotation categories are covered by the 16 functional groups (Table
2). In addition, the tool also lists another 11 interesting gene
groups not reported in the original publication. For example,
group 13 (tubulin genes) plays a critical role in the nucleation
of microtubule assembly. Some studies suggest that HIV
infection leads to enteric microtubule depolymerization of
infected cells, resulting in increases in HIV permeability [41].
This tool focuses on the overall major common annotation
terms associated with a gene group rather than one term or
one gene at a time, thereby producing clearer, more concise
results that can better allow for focus on the major biology of
an experiment. The tool simplifies the results by condensing
the redundant terms and summarizing inter-relationships.
This analytical logic and presentation format closely mimics
how the human brain works and the results better represent
the nature of biology.

The DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool allows users
to further explore a given biological module/gene group in
depth. For example, the 'enriched terms' button '2-D View' is
able to list all related terms and genes for the kinase group.
Thus, a user who is not familiar with kinases can explore the
terms of kinase activity, transferase activity, ATP-binding,
nucleotide binding, protein metabolism, tyrosine specificity,
serine/threonine specificity, regulation of G protein signaling, and signal transduction, and so on in one view at the
same time (Figure 6). Therefore, we can quickly learn the
biology for the kinase group with the above related terms in a
single view and also identify the fine differences among them.
For example, there are two G-protein coupling receptor
kinases, three protein tyrosine kinases and six kinases
involved in cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction
among the 23 kinases within the group (Figure 6). The fine
details may be very important for pinpointing the key biology
associated with a study.
Furthermore, the DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool
allows one gene to be present in more than one functional
group, which closely reflects the nature of biology whereby
one gene could play multiple roles in different processes. This
fuzziness feature improves the chances of discovery by maximally preserving all of the true relationships. For example,
general transcription factor II H (GTF2H4/TFIIH,
41371_at) was assigned to group 2 (transcription regulation
group) and group 5 (DNA damage/repair group) (Additional
data file 2). Some studies suggest TFIIH increases polymerase processivity in HIV infection [42]. Currently, there are
few reports about the TFIIH DNA repair mechanism being
involved in HIV infection, although this DNA repair
mechanism could be essential in HIV integration. Hence, the
fuzzy capability allows users not only to focus on the TFIIH
transcription regulation role but also to consider the possible
role in HIV integration through the DNA repair mechanism.
For another example, ring finger protein 40 (RNF40) is in
group 2 (transcription regulation group) and group 10 (chromosome assembly) (Additional data file 2). Although the biological significance of the ring finger protein in HIV infection
is still largely unclear, the annotation result points out two
potential areas for further exploration: first, the ring finger
protein regulates the tumor necrosis factor-related transcriptional pathway, which is critical to many aspects of HIV transcription; and second, it plays some role in DNA packaging
and chromosome integration. Thus, the fuzziness capability is
a powerful feature to maximally preserve biological patterns
and to discover fine differences for a given gene compared to
exclusive methods.

The example gene list was analyzed by GoMiner, DAVID, GOStat, Ontologizer, topGO, and ADGO. The annotation data coverage was set to GO
terms of all levels, and all other parameters used were each tool's default settings. Only the top 20 terms from each tool are shown (see Additional
data file 15 for all results). Many of the terms are redundant or found within the same hierarchy. We emphasize the top 20 terms for three reasons:
first, the top ranked terms represent the overall quality of the tools in terms of sensitivity and specificity; second, it renders the amount of analytical
effects equivalent and comparable throughout the comparisons, including the clustered results; and third, analysts usually spend more time and
attention on the top ranked terms due to time and focus constraints.

The genes of demo list 2 were analyzed by the Functional Classification Tool. The major biology terms associated with each group are manually
summarized based on gene-term enrichment buttons provided for each functional group.

The sensitivity of the Functional Classification Tool can vary
with different datasets and stringency criteria. If the running
criteria are not suitable to a particular dataset, the output can
be distorted. In such cases, some exploration of different running stringencies is necessary in order to obtain the optimal
results to meet the expectation of the study.

The same data analyzed by the Functional Annotation
Clustering Tool
Due to the redundancy/hierarchy problems in the results
obtained from traditional annotation tools (Table 1), a Functional Annotation Clustering Tool was also developed to
organize the highly redundant annotation term results into a

simplified and clustered format. This new format allows
investigators to focus on an annotation group level by quickly
skipping many redundant/similar/hierarchical terms within
the group. Compared to 222 individual terms reported by the
DAVID Functional Annotation Tool, a traditional term-centric enrichment method, the new tool was able to organize
them into 65 annotation clusters (Additional data file 3). For
example, the annotation cluster 3 (immune-response group)
consists of 11 redundant/similar/hierarchical terms; that is,
response to stress, inflammatory response, response to external stimulus, response to pest, pathogen or parasite, and so
on. These similar terms are spread throughout the traditional
term-centric enrichment report list of 222 terms. Most

The genes of demo list 2 were analyzed by the Functional Annotation Clustering Tool. The top 20 annotation clusters out of 65 total clusters have
group enrichment scores less than or equal to 0.05 (equivalent to 1.3 in minus log scale). The clusters are ordered by group enrichment score. The
representative biology terms associated with the top 20 annotation clusters are manually selected, showing a much clearer and non-redundant view
of the annotation terms associated with the study.

importantly, the top 20 annotation clusters with a group
enrichment score less than or equal to 0.05 (Table 3 and
Additional data file 3) contain all annotation categories
reported by the original publication, as well as interesting
groups not identified. The highly organized and simplified
annotation results allow users to quickly focus on the major
biology at an annotation cluster level instead of trying to come
to the same conclusions by putting together pieces that are
scattered throughout a list of hundreds of terms. In addition,
the annotation cluster is helpful in comprehensively pooling
all related genes associated with an annotation cluster consisting of many related terms. For example, each of the 11
terms within cluster 3 (immune-response cluster) associates
with different genes. A pooled gene list brought together by
cluster 3 regarding immune-response could be much more
comprehensive, compared to the genes selected from one or a
few individual terms. Moreover, the tool could possibly bring
up the terms not passing the minimum enrichment threshold
but highly related to other terms with significant enrichment
scores. In conclusion, the clustered result condenses the data
into smaller, much more organized biological term modules,
which allows investigators to quickly and comprehensively
focus on the key biology of interest.

Conclusion

The DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool [26] is able
to organize and condense large gene lists into biologically
meaningful modules. It changes functional annotation analysis from term- or gene-centric to biological module-centric.
This method takes into account the redundant and network
nature of biological annotation contents in order to concentrate on the larger biological picture rather than an individual
terms or genes. The DAVID Gene Functional Classification
Tool is complementary to other functional annotation tools.
