Abstract
Background: Among metazoans, retention of functional diet-derived chloroplasts (kleptoplasty) is
known only from the sea slug taxon Sacoglossa (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia). Intracellular maintenance
of plastids in the slug's digestive epithelium has long attracted interest given its implications for
understanding the evolution of endosymbiosis. However, photosynthetic ability varies widely among
sacoglossans; some species have no plastid retention while others survive for months solely on
photosynthesis. We present a molecular phylogenetic hypothesis for the Sacoglossa and a survey of
kleptoplasty from representatives of all major clades. We sought to quantify variation in photosynthetic
ability among lineages, identify phylogenetic origins of plastid retention, and assess whether kleptoplasty
was a key character in the radiation of the Sacoglossa.
Results: Three levels of photosynthetic activity were detected: (1) no functional retention; (2) short-term
retention lasting about one week; and (3) long-term retention for over a month. Phylogenetic analysis of
one nuclear and two mitochondrial loci revealed reciprocal monophyly of the shelled Oxynoacea and
shell-less Plakobranchacea, the latter comprising a monophyletic Plakobranchoidea and paraphyletic
Limapontioidea. Only species in the Plakobranchoidea expressed short- or long-term kleptoplasty, most
belonging to a speciose clade of slugs bearing parapodia (lateral flaps covering the dorsum). Bayesian
ancestral character state reconstructions indicated that functional short-term retention arose once in the
last common ancestor of Plakobranchoidea, and independently evolved into long-term retention in four
derived species.
Conclusion: We propose a sequential progression from short- to long-term kleptoplasty, with different
adaptations involved in each step. Short-term kleptoplasty likely arose as a deficiency in plastid digestion,
yielding additional energy via the release of fixed carbon. Functional short-term retention was an
apomorphy of the Plakobranchoidea, but the subsequent evolution of parapodia enabled slugs to protect
kleptoplasts against high irradiance and further prolong plastid survival. We conclude that functional shortterm retention was necessary but not sufficient for an adaptive radiation in the Plakobranchoidea,
especially in the genus Elysia which comprises a third of all sacoglossan species. The adaptations necessary
for long-term chloroplast survival arose independently in species feeding on different algal hosts, providing
a valuable study system for examining the parallel evolution of this unique trophic strategy.

Background
Coevolution of host organisms and their specialized consumers, such as small-bodied herbivores or parasites, has
been a major driver of speciation in terrestrial ecosystems
[1-5]. For instance, tolerance of plant chemistry has facilitated shifts among chemically similar hosts by phytophagous insect lineages; novel hosts then act as distinct
selective environments, fuelling the rapid evolution of
host races and adaptive diversification of insects [6-11].
Characters associated with host exploitation, such as feeding or detoxification of secondary metabolites, therefore
warrant special attention as evolutionary innovations that
contribute to biodiversity [12-15]. Such traits have rarely
been studied in aquatic systems, however, where the role
of ecological associations in speciation remains poorly
understood [16-20].
A rare adaptation that rests somewhere between endosymbiosis and predation is the retention of functional
chloroplasts within the bodies of herbivores. Termed
kleptoplasty, this phenomenon is documented in several
marine protists including foraminifers [21], dinoflagellates [22] and ciliates [23]. However, chloroplast retention in the Metazoa is known only in the gastropod taxon
Sacoglossa, a group of herbivorous sea slugs that feed
mainly on green algae in the Ulvophyceae sensu Floyd and
O'Kelly [24-32]. Taylor [33] mentioned kleptoplasts in
the digestive system of another metazoan species, the
rotifer Ascomorpha ecaudis. Subsequent investigations
identified these "organelles" as whole algal organisms,
usually called zoochlorellae [34].

2). The record for chloroplast retention is 14 months for
E. chlorotica [46].
Wägele [47] postulated that functional kleptoplasty was a
key character in the Sacoglossa, enhancing speciation by
opening new adaptive zones. Although different efficiencies in chloroplasts' retention are known now for several
decades, neither any attempt has been made to understand evolutionary history of this unique phenomenon
within a metazoan group, nor the assumption of being a
key character has ever been tested. We hypothesize that: 1.
kleptoplasty is a key character promoting adaptive radiation in this group, 2. different stages in the evolution of
kleptoplasty occurred and derived species are able to
uphold photosynthetic activity better and longer, 3. a correlation of photosynthetic activity and sequestered food
items exists. Testing these hypotheses requires a robust
phylogeny. We therefore developed a phylogenetic
hypothesis for the Sacoglossa based on molecular data.
We present data on photosynthetic rates for 29 species
(186 specimens) representing all major groups within the
Sacoglossa, including three of the four species known for
high photosynthetic activity - Plakobranchus ocellatus
(Indo-Pacific Ocean), E. timida (Mediterranean Sea) and
E. crispata (Caribbean Sea) (Figure 1). Bayesian methods
were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among
extant taxa from nuclear and mitochondrial gene
sequences, and to model the evolution of kleptoplasty
based on new plastid retention data.

Methods
Kleptoplasty may facilitate crypsis because plastids impart
the host's color to the slug (Figures 1 and 2). However, the
chief adaptive value is likely the nutritional benefit of
photosynthetic assimilates released from chloroplasts
into the slug cells [35-39]. This additional energy provided by the plastids may enhance slug survival during
times of algal scarcity, when calcification impedes feeding, or when slugs migrate off of hosts in search of mates,
new habitat patches or sites for oviposition [40,29,41,42].
Past studies indicated that sacoglossans vary widely in
their capacity for photosynthesis [43,38]. However, the
range of methods used to quantify plastid activity
impedes generalization across studies. Using a Pulse
Amplitude Modulated (PAM) Fluorometer, Wägele and
Johnsen [44] demonstrated photosynthetic activity in Plakobranchus ocellatus, Elysia expansa and Thuridilla gracilis
(as T. ratna), but detected no activity in Cyerce nigricans
(Figure 1). Using the same methods over a longer time
period, Evertsen et al. [45] demonstrated long-term retention of chloroplasts in Plakobranchus ocellatus and E. timida, whereas other Elysia spp. and T. hopei lost
photosynthetic activity within a few days (Figures 1 and

Molecular phylogeny of Sacoglossa
A molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Sacoglossa was
undertaken to test conventional systematic groupings
based on morphology (Table 1) [48], and to enable comparative analyses of trait evolution. Cylindrobulla beauii
was designated as the outgroup for the analyses of
Sacoglossa (see [26]).

Sequences for a given species were generated in either
Bonn, Germany or Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. For
phylogenetic analysis, a concatenated dataset was generated from partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16S
rDNA and coxI genes, and a partial sequence of the nuclear
28S rDNA gene. Loci were sequenced for at least two specimens of each species if specimens were available to confirm results for that taxon. In Bonn, some of the new 28S
and coxI sequences were amplified from DNA extracts of
the same specimens used previously by Händeler and
Wägele [26] from which 16S sequences were obtained. All
coxI, 16S and 28S sequences generated in Los Angeles were
from a single specimen of each species. The final data set
consisted of 72 sequences representing 63 nominal species (additional file 1).

Partial sequences of the nuclear 28S rDNA gene were produced in Bonn/Germany by amplifying with primers
28SC1 and 28SD3. Amplification reactions (50 μl) consisted of 39.15 μl ddH2O, 5 μl 10× PCR Buffer without

28SD2R and 28SC2R(C2)* were used if necessary to gain
both strains. Reaction products were sequenced using an
ABI PrismTM 377 DNA Sequencer by Applied Biosystems
or with service of Macrogen inc, Korea.
Partial sequences of the coxI and 16S genes were produced
in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. as described in Ellingson
and Krug [49]. Partial 28S sequences were generated as
described in Krug et al. [50].
Sequences were aligned using the web server of MAFFT
[51,52]. Because different primers were used by our
respective labs to amplify 28S, sequences produced in Los
Angeles were cut to end with sequences produced with
primers 28S1 and 28SD3. The coxI data showed evidence
of mutational saturation at the 3rd codon position, thus
only the 1st and 2nd codon positions were included in phylogenetic analysis. Final length of aligned and concate-

(1st and 2nd position), positions 1680-2117.
Phylogenetic analysis by Bayesian Inference was performed using Metropolis-Coupled Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo methods as implemented in the program BayesPhylogenies [53]. This program uses a mixture model to
accommodate among-site heterogeneity in patterns of
sequence evolution. Parameters are estimated for a userdefined number of general time reversible (GTR) models
of sequence evolution, and the most likely model is
assigned to each position in the alignment. Mixture models should equal or out-perform analyses that assign one
model to all sites in a given gene or codon partition. Our
analyses used three GTR models, each estimating base
composition separately and including a parameter for
gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity (4 rate classes).
Four chains (three heated and one cooled) were run for
2,65 million generations, sampling trees every 1000 iterations of the Markov chain. Based on inspection of log-likelihood scores, the first 1,650 trees were discarded as burnin. From the retained tree sample, a 50% majority-rule
consensus phylogram was constructed with mean branch
lengths in the program BayesTrees, and posterior probabilities calculated to estimate nodal support.
PAM measurements
The additional file 2 provides details of the specimens and
species used in the present study for analysing retention of
chloroplasts. Analyses of photosynthetic activity were performed with a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer
(DIVING PAM, Walz, Germany) by measuring the maximum quantum yield of chlorophyll a fluorescence in photosystem II usually within the first day after collection of
animals from their food algae (with the exception of Plakobranchus and Thuridilla species, where food source is not
known). The fiber optics from the PAM were usually
placed five mm above the animal. Measurements were
taken with chloroplasts acclimated to darkness, thus with
all reaction centres open and a minimal fluorescence
emission. While measuring, an actinic light probe is emitted which induces closure of reaction centres and yields
maximum emission of fluorescence. For further details of
the methods see Wägele and Johnsen [44] and Burghardt
and Wägele [54].

In general three or more measurements per animal per
day were taken at intervals of over 15 minutes to ensure
regeneration of reaction centres and acclimation of chloroplasts to darkness again. Usually animals were kept in
small aquaria with a running through water system (25°C
to 28°C) or water was changed on a daily base. They were
exposed to natural day-night rhythm, but not directly to
the sun. Shading was given by plastic roofs or plastic

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/28

sheaths, which reduced irradiance of the sun (up to 400
μmol quanta per square meter and second), but did not
filter certain spectra of the light [pers. comm. Eva
McClure, Brisbane]. Animals kept in closed rooms were
exposed to sunlight through windows, or light-dark
rhythms were imitated by artificial light sources.
When multiple specimens were available, all specimens
were measured for initial documentation on photosynthesis, but on long term, only the bigger animals were
chosen for analyses, since body sizes below 5 mm yield
less reliable measurements. Mean values were calculated
from daily measurements taken for each specimen. These
values (for individuals) were then pooled to yield a mean
and standard deviation for each species (additional file 3).
Best-fit trendlines were calculated with Microsoft Office
Excel to examine changes in photosynthetic activity over
time. For some species only an initial yield value was
obtained because insufficient specimens were available
for extended measurements.
Reconstruction of ancestral character state
Ancestral character state reconstruction was used to infer
when short-term plastid retention evolved in the
Sacoglossa, and how many independent origins were
likely. Pagel et al. [55] provide a Bayesian method for estimating ancestral states of discrete traits [56], combining
the probability that a node exists with the probability of a
particular state at that node. Continuous-time Markov
models of trait evolution were fit to the data with the program BayesMultistate using the MCMC sample of phylogenetic trees generated as described above. This method
incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty, as the frequency of
a given node in the tree sample limits the statistical confidence in character state reconstructions for that hypothetical ancestor [57,55]. Each taxon for which PAM data were
available was coded as having one of three character
states: non-functional chloroplast retention, short-term
retention (inability to digest chloroplasts), and long-term
retention. Other taxa were coded as missing data if PAM
measurements were not available.

A Markov chain was used to estimate posterior probabilities of distributions of the six transition rates between the
three alternative character states, and to estimate the
ancestral state at each node. A reversible-jump model was
used to obtain priors, with an exponential prior seeded
from a uniform hyperprior on the interval 0 to 30. The ratedev parameter, which determines the magnitude of
changes proposed to rate coefficients, was set to 20 based
on pilot runs. These values gave acceptance rates for
model parameters of about 20%. After a burn-in period of
105 iterations, chains were sampled for rate coefficients
and their associated trees (every 500 generations) to yield
40,000 sampled parameter sets. The posterior probability

Page 6 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:28

distribution of character states was estimated for the node
representing the last common ancestor of the Plakobranchoidea using the "most recent common ancestor"
(MRCA) technique in BayesMultistate. The character state
of this node was then fixed as each of the possible states
in separate runs using the "fossil" command, and a
Markov chain run for 20 million generations as described
above, sampling every 500 generations after the burn-in
period. These procedures were repeated for the last common ancestor of Elysia chlorotica and E. crispata, to determine if these species represent independent origins of
long-term retention or if there was one origin in the ancestor of the clade to which both Elysia spp. belong.
The log of the harmonic mean of the likelihood scores for
successive iterations of the chain was calculated for each
model. Log-Bayes factor (BF) tests were then used to compare the likelihood of models where the ancestral state
was fixed as short-term retention against models where
the ancestral state was fixed as non-retention or long-term
retention. The BF test statistic is twice the difference in the
log-likelihood scores of two models; BF values from 2-5
are taken as positive evidence, while a BF >5 is strong evidence favoring the more likely model [58].

Results
Molecular phylogeny of Sacoglossa
Phylogenetic analysis of three gene regions strongly support monophyly for the two major sacoglossan lineages:
the Oxynoacea, comprising all shelled Sacoglossa, and the
shell-less Plakobranchacea, comprising Plakobranchoidea and Limapontioidea (Figure 3). Within the Plakobranchacea, the group Plakobranchoidea is well resolved
and strongly supported with a posterior probability (PP)
of 0.99. The monotypic family Boselliidae, containing
only the genus Bosellia (Figure 2E), was sister taxon to the
well-supported family Plakobranchidae which includes
the species with parapodia, lateral flaps of the body wall
that cover the dorsum. Each of the three genera in the Plakobranchidae (Elysia, Thuridilla and Plakobranchus) was
monophyletic.

Relationships of the main subgroups of the Limapontioidea were not resolved. Limapontiidae (PP = 0.90) and the
monotypic Costasiellidae (PP = 0.87) were monophyletic
(Figure 3). Only one traditional family, the Polybranchiidae, was not monophyletic in our analysis, due to the
exclusion of the genus Cyerce. The sister taxon of this
"reduced" family was Hermaeidae (Hermaea + Aplysiopsis).
The resulting monophylum was sister taxon to the Plakobranchoidea (PP = 0.72).
PAM measurements
Comparing all available measurements of yield values
throughout the Sacoglossa, three distinct levels of photo-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/28

synthetic activity were distinguished: 1. No functional
retention, with disintegration of chloroplasts within few
hours, resulting in yield values lower than 0.2 on the very
first day of collecting. 2. Short-term functional retention,
with initial yield values above 0.5. These values last for
one or two days, and then drop within seven to 14 days.
3. Long-term functional retention, with yield values of
more than 0.4 even after 20 days.
Members of the shelled group Oxynoacea exhibited no
yield values (Table 3), although ground fluorescence was
high in some cases. High ground fluorescence with no
yield indicates the presence of chlorophyll a, but a loss of
plastid functionality. No species of all four sampled
limapontioidean families exhibited photosynthetic activity, indicating no functional retention of chloroplasts in
Limapontioidea. One potential exception was Costasiella
cf. kuroshimae which had a starting yield value of 0.35,
decreasing to < 0.2 within eleven days (Figure 4). Yield
values, standard deviation and a corresponding trendline
(black line) is shown in comparison to yield values, standard deviation and trendline of Plakobranchus ocellatus
(green line) representing the slug with the highest and
longest photosynthetic activity in this study.
In contrast, all members of Plakobranchoidea had initial
yield values from 0.5 to 0.8 (Figure 5 and 6). Members of
the genus Thuridilla had short-term retention with initial
yield values above 0.5, but their yield decreased to ~0.2
within a few days. Two specimens of T. kathae had equivalent initial yield values but decline in yield varied markedly between individuals (additional file 3). The lowest
initial yield value was obtained for T. hopei (0.4), but its
decline was similar to that of the other Thuridilla spp.
Bosellia mimetica had short-term retention, initial yield
value was 0.56, but yield decreased to less than 0.1 within
nine days. Figure 5 compares the trendlines of the species
of the genus Thuridilla and Bosellia mimetica (blue lines)
with Plakobranchus ocellatus (green line) as reference.

varied greatly in their photosynthetic ability. Many species
(E. bennettae, E. ornata, E. pusilla, E. cornigera, E. tomentosa,
E. viridis and Elysia spec. 1) started with yield values of 0.50.7 immediately after collection, but yields decreased to
<0.4 within one to two weeks. In contrast to most Elysia
spp., E. subornata and E. zuleicae exhibited very low values
directly after collection - 0.24, and 0.38, respectively.
Three species - E. crispata, E. timida and Plakobranchus ocellatus - exhibited greatly prolonged retention of chloroplast
activity (Figure 6). Significant yield values of E. crispata
persisted for 40 days, at which point they had dropped to
0.22. Yield values of E. timida remained >0.52 after 35
days. Maximum retention was measured in P. ocellatus,
which had a mean initial value 0.78 decreasing to 0.59

ble but these were comparable to values for species that
maintained photosynthetic ability for about a week; we
therefore scored such species as having short-term retention, pending additional study.
Ancestral character state reconstructions statistically supported one origin of short-term chloroplast retention, in
the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Plakobranchoidea (Table 4; Figure 7). The posterior probability
that the MRCA had short-term retention was estimated as
89.1% ± 18.0% SD. Models of trait evolution in which the
MRCA was fixed as having short-term retention were
strongly favoured over models in which the MRCA had no
retention (BF test = 7.31), and positively supported over
models in which the MRCA had long-term retention (BF
= 3.92). There were two independent losses of short-term
retention (Elysia zuleicae, E. subornata) (Figure 7).

The closely related Elysia chlorotica and E. crispata both
express long-term chloroplast retention, but feed on very
different host algae. We therefore tested whether longterm kleptoplasty was present in their MRCA or evolved
independently in each species. The posterior probability
of short-term chloroplast retention was slightly higher
than that of long-term retention for the MRCA of E. chlorotica and E. crispata, and models in which their MRCA
was fixed as having short-term retention were supported
over models in which their ancestor had long-term retention (BF test = 4.24) (Table 4). This result supports independent origins of long-term functionality in E. crispata
and E. chlorotica.

cea and Plakobranchacea, confirming the morphological
analysis by Jensen [48]. In the present study, improved
taxon sampling and addition of nuclear gene sequence
data led to the recovery of a monophyletic Oxynoacea, in
contrast to prior molecular analyses based on fewer species and mtDNA alone [26]. Within the Plakobranchacea,
Plakobranchoidea was strongly supported as monophyletic, with the monotypic family Boselliidae as sister
taxon to the Plakobranchidae. Contrary to Jensen [48],
but concordant with Gosliner [59] and Bass and Karl [60],
Plakobranchus and Thuridilla were sister taxa.

Our phylogenetic results indicate that the Caribbean
"Bosellia marcusi" described by Marcus [61] is a derived
species of Elysia. Morphological examination indicates
that the parapodia of "B. marcusi" have secondarily fused
over the dorsum, producing a superficial similarity with
Bosellia [P. Krug, unpublished data].

Monophyly of the cerata-bearing sacoglossans, usually
united as Limapontioidea, was not supported in our
study, instead major limapontioidean groups formed a
polytomy; improved taxon sampling and sequence data
from additional loci may solve this problem. The traditional inclusion of Cyerce in the Polybranchiidae was challenged by our finding of a well supported sister taxon
relationship between Hermaeidae and part of the Polybranchiidae (Polybranchia +Caliphylla +Mourgona); this
merits further attention. The traditional Hermaeidae (Her-

Evolutionary patterns in photosynthetic activity and host use in the Sacoglossa. Information on host algae was
taken from Händeler & Wägele [26], Händeler et al. (unpublished data), Teugels et al. [98], Trowbridge [99]; Krug et al. [100]
and authors' data. Empty square: no-functional chloroplast retention, blue square: functional short-term chloroplast retention,
green star: functional long-term chloroplast retention.

In species with no functional retention, chloroplasts are
phagocytosed by digestive glandular cells and rapidly disintegrate [62,63]. Clark and Busacca [64] concluded that
Oxynoe retains chloroplasts because they were able to isolate chlorophyll from slugs, but they did not detect net fixation of CO2. We measured high ground fluorescence in
oxynoaceans but very low yield values, indicating free
chlorophyll but no functional chloroplasts.
Similarly, all limapontioidean species except Costasiella cf.
kuroshimae had yield values <0.2, indicating no chloro-

plast retention. This confirms studies on Placida dendritica
[62,63] and Aplysiopsis enteromorphae (= Hermaeina smithi)
[65]. We detected initial yield values of 0.3-0.4 for C. cf.
kuroshimae 6-8 hr after collection, whereas the host alga
Avrainvillea gave yield values >0.6, leading to the conclusion that chloroplasts are quickly degraded in C. cf. kuroshimae. A former study based, amongst others, on
ultrastructural analyses reported intact chloroplasts and
carbon-fixation for about 10 days in a specimen of the
congener C. ocellifera starved for two weeks [66], so additional PAM studies on Costasiella spp. are warranted.

Taxa were coded as having non-retention, short-term retention, or long-term retention of functional chloroplasts based on PAM data. The
evolution of kleptoplasty was then modeled using Bayesian Inference via Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the posterior probability
of alternative character states. Posterior probabilities (means ± one standard deviation) were calculated from an MCMC chain run for 20 million
generations. Bayes factor (BF) tests were used to compare log-likelihood scores of models in which the ancestor was assigned one of the possible
character states; values >2 represent positive evidence and values >5 represent strong evidence for models fixing the ancestral state as short-term
retention.

No specimens of Hermaea, a genus of red algae feeders,
were available for PAM measurements. Short-term retention of functional chloroplasts from the rhodophyte Griffithsia flosculosa was reported for H. bifida, based on O2
production and 14C incorporation in slug tissue [67,68],
but experimental methods were not adequately described
[67]. Further studies are therefore needed to assess the fate
of chloroplasts within Limapontioidea.
Short- and long-term functional retention were only
found in the Plakobranchoidea. Chloroplast function was
not detected in Elysia subornata and E. zuleicae from the
Caribbean. Based on ancestral character state reconstruction, these lineages represent independent losses of shortterm retention, which arose once in the plakobranchoidean ancestor. However, an absence of functional chloroplasts may result from several causes (see discussion of
method below), therefore these species should be reinvestigated. Long-term retention was documented for E.
crispata, E. timida and Plakobranchus ocellatus. Our study
shows for the first time that functional retention in E.
crispata lasts up to 40 days, expanding prior studies based
on oxygen production [69,70,37]. We confirmed stable
long-term retention in E. timida, also described by Evertsen et al. [45]. Kleptoplasty may be an ecologically necessity for E. timida as an energy source when algal hosts are
heavily calcified or in short supply [40]. The highest rates
of photosynthesis occurred in P. ocellatus, lasting over a
month with remarkable stability. This is a large species by
sacoglossan standards (up to five cm long), and the subject of prior studies on chloroplast retention [[71], as P.
ianthobapsus, [72], as P. ianthobapsus, [27,45]]. E. chlorotica,
a species best known for its long-term retention, was not
available for PAM measurements but its photosynthetic
ability is well documented [46,73-77].

Given that short-term retention was an apomorphy of the
Plakobranchoidea, there were likely at least four independent gains of long-term function in the derived species
noted above. Ancestral character state reconstructions
returned mild support for two independent origins in E.
chlorotica and E. crispata. The related species E. viridis feeds
on six genera of host algae [C. Trowbridge, pers. comm.]
and may be capable of long-term chloroplast retention
from a subset of those hosts, which warrants future study.
However, when ancestral character state analyses were
rerun coding E. viridis as having long-term chloroplast
functionality, the results were unchanged with respect to
independent origins in E. chlorotica and E. crispata.
We propose that functional chloroplast retention evolved
in two sequential steps. The first step was loss of the ability
to rapidly digest dietary plastids after phagocytosis by
digestive cells. A pre-adaptation for prolonged chloroplast
retention, this step produces short-term functionality
because undigested chloroplasts perform photosynthesis
without support from the (digested) algal nucleus, for as
long as the chloroplasts survive. Many sacoglossan host
algae are large-celled and coenocytic, including numerous
Chlorophyta and the heterokontophyte Vaucheria. Coenocytic algae may require resilient chloroplasts for cytoplasmic streaming or thallus wound-plug formation
(giant-celled and coenocytic Chlorophyta: [78], Vaucheria: [79]). The toughness of chloroplasts may in turn have
facilitated the evolutionary transition to short-term retention in the ancestral plakobranchoidean.
The second requirement for long-term retention is to prolong chloroplast survival by supplying essential proteins
such as components of the light-harvesting complex,
enzymes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, etc. The
encoding genes are normally found in the algal nucleus,
but in at least Elysia chlorotica have entered the slug's

genome by horizontal gene transfer [80,81]. This strategy
is distinct from the reliance on transcriptionally active
nuclei, as occurs in ciliates that incorporate plastids from
cryptophytes [23]. Future research should determine
whether horizontal gene transfer happened once in the
plakobranchoidean ancestor, or if gene transfer happened
independently in each lineage capable of long-term retention. If gene transfer happened early, then the relevant
genes were transcriptionally activated or "switched on"
independently in each of the four species capable of prolonged photosynthetic activity. Genetic analysis of
selected sacoglossan taxa are planned to resolve this issue,
which has fundamental implications for understanding
endosymbiosis and the evolution of chimeric genomes
[82].
A second question is whether short- versus and long-term
retention is dependant on the type of chloroplasts in the
host algae or on some properties of the slugs' digestive
cells that affect how the cells deal with sequestered chloroplasts. To explore possible correlations between mode
of retention and algal type, available data on host use
were mapped onto the cladogram (Figure 7). All members
of the Oxynoacea feed on the genus Caulerpa (Caulerpales) and seem to digest them directly. Several derived
species like E. subornata, E. tomentosa and E. crispata also
feed on Caulerpa and retention of chloroplasts vary within
these species. Feeding experiments with Elysia crispata by
offering different algal speciesresulted in an increased
activity after consumption of Caulerpa verticillata, whereas
consumption of Halimeda opuntia did not contribute to
photosynthetic activity [Grzymbowski & Wägele, unpublished data]. Although E. timida switches from hosts in the
Cladophorales to algae in the Dasycladales during its life
cycle, the chloroplasts inducing long-term photosynthetic
activity apparently originate only from the dasycladalean
Acetabularia acetabulum [41,42]. Newly hatched juveniles
retain chloroplasts from Cladophora dalmatica [42], but
quality of retention has never been investigated.
Long term retention in Elysia chlorotica is based on incorporation of chloroplasts from the heterokontophyte
Vaucheria. Although E. crispata has been reported to consume both Vaucheria and a member of the Dasycladales,
this species feeds principally on a variety of udoteacean
green algae, and the origin of the chloroplasts responsible
for long term photosynthetic activity is presently
unknown [83]. The food of Plakobranchus ocellatus is
unclear [65,72]; DNA barcoding is currently being used to
identify the source of chloroplasts involved in long-term
photosynthesis [Händeler et al., unpublished data].

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/28

Measuring plastid functionality - methodological
considerations
Use of PAM to quantify fluorescence of chlorophyll a in
photosystem II reliably indicates whether chloroplasts are
intact and functional within metazoan tissues. This
method is non-invasive, can be easily applied in the field,
and preserves the subjects for further genetic or histological analyses, including DNA barcoding studies to identify
the source of sequestered chloroplasts. Direct assessment
of chloroplast activity using a standardized method is an
advance over prior work in which alternative methods
were used to study different taxa, and plastid functionality
was often assumed rather than demonstrated. For
instance, Hinde and Smith [84] reported that chloroplast
retention in E. viridis is functional for at least three
months, based on a lone surviving slug (out of 39 specimens) which lost 96% of its body mass over the experimental period. Also, extrapolation of possible survival of
slugs by analysing trendlines should be done with caution
[45]. We do not adhere to previous classifications of photosynthetic activity into six [43] or even eight [45] different (artificial) levels, as the distinction between many of
those proposed levels seems arbitrary according to our
results in the present work.

We emphasize that although our data show trends for species, more detailed studies under standardized conditions
are needed to resolve some remaining methodological
issues. For instance, even when slugs are freshly collected
from their food item, it is unknown how recently they
consumed algal cytoplasm without direct observation of
feeding; thus, only a minimum age can be determined for
sequestered chloroplasts from field-caught specimens. In
some species, photosynthetic activity may vary seasonally
[85,41], geographically [85], or over the course of the life
cycle [86,42]. Investigation of different ontogenetic states
under starving conditions is thus warranted for species
like Elysia subornata and E. zuleicae, to confirm whether the
lack of chloroplast retention is limited to adult stages.
Importantly, it remains to be determined whether chloroplasts of alternative host algae are retained for different
periods of time by sacoglossans such as Elysia crispata, E.
viridis and E. timida [87,25,83,86,88]. PAM studies on
slugs that have fed on different algae are needed to rule
out long-term retention of chloroplasts from a subset of
potential hosts, before firm species-level conclusions can
be drawn.
Additional work is also needed to assess how chloroplast
retention is affected by abiotic factors such as light intensity and temperature [89-91]. Some sacoglossans exhibit
behaviors that minimize exposure to high solar irradiance, which may prolong the activity of functional chloroplasts [91-93]. Parapodia, the lateral body flaps that cover
the dorsum of species in the Plakobranchoidea, may have

initially been an adaptation for shielding chloroplasts to
reduce photosynthesis and, in consequence, production
of toxic levels of intracellular oxygen. This resulted in an
effective shielding of chloroplasts from destructive irradiance, hence prolonging the time of functional photosynthesis within the slugs. Finally slugs may even exert fine
control over the light intensity to which chloroplasts are
exposed by adjusting how far their parapodia are held
open. Plakobranchus ocellatus was observed to roll its body
and lie on the side to further reduce irradiance in bright
sunlight [unpublished data of first and senior author].
Thus, anatomical and behavioral traits may together
enhance the performance and survival of chloroplasts in
different light regimes, and hence optimize the energy
budget of slugs.

enables the slugs to keep chloroplasts alive and protect
them against destructive irradiance. These structures even
allow the selected exposure to different light intensities.
Here we find anatomical as well as behavioral traits that
optimize survival of chloroplasts in different light regimes
and hence optimize energy budget and survival of slugs.
We do not know at the moment how far this also affected
switch to other host organisms and incorporation of "better" chloroplasts. It is evident that Plakobranchoidea,
especially the species rich genus Elysia (> 80 species), have
a broad range of food algae which they exploit (Figure 7).
Future studies comprising the identification of the algal
origin of incorporated functional chloroplasts will reveal
any correlation between host organisms and photosynthetic activity of the slugs.

Conclusion

A second step in kleptoplastid evolution is the prolonged
survival and photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts incorporated into the digestive cells of a slug. According to the
phylogenetic hypothesis we present, this improvement in
plastid retention occurred independently three times in
Elysia and once in Plakobranchus. Although Plakobranchus
is currently a monotypic genus, recent genetic studies
indicate that it in fact comprises a clade of at least eight
recently diverged cryptic species [P. Krug, A. Rodriguez,
and C. Trowbridge, unpublished data] for which photosynthetic abilities have not been investigated so far.

Demonstrating that a key character promoted an adaptive
radiation requires evidence of (1) a rapid burst of speciation, (2) the common ancestry of putative descendant
species, and (3) the phenotype-environment correlation
or trait utility, meaning the performance or fitness advantage of trait values in their corresponding environments
[94]. Short-term retention of functional chloroplasts is a
candidate key character that evolved once in the stemline
of the Plakobranchoidea as has been shown here by comparative analyses. When not immediately digested, incorporated chloroplasts stay functional, hence provide fixed
carbon, even if they degrade gradually over several days.
This spares the slug from the energetic demands of feeding, when food availability decreases due to various ecological reasons (calcification of algae, migration in search
for adequate mating partners, etc.) Kleptoplasty therefore
likely contributed to the evolutionary success of the Plakobranchoidea. This success is evident both in the
number of recognized species in the Plakobranchoidea,
and in the ecological diversity of the group. Plakobranchoidea include more than 130 species and has five times
more species than its putative sister taxon (family Hermaeidae and a part of the Polybranchiidae, see Figure 7)
with about 25 species. Nevertheless, a robust estimate of
the relative rate of speciation in the Plakobranchoidea will
require additional data. Relationship of the Limapontioidea has to be clarified, and sister taxa relation of Plakobranchoidea needs confirmation. Furthermore, to apply
statistical approaches as lineages-through-time plots a
complete tree comprising all known species is necessary.
More complete taxon sampling will be necessary to provide a robust estimate of relative rates of cladogenesis in
different groups, permitting a statistical test of the key
character hypothesis.
Ample studies demonstrate the trait utility of supplemental energy from kleptoplastids (see background). Evolution of parapodia typical only for Plakobranchoidea

Short-term retention may thus have been necessary to
promote an adaptive radiation of the Plakobranchoidea.
Other characters (e.g. host switch) or interactions between
slug and host (e.g. usage of secondary metabolites)
[95,96] may have additionally influenced speciation in
Sacoglossa, and in particular adaptive radiation of the Plakobranchoidea (see also [97]).
After Jensen's [48,29] important first phylogenetic analysis and interpretations based on morphological data, we
contribute here the next steps (molecular phylogeny and
evolution of kleptoplasty). Nevertheless, only additional
studies will clarify what trait combinations drove diversification within the Sacoglossa, and how the relationship
between slugs and their host algae affected the evolution
of this enigmatic opisthobranch taxon.
