Novel molecular markers of Chlamydia pecorum
genetic diversity in the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)
James Marsh, Avinash Kollipara, Peter Timms and Adam Polkinghorne*

Abstract
Background: Chlamydia pecorum is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of reproductive
and ocular disease in several animal hosts including koalas, sheep, cattle and goats. C. pecorum strains detected in
koalas are genetically diverse, raising interesting questions about the origin and transmission of this species within
koala hosts. While the ompA gene remains the most widely-used target in C. pecorum typing studies, it is generally
recognised that surface protein encoding genes are not suited for phylogenetic analysis and it is becoming
increasingly apparent that the ompA gene locus is not congruent with the phylogeny of the C. pecorum genome.
Using the recently sequenced C. pecorum genome sequence (E58), we analysed 10 genes, including ompA, to
evaluate the use of ompA as a molecular marker in the study of koala C. pecorum genetic diversity.
Results: Three genes (incA, ORF663, tarP) were found to contain sufficient nucleotide diversity and discriminatory
power for detailed analysis and were used, with ompA, to genotype 24 C. pecorum PCR-positive koala samples
from four populations. The most robust representation of the phylogeny of these samples was achieved through
concatenation of all four gene sequences, enabling the recreation of a “true” phylogenetic signal. OmpA and incA
were of limited value as fine-detailed genetic markers as they were unable to confer accurate phylogenetic
distinctions between samples. On the other hand, the tarP and ORF663 genes were identified as useful “neutral”
and “contingency” markers respectively, to represent the broad evolutionary history and intra-species genetic
diversity of koala C. pecorum. Furthermore, the concatenation of ompA, incA and ORF663 sequences highlighted
the monophyletic nature of koala C. pecorum infections by demonstrating a single evolutionary trajectory for koala
hosts that is distinct from that seen in non-koala hosts.
Conclusions: While the continued use of ompA as a fine-detailed molecular marker for epidemiological analysis
appears justified, the tarP and ORF663 genes also appear to be valuable markers of phylogenetic or biogeographic
divisions at the C. pecorum intra-species level. This research has significant implications for future typing studies to
understand the phylogeny, genetic diversity, and epidemiology of C. pecorum infections in the koala and other
animal species.

Background
Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens
that are characterised by a biphasic development cycle,
involving the inter-conversion between an extracellular,
metabolically inert form (elementary body, EB) and an
intracellular, metabolically active form (reticulate body,
RB) [1]. With the advent of molecular analyses, the taxonomy of chlamydiae has undergone several revisions [2],
with a recent proposal recognising nine species within
the Chlamydia genus: C. trachomatis, C. muridarum,

Technology, Brisbane, Australia

C. pneumoniae, C. abortus, C. suis, C. felis, C. psittaci,
C. caviae, and C. pecorum [3-5]. For the purpose of this
research paper, we will refer to koala C. pecorum strains
using this proposed nomenclature. While each of these are
responsible for a number of disease states in a wide range
of animals (including humans), the prevalence and transmission of C. pneumoniae and C. pecorum throughout
Australian koala populations has contributed to a significant decline in koala numbers and remain a critical threat
to the koala’s continued survival [6-8].
C. pneumoniae and C. pecorum have been isolated from
most koala populations investigated, with C. pecorum
found to be the most widespread and pathogenic of the

two species [7-10]. Notably, C. pecorum is also recognised
as a pathogen and causative agent of polyarthritis and
abortion in sheep and cattle [11]. In the koala, clinical
manifestations of C. pecorum include ocular infection
leading to conjunctival scarring and blindness, respiratory
tract infection, urinary tract infection causing incontinence, and genital tract infection potentially leading to
infertility [6,7,12-14]. The latter disease signs have been
implicated in lowered reproductive rates in wild koala
populations in several parts of Australia, highlighting the
need to understand this complex host-parasite relationship
for the purpose of effective management and control strategies [8].
Questions remain about the evolutionary origin of
C. pecorum in koalas, given its traditional role as a
pathogen of sheep and cattle, and the modes of transmission within and between geographically isolated
koala populations. In an attempt to understand these
questions, Jackson et al., have previously performed
fine-detailed epidemiological surveys of C. pecoruminfected koala populations, revealing that C. pecorum is
genetically very diverse [7]. This analysis was performed
on short variable domain IV (VDIV) sequence fragments
of the ompA gene, encoding the surface-exposed major
outer membrane protein (MOMP) which is common to
all members of the Chlamydiaceae [15]. There are currently eight ompA VDIV genotypes that have been identified, following several studies of geographically isolated
koala populations in Australia [7,8,14,16,17]. While the
majority of these genotypes are apparently confined to
the koala host, several identical or near-identical
sequences have been found in European sheep and cattle implying the possibility of cross-species transmission
events between these hosts [7].
Questions, however, remain regarding the use of ompA
as a single gene marker of chlamydial diversity. From a
phylogenetic perspective, previous studies in other chlamydial species have demonstrated that ompA phylogenies
are not congruent with the phylogeny of other gene targets, including other membrane proteins [18-20]. Similar
observations have also been made for non-koala strains
of C. pecorum [11,21], indicating that C. pecorum ompA
gene phylogenies are not congruent with the phylogeny
of other targets, nor are they compatible with groupings
based on tissue tropisms or pathobiological profiles.
Diversifying host immune pressure is hypothesised to
cause the C. pecorum ompA gene to evolve more rapidly
than the rest of the chlamydial genome, rendering it
incapable of reflecting the true evolutionary divergence
of C. pecorum [11].
Until recently, the use of alternate molecular markers for
the genetic analysis of koala C. pecorum has been limited
due to the lack of DNA sequences for this species. However, the recent completion of the currently unpublished

C. pecorum genome sequence from the E58 type strain is
allowing investigation into novel and alternative gene targets. Most notably, Yousef Mohamad et al. recently identified several genes that were potentially useful as
C. pecorum markers of virulence and pathogenicity [21].
In the current study, we have utilised the C. pecorum E58
strain genome sequence in the preliminary characterisation of 10 novel gene targets for the purpose of validating
ompA as a fine-detailed genetic and phylogenetic marker
for C. pecorum infections in the koala.
The primary objectives of the present study were to
apply our selected genes to (1) a determination of the
number of major phylogenetic divisions within koala
C. pecorum samples obtained from four distinct koala
populations; (2) the identification of useful fine-detailed
genetic markers to represent these phylogenetic divisions; and (3) a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of lineage divergence between koala and non-koala
hosts of C. pecorum. Overall, this study identifies useful
alternative tools for the future characterisation of koala
C. pecorum infections. Additionally, we present a preliminary appreciation of the phylogenetic diversity of
C. pecorum in koala and non-koala hosts, as a prelude
to future in-depth multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
studies of the C. pecorum phylogeny.

Methods
Chlamydial strains and clinical samples

The ‘type strain’ (MC/MarsBar) utilised for C. pecorum
gene sequencing and analysis was recently isolated and
cultured in our laboratory from a female koala suffering
severe genital tract and ocular disease with chronic cystitis.
The sample originated from Mount Cotton in South-East
Queensland. Swab samples collected from wild koalas
were stored at -80°C prior to DNA extraction.
Selection of candidate molecular marker genes

A total of 10 genes were selected as candidate marker
genes, including two housekeeping genes to serve as analysis controls, five membrane proteins and three potential
virulence genes. The gene candidates included: 16S
rRNA: A housekeeping gene that forms the 16S ribosomal unit; 16S-23S intergenic spacer: A non-transcribed
spacer between 16S and 23S ribosomal sequences [22];
ompA: Encodes the major outer membrane protein
(MOMP) protein, a porin responsible for nutrient transfer, attachment and structural support [23]; omcB:
A cysteine-rich outer membrane polypeptide with functional, structural, and antigenic properties [24]; pmpD:
A polymorphic membrane protein and putative autotransporter peptide [25]; incA: Encodes an inclusion membrane protein engaged in the interactions between the
chlamydial inclusion and cytosolic components [26];
copN: A virulence-related Type III secretion effector [27];

Marsh et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/77

tarP: A translocated actin-recruiting phosphoprotein that
recruits actin at the site of internalisation [28]; MACPF:
The membrane attach complex/perforin protein and a
predicted virulence gene [29]; and ORF663: A hypothetical protein gene whose function is currently unknown
[21]. Overall these genes are functionally diverse and are
widely distributed around the C. pecorum chromosome
(data not shown).
Primers, PCR amplification and sequencing

Primers were primarily based on C. pecorum E58 gene
sequences. To ensure regions of sufficient sequence conservation were targeted, analyses of homologous gene
sequences available from other published chlamydial genomes, including C. trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, C. caviae,
C. felis, C. muridarum, and C. abortus (Table 1), were also
performed.
Amplification of novel gene sequences from our
C. pecorum koala type strain began with the addition of
100 ng of semi-purified MC/MarsBar to a PCR mixture
containing 1X ThermoPol reaction buffer, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Roche), 1 pmol/μL each primer (Sigma; Table 2), and 2 U VentR® DNA polymerase
(New England Biolabs). PCR conditions were a single
cycle of initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes, 30
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 minute, primer
annealing for 1 minute (Table 2), primer extension at
72°C for 2 minutes followed by a final elongation step at
72°C for 10 minutes.
Due to the low quality and quantity of template from
the koala clinical samples, an alternate PCR protocol
was adopted which was optimised for higher specificity
and sensitivity. This was achieved by the addition of
5 μL of DNA extracted from C. pecorum-positive swab
samples to a PCR mixture containing 1X AmpliTaq
Gold 360 10 × buffer, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide
triphosphate (Applied Biosystems), 1 pmol/μL each primer (Sigma; Table 2), and 1 U AmpliTaq Gold 360
DNA polymerase™ (Applied Biosystems). PCR conditions were a single cycle of initial denaturation at 95°C
for 10 minutes, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for
1 minute, primer annealing for 1 minute (Table 2), primer extension at 72°C for 1 minute, followed by a final
elongation step at 72°C for 7 minutes.
PCR products for both assays were separated by gel electrophoresis and visualised using a UV transmilluminator.
Negative controls (dH2O) were included in each amplification round to control for PCR contamination. PCR products were purified with an Invitrogen PureLink™ PCR
purification kit and sent to the Australian Genome
Research Facility (AGRF) for sequencing using the Sanger
dideoxy method [30]. Gene sequence names from each
C. pecorum positive sample were derived from the population from which the koala originated and the ID name

Page 3 of 15

assigned by the veterinarians (i.e. ‘Bre/Ned’ = Brendale
population; animal name ‘Ned’).
Sequence and statistical analysis

Alignments for each sequenced gene were produced
using ClustalW [31] and RevTrans [32] was used to
reverse-translate all alignments. Non-coding genes were
aligned based on their nucleotide sequence.
The software package DnaSP 5.0 [33] was used to analyse the extent of sequence variation by calculating the
number of polymorphic and parsimony-informative
sites, the average nucleotide diversity (p-distance) and
Tajima’s test for neutrality (D-value). The Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) [34] software
package was used to calculate the number of synonymous and non-synonymous sites and subsequent dN/
dS ratio using the Nei-Gojobori method [35]. The discrimination index (D.I.), based on Simpson’s index of
diversity [36], was calculated to determine the differentiating and discriminatory capacity of each gene:
D = 1 − [{ 1/N(N − 1)} ×

ni (ni − 1)]

where D = index of discrimination, N = number of
strains in the sample, and n i = number of strains in
group i. The index ranges from 0 to 1, with a value
close to 0 indicating low genetic diversity and a value
close to 1 indicating high genetic diversity [36]. Calculation of the D.I. requires at least three nucleotide
sequences for analysis.
Criteria for identifying genetic markers

In order to select the most appropriate candidate genes for
further investigation, a shortlist of three genes, ORF663,
incA and tarP (in addition to ompA), were selected based
on their application in previous C. pecorum typing studies
[21], in addition to several empirical criterions: The average proportion of nucleotide distances (p-distance) should
be ≥ 0.02 before intra-species differentiation may be
attempted [37,38], which can be calculated from an alignment containing two or more sequences [39,40]. Furthermore, both highly constrained, slowly-changing molecular
markers and highly variable genes under diversifying selection each have their advantages, disadvantages, and advocates [41], implying the importance of selecting genes
under both positive and negative selection. Finally, the discrimination index (D.I.) for candidate markers should be
> 0.50, which is suggested to be sufficient discriminatory
power for adequate differentiation of bacteria beyond the
species level [42-44].
Koala populations, swab collection and processing

Four distinct Australian koala populations were studied:
East Coomera, Brendale, Narangba, and Pine Creek. The

East Coomera population is located in South-East
Queensland, approximately 54 km south of Brisbane and
is comprised of approximately 500 koalas located in a
1716 ha area of cleared lands with isolated trees and
small patches of native vegetation. The Brendale and
Narangba populations are located among residential
developments on the outskirts of Brisbane and are separated by a busy highway. The Pine Creek population is
situated 20 km south of Coffs Harbour, New South
Wales and consists of approximately 6400 ha of coastal
eucalypt forest interspersed with pockets of rainforest,
pasture and freehold incursions. The Pine Creek population was previously surveyed and was found to have 52%
C. pecorum PCR positivity amongst animals screened [9].
A total of 295 ocular and urogenital swabs were collected from 80 koalas within the four populations. Ethics
approval for the collection of swab samples from koalas
was considered and provided by the QUT Animal

(this work)
[21]

Research Ethics Committee (Approval number
0900000267).
For each sample, vials containing swabs and sucrose
phosphate glutamate (SPG) transport media were vortexed for 30 seconds to release chlamydial bodies from
the swab. 1 mL was transferred to a 1.5 mL eppendorf
tube and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 minutes to
pellet the sample. Following removal of the supernatant,
the pellet was resuspended in 50 μL of SPG transport
media and heated to 100°C for 2 minutes to release the
DNA. Chlamydial DNA was then extracted using the
tissue protocol of the QIAamp DNA kit (Qiagen).
C. pecorum-specific diagnostic quantitative real-time PCR

primers used for initial sequencing of full-length gene from MC/MarsBar/UGT type strain; 2/3 primers used for second-stage sequencing from koala populations
for further analysis; aprimers designed by [7]; bprimers designed by [10]; cprimers designed by [26].

PCR (RT-PCR) targeting a 204 bp fragment of the 16S
rRNA gene.
The RT-PCR assay involved the addition of 3 μL of chlamydial DNA to a PCR mixture containing 1 × Faststart
Taq DNA polymerase reaction buffer (Roche), 0.2 mM
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Roche), 10 μM primers
(RT-Pec.sp-F: 5’-AGTCGAACGGAATAATGGCT-3’, RTPec.sp-R: 5’-CCAACAAGCTGATATCCCAC-3’; Sigma),
0.25 U/μL Faststart Taq DNA polymerase (Roche), and 1X
SensiMixPlus SYBR green (Quantace). All samples were
assayed in triplicate. The MC/MarsBar type strain served
as a positive control while dH2O was used as the negative
control. PCR conditions were an initial denaturation of
94°C for 3 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for
15 seconds, primer annealing at 57°C for 30 seconds, and
DNA elongation at 72°C for 25 seconds. This was followed
by a melting step from 70-90°C. Equal numbers of
C. pecorum positive samples (n = 6) were randomly

selected for further PCR amplification, sequencing, and
analysis.
While incA and ORF663 were amplified and sequenced
as full-length genes, smaller fragments of ompA and tarP
were used for analysis. These included a 465 bp fragment
of ompA that comprises the highly variable VD III and
IV regions which were previously targeted in a range of
phylogenetic and fine-detailed epidemiological studies
[11,21] and a 726 bp highly polymorphic fragment of the
tarP gene.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed under both
distance and maximum-parsimony frameworks. Distance
analyses were performed using the neighbour-joining
algorithm and the Tamura-Nei model of molecular evolution as implemented in MEGA. Maximum parsimony
analyses were conducted by using the tree-bisection and

reconnection method of branch swapping and the heuristic search algorithm of PAUP* version 4.0b. Relative support for individual nodes was assessed by nonparametric
bootstrapping, with 1000 replications of the data. The
pairwise-deletion option was chosen to remove all sites
containing missing data or alignment gaps from all distance estimations. Optimisation of the branch lengths
was done by using the maximum-likelihood method
(using Modeltest to define the evolutionary parameters
[45]), subject to the constraint that all sampled sequences
were contemporary (i.e., molecular clock was enforced).
All rooted trees were constructed with mid-point rooting
to facilitate genotypic comparisons of the outer
topologies.
Genotypic analysis

The ability of each of the shortlisted genes to define
specific genotypes within the koala populations was
assessed, based on the nucleotide dissimilarity of
sequences. To facilitate comparisons with previous
research on koala C. pecorum infections, a similar genotyping approach was adopted where nucleotide dissimilarity > 1% (based on multiple sequence alignments of
all koala strains for each gene) results in a new genotype
[7,8,46]
Recombination

Recombination Detection Program (RDP) was used to
test aligned sequences for recombination. This package
utilises six published methods found to be sensitive for
the identification of recombination and to yield the fewest false-positive findings [19]. The six methods are: RDP
[47], GENECONV [48], Bootscan [49], MaxChi [50], Chimaera [51], and SiScan [52]. Different tests are applied to
aligned sequences by each method to detect potentially
recombinant regions [19]. The null hypothesis is clonality, i.e., that the pattern of sequence variation among the
aligned sequences shows no indication of recombination
[19]. Recombination was deemed to occur in a locus if
clonality was rejected by three or more tests at a significance level of P < 0.001 [19].
GenBank accession numbers of novel sequences

All novel C. pecorum sequences characterised in this study
were submitted to GenBank and are available according to
accession numbers HQ457440 to HQ457545.

Results
PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 10 candidate
molecular markers from the koala C. pecorum type strain
(MC/MarsBar)

Successful PCR amplification of each of the 10 gene loci
was achieved using the primers and conditions outlined
in Table 2. Analysis of the gene sequences for the

Page 6 of 15

selected targets is summarised in Table 3. The ompA,
incA, copN, and ORF663 gene sequences were analysed
in conjunction with previously published C. pecorum
data (Table 1), while the 16S rRNA, 16S/23S intergenic
spacer, omcB, pmpD, tarP, and MACPF genes were
compared with the E58 reference strain as no other data
is currently available for these genes.
In total, 16244 bp of data was analysed which represents 1.62% of the complete C. pecorum genome. The
two housekeeping and non-coding genes, 16S rRNA and
16S/23S intergenic spacer, were sampled to provide a
counterpoint to the coding sequence data and represent
genes under stabilising selection. Across a total of 3548
bp of data from these two genes, only two SNPs were
observed (0.13%).
Analysis of ompA revealed a significantly higher level of
polymorphisms (122), which equated to 10.43% of the
1170 bp gene and a mean diversity of 0.162. Both incA
and ORF663, while possessing fewer individual polymorphisms than ompA (116 and 66 respectively), exhibited a higher percentage of nucleotide diversity at 11.79%
and 11.96% respectively. This equated to a mean diversity
of 0.656 for incA and 0.741 for ORF663. Together ompA,
incA, and ORF663 were the most divergent genes out the
10 investigated. The remaining candidates were significantly more conserved with a five-fold reduction in
nucleotide diversity. TarP exhibited 56 individual polymorphic sites out of 2604 bp (2.15%) for an average diversity score of 0.029, while MACPF was the most conserved
of the coding genes investigated with only seven polymorphic sites (0.30%), resulting in a mean diversity of
0.003.
Within ompA, there were 72 mutations leading to a
change in amino acid (non-synonymous mutations),
representing 59.02% of the total nucleotide diversity for
this locus. The dN/dS ratio for ompA was therefore 0.17,
which correlates with the D-value of 1.73 indicating
ompA’s considerable deviation from neutrality and tendency for negative selection. Interestingly, out of all eight
coding genes investigated, ompA maintained the lowest
percentage of non-synonymous mutations and therefore
the lowest dN/dS ratio. The omcB gene represented the
opposite end of the scale with 87.5% of mutations leading
to an amino acid replacement with a dN/dS ratio of 2.15.
The number of parsimony-informative sites and the
discrimination index (D.I.) were calculated to enable
each locus to be graded according to their discriminatory capacity, however, it is important to note that the
estimates for both tests remain limited due to the
mutual requirement for more than two sequences for
analysis. Nevertheless, ompA had the most parsimonyinformative sites (111 sites), approximately twice as
many as incA (59 sites). These results were slightly
altered when considering the D.I. values as both incA

and ORF663 scored the highest (both 0.98), while ompA
remained at 0.91 and copN at 0.88.
The ompA, incA, tarP, and ORF663 genes are potentially
useful intra-species molecular markers of koala
C. pecorum infections

Based on the defined criteria for selecting fine-detailed
molecular markers (see Materials and Methods), the
omcB, pmpD, MACPF, and copN genes had insufficient
mean diversity and were not selected for further analysis. Conversely, the ompA, tarP, incA, and ORF663
genes were able to satisfy this criterion and in addition,
represent loci under diverse selection processes. Three
of these four genes also offered useful D.I. values, while
the unavailability of additional sequence data for tarP
prevented its calculation. Nevertheless, tarP’s adequate
mean diversity and tendency for negative selection provided an important counterpoint to the highly divergent,
positively-selected incA and ORF663 genes.
Phylogenetic analysis of the ompA, incA, tarP, and
ORF663 genes from clinical samples

The phylogenetic analysis of our four targeted genes was
prefaced with an evaluation of the mean genetic diversity
for each locus based solely on the koala populations, in
comparison with the data generated for non-koala hosts
(Table 3). We observed a decreased level of mean diversity for ompA (p = 0.096), ORF663 (p = 0.065), and incA
(p = 0.016), which is anticipated given the expected contrast between the genetic variation present in our koala
populations and the global samples of C. pecorum from
multiple animal hosts. Interestingly, the tarP gene

produced a comparable figure of p = 0.028. These results
are significant from a global C. pecorum genetic diversity
perspective, but this remains outside the scope of this
study. In the context of the current study, this data
importantly demonstrated that the incA value of p =
0.016 for the koala populations is below the p = 0.02
threshold required for intra-species differentiation.
Examination of the resulting phylogenetic trees revealed
a level of resolution that was consistent with the corresponding gene’s mean nucleotide diversity within the
koala strains (Figure 1). Between each of the four trees
there remained a consistent dissimilarity of branching
orders, each with varying degrees of bootstrap support.
Overall, there was a tendency for ompA and ORF663 to
separate the Narangba and Brendale populations from the
East Coomera and Pine Creek populations, while the tarP
phylogenetic tree provided the most robust evidence for
this distinction (Figure 1). The incA tree revealed less
resolution between C. pecorum positive samples, correlating with its low level of mean sequence diversity and discriminatory power (Table 3).
To create a more comprehensive data set to permit
more robust phylogenetic inferences, sequences for each
of the four genes were concatenated and used in the construction of an additional phylogenetic tree (Figure 2).
This tree produced largely similar groupings to those
described above with the separation of the Narangba and
Brendale populations from the Pine Creek and East Coomera populations, as well as the isolation of the more
divergent C. pecorum positive samples from their respective populations. To test whether the phylogeny resulting
from the concatenated sequence was biased by a single

locus, a subset of trees was built using the concatenated
data with each region omitted. This resulted in no perturbation of the tree topology (data not shown).
In addition, a phylogenetic analysis was performed to
examine the relationship between the koala C. pecorum
samples analysed in this study, and other previously
sequenced strains from non-koala hosts (Table 1).

Initially a tree was constructed using only ompA data
(Figure 3) which clearly shows the koala C. pecorum
sequences grouping with sheep and/or cattle strains
rather than with each other. Subsequently, the sequence
data for ompA, incA, and ORF663 were concatenated
and a single phylogenetic tree constructed. While there
was no visible relationship between geography or body

site of infection, there was a clear separation between
the koala and non-koala strains (Figure 4). As ancestral
relationships are not being inferred between the koala
and non-koala hosts, unrooted phylogenetic trees were
used to illustrate this data.
Genotypic analysis of the ompA, incA, tarP, and ORF663
genes

To highlight the discriminatory power of ompA, incA,
tarP, and ORF663, C. pecorum-specific genotypes were
established based on their level of nucleotide dissimilarity and aligned with the phylogenetic gene trees outlined
above (Figure 1). The ompA gene was able to separate
the koala samples into four genotypes, the incA gene
produced three genotypes, the tarP gene separated the
clinical samples into two genotypes, while ORF663 was
able to discriminate between seven distinct genotypes.
Recombination

Each of the four shortlisted genes (ompA, incA, ORF663,
tarP) was tested for evidence of recombination by the RDP.
All sequences were found to deviate from clonality by all
six recombination tests (P < 0.001), which is consistent
with previous reports regarding ompA and ORF663 [19,53].

Discussion
The current study revealed three novel and significant
characteristics of the evolution and genetic diversity of
C. pecorum infections in the koala: (1) the ompA gene
has a phylogenetic history that is congruent with other
gene targets in the C. pecorum genome, yet is phylogenetically-insufficient for use as a single gene marker; (2)
the tarP and ORF663 genes are potentially useful in
representing C. pecorum genomic diversity and evolution, and (3) koala C. pecorum infections appear to be
monophyletic, possibly suggesting a limited number of
cross-host transmission events between koalas and nonkoala hosts.
The ompA gene is one of the most polymorphic genes
across all Chlamydia species [23] and as a result, was previously selected as the molecular marker of choice in epidemiological and genotyping studies of C. pecorum
infections of the koala. This increased nucleotide diversity
is reported to be due to the antigenicity of MOMP and
the selective pressure of the host’s immune response [54].
Early C. trachomatis studies and more recent C. pecorum
studies suggested that the phylogenetic categorisation of
the ompA gene is not concordant with pathobiotypes, tissue tropisms, or the evolution of the genome as a whole
[7,11,18,20,21]. Based on these findings, the use of ompA
gene as a molecular marker of koala C. pecorum genetic
diversity also required re-evaluation.
Assumptions on the validity of ompA as a genetic
marker for koala C. pecorum strains must be preceded
by an appreciation of the koala C. pecorum phylogeny.
Without in-depth MLST studies to determine the true
C. pecorum phylogeny, this study applied our four genes
of interest (ompA, incA, ORF663 and tarp), to a multilocus approach to phylogeny in an effort to recreate the
most accurate phylogenetic signal (Figure 2) using single
gene targets. Some level of phylogenetic discordance is
expected between these genes given their diverse metabolic function, chromosomal location, possibility for
evolutionary rate heterogeneity and the susceptibility of
all four genes to recombination events. However, this
multi-locus method benefits from a “majority rule”
approach by allowing the amplification of congruous
phylogenetic information while reducing the effects of
phylogenetic “noise”. In addition, the equalisation of
outer branch lengths serves to resolve minor phylogenetic inconsistencies. Together, this results in a more
accurate phylogeny than that inferred from a single gene
[55,56]. There was no perturbation of the tree topology
when each gene was sequentially omitted from analysis,
alleviating concerns that individual genes may dominate
and sweep the phylogenetic signal. It is expected that
the systematic addition of further gene data will continue to produce a more refined and resolute phylogeny,

however we suggest that the phylogenetic tree using
concatenated sequences of ompA, incA, ORF663, and
tarP provides a preliminary and useful indication of the
true phylogenetic relationship between these koala
C. pecorum samples and a prelude to future MLST and
phylogenetic studies.
The phylogenetic tree generated from concatenated
data clearly defines two distinct lineages between the
four populations investigated: (1) the Pine Creek and
East Coomera populations (separated by ~500 kms), and
(2) the Narangba and Brendale populations (separated
by ~5 kms), while each lineage is further subdivided
into two clades, each representing an individual population. From an evolutionary standpoint, this phylogenetic
reconstruction appears valid. For example, it is clear

that the Brendale and Narangba populations remain
geographically (and genetically) similar, as do the East
Coomera and Pine Creek populations, albeit to a lesser
degree. The genetic diversity and uniqueness of geographically isolated C. pecorum strains is presumably the
result of disturbances to koala population distribution
and structure from land clearing and urban pressure
over the last 200 years of European settlement, leading
to the formation of isolated koala colonies in which
C. pecorum strains continue to undergo local selection
and adaptation. The question that remains is how effective are the four shortlisted genes in abbreviating this
vast phylogenetic information for epidemiological study?
Beginning with ompA, previous C. pecorum studies
suggest that this gene is reflective of the overall evolution

of the C. pecorum genome [7,23], however these studies
are based on broad comparisons between chlamydial species and do not represent evolutionary lineages on
an intra-species level. Alternatively, intra-species C. trachomatis studies have indicated that the ompA locus differs from other regions of its genome [19]. The results of
the present study illustrate a tendency for the phylogenetic topology of the ompA gene to separate the Narangba/Brendale populations from the Pine Creek/East
Coomera populations while other, more divergent strains
do not cluster according to their respective population.
This data would appear to correlate with previous
C. pecorum fine-detailed epidemiological studies where it
was concluded, using the ompA gene, that an association
between the site of koala capture and the genotype of its
resident C. pecorum strain usually exists, while some genotypes were distributed widely into different geographic
areas [7]. The phylogenetic divisions offered by the tree
using concatenated sequences, however, clearly show
that regions of the ompA gene are actively contributing
to a misinterpretation of the “true” phylogenetic signal.
This observation supports previous conclusions that
ompA is ineffective as a genome-representative marker. It
is therefore suggested that while the ompA gene

continues to be a useful fine-detailed comparative marker, it remains suboptimal for any phylogenetic, evolutionary and/or biogeographic analysis. Both the tarP and
ORF663 genes, conversely, are appealing alternatives to
ompA.
The tarP gene encodes the translocated actin-recruiting phosphoprotein [57] which has important virulent
functions involved in the attachment of the chlamydial
elementary body to the host cell [28]. The tarP gene’s
tendency for negative selection and relatively low mean
nucleotide diversity reinforces its important biological
role in the chlamydial cell and typifies a gene that
changes slowly enough to make it useful as an evolutionary chronometer [41]. Recent C. trachomatis studies have
suggested that the full-length tarP gene, based on the
inverse relationship between the number of tyrosine
repeats and the number of actin-binding domains, can be
correlated with clinical phenotype [58], highlighting its
potential as a useful genetic marker.
The koala C. pecorum tarP gene phylogenetic tree produced two distinct clades which, interestingly, revealed a
clear separation between the Brendale and Narangba isolates and the Pine Creek and East Coomera isolates. Initially, there appeared to be no distinction between ocular

Marsh et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/77

and urogenital sites of infection, however upon further
inspection, it was clear that (with the exception of Nar/
Dion (Left Eye)), all the ocular isolates remained confined
to one phylogenetic clade (among seven urogenital isolates) which are distinct from the remaining urogenital
isolates. Importantly, this ocular “outlier” (Nar/Dion (Left
Eye)) retains 100% nucleotide similarity with the remaining isolates within the Narangba population, all of which
were isolated from urogenital sites of infection. Coupled
with the fact that isolate ‘Ned’ from the East Coomera
population harbours genetically distinct ocular and urogenital isolates of C. pecorum, this suggests that high
rates of transmission within these confined koala populations may contribute to the transfer of C. pecorum from
one body site to another and that the site of detection
may not be the original niche of the strain [58]. It appears
that the tarP gene has potential as a phenotypic-dependent marker, however, importantly, further investigation
is required that utilises the full-length tarP gene (in conjunction with wider geographic sampling) to properly
determine its true potential.
From a full genome evolutionary standpoint, the
separation of the Brendale/Narangba populations from
the Pine Creek/East Coomera populations is a distinction that is clearly mirrored in the overall phylogenetic
analysis using concatenated data. This suggests that
tarP, although having a relatively low rate of substitution, is capable of more accurately and specifically differentiating koala strains according to geography than
ompA and ORF663, albeit with reduced resolution. For
these reasons, tarP also appears promising as an evolutionary indicator and may be classified as a “neutral
marker”, characterised by its selective constraints yet
ability to reflect sequence diversity between koala populations that are geographically separate [59]. However,
as a “neutral marker”, the tarP gene remains less useful
when estimating a population’s adaptive potential or
local population divergence.
ORF663 encodes a hypothetical protein and includes a
15 nucleotide variant coding tandem repeat (CTR) region
that putatively associates it with a virulence-related role.
Interestingly, this gene has not been identified in any
other chlamydial species and BLAST search reveals no
similarities to any other sequences in the database. The
C. pecorum ORF663 gene was the most polymorphic
gene among all investigated and represents a locus under
considerable positive selection. Using this gene, we were
able to observe the most distinctions between strains by
identifying seven separate genotypes. These genotypes
highlight the considerable discriminatory capacity of
ORF663 which correlates with (while extending) the divisions made by ompA and tarP, by isolating the Narangba
and Brendale populations into their own genotypes while
separating the more heterogeneous Pine Creek and East

Page 12 of 15

Coomera populations into multiple genotypes. Where
the tarP gene represents a neutral marker that assumes
isolates within a population are equally related to each
other, ORF663 can be considered a “divergence-based” or
“contingency” marker that is capable of characterising
diversity both within and between populations for finedetailed epidemiological study.
The value of the marker genes identified in this study
was extended to consider the genetic diversity between
C. pecorum infections in koalas and non-koala hosts. Previous research has suggested that, supported by ompA
VD3/4 sequence data, C. pecorum is a polyphyletic
organism in Australian koala populations. This hypothesis originated from the similarity of one or two koala
ompA genotypes to European bovine isolates of
C. pecorum [7,11] and based on this data, a model was
proposed whereby koalas obtained C. pecorum infections
as a result of a series of cross-species transmission events
from sheep and/or cattle [7,8,11,60]. While similar results
were obtained using ompA data in this study (Figure 3),
the phylogenetic analysis has already suggested in inadequacy of the ompA gene alone in representing C. pecorum’s true evolutionary course within koala populations.
Indeed, both this and previous studies utilised a 465 bp
fragment of the ompA locus (VD 3/4) which, while containing the majority of ompA’s nucleotide variation,
would remain largely insufficient to describe the extensive genetic diversity that has accumulated in global isolates of C. pecorum.
Consequently, we prepared an unrooted phylogenetic
tree from the concatenation of incA, ompA, and ORF663
sequences, revealing a surprising alternative picture that
clearly distinguishes koala C. pecorum strains from nonkoala hosts (Figure 4). This distinction is further supported by the noticeable difference in branch lengths
between koala C. pecorum sequences and non-koala
hosts, suggesting that as a whole, koala strains are much
more closely related to each other than to other nonkoala host strains. This result is significant as it may be
an example of an alternate evolutionary model in which
koalas obtained C. pecorum as a result of a limited number of cross-host transmission events in the past and
have subsequently evolved along an evolutionary trajectory that is distinct from that seen in sheep and cattle
isolates. This result also reinforces the benefit and efficacy of applying more phylogenetically-robust data (the
concatenation of three congruent genes) to the epidemiological study of C. pecorum infections, both in koala and
non-koala hosts. It must be noted however, that this
remains a cautionary finding. Without ompA, incA, and
ORF663 nucleotide sequences from Australian sheep and
cattle isolates it remains impossible to truly establish a
compelling cross-host transmission hypothesis for koala
isolates. Nevertheless, this data cannot be completely

Marsh et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:77
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/77

discounted and functions as preliminary insight into the
genetic diversity of koala isolates of C. pecorum.

Conclusions
The findings of this study have highlighted the opportunities and drawbacks of estimating phylogenetic relationships from multiple independent datasets [61].
A concatenation approach to phylogenetic inference
appears promising, however a true evolutionary reconstruction of the C. pecorum lineage may require a rigorous MLST approach that incorporates genetic data from
several more independent loci and extensive geographic
sampling.
It is clear that the ompA gene is distorted by technical
and biological interference rendering it incapable of representing true phylogenetic divisions as a molecular marker,
yet it remains useful as a fine-detailed, cost-effective, comparative marker for fine-detailed epidemiological investigation of large numbers of koala C. pecorum positive
samples. Alternatively, the tarP gene’s ability as a “neutral
marker” to provide a “bird’s-eye-view” on higher levels of
evolutionary divergence between koala populations and
ORF663’s opportunities as a contingency marker are promising for future phylogenetic studies in the koala.
While three out of our four shortlisted genes (including
ompA) proved to be effective gene markers, incA was
ultimately deemed to be the least effective and was discarded from further analysis. However, the significant
discrepancy noted between the mean diversity of incA
from koala and non-koala hosts (as well as ORF663)
invites intriguing questions regarding the genetic diversity of C. pecorum beyond the koala host which, while
outside the scope of this study, will be important in subsequent research in this area.
Although this study focussed on a mere 10 genes in
the C. pecorum genome, it successfully challenged ompA
as a molecular marker and provided an important
opportunity to review previous knowledge on the
genetic diversity of C. pecorum in Australian koala
populations. The availability of the complete E58
C. pecorum genome sequence and, eventually, a koala
C. pecorum genome, will facilitate the characterisation
of additional genes and promote further analyses of
genomic variation to support comprehensive surveys of
lineage prevalence within and between koala populations. Until then, the data described here provides a
solid foundation for this subsequent research by highlighting a robust measurement tool for koala C. pecorum
infections and presents a compelling depiction of their
phylogenetic relationships. This application will have
importance for our ability to successfully map, control
and manage diseased populations of this dwindling
native icon.
