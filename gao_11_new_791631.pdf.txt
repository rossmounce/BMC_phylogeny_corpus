New methods to measure residues coevolution
in proteins
Hongyun Gao1,2, Yongchao Dou1,2, Jialiang Yang3 and Jun Wang4,5*

Abstract
Background: The covariation of two sites in a protein is often used as the degree of their coevolution. To quantify
the covariation many methods have been developed and most of them are based on residues position-specific
frequencies by using the mutual information (MI) model.
Results: In the paper, we proposed several new measures to incorporate new biological constraints in quantifying
the covariation. The first measure is the mutual information with the amino acid background distribution (MIB),
which incorporates the amino acid background distribution into the marginal distribution of the MI model. The
modification is made to remove the effect of amino acid evolutionary pressure in measuring covariation. The
second measure is the mutual information of residues physicochemical properties (MIP), which is used to measure
the covariation of physicochemical properties of two sites. The third measure called MIBP is proposed by applying
residues physicochemical properties into the MIB model. Moreover, scores of our new measures are applied to a
robust indicator conn(k) in finding the covariation signal of each site.
Conclusions: We find that incorporating amino acid background distribution is effective in removing the effect of
evolutionary pressure of amino acids. Thus the MIB measure describes more biological background information for
the coevolution of residues. Besides, our analysis also reveals that the covariation of physicochemical properties is a
new aspect of coevolution information.

Background
A protein’s function depends on its three-dimensional
(3D) structure and interactions of residues [1]. When
there is a mutation of functionally or structurally important residues, compensatory mutations may occur to
preserve or restore the function or structure of the protein. Thus the knowledge of residues coevolution helps
to predict protein function and guide experimental analysis. To quantify the coevolution of a protein chain, a
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the chain and its
homologous sequences are generated at first. Then the
covariation of two sites is used as the degree of their
coevolution.
In order to quantify the covariation of two sites in a
given MSA, many computational methods have been
developed in recent years. These methods can be
divided into two groups: parametric methods and

nonparametric ones [2-14]. The parametric methods
incorporate maximum likelihood approximations [15],
Bayesian probabilities [16], Phylogentic approaches [17]
and so on. While nonparametric methods are more
extensive and most of them are based on mutual information (MI). The MI model is taken from information
theory [18], and uses the position specific distribution of
two sites [19-21]. For example, [6] tested the effect of
the size of MSAs and the mutation rate on two sources
of background (finite sample size effects and phylogenetic influence). They also tested the performance of
various normalizations of MI in enhancing the detection
of coevolving sites. To integrate different biological constraints with the MI model, some methods focused on
how to relate observation counts to expected distribution [22-24]. However, [25] pointed out that none of the
estimates are more ‘correct’ than others since all the
methods merely depend on assumptions. And it has
been shown that the estimates of MI are more affected
by these assumptions than by the actually observed data.
The ‘correct’ conditional assumptions refer to the

assumptions strictly matching known biological constraints. Another widely used nonparametric method is
ELSC which applies a perturbation-based method to calculate explicitly the likelihood of evolutionary covariance
in MSAs [26]. Although many biological constraints
have been used in measuring covariation, the amino
acid background distribution and their physicochemical
properties are ignored in previous methods.
In order to improve covariation measures, two new
biological constraints are introduced in the paper. The
first constraint is the amino acid background distribution which indicates the evolutionary pressures of amino
acids. It has been proved that if a residue is under relatively low evolutionary pressure, it will be readily
replaced in the evolutionary history. Thus this residue
will have relatively low frequency in an MSA and vice
versa. In general, the frequency of a residue can be used
as an estimate of its evolutionary pressure and is often
called the background frequency of the residue [27]. A
residue background distribution is called ‘no pressure’ if
it can describe the distribution of amino acids subject to
no evolutionary pressure [28]. Actually, it depicts evolutionary pressures for each residue exactly. However, it is
difficult to estimate the ‘no pressure’ background distribution. Thus statistical background usually provides an
alternative to approximate it. As suggested by several
existing conservation measures, the BLOSUM62 background distribution [29] is used as the amino acid background distribution in the paper. By incorporating
amino acid background distribution into account, we
proposed a new method MI with amino acid background distribution (MIB).
The second constraint to improve covariation measures is the physicochemical properties which are
important in predicting functional important residues
[30-36]. In order to incorporate the physicochemical
properties into the MI model, amino acids are often
grouped into six disjoint groups or ten overlapping
groups in previous works [37]. In the study, the classification of ten overlapping groups of amino acids is chosen since six disjoint groups has a deficiency that
residues of different types are treated equally different.
Then, a new method called the MI with physicochemical properties (MIP) is developed to estimate the variation of physicochemical properties of two given sites.
The third model is called MIBP method which is used
to estimate the covariation of physicochemical properties by removing their background distributions. Moreover, our measures are applied to a robust indicator
conn(k) [23] in finding covariation signal of each site.

Methods
Since the reliability of MI values depends on that of
MSA, the quality of MSA is important in measuring the

covariation. In the paper, MSAs are downloaded from
the PFAM [38] data base. And the number of sequences
in an alignment should be greater than 125 [6]. Given
an MSA, sequences in it are clustered at 90% sequence
identity and the redundant sequences are removed.
Moreover, the columns with more than 25% gaps are
also removed as suggested by [23]. Gaps are also
ignored when position specific frequencies are calculated. Moreover, these proposed methods are also tested
on a recently published data set which was created by
Capra and Singh (2007) [28]. MSAs in the data set with
lower than 125 sequences are removed. After filtering,
496 MSAs remained and results on them can be found
in the supplement material. Throughout the paper, we
use N to denote the number of sequences in the MSA
and c_pair (K,L) to denote the pair of column K and
column L used to calculate the MI based measures.
The MI model with the amino acid background
distribution (MIB)

An ordering is first specified to the 20 amino acids.
Given an MSA, the amino acid position specific frequency of a column K for the ith residue is calculated
as:
p(K i ) =

count(K i )
,
N

where count(Ki) denotes the number of the ith (i = 1,
..., 20) residue in column K.
Similarly, the joint probability distribution of c_pair
(K,L) for a residue pair consisting of the ith and jth residue is defined as:
p(K i , Lj ) =

count(K i , Lj )
,
N

where count(Ki, Lj ) denotes the number of rows, in
which the residues in column K and L are the ith and
jth residue, respectively.
Based on the above definitions, the classical MI [18] is
calculated as:
20

20

p(K i , Lj ) log

MI(K, L) =
i=1 j=1

p(K i , Lj )
.
p(K i ) · p(Lj )

Clearly, if p(Ki , Lj ) = 0, then the value of the monop(K i , Lj )
mial p(K i , Lj ) log
is 0. Moreover, if one colp(K i ) · p(Lj )
umn in a column-pair is fully conserved, then M I (K,
L) = 0. As suggested by [6], we further normalize M I
(K, L) by H (K, L), and define
MI (K, L) =

MI(K, L)
,
H(K, L)

where H(K, L) = −

j

j

p(K , L ) log p(K , L ).
i=1 j=1

In order to account for the background distribution of
amino acids, we introduce the marginal distribution,
which is defined as:
p(K )
qi
pb (K i ) = 20
,
p(K m )
m
m=1 q

where q is the BLOSUM62 amino acid background
distribution. Then a new estimation of covariation called
the MI with the amino acid background distribution
(MIB) is defined as:
20

20

p(K i , Lj ) log
i=1 j=1
i

p(K i , Lj )
.
pb (K i ) · pb (Lj )

j

Similarly, if p(K , L ) = 0, then the value of the monop(K i , Lj )
mial p(K i , Lj ) log
is considered as 0.
pb (K i ) · pb (Lj )
In addition, we also normalize MIB(K, L) by H(K, L)
and define a new measure MIB’,
MIB (K, L) =

MIB(K, L)
.
H(K, L)

MIB’ is sometimes referred to as the normalized MIB.
The covariation of physicochemical properties

To measure the covariation of amino acid physicochemical properties, amino acids are grouped into ten overlapping groups as suggested by Taylor [37]. The ten
overlapping groups are: hydrophobic (A, G, C, T, I, V,
L, K, H, F, Y, W, M), aromatic (F, Y, W, H), aliphatic (I,
V, L), tiny (A, S, G, C), small (P, N, D, T, C, A, G, S, V),
proline (P), charged (K, H, R, D, E), negative (D, E),
polar (N, Q, S, D, E, C, T, K, R, H, Y, W) and positive
(K, H, R). In this section, we use g_pair(a,b) to denote
the group pair, in which the former residue belongs to
group a and the latter residue belongs to group b.
Then, the fractional frequency of group a in column K
is defined as:
pp (K a ) =

count(K a )
,
N

where count(Ka) is the number of residues belongs to
group a in column K.
The joint property distribution of c_pair (K,L) for
g_pair(a,b) is defined as:
pp (K a , Lb ) =

count(K a , Lb )
,
N

pp (K a , Lb ) log

MIP(K, L) =
a=1 b=1

pp (K a , Lb )
.
pp (K a ) · pp (Lb )

a

i

MIB(K, L) =

where the count(Ka, Lb) is the number of residue-pairs
belonging to g_pair(a,b).
We define a new measure of covariation as:

If the p p (K , L b ) = 0, the value of the monomial
pp (K a , Lb )
is 0. If one column of the
pp (K a , Lb ) log
pp (K a ) · pp (Lb )
column-pair is fully conserved, the value is also 0. The
measure is referred to as the MI of physicochemical
properties (MIP) and the normalized MIP is defined as:
MIP (K, L) =

MIP(K, L)
,
Hp (K, L)
10

10

Where Hp (K, L) = −

pp (K a , Lb ) log pp (K a , Lb ).
a=1 b=1

Moreover, amino acid physicochemical properties are
also incorporated to the MIB model. The modified marginal fractional frequency of group a in column K is
defined as:
pp (K a )
qp a
pbp (K a ) = 10
.
pp (K m )
m
m=1 qp

Here, qp is the background distribution of physicochemical properties which is based on the BLOSUM62
amino acid background distribution.
Similarly, the covariation of the c_pair(K,L) is calculated as:
10

10

pp (K a , Lb ) log

MIBP(K, L) =
a=1 b=1
a

pp (K a , Lb )
.
pbp (K a ) · pbp (Lb )

b

If p p (K , L ) = 0, the value of the monomial
pp (K a , Lb )
is considered as 0. The
pp (K a , Lb ) log
pp (K a ) · pp (Lb )
measure is referred to as the MIP with the physicochemical properties background distribution (MIBP) in
the paper. And the normalized MIBP is defined as:
MIBP (K, L) =

MIP(K, L)
.
Hp (K, L)

The measures MI’, MIB’, MIP’ and MIBP’ are used to
quantify covariation in the paper.
conn (k) is a more robust indicator than individual
covariation score

It has been proved that individual MI values may be
misleading [39]. In order to improve individual scores,

[23] introduced an indicator conn(k) to characterize
individual residues. In the paper, the top 75 high-scoring
pairs are taken into account. And the cut-off of conn(k)
is 5 in MI’, MIB’ and a comparing method ELSC. While
in MIP’ and MIBP’, since there are ten groups, we take
the top 25 high-scoring pairs and the cut-off of conn(k)
is 3. Throughout this paper, we use conn(k)-name to
denote the conn(k) score of the ‘name’ method. For
example, conn(k)-MI’ denotes the conn(k) score of MI’.

Results and Discussion
In order to compare our new methods with existing
ones, all chosen methods, namely MI’, H2r, ELSC, MIB’,
MIP’ and MIBP’ are tested on four MSAs. The first one
is a toy MSA is shown in Table 1 with 6 sequences and
each sequence has 6 residues. Others are commonly
used protein families in comparing coevolution methods, which include 1JXA-A, 1B93-A [28] and PF01053
protein family. We use 1QGN to denote the related protein sequence of PF01053. Results on these MSAs are
shown in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 and Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6[40]. However, ELSC is not applied to PF01053,
for the method suffers an arithmetic overflow when
sequence number is too large.
Comparison of different methods on a toy MSA

In order to illustrate the effects of new biological constraints, we generate a toy MSA, which is shown in
Table 1. In the MSA, column 1 and 2 are fully conserved which are used to illustrate the effect of the
amino acid background distribution; column 3, 4 and 5
are used to illustrate the differences between the MIP’
and MIBP’ methods; and column 6 is randomly generated. We then ran and compared all the methods on the
toy MSA, and the results are listed in Table 2. For convenience, a pair of columns A and B is represented by
c_pair(A,B) in the study.
In this section, MI’ and MIB’ are compared to show
the effect of incorporating amino acid background distribution. For column-pairs with one column fully conserved, such as c_pair(1,3), c_pair(1,4) and c_pair(1,5),
the MI’ scores are 0, while MIB’ can distinguish them

with different scores 0.138, 0.237 and 0.141, respectively.
When the first column is fully conserved, the joint frequency of c_pair(1,K) is equal to the observed frequency
of the residue represented by column K. On the other
hand, the observed distribution of residues in column K
is used as the marginal distribution, therefore the MI’
score of c_pair(1,K) is 0. However for MIB’, the marginal distribution is the observed distribution modified
by the amino acid background distribution, thus, the
MIB’ scores of these column-pairs are distinguishable.
For example, the MI’ score of c_pair(1,6) is 0 while it is
0.003 for MIB’. Although the difference between 0 and
0.003 is not significant, it reveals that MI’ and MIB’ are
essentially different. In general, the MI’ scores of column-pairs with one fully conserved column are 0, while
the MIB’ method can distinguish them unless both columns are conserved. This is because that the marginal
distribution used in the MIB’ methods has been modified by the amino acid background distribution. In addition, the columns which are paired with the same
column and get equal MI’ scores, such as the c_pair
(3,6), c_pair(4,6) and c_pair(5,6), are also distinguishable
in MIB’. Although the distributions of column 3, 4 and
5 are the same in number, the type of amino acids are
different. The result uncovers that the amino acid background distribution is meaningful in measuring the relationship between columns. For column-pairs with fully
covariant columns, the MIB’ scores might be different.
For example the MIB’ scores for c_pair(3,4), c_pair(3,5)
and c_pair(4,5) are 1.375, 1.279 and 1.378, respectively.
Different from methods based on amino acid frequencies, the MIP’ measure is based on amino acids physicochemical properties. In detail, the MIP’ values of c_pair
(4,5), c_pair(4,6) and c_pair(5,6) are 0.077, 0.037 and
0.053, respectively, while the MI’ scores are 0.296. Table
2 shows that the covariation of physicochemical properties of c_pair(4,5) is stronger than that of c_pair(4,6) and
c_pair(5,6), while they are equivalent by MI’. Similar
results can be found in the comparison of MIP’ and
MIBP’. Table 2 also shows that the MIP’ score is 0 if one
column in the pair is fully conserved while this scenario
doesn’t appear under the MIBP’ measure. It worths noting that the score of c_pair(1,2) is 0 under the MI’, MIB’
and MIP’ measures since these two columns are fully
conserved. However, MIBP’ can estimate the covariation
of them and gives a score 33.425 to the column-pair.
Another interesting observation is that: although column
3 is not fully conserved, the ten overlapping classifier can
not distinguish W and Y. Thus the column with the fully
conserved properties leads to a MIP’ score of c_pair(3,K)
0. So do G and A, I and L [30]. In contrast, under the
MIBP’ measure, these pairs can be distinguished due to
the modification of marginal distribution by the background distribution of physicochemical properties.

The effect of incorporating amino acid background
distribution

In order to test the effect of incorporating amino acid
background distribution, MIB’ is compared with MI’
and H2r on the PF01053 protein family. We plot the
relatively high conn(k)-MIB’ scored sites in Figure 5 and
list the detailed information in Table 3. Table 3 shows
that the differences among MIB’, MI’ and H2r are
obvious. For example, the highest conn(k)-MIB’ site is
site 389, while that of MI’ and H2r is site 388.
In addition, the number of the sites with conn(k)MI’>= 5 is greater than that of MIB’ and H2r. Moreover,
site 389, a functional important site, gets the highest
conn(k)-MIB’, but its conn(k)-H2r value is less than 5. It
is already known that in the models of the substrate
tCGS (cystathionine g-synthase from Nicotiana tabacum) complex (1QGN) [41], the movement of O3’ from
a mainly hydrophobic environment, arounds site 389
(Phe). Furthermore, sites 239 (Phe) and 211 (Asn),
which are essential for maintaining functional environment, are ranked as the first and third sites interlinked
with site 389 by the MIB’ method. As shown in Figure
2, sites, which get have relatively high MIB’ scores with
site 389, form a network around it. It demonstrates that
strongly covariation sites surround important functional

domains to make a compensatory effect to maintain the
function of the protein, a conjecture being validated by
many case studies [5,13,39]. These case studies are also
tested on the 1B93-A family and the general results are
similar.
Besides H2r and MI’, MIB’ was also compared with
the ELSC method proposed by [26]. ELSC uses a perturbation-based algorithm for calculating explicit likelihood
of subset covariance, however the background distribution is also ignored. ELSC and MI’ are similar since the
background distribution is not taken into account for
both methods. As shown in Table 4, the sites with high
conn(k)-MIB’ and those of ELSC are different. Only site
329 is predicted by both methods. Besides, the sites with
high conn(k)-MIB’ scores are mostly in the N terminal
while that of ELSC are dispersed. On the 1B93-A family
the ELSC shows no significant advantage over other
methods. Moreover, it suffers arithmetic overflow when
sequence number of the MSA is too large. In general,
these results suggest that incorporating amino acid
background is very important in measuring coevolution.
Coevolution of amino acid physicochemical properties

In contrast to previous methods which consider amino
acids as symbols in a uniformly diverse alphabet, MIP’
and MIBP’ try to account for amino acid physicochemical properties. As shown in Table 3, the sites predicted
by MIP’ and MIBP’ are different to those by MI’ and
MIB’. The highest conn(k)-MI’ site is site 388, while
that of MIP’ and MIBP’ is site 265 and 236, respectively.
In addition, some sites predicted by MIP’ and MIBP’ are
also predicted by MI’, but not by MIB’. These results
demonstrate that the classification of amino acids and
physicochemical properties are different in depicting the
MSA. Moreover, site 236 and 261 in PF01053 family,
site 504, 481, 485 and 603 in 1JXA-A family, and site 19

and 91 in 1B93-A family are catalytic residues. It means
that there are physicochemical properties based networks to maintain the catalytic environment or support
the catalytic process.
An in-depth analysis on PF01053 family is also given
to show the performances of MIBP’. It has been proven
that the carboxylate OD2 of site 236 stabilizes the positively charged pyridine nitrogen of PLP [41]. Site 261
takes its role in catalysis by tCGS named ping-pong
mechanism in the first and final steps. They coevolve to
maintain specific physicochemical environment stabilization in or around the active region. As shown in Table
4, the high conn(k)-MIBP’ scored sites are in the Nterminal of the sequence while that of the MIP’ are in
the C-terminal. It demonstrates that the results are
affected by background distribution significantly. Moreover, four of five catalytic residues are highly scored in
the 1JXA-A family and the related structure [42]. Catalytic sites are located in the N-terminal half of the
domain at the carboxyl edge of the b-sheet. And the
sites with high conn(k)-MIBP’ scores are in the isomerase domain of GlmS (248-608) which is responsible for
the binding of Fru6P and its conversion to GlcN6P.
However site 504 is separated to other high scoring sites
in space. In [43], it was shown that residue 504 plays a
key role in the sugar ring opening on a different polypeptide chain. A Schiff base with residue 603 is formed
and it is replaced by the incoming ammonia in the
Schiff base. It also indicates that the mutation of residue
603 from Lys to Arg results in a decreasing of the
synthase activity and an increasing of the isomerase
activity. Site 485 forms H bond with the hydroxyl
groups of the sugar.
To compare with the conservation information, the
JSD method [28] is used to rank the degree of sites in
the 1JXA-A family at different identity thresholds and

the related results are shown in the supplement material
(Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4). As shown in Table 6, the
sites with high conn(k) scores are not highly scored by
the JSD. Among the sites predicted by MI’, only sites 86
and 84 are in the top ten of the JSD rank. And in the
MIB’, the sites are less conserved than MI’. Moreover,
for MIP’ and MIBP’, although the sites are relatively
conserved, the JSD rank can not correspond to the conn

(k) value. In general, the relevance of conservation and
covariation is not so high, which demonstrates that the
conservation and covariation information are relatively
independent properties of proteins.

related protein structure is PDB ID: 1QGN[28]. In Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 we found that with different biological
constraints, the highest scoring sites are different and
the comutating sites are also different. In the MI’
method, the highest scoring site is 388 while that of
MIB’, MIP’ and MIBP’ are 389, 265 and 236, respectively. On the other hand, to make certain differences
between these measures, we used the Friedman test to
judge whether the performance statistics for these

measures are significantly different. The difference
between the performances of two measures is called statistically significant if the P-value estimated by the
Friedman test with Bonferroni correction is less than
0.05 [28].
To testify the validity of the amino acid background
distribution, the MI’ and MIB’ measures were compared.
As shown in Table 7, the P-value between MI’ and MIB’
is 6.82 × 10 -4 , thus there is significant difference

between them. It confirmed the conclusion of [25] that
the biological constraints is meaningful in measuring
covariation, and evolution pressures of amino acids are
removed successfully by using their background distribution. To clarify differences between covariation of
amino acids and covariation of amino acid physicochemical properties, the MI’ and MIP’ measures were
also compared. The P-value between the MI’ and MIP’
measures is 2.03 × 10-7. The P-value indicates that the
covariation of amino acids is significantly different to
that of physicochemical properties. These results indicate that the covariation of physicochemical properties
is a new aspect of biological information to detect
coevolution.
Effect of sequence identity threshold

The effect of sequence identity thresholds in measuring
coevolution is tested in this section. Sequence identity
thresholds of 90%, 80%, 70% and 60% are chosen as
examples on the 1JXA-A protein family. The identity
thresholds < 60% are ignored since the account of the
number of sequences is less than125. Performances of
MIB’ on the protein family are shown in Table 8 and
performances of other methods are shown in the supplement materials. Table 8 shows that sites change significantly with the decreasing of the identity thresholds
and the numbers of the predicted sites are also

Conclusions
In this study, we propose two new biological constraints,
based on which several new measures are designed to
detect protein residue coevolution. The first constraint
is amino acid background distribution which is used to
develop the MIB’ method. In contrast to previous methods which focused on how to transform joint count to
joint frequency, MIB’ method tries to remove the effects
of amino acids evolutional pressures in the measure. By
incorporating the new biological constraints, we found
that MIB’ is more effective in measuring amino acid
coevolution. The second constraint is the physicochemical properties of amino acids which are used in the
MIP’ method. Motivated by the MIB’ method, MIBP’
method which removes the physicochemical properties’
evolutional pressures is also proposed. Results show that
the MIBP’ method is sensible to catalytic sites. It indicates that physicochemical properties of residues around
catalytic sites are strongly evolved. Moreover, results
show that the MIBP’ measure is significantly different
from methods based on amino acid distribution. Thus
the covariation of physicochemical properties supplies
new coevolution information.

decreasing. For example, site 313 is the highest conn(k)MIB’ scoring site at the identity thresholds of 90%, 80%
and 70%, while it is not predicted at the identity threshold of 60%. And at relatively high identity thresholds,
site 238 is not predicted while its conn(k)-MIB’ score is
high at relatively low identity thresholds. Moreover,
there are only 3 sites left at the identity threshold 60%.
It means these three sites coevolve with many columns
which do not coevolve with other columns strongly.
While at 90% threshold, the information is enough to
reveal the covariation of those columns. Thus, it demonstrates that the lower identity threshold affects the covariation significantly. It may lead to the consequence
that some sites without coevolved property are mistakenly regard as the highly coevolved sites. In contrast,
some sites with coevolved property are not predicted
since the signal of coevolution reduces with the lower
identity. It is true that sequences with high identity
would reduce the correctness of the MSA, thus identity
threshold of 95% or 90% is acceptable. The related
results are submitted with the paper.

The MIB’ method is tested on the 1JXA-A protein family at sequence identities
90%, 80%, 70% and 60%.
