Abstract
Background: Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a highly contagious viral disease of
fresh and saltwater fish worldwide. VHSV caused several large scale fish kills in the Great Lakes
area and has been found in 28 different host species. The emergence of VHS in the Great Lakes
began with the isolation of VHSV from a diseased muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) caught from Lake
St. Clair in 2003. VHSV is a member of the genus Novirhabdovirus, within the family Rhabdoviridae.
It has a linear single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kbp, with six genes.
VHSV replicates in the cytoplasm and produces six monocistronic mRNAs. The gene order of
VHSV is 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. This study describes molecular characterization of the Great Lakes
VHSV strain (MI03GL), and its phylogenetic relationships with selected European and North
American isolates.
Results: The complete genomic sequences of VHSV-MI03GL strain was determined from cloned
cDNA of six overlapping fragments, obtained by RT-PCR amplification of genomic RNA. The
complete genome sequence of MI03GL comprises 11,184 nucleotides (GenBank GQ385941) with
the gene order of 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. These genes are separated by conserved gene junctions,
with di-nucleotide gene spacers. The first 4 nucleotides at the termini of the VHSV genome are
complementary and identical to other novirhadoviruses genomic termini. Sequence homology and
phylogenetic analysis show that the Great Lakes virus is closely related to the Japanese strains
JF00Ehi1 (96%) and KRRV9822 (95%). Among other novirhabdoviruses, VHSV shares highest
sequence homology (62%) with snakehead rhabdovirus.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic tree obtained by comparing 48 glycoprotein gene sequences of different
VHSV strains demonstrate that the Great Lakes VHSV is closely related to the North American
and Japanese genotype IVa, but forms a distinct genotype IVb, which is clearly different from the
three European genotypes. Molecular characterization of the Great Lakes isolate will be helpful in
studying the pathogenesis of VHSV using a reverse genetics approach and developing efficient
control strategies.

Background
Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a rhabdoviral fish pathogen, which constitute one of the major
threats to the development of the aquaculture industry
worldwide. VHSV causes disease not only in salmonids,
but also in many other marine species as well [1-5]. The
virus usually causes severe hemorrhages on the skin, the
kidney and the liver, with mortality rates as high as 90%.
VHSV is a member of the genus Novirhabdovirus within the
family Rhabdoviridae [6]. It possess a non-segmented negative-strand RNA genome of approximately 11 kbp with a
coding capacity for five structural proteins; nucleoprotein
(N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), RNA polymerase (L), and a nonstructural protein
(NV) [7-9]. The gene order of VHSV is 3'-leader-N-P-M-GNV-L-trailer-5'. The negative-strand RNA genome is connected tightly with the nucleoprotein N and forms the
core structure of virion. This encapsidated genomic RNA
is also associated with the phosphoprotein P and
polymerase protein L, which are involved in viral protein
synthesis and replication.
The complete nucleotide sequence of VHSV has been
determined initially for VHSV Fi13 strain [9] and coding
regions of several other strains of VHSV have been determined later [10]. In this study, we characterized the entire
genome of the Great Lakes VHSV isolate MI03GL from
muskellunge, Esox masquinongy (Mitchill), caught from
the NW region of Lake St. Clair, Michigan, USA in 2003
[11]. Affected fish exhibited congestion of internal organs;
the inner wall of the swim bladder was thickened and contained numerous budding, fluid-filled vesicles. Lake St.
Clair is a major lake in the Great Lakes system that has historically supported an economically and socially important sport fishery for many species of fish [11,12]. VHSV
has a very broad host-range, including numerous taxonomic families of fish. The Great Lakes VHSV has been
found in 28 different host species, including muskellunge,
yellow perch, smallmouth bass, northern pike, whitefish,
walleye, bluegill, drum, round gobies, and some sucker
species http://dnr.wi.gov/fish/vhs/. It is a serious threat to
all aquaculture species, including salmonids such as trout
and salmon. To understand the molecular characteristics
of the Great Lakes VHSV strain MI03GL, we thoroughly
analyzed the entire genomic sequences and compared it
with other VHSV strains and rhabdoviruses.

Methods
RT-PCR amplification of the VHSV genome
The genomic RNA of VHSV strain MI03GL was kindly provided by Dr. Gael Kurath, U.S. Geological Survey, Western
Fisheries Research Center, Seattle, WA, and was used as a
template. The consensus PCR primers were designed
based on the available VHSV genome sequences (Genbank accession numbers AB179621; NC_000855;

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/171

AB490792) from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). The complete genome sequences
were aligned; highly conserved sequence segments identified, and used to design overlapping primers. The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.
First strand synthesis was carried out in a tube containing
5 μl of RNA, which was denatured at 70°C for 10 min in
the presence of DMSO (3 μl), 1 μl forward gene-specific
primer, 1 μl of 25 mM dNTPs, and snap-cooled on ice for
1 min. The reaction mixture containing 2 μl of 10× RT
buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 M DTT, 4 μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 1 μl of
Superscript III RT™, and 1 μl of RNase OUT™ was incubated at 50°C for 1 h. PCR amplifications were carried out
using a pfx50™ PCR kit (Invitrogen, CA), according to
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the following mixture
was used for PCR amplification: 3 μ1 of cDNA, 2 μl of
primer mix; 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH
9.0), 500 mM KC1, 1% Triton X-100], 2 μ1 of 25 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 ul of pfx50 polymerase, and 37 μ1 of DEPC
water, to make a final volume of 50 μ1. Reaction was carried out in a thermal cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham,
MA), using the following program: denaturation at 94°C
for 30 sec; annealing for 30 sec at 60°C; and extension at
68°C for 2 min. The RT-PCR products were separated by
agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a QIAquick
gel extraction kit (Qiagen, CA).
In order to identify the 3'-terminal region of the genomic
RNA, poly (A) tail was added to the 3'-end with poly (A)
polymerase enzyme, according to manufactures' instruction (Applied Biosystems, USA). Tailing reaction was carried in a tube containing 30 μl of RNA, 26 μl of nucleasefree water, 20 μl of 5× poly (A) polymerase buffer, 10 μl
of 25 mM MnCl2, 10 μl of 10 mM ATP, and 4 μl of E. coli
poly (A) polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated
at 37°C for 1 hr and then RNA was purified using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit, according to manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction
were conducted as described above, using an oligo (dT)
primer (5'-GCGGCCGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3') for
the first-strand synthesis, followed by PCR with the VHSVspecific primer 850R (5'-ACAGTCCAATCATGGTCATTC3'). The 5'-terminal of genomic RNA was identified by
rapid amplification of the 5'-end, using a 5'RACE kit (Invitrogen, USA), according to manufacturer's instructions.
Cloning and sequencing
The purified RT-PCR products were cloned into a pCR2.1
TOPO® TA vector (Invitrogen, CA). Plasmid DNA from
various clones was sequenced by dideoxy chain termination method, using an automated DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, CA). Three independent clones were
sequenced for each amplicon to exclude errors that can
occur from RT and PCR reactions.

the DNA sequenced (Fig. 1). The complete genome
sequence of VHSV-MI03GL comprises 11,184 nucleotides
(nts) and contains six genes that encode the nucleocapsid
(N) protein, the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein
(M), the glycoprotein (G), the non-virion (NV) protein,
and the large (L) protein (Fig. 1). The gene order is similar
to other novirhabdoviruses, 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. The
genomic features and predicted proteins of the VHSV
strain MI03GL are shown in Table 3. All the open reading
frames (ORFs) are separated by untranslated sequences,
known as gene junctions, whereas the untranslated
regions at the 3'- and 5'- ends are known as the 'leader'
and 'trailer', respectively. For example, the N gene is composed of 1,388 nts, and is located between 54 and 1441
nts from the 3'-end of the genomic RNA. The ORF of N
gene is flanked by 113 nts and 60 nts of 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs), respectively, and encodes a protein
of 404 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight
(MW) of 44.0 kDa. Similarly the length, ORF, and UTRs
of the P, M, G, NV, and L genes, encoding respective proteins with their calculated MW, are depicted in Table 3.
Genomic termini and untranslated sequences
Rhabdoviruses have conserved untranslated regions
between open reading frames for optimal translation of
viral proteins [15]. These sequences consist of a putative
transcription stop/polyadenylation motif (UCUAUCU7),
which signals reiterative copying of the U sequences to
generate poly (A) tail to the mRNA. It is followed by an
intergenic di-nucleotide GC or AC, which is not tran-

scribed, and a putative transcription start signal, -CGUG(Fig. 2A). All the genes contain these conserved gene end
(GE), intergenic (IG) and gene start (GS) sequences, as
shown in Fig. 2A.
Like other rhabdoviruses, the genomic termini of VHSV
3'-terminal nucleotides exhibit complementarities to the
nucleotides of the genomic 5'-terminus. Figure 2B shows
that the first 4 nucleotides of 3'-end are complementary to
the 5'-end nucleotides of genomic RNA, with the exception of an additional uracil (U) residue at the 5'-terminal.
The complementary nature of genomic termini allows a
formation of a panhandle structure, which is important
for replication of rhabdoviruses.
Homology and phylogenetic analysis
The percent nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence
identities of VHSV-MI03GL with known VHSV strains and
other rhabdoviruses were determined by Vector NTI program and the results are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The complete genome comparison of MI03GL with
other VHSV strains reveals a close relationship with two
Japanese strains, which were isolated from Japanese
flounder [JF00Ehi1 (96%) and KRRV9822 (95%)]. Other
VHSV strains are only 86-87% identical to the MI03GL
strain (Table 4). Similarly, the complete genome comparison of MI03GL strain with different members of Rhabdoviridae family shows 30-35% identity, but among
novirhabdoviruses, it exhibits 56% identity with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and 62% with

Genetic map of the VHSV genome and cDNA clones used for sequence analysis. The location and relative size of
the VHSV ORFs are shown; the numbers indicate the starts and ends of the respective ORFs. Six cDNA fragments (F1 to F6)
were synthesized from genomic RNA by RT-PCR. The primers used for RT-PCR fragments are shown at the end of each fragment. The RNA genome is 11,184 nucleotides long and contains a leader (L) and trailer (T) sequences at its 3'-end and 5'-end,
respectively. The coding regions of N, P, M, G, NV and L genes are separated by intergenic sequences, which have gene-start
and gene-end signals.
snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV), as shown in Table 5. Also
in novirhabdoviruses, it is evident that non-virion protein
(which is absent in other rhabdoviruses) is highly variable
than any other region of the genome, showing only 1617% identity.
Figure 3 shows the phylogenetic trees generated by comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of VHSV strains
and other rhabdoviruses belonging to Rhabdoviridae family. Phylogenetic tree obtained by comparing the deduced

amino acid sequences of VHSVs shows that MI03GL strain
is closely related to the Japanese strains, JF00Ehil and
KRRV9822 (Fig. 3A), whereas phylogenetic tree obtained
by comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of
known rhabdoviruses reveals that viruses belonging to the
same genera of Vesiculovirus, Lyssavirus, Ephemerovirus,
Novirhabdovirus, Cytorhabdovirus, and Nucleorhabdovirus
would form separate clusters (Fig. 3B).

Analysis 2 the gene junctions and complementarities in the VHSV genome
Analysis of the gene junctions and complementarities in the VHSV genome. A) Seven identified gene junctions of
VHSV in the negative-sense of the genomic RNA are shown. 3'/N, junction of 3'-leader and nucleocapsid gene; N/P, junction of
nucleocapsid and phosphoprotein gene; P/M, junction of phosphoprotein and matrix gene; M/G, junction of matrix and glycoprotein gene; G/NV, junction of glycoprotein and non-virion gene; NV/L, junction of non-virion and polymerase gene; L/5'-,
junction of polymerase gene and 5' trailer. GE = Gene end; IG = Intergenic di-nucleotide; GS = Gene start. B)Complementarities of the 3'- and 5'-ends of the VHSV genome. The first 4 nucleotides of 3'-end are complementary to the 5'-end nucleotides
of genomic RNA, except an additional uracil (U) residue at the 5'-terminal.

Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic trees formed by comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of MI03GL strain
N, P, M, NV and L proteins with other VHSV strains, in
which it is apparent that MI03GL proteins clusters with
JF00Ehi1, KRRV9822 and Makah VHSV strains, except the
L protein. Figure 5 shows the phylogenetic tree obtained
by comparing 48 glycoprotein gene sequences of different
VHSV strains, in which MI03GL clusters with subtype IVa
members but forms a distinct clade, IVb.

Discussion
The Great Lakes strain of VHSV (MI03GL) was isolated
from muskellunge, Esox masquinongy (Mitchill), in 2003
from Lake St. Clair, Michigan, USA. Previously, only G
and N protein gene sequences for MI03GL strain were
available and sequence analysis of the G gene revealed
that it is closely related to the North American genotype
IVa but distinct from the three European genotypes [11].
To fully understand the molecular characteristics of the
Great Lakes VHSV, we determined the complete genome
sequence of MI03GL strain. The genome is 11,184 nts
long and the gene organization (N, P, M, G, NV and L) is
similar to all members of the Novirhabdovirus genus. The
termini of the viral genome have conserved sequences at

the 3'-end (CAUAG/UU) and 5'-end (G/AAUAUG) as
other members of the Novirhabdovirus genus. The first 4 nt
of the leader sequence VHSV are complementary to the
last 4 nt sequence of the trailer region (Fig 2B). The length
of the 3' leader of MI03GL is 53 nts, which is similar to
SHRV but slightly shorter than IHNV and hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV; 60 nts). VHSV has the longest 5' trailer
(116 nts) than other novirhabdoviruses, such as SHRV
(42 nts), IHNV (102 nts), and HIRRV (73 nts). It is possible that the difference in length of trailer sequences may
have some functional significance, which remains to be
seen.
All the genes of VHSV start with a conserved gene start
sequence (-CGUG-) like other novirhabdoviruses, followed by an ORF and conserved gene-end sequence (A/
GUCUAU/ACU7). All the genes end with 7 uracil (U) residues, which are poly adenylation signal for polymerase
when it transcribes a gene. Polymerase adds poly (A) by
stuttering mechanism [16]. After this poly (A) signal,
there are two conserved intergenic di-nucleotides (G/AC),
which are untranscribed and act as spacers between the
two genes. Polymerase skips these two nucleotides to next
gene-start sequence and starts transcribing the next gene

[16]. Transcription of rhabdovirus mRNAs is regulated by
cis-acting signals located within the 3' leader region and
untranslated region between each gene ORF [17-20]. The
Kozak context for each gene is conserved and all the genes
have adenosine (A) nucleotide at -3 position before the
start codon (data not shown). Among all the genes, L gene
has the optimal Kozak context (-ACCATGG-) as only few
copies of the L mRNA are produced inside the cell, and
every single mRNA has to be utilized efficiently to make
polymerase protein that is essential for both replication
and transcription.
Comparison of the available VHSV sequences indicates
the presence of 5 highly variable regions (HVRs) in the N
protein: I, 38-54; II, 76-87; III, 98-131; IV, 367-375 and V,
391-393. Phylogenetic tree of the N protein shows clustering of MI03GL, JF00Ehil, KRRV9822 and Makah strains.
The major variation between MI03GL and rest of above
said three strains is in HVR I and IV (data not shown). The
N-terminal half of the P protein of VHSV is highly varia-

ble, whereas C-terminal half is conserved. Phylogenetic
tree of the P protein shows clustering of MI03GL, JF00Ehil
and Makah strains. The strain isolated from Japanese
flounder, JF00Ehil is 100% identical to the MI03GL. The
highly conserved nature of phosphoprotein demonstrates
its importance in viral replication. The matrix (M) protein
is an important structural component of virions, forming
a layer between the glycoprotein containing outer membrane and the nucleocapsid core. Matrix protein of VHSV
is highly conserved than any other protein. VHSV strains
used in this study exhibit very close (96-98%) identity
with MI03GL. In phylogenetic analysis, JF00Ehil,
KRRV9822 and Makah strains form a cluster, which is 99100% identical to each other, and 98% identical to
MI03GL. Matrix protein of rhabdovirus is involved in viral
assembly, condensation of nucleocapsid, formation of
bullet-shaped virion [21,22] and induces apoptosis by
shutdown of host cell machinery in infected cells [23,24].
Because it is highly essential for assembly and release of

virions, the matrix protein maintains highest homology
between VHSV strains than any other protein.
The non-virion protein (NV) of VHSV shows greatest
genetic diversity than any other proteins of VHSV (Table
4). It was demonstrated that NV-knockout IHNV replicates very slowly in cell culture and is non-pathogenic in
fish [25]. On the contrary, NV-knockout SHRV replicates
very well as wild-type virus and it was shown that NV protein of SHRV is not essential for pathogenesis [26]. These
studies suggested that each species of Novirhabdovirus

genus has its own characteristics and one can not ignore
the importance NV in pathogenesis. The wide host-range
for VHSV suggests that the tropism and the pathogenicity
not only reside in glycoprotein gene, but also in other
genes, especially the NV gene. The L protein displays the
highest level of sequence homology among members of
various genera of Rhabdoviridae family (Table 5). All the
available L sequences for VHSV strains show highest conservation (98%) as that of the matrix protein.

Genomic comparison of VHSV strains isolated from various marine species from different parts of the world sheds
light on the correlation of genetic sequences with viral tropism and pathogenicity. The glycoprotein is believed to be
involved in virulence and tropism because of it's involvement in viral attachment and cell entry [27]. Comparison
of the glycoproteins of various VHSV strains has revealed
only few blocks of conserved region (data not shown).
The regions between residues 53-70; 140-156; 232-253
and 389-413, are highly conserved and the rest of the
region shows genetic variations which are scattered all
over the protein. The major neutralizing epitopes have
been mapped to two antigenic sites for IHNV, at amino
acids 230-231 and 272-276 [28,29]. In this analysis, we
found no amino acid substitutions at positions 230-231
among 48 strains compared, except two. On the other
hand, residues 270-281 are highly variable, which supports earlier findings and suggests the involvement of this
site in antigenic variation and virulence [30].

Authors' contributions

In phylogenetic analysis of the G proteins, MI03GL forms
a separate branch in genotype IVa (Fig. 5) and is sub-typed
as IVb, as demonstrated earlier [11]. Although JF00Ehil,
KRRV9822 and Makah strains maintain close identity
with MI03GL, they are sub-typed as IVa. The genogroups
of VHSV are determined based on the restriction fragment
length polymorphism patterns of the G protein [31].
Makah maintains a close identity with Japanese JF00Ehil
(99%) and KRRV9822 (98%), and North American isolates (99%). Phylogenetic tree of the G protein explicitly
demonstrates the relationship of Makah strain with members of genotype IV. Makah strain isolated from Coho
Salmon in 1988 from Washington, USA was grouped
under genotype IVa [31]. Rests of the North American
strains belonging to genotype IVa were isolated in different time periods (1991-2003) [11], and Japanese strains
were isolated around year 2000. Isolates of genotype IV
have been recovered mainly in North America, Japan and
Korea [31,32] but not in Europe where genotypes I, II and
III are prevalent. It was suggested that VHSV strains circulating in a defined geographical area have a remarkably
conserved G gene, regardless of the elapsed time or the
different host species [33]. These earlier reports and the
current study suggests that the genotype IV strains of
VHSV probably originated from North America and possible ancestor for isolates of genotype IV might be Makah.
This suggests that MI03GL might have diverged from
Makah and evolved independently thereafter. To date,
among VHSV strains, MI03GL strain is the only member
of the genotype IVb.
