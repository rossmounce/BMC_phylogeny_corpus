Cortical cytasters: a highly conserved developmental
trait of Bilateria with similarities to Ctenophora
Miguel Salinas-Saavedra* and Alexander O Vargas

Abstract
Background: Cytasters (cytoplasmic asters) are centriole-based nucleation centers of microtubule polymerization
that are observable in large numbers in the cortical cytoplasm of the egg and zygote of bilaterian organisms. In
both protostome and deuterostome taxa, cytasters have been described to develop during oogenesis from vesicles
of nuclear membrane that move to the cortical cytoplasm. They become associated with several cytoplasmic
components, and participate in the reorganization of cortical cytoplasm after fertilization, patterning the anteroposterior and dorso-ventral body axes.
Presentation of the hypothesis: The specific resemblances in the development of cytasters in both protostome and
deuterostome taxa suggest that an independent evolutionary origin is unlikely. An assessment of published data
confirms that cytasters are present in several protostome and deuterostome phyla, but are absent in the non-bilaterian
phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora. We hypothesize that cytasters evolved in the lineage leading to Bilateria and were
already present in the most recent common ancestor shared by protostomes and deuterostomes. Thus, cytasters would
be an ancient and highly conserved trait that is homologous across the different bilaterian phyla. The alternative
possibility is homoplasy, that is cytasters have evolved independently in different lineages of Bilateria.
Testing the hypothesis: So far, available published information shows that appropriate observations have been
made in eight different bilaterian phyla. All of them present cytasters. This is consistent with the hypothesis of
homology and conservation. However, there are several important groups for which there are no currently
available data. The hypothesis of homology predicts that cytasters should be present in these groups. Increasing
the taxonomic sample using modern techniques uniformly will test for evolutionary patterns supporting homology,
homoplasy, or secondary loss of cytasters.
Implications of the hypothesis: If cytasters are homologous and highly conserved across bilateria, their potential
developmental and evolutionary relevance has been underestimated. The deep evolutionary origin of cytasters also
becomes a legitimate topic of research. In Ctenophora, polyspermic fertilization occurs, with numerous sperm
entering the egg. The centrosomes of sperm pronuclei associate with cytoplasmic components of the egg and
reorganize the cortical cytoplasm, defining the oral-aboral axis. These resemblances lead us to suggest the
possibility of a polyspermic ancestor in the lineage leading to Bilateria.

Background
The zygote of Bilateria is known to have well-differentiated and independent cytoskeletal domains of microtubules that divide the cytoplasm in two regions, the
ectoplasmic (cortical) and endoplasmic (inner) domains

(Figure 1) [1-5]. The endoplasmic domain presents a
single aster (monoaster, black aster in Figure 1), whose
radially running microtubule fibers are nucleated from
the centrosome [6]. Upon fertilization, the sperm centriole becomes the new endoplasmic centrosome (the
maternal centrosome is no longer observable) a . The
sperm-derived centrosome then reorganizes the endoplasmic domain: movements of inner cytoplasm polarize

Figure 1 Schematic representation of a section of the
bilaterian egg. There are two cytoskeletal domains of microtubules
in the first interphase of the bilaterian zygote: one formed by
cytasters (asters, painted green) placed in the cortex or surface of
the egg (Ectoplasmic domain), and a second domain organized by
the monoaster (black aster) of the sperm-derived centrosome,
placed in the inner cytoplasm (Endoplasmic domain). Discrete foci
schematically represent the centrioles (these can only be observed
in actual embryos by means of special techniques, such as the
injection of labeled tubulin or application of microtubulepolymerizing agents like taxol).

the egg, segregating the maternal components from yolk
and transporting them towards the animal pole, where
the centrosome is found [1,4,7-9]. The centrosome also
forms the mitotic spindle, driving early cell divisions. In
the ectoplasmic domain of the egg, developmental studies
often describe the presence of numerous cytasters. These
are microtubule-organizing centers that can be observed
by means of techniques that induce microtubule stabilization and polymerization (such as the application of Taxol
and Nocodazole) as foci surrounded by a star-like aggregation of microtubules, hence their name (cytoplasmic
asters) [10-12]. Sometimes, agents for microtubule stabilization may produce star-like structures that are not true
nucleating centers of microtubules, but are formed
because short stabilized microtubules slide against each
other, as revealed by ultrastructural and immunofluorescence analysis ([13]. For an example see reference [14]).
This is decidedly not the case with the cortical cytasters
observed in the egg of Bilateria. Like centrosomes, cortical
cytasters contain centrioles that have been observed
repeatedly using electron microscopy [11,12,15-17]. Cytasters, however, differ from centrosomes in that the latter
consist of two orthogonally arranged centrioles that are
surrounded by pericentriolar matrix; in contrast, cytasters
are composed of one to several associated centrioles, without a specific arrangement [15-17]. Like centrosomes, the

foci of cytasters are hard to observe in vivo. Without
applying stabilizing agents like Taxol, the cortical microtubule cytoskeleton (ectoplasm) has the in vivo appearance
of a homogeneous network. However, this ‘homogeneous’
cortical cytoskeleton is in fact formed by networks of
interconnected cytasters [1,10-12,18-22]. In the case of the
leech [1,20] and of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis [23], the
discrete foci of cytasters are observable in vivo by microinjection of labeled tubulin, and in the egg cortex of Drosophila, foci are observable using immunofluorescence
without Taxol [24,25].
Despite repeated descriptions of cytasters in animal
eggs from different bilaterian phyla, there has been no
formal review of their potential developmental and evolutionary relevance. Indeed, cortical cytasters appear to
play a crucial role in early development: after fertilization,
cortical cytoplasm undergoes reorganization, with movement of cytoplasmic components that are independent
from the movements of endoplasmic reorganization ([7]
and references therein). The movements of cortical cytoplasm are crucial to the patterning of the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral body axis ([4,9,26] and references
therein). A well-known example is cortical rotation and
grey crescent formation after fertilization in early amphibian development. The cytoskeleton is required for these
cytoplasmic movements, and cytasters are presumed to
play a crucial role [27-29]. Cytasters conceivably can act
in cytoplasmic reorganization much like the centrosome
does during cell division, positioning and transporting
various cytoplasmic components [30-33].

Presentation of the hypothesis
We propose that cytasters are an ancient and highly conserved trait of Bilateria that was already present in the
most recent common ancestor of Protostomia and Deuterostomia (the “Urbilateria”). Thus, we propose homology and conservation of bilaterian cytasters, in contrast
with the alternative possibility of homoplasy: that cytasters evolved independently in different bilaterian groups.
Detailed descriptions of cytasters in oogenesis and
early development are published for several ‘model
system’ Bilateria, particularly so sea urchins, amphibians,
and holometabolous insects such as Diptera and Hymenoptera. The available information allows us to compare
the extent of similarity in the formation, structural
dynamics and function of cytasters observed in both
deuterostome and protostome taxa. Specific similarities
would suggest that an independent evolutionary origin
of cytasters is unlikely, providing a first argument for
the antiquity and homology of cytasters in Bilateria. In
contrast, if the processes of cytaster formation were
found to be essentially different for different phyla, this
could be consistent with the possibility of independent
origins (although it would not prove homoplasy per se).

Different mechanisms of cytaster formation would suggest that cytasters could form easily under different biological conditions, supporting the argument for
homoplasy.

Developmental similarities in protostomes and
deuterostomes
In both protostome and deuterostome taxa, cytasters first
become visible during oogenesis (Figure 2). Their centrioles have been observed to develop from Centriolar
Precursor Bodies (CPBs) associated with the nuclear
envelope, which act as ‘seeds’ for centrioles, as described
for Hymenoptera [34], Echinodermata [15,35-39], and
Mammalia ([40-43]). These ‘seeds’ probably correspond
to centrin buds, accumulations of centrin proteins associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope,
which have been well studied in mammalian culture cells
([44,45] and references therein). The first step in the
ontogeny of cytasters is that numerous membranous elements containing CPB ‘seeds’ detach from the nuclear
envelope and move from the cytoplasm to the oocyte
cortex (2 in Figure 2). These membranous elements are
called accessory nuclei in insects [34], annulate lamellae
in sea-urchin [36] and sea-cucumber [38], multivesicular
aggregates in mouse [40], and small vesicles in rabbit
[42]. Initiation, assembly, and development of the centriole and aster of cytasters begin after the breakdown of
the membrane of the nucleus (germinal vesicle) during
meiosis (3 in Figure 2), when CPBs recruit maternal proteins from the oocyte cytoplasm and become centrioles
(4 to in Figure 2). Diverse cytoplasmic components
(mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, granular material,
ribosomes, proteins, maternal mRNA, membranous elements, and others) then become associated with cytasters
concomitant to the progress of meiosis [15,34,40]. New

cytasters are also produced by centriole duplication of
fully formed cytasters [24]. The formation of cytasters is
completely independent in timing and place from centrosome duplication and nuclear division in the cell cycle
[15,46]. After fertilization, and immediately following the
first mitosis, cytasters begin to lose their distinct radial
configuration and gradually revert back to small astral
(star-like) areas that diminish considerably in size, eventually losing most of their characteristic astral features
(3a in Figure 3). The centriole becomes no longer visible
by electron microscopy, and is integrated within the ectoplasmic network of microtubules [15,37,47,48].
The fact that all the specific developmental processes
above have been described in both protostome and deuterostome taxa suggests that cytasters did not originate independently in each lineage but are homologous, having
already been present in their most recent common ancestor (the Urbilateria). The specific developmental pathways
also suggest that cytasters are not easily formed under
different biological processes and conditions. A clear prediction of the hypothesis of homology is that most basic
groups of Bilateria should also conserve these specific
similarities. In contrast, if taxa with cytasters are nested
within groups that otherwise lack cytasters, this would
provide evidence of homoplasy, with cytasters appearing
independently in different lineages. The absence of cytasters, or their modification, in turn, can be proven to be a
secondarily derived condition, if it occurs in taxa that are
nested within groups that otherwise exhibit the presence
and general developmental pattern of cytasters. By examining published evidence from non-bilaterian outgroups,
such as Ctenophora and Cnidaria, we can also test
whether cytasters originated exclusively in the lineage
leading to Bilateria, or in the ancestors of a larger group of
Eumetazoa. To this purpose, we reviewed published data

Figure 3 Schematic illustration of early development in Cnidaria, Ctenophora, and Bilateria. In bilaterian eggs (1 to 3a), cytasters (cyts)
are present in the oocyte (during and at the end of oogenesis; 1c). When the egg is activated by fertilization (1a), cytasters reorganize the
ectoplasm around them forming the cortical cytoplasmic modules (CCM, dashed circle) and mitosis starts. Immediately following mitosis (3a),
cytasters begin to lose their distinct radial configurations, gradually reverting back to small astral areas that diminish considerably in size (dashed
line), possibly becoming reduced centrioles (RC). Bilaterian cytasters have a similar role to that of sperm pronuclei in ctenophores. In Ctenophora
(1 to 3b), previous to the entry of sperm (1b) no cytoplasmic movements are observed. When supernumerary sperm (sns) enter the egg (2b),
cytoplasm reorganizes into several sperm pronuclear zones (SPZ, dashed circle) and the female pronucleus (fp) chooses one sperm (double
arrow). In this moment cell division starts and supernumerary sperm asters diminish in size and become integrated to the microtubule network
(dashed line; 3b). In Cnidaria, normal development (1 to 3c) requires a microtubule network (mn) exclusively organized by the maternal
centrosome (mc; 1c), and after fertilization (2c), by the sperm-derived centrosome. All maternal determinants necessary for normal development
are transported towards the animal pole (arrows in 1c), where the nucleus and centrosome are found. Fertilized eggs of cnidarians contain a
residual microtubule network at the time of first mitosis (3c).

reporting the presence or absence of cytasters in different
animal species. Although some of the older descriptions
are rudimentary, modern observations with plenty of
structural detail are available for several taxa. The techniques used and structures observed are summarized in
Additional file 1. This bibliographical review allows identification of the more important gaps in information and
future directions of research that will allow further testing
of the hypothesis of homology.
The available information reveals a diversity of bilaterian
phyla in which egg cytasters have been reported (see
Figure 4), as summarized in Additional file 1. Both Deuterostomia and Protostomia are well represented by several
lineages, including some that diverged very early within
each group, as we describe below. The available information is also summarized in Additional file 1.
Cytasters in protostomes

Within protostomes, it is well accepted that two main
lineages exist, the Lophotrochozoa and the Ecdysozoa.
The Lophotrochozoa includes well-studied phyla such as
Mollusca and Annelida. In zygotes of the leech (an annelid) the cortical cytoplasm is populated by numerous interconnected cytasters that together constitute the whole
cortex microtubule network. This ectoplasmic cytoskeletal
domain is observable in the egg before fertilization, from
the meiotic phase onwards, when no monoaster has yet
been formed, which confirms its formation is independent
of the monoaster [1]. The reorganization and translocation
of the ectoplasmic cytoskeleton is linked to the dynamics
of cytasters (see [20]). No studies have yet confirmed (or
discarded) the initial formation of cytasters from nuclear
vesicles (See Additional file 1). In the mollusk Crepidula
plana, as in the aforementioned groups, cytasters are in
the egg cortex, surrounded by cytoplasmic components,
closely associated with vesicles (presumably of nuclear origin), and their formation is not related to the centrosome
[49] (See Additional file 1). Another mollusk in which
cytasters have been reported is Spisula solidissima [50].
These observations are important since the lineage leading
to annelids and mollusks (the Lophotrochozoa) diverged
from that leading to insects (the Ecdysozoa) towards the
origins of Protostomia. Other Lophotrochozoa in which
cytasters have been observed (although in less detail) are
the Cestoda Baerietta diana and Distoichometra kozloffi
[51], and the Nemertean Cerebratulus lacteus [52].
Within the Ecdysozoa, information about cytasters is
available in great detail for holometabolous insects like
Hymenoptera (as discussed above) and Diptera. They have
also been described in Collembolla, indicating that cytasters were already present at the origin of the Hexapoda
[17,23-25,53,54]. In other arthropods, cytasters have been
described in the eggs of the Vericrustacean Artemia salina
[5]. The description of cytasters in the nematode

Page 5 of 13

Caenorhabditis elegans [55] is important, because Nematodes diverged early from all other Ecdysozoan lineages
[56]. We conclude that the available evidence is consistent
with the homology and conservation of egg cytasters in
Protostomes, according to a good sample of lineages spanning both Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa.
Cytasters in deuterostomes

The deuterostomes are split into two main groups, the
Ambulacraria and the Chordata [56,57]. Within the
Ambulacraria, cytasters are especially well-studied in sea
urchins, as discussed above ([15,16,18,21,58,59] and references therein). In sea urchins, interconnected cytasters
[21] take part in cytoplasmic rotation (cortical reorganization over 16°C) when the egg is fertilized [58]. Cytasters
are also present in other echinoderms such as starfish
[39], sea cucumber [38], and sand-dollar [35,60]. Within
the chordates, available information is almost entirely
restricted to amphibians and mammals. Otherwise, one of
us has confirmed the presence of cytasters in the egg cortex of the teleost Danio rerio, the zebrafish (MS personal
observation). In the amphibian Cynops (a newt), the cytasters are distributed around the whole unfertilized egg cortex, and form a coarse microtubule network in parallel
array, except around the meiotic spindle at the animal
pole (cytoplasm is restricted to the animal pole, because of
the high yolk content at the vegetal pole; [48]). This parallel array correlates with the direction of cortical rotation.
Cytoplasmic asters also have been described in the oogenesis of the salamander Triturus viridescens [61] and several
anurans (see Additional file 1), related to cortical and
germ plasm movements [11,12,27,62-65].
In mammals, as expected, the cytasters surround the
cortex of the unfertilized egg [22,47,66-69] and are independent of the sperm derived-centrosome. Cytasters
have been described in the oocytes of human [70], pig
[43,71], rabbit [42], opossum [72] and marsupial rat [73].
Observations in marsupials are especially interesting,
since this lineage diverged early within mammals. The
Glires (mouse and rabbit) deserve special attention
because they are derived: their cytasters do not contain
mature centrioles. Rather, the nuclear vesicles (multivesicular aggregates) have been observed to contain CPBs
surrounded by pericentriolar matrix [40-42]. The absence
of a mature centriole has led to the description of these
cytasters as acentriolar [19,74], but it must be kept in
mind that CPB can also organize microtubule polymerization (even in absence of pericentriolar matrix [15]).
Navara [75] reported that no cytasters are present in the
cow. If this is not an artifact, and the cow is really lacking
cytoskeletal organizers in the cortical cytoplasm, this
would represent a secondary loss of cytasters in evolution: Phylogenetically, the cow is firmly nested within
mammals that do have cytasters.

determined by appropriate visualization techniques. Cytasters are absent in Cnidaria and Ctenophora (blue font), but have been described in a
wide sample of both deuterostome and protostome lineages (dark font). The available data supports the hypothesis that cytasters evolved only
in the lineage leading to Bilateria (asterisk in figure) and were already present in the most recent common ancestor of protostomes and
deuterostomes. While the Ctenophora do not have egg cytasters, after polyspermic fertilization the centrosomes of the sperm carry out a similar
role in re-organizing cortical cytoplasm and establishing the oral-aboral axis. The position of Ctenophora as a sister group to Bilateria is
supported by morphological evidence but is controversial according to molecular evidence, with other possibilities indicated by dashed lines.

Cytasters in absence of the centrosome: a common role
throughout Bilateria

In the early development of Bilateria, the centriole of the
sperm provides the centrosome, which drives the migration, encounter, and fusion of the sperm and egg pronuclei
as well as the early cycles of cell division. However, in
some cases where the sperm-derived centrosome is absent,
these functions are carried out by cytasters. As we have
described above, the Glires differ from other mammals
because their cytasters do not have mature centrioles (see
above). Glires are also derived in that the oocyte has no
centriole [69], and there is no sperm-derived centrosome
in the fertilized egg. In the absence of a sperm-derived
centriole to form the centrosome, the only comparable
organizers are cytasters, which take over its function in
guiding the migration of the pronuclei towards the center
of the egg [67]. Cytasters in Glires also organize and form
the mitotic spindle, allowing the cell cycles of early mouse
development [19,22,67-69,74,76] in the absence of a centrosome. Subsequently, at the blastocyst stage, in each cell
a cytaster develops into a mature centriole and becomes a
centrosome ([19,40,42] and references therein). This
demonstrates that despite being described as acentriolar,
the cytasters of Glires can be functional as cytoplasmic
organizers and have the potential to become the centrosome. The functional takeover of centrosomal functions
by cytasters has also been repeatedly observed in several
bilaterian phyla in cases in which the sperm-derived
centrosome may be absent yet development proceeds.
This is the case for many Hexapoda that present natural
parthenogenesis [17,23-25,53,54] and is also true for
experimentally induced parthenogenesis in eggs of the
Vericrustacean Artemia salina [5]. In sea urchin and sand
dollar, when eggs are artificially activated (without fertilization), the cytasters form a structure resembling a mitotic
spindle (bipolar but without asters; [59]) and development
proceeds parthenogenetically [35,37]. Cytasters also take
over the function of early cell divisions when parthenogenesis is artificially induced in the pig and rabbit [42,43]. In
the salamander Triturus, in experiments on androgenic
development, eggs are fertilized in the absence of the
sperm-derived centrosome, so cytasters must organize the
early cell divisions [61]. In all the cases mentioned above,
cortical reorganization and cell divisions proceed normally,
in the absence of a sperm-derived centrosome. This
demonstrates that cytasters can organize and move cytoplasmic components much like a centrosome, which supports the strong inference that cytasters are crucial for the
reorganization of cortical cytoplasm and axis establishment. A potential for replacing centrosomal functions in
early development, and a capacity to eventually become
centrosomes, is another specific trait of cytasters that is
ubiquitous across distantly related bilaterian phyla (see
Additional file 1).

Development without cytasters: Cnidaria and Ctenophora

A review of published evidence from basic groups of
Eumetazoa supports the notion that cytasters are an exclusively bilaterian trait. Outside of Bilateria, in Cnidaria and
Ctenophora, no cytasters are formed during the process of
oogenesis, as confirmed by immunofluorescence and
microtubule polymerization techniques [14,77] (Figure 4).
In cnidarians, animal-vegetal (a-v) polarity of the oocyte is
generated during oogenesis and is present in the oocyte
before fertilization, with the animal pole at the site of
emission of the polar bodies [77,78]. Maternal determinants that specify the germ line (for example, Nvvas1, and
Nvnos2 RNA [79]) and oocyte polarity (CheFz1 RNA [77])
are transported throughout the entire cytoplasm involving
microtubules [77,79], and not in the ectoplasm alone as in
Bilateria [3,8,80-86]. There is no independent ectoplasmic
network of microtubules, nor did we find any description
suggesting the differentiation of cortical cytoplasm in cnidarians. In this case, the polarization of the egg is directed
by the centrosome associated with the meiotic spindle.
Transportation and reorganization of maternal determinants in cnidarians begins during oogenesis and is completed after fertilization, mediated by a single microtubule
network that is required for their transport (1c in Figure
3) [77]. This microtubule network has no obvious polarity,
other than the position at the animal pole of the maternal
centrosome of the meiotic spindle during oogenesis. At
the moment of fertilization, the maternal centrosome is
absent and the sperm-derived centrosome localizes at the
animal pole (2c in Figure 3) [77]. At the end of each meiotic and mitotic cycle, when the centrosome ceases its
activity, the entire microtubule network is depolymerized
[77], in contrast with bilaterian eggs, in which the cortical
network remains. The position of the centrosome of the
meiotic/mitotic spindle (both before and after fertilization)
is associated with the direction of transportation of maternal determinants during ooplasmic segregation. Under
normal conditions, all maternal determinants necessary
for normal development are transported towards the animal pole (1c in Figure 3) [78], where the nucleus and centrosome of the meiotic/mitotic spindle are found [77].
When centrifuged, the centrosome can be moved to a
position that is offset from the nucleus. In this case, maternal determinants are now transported towards the new
position of the centrosome (rather than the nucleus). The
presence of a single microtubule network nucleated by a
single centrosome in the egg [77] confirms that cnidarians
do not have an independent ectoplasmic network of
microtubules comparable to that formed in bilaterians and
ctenophores. Thus, the process of redistribution of maternal determinants in cnidarian eggs involves only the meiotic/mitotic spindle in cytoplasmic reorganization, rather
than multiple cytasters. In this sense, we may compare
cnidarian development to the endoplasmic domain of

Salinas-Saavedra and Vargas EvoDevo 2011, 2:23
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/23

Bilateria, which is also reorganized upon fertilization by
the microtubule network associated with the spermderived centrosome. In contrast, in both Ctenophora and
Bilateria, reorganization of cortical cytoplasm is independent of the centrosome.
Cortical reorganization without cytasters: The role of
polyspermy in Ctenophora

Cytasters are absent in the eggs of ctenophores (Figure 4)
as confirmed by immunofluorescence and microtubule
polymerization techniques [14]. However, cortical cytoplasmic movements after fertilization occur that closely
resemble those of bilaterian ectoplasm (1 to 3b in Figure
3). The ctenophore Beroe ovata has physiological polyspermic fertilization [87,88] taking place immediately
before or during formation of the first polar body (1 to 2b
in Figure 3) [89]. After several spermatozoa enter the egg,
cytoplasmic components become associated with the
supernumerary sperm cells, each forming a spherical zone
called Sperm Pronuclear Zone (SPZ; 2b in Figure 3), that
consists of cortical granules, mitochondria, endoplasmic
reticulum, and other cytoplasmic components, including
the nuclear envelope of the sperm pronucleus. Each SPZ
is organized by the centriole associated with each male
pronucleus [89]. The formation of this new cortical cytoplasmic configuration is carried out by microtubulemediated waves and is of utmost importance in establishing the oral-aboral axis [14], which takes place after the
fusion of pronuclei and first cleavage cycle [14,89]. In the
polyspermic Ctenophora, it is the female pronucleus of
Beroe that migrates to join a stationary male pronucleus,
choosing one (2b in Figure 3). At this site, the zygote
nucleus forms, first mitosis occurs and the first cleavage
furrow starts [14,89]. As development and cell division
advances, the nuclear envelopes of the supernumerary
male pronucleus break down, their DNA is degraded, and
the giant asters nucleated by their associated centrosomes
shrink and are no longer visible, presumably becoming
integrated with the microtubule network (3b in Figure 3)
[14]. The centrioles of zygote centrosomes retain their
mature form.

Testing the hypothesis
The specific developmental similarities of cytasters across
Bilateria provide compelling evidence of homology, a
hypothesis that is also supported by the available data on
phylogenetic distribution of the presence of cytasters. Published information on the presence of cytasters covers a
very good taxonomic sample: 20 orders, representing 15
classes and 8 phyla (see Figure 4, Additional file 1). For
perspective, we can consider how genomic structure and
molecular-developmental aspects are typically known for
poor taxonomic samples of only a few model species.
Good taxon sampling is crucial to any hypotheses of

Page 8 of 13

homology, because it allows testing for evolutionary
patterns such as conservation, homoplasy, and secondary
loss. We found no evolutionary pattern that would support the independent origin of cytasters in different bilaterian phyla. We found a single (possible) case of absence
of cytasters: The cow. Further confirmation of this case is
important, since this would be a clear case of a secondary
loss of cytasters in evolution. Also within mammals, the
Glires are interesting since they show how small differences may evolve in a specific lineage (lack of spermderived centrosome, cytasters with immature centrioles),
while at the same time conserving the general pattern of
formation and function of cytasters. In all, published available data is overwhelmingly consistent with homology and
conservation of cytasters across bilateria. Homology
directly implies that cytasters should be observable in several groups for which there is currently no available published information, that are represented in Figure 5 by
grey branches (Dark branches represent groups in which
the presence of cytasters has already been documented).
Within the Deuterostomes, data are missing for the phyla
Hemichordata, Urochodata and Cephalochordata. Within
Vertebrata, data are missing for several basic groups of
fishes: Cyclostomata, Chondrichthyes, Chondrostei, Holostei, Actinistia, and Dipnoi. Within Tetrapoda, no data are
available for Monotremata and Reptilia (including birds).
In Protostomes, data are missing for several important
phyla: Chaetognatha, Bryozoa, Brachiopoda, Kinorhyncha,
Loricifera, Priapulida, Onychophora, Tardigrada, Chelicerata, Myriapoda, and Oligostraca (Pancrustaceans). In some
groups, like Platyzoa [51] and Kryptochozoa [52], the
available information about cytasters was described during
the early twentieth century by observations of fixed and
stained eggs made under the light microscope. Updated
descriptions are desirable to confirm that these groups
really present cytasters. We found no available information
about the presence or absence of cytasters in the eggs of
Placozoa and Porifera. The documented absence of cytasters in the other non-bilaterian phyla Cnidaria and Ctenophora suggests that cytasters should also be absent in
Placozoa and Porifera. If so, this would support the notion
that cytasters only evolved in the lineage leading to Bilateria. For all the phyla mentioned above, new studies on
the presence or absence of cytasters can benefit from uniform application of modern techniques, ensuring sound
comparison of data across phyla.

Implications of the hypothesis
Cortical cytoplasmic modules are an ancient and highly
conserved Bilaterian trait

Based on the observations in several different bilaterian
animals, cytasters are much more than star-like centers
of microtubule polymerization. They have a specific
ontogeny, developing from precursor bodies (possibly

Figure 5 Bilaterian groups expected to present cytasters. Cytasters have been described in a wide sample of both deuterostome and
protostome phyla (dark branches). Grey branches are used for phyla for which we found no available published information. More detailed
studies are necessary to clarify the presence or absence of cytasters in these missing phyla, using modern techniques uniformly applied across

centrin buds) found in fragments of nuclear membrane
(often described as accessory nuclei or vesicles) that
move to the egg cortex and become associated to several
cytoplasmic components, conforming complex cortical
modules (Figure 2, Additional file 1). Thus, to go beyond
the notion contained in the descriptive term cytaster, we
wish to forward the notion and acronym of Cortical
Cytoplasmatic Modules (CCM) for the entire assemblage
of centriole (or, as in mouse and rabbit, centriolar precursor) associated with the membranous element, aster
and associated cytoplasmic components: mitochondria,
endoplasmic reticulum, granular material, ribosomes,
proteins, maternal mRNA, membranous elements, and
others.
Are CCMs inherited in cytoplasm?

The development of CCMs brings up interesting questions
about their inheritance. An intriguing possibility suggested
by Kallenbach and Mazia [37] is that the oocyte cytasters
upon disappearing may produce themselves the CPBs
(seeds) that become allocated to the nuclear surface. Thus,
cytaster reduction may be an important source of seeds
that become centrioles of new CCMs during oogenesisb. In
Bilateria, during the process of cell division, the nuclear
membrane (from which vesicles of CCM’s are formed) disintegrates into fragments, which thereafter allocate to the
cytoplasm of both resulting cells [30,32,33,90]. Thus, it is
easy to conceive how CPBs could be inherited through
cytoplasm containing these fragments. CPBs may always be
present in the nuclear membrane, but only become cytasters during the process of oogenesis. If so, artificial induction of cytaster formation is conceivable. This seems to be
the case in cultured mammalian cells, where formation of
cytasters similar to that in oogenesis is induced upon the
experimental ablation of the centrosome [44] and when
cells are arrested in S-phase [45]. In these cell cultures, the
centrioles of cytasters develop from seeds in vesicles of the
nuclear membrane that move towards the cortical cytoplasm. These seeds in the nuclear membrane have been
shown to be centrin buds containing alpha/gamma-tubulin
and centrin 2. Like centrioles, these seeds are capable of
self-replication [45], and are probably the same as the CPB
seeds observed in oogenesis. Further research is required
to establish if new centrin buds can only be formed by
replication, or can also be assembled from isolated centrin
proteins [44,91]. If new CPBs only form by replication,
they can only be inherited through cytoplasm.
A polyspermic ancestor?

The early development of Bilateria can be compared to
other Eumetazoan outgroups in order to make inferences
about the origin of CCMs. In this regard, the capacity of
the sperm-derived centrosome to re-organize the egg

Page 10 of 13

cytoplasm (as observed in Cnidaria and the endoplasm of
Bilateria) is linked in the case of the polyspermic Ctenophora to the establishment of a well-differentiated ectoplasmic domain, which is required for the establishment
of the oral-aboral axis. Compelling resemblances exist
between the CCMs of bilaterian eggs and the aforementioned SPZ of Ctenophora. The SPZ and CCM both possess a microtubule-nucleating centriole (and aster)
initially associated with the nuclear membrane (sperm
pronucleus of SPZ, and vesicles of nuclear membrane or
accessory nuclei in CCM), which becomes surrounded by
associated cytoplasmic components of the egg. Both are
required for the early developmental processes of ectoplasmic reorganization and axes establishment, and both
have a similar developmental fate, reducing the aster and
centrioles, which become incorporated in the microtubule network (see above; compare illustration 2-3b and
2-3a in Figure 3). As discussed above, in the absence of
the sperm-derived centrosome, CCMs are capable of taking over its role in the migration, encounter, and fusion
of the sperm and egg pronuclei [92]. In the ctenophore
Beroe ovata, when the unfertilized egg is artificially activated (SPZs are absent) the female pronucleus migrates
randomly in the cytoplasm throughout the egg [14,93].
When the egg of Beroe is fertilized, SPZs drive the migration, encounter, and fusion of pronuclei [93]. As discussed above, when bilaterian oocytes are artificially
activated (no sperm enter the egg), they undergo the normal process of segregation and redistribution of cytoplasm, without reactivation of meiosis ([30,33] M.
Salinas-Saavedra, personal observation in zebrafish and
sea urchin) and development often continues parthenogenetically [17,24,35,48,53,54,73,94,95]. In contrast, cytoplasmic reorganization and cell division is disrupted in
artificially activated eggs of ctenophores, demonstrating
that SPZs are required for the same processes carried out
by CCMs in Bilateria.
The remarkable similarities to ctenophore SPZs listed
above suggest that the development and function of
CCMs are derived from early developmental processes
similar to those in the polyspermic Ctenophora. More
specifically, we propose that the origin of CCMs involved
the acquisition by the female germ line of the capacity to
produce numerous centriole-based modules of ectoplasm, a process that previously was required for the exogenous contribution of supernumerary sperm. Because
CPBs can be inherited through cytoplasm, it is possible
that the female germline acquired numerous CPBs
directly from the reduction of sperm centrioles. An interesting point to observe in future studies is the distribution of germline determinants (like vasa and nanos)
during the development of polyspermic Ctenophores.
According to our hypothesis, we expect a cortical

Salinas-Saavedra and Vargas EvoDevo 2011, 2:23
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/23

localization of these markers associated with the microtubules of SPZs, similar to the distribution observed in bilaterian eggs, associated to microtubules of the egg cortex.
The phylogenetic relationships of Ctenophora to other
metazoa are currently controversial [56,96-102]. However,
Ctenophora has often been suggested to be a sister group
to Bilateria [96,99-102], especially on the basis of the morphological evidence. If so, this would support the notion
that polyspermy could have been present in the most
recent common ancestor of Ctenophora and Bilateria, and
the lack of a differentiated cortical cytoplasm, as in cnidarians, may represent a primitive condition for the egg (with
a single microtubule network).
The complex egg of Bilateria and its reorganization are
crucial in the selective distribution of cytoplasmic domains
during cleavage, leading to body axis patterning. Despite
the well-acknowledged importance of egg cytoplasmic
domains and their movements [1,4], their evolutionary origin is seldom discussed and thus seems largely mysterious.
In this sense, a new explicative framework emerges when
we consider the possibility that these cytoplasmic movements may derive from a complex, polyspermic fertilization, like that of Ctenophora, leading to the differentiation
of an ectoplasmic domain and the cytoplasmic movements
of body axis patterning. More detailed research in Ctenophora and Cnidaria is bound to be informative about the
early evolutionary history of cytoplasmic reorganization.

Endnotes
a
Previously, during the formation of the egg, the endoplasm is organized by the germinal vesicle-derived centrosome. In the literature, authors discussing the fate of
the oocyte-derived centrosome state that it is missing at
the end of meiosis [30,53].
b
This notion is supported by the experimental injection of centrioles (isolated from adult tissues) into the
egg of Xenopus. These centrioles become reduced and
cease to be observable, but upon fertilization, an
increased number of CCMs shows up at the site of
injection ([103] and references therein). This suggests
the injected centrioles provided an increased number of
centriole precursor bodies at the injection site.
