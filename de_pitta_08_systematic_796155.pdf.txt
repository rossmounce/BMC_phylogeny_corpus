Abstract
Background: Little is known about the genome sequences of Euphausiacea (krill) although these
crustaceans are abundant components of the pelagic ecosystems in all oceans and used for
aquaculture and pharmaceutical industry. This study reports the results of an expressed sequence
tag (EST) sequencing project from different tissues of Euphausia superba (the Antarctic krill).
Results: We have constructed and sequenced five cDNA libraries from different Antarctic krill
tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores. We have identified 1.770 high-quality ESTs
which were assembled into 216 overlapping clusters and 801 singletons resulting in a total of 1.017
non-redundant sequences. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify and validate
the expression levels of ten genes presenting different EST countings in krill tissues. In addition,
bioinformatic screening of the non-redundant E. superba sequences identified 69 microsatellite
containing ESTs. Clusters, consensuses and related similarity and gene ontology searches were
organized in a dedicated E. superba database http://krill.cribi.unipd.it.
Conclusion: We defined the first tissue transcriptional signatures of E. superba based on functional
categorization among the examined tissues. The analyses of annotated transcripts showed a higher
similarity with genes from insects with respect to Malacostraca possibly as an effect of the limited
number of Malacostraca sequences in the public databases. Our catalogue provides for the first
time a genomic tool to investigate the biology of the Antarctic krill.

Background
Euphausiacea (krill) are small shrimplike crustaceans that
are abundant in the pelagic ecosystems of all oceans.
There are about 85 species of Euphausiacea, making this

one of the smallest orders in the class of Malacostraca [1].
Phylogenetic analysis of the Eumalacostraca orders based
on 28S rDNA sequences suggests that Euphausiacea are
more closely related to Mysida than to the Decapoda [2].

In the Southern Ocean, krill is a critical link between primary productivity and most of the predators at higher
trophic levels such as birds, fish, seals, squid and whales
[3]. The krill biomass in the Southern Ocean has been estimated at 400–1550 million tons with sustainable annual
harvest at around 70–200 million tons. Therefore, krill
biomass that could be available for human food is comparable to the biomass of all the other aquatic species currently fished by humans, but only six species of krill are at
present harvested commercially [4,5]. Commercial fishing
of krill is done in the Southern Ocean and around Japan.
The global annual production amounts to 150 – 200.000
tons, most of this from the Scotia Sea [6,7]. Most of the
fished krill is used for aquaculture and aquarium feedings,
as baits in sport fishing, or in the pharmaceutical industry.
The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, Dana 1852) has a
circumpolar distribution with the highest concentrations
in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. It is a key species of the Antarctic ecosystem and plays an important
role both as feeder of algae, bacteria and micro-zooplancton and as a prey of vertebrates [8]. E. superba displays a
large daily vertical migration that occurs generally within
the upper 200 m water column making a significant
amount of biomass available as food for predators near
the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day
[9]. Basic knowledge of crustacean biology is limited by
the lack of information about their genomes. Considering
all orders in the class of Malacostraca, no genome has yet
been fully sequenced. At present Genbank carries 116,640
nucleotide and 11,932 protein sequences (Table 1), with
a high rate of redundancy. Currently only 434 nucleotide
and 310 protein sequences have been identified in
Euphausiacea (GenBank source, release of November
2007). Specifically for E. superba only 69 nucleotide and
17 amino acid sequences have been obtained; they iden-

tify key proteins and enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5;
Cytochrome oxidase subunit I, II, III; ATP synthase subunit 6;
cytochrome b; cytochrome b apoenzyme and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and of phototransduction (opsin). In the
subphylum Crustacea there are 33 complete (or nearly
complete) mitochondrial DNA sequences: 4 Branchiopoda, 8 Maxillopoda, 18 Malacostraca, and one of Ostracoda, Cephalocarida and Remipedia (Table 2). In a
previous investigation Machida et al. [10] determined the
nearly complete DNA sequence of the mitochondrial
genome of E. superba (14,606 bp).
The identification of novel shrimp genes by systematic
sequencing of genomic DNA is hindered by the dispersion
of the genes among large non-coding regions and by the
presence of introns within genes. Current genomics technologies, like SAGE [11], differential display [12] and systematic sequencing of expressed sequence tags [13,14],
are very useful approaches to identify protein coding
genes rapidly on a large scale. Moreover, the frequency of
a given sequence in the SAGE or cDNA libraries can be
related to the relative abundance of the corresponding
mRNA, giving an indication of the level of gene expression [15].
The aim of our study was to significantly increase the
number of krill genes in the public database and to discover tissue specific genes. For this purpose we have produced and sequenced five cDNA libraries from different
Antarctic krill tissues: head, abdomen, thoracopods and
photophores. We have developed special cDNA libraries
optimized to directionally cloning full-length cDNA in
plasmid vectors without enzymatic digestion. We have
identified 1,770 high-quality EST clones that have been
grouped in 1,017 different clusters. Of these, 309 clusters

ontology searches were organized in a dedicated E. superba
database [16].

Results and Discussion
Construction of cDNA libraries and EST analysis
Total RNA was independently isolated from tissues (head,
abdomen, thoracopods and photophores) dissected from
specimens of E. superba collected at five different time
points during 24 hours. The analysis of total RNA samples, performed by capillary electrophoresis, showed
absence of genomic DNA contamination and a peculiar
electropherogram as shown in Fig. 1. In particular, total
RNAs show low molecular weight from 200 bp to 1 kb,
perhaps as result of a partial RNA degradation.

Five independent tissue-specific cDNA libraries, named
K01 and K05 (head), K06 (abdomen), K07 (photo-

phores) and K09 (thoracopods), were produced from
total RNA pools. For head we have sequenced only K05
cDNA library because it presented more recombinant
clones compared to K01. Recombinant bacterial clones
from each library were randomly picked and the EST were
sequenced from the 5'-end. The average insert size for all
libraries was estimated to be 412 bp.
EST assembly and construction of an Antarctic krill
transcript catalogue
A total of 2,046 ESTs were initially analyzed for sequence
quality and vector sequences were recognized and deleted.
Two-hundred-seventy-six low quality ESTs were removed
and 1,770 (86.5%) high-quality ESTs were further processed. These ESTs assembled by similarity into 216 clusters and 801 singletons, resulting in a total of 1,017 nonredundant (consensus) sequences. A list of the sequencing
trend for each cDNA library is presented in Table 3. Interestingly, we obtained a low percentage of clusters composed by ≥ 2 ESTs from cDNA libraries prepared from the

krill head (K01, K05) showing that no specific transcripts
are particularly enriched in this tissue. As expected from
the above data, the head reveals a higher percentage
(about 65%) of new putative transcripts, with respect to
abdomen (52.3%), photophores (50.2%) and thoracopods (44.4%) in which the presence of enriched transcripts was instead revealed by EST sequencing.
The number of ESTs in each cluster varies from 2 (93 clusters) to 88 (1 cluster). The average length of a cluster is
436 bp with the longest assembled sequence being 1,417
bp and the shortest 153 bp. The 91% of cluster consensus
contains the 3'-end region of mRNAs as demonstrated by
the presence of a poly-adenylation signal.
Each non redundant sequence was searched in the nucleotides database and UniProtKB database using Blast-N
and Blast-X with an e-value cut off of < e-40 and < e-10,
respectively. These values were empirically chosen considering the low amount of sequences data available for
Euphausiacea and similar shrimp species and the need of
stringency in providing a reliable catalogue of Antarctic
krill genes. All annotations were further manually examined, in order to assign the best describing text to the correspondent cluster.
Overall, 70% of non-redundant sequences (708 out of
1,017), identified by about 50% of total produced ESTs,
showed no or poor similarity matches, and they probably
represent completely unknown Antarctic krill transcripts
that could be characterized in future studies. Additional
file 1 lists the 309 (30%) non-redundant sequences identifying known Euphausia genes or sequences showing significant similarity to genes from arthropods (63.4%) and
other species (36.6%), such as Homarus americanus
(3.2%), Aedes aegypti (12.0%), Drosophila melanogaster
(3.9%), Bombyx mori (3.6%), Brachydanio rerio (4.9%),
Mus musculus (3.9%), Rattus norvegicus (3.9%), Homo sapiens (4.5%). Antarctic krill sequences generally show a
greater similarity to genes of insects (about 36%) than to
genes of Malacostraca (about 23%) and only 7% were
similar to the known sequences of Euphausiacea. This

result could be due to the limited number of Malacostraca
gene and protein sequences available in the public databases (gene sequences: 116,666 and protein sequences:
11,941 at November 2007) respect to insects (gene
sequences: 1,869,511 and protein sequences: 336,246 at
November 2007). The total collection of 1,770 E. superba
3'-EST has been deposited in the EBI-GenBank-DBJ database (GenBank accession numbers from ES542703 to
ES544472).
One of the most noticeable features of our EST catalogue
is that mitochondrial transcripts are quite abundant
(about 10% of the total ESTs): 84 ESTs (about 4.7%)
matched with nine different E. superba mitochondrial
transcripts (ATPase6, COI, COII, COIII, cyt b, ND1, ND2,
ND3, ND6) and about 5% ESTs (88 out of 1,770) identified the large mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. In future
experiments, to avoid the repetitive sequencing of this
abundant mRNA, we plan to introduce, during cDNA
insert amplification, interference primers specifically
designed for the 16S rRNA [17]. Moreover, we found a
small percentage of ESTs (1.6%), showing similarity with
18S and 28S rRNA. About 2% of ribosomal RNAs contamination is common to other systematic sequencing
projects.
The E. superba mitochondrial gene sequences are very similar to those commonly found in the mitochondrial
genomes of other arthropods, including 13 protein-coding genes, 19 tRNA and 2 rRNA genes [10]. Machida et al.
[10] have demonstrated that mitochondrial protein-coding genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand, left
to right, except for ND1, ND4L, ND4 and ND5 genes,
while two ribosomal RNA genes are encoded by L strands.
We did not find highly represented tissue-specific mRNAs,
while some ribosomal proteins like L22 (31 ESTs), S25
(31), P1 (16), L37A (15), L24 (13), P2 (13), S14 (9), S14
(10), L34 (9) were expressed at the same level in all analyzed krill tissues. The only genuine tissue-specific mRNA
appears to be myosin light chain (8 ESTs, cluster
KRC00032) that is highly represented in a strictly commit-

ted tissue such as skeletal muscle localized in abdomen
(library K06). Moreover, we found 3 unknown transcripts
among the 20 most expressed genes: KRC00118 (10
ESTs), KRC00407 (9 ESTs) and KRC00101 (7 ESTs) that
could be interesting for future functional studies.
Since very few abundant transcripts were found that could
hamper the identification of rare transcripts, it seems
plausible that random sequencing of our Antarctic krill
libraries would continue to represent an effective strategy
for identifying novel E. superba mRNAs.
Functional categorization of E. superba ESTs
In order to facilitate functional genomic studies in Antarctic krill, 309 consensus sequences showing similarity with
known genes or proteins were grouped into 14 functional
categories (Table 4) according to Gene Ontology [18] and
other resources developed for gene functional annotation
[19]. A list of all annotated transcripts is shown in Additional file 1. A large majority of ESTs (20.51%), displaying
putative identity with ribosomal sequences and genes for
the translation machinery, were grouped in the transla-

tion functional category, characterized by 8% of all
known transcripts. We found genes with regulative functions in the translational initiation, like translation factor
SUI1,initiation factor 4A and 3, in the translational elongation like elongation factor 1α, 1β, 2 and a specific tail muscle
elongation factor 1γ. Other abundant E. superba sequences
fall into gene categories related to cell structure, cell motility and functional homeostasis. For instance, genes
involved in the mechanisms of DNA transcription
(1.47%), transport (1.97%), skeletal muscle contraction
(3.4%), and in amino acid, fatty acid and carbohydrate
metabolism (4.03 %) are comprised in this category. This
class includes also SEC61 β-subunit, an important transport protein that plays a crucial role in the insertion of
secretory and membrane polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum and cellular retinoic acid/retinol binding
protein (RBP1), involved in the transport of retinol from
the digestive gland to peripheral tissues [20]. A transcript
included in this class (ID: KRC00589) shows a good similarity with hemocyanin, the main oxygen carrier molecule in arthropods and molluscs [21].

Other interesting krill transcripts that we were able to
annotate are those involved in stress responses, proteolysis and immunoresponse (3.24%) like Hsp90, chaperones,
cathepsine L-like cysteine protease, a lysosomal cysteine proteinase [22], peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A1 (cyclophilin A1) and peptidylprolyl isomerase B (cyclophilin B).
Cyclophilines are members of the immunophilin protein
family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic
cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. ESTs with good similarity to hemocyanin are present
in our collection: this protein has been recently reported
to have antifungal and antiviral activities [23,24].
Some krill ESTs identify histone 2A (KRC00431) and histone 3.3A (KRC00024) indicating the presence of unexpected polyadenylated histone transcripts displaying the
polyadenylation signal and tail. In vertebrates, these evolutionary conserved housekeeping mRNAs are not polyadenylated, and this has been related to the high turnover
of these transcripts in the dividing cells. Interestingly,
polyadenylated H2A and H3 histone sequences were
detected also in the systematic sequencing of 3'-end cDNA
libraries obtained from brain and kidney of channel catfish Ictarulus punctatus [25,26] and from various tissues
(haemolymph, gills, digestive glands, mantles and adductor muscles) of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis [27].
The presence of polyadenylation signals in E. superba histone transcripts deserves a more detailed analysis. In fact,
Eirin-Lopez et al. [28] have recently shown that all histone
genes in the repetitive unit are characterized by two different mRNA termination signals in their 3' UTR: the typical
stem-loop or hairpin-loop signal followed by a purinerich element and a polyadenylation signal AATAAA
located downstream to this last element. The presence of
a double mRNA termination signal is unique to histone
genes and common for other invertebrates such as Chironomus thummi [29], D. melanogaster [30], Chaetopterus
variopedatus [31], M. galloprovincialis [32] and Crustacea
[33]. Although in some invertebrates core histone transcripts (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) include polyA tails, these
sequences are among the most evolutionary conserved
eukaryotic proteins [34].
Transcriptional signature of E. superba tissues
Gene expression profiling depends on the functional specificity of cells composing different tissues. So, the systematic sequencing of EST from unbiased cDNA libraries is a
suitable approach for analyzing the gene expression profile of a given tissue [35]. In fact, the frequency of a given
EST in the cDNA library can be related to the relative
abundance of the corresponding mRNA in the source tissue.

To define tissue transcriptional signatures of E. superba,
annotated ESTs obtained from the four tissue-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/45

cDNA libraries (head, abdomen, photophores, thoracopods) were separately grouped in 13 functional categories
(Table 5) a further abundant category was created for
those ESTs to which no function may be yet associated.
Fig. 2 shows four different diagrams standing for ESTs distribution among functional categories in each cDNA
library. The presence of highly represented functional categories is peculiar of strictly committed tissues such as
abdomen and thoracopods in which transcripts involved
in striated muscle contraction are very abundant (about
26% in abdomen and 7% in thoracopods). In the abdomen library, we were able to recognize the principal structural components of the sarcomeric contractile machinery
(myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain 1, myosin-2, actin,
alpha-tubulin, tropomyosin) and two subunits of the troponin complex (troponin T, troponin I), a key regulator of
muscle contraction. About 10% of sequences produced
from head and thoracopods libraries fall in functional categories related to metabolic processes (amino acid, fatty
acid and carbohydrate metabolism). Interestingly, about
6% and 4% of ESTs respectively sequenced from head and
thoracopods libraries identified structural constituents of
cuticle (arthrodial cuticle protein AMP16.3, arthrodial cuticle
protein AMP1A, calcification-associated peptide-1 precursor).
This reflects the presence of cuticle traces in the head and
thoracopods samples. In photophores and thoracopods
transcripts displaying putative identity with ribosomal
sequences are more abundant compared to other tissues
(55% and 46%, respectively), indicating a relevant activity
of the translation machinery.
We have also identified from the head cDNA library a
novel opsin sequence (ID ESTs: KRC00735, KRC00802),
a light-sensitive membrane-bound G protein-coupled
receptors mediating the conversion of a photon of light
into an electrochemical signal in the visual transduction
cascade. In insects there are at least four main spectral
classes: long-wavelenght-sensitive (LWS), middle-wavelenght-sensitive (MWS) and two short-wavelenght-sensitive (SWS) groups. The opsin sequences available for E.
superba (GenBank accession no. DQ852576–DQ852580)
show a spectral sensitivity with short wavelength
(496–501 nm, λmax = 487) and cannot be aligned with our
consensus [36].
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to quantify
and validate the expression level of some genes presenting
different EST countings in krill tissues. We selected ten
genes (compound eye opsin BCRH1, myosin light chain,
myosin heavy chain, arthrodial cuticle protein AMP16.3, tail
muscle elongation factor 1 gamma, cellular retinoic acid/retinol
binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A, transport protein SEC61 subunit gamma, chromodomain helicase DNA
binding protein and voltage-dependent calcium channel) representative of different levels of transcript abundance.

Table showing the number and the percentage of ESTs in each functional category for each tissue specific library

The housekeeping gene 18S rRNA was used as endogenous control. As reported in the Additional file 2, the
expression values obtained with the quantitative RT-PCR
for the tested transcripts were in agreement with the EST
counting in the four libraries. In particular, we have demonstrated that the compound eye opsin is strongly expressed
in head compared to other tissues and myosin light chain
and myosin heavy chain are highly expressed in abdomen
and thoracopods confirming their key role in the contractile machinery. Instead, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A is
expressed at about the same level in all tested tissues.
Identification of microsatellite-containing ESTs
Among the 1,017 non-redundant sequences examined in
this study, 41 (4%) consensus sequences containing ESTs
were identified by using MISA software. Twelve of these
consensus present 2 distinct simple sequence repeats
interrupted by more than 100 bp for a total of 69 identified microsatellites (SSR). The majority of these sequences
(72%) fall into the 3 bp repeat type class with a preponderance of GAA and GAT. After a manual inspection of
redundancy, raw sequence, data quality and the presence
of sufficient flanking sequences we designed 9 pairs of
specific PCR primers. We obtained successful amplifications for 6 of these 9 pairs of primers. Assessment of polymorphism information content (PIC), observed and
expected heterozygosity and other population genetics
analysis will be performed in the near future. These markers will increase the currently available Euphausiacea SSR
markers. In fact, only five microsatellite loci isolated from
the northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica have been
reported so far [37]. Since our novel microsatellite markers were developed on the basis of expressed sequences

and they are presumably conserved across other Euphausiacea species, they could also be useful for comparative
mapping and for a molecular approach to Antarctic krill
ecology.

Conclusion
Since genome sequencing and BAC libraries of Antarctic
krill are not yet available, EST sequencing from randomly
selected cDNA clones represents a powerful approach to
identify large numbers of transcripts that could be used in
gene expression and functional genomics studies [38].
The systematic sequencing of four cDNA libraries prepared from different E. superba tissues has allowed us to
establish an EST database containing 1,017 unique
sequences. Over 65% of the Antarctic krill sequences
resulted in no BLAST matches with published sequences
and they probably represent novel genes that could be
functionally characterized. We have defined the transcriptional signatures of krill tissues and performed qRT-PCR
to validate the level of expression of ten representative
genes. All sequencing data have been deposited on the E.
superba EST database available from our web site [16]. In
addition, the EST collection is a potential source for the
development of genetic markers including microsatellite
and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Among the 1,017
unique sequences, 41 (4%) unique microsatellite containing ESTs were identified by using MISA software. Moreover, we have designed and successfully tested 6 pairs of
specific PCR primers for microsatellite loci.
Our EST catalogue could provide a source for the design
of microarray platform that will allow the study of the

transcriptional responses of this abundant marine organism to environmental challenges [39].

Methods
Tissues samples, RNA extraction and quality control
Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were fished from the
Ross Sea (longitude: 167°28'81" E – 179°54'68" W, latitude 68°40'54" S – 77°01"81" S) in the January 2004 during the XIX Italian Antarctic Expedition. Specimens were
collected at different time of the day (01:00, 06:00, 10:00,
15:00, 18:00), over a complete 24-hour cycle. Samples
were frozen at -40°C in RNA stabilization solution (RNAlater, Ambion). For each fishing, selected tissues (head
including compound eyes and brain, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores) from five animals were dissected
individually in RNA later ice solution (Ambion). After dissection, tissues were rapidly rinsed in sterile water,

weighed, frozen in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored
at -80°C. A large excess of Trizol (15 ml for 0.5–1.5 g. of
sample) was used in order to prevent RNA degradation by
endogenous RNAse. Frozen tissues were minced and
homogenized for 3–5 min using an ultra-turrax-T8.01
blender (IKA-Werke). Total RNA was isolated using the
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's
instruction and further purified with LiCl in order to
remove glucidic contaminants. All RNA samples were
checked for quality by capillary electrophoresis (RNA
6000 Nano LabChip, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent
Technologies). For each tissue (head, abdomen, thoracopods and photophores), equal amounts of total RNA (2
μg) extracted from every collection were pooled.

Construction of cDNA libraries
Five independent cDNA libraries, named K01 and K05
(head), K06 (abdomen), K07 (photophores) and K09
(thoracopods), were constructed.

We have developed a new method using a combination of
SMART protocol (Clontech), ensuring almost full-length
cDNA, and Gateway technology (Invitrogen), allowing
unidirectional cloning without enzymatic digestion. In
this protocol, only fully-transcribed first strand cDNA (ss
cDNA) is tagged with a short sequence complementary to
a modified SMART oligo (Fig. 3). The SMART oligo
sequence (SMART-16attB1-T3: 5'-TACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3') and the overhang
of the oligo(dT) primer (5'-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGCGGCCGC [dT]20VN-3') used for first
strand synthesis include an attB1 and attB2 recombination site respectively.
First strand cDNA synthesis was performed from 1.5 μg of
total RNA in a 15 μl reaction. Then, the reaction was then
diluted 1:5 ratio and incubated at 72°C for 2 min. Second
strand reaction mix was added to 1 μl of diluted first
strand cDNA to give a final concentration of 1× BD
Advantage 2 PCR reaction buffer (Clontech), 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 120 nM primers (attB1-8T3: 5'-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTAATTAACC-3' and attB2: 5'GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGG-3') and 1× of
Advantage2 DNA polymerase mix (Clontech) in a volume
of 50 μl. This second strand reaction mixture was incubated for 21 cycles of 15 sec 95°C, 30 sec 66°C and 3 min
68°C. Only those ss cDNAs having a SMART anchor
sequence at the 5' end were used as template and exponentially amplified. The second strand reaction was glass
fibre column purified and cDNA was size selected by
Sepharose CL-4B SPUN COLUMN (GE Healthcare). The
cDNA was inserted in the cloning vector by a recombination reaction performed at 25°C for 18 h with about 35 ng
of attB-cDNA, 150 ng of pDONR221 (Invitrogen) and 2
μl of BP Clonase II (Invitrogen) in 10 μl final volume. 1/
5 of the purified reaction was used to transform electrocompetent DH10B E. coli cells. Recombinant colonies
were selected on agar SOB medium plus kanamicin. Individual library colonies were arrayed by manual picking on
96 well plates in liquid selective SOB medium plus 7.5%
of glycerol for independent growth [40].
DNA sequencing
After lysis of the bacterial colonies, cDNA inserts were
directly amplified with universal primers M13 forward
(5'-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTCTTA-3') and M13 reverse
(5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGT-3'). The polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) profile consisted of: (1) initial denaturation for 5 min at 95°C, (2) 35 cycles of 40-s denaturation at 95°C, 40-s annealing at 60°C and 1-min

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/45

elongation at 72°C and (3) final extension for 5 min at
72°C; samples with a size over 0.5 Kb were selected for
sequencing. Single pass DNA sequencing from plasmids
was performed by using the vector specific primer
attB1_seq (5'-CTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCT-3') and a
modified Sanger dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing
chemistry, the ABI BigDye kit version 3.1, on a ABI 3730
48-capillary sequencer and 36 cm capillaries (Sequencing
Service of Max-Plank Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany).
Computer Management of Data
Trace2dbest and Partigene [41] were used to process chromatograms, clusterize sequences, and build an annotation database. Trace2dbest extracts sequences and quality
information from traces (Phred algorithm), removes vector contamination and poly(A), and performs the trimming of low quality sequences. Sequences shorter than
100 bp were discarded. Partigene reads all sequence files
and performs an assembling process in two step: 1)
CLOBB software [42] clusterizes sequences on the basis of
BLAST similarity; 2) Phrap [43] makes a consensus from
each cluster.

Each consensus, converted in FASTA format, was searched
locally in nucleotides database, downloaded from NCBI
[44] and UniProtKB database [45], using Blast-N and
Blast-X, respectively. First 10 HSPs (High Scoring Pair)
from each blast result were collected and stored in a local
PostgreSQL table, as a collection of automatic annotations.
Each cluster annotation in our database was further manually examined to assign the best describing text to the
correspondent cluster: matches with expectations values
greater than e-10 for protein (Blast-X) and e-40 for nucleotide (Blast-N) were considered as poorly informative.
Moreover, for each UniProt ID, taken from Blast-X
description field, we associated specific Gene Ontology
annotation, that integrates information about process,
function, and component. Clusters, consensus and related
similarity and gene ontology searches were electronically
organized and stored in a dedicated PostgreSQL database.
Identification of microsatellite containing ESTs
The unique sequences were screened for microsatellites by
using the MISA software [46]. Only di-, tri-, tetra-, pentaand esanucleotide repeats were targeted, since mononucleotide repeats are not useful for mapping or population
genetics due to difficulties in their genotyping. Strings of
oligonucleotide sequences were used to search for microsatellites: 6 repeats for dinucleotide; 5 repeats for trinucleotide; 5 repeats for tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide and
esanucleotide. Primers were designed for the flanking
regions of the SSR using a web-based software, "Primer3"

[47], and based on the criteria of 50% GC content, a minimum melting temperature of 55°C, and absence of secondary structure. Primers ranged from 18–27 nucleotides
in length and amplified products of 150–390 bp. The
primers were synthesized with a 5'-KS-tail (KS sequence:
5'-cgaggtcgacggtatcg-3') allowing to amplify microsatellite
alleles in combination with a 5'-fluorescent-labeled KS
primer [48].

which displayed differential expression in the head, thoracopods and photophores, compared with the abdomen.

Availability and requirements
Project name: Systematic sequencing of mRNA from the

Project home page: http://krill.cribi.unipd.it;

Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted for some genes using
the same tissues tested (head, abdomen, thoracopods and
photophores) to confirm the integrity and robustness of
EST sequencing.

Operating system(s): Debian GNU/Linux;

Three μg of total RNA from each tissue was used to perform three independent cDNA syntheses in a final volume
of 10 μl, using random decamers and SuperScript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). 1 μl aliquot of diluted
first-strand cDNA was PCR amplified in 10 μl volume
using SYBR Green chemistry, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Finnenzymes). Gene-specific
primers were designed using Primer Express® Software
(Applera) to amplify fragments of 120–180 bp in length,
close to the 3'-end of the transcript. To avoid the amplification of contaminant genomic DNA, we treated total
RNA samples with DNase I (Qiagen). The dissociation
curve was used to confirm the specificity of the amplicon.
PCR reactions were performed in a 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling conditions
were as follows: 15 min denaturation at 95°C; followed
by 40 cycles of 30 sec denaturation step at 95°C, annealing and elongation steps for 1 min each at 60°C and a
final 3 min elongation at 72°C. To evaluate differences in
gene expression a relative quantification method was chosen where the expression of the target gene is standardized
by a non-regulated reference gene; consequently, three
replicates of each sample and endogenous control were
amplified. 18S rRNA was used as an endogenous control
because the level of rRNA remains essentially constant
from sample to sample (QuantumRNA™ 18S Internal
Standards, Ambion). To calculate the relative expression
ratio, the 2-ΔΔCt (RQ, relative quantification) method
implemented in the 7500 Real Time PCR System software
[49] was used. This method determines the change in
expression of a nucleic acid sequence (target) in a test
sample relative to the same sequence in a calibrator sample. In our experiments, the expression of ten targets was
tested (compound eye opsin BCRH1, myosin light chain,
myosin heavy chain, arthrodial cuticle protein AMP16.3, tail
muscle elongation factor 1 gamma, cellular retinoic acid/retinol
binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A, transport protein SEC61 subunit gamma, chromodomain helicase DNA
binding protein and voltage-dependent calcium channel)
