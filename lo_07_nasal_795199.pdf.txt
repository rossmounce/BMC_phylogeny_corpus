Abstract
Background: To evaluate the prevalence and microbiological characterization of communityacquired (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal carriage in a kindergarten.
Methods: Point prevalence study. Nasal swabs were collected from healthy children younger than
7 years of age who were attending a kindergarten in Taipei, Taiwan. A parent questionnaire
regarding MRSA risk factors was administered simultaneously. All CA-MRSA colonization isolates
were archived for subsequent antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular typing.
Results: Of the 68 children who participated in the study, 17 (25%) had S. aureus isolated from
nasal swabs. Nine (13.2%) of the 68 children had CA-MRSA carriage, and none of them had any
identified risk factors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed all of the 9 CA-MRSA
colonization isolates had uniformly high resistance (100%) to both clindamycin and erythromycin,
the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-constitutive phenotype and the ermB gene. Pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis revealed 8 (88.9%) of 9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates were genetically related
and multilocus sequence typing revealed all isolates had sequence type 59. All of the colonization
isolates carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV, but none were positive for
the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that a single predominant CA-MRSA colonization
strain featuring high clindamycin resistance circulated in this kindergarten. Additionally, due to the
established transmissibility of colonization isolates, the high prevalence of nasal carriage of CAMRSA among healthy attendees in kindergartens may indicate the accelerated spread of CA-MRSA
in the community.

Background
Beginning in the late 1990s, studies from various cities in
the United States and other countries reported a significant prevalence of community-acquired (CA) methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization or
infection among both children and adults [1-6], and especially the presence of increasing numbers of patients with
CA-MRSA who do not appear to demonstrate evident risk
factors [2,4-6]. Reports of pediatric deaths as a consequence of CA-MRSA infections further illustrated the
potential seriousness of this emergence [1].
Recently, the results of our epidemiological investigation
relating to CA-MRSA infections among healthy children
in Taiwan have also been a cause for concern because they
indirectly reflect that there might be a reservoir of children
with asymptomatic CA-MRSA colonization in the community [7]. Because of the geographic diversity in the
prevalence of MRSA carriage and the possible transmission from any individual colonized with MRSA [8], measurement of the rate of CA-MRSA carriage may be helpful
to estimate the potential for spread of CA-MRSA in the
community. Therefore, this preliminary study was conducted to determine the prevalence of CA-MRSA colonization of the anterior nares among healthy attendees of a
kindergarten. In addition to characterizing these CAMRSA colonization isolates, we also compared them with
healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates via
molecular analyses.

Methods
Study subjects
This was a point prevalence study conducted in a kindergarten in northern Taiwan. The study proposal was
reviewed and approved by the National Defense Medical
Center Institutional Review Board. Participant or parental
informed consent was obtained in all cases. The kindergarten was a for-profit facility that the director had owned
and operated for 28 years. Attendees were divided into the
following four classes by age: toddler (2-younger than 4
years), older toddler (4-younger than 5 years), preschool
child (5-younger than 6 years), and child attending the
kindergarten prior to leaving for school (6-younger than 7
years). All classes shared a room for an average of one-half
hour in the morning and indoor play areas.

All kindergarten attendees younger than 7 years of age,
regardless of their medical history, were considered eligible to participate in this study. Participants and their
guardians were approached by the same investigative
team throughout the study period.
Cultures and questionnaires
After obtaining written consent, study personnel verbally
administered a questionnaire to the guardians to collect

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/51

demographic data and information on risk factors of all
children and their household contacts. Risk factors for
MRSA infection analyzed in this study included the following: (1) hospitalization, surgery, endotracheal intubation or antimicrobial therapy in the previous 12 months,
(2) underlying chronic disorder (e.g., asthma, chronic
lung disease, atopic dermatitis, heart disease or neurological disease) (3) presence of an indwelling venous or urinary catheter, or (4) household contact with an individual
with an identified risk factor, (e.g., long-term care facility
residence, intravenous drug abuse, recurrent skin infections, history of MRSA infection or colonization) or a
worker in a health care environment in the 12 months
preceding the culture [9].
A specimen for culture was obtained from both anterior
nares of each enrolled child with a sterile dry cotton swab,
pre-moistened with sterile water. The swab was immediately inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar which was
then incubated for 36 to 48 hours at 35°C.
Bacterial strains and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
Staphylococci were identified based on colonial morphology, catalase testing, tube-coagulase testing, DNase reaction, mannitol fermentation, tellurite reduction, and an
oxidation-fermentation test. MRSA identification and
antimicrobial susceptibility were determined according to
the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly
known as the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory
Standards) guidelines [10,11]. In vitro macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-inducible (MLSi) phenotypes were
detected by the double-disk diffusion assay [12]. During
the study period, all children colonized with CA-MRSA
isolates were compared with consecutive control subjects
with HA-MRSA infection. Susceptibility to penicillin-G,
oxacillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was determined using the disc-diffusion
method [10,11].
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
MLST was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification and sequencing of seven housekeeping
genes using primers designed by Enright et al [13]. Each
sequence was submitted to the MLST database website for
assignment of the allelic profile and sequence type (ST).
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
All S. aureus nasal-colonization isolates were analyzed for
epidemiologic relatedness by PFGE of chromosomal DNA
performed using the enzyme SmaI (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, Mass, USA). DNA was separated in 0.9% agarose
gels at 14°C in 0.5× TBE buffer with a CHEF Mapper XA
system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) for
31.5 h, with initial and final switching times of 2 and 30

s, respectively. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide
and photographed under UV illumination. The derived
patterns were analyzed using GelCompar software
(Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). Results were analyzed
using the unweighted pair group method for arithmetic
averages (UPGMA) and the Dice coefficient with 1.2%
band tolerance [14]. The strain types were designated in
alphabetical order, and a new type, if identified, was designated consecutively. MRSA isolates sharing closely
related PFGE profiles from one existing strain type were
defined as its subtypes and labeled with suffixes of Arabic
numbers.

children was 5.5 years, and there was an equal number of
boys and girls. Nasal screening identified 17 (25%) S.
aureus carriers including 8 (11.8%) CA methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) carriers and 9 (13.2%) CA-MRSA
carriers. Of the 9 children colonized with CA-MRSA
(median age, 5.7 years), none exhibited any identified risk
factor.
Antibiotic susceptibility profiles of CA-MRSA colonization
isolates
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates showed the following susceptibility
rates: vancomycin (100%), gentamicin (88.9%), tetracycline (100%), clindamycin (0%), erythromycin (0%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (100%) and ciprofloxacin
(100%). For CA-MSSA and CA-MRSA colonization isolates, the rates of resistance to erythromycin (50% and
100%, respectively) and clindamycin (0% and 100%,
respectively) were significantly different. Moreover, the
CA-MRSA isolates from children in the colonizationgroup were more likely to be susceptible to gentamicin,
tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin than the HA-MRSA isolates (Table 1). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups with
respect to susceptibilities to either clindamycin or erythromycin.

Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec)
typing
SCCmec typing was performed by means of PCR using sets
of region-specific primers as described elsewhere [15,16].
PCR amplification of mecA, lukS-PV, lukF-PV, ermA,
ermB, ermC and msrA
PCR for mecA was performed using relevant published
sequences and temperature parameters [17]. The PCR
amplification of the lukS-PV, lukF-PV, and genes encoding
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) components was performed as described elsewhere [18]. The presence of MLS
resistance genes (ermA, ermB, ermC and msrA) was determined according to previously described methods
[19,20].

Of the 9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates tested using the
double-disk diffusion method and PCR for detection of
macrolide resistance genes, all had the MLS-constitutive
(MLSc) phenotype and ermB gene.

Statistical analysis
Data collection and analyses were performed with the
Fisher's exact test using SPSS software, version 10.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences; SPSS for Windows,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P value of < 0.05 was considered
to represent a statistically significant difference between
tested groups.

Molecular characterization of CA-MRSA colonization
isolates
All of the 9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates tested positive
for the mecA gene and had the ST59 genetic background.
The 17 S. aureus isolates collected for PFGE typing were
categorized into 7 distinct PFGE patterns (Figure 1). The
pulsotypes of all 9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates tested
differed from those of the 8 MSSA colonization isolates.
In addition, based on the interpretable phylogenetic tree,

1 set of CA-MRSA colonization isolates (type A, A1, A2 and
A3) (8/9; 88.9%) appeared to be clustered, with homology percentages of >80%, while the other isolate from 1
colonized child was a distinct strain, type B. Two subjects
with CA-MRSA were a sibling pair and their isolates
belonged to strain type A. The 2 children colonized with
strain type A1 were unrelated. Moreover, in addition to the
9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates, HA-MRSA isolates from
clinical specimens collected from our hospitalized
patients and matched by the geographical area and study
period were also included in the PFGE analysis. The SmaI
genomic fingerprints of the HA-MRSA isolates from these
corresponding hospitalized patients were found to be
totally different from those of the CA-MRSA nasal-colonization isolates (data not shown).
The results of SCCmec typing demonstrated that SCCmec
type IV (100%) was the most-common type, nevertheless,
staphylococcal toxin genes lukS-PV and lukF-PV were not
present in any of the 9 CA-MRSA colonization isolates.

Discussion
The S. aureus prevalence among children participating in
this study was 25%, a value consistent with historical rates
of S. aureus colonization [21]. Although various reports
have suggested that the carriage of MRSA by persons without health care-associated risks has increased, significant
heterogeneity among the study population existed [22].
The rate of CA-MRSA carriage of 13.2% in this study is
within the reported range for children [23-25]. However,
a recent study by Alfaro et al [26] found the highest
reported rate (22%) of MRSA carriage in a group of South
Texas children. This rate, which was higher than in the
present study, was also found in one of the first known

areas to experience the emergence and epidemic of CAMRSA infections in children.
Review of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in this
study demonstrated that both clindamycin and erythromycin resistance were extraordinarily high among our CAMRSA colonization isolates, which is in contrast with previous studies of CA-MRSA isolates from hospitalized children or adults, and colonized children [4,27,28]. Based
on erythromycin resistance, S. aureus can be divided into
2 distinct phenotypes expressed either constitutively or
inducibly [19]. In this study, the MLSc phenotype was
more prevalent than MLSi phenotype in CA-MRSA colonization isolates, which is in agreement with previous studies [19,29,30]. In 2002, Almer et al [19] and also other
investigators [29,31] reported ermA was the dominant erm
gene present in their MRSA isolates and that the prevalence of ermB in S. aureus was less than 2%. Recently, SCCmec types II and III in HA-MRSA isolates were shown to
contain ermA gene on a transposon (Tn554), which is
responsible for inducible MLS resistance [32-34]. Moreover, in USA300 (ST8) CA-MRSA strains, constitutive MLS
resistance was mediated by ermC gene that is typically
located on a plasmid (pUSA03) [35,36]. In the present
study, however, ermB was more widespread than ermA or
ermC among CA-MRSA colonization isolates, which is in
agreement with our recent findings in CA-MRSA isolates
causing skin and soft-tissue infections [7]. In Taiwan, the
widespread use of antimicrobials in the community may
elicit some level of selective pressure which may account
for the remarkably high incidence of clindamycin and
erythromycin resistance among CA-MRSA isolates from
colonized children [37,38].
In Europe, PVL genes have been associated with S. aureus
isolates deriving from community-associated staphylococcal skin infections and also necrotizing pneumonia
[18,39]. Recent evidence revealed that, although they do
not share a common genetic lineage, PVL genes and the
SCCmec IV allele are more prevalent among CA-MRSA
strains from 3 different continents than among HA-MRSA
strains globally [40]. In our colonized CA-MRSA isolates,
SCCmec IV was indeed common, however, PVL genes
were not found in any of these isolates. Since this observation is somewhat limited by the small number of isolates analyzed, persistent sampling from different parts of
Taiwan and further molecular studies of such isolates are
required to clarify this phenomenon. Although all 9 CAMRSA colonization isolates were ST59, comparisons of
PFGE patterns in this study indicated that 8 (88.9%) of
the 9 isolates from this kindergarten were of a single
clonal origin. The eight patterns were not indistinguishable by PFGE, but differed by 1 to 2 bands. Analysis of the
results of this study suggest that 1 predominant CA-MRSA
strain was circulating in the studied kindergarten and may

be colonizing individuals not previously believed to be at
risk.
6.

Conclusion
Our data suggest that the clonal spread of CA-MRSA was
principally responsible for the high MRSA burden in this
kindergarten. Of particular interest and importance is the
future impact to the community or, indeed, elsewhere,
should this common clone of CA-MRSA become more
prevalent in Taiwan. Accordingly, much larger epidemiological studies pertaining to MRSA in the community are
warranted to determine the scope of this emerging problem.
