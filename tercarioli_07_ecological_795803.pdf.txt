Abstract
Background: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ecology is not completely understood, although several
pieces of evidence point to the soil as its most probable habitat. The present study aimed to
investigate the fungal growth, conidia production and molecular pathogen detection in different soil
conditions.
Methods: Soils samples of clayey, sandy and medium textures were collected from ground surface
and the interior of armadillo burrows in a hyperendemic area of Paracoccidioidomycosis. P.
brasiliensis was inoculated in soil with controlled humidity and in culture medium containing soil
extracts. The molecular detection was carried out by Nested PCR, using panfungal and species
specific primers from the ITS-5.8S rDNA region.
Results: The soil texture does not affect fungus development and the growth is more abundant
on/in soil saturated with water. Some soil samples inhibited the development of P. brasiliensis,
especially those that contain high values of Exchangeable Aluminum (H+Al) in their composition.
Some isolates produced a large number of conidia, mainly in soil-extract agar medium. The
molecular detection was positive only in samples collected from armadillo burrows, both in sandy
and clayey soil.
Conclusion: P. brasiliensis may grow and produce the infectious conidia in sandy and clayey soil,
containing high water content, mainly in wild animal burrows, but without high values of H+Al.

Background
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most important systemic
mycosis in Latin America [1]. While fungus can be iso-

lated in its yeast form from patients, naturally infected
armadillos and recently also dogs, the same does not hold
true in nature where fungus may occur in its mycelial form
producing the suspected infective propagules. The pathoPage 1 of 8

gen has been isolated only sporadically from soil and
related materials, such as dog food and feces of bats and
penguins [2-8]. The main route for infection seems to be
by inhalation of airborne propagules, but the long latency
period of the disease and the lack of epidemic outbreaks
also create difficulties in determining under which circumstances the primary infection occurs [9]. The production of arthrospores in vitro has been documented [10],
which also proved to be infectious in some animal models
[11], but the number of these infectious structures has
been observed to be very low and even absent for some
isolates and/or culture conditions [10]. The influence of
soil texture and chemical composition in fungus development has been little understood. Although in a same
hyperendemic area infected armadillos occur both in
sandy and clayey soil [12], the human infection seems to
be more prevalent in regions where clayey soil is more
abundant [13]. In this paper, we aimed to study the
growth ability of fungus and its conidia production in different soil conditions, as well as fungus detection by PCR
in soil collected from representative environmental conditions in an area hyperendemic for the disease.

Methods
Fungal isolates
Three P. brasiliensis isolates obtained from armadillos
(T5LN1, T9B1 and T10B1) and three obtained from
human patients (BT84, BT85 and D01) were maintained
on Glucose Peptone Yeast Agar (GPYA: 2% Glucose, 1%
Peptone, 2% Agar and 0.5% Yeast Extract) at 36°C in their
yeast phase.

Collection and analysis of soil macronutrients
Soil samples of different textures (clayey, sandy and
medium) were collected both from the surface and the
interior of armadillo burrows located in Botucatu County
and on a fluvial island in São Manuel County, both from
the PCM hyperendemic area of Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The collection sites were chosen according to the map
of soil texture distribution for the region [14-16] and
marked by GPS (Global Positioning System) (Figure 1).
Representative samples from 9 different collection sites
were obtained and sent for macronutrient analysis at the
Soil Fertility Laboratory of the College of Agronomic Sciences-UNESP (Botucatu, São Paulo) (Table 1). The field
capacity (FC), which indicates the amount of water
present in soil after being saturated and drained of its
excess, was also determined for each soil type [17]. Flasks
containing around 500 g of each kind of soil texture were
sterilized at 120°C for 30 min (twice), for further culturing of P. brasiliensis.
Culturing of P. brasiliensis on soil
Approximately fifty grams of sterilized soil (clayey and
sandy) saturated with distilled water was placed into Petri
Dishes, where four yeast fragments were inoculated and
maintained at 25°C.
Culturing of P. brasiliensis on soil with controlled
humidity
The soil samples were dried at 120°C for 24 h. Fifty grams
of this soil was placed into Petri Dishes and sterilized at
120°C for 15 min. Depending on the FC of each soil, dif-

by the slide culture technique and also by using adhesive
tape (Durex, 3 M), which was softly touched onto the surface of the colonies, previously killed by formaldehyde
vapor for 48 h. The slides were stained with Lactophenol
cotton blue. For some productive conidia isolates, we also
compared the number of conidia between SEA and GPYA
with SE, by counting at least 10 different microscopic slide
fields. The slides were observed and documented in an
Olympus Photomicrographic System (PM-30), as well as
by Leica Digital Photomicrography (DMLB) with the software Leica Qwin Lite 2.5 to estimate the conidium sizes.

ferent volumes of sterile distilled water were added to
reach three different humidity degrees: low (soil with half
of its FC), medium (soil with one whole FC) and high
(soil saturated in water). For this experiment, two yeast
fragments of isolates T5LN1, T9B1 and BT84 were cultured for each soil texture and maintained at 25°C.
Culturing of P. brasiliensis in Soil Extract Agar (SEA),
Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and GPY Agar (GPYA) plus
Soil Extract (SE)
Soil extract from different soil textures and compositions
were prepared by mixing 1 kg of soil with 1L of distilled
water, sterilized in an autoclave 120°C for 30 min, filtered
in a glass funnel containing gauze plus cotton and pH
adjusted to 7.0. The soil extracts were prepared with samples of sandy SE collected from the Capivarinha River, of
clayey SE from Lageado Farm and of medium SE from
Patrulha (Table 1). The SEA (0.2% Glucose, 0.1% Yeast
extract, 1.5% Agar and 50% v/v of SE) was prepared
according to Kwon-Chung [18]. For the PDA (OXOID)
and GPYA (2% Glucose, 0.5% Peptone, 0.5% Yeast
extract, 1.5% Agar), the SE was added at 30% v/v. Four
yeast fragments were seeded in duplicate plates that were
maintained at 25°C. For this experiment five isolates were
used: BT84, D01, T5LN1, T9B1 and T10B1.
Growth ability of P. brasiliensis
For each treatment, the fungal growth was evaluated macroscopically for 8 weeks by measuring the diameter of colonies in centimeters.
Conidia production
The conidia production of the isolates BT84, BT85, D01,
T5LN1, T9B1 and T10B1 was evaluated microscopically

Statistical analysis
The number of conidia per field in different conditions
and the measure of mycelial growth of P. brasiliensis in
SEA, GPYA and PDA plus SE were analyzed through
ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer (software GraphPad
InStat).
DNA extraction
The DNA was extracted from the yeast phase of P. brasiliensis (positive control) according to Van Burik et al. [19].
The DNA extraction from soil seeded with P. brasiliensis
(positive control) and from environmental samples was
carried out by using Fast DNA® Spin Kit for Soil (Qbio
gene INC), with minor modifications according to Theodoro et al.[20]. A total of 21 crude environmental soil
samples of different textures (clayey, sandy and medium)
collected both from the surface (4 samples) and the interior of armadillo burrows (17 samples) were processed.
Nested PCR from soil samples
The molecular detection was carried out by Nested-PCR
reactions, using the panfungal primers ITS4 and ITS5 as
outer primers [21] and PbITSE and PbITSR as inner primers [20]. The reactions were carried out in 25 μl of reaction
mixture (10 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PCR buffer – 50 mM
KCL and 10 mM Tris HCL -, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
dNTP, 10 pmoles of each primer and 1 unit of Taq
polymerase-Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). The
amplification was done in a thermocycler (MJ Research,
Inc, USA). The thermal cycling for ITS4/ITS5 was: 94°C
for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 60°C
for 2 min, 72°C for 2 min and a final cycle at 72°C for 7
min. For PbITSE/PbITSR primers the conditions were similar, except for the annealing temperature which was 62°C
[20].

Two amplicons from the Capivarinha River and two from
Lageado Farm, all from burrows, were purified with GFX
PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (Amershan Biosciences) and both strands were directly sequenced in a
Mega Bace™ 1000 (Amershan Biosciences) with reactions
performed according to DYEnamic ET Dye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amershan Biosciences). The

sequences were submitted to Blastn (Basic Local Alignment Tool for Nucleotide) and aligned using Clustal W
program.

Results
P. brasiliensis growth ability in soil with different chemical
and physical compositions
Macronutrient analyses of soil samples are in Table 1. The
fungal growth was similar in clayey and sandy soil textures. No growth was observed when the soil composition
contained high values of Exchangeable Aluminum (H+Al)
and, consequently, a low Bases Saturation value (V%),
such as those from Patrulha Lageado and Serrito Island
(Table 2). Most of the isolates presented the yeast-mycelia
transition in the first week and had reached high mycelial
growth by the 8th week. The isolate BT84 did not grow in
any soil sample. There were some differences among the
isolates concerning the growth and macroscopic mycelial
morphology (Table 2).
Effect of soil humidity on P. brasiliensis growth
The fungal growth was higher in soil saturated with water
than in soil with moderate humidity, determined by its
field capacity (FC). There was no growth on low humidity

(Table 3).
Culturing of P. brasiliensis in SEA and in GPYA and PDA
plus SE
Most fragments cultured on SEA presented the yeast-mycelia transition during the second week. The isolate BT84
presented the smallest growth in the two soil textures. The
isolates T9B1 and T10B1 attained high mycelial growth in
the 8th week while the isolates T5LN1 and D01 grew only
moderately during this period (Table 2). SE prepared from
clayey or sandy soil tended to induce the same growth, but
when prepared with soil containing high values of H+Al,
the growth also occurred, although at low intensity for
most isolates and the colonies showing a glabrous aspect
(Figure 2).

The addition of SE on GPYA and PDA seemed to have had
no effect on fungal growth.
Conidia production
The isolates T9B1, BT85 and D01 produced a large
amount of arthro- and aleuroconidia in the different SEA
(Figure 3), while the isolates T5LN1, T10B1 and BT84 did
not produce conidia. The adhesive tape slides stained with
lactophenol cotton blue showed more conidia per field
than the slide culture technique (p < 0.05).

The isolates T9B1 and D01 produced fewer conidia in
GPYA plus SE than in SEA (p < 0.05) and the isolate Bt85
did not produce any conidia in GPYA plus SE in slide culture.
The width and length of conidia were 2.88 μm ± 0.57 and
3.49 μm ± 0.69, respectively.

Although some ecological aspects of P. brasiliensis are still
unknown, several pieces of evidence point to the soil as its
main saprobic habitat. Other related thermo-dimorphic
species, such as Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis and Histoplasma capsulatum, have already been determined to be associated with soil [22-24]. In our
paracoccidioidomycosis hyperendemic area, a high
number of human cases seem to be associated with clayey
soil areas, while infected armadillos have been observed
also in sandy soil [12,13]. We observed here that fungus
can develop both on clayey and sandy soils when in high
humidity. Thus, the major incidence of paracoccidioidomycosis in clayey soil areas may be due to the widespread use of this soil type in agricultural activity by rural
workers that represent most disease cases. The data also
confirm that humidity is an important ecological factor
for fungus occurrence in soil. It was already suggested that
the presence of the pathogen in the environment may be
associated with high amounts of rainfall and abundant
watercourses [25]. Some soil conditions, in particular that

Page 5 of 8
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:92

contains elevated Exchangeable Aluminum (H+Al) may
inhibit or limit fungus growth. This fact was observed in
some soil samples that, in this study, were the same as
medium-textured soils. High values of Exchangeable Aluminum determine low values of Base Saturation, since
they are connected and inversely proportional [26]. These
data also corroborate the results of P. brasiliensis isolation
from armadillos in the same endemic area. While at most
capture sites the animals were culture positive, in one
restricted area with high levels of Exchangeable Aluminum, all evaluated armadillos were culture negative [12].
It is important to emphasize that the paracoccidioidomycosis "reservarea", i.e., the location where the pathogen
habitat and infection coincide, is influenced by several
abiotic factors. For example, water availability depends on
soil characteristics, precipitation and evaporation rate.
Under the same climatic conditions, clayey soils can
retain more water and nutrients than sandy ones, due to
the greater surface area per mass unit of clay particles [13].
Although we observed that the soil texture was not directly
responsible for the fungal growth in the environment, the
local climatic conditions associated with the soil texture
would determine the development of the pathogen in its
saprobic phase.
Some isolates could be more able to develop in their
saprobic phase, such as T9B1 which presented the highest
growth in all conditions, while other isolates could disperse more slowly and produce few or no conidia, such as
BT84 which presented the least development and did not
produce any propagula. Conidia production in P. brasiliensis is considered to be rare and difficult to obtain in the
traditional culture conditions. Restrepo and colleagues
[27,28] induced its production by adding natural substrates in the media, such as Soil Extract Agar SEA. Conidia
production was also induced in poor media such as yeast
extract, glucose-salts and water-agar media. The SEA
media proved to be very efficient for the conidia study due
to their large recovery, which was greater than in GPY Agar
plus soil extract. The morphological aspects and measures
of the conidia observed herein were similar to some previous studies and compatible with airborne infection
[10].
Experimental models of infection by conidia, by the intranasal route, in mice, showed that these propagules have
infectious potential, being able to initiate paracoccidioidomycosis disease [11]. Furthermore, the conidium consists of a eukaryotic cell, containing nutrient reserves,
which would allow its survival in the environment [29].
Due to its thermodimorphic property, a conidium can
develop into both a mycelial and yeast phase, depending
on the substrate (saprobic or host tissues) [30]. Since
conidia production seems to be an important feature for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/92

P. brasiliensis infection and dissemination in animal hosts,
the SEA media can be used as an important tool for the
study of the interaction of this pathogen with its microhabitat.
There were some differences among the isolates both in
growth ability and conidia production. For example, one
isolate (BT84) practically does not grow in soil while all
the others growth well. Some isolates did not produce
conidia while in others the conidia production was relatively high, mainly when the fungus was grown on relatively poor substrates containing soil extracts. These
features could be associated with the genetic background
of the isolates and also related to the evolutionary history
of the pathogen. For example, the isolates T10B1 and
BT84, which are considered to be from the same phylogenetic species (PS2) group, according to Matute et al.
(2005) [31], did not produce any conidia, while in the
isolates T9B1, BT85 and T5LN1, which belong to the S1
species group, significant conidia production is present.
This feature (conidia production) may be taken into
account as a morpho/physiological marker in order to
help distinguish the several P. brasiliensis cryptic species.
The positive Nested PCR in soil samples from armadillo
burrows and the negative amplifications from surface soil
samples reinforce the idea that the pathogen habitat is
strongly related to the presence of the 9-banded armadillo
[12]. It is possible that the soil from inside the burrows is
not submitted to great variations in humidity, temperature, shade and other abiotic factors, compared to the surface soil. Thus the armadillo burrows and their
surrounding areas must be considered important sites of
infection risk, which would explain the high paracoccidioidomycosis incidence in patients who had some contact
with this animal [25].
The characterization of the saprobic phase of P. brasiliensis, concerning its soil growth ability and conidia production, developed in this study can be useful for a better
understanding of the pathogen ecology as well as for further studies on morpho/physiological differences among
the several new cryptic species. Besides that, our results
proved the repeatability and applicability of the molecular technique, previously developed in our laboratory, to
several environmental samples, identifying some infection risk areas for human beings.

Conclusion
While soil texture is not a determinative factor for the
development of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, humidity
plays an important role in fungus growth. Soils containing high amounts of H+Al might inhibit or limit the
growth of the pathogen. The conidia production of P. brasiliensis is dependent on the isolate genotype and is pro-

duced in especially high amounts in substrates containing
soil extracts. Specific molecular detection of the pathogen
indicates P. brasiliensis may occur preferentially in soils
from protected places such as from the interior of armadillo burrows. These findings may contribute to identifying places where the pathogen occurs in the environment,
helping us to map risk areas for infection while contributing to the understanding of the fungus ecology and disease epidemiology.
