localized in extracellular domains of mammalian
CC motif chemokine receptor proteins

Abstract
Background: CC chemokine receptor proteins (CCR1 through CCR10) are seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled
receptors whose signaling pathways are known for their important roles coordinating immune system responses
through targeted trafficking of white blood cells. In addition, some of these receptors have been identified as fusion
proteins for viral pathogens: for example, HIV-1 strains utilize CCR5, CCR2 and CCR3 proteins to obtain cellular entry in
humans. The extracellular domains of these receptor proteins are involved in ligand-binding specificity as well as
pathogen recognition interactions.
In mammals, the majority of chemokine receptor genes are clustered together; in humans, seven of the ten genes are
clustered in the 3p21-24 chromosome region. Gene conversion events, or exchange of DNA sequence between genes,
have been reported in chemokine receptor paralogs in various mammalian lineages, especially between the
cytogenetically closely located pairs CCR2/5 and CCR1/3. Datasets of mammalian orthologs for each gene were
analyzed separately to minimize the potential confounding impact of analyzing highly similar sequences resulting
from gene conversion events.
Molecular evolution approaches and the software package Phylogenetic Analyses by Maximum Likelihood (PAML)
were utilized to investigate the signature of selection that has acted on the mammalian CC chemokine receptor (CCR)
gene family. The results of neutral vs. adaptive evolution (positive selection) hypothesis testing using Site Models are
reported. In general, positive selection is defined by a ratio of nonsynonymous/synonymous nucleotide changes (dN/
dS, or ω) >1.
Results: Of the ten mammalian CC motif chemokine receptor sequence datasets analyzed, only CCR2 and CCR3
contain amino acid codon sites that exhibit evidence of positive selection using site based hypothesis testing in PAML.
Nineteen of the twenty codon sites putatively indentified as likely to be under positive selection code for amino acid
residues located in extracellular domains of the receptor protein products.
Conclusions: These results suggest that amino acid residues present in intracellular and membrane-bound domains
are more selectively constrained for functional signal transduction and homo- or heterodimerization, whereas amino
acid residues in extracellular domains of these receptor proteins evolve more quickly, perhaps due to heightened
selective pressure resulting from ligand-binding and pathogen interactions of extracellular domains.

erotrimeric GTP-binding (G protein-coupled) 7-transmembrane receptors [1-3]. Chemokines are the largest
family of cytokines [4]. Currently, 42 ligand molecules
and 19 receptors belong to the chemokine superfamily of
cytokines [5]. Within the chemokine superfamily, protein
sub-families are distinguished by differences in amino
acid sequence motif of four conserved cysteines residues

adjacent cysteines that are both involved in intra-chain
disulfide bridges [7]. There are ten CC motif chemokine
receptors (CCR1 through CCR10) that bind these ligands
with differing ligand binding specificity [2,5].
Chemokines, in conjunction with adhesion molecules,
recruit specific subpopulations of leukocytes by activating various receptors and initiating signaling through G
protein-coupled pathways [8,9]. The signaling of
chemokines through their receptors affect various cellular outcomes including leukocyte trafficking, gene transcription, degranulation of immune response cells,
mitogenic processes, and apoptosis [2,5,6,8]. Chemokines
generally act as secondary pro-inflammatory mediators
that are induced by primary pro-inflammatory mediators
[1].
Nucleotide mutations in the open reading frame coding
for chemokine receptors can have a dramatic effect on
receptor activity or little effect, depending on the location
of the substitution and the nature of the amino acid
replacement: amino acid substitutions resulting in alterations at key ligand binding extracellular domains or intracellular G-protein coupled domains in particular are
known to result in disrupted or abnormal receptor activity [4]. Deficient signal transduction can result in
increased susceptibility to infectious diseases as a result
of the lack of a robust signaling response to pathogenic
infection [10-16]. Mutations in the regulatory nucleotide
sequence of chemokine receptors can also result in
changes in gene expression and subsequent protein activity [17,18].
In addition to their roles as pro-inflammatory agents in
innate immune response through binding of endogenous
ligands and subsequent receptor activation, some
chemokine receptors have been co-opted to act as receptors or fusion proteins for a number of pathogens including HIV-1 strains [19,20], protozoan parasites
Plasmodium knowlesi and P. vivax [21], and Epstein-Barr
virus [22]; herpesviruses mimic host chemokine receptors to elude host immune responses [23]. Mutations in
regulatory or coding sequences for chemokine receptors
that are used as pathogen fusion proteins can alter hostpathogen interactions: amino acid substitutions in extracellular domains can prevent recognition by the pathogen
or interfere with the pathogen's ability to utilize the
receptor as a gateway into the cell. Genetic markers associated with disease resistance have been found in regulatory and coding sequences of chemokine receptors [2429].
Because of their critical role in signaling immune
responses, chemokine receptors are subjects of intense
selection to accommodate signaling molecules, and are
expected to experience purifying selection to maintain
conformation and functionality of ligand binding and signaling [30]. However, because of their role as targets of

Page 2 of 9

pathogen entry, chemokine receptors are also expected to
experience positive selection pressure in response to
viral/pathogen hijacking [31]. Loci that are involved in
responses to a variety of pathogens may experience balancing selection as a result of diverging selection pressures acting simultaneously on genes which may result in
the maintenance of polymorphism [32]. Given this apparent evolutionary tension, it is of interest to investigate the
signature of selection on this subfamily of chemokine
receptors.

Results
Hypothesis Testing with Site Models

This paper presents the results of PAML hypothesis testing on chemokine receptor sequence datasets with "Site"
models only [33,34]. These models analyze sequence data
at the level of the codon, and test whether a hypothesis
(model) that allows for positive selection (dN/dS > 1 for
some codons) is better fit to the data when compared to a
null neutral hypothesis (model), determined through performing a likelihood ratio test between the likelihood
scores of the null neutral and selection models. Each set
of orthologous gene sequences was analyzed independently of one another such that only CCR1 gene
sequences were included in the first data set, only CCR2
gene sequences were included in the second data set, and
so on for each of the ten CCR genes (i.e., paralogous
genes were not in the same data set).
When testing the hypothesis that some codon sites
within chemokine receptor coding sequences have experienced positive selection pressure, significant results
were obtained for some codons within the genes CCR2
and CCR3 (Table 1). For CCR2, the comparison between
a null neutral site model which does not allow positive
selection (M1a) and a selection site model (M2a) yielded
a likelihood ratio test statistic of 5.45, which did not allow
for rejection of the null hypothesis of neutral selection.
However, the comparison between an additional pair of
site models, M7 (null, neutral) and M8 (selection) for
CCR2 yielded a likelihood test ratio statistic of 15.22, significant at p = 0.001, and a proportion of sites (0.02430,
2.4%) with ω = 2.83526. The analysis for CCR2 had a total
of 380 amino acid sites, and nine amino acid sites were
identified as sites of positive selection (Table 2) using
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis [35]. One of the
nine amino acid sites identified under positive selection
had strong support with BEB posterior probability >95%.
Eight of the nine amino acids identified as having experienced positive selection in the coding sequence of CCR2
are located in extracellular domains of the protein; one
positively selected amino acid residue is located in the
second transmembrane domain, near the transmembrane/extracellular boundary (Figure 1).

For hypothesis testing of site models with CCR3 gene
sequences, the comparison of M1a (neutral) vs. M2a
(selection) site models led to rejection of the null, neutral
hypothesis in favor of selection with a likelihood test ratio
statistic of 19.84, significant at p = 0.001, with a proportion of sites (0.01346 1%), and ω = 5.44115, indicating
positive selection for those codon sites (Table 1). Five
specific codon sites within the coding sequence were
reported under positive selection with a BEB analysis following site testing: one site had strong support with BEB
posterior probability greater than 95%, and one site had
very strong support with BEB posterior probability
greater than 99% (Table 2). A significant result was also
obtained in the comparison of the second set of site models, M7 versus M8, with a test statistic of 22.3, significant
at p = 0.001, with a proportion of sites (0.01637, ~1.6%)
having a dN/dS value of 5.44 (Table 1). The analysis for
CCR3 included 361 amino acid sites, and eleven specific
amino acid sites were reported under positive selection
with a BEB analysis following the site test. Three of these
positively selected amino acid sites had posterior probabilities greater than 95%, one site had a posterior probability greater than 99% (Table 2). All of the positively

selected sites identified for CCR3 in this analysis were
located in extracellular domains of the receptor protein
(Figure 2). A summary of results (significant and non significant) for all site model tests is presented in Additional
File 1.

Discussion
None of the ten CC motif chemokine receptors has a signature of positive selection as indicated by an ω value
(ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions/synonymous substitutions, dN/dS) greater than one averaged over all
codons as determined by hypothesis testing using branch
models in PAML (unpublished results). Site tests, which
analyze the sequence at the unit of the codon, revealed a
proportion of codon sites that display evidence of positive
selection (ω > 1) within the coding sequences of CCR2
and CCR3. The results obtained under the two sets of site
models (M1a vs. M2a and M7 vs. M8) differ in some
aspects; for example, the more conservative M1a vs. M2a
comparison did not reveal statistically significant results
for CCR2 while the M7 vs. M8 comparison did reveal significant differences, allowing for the identification of positively selected sites. For CCR3, while both M1a vs. M2a

and M7 vs. M8 were both statistically significant comparisons, the comparison between M7 and M8 identified the
same five codon sites that had been identified under M1a
vs. M2a comparison as well as additional positively
selected sites that were not identified in the M1a vs. M2a
comparison. The differences in the results obtained using
different models reflect that the M1a vs. M2a comparison
is a more conservative test which may fail to detect positively selected sites identified by the less conservative M7
vs. M8 comparison.
It is interesting to note that in the results obtained for
CCR2 and CCR3, nineteen out of the twenty amino acid
sites that are identified as having experienced positive
selection are located in the extracellular domains of the
chemokine receptor proteins, suggesting that nonsynonymous substitutions are occurring, and more often being
selected for, in the ligand binding and pathogen interac-

tion regions of the receptors. Previous studies on CCR2,
CCR3 and other CC chemokine receptors have identified
the amine-terminus and extracellular domains as being
important for both the endogenous ligand-binding functions [36-42] as well as for binding efficacy for pathogens
in situations where these receptors have been co-opted as
fusion proteins [24,43-45]. These previous results coupled with the findings presented here point to the extracellular domains of CC chemokine receptor proteins
being especially relevant to studies of the evolution of
structure and function of receptors for endogenous
ligand binding ability and as targets of pathogen interaction.
Recombination or gene conversion between paralogs in
the chemokine receptor family has been investigated and
described, particularly for CCR2/5 conversion in several
orders of mammals [31,46-50]. Conversion events

between CCR1/3 in rodents have also been reported [31].
These conversion events have primarily involved transmembrane regions, but some conversion events have
occurred more extensively over CCR gene sequences and
have impacted extracellular domains; for example the
first extracellular loop of CCR5 converted by recombination with CCR2 in Mus [31], extracellular loop 2 of CCR5
converted by recombination with CCR2 in Homo and
Oryctolagus [31,46,50], and extracellular loop 3 of CCR3
converted by recombination with CCR1 in Mus [31].
Analysis of sequences that have undergone gene conversion can lead to higher rate of false-positives when
using maximum likelihood methods to detect positive
selection, particularly in small data sets with only a few
sequences, although the rate of false positives is only
increased moderately [51]. To minimize the impact of
gene conversion events on the results of this study and as
an alternative to eliminating sequences or parts of
sequences that have undergone conversion events, each
set of orthologous genes was analyzed independently of
one another such that highly similar sequences resulting
from gene conversion events within a species involving
paralogous genes were not included in the same analysis,
but rather were analyzed independently in separate data
sets (e.g., only CCR1 gene sequences were analyzed

together in one data set; CCR2 gene sequences were analyzed in a separate data set, and so on). In addition, a
Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis was used rather
than Naïve Empirical Bayes (NEB) to identify putative
codons under positive selection as NEB is less conservative and can be more prone to error in smaller data sets
[34,35] whereas BEB produces a low rate of false-positives with sequences that have experienced gene conversion [51].
Both of the genes containing positively selected codon
sites (CCR2 and CCR3) have been reported to have
undergone gene conversion events as discussed above;
however, in the case of CCR2, gene conversion events
have led to the conversion of CCR5 by CCR2, whereas in
the case of CCR3, it is CCR3 that has been converted by
CCR1. The results presented here, in which only one gene
of a gene conversion pair displays evidence of positive
selection through hypothesis testing, indicate that independent analyses of sequences that have undergone gene
conversion may mitigate the detection of false-positives
due to gene conversion.

Conclusions
Site tests, which analyze genetic sequences at the unit of
the codon, revealed a proportion of codon sites that dis-

play evidence of positive selection (ω > 1) within the coding sequences of mammalian CC motif chemokine
receptor genes CCR2 and CCR3. Nineteen of the twenty
amino acid sites identified as having experienced positive
selection are located in extracellular domains of the
chemokine receptor proteins CCR2 and CCR3. These
results suggest that amino acid residues present in intracellular and membrane-bound domains of mammalian CC
motif chemokine receptor proteins are more selectively
constrained, whereas amino acid residues in extracellular
domains of these receptor proteins evolve more quickly,
perhaps due to heightened selective pressure resulting
from ligand-binding and pathogen interactions of extracellular domains.

Methods
Genomic coding sequences for CCRs from a number of
placental mammals were obtained through searches of

the online database NCBI Gene [52]. Taxa included in the
data set were chosen using the recently updated placental
mammal phylogeny [53] and the online software application TimeTree [54,55] to estimate divergence times
between taxa (estimates given for nuclear genes were
used). For PAML analyses, taxa that have diverged more
than ~100 MYA may lead to decreased analytical power
due to highly divergent sequences, difficulty in sequence
alignment, and saturation of substitutions [56-58]; therefore, only taxa that have diverged less than 100 MYA were
included in the data set.
For genes that displayed alternative splicing patterns,
the presumed ancestral isoform sequence was identified
through alignment methods and included in the dataset
while the alternative isoforms were not. For CCR2, the
human isoform that localizes to the plasma membrane
was included in the CCR2 dataset, while the cytoplasmic
variant was not. Species and GenBank accession numbers

for sequences used in the analyses are listed in Additional
File 2.
Nucleotide alignments of chemokine receptor
sequences were generated using amino acid sequence
alignments and the software program TranAlign [59].
The output from TranAlign was converted to Nexus/
PAUP format and submitted to the software program
ModelTest [60] for selection of the most appropriate
model of evolution for each dataset by testing the fit of 56
different evolutionary models with the data set. ModelTest uses both hierarchical likelihood ratio testing and
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The best model was
chosen based on AIC score and the number of estimated
parameters. If there was a statistically insignificant difference between two models, the model with the fewest
number of estimated parameters was chosen to introduce
the least amount of uncertainty to the evolutionary analyses. Models used for analyses are summarized in Additional File 3.
Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony* (PAUP*) and
Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML)
Methods

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for each data set
(Additional Files 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13) were
constructed with the software package PAUP* [61]. Data
sets and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for each
gene were submitted to PAML CODEML version 4.1
under different models and parameters to test for adaptive evolution either at codon sites ("Site Model"), along
lineages ("Branch Model"), or at sites within lineages
("Branch-Site Model") [34]. This paper presents the
results of testing the data sets described with "Site" models only.
"Site" models allow the dN/dS ratio to vary across
codons within a sequence for a lineage. Proportions of
sites within each lineage were estimated to be in different
categories: positive selection is indicated by some codons
having a dN/dS > 1. The null, neutral model does not
allow positive selection and is compared to the alternative
hypothesis in which in which positive selection is
allowed.
Two sets of site models are commonly used to test
hypotheses of selection, and have been used here: M1a vs.
M2a and M7 vs. M8. In the first set of models, the model
M1a: Nearly Neutral allows 2 categories of codon sites in
p0, and p1 proportions, with ω0 < 1, and ω1 = 1, whereas
the model M2a: Selection allows an additional category of
codons (p2) with ω2 > 1, indicating positive selection. The
second set of site models compared is M7 and M8, in
which M7 specifies a neutral model with dN/dS ratios
across a continuous beta distribution with estimated
parameters p and q of the beta distribution, and M8 spec-

Page 7 of 9

ifies a similar model with an additional category for sites
that have dN/dS > 1, indicating positive selection. M7
assumes a beta distribution of ω values between 0 and 1,
and therefore does not allow any sites under positive
selection (ω > 1). The M8 model is similar to M7 in that it
also assumes a beta distribution for omega values, but
allows another category of sites in which ω > 1. The comparison between M7: beta and M8: beta +ω is less conservative, and may indicate positive selection even when
none is detected by the M1a: M2a comparison.
The PAML settings for the null (neutral) model M1a
were model = 0, NSsites = 1, and for the alternative
(selection) model M2a were model = 0, NSsites = 2. The
PAML settings for the null model M7 were model = 0,
NSsites = 7, and for the alternative (selection) model M8
were model = 0, NSsites = 8.
The likelihood estimates for each were compared using
a hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test (hLRT) of twice the
difference in log likelihood values of the models being
compared (2ΔlnL), with the result approximating chisquare distribution with degrees of freedom for the test
statistic determined by the difference in estimated
parameters between the models being compared. For
both the M1a (neutral) vs. M2a (selection) and M7 (beta)
vs. M8 (beta + selection) comparisons, the null model has
two estimated parameters, while the alternative estimates
four, resulting in two degrees of freedom and chi-square
critical values of 5.99, 9.21, and 13.82 at 5%, 1%, and 0.1%
significance, respectively [34].
