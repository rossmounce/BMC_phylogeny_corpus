There are four dengue virus serotypes, based on molecular analysis. Each serotype is divided to several different genotypes, such as there are 5 genotypes in dengue
virus serotype 3 (DENV-3), in which genotype II was
confirmed to be the main etiology cause the big dengue
fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Vietnam
1998.
Molecular epidemiological study was carried out on
DENV-3, which causing dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever in some epidemic areas with high morbidity
and mortality from southern Vietnam in 2010. In this
study, viral RNA of DENV-3 were extracted directly
from dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever patient
sera, typing by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) with Lanciotti specific primers,
sequencing the entire envelope (E) gene and comparative analysis with DENV-3 strain isolated from the big
outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever in whole country
in 1998. The phylogenetic analysis of DENV-3 from
Vietnam as well as previously published strains, the
results showed that: Vietnamese DENV-3 belong to genotype II among 5 genotypes classified for worldwide
DENV-3 and have been closely related to Thailand isolates. Further researchs need to be carried out in order
to confirm the evidence for local genetic evolution and
conserved functional structure of E protein of DENV-3.
