protein

Abstract
Background: Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) is considered one of the most dangerous pathogens infecting tomatoes
worldwide. The virus is highly diverse and four distinct genotypes, as well as inter-strain recombinants, have
already been described. The isolates display a wide range on symptoms on infected plant species, ranging from
mild mosaic to severe necrosis. However, little is known about the mechanisms and pattern of PepMV molecular
evolution and about the role of individual proteins in host-pathogen interactions.
Methods: The nucleotide sequences of the triple gene block 3 (TGB3) from PepMV isolates varying in
symptomatology and geographic origin have been analyzed. The modes and patterns of molecular evolution of
the TGBp3 protein were investigated by evaluating the selective constraints to which particular amino acid residues
have been subjected during the course of diversification. The tridimensional structure of TGBp3 protein has been
modeled de novo using the Rosetta algorithm. The correlation between symptoms development and location of
specific amino acids residues was analyzed.
Results: The results have shown that TGBp3 has been evolving mainly under the action of purifying selection
operating on several amino acid sites, thus highlighting its functional role during PepMV infection. Interestingly,
amino acid 67, which has been previously shown to be a necrosis determinant, was found to be under positive
selection.
Conclusions: Identification of diverse selection events in TGB3p3 will help unraveling its biological functions and is
essential to an understanding of the evolutionary constraints exerted on the Potexvirus genome. The estimated
tridimensional structure of TGBp3 will serve as a platform for further sequence, structural and function analysis and
will stimulate new experimental advances.

Background
Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) belongs to Potexvirus genus
within the Flexiviridae family and it is a well-known
pathogen infecting tomato plants worldwide. PepMV possesses a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of
approximately 6.4 kb, flanked by 5’ and 3’ untranslated
regions (UTRs) with a 5’ cap and a 3’poly(A) tail. PepMV
contains five conserved open reading frames (ORFs).
ORF1 encodes a 164 kDa replication-related protein with

three functional domains: an N-terminal mRNA capping
enzyme, a central RNA helicase, and a C-terminal RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 through ORF4
encode movement proteins (TGBp1, TGBp2 and TGBp3)
of 26, 14, and 9 kDa, respectively. These three ORFs overlap in the genome and, hence, are called the triple gene
block. The 25 kDa CP is encoded by ORF5 [1-3]. The
virus is highly diverse; four different genotypes (CH2, LP,
EU, and LP) and a large number of inter-strain recombinants have been described [4,5]. PepMV isolates differ
both in host range as well in the symptoms induced on
susceptible plants species. Recently, it was proved that one
single mutation in TGBp3 protein converts a mild

pathotype of CH2 genotype into a necrotic one. This is the
only association reported between particular amino acid
sites and symptomatology [6]. However, our preliminary
results with isolates from the EU genotype showed that we
are dealing with a universal mechanism of variability. By
performing site-directed mutagenesis of infectious clones
of the EU genotype, we confirmed that amino acid 67 is
responsible for inducing necrosis on tomato, irrespective
of the strain (unpublished results). This finding suggests
that TGBp3 structure is important for virulence, since
substitution of certain amino acids results in changes in
the infectivity of the virus. As the tridimensional structure
of TGBp3 is not yet available, de novo modeling represents
a suitable and convenient alternative for analyzing the
relationship between amino acids present at certain positions, structure and virulence. This is the approach undertaken in this study.
A second aim of this study is to verify the nature of the
selective pressures operating on TGBp3. Nucleotides
substitutions can be classified into two categories on the
basis of their effects on the protein amino acid composition: synonymous and nonsynonymous replacements. In
general synonymous substitutions accumulate at rate dS
per synonymous site. It is generally accepted that synonymous substitutions accumulate neutrally because they
have no effect on the amino acids composition and thus
shall not affect the folding and function of proteins. In
contrast, nonsynonymous substitutions accumulate at
rate dN per synonymous site. Since these substitutions
involve amino acid replacements, they must be subjected
to selection. The average ratio of these two substitutions
rates ω = dN/dS across a gene, provides information on
whether it has been fixing amino acid replacements in a
neutral fashion (ω = 1), amino acids changes have been
removed by the action of purifying selection (ω < 1), or
changes have been fixed by positive evolution (ω > 1) [7].
However, averaging ω across the entire coding sequence
of a gene is a gross approximation since highly conserved
and hypervariable sites may coexist. It is more sensitive
to allow the ω rates ratio to vary among sites and to take
the presence of individual sites at which ω > 1 as an evidence for positive selection [7]. In this study, sequence
analysis of the PepMV TGB3 was conducted and ω rates
ratio were calculated. Additionally, a computational analysis of TGB3 sequences to investigate the extent of
recombination events was performed. Taken together, in
this study we present results of computational analyses
evaluating the patterns of molecular evolution and their
effect on protein structure and virulence.

were retrieved from GenBank and used for further analysis (Table 1). For some isolates detailed biological
information was also available. Sequences were translated into amino acids using BioEdit [8]. Multiple protein sequence alignments were obtained using MUSCLE
[9] and then protein-coding nucleotide sequence alignments were constructed based on their corresponding
protein sequence alignments using PAL2NAL[10].
It is well known that recombination affects the estimation of ω and interferes with phylogenetic reconstruction [11]. Therefore the PepMV sequences were initially
analyzed for evidence of recombination events using the
RDP package [12]. The sequences were analyzed using
the following methods: 3 Seq, Chimaera, Lard, Bootscan,
RDP, Genecovn, and MaxChi. Only recombination
breakpoints supported by more than three methods
were considered as valid. With this stringent criterion,
no significant recombination signals were identified in
the analyzed sequences. The best-fitting model of
nucleotide substitution was investigated using the
MODELTEST implemented in MEGA5; Kimura 2-parameters model (K2P) was chosen. Maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA5 and
K2P model of nucleotide substitution [13]. Reliability of
the obtained tree was evaluated using the bootstrap
method based on 1000 pseudoreplicates. Both nucleotide and amino acids sequences were scrutinized to find
particular positions distinguishing mild and severe
isolates.

Analysis of selective pressure

Our analysis of selective pressures was based on evaluating
ω for each codon in the nucleotide sequence alignment.
The single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixedeffects likelihood (FEL) and internal branches fixed-effects
likelihood (IFEL) methods were used to evaluate ω per
codon [14]. Both SLAC and FEL methods used using the
default significance level of p = 0.1; a Bayes factor of 40
was used as selection threshold for REL. These analyses
were performed using the HyPhy package [15] as implemented in the DATAMONKEY webserver [16]. Nucleotide substitutions were modeled according to the K2P
scheme. If a gene evolves under purifying selection most
of the time but is occasionally subject to episodes of positive selection, a comparison between two distant related
sequences is unlikely to yield a ω ratio significantly > 1.
To specifically test whether phylogenetic branches with
necrotic isolates underwent positive selection events, we
performed two independent analyses of branch-specific
codon models. First, the M2 branch site model allowing ω
to vary among sites in the protein and across branches on
the tree and aim to detect positive selection affecting a few
sites along particular lineages [17] was evaluated using the
program CODEML from the PAML version 4.4 package
[18]. Second, we applied the sliding-window analysis
implemented in SWAPSC [19]. SWAPSC uses a statistically optimized window size to detect selective constraints
in specific codon regions of the alignment at a particular
branch of phylogenetic tree. The method estimates the
null distribution of dS and dN from simulated sequence
alignments. A statistically optimal window size is then estimated that makes the detection of adaptive evolution
independent of the window size. Four codons was the estimated optimal window size. Simulated sequences were
generated with the program EVOLVER from the PAML
package [18] with parameters estimated from the true
sequence alignments after running M0 codon-based
model in CODEML.

server gateway [21]. Secondary structure was predicted
using PSIPRED [22], PROFSEC [23], PROF [24], SABLE
[25], and JNET [26]. FR methods did not report any
good template structure for homology modeling procedure. Hence, de novo methods for structure modeling
were applied.
De novo structural modeling of TGBp3

To obtain a tridimensional structural model of the
TGB3 protein we used TGBp3 sequences of P19, P22
and DB1 isolates. P19 and P22 represent necrotic and
mild pathotypes of the CH2 genotype, respectively. DB1
isolates were described as necrotic isolates belonging to
the EU genotype. The ROSETTA [27] algorithm was
used for de novo modeling of TGBp3. Hundreds of
thousands of decoys were generated and clustered to
identify the best low-energy conformations. Selection of
models based on the average energy clusters, size, density and visual inspection of final structures was performed. The quality of the final models was evaluated
using the neural network based algorithm implemented
in the PROQ server [28,29] and the MetaMQAPII metaserver [30]. In the first case, the quality is quantified by
the location in the plane formed by the two indexes
LGscore (i.e., the -log of a p-value) and MaxSub (ranging
0 - 1). Depending on the specific values of these
indexes, the model can be qualified as: correct if
LGscore > 1.5 and MaxSub > 0.1, as good if LGscore > 3
and MaxSub > 0.5, and as very good if LGscore > 5 and
MaxSub > 0.8). Mapping of the electrostatic potential
on protein surfaces was calculated with APBS (Adaptive
Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) [31]. This procedure was
performed to reveal potential electrostatic changes on
the surface on the protein that may influence interaction
between other proteins and elements in local cell
environment.

Results
Analysis of TGBp3

Identification of functionally important amino acid
residues

To identify potentially functional and structural amino
acids residues we used the Bayesian methods implemented in the ConSurf server [20]. Functionally important
residues, e.g. involved in ligand binding and protein-protein interactions, are often evolutionarily conserved and
are most likely to be solvent-accessible, whereas conserved residues within the protein core most probably
have an important structural role in maintaining the
protein properly folded [20].
Secondary structure prediction and mutation mapping

Secondary structure prediction and tertiary fold-recognition (FR) were performed using the GENESILICO meta-

The analysis of TGBp3 sequences reveled striking differences between particular isolates. TGBp3 consists of
246-258 nt and 82-86 amino acids, respectively, depending on the isolate considered. The protein of the Peruvian isolate LP-2001 from Lycopersicon peruvianum has
two extra amino acids in the C-terminal region (86)
than the characteristic 82-84 of other isolates. It is
unclear whether this polymorphism in TGBp3 length
has any affect on symptoms. The nucleotide identity
between the 18 sequences studied ranged from 82% to
98.7% and from 77.3% to 98.7% at the amino acid level.
The average transition/transversion rates ratio was high,
3.9, as observed for other plant RNA viruses [32].
The phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 illustrates the
presence of two major groups containing isolates from

CH2 and EU genotypes. CH1 isolate form a separate
branch. Both SLAC and REL method found no evidence
of positively selected codons, but found three negatively
selected ones: 50, 63 and 65 with ω = 0.36. By contrast,
the FEL method predicted codon 37 as to be under
positive selection, plus 15 other codons to be under purifying selection. Both CODEML and SWAPSC analyses
revealed low ω value (0.35), thus suggesting a strong
action of purifying selection in the evolution of TGB3
among the isolates studied. As mentioned above, ω < 1
is indicative of purifying selection removing deleterious
nonsynonymous mutations. The whole TGBp3 has
undergone purifying selection in the majority of
branches of the phylogenetic tree. However, branch-site
model implemented in CODEML showed positive selection acting in branches driving to necrotic isolates (Figure 1). In seven branches negative selection operated on
region encompassing nucleotides 187-198 (amino acids
63-66), that includes the highly conserved PEVL motif.
Those residues were also classified as functionally or
structurally important by the Bayesian methods implemented in ConSurf. However, amino acid 67 (nucleotides 199-201) was predicted to be under positive
selection, despite being surrounded by amino acids
under negative selection. In this position, a K was found
in the majority of PepMV isolates and only isolates DB1
(EU genotype) and P19 (CH2 genotype) contained E at
this position, a very radical change replacing a basic

residue by an acid one. Both isolates have been
described as necrotic.
Structural modeling of TGBp3

Secondary structure prediction with PSIPRED [22]
revealed the existence of three a-helices in regions 2-13,
17-36 and 62-68 and two b-strands in regions 45-50
and 53-57. Consistently, the modeled tridimensional
structure preserved these structures. Position 67, which
undergoes mutation K to E, is located in the third ahelix, without affecting the helix stability. A transmembrane domain/helix was predicted for the region encompassing amino acids 10 to 35 (Figure 2).
A three-dimensional model for the TGBp3 from the
P19 necrotic isolate was obtained using the ROSETTA
algorithm. The model was evaluated as “extremely
good” according to the LG score (5.751) and “correct”
according to the MaxSub index (0.320). The METAMQAPII method predicted that the overall GDT_TS score
(Global Distance Test Total Score - a measure of similarity between two protein structures with identical
amino acid sequences, but different tertiary structures)
of the final model with respect to the native (currently
unknown) structure is 59.45 (GDT_TS ranges between 1
and 100) and the model’s root mean square deviation to
the true structure is around 2.6. This indicates that the
model can be used to make functional inferences at the
level of individual residues. Overall, the inferred model
for the TGBp3 (82 amino acids) consists of two antiparallel b-sheets flanked by three a-helices which exactly
corresponds to those predicted by PSIPRED (Figure 3).
Based on the structure of P19 isolate TGBp3, we modeled two other proteins: one from the mild isolate P22
and one from the necrotic isolate DB1. These two additional proteins were chosen to evaluate the effect of
mutations conferring the necrotic phenotype on the
protein structure. The amino acid sequence identity of
TGBp3 between isolates P19 and DB1 was 85% and
between P19 and P22 was as high as 99%. This level of
amino acid identities allowed us to use homology-modeling methods [33] to build tridimensional models of
both proteins. We particularly analyzed mutation K to E
at residue 67. This mutation occurs rarely in PepMV
homologous sequences. It is predicted to be in the surface of the folded protein and locally changing potential
on the surface of helical region with mutation from
negative to positive (Figure 4). This small change may
influence on local interactions with environment components as well as the process of protein folding into
native shape, but this needs further investigation.

Many plant virus genera encode a triple gene block
(TGB), an especially evolutionarily conserved gene

module involved in the cell-to-cell and long-distance
movement of viruses. The TGB-based transport system
exploits the coordinated action of three polypeptides to
deliver viral genomes into plasmodesmata and to
accomplish virus entry into neighboring cells [34,35].
TGB-encoded proteins are referred to as TGBp1,
TGBp2 and TGBp3, according to the positions of their
cistrons [35]. All three proteins are essential for virus
movement. TGBp1 was widely studied and besides its
role in movement, it has been shown that generally
functions as an RNA silencing suppressor in members
of the genus Potexvirus [36]. At the same time, little is
know about additional function of TGBp2 and TGBp3.
In agreement with sequence analysis and in vitro studies

predicting that TGBp2 and TGBp3 are integral membrane proteins [37] cell fractionation of plant tissues
expressing these proteins demonstrates predominant
association of both proteins with the P1 and P30 membranous fractions as well as with the cell wall [38,39].
Understanding the molecular evolutionary biology of the
various proteins expressed by viral genomes and their
functions is a prerequisite for the control of virus propagation and the elaboration of efficient and durable antiviral strategies. In our previous study we have shown
that TGBp3 is involved in host-pathogen interactions
during PepMV infection. Experiments with PepMV
TGBp3 mutants revealed that one single mutation K67E
was required for converting a mild pathotype into a

necrotic one [6]. Mutant viruses of mild PepMV strain
induced necrosis on Datura inoxia and Solanum lycopersicum. Symptoms of viral infection strongly depended
on the inoculated host plant and result from speciesspecific host-pathogen interactions.
Secondary and tertiary TGBp3 structure predictions
showed that the protein consists of three a-helices and
two b-strands. The secondary structure prediction
placed amino acid 67 in one of the a-helices. Our tridimensional structural predictions revealed that the region
encompassing amino acid 67 in isolates P19, P22 and
DB1 is located on the surface of the protein and thus
mutations in this region, specially when the physical
properties dramatically change as it is the case of mutation K67E, must have a strong impact on the ability of
TGBp3 to interact with other protein. It is well known
that in many cases amino acids can be replaced without
impairing protein function, even if these are of quite different physico-chemical characteristics. However, the
change of a positively charged K by a negatively charged
E may change the local property of the protein surface,
jeopardizing its ability to establish the correct interactions with other viral proteins or cell components. Supporting the existence of such functionality in this
surface region, we have identified nucleotide sites 187198, spanning amino acids 63-66 that were under the
action of negative selection in seven branches of the
phylogenetic tree describing the evolutionary history of
PepMV. In particular, the PEVL motif is highly conserved in all isolates analyzed.
In general, functionally essential protein parts are
negatively selected for (conserved), while other parts
can be positively selected for. The ω mean value
obtained for the TGBp3 cistron strongly suggests a

predominant action of purifying selection. In good
agreement with this average value, three different
approaches detected strong signal of purifying selection
for particular codons. Nevertheless, most codons are
evolutionarily neutral. However, perhaps the most interesting result from the analyses of selective constraints if
that amino acid K67 has been identified as under positive selection in the branch leading to necrotic isolates,
suggesting that necrosis may be an adaptive trait. Since
it is close to the region of amino acids 63-66, which is
(i) under negative selection (and hence likely has an
important function) and (ii) predicted to be in the surface of the folded protein, we can speculate that it may
be involved in the formation of protein-protein complex
that determine the development of symptoms. The
results obtained with ConSurf indicated that amino
acids 61-66 played functional and structural roles in the
protein. A protein function is however, the results of
the functional and structural communication between
sites and, therefore, the ability of a given site to change
depends on the interactions it must establish with other
residues of the molecule. Mutations at either nearby
sites (like K67E), or functionally related distant sites in
the structure, will change the selective constraints [40].
Functional sites, like binding domains, are less prone to
amino acid changes than less important protein regions.
Furthermore, some classes of proteins evolve faster than
others [41].
The analysis of the TGB1 gene in PepMV populations
clearly provides a mechanism for its rapid evolution and
adaptation to the ever-changing environments [42]. In
the light of what is so far known about PepMV evolutionary dynamics [43] it seems that TGBp3 evolves
mostly by the action of purifying selection operating

Hasiów-Jaroszewska et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:318
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/318

over several sites, highlighting its functional role during
PepMV infection. Gómez et al. [43] showed only one
amino acid under purifying selection in the TGBp3 of
CH2 genotype also using the methods implemented in
the DATAMONKEY server. We have analyzed TGBp3
sequences representing different genotypes and we used
more sophisticated methods to establish selection pressure acting on TGBp3. We were able to identify more
codons under action of purifying selection, moreover
amino acid 67 was predicted to be under positive selection. It seems that the particular pathotypes achieved an
advantage over others especially in Europe. Recently,
more aggressive pathotypes (causing necrosis or severe
yellowing) of CH2 genotype have become dominant in
Poland. This shift in the Polish PepMV population
reveals a dynamic interplay between the different
PepMV genotypes and their host. Necrotic isolates,
however, were described in both the EU and CH2 genotypes, and it seems that the selective pressures act in the
direction of increasing the virulence of isolates, less temperature dependent which cause significant losses in
quality and quantity of yield. Preliminary data (HasiówJaroszewska, unpublished results) have shown that
necrotic isolates acquired the ability to infect a larger
number of Solanum tuberosum varieties and of causing
more severe symptoms in shorter time. Probably, the
key feature of these isolates are faster replication or
accumulation. It seems that molecular evolution is leading to higher variability among CH2 genotype in comparison to others genotypes. It has been suggested that
the CH2 genotype has a biological advantage over the
EU genotype, as it seems to spread more rapidly within
a crop [5]. Recent study on the evolutionary dynamics
of the PepMV population in Spain using RT-quantitative
PCR analyses in inoculated tomato plants showed that a
CH2 isolate (PS5) accumulated more rapidly and to
higher viral loads than an EU isolate (Sp13) [43]. The
TGBp3 is responsible for virus movement and further
research will be performed to shed the light between
particular mutation in TGBp3 and virus fitness.
The present in silico study opens new research avenues for researches interested in experimentally exploring the in vivo interactions between TGBp3 and host
factors. Moreover, we report the first tridimensional
structure of TGBp3, obtained with de novo folding
methods followed by careful accuracy assessments. This
model may serve as a platform for further sequence,
structural and function analysis and will stimulate new
experiment advances.

Conclusions
The obtained results suggested that TGBp3 has been
evolving mainly under the action of purifying selection
operating on several amino acid sites however amino

acid 67, which has been previously shown to be a necrosis determinant, was found to be under positive selection. The estimated tridimensional structure of TGBp3
will serve as a platform for further sequence, structural
and function analysis and will stimulate new experimental advances.
