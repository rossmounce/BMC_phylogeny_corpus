Abstract
Background: Failure of sperm differentiation is one of the major causes of male sterility. During
spermiogenesis, spermatids undergo a complex metamorphosis, including chromatin condensation
and cell elongation. Although the resulting sperm morphology and property can vary depending on
the species, these processes are fundamental in many organisms. Studying genes involved in such
processes can thus provide important information for a better understanding of spermatogenesis,
which might be universally applied to many other organisms.
Results: In a screen for genes that have gonad-specific expression we isolated an elav-like gene,
melav2, from Macrostomum lignano, containing the three RNA recognition motifs characteristic of
elav-like genes. We found that melav2 mRNA was expressed exclusively in the testis, as opposed
to the known elav genes, which are expressed in the nervous system. The RNAi phenotype of
melav2 was characterized by an aberrant spermatid morphology, where sperm elongation often
failed, and an empty seminal vesicle. Melav2 RNAi treated worms were thus male-sterile. Further
analysis revealed that in melav2 RNAi treated worms precocious chromatin condensation occurred
during spermatid differentiation, resulting in an abnormally tightly condensed chromatin and large
vacuoles in round spermatids. In addition, immunostaining using an early-spermatid specific
antibody revealed that melav2 RNAi treated worms had a larger amount of signal positive cells,
suggesting that many cells failed the transition from early spermatid stage.
Conclusion: We characterize a new function for elav-like genes, showing that melav2 plays a
crucial role during spermatid differentiation, especially in the regulation of chromatin condensation
and/or cell elongation.

Background
Failure of spermatogenesis is one of the major causes of
male sterility. Many cases of human infertility are associated with low sperm production (oligozoospermia), poor

sperm motility (asthenozoospermia) and abnormal
sperm morphology (teratozoospermia) [1]. Also, it has
been shown that abnormalities of sperm chromatin,
which is important for properly transmitting genetic

information to offspring, can often be observed in cases of
infertility [2]. Although spermatid cells undergo a complex metamorphosis in a species-specific manner, resulting in various types of sperm morphology and other traits
depending on species, fundamental processes such as the
reorganization of the nucleus, cell organelles, and cell
shape are found in most organisms [3]. Thus studying
genes involved in such processes can provide important
information for a better understanding of spermatogenesis, which may also be applied to many other organisms.
Macrostomum lignano (Macrostomorpha, Rhabditophora,
Platyhelminthes) is a simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm, namely with male and female gonads within one
individual, and a suitable model organism for gametogenesis research. An EST database is available as a source for
gene information http://flatworm.uibk.ac.at/macest/[4].
In addition, basic experimental techniques for gene analysis such as in situ hybridization and gene specific RNA
interference (RNAi) are already established [5,6]. Monoclonal antibodies against various types of cells are also
available for detailed analysis of tissues [7]. The biggest
advantage of M. lignano for spermatogenesis research is its
transparency, which allows non-invasive observation of
cells and tissues in live animals using light microscopy
and thus allows very efficient screening of RNAi phenotypes. Finally, their frequent copulation and short generation time make it easy to examine mating behavior and
the degree of reproductive contribution to the next generation [8]. Also a lot of research has been done in terms of
evolutionary biology, such as sex allocation adjustment,
sexual conflict, and sperm competition [9-12]. Thus studying M. lignano allows the comprehensive understanding
of spermatogenesis, not only at the developmental level
but also its significance in evolutionary aspects.
In M. lignano, the testes mainly consist of male germ cells
such as spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids, and
sperm. A thin layer of tunica cells encloses the testes. After
meiosis, spermatids remain in four-cell clusters with cytoplasmic connections until just before the completion of
sperm maturation [13]. Mature sperm have a complex
morphology, with distinct parts easily observed in the
microscope. From anterior to posterior, sperm have a
feeler, a body which ends in a pair of bristles, and a shaft
which ends in a brush [14]. Within the shaft the nucleus
is condensed into connected packages of compact chromatin. The overall appearance of the sperm nucleus can
be compared to connected railway carriages [13]. This
morphology will be referred to as "train-shape" in this
manuscript. Sperm differentiation starts with the development of the anterior part which is followed by the elongation of spermatids and then the nucleus becomes
enclosed in the shaft of the mature sperm. Here we reserve
the term 'sperm' for cells that have completed sperma-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/62

togenesis and call the aberrant cells of the RNAi phenotype 'aberrant spermatids'.
In the process of spermiogenesis, post-transcriptional
control of mRNA is very important [15,16]. In an elongating spermatid, the nucleus has to be condensed into a
compact shape, which causes cessation of transcription.
Therefore, transcription of genes that are necessary for
later stages has to be completed before chromatin condensation, but their translation needs to be controlled until
they are needed. For this post-transcriptional control,
such as transport, translational repression and storage of
mRNAs, the involvement of various types of RNA binding
proteins has been reported [15-19]. For example, during
spermiogenesis DNA-binding histones are gradually
replaced by transition proteins (Tnp1 and Tnp2) and then
protamines (Prm1 and Prm2), and it is suggested that protamine-1 mRNA binding protein (PRBP) has a role for
proper translational activation of prm-1 mRNA [17].
Elav genes are RNA binding proteins that are characterized
by three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a hinge
region between the second and the third RRM [20,21].
RRMs are the most common protein domains found in all
kingdoms and each RRM consists of 80-90 amino acids
containing two conserved sequences called RNP-1 and
RNP-2 [22-25]. Structurally, a RRM has two α helices and
four anti-parallel β strands, forming two β-α-β structures.
It is suggested that proteins containing one or several
RRMs are capable of interacting with RNA molecules [2325]. Molecular functions of the elav gene family are quite
diverse, including mRNA stability, splicing, translatability
and transport [20,26].
In this paper, we study a Macrostomum elav-like gene,
melav2 (Macrostomum elav-like gene 2), using differential
interference contrast microscopy, in situ hybridization,
monoclonal antibodies, histology, and electron microscopy. We found that melav2 is expressed exclusively in the
testes. Moreover, we show that melav2 RNA interference
causes aberrant spermatid morphology, abnormal chromatin condensation, and an empty seminal vesicle leading to male-sterility. We thus prove that melav2 plays a
crucial role for proper sperm differentiation and male fertility in M. lignano.

Results
Melav2 is an elav-like gene encoding three RNA
recognition motifs
Melav2 was identified and isolated during the process of
screening for gonad-specific genes in M. lignano. We
found this gene in our EST database with the keyword 'sexlethal (sxl)'. Sxl is a well-known gene involved in sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster, although its function
is not conserved among all insects [27-31]. However, we

found that, as described in detail below, melav2 had a
higher similarity with elav genes than with sxl. We therefore named it melav2 (Macrostomum elav-like gene 2) to
distinguish it from melav1, another elav-like gene present
in our EST database. Given the scope of our paper we
focused on melav2. The entire open reading frame of this
gene was obtained from the EST clone ANGU919. This
gene was predicted to encode 422 amino acids.
Using BLASTX analysis, we found that melav2 has a high
similarity with the Elav/Hu gene family, which is characterized by three RRMs with a hinge region between the
second and the third RRM. Multiple alignments with
other elav-like genes (Figure 1A) revealed that the first and
second RRM of melav2 are relatively conserved whereas
the third RRM does not show such a high homology.
The structure of the RRM is important for the interaction
with RNA. We therefore examined the structural similarity
of melav2 and other elav genes. An RRM contains two α
helices and four anti-parallel β strands, forming two β-αβ structures [22-25]. Structural analysis using the SWISSMODEL program revealed that melav2 has two such β-α-β
structures in each RRM region and that they correspond to
the β-α-β region of other elav genes (Figure 1A). In the
third RRM of melav2, however, the β-α-β pattern was less
distinct. We further analyzed melav2 using the SMART
program for identification and annotation of protein
domains (Figure 1B). According to this program, melav2
was considered to have three RRMs, corroborating the
similar overall gene structure to other elav genes. The evalue of the first and second RRM was 4.89e-18 and 2.16e10, respectively, and the e-value of the third RRM was
4.61e-05. All these e-values were for the RRM in the
SMART database (SMART accession number SM00360).
BLASTX analysis also showed a certain similarity between
melav2 and another elav related gene, sxl (data not
shown). Structurally, sxl has two RRMs. The third RRM of
melav2 was not well conserved compared to other elav-like
genes, but despite the similarity with sxl, the phylogenetic
analysis revealed that melav2 seemed to belong to the elavlike gene family (Figure 1C).
Melav2 is expressed exclusively in the testes
In order to investigate the expression pattern of the melav2
mRNA, we performed whole mount in situ hybridizations
(Figure 2). 1-day old hatchlings possess a gonad anlage of
4-6 primordial germ cells [6]. However, expression of
melav2 was not yet detected at this stage (Figure 2A).
Melav2 expression was also lacking in 4-days old worms
(Figure 2B), which already have spermatogonia and spermatocytes but not yet spermatids. In subadult worms,
which start to have maturing sperm, several cells in the
testis were melav2 positive (Figure 2C). In fully mature

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/62

worms, which have an increasing number of maturating
sperm and also developing eggs, melav2 expression
became strong in the testes (Figure 2D). Cells on the edge
of testis had no or only weak melav2 expression, while the
signal around the center of the testis was stronger (Figure
2E), suggesting that the expression level increased as spermatogenesis progressed. Semi-thin sectioning after whole
mount in situ hybridization revealed that spermatogonia
and probably spermatocytes I did not express melav2 (Figure 2F). Furthermore, it seems that a weak signal was
present in spermatocytes II and a strong signal was
observed in spermatids (Figure 2F). Mature sperm did not
seem to express melav2, considering that no expression
was detected in fully mature sperm within the seminal
vesicle (Figure 2D). These results suggest that melav2 starts
to be expressed at the late stage of spermatogenesis, but
not anymore after spermatogenesis was completed.
Melav2 RNAi causes an aberrant spermatid morphology
By performing RNAi gene knock-down experiments, we
found that melav2 is essential for spermatogenesis in M.
lignano. Apart from the differentiating spermatids, we did
not find remarkable morphological defects in other tissues such as spermatogonia and spermatocytes (Additional file 1), neuropile and nerve cords (Additional file
2), epidermis, muscles and gland cells (Additional file 3),
and various stages of oocyte development (Additional file
4) of melav2 RNAi treated worms. These observations are
consistent with the testis-specific melav2 gene expression
pattern (Figure 3). The animals had ovaries and developing eggs (Figure 3A, B), and the other reproductive organs
such as the female genital opening, the antrum (Figure
3C, D), and the male copulatory stylet (Figure 3E, F)
exhibited a normal phenotype. However, melav2 RNAi
treated worms did not have any received sperm in their
female antrum (Figure 3D) and had no sperm in the seminal vesicle (Figure 3F). In controls, on the contrary, both
organs were full of sperm (Figure 3C, E). In a few exceptional cases (4 out of 48), we observed one or two aberrant spermatids in the seminal vesicle in the melav2 RNAi
treated worms (Figure 3G), suggesting that the formation
of the vas deferens was not affected by RNAi. We therefore
conclude that the empty seminal vesicle resulted, not
from a lack of a vas deferens, but from a failure of sperm
maturation, as described later. Elav genes are known to
function in the nervous system in other organisms, but
the neuropile structure and the nerve cords of melav2
RNAi treated worms appeared unaffected (Additional file
2). Furthermore, behaviors, such as swimming or feeding,
also appeared to be normal in melav2 RNAi treated
worms.

The testes of melav2 RNAi treated worms showed severe
defects (Figure 4). The testis of control worms contained
many maturating sperm, which were elongated and well

organized in the central region of the testis (Figure 4A). In
live control animals the sperm were moving vigorously
inside the testis. In the melav2 RNAi treated worms, however, the content of the testis looked strongly disorganized
(Figure 4B), and internal movements occurred rarely. Furthermore, testis components of control animals contained
normal differentiating sperm (Figure 4C), while in the
melav2 RNAi treated worms an accumulation of aberrant
cells was present (Figure 4D). Note that not many mature
sperm can be seen in control worms because they are
transferred to the seminal vesicle as they complete spermatogenesis.
We next analyzed the morphology of single cells in detail
(Figure 5). In control worms, spermatid cells were often
seen as clusters of four cells until they finished spermiogenesis (Figure 5A-C). Spermiogenesis begins with the
development of the feeler, then the body (Figure 5A, B)
and the bristles, followed by the formation of the shaft
(Figure 5C). After the the split of the tetrad the brush is
formed (Figure 5D). In melav2 RNAi treated worms, however, most of cells were not in four-cell clusters, even
before elongation was completed (Figure 5E). In addition,
many spermatids showed an aberrant morphology (Figure 5F-I). In some cases, for example, round immature
cells had feelers with the wavy morphology characteristic
of developed sperm (Figure 5F), while the feeler of normal
spermatids in controls remained straight at that stage of
development (Figure 5A, B). In other cases, spermatids of
melav2 RNAi treated animals had a feeler and a pair of
bristles but failed to elongate the shaft (Figure 5G-I). This
aberrant morphology was never observed in controls. Taking all these features together, the morphological defects
induced by melav2 RNAi occurred mainly in the posterior
parts, which are formed in the later stages of spermiogenesis.
Melav2 is necessary for spermiogenesis
In order to determine exactly which stage of spermatogenesis was disturbed by melav2 RNAi, we compared semithin sections of control and melav2 RNAi treated worms.
We found that spermatogenesis started to fail at the spermatid stage in the melav2 RNAi treated worms (Figure 6).
In the testes of control worms (Figure 6A), spermatogonia
and spermatocytes were observed at the peripheral
regions, whereas elongating spermatids and sperm were
located at the center. In the melav2 RNAi treated worms
(Figure 6B), spermatogonia and spermatocytes seemed
likely to be normal (Additional file 1). However, from the
spermatid stage onwards, cells started to become aberrant.
The center of the testis was full of these aberrant cells with
large vacuoles (Figure 6B).

Transmission electron microscopy revealed a failure of
nucleus reorganization between the middle and the late

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/62

stages of spermatid development (Figure 7). First, spermatogonia and spermatocytes I and II looked normal in both
control and melav2 RNAi treated worms (Additional file
1). In control worms (Figure 7A), chromatin started to
condense gradually during spermatid elongation and
became reorganized into the train-shaped morphology in
later stages (Figure 7C). In the melav2 RNAi treated
worms, the early stage of spermatid development
appeared to be normal, except for a precocious condensation of the chromatin (Figure 7B). Around the middle
stages of spermatid development, we often observed
already tightly condensed patches of chromatin (Figure
7D), which was never found in the control worms. In
addition, these cells often had large vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Figure 7D and also Figure 6B). In some cases, cell
components such as mitochondria and other organelles
were observed outside of cell (Figure 7D), suggesting that
cells were dying by necrosis. Cells with train-shaped
nuclei were never observed in the melav2 RNAi treated
worms.
Melav2 RNAi interrupts the transition from spermatid to
sperm
Immunocytochemical staining with the monoclonal
MSp-1 antibody, which recognizes only early spermatids
in M. lignano [7], revealed that many cells did not complete the transition from early spermatid stage properly in
melav2 RNAi treated worms (Figure 8). In control worms
the signal was always detected in clusters of four cells and
the number of MSp-1-positive cells did not exceed a few
dozens (Figure 8A, B). In the melav2 RNAi treated worms,
however, a considerably larger amount of MSp-1-positive
cells was observed (Figure 8C, D), suggesting an accumulation of these cells in the testis. In some cases, the signal
looked normal and cells were present in a cluster of four
cells, but most of the MSp-1 signal looked disorganized
(Figure 8D'). These results suggest that the spermatid differentiation until early spermatid stage was normal but
the transition to a later spermatid stage was not completed
properly. Therefore many later spermatids remained to
hold a certain level of Msp-1 protein in an aberrant
appearance, probably because they were partially arrested,
differentiating and/or dying.

Discussion
Melav2 encodes for an elav-like gene
Our results clearly show a new biological function of an
elav-like gene, namely the involvement of melav2 in spermatid differentiation in M. lignano. Elav family genes have
been mainly described to be involved in neural processes,
such as the transition between proliferation and differentiation, maturation, maintenance of neurons, and learning [20,26,32-34] ([35]. Recently, however, also other
biological functions have been reported. For example,
RBP9, a Drosophila paralog of elav, is expressed during

Comparison
Comparison of the overall morphology of control and melav2 RNAi treated M. lignano. (A, B) The overall of morphology of control animals (A) was comparable with that of melav2 RNAi treated animals (B) except for the morphology of the
testis (te). Eyes (e), gut (g), ovaries (ov), developing eggs (de), and copulatory stylet (st) were not affected by the melav2 RNAi
treatment. (C, D) The female antrum (fa) was filled with received sperm in the control animals (C), while no sperm was
present in the melav2 RNAi treated animals (D). (E, F) In the control animals (E), the false seminal vesicle (fsv) and the seminal
vesicle (sv) were filled with sperm, while no sperm was usually found there in the melav2 RNAi treated animals (F). The copulatory stylet (st), prostate glands (pg), rhabdites (r), gut (g) and adhesive organs (ao) were not affected by the melav2 RNAi
treatment. Note that only a few adhesive organs are in the focal plane in this picture. (G) In a few cases, the melav2 RNAi
treated animals had some aberrant spermatids in the seminal vesicle (G), suggesting that the vas deference was connected to
the testis normally. Scale bars: A, B, 100 μm; C-F, 50 μm; G, 10 μm.

oogenesis and is required for female fertility [36]. EXC-7,
a C. elegans ELAV homologue, is involved in the developent of excretory canals [37]. And some elav family members are expressed in other tissues or ubiquitously [38],
suggesting non-neuronal functions. In our study, we did
not find remarkable effects of melav2 RNAi on the nervous
system, although we cannot exclude the possibility of
melav2 functions in neural cells in pre-hatching stages.
However, we found another elav-like gene in M. lignano,
melav1 (Figure 1). As previously outlined, the focus of the
current study was on the testis-specific expression of

melav2, and we therefore did not explore the function of
melav1. We speculate that it may have a role in nervous
system similar to other organism's elav-like genes (particularly given that it appears to more closely resemble these
genes, Figure 1C).
Elav genes are characterized by three RRMs with a hinge
region between the second and the third RRM. RRM is a
quite common protein domain in eukaryotes [22,23,25].
For example, a recent analysis of ESTs in the planarian
Schmidtea mediterranea revealed that RRM was the second

most common domain [39]. It is considered that slight
changes in RRM can lead to different interactions with
other proteins, leading to various types of functions [23].
In fact, recent findings revealed diverse molecular functions for members of the elav gene family. For example,
elav has been shown to regulate alternative splicing of neuroglian, erect wing and armadillo transcripts in Drosophila
[40-42]. The human elav gene Hel-N1 (HuB) has been
suggested to stabilize GLUT1 mRNA and to increase its
translational efficiency [43]. In melav2, the similarity of
the third RRM was not well conserved compared to the
first and the second RRM. Recently, it has been indicated
that the Elav protein can form multimeric complexes
[44,45], and in vitro experiments suggested that the third
RRM has a role for the multimerization, although this is
not its only function [46]. It might be possible that the difference in the third RRM of melav2 contributes to a new

interaction with the target mRNAs involved in spermatogenesis.
Melav2 is necessary for spermatid differentiation
The melav2 RNAi phenotype showed severe defects in
spermatids and an abnormally condensed chromatin. We
do not consider these features as signs of an apoptotic
process, but instead we found several indications for
necrosis. First, cell components such as mitochondria
were observed outside of cells (Figure 7D), suggesting that
cells were dying in a necrotic way. Second, we observed
neither nuclear fragmentation nor an apoptotic body,
which are typical characteristics of apoptosis also in M. lignano [47]. Third, cells often showed cytoplasmic vacuolization (Figure 7D), which is unusual for apoptosis.
Fourth, we observed an accumulation of cells that failed
to proceed properly into the later spermatid stages (Figure

8B), suggesting that the elimination of such failed cells by
programmed cell death did not occur.
We propose two possible explanations for the abnormal
chromatin condensation and the failure of spermatid
elongation. One possibility is that melav2 regulates the
genes that mediate chromatin condensation, and chromatin condensation occurred too early as a result of melav2
RNAi, leading to cessation of further sperm maturation,
possibly due to an early stop in the transcription of essential genes. A similar phenotype was shown in spermiogenesis of transgenic mice where pre-mature translation of
prm-1 occurred [48]. Prm-1 should be repressed until a
later spermatid stage for a proper transition from nucleo-

histones to nucleo-protamines. Premature translation of
prm-1 caused early chromatin condensation in round
spermatids, a subsequent arrest in spermiogenesis and an
aberrant spermatid morphology. These features correspond well with the melav2 RNAi phenotype shown here
(Figure 7, 8 and 5, respectively) and therefore it appears
possible that melav2 has a function in regulating prm-1 or
other comparable genes.
Another possible explanation is that cells retained their
round shape because of the disruption of spermatid elongation. It has been reported that a human neuronal Elav
protein, Hel-N1 (HuB) gene, upregulates the translation
of neurofilament M (NF-M) mRNA by using human

in cessation of elongation, as is often seen in the posterior
part at later spermatid stage (Figure 5F-I) and the failed
chromatin reorganization, in which the chromatin was
condensed but never built in a train shape (Figure 7D).
Although melav2 has three RRMs, we have no direct evidence whether melav2 really functions as RNA-binding
protein and, if so, what kinds of mRNA are targeted. Thus,
identifying the target genes of melav2 and their interaction
might be important follow-up experiments. Recently, a
transcriptome and a genome sequencing project have
been initiated in M. lignano. Therefore it will soon be possible to identify melav2 downstream genes by microarrays
or in silico comparison of transcriptomes of control animals with melav2 RNAi treated worms.

RNAi treated M. lignano
Comparison
Comparison of the spermatogenesis of control and
melav2 RNAi treated M. lignano. In the control animals
(A), spermatogonia (sg) and spermatocytes (sc) were
observed in the peripheral region of the testis, and elongating
spermatids (st) and sperm (sp) were present in the center. In
the melav2 RNAi treated animals (B), spermatogonia (sg) and
spermatocytes (sc) were also observed to be of normal morphology, but the center region of the testis was filled with
aberrant spermatids (ast) with large vacuoles. Dotted lines
roughly indicate the regions that contain the respective cell
types. g, gut; ep, epidermis; bwm, body wall musculature.

embryonic teratocarcinoma cells (hNT2) transfected with
Hel-N1 [49]. Overexpressed Hel-N1 did not affect the
level of NF-M mRNA expression but instead recruited it
into heavy polysomes more efficiently, resulting in the
formation of neurites. If a similar molecular function is
performed by melav2, it is possible that melav2 is involved
in promoting translation of some cytoskeletal elements
such as sperm-specific intermediate filaments. The shortage of these elements caused by melav2 RNAi could result

Melav2 RNAi treated worms are male-sterile
The seminal vesicles of melav2 RNAi treated worms were
empty, and in consequence they cannot transfer sperm to
a mating partner, suggesting they are male-sterile. However, M. lignano is hermaphroditic and the female reproductive function of melav2 RNAi treated worms was
normal (Figure 3). So a melav2 RNAi treated animal (or a
loss of function mutant) would still be able to contribute
offspring to next generation as a female after copulation
with normal worms. Thus, future experiments aimed at
following their reproductive success of such 'females' and
determining if such functional females could spread
within a hermaphroditic population, would provide a
better understanding of the evolution of different reproductive modes. In addition, the formation of the stylet
and the male accessory glands in melav2 RNAi treated
worms was normal (Figure 3), which offers interesting
possibilities for studies on sexual conflicts. Recent experiments have suggested that male accessory glands and their
secretions have important roles for increasing male reproductive success by manipulating the female reproductive
physiology and behavior, such as increasing egg production, decreasing female's motivation toward further copulations with other partners, and decreasing female's
longevity [50-52]. Although we still need to analyze if
melav2 RNAi treated worms can in fact transfer ejaculates
without sperm, such worms have a great potential to study
the effects of seminal fluids in hermaphroditic organisms,
by removing the effect of the transferred sperm itself.

Conclusion
We found that melav2 has a similarity with the elav gene
family at the protein sequence level. Elav genes are mainly
known to be involved in the nervous system in other
organisms, but our study clearly shows that melav2 plays
a crucial role during spermatid differentiation in M. lignano. Melav2 RNAi disturbed the proper regulation of
chromatin condensation and/or the cell elongation,

Comparison
Comparison of spermatid differentiation of control and melav2 RNAi treated M. lignano by TEM. (A, B) In the
control animals (A), the nucleus of a spermatid was never tightly condensed until quite a late stage of spermiogenesis, while in
the melav2 RNAi treated animals (B), some spermatids started to show a condensed nucleus precociously (B, arrow). (C, D) In
the control animals (C), mature sperm had an elongated morphology and the nucleus was condensed into the train-shape,
while in the melav2 RNAi treated animals (D), the train-shaped nuclei were never observed, and the cells often had large vacuoles (vac). Some cell components were also observed outside of the cells (D, asterisk), suggesting cells were dying by necrosis.

resulting in aberrant spermatid morphology and male sterility.

Methods
Animal culture
The free-living flatworm M. lignano [14] was cultured in
glass Petri dishes with nutrient-enriched artificial seawater
(Guillard's f/2 medium [53]) and fed with the diatom
Nitzschia curvilineata. The worms were kept in a climate
chamber with 60% humidity at 20°C in a 14:10 h daynight cycle [54]. Animal experimentation was carried out
in accordance to Austrian legal and ethical standards.

Gene isolation and analyses
The full length open reading frame of the clone ANGU919
http://flatworm.uibk.ac.at/macest/ was sequenced by
GATC (Konstanz, Germany) using M13 standard primers.
Sequences were analyzed by BLASTX searches at the
EMBL-EBI database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/blast2/.
Conserved protein domains were identified using the
SMART databases http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/[55].
Protein structural analysis was performed using the
SWISS-MODEL program http://swissmodel.expasy.org/
[56,57].

contig ec1.03596.005, and the Hydra sequence was generated by assembling three clones, tai96e09.y2
[CX056199], tai87h08.y1 [CV182751] and tai87h08.x1
[CV182482]. Melav1, another elav-like gene from M. lignano was obtained from EST clone Ml_aw_006_D03 in a
same way as the melav2 gene.
Sex lethal sequences were from Drosophila melanogaster
Protein sex-lethal [UniProtKB:P19339], Drosophila subobscura Protein sex-lethal [UniProtKB:Q24668], Musca

Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
Amino acid alignments were performed using the Multiple Sequence Alignment Program CLUSTALW of the
EMBL-EBI
database
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/
clustalw2/ with default alignment parameters. The phylogenetic tree was calculated using the MrBayes 3.2.2
[58,59]. Each run was performed using default parameters
and comprised 5,000,000 generations.

Whole mount in situ hybridization
The sequence region for the in situ RNA probe was amplified with the melav2 specific primers 5'-GGC CTT CTC
AGA TGA CGA GT-3' and 5'-GGA CAG ATG TTG ATG
GAC CTG-3'. The PCR condition was 2 min at 94°C, 35
cycles (30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec 55°C, 90 sec at 72°C), 7
min at 72°C. Obtained PCR products were sub-cloned
into pGEM®-T (Promega). Then PCR with M13 standard
primers was performed to generate the template for RNA
probe synthesis, including SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase
promoter sequences. Digoxygenin-labeled RNA probe
was generated using DIG RNA Labeling KIT SP6/T7
(Roche), following the manufactor's protocol. Whole
mount in situ hybridization for M. lignano was performed
as previously described [6]. The signal was developed at
37°C using the NBT/BCIP system (Roche). Specimens
were examined with a Leica DM5000 microscope. Image
acquisition and analysis were performed using a Leica
DFC490 digital camera, the Leica Application Suite 2.8.1
software, and the Adobe® Photoshop® 7.0 software.

Elav sequences were from Mus musculus ELAV-like
protein1 [UniProtKB:P70372], Xenopus laevis ELAV-like2
[GenBank:NP_001081035], Danio rerio ELAV-like 1 [GenBank:NP_571527], Drosophila melanogaster Protein elav

mediterranea and Hydra magnipapillata were generated by
computational work using available EST database,

RNA interference
By adding T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to the
primers that were used to generate the templates for in situ
RNA probe, two different templates for dsRNA probe were
generated: one had a T7 promoter at the 5' end for producing sense RNA, and the other had it at the 3' end for producing anti-sense RNA, respectively. The PCR condition
was 2 min at 94°C, 35 cycles (30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec 55°C,
90 sec at 72°C), 7 min at 72°C. The in vitro synthesis of

dsRNA was performed using T7 RiboMax TM Express
RNAi System (Promega). As a negative control, firefly luciferase dsRNA was produced from the pGEM®-luc Vector
(Promega). RNAi treatment for M. lignano was performed
by soaking as previously described [6]. We used 31 animals for control and 55 animals for melav2 RNAi treatment. One-day old hatchlings were maintained in 24-well
plates (20 worms per well) and incubated with 250 μl
dsRNA solution (3.0 ng/μl) in f/2 medium containing the
antibiotics Kanamycin and Ampicillin (50 μg/ml, respectively) and diatoms. dsRNA solution was changed twice a
day. After 3-4 weeks of RNAi treatment, the specimens
were examined with a Leica DM5000 microscope using
DIC optics. Image acquisition and analysis were performed using the same imaging set-up as described in the
"Whole mount in situ hybridization" section. For the
observation of testis components and sperm morphology,
live worms were squeezed under a cover slip until the testis ruptured and the contents of the testis were directly
observed.
Histology
Control and melav2 RNAi treated animals were relaxed in
7.14% MgCl2 and fixed for 1 hour at 4°C in 2.5% glutardaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
9% sucrose. After several washes with buffer, specimens
were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.05 M
cacodylate puffer (pH 7.4) for 1 hour. After washing in
buffer and subsequent dehydration in an ethanol series,
animals were embedded in SPURR"s low viscosity resin
[60]. Complete series of 1.5 μm thick semi-thin sections
were cut with a prototype of a Butler diamond knife (Diatome) and mounted on glass slides. After drying the sections were stained for 2 minutes in a methylen blue Azur
II mixture after Richardson [61] and mounted in cedar
wood oil. One control animal and one melav2 RNAi
treated animal were examined with a Leica 5000B microscope. Image acquisition and analysis were performed
using the same imaging set-up as described in the "Whole
mount in situ hybridization" section.
Histology after whole mount in situ hybridization
After performing melav2 whole mount in situ hybridizations as described above, specimens were fixed with
BOUIN's fluid overnight. After subsequent dehydration in
an ethanol series, animals were embedded in SPURR's low
viscosity resin. Complete series of 2 μm thick semi-thin
sections were cut with the same sectioning set-up as
described in the "Histology" section. Two animals were
examined with a Leica 5000B microscope. Image acquisition and analysis were performed using the same imaging
set-up as described in the "Whole mount in situ hybridization" section.

Transmission electron microscopy
Control and melav2 RNAi treated animals were fixed and
embedded as described above. Semi-thin and ultra-thin
sections were cut with a diamond knife on an Ultracut S
(Leica) ultramicrotome, double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. One control animal and one melav2
RNAi treated animal were examined with a ZEISS Libra
120 energy filter electron microscope. Image acquisition
and analysis were performed using a 2 k Vario Speed
SSCCD camera (Droendle) and the iTEM software (TEM
imaging platform, Olympus).
Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry for M. lignano was performed as
previously described [6,7]. As the primary antibody, the
spermatid-specific mouse monoclonal MSp-1 antibody
[7] was used (1:200). As the secondary antibody, a FITCconjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (1:250, DAKO) was
used. Two control animals and three melav2 RNAi treated
animals were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal
laser scanning microscope system. Image acquisition and
analysis were performed using the LSM510 ver.3.2 software, the LSM image browser ver.4.2.0.121 software and
the Adobe® Photoshop® 7.0 software.
