Abstract
Background: As bacteria, motile archaeal species swim by means of rotating flagellum structures
driven by a proton gradient force. Interestingly, experimental data have shown that the archaeal
flagellum is non-homologous to the bacterial flagellum either in terms of overall structure,
components and assembly. The growing number of complete archaeal genomes now permits to
investigate the evolution of this unique motility system.
Results: We report here an exhaustive phylogenomic analysis of the components of the archaeal
flagellum. In all complete archaeal genomes, the genes coding for flagellum components are colocalized in one or two well-conserved genomic clusters showing two different types of
organizations. Despite their small size, these genes harbor a good phylogenetic signal that allows
reconstruction of their evolutionary histories. These support a history of mainly vertical
inheritance for the components of this unique motility system, and an interesting possible ancient
horizontal gene transfer event (HGT) of a whole flagellum-coding gene cluster between
Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota.
Conclusion: Our study is one of the few exhaustive phylogenomics analyses of a noninformational cell machinery from the third domain of life. We propose an evolutionary scenario
for the evolution of the components of the archaeal flagellum. Moreover, we show that the
components of the archaeal flagellar system have not been frequently transferred among archaeal
species, indicating that gene fixation following HGT can also be rare for genes encoding
components of large macromolecular complexes with a structural role.

Background
Motile archaeal species swim by means of rotating flagellum structures driven by a proton gradient force [1,2], as
in bacteria [3]. Interestingly, although they are both
responsible for swimming, archaeal and bacterial flagella
are not homologous, either in terms of overall structure,

components and assembly (for a recent review see [4,5]).
The bacterial flagellum is a complex rotary structure made
up of as much as 20 proteins and composed of three
major parts -the basal body, the hook, and the filament.
Rotation is provided by an ATPase exploiting a proton gradient force, and can be switched by specific proteins in

response to attractants or repellents in the environment
through the chemotaxis system. The filament is a hollow
structure about 20 nm in diameter and is composed of a
single type of protein called flagellin. Bacterial flagellins
are assembled by a complex type III secretion system
located in the basal body and are added to the distal tip of
the flagellum after passing through the hollow cavity [4].
Much less is known about the archaeal flagellum. It has
been extensively studied in terms of components, assembly, and mutation experiments, in Halobacteria and
Methanococcales (for recent reviews [4-6]). The archaeal
flagellum is a structure thinner than its bacterial counterpart, where at least a filament and a hook are evident [79]. The archaeal flagellum has been shown to have a
unique symmetry in Halobacterium salinarium. In fact, it
has 3.3 subunits/turn of a 1.9 nm pitch left-handed helix
compared to 5.5 subunits/turn of a 2.6 nm pitch righthanded helix for plain bacterial flagellum filaments
[10,11]. The archaeal filament can be made up of different
types of homologous flagellin proteins (called FlaA or
FlaB). The filament is ~10 nm in diameter and is not hollow, resembling more to bacterial type IV pili in this
respect [10]. A few other characteristics of archaeal flagella
make them more alike bacterial pili than flagella: as bacterial pilins, archaeal flagellins (i) are made as preproteins
with short signal peptides that are processed by a recently
identified archaeal-specific signal peptidase (called FlaK)
[12-14] that shows weak sequence similarity with the bacterial pili leader peptidase PilD, (ii) are likely added at the
base of the filament as in bacterial pili, and (iii) undergo
glycosylation as post-translational modification [15] (see
[5] for a recent review). Moreover, one component of
archaeal flagella (FlaI) is homologous to bacterial PilT, an
ATPase involved in bacterial pilin export (a type II/IV
secretion system) and pilus retraction during twitching
motility [16]. However, none of the remaining archaeal
flagellum components are homologous to those of bacterial pili [5]. Moreover, bacterial pili are not rotating structures, and no specific anchoring structures have ever been
observed, indicating substantial differences between these
two cellular structures.
A number of putative flagellum accessory genes lie close
to flagellin genes in archaeal genomes (called flaC, flaD/
flaE, flaF, flaG, flaH, flaI, and flaJ) [5]. Their putative role
in flagellum structure and assembly was tentatively
deduced based on their sequences, cellular location, and
mutation experiments [4-6].
FlaC, FlaD, FlaH and FlaI are associated with the membrane fraction in Methanococcus voltae and may thus be
peripheral components of the archaeal flagellum [5,6].
FlaH, FlaI and FlaJ may be important for the assembly of
archaeal flagella and possibly form a secretion complex

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/106

[5,6]. FlaH harbors a domain similar to that found in bacterial RecA-like ATPases, and FlaH mutants are nonmotile
and nonflagellated [17]. FlaJ contains many transmembrane domains, while FlaI probably encodes an ATPase
that may be important for flagellins export, similarly to
the role of its bacterial homologue, the pilin export
ATPase PilT, and/or for providing the force for rotation.
No experimental data are presently available for FlaG and
FlaF, although FlaG may be a component of the anchoring
system between the hook and the filament [6]. It may be
possible that some of the multiple flagellin proteins have
different roles in flagellum substructures other than the
filament [6]. Finally, additional components of the
archaeal flagellum may be encoded by genes that have not
yet been identified.
The uniqueness of the archaeal flagellum in terms of components, structure, and assembly indicates that archaeal
and bacterial flagella have distinct origins (i.e. they are
analogous systems). Interestingly, homologues of most
bacterial chemotaxis genes are found in archaeal genomes
[5,18], suggesting that archaeal and bacterial chemotaxis
systems are evolutionary related. However, their interaction with the flagellum system in Archaea remains largely
unknown (for a recent review see [19]). In this work, we
sought to contribute to the research on archaeal flagella
and archaeal motility in general performing an accurate
phylogenomic study (sensu Eisen [20]) of the archaeal
motility apparatus in terms of taxonomic distribution of
the genes coding for its components, their genomic context, and their phylogeny. This allowed us to sketch a fairly
detailed image on the origin and evolution of this macromolecular structure.

Results
Taxonomic distribution and genomic context
The taxonomic distribution of the genes coding for
archaeal flagellum components is congruent with that
presented in a recent review[5] and is generally consistent
with species descriptions [21]. Gene homologues for all
components of the archaeal flagellum are found in the
complete genomes of Archaea that are described as motile
[5] (indicated by M and ● signs in Figure 1). Conversely,
no homologues of genes coding archaeal flagellum proteins are found in the complete genomes of Archaea that
are described as non motile [5] (indicated by NM and ❍
signs in Figure 1). Although the representative of the
Methanosarcina genus (i.e. Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina acetivorans and Methanosarcina barkeri) are
described as non-motile [21], at least a full complement
of homologues of the genes coding for archaeal flagellum
components is present in the complete genomes of these
species [5,22] (Red rectangles in Figure 1). Conversely, no
homologues of the genes coding for archaeal flagellum
components are found in the complete genome of Pyrob-

aculum aerophilum [5] (Yellow rectangle in Figure 1). This
is surprising since the genus Pyrobaculum is described as
"motile due to flagellation" in the Bergey's manual and a
picture is included of a "platinum shadowed cell showing
flagella of P. aerophilum" [21]. Similarly, no homologues
of the genes coding for archaeal flagellum components are
present in the complete genome of Methanopyrus kandleri
[5] (Yellow rectangle in Figure 1), which is described as
motile in the Bergey's manual [21].
In all archaeal genomes harboring flagellum components,
the corresponding genes are always organized into one or
two very well conserved clusters [5] (fla clusters, Figure 2).
The only exception is the gene coding for the preflagellin
peptidase FlaK, which is located close to the fla cluster in
Methanococcus jannaschii only [5]. flaK homologues are
nevertheless always present, at least in single copy at different locations in the other archaeal genomes, to the
notable exception of Aeropyrum pernix, Thermoplasma acidophilum and Thermoplasma volcanium. We verified that
these species do not harbor any homologue of PilD -the
bacterial prepilin peptidase- that they may have recruited
by horizontal gene transfer, and how they cope with the
absence of this enzymatic activity (or which non-homologous enzyme performs the function) remains puzzling.
A careful observation of gene order within each cluster
revealed two types of organizations, that we will hereafter
call fla1 and fla2 (Figure 2). fla1 clusters are characterized
by the presence of flaC, plus one or few copies of flaD
(also annotated as flaE), or by a fusion of flaC and flaD
(Figure 2A), whereas fla2 clusters lack these genes (Figure
2B). Nevertheless, psi-Blast searches revealed that the
genes (hyp1 and hyp2, Figure 2B) lying between flaB and
flaG in fla2 clusters from Methanomicrobia (Methanosarcinales and the Methanomicrobiale Methanospirillum
hungatei) and Archaeoglobales may be a very distant
homologue of flaD, as already suggested [5]. A second
characteristic differentiates fla1 and fla2 clusters: they
show an inverted order of flaG and flaF. While the gene
order in fla1 clusters is flaB-flaC-flaD-flaF-flaG-flaH-flaIflaJ, fla2 clusters (lacking flaC/D) display the order flaBflaG-flaF-flaH-flaI-flaJ (Figure 2). Interestingly, all the
archaeal genomes contain only a single type of fla clusters
(i.e. fla1 or fla2), except M. burtonii that is the only species
that harbors both type I and II fla clusters. fla1 clusters are
present only in Euryarchaeota: Thermococcales (Pyrococcus abyssi, Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus horikoshii and
Thermococcus kodakarensis), Methanococcales (Methanocaldococcus jannashii and Methanococcus maripaludis), Thermoplasmatales
(Thermoplasma
acidophilum
and
Thermoplasma volcanium), Halobacteriales (Haloarcula
marismortuii, Halobacterium sp. and Natromonas pharaonis),
and Methanomicrobia(Methanococcoides burtonii) (Figure
2A); whereas fla2 clusters are present in Crenarchaeota:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/106

Desulfurococcales (Aeropyrum pernix) and Sulfolobales
(Sulfolobus solfataricus Sulfolobus tokodaii Sulfolobus acidocaldarius) and in some Euryarchaeota: Methanomicrobia
(Methanospirillum hungatei, Methanococcoides burtonii,
Methanosarcina acetivorans, Methanosarcina mazei and
Methanosarcina barkeri) and the Archaeoglobale Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Figure 2B). In Halobacteriales and Sulfolobales the clusters also include non-flagellum genes
(Figure 2A). In particular, a gene coding for a homologue
of a bacterial chemotaxis component (MCP domain signal transducer) is present in Halobacterium sp., and three
genes coding for components of the chemotaxis system
are present in H. marismortui (CheY, CheA, and CheD)
and in N. pharaonis (CheY, CheC, and CheD). In this
archaeon, the operon is disrupted, the second half lying at
~50 ORFs downstream (Figure 2A). Interestingly,M. mazei
and M. acetivorans each harbor two copies of the fla2 cluster (hereafter called fla2A and fla2B), that differ in the
number of flagellin gene copies (two in fla2A and one in
fla2B), and in the presence of two different hypothetical
genes (possibly very distant homologues of flaD, see
above) lying in between the genes coding for FlaB and
FlaG (Figure 2B). According to these characteristics, the A.
fulgidus, the M. hungatei and one of the M. burtonii gene
clusters resemble more to the fla2A cluster, while that
from M. barkeri resembles more to the fla2B cluster (Figure 2B). Multiple copies of flagellin genes (flaB/flaA) are
found in most archaeal genomes, especially in Thermococcales, whereas Thermoplasmatales and Sulfolobales
harbor single gene copies (Figure 2), confirming earlier
studies on the composition of the flagella from T. volcanium and S. shibatae [23]. In M. hungatei, the flagellin
genes lie in another region of the chromosome (two are
clustered together and an additional small one is isolated
(Figure 2B)), suggesting a disruption of the original cluster. This is also the case of the fla1 cluster of M. burtonii,
which presents no nearby flagellin genes (a single isolated
flaB gene was possibly part of this cluster before disruption, Figure 2A and see below). In S. solfataricus a transposase disrupts the gene coding for FlaG (Figure 2B).
However, both the N- and C-ter sequences of FlaG are still
very similar to FlaG homologues found in S. solfataricus
close relatives (e.g. S. acidocaldarius and S. tokodaii), suggesting that the disruption of flaG is recent. Indeed, the
sequenced genome of S. solfataricus presents indeed a high
number of insertion elements that may have recently
invaded this strain [24]. Interestingly, cells of this strain
appear non-flagellated under the electron microscope (P.
Redder, personal communication) even if the disruption
of the flaG gene does not affect the transcription of the
downstream operon genes [25]. This suggests that FlaG
(possibly involved in the flagellum anchoring system [6])
is an essential flagellum component.

Schematic phylogeny adapted from [29] showing the relationship between the main archaeal phyla for which completely
sequenced genomes are available in databases. Motility or non-motility by the mean of a flagellum of each organism according
to [21] is indicated by M and NM, respectively (NA is used when no information is available). Black circles and open circles
indicate the presence or the absence of flagellum components coding gene in the genomes of the considered organisms,
respectively. Red rectangles indicate the presence of flagellum component coding genes in organisms described as non-motile
whereas yellow rectangles indicate the absence of flagellum component coding genes in organisms described as motile.
Finally, additional copies of flagellum components lie in
a few instances outside of the clusters (examples are additional flaB genes in M. burtonii, the two Thermoplasmatales, H. marismortui and N. pharaonis; an additional flaG in
Halobacterium sp.; an additional flaD in H. marismortui, N.
pharaonis, and M. burtonii; an additional flaF in M. maripaludis, and an additional flaK in Methanococcales) (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses were performed on six amino acid
sequence datasets corresponding to FlaA/B, FlaD/E, FlaG,
FlaH, FlaI, and FlaJ. Phylogenetic analysis of FlaC, FlaF
and FlaK could not be performed due to a too restricted
phylogenetic distribution of FlaC, and the poor sequence
conservation of FlaF and FlaK.

FlaG, FlaH, FlaI, FlaJ
Among all archaeal flagellum components, FlaH, FlaI and
FlaJ are the most conserved at the sequence level and
always lie close to each other in all the analyzed genomes
(Figure 2) strengthening their likely fundamental role in
flagellum assembly and function (see above). FlaI has a
number of bacterial homologues belonging to type IV and
type II secretion systems, including the typeIV pili component PilT [26]. Moreover, FlaI has additional archaeal
homologues that are also probably part of yet to describe
secretion machineries [27,28]. In a phylogeny including
all these homologues FlaI sequences form a monophyletic
group and are most closely related to their archaeal counterparts (not shown). FlaH shares a RecA-like ATPase
domain with distant archaeal and bacterial homologues
that are not involved in motility structures. Psi-blast

archaeal homologues annotated as involved in type II
secretion and (ii) weak similarities with the bacterial pilus
assembly protein TadC and TadB.
FlaJ shares the domain GSPII F with TadC and TadB. However, this may not be significant, given that the domain
was defined on the basis of an alignment that included
both archaeal and bacterial sequences. The similarity
between the FlaJ sequences and TadB and TadC sequences
is very weak (16% and 35% of identity and similarity with
TadB sequences, respectively and 14% and 32% of identity and similarity with TadC sequences, respectively) and
is mainly the result of the sharing of small hydrophobic

amino acids. To our point of view this sequence similarity
is too weak to definitively conclude that these sequences
are homologues although this has been claimed [27].
After removal of ambiguously aligned positions, 104,
193, 392 and 353 amino acids could be kept for phylogenetic analysis of FlaG, FlaH, FlaI, and FlaJ, respectively.
The resulting trees are strikingly congruent (Figure 3).
Notably, all major archaeal groups except Methanomicrobia (Methanomicrobiales plus Methanosarcinales) are
well defined and strongly supported statistically (Bootstrap Values -BV- > 990‰ and/or Posterior Probabilities PP- = 1), suggesting that no recent horizontal transfer of
flaH, flaG, flaI and flaJ genes occurred across these groups.

The sequences from Methanomicrobia form a well supported cluster (BV > 980‰ and/or Posterior Probabilities
-PP- = 1) that also includes sequences from A. fulgidus. It
is not possible for the time being to decide whether this is
due to a HGT or a hidden paralogy. Importantly, the corresponding trees are also strongly consistent with gene
cluster organization. In fact, homologues from fla1 and
fla2 clusters (characterized by a flaF-flaG and by a flaG-flaF
gene order, respectively) form two distinct strongly groups
(BV > 975‰ and PP = 1, Figure 3). In particular, in all
four trees, the homologues from the fla2 clusters of M.
hungatei, the four Methanosarcinales and A. fulgidus
appear close to Crenarchaeota (Figure 3). This is in contrast to their expected position as sister-group of Halobacteriales within Euryarchaeota (Figure 1, [29,30]).
Interestingly, such expected position is shown by the M.
burtonii sequences belonging to its fla1 cluster (Figure 2A).
This suggests that the fla1 and fla2 clusters from M. burtonii have different origins (see below). Independent species-specific duplications of flaG appear to have occurred
in Halobacterium sp., N. pharaonis, and M. hungatei (tandem gene duplications in these last two species). Moreover, in the FlaH, FlaI and FlaJ phylogenies, the sequences
from M. burtonii, M. hungatei, M. barkeri and A. fulgidus
fla2 clusters group with the sequences belonging to the
fla2B cluster from M. mazei and M. acetivorans (Figures 3B,
3C and 3D, respectively), supporting a close relationship
of these clusters, as suggested by their gene organization
(Figure 2B).
FlaD/E
As discussed above, homologues of FlaD/E genes are missing in all fla2 clusters from Crenarchaea. In fla2 clusters
from Methanomicrobia and A. fulgidus the two hypothetical proteins hyp1 and hyp2 could be distantly related to
FlaD/E (Figure 2B). However they are too distant to be
included in any phylogenetic analysis. The small number
of unambiguously aligned positions (77 amino acids
positions) that could be kept for phylogenetic analysis
gives a poor resolution of the relationships between major
euryarchaeal groups (Figure 4A). However, sequences
from phyla form monophyletic groups generally well supported (BV = 996‰, PP = 0.93, BV = 1000‰ and BV =
958‰ for Halobacteriales, Methanosarcinales, Thermoplasmatales and Thermococcales, respectively, Figure 4A).
This indicates that, similarly to FlaG, FlaI, FlaJ, and FlaH,
no recent HGT involving the flaD/E gene occurred among
these groups. Interestingly, a tandem duplication event
appears to have occurred in an ancestor of Methanococcales, with the two copies having been conserved within the
cluster. Halobacteriales also harbor two copies of flaD.
One of the two copies is fused with flaC and always resides
within the fla cluster, whereas the second copy resides
within the fla cluster only in Halobacterium sp. This suggests that the fusion of flaC and flaD genes occurred before

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/106

the divergence of the three Halobacteriales, but after the
duplication event and that one of the two copies was displaced after the duplication event in the ancestor of H.
marismortui and N. pharaonis. A similar duplication of
FlaD followed by a fusion of one of the two copies of FlaD
and FlaC also appears to have occurred in M. burtonii. As
in most Halobacteriales one of the two copies resides outside the fla cluster (Figure 2A) suggesting its displacement
after the duplication event. The poor resolution of the
relationships between groups (due to the small number of
positions kept for the phylogenetic analysis) does not permit to determine if a single fusion event of FlaC and FlaD
occurred in ancestor of Halobacteriales and Methanomicrobia or if this event occurred two times independently
in both lineages.
FlaB
Given the use of only 72 unambiguously aligned positions for analysis, the FlaB tree presents a number of
poorly resolved nodes (Figure 4B). Nevertheless, the
monophyly of a number of groups is recovered and supported by BV > 850‰, except for Thermococcales, Methanococcales and Methanomicrobia. As for FlaG, FlaI, FlaJ,
and FlaH, the FlaB tree is again strongly consistent with
gene cluster organization (Figure 4B). In particular, the
FlaB from the fla2 clusters of M. hungatei, the four Methanosarcinales and A. fulgidus appear close to Crenarchaeota, while the isolated FlaB from M. burtonii appear close
to Halobacteria, and thus likely functions with the flagellum components of fla1 cluster (Figure 4B). Interestingly,
the multiple copies of flagellins group in a group-specific
manner (Figure 4B), suggesting that flagellin gene family
expansion occurred mainly by gene duplication and multiple times independently in different species, and not by
HGT.

Discussion and conclusion
The archaeal flagellum is a complex cellular structure
composed of multiple subunits and anchored to the
membrane. The striking conservation of the genomic context of the genes coding for these subunits indicates a
likely highly coordinated expression and assembly mechanisms. Coupled to the high sequence conservation of the
different subunits across archaeal species inhabiting very
different habitats, this underlines the importance for
structural maintenance of the archaeal flagellum. However, we highlighted an important dimorphism of the
genetic context organization, with two types of gene clusters harboring differences in both gene content and gene
order (Figure 2). In fact, most Euryarchaea exhibit the fla1
cluster, whereas all the Crenarchaea and some Euryarchaea have the fla2 cluster (e.g. Methanomicrobia and A.
fulgidus). The difference between the two clusters is
strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis, and indicates that Methanomicrobia and A. fulgidus flagellum

Figure 3 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of FlaG (A), FlaH (B), FlaI (C) and FlaJ (D)
Unrooted
Unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of FlaG (A), FlaH (B), FlaI (C) and FlaJ (D). Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values for 1000 replicates of the original dataset and posterior probabilities, computed by PHYML and MrBayes, respectively. The scale bar represents the average number of substitutions per site. The phylogenies show a clear separation between
the type I clusters (characterized by a FlaF FlaG order of genes) and type II clusters (characterized by a FlaG FlaF order of
genes).
components encoded by fla2 gene clusters are more
closely related to their crenarchaeal homologues than to
the homologues encoded by the fla1 gene cluster of their
close relatives (i.e. M. burtonii, Thermoplasmatales and
Halobacteriales, Figures 1, 3 and 4). Two different evolutionary scenarios can be proposed to explain our results.
In the first scenario (Figure 5), the last ancestor of Archaea
was flagellated and had the two types of clusters (i.e. both
fla1 and fla2, blue and red clusters, respectively, Figure 5),
resulting from the duplication of an ancestral cluster (purple cluster, Figure 5), and these were secondarily and differently lost during archaeal lineages evolution (seven
losses of the fla1 cluster and nine losses of the fla2 cluster).
Importantly, some of these losses would have also
occurred recently in the Euryarchaea (for example the loss
of the fla1 cluster in the Methanosarcinale lineage would
have occurred after the divergence of M. burtonii, that

would have kept the two types of clusters). Finally, a
duplication event of the whole fla2 cluster occurred in an
ancestor of Methanosarcina (red circle, Figure 5) leading to
the fla2B cluster (orange cluster, Figure 5). This first scenario involves 16 losses, and implies that the ancestor of
Archaea and the ancestor of each euryarchaeal group had
two types of flagella. Moreover, it does not explain the
position of A. fulgidus sequences within the Methanomicrobia group and not as sister of this group, as generally
indicated by molecular phylogeny of multiple markers
(Figure 1 and [30]). A second scenario involves less losses
(three losses of the fla2 cluster and seven losses of the fla1
cluster) (Figure 6 and Figure 7 for a more detailed scenario). Here, the ancestor of Archaea was also flagellated,
but had only a single type of fla cluster (either fla1, fla2, or
else, purple cluster in Figure 6 and Figure 7). After the
divergence of Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea (black circle,

Figure 6 and Figure 7), evolution led to the fla1 and fla2
clusters. A single HGT of the fla2 cluster would have then
occurred from some ancestors of Sulfolobales and Desulfurococcales to an ancestor of Methanomicrobia (Figure 6
Figure 7, HGT 1), and was followed by a HGT from some
ancestors of Methanosarcinales to A. fulgidus (Figure 6 Figure 7, HGT 2). Methanosarcina, M. hungatei and A. fulgidus
would thus have lost their original fla1 gene cluster before
or after their replacement by a fla2 gene cluster of crenarchaeal origin. We favor a HGT from Crenarchaea to Methanomicrobia rather than the opposite, since in this case
we would expect to find the M. burtonii fla1 genes more
closely related to their paralogues belonging to the fla2

cluster than to their fla1 orthologues from Halobacteriales.
Both scenarios imply that the archaeal flagellum would
have appeared prior to the last archaeal ancestor
Apart these two likely cases of HGT of the entire fla2 gene
cluster, we found no clear evidence for recent transfers of
the genes coding for flagellum components among
archaeal species. Indeed, the poor resolution of interphyla relationships in some trees is more likely due to lack
of phylogenetic signal rather than horizontal gene transfer. One explanation for the rarity of HGT is that it is pos-

An evolutionary scenario for the origin and evolution of the archaeal flagellum. Blue, red, orange and purple clusters represent
fla1 cluster, fla2A cluster, fla2B cluster and their ancestor, respectively. The black circle represents the last common ancestor
of Archaea. The green circle represents the duplication event that led to the fla1 and fla2 clusters. This duplication event
occurred before the last common ancestor of Archaea, which thus harbored the two types of clusters. The red circle represents the recent duplication event of the fla2 cluster in ancestor of Methanosarcina. The blue and red crosses represent the loss

sible the result of the high level of integration of flagellum
components within the macromolecular structure. Importantly, this contradicts the generally assumed notion that
HGT of "informational" genes (i.e. those coding for proteins involved in the expression and the transmission of
genetic information) are less frequent than those involving the remaining ones ("operational") genes. Nevertheless, the acquisition of a whole flagellum component
coding gene cluster from distant donors seems possible.
Interestingly, even if two clusters coexist within a genome
(i.e. in M. burtonii) neither gene recombination is
observed between homologous genes belonging to the
two clusters, nor losses, suggesting that the components of
a cluster may interact preferentially due to coevolution,
although they form similar cellular structures. The presence in M. burtonii of two types of fla clusters (possibly
one native and one acquired by HGT from crenarchaeota)
represents an interesting experimental model to study. It
would be in fact particular interesting to know the difference between the components encoded by the two fla

clusters in terms of expression and assembly, and how two
different flagellum systems coexist in this archaeon.
Finally, it has been suggested that archaea are modified
Actinobacteria and that archaeal flagella are derived from
bacterial flagella following an adaptation to acidic environments by the recruitment of an already acid-stable
glycoprotein from the pilus machinery that would have
replaced the original flagellin while leaving intact the
basal rotary motor [31]. We find this hypothesis unlikely
for the fact that archaeal flagella do not resemble to bacterial flagella in major structure, assembly, and components, and not only concerning flagellin. Indeed, no even
distant homologues to any component, including the
basal rotary motor, of bacterial flagella can be recovered in
archaeal genomes, including the related type III secretion
system components [28]. Moreover, flagella of acidophilic bacteria (such as Thiobacillus) show a typical bacterial structure (e.g. a diameter of approximately 20 nm), so
they adapted to acidic conditions without radically modi-

fying their motility structures and components [28].
Indeed, the uncomplete genome of the extreme acidophilic bacterium (optimal pH<3) Acidobacterium capsulatum contains a clear homologue of bacterial flagellin,
indicating that adaptation to acidic environments was
possible without its replacement.
The lack of congruence between the description of
archaeal species as motile or non-motile and the taxonomic distribution of homologues of flagellum component coding genes[5] is particularly striking and
underlines the need to explore more in depth the motility
systems in Archaea. The presence of two gene clusters in
non motile Methanosarcinales is particularly puzzling.
Either these species can be flagellated under particular
conditions that have not yet been tested, or the flagellum
component homologues are involved in other functions
than motility (for example, they could be required for cellcell adhesion to form cell aggregates, a peculiarity of this
archaeal family). It will be extremely interesting to study

the expression and localization of the flagellum components in Methanosarcinales, in the light of the fact that the
flagellum genes of Methanosarcinales may have been
recruited from the distantly related Crenarchaeota, since
this event may have been an important step in the evolution of this archaeal lineage. Moreover, virtually nothing
is known about other types of motility than swimming in
archaea [28], while in bacteria these are starting being
investigated [4]. The fact that no homologues of flagellum
components are encoded in the genomes of at least two
archaeal species that are described as motile (M. kandleri
and P. aerophilum) is also puzzling. Although it is possible
that the strains used for genome sequencing have lost the
flagellum operon following lab cultivation (see for example [32], it would surely be interesting to test motility in
these archaeal species. Alternatively, this observation
could also suggest that other types of motility may occur
in archaea and are made possible by still unknown molecular structures. It would also be very useful to investigate
the relationship between the flagellum and the secretion

A detailed evolutionary scenario for the origin and the evolution of the archaeal flagellum based on figure 6. The purple cluster
represents the ancestor of fla1 and fla2 clusters. The black circle represents the last common ancestor of Archaea. Blue
arrows represent the recent duplication events. Black arrows indicate gene movements to different locations from their original positions in the cluster. Dark green { symbols indicate gene insertions within the clusters. The blue, red and black crosses
represent the loss of the fla1 cluster, fla2A cluster, or of single genes, respectively. A red arrow indicates gene inversion. F indicates the fusion of FlaC and FlaD. The green arrows represent horizontal gene transfers.
systems in Archaea. Indeed, archaeal genomes harbor
only a few homologues of bacterial TypeII/IV secretion
systems [28], and it is not known whether they form pili,
despite rare observations [33-35] and evidence for conjugation [36-38].
To sum up, two radically different options for motility
were adopted at the divergence of the two prokaryotic
domains, and much still remain to be uncovered on
archaeal motility systems.

Methods
Data set construction
The list of archaeal flagellum components was retrieved
from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [39].
Homologous sequences of each archaeal flagellum com-

ponent were retrieved from the nr database at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information [40]
using the BlastP program with different seeds [41] and the
ALIBABA program (P. Lopez personal communication).
For each dataset, additional searches using psi-Blast were
performed to search for divergent homologues (especially
from bacteria) [41]. tBlastN searches on the unfinished
genomes of the Halobacteriale Haloferax volcanii were performed at TIGR [42]. Multiple alignments were done with
ClustalW [43] and MUSCLE [44]. For each dataset, the
quality of the alignments obtained with CLUSTALW and
MUSCLE, was evaluated with T-COFFEE (CLUSTALW and
MUSCLE provided alignments of comparable quality, not
shown) [45]. All the alignments were edited and manually improved using the ED program from the MUST package [46]. Regions where the homology between sites was

doubtful were manually removed from the datasets for
phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analysis
Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were computed with Phyml [47,48] and the JJT model of amino
acid substitution (Jones, Taylor and Thornton [49]. A
gamma correction with 4 discrete classes of sites was used
to take into account the heterogeneity of evolutionary
rates across sites. The alpha parameter and the proportion
of invariable sites were estimated for each dataset. The
robustness of each branch was estimated by non-parametric bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) using PHYML. In
addition, bayesian analyses were performed using
MrBayes [50] with a mixed model of amino acid substitution. As for ML tree reconstruction, a gamma correction
with 4 discrete classes of sites was used and the alpha
parameter and the proportion of invariable sites were estimated. MrBayes was run with four chains for 1 million
generations and trees were sampled every 100 generations. To construct the consensus tree, the first 1500 trees
were discarded as "burnin".
Genomic context analysis
The genomic localization of each archaeal flagellum component was manually investigated in all archaeal complete genomes available at the NCBI.
