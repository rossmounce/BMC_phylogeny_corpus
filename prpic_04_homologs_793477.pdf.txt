Abstract
Background: The Drosophila genes wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) comprise the top level
of a hierarchical gene cascade involved in proximal-distal (PD) patterning of the legs. It remains
unclear, whether this cascade is common to the appendages of all arthropods. Here, wg and dpp
are studied in the millipede Glomeris marginata, a representative of the Myriapoda.
Results: Glomeris wg (Gm-wg) is expressed along the ventral side of the appendages compatible
with functioning during the patterning of both the PD and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes. Gm-wg may also
be involved in sensory organ formation in the gnathal appendages by inducing the expression of
Distal-less (Dll) and H15 in the organ primordia. Expression of Glomeris dpp (Gm-dpp) is found at the
tip of the trunk legs as well as weakly along the dorsal side of the legs in early stages. Taking data
from other arthropods into account, these results may be interpreted in favor of a conserved mode
of WG/DPP signaling. Apart from the main PD axis, many arthropod appendages have additional
branches (e.g. endites). It is debated whether these extra branches develop their PD axis via the
same mechanism as the main PD axis, or whether branch-specific mechanisms exist. Gene
expression in possible endite homologs in Glomeris argues for the latter alternative.
Conclusion: All available data argue in favor of a conserved role of WG/DPP morphogen gradients
in guiding the development of the main PD axis. Additional branches in multibranched
(multiramous) appendage types apparently do not utilize the WG/DPP signaling system for their
PD development. This further supports recent work on crustaceans and insects, that lead to similar
conclusions.

Background
The genes wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) are
important factors for the normal development of the Drosophila legs. Both genes encode secreted morphogens that
generate combinatorial gradients across the developing
imaginal leg discs (e.g. [1]). These gradients form the top
level in a PD axis patterning cascade and they control

expression of the genes at the next level of the cascade, the
leg-gap genes (e.g. Distal-less (Dll), dachshund (dac)) (e.g.
[2,3]). Thus, wg and dpp are key factors involved in the
early events of PD axis formation.
In recent years several comparative studies in other arthropod species have suggested that the action of the leg-gap

genes in PD patterning is evolutionarily conserved [4-9].
Tus, the question arose as to whether the regulation of the
leg-gap genes by the WG/DPP morphogen gradient is also
conserved. The currently available data provide no clear
answer. Initially, the expression patterns did not support
the conservation of this top level of the PD axis patterning
cascade [9,10]. Other authors, however, have argued in
favor of a conservation of WG/DPP morphogen signaling
in PD axis formation [6]. Furthermore, many arthropods
have appendages with more than one PD axis. It is currently debated whether these multiple axes are all patterned by a cascade involving wg and dpp at the top level,
or whether the different branches are patterned through
branch-specific mechanisms.
The comparative analyses of wg and dpp expression during
appendage formation to date mainly focus on insects (e.g.
Tribolium, Gryllus, Schistocerca, Athalia [9-12]). Only a few
representatives of the crustaceans and chelicerates have
been studied from other arthropod classes [6,13]. Here, I
report on results concerning wg and dpp expression in the
appendages of a representative of the fourth extant arthropod class, the myriapod Glomeris marginata. The wg gene
of Glomeris is expressed on the ventral side of the appendages compatible with a conserved role in PD axis development. Additionally, Glomeris wg may induce expression
of the genes Dll and H15 in the sensory organs of the
mouthparts. The results with the Glomeris dpp gene are
more ambiguous. Although the data can be interpreted in
favor of a conservation of the WG/DPP morphogen gradients, clearly more work on the subject is necessary to clarify the evolution of PD axis patterning in arthropod
appendages. In particular, it will be necessary to elucidate
the mechanisms through which the additional PD axes in
multibranched appendages are patterned.

Results
Cloning of Gm-dpp cDNA fragments
A fragment of a Glomeris gene that shows sequence similarity to members of the TGF-beta gene family was isolated. In order to establish the orthology of this fragment,
I performed a phylogenetic analysis incorporating a selection of TGF-beta proteins from Drosophila, other arthropods and a variety of deuterostome taxa. The resulting
phylogenetic tree distinguishes two groups of proteins.
One group comprises the arthropod dpp genes and their
deuterostome homologs, the BMP2/4 genes. The second
group consists of the Drosophila TGF-beta genes screw
(scw) and glass bottom boat (gbb), and the remaining deuterostome BMP genes with TGF-beta homology, including
zebrafish anti dorsalizing morphogenetic protein (ADMP).
The Glomeris fragment resides in the dpp/BMP2/4 group
and is therefore designated as Gm-dpp (Fig. 1). The resolution within the dpp/BMP2/4 group is low, with many
nodes lacking statistical support. The Glomeris fragment

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/6

forms a group together with dpp from the two-spotted
cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) and BMP2/4 from the yellow
acorn worm (Ptychodera flava). However, support for this
grouping is not statistically significant (reliability value =
27). A higher resolution of the dpp/BMP2/4 group may be
achieved in the future by the aquisition of additional
sequence information.
Expression of Gm-dpp during embryogenesis
The expression of a number of developmental genes has
been studied in the pill millipede Glomeris marginata
[7,14-17]. Of all genes studied so far the expression of
Gm-dpp is the weakest. A specific in situ hybridization signal is observed after approximately six hours of staining,
whereas the normal staining interval of other genes ranges
between 15 and 30 minutes. This extended staining time
is responsible for the intense artificial background that is
visible in the preparations displayed in this paper (see
Figs. 2, 3).

In younger stages, a specific staining is seen in the forming
appendage buds and along the external, i.e. dorsal, rim of
the neuroectoderm (Fig. 2A; arrow). It is known that the
neuroectoderm of each hemisegment is divided into a
dorsal, medial and ventral portion [16]. Judging from its
expression, it is possible that Gm-dpp has a role in the
development of the dorsal portion of the neuroectoderm.
A role in the developing ventral portion is also possible,
since Gm-dpp is transiently expressed along the ventral
midline (Fig. 2B; arrows). A further expression domain in
the central nervous system is seen in the area of the developing optic centers of the brain (Fig. 2C,2D,2E; arrows).
Starting with stage 4, Gm-dpp is expressed along the external rim of the germband in tissue that will later form the
heart (Fig. 2D,2E; arrowheads). Later on, segmentally
repeated patches of weak Gm-dpp expression appear on
the dorsal side of the embryos (Fig. 2F; arrowheads).
These patches are presumably also correlated with the
developing heart of the embryos. Finally, expression of
Gm-dpp is found in the stomodaeum, and very weakly in
the proctodaeum.
Expression profile of Gm-dpp during appendage
development
The appendages buds show weak expression of Gm-dpp at
the very beginning of their formation (Fig. 2A,2B). Later
on, different appendages display appendage-specific
expression patterns. In the trunk legs, the strongest expression is seen at the leg tips. In early developmental stages
the expression fills almost the entire tip, and the border
against the ventral portion of the legs (which is devoid of
expression) is rather distinct (Fig. 3A). There is also
expression of Gm-dpp along the dorsal side of the trunk
legs, but this is visibly weaker than the expression in the

leg tips. The expression at the leg tips is clearly confined to
the dorsal side of the tip in legs of stage 5 embryos (Fig.
3E), while the expression along the dorsal side persists,
but becomes weaker and diffuse. Finally, expression of
Gm-dpp in the legs vanishes almost completely at stage 6
(Fig. 3I). The dorsal expression is virtually undetectable,
and only a few cells express Gm-dpp at the tip.
In the maxilla there are two expression domains of Gmdpp, a dorsal and a ventral one (Fig. 3B). The ventral
domain is located on the internal side at the base of the
maxilla. This domain slowly vanishes during develop-

ment (Fig. 3F) and finally disappears around stage 6 (Fig.
3J). The dorsal expression domain runs along the dorsal
edge of the base of the maxilla (Fig. 3B,3F). This domain
also gradually disappears during development, and at
stage 6.1 only a faint dorsal expression is detectable (Fig.
3J).
In the mandible, a dorsal expression domain that runs
along the entire dorsal rim of the appendage is visible
(Fig. 3C). Later on, however, this expression is restricted to
the basal portion of the mandible and has a distinct border against the external lobe (Fig. 3G). Additional

expression domains are detectable at later stages within
the external lobe (Fig. 3K; asterisk) in addition to the
internal side of the internal lobe (Fig. 3G,3K; arrow).
In the antenna, Gm-dpp is expressed in the dorsal half of
the appendage with a distinct border against the non-

expressing ventral half (Fig. 3D). In addition, a patch of
weaker Gm-dpp expression is located on the ventral side of
the antenna (Fig. 3D; square). Another patch of Gm-dpp
expression is visible at the transition between the antennal base and the neuroectoderm of the antennal neuromere (Fig. 3D; asterisk). The latter two patches of

expression disappear during the further course of development. By stage 5 the ventral spot has disappeared
completely, and the patch at the antennal base is virtually
gone as well (Fig. 3H). Similar to the other appendages at
stage 6.1, the level of Gm-dpp expression has also significantly decreased, though one can discern three specific
expression domains at this stage. There are two groups of
cells (at the tip and at the base of the antenna) weakly
expressing Gm-dpp (Fig. 3L; arrow and asterisk, respectively), and a ring of cells at the distal third of the antenna,
where Gm-dpp expression is even weaker (Fig. 3L; square).
Expression profile of Gm-wg during appendage
development
The expression of Gm-wg during germ band segmentation,
neurogenesis, and the development of the digestive system has already been described [14]. Here, I focus on Gmwg expression during the development of the appendages.
Before the onset of limb development, Gm-wg is expressed
in a stripe in each hemisegment. This stripe is located
approximately in the middle of the segment and runs
across the neuroectoderm and the presumptive appendage tissue. Comparison to the expression of engrailed (Gmen) has shown that the stripe of Gm-wg expression abuts
the parasegment border and, thus, is located in cells of the
anterior segmental compartment [14]. The buds of the
appendages form from the tissue at the external ends of
the Gm-wg stripes. Preparations of complete hemisegments of stage 3 embryos show, that expression of Gm-wg
extends more or less contiguously across the neuroectoderm into the forming limb buds in all four different
appendage types (Fig. 4A,4B,4C,4D). The extent to which
the expression reaches into the limb buds varies depending on the appendage type. In the antennal bud the
expression of Gm-wg is restricted to the ventral side (Fig.
4D). In the maxillary and mandibulary buds expression
includes larger areas, approximately two thirds of the
buds (Fig. 4B,4C). Finally, expression is most extensive in
the buds of the trunk legs: almost the entire buds express
Gm-wg (Fig. 4A).

In the trunk legs expression of Gm-wg is restricted to the
ventral side during the further course of development
(Fig. 4E,4I,4M,4Q). The expression is contiguous from the
base of the legs to the tips, but the level of expression is
somewhat heterogeneous. The strongest expression is
seen near the base and in the distal part of the legs, while
expression is visibly weaker between these parts. A similar
phenomenon is present in the antenna (Fig.
4H,4L,4P,4T), where expression is restricted to the ventral
side of the antenna and the level of expression at the distal
end is much stronger than in more proximal parts. However, unlike the pattern in the legs, the intensity of expression at the base of the antenna is not increased.

The maxilla displays a rather dynamic expression profile
of Gm-wg. Beginning at stage 4 the gene is expressed along
the ventral edge of the maxilla (Fig. 4F). Three domains
can be distinguished that are not completely separated.
The innermost domain is more diffuse than the other two
domains and at stage 5 separates into two separate patches
of expression (Fig. 4J,4N,4R; two-headed arrow). The two
other domains remain separate during the development
of the maxillary appendage and are reminiscent of the
expression pattern of Gm-Dll (see below).
In the mandible, a similar fragmentation of the initial
mostly homogeneous expression pattern takes place. In
the external lobe the expression is strong throughout and
is separated from the expression domain in the internal
lobe by an area of very weak expression (Fig.
4G,4K,4O,4S). The expression domain in the internal
lobe splits (Fig. 4K), then retracts from the tip of the lobe
(Fig. 4O) and decreases in expression strength (Fig. 4S).
Expression of Gm-wg and Gm-Dll in the gnathal sensory
organs
As mentioned above, the expression pattern of Gm-wg in
the maxilla is reminiscent of the pattern described for GmDll [7], and at first glance both patterns appear virtually
identical. The Gm-Dll gene is expressed in the primordia
of the maxillary sensory organs. Expression of the Gm-wg
gene, however, is at least partially complementary to the
pattern of Gm-Dll. In older stages, strong expression of
Gm-wg is not detected within the primordia of the sensory
organs, but rather it surrounds the primordia (Fig. 4R). In
preparations simultaneously labeled with probes against
Gm-wg and Gm-Dll the composite expression pattern
stains the entire internal side of the maxilla (Fig. 5A,5C),
indicating that both patterns complement each other.
However, the maxillary expression of Gm-wg in three
(later four) domains is more extensive than the more
restricted expression pattern of Gm-Dll in two (later three)
well-defined stripes (see [7]). Therefore, the expression
patterns are certainly not mutually exclusive. The presumed overlap of the two expression patterns, however,
cannot be detected with the double labeling technique
used here.

In addition, a complex and dynamic pattern of Gm-Dll has
been described in the mandible [7]. In contrast to the
maxilla, the patterns of Gm-wg and Gm-Dll appear to overlap completely in the mandible. In preparations of mandibles labeled with a cocktail of probes against both genes
no significant difference to the pattern of Gm-wg alone is
observed (Fig. 5B,5D), indicating that the Gm-Dll pattern
is entirely included in the Gm-wg pattern.

Despite these differences in expression, it has been argued
that the combined action of the WG and DPP morphogen
gradients is conserved, and that the differences in expression of dpp are correlated with the differences in the mode
of leg development between Drosophila (via imaginal
discs) and most other arthropods (normal leg outgrowth)
[6].

Discussion
Establishment of the primary PD axis
In Drosophila dpp is expressed in a narrow dorsal sector in
the leg imaginal discs, whereas wg is expressed in a similar
sector on the ventral side (e.g. [1]). Together these two
genes generate morphogen gradients in the developing leg
imaginal discs. These gradients are utilized by several
genes to guide the development of the PD axis of the leg
imaginal discs. Evolutionary developmental studies have
shown that the expression of wg homologs along the ventral side of the appendages is highly conserved in the
arthropods (e.g. [6,9,10,13]). In contrast, dpp expression
differs from the expression pattern found in Drosophila in
all arthropods studied thus far (e.g. [6,9-12,18,19]). At
early stages expression of arthropod dpp homologs is
restricted to the leg tip, while at later stages expression
rings of unclear significance appear in some species.

The data from Glomeris presented here may be interpreted
in favor of this hypothesis. The Gm-wg gene is expressed
along the ventral side in the legs and Gm-dpp is expressed
most strongly in the leg tips. Taking these expression loci
as the sources of Gm-WG and Gm-DPP protein, the resulting hypothetical protein gradients would facilitate PD patterning events similar to the ones in the Drosophila leg
discs (see also Fig. 11 in [6]). However, Gm-dpp is weakly
expressed along the dorsal leg side. This is similar to the
Drosophila situation, but is contrary to the predictions of
the above hypothesis since Glomeris does not develop the
legs via flat imaginal discs and therefore should show a
dpp expression pattern typical of directly developing legs
rather than a pattern similar to Drosophila. The fact that
Gm-dpp is also weakly expressed along the dorsal side of
the legs may be explained by several possibilities. It may
be argued that the dorsal expression is so weak that it has
no significant influence on the shape of the Gm-DPP protein gradient, which would therefore mainly be dependent on the morphogen source at the tip. It is also possible
that the dorsal expression is unrelated to PD axis formation and instead functions during DV axis formation (see
below).
In any case, the picture emerging from the available data
on dpp expression in arthropods is that the dorsal sector in
Drosophila seems to be an exception rather than the rule.
The hypothesis proposed by Prpic et al. [6] attempts to
explain this by the differences in leg architecture between
Drosophila and most other arthropod species. However,
according to their hypothesis, the presence of combinatorial protein gradients is conserved. It should be pointed
out in this context that the existence of a DPP gradient (or
a WG gradient for that matter) has yet to be demonstrated
in an arthropod other than Drosophila. Thus, although the
expression data may be interpreted as the PD axis patterning using WG/DPP signaling being conserved among
arthropods, it is obvious that comparative expression
analyses alone cannot answer the question satisfactorily.
It must now be considered whether experiments capable
of demonstrating WG/DPP signaling during leg development in arthropods other than Drosophila may be
conceived.
Establishment of secondary PD axes
Aside from the primary PD axis, many arthropods have
limbs with additional branches (rami). It has been

The presence of endites in the mouthparts of myriapods is
unclear, mainly because of the modified morphology of
the adult gnathalia. Certain elements of the centipede
mandible and first maxilla are probably derived from
endites (e.g. [21,22]) and there are attempts to assign
parts of the diplopod mandible as homologous to
crustacean or insect endites (e.g. [21,23]). Indeed, the
embryonic mandible and maxilla in Glomeris develop
ventral lobes that are very reminiscent of the endite lobes
of the embryonic mouthparts in insects. The exclusive
ventral origin of these lobes is further corroborated by the
lack of expression of the dorsal marker optomotor-blind
[17]. Furthermore, the Glomeris lobes possess Dll-positive
sensory organs, which is typical of arthropod endites
[7,24-26]. Thus, although the interpretation of the millipede mouthparts is disputed (see e.g. [27]), these ventral
lobes are likely homologous to the endites present in
insect mouthparts.

observed expression domains in a single drawing although
really some domains appear at different time points (see text
for a description of the temporal expression profile). None
of the possible endite homologs in Glomeris mouthparts (lli,
st, iml, and eml) expresses Gm-dpp in a fashion suggestive of a
role in PD axis patterning. See text for details. Expression of
dpp in Schistocerca is after [11]. Abbreviations: bs, base; ca,

proposed that these additional rami are patterned in the
same way as the main branch, simply by duplications of
the WG/DPP signaling system [20]. Recent results from
the study of insect mouthparts argue against this notion
[11]. The insect labium and maxilla have ventral branches
(endites) that apparently do not utilize a combinatorial
WG/DPP gradient system to guide their outgrowth. A similar conclusion has been reached by a study of the development of crustacean multibranched appendages [13].

The embryonic Glomeris mandible develops two lobes, the
internal and external mandibular lobe. Both lobes express
Gm-dpp, but not at a position suggestive of a role in PD
axis formation (Fig. 6C). In addition, the expression
domain in the external mandibular lobe appears after the
lobe has already grown and is therefore unlikely to be
involved in PD outgrowth. The development of the
maxillae is more complex. They start out as separate
appendages, but around stage 6 the left and the right
maxilla fuse along their internal sides (Fig. 6A,6B). Each
maxilla has a single lobe, containing the primordia of
three sensory organs that can also be visualized by Gm-Dll
expression [7]. The two external sensory organ primordia
form the lobus medius and the lobus exterior in the adult
(see [27] for a detailed description of Glomeris maxillary
morphology). These two sensory structures grow from the
internal side of the stipes (Fig. 6A). The internal sensory
organ primordium is different from the other two in the
sense that it will not end up on the stipes, but will form
the lobus interior that grows from the lamella lingualis
(Fig. 6A). The lamellae linguales of the right and left maxilla fuse around stage 6 to form the intermaxillary plate
(Fig. 6B). The single lobe in the Glomeris embryonic maxilla therefore has a rather complex fate in the adult mouthpart (the gnathochilarium [27]). The portion of the
maxillary lobe that will give rise to the stipes expresses
Gm-dpp at only later stages when the expression along the
dorsal side of the maxillary base is extending weakly into
the stipes. The portion forming the lamella lingualis also
expresses Gm-dpp, but at its internal edge, a location
hardly suggesting a role in PD outgrowth of the maxillary
lobe.
In summary, none of the maxillary and mandibulary
lobes in Glomeris appear to utilize conventional WG/DPP
signaling to organize PD growth. Similar results have been

obtained recently for the endites in the grasshopper Schistocerca and the beetle Tribolium [11]. In Schistocerca at least
one endite (the galea) grows without dpp expression (Fig.
6D), and in Tribolium both maxillary endites lack detectable dpp expression [11]. This indicates that the development of the PD axis of the endites does not generally
require the WG/DPP morphogen system.
Relation of wingless and dpp expression to DV axis
formation
A second role of wg and dpp in Drosophila is the activation
of some factors involved in DV axis formation in the legs
[28,29]. wg, being expressed along the ventral side, is an
instructor of ventral fate, whereas dpp is expressed on the
dorsal side and establishes dorsal fates. The primary factors controlled by wg and dpp are H15 on the ventral side
and omb on the dorsal side. These factors have been
recently studied in Glomeris and in a spider (Cupiennius
salei) [6,17]. The expression patterns suggest that the role
of omb as dorsal instructor is evolutionarily conserved, but
H15 does not seem to be a general ventralizing factor in
all arthropods. Thus, the dorsal, but not the ventral developmental mechanisms seem to be conserved. It is interesting that the expression data of wg and dpp suggest that the
opposite is true. The wg expression on the ventral side is
highly conserved among the arthropods, but the dpp patterns differ between species and in most part expression is
not localized to the entire dorsal side. This paradox clearly
demonstrates the limited understanding of the evolution
of DV axis formation in arthropod appendages.
Patterning of appendicular sensory organs
The maxilla of Glomeris has several sensory organs. Recent
studies have identified the genes Dll, dac and H15, which
show a restricted expression pattern in the primordia of
the maxillary sensory organs [7,17]. Two of these genes,
Dll and H15, are known from Drosophila to be activated
upon signaling through the wingless pathway [29,30]. It is
interesting to note that expression of Gm-wg surrounds
the sensory primordia in the Glomeris maxilla. It may
therefore be the case that cells expressing Gm-wg in the
surrounding of the primordia signal to their neighbors
within the primordia and stimulate them to activate GmDll and Gm-H15. Minimally the activation of Dll appears
to be a general feature of appendicular sensory organs in
arthropods since Dll expression has been observed in
appendicular sensory organs in chelicerates, crustaceans,
myriapods and insects (e.g. [7,24,25,31]). Moreover, data
from Drosophila suggest that Dll expression is critically
required for sensory organ formation, as mutants lacking
Dll fail to develop Keilin's organs (the sensory structures
of the embryonic leg anlagen) [32,33].

Conclusions
The expression of Gm-wg and Gm-dpp during appendage
development indicates a role for both genes in guiding
this process. Involvement of wg and dpp in appendage
development appears to be conserved among all extant
arthropod classes including myriapods. The data from
Glomeris and other arthropods suggest that the WG/DPP
morphogen signaling system as it is known from Drosophila leg discs is present in all arthropods. However, this
morphogen system apparently functions in only the main
branch of the appendages, the so-called telopodite [34].
Limb types with additional branches (e.g. endites) obviously use additional, yet unidentified mechanisms to
organize proximal-distal growth of the extra branches.
Gene expression in potential endite homologs present in
Glomeris mouthparts supports this notion. Aside from the
role in PD axis formation, the expression profile of Gm-wg
suggests an additional role for this gene in patterning
appendicular sensory organs.

Methods
Animal stocks
Animals were collected during Spring 2003 in beech forests in the vicinity of Cologne, Germany and near Kranenburg, Germany. They have been treated as described
before [6,14]. The animals were released after the end of
the breeding season (Summer '03).
Molecular cloning
The cloning assays were based on cDNA transcribed from
polyA-RNA extracted from selected Glomeris embryos of
all developmental stages up to stage 6.1 (see [14,35] for a
description of embryonic stages) and were performed in
duplicate. For the amplification of dpp-like gene fragments, the primers dpp-fw-1 (GAY GTN GGN TGG GAY
GAY TGG) and dpp-bw-1 (CKR CAN CCR CAN CCN CAN
AC) were used in the initial PCR, and the primers dpp-fw2 (GGN TAY GAY GCN TAY TAY TG) and dpp-bw-1 were
used in the nested PCR. Additional sequence information
was gained by RACE PCR. No full-length fragment could
be obtained and several artificial clones were encountered, probably representing chimeric products resulting
from jumping PCR between different TGF-beta-like
cDNAs. Using species specific primers, artificial and genuine fragments were identified. A confirmed genuine fragment of almost 360 bp was isolated and cloned. This
fragment was used for sequence analysis and probe synthesis. The isolation of Gm-wg has been previously
reported [14]. The GenBank accession numbers are as follows: Gm-wg (AJ616907); Gm-dpp (AJ843875).
Alignments and sequence analysis
Pairwise alignments of aminoacid sequences were performed by searching GenBank [36] using the Gapped
BLAST program [37]. The alignments were calculated

based on the BLOSUM 62 matrix [38] (gap costs: 11 for
opening, 1 for extension). Multiple sequence alignments
were calculated based on the GONNET matrix [39] (gap
costs: 10 for opening, 0.2 for extension) implemented in
CLUSTAL_X [40]. The resulting alignments were subjected
to maximum likelihood analysis using the Quartet Puzzling method [41] as implemented in PAUP* 4.0b10 [42].
In situ hybridizations, specimen preparation and
microscopy
In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled RNA
probes has been performed as previously described [7].
Whole-mount embryos were photographed in PBST
under a Leica dissection microscope. Appendages were
dissected with fine insect needles and photographed in
50% glycerol under a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. All
images were corrected for color values, brightness and
contrast using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 for Apple Macintosh.
The image processing software has also been used to
enhance image backgrounds by retouching dirt or yolk
remains, and to group together single pictures into multipanel figures.
