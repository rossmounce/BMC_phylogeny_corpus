Abstract
Background: We earlier reported a simple specific test for detection of anti-ovarian antibodies in infertile women
and identified number of specific molecular and cellular targets of which human heat shock protein 90-beta
(HSP90 beta) was found to be the most immunodominant. The present study focuses on prediction and validation
of the immunodominant epitope/s of this protein using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90
autoantibodies.
Methods: Delineation of the immunodominant epitopes of HSP90 beta was done by using epitope prediction
algorithms and 10 peptides (EP1-EP10) were custom synthesized. Their immunoreactivity was measured by ELISA
using sera from patients and controls. To determine the most immunodominant epitope, the results were
subjected to statistical analysis. The immunoreactivity of the immunodominant peptides were confirmed by dot
blots using sera from patients. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the immunodominant epitope was generated
and its immunoreactivity to the parent protein in ovarian extracts as well in oocytes and embryos was investigated.
Results: Experimentally and statistically, peptide EP6 (380-389) seems to be the major antigenic epitope for the
serum antibody binding followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Predicted 3D structures of these peptides
demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation which is the most mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis
of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well conserved
motif. The polyclonal antibody generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and
cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients’ sera having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies.
Conclusions: The decapeptide EP6 is a major immunogenic epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 and EP8.
Knowledge of binding epitopes on the autoantigen is necessary to understand the subsequent pathologic events.
The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic
intervention.

Background
Autoimmune diseases remain among the most poorly
understood and recognized categories of illnesses in the
world [1]. For the last few decades it has been well established that the human ovary also undergoes an autoimmune attack, which is characterized by the development
of an anomalous immune response against various compartments of the organ [2,3]. Ovarian autoimmunity is

known to be manifested by individuals having polycystic
ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis and primary
ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian failures
(POF) [2,4]. Women enrolled in the in vitro fertilization –
embryo transfer (IVF-ET) program have also been shown
to have AOA and these have been correlated with poor
reproductive outcomes [5]. Though various causes such as
chromosomal, enzymatic, iatrogenic etc are known to
be involved in pathophysiological condition of POI, about
1% of the total cases are known to be caused due to autoimmunity [6]. These women exhibit a hypergonadotropic
- hypoestrogenic hormone profile and antiovarian antibodies (AOA) are detected in the sera of these women [2,4].

However, the involvement of other autoimmune disorders
along with POI cannot be completely ruled out as various
Systemic Lupus Erythromatosus, Graves’s disease, Addison’s disease also manifest POI [7].
Detection of these AOA has always remained a challenge for investigators as several published tests showed
presence of these AOA even in controls [8]. Until
recently there was no validated serum marker/s that
could establish a diagnosis of ovarian insufficiency with
certainty [9]. The specificity of the existing AOA tests
has been questioned because of its false positive results.
Our group has been successful in establishing a simple
and specific diagnostic test to detect AOA in women
with infertility [10]. We were able to demonstrate true
AOA status in these women using our novel blocking
approach and were able to identify several new molecular and cellular targets [11]. It was observed that the target antigens range between 30-150 kDa, of which a
90 kDa protein was shown to be the immunodominant
antigen. High throughput proteomic analysis (LC/MS
and MS/MS) revealed the identity of the protein to be
human heat shock protein 90 beta (HSP90b) [12]. Involvement of anti-HSP90 antibodies in pathogenesis of several diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus [13],
rheumatoid arthritis [14], osteocarcinoma [15] and ovarian cancer [16] has been reported. However, we were
the first ones to demonstrate the presence of antiHSP90b antibodies in women with infertility [12].
Having established this, we embarked upon identification of the immunodominant epitopes of HSP90b, knowing the fact that the whole protein by itself is unlikely to
be antigenic. We did this by using epitope prediction
algorithms and then confirmed them by wet-lab experiments using the sera from infertile women having autoantibody to HSP90 and normal fertile individuals who
served as controls. Epitoimmunomics is a relatively
upcoming branch of modern day biology and epitopic
peptides are long known as highly versatile molecules for
a variety of biological and immunological applications.
Unlike proteins which unfold readily and subsequently
loose their activities or in which the active antigenic
components lie buried in its 3D structure making it inaccessible to the immune system; peptides are preferred
choice as they are functionally quite stable, making them
suitable molecules for facile and robust screening assays
[17]. Synthetic peptides mimicking epitopes, as well as
anti-peptide antibodies, have many applications in the
diagnosis of various human diseases [18,19]. Also,
attempts have been made to develop peptide based synthetic prophylactic vaccines for various infections, as well
as therapeutic vaccines for chronic infections and noninfectious diseases, including autoimmune diseases, neurological disorders, allergies, and cancers [20]. The majority
of available epitope prediction methods focus on

Page 2 of 13

continuous epitopes due to the convenience of the investigation in which the amino acid sequence of a protein is
taken as the input. Such in silico prediction methods are
based upon the amino acid properties including hydrophilicity [21,22], solvent accessibility [23], secondary
structure [24], flexibility [25] and antigenicity [26].
In the present study we predicted, identified, characterized and validated the antibody binding regions of
HSP90b using (a) Bioinformatics and (b) sera from
infertile women having these auto-antibodies. Identification of epitopic peptides targeted by autoantibodies will
facilitate development of sensitive assays for diagnosis of
autoimmune diseases. Also, important insights into the
pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders can be gathered by characterizing the epitopes targeted by these
antibodies.

Methods
Study groups

The study was approved by the Institute’s clinical ethics
committee and informed written consent was obtained
from the participants. Briefly, women with POI and infertile women enrolled for IVF-ET constituted the study
groups (discussed in detail in [12]). Referring physicians
made the diagnosis of POI based on the following criteria: onset of amenorrhea (for at least 4-6 months)
before attaining the age of 40 years and high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels > 40 IU/liter (estimated twice at least 1 month apart). Women who
developed POI as a result of surgery or radiation/chemotherapy, those having a genetic involvement, abnormal karyotypes, infections/viral oophoritis, or
galactosemia-induced POI were excluded from the study.
The inclusion criteria for patient selection in the IVF-ET
program were those women who were less than 40 years
of age at the time of enrollment in the study presenting
with infertility and for whom IVF-ET had been determined to be the next treatment for conception. These
women had a normal baseline pelvic ultrasound examination and a normal uterine cavity. Patients with the following conditions were excluded from the study: those
who had pelvic surgery within the past 8 weeks, including
appendicitis or uterine or ovarian surgery, excluding
diagnostic laparoscopy; those who had clinical evidence
of pelvic inflammatory disease within the past 3 months
and who were treated for any viral infection; endometriosis; women who had submucous or intramural fibroids of
any size and women who had hydrosalpinx and had polycystic ovary syndrome. None of the patients’ had been
treated for any form of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid or adrenal autoimmunity and diabetes mellitus. Sera were collected from
64 women having anti-HSP90 antibodies and 40 proven
fertile healthy women (22-34 years old). All these control

Pires et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:16
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/16

women were parents and had no previous history of irregular menses nor were treated for any autoimmune disease. None of the controls showed the presence of AOA.
Animals

Inbred Belgium white adult rabbits and Swiss mice were
housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-hr
light cycle. All animal care practices and experimental
procedures complied with the guidelines of the Care
and Prevention Society against Cruelty of Experimental
Animals (CPSCEA) on animal care and were approved
by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee.
Western blotting

In brief, 10 μg of commercially available human ovarian
extract (Clontech, USA) / 40 μg mice ovarian extract
were separated on a 10% gel by electrophoresis at 80 V
for 3 h [27] and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, USA) using an electro blotting
apparatus (BioRad Labs, Richmond, CA, USA) at 80 V
for 2 h [28]. The individual lanes were blocked for 1 h
at room temperature with 5 g% non-fat dry milk
(Nakoda, India) in phosphate buffered saline (NFDMPBS). The blots were incubated overnight at 4°C with
polyclonal antibodies to HSP90a and HSP90b (Millipore, USA) diluted 1:200 in PBS. Monoclonal antibody
to GAPDH (Calbiochem, USA) was used at a dilution of
1 in 6000 in PBS and served as a loading control to the
same blots. Following day, the membrane strips were
washed with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma, USA) in PBS
and incubated with swine anti rabbit HRP and rabbit
anti mouse HRP diluted in 1% NFDM-PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Strips were then
washed as described above. Detection was done using
enhanced chemiluminescence plus (ECL) kit (GE
Healthcare, USA) as per the standard protocol.
Prediction of antigenic peptides using in silico tools

The antibody epitope prediction tool available at IEDB
analysis resource [29] was used to identify the putative
epitopes of the protein. Two algorithms i.e. Kolaskar
and Tongaonkar antigenicity [26] and Bepipred linear
epitope prediction [30] methods were selected for this
purpose. Ten putative epitopes were short listed based
on the following criteria: a) They should either have an
overlap of predicted antigenic regions as per the 2 algorithms or in cases where the predicted sites are adjacent
to each other the epitopes selected were in the regions
harboring predicted sites as per the above two algorithms; b) The physicochemical parameters (viz. hydrophobicity, flexibility, surface accessibility) are suggestive
of a putative epitope [31]. In order to avoid nonspecific
antibody reactions, the 10 putative epitopes were
checked for sequence similarities with proteins

deposited in the NCBI database. The online BLASTP
tool available at NCBI [32] was used for the database
search of these peptides. Multiple sequence alignment
was carried out using CLUSTALW2 program of EBI
[33] to understand the conservation of the predicted
epitopes of the protein across various species for which
the sequence information is available at NCBI. PyMOL
[34] was used for visualization of the 3D structures of
the predicted epitopes and rendering the molecular
images.
Peptide synthesis

Based on the epitope prediction algorithm, 10 peptides
(labeled as EP1 to EP10) were shortlisted and were custom
synthesized by solid-phase synthesis using Fmoc chemistry.
These analytical grade peptides (99% purity) were then
conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) linker.
Synthesis and conjugation of the 10 peptides was done at a
commercial facility of US Vitamins Ltd., Mumbai.
Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)

Ninety six well microtitre plate (Nunc, Denmark) were
coated with the 10 KLH-conjugated HSP90b peptides in
individual wells at a concentration of 1 μg using carbonate- bicarbonate coating buffer, pH 9.6, by incubating at
4°C overnight. Excess solution was flicked off the next
day and modules were washed with PBS containing
0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma, USA). Nonspecific binding
sites were blocked with 5 g% NFDM in PBS, for 1 hr at
room temperature. Patient and control sera in duplicates
were added to the wells and incubated at 4°C overnight.
A ‘no primary antibody’ served as negative control where
sera were replaced by equal volume of PBS. Unbound
antibodies were removed off by washing wells 4 times
with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (Sigma, USA).
Suitably diluted (1: 1000) goat anti human HRP labeled
secondary antibody (Sigma, USA) in 1 g% (w/v) NFDM
in PBS was added and incubated at 37°C for 1h. The
wells were then washed as described above and the
immunoreactivity was visualized using o-phenylene diamine / H2O2 (Sigma, USA) prepared in substrate buffer.
Reaction was stopped by adding 4N H2SO4 (Qualigens,
India) and optical density was measured at 492 nm on a
titreteck multiscan plate reader (Biotek, USA).
Calculations and statistical analysis

The immunodominant epitope was determined by calculating the % change of the absorbance values for each
of the peptides using the calculation: % change in absorbance = [(mean absorbance of patient – mean absorbance of control) / mean absorbance in control] x 100.
A higher increase in the percent change in absorbance
value corresponds to higher antigenicity of the peptide.
The cut off range for positivity towards a peptide was

Pires et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:16
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/16

set as per the statistics note described by Altman and
Bland [35] and Jeffoate [36]. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software (Chicago, IL) version 11.
The results generated from the ELISA data showed a
skewed representation and for this reason we preferably
selected to quote the two outer centiles such as the 80th
centile of controls and 20th centile of patients to represent the data. We ranked the absorbance values from the
controls in order of the increasing absorbance readings.
The kth centile (q) is obtained using the calculation q = k
(n + 1) / 100; where k – the desired centile and n- the
total number of samples screened.
Dot blot analysis

1 μg of individual un-conjugated peptides were dotted
on nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to adhere for
at least 2 h at 37°C before blocking for 1 h at room
temperature in 5 g% NFDM-PBS. Patient sera testing
positive in ELISA or control sera diluted five fold were
added to the strip and incubated at 4°C overnight.
Dotted membrane with no primary antibody served as
‘negative control’. Following day the membranes were
washed with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS and then incubated with suitably diluted (1: 100,000) goat anti human
HRP labeled secondary antibody (SIGMA, USA) in 1 g%
(w/v) NFDM-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed as described above. Detection
was done using enhanced chemiluminescence plus
(ECL) kit (GE Healthcare, USA) as per the standard
protocol.
Production of polyclonal antibody to immunodominant
peptide EP6

Prior to immunization sufficient pre immune blood was
collected through the marginal ear vein of the rabbit.
The serum was separated and stored at -20°C till further
use. Immunization protocol was carried out as described
earlier [10] with slight modifications.
Briefly, 100 μg of peptide EP6 conjugated to KLH was
dissolved in 1ml of 0.01 M PBS pH 7.4, and mixed with
equal volume of Freund’s complete adjuvant (SIGMA,
USA) and injected subcutaneously at approximately 30
sites. Two boosters at an interval of 15 days were given
using Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (SIGMA, USA) and
post immune serum was collected 10 days after the last
booster, stored as aliquots at –20°C. This post immune
serum containing the anti- EP6 peptide antibody was
used for subsequent experiments.
Immunochemical characterization of the polyclonal
antibody to peptide EP6
Dot blot analysis

The immunoreactivity of the rabbit sera post immunization with the dominant EP6 peptide was checked for its

Page 4 of 13

specificity by dot blot at a dilution of 1:50 using the
same protocol with appropriate reagents as described
earlier in this section.
Western blot analysis

In brief, 160 ng of recombinant human HSP90 protein
(rhHSP90) (Calbiochem, USA) and 40 μg of mice ovarian protein were separated on a 10% gel by electrophoresis as described earlier in this section. The individual
lanes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5g
% (w/v) NFDM-PBS. Pre-immune (serum of animal
prior to injecting the peptide, serves as a true negative
control) and post-immune rabbit sera diluted fifty fold
with blocking buffer were added to the strip and incubated at 4°C overnight. Following day the membrane
strips were washed with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS
and then incubated with suitably diluted (1: 3,000)
swine anti rabbit HRP labeled secondary antibody
(Dako, Germany) in 1 g% (w/v) NFDM-PBS for 1 h at
room temperature. Strips were then washed as described
above. Detection was done using enhanced chemiluminescence plus (ECL) kit (GE Healthcare, USA) as per
the standard protocol.
Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)

Adult Swiss female mice were injected intraperitonealy
with 10 IU pregnant mare serumgonadotropin (PMSG)
(Sigma, USA) to stimulate follicular development and 48 h
later with 10 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
(Bharat Serum, India) to induce ovulation. 16 to 18 h after
hCG injection, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and oocytes were harvested from the oviducts. For
collection of embryos, females were bred singly to proven
fertile mature male mice immediately after the hCG injection and checked for a vaginal plug the following morning.
Embryos were flushed from the oviducts of plug positive
females at different time points for 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell and
morula. The oocytes / embryos were fixed in 4% (w/v)
para-formaldehyde for 15 min at 4°C. Further, these were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 10 minutes. Blocking was carried out using 5% (v/v) normal
swine serum (NSS) (Dako, Germany) made in 5 g% (w/v)
Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma, USA) in PBS for 1 hr at
room temperature. The oocytes and embryos were incubated with pre-immune and post-immune sera diluted
fifty fold in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C in a moist
chamber. Next day, three washes in PBS for 5 min each
were given and a secondary antibody swine anti rabbit
FITC conjugate diluted two hundred fold in PBS (Dako,
Germany) was added onto the slides and incubated for 1
hr at room temperature. Cells were counterstained with
0.1% (w/v) DAPI (Roche, USA) which was added along
with secondary antibody. Excess antibody and dye were
removed by washing thrice with PBS for 5 min each. Slides
were mounted on prolong gold antifade (Molecular
Probes, USA) and immunostaining was observed under

Confocal microscope at 640X magnification (Carl Zeiss,
Germany).

Results
HSP90b is the predominant isoform present in ovarian
extracts

Our earlier LC-MS/ MS-MS observation revealed
HSP90b to be the major immunodominant target
involved in ovarian autoimmunity [12] which is also
supported by the Western blot as shown in Figure 1A,
which clearly demonstrates the predominance of the
beta isoform of HSP90 in human ovarian protein
extracts (lane 1). No immunoreactivity to the 90 kDa
locus was seen when the strip was probed with HSP90a
polyclonal antibody (lane 2), thereby suggesting HSP90b
to be the predominant isoform in human ovary. Mouse
testes extract was used as a positive control for HSP90a
(lane 3). A ‘no primary’ control showed no immunoreactivity to any of the ovarian proteins (lane 4). GAPDH
served as an equal loading control.
Putative epitopes of human HSP90b were predicted using
in silico methods

In silicostudies were conducted to predict the antigenic
peptides of HSP90b and 10 putative epitopes, namely
EP1-EP10 were selected. Figure 1B is a ClustualW2
alignment mapping of the 10 predicted peptides (EP1EP10). The start and end position of the peptides has
been marked in this figure. BLASTP algorithm of all the
10 peptides revealed that they occur with 100% identity
only in the heat shock proteins of 90 kDa family and
hence there was no possibility of getting nonspecific
antibody reactions with these peptides.
Peptide immunoreactivity was validated with HSP90
positive AOA sera
Peptide immunoreactivity was measured by ELISA

The immunoreactivity of the sera from controls and
from women having HSP90 autoantibody (patients n =
64 and controls n = 40) were tested and measured
against all the 10 peptides by ELISA. The values
obtained have been plotted on the scatter plot as shown
in Figure 2. The increase in % change of the mean
absorbance between patients and controls was calculated
for each of the peptides. Also, the baseline cut off range
for each of the peptide was calculated using 80th centile
of the control in the centile distribution statistical
analysis.
The immunoreactivity of all the sera against the peptide EP6 was found to be above the baseline readings
from controls. In addition to this it was seen that all 64
antibody positive patient’s sera showed significant
immunoreactivity to EP6 peptide. Also, as shown in
Table 1, it is apparent that of all the 10 peptides EP6

Page 5 of 13

demonstrated the highest increase in % change in absorbance yielding a + 69% increase in score. The increase
in positive % change in absorbance designates the peptide to be more immunogenic than the others. Following
EP6, EP1 demonstrated a + 54% and EP8 demonstrated
a + 17% increase change. EP10 and EP3 showed a + 8%
increase change. EP2, EP4 and EP7 showed no %
increase change, peptides EP5 and EP9 demonstrated a
decrease in % change values. In view of our statistical
analysis, our data clearly indicates that epitope EP6
seems to be the major antigen binding region for the
patients’ serum having HSP90 autoantibodies followed
by peptides EP1 and EP8.
Validation of the peptide immunoreactivity by dot blot

Findings from dot blot analysis have been represented in
Figure 3 panels (A, B and C) depict the immunoreactivity of patient’s sera testing positive in ELISA with EP6,
EP1 and EP8 dotted peptides respectively. Of all the 10
peptides screened by us, these 3 peptides were found to
be the most immunodominant targets by the patient’s
sera. Panel (D) shows no immunoreactivity to any of the
10 peptides when the dot blot was probed with sera
from normal fertile controls. Panel (E) demonstrates no
involvement of secondary antibody towards any of the
10 peptides. The same panel also shows recombinant
HSP90 protein reactivity with monoclonal to it, serving
as positive control (Panel F1). SP2/0 myeloma culture
supernatant was used as negative control for panel F1
(Panel F2). Panel (G and H) shows no immunoreactivity
to 2 unrelated peptides of Prostate Secreted Protein 94 PSP94 using both patient and control sera respectively,
thereby confirming the specificity of the autoantibodies
to HSP90b peptides.
Immunochemical characterization of rabbit polyclonal
antibodies to the immunodominant peptide EP6

Having established the fact that EP6 is the immunodominant peptide target by the patient’s sera we characterized this antigen to confirm its similarity with the native
HSP90b protein. For this we raised a polyclonal antibody which was used for characterization by dot blot,
Western blot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence.
Figure 4 (Panel A) shows the immunoreactivity seen
with the post-immune rabbit sera against the 10 peptides in a dot blot analysis. The polyclonal antibody
reacts specifically to peptide EP6 (dot blot marked 6).
The pre-immune serum of the same rabbit did not
show any reactivity to any of the 10 peptides (EP1 to
EP10 labeled as 1 to 10 in order) thus demonstrating
the specificity of anti peptide EP6 antibody.
It is very essential that the anti-peptide antibodies produced and raised to the peptide not only reacts to the
peptide with which it was immunized but also shows
immunoreactivity to the native protein. In Figure 4, a

HSP90a antibody (lane 2). Mouse testicular extracts were used as positive control for the HSP90a antibody (lane 3). ‘No primary/ secondary
alone’ antibodies served as negative control (lane 4). Antibody to GAPDH served as loading control to ensure equal amounts of protein per lane.

Figure 2 EP6 is an immunodominant peptide of HSP90b. Epitopic peptides were selected by the epitope prediction algorithm by KolaskarTongaonkar and Bepipred. These peptides were then custom synthesized using Fmoc chemistry and used in ELISA. The figure depicts the
immunoreactivity of sera from infertile women with the 10 peptides. The solid horizontal bar indicates the 80th centile of controls. Values above
the bar indicate a positive immunoreactivity to that peptide and values below or on the bar depicts poor or no immunoreactivity. Peptide EP6
shows strong immunoreactivity with all the 64 sera tested in ELISA with no values falling below or on the bar. All outliers i.e. sera showing
absorbance values of 2 and above were not used in statistical analysis and calculations to avoid ambiguity of results.

Higher the value in the % increase in change of the absorbance, greater is the indication of the peptide to be the immunodominant epitope for that protein.
Peptides giving a negative value (decrease change or no change) are not good candidates to be used as markers. Of all the 10 peptides, EP6 ranked first and
showed the highest increase in % change in absorbance followed by EP1 and EP8.

specific immunostaining at the 90 kDa region constituting the region of rhHSP90 protein was seen when the
blot was probed with anti-EP6 peptide antibody (Panel
B2) while preimmune rabbit serum showed no immunoreactivity (Panel B1). The post-immune sera also
identified a single band at the 90 kDa region using a
total ovarian extract in Western blotting (Panel C, lane
Post) thereby confirming that the anti-peptide antibody
not only reacts to the peptide with which it is immunized but also recognizes the recombinant HSP90 protein and the native molecule in the mice ovarian extract.
The pre-immune serum (lane Pre) did not show any
immunoreactivity.

Discussion
Heat shock proteins are ubiquitous, phylogenetically
conserved stress proteins which are known to have an
important role in stress survival. Heat shock protein 90
is a hub in developmental regulatory networks. This
protein plays a key role in various cellular processes as
seen in the post translational maturation of proteins
such as steroid hormone receptors, protein kinases and
helix-loop-helix transcription factors [37]. Amongst all

the molecular chaperones HSP90 is the most common
one and apart from its chaperoning function in the cell,
this dynamic molecule is involved in many cellular and
pathophysiological processes such as maintenance of
cytoarchitecture, differentiation and cytoprotection [38].
Approximately 1% of the total cellular proteome is constituted by this complex protein and it plays a critical
role both in its normal function as a chaperone as well
as its response to cellular stress. These unique properties of the protein render it to be of evolutionary significance and thus make it a well conserved protein right
from prokaryotes. HSP90 comprises of 2 distinct isoforms: HSP90a and HSP90b which are encoded by 2
different genes at 14q 32-33 and 6p21 loci respectively.
Though 85% similar, the isoform specificity is not only
restricted to the biochemical level but it also extends to
the functional role of HSP90 in cell differentiation and
development [38]. Apart from its dogmatic role as a
molecular chaperone, the isoform HSP90b is also
known to be functionally important in reproduction.
Using 2D proteomics and MS/MS, it was found that,
among the hundreds of proteins that are expressed by
the membrane of mammalian oocyte, HSP90 is one of

Page 9 of 13

the abundant proteins present on the oolemmal membrane of mouse eggs [39]. They demonstrated that
HSP90 was primarily localized to the membrane’ microvillar region of normal mouse eggs. Overexpression of
HSP90b is observed throughout the germ-cell lineage
from very early stages of development to adult oocytes
and spermatocytes, thus establishing the important role
of HSP90b in reproduction [40]. Studies have also
shown that HSP90b isoform plays a major role in trophoblast differentiation and HSP90b -deficient homozygous mice fails to differentiate to form placental
labyrinths [41].
In our previous report, we demonstrated the presence
of anti-HSP90b antibodies in women with POI and
repeated IVF-ET failure [12]. We verified the presence
or absence of isoform specific HSP90 in ovarian extracts
by Western Blot analysis and found that HSP90b is the
predominant isoform present in the human ovarian
extracts (Figure 1A). Having established this, we
embarked on identifying, characterizing and validating
the epitope/s of HSP90b using sera of infertile patients
having these auto-antibodies.
The human HSP90b protein as documented in SwissProt is a 724 amino acids long constitutive cellular protein, which gets processed to a 723 amino acids long
protein, by removal of its initiator methionine [42].
Based on the epitope prediction algorithms, 10 peptides
of the beta isoform of HSP90 (labeled as EP1 to EP10)
were shortlisted and were custom synthesized by solidphase synthesis using Fmoc chemistry. The reactivity of
these peptides with the sera of patients having HSP90
autoantibody and controls was checked and measured
by ELISA. To determine the most immunodominant
epitope we calculated the change in percent absorbance
of all the 10 peptides and found that, EP6 demonstrated
the highest change in percent absorbance followed by
EP1 and EP8.
Structure analyses of these 3 immunodominant peptides reveal that they are surface exposed and hence
accessible to the auto-antibody. The structure of the
first 220 residues of human HSP90 has been experimentally elucidated [43]. Although peptide EP1 (1-12) lies in
this region (Figure 1B), the structural coordinates are
missing for the first 15 residues. In order to predict the
structural features of EP6 and EP8, the protein structure
database (PDB) was searched using the BLAST algorithm [44] which revealed that yeast HSP90 shared an
identity of 62% and was the best template for predicting
the structures of EP6 and EP8. The pairwise alignment
of human HSP90b and yeast HSP90 showed that EP6
peptide shared 100% identity and EP8 peptide showed
an identity match for 5 of its 11 residues (Figure 6A).
EP6 was the most immunodominant antigenic decapeptide (VVDSEDLPLN) spanning the region 380-389 and

human HSP90b (SwissProt Accession No: P08238) and yeast HSP90 (PDB ID: 2CG9). The regions of the predicted epitopes in the alignment are
highlighted in boxes. Panel (B) The structural coordinates are missing for the EP1 peptide. The structure of yeast HSP90 (PDB ID: 2CG9) has been
used to represent the structures of peptides EP6 and EP8. The predicted antigenic regions are colored based on their secondary structures.
Helices, strands and loops are colored green, blue and pink respectively. Panel (C) shows the conservation of the 3 putative dominant peptides
across various species. It can be clearly seen that peptide EP6 is highly conserved antigen in all the species and therefore is one of the potential
immune targets of HSP90b. The structures were rendered using the online algorithm PyMOL.

Pires et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:16
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/16

is shown to be highly conserved across most species
(Figure 6C); even its most distant relative, the HSP90 of
E.coli exhibits sequence identity with 7 of the 10 residues of EP6 peptide. The four known important determinants of B-cell epitopes are surface accessibility,
hydrophilicity, flexibility of the conformations and the
presence of secondary structures such as beta-turns
[45]. Cursory analysis of the sequences of peptides EP1,
EP6 and EP8 reveal that they are abundant in hydrophilic and charged amino acids like Asp, Glu and Lys (Figure 1B). The 3D structures of peptides EP6 and EP8
reveal that the major fractions of their residues are present in the loop conformation (Figure 6B). Loops are
the most mobile part of the protein structure. Since the
complete structure of human HSP90 has not been
experimentally elucidated, it is difficult to precisely comment on the surface accessibility of the residues in these
peptides. However, since loop conformations are
observed predominantly on the surface rather than the
protein interior [46] and together with the highly polar
and hydrophilic nature of these peptides, it can be safely
predicted that these regions (EP1, EP6 and EP8) in the
native protein will be accessible to the anti- HSP90 antibodies in circulation.
The presence of autoantibodies to HSP90 has been
reported in the human natural antibody repertoire [47].
Thus, to rule out the false positive results arising from
such a finding and to determine the cut off value for
each of the 10 peptides, the ELISA data obtained was
statistically analyzed and we quoted the two outer centiles such as the 80th centile of controls and 20th centile
of patients to represent the data. Further, to determine
the most immunodominant peptide, we calculated the
change in percent absorbance of each of the peptide and
found that of all the peptides, EP6 shows a significant
increase in the percent change in absorbance between
patients and controls. Thus, further validation and characterization were carried out using EP6 peptide. A polyclonal antibody to this peptide was raised and its
reactivity was checked by Western Blot and immunofluorescence. It was found that the EP6 peptide polyclonal antibody not only recognizes the native protein in
the mice ovarian extracts (Figure 4) but also exhibits
similar immunostaining pattern with the oocyte and
embryos (Figure 5) as was observed by a similar staining
pattern by HSP90 autoantibody positive patient sera in
our earlier study [12].
AOA are associated with poorer treatment outcomes
in infertility patients. It has been shown by researchers
that AOA could reduce fertilization rates, generate a
poor response to gonadotropin stimulation, decrease
pregnancy rates, affect egg and embryo development
and could be responsible for implantation failures
[48,49]. Knowing the AOA status in the infertile women

Page 11 of 13

and planning appropriate immunosuppressive therapy
would not only ensure the effectiveness of the IVF-ET
but also reduce the time invested by the clinician and
the cost to be incurred by the patients and thereby
restore fertility [50].
The precise mechanism of anti-HSP90 antibody
related inhibition of embryo development and ovarian
failure has not been reported. Recent reports have suggested that the penetration of autoantibodies into living
cells participate in the pathogenesis of diverse autoimmune diseases. For instance, autoantibodies to HSP27,
which are found in patients with glaucoma, have been
shown to penetrate into human retinal neuronal cells
and induce their active death, most likely by inactivating
the ability of HSP27 to stabilize actin cytoskeleton thus
suggesting a pathogenic role of these antibodies [51].
Also, there are increasing evidences to suggest the presence of HSP90 on the cell surface [39,52,53] thereby
making it accessible to the autoantibodies. Thus, mere
presence of these autoantibodies in the circulation may
not only bring detrimental effects by evading the surface
HSP90 but they can also get internalized into the cell
and destroy the ovarian cytoarchitecture.
Till date there are no reports on the clinical effect of
circulatory anti-HSP90 antibodies. A group demonstrated that inclusion of anti-HSP90 antibodies in cell
culture medium exerted a detrimental effect on mouse
embryo development and thus concluded that immune
sensitization to heat shock proteins may be a cause of
reproductive failure [54]. Studies have shown that
HSP90b isoform plays a major role in trophoblast differentiation [41]. Also, in our earlier study we have demonstrated that patient’s sera having autoantibody to HSP90
exhibits reactivity with the cells of developing embryo as
well as the cells of the trophectoderm of the invading
blastocyst which is the region known to form the placenta [12]. In the present study we confirmed the same
observations using polyclonal antibodies to EP6 peptide.
Thus, by virtue of its reactivity with oocytes and early
developmental stages the mere presence of these autoantibodies would have detrimental effect on early stages
of embryonic development and possibly leading to a
pregnancy failure. However, the precise mechanism of
anti-HSP90 antibody related inhibition of embryo development and ovarian failure has not been reported and
needs to be investigated.

Conclusions
The present study conclusively demonstrates that peptide EP6 of HSP90b is a major immunogenic epitope
and thus is an ideal candidate marker for the protein.
The ELISA clearly indicates that of all the 10 peptides,
this is the only peptide which shows immunoreactivity
with all of the 64 HSP90b positive patients’ sera.

Pires et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2011, 9:16
http://www.rbej.com/content/9/1/16

The data also indicates that in addition to peptide EP6,
other peptides such as EP1 and EP8 could also serve as
potential epitopes. Identification and validation of protein epitopes can in the long run be of immense importance when quick, specific and sensitive
immunodiagnostics are developed for screening patients
with autoimmune diseases. Understanding of binding
epitopes on the protein molecules is necessary to understand the pathophysiological events of a disease. The
study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention. Thus, it seems important to determine the
epitopes of HSP90, such as those defined in this study,
which are involved in responses of autoimmune diseases. Studies addressing these issues are of our importance and work towards this direction is underway.
