Abstract
Background: The Central Asian Strain1 (CAS1) genogroup of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the
most prevalent in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable
number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing is a reliable and reproducible method for differentiation of
MTB isolates. However, information of its utility in determining the diversity of CAS1 strain is limited. We
performed standard 12 loci based MIRU-VNTR typing on previously spoligotyped CAS1 strains and
'unique' strains in order to evaluate its discriminatory power for these isolates.
Methods: Twelve loci based MIRU- VNTR typing was used to type178 CAS1 and 189 'unique' MTB
strains. The discriminatory index for each of the loci was calculated using the Hunter Gaston
Discriminatory Index (HGDI). A subset of these strains (n = 78) were typed using IS6110 restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). MIRU-VNTR profiles were studied together with their drug
susceptibility patterns.
Results: A total of 349 MIRU patterns were obtained for the 367 strains tested. The CAS1 strains were
subdivided into 160 distinct patterns; 15 clusters of 2 strains each, 1 cluster of four strains and 144 unique
patterns. Using HGDI, seven MIRU loci, (numbers 26, 31, 27, 16, 10, 39, and 40) were found to be "highly
discriminatory" (DI: ≥0.6), four MIRU loci (numbers 20, 24, 23, and 4) were "moderately discriminatory"
(DI: 0.3–0.59), and one locus (number 2) was "poorly discriminatory" (DI< 0.3). Loci 26 and 31 were the
most discriminatory for the CAS1 isolates. Amongst 'unique' strains in addition to loci 26, 31, 27, 16, 10,
39, and 40, locus 23 was highly discriminatory, while no locus was poorly discriminating. DI values for loci
4, 10 and 26 were significantly lower (P-value < .01) in CAS1 strains than in 'unique' strains. The association
between CAS1 strains and MDR was not found to be significant (p value = 0.21).
Conclusion: We propose that MIRU typing could be used to estimate the phylogenetic relatedness
amongst prevalent CAS1 strains, for which MIRU loci 26, 31, 16, 10, 27, 39 and 40 were found to be the
most discriminatory.

Background
Pakistan, together with other Asian countries including;
China, India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, shares over 50
percent of the global burden of the tuberculosis (TB) cases
[1,2]. Pakistan ranks sixth amongst the 22 high burden TB
disease countries [1], with an estimated incidence rate of
171/100,000 population. Despite this the TB burden is an
underestimated figure as many cases in the country go
unreported due to lack of access to health care facility,
over crowding, poverty and other social constraints.
The high incidence of tuberculosis in Pakistan is further
compounded by the increasing emergence of drug resistant strains including multi-drug resistant (MDR: resistant
to at least Rifampicin and Isoniazid) strains. The global
prevalence of MDR is estimated at 3% [3-5]. However
China, Iran and India report MDR-TB at 4.5%, 5% and
3.4% respectively [5]. While community based data from
Pakistan is currently not available, laboratory based studies from urban Rawalpindi showed an increasing frequency of MDR from 14% in 1999 to 28% in 2004 [6]
and a study from a tertiary care center in Karachi documented 47% MDR-TB prevalence [7].
Key factors required for effective control of TB are rapid
detection, adequate therapy and a better understanding of
TB epidemiology to understand the transmission patterns
of the disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the main
causative agent of TB has an overall genomic similarity of
99.9% [8,9]. There is moreover increasing evidence that
specific genetic differences within MTB may be associated
with geographical locations [10-14]. Thus studies of the
genetic diversity of MTB in a high burden country such as
Pakistan are required in order to provide insight into dissemination dynamics and virulence pattern of the pathogen.

number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) is based on detection of independent mini satellite like loci scattered
through out the MTB genome and has been shown to be
a reliable and reproducible typing method with high discriminatory power [26-29] for studying the MTB population structure in different countries [28,30]. The typed
strains are expressed by a 12-digit numerical code, corresponding to the number of repeats at each locus [31,32].
This numerical code is easy to compare and exchange at
inter-, and intra-laboratory level. The discriminatory
power of MIRU-VNTR analysis is proportional to the
number of loci evaluated. In general, the discriminatory
power of standard twelve loci based typing only slightly
lower than that of the IS6110 based restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP), which is currently the gold
standard for MTB genotyping [29].
Twelve loci based MIRU-VNTR analysis has been used in
a number of molecular epidemiologic studies and to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship of clinical isolates
[28,30,33-35]. It has also been used to study Beijing
strains from East and South Asia [27,36-40]. Available
data for MIRU-VNTR typing for MTB in Pakistan is limited
to one report wherein five exact tandem repeat (ETR) were
used to type 113 MTB isolates from Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
This showed clustering of one third of the isolates, which
were further discriminated by an IS6110 based analysis
[25].
In this study we have used standard 12 MIRU-VNTR loci
typing to identify the alleles most discriminatory for CAS1
as compared with 'unique' spoligotypes within MTB
strains selected from different geographical location in
Pakistan. We have also determined the association of
these strains with MDR.

Results
Genotyping methods such as PCR based spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) have facilitated differentiation of MTB isolates into predominant genogroups
including, the Beijing family of strains and Central Asian
Strain1 (CAS1). We have reported CAS1 strains lacking
spacers 4–7 and 23–34 to be the most prevalent (39%) in
Pakistan [15]. CAS1 has also been reported as the second
most predominant group in South Asia; India (16–22%)
and Bangladesh (17%) [15-18]. Whilst, Beijing strains
lacking spacers 1–34 are the most widely reported genotype world wide [19,20] and the most prevalent genotype
in East Asia and Russia (40–60%) [21-24], they constitute
only 6% of MTB isolates in Pakistan [15]. Despite the predominance of CAS1 in South Asia, there is limited data
related to its transmission and drug resistance [25]. Spoligotyping while instrumental in identifying MTB genogroups is unable to help discriminate amongst them.
Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units variable

MIRU typing for the predominant CAS1 genogroup and
'unique' strains from Pakistan
The twelve loci MIRU-VNTR analysis detected a total of
349 MIRU patterns in our sample size of 367 strains (Fig
1). The 178 strains of the CAS1 genogroup were found to
be more than 70 % homologous, but were further divided
into 160 distinct patterns comprising of; 15 clusters of two
strains each, 1 cluster of four strains and with 144 nonmatching patterns. The 189 strains previously identified
by spoligotyping as 'unique' [15] remained unclustered
after MIRU analysis. The distribution of the MIRU alleles
is summarized in Table 1.
Allelic diversity
Allelic diversity of clinical isolates was determined by
twelve MIRU loci analysis using the Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI). Overall, MIRU-VNTR typing
of 367 MTB strains indicated a discriminatory power of

0.999. Diversity of CAS1 (n: 178) and 'unique' (n: 189)
strains was further calculated separately (Table 1 and 2).
Allelic analysis of 178 CAS1 strains showed a HGDI of
0.998.
Allelic diversity for each locus was calculated in order to
determine the discriminatory power of these loci in a
combined group for the MTB population studied. Overall,
the average allelic diversity of loci studied in these strains
was found to be 0.6394 (Table 1). Based on their discriminatory index (DI), seven MIRU loci 10, 16, 26, 27, 31, 39
and 40 were designated as "highly discriminant" (DI ≥
0.6). While, MIRU loci 2, 4, 20, 23 and 24 were designated
as "moderately discriminant" (0.3 ≤ DI ≤ 0.6) [28]. In our
MTB population locus 26 was found to be the most discriminatory allele in order to distinguish between CAS1
strains and 'unique' spoligotypes. Locus 26 provided a 10
allelic discrimination with a HGDI of 0.833. This was followed by loci 16, 10, 31, 40, 39 and 27 respectively in
order of decreasing discrimination. Locus 4 was found to
be the least discriminatory with 7 alleles and a HGDI of
0.367.
As shown in Table 2, the average allelic diversity of CAS1
strains was found to be 0.6419. Of these, seven MIRU loci,
numbers 26, 31, 27, 16, 10, 39, and 40, were "highly discriminant" (DI: ≥ 0.6); four MIRU loci, 20, 24, 23, and 4
were "moderately discriminant" (DI: 0.3–0.59); while
locus number 4 was "poorly discriminant" (DI< 0.3) for
CAS1 isolates.
The average allelic diversity of 'unique' strains was found
to be 0.6339 (Table 2). The diversity patterns observed for
'unique' strains was similar that found for CAS1 strains,

i.e. eight MIRU loci, number 26, 10, 16,31, 40, 39, 27 and
23 were "highly discriminant" (DI:≥0.6) and four loci
numbers 24, 4, 20 and 2 were "moderately discriminant"
(DI:0.3–0.59). However, no loci for 'unique' strains were
identified to be "poorly discriminant".
Discriminatory power of MIRU-VNTR typing for CAS1
Further statistical analysis was carried out to investigate
the utility of each of the twelve loci of MIRU typing to distinguish between CAS1 and 'unique' strains. Data was
analyzed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test.
Results revealed that differences in loci 4, 10 and 26 were
statistically significant (P-value < .01).
IS6110-RFLP typing
To further investigate the heterogeneous pattern shown by
MIRU-VNTR typing, IS6110-RFLP typing was carried on a
subset of strains; 29 CAS1 and 49 'unique' spoligotypes.
IS6110-RFLP typing of these 78 strains resulted in 73 different RFLP types (Fig 2). One cluster of two strains, with
single copy of IS6110 was identified, which was further
discriminated into individual patterns by MIRU-VNTR
typing. The remaining seventy two strains revealed unique
RFLP patterns while four strains were of 'zero' copy
IS6110. Despite the heterogeneous fingerprint pattern
shown by RFLP based clustering, the 25 CAS1 strains with
multiple IS6110 copy exhibited 60% homology. About
one fourth of the strains tested had 13 copies of IS6110
element.
Comparison of MDR isolates
We analyzed MIRU patterns for all the MDR strains in
order to investigate an association between resistance and
MIRUs. Of the CAS1 strains studied, 62 were MDR (53%)

Discussion
We have used MIRU-VNTR typing to characterize the predominant CAS1 genogroup of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
strains in Pakistan. Limited information is available about
the utility of MIRU-VNTR typing method to characterize
CAS1 strains i.e. 2–24 [18,41,42]. This study presents the
largest MIRU-VNTR genotyping data for Pakistani isolates
to date. Using 12 loci based MIRU-VNTR typing we studied a population of 367 MTB strains and found them to be
highly diverse. Of the 178 CAS1 strains studied only 34
(19 %) clustered into groups based on MIRU profiles,
while all 189 'unique' spoligotypes studied had nonmatching MIRU profiles and therefore remained unclustered.
Twelve loci based MIRU-VNTR typing has been extensively used to study Beijing strains. Results of these studies
indicates Beijing strains to display variable clustering,
between 53–100% [18,33,37,43,44]. Amongst the Beijing
isolates, locus 10 has been found to be the most discriminatory followed by locus 26 and 31, while other loci
being almost monomorphic [37,44]. In contrast, using 12
loci based MIRU-VNTR analysis we were unable to identify any monomorphic loci within the CAS1 genogroup.
Our data showed MIRU loci 26, 31, 16, 10, 27, 39 and 40,

in decreasing order, to be the most discriminatory for the
CAS1 genogroup of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite
exhibiting genetic phylogenetic variability CAS1 strains
studied also revealed more than 70% homology in their
MIRU profile. This could either be due to an intrinsic similarity within the CAS1 genogroup or may be reflective of
relatedness between strains found in a particular geographical region.
The overall allelic diversity and discriminatory power of
the VNTR loci in the MTB isolates of CAS1 and ' unique'
spoligotypes studied from Pakistan were higher than that
reported earlier for strains from Singapore, Russia and
South Africa [37,42]. The greater diversity observed can be
attributed to continual import of new strains due to traffic
of people between Pakistan and neighboring countries
endemic for tuberculosis such as, migration of populations from Afghanistan, and also travel between neighboring countries including China, Iran, the Middle East, India
and Bangladesh. It could however also be due to the presence of hyper variable regions in the strains circulating in
this region. Previous studies have suggested that increased
strain diversity may also be due to lower transmissibility
of indigenous strains [45].
To further understand the genetic character of MTB strains
studied, we subjected a subgroup of CAS1 and 'unique'
spoligotypes to IS6110-RFLP typing. Of the 29 CAS1
strains studied, 27 revealed a variable multi-copy IS6110RFLP profile while two strains had zero copy of IS6110
element present. This is the first report of a zero copy
IS6110 MTB strain as previously CAS1 strains have been

shown to have multiple copies of IS6110 [46]. One cluster
of two strains detected by RFLP typing containing one
copy of IS6110 was further differentiated by MIRU-VNTR
typing, further supporting the higher discriminatory ability of MIRU-VNTR typing especially for low copy IS6110
strains [47].
MIRU-VNTR allelic studies have been correlated with definitions of ancestral and modern MTB lineages, with the
presence of one allele in locus 24 being related to a modern strain type [18,42]. We found that 62% (107/178) of
our CAS1 strains contained only one allele at locus 24,
further confirming their modern lineage. This is comparable with previous reports for CAS1 and Beijing strains
from Singapore and Bangladesh [18,42] and also from
India as supported by the absence of the TbD1 region
from their CAS family strains [41].
We also compared our MIRU profiles of the CAS1 family
isolates with studies from Russia, Singapore and Bangladesh [18,37,41,42], through an international database
[see Additional file 1] and also with CAS strains from
India [41]. However, none of the CAS1 MIRU types we
identified were shared by those reported previously. This
implies that our CAS1 genotypes are generally clonal and
corroborates previous work which has suggested this
strain family to be a highly diverse genetic group.
We have used the standard 12 loci based method of
MIRU-VNTR typing. However, recent studies have identified increasing numbers of related MIRU loci which may
help in further discrimination between strains. Supply et

al. used 29 loci based typing and subsequently recommended 24 loci based typing for phylogentic analysis and
15 loci typing for improved epidemiological studies [48].
They identified MIRUs 10, 26, 40, 31, 4 and 16 as being
highly discriminatory (in decreasing order) for routine
epidemiological studies [48]. On the other hand Gutierrez
et al used 21 loci based VNTR typing to study 91 MTB isolates from India [41].
The 12 standard loci analysis we used included all six
MIRU loci recommended by Supply et al [48] and also 12
of the 21 loci used by Gutierrez et al [41]. While using
larger number of loci would certainly be more discriminatory for lineage analysis, our analysis focused more on differentiation within CAS1 strains. As such an overall
comparison of MIRU loci for CAS1 and 'unique' strains
revealed loci 26, 16, 10, 31, 40, 39, 27, 23, 24, 20, 2 and
4 to be in descending order of discrimination for allelic
diversity. Loci 4, 10 and 26 had a significantly lower discriminatory index with a P-value < 0.05 in CAS1 strains
than in 'unique', suggesting these loci to be the most conserved in CAS1 strains. In addition, locus 4 of CAS1 MDR
strains also had significantly lower discriminatory index
with a P-value < 0.05 when compared with MDR 'unique'
spoligotype strains. Although, CAS1 strains constituted
53% of the total MDR strains, overall, no significant association of CAS1 family could be established with multidrug resistance.

Conclusion
The effectiveness of MIRU loci to discriminate between
strains may vary between populations. Therefore, it is

BMC Microbiology 2007, 7:76

important to determine the most discriminatory alleles
for each country depending on the preponderance of MTB
strain types. In a region where CAS1 family of strains are
the most prevalent spoligotype we found MIRU loci 26,
31, 16, 10, 27, 39 and 40, in decreasing order, to be the
most discriminatory for differentiation of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis.

Methods
Mycobacterial strains
A total of 178 CAS1 strains identified through spoligotyping and 189 'unique' isolates that had been shown to have
spoligotype patterns not belonging to any cluster from
SpolDB4 [15] were selected from 2003–2005 for this
study. These isolates represented different geographical
locations across Pakistan were selected through a stratified
random sampling method.
Culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing
All mycobacterial strains were cultured on Middlebrook
7H10 agar. Susceptibilty testing was performed by the
standard agar proportion method with enriched Middlebrook 7H10 medium(BBL) as described previously [4951]. The following final drug concentrations were used:
rifampicin, 1 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml; isoniazid, 0.2 μg/ml and
1 μg/ml; streptomycin, 2 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml; ethambutol 5 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml. Pyrazinamide was tested with
BACTEC 7H12 medium, pH 6.0, at 100 μg/ml (Becton
Dickinson) as per manufacturer's instructions. Strains
with a high level of resistance for rifampicin (5 μg/ml)
and isoniazid (1 μg/ml) were further selected for MDR
analysis.
MIRU-VNTR PCR
DNA was extracted by cetyltrimethylamonium bromide
method [52], twelve MIRU loci (2, 4, 10, 16, 20, 23, 24,
26, 27, 31, 39 and 40) were PCR amplified individually
for all 367 isolates using specific primers as described previously [29]. Each of the PCR master mixes contained 0.4
μM concentration of specific primers, 0.5 mM concentration of dNTPs mix, 1 mM concentration of MgCl2, 1× PCR
buffer, 4 % of DMSO and 1U of Super Tth Taq DNA
polymerase for a 25 μl reaction. Master mixes were distributed to 96-well plates. Approximately 40–60 ng of template DNA was added for each sample. M tuberculosis
H37Rv DNA used as a positive control while negative controls consisting of PCR mixtures lacking mycobacterial
DNA was also used. PCR plates were sealed and placed in
PerkinElmer 9700 thermocycler starting with a denaturing
step of 15 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at
94°C, 1 min at 59°C, and 1 min 30 s at 72°C, followed
by an extension of 72°C. After the thermocycling step, all
367 MTB isolates were analyzed using a simple gel electrophoresis method. The PCR products were electrophoresed
on a 2.5% agarose gel and sized with a 100-bp ladder

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/76

(Promega). Band sizes were measured using Geldoc
Quantity-one (Bio-RAD) soft ware and allelic numbers
were determined using the MIRU-VNTR allele scoring
table [see Additional file 2].
IS6110-RFLP
IS6110-RFLP of 78 M tuberculosis strains were performed
by standardized methods [53]. Briefly, MTB strains were
cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and DNA was
extracted from them by standard method [52,53]. PvuII
digested DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis
and Southern blotting. DNA fingerprinting was performed by hybridization with the IS6110 using enhanced
chemiluminescence method (ECL Amersham).
Phylogenetic Analysis
The twelve digits MIRU-VNTR allele score obtained for
each MTB strain was then entered into Bionumerics soft
ware (Applied Maths, St. Martens Latem, Belgium) as a
character set and used to generate a dendrogram by unweighted pair group using arithmetic averages (UPGMA).
To compare isolates combining both methods, a multi
experiment composite data set with MIRU and Spoligotyping was created by using the available tools in Bionumerics.
Statistical analysis
The Hunter Gaston Discriminatory Index (HGDI) was calculated for comparison of discriminatory power of MIRUVNTR typing for different loci [54]. Non parametric analysis was carried out using the Mann-Whitney test to determine the utility of MIRU typing to distinguish between
CAS1 and 'unique' as well as CAS1-MDR and 'unique'
MDR. A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. This
analysis was carried out using version 14 of SPSS (Special
Program for Social Sciences Software, USA).
