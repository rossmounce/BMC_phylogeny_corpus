<p>Evidence species with whole-genome highly abundant miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) family present in all
MITE transposons in Drosophila

Abstract
Background: Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are non-autonomous
DNA-mediated transposable elements (TEs) derived from autonomous TEs. Unlike in many plants
or animals, MITEs and other types of DNA-mediated TEs were previously thought to be either rare
or absent in Drosophila. Most other TE families in Drosophila exist at low or intermediate copy
number (around < 100 per genome).
Results: We present evidence here that the dispersed repeat Drosophila interspersed element 1
(DINE-1; also named INE-1 and DNAREP1) is a highly abundant DNA-mediated TE containing
inverted repeats found in all 12 sequenced Drosophila genomes. All DINE-1s share a similar
sequence structure, but are more homogeneous within species than they are among species. The
inferred phylogenetic relationship of the DINE-1 consensus sequence from each species is generally
consistent with the known species phylogeny, suggesting vertical transmission as the major
mechanism for DINE-1 propagation. Exceptions observed in D. willistoni and D. ananassae could be
due to either horizontal transfer or reactivation of ancestral copies. Our analysis of pairwise
percentage identity of DINE-1 copies within species suggests that the transpositional activity of
DINE-1 is extremely dynamic, with some lineages showing evidence for recent transpositional
bursts and other lineages appearing to have silenced their DINE-1s for long periods of time. We
also find that all species have many DINE-1 insertions in introns and adjacent to protein-coding
genes. Finally, we discuss our results in light of a recent proposal that DINE-1s belong to the Helitron
family of TEs.
Conclusion: We find that all 12 Drosophila species with whole-genome sequence contain the high
copy element DINE-1. Although all DINE-1s share a similar structure, species-specific variation in
the distribution of average pairwise divergence suggests that DINE-1 has gone through multiple
independent cycles of activation and suppression. DINE-1 also has had a significant impact on gene
structure evolution.

Background

Interspersed repetitive sequences are ubiquitous to all
eukaryotic organisms, and make up a significant portion of
the genome [1-7]. These sequences are mostly transposable
elements (TEs) or TE-derived sequences, and they play
important roles in the evolution of chromosome organization
and genome complexity [8].
Based on their mechanism of transposition, TEs can be
divided into two classes: class I comprises retrotransposons,
which transpose through RNA-mediated mechanisms, and
class II comprises transposons, which mobilize through
DNA-mediated mechanisms [9,10]. Depending on their ability to direct their own transposition, each class of TEs can
contain two types: autonomous and non-autonomous copies.
Autonomous TEs code for the proteins that are required for
their transposition, and are mobilized in cis. Non-autonomous TEs are mobilized in trans by enzymes produced from
autonomous elements. Well-known examples include the
vertebrate retroelements LINEs (long interspersed elements)
and SINEs (short interspersed elements). The mobilization of
non-autonomous SINEs requires retrotransposase from
autonomous LINEs, and these elements co-evolve in a highly
species-specific manner [11,12]. Another example is the miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) found
in many plant genomes. MITEs are non-autonomous DNA
elements (class II) that originated from a subset of autonomous DNA transposons [13]. They are characterized by short
sequences with no coding capacity, flanked by terminal (or
occasionally subterminal) inverted repeats (TIRs) and very
short direct repeats caused by target site duplication (TSD).
MITEs have no internal homology to their parental autonomous transposons and often include non-homologous
sequences in their internal regions. MITEs have also been
found in several animal genomes, including Caenorhabditis
elegans, mosquitoes, fish and humans (reviewed in [14]).
Both SINEs and MITEs are highly abundant (usually > 1,000
copies per genome) in many host species across a broad taxonomic range. Because of their high abundance and active
movement, and their frequent association with genes [15,16],
MITEs have had a significant impact on the evolution and
complexity of eukaryotic genomes.
TE activity and evolution have been intensively studied in
Drosophila and many families of TEs have been described
[5,6,17-19]. Most TEs are at low or intermediate copy number
in D. melanogaster. MITEs and SINEs have been previously
reported as being either rare or absent in most species of this
genus that have been examined [20]. D. melanogaster DINE1 (Drosophila interspersed element 1; also named INE-1,
DNAREP1) is an exception to these observations [21]. D. melanogaster contains thousands of copies of DINE-1 [19]. All
copies appear to be non-autonomous, and analyses of their
divergence patterns suggest that D. melanogaster DINE-1
has been inactive for over 4 million years [22]. Although
DINE-1 was originally suggested to be a SINE-like retroele-

ment, we have suggested that it is more likely to be a MITE,
based on analysis of DINE-1 elements in D. yakuba that show
evidence of recent transpositional activity [23]. We discuss
below the structural features of DINE-1 supporting this designation, as well as the more recent proposal [24] that DINE1s are members of the Helitron family of TEs.
Several earlier studies found high copy TEs that we here classify as DINE-1. Vivas et al. [25] discovered an element in D.
subobscura called GEM that is composed of repetitive modules, one of which they also found in the D. melanogaster and
D. virilis genomes. Miller et al. [26] characterized an abundant element called SGM in D. subobscura, D. guanche and
D. madeirensis, noted its similarity to GEM, and also
described that other species, including D. melanogaster and
D. virilis, have similar sequences; GEM and SGM are the
same as DINE-1. Wilder and Hollocher [27] subsequently discovered an element in a number of Drosophila species that
they called mini-me and noted its similarity to D. melanogaster DINE-1. However, a comprehensive assessment of
the abundance and transpositional dynamics of DINE-1 has
not been reported. Here we expand our study of the evolutionary dynamics of DINE-1 using the recently available
genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species [7]. We found
that DINE-1-related sequences are not only highly abundant
in all 12 species, but also share a similar sequence structure,
suggesting that a common mechanism was used for their
transposition. Different lineages, however, show different
distributions of divergence, suggesting that DINE-1 has gone
through multiple cycles of transposition and subsequent
silencing.

Results
Identification and common sequence structure
characteristics of DINE-1s in 12 Drosophila species
Previously, we discovered that DINE-1 is highly abundant
and appears to have experienced a recent transpositional
burst in the lineage leading to D. yakuba [23]. Using the D.
yakuba DINE-1 consensus sequence, we searched using
BLAST for related sequences in 11 other sequenced genomes
of Drosophila (Figure 1). This initial screen suggested that all
12 Drosophila species contain hundreds to thousands of copies of DINE-1-related sequences. To infer the structure of
DINE-1 in each species, we manually aligned 50 sequences
with the highest BLAST scores from each species. Then we
aligned together these sequences from all the species. This
analysis revealed that DINE-1-related sequences from the ten
newly analyzed Drosophila species share a number of structural similarities with DINE-1 from D. yakuba and D. melanogaster (Figure 2; Table 1; also see Additional data file 1).
We previously defined D. yakuba DINE-1 as beginning at its
5' inverted repeat, based on the assumption that this
sequence is a TIR [23]. We have here placed this repeat one
nucleotide internal to D. yakuba DINE-1. This change in

based on the recent designation of DINE-1 as a Helitron element [24,28]. Our designation of the boundaries of DINE-1
differs by one nucleotide from that in [28], based on our analysis presented below of polymorphic insertions in D. yakuba
(Figure 3). The precise boundaries of DINE-1 in each species
are difficult to determine because of their preference for
inserting in T-rich regions. We have annotated the sequences
in Figure 2 in order to maximize similarity to D. yakuba
DINE-1. Based on this alignment the 5' inverted repeat ranges
from being terminal to 2 bp internal; in all species the corresponding 3' inverted repeat is clearly internal. We thus refer
to these repeats as subterminal inverted repeats (subTIRs).
The common features of DINE-1 from all species include: 13
bp subTIRs (the exact location of such repeats differs by 1-2
nucleotides among species); a partial inverted repeat next to
the 5' subTIR; terminal regions that are relatively well-conserved within species, called blocks A and B; a GTCY-rich
microsatellite repeat of variable length within block A; a variable central repeat region, which is responsible for most of
the total length variation among elements; the lack of any significant open reading frames; and a propensity to insert
between TT dinucleotides (discussed further below).
Our analysis revealed one novel feature not previously
described for DINE-1, SGM or mini-me, namely a short hairpin stem-loop structure (with 7-11 nucleotide-long stems)
located a few nucleotides downstream of the 3' subTIR (Figure 2). The sequence of the self-complementary stem differs
among species, suggesting that compensatory mutations
maintain its structure. This stem-loop may function as a terminator during rolling-circle replication (see Discussion).

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R39

Yang and Barbash R39.3

Several of the features we characterized refine structural features inferred previously from SGM [26] and mini-me [27].
TIRs from mini-me were reported to vary from 10-20 bp in
length from different species, while our analysis identified 13
bp TIRs in all species. These differences likely reflect the fact
that we have analyzed many more sequences. The 13 bp subTIRs from D. melanogaster and D. virilis that we describe
contain the 10 and 11 bp sequences reported by Wilder and
Hollocher [27]. Likewise, the 17 bp TIR reported previously
for D. subobscura mini-me contains the 13 bp subTIR
reported here for D. pseudoobscura, with one internal basepair difference. The partial inverted repeat flanking the 5'
subTIR we identified is more variable than that reported
based on two copies of mini-me, being a partial and/or interrupted repeat of the 5' subTIR in different species.
Wilder and Hollocher [27] also reported that mini-me elements from all species contain a highly conserved 33 bp core
region. We find that this conserved core region actually
extends over 90 bp, including the (TA)4 repeat and additional
sequences 5' to this repeat. These sequences partially overlap
with the LS module described for SGM elements [26]. The
striking conservation of this core among the 12 species suggests that it is of functional significance for DINE-1 transposition.
We previously proposed that transposition of D. yakuba
DINE-1 creates a dinucleotide (TT) TSD upon insertion [23].
However, based on analysis of the genome sequence from a
single strain this conclusion was not definitive because some
copies did not have a TT dinucleotide flanking both sides.
This could be due either to accumulated mutations after
insertion or because the TT site preference is not absolute. We
performed a preliminary test of this hypothesis by comparing
the sequences of three polymorphic insertion sites of DINE-1
in multiple strains of D. yakuba [23]. Here we extended this
analysis with seven additional DINE-1 insertions that are polymorphic among different D. yakuba strains (see Materials
and methods).
We found that all of these ten sites have a similar sequence
structure (Figure 3). The interpretation of these data, however, depends on where precisely DINE-1 starts. Our previous
interpretation of DINE-1 beginning at the 5' subTIR is consistent with insertions causing a TT TSD (Figure 3c). With the
re-designation of the 5' end of DINE-1, these two nucleotides
are instead part of the element, and DINE-1 would not create
a TSD. The lack of a TSD is consistent with the proposal that
DINE-1s are Helitrons (see below). Based on our designation
of the DINE-1 boundaries, all D. yakuba insertions occur
between the dinucleotide TT (Figure 3a). Using the DINE-1
boundaries from [28], the insertion site preference is more
variable (Figure 3b). We then examined the sequences flanking the putative DINE-1s identified in the other Drosophila
species. The majority (> 80%) of DINE-1s are flanked by TT
dinucleotides. The conservation of this site preference in all

The generalized structure of DINE-1 sequences from 12 Drosophila genomes, and alignment of the DINE-1 consensus sequences from 12 species with each
feature boxed. The element contains two conserved blocks, A and B. Within block A, the sequence can be further divided into two parts, A1 and A2,
separated by a region of variable length containing the tandem repeats (CCGT)n(CTGT)n. Between blocks A and B is a region of central repeats, containing
species-specific repeats. These central repeat sequences do not share homology among species; the length of the repeat unit can range from
approximately 50 bp to approximately 500 bp, and the number of repeats is also variable within species. Locations of the subTIRs are shown as gray
arrows; see Table 1 for precise designations of subTIR sequences. The 5' end also contains a second inverted repeat (IR) sequence that is partially
complementary to the 5'-end terminal repeat and is shown as a gray arrowhead. An inverted repeat near the 3' end forms a potential stem-loop structure
and is indicated by white arrowheads.

12 species, combined with the numerous other similarities
described above, strongly suggests that each of these elements is in fact a species-specific DINE-1 and that they likely
share a common mechanism of transposition.

Relationships of DINE-1s within and among species
Two pieces of evidence demonstrate that DINE-1 is highly
homogeneous within 11 of the 12 species, with D. willistoni
discussed below as being exceptional. First, we performed
BLAST searches using the 90 bp sequence of the core region,
which is conserved among all types of DINE-1s. By comparing
the TIRs and block A sequences we found that each species
contains only one type of DINE-1. Second, we searched for
DINE-1s in one genome using the DINE-1 consensus

sequences from other genomes as queries, and found only the
same sets of sequences.
Among the 11 species (again excluding D. willistoni), there
are 5 different subTIRs (Table 1). All five melanogaster subgroup species have the same subTIR sequence. D. ananassae
has a unique subTIR, while the closely related species D.
pseudoobscura and D. persimilis share the same subTIR, as
do D. virilis and D. mojavensis. The DINE-1 subTIR from D.
grimshawii shares 12/13 bp with D. virilis and D. mojavensis. The central repeat is the most diverse region of DINE-1
among species. Even species sharing the same subTIRs, such
as D. virilis and D. mojavensis, have unrelated central repeat
regions.

Analysis of D. willistoni gave uniquely different results. D.
willistoni contains three different subtypes of DINE-1s, each
with different subTIRs and different central repeat sequences
(Figure 2). Phylogenetic evidence presented below suggests
that they have at least two independent evolutionary origins.

Abundance and divergence of DINE-1s within species
DINE-1 is highly abundant in all 12 Drosophila species. It is
difficult to determine an exact number because each species
contains small and fragmented copies that cannot always be
unambiguously identified as DINE-1s. We therefore used
stringent criteria to identify DINE-1s in order to obtain a reliable comparison among species (Table 1). For example, this
search identified 355 copies in D. melanogaster compared to
previous analyses that suggested that D. melanogaster has
approximately 1,000 copies [22]. Using identical search criteria, we found vast differences in the copy number of DINE-1s
among species, ranging from 334 in D. grimshawii to 6,297
in D. willistoni.
We identified similar numbers of DINE-1s in the D. melanogaster sister species D. simulans and D. sechellia compared to D. melanogaster. In contrast, more than ten-fold
more copies were identified in D. yakuba. This high copy
number is due to the large number of closely related copies in
D. yakuba, and is consistent with previous work that suggested that DINE-1 has been inactive in D. melanogaster but
underwent a recent transpositional burst in D. yakuba [23].
We therefore sought to determine whether other species with
high copy number also show evidence of recent transpositional bursts. We used BLAST percent identity scores as an
approximate method to estimate divergence among individ-

ual copies within species (Table 1; Figure 4). This method
accurately recapitulates previous analyses for D. yakuba and
D. melanogaster that were based on estimates of per-site
divergence [23]: DINE-1s from D. melanogaster have a broad
peak of identities centered approximately around 90%, while
D. yakuba shows a peak from approximately 96-100%, with a
long tail of more diverged copies. These differences are highly
significant (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed, p < 0.001).
D. simulans and D. sechellia show distributions similar to D.
melanogaster (Figure 4; p > 0.05) and have average percent
identities around 90-91% (Table 1). D. erecta has an average
percent identity more similar to D. melanogaster than to D.
yakuba; however, its distribution is significantly different
from both species (p < 0.001). These data suggest that D.
yakuba is the only melanogaster subgroup species that experienced a recent transpositional burst. D. grimshawii also has
a distribution with very few copies of high similarity, and a
similar copy number to D. melanogaster, suggesting that
DINE-1 has not been recently active in this species. In
contrast, DINE-1s from D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, and
D. ananassae have average percent identities > 95% with distributions highly skewed toward young copies, suggesting
recent transpositional bursts in these species. The distributions in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis are significantly
different (p < 0.001; see Discussion). D. ananassae in particular stands out for having many copies identical to the consensus sequence (in the block A region). D. virilis and D.
mojavensis also have substantial numbers of young copies
but more broad distributions, suggesting the possibility that
multiple rounds of transposition, silencing and reactivation
may have occurred in these species.

Analysis of ten sites that are polymorphic for DINE-1 insertions in natural populations of D. yakuba. For each site, the sequence from a strain containing a
DINE-1 insertion is shown at the top, and the sequence from a strain lacking the insertion is shown at the bottom. Only the terminal sequences of DINE-1
and its flanking sequences are shown. The 5' subTIR is shown in bold italics. Insertions 1-3 were previously reported in [23]. The interpretation of these
data depends on the designation of the DINE-1 termini and whether insertion causes a TSD. (a) Analysis using the annotation of DINE-1 structure
presented in this paper. This annotation places the subTIR of D. yakuba 1 bp internal to the 5' end. It also assumes that no TSD is created, in accord with
the proposed mechanism of Helitron-type replication [24]. Under these stipulations, all ten insertions occur between the dinucleotide TT in the consensus
sequence WTT (where W = A or T), and eight of ten match a longer consensus sequence of insertion after the second nucleotide in the sequence of
WTTTT. (b) Analysis assuming the DINE-1 termini of [28], and Helitron-type replication. Only sites 1 and 10 are shown. Under this annotation, DINE-1
would have an insertion preference for WT dinucleotides. (c) Analysis assuming that the DINE-1 5' end begins at its inverted repeat, inserts between the
dinucleotide TT and causes a 2 bp TSD, as in MITE-like DNA transposons. The TSDs caused by DINE-1 are boxed.

D. willistoni has more than 1,000 copies of each of its three
subtypes (Table 1), with subtype 1 and 3 having about twice as
many copies as subtype 2. Each subtype has a peak near 100%
identity, suggesting recent transpositional activity; however,
their distributions are significantly different from each other
(p < 0.001). Interestingly, these subtypes also have different
phylogenetic patterns (see below).

Phylogenetic relationship of DINE-1s
These very different estimates of DINE-1 divergence within
different species, and in particular our evidence for recent
transpositional bursts, raises the question of whether DINE-1
may have undergone horizontal transmission into some Drosophila species. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of
DINE-1s and their association with their host species, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of DINE-1 consensus
sequences from the 12 Drosophila species (Additional data
file 1) and compared it with the known phylogeny of Drosophila [29]. Because of the rapid evolution in the central
repeat region, reliable alignment for phylogenetic reconstruction could be obtained only for blocks A and B.
With the exceptions of D. willistoni and D. ananassae, the
phylogenetic relationships of the DINE-1 sequences are, in
general, consistent with the host species phylogeny (Figure
5). The grouping of DINE-1 in a separate clade containing D.
ananassae and two of the three types from D. willistoni is
surprising. The fact that this clade is an outgroup suggests
that this result is not due to horizontal transfer from other
Drosophila into these species. One possibility is that DINE-1
was horizontally transferred from non-Drosophila into these

DINE-1 insertions in or near to genes
In situ hybridizations to polytene chromosomes from several
species using species-specific DINE-1 probes revealed strong
signals in the heterochromatic chromocenter region, with
additional hybridization observed along chromosome arms
(data not shown). These non-chromocenter sites of
hybridization led us ask whether DINE-1 insertions (whole or
partial) are found in or near to protein-coding genes. SGMrelated sequences were previously found in introns or adjacent to a number of D. melanogaster genes [26]. We found
hundreds of DINE-1 insertions in predicted introns in all species (Table 2; Additional data file 1). We also found many
DINE-1 copies within 1 kb of genes, which could potentially be
in either untranslated regions or in regulatory regions. These
results suggest that DINE-1 has had a significant impact on
gene structure evolution throughout the Drosophilidae. Few
DINE-1 insertions were found in predicted coding sequences
(CDSs). Strikingly, the largest number (15) was found in D.
ananassae, a species that has a very high copy number of
highly similar (young) DINE-1 copies (Table 1; Figure 4). This
result suggests that recent transpositional activity of DINE-1
in D. ananassae has resulted in mildly deleterious insertions
into coding regions that have not yet been removed by
selection.

Analysis of Helitron sequences in D. yakuba and D. virilis
Kapitonov and Jurka [24,28] recently proposed that DINE-1
is related to Helitron, a family of DNA-mediated TEs. They
reported consensus sequences of autonomous and nonautonomous copies of Helitron in D. yakuba and D. virilis.
The non-autonomous consensus sequences are closely similar to our consensus sequences reported here. The consensus
autonomous copies have an open reading frame (ORF)
encoding the RepHel protein found in many other Helitrons,
and sequences at each end similar to what we report here for
DINE-1. These include block A at the 5' end and block B at the
3' end. We searched these two species using the RepHel portion of the autonomous consensus sequence as a query to
determine whether these species contain potentially active
copies. Among the top ten hits in D. yakuba, none have a fully
intact RepHel ORF. Three copies have DINE-1 sequences
flanking both sides of the RepHel sequences; two of these
have over 500 bp of DINE-1 sequence at each end while the
third has only approximately 50-60 bp of DINE-1 sequence at
each end. Six of the remaining copies have DINE-1 sequences
flanking one side of the RepHel sequence, and the last hit has
no flanking DINE-1 sequences. Among the top ten hits in D.
virilis we again found no copies with a fully intact RepHel
ORF. One copy has DINE-1 sequences flanking both sides and
five copies have DINE-1 sequences flanking one side. Among
the remaining copies, one is in a highly repetitive region and
could not be further analyzed, and the remaining four copies
have no flanking DINE-1 sequences. We conclude that D.
yakuba and D. virilis are unlikely to contain currently active
autonomous Helitrons.

Discussion

DINE-1 is the most abundant repetitive sequence in the Drosophila genome. DINE-1 was first identified on the fourth
chromosome of D. melanogaster [21], and was suggested to
be a non-autonomous retroelement, analogous to vertebrate

SINEs. This argument was based on its high abundance, composing > 1% of the total genome, its small size and its lack of
significant ORFs [19,21,22,27,30]. However, unlike known
SINEs, D. melanogaster DINE-1 did not appear to have
polymerase III promoter consensus sequences or similarity to
tRNAs or other small RNAs.
Subsequently, DINE-1-related sequences were found in other
Dipteran species and were classified as novel TE families.
Miller et al. [26], following earlier observations by Vivas et al.
[25], identified SGM from several obscura group species as
well as related sequences in GenBank from at least eight other
Drosophila species, and noted its possible similarity to
MITEs [26]. They further suggested that SGM elements composed approximately 10% of the D. guanche genome. Wilder
and Hollocher [27] identified 'mini-me' and characterized its
sequence structure based on approximately 80 clones isolated from 2 species of the cardini group, D. dunni and D.
nigrodunni, and 28 sequences from 14 different species
obtained from GenBank. mini-me was classified as a nonautonomous retroelement, although no direct relationship to
previously known retroelements was observed.
Previously, Yang et al. [23] identified a recent transpositional
burst of DINE-1 in the genome of D. yakuba. The analysis of
highly similar, newly inserted DINE-1s in this species allowed
for a more detailed characterization of DINE-1 sequence
structure. We concluded that DINE-1 is more likely to be a
non-autonomous DNA transposon, similar to MITEs first
described in maize [13], rather than a SINE-like retroelement, based on the existence of perfect terminal and subterminal inverted repeats and a TSD (TT), which are typical
characteristics of DNA transposons. Moreover, the lack of
polymerase III binding sites or tRNA-related structures in
these recently inserted copies argued against DINE-1 being
similar to SINEs [23]. Bergman et al. [6] also characterized
DINE-1 as being a TIR transposon.

In order to understand the origin and distribution of DINE-1
in the Drosophilidae, we expanded our search to ten additional partial or complete Drosophila genome databases
using the consensus sequence of D. yakuba DINE-1. Strikingly, we found that sequences related to D. yakuba DINE-1
are very abundant in all these genomes (Table 1). BLAST
searches did not find any related sequences in the mosquito,
silk worm or other eukaryotic genomes, suggesting that
DINE-1 is unique to Diptera. DINE-1-related sequences from
all the Drosophila species share the same sequence structure
that was defined from D. yakuba DINE-1 or from mini-me,
with each containing: highly conserved blocks A and B at both
ends, including a core region of approximately 90 bp in block
A; a central repeat region of variable length; inverted repeats
13 nucleotides long at or near the 5' end and close to the 3'
end; and insertion preference for T-rich regions (Figure 2).
The sequences of the central repeat region from different species are very different, suggesting non-homologous origins of
this region among species. In contrast, the within species
divergence of this region is much smaller.
Our comparison of DINE-1 from 12 species revealed a previously unobserved 3' inverted repeat structure that could
potentially form a stem-loop (Figure 2). It is important to
note that in the absence of any internal ORFs, the designation
of 5' and 3' for DINE-1 is arbitrary. The presence of potential
stem-loops near both ends of DINE-1 raises the possibility
that these structures are recognized by a reverse transcriptase, which would imply that DINE-1 is in fact a nonautonomous retroelement. However, considering all the evidence outlined above, we suggest that DINE-1 transposition
is DNA mediated.
It was thought previously that MITE-like DNA transposons
are rare in Drosophila, with only a few having been identified.
One example of a Drosophila MITE is derived from pogo-like
transposons in D. melanogaster [31]. Other examples are
Vege and Mar, derived from the autonomous TE hobo of the
hAT superfamily in D. willistoni [32]. However, unlike most
MITEs, which are usually highly abundant in the host
genome, only a few copies (< 10) of Vege and Mar were found
in the genomes of their Drosophila hosts [32].
Non-autonomous DNA transposons require an external
source of transposase for transposition. For many TEs transposase initiates transposition by recognizing and binding to
the TIR sequence, and this interaction is highly specific
[33,34] Recently, Feschotte et al. [35] have shown that autonomous mariner-like transposase can not only interact with its
own TIR, but can also interact with the TIR of Stowaway
MITEs in rice. This provides strong evidence that Stowaway
MITEs may use mariner-like TEs as their source for
transposase.
Casola et al. [36] recently identified several Drosophila PIFlike transposons (DPLTs), which are found among Dro-

sophila in both apparently autonomous and non-autonomous forms. Neither the TIR nor TSD sequences of these
transposons match that of DINE-1, which suggests that they
are not the autonomous parental copies of DINE-1.
Intriguingly, however, DPLT1 has apparently active copies in
D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis and D. willistoni
and only inactive MITE-like copies in D. melanogaster, D.
simulans, D. sechellia, D. erecta and D. mojavensis. This pattern closely resembles the division seen here for species that
either do or do not show evidence for recent transpositional
bursts of DINE-1 (Figure 4). These shared patterns suggest
that species such as D. yakuba have experienced recent and
ongoing movement of several DNA transposon families.

DINE-1: MITE or Helitron?
DINE-1 has many features characteristic of MITEs - small
size, lack of coding potential, high copy number, and frequent
association with genes. On the other hand, most MITEs have
TIRs, which are presumably sites of transposase binding. A
few MITE-like elements have been discovered that have subTIRs rather than TIRs but their corresponding autonomous
elements have not been identified [37-39]. DINE-1 has
inverted repeats and their conservation in structure despite
ongoing changes in primary sequence argues strongly that
they are of functional importance. We have placed the 5'
inverted repeat 0-2 nucleotides internal to the end of DINE-1
in different species. Under this annotation, D. yakuba DINE1 insertions would not cause a TSD (Figure 3). If the true 5'
end of DINE-1 instead corresponds to the 5' inverted repeat,
then D. yakuba DINE-1 insertion would cause a 2 bp TSD, as
seen in other MITEs. The 3' inverted repeat, however, is
clearly subterminal, which would be unusual for a MITE
element.
Kapitonov and Jurka [24,28] have recently proposed that
DINE-1 is instead a non-autonomous Helitron element. They
noted that DINE-1 has a number of features unusual for Helitrons. One was the absence of a short hairpin or palindrome
at the 3' end, which is thought to function as a replication terminator. We have identified here a 3' hairpin structure in all
12 species that may fulfill this function. A number of unusual
features remain. Foremost are the termini. Helitrons do not
contain TIRs but instead have highly conserved 5' TC or 3'
CTRR sequences. In contrast, DINE-1 lacks these short termini sequences but instead contains conserved subTIRs. The
presence of relatively long blocks of conserved sequence
between non-autonomous DINE-1 and the proposed autonomous copies also contrasts with other species. For example,
bats contain several families of very high copy number nonautonomous Helitrons, which differ almost entirely from
their autonomous master copies other than at their di- and
tetra-nucleotide termini [40].
The most decisive evidence favoring the Helitron hypothesis
is the association of DINE-1 elements with non-functional but
recognizable partial ORFs of the RepHel protein in D. yakuba

and D. virilis, making these copies the candidate autonomous
elements responsible for the recent transpositional bursts of
non-autonomous DINE-1s in these species. Considering
some of the unusual features mentioned above, it will be of
great interest to investigate experimentally the mechanism of
DINE-1 transposition.

DINE-1 in the melanogaster subgroup
From our previous study [23], we found that D. melanogaster
and D. yakuba contain structurally similar types of DINE-1s.
The species differed significantly, however, in their distributions of sequence divergence and the chromosomal location
of their DINE-1 copies. D. yakuba contains many similar copies, and these apparently younger copies have a higher relative frequency in euchromatic regions compared to older,
more diverged copies. We hypothesized that DINE-1s in D.
melanogaster and D. yakuba derive from a common ancestor
that existed before the divergence of the melanogaster subgroup species. This hypothesis was tested here by our identification of DINE-1 from three other species of the
melanogaster subgroup, D. simulans, D. sechellia and D.
erecta. All five subgroup species share the same TIRs, core,
central repeat unit, and 3' end stem-loop sequences. DINE-1s
from the three newly characterized species have similar copy
numbers and distributions of sequence divergence, an observation consistent with the hypothesis that DINE-1 was active
and then silenced in the common ancestor of the melanogaster subgroup. D. yakuba is the only species showing
evidence of a second, recent transpositional burst. We did
find that DINE-1s from D. erecta have a different sequence in
the region joining the central repeat to block B, suggesting
that this is the most rapidly evolving region of DINE-1.

Dynamic nature and genomic impact of DINE-1
Our analysis reveals that several species outside the melanogaster subgroup have distributions of DINE-1 identity similar to that described above for D. yakuba, suggesting that
DINE-1 has undergone multiple, independent transpositional
bursts. D. ananassae and D. willistoni show the strongest evidence, with distributions skewed toward 100% (Figure 4). D.
virilis has a somewhat broader distribution, with many similar copies suggestive of recent transpositional activity. D.
mojavensis shows a broad distribution that is suggestive of
multiple rounds of transposition and silencing at different
times.
D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis have distributions with
peaks around 98-99% identity. These species diverged less
than one million years ago [41], which might suggest that the
similarly high identity in both species reflects activity of
DINE-1 before or during their speciation. However, the distributions are significantly different, with D. pseudoobscura
retaining proportionally more copies of high divergence. One
possible explanation is that DINE-1 remained active more
recently in D. persimilis. Alternatively, the strength of selection against older copies may differ between the species.

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R39

Yang and Barbash R39.11

The discovery of multiple and relatively distant species each
showing evidence for recently active DINE-1 copies raises the
question of whether this element has been transmitted
vertically or horizontally. The phylogenetic relationship
among different DINE-1s (Figure 5) suggests vertical inheritance, with transpositional bursts resulting from existing
copies escaping from host suppression. DINE-1 from D.
ananassae and two subtypes from D. willistoni give a pattern
discordant from the accepted species phylogeny but this pattern is also not consistent with a simple model of horizontal
transfer among Drosophila species. Instead, we suggest that
the phylogenetic pattern is likely to reflect reactivation of a
related ancestral element in both D. ananassae and D.
willistoni. Our analysis is necessarily limited by the relatively
short sequences available for analysis. We suggest that further phylogenetic analysis of the autonomous elements from
each species will help to further understand the evolution of
DINE-1. Nevertheless, the combination of our phylogenetic
analysis and the divergence data indicates that the activity of
DINE-1 is extremely dynamic. The activation and suppression of the element seems to have evolved rapidly and repeatedly in multiple lineages leading to the 12 species.
Similar dynamics of transposition and suppression are found
in LINEs and SINEs of mammalian genomes [42-44] and
MITEs in plant genomes (see review in [14]). Some insertions
of MITEs in plants have been shown to affect gene regulation
[45,46]. We have found that DINE-1 insertions are frequently
found in the flanking regions and introns of genes, suggesting
that some copies may also influence gene regulation (Table
2).
Highly abundant interspersed repetitive sequences can also
serve as targets for ectopic recombination. Such recombination may be deleterious by promoting genome instability
[47,48], but may also catalyze structural evolution of existing
genes and contribute to new gene formation [49]. DINE-1 is a
candidate for causing analogous phenomenon in Drosophila.
The testis-expressed gene hydra is one well-characterized
example [50]. hydra exists only in the melanogaster subgroup, and its exon 1 has undergone multiple independent
duplications. Many of these duplicated exon 1s are flanked by
DINE-1 insertions, which suggests that DINE-1 may have
facilitated some of these duplications by providing homologous target sequences for unequal crossing over. Given its
high abundance and evidence for multiple rounds of transpositional activity, DINE-1 has clearly had a significant impact
on Drosophila genome evolution, and we suggest that other
examples of gene structural evolution associated with DINE1 will be found among these species.
DINE-1 can also be a valuable system for studying rates and
patterns of mutations. One can study de novo mutations in
species that have had recent transpositional bursts by comparing the sequence variation among young, recently inserted
DINE-1 copies. One can also use DINE-1 to examine substitu-

tion patterns between species. Previous comparative analysis
of the chromosome distribution of DINE-1 in D. yakuba and
D. melanogaster suggests that most new insertions are eliminated from the genome by negative selection [23]. Old copies
that remain are thus likely to be evolving neutrally. One could
therefore identify orthologous insertions between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, whose insertions must predate the
divergence of these species, in order to infer the substitution
pattern along lineages leading to both species. The ability to
perform similar studies in multiple Drosophila species will
allow unprecedented power for determining whether and
how patterns of mutations vary in different lineages.

Materials and methods
Identifying DINE-1-related sequences from 12
Drosophila genomes
Using the D. yakuba DINE-1 consensus sequence as a query,
we searched for DINE-1-related sequences in all 12 Drosophila genome databases (from Comparative Assembly
Freeze 1 (CAF1) [51]) using BLAST with the default setting of
the parameters (Figure 1). Note that D. persimilis and D.
sechellia were sequenced at only approximately three- to
four-fold coverage and, thus, are incomplete. We retrieved
the 50 copies of DINE-1 with the lowest E-value in each
species, aligned them, and derived a consensus sequence for
each species (Additional data file 1).

Sequence divergence and copy number among DINE-1s
We then BLAST-searched each genome using part of the consensus sequences of DINE-1 (5' end to end of core sequence)
from its own species, using the default settings of the program. All BLAST hits greater than 100 bp were retained. The
frequencies of percent identity between the query sequence
and all hits were plotted for each species.

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R39

Yang and Barbash R39.12

the DINE-1 consensus of each species. Only hits longer than
40 bp with an E-value lower than 10-5 were included.

Characterizing target site duplication of DINE-1
From the D. yakuba genome database, seven sites of DINE-1
insertion with sequence similarity > 97% to the D. yakuba
DINE-1 consensus were chosen for analysis. PCR primers
complementary to the 100 bp flanking sequence of each site
were designed (Additional data file 2). A total of ten lines of
D. yakuba, including nine Cy lines from a natural population
(gift from Dr Peter Andolfatto at UCSD) and the strain
Tai18E2, which was used for whole-genome sequencing, were
checked for the presence of DINE-1 insertions at each site.
Genomic DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted from 20-30
flies per line followed by ethanol precipitation. The program
for PCR reaction was: 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30
cycles of 94°C (30s), 60°C (30s), and 70°C (1 minute), and
extension at 70°C for 7 minutes. For lines not containing the
DINE-1 insertion, PCR products were directly sequenced
using ABI BigDye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
technologies.

Abbreviations

CDS, coding sequence; DINE-1, Drosophila interspersed element 1; LINE, long interspersed elements; MITE, miniature
inverted-repeat transposable element; ORF, open reading
frame; SINE, short interspersed elements; TE, transposable
element; TIR, terminal inverted repeat; TSD, target site
duplication.

Authors' contributions

H-PY designed the research, performed the research and analyzed the data. H-PY and DAB wrote the paper.

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned using ClustalW [52] with the default
parameter settings. Alignments were further improved by
manual adjustment. Inferred phylogenetic trees of the species
consensus of DINE-1 were constructed using the neighborjoining method with bootstrap resampling (500 replicates)
using MEGA 3.0 [53].

Searching for DINE-1 within or near genes
The UCSC Genome Browser Gateway [54] was used to obtain
locations of DINE-1 in the annotated genomes, with the
exception of D. willistoni. DNA sequences were retrieved
using the Genes and Gene Prediction tracks (track setting:
Other RefSeq) and grouped into the following categories: category 1, 1,000 bp upstream of CDS; category 2, CDS; category
3, introns; and category 4, 1,000 bp downstream of CDS. Categories 1 and 4 were then merged into a single class of flanking sequences. We then performed BLAST search to each of
these three classes of sequences, using the block A regions of
