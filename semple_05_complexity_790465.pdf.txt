Abstract
Background: We have examined the evolution of the genes at the major human β-defensin locus
and the orthologous loci in a range of other primates and mouse. For the first time these data allow
us to examine selective episodes in the more recent evolutionary history of this locus as well as
the ancient past. We have used a combination of maximum likelihood based tests and a maximum
parsimony based sliding window approach to give a detailed view of the varying modes of selection
operating at this locus.
Results: We provide evidence for strong positive selection soon after the duplication of these
genes within an ancestral mammalian genome. Consequently variable selective pressures have
acted on β-defensin genes in different evolutionary lineages, with episodes both of negative, and
more rarely positive selection, during the divergence of primates. Positive selection appears to have
been more common in the rodent lineage, accompanying the birth of novel, rodent-specific βdefensin genes. These observations allow a fuller understanding of the evolution of mammalian
innate immunity.
In both the rodent and primate lineages, sites in the second exon have been subject to positive
selection and by implication are important in functional diversity. A small number of sites in the
mature human peptides were found to have undergone repeated episodes of selection in different
primate lineages. Particular sites were consistently implicated by multiple methods at positions
throughout the mature peptides. These sites are clustered at positions predicted to be important
for the specificity of the antimicrobial or chemoattractant properties of β-defensins. Surprisingly,
sites within the prepropeptide region were also implicated as being subject to significant positive
selection, suggesting previously unappreciated functional significance for this region.
Conclusions: Identification of these putatively functional sites has important implications for our
understanding of β-defensin function and for novel antibiotic design.

Background
Antimicrobial peptides have a critical role in the vertebrate innate immune defence against microbes. These
peptides have potential as therapeutics and intelligent
drug design relies on understanding how these molecules
function. Defensins are peptides, which are generally cationic, are produced as prepropeptides and can be divided
into subclasses based on the distribution of the six canonical cysteines that are located in the mature peptide. There
are only two subclasses shared between mouse and
human, the α and β-defensins. These molecules both have
six canonical cysteine residues but differ in the spacing of
these residues and the intramolecular disulphide bridges
formed [1]. The antimicrobial activity of both α and βdefensins in vivo is well established [2]. More recently βdefensins have been shown to act as a link between adaptive and innate immunity [3] and play important roles in
cancer progression [4]. This has stimulated great interest
in the function and evolution of β-defensins in primate
lineages [5].
Genes that are involved in host defence often display high
rates of genomic divergence and evidence for adaptive
evolution. As seems to be the case with other proteins
involved in the immune response, such as MHC molecules, immunoglobulins and α-defensins, this selection
may be a response to the rapid evolution of pathogens [68]. In agreement with this, the four well-studied human βdefensins vary in their expression patterns as well as their
antimicrobial and antiviral activities [5]. We have previously investigated the 8 functional human genes at the
major 8p22-p23 β-defensin locus and 11 genes at the
orthologous mouse locus. In both mouse and human, βdefensin paralogues show little sequence similarity in the
mature peptide region and this divergence appears to have
been driven by positive selection following duplication
[9,10]. These genes show an unusual pattern of evolution,
with rapid divergence between second exon sequences
that encode the mature peptides matched by relative stasis
in the first exons that encode signal peptides [10]. However, these previous studies detected positive selection acting during the more distant evolutionary history of this
locus to produce a diverse cluster of paralogous genes
apparently established early in mammalian evolution
[9,10]. The evidence for positive selection acting within
primate lineages since this paralogous cluster was established has been more equivocal and fragmentary. It has
been reported that both DEFB1 [11] and DEFB103 (formerly DEFB3) [12] have evolved neutrally in primate lineages with no evidence for positive selection. In contrast
there is circumstantial evidence to suggest that the evolution of primate DEFB4 (formerly DEFB2) genes has
involved positive selection [13]. The selective forces operating on the other β-defensins at this locus in primate lineages have, until now, remained unknown.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/32

Many of the previous analyses of β-defensin genes
depended upon statistical tests based on a traditional pairwise approach, calculating and comparing the rate of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution
between two sequences averaged over all codons. However this approach is not appropriate for short sequences
(such as β-defensins) since they do not provide sample
sizes (numbers of sites and/or substitutions) that are large
enough to give significant results. In addition, because
such methods are based upon the dN/dS ratio across the
whole length of the sequences under consideration, purifying selection at some sites could obscure the action of
positive selection at other sites. A popular alternative strategy is to use likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) that allow one to
estimate the dN/dS ratio (ω) at particular sites rather than
averaging it over the whole molecule. This site-specific
analysis has been successful at detecting positive selection
in a variety of genes, particularly in gene families following expansion by duplication, and computer simulations
have confirmed the power of the analysis [14-16]. However, Suzuki and Nei [17-19] found that positively
selected amino acid sites are more reliably inferred by parsimony-based methods than by likelihood-based methods, with the latter prone to producing false positives.
Recently a new sliding window approach based on maximum parsimony has been devised to conservatively predict the presence of selection from alignments, with
special attention paid to reducing false positives [20]. Also
Suzuki [21] has developed software that can detect positively and negatively selected sites based upon maximum
parsimony, Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods.
Given the known shortcomings of the methods available
it seems most prudent to restrict attention to sites that are
inferred to be subject to selection by multiple methods
[22,23]. We have used a combined strategy, complementing likelihood and parsimony-based approaches to give a
comprehensive account of the selection acting at the main
β-defensin locus in human, and the orthologous loci in a
range of other primates and mouse. We provide statistically significant evidence for the action of both positive
and negative selection in both rodent and primate lineages, and reveal the putatively functional sites within the
peptide structures that have been subject to these forces at
different times.

Results
A neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was constructed from the 97
aligned mouse and primate amino acid sequences using
p-distance estimates (Figure 1; full branch length and
bootstrapping support annotation for this tree are available in Additional Files). This tree and an alignment of
nucleotide sequences derived from the protein alignment
(see supplementary material in Additional Files) were
used in the analyses that follow. It should be noted that all
21 mouse genes analysed here are readily detectable on

Phylogenetic tree relating primate and mouse βdefensin proteins constructed using neighbour-joining. Branches with less than 50% bootstrap support have
been collapsed. Species and families of interest are coloured
as follows: mouse sequences are red, human sequences are
dark blue, Hominidae other than human are light blue, Cercopithecidae are purple the Hylobatidae are green and the
Callitrichidae are yellow. Primate species names are abbreviated as detailed in Materials and Methods, mouse genes are
in lower case. Branches labelled with letters show significant
(P < 0.0001) evidence of positive selection (see Figure 3 and
Additional Files 3 and 4 details) and asterisks indicate
branches showing significant (P < 0.0001) evidence for negative selection.

the orthologous rat chromosome 16 and that apparently
mouse specific clades in Figure 1 are therefore likely to be
rodent specific. Orthologs of the genes within all rodent
specific clades in the tree (Defb37/38/39/40, Defb2/9/10/
11, Defb7/8, Defb3/5 and Defb6) were not detectable in
searches of the whole genome shotgun sequence data for
the dog genome. (Rat and dog genes were not analysed in
detail due to the gapped and potentially misassembled
nature of these draft genomes.) In contrast orthologs of all
8 primate genes were readily detectable in the dog genome
sequence data (implying that they are more than 90 million years old), which supports the conclusion that the
apparently rodent specific clades have indeed arisen more
recently in the rodent lineage.
Positive selection has acted in both primate and rodent
lineages
Significant evidence of selection was sought using three
different programs: PAML, ADAPTSITE and SWAPSC.
Three pairs of PAML site-specific likelihood models were
compared that assume variable selective pressure (as
determined by the value of ω) among sites: M0 (oneratio) and M3 (discrete), M1 (neutral) and M2 (selection),
and M7 (beta) and M8 (beta&.). The M3 model (allowing
variation in ω between two site classes) was a significantly
better fit to the data than M0 (allowing no variation in ω)
with the LRT statistic as follows: 2∆l = 2(-3468.13 -(3260.32) = 415.62, P < 0.0001 with 2 degrees of freedom
(df). However subsequent Bayesian analysis failed to
identify any sites under positive selection with greater
than 95% confidence. The LRT between M1 and M2 failed
to show a significant difference in fit to the data. Model
M7 assumes a beta distribution for ω over 10 categories of
sites. The beta distribution is limited to values between 0
and 1 providing the most flexible null hypothesis, and
most stringent test, for testing positive selection. Model
M8 adds another site class to the M7 model, within which
ω is estimated from the data. The M8 model suggested
that a small proportion of sites were under strong positive
selection (ω = 21.82), but again no specific sites were
implicated as under positive selection in the subsequent
Bayesian analysis (95% threshold). An LRT showed that
the M8 model allowing positive selection was a significantly better fit to the data than M7: 2∆l = 2(-3260.66 -(3253.50) = 16.32, P < 0.001 with 2 degrees of freedom
(df). In addition, M8 was the best fit to the data of all 6
site-specific models tested. These somewhat equivocal
results are not unexpected for this data set. It is known
that these LRTs suffer from a lack of power to detect significant effects when divergence between sequences in the
data set is low [15]. The levels of divergence between
many of the primate sequences in this data set are often
very low, and occasionally zero. Nevertheless the LRTs
suggested that the best description of these data is a model
incorporating many categories of variable ω including one

showing positive selection. However, using this dataset,
PAML could not confidently (i.e. at greater than 95% confidence) suggest the particular sites subject to positive
selection. An earlier analysis of the 8 paralogous human βdefensins alone (and therefore based upon a set of
sequences with higher average pairwise divergence), and
using the same LRTs, demonstrated significant evidence
for the operation of positive selection and 9 sites were
nominated in more than one model [10]. The locations of
these sites are shown in Figure 4.
To complement the analysis of Semple et al. [10] the same
site-specific LRTs were applied to an alignment of the
mouse genes alone. In each case the models consistent
with the presence of sites under positive selection were
significantly better fits to the data than the paired null
models. M3 was a better fit to the data than M0 with an
LRT statistic 2∆l = 2(-2716.01 -(-2563.54)) = 304.94 and
P < 0.001 with 2 df. M2 was a better fit to the data than
M1: 2∆l = 2(-2603.43 -(-2569.69) = 67.50 and P < 0.001
with 2 df. M8 was a better fit to the data than M7: 2∆l =
2(-2575.43 -(-2559.81) = 31.25, P < 0.001 with 2 df.
Again, M8 was the best fit to the data of all 6 site-specific
models tested. In summary, these LRTs indicated that ω
varies significantly between sites among these mouse
genes, and in every LRT the parameters estimated suggested a substantial proportion of sites are under positive
selection. The parameters estimated were fairly consistent,
with ω estimated to be between 1.84 and 3.68 and with
this positive selection acting upon 34–50% of sites. Seven
particular sites were consistently implicated (in M2, M3
and M8 models) as being under positive selection (Figure
4) with greater than 95% confidence.
The ADAPTSITE analysis of these data was in general
agreement with the LRT results described above: all three
approaches (maximum parsimony, distance-based and
maximum likelihood) estimated a minority of sites (1–
5% in primate sequences and 2–8% in mouse) where dN
> dS. However only the likelihood approach yielded statistically significant evidence for positively selected sites
(1% in primate sequences and 8% in mouse). This may be
explicable by the greater sensitivity of the likelihood
approach [21]. All three ADAPTSITE approaches showed
significant evidence for negative selection in a minority
(3–5% in primate sequences and 0–8% in mouse) of sites.
The general picture that emerges from the ADAPTSITE
analysis suggests that positive selection has been more
important than negative selection in mouse lineages and
that the opposite is true of primate lineages.
The SWAPSC sliding window analysis of all mouse and
primate data also broadly reflected the LRT results: the
data set was estimated to contain sites subject to a wide
range of ω values, including a small number under

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/32

positive selection. Specifically 0.77% of the sites were estimated to be subject to positive selection and 1.15% to
negative selection. The branches identified as under positive and negative selection are indicated in Figure 1 and
reveal the dynamic evolutionary history of this locus. Of
the 8 primate genes examined, positive selection has
played a role in the evolution of 6 and negative selection
has acted upon all 8. However the 21 genes at the orthologous rodent locus appear to have less turbulent histories,
with 10 and 4 genes subject to positive and negative selection respectively. This leaves 7 mouse genes lacking significant evidence of either positive or negative selection. It is
also notable that the majority (7/11) of mouse genes that
have experienced detectable selection belong to apparently rodent specific clades in Figure 1 (clades containing
rodent genes not present in the human genome or in the
whole genome shotgun sequence data for the dog
genome).
Selection in β-defensins varies spatially and temporally
The branches in the tree in Figure 1 can be divided into
three categories: (i) primate branches (i.e. those relating
only primate orthologs that diverged ~5–40 million years
ago); (ii) rodent branches (i.e. those among rodent genes
that diverged ~12–24 million years ago (MYA) but absent
from the human and dog genomes); (iii) more ancient
branches (i.e. those leading to clades containing primate
and rodent genes or those leading to primate clades that
possess rodent or dog orthologs indicating events ~40–92
million years ago). Figure 2A provides an overview of the
evolutionary dynamics within these three broad
categories according to SWAPSC. It is clear that the selective episodes affecting primate genes have involved relatively low values of ω with many periods of negative
selection while those affecting rodent genes have spanned
a broader range of ω with few episodes of negative selection. More ancient branches seem to have involved the
highest values of ω, which is consistent with the view that
the early stages of duplication and diversification among
mammalian β-defensin paralogs involved strong selection. The later stages of evolution within mammalian
groups, and particularly primates, seem to have involved
less innovation. Figure 2B shows that the focus of most
positive selection in rodent and ancient branches but also
of negative selection in primate branches has been the first
~120 bp of the alignment. These first 40 amino acids
include the alpha helix and first beta strand of the mature
defensin peptide [24].

SWAPSC analysis suggests that in both primate and
rodent lineages there have been episodes of selection in
historically consecutive branches that have affected the
same regions of these genes. For example in the primate
lineage there was an episode of positive selection ~40–92
MYA (branch E in Figure 1) which was followed by an

Alignment of human and mouse β-defensin peptides showing sites of selection
Alignment of human and mouse β-defensin peptides showing sites of selection. Sites of significant positive and negative selection (according to SWAPSC, PAML and ADAPTSITE) in primate and mouse lineages are indicated by asterisks.
Hashes indicate every tenth position in the alignment. Hominidae, Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae and Callitrichidae are abbreviated to Hom, Cer, Hyl and Cal respectively. The positions of the beta strands and alpha helix in DEFB1 are indicated, the residues within the prepropeptide region are those before the alpha helix. The horizontal lines under the alignment denote the
results of different analyses: SWAPSC results for primate and mouse lineages individually, SWAPSC sites under positive and
negative selection in different branches within primates (Primate +/-) and mouse (Mouse +/-), PAML results for sites under
positive selection, ADAPTSITE results for sites under positive an negative selection, sites implicated as under positive selection
by two or more different programs for primate (Primate ++ and Primate --) and mouse (Mouse ++ and Mouse--) lineages.

episode of negative selection within the past ~14.5 million years (MY), with both episodes affecting positions
109–117 in the alignment. Similarly, a burst of positive
selection during the evolution of the common ancestor of
primate and rodent DEFB1 (branch Q in Figure 1) was followed by negative selection at the same site (positions
94–102 of the alignment) within the past 8.09 MY of primate evolution. Primate evolution has also been marked
by bouts of recurring negative selection at the same site,
most clearly in the case of DEFB105. Here a site (positions
55–63 in the alignment) within the alpha helix has been
subject to negative selection on four occasions during the
divergence of old world monkeys (OWM) from H. sapiens
and P. troglodytes. This contrasts with the rodent lineage
where only consecutive bursts of positive selection are
seen to affect the same sites. Within the rodent specific
clade containing Defb38/39/40 two different sites are
affected by positive selection, and each site has been targeted by selection at two points during their evolutionary
past: positions 31–39 in the prepropeptide region at
branches N and K; positions 109–120 in the second beta
strand at branches L and M.
Sites of ancient and relatively recent selection
SWAPSC found statistically significant support for positive and negative selection at many sites. Figure 3 shows
the raw data graphed for two of the branches (the most
recent and oldest in the tree) demonstrating significant
evidence for positive selection (Figure 1). For each branch
the Ka and Ks measured at successive 3 codon windows
are shown. These graphs make clear that the sites of positive and negative selection identified as significant are
likely to be a subset of those actually subject to these
forces in reality. Figure 3 is also typical of the results
obtained for relatively recent and older branches (Figures
for all other branches showing significant selection are
available in Additional Files.) The recent branch shows
the changes between the last common ancestor of C. aethiops (vervet monkey) DEFB106 and P. anubis (olive
baboon) DEFB106 and DEFB106 in C. aethiops. Most
regions of the molecule show little or no changes, as
expected over ~9.62 MY but two consecutive windows (bp
40–48 and 43–51) demonstrate a significant excess of Ka
over Ks. The older branch shows changes between the last
common ancestor of all primate DEFB1 and mouse Defb1
sequences and the ancestral primate DEFB1 sequence.
This older branch concerns events ~40–92 MYA and
shows greater variation in Ka and Ks across the sequences,
though only two regions show significant evidence for
positive selection (bp 4–12 and 67–75) and a further two
for negative selection (bp 28–42 and 160–168). There are
many sites such as this where selection is detected similarly in all or most lineages, reflecting more ancient events
in mammalian evolution. All except one of the conserved
cysteine residues are implicated as being under negative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/32

selection in both primate and mouse lineages. Similarly, a
small region at the extreme N terminal of the mature peptides (positions 2–4 in Figure 4) was found to be under
positive selection in primate and mouse lineages. However certain regions of these molecules have experienced
positive and negative selection in different lineages. Arguably it is these sites, where selection has at one time
favoured a change but at another required stasis, that are
likely to be most potent in altering the functions of these
proteins. These sites mainly cluster at a central region of
the mature peptides (positions 36–40 in Figure 4),
although other sites, often those neighbouring cysteine
residues (positions 13–14, 24–25, 33 and 55–56), appear
to have been subject to such opposing selection.
ADAPTSITE (using a likelihood approach) also nominated sites showing significant evidence of positive and
negative selection and these can be compared with those
nominated by SWAPSC and by PAML run separately on
mouse and primate datasets (Figure 4). However there are
no sites in primates and only three in mouse (positions
21, 33 and 37 in Figure 4) where all three programs show
evidence for positive selection. This lack of agreement
between all three programs is perhaps unsurprising considering the different restrictions of each analysis.
SWAPSC can find lineage-specific events but relies on
many simulated datasets to assess significance and lacks
the single site resolution of the other two programs. PAML
was restricted here to examining selective episodes
between paralogs and does not test for significant evidence of negative selection. ADAPTSITE results are only
reliable for alignments positions with more than 15
nucleotide differences [21]. In addition both ADAPTSITE
and PAML do not consider gapped positions in the alignment, whereas SWAPSC will if the gap is absent from the
lineage under examination. Perhaps most importantly
both the PAML and ADAPTSITE analyses discussed here
examine site-specific events across the whole alignment
under scrutiny, effectively averaging over lineages. Figure
4 shows the level of agreement between any pair of programs and appears to indicate only modest agreement
between them on the location of sites under positive
selection. Most of the positively selected primate sites (5/
9) and mouse sites (7/7) implicated by PAML are also
supported by either SWAPSC or ADAPTSITE. Similarly
most of the positively selected primate sites (2/2) and
mouse sites (14/18) implicated by ADAPTSITE are supported by at least one of the other programs. Following
the logic of Podlaha and Zhang [22] such sites, supported
by more than one independent analysis, are the most reliably inferred. However, this assertion assumes that the
three methods used are similarly informative for the
present dataset. Significant heterogeneity between the
results of the three methods might indicate they are not. A
heterogeneity G-test [23] was used to assess uniformity

Page 8 of 14

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/32

between the outcomes of the three tests (SWAPSC, PAML
and ADAPTSITE) for positive selection. The numbers of
sites predicted to be positively selected (per 10 residue
interval across the alignment in Figure 4) were counted. It
was necessary to consider all positively selected sites predicted for mouse and primate data together, and to collapse the first and final intervals to create intervals
containing sufficient numbers of predicted sites (i.e.
greater than zero). This calculation indicates that GH =
11.86 with 6 degrees of freedom which is not significant.
Thus although the results of the three tests for positive
selection used do not agree perfectly there is no significant
heterogeneity between them.
Structural implications of evolutionary history for βdefensin peptides
It has been shown that primate and murine β-defensins
share striking similarity at the level of secondary and tertiary structure, in spite of very low levels of sequence similarity [26]. The most reliably inferred sites of selection in
Figure 4 (those implicated by more than one different
method) were mapped to the known structures of the
human DEFB1 and the mouse Defb7 mature peptides to
examine differences in the distribution of these sites
between primate and rodent lineages (Figure 5). As discussed above, there are more sites demonstrating positive
selection in the murine defensins as compared to the primate defensins (Figure 4). However some clear similarities between the positions of positively selected sites are
evident on the murine and primate structures (Figure 5).
It seems that sites within the triple beta-strand so characteristic of these peptides are largely unaffected by positive
selection. The few exceptional sites subject to positive
selection found in the triple stranded β-sheets that form
the structural core of the β-defensins, may represent alterations in the oligomerisation of β-defensins (Figure 5).

Figure 5
nificant selection
Structural implications of primate and mouse sites under sigStructural implications of primate and mouse sites
under significant selection. Each site is implicated by two
or more programs from the following three: PAML, ADAPTSITE and SWAPSC. Primate sites were mapped to the structure of the human DEFB1 mature peptide (A) and mouse
sites to the structure of the mouse Defb7 mature peptide
(B). Sites subject to selection are depicted as inflated regions
of the structures coloured red to indicate positive selection.
The particular residues in DEFB1 and Defb7 corresponding
to positively selected sites are also indicated with arrows. Ala
(marked with an asterisk) is subject to negative and positive
selection in different primate lineages.

Both primate and rodent lineages show a large number of
sites subject to positive selection within the N-terminal
portion of the mature peptide. Two sites for both primate
and murine, were located within a region which in DEFB1
and Defb7 forms an alpha helix. Since regions of proteins
within membranes are often helical, with surfaces covered
with hydrophobic resides, we speculate that the alpha helical section may be involved in anchoring the β-defensin
to a bacterial cell wall. Thus the sites within the alpha
helix under positive selection may be significant in the
specificity of β-defensins, either with respect to their antimicrobial or chemoattractant properties. The longest loop
region of these peptides (indicated to the right on Figure
5) also contains sites of positive selection. For the murine
form this loop is almost exclusively subject to high selection, which suggests that this part of the structure has a key
functional role in these small peptides. If, as shown for the
β-defensin HNP3 [27] the second beta-strand is involved

Page 9 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:32

in oligerimisation, many of these sites would all be left
exposed after dimer formation, suggesting an rapidly
diverging exposed 'skirt' around the peptide. This is confimed by the NMR data of Schibli et al. [25] whose structures of the human β-defensin DEFB3 suggest symmetrical
dimer formation, through the beta strand 2 of the β-sheet.
Some sites found to be subject to positive selection in
rodents (see Figure 4) are not represented in Figure 5 as
they are part of the N-terminal prepropeptide region that
is removed to produce the mature peptide. This contrasts
with studies of α-defensins which have found an absence
of positively selected sites in the prepropeptide region
[24]. In primate lineages sites within the prepropeptide
region have undergone negative selection (Figure 4).
These observations strongly imply that the prepropeptide
region is more important to β-defensin function than has
previously been appreciated.

Discussion
The present data demonstrated evidence for positive and
negative selection in different branches but at overlapping
regions of the same molecules. It is clear that in such a
case the use of site specific LRTs (effectively averaging
across the branches of a tree) may have little power to
detect the sites involved. A combined approach, using
such LRTs with an independent method (SWAPSC) examining each branch individually has previously been
employed in an analysis of α-defensins [24]. Here we have
extended this approach to examine ancient and more
recent events in primate β-defensin evolution.
It is thought that positive selection may play a major role
in the divergence of paralogues from one another following a duplication event [28]. In agreement with this many
of the more ancient selective episodes detected here
appear to date back to the birth of these genes by duplication at an ancestral mammalian locus. However it is striking that later episodes of positive selection often focus on
sites overlapping those subject to the more ancient events,
particularly in the rodent lineage. This suggests that many
of the same sites that originally conferred specificity of
function upon these peptides were altered to provide
novel functions many millions of years later. Although in
the primate lineage it would appear that the original episodes of positive selection following duplication were
usually followed by negative selection.
Boniotto et al. [13] found some evidence for positive
selection in human DEFB4 during the divergence of primate species. They reported several residues of interest in
the mature peptide where substitutions were observed in
primate groups other than the great apes. These N-terminal residues are concerned with oligomerisation in the
human peptide and they suggested that a particular form

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/32

of oligomerisation might have evolved in apes and
humans. We detected no significant positive selection in
DEFB4 since the divergence of the same primate groups,
although our analysis is conservative. However the only
statistical evidence presented by Boniotto et al. [13] to
support their hypothesis that DEFB4 is subject to positive
selection was a Z-test, which is not stringent enough for
short sequences such as these.
A consequence of the more rigorous statistical analyses to
which we subject the sequences described here is that we
may miss real episodes of positive selection. Antcheva et
al. [29] synthesised variant molecules based on their
observation that DEFB4 (formerly DEFB2) has been subject to positive selection during the divergence of various
primate lineages. They synthesised the M. fascicularis
DEFB4 orthologue ("mfaBD2") and a variant of the
human peptide lacking Asp(4), ("-D)hBD2", which is
characteristic only of the human/great ape peptides. hBD2
and mfaBD2 showed a significant difference in specificity,
the former being more active towards Escherichia coli and
the later towards Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Asp(4) in the human peptide appears to be important, as (-D)hBD2 was less structured and had a markedly
lower antimicrobial activity but this site was not identified
as being subject to positive selection here. A clear but
unexpected result of the present analyses was that the preproregion has been subject to significant positive selection in rodents and negative selection in primates. This
has not been observed previously. It is commonly
assumed that the preproregion is cleaved as the mature
peptide is secreted from the cell. We conclude that further
investigations of cleavage and the functional consequences of sequence changes in this region are merited.

Conclusions
We have used a combination of maximum likelihood
based tests and a maximum parsimony based sliding window approach to give the most statistically rigorous and
detailed view of the selective history at the major primate
β-defensin locus. These data shed light on the evolution of
human innate immunity but also have practical applications in the design of novel antibiotics. Sites within the
active, mature peptides have been subject to repeated
episodes of selection in different primate lineages, and by
implication are important in functional diversity. Additional sites within the prepropeptide region, which is
cleaved before secretion, were also subject to selection
suggesting a previously unappreciated functional significance of this region.

All mouse sequences were recently published by Zaballos
et al. [30]. The H. sapiens and P. anubis sequences were as
previously published [10]. Previously published sequence
data for primate DEFB1 [11], DEFB4 [13] and DEFB103
[12] were combined with the following novel data. Whole
genome shotgun reads from the M. mulatta genome representing DEFB104 (69840222, 73807150), DEFB105
(73492526, 74381588, 72060044) and DEFB108

were obtained from Ensembl in the same way for
DEFB105
(AADA01159356)
and
DEFB107
(AADA01159356). The published Rattus norvegicus (rat)

[31] with default settings.
PCR of novel second exon sequences from P. anubis, C.
aethiops, P. pygmaeus,C. jacchus DNA was achieved using
primers designed to the human exon 2 flanking sequence.
PCR programmes were used with a relaxed annealing temperature that revealed a single species by gel electrophoresis. PCR products were cloned and several clones were
analysed for each PCR. At least two clones were sequenced
in both directions. Primers were as follows with forward

Phylogenetic inference and evolutionary analyses
Protein sequences were aligned using T-Coffee [33]. An
alignment of coding sequences corresponding to the protein alignment was constructed using the tranalign program from the EMBOSS package [34]. A phylogenetic tree
was constructed using MEGA (version 2.1 [35]) by the
neighbour joining (NJ) method [36] using p-distance estimates, which is thought to be the most reliable method
for constructing NJ trees of closely related sequences [37].
The tree was rooted with chicken gallinacin 1 (P46156)
and the reliability of each node was assessed with 1000
bootstrap replications. All of the best supported branches
(>= 50% of replications) were also observed in an equivalent NJ tree constructed with the gamma distribution
model implemented to account for rate heterogeneity
among sites. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution (α) was estimated using baseml from the PAML package (version 3.13 [38]). The same alignment was used as
the basis for trees constructed by maximum parsimony
(using MEGA version 2.1 with default settings) and maximum likelihood (using PHYLIP version 3.6 [39] with
default settings). In both cases the trees produced shared
substantively similar topology with the NJ trees. (All trees
are available on demand.) Nodes within the primate lineage were dated according to a widely accepted phylogenetic analysis [40]. The divergence of rat and mouse was
taken to be 12–24 MYA [32] and the last common ancestor of mammals was assumed to be 92 MYA [41].

Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) were performed using
codeml with the site-specific models of the PAML package
and the tree constructed as above. The six site-specific
models recommended by Anisimova et al. [15] were
tested: M0 (one-ratio), M1 (neutral), M2 (selection), M3
(discrete), M7 (beta), and M8 (beta+ω). These LRTs indicate whether the substitutions inferred from an alignment
are best explained by one of two models of ω = dN/dS,
where dN and dS are the nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates respectively. When parameter
estimates under a model allowing positive selection suggest the presence of a number of sites with ω > 1, Bayes
theorem was used to calculate the posterior probability
that a given site is one of those that are selected [38]. It is
worth noting that PAML LRTs are reported to be conservative for short sequences, though the Bayesian prediction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/32

of sites under positive selection is largely unaffected by
sequence length [15].

to ensure that these sites were not saturated at any branch
of the tree.

Concerns have been raised over the reliability of particular
sites inferred to be subject to positive selection using
PAML [19] and so corroborating evidence was sought
from independent methods. Evidence for positively and
negatively selected sites was sought using ADAPTSITE
(version 1.3) according to the procedure recommended
by Suzuki [21]. Specifically, equal equilibrium codon
frequencies were assumed, an NJ tree based upon p-distance was used as above but was unrooted, the transition/
transversion rate ratio was taken to be 1.02 for both primate and mouse datasets (estimated using MEGA) and
the significance level for detecting selection was 5%. All
three approaches accommodated within ADAPTSITE were
employed: maximum parsimony, a distance-based Bayesian method and maximum likelihood. The maximum
likelihood analysis was run with two different initial values of ω (0.00001 and 1) to ensure the results were robust
to such differences, and only sites where the estimated
number of nucleotide substitutions was greater than 15
were considered [21]. The selection operating in different
regions of the sequences and within different branches of
the phylogenetic tree under study were also estimated
using SWAPSC with 1000 simulated data sets [20]. This
program uses the differences between the estimated and
expected numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitutions to evaluate various hypotheses [42]. Firstly it
seeks evidence for regions that have suffered the saturation of synonymous sites: where the number of synonymous substitutions is significantly smaller than expected.
In addition it seeks mutational hotspots: regions where
the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions are greater than expected under neutrality. Remaining regions where the number of
nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions is smaller than
expected (or where ω is significantly smaller than the
mean ω estimated for the alignment) are identified as
under negative selection. Positive selection is inferred
where the estimated number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions is greater than expected by chance and
where ω is significantly greater than 1. Where regions have
an estimated number of nonsynonymous substitutions
greater than expected but ω < 1 or where ω > 1 but there is
evidence for saturation of synonymous sites such regions
are said to have accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitutions. Thus SWAPSC seeks to avoid inferring positive
selection where there is insufficient data to support it or
where saturation may cause bias. A by-product of the
SWAPSC analysis is substitution rate estimates for all
branches of the tree under study, within overlapping 3
codon windows across the alignment. Each site identified
by PAML or ADAPSITE as subject to selection was checked
against the synonymous rate estimates made by SWAPSC

Structural analysis
In order to establish the relevance of these finding to the
solution structure of murine-defensins, we mapped the
adaptive sites onto the nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) structures of mouse Defb7 [26] and human
DEFB1 [25]. For each structures were downloaded as PDB
files from the Brookhaven protein databank, http://
www.rcsb.org/pdb. The structures were viewed using
VMD http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/.
