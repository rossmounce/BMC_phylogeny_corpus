Abstract
Background: In teleosts, the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and class II
molecules reside on different linkage groups as opposed to tetrapods and shark, where the class I
and class II genes reside in one genomic region. Several teleost MHC class I regions have been
sequenced and show varying number of class I genes. Salmonids have one major expressed MHC
class I locus (UBA) in addition to varying numbers of non-classical genes. Two other more distant
lineages are also identifyed denoted L and ZE. For class II, only one major expressed class II alpha
(DAA) and beta (DAB) gene has been identified in salmonids so far.
Results: We sequenced a genomic region of 211 kb encompassing divergent MHC class II alpha
(Sasa-DBA) and beta (Sasa-DBB) genes in addition to NRGN, TIPRL, TBCEL and TECTA. The region
was not linked to the classical class II genes and had some synteny to genomic regions from other
teleosts. Two additional divergent and expressed class II sequences denoted DCA and DDA were
also identified in both salmon and trout. Expression patterns and lack of polymorphism make these
genes non-classical class II analogues. Sasa-DBB, Sasa-DCA and Sasa-DDA had highest expression
levels in liver, hindgut and spleen respectively, suggestive of distinctive functions in these tissues.
Phylogenetic studies revealed more yet undescribed divergent expressed MHC class II molecules
also in other teleosts.
Conclusion: We have characterised one genomic region containing expressed non-classical MHC
class II genes in addition to four other genes not involved in immune function. Salmonids contain
at least two expressed MHC class II beta genes and four expressed MHC class II alpha genes with
properties suggestive of new functions for MHC class II in vertebrates. Collectively, our data
suggest that the class II is worthy of more elaborate studies also in other teleost species.

Background
Teleost fish are the largest group of vertebrates comprising
almost half of the total living vertebrates. In tetrapods and
sharks the major histocompatibility genes are linked in a
complex on a single chromosome [1]. In all teleosts studied so far, including salmonids, the MHC class I and class

II regions reside on different linkage groups [2-4]. Extensive studies of the genomic class I region has been conducted in several fish species including rainbow trout and
Atlantic salmon [5-9]. The Atlantic salmon and rainbow
trout genomes encode one major MHC class I locus designated UBA with additional non-classical MHC class I

genes in two duplicated MHC class I regions [7,9]. Both
regions also harbour genes involved in the antigen presentation pathway, including proteosome subunits and the
transporter for antigen processing. These genes all reside
in the class II region in mammals [10].
Genomic class II regions are described in detail in
zebrafish [11] and stickleback [12]. In zebrafish, one class
II alpha locus and a number of class II beta loci residing
on two different linkage groups have previously been
identified, where only the DAA and DAB loci are known
to be expressed [13]. Analysis of the functional class II
region in zebrafish showed close linkage of the DAA and
DAB loci on chromosome 8, but lack of other genes residing in the human MHC region [14]. In stickleback, a 99.5
kb genomic segment contained a tandem duplicate of
expressed MHC class II alpha and beta genes, designated
Gaac-DAA/DAB and Gaac-DBA/DBB. In Atlantic salmon,
the major MHC class II alpha and beta genes are designated DAA and DAB respectively. They are closely linked
and cosegregate as functional haplotypes [3,15-18]. Both
the class II alpha as well as the class II beta chains have
polymorphic alpha 1 and beta 1 domains [15,19],
although much less polymorphic than the class I alpha 1
domain [3].
In humans, there are three classical expressed class II loci
denoted HLA-DP, DQ and DR. Two additional nonclassical expressed MHC class II molecules, HLA-DM and HLADO, are found to control the composition of the peptide
repertoire displayed by MHC class II molecules on the cell
surface of antigen presenting cells [20]. The nonclassical
class II molecule HLA-DM regulates unloading of CLIP
and loading of peptide onto classical MHC class II molecules [21]. CLIP is derived from the invariant chain (Ii)
and functions as a chaperone for class II molecules as it
mediates and maintains correct assembly of alpha beta
dimers. HLA-DM also serves as a peptide editor in early
endocytic compartments [22]. HLA-DO preferentially
promotes peptide loading of MHC class II molecules that
are dependent on the chaperone activity of DM, and influences editing in a positive way for some peptides and negatively for others [23]. In terms of polymorphism, HLADO and HLA-DM are generally unpolymorphic in contrast to the three classical expressed loci HLA-DP, DQ and
DR [24,25].

Reports on non-classical MHC class II molecules in teleosts have so far been scarce, although sequences with low
identity to their classical DAB counterparts have been
described in Xiphophorus fishes and in the guppy Poecilia
reticulata [26]. The aim of this study was to analyse the
MHC class II situation in Atlantic salmon through low
stringency screening of available BAC libraries using classical DAA and DAB probes. Here we describe the genomic
organization and expression patterns of two Atlantic
salmon nonclassical MHC class II genes. Through phylogenetic and comparative analyses we also uncover additional nonclassical MHC class II molecules.

Results and discussion
An Atlantic salmon BAC library [27] screened at low stringency with radioactive labeled probes for MHC class IIα
(DAA) and class IIβ (DAB) hybridized to 20 BAC clones
(Table 1). The clones were ordered into one DAA and one
DAB contig by restriction fragment analysis and southern
hybridization. Some DAB positive BACs contained unstable inserts, displaying several deletions during restriction
mapping. GRASP HindIII fingerprint information [28]
confirmed our DAA contig, while DAB clones were placed
in different contigs or identified as singletons potentially
due to their unstable nature.
To decipher between classical DAA/DAB-positive BACs
and other potential class II BACs we tested both genomic
DNA from the library fish as well as MHC class II positive
BACs for presence of a class II alpha minisatellite marker
residing in the 3'UTR of Sasa-DAA. Classical MHC class II
alpha and beta alleles cosegregate as haplotypes in Atlantic salmon [15] and most haplotypes show a stable linkage between haplotype and class II alpha 3'UTR marker.
The BAC library fish was homozygous for a marker previously shown to segregate with the DAA*0101-DAB*0801
haplotype [15]. None of the DAA or DAB positive BACs
were positive for the marker, suggesting they potentially
represented new MHC class II loci while the classical
MHC class II region was not present in the BAC library.
Due to the confusing fingerprints analysis and deletions
in the DAB positive BACs, they were not considered for
full-sequencing. Among the DAA positive BACs, clone
630N19 had a centered DAA-positive fragment (data not
shown), and was thus subjected to shotgun sequencing.
Readings were assembled with a redundancy greater than

10 over 211,190 bp [GenBank: EU008541]. One gap in
the BAC clone 630N19 sequence still remains due to a
small repeat region (~100 bp) eluding sequencing. The
gap is located 2 kb in from the T7 end and has been verified by PCR using flanking primers.
Dotplot analysis of 630N19 against itself showed no
extended regions of local similarity (data not shown). The
overall G+C content of the complete sequence was 43.5%.
Analysis of the complete sequence with Repeatmasker
unveiled 2 SINEs and 69 other repeats. Repeat elements
occupied 2.08% of the entire genomic sequence. Using a
salmonid repeat-specific database, appr. 20% of the BAC
contained repeats [29]. A total of 20 ORFs were identified
within the 211 kb sequence where all but six had sequence
similarity to transposable elements or other repeats.
Linkage analysis using the 3'UTR marker of classical MHC
class II gene Sasa-DAA and a marker identified in the
630N19 BAC sequence showed that the two regions are
unlinked with Sasa-DAA residing on linkage group 6 and
the 630N19 marker on linkage group 5 (T.Moen, Akvaforsk, pers.com).
Gene Content and Organization
The BAC encompassed six genes with homology to MHC
class II alpha, MHC class II beta, NRGN (Neurogranin),
TIPRL (TIP41, TOR signalling pathway regulator-like),
TBCEL (Tubulin folding cofactor E-like) and TECTA (Tectorin alpha) (Fig. 1). The MHC class II alpha and beta
related loci had low sequence identity to classical SasaDAA and Sasa-DAB sequences, and were thus designated
Sasa-DBA and Sasa-DBB as suggested by R.J.M.Stet (The
MHC Nomenclature Committee, pers.com). The Neurogranin domain family is the human homolog of the neuron-specific rat RC3/neurogranin gene. This gene encodes
a postsynaptic protein kinase substrate that binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium [30]. The TIP41 domain
family belongs to the TOR signalling pathway that acti-

NRGN

TIPRL

vates a cell-growth program in response to nutrients in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae [31], where TIP41 interacts with
TAP42 and negatively regulates the TOR signalling pathway. TIP41 homologs are found in vertebrates, but very
little information on its function is described. All the
above mentioned genes have matching Atlantic salmon
ESTs (Table 2).
Only rainbow trout EST matches were found for the
TBCEL gene (Table 2). TBCEL is a novel regulator of tubulin stability with overexpression causing depolymerization of microtubules and suppression resulting in an
increase in the number of stable microtubules [32]. No
perfect EST match was found for TECTA, but mouse
TECTA is expressed during early ontogeny and such libraries are not available for salmonids yet. The Atlantic
salmon TECTA protein contained several conserved
domains with identical organization to mammalian
TECTA molecules (Fig. 2) [33,34]. An extracellular
domain (NIDO) of unknown function is found in
nidogen (entactin). The von Willebrand factor type D
domains (VWD) are blood glycoprotein domains that are
required for normal hemostasis. The domain of unknown
function denoted as C8 contains 8 conserved cysteine residues and is found in disease-related proteins such as von
Willebrand factor, Alpha tectorin, Zonadhesin and Mucin
molecules. The trypsin inhibitor-like cysteine rich
domains (TIL) are found in many extracellular proteins.
The zona pellucida (ZP) domain is found responsible for
sperm-adhesion and is present in multidomain transmembrane proteins such as glycoprotein GP2, uromodulin and TGF-beta receptor type III.
Comparison of salmonid MHC class II sequences
The DBA sequence showed 46% amino acid (aa)
sequence identity when compared to Sasa-DAA*0101.
Further UniGene and EST database searches identified

alpha-like sequences which we denoted DCA and DDA
(Fig. 3). Amino acid sequence identity within tentative
locus ranged from 85 to 93% across species while identity
between all salmonid class II alpha sequences ranged
from 39 to 61% both across loci and species.
All Atlantic salmon alpha 1 domains, except Sasa-DDA,
contained cysteines potentially involved in formation of
disulphide bridges (Fig. 3). The rainbow trout Onmy-DBA
and Onmy-DDA sequences are partial ESTs disrupting further comparison. A distinct feature of the Sasa-DBA
sequence is a unique 7 aa insertion at aa position 41–47,
not seen in any of the other salmonid alpha 1 domains.
This insertion probably influences which cysteines are
involved in formation of disulphide bridges. The salmonid alpha 2 domains contained cysteines at positions 121
and 177 potentially involved in formation of disulphide
bridges. Putative N-linked glycosylation sites were found
in the DAA (aa 141–143), DCA (aa 134–136) and DDA
(aa 116–118) sequences, but not in the DBA sequence.
The Sasa-DBB locus showed 49% amino acid sequence
identity when compared to Sasa-DAB*0201. Full-length
sequencing of the DBB-matching EST clone [Genbank:
DV106186] was performed by primer walking. Rainbow
trout sequences denoted Onmy-DBB as locus definition
name was available in Genbank, but sequence identity in
the beta2 domain suggested this may be an Onmy-DAB
allele rather than a new locus (Fig. 4). EST database
searches for other salmonid DBB-like sequences were not
successful. All salmonid beta-1 domains contained
cysteines at positions 10 and 75 potentially involved in
formation of a disulphide bridge (Fig. 4) and have a puta-

tive N-linked glycosylation site at aa 37–39. The Sasa-DBB
sequence had an additionally N-linked glycosylation site
at position 84–86. The salmonid beta-2 domains contained cysteines at positions 113 and 169, while the SasaDBB sequence had an additional N-linked glycosylation
site at positions 94–96. Looking at the CP/CYT/TM
region, the Sasa-DBB sequence had a 12 aa additional Cterminal sequence when compared to the other salmonid
MHC class II beta sequences.
In summary, Atlantic salmon harbours at least two divergent MHC class II beta sequences (Sasa-DAB and SasaDBB) and four divergent MHC class II alpha sequences
(Sasa-DAA, Sasa-DBA, Sasa-DCA and Sasa-DDA), which
all share most of the characteristics typical for vertebrate
MHC class II molecules.
Polymorphism and expression of Atlantic salmon MHC
class II molecules
To evaluate the polymorphic content of the BAC genes
Sasa-DBA and Sasa-DBB we compared exon 2 sequences
from 7 unrelated Atlantic salmon for both genes and to all
available matching ESTs. One aa substitution was found
in the Sasa-DBB exon 2 (G/D at pos.72), while no substitutions were found in the Sasa-DBA sequences. As the
included sequences were derived from both Norwegian as
well as Canadian waters, one may assume these genes
have little or no polymorphism analogous to the nonclassical MHC class II genes identified in higher vertebrates.
As for Sasa-DCA and Sasa-DDA, we have not performed
any extensive polymorphic studies, but based on available
EST information these loci contain little or no polymorphism

and underlined, and the unique N-linked glycosylation sites found in salmonids are boxed. Individual domains and regions are
defined based on mammalian class II sequences.

A common feature for all the above described salmonid
MHC class II sequences is their relatively low expression,
based on hits in EST databases, when compared against
their classical expressed counterpart. To investigate the
MHC class II expression patterns, various tissues of
unstimulated Atlantic salmon were analyzed for gene
expression by means of real-time PCR (Fig. 5). Foregut,
hindgut, head kidney, gills, spleen, heart, liver and muscle
tissues were taken from one Atlantic salmon individual,
where muscle represented a non-immunologically active
tissue. EF1A served as the reference gene. The highest SasaDAB expression was detected in spleen, followed by gills,
hindgut and head kidney. Lower Sasa-DAB levels were
observed in heart, liver and foregut with muscle showing
the lowest expression levels. This Sasa-DAB expression

pattern fits with the observations done by Koppang et al.
[35]. Sasa-DBB showed highest expression in liver, followed by spleen, head kidney and heart. Our DBB-matching EST clone [Genbank: DV106186] descend from a liver
cDNA library, confirming the expression of this gene in
liver. Both macrophage and interhepatocytic cell populations have been found in liver of Atlantic salmon [36],
suggestive of an immune function. Lower Sasa-DBB levels
were observed in hindgut, gills and foregut with no detectable expression in muscle. Sasa-DBA showed highest
expression levels in spleen and heart, followed by gills,
muscle, hindgut, head kidney, foregut and liver. The
expression patterns for the DBA and DBB genes were supported with additional semi-quantitative PCR (Fig. 6)
using primers for different regions of the genes. Sasa-DCA

Hindgut of teleosts have a well recognised capacity to take
up antigen [37], an ability that has been related to the
existence of a mucosal immune system in fish. Sasa-DDA
showed a strikingly high expression in spleen. Spleen is a
central organ for antigen display and response, and a
major component of the fish lymphoid system. Lower
Sasa-DDA levels were observed in heart, head kidney,
gills, liver and hindgut with foregut and muscle showing
the lowest expression levels. Based on raw CT values, DDA
expression level in spleen was the only gene with an
expression level comparable to classical DAB expression.
Based on lack of polymorphism and expression patterns
deviating from their classical counterpart Sasa-DAB, the
Sasa-DBA, Sasa-DBB, Sasa-DCA and Sasa-DDA molecules
can be classified as non-classical MHC molecules similar
to mammalian non-classical HLA-DM or HLA-DO molecules and can be involved in catalysis of peptide loading
and stabilization of the classical Sasa-DAA/DAB molecules. However, highest expression of Sasa-DBB and SasaDCA in liver and hindgut respectively, and a Sasa-DDA
expression level in spleen comparable to Sasa-DAB, may

indicate that these molecules have a unique and yet unidentified function in these organs in salmonids.
Phylogenetic analysis of MHC class II related molecules
The phylogenetic relationship between salmon and other
expressed teleosts MHC class II sequences were subjected
to phylogenetic analyses. For MHC class II beta, the
majority of sequences cluster according to phylogeny with
zebrafish, medaka, and salmon as representatives for
cypriniformes, acanthopterygii and salmonids respectively (Fig. 7). The connection between locus and
expressed beta sequences are known for a few species. For
medaka and stickleback, the DAB and DBB represent two
very similar sequences from two different loci [12] suggestive of a recent gene duplication. The rainbow trout DBB
sequence is published as Onmy-DBB although proof of a
duplicated class II beta locus in rainbow trout is lacking.
In zebrafish (Dare), authors have reported a varying
number of class II loci [11,14] although the assumption
has been that Dare-DAA/-DAB was the major expressed
molecule [13]. Based on sequence divergence, the DareDCB and -DDB sequences most likely represent two additional expressed zebrafish class II beta loci. However, lacking knowledge on polymorphic content and expression

profiles hinders definition of these genes as classical or
non-classical. Fathead minnow (Pipr) contains four very
divergent class II beta sequences, but their genomic organization remains to be characterized. Although difficult,
some lineage-specific residues/motifs are noticeable (the
sequence alignments are found in Additional File 1). The
acanthopterygii class II beta sequences contain lineage
specific residues such as the L215, M223, I242, L245,
S248, F252, R257, R260 aa's motif in the COOH- end.
Fewer distinct lineage-spesific residues exist for the
cypriniformes sequences, but the S51, M53 or the I245,
I247 motifs are potential candidates allowing for some
exceptions. Cypriniformes as well as acanthopterygii
sequences share a RILV motif at aa position 262–266.
Six teleost class II beta sequences from zebrafish, stickleback, fathead minnow, xiphophorus and Atlantic salmon
(Sasa-DBB) identified through a thorough database search
show low sequence identity to the above described
sequences. No lineage specific residues are apparent
between these and the above lineages although some residues shared between Sasa-DBB and Ximu-DXB suggest
they have a common ancestor. Both these sequences share
a 132–134 RLE, Y191 and T203 motif in the beta2
domain. The xiphophorus DXB sequence has been
reported as a non-classical sequence [26] while none of
the other EST sequences have been defined as MHC
sequences in the database or in publications. Identifying
expressed MHC class II molecules ease with growing
number of ESTs available as exemplified by zebrafish. A
total of 1.3 million zebrafish EST sequences are available
in Genbank, probably explaining why we now identify
four expressed MHC class II beta loci.

For MHC class II alpha, the majority of sequences also
cluster according to phylogeny with medaka, zebrafish
and salmon as representatives for the acanthopterygii,
cypriniformes, and salmonid clusters respectively (Fig. 8).
Stickleback has two reported class II alpha loci, denoted as
Gaac-DAA and -DAB [12]. If the third stickleback EST
sequence represents a third expressed locus or is an allelic
version of the two reported remains to be established. As
for the class II beta sequences, zebrafish also contains at
least three different expressed class II alpha sequences
most likely representing three different loci. The three different class II alpha sequences for fathead minnow is also
comparable to its four different class II beta sequences. In
addition to their classical DAA sequences, Atlantic salmon
and rainbow trout contain three other class II alpha
sequences, which are much more divergent than the different sequences identified in zebrafish or fathead minnow. The close relationship between the Sasa-DBA and
Sasa-DCA sequences suggest a common ancestral gene. If
Sasa-DDA is a more ancient duplication of the same
ancestral locus, which has evolved away from the SasaDBA and Sasa-DCA sequences, remains to be established.
The genomic location and gene surroundings of the SasaDCA and -DDA loci is currently unknown. As for the beta
sequences, some lineage-specific residues/motifs are
noticeable for the alpha sequences as well (the sequence
alignments are found in Additional File 2). The acanthopterygii class II alpha sequences contain lineage specific residues such as the P82, Q107, I108, S131, V252, E269,
S271 residues shared by most sequences. Lineage specific
residues for the cypriniformes sequences are the D85,
T154, P159, Q180, R182, V225 aa's with a few exceptions.
Lacking lineage specific residues for the duplicated salmonid sequences may suggest ancient duplications or different origin.
As more ESTs are sequenced from teleosts and we move
deeper into each library, more class II loci from more fish
will most likely appear enabling a broader understanding
of their origin and evolution.
Genome evolution and paralagous regions
Beside the major human MHC region on chromosome 6,
paralogous copies of genes from the MHC region have
been found on chromosomes 1, 9 and 19 which are
thought to be derived from two whole genome duplications that occurred in a common ancestor of all vertebrates [38]. Evolutionary analysis of complete genome
sequences from the pufferfish species Tetraodon [39] and
Takifugu [40] suggest that an additional genome duplication occurred early in the teleost lineage [350 million
years ago (Mya)], close to the origin of the teleost fish
themselves. All the fish of the family Salmonidae apparently descended from yet another unique genome duplication event that occurred in the lineage leading to

salmonid fishes 25–100 Mya [41]. Evidence supporting
the unique and relatively "young" salmonid genome
duplication event was found by studying MHC class I
regions in rainbow trout [9] and Atlantic salmon [7].
Here, class IA and class IB regions are found on separate
chromosomes with a sequence identity of 85% (rainbow
trout) and 82,5% (Atlantic salmon), suggestive of the
duplication occurring approx. 60 Mya. Two other more
distant MHC class I-like genes defined as ZE [42] and L
[43] might be remnants from two of the earlier wholegenome duplication events.
The ancestral MHC must have contained both class I as
well as class II. Shark and frog both contain MHC regions
resembling the human MHC region containing both
MHC class I as well as MHC class II molecules [1]. The
MHC class II region is assumed to have been translocated
to another area early in the teleost branch as teleosts are
the only phylogenetic group with no linkage of class I and
class II. In contrast to teleosts, shark seems to have chosen
a different paralogue as its major MHC class II locus being
more similar to the tetrapod MHC class II molecules than
to the classical teleost class II. The salmonid DBA/DCA
and DDA sequences cluster closer to the tetrapod/shark
sequences and could also be a version of this paralogue.
Based on the phylogenetic clustering, the salmonid DBA
and DCA genes most likely originated from the wholegenome duplication event that occurred in salmonids 60
Mya, similar to the class I IA and IB region duplication.
DDA and DAA might be remnants of two older wholegenome duplication events potentially analogous to the
human Chromosome 1, 6, 9, 19 paralogues. The human
TIPRL homolog [Genbank: NM_152902] is located on
chromosome 1q23.2, a region that also encompasses
MHC paralogous genes such as CD1 and COL11A1 [44]
while the human homologs of NRGN, TECTA and TBCEL
all reside on chromosome 11. If the salmon TIPRL and
class II genes originate from the primordial human chromosome 1 remains to be established.
Other teleost genomes show some synteny to the molecules encoded on the Atlanitc salmon BAC clone. A
tblastn search against Ensembl genomic databases of
tetraodon, stickleback, medaka and zebrafish (Table 3)
showed a tight linkage between the TBCEL and TECTA
genes in all species except tetraodon. Stickleback and

medaka also harbour a TIPRL homolog on the same chromosome as TBCEL and TECTA, although at a distance of
approximately 12 Mb and 17 Mb away respectively. The
zebrafish NRGN homolog is located on the same chromosome as TBCEL and TECTA approximately 12 Mb in distance. Homologs to the Sasa-DBB and Sasa-DBA genes
were not found in any other available teleost genomes. In
summary, the Sasa-DBB and Sasa-DBA genes are most
likely a duplication of a primordial class II region that has
been translocated into the NRGN-TIPRL-TBCEL-TECTA
region. The duplication seems to be salmon specific
although more teleost genome sequences may prove us
wrong.

Conclusion
In this study we describe a novel MHC class II region in
Atlantic salmon consisting of two closely linked MHC
class II alpha and beta loci denoted Sasa-DBA and SasaDBB respectively. The genes are not linked to the classical
class II loci and have low sequence identity to classical
sequences. The region shows some conserved synteny
towards other described teleost genomic regions. Two
additional divergent class II alpha sequences were also
identified and represent two additional salmonid class II
alpha loci. Expression patterns and lack of polymorphism
make these genes non-classical class II analogues indicating that these molecules may have a unique and yet unidentified function in salmonids. In conclusion, we have
identified a more complex picture for MHC class II in teleost fishes, with most species containing multiple
expressed loci. These newly discovered genes may expand
our understanding of MHC class II function in vertebrates.

Methods
BAC library screening
An Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) CHORI-214 bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC) library was obtained from
BACPAC Resources, Children's Hospital Oakland
Research Institute [45]. The library consisted of approximately 299,000 recombinant clones, representing 18-fold
genome coverage and an average insert size of 188 kb
[27]. Probes specific for the S. salar MHC class II were PCR
amplified (primers listed in Table 4) from cDNA clones
(Grimholt pers com.) and purified from agarose gel slices
with the GenClean III Kit (Qbiogene). Probes were radioactive labelled with α32P-CTP (Amersham) using

Rediprime Random Labelling Kit (Amersham), including
spermine precipitation of labelled DNA (Feinberg and
Vogelstein, 1984). Filter hybridizations were conducted as
described by CHORI. Probed BAC library filters were
stored in Phospho-image cassettes for 2–24 hours and
hybridizations visualized by Typhoon Phospho Image
Scanner (Amersham).
Characterization of positive BAC clones
DNA from positive BAC clones was isolated from 3 ml LB
overnight cultures, supplemented with 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, as described by CHORI. Mapping of BAC clones
was performed by restriction fragment analysis with NotI
and NruI (NEB). Secondary screening of positive BACs
were done by Southern blot hybridization of digested
DNAs using DAA and DAB cDNA probes, in addition to
end-labelled Sp6 and T7 oligos. End-labelling was performed with γ32P-ATP (Amersham) using T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (NEB) and hybridized overnight at 42°C
with Church hybridization buffer. Filters were washed 3 ×
30 min with 3 × SSC/0.1%SDS at 42 °C and visualized by
Typhoon Phospho Image Scanner (Amersham).

BAC subclone library and sequencing
The 630N19 BAC clone positive for DAA was subjected to
nucleotide sequencing using a shotgun strategy. BAC DNA
was isolated and purified by an alkaline lysis procedure
using Nucleobond columns (BD Biosciences ClonTech).
15 microgram (or more) of isolated DNA was nebulized
(Invitrogen) (20PSI/15s), trimmed and end filled with
Mung Bean Nuclease (NEB), T4 DNA polymerase (NEB)
and Klenow Fragment (NEB). The blunt-ended DNA was
size fractioned by electrophoresis and the fragments corresponding to 1–4 kb were excised and gel purified using
GeneClean III (Qbiogene). Fragments were ligated into a
pUC19/SmaI vector (Fermentas) and transformed into
XL-Gold competent cells (Stratagen) using the manufacturer's protocol. DNA plasmid from BAC subclones were
isolated using standard alkaline lysis method [46]. More
than 3000 BAC subclones were sequenced both using universal forward and reverse M13 primers with Big Dye Terminator Kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and
analysed on ABI 3100 DNA automated sequencer.
Sequences were screened for E. coli content using Pregap4
[47,48]. The resulting ~5500 high quality sequence reads

were basecalled using PHRED [49,50], assembled using
PHRAP [51] and then viewed and edited using Consed
[52]. Remaining gaps or areas of uncertainty were analyzed by designing new internal sequencing primers via
Autofinish [53] within Consed, followed by direct
sequencing of shotgun clones containing segments of
interest. Restriction digest of the isolated BAC were compared to in silico digests for assembly conformation. BAC
630N19 was deposited in Genbank under the accession
number [Genbank: EU008541].
Gene predictions and phylogenetic analysis
DIGIT [54] and GENSCAN [55] were used to predict novel
genes and to identify open reading frames. Dotter [56]
was used to compare the BAC sequence to itself as well as
to other BACs and to identify duplicated regions. Blast
searches identified possible functions of predicted genes
[57,58]. EST cluster consensus files were obtained from
GRASP EST database [59,60] and other EST were identified with UniGene [61,62]. Full-length sequencing of the
EST cDNA clone DV106186 was performed by primer
walking. Sim4 [63] and Spidey [64] were used to adjust
exon and intron boundaries aligning EST/cDNA
sequences to the BAC sequence. Repeatmasker [29,65]
was used to identify repeats. Multiple sequence alignments of the assumed or verified expressed exons were
done using ClustalX [66] followed by manual inspection.

Phylogenetic trees were created using neighbour-joining
method in MEGA3 [67]. Consensus trees were based on
1000 bootstrap replications and reported with the bootstrap support values (in percent) indicated above the
respective nodes. Gaps were removed and phylogenetic
data reported using the Poisson correction model with
uniform rates across all sites.
Gene expression analysis
mRNA was extracted from Atlantic salmon tissues
(foregut, hindgut, head kidney, muscle, gills, spleen, heart
and liver) using QuickPrep micro mRNA Purification Kit
(GE Healthcare Life Science). 1 μl of mRNA sample was
used for quantification with Nanodrop spectrometer
(Nanodrop Technologies, DE). All samples were DNase
treated using Turbo DNA-free™ (Ambion, Austin, TX,
USA). Gene specific PCR primers (Table 4) were designed
manually for the amplification of approximately 100 bp
fragments and synthesized by ProOligo (Paris, France).
mRNA was treated with DNase and amplicons were, when
possible, placed over introns and product size and specificity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Gel
logic 200 Imaging system, Kodak) and sequencing. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted on a Chromo 4 Realtime Detection System (MJ Research, USA). Reactions
were performed in 25 μl including ~10 ng of mRNA with
a one-step real-time RT-PCR kit according to the manufac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/193

turer's instructions (RealQ RT-PCR Master Mix One Step,
Ampliqon). PCR parameters were 55°C for 30 min, 95°C
for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for
15s, 60°C at 30s and 72°C at 30s. A melting-curve analysis was performed for each sample to check for unspecific
amplification. Baseline level and cycle threshold (CT)
were set manually and CT values > 37 were rejected. Relative expression of mRNA in relation to the housekeeping
gene elongation factor 1α (EF1A) was calculated using the
ΔΔCT method [68]. Data from real-time RT-PCR are presented as the mean ± SEM of at least three independent
samples and the tissue with the lowest expression was
used as calibrator.
Tissue-specific expression of selected genes Sasa-DBA and
Sasa-DBB were determined by gene-specific amplification
including MHC class II beta (Sasa-DAB) as a positive reference gene and EF1A as internal housekeeping control.
The primer sequences are presented in Table 4. The PCR
reactions (25 μl total volume) included 20 ng cDNA, 0,4
μM of each primer, 200 μM dNTPs, 1 × buffer (Herculase
10 × PCR buffer), and 0.5 units of Herculase polymerase
(Stratagene). Amplifications were conducted as follows:
initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 30 cycles consisting of 95°C for 20 s, 54°C for 30 s, 72°C extension for 90
s; followed by a final extension of 72°C for 10 min. PCR
products were separated on 2% agarose gel stained with
EtBr for visualization with Gel logic 200 Imaging system
(Kodak).
