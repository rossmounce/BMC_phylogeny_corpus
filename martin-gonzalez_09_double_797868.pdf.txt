Abstract
Background: Microfossils are not only useful for elucidating biological macro- and microevolution
but also the biogeochemical history of our planet. Pyritization is the most important and extensive
mode of preservation of animals and especially of plants. Entrapping in amber, a fossilized resin, is
considered an alternative mode of biological preservation. For the first time, the internal
organization of 114-million-year-old microfossils entrapped in Lower Cretaceous amber is
described and analyzed, using adapted scanning electron microscopy in backscattered electron
mode in association with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy microanalysis. Double fossilization
of several protists included in diverse taxonomical groups and some vegetal debris is described and
analyzed.
Results: In protists without an exoskeleton or shell (ciliates, naked amoebae, flagellates),
determinate structures, including the nuclei, surface envelopes (cortex or cytoplasmic membrane)
and hyaloplasm are the main sites of pyritization. In protists with a biomineralized skeleton
(diatoms), silicon was replaced by pyrite. Permineralization was the main mode of pyritization.
Framboidal, subhedral and microcrystalline are the predominant pyrite textures detected in the
cells. Abundant pyritized vegetal debris have also been found inside the amber nuggets and the
surrounding sediments. This vegetal debris usually contained numerous pyrite framboids and very
densely packed polycrystalline pyrite formations infilled with different elements of the secondary
xylem.
Conclusion: Embedding in amber and pyritization are not always alternative modes of biological
preservation during geological times, but double fossilization is possible under certain
environmental conditions. Pyritization in protists shows a quite different pattern with regard to
plants, due to the different composition and cellular architecture in these microorganisms and
organisms. Anaerobic sulphate-reducing bacteria could play a crucial role in this microbial
fossilization.

Background
A major problem for understanding the origin of life,
microbial evolution and phylogeny is the lack of microbial fossils. It is especially evident when we consider the
available well-preserved record of pluricellular organisms,
animals and plants [1]. Microfossils are not only useful for
elucidating biological macro- and microevolution but
also the biogeochemical history of our planet. Amber is a
fossilized resin originating from the trunk and roots of
certain trees, particularly of the genera Agathis and Hymenaea. It acts as a natural embedding agent and it has properties similar to amorphous polymeric glass [2]. Amber
consists of a complex mixture of terpenoid and/or phenolic compounds. The organisms that are embedded in it
are maintained in their three-dimensional form and their
morphological features are preserved, making it possible
to compare them with their present-day descendants [3].
Trapping in amber is not the most frequent mechanism of
preservation of biological systems, especially of the socalled soft-bodied fossils (for example, nematodes and
insects); mineralization as a result of both microbial and
abiotic processes is the most common mechanism. Two
main mechanisms of fossilization by mineralization are
recognized: permineralization, which is the result of early
infiltration and permeation of cells and/or tissues by mineral-charged water; and replication of morphology in
authigenic minerals which are mainly a product of bacterial activity [4]. Mineralization in pyrite is called pyritization. Pyrite is the most common sulphide mineral found
in marine argillaceous sedimentary rocks, where it can
occur in a variety of crystallographic and textural forms
[5]. Pyritization is considered an important mode of preservation and/or fossilization in animals and plants, with
or without a skeleton or cuticle [6-8]. Although little
detailed work has been published on pyrite in fossils,
three grades of biological preservation by pyritization
have been recognized [5,9]: 1) permineralization, involving pyrite precipitation in cellular cavities or cell walls
made of poorly biodegradable components such as cellulose and chitin; 2) formation of mineral coats, which is
usually involved in the preservation of very degradable
biological components. These pyrite coats have a limited
and clearly defined thickness; and 3) formation of mineral casts or moulds. This style of preservation causes the
greatest degree of biological information loss, since only
the fossil outline is preserved. The main difference
between these three modes of preservation by pyritization
is the extent of mineral precipitation.
One important feature in the pyritization process is pyrite
texture. The term texture is used to define the characteristics (size, shape, crystallinity) and contact relationships
among pyrite crystals. The external form and shape of any
aggregate of pyrite crystals is referred to as morphology
[5]. Pyrite textures have been used to determine the mech-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/9

anism of pyritization [7] and even (considering pyrite
morphologies, also) the paleoenvironmental and paleoredox status [10]. However, the process of pyritization is
still poorly understood and many questions remain unanswered; for instance, if it is a selective process, how do the
internal tissues or cell interior become pyritized? [7].
Thus, in general, pyritization and trapping in amber are
two different taphonomic modes of biological fossilization. Only a few specimens of completely pyritized insects
in amber or with a coat of pyrite between the insect carcass
and the surrounding amber have been reported, as mentioned in the excellent review on insect taphonomy by
Martínez-Delclòs et al [11]. Pyrite has also been found in
the spores of a lichen-like inclusion in Eocene amber [12].
In these cases, the mode of formation is unknown, but
according to some authors, pyrite may penetrate by
microfractures in the amber and connect with the organisms, precipitating [13,14]. Moreover, some microcrystals
of marcasite (a mineral with the same chemical composition as pyrite that crystallizes in a different crystal system)
were detected in the interior of some insects from French
Cenomanian amber [15].
Paleomicrobiological studies on amber are very scarce.
The most ancient eukaryotic microorganisms found in
amber date back to the Triassic (220 My ago) [16]. In
addition, there are some observations, most of them by
optical microscopy, on the microbiocoenosis in German
[17-20], French [21] and American [22-24] ambers from
the Middle and Upper Cretaceous. However, there is no
data on the potential mechanism (or mechanisms)
involved in microbial fossilization. To date, we have not
found any information about the cytoplasmic organization of these microfossils or any other relevant ultrastructural data. For some years, we have been analyzing and
identifying eukaryotic microoganisms trapped in the
Lower Cretaceous amber from Peñacerrada (Álava,
Spain), considered exceptional from both a geological
and paleontological point of view. It is one of the highly
fossiliferous amber deposits from the Lower Cretaceous,
relatively rare in relation with Upper Cretaceous resins
[11,25]. Preliminary studies [26,27] indicate that amber
deposits from Peñacerrada contain diverse and abundant
communities of prokaryotic and especially eukaryotic
microorganisms. Our previous observations by optical
microscopy of diverse fossilized protists suggested the
existence of a remarkable morphological stasis [28]. In the
present paper, we have studied in detail, by SEM-BSE
(scanning electron microscopy in backscattered electron
mode) associated to EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry) microanalysis, the degree of biological conservation and the mechanism/s involved in the preservation
of the eukaryotic microorganisms embedded in this
ancient amber. The results obtained provide relevant evidence which contradicts some previous paleobiological

theories about biomineralization, in particular pyritization. The importance of this information in paleo- and
geomicrobiology is discussed.

Results
In the amber site at Peñacerrada (Peñacerrada II in previous references, [25]) the most productive source of amber
nuggets was associated with centimetre-sized nodules of
pyrite with 2 mm octagonal crystals. Microcrystalline
pyrite also was detected as irregular crusts over amber
lumps and in the core of lignite fragments [25]. Amber
deposits were always associated with the coal layers that
are more abundant in the middle part of the formation
[29,30].
The pattern of pyrite deposition and crystallization presented differences according to each protist morphotype,
that is, the cellular organization and composition. However, the general pattern of pyrite crystal distribution was
similar in all protists. The size of the cells may have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/9

an important factor in the pyrite texture. Figure 1 illustrates the general appearance of different pyritized microorganisms in amber, including different protists and
fragments of fungal hyphae. Small naked amoebae are
quite frequent in the Cretaceous amber studied.
Figure 2A shows the SEM-BSE image of a small pyritized
monopodial naked amoeba, very similar to the extant
genus Hartmannella. The sulphur and iron contents,
detected by microanalysis, are illustrated respectively in
Figure 2B and 2C; the quantity of sulphur seems to be
almost double the iron content, which corresponds to
their proportion in pyrite (FeS2). As may be observed, the
cytoplasm contained numerous vacuoles or vesicles and
the pyrite deposition is more intense in the hyaloplasm, a
jellified hyaline cap located at the front of the leading
pseudopodium [31]. However, the texture of pyrite is
always microcrystalline in all cellular locations.
Both heterotrophic and photosynthetic flagellates of different taxa have been identified in amber. In all of them
the pyrite microcrystalline deposits are more intense
inside the plasma membrane and cell wall. The cytoplasm
of these pyritized cells presents a trabecular appearance
with many vesicles and vacuoles of different sizes delimited by a microcrystalline network (Figures 3 and 4). In
some cases, the cytoplasm is partially infilled with massive polycrystalline pyrite (Figure 5).
When the cellular section prepared for SEM-BSE includes
the nucleus, it is possible to observe that the pyritization
pattern of this structure is very different. Figure 6 shows
the cross section of a pyritized small cell, which probably
corresponds to the photosynthetic extant genus
Chlamydomonas. In this case, the nuclear envelope has
been replaced by a layer of discrete spheroidal or cubooctahedral microcrystals or grains (<0.1 μm), densely
packaged. Equimorphic organization of pyrite microcrystals was similar to that from pyrite framboids. However,
framboids usually occur in clusters of finite size. The
organic core of the nucleus (nucleoplasm) has been
degraded and is partially infilled by densely packed
groups of subhedral crystals that are bigger (<1 μm, >0.1
μm) than those from the biomineralized nuclear envelope (Figure 6).

The pyritization pattern in ciliated protozoa is similar to
that in flagellates. In these protists, there are two morphological and functional types of nuclei; the vegetative
macronucleus and the germinative micronucleus. Subhedral or cubo-octahedral crystals of pyrite preferentially
infilled the nuclei. Disorganized aggregates of regular
microcrystals with a framboid-like appearance infilled the
space corresponding to the double nuclear membrane.
The size of framboids depended on the size of the nuclei

present a complex structure around the cytoplasm, called
a cortex, that includes cilia, kinetosomes and fibrillarassociated structures and two or three membranes. In all
micrographs, the cortex is infilled by pyrite microcrystals
forming a layer without uniform width (Figures 7 and 8).

Pyritization also affected those protists with a mineralized
external skeleton. Figure 9 shows the longitudinal section
of a diatom similar to the extant genus Cymbella. The species of this genus have a frustule made of very pure silica,
coated with a layer of organic material. It is usually easy to
identify them, because the valves are asymmetrical around

cates that replacement of Si by pyrite took place in these
microfossils. The cytoplasm appears very vacuolated with
a complex network of microcrystals. A framboid-like
pyrite can be observed in the location of the nucleus.
In the same amber nuggets, we also found abundant pyritized vegetal microdebris, usually containing numerous
pyrite framboids with variable sizes (<10 to 50 μm) (Figure 10). In Figure 11, we can observe very densely packed
polycrystalline pyrite formations that infill different elements of the secondary xylem. It may be observed that tracheids are not infilled by pyrite. We also processed some
samples of the sediments next to the amber deposits.
Numerous crusts of pyrite with different textures, mainly
octahedral and subhedral cubo-octahedral, were detected
in the sediments (Figure 12). These large crusts of pyrite
crystals also occurred embedded in the amber, but located
outside the cells (Figure 13). Pyritized vegetal debris can
be observed more clearly when not entrapped in amber,
making it possible to analyze the different textures of
pyrite. The lumina of xylem vessels appeared infilled by
densely packed subhedral or cubo-octahedral pyrite (Figure 14). The texture associated with the inner surface of
cell walls is microcrystalline (Figure 15). We did not
detect framboids associated with the xylem vessels, only
with parenchyma. However, parenchymal cells more frequently appear completely infilled with microcrystalline
pyrite (Figure 16).

Discussion
All previous studies of the pyritization of soft parts have
analyzed vegetal and animal fossils. Our paleomicrobiological analysis provides new information, and a substantial part of these data do not support some postulates and
general affirmations about pyritization. In all observed
and analyzed microbial fossils, permineralization of cells
seemed to be the main mode of pyritization. It is stated
that in a permineralized tissue, pyrite occurs inside the
boundary between the organism and the surrounding sediment [5]. In (macro)fossils, preservation by this mechanism usually involves the replacement by pyrite of more
degradable components, such as the cell walls of plants.
The poorly biodegradable tissues, such as cellulose or chitin, may be preserved by the precipitation of pyrite in their
pore spaces or infilling of cellular cavities [32]. However,
the pyritization of labile tissues (for example, skin and
muscle fibres) has not been documented [4,33]. Experimental induction of pyritization in microalgae resulted in
the infilling of Chlorella with iron sulphides and a limited
disruption of cells [34]. This is the first time that it has
been possible to analyze the pyritization pattern of a unicellular organism, including the internal architecture. The
protist cortical structures, irrespective of their organization (cortex, plasmatic membrane, cell wall) and compo-

sition, are important centres of pyritization and they
appear infilled by microcrystals of pyrite. This does not
correspond to a mineral coat, since the pyrite does not
occur in a thin and well-defined zone, immediately outside the organism/cellular boundary. Another cellular
structure that is preferentially replaced by pyrite is the
nucleus or nuclei, despite being composed of easily biodegradable macromolecules (DNA and proteins). It is
remarkable that the pyrite texture of the nuclear envelope
was different to that of the nucleoplasm. This pyritization
pattern is different from those reported in plants, where
the pyrite is precipitated in fluid-filled spaces in the plant,
from cell-sized voids to spaces between fibrils in the cell
wall [7,34,35]. Furthermore, there is no evidence for iron
sulphides penetrating the cells during experimental pyritization [34].

Different cell wall composition in these two types of biological systems, as well as the absence of this structure in
some protists (for example, ciliates), might explain the
different patterns observed in protists and plants. When
the protist has a skeleton, such as Cymbella, the siliceous
frustule is replaced by a pyritized skeleton made of microcrystals. Dispersive X-ray analysis has shown the complete
replacement of silica by pyrite. However, we cannot
observe the degree of ornamentation preservation because
we have only obtained longitudinal sections. Numerous
assemblages of marine pyritized diatoms from the Tertiary
(Palaeocene-Eocene) have been described [36-38]. Two
different modes of pyritization have been reported; a
change of the siliceous frustule by a well-preserved pyritized skeleton and the crystallization of pyrite in internal
cavities of the diatoms, preserving only the external morphology.
The most frequent pyrite textures found in our fossilized
protists were microcrystalline and framboidal. However,
outside cells but inside the amber and also in the sediments surrounding the amber deposits, we found mainly
octahedral or subhedral pyrite in clusters of different sizes.
In studies of fossil plants from the Eocene London Clay,
Grimes et al reported different textures in adjacent cells of
the same vegetal tissue. They stated that there is no exclusive relationship between cell type and a particular texture
or combination of textures [7]. This fact has been interpreted as evidence of the development of isolated chemical micro-environments and the progressive changes in
pore water chemistry as a result of microbial activity and
reactant availability during burial [7]. Our observations of
pyritized plant debris from inside Cretaceous amber nuggets and the adjacent sediments showed some differences.
We found no framboidal pyrite within the lumen of xylem
vessels, a common occurrence in plant fossils from London Clay. On the contrary, the texture found in the

Page 8 of 11

BMC Biology 2009, 7:9

lumina of xylem vessels is subhedral. In secondary xylem,
microcrystalline pyrite infilled the lignified cell walls.
These results do not agree with the four-stage model proposed to explain the pyritization of fossils from London
Clay [7], which assumed two affirmations which are very
difficult to support from a microbiological point of view.
First, it was proposed that pyrite nucleation may have
been facilitated by the availability of oxidizing agents or
bacterial biofilms. Sulphate-reducing bacteria, the microorganisms involved in biological formation of pyrite, are
obligate anaerobes. Microbial biofilms favour the existence of anaerobic environmental conditions that are
incompatible with the presence of oxidizing agents. Second, the existence of distinct pyrite textures in two adjacent cells is explained as a consequence of microhabitats
[7]. The existence of microhabitats in biofilms and microbial mats, in which very different physiological groups of
bacteria are distributed according to their physiological
requirements, is well known. However, it is difficult to
assume that there are diverse chemical micro-environments in the same eukaryotic microbial cell. The pyritized
cell in Figure 6 is only around 12 μm in diameter and it
showed at least two different pyrite textures.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/9

the resin. However, the pyritization may have continued
for some time after the cells were embedded in the resin.
Two reasons support this hypothesis. Organic matter degradation (decay) and mineralization (pyritization) represent two competing forces during early fossilization, and
the amount of detail preserved in a biological fossil is usually a reflection of the end result of the relative timing of
these two polar forces [1,6]. Trapping in amber preserves
tissues and cells because it arrests organic degradation;
however, mineralization is also occurring. It is therefore
possible to observe some details of cellular morphology
of the protists in amber. Secondly, chemical analysis from
Peñacerrada amber demonstrated anoxic conditions
inside fossilized resin [40].

The amber nuggets from Peñacerrada had frequent inclusions of vegetal debris, including root fragments, suggesting the microbial and vegetal materials were included in
the resin in the soil, before their transport. The sedimentology of the amber deposits, including the type of mineralization found in the layer which was the most
productive source of amber lumps, is representative of the
early diagenesis caused by diverse populations of anaerobic bacteria that result from the deposition of organic
matter, which impedes oxygen diffusion across the sediment [39]. The formation and accumulation of pyrite during the early diagenesis is controlled by a number of
environmental factors, including availability of iron, sulphate and organic carbon, anoxic conditions, pyrite oxidation and hydrodynamics [10]. These factors are crucial
for the optimal growth and metabolism of sulphatereducing bacteria, the main microbial group involved in
biological pyritization. With regard to the taxonomic
aspects of the amber deposit, according to Alonso et al
[25], amber lumps from nearby forests were transported
in suspension by rivers and deposited in low-energy areas
as floodplains and swamps. In this concentration process,
well-preserved lumps and altered ones come together.

At present, microbial involvement in both pyrite precipitation to form sediments and pyritization (mineralization) of organisms, tissues and cells, is the subject of
intense controversy. Authors favouring a chemical origin
support their hypothesis with two main facts; pyrite framboids have been synthesized in some laboratories (see
[41]), and microfossils of bacteria (in sediments, amber
and so on) are relatively rare, exhibiting very low cellular
concentrations although bacterial concentrations are, at
present, usually high in many environments [42,43].
However, more evidence supports early diagenetic pyrite
forms, natural pyrite framboids and biological pyritization being a result of microbial processes, although some
abiotic chemical reactions might also be involved. First,
successful experimental synthesis of framboids has been
achieved in only a few instances in which high temperature (150 to 300°C) and the addition of SO2 were
employed, or by increasing the redox potential of the systems [41]. Second, fossilized bacteria with distinct morphologies have been observed in pyrite-containing
sediments and oncoids by SEM and transmission electron
microscopy [42-45]. Third, the results from very diverse
experimental pyritization assays with plants show that
anoxic sediments or cultures of sulphate-reducing bacteria
are needed, that oxidizing conditions inhibits pyritization
and that biomineralization of plants cells is rapid (24 to
80 days), which contributes to cell preservation [8,34,46].
Finally, it must be added that the chief physiological
group of bacteria that lead pyritization, the sulphate
reducers, appears to be a very ancient and diverse group of
microorganisms [47]. Moreover, there is isotopic evidence
of microbial sulphate reduction more than 2.7 Gy ago, in
the early Archaean era [48].

It is important to assign a temporal sequence to both pyritization and trapping in amber fossilization processes that
protists underwent more than 114 My ago. Microanalysis
of sediments adjacent to the amber deposits indicated that
plant debris were pyritized, so the pyritization seems to be
a prior and independent process to cellular inclusion into

Additional valuable information is provided by the characteristics of sediments located around the amber deposits
where pyritized (micro/macro) fossils appeared. In the
detailed description of fossiliferous amber deposits in
New Jersey (Upper Cretaceous) by Grimaldi et al [49],
where two pyritized insects were reported, the amber was

buried in sediments that were highly reducing, as revealed
by strong sulphurous gases during excavations, and by the
abundance of pyrite and marcasite. A similar reducing
environment, with H2S emission, fragments of carbonized microcrystalline wood (lignite) and octagonal crystals of pyrite crusts has been described in Peñacerrada
sediments [25]. This type of mineralization is representative of deposition and degradation of organic matter by
anaerobic bacteria [39]. For all of the above reasons, we
think that the anaerobic sulphate-respiring bacteria play a
key role in the biomineralization (pyritization) of Cretaceous protists and other microorganisms found in amber
from Peñacerrada.

Conclusion
Ultrastructural examination and microanalysis of fossilized protists in Peñacerrada's Lower Cretaceous amber
deposits support the view that, under certain environmental conditions, it is possible to find biological records
which underwent two different mechanisms of fossilization – pyritization and entrapping in amber. Therefore,
pyritization and embedding in resin are not always alternative modes of biological preservation. These uncommon double fossilizations indicate that anaerobic
conditions and abundant organic matter as well as available and permanent/semi-permanent freshwater were
present in the ecosystem of Peñacerrada during Lower
Cretaceous, previous to the biological inclusions in the
resins. The comparative study of fossilized plant debris
inside amber nuggets and those in sediments surrounding
these nuggets showed that, at least in this case, inclusion
in resin was a process prior to permineralization. In protists, the pattern of pyritization showed some differences
from those observed in vegetal debris, probably due to the
drastic differences of composition and cellular organization in these two biological kingdoms.

Collection and processing of amber and sediments
Several tons of deep amber-containing sediments were
extracted. Amber deposits were then separated from the
rocks, pyrite nodules, lignite fragments and sandstones
using a standard concrete mixer. Amber has a low specific
gravity and generally floats or is buoyant in water. The
concrete mixer was fed with a continuous flow of water,
and the slurry resulting from mixing with rocks was
poured through a 5 mm mesh. Solids of the lowest density
(that is, amber and lignite) were collected from the surface, while dense sediments settled to the bottom of the
concrete mixer. Each extraction process lasted 10 or 15
minutes. Regardless of size, amber lumps were the first to
come out onto the sieve, followed by denser lignite fragments. Material deposited at the bottom of the concrete
mixer consisted mainly of sand, fragments of rock, and
pyrite nodules, which was free of amber, revealing the effi-

ciency of this method in processing large quantities of
amberiferous rocks.
Each piece of amber was carefully examined under a stereoscopic microscope to detect biological inclusions, such
as small arthropods and plant debris. All amber pieces
containing biological inclusions were embedded in the
epoxy resin Epotek 301 to eliminate the mirror effect of
internal cracks and to avoid natural oxidation and darkening. Internal zones of deeper sediments surrounding
amber pieces were collected manually and stored aseptically after processing for electron microscopy.
SEM-BSE with EDS microanalysis examination
Small pieces of amber were embedded in epoxy resin and
after polymerization each block was cut and finely polished [26]. The polished surfaces were carbon coated and
observed using DSM 940 A Zeiss and DSM 960 A Zeiss
microscopes, equipped with a four-diode semiconductor
BSE detector and a Link ISIS microanalytical EDS system.
SEM-BSE and EDS examinations of the samples were performed simultaneously. Operating conditions are specified elsewhere [50]. The use of BSE in SEM yields highmagnification images with contrast attributable to differences in average atomic number of the target [51]. It has
been applied successfully in the examination of pyritized
plant material [35].
