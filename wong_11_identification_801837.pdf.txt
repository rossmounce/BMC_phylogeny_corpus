Identification of lignin genes and regulatory
sequences involved in secondary cell wall
formation in Acacia auriculiformis and Acacia
mangium via de novo transcriptome sequencing

Abstract
Background: Acacia auriculiformis × Acacia mangium hybrids are commercially important trees for the timber and
pulp industry in Southeast Asia. Increasing pulp yield while reducing pulping costs are major objectives of tree
breeding programs. The general monolignol biosynthesis and secondary cell wall formation pathways are wellcharacterized but genes in these pathways are poorly characterized in Acacia hybrids. RNA-seq on short-read
platforms is a rapid approach for obtaining comprehensive transcriptomic data and to discover informative
sequence variants.
Results: We sequenced transcriptomes of A. auriculiformis and A. mangium from non-normalized cDNA libraries
synthesized from pooled young stem and inner bark tissues using paired-end libraries and a single lane of an
Illumina GAII machine. De novo assembly produced a total of 42,217 and 35,759 contigs with an average length of
496 bp and 498 bp for A. auriculiformis and A. mangium respectively. The assemblies of A. auriculiformis and A.
mangium had a total length of 21,022,649 bp and 17,838,260 bp, respectively, with the largest contig 15,262 bp
long. We detected all ten monolignol biosynthetic genes using Blastx and further analysis revealed 18 lignin
isoforms for each species. We also identified five contigs homologous to R2R3-MYB proteins in other plant species
that are involved in transcriptional regulation of secondary cell wall formation and lignin deposition. We searched
the contigs against public microRNA database and predicted the stem-loop structures of six highly conserved
microRNA families (miR319, miR396, miR160, miR172, miR162 and miR168) and one legume-specific family
(miR2086). Three microRNA target genes were predicted to be involved in wood formation and flavonoid
biosynthesis. By using the assemblies as a reference, we discovered 16,648 and 9,335 high quality putative Single
Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transcriptomes of A. auriculiformis and A. mangium, respectively, thus
yielding useful markers for population genetics studies and marker-assisted selection.
Conclusion: We have produced the first comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis in A. auriculiformis and A.
mangium using de novo assembly techniques. Our high quality and comprehensive assemblies allowed the
identification of many genes in the lignin biosynthesis and secondary cell wall formation in Acacia hybrids. Our
results demonstrated that Next Generation Sequencing is a cost-effective method for gene discovery, identification
of regulatory sequences, and informative markers in a non-model plant.

Background
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is quickly becoming
the standard for the generation of cheap, accurate and
high throughput DNA sequence data [1]. The major
NGS platforms are Roche 454 GS-FLX Titanium (330
bp), Illumina GAIIx (75-100 bp) and SOLiD3 (50 bp),
which differ in read length, error rate and cost [2].
Transcriptome sequencing using NGS, commonly
known as RNA-Seq, enables rapid and cost-effective
gene and marker discovery, gene expression analysis,
detection of rare variants and splice isoforms. Most previous studies have involved sequencing plant transcriptomes with completed reference genomes available, such
as Arabidopsis thalina [3,4], Medicago truncatula [5]
and Zea mays [6,7]. Direct sequencing of the transcriptome of non-model organisms has the potential to
rapidly generate valuable genomic resources in poorly
known species. However, de novo transcriptome assembly is challenging due to short reads, lack of reference
sequences and the need for development of improved
bioinformatic tools to facilitate data analysis [8].
Most de novo transcriptome studies have used the
Roche 454 platforms [9-13] as the longer reads allow
more reliable de novo assembly, however, the reactions
are relatively expensive, reducing the potential sequencing coverage which plays a major role in the accuracy
of de novo assembly. Hybrid sequencing approaches
using 454/Illumina technologies can successfully reduce
cost and compensate for different sequencing technology biases [14,15]. While sequencing exclusively using
Illumina technology, the most widely published NGS
platform is an attractive and cheap alternative as the
high coverage obtained can overcome sequencing error
rates and short read length, relatively few de novo transcriptome studies have exploited these advantages in
plants [16]https://atgc-illumina.googlecode.com/files/
PAG_2010_AKozik_V09.pdf. As read lengths increase,
paired-end library construction techniques improve and
costs continue to go down, Illumina RNA-seq will
become a powerful tool for transcriptome characterization of non-model plants.
Acacia mangium and Acacia auriculiformis are important forest tree species, belonging to the Fabaceae or
Legume family, and are native to Australia, Papua New
Guinea and Indonesia. A. mangium is widely planted in
Southeast Asia because of its superior growth, wide site
suitability and multiple uses [17,18] while A. auriculiformis has higher adaptability, greater durability and is less
susceptible to diseases than A. mangium. A. auriculiformis and A. mangium are predominantly out-crossing
[19,20]. Naturally-crossed Acacia hybrids were first
noted in Sabah in the late 1970s [21]. These hybrids
possessed many attractive traits highly sought in tree

Page 2 of 13

improvement, such as enhanced growth, form, disease
resistance and adaptability. For the wood and pulp
industry, the Acacia hybrids have great potential as raw
material due to superior growth, longer wood fibers and
better pulp quality over their parents [22]. Low lignin
and high cellulose content are desirable in the pulping
process and studies have shown increased accumulation
of cellulose occurs when lignin is reduced in plants [23].
The monolignol biosynthesis pathway is well-characterized but the coordination and regulation of genes in the
pathway is not well-understood. Recent studies revealed
that known regulatory sequences, including several
classes of transcription factors and microRNAs play
important roles in regulation of lignin and wood formation [24,25]. These regulatory sequences may be good
candidates in selective breeding and genetic engineering
programs to increase pulp yield and reduce pulping
costs.
The C-value for A. auriculiformis and A. mangium
(both 2n = 26) are estimated to be 0.83 pg and 0.65 pg
respectively [26] while A. auriculiformis × A. mangium
hybrid genome size is estimated to be 750 Mb [27],
making the hybrid genome 1.4 times larger than the
Populus trichocarpa genome. Currently, no genome
sequences for any Acacia species are available although
the genomes of several model legume species like M.
truncatula and Glycine max have been sequenced.
Unfortunately, all of these model legumes are in a separate subfamily, the Faboideae, while Acacia species
are in the Mimosoideae subfamily. In terms of EST
resources for A. mangium, a total of 147 from floral tissues [28], 8,963 from secondary xylem and shoot tissue
[29] and 2,459 from inner bark of the A. auriculiformis
× A. mangium hybrid [30] have been deposited in the
NCBI dbEST. However, no genomic resources is available for A. auriculiformis. Several important genes
involved in monolignol biosynthesis and wood-related
pathways including cinammate 4-hydroxylase (C4H),
caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase
(COMT) and cellulose synthase (CesA) have been successfully isolated and characterized from the Acacia
hybrid [30,31].
Conventional breeding programs for the improvement
of forest trees are slow, laborious and land intensive due
to the long life cycle and large size of trees. The application of genomic approaches facilitated by emerging
DNA sequencing technologies may significantly accelerate the breeding program. Due to the lack of genomic
resources for tree crops particularly tropical species, the
simple discovery of genes controlling wood-related
traits will be a major step forward. Ultimately, the

Wong et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:342
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/342

development of large-scale genomic resources will facilitate the application of linkage and association mapping
within tree improvement programs.
Here we applied paired-end Illumina GAII sequencing
to non-normalized cDNAs of A. auriculiformis and A.
mangium to discover important genes involved in lignin
and secondary cell wall formation in these non-model
tree species. Using standard de novo assembly algorithms, we examined the quality of the contigs generated
and attempted to identify wood-related genes particularly genes and their isoforms in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. We also sought to identify potential
transcription factors involved in secondary wood formation and lignin deposition, and highly conserved microRNAs and their wood-related gene targets. A major
objective in our analysis was to detect a large number of
informative SNPs to be used for linkage mapping of
hybrid progenies and population genetic studies of the
two parental species. Our results could provide powerful
tools for the efficient selection of hybrid offsprings
with favorable traits, allowing rapid and continued
improvement.

Results and Discussion
De novo transcriptome assembly

In this study, we constructed non-normalized cDNA
libraries for each parental species as this will produce
more full length transcripts for significant gene discovery. Each library was sequenced using one lane of a flow
cell on the Illumina GAII platform using paired end
protocols. We obtained 19,899,637 and 17,859,793 51
bp paired-end raw reads for A. auriculiformis and A.
mangium, respectively. Filtering and conversion to
FASTQ format resulted in 13,648,154 and 12,621,865
paired-end reads for A. auriculiformis and A. mangium
respectively. After filtering of ribosomal RNA sequences,
51-57% of the reads remained with an average Phred
score of 34 - 35.
The filtered reads were used to perform de novo
assembly using a number of software such as Velvet
[32], SOAPdenovo [33] and Oases [34], however, we
found SOAPdenovo produced the longest assemblies
despite using longer k-mers. We assessed different kmer sizes and chose 29-mer to obtain a good tradeoff
between assembly size and accuracy. De novo transcriptome assembly for A. auriculiformis (subsequently
referred to as ‘Aa’) and A. mangium (subsequently
referred to as ‘Am’) produced 42,217 and 35,759 contigs
with an N50 contig size of 948 bp and 938 bp, a longest
contig of 15,262 bp and 15,220 bp, and an average
length of 496 bp and 498 bp respectively (Table 1). The
sequencing depth was estimated to be 18.7 × and 18.3 ×
respectively. Blastx indicated that the longest contig of
Aa and Am were homologs of the A. thaliana BIG;

binding/ubiquitin-protein ligase/zinc ion binding gene
(Figure 1A). This gene which is one of the longest genes
in plants, was also reported in de novo transcriptome
assembly of lettuce https://atgc-illumina.googlecode.
com/files/PAG_2010_AKozik_V09.pdf.
To determine the similarity at the nucleotide level
between the transcriptomes, we first mapped filtered
reads to their corresponding de novo contigs before
mapping each set of reads against the contigs obtained
from the other species. To substantially increase the
number of mappable reads, we mapped single-end reads
using Bowtie -v setting allowing three mismatches. A
total of 5,766,757 Aa single-end reads (37.24%) and
4,647,280 Am single-end reads (36.35%) mapped to their
corresponding contigs. We observed only a small drop
(roughly 15%) in the proportion of mappable reads from
one Acacia species to the contigs of the other Acacia
species indicating that the two transcriptomes shared a
great deal of identity at the nucleotide level and are closely related.
The observation that a large proportion of filtered
reads failed to map to the Acacia transcriptomes (>
60%) led us to investigate their origins by mapping to
various genomes (Figure 1B). A further 5-6% of the
reads mapped to the transcriptome of the other Acacia
species probably due to differentially expressed transcripts. We discovered that approximately 14% of the
reads mapped to mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of A. thaliana, suggesting a significant amount of
mitochondrial and chloroplast transcripts were
sequenced. We suspect that mitochondrion sequences
may not be assembled due to the highly heterozygous
nature of genomes that were present in high copy number. We tried to map the remaining reads to several
model plant genomes but found less than 10% mappable
reads and no huge differences between these plant genomes. The number of reads mappable to the model
legume, M. truncatula masked genome version Mt3.0
was 6.6-7.6%. The remaining ~36% of filtered reads
were unmappable possibly due to several reasons. Some
of these reads may be unique Acacia sequences from

intergenic and intronic regions based on observation
from Wang et al. [35] study that reported 40.75% of
RNA-Seq reads from Aspergillus oryzae were located at
these regions. Other reasons such as lack of Acacia genome information, poor quality reads and microbial contamination may have contributed to the large number of
unmappable reads.
Discovery of monolignol biosynthetic genes and isoforms

The monolignol biosynthesis pathway consists of several
large protein families with members commonly known
as isoforms. Isoform identification is challenging due to
presence of many closely related superfamily members
("like”) in the transcriptome, i.e. 27 “like” proteins of
COMT, CCR and 4CL were observed in A. thaliana
[36]. In this study, we found a total of 52 contigs in Aa
and Am transcriptomes with E-value ≤ 1E-10 corresponding to all ten monolignol genes in A. thaliana.
Gene identification using Blast alone often resulted in
an overestimation of the total number of genes and

isoforms. Shi et al. [37] reported 95 members of phenylpropanoid genes found in P. trichocarpa genome using
Blastp (E-value ≤ 1E-3), however, many are proposed to
be unrelated to monolignol biosynthesis pathway based
on phylogenetic and expression analysis. Therefore, we
tried to remove unrelated proteins by checking the conserved motifs which provide important clues in protein
function and identity. We excluded contigs with low
homology to A. thaliana monolignol genes (less than
55% identity) and we checked the remaining contigs for
conserved amino acid motifs identified in previous studies [38-46] from the protein alignments (Additional
File 1).
We were able to detect all ten genes involved in
monolignol biosynthesis pathway, namely phenylalanine
ammonia lyase (PAL), cinammate 4-hydroxylase (C4H),
4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT), ferulate 5-hydroxylase (F5H), 4coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinatehydroxy-cinnamoyltransferase (HCT),

caffeoyl CoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), cinnamoyl Co-A
reductase (CCR) compared to traditional EST sequencing in A. mangium [29] and A. auriculiformis × A.
mangium hybrid [30]. We discovered more than one
isoform for half of the genes which failed to be detected
by EST sequencing. We identified a total of 18 isoforms
for each species whereas 16 orthologous isoforms were
shared in both species (Figure 2). All isoforms shared
high identities with the corresponding A. thaliana genes
where C3H shared the highest identity (68-85%), followed by PAL (71-84%), C4H (64-84%), CCoAOMT
(64-83%), HCT (72-78%), CAD (58-76%), COMT (74%),
CCR (73%), 4CL (57-71%) and F5H (59-62%). Our
observations that orthologous isoforms of Aa and Am
shared at least 99% similarity at both nucleotide and

Page 5 of 13

protein level while isoforms within the same family
usually do not share an exact match of more than 16
nucleotides are important in determining the number of
isoforms for both species.
The total assembled sequence lengths of the 36 isoforms ranged from 503 to 2,460 bp and only 14 contained complete open reading frame (ORF). No
polyadenylation site was observed as expected because
short polyA sequences failed to be assembled. One limitation of our sequence analysis is the presence of gap
region in the contigs. Half of the assembled sequences
contain gap regions with the total size range of 13 - 403
bp. These regions which were masked by Ns often
occur at low coverage area where two contigs or mate
pairs are connected during scaffolding. Although most
de novo assemblers can estimate the size of the gap

region, the predicted size is not always correct and
sometimes resulting in inaccurate protein prediction. It
is recommended to double-check the protein sequences
by translating each fragment in gapped assemblies using
other protein prediction software. Missing data poses a
challenge to sequence comparison and analysis and
therefore, gap filling by resequencing should be done in
the future.
The total number of isoforms detected in this study is
generally lower than those found in A. thaliana [36]
and P. trichocarpa [37]. The identified isoforms possessed 99% DNA sequence identity with previously characterized isoforms from A. auriculiformis × A. mangium
hybrid for the five isoforms that we examined, namely
PAL, C4H, COMT, CCoAOMT, and CAD [31]. The
high sequence similarity between of A. auriculiformis, A.
mangium and their hybrids will allow more efficient
cross amplification in gene isolation and characterization
efforts. Given that several isoforms were only found in
one species, greater sequencing depth is required for
our analysis to overcome incomplete assemblies and
sampling biases, previously observed in genomic
sequences of Pseudomonas syringae strains [47]. Nevertheless, transcriptome sequencing of other tissues such
as secondary xylem will provide more differentially
expressed isoforms which can be new targets for the
improvement of wood properties.
Identification of wood-related transcription factors

We found 1,306 Aa and 1,160 Am contigs with high
sequence identity (E-value ≤ 1E-10) corresponding to 72
and 73 families out of 82 A. thaliana transcription factor families downloaded from PlnTFDB [48]. The five
most abundant transcriptional gene families were
WKRY, Orphans, PHD, HB and the MYB-related group.
Several major classes of transcription factors involved in
lignin and wood formation were found in both species
(Figure 3A), generally in similar numbers of contigs,
although the NAC family was substantially more abundant in Aa. Additionally, eight Aa and nine Am contigs
were identified as class III HD-ZIP, a member of
Homeobox (HB) family.
Some members of the R2R3-MYB family are known to
be involved in controlling lignin deposition and secondary wall formation by interacting with other R2R3-MYB
genes, activated by NAC transcription factor master
switches and binding to AC elements [49]. The AC elements are cis-acting elements found in most promoters
of monolignol biosynthetic genes [36]. In this study, we
identified five contigs, two in Aa and three in Am,
which are homologous to R2R3-MYBs regulating woodrelated pathways in other plant species. In addition to
R2R3-MYBs, NtLIM1 in tobacco had been proven to
bind AC elements and its inhibition reduced lignin

content [50]. We found one Am contig which was
highly homologous to tobacco NtLIM1 with 86%
identity.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Acacia R2R3-MYB proteins with wood-related R2R3-MYBs from A. thaliana
and other plant species showed that they fall into three
groups (Figure 3B). In group one, three Acacia R2R3MYB proteins, namely AauMYB1, AmgMYB1 and AauMYB3 are close homologs of Arabidopsis MYB61 and
Pine MYB8 while AauMYB1 and AmgMYB1 are orthologs. Pine MYB8 is a close homolog of MYB61 whose
overexpression caused ectopic lignin deposition but the
exact functions are yet to be known [51,52]. Only one
Am R2R3-MYB protein (AmgMYB2) belongs to group
two which is a close homolog to Arabidopsis MYB20
and MYB43. MYB20, MYB42 and MYB43 are activated
by NAC master switches to regulate downstream MYB
proteins in wood-related pathways [53] whereas MYB85
can induce secondary wall biosynthetic genes [54].
Another member of this group, PineMYB1 is able to
bind AC elements [55] and is involved in secondary cell
wall deposition [51]. AauMYB2 belongs to group three
that clustered together with EgMYB1, AmMYB308,
ZmMYB31 and ZmMYB42, indicates an important role
in regulating the monolignol biosynthesis pathway.
EgMYB1 binds AC element and represses the monolignol biosynthesis pathway [56]. AmMYB308,
ZmMYB31 and ZmMYB42 have been shown to affect
lignin content by regulating the expression of lignin
genes [57,58].
Identification of microRNA genes and gene targets

For non-model species like Acacia, microRNAs (miRNAs) can be identified from the transcriptome data
based on homology searches against publicly available
databases [59]. We searched for miRNAs by comparing
our contigs to known plants miRNA stem-loop
sequences downloaded from miRbase [60]. We found
nine matching sequences from Aa corresponding to
eight conserved families (miR319, 396, 162, 160, 168,
166, 172 and 159) and one recently identified family
(miR2086). Four of these families (miR319, 396, 2086
and 166) were also found in Am. Most predicted
miRNA genes such as miR319, miR396, miR162,
miR166, miR168, miR172 are highly conserved in plants.
The number of miRNAs detected in this study was
lower compared to another study [61] because miRNAs
are most abundant in leaves and flowers.
Blastx results showed that all primary transcripts
except miR2086 have no significant hits to any proteincoding gene, suggesting that primary transcript
sequences are less conserved in plants. Primary transcripts of miR159 and miR166 were removed from
further analysis due to incomplete stem-loop structure

and missing mature miRNA sequence. The presence of
gap region in the stem loop sequences of miR396,
miR160 and miR172 in Aa resulted in inaccurate stemloop structure prediction. Therefore, PCR amplification
and sequencing were carried out to fill up the gap. The
secondary structures of miR319, miR396, miR2086,
miR160, miR162, miR168 and miR172 predicted by
Mfold were stable (Figure 4) and all except miR160 have
high MFEI values (Table 2). miR2086 is a relatively new
family highly expressed in the stem of M. truncatula
[62]. Blastx indicated that both primary transcripts of
miR2086 code for DNA glycosylase (E-value = 0.0). The
predicted target of miR2086 is nodulin-like protein suggesting it might play a role in nitrogen fixing pathway.
This family is predicted to be a legume-specific miRNA.
A total of 512 and 442 contigs in Aa and Am were
predicted to be the targets for 135 and 134 miRNA
families found in plants. Blastx results for the predicted
targets of several highly conserved miRNAs are

indicated in Table 3. We found known targets such as
Auxin Response Factor, APETALA 2, F-box protein,
Cc-NBS-LRR disease resistance genes and Heat Shock
Protein for miRNA 160, 172, and 396. We predicted
three wood-related genes, namely flavonol synthase-like,
xyloglucan fucosyltransferase and glucan synthase-like
genes to be the targets of miR170, miR172 and miR319,
respectively, suggesting that miRNAs might be directly
involved in the regulation of phenylpropanoid pathway
and hemicellulose biosynthesis pathway. Glucan
synthase is involved in the synthesis of xyloglucan which
make up the b-1,4-glucan backbone while xyloglucan
fucosyltransferase adds fructose sidechains to the backbone. Downregulation of flavonol synthase is predicted
to redirect the carbon flux towards lignin biosynthesis
as flavonoid biosynthesis uses 4-coumaroyl CoA as precursor. Functional analysis of these putative miRNA targets for potential role in wood formation should be
studied in the future.

Detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are abundant
markers that are suitable for a species with low genetic
diversity such as A. mangium [63]. For a non-model
species without genome sequences, we detected SNPs
by mapping all the reads to de novo contigs as reference.
We used only contigs at least 200 bp long to ensure sufficient flanking region for genotyping purposes.
Although paired-end reads provide more accurate alignments, a large fraction of our contigs were too short to
effectively utilize the paired end information, so we
mapped the reads as single-end data, which substantially
increased the number of mappable reads.
By using Bowtie default settings and allowing two mismatches, we detected a total of 30,837 Aa and 19,070
Am putative SNPs. After applying several filtering parameters to remove low coverage, low confidence, low
minor frequency allele and multi-allelic SNPs, the

putative SNPs number was further reduced to 16,648
and 9,335, respectively (Table 4). As expected, transition
SNPs occur almost twice as frequently as transversion
SNPs. One SNP was estimated to occur in every 1,123
bp and 1,704 bp in the Aa and Am transcriptomes,
respectively. Although these SNPs represent only a portion of the Acacia transcriptome, this study has provided a better SNPs estimation compared to a previous
study [31] which was based on the SNPs variation in
two lignin genes. Further investigations are being carried
to validate these SNPs which are useful for the construction of Acacia hybrid linkage map.

Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of Acacia auriculiformis and Acacia mangium. Our
results provide valuable genetic resources for further
investigation of lignin biosynthesis and wood-related

pathways in Acacia hybrids. As Next Generation
Sequencing and analytical techniques improve, whole
transcriptome sequencing using short read platforms
will be the most cost-effective way for significant discovery of genes, regulatory sequences and markers in previously unstudied plants.

Methods
Plant materials and RNA extraction

Plant materials were collected from one A. auriculiformis individual (AA6) and one A. mangium individual

(AM20) growing in the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM), Kepong. AA6 and AM20 are parents of an
Acacia hybrid mapping population. Both trees were
about 5 years old at the time of sampling. The trees
were propagated by marcotting the 4-year-old mother
trees in FRIM’s field station at Bidor, Perak and planting
took place at Bukit Hari field plot in FRIM Kepong in
2004. Three different tissues, namely young stem, intermediate inner bark and old inner bark tissues were
sampled. Young stem tissues consisted of ~5 cm of
non-lignified stem, starting from the shoot tip. Inner

SNP frequency

bark tissues from intermediate and old developmental
stages were sampled by cutting the largest branch on
each tree into two halves. The upper half represented
the intermediate stage while the lower half represented
the old stage. The halves were further cut into disks
about 3 cm each. The outer bark tissues were peeled off
and we collected the inner bark tissues by separating it
from the sapwood. The inner bark tissues are cut into
smaller pieces and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C until further use. RNA extraction
was carried out using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit for
each tissue. A single RNA sample for each individual
was generated from 20 μg RNA samples pooled from
each of the three tissues. The quality and quantity of
the RNA were evaluated using a Nanodrop ND-100
Spectrophotometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer. The RNA
Integrity Number (RIN) value given by Agilent Bioanalyzer was greater than 7.5. RNase inhibitor was added to
the RNA samples before sending to Canada’s Michael
Smith Genome Sciences Center where ribosomal RNA
depletion using Invitrogen Ribominus Kit, cDNA synthesis and library construction were carried out. Each
sample was subjected to one lane sequencing on an Illumina GAII platform.
De novo transcriptome assembly and annotation

Raw reads in QSEQ format were filtered and converted
to FASTQ format using a AWK command. Ribosomal
RNA was removed by mapping to A. thaliana 25S and
18S ribosomal RNA sequences using MUMMER [64]
and filtered by a custom Python script (available upon
request). The quality of the filtered reads was assessed
using Python script htseq-qa from HTSeq package
http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/
overview.html. The filtered reads were used in de novo
assembly using SOAPdenovo v1.03 [33] with all default
settings except -R option was enabled and the insert
size of 180-250 bp was used. SOAPdenovo performed
scaffolding using paired-end read information and
returned the assemblies in contigs and scaffolds. In this

paper, we used the term “contigs” to refer to both contigs and scaffolds. The sequencing depth was estimated
based on total length of the reads used in the assembly
divided by total size of transcriptome assemblies. The
contigs were searched against NCBI Non-redundant
Database using Blastn and Blastx (E-value ≤ 1e-10). All
the contigs were translated into protein sequences using
FrameDP [65]. To compare transcriptomes of Aa and
Am, we mapped single-end filtered reads from both species to both transcriptome assemblies separately using
Bowtie-0.12.3 [66] by allowing three mismatches and
ignoring quality score. We applied an iterative mapping
and filtering approach to the unmappable reads to find
out their origins. Using Bowtie and allowing three mismatches, the single-end filtered reads were mapped to
the both Acacia transcriptomes and other genomes as
reference in the following order: its corresponding de
novo contigs, de novo contigs from the other Acacia
species, A. thaliana organelles (TAIR8 mitochondrial
and chloroplast genomes) and M. truncatula genome
(Mt3.0). After each alignment, mapped reads were
removed using Bowtie’s –un command and mapped to
the next reference sequences. The remaining reads were
considered as unmapped reads. The raw reads of Aa
and Am were deposited on the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive (SRA) with accession number SRR098315 and
SRR098314.
Discovery of monolignol biosynthetic genes and isoforms

All monolignol biosynthetic genes and isoforms were
downloaded from the Arabidopsis Monolignol Biosynthesis Gene Families Database [67]. We searched the contigs for homologs of A. thaliana genes in monolignol
biosynthesis pathway using local NCBI Blast-2.2.23+
blastx algorithm (E-value ≤ 1E-10). The protein
sequences of the contigs were double-checked with
ExPASy Translate Tool http://expasy.org/tools/dna.html
and aligned with the corresponding A. thaliana genes
using ClustalW2 [68]. NCBI ORF finder [69] was used
to search for Open Reading Frame (ORF). The protein
sequences were checked for presence of conserved
amino acid motifs to distinguish members within the
same family. Protein identity shared between the isoforms and the closest A. thaliana isoforms were checked
using EMBOSS Matcher [70] available at http://mobyle.
pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py?#forms::matcher. The
nucleotide sequences were trimmed and deposited at
NCBI Transcriptome Shortgun Assembly (TSA) (Additional File 2). Protein and nucleotide sequences of the
monolignol genes of Aa × Am hybrid, namely PAL,
C4H, COMT, CCoAOMT and CAD were downloaded
from Genbank [Genbank: AAW78382.1, AAY86361.1,
ABD42947.1, ABX75853.1 and ABX75854.1] and aligned
to the homologs in Aa and Am using ClustalW2.

Identification of wood-related transcription factors

We downloaded 82 transcription factor and transcriptional regulatory families of A. thaliana from PlnTFDB
database[48]. We searched the translated contigs against
this database using local NCBI Blast-2.2.23+ blastp algorithm (E-value ≤ 1E-10). We further analyzed several
classes of wood-related transcription factors such as
MYB, LIM and HD-ZIPIII. Protein sequences of R2R3MYB [Genbank: CAE09058.1, CAE09057.1, NP_566467.2,
NP_172425.2, NP_567390.4, NP_176797.1, NP_197163.1,

XP_002313303.1, NP_187463.1, XP_002299944.1 SwissProt: P81395.1, P81393.1], LIM [Genbank: AT1G01780.1,
AT1G10200,
AT1G39900.1,
AT2G45800.1,
AT3G61230.1, AT3G55770.1] and HD-ZIPIII [Genbank:
AY919616.1-AY919623.1] from other plant species were
downloaded from NCBI Protein Database. To generate
the phylogenetic tree of R2R3-MYBs family, the full
length amino acid sequences of R2R3-MYBs from other
plant species and five homologous Acacia R2R3-MYBs,
namely AauMYB1, AauMYB2, AauMYB3, AmgMYB1,
AmgMYB2 [Genbank: JL052980, JL052981, JL052982,
JL053003, JL053004, JL053005] were used. The protein
sequences of homologous Acacia R2R3-MYBs were double-checked with ExPASy Translate Tool http://expasy.
org/tools/dna.html. All the sequences were aligned using
Bioedit ClustalW and the alignments were manually
improved (Additional File 3). The unrooted tree was constructed using MEGA 5 [71] with the neighbour-joining
method and 1,000 bootstraps (Poisson model and pairwise deletion).
Identification of MicroRNA genes and gene targets

Stem-loop sequences of all major plant miRNAs were
downloaded from miRbase database. The transcriptomes
of Aa and Am were searched for potential stem-loop
miRNAs using local NCBI Blast-2.2.23+ Blastn algorithm (E-value ≤ 1e-10). The matching sequences were
trimmed to 1,000 bp before submitting to miRbase
search tool to find stem-loop sequences and mature
miRNAs. For miR396, miR160 and miR172 in Aa, PCR
amplification and sequencing were carried out to find
the complete stem-loop sequences. Primers flanking the
gap region were designed based on primary transcript
sequences (Additional file 4). RNA was extracted from
inner bark tissues of the Aa individual (AA6) using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini kit. The quantity and quality of
the total RNA was checked using Nanodrop ND-1000
Spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis. 5 μg of total
RNA were treated with DNase and converted to cDNA
using Fermentas RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase. The PCR reaction consists of 300 ng cDNA, 1 ×

Page 11 of 13

PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.25 μM of
each primer and 1 U Vivantis Taq polymerase. The
amplification profile consists of 2 min incubation at 94°
C, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s,
72°C for 30 s and a final extension of 72°C for 10 min.
The specific PCR products were observed on 1% agarose
gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified using
Qiagen Gel Extraction kit. The purified PCR products
were cloned into Promega pGem-T Easy Vectors and
transformed into E. coli strain JM109. The transformed
bacteria were spread on a LB plate containing amplicilin, IPTG and X-gal before overnight incubation. Five
colonies for each plate were selected and grown overnight in LB broth containing amplicilin. PCR amplification using 1 μl of the culture pellet as DNA template
were carried out to select three positive colonies for
each primer pair. Plasmid was extracted using Qiagen
Qiaprep Spin Miniprep kit and sent to First Base
Laboratories Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia) for forward and
reverse sequencing using M13 primers. The sequence
data were analyzed using Bioedit and gap regions were
identified. Stem-loop sequences were extracted to predict secondary structures using Mfold 3.1 http://http://
mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/RNA-Folding-Form/.
The secondary structures were examined visually and
compared to the existing structures in the database. We
used modified method from Zhang et al. [72] to identify
miRNA genes except lower cutoff value of for Minimal
Folding Energy Index (MFEI) was set. miRNA genes
with complete stem-loop and mature miRNA sequences
are available in miRbase database. We assigned prefixes
aau- and amg- to represent A. auriculiformis and A.
mangium. The miRNA targets were identified in Aa and
Am transcriptomes by allowing 3 mismatches using a
custom search in psRNAtarget http://bioinfo3.noble.org/
psRNATarget/.
Detection of Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)

The filtered reads were mapped back to the reference
using Bowtie-0.12.3 by allowing two mismatches. Only
contigs at least 200 bp were used as reference. The generated SAM files were exported to Samtools 0.1.7 [73]
and converted to BAM format. We called SNPs using
Samtools’s Pileup command and removed any SNPs
with a SNP score less than 20. The putative SNPs were
further filtered using the following criteria: 1) Mapping
and SNP score more than 100; 2) SNPs must be covered
in at least 10 reads; 3) At least three non-reference
alleles are present; 4) SNPs must be bi-allelic; 5) Minor
allele frequency must be at least 5%; 6) Total frequency
of major and minor allele must be at least 0.95. All filtering was done using Awk and Python scripts (available
upon request).
