Abstract
Background: The f factor is a new parameter for accommodating the influence of both the
starting and ending states in the rate matrices of "generalized weighted frequencies" (+gwF) models
for sequence evolution. In this study, we derive an expected value for f, starting from a nearly
neutral model of weak selection, and then assess the biological interpretation of this factor with
evolutionary simulations.
Results: An expected value of f = 0.5 (i.e., equal dependency on the starting and ending states) is
derived for sequences that are evolving under the nearly neutral model of this study. However, this
expectation is sensitive to violations of its underlying assumptions as illustrated with the
evolutionary simulations.
Conclusion: This study illustrates how selection, drift, and mutation at the population level can
be linked to the rate matrices of models for sequence evolution to derive an expected value of f.
However, as f is affected by a number of factors that limit its biological interpretation, this factor
should normally be estimated as a free parameter rather than fixed a priori in a +gwF analysis.

Background
Felsenstein [1] was the first to introduce an evolutionary
model for DNA sequences, which allows for unequal
nucleotide frequencies (see also [2]). His F81 model
allows for substitutions at a rate proportional to the frequencies of the ending nucleotides. It is considered the
simplest rate matrix for accommodating variable nucleotide frequencies and is therefore the starting point for the
consideration of more complex models with frequency
variation (e.g., the HKY model of Hasegawa et al. [3]).
Goldman and Whelan [4] described new variants of these
F81-based models (their +gwF (generalized weighted frequencies) models; e.g., JC+gwF for Jukes and Cantor [5],
and K2P+gwF for Kimura [6]). At the heart of their +gwF
variants was a new free parameter (f) to accommodate the

frequencies of the starting, as well as ending, nucleotides
in the evolutionary process:

qij =

π 1− f
j
π if

sij ,

(1)

where qij refers to the substitution rate from nucleotide i to
j, πi and πj correspond to their equilibrium base frequencies, and sij is the exchangeability between the two. In the
+gwF variants, the substitution rate becomes more
dependent on the ending nucleotide as f decreases from 1
to 0, with f = 0 for the classic F81-type models.
This study starts with a population genetics model to
derive equations that link weak selection, genetic drift,

and mutation to the f parameter and evolutionary rate
matrices of the +gwF variants. These theoretical derivations lead to an expected value of f = 0.5. However, as
illustrated with simulations, the f parameter is complex
and thus its biological interpretation must be considered
with caution.

Results
Derivation of the rate matrix for the weak selection model
The nearly neutral model of molecular evolution states
that most DNA mutations of longer-term evolutionary
consequence are under weak selection and are therefore
prone to drift [7,8]. For a diploid population of size N, a
neutral mutation has a probability of 1/2N of becoming
fixed in the population. However, because of drift, even
slightly deleterious mutations can become fixed, but at a
probability of less than 1/2N. Advantageous mutations
have higher fixation probabilities than neutral mutations.
In the nearly neutral model, the distribution of alleles is
determined by an equilibrium of selection, drift, and
mutation.

Consider a number of sites under identical evolutionary
constraints and with a bias in nucleotide distribution.
Assume that weak selection and drift are the causes of this
bias; e.g., as for the codon usage biases in micro-organisms and Drosophila [9,10]. In our model, some nucleotides confer a slightly higher fitness onto the organism
than do others, regardless of their position, and these can
become fixed in the population through drift and/or
selection. Here, we also assume that selective advantages
are additive for the two alleles of the diploid organism
[11,12]. Let the selective advantages of the four nucleotides be given by sA, sC, sG, and sT. The differences
between these selection coefficients will be very close to
zero, since no strong selection is expected.

where µij is the mutation rate from i to j. For different i and
j, µij can vary because of unequal transition versus transversion rates (for example). Furthermore, let us assume
that the mutation rate is the same for either direction of
substitutions between i and j. This assumption is necessary to maintain the widely used condition of time reversibility in the evolutionary process, which thereby keeps
the following derivations tractable [1,13].
We then have:

qij

P( s) =

1 − e −4 Ne s

The substitution rate from nucleotide i to j is proportional
to P(sj - si):

Since qij/qji can be written as a function evaluated at sj
divided by the same function evaluated at si, evolution is
time reversible according to this model with:

π i ≈ ce 4 Ne si ⇔ si ≈

log π i + c ′.

( 5)

Here, c and c' are constants with c' = -l/4Ne log c, which
will be chosen to make the equilibrium frequencies sum
to one. The substitution rates can now be approximated
as:

= 4µij Ne ( s j − si )

when s ≠ 0. For s = 0, we have P(s) = 1/2N. This approximation is valid for small values of s, which is the case here.

Consider a mutation from nucleotide i to j, with a selective advantage of s = sj - si (a selective disadvantage exists
when s is negative). For a population of size N and an
effective size of Ne, Kimura [11] showed that the fixation
probability in this population is given by:

to equation (1) with f = 0.5 and an adjustment factor of:

This adjustment factor is close to one for moderate ratios
of π, with a horizontal tangent around πj/πi = 1 and a
slight bending downwards when deviating from this value
(Fig. 1). Thus, a value of f = 0.5 is suggested for the +gwF
variants according to these derivations of the weak selection model.

Evolutionary simulations
Evolutionary simulations were conducted to examine the
effects of violating certain assumptions in the above
model of weak selection. Unless otherwise noted, these
simulations were based on the K2P+gwF model with f =
0.5 and k = 2 (for the transition/transversion ratio).
Simulations consisted of four sequences of length 10,000
and relied on a symmetric rooted phylogeny with all
branch lengths equal to 0.10 expected substitutions per
site under the model in question [i.e., ((seq1:0.10,
seq2:0.10):0.10, (seq3:0.10, seq4:0.10):0.10)]. Violations
of the weak selection model were incorporated in the simulations by: (1) heterogeneous sequences with sites drawn
from different equilibrium base frequencies; (2) populations in disequilibrium due to changing Ne; and (3) an
accelerated C to T substitution rate. Estimates of f for the
simulated sequences were made with the K2P+gwF
model. Forty simulations were run for each test condition,
with the results for the f estimates summarized as their

means and twice their standard errors. In the first set of
simulations, six categories of sites with different equilibrium distributions were considered (Table 1). The f estimates for the simulations with each category alone were
not significantly different from 0.5 (i.e., the value under
which the sequences were generated). In contrast, for the
simulated heterogeneous sequences (i.e., those composed
of equal numbers of sites from two or three different categories), their values of f varied significantly in either
direction from 0.5. Analogous results were obtained for
the simulations of homogeneous and heterogeneous
sequences under the HKY model (with f = 0.0 instead of
0.5). Thus, the value of f can vary considerably when heterogeneous sequences are analyzed with a +gwF model.
Here, such deviations are a consequence of using a single
rate matrix to analyze sequences that were derived from
two or three different ones.

A

Category A

In the second set of simulations, Ne was kept constant
until the time of the most recent common ancestor for the
four simulated sequences. Then, Ne was either left
unchanged or was suddenly changed by a certain factor.
The latter was done by replacing the rate matrix derived
from equation (4), resulting in new equilibrium frequencies of the nucleotides. When Newas kept constant, the
selective pressures and drift were left unchanged, thereby
maintaining the same starting equilibrium frequencies
throughout the phylogeny. Thus, the corresponding f estimates did not significantly differ from 0.5 (Fig. 2). In contrast, increases in Ne lowered the value of f as the efficiency
of selection was increased relative to drift [4]. Correspondingly, the evolutionary process became more dominated by the ending nucleotide. This increasing
dominance can be expected to continue until a new equilibrium is restored (which occurs on a longer time scale
than that in these simulations).

In the third set of simulations, an acceleration in the C to
T substitution rate was incorporated, thereby modeling an
increase in their mutation rate due to the deamination of
methylated C's in CpG pairs [14]. The introduction of this
bias resulted in significant deviations of f in either direction from 0.5, even though their sequences were simulated in equilibrium (Fig. 2). Thus, the value of f can vary
considerably when the rates for reciprocal mutations are
unequal.

Discussion
This study illustrates how selection, drift, and mutation
within a population can be linked to the f parameter and
rate matrices of the +gwF variants for sequence evolution.
Our weak selection model relies on the fixation
probabilities of mutant alleles with additive genie selection and equal mutation rates for reciprocal substitutions.
What is now needed are additional studies that link other
population genetics models to the +gwF variants [9]. For
example, the population genetics models of Li [15], which
focus on allele frequency distributions and different
modes of selection and mutation, could be studied for
their connections to the f parameter and +gwF rate
matrices.
Collectively, the three sets of simulations highlight that
the f parameter is complex and can be influenced by a
number of different factors [4]. This complexity limits its
biological interpretation and the use of its expected value
of 0.5 as derived for the weak selection model. Correspondingly, in many +gwF analyses, f ill need to be estimated as a free parameter rather than fixed beforehand.
Goldman and Whelan [4] focused on amino acid
sequences, where they found that the +gwF models provided better fits to the majority of their protein data sets.
They also analyzed two rather small nucleotide data sets
for which the general reversible model (REV) outperformed the +gwF variants. As noted by them, the REV
model provides enough free parameters to cover the
effects of a +gwF analysis. Thus, given sufficient data, this
model will consistently outperform the simpler +gwF
variants, since it can always accommodate more of the
evolutionary process by virtue of its extra parameters.
Nevertheless, as widely acknowledged, simpler models
have their place, since they allow one to maximize
analytical power for more limited data, while minimizing
the risk of over-parameterization [13,16]. Thus, as for the
JC, K2P, and HKY models, we expect their +gwF variants
to remain of interest as part of the hierarchy of simple to
complex models for sequence evolution.
