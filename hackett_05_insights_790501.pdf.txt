Abstract
Background: Dinoflagellates are important marine primary producers and grazers and cause toxic
"red tides". These taxa are characterized by many unique features such as immense genomes, the
absence of nucleosomes, and photosynthetic organelles (plastids) that have been gained and lost
multiple times. We generated EST sequences from non-normalized and normalized cDNA libraries
from a culture of the toxic species Alexandrium tamarense to elucidate dinoflagellate evolution.
Previous analyses of these data have clarified plastid origin and here we study the gene content,
annotate the ESTs, and analyze the genes that are putatively involved in DNA packaging.
Results: Approximately 20% of the 6,723 unique (11,171 total 3'-reads) ESTs data could be
annotated using Blast searches against GenBank. Several putative dinoflagellate-specific mRNAs
were identified, including one novel plastid protein. Dinoflagellate genes, similar to other
eukaryotes, have a high GC-content that is reflected in the amino acid codon usage. Highly
represented transcripts include histone-like (HLP) and luciferin binding proteins and several genes
occur in families that encode nearly identical proteins. We also identified rare transcripts encoding
a predicted protein highly similar to histone H2A.X. We speculate this histone may be retained for
its role in DNA double-strand break repair.
Conclusion: This is the most extensive collection to date of ESTs from a toxic dinoflagellate.
These data will be instrumental to future research to understand the unique and complex cell
biology of these organisms and for potentially identifying the genes involved in toxin production.

Background
Dinoflagellates play critical roles in marine ecosystems as
primary producers and grazers of other bacterial and

eukaryotic plankton [1]. Approximately one-half of the ca.
4,000 species of dinoflagellates contain plastids, although
many are mixotrophic [2]. Many taxa produce potent

toxins and form harmful algal blooms, or "red tides",
resulting from populations of more than 20 million cells
per liter of seawater. The toxins cause a variety of poisonings that affect humans and marine wildlife [1] and have
a significant impact on coastal ecosystems throughout the
world [3]. Yet, other dinoflagellates, like Symbodinium, are
central contributors to the health of reef ecosystems as the
symbionts of corals [4]. Loss of the dinoflagellate symbiont results in coral bleaching. In addition to their ecological role, dinoflagellates display some fascinating and
unique aspects of cell biology. One intriguing character is
nuclear biology. The nucleus of dinoflagellates is unlike
that of any other eukaryote because the chromosomes are
condensed throughout the cell cycle except during DNA
replication [5]. The morphologically similar chromosomes are attached to the nuclear envelope and can
number in the hundreds [6]. Dinoflagellates also lack
nucleosomes [7], instead the nuclear DNA is associated
with basic proteins that are moderately similar to bacterial
histone-like proteins (HLPs [8,9]). Dinoflagellates were
thought to lack histones [10], but in a recent gene expression study, a putative histone H3 was annotated in Pyrocystis lunula, although the sequence was not analyzed
further [11]. The general lack of nucleosomes raises many
questions about transcription and gene regulation in
these organisms. Dinoflagellate nuclei also contain vast
amounts of DNA compared to other eukaryotes. Estimates
range from 3 – 250 pg·cell-1, or approximately 3,000 –
215,000 megabases (MB) [12]. In comparison, human
nuclei contain 3.2 pg·cell-1 (3,180 MB). The dinoflagellate nucleus contains such a high concentration of DNA
that it exists in a liquid crystal state, which is responsible
for the unique morphology [13,14]. The DNA to basic
protein ratio of dinoflagellate chromosomes has been
estimated to be 10:1, which is dramatically higher than
the 1:1 ratio observed in most eukaryotes. This indicates
that very little basic protein is associated with dinoflagellate chromosomes and that the crystal structure is the primary cause of the unusual morphology. Dinoflagellates
are also the only eukaryotes to contain hydroxymethyluracil, a deaminated nucleotide that can be produced by
oxidative damage of DNA, which replaces 12 – 70% of the
thymidine [15]. The role of polyploidy or potentially,
genome amplification within particular life history stages
remains to be clarified for dinoflagellates. It is highly
unlikely, however, given their relatively simple morphology that the immense DNA content is explained solely by
gene content.
The most widespread plastid in dinoflagellates contains
the unique photopigment peridinin. The "peridinin plastid" is remarkably different from this organelle in other
eukaryotes because it lacks a typical genome. Plastids normally contain a circular genome of about 150 kb that
encodes 100 – 200 genes that are necessary for plastid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/80

function. In peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, the
plastid genome has been broken into minicircles that
encode a single, or a few genes per circle. However, only
16 genes have been identified thus far on minicircles
[16,17]. Recent studies show that most of the plastid
genes have been transferred to the nucleus [18,19] with 15
of these genes found exclusively on the plastid genome in
all other photosynthetic eukaryotes [18]. The peridinin
dinoflagellates encode therefore the smallest number of
plastid genes of any photosynthetic eukaryote, making
them a model for understanding organellar gene transfer.
Nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are targeted to the plastid using a tripartite N-terminal targeting signal [20]. As in
Euglena, nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and
embedded in this membrane using a stop-transfer
sequence in the N-terminus. Through algal endosymbioses, the dinoflagellates have been able to acquire four
other types of plastids from distantly related evolutionary
lineages including the haptophytes, cryptophytes, diatoms, and prasinophytes [1,21]. This aspect of their evolutionary history highlights the unmatched ability of
dinoflagellates to capture and retain foreign plastids.
Alexandrium tamarense is one of the best-studied dinoflagellates. This species forms toxic blooms and causes paralytic shellfish poisoning through saxitoxin production. It
has a peridinin-containing plastid and in North America,
A. tamarense blooms from Alaska to Southern California
in the Pacific and along the Canadian and New England
coasts in the Atlantic. There has been a recent increase in
blooms of A. tamarense and other Alexandrium species in
other parts of the world making this genus of high importance to the world's fisheries. We undertook a gene discovery project with this organism using expressed sequence
tag (EST) data to investigate dinoflagellate evolution and
to create a genomic resource for scientists working on different aspects of A. tamarense and dinoflagellate biology.
The EST method was the most reasonable approach in this
case because haploid A. tamarense cells contain approximately 143 chromosomes and have a genome size of 200
pg/cell (ca. 200,000 Mb [Erdner and Anderson unpublished data]). Our EST results comprise the first extensive
high-throughput, genome-wide data set for a
dinoflagellate.

Results and discussion
Clustering and sequence analyses
The collection of 11,171 ESTs comprised of single-pass 3'reads (483 from the start library and 10,688 from the normalized library) from A. tamarense was assembled into
6,723 clusters. The normalized library showed a high
degree of complexity, with a novelty rate of 60.18% and
about 52% of the sequenced clones contained inserts that
were longer than the single sequence read (ca. 750 bp).

Clustering of the total EST set showed that most of the
reads were singletons (4,618 sequences) and the largest
cluster was comprised of 46 ESTs that are closely related to
HLPs (Table 1). Other highly represented transcripts were
those encoding luciferin-binding protein (a protein
involved in the regulation of bioluminescence) and several photosynthetic proteins (e.g., Rubisco, ATP synthase
C chain, light harvesting proteins). Several large clusters
were transcripts that lacked a similarity (e-value < e-5) to
known proteins. One of these ESTs has an open reading
frame that encodes a protein with a potential plastid-targeting signal (Figure 1A). Interestingly, database searches
against NCBI's nr and dbEST returned hits only to other
dinoflagellate ESTs. Another of the largest clusters only
had hits to ESTs from other dinoflagellates (Figure 1B).
These two proteins are therefore candidates for dinoflagellate-specific proteins.
Each cluster was searched against the SwissProt protein
database using blastx. A total of 515 hits with an e-value
less than 1e-20 were identified that terminated within 10
amino acids of the end of the SwissProt entry. From these
hits, we estimated that the 3'-UTRs ranged in length from
25 – 620 nt with a mean length of 155 nt. This is shorter
than the average length observed for fungi (~200 nt) and
metazoans (300–600 nt) [22]. However, this analysis is
likely to be an underestimate of the average 3'-UTR length
because only ESTs that were sequenced into the coding
region were included in the analysis. The 3'-UTRs of A.
tamarense cDNAs are also interesting because of their
apparent lack of a polyA signal. Both simple n-mer
searches (e.g. hexamer, pentamer) and the Gibb's sampler
were used to assay the canonical region from -11 to -30
preceding the polyadenylation site in search of a polyadenylation signal. We were unable to find a single or a
related set of hexamers or pentamers that are enriched in

the 3'-UTRs (data not shown). Clearly, polyadenylation of
transcripts occurs in A. tamarense, however, the mechanism by which this process takes place apparently does
not involve a typical polyA signal. These ESTs were also
analyzed for GC-content and codon usage. Coding region
GC-content was 60.8%, whereas GC-content in the 3'UTR was slightly less at 57.6%. The GC-content is
reflected in the codon usage (Table 2), whereby 3rd positions are strongly biased towards Gs or Cs. The stop codon
TGA is also significantly favoured over TAG and TAA (frequencies of 411, 71, and 25 occurrences, respectively).
The accession numbers of SwissProt hits with an e-value
of 9e-10 and below (1,292 sequences) were submitted to
the ProToGo server for GO category assignment [23]. A
total of 1,203 of the SwissProt accession numbers could
be assigned to GO categories. The results are summarized
in Figure 2. The functional distribution of the A. tamarense
ESTs that could be placed among GO categories is typical
of other eukaryotes. However, the overall small number
(i.e., 20%) of significant hits to GenBank is surprising,
suggesting that many A. tamarense proteins may be either
highly diverged and/or encode novel dinoflagellate-specific functions (e.g., Figure 1), or the sequence does not
extend into the coding region of the transcript.
Dinoflagellate gene content and gene families
Of species with sequenced genomes, the apicomplexan
Plasmodium falciparum is the most closely related organism to A. tamarense. Both of these species are members of
the alveolate lineage with dinoflagellates and apicomplexans forming a monophyletic clade that is sister to the
ciliates (e.g., [23]). Sequence comparisons using BLAST
revealed that 609 of the 6723 A. tamarense ESTs had a significant hit (e-value less than 1e-10) to P. falciparum proteins. The top 20 most significant hits are shown in Table
3. The most highly conserved proteins between these

organisms include many "housekeeping" proteins such as
α-tubulin and heat shock protein 70. Despite their close
evolutionary relationship, there are however likely to be
substantial differences between A. tamarense and P. falciparum with respect to gene content. Due to the apicomplexan intracellular lifestyle, P. falciparum has lost most of
the genes related to plastid function as well as other
metabolic genes. Many of these same proteins appear in
the list of the top BLAST hits against the nr database of
GenBank (Table 4). There were 1,349 hits to the nr database that were better than 1e-10.

As previously mentioned, our bioinformatic analyses
identified 6,723 clusters of unique genes. However, this is
likely to be a conservative estimate of the number of
unique transcripts that were sequenced. A combination of
short 3'-UTRs and highly conserved coding regions caused
many related transcripts to be assembled together, even
though their 3'-UTRs contained sequence differences. For
example, two large clusters comprise ESTs that correspond
to the plastid atpH gene that encodes the ATP synthase C
chain. This gene is normally plastid encoded in other photosynthetic eukaryotes. These two clusters form closely

related, but clearly distinct sets of transcripts. An additional atpH-encoding transcript was identified by a single
EST. Together, the three clusters contain 43 ESTs, 16 of
which are unique. The N-terminal extensions, which
encode the tripartite plastid-targeting signals, share an
average 74.3% nucleotide and 68.6% amino acid identity,
respectively. Similar to many other species, the dinoflagellate transit peptides appear to be under selection to maintain hydrophobicity rather than a conserved amino acid
sequence. This may explain why the nucleotide conservation is greater than that of the encoded amino acids. Five
hydrophobic amino acids (phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine) are, for example, encoded

by codons with a T in the second position. This combined
with the high GC-content at third positions results in
higher conservation at second and third positions than at
first positions. In addition, the high proportion of alanine
(28.6%), leucine (10.2%), and valine (11.8%) rather than
phenylalanine (2.4%), isoleucine (3.6%), methionine
(4.3%, excluding starting methionine), and tyrosine
(0.3%) in the N-terminal extensions may reflect the
underlying GC-richness, because alanine, leucine, and
valine are encoded by GC-rich codons. It is unclear if these
amino acids are evolutionarily selected for specifically, or
if they are selected for the combination of their hydrophobic character and the GC-content of their codons. In con-

Analysis is of 515 proteins (81,893 codons). Third position nucleotide usage was T = 12.8%, A = 9.3%, C = 40.7%, G = 37.2%. The asterisk (*)
indicates a stop codon.

trast, the conserved core of the protein shared an average
88.4% nucleotide and 98% amino acid identity, respectively, which corresponds to the more typical pattern of
third position variation resulting from selection. The 3'UTRs of the atpH genes show substantial variation and
were difficult to align. There are several groups of more
closely related 3'-UTRs that may be the result of recently
duplicated genes. In all, there are five alignable groups of
UTRs (and one singleton) that may have originated from
more closely related genes.
Histone and histone-like proteins in dinoflagellates
A significant finding of this study is the identification of
two rare (2/11,171) ESTs that encode a partial histone
H2A.X. The longest cDNA isolated from the library using
PCR was predicted to encoded a protein of 169 amino
acids that shares high sequence identity to eukaryotic histone H2A.X (Figure 3A). This clone putatively lacked only
the start codon at the N-terminus. The divergent N-terminus of A. tamarense H2A.X is somewhat longer than in
other homologs but the remainder of the sequence is conserved (in particular the α-helices of the histone fold).
Several functional residues from the known crystal structure are also present in A. tamarense H2A.X including the
lysine at the trypsin cleavage site, the arginines in the
loops that interact with the DNA α-helix, and the lysine
ubiquitination site [24]. The sites of interaction with histone H2B are also present.

H2A.X proteins are closely related to the canonical H2A
except for the C-terminus which contains the distinctive
SQ(E/D)Φ motif (where Φ is a hydrophobic residue).
H2A.X plays an important role in the recognition and
repair of double-strand DNA breaks by non-homologous
end-joining. At the site of double-strand breaks, the serine
of the SQ(E/D)Φ motif is rapidly phosphorylated [25].
The phosphorylation signal spreads a large distance down
the chromosome around the breaks, signalling the recruitment of the DNA repair proteins Rad50, Rad51, and
BRCA1 [26,27]. We also identified histone H2A and
H2A.X from the haptophyte Emilania huxleyi through
high-throughput EST sequencing of this alga (J. D. H. and
D. B. unpublished data). Phylogenetic analysis places A.
tamarense H2A.X in its predicted position (with moderate
bootstrap support) as sister to the E. huxleyi homolog
within a group of chromalveolates that includes haptophytes, stramenopiles, and apicomplexans (Figure 3B).
H2A.X from A. tamarense, E. huxleyi, and Toxoplasma gondii
do not, however, form a monophyletic group suggesting
multiple origins within chromalveolates. This is not surprising because H2A.X appears to have arisen independently many times during eukaryotic evolution [28,29].
We tested the strength of these results using the Approximately Unbiased (AU-) statistical test. A 16-taxon ML
backbone tree was generated without A. tamarense H2A.X
and then we made a set of 17-taxon trees by placing this
sequence on every possible branch (29 in total). This anal-

Dinoflagellate chromosomes do not contain nucleosomes, instead the DNA is associated with HLPs

[10,30,31]. The similarity between dinoflagellate HLPs
and bacterial HU and HLPs has only recently been noted
and these proteins have not yet been subjected to phylogenetic analysis with a broad taxon sampling [32]. In our

sented transcripts (45/11,171 ESTs) and encoded 5
closely related proteins. Alignment of the HLPs from A.
tamarense and other dinoflagellates with HLPs and HU
proteins from bacteria and eukaryotes showed moderate
sequence similarity (a representative alignment is shown
in Figure 4A). This alignment was constructed using information from secondary structure predictions (discussed
below).
One group of proteins (referred to here as bacterial HLPs)
is more closely related to dinoflagellate HLPs and includes
Bph2 from Bordetella pertussis. Bph2 has a role in virulence
gene expression and shares limited (likely convergent)
sequence similarity with histone H1 [33]. The
dinoflagellate and bacterial HLPs also contain an N-terminal extension in comparison to HU proteins. This extension is rich in alanine, lysine, and proline, which is
reminiscent of the C-terminus of histone H1. The dinoflagellate HLP N-termini are however, also enriched in
methionines. Compared to the bacterial HLPs, this N-terminal region is generally shorter in the dinoflagellates,
although there is variability among species in both groups
(Figure 4A). In contrast to the primary sequence,
secondary structure predictions for these three classes of
proteins are remarkably similar. The crystal structure of E.
coli HU has been determined (PBD ID: 1MUL) and the
known secondary structure was compared to the predicted
secondary structures of B. pertussis Bph2 and an A. tamarense HLP (Figure 4B). Both types of HLPs are predicted to
have two α-helices that are identical in size and spacing to
the N-terminal helices in E. coli HU, followed by two βstrands that are similar in size and position. We conclude
from this analysis that dinoflagellate HLPs show
structural similarity to HU proteins from bacteria, however, it is unclear if these proteins are functional
homologs. It is also apparent that dinoflagellate HLPs are
distantly related to bacterial HU proteins. The dinoflagellates have one putatively homologous functional residue
corresponding to Lys3 (arrow in Figure 4A) of HU
proteins, which interacts with the DNA and is involved in
wrapping the DNA around the protein [34]. A proline residue (asterisk in Figure 4A), which intercalates into the
DNA during HU binding, appears to be conserved among
HU proteins and bacterial HLPs, but is not present in the
dinoflagellate HLPs [35]. However, there are several prolines conserved among dinoflagellates in the C-terminal
end of the protein. The C-terminal arms of HU are critical
for the interactions that bend the DNA. Given the low
level of sequence similarity and the absence of a
homologous proline in this region, it is unclear if the
dinoflagellate HLPs are able to interact with DNA in the
same manner as HU proteins.
In our phylogenetic analyses, the proteobacterial HLPs
form a well-supported monophyletic group with the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/80

dinoflagellates (Figure 4C) suggesting an origin of the
dinoflagellate gene through lateral transfer (followed by
several rounds of gene duplication). It is also noteworthy
that dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotes to possess a
proteobacterial form II rubisco [36]. The position of the
dinoflagellate HLPs is distinct from that of other eukaryotic HU proteins. These latter proteins group with the
canonical HU proteins from bacteria and have likely originated through intracellular transfer from the mitochondrial or plastid endosymbiont. Statistical support for the
monophyly of the dinoflagellate and proteobacterial
HLPs was tested using the AU-test. In these analyses
(details not shown), a sister group relationship between
the HLPs was the most highly favored topology (P =
0.659) and all other positions for the dinoflagellates
(except branching inside the bacterial HLP clade) had significantly lower probabilities (P < 0.05).
Dinoflagellates no longer use the nucleosome as the
major DNA packaging protein complex. Chromosomal
DNA strands in these taxa are smooth, in contrast to the
"beads on a string" conformation in other eukaryotes
[12]. The chromosome structure is also unique in that
they are uniform in size and morphology, remain condensed throughout the cell cycle, and are birefringent,
indicating a liquid crystal state [5,14,37]. Transcription is
thought to take place in DNA loops that protrude from
the condensed chromosome [38]. It appears that dinoflagellates have acquired DNA binding proteins from a
proteobacterium possibly to facilitate the compaction of
their immense genomes. HU and related proteins from
bacteria induce sharp bends in DNA strands and some
models suggest that HLPs are responsible for creating
DNA bends at the periphery of the chromosomes [39,40].
Immunolocalization shows dinoflagellate HLP to be associated with the periphery of chromosomes [41].
However, the HLP concentration is very low relative to
DNA content. Dinoflagellate chromosomes have a 1:10
protein:DNA ratio (in contrast to the 1:1 ratio in other
eukaryotes). The HLP concentration may therefore be too
low to function in DNA compaction, rather they may act
as transcriptional regulators [41,42].
In summary, our discovery of H2A.X in A. tamarense
shows that, whereas dinoflagellates appear to no longer
use nucleosomes for DNA packaging, at least one histone
has been retained and is weakly expressed. Interestingly,
in a recent paper, histone H3 appears in a table of redoxregulated genes in the dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula [11].
Until now, only these two histones have been identified
in dinoflagellates and it is unclear if all dinoflagellates
possess either of these two genes, or others that have not
yet been found. If other histones are present (which is
likely), they may however also be expressed at a low level

(as is the case for A. tamarense H2A.X). This would render
difficult their identification using the EST-based approach
unless comprehensive sequencing of normalized and subtracted cDNA libraries is used. In metazoans, replicationdependant canonical histone (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4)
mRNAs are not polyadenylated, raising the possibility
that they have been excluded from this poly-A primed
cDNA library [43]. However, these histone mRNAs are
polyadenylated in plants, apicomplexans, and ciliates,
suggesting that if they are present, they may be in dinoflagellates as well [44-46]. Given the important role that
H2A.X plays in DNA repair, we speculate that this gene
may have been maintained specifically to perform this
function. Consistent with this idea, the core region of A.
tamarense H2A.X is highly conserved, indicating that it
may still be able to interact with DNA in a manner similar
to H2A in other species.

Conclusion
This collection of ESTs is the most extensive genomic
resource for a toxic dinoflagellate species to date and provides a useful glimpse into its nuclear genome. These data
will be instrumental to future research to understand the
unique and complex cell biology of these organisms and
for understanding the method of toxin production in
these species. We have likely not yet exhausted the gene
discovery potential using the EST approach (i.e., note the
high discovery rate of our normalized library). In the
future, we will use serial subtraction of cDNA libraries to
improve/maintain the novelty rate of our cDNA library
and create cDNA libraries from A. tamarense under various
growth conditions and life history stages to get generate a
more complete catalog of the gene content of this important organism.

Methods
Library construction
Total RNA from a culture of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (CCMP 1598) was extracted using Trizol (GibcoBRL) and mRNA purified using the Oligotex
mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen). This culture strain was produced by isolating a single cyst, a diploid resting stage that
produces haploid vegetative cells by meiosis. However, it
is unknown if a single or multiple vegetative cells were
isolated after antibiotic treatment to make the culture
axenic. If a single vegetative cell was isolated, the culture
would be clonal. The culture was grown at 20°C on a
13:11 hour light:dark cycle (80 µEinsteins of light) in L1
media. Start and normalized directionally cloned (3'
NotI-5'EcoR1) cDNA libraries were constructed as previously described [47]. ESTs were sequenced from the 3' end
to maximize clustering accuracy using the 3' untranslated
region (UTR). All ESTs were processed as previously
described [48]. Identification of a total of a non-redundant "unigene" set of 6,723 unique clusters from 11,171

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/80

sequences was accomplished using using UIcluster v3.0.5
[49].
Phylogenetic analyses
Data was gathered from GenBank (including the recently
released Karenia brevis EST data, Frances Van Dolah,
unpublished data) using blast searches. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were done with PHYLIP using the JTT
model of protein evolution with gamma corrected rates
(JTT + Γ) with 5 random additions [50]. ML bootstrap
analyses (100 replications) were done as described with
either 5 (histone H2A) or 1 (HLPs) rounds of random
taxon addition. Bayesian analyses were done using
MrBayes V3.0b4 [51]. Four chains (1 cold, 3 heated) were
run for 1 million generations, sampled every 1000 generations, using the JTT + Γ model. The first 500 trees were
discarded as burn-in. Neighbor joining (NJ) bootstrap
(500 replicates) analyses were done with PHYLIP using
the JTT + Γ model. Minimum evolution (ME) analyses
done with PHYLIP using the JTT + Γ model with global
rearrangements and 10 rounds of random taxon addition
(1 round was used in the bootstrap analysis).

The Approximately Unbiased test was done using CONSEL [52]. ML trees without the groups of interest were generated as described above. A pool of trees was then
generated by adding the group of interest (A. tamarense
H2A.X or dinoflagellate HLPs) to every possible branch in
the ML tree. For the HLP analyses, a reduced taxon set was
used that included Bordetella, Ralstonia, Xylella, Pasteurella,
Nostoc, Synechocystis, Agrobacterium, Rikettsia, Escherichia,
Guillardia, Cyanidioschyzon, Sorghum, Toxoplasma, Xenopus,
and Homo. A. tamarense 1 and C. cohnii HCC2 were added
as a monophyletic group to every branch in this reduced
ML tree. Secondary structure prediction was done using
Jpred [53, 54]. The consensus secondary structures were
used in the comparison to the know structure of E. coli
HU (PDB ID: 1MUL).
