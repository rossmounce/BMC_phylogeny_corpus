Abstract
Background: About 45% of the human genome is comprised of mobile transposable elements or "junk DNA".
The exaptation or co-option of these elements to provide important cellular functions is hypothesized to have
played a powerful force in evolution; however, proven examples are rare. An ancient primate-specific Alu short
interspersed element (SINE) put the human CAMP gene under the regulation of the vitamin D pathway by
providing a perfect vitamin D receptor binding element (VDRE) in its promoter. Subsequent studies
demonstrated that the vitamin D-cathelicidin pathway may be a key component of a novel innate immune
response of human to infection. The lack of evolutionary conservation in non-primate mammals suggested that
this is a primate-specific adaptation. Evidence for evolutionary conservation of this regulation in additional primate
lineages would provide strong evidence that the TLR2/1-vitamin D-cathelicidin pathway evolved as a biologically
important immune response mechanism protecting human and non-human primates against infection.
Results: PCR-based amplification of the Alu SINE from human and non-human primate genomic DNA and
subsequent sequence analysis, revealed perfect structural conservation of the VDRE in all primates examined.
Reporter gene studies and induction of the endogenous CAMP gene in Rhesus macaque peripheral blood
mononuclear cells demonstrated that the VDREs were conserved functionally. In addition, New World monkeys
(NWMs) have maintained additional, functional steroid-hormone receptor binding sites in the AluSx SINE that
confer retinoic acid responsiveness and provide potential thyroid hormone receptor binding sites. These sites
were less well-conserved during human, ape and Old World monkey (OWM) evolution and the human CAMP
gene does not respond to either retinoic acid or thyroid hormone.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that the VDRE in the CAMP gene originated from the exaptation of an AluSx
SINE in the lineage leading to humans, apes, OWMs and NWMs and remained under purifying selection for the
last 55–60 million years. We present convincing evidence of an evolutionarily fixed, Alu-mediated divergence in
steroid hormone nuclear receptor gene regulation between humans/primates and other mammals. Evolutionary
selection to place the primate CAMP gene under regulation of the vitamin D pathway potentiates the innate
immune response and may counter the anti-inflammatory properties of vitamin D.

Background
The pioneering work of Britten and colleagues showed
that eukaryotic genomes contain significant amounts of
repetitive DNA [1,2]. They theorized that repetitive DNA
might provide binding sites for transcriptional factors,
thus influencing gene expression patterns [3]. Furthermore, it was postulated that the movement of repetitive
sequences in the genome could generate a source of evolutionary variation for gene expression [4]. The human
genome project has revealed that 44% of the human
genome is comprised of mobile transposable elements
[5]. Changes in regulation of gene expression by these elements may play an important role in the evolution of
human and primate-specific responses to infectious disease.
The primate-specific Alu family of mobile, middle repetitive short-interspersed elements (SINEs) constitutes about
10% of the human genome [6,7]. They have an increased
concentration of transcription factor binding sites and
examples of their potential to control gene transcription
both positively and negatively have been described [8-11].
We recently identified the insertion of an AluSx SINE in
the promoter of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial
peptide (CAMP) gene that provides an essential cis-element that may be crucial for an effective innate immune
response in humans [12]. The element provides a perfect
consensus sequence for binding by the vitamin D receptor
(VDR) and confers vitamin D-responsiveness to the
CAMP gene in a number of tissues and cell types [12-16].
Prior studies using both deletional and site-directed mutagenesis of the VDRE located in the AluSx of the human
CAMP promoter demonstrated that it is sufficient and
essential for induction of the CAMP gene by VDR [1214,16]. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation
showed binding of the VDR to this site [12].
In vitro studies demonstrated that activation of the vitamin D pathway by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
19-kDa lipoprotein via TLR2/1 leads to induction of
CAMP and a potential innate immune response against
Mtb infection [17,18]. Furthermore, injury to the skin
induces TGFβ-mediated activation of the vitamin D pathway, induction of CAMP and activation of TLR2 and
CD14 expression [19]. This enables keratinocytes to recognize pathogens and protect the wound from infection
[19]. Taken together, these studies argue that the vitamin
D-cathelicidin pathway is a key component of a novel
innate immune response to infection.
We demonstrated that regulation of the CAMP gene by
VDR and its ligand 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 is not evolutionarily conserved in mice, rats or dogs because the promoters of their genes lack a VDRE [12]. The AluSx SINE
containing the VDRE was present in the promoters of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/321

both chimps and humans suggesting that this immune
response is a primate-specific adaptation [12]. Evidence
for the evolutionary conservation of this regulation in
additional primate lineages would provide strong evidence that the TLR2/1-vitamin D-cathelicidin pathway
evolved as a biologically important immune response
mechanism for protecting human and non-human primates against infection.
We hypothesized that the AluSx containing the VDRE
would be evolutionarily conserved in humans, apes, Old
World monkeys (OWMs) and New World monkeys
(NWMs). To test this, we analyzed the sequence and function of the Alu SINEs amplified from genomic DNA of five
apes, three OWMs and four NWMs. We determined that
the VDRE is conserved in all three groups of primates and
lacking in prosimians. Also, we discovered that NWMs
may have maintained additional, functional steroid-hormone receptor binding sites in the AluSx SINE that could
confer retinoic acid (RA) and thyroid hormone (TH)
responsiveness; however, these sites were less highly conserved during human, ape and OWM evolution.
Comparisons of genomes ranging from ancient fish to
modern humans have provided circumstantial evidence
that the exaptation [20] or co-option of TEs to serve
important cellular functions has been a powerful force in
evolution [21,22]; however, proven examples are rare.
Our study provides strong evidence that exaptation of an
AluSx SINE provides a novel, biologically important
innate immune response via the vitamin D-pathway that
is evolutionarily conserved in humans and non-human
primates, but absent in other mammals.

Results
Alu sequences are present in the CAMP promoters of Old
and New World Monkeys
PCR products were amplified from each primate DNA
except Lemur catta (Fig. 1A). The PCR products were
approximately the same size for each sample except for
Macaca mulatta, Saguinus labiatus, and Callithrix jacchus.
For each of these primate samples the PCR product was
approximately 300 bp larger. Sequencing of the shorter
products showed that they were SINEs of the AluSx subfamily (Figures 1B and 1C). In the other three primate
samples the AluSx SINE was present, but additional, independent insertional events occurred at the locus with
SINEs present in the 5'- or 3'-termini of the shared AluSx
SINE (Figure 1B). In M. mulatta, the Alu belonged to the Y
subfamily and for the other two primates the Alu
belonged to the S subfamily (Sc, C. jacchus and Sq, S. labiatus). The Alu element has a bipartite structure with the 5'half containing the RNA polymerase-III promoter (A and
B boxes) and the 3'-terminus possessing a run of A-nucleotides [7]. The AluSx is inserted 3'-to-5' with respect to the

ment and VDRE found in the other primates was absent in
the O. garnetti (Figure 1C). This indicates that prosimians
lack an Alu with a VDRE in their CAMP promoters.

The VDRE is located in the 3'-half of the Alu-element.
Alignment with the AluSx consensus sequence indicates
the VDRE was formed by the duplication of the sequence
5'-CGGGTTCAA-3' (Fig. 1C). This resulted in the positioning of two direct repeats of 5'-GGTTCA-3' separated by a
3-nucleotide spacer and is an ideal VDRE [23].

Functional conservation of VDRE activity
The VDRE sequence was perfectly conserved in all primates with only Cercopithecus aethiops containing a G to A
change in the first nucleotide position of the first direct
repeat (Figures 1C and 2A). This change would not be
expected to affect binding of the VDR to this site. Indeed,
the Alu SINEs from Homo sapiens, M. mulatta, C. aethiops
responded similarly to vitamin D treatment with
increased luciferase activity as compared with the empty
vector indicating that the base pair difference or insertion
of an additional SINE did not affect binding of the VDR to
the VDRE (Figure 2B).

A search of the trace archive data base at NCBI using the
human CAMP coding region, identified overlapping
sequences that included the 5'-promoter region of the
Otolemur garnetti (a prosimian) CAMP gene (data not
shown). Sequence alignments showed that the Alu-ele-

Structural and functional conservation of the VDREs in primate promoters
Structural and functional conservation of the VDREs in primate promoters. A) The nucleotide sequence of each
primate VDRE is aligned to demonstrate the high degree of conservation of the direct repeats (upper case) and 3-bp spacer
(lower case). C. aethiops contained a G-to-A change in the second direct repeat otherwise all the direct repeats were identical.
B) To determine if primate VDREs were activated by 1,25(OH)2D3, the amplified Alus for H. sapiens, M. mulatta and C. aethiops
were subcloned into the pGL4 luciferase reporter vector. The constructs were co-transfected into U937 cells with phTKRL
(Promega) to control for efficiency. The change in expression is represented as fold-change comparing vehicle treated to
1,25(OH)2D3 treated cells. C) Mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of two individual M. mullata and
treated with either vehicle or 100 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h. The expression level of CAMP mRNA was determined by QRTPCR and normalized to 18S levels. The data are represented as ng of CAMP per ng of 18S.

Induction of the CAMP gene by 1,25(OH)2D3 in R.
mulatta mononuclear cells
To determine if the endogenous CAMP gene could be
induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in cells from a non-human primate, we isolated mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the
peripheral blood of two individual M. mulatta and treated
these cells with either vehicle (ethanol) or 100 nM

1,25(OH)2D3 for 48 h. Analysis by QRT-PCR showed that
the CAMP gene was induced 6.8- and 12.2-fold. These
results demonstrate that it is possible to induce the endogenous CAMP gene in non-human primates with
1,25(OH)2D3 (Figure 2C). Also, we detected the protein,
CAP18, encoded by the CAMP gene in the plasma of the
two M. mulatta (189 and 253 ng/ml) indicating that the

protein is secreted into the blood as reported for humans
[24].
Other potential steroid hormone receptor response
elements in the Alu-element are not functional
The ability of Alu-elements to confer estrogen, retinoid
and thyroid hormone responsiveness to genes has been
described [25-27]. The response elements conferring
binding of these receptors are located between the A- and
B-boxes of the 5'-half of the Alu-element (Figure 3). In
AluSx SINEs, four 6-bp direct repeats are arranged such
that the first two repeats form a potential retinoic acid
receptor (RAR) binding site (DR2) and the second and
third repeats form a potential thyroid hormone receptor
(TR) binding site (DR4). The third and fourth repeats
form a second RAR binding site (Figure 3).

An AluSx SINE resides within the first 500 bp of the
human MPO gene promoter [26]. The first DR2 was unable to bind RAR, but the second potential DR2 bound
RAR and was responsive to retinoic acid [26]. Also, the
DR4 was responsive to thyroid hormone [26]. Alignment
of our primate sequences against the AluSx consensus
sequence revealed that two nucleotide positions in the
third direct repeat were changed from G-to-A and C-to-A
for all hominids and Old World monkeys, but were
unchanged in all the New World monkeys (Figure 3).

These changes potentially could impair binding of either
the RAR or TR and prevent activation of the CAMP gene by
retinoic acid or thyroid hormone. These changes were not
present in the third direct repeat of the MPO AluSx which
is responsive to both steroid hormones [26].
To test the effect of these changes on CAMP gene expression, we treated the human myeloid cell line NB4 with
vehicle, 1,25(OH)2D3, all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and
thyroid hormone (T3). As expected 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly
induced CAMP expression, but neither ATRA nor T3
induced CAMP (Figure 4). To determine that the ligands
and their respective receptors were functioning in these
cells, we tested ITGAM (CDllb) and MPO expression as
positive controls. As expected, ITGAM levels increased and
MPO levels decreased with ATRA treatment [26,28,29]
and MPO levels increased with T3 treatment [26] (Figure
4). These results suggest that the human, ape and OWM
CAMP promoter Alu-elements have lost the ability to
respond to these steroid hormones.
NWM CAMP gene responds to retinoic acid
NWMs are resistant to vitamin D, sex steroids and glucocortocoids [30,31]. They are characterized by high circulating levels of these hormones. Interestingly, NWMs do
not appear to have resistance to RA or T3 [32].

Potential retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor binding sites conserved in AluSx of NWMs. The nucleotide
sequence (1–89) of the AluSx of each primate was aligned with the consensus AluSx sequence. The location of four direct
repeats is indicated within each box with the consensus sequence indicated below each. The potential retinoic acid receptor
binding sites (DR2) and the thyroid hormone binding site (DR4) are indicated above the boxes. The locations of the A- and Bboxes of the Alu are indicated below the sequences. The G-to-A and C-to-A change in positions three and five in the third
direct repeat occurs in the human, all apes and OWMs, but not NWMs. These changes would likely abrogate binding of TR and
RAR to the DR4 and the second DR2, respectively. All NWMs acquired a G-to-A change in the sixth position of the fourth
direct repeat thus creating a potentially better DR2 for retinoic acid receptor binding. The third direct repeat in NWMs was
unchanged from the consensus Alu sequence and would provide an ideal direct repeat providing a potentially functional DR4
and DR2.

The human CAMP gene does not respond to retinoic acid or thyroid hormone treatment
The human CAMP gene does not respond to retinoic acid or thyroid hormone treatment. The human myeloid
cell line NB4 was treated with either vehicle (UNT), 1,25(OH)2D3 (D3), retinoic acid (RA), methoprene acid (MA) or thyroid
hormone (T3). Expression of either A) CAMP, B) MPO or C) CDllb was determined by QRT-PCR and normalized to 18S
rRNA.

The third direct repeat in the NWM Alu-elements is identical to that in the consensus AluSx sequence (Figure 3).
Furthermore, the fourth direct repeat acquired a G to A
change in the sixth nucleotide of the direct repeat (Figure
3) and would be predicted to make the second DR2 a better binding site for RAR as it is identical to the site in the
MPO gene that responds to RA [26]. Furthermore, the
changes would make the DR4 a better binding site for the
TR and is identical to the MPO DR4 that responds to TR
[26].
We hypothesized that these cis-elements in NWMs may
confer responses to either ATRA or T3. To test this, we
treated B95-8 cells, a lymphoblastoid B-cell line derived
from the vitamin D-resistant NWM C. jacchus, with either
1,25(OH)2D3, ATRA or T3. As expected, the CAMP gene
did not respond to vitamin D, but we observed a reproducible, dose-dependent reduction in CAMP gene expres-

sion with ATRA, but no changes in expression with T3
(Figure 5). These data indicate that the NWM gene has
retained the ability to respond to ATRA while the OWM,
apes and humans have not. The lack of response to T3 suggests that the NWM CAMP gene may not respond to this
hormone or that other cell types or tissues need to be
examined.

Discussion
Early in primate evolution (about 60 million years ago),
the major groups of Hominidae (humans and other apes),
OWMs, NWMs and prosimians (lemurs and lorises)
evolved independently and the origin and amplification
of Alu elements was concomitant with this primate radiation [7]. Examples of Alu elements implicated in gene regulation have been identified [9-11,21,22,26,33-36].
Identification of convincing examples of evolutionarilyfixed, novel regulatory patterns requires evidence of: 1) a

known transposable element (TE) sequence in the region
of the gene; 2) the TE sequence affecting regulation of the
nearby gene; 3) the gene having some function and 4) the
TE having been present long enough to be fixed [10,34].
For some of the above examples, it was demonstrated that
the Alu elements are conserved in humans, apes and/or
OWMs, but was not examined in NWMs; therefore, the
last requirement was only partially addressed [37].
Previously, we and others established the first three criteria for the CAMP gene [12,13]. Here we provide convincing evidence for the last requirement. We demonstrate
that the TE (AluSx SINE) acquired a VDRE through a
duplication event and has undergone approximately 60
million years of purifying selection during the primate
radiation to become fixed in the genomes of present-day
humans, apes, OWMs and NWMs (Figure 1). The distribution of this Alu in the different lineages is consistent with
current primate phylogeny and the ancient age of this
class of Alu [7]. Furthermore, we have shown that, as with
humans, the non-human, primate VDREs are functional
both in vitro and in vivo (Figure 2). Regulation of the
CAMP gene by vitamin D as conferred by the AluSx in its
promoter meets each of the above criteria. This study
demonstrates that exaptation of vitamin D-mediated gene
regulation by an AluSx SINE provided a novel, biologically-important innate immune response that is con-

served in humans and non-human primates, but not
other mammalian species. It is a convincing example of
an evolutionarily-fixed, Alu-mediated divergence in steroid hormone nuclear receptor gene regulation between
humans/primates and other mammals.
During the course of evolution, each group of primates
has acquired differences in the ability to respond to steroid hormones [38]. Surprisingly, NWM have circulating
1,25(OH)2D3 levels that are up to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in OWM, apes and
humans [30,38]. The NWMs are naturally resistant to
1,25(OH)2D3 due to the over expression of VDRE-binding
proteins (VDRE-BP) that requires NWMs to maintain high
levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 to displace it from binding sites
[39,40]. Also, NWM are resistant to estrogen, testosterone
and glucocortocoids [31,38], but remain sensitive to retinoic acid and thyroid hormone [32]. Although these differences in vitamin D physiology exist, we have
demonstrated that the VDRE is conserved in all three
groups of primates. Subclasses of AluS sequences provide
a significant source of potential hormone response elements for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors
[36,41]. Interestingly, in NWMs these elements are well
conserved in the CAMP promoter Alu and have acquired
additional changes that make them potentially better
binding sites for RAR and TR (Figures 3 and 5). On the

other hand, these sites were altered during hominid, ape
and OWM evolution and did not respond to RA or TH
(Figures 3 and 4). Retaining responses to both vitamin D
and these other steroid hormones may be necessary for a
proper innate immune response in vitamin D-resistant,
but RA- and TH-sensitive NWMs. The importance of these
binding sites to the expression of the CAMP gene remains
to be fully elucidated.
The importance of vitamin D and the active metabolite
1,25(OH)2D3 in immune function became apparent with
the discovery of VDR expression in activated inflammatory cells [42,43]. Also, it was demonstrated that
1,25(OH)2D3 was produced by activated macrophages
[44,45] and 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited T-cell activation and
proliferation [46-49]. Subsequently, it was shown that
vitamin D has an inhibitory action on the adaptive
immune system with a shift from Th1 to Th2 and T regulatory cells and inhibition of Th17 development [50-54].
Suppression of the adaptive system and the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D are probably beneficial for
conditions that involve autoimmunity [55]; however, it
could prove detrimental for some infections [56,57].

age, whereas a feeble immune response enables bacteria
to persist and cause pathogen-induced diseases. We propose a possible model that explains how the vitamin D3
pathway may combat infection while minimizing damage
to the host by its immune system. 1) TLR-activation by a
pathogen activates production of 1,25(OH)2D3 and
induction of VDR expression in monocytes [17]. 2) VDRsignaling increases production of hCAP18/LL-37 protein
(encoded by the CAMP gene) to kill the pathogen [17,66];
3) this subsequently downregulates TLR in the monocytes
[67] and 4) nuclear translocation of NF-κB/RelA is
blocked, thus muting the response to LPS and the production of inflammatory cytokines [67-71]. Finally, hCAP18/
LL-37 secreted by monocytes [12], binds circulating LPS
and dampens the signal to innate immune cells as well as
directly acting on the TLR-to-NF-kappaB pathway in
monocytes/macrophages [72]. Evolutionary selection to
place the CAMP gene under regulation of the vitamin D
pathway may enable suppression of inflammation while
potentiating innate immunity, thus maximizing the overall immune response to a pathogen and minimizing damage to the host.

Methods
The human CAMP gene is not induced consistently by
pro-inflammatory stimuli [12,16,58-61]. Additionally,
infection of macrophages with Mtb and other cell types
with pathogens leads to the repression of the CAMP gene
[18,62,63]. Acquisition of the VDRE by ancestral primates
that likely possessed high levels of vitamin D like today's
non-human primates [64] would have provided a pathway for induction of the CAMP gene in cells such as macrophages or epithelial barrier cells that are capable of
activating the vitamin D pathway in response to infection
or wounding [17,19]. The activation of the vitamin D
pathway provides a way for human macrophages to prevent the suppression of the CAMP gene when activated
with TLR2 or TLR4 ligands [65]. Thus, induction of the
CAMP gene by 1,25(OH)2D3 provides a possible mechanism for primates to counteract pathogen-mediated suppression and modulate the immune response.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the VDRE in the CAMP gene
originated from the exaptation of an AluSx SINE in the
lineage leading to humans, apes, OWMs and NWMs. It
has remained under purifying selection for the last 55–60
million years. It is a convincing example of an evolutionarily fixed, Alu-mediated divergence in steroid hormone
nuclear receptor gene regulation between humans/primates and other mammals.
The host immune response to serious infections is a delicate balancing act as bacterial clearance by an exuberant
immune system often leads to self-induced immune dam-

Human and non-human primate genomic DNA samples
The human genomic DNA was provided by Dr. Carl Miller
(Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). The M.
mulatta, C. jacchus and A. trivirgatus genomic DNAs were
provided by Dr. John Adams (University of California Los
Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). The genomic DNA for C. aethiops was isolated from the COS-1 cell line. The remaining
non-human primate genomic DNAs were purchased
(Corriel Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ).
PCR amplification, sequencing and cloning
The Alu sequences in the primate CAMP promoters were
amplified using the following primers: Forward, 5'gggcaacttgtcccttgcaaga-3' and Reverse, 5'-gggtgctcaagagcgttaaatccc-3'. The primers were located outside the Alu SINE
in regions that showed the highest homology among
human, chimp, mouse, rat and canine sequences. The
primer sequences were identical to the human and chimp
promoters.

PCR was performed with 100 ng of genomic DNA in 50 μl
reactions with HotMaster Taq polymerase (Eppendorf AG,
Hamburg, Germany). The primers were used at a final
concentration of 300 nM. The annealing temperature was
50°C and 35 cycles of PCR were performed. The PCR
products were purified from the reaction using a DNA
Clean and Concentrator-5 spin column (Zymo Research,
Orange, CA). The PCR products were sequenced using the
PCR primers described above and the Big DyeTM Terminator v.3 cycle sequencing as instructed by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The

sequences were analyzed and aligned using the Bioedit
Sequence Alignment Editor software (Tom Hall, Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA). The PCR products for the human,
M. mulatta and C. aethiops Alu-elements were cloned into
the pCR-2.1 Topo-TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
These fragments were subcloned into pGL4.20 [Luc2/
Puro] (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI).

Cell Culture
The U937, HL-60, NB4 and B95-8 cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
Cells were treated with either 1,25(OH)2D3 (1 or 100
nM), 500 nM all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or thyroid hormone (T3, 10 or 100 nM) for 24 h. Whole blood from M.
mulatta (two different animals) was obtained from the
California National Primate Research Center (University
of California, Davis, CA). The mononuclear cells (MNC)
were isolated on a Ficoll gradient after lysis of the red
blood cells. The MNC were cultured in RPMI 1640 with
10% FBS and antibiotics in the presence of either vehicle
(95% ethanol) or 1,25(OH)2D3 (100 nM) for 48 h.

Reporter Assays, RNA isolation and QRT-PCR
U937 cells were co-transfected with empty vector
(pGL4.20) or vector containing the Alu SINE (1 μg) and
phTKRL (0.1 μg) using Effectene reagent as described by
the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Cells were
lysed and dual-luciferase assays performed as instructed
by the manufacturer (Promgea Corporation).

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent according to
the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The synthesis of the cDNA
and QRT-PCR for the human CAMP gene and 18S rRNA
were performed as described previously [12]. The expression of ITGAM (CDllb) and MPO were analyzed by QRTPCR using SYBR-green as described previously [12,73].
