<p>Mining gondii regulatory elements
Toxoplasmaof genomic sequence data of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii identifies putative cis-regulatory elements using a

Abstract
Background: Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, which consists entirely
of parasitic organisms that cause several diseases of veterinary and human importance.
Fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation in this group of protistan parasites remain largely
uncharacterized. Owing to their medical and veterinary importance, genome sequences are
available for several apicomplexan parasites. Their genome sequences reveal an apparent paucity
of known transcription factors and the absence of canonical cis-regulatory elements. We have
approached the question of gene regulation from a sequence perspective by mining the genomic
sequence data to identify putative cis-regulatory elements using a de novo approach.
Results: We have identified putative cis-regulatory elements present upstream of functionally
related groups of genes and subsequently characterized the function of some of these conserved
elements using reporter assays in the parasite. We show a sequence-specific role in geneexpression for seven out of eight identified elements.
Conclusions: This work demonstrates the power of pure sequence analysis in the absence of
expression data or a priori knowledge of regulatory elements in eukaryotic organisms with compact
genomes.

Background

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite
belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. The T. gondii genome
is approximately 63 Mb, contains approximately 7,800 protein-encoding genes and has a GC content of 52%. Despite its
reduced genome, the parasite exhibits a complex developmental life cycle wherein it is capable of switching between a
rapidly dividing tachyzoite form and a quiescent bradyzoite
form within the asexual stage of its life cycle [1]. During its
asexual stage, it exhibits a wide host range, capable of infect-

ing a variety of warm-blooded animals. Infection is of greater
concern in AIDS or immunosuppressed patients, where it can
lead to neurological, mental and ocular defects. It is also
responsible for human birth defects and spontaneous abortion as a result of trans-placental transmission in infected
pregnant women [2,3]. Given its wide host-range and medical
importance, understanding fundamental processes of gene
regulation is important for developing methods aimed at controlling infection and disease.

There are many levels at which organisms can control gene
expression, including chromatin-mediated modifications,
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and posttranslational regulation [4,5]. Transcription factors that
mediate transcriptional regulation can be sequence-specific
DNA-binding proteins that are involved in gene-specific regulation, or more general RNA polymerase II components that
are required for transcription initiation. Promoter organization in unicellular eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of a bi-partite structure consisting of a core
promoter located close to the start of transcription and
upstream activator sequences that contain binding sites for
sequence-specific transcription factors present a few hundred
base pairs away. In metazoans, additional, more distal elements, such as enhancers and insulator elements, provide for
more specific fine-tuning of gene-regulation [6]. Very little is
known about how T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites
regulate their genes. A relatively small number of gene-specific studies in T. gondii have identified non-canonical cisregulatory elements indicative of a bi-partite promoter organization that were found to play a role in downstream gene
expression [7,8]. Preliminary surveys of the complete genome
sequence have revealed a paucity of known specialized transcriptional factors encoded in the genome [9]. Recent studies
have focused on dissecting the developmental signals responsible for inter-conversion between the tachyzoite and
bradyzoite developmental stages and the preferential gene
expression that characterizes these stages. To this end, the
study of stage-specific genes and their promoters [10-12] has
revealed the presence of cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region that are responsible for preferential gene
expression in different life cycle stages. Large-scale analyses
of gene expression from key developmental life cycle stages
[13] point to the absence of chromosomal clustering of coexpressed genes, and the presence of unique stage-specific
mRNAs in each developmental stage. However, promoter
organization and the presence of specialized transcription
factors for their recognition remain largely unexplored areas.
The medical importance combined with the evolutionary
divergence of the apicomplexan parasites relative to model
organisms has motivated a rapidly growing collection of
genome sequencing efforts for this group.
Sequence information provides us with a starting point to
identify cis-acting signals in the genome and to uncover
underlying gene-regulatory mechanisms. Sequence analysis
to identify conserved cis-regulatory signals is typically augmented by at least one of two types of information: the organization of regulons and known sequences of conserved
transcription factor binding sites, or large-scale gene expression information (for example, from microarray studies), that
provide data sets of co-regulated genes within which conserved transcription factor binding sites can be identified
[14]. Known canonical eukaryotic cis-elements have not yet
been reported in T. gondii. In the absence of this starting
information, we have adopted a de novo approach to identify

conserved sequence elements that could serve as putative cisregulatory elements. We have then experimentally verified
the role for these candidate elements in the parasite, establishing their role in gene expression. Our study includes four
different groups of genes that share parasite-specific or metabolic functions. We describe a computational framework for
the identification of novel cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic non-model systems, particularly those with reduced
genomes and relatively small intergenic regions.

Results and discussion

We analyzed four different functional groups of genes for the
presence of conserved, over-represented upstream sequence
motifs within each group. The choice of seed genes was based
on the hypothesis that genes that share a common function or
operate in the same biochemical pathway should be co-regulated and possess common upstream regulatory elements. We
used MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) [15], a de
novo pattern-finding algorithm to detect such motifs within
each group of genes. We tested the functional significance of
top candidate motifs by mutagenizing them in their native
promoter context and measuring subsequent reporter gene
expression (see Materials and methods). We find that different groups of genes share different over-represented motifs
and no global motif emerges from our studies to be shared by
all groups. The results of pattern finding and accompanying
experimental evidence establish the biological role of the
motifs considered in this study.

Genes involved in glycolysis
T. gondii, like Eimeria tenella and Cryptosporidium parvum, uses glucose as its main source of energy in its rapidly
dividing tachyzoite stage [16]. Phylogenetic analyses have
shown that two of the glycolytic genes in T. gondii, enolase
and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, are closely related to
their corresponding homologs in plants, suggesting that they
were acquired and potentially suitable as drug targets due to
their distinct evolutionary origin [17]. Glycolysis has also
been actively studied with respect to stage differentiation in
T. gondii. Three key glycolytic enzymes - glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [ToxoDB:76.m00001], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and enolase (ENO) [ToxoDB:59.m03410] exhibit developmentally regulated expression [18]. Stagespecific cDNAs have been isolated that encode distinct isoforms of LDH: LDH1 (tachyzoite) and LDH2 (bradyzoite)
[19]. Experimental evidence based on the detection of their
respective mRNA and protein products indicates that LDH1 is
post-translationally repressed while LDH2 is transcriptionally induced in bradyzoites [19]. Similarly, stage-specific
cDNAs have also been isolated for distinct forms of ENO:
ENO1 (bradyzoite) and ENO2 (tachyzoite) [20]. Stage-specific expression of the two enolases is brought about by the
presence of specific cis-regulatory elements in the promoter
regions of these genes [10]. The regulation of the genes

involved in glycolysis presents an intriguing case study from
developmental, evolutionary and regulatory perspectives.
We analyzed the upstream sequences of 11 genes involved in
tachyzoite glycolysis to identify conserved, over-represented
sequence motifs (Table 1). We report the analysis of two candidate motifs here: motif GLYCA, also found upstream of six
orthologs in E. tenella, and motif GLYCB, found exclusively in
T. gondii. These motifs were not reported in the aforementioned studies on stage-specific regulation of the enolase gene
[18]. Motif GLYCA, represented by the consensus 5'GCTKCMTY (Figure 1a) is an 8 bp well-conserved sequence occurring at least once per sequence on the forward strand (Figure
1b). It does not show significant positional conservation, but
motifs found upstream of orthologs in E. tenella are found to
be 100% conserved in sequence to their counterpart in T. gondii. Motif GLYCA is not found in the upstream regions of the
bradyzoite isoforms of the stage-specific glycolytic genes
(ENO2 and LDH1). Motif GLYCB is also an 8 bp motif represented by the consensus sequence 5'TGCASTNT (Figure 1a),
with 6 of 8 bases conserved in more than 90% of the occurrences. This motif is present once per sequence and can occur
on either strand (Figure 1b). Motif GLYCB was also found in
the upstream regions of the bradyzoite-specific copies of enolase and LDH (data not shown).
Mutagenesis of GLYCA to the sequence 5'AACAAACA in the
ENO2 promoter resulted in a small increase in promoter
activity. Mutagenesis of GLYCB to the sequence 5'CAACACAC
within the ENO2 promoter resulted in a small decrease in
promoter activity (Figure 1c, d). However, when both motifs
were mutagenized, a larger decrease in promoter activity was
seen. These results are complex in comparison to patterns
seen with motifs for other groups of genes (see below). It must
be noted that the changes in expression levels caused by
mutagenizing each individual sequence in the ENO2 promoter are of small magnitude, but statistically significant. It
is possible that the effects of mutagenizing each motif are not
very severe in their effect, while the double mutant shows a
large decrease in reporter expression, indicating a definite
role for both of these motifs, in concert, to affect downstream
gene expression. An alternative scenario to explain this result
is one in which mutagenesis of GLYCA gives rise to a chimeric
motif that enhances downstream gene-expression only in the
presence of wild-type (WT) GLYCB. The strong evolutionary
conservation of motif GLYCA in E. tenella and the significant
decrease in reporter activity in the double mutant lend support to their role in regulating gene expression. Further
experiments are needed to fully resolve these intriguing
results.

Genes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and salvage
Purines and pyrimidines are the building blocks of nucleic
acids in living cells. All protozoan parasites examined thus far
are unable to synthesize purines de novo and depend upon
salvage enzymes to obtain purines from the host [21]. Most

Mullapudi et al. R34.3

protists, however, possess a full set of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis enzymes, with one exception, C. parvum, which has
lost the de novo pathway and evolved to also salvage pyrimidines from the host cell [22]. Enzymes involved in nucleotide
metabolism in protozoan parasites can serve as promising
drug targets because they are essential to the parasite's survival and are also evolutionarily distinct from host enzymes in
some cases [22]. In T. gondii, it was found that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is essential for the virulence of the parasite [23]. We examined eight genes encoding enzymes
involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and salvage in T. gondii
and selected two conserved motifs found in their upstream
regions as candidates for experimental validation. Motif
NTBA is an A-rich 9 bp motif represented by the consensus
5'GCAAAMGRA (Figure 2a). It is very well conserved in four
orthologs in E. tenella. Motif NTBA is present only once
upstream of each gene and is always found on the positive
strand. It is primarily located at 1,000-1,500 bp upstream of
the translation start (Figure 2b). Motif NTBB is an 8 bp long
T-rich motif and is exclusive to T. gondii. It is represented by
the consensus sequence 5'TTTYTCGC (Figure 2a) and is also
found only once upstream of each gene on the forward strand.
The two motifs are typically present within 300-400 bp of
each other (Figure 2b).
To establish the biological significance of these motifs, we
mutagenized NTBA to the sequence 5'AAGCGCAAG and
NTBB to the sequence 5'GTGTGTG (Figure 2c). Mutagenesis
of either of these motifs individually in the promoter of the
gene encoding uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT)
[ToxoDB:583.m00018] showed no significant change in promoter activity. Mutagenesis of both motifs within the UPRT
promoter resulted in a seven-fold increase in reporter geneexpression, indicating that the two motifs function in repressing gene-expression and possibly possess redundancy in
function (Figure 2d).

Genes encoding micronemal proteins
Micronemes are secretory organelles found in apicomplexan
parasites and serve as compartments for the storage and trafficking of micronemal proteins, a family of proteins that function as ligand for host-cell receptors [24]. These proteins play
a very important role in the active process of host-cell adhesion and invasion during the parasite life cycle. We analyzed
the upstream sequences of 12 microneme protein-encoding
genes in T. gondii and corresponding upstream sequences of
four orthologs in E. tenella. We identified two well-conserved
sequence motifs in this data set that we subsequently selected
for further experimental characterization. Motif MICA is an 8
bp motif represented by the consensus sequence
5'GCGTCDCW (Figure 3a). It is found at least twice in the
majority of the upstream regions occurring on either strand
and does not show conservation of position relative to the
translational start site (Figure 3b). This motif was also found
upstream of E. tenella micronemal protein genes. In the
reverse orientation, this motif closely resembles the 5'WGA-

GACG motif that has been identified in previous studies to
function as a regulatory element in several promoters of T.
gondii [8]. Motif MICB is an 8 bp motif with the very well conserved sequence 5'SMTGCAGY (Figure 3a); the core 'TGCA'
nucleotides are conserved in 100% of occurrences. This motif
occurs once upstream in all 11 micronemal protein genes in T.
gondii, but was not found in the corresponding orthologs in
E. tenella. It does not show conservation of position relative
to the translational start site, and is always found on the forward strand (Figure 3b).
To characterize the functional significance of these conserved
motifs, each was mutagenized to an 8 bp polyA sequence
(5'AAAAAAAA; Figure 3c). The mutagenesis of motif MICA in
the Mic8 (Micronemal protein 8) [ToxoDB: 50.m00002] promoter led to a tenfold reduction in reporter activity, and the

mutagenesis of motif MICB led to a threefold reduction in
reporter expression. When both MICA and MICB were mutagenized in the same promoter, it had a dramatic effect on promoter activity (the raw value of firefly expression levels (440
units) was comparable to that of non-transfected cells (386
units) (Figure 3d)). From these data, we infer that both MICA
and MICB act positively to enhance gene expression from the
Mic8 promoter, and together exert an additive effect on
downstream gene-expression, as is indicated by the loss of
expression when both MICA and MICB are mutagenized (Figure 3d).

level [25]. In a recent study [26] the authors examined a large
set of cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins in T. gondii (79 genes in
all) and describe the presence of two well-conserved motifs,
TRP-1 (motif RPA; 5'CGGCTTATATTCG) and TRP-2 (motif
RPB; 5'YGCATGCR) (Figure 4a) identified by MEME in all
promoters. The sequence of TRP-2 (RPB) is similar to the 8
bp element 5'TGCATGCA reported to be overrepresented in
the non-coding regions of the apicomplexans C. parvum, T.
gondii and E. tenella [27]. This sequence is also similar to one
of the binding sites of the AP2-domain containing transcription factors as inferred from protein-based microarray studies conducted in P. falciparum [28]. In a study of the
promoter strengths of eight of the ribosomal protein genes,
no correlation could be found between multiple occurrences
of one or both motifs and promoter strength in the eight promoters [29]. However, the biological function of these motifs

was not reported. We conducted analyses on a subset of these
genes (eight promoters) and also recovered the motifs TRP-1
(RPA) and TRP-2 (RPB) as described by van Poppel et al. [29]
(Figure 4b). We mutagenized these motifs in our analyses to
ascertain if they functioned in a sequence-specific manner to
affect promoter activity.
Motif TRP-1 (RPA) in the RPL9 (Ribosomal protein L9) promoter [ToxoDB:76.m00009] was mutagenized to the
sequence 5'CGAAGTATGCGAG (retaining the WT sequence
at 3 of the 13 nucleotide positions due to mutagenesis challenges presented by the length of this motif) and motif TRP-2
(RPB), which occurs twice in the RPL9 promoter, was mutagenized at both sites (singly and jointly) to the sequence
5'TAAATAAA (Figure 4c). TRP-1 (RPA) did not affect
reporter expression when mutagenized individually or in

combination with TRP-2 (RPB). This observation may be
attributed to the fact that not all of the bases in this motif were
mutagenized, indicating that the three WT positions might be
crucial and sufficient for the function of this motif or that this
motif may serve a function during a different stage of development or not serve a function related to gene expression.
These results warrant further examination. Mutagenesis of
one of the copies of motif RPB resulted in a 50% reduction in
promoter activity, while mutagenesis of both the copies of
RPB caused a 75% reduction in gene expression relative to the
WT promoter (Figure 4d). These data indicate that TRP-2
(RPB) enhances gene expression from the RPL9 promoter;

the presence of additional copies of this motif likely confers
additional strength to the promoter.

Genome-wide occurrences of candidate motifs
We examined the occurrences of each of the motifs to determine if there was over-representation within upstream
regions relative to coding regions. Table 2 lists the genomewide occurrences of each of the candidate motifs within the
upstream and the coding regions of the genome, respectively,
as computed by MAST (Motif Analysis and Search Tool) [15].

10 kbp (motif density). Of the eight candidate motifs selected
in this study, the RPB (TRP-2) motif (5'YGCATGCR) has the
highest occurrence within upstream regions, 4,030 occurrences upstream of 1,311 genes. When normalized to the total
size of each database (upstream or coding), the candidate
motifs (except GLYCA and MICB) were found to be significantly (two- to four-fold) over-represented (p < 0.001) in the
upstream regions relative to the coding regions (Table 2, Figure 5).
We calculated the expected frequency of motifs within the
upstream and coding regions based on the motif length,
degeneracy and the composition and size of the database
(Materials and methods). The expected occurrences of most
of the motifs are almost equal in both databases (upstream
and coding) because of the similarity in size and nucleotide
composition of the two databases. The motifs are not found to

occur at a significantly greater frequency than expected,
exceptions being NTBA, which is found at a higher frequency
than expected (p < 0.05) within the upstream and coding
regions, and motifs NTBB and RPA, which are found at frequencies higher than expected in the coding regions only
(Table 3 in Additional data file 1).
Thus, while most of the regulatory motifs are present at a
slightly higher frequency in the upstream regions when compared to the coding regions, they do not occur at a higher frequency than expected in either upstream or coding regions.
These analyses highlight the limitations of approaches that
use statistical overrepresentation of motifs as a reliable and
sufficient property to identify biologically relevant motifs. It
is possible that a functional regulatory motif may not be
detectable by sequence alone. The surrounding sequence con-

text and other still elusive signals may be involved in enabling
it to function as a regulatory motif.
To examine enrichment of specific Gene Ontology (GO) categories among all genes containing any of the eight candidate
upstream motifs, we retrieved first-level GO annotations for
all of the motif-containing genes (Table 2 in Additional data
file 1) for each of the three main GO categories: 'cellular component', 'molecular function' and 'biological process'. We also
included lower level GO annotation IDs for the specific pathways/functional groups included in this study (Materials and
methods). Table 4 in Additional data file 1 lists the GO categories that were significantly enriched within the motif-containing gene sets. Some of the motif-containing gene sets are also

enriched in GO terms related to the corresponding function/
pathway used to initially identify the motif, indicating that the
regulatory motif may indeed be a subset-specific or pathwayspecific motif. On the other hand, some motif-containing
gene sets do not show enrichment for a particular GO category, but rather to a more general, functional classification.
For example, genes containing the motifs discovered in the
analysis of ribosomal protein-coding genes (RPA and RPB)
are enriched in annotated higher-level GO categories such as
organelle and regulation of biological process. This indicates
that a large number of genes that contain the RPA (TRP-1)
and RPB (TRP-2) motifs can be assigned to ribosome or
translational-specific functions, indicating a broad subset
specificity for this motif. Genes that contain the MICA or

The number of occurrences of each motif and the genes containing them in the whole genome Motif density (number of motifs per 10 kb) was
computed using MAST to search position weight matrix profiles of each motif against custom built databases (upstream regions (11,685,162 bp) and
coding regions (16,862,741 bp)).

MICB motifs do not show any GO category enrichment, indicating a more general role for these upstream motifs. When
deeper-level GO annotations for particular processes (such as
'ribosome' [GO:0005840]) are enumerated among the motifcontaining genes, we find that the genome-wide lists of genes
that contain RPA and RPB motifs are also enriched in corresponding GO categories ('ribosome' and 'translation'), indicating an even stronger specific association of these motifs
with the corresponding processes (Table 3).

General discussion
Promoter organization in T. gondii has been studied in a few
genes thus far [7,8,10,11]. In these studies, it has been
observed that a gene-proximal region is necessary for minimal gene expression and additional upstream sequence helps
to enhance expression from the same promoter. However,
very little is known about the mechanism of gene regulation
and the prevalence and type of transcriptional signals and
regulatory apparatus in this organism. Analyses of genome
sequences and individual gene-specific experiments point out
two deviations from what has been observed in other model
eukaryotes. First, canonical eukaryotic promoter elements
such as the TATA box have not been found in T. gondii promoter regions [8], although a highly divergent TATA binding
protein has been reported [9]. Furthermore, there is a stark
paucity of known specialized transcription factors encoded in
the genome [9]. A similar scenario is seen in two other apicomplexan parasites, P. falciparum and C. parvum [30,31].
This paradox can be explained in two ways: these organisms
do not employ a specialized transcriptional apparatus to regulate their genes; or a specialized transcriptional machinery
exists but is so divergent from known eukaryotic counterparts
that its components cannot be detected by simple similaritybased searches. Recent studies have shown that the T. gondii
genome encodes a rich repertoire of histone-modifying
enzymes, and epigenetic regulation has been purported to be

responsible for stage-switching in the parasite [32,33]. More
recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-chip
experiments conducted on 1% of the T. gondii genome reveal
a strong association between specific histone modification
marks and active promoter regions [34]. It is likely that histone-mediated regulation is responsible for regulation of
genes to a sizeable extent in T. gondii. Serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE) studies of genes expressed during key lifecycle stages [13] have shown that the mRNA pool of T. gondii
is highly dynamic and gene expression is controlled in a timeand stage-dependent manner. These studies have also shown
that co-expressed genes in T. gondii do not cluster in the
genome with respect to chromosomal location. Searches of
the Plasmodium genome sequence for transcription factors
using secondary structure similarity have revealed the presence of putative transcription factors that were missed in simple sequence-based searches [35]. A divergent, putative,
specialized transcription factor ApiAP2 has also been
reported in the apicomplexa [36]. A large percentage of proteins in T. gondii are 'hypothetical proteins' with no known
function and might possibly encode parasite-specific functions, including transcriptional regulatory proteins. It is plausible that such highly divergent regulatory proteins utilize
very different cis-elements for their recruitment, which would
explain the absence of canonical cis-elements in the promoters studied thus far.
We have exploited the availability of genome sequence for T.
gondii to identify conserved upstream motifs in diverse
groups of functionally related genes. We identified over-represented motifs by de novo pattern finding and tested their
function in vitro, in the parasite, by specifically mutagenizing
them in their native promoter context and measuring
reporter activity. For each group, two candidate motifs were
selected and characterized for their function in their endogenous promoter. We find that seven out of eight motifs iden-

Significantly enriched GO categories (adjusted p-value < 0.05) for motif-containing genes. The results are listed by each motif and ordered based on
their Benjamini Hochberg adjusted p-value. A good correlation is observed between the functional pathways associated with the seed genes and the
GO category that is over-represented in the corresponding motif-containing genome-wide gene sets in the case of motifs NTBB, RPA and RPB.

tified by de novo pattern finding show a statistically
significant role in promoter activity. We have shown that conserved over-represented motifs play a definite role in geneexpression, and can affect promoter activity either positively
or negatively (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). It is exciting to note that
some of the motifs that affect gene expression also exhibit
cross-species conservation, as shown by their presence
upstream of orthologs in E. tenella (Table 1).
Our studies have shown that in spite of the lack of a priori
knowledge concerning the nature of regulatory sequences
and/or expression profiles, it is possible to identify putative
cis-regulatory elements. We have shown that elements identified purely on the basis of computational techniques can be

functionally relevant for gene expression. We previously
characterized putative cis-regulatory elements in the genome
of C. parvum in a similar fashion where we established a correlation between over-represented elements and co-ordinate
gene expression [37]. In a comparison of the genes common
to both studies (genes of the glycolytic and nucleotide metabolism pathways), we do not detect identical motifs in T. gondii and C. parvum. Given the evolutionary divergence and
difference in genome organization and content between these
two parasites, it is not unexpected that they do not share some
specialized components of the regulatory machinery, or these
components may have evolved so rapidly as to be unrecognizable as orthologs.

The use of asynchronous populations of parasites, as is the
case here, is expected to dilute out expression effects to some
extent, and this is reflected in the occasional small, but significant, change in promoter activity upon mutagenesis of a
motif (Figure 1d, motif GLYCA; p < 0.05). In spite of these
limitations, our study has successfully identified six novel cisregulatory elements and established the functional significance of one previously reported conserved upstream element. The study of stage-specific gene regulation in T. gondii
has been an active area of investigation, and small-scale
microarray studies have reported genes that are preferentially expressed in either developmental stage [38,39].
Recently, three T. gondii studies have reported the presence
of novel cis-regulatory elements in promoters of genes regulated in a stage-specific manner [10-12]. However, gene regulation within the tachyzoite stage has not been well studied.
The lack of a synchronized population of tachyzoites (with
respect to their cell cycle) in in vitro culture makes it difficult
to address gene regulatory questions in the actively multiplying tachyzoite, as any given population of cells in culture consists of parasites at different points of their cell cycle.
Our study reports the presence of different cis-regulatory elements controlling gene-expression within the tachyzoite
stage of the parasite and is among the first to show evidence
for the presence of modular organization of promoters in T.
gondii. Using site-specific mutagenesis of conserved
upstream motifs and subsequent reporter assays, we have
shown that the identified cis-elements can exhibit co-operative, additive or redundant effects within a promoter and
operate in a sequence-specific manner to control gene expression (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4). The putative transcription factors or
repressors recruited by these elements in order to facilitate
gene regulation remain to be determined. One of the limitations of investigating gene expression within the tachyzoite
stage is the lack of a parasite population enhanced in the production of a specific transcription factor that could be
recruited by these cis-regulatory elements. Consequently, the
detection of such putative transcription factors or repressor
proteins from a mixed population of parasites by experiments
such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays has proven to be
challenging and yield inconsistent results (data not shown).

Conclusions

Cis-regulatory elements play a significant role in gene regulation in T. gondii and can operate individually and in concert
to influence gene expression. This study provides a glimpse of
the extent and mechanisms by which cis-regulatory elements
are involved in controlling gene expression within the tachyzoite life cycle of T. gondii. We have shown evidence for
upstream elements to behave as both positive and negative
regulators of gene expression as well as exhibit redundancy
within the same promoter in downstream gene expression.
One of the eight motifs examined in this study, the TRP-2
(RPB) motif, is similar in sequence to the binding site for

ApiAP2, a family of apicomplexan-specific DNA-binding proteins. De novo computational approaches possess great predictive power in compact genomes when sequence is
available. We have shown here the applicability of computational techniques to identify gene regulatory signals in a system where little is known about gene regulation.

Materials and methods
Computational analyses
Whole genome sequence (v.3.3) and gene-predictions for T.
gondii were obtained from ToxoDB (release 4.0) [40]. Scripts
were written in PERL to extract the upstream sequence (2 kb
or until the previous upstream gene is encountered, whichever sequence was smaller) for every predicted gene to create
an 'upstream sequence database'. This database was screened
for possible missed protein coding regions by performing a
BLASTX against all protein sequences in the non-redundant
database at NCBI. Sequences that contained greater than
80% similarity to coding sequences were pruned. Groups of
genes (hereafter referred to as seed genes) used to identify
common over-represented upstream motifs were selected
based on the hypothesis that genes belonging to the same biochemical or functional pathway should be co-regulated and,
hence, possess common upstream regulatory elements.
Members from each of the four groups considered in this
study (glycolysis, nucleotide metabolism, micronemal proteins and ribosomal proteins) were identified based on existing annotation from ToxoDB. Additionally, BLAST analyses
using sequence information of orthologs from P. falciparum
and C. parvum were employed to identify the corresponding
genes in T. gondii when necessary. Given the limited annotation at the time of this study, it is possible that the gene lists
under each functional group are not exhaustive. The patternfinding algorithm MEME [15] was used to identify over-represented conserved motifs in the upstream regions of genes
within each functional group. MEME was run using the
parameters minw = 8, maxw = 20, in all three modes (tcm,
oops and zoops) and the results were manually examined to
pick candidate motifs. Upstream sequences of corresponding
orthologs from E. tenella (a related coccidian parasite) were
also used whenever possible to identify evolutionarily conserved motifs. In order to narrow down the results of MEME,
a rule-based approach was adopted to pick candidate motifs
for subsequent experimental validation. Candidate motifs
included those that were over-represented in the upstream
regions in comparison to the background set (entire upstream
regions database), showed considerable conservation in
sequence and/or position, and were present in all the
sequences within each group.
The program MAST [15] was used to search the most recently
annotated version of the T. gondii genome (release 4.3) for
the presence of each candidate motif in all 7,817 genes in the
genome divided into coding regions (16,862,741 bp) and
upstream regions (11,685,162 bp). To normalize for the differ-

ent sizes of the coding regions database and the upstream
regions database, the motif density was computed by calculating the number of motifs per 10,000 bp. Chi square analysis was performed to examine whether there was a significant
difference in occurrence of each motif between upstream and
coding regions.
The expected frequency of motifs within each set (the
upstream regions database and the coding regions database)
was calculated as follows. The upstream regions database has
a base composition of 48% AT (A = 23%, T = 25%, G = 25%
and C = 26%) and the coding regions database has a base
composition of 42% AT (A = 22%, T = 20%, G = 30%, C =
28%). Given these statistics, the 8 bp motif GLYCA (GCTKCMTY) will be expected to occur once every 1,780 bases in the
upstream regions database and once every 2,406 bases in the
coding regions database (after accounting for positional
degeneracy). Taking the database sizes into account, the
expected motif density per 10,000 bases was calculated for
each motif in each database. Chi square analysis was used to
examine the statistical significance of the differences in the
observed and expected frequencies of motifs in the upstream
and coding regions.

Assessment of enrichment of GO categories within genes containing
a candidate motif
Of the 7,817 predicted genes in T. gondii, 2,437 genes have
been assigned the subcategory cellular component, 3,902
genes have been assigned the subcategory molecular function, and 4,738 genes have been assigned the subcategory biological process. First-level GO annotations from each of these
subcategories (totaling 44 subcategories) for all motif-containing genes were obtained from ToxoDB along with the
total number of genes in the genome corresponding to each
annotation. Hypergeometric probability distribution was
used to determine the chance probability of observing the
number of genes with a given GO annotation within each of
the eight sets of candidate upstream regulatory motif-containing genes compared to the number of genes with that GO
annotation in the whole genome. More specifically, the probability of observing at least x genes that contain an upstream
motif with a given annotation in a random subset of n genes
is given by [41]:

where A is the total number of genes with a particular GO

genome (7,817). In order to control error rates for multiple

jamini Hochberg method [42] and the Bonferroni method
[43] (Table 4 in Additional data file 1). In the case of the Benjamini Hochberg method, a false discovery rate criteria based
on the number of GO terms searched (number of tests = 44
GO terms searched × 8 motifs = 352) was implemented and a
false discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05 was considered
significant.
Additionally, specific, lower-level GO categories that describe
the functional groups chosen in this study (for example, glycolysis [GO:0006096], ATP-binding [GO:0005524], nucleoside metabolism [GO:00009116], calcium binding:
[GO:0005509], translation: [GO:0006412] and ribosome
structure: [GO:0003735]) were picked to similarly test for
their enrichment within the motif-containing gene sets. Significant enrichment of any of these within the corresponding
motif-containing gene sets was determined using hypergeometric probability.

Molecular techniques
For each group of functionally related genes considered in
this study, a promoter that contained a single occurrence of
the candidate motif was chosen to study the role of the motif
in driving gene expression. Promoter sequences were PCRamplified from parasite genomic DNA and a two-step overlap-extension PCR technique was employed to carry out sitedirected mutagenesis [44] to alter the candidate motif
sequence (see Table 1 in Additional data file 1 for primer
sequences). All or a majority of the bases in each motif were
substituted by base-specific transversions, thus destroying
the original sequence of the candidate motif but maintaining
the spacing within the promoter (Figures 1c, 2c, 3c and 4c).
Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing or by
restriction digest analysis. The Gateway™ cloning system was
used to clone the WT and mutagenized promoters individually upstream of a firefly luciferase-expressing vector (testfirefly). As an internal control, a constitutive promoter (T.
gondii α-tubulin promoter)-driven renilla luciferase-expressing construct (α-tub-renilla) was co-transfected along with
the experimental construct (Additional data file 2).

T. gondii RH tachyzoites were cultured in human foreskin
fibroblasts (hTERT cells, BJ Biomedicals) as previously
described [8]. Transient transfection was performed via electroporation, using freshly lysed parasites, needle-passaged
and filtered through a 3 micron filter and resuspended in
cytomix [8,45]. Immediately prior to use, freshly prepared 2
mM ATP and 5 mM glutathione were added to the cytomix
and sterile-filtered. For each co-transfection, 2 × 107 parasites
were transfected via electroporation with a mixture of sterile
circular plasmid DNA of α-tub-renilla (control) and test-firefly mixed in a ratio of 2.5:1. (40 μg test + 16 μg control). Electroporation was performed in a 2 mm gap cuvette using a BTX
electroporator: 1.8 kv, 100 Ω, 25 μF. Post-electroporation, the
parasites were allowed to rest for 15 minutes in the cuvette

and then transferred to T25 tissue culture flasks. Then, 18-24
hours post-electroporation, the cells were scraped and lysed
using passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and
a dual luciferase assay was performed with the extract using
the Promega Dual Luciferase kit. Briefly, the different substrate requirements for each enzyme, firefly luciferase and
renilla luciferase allowed us to assay reporter expression for
each construct sequentially within the same extract. Reporter
activity from the WT or mutagenized promoter was measured
relative to the internal control, eliminating errors due to variation in parasite populations and individual transfections.
Enzyme activity was measured using a dual luciferase-ready
luminometer. Each electroporation experiment was performed in triplicate and luciferase assays were performed in
duplicate for expression measurements. The unpaired Students t-test was used to calculate the statistically significant
difference in expression levels between WT and mutagenized
promoter activity; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
