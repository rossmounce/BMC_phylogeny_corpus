Abstract
Background: Parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae develop invasive root haustoria upon contact
with host roots or root factors. The development of haustoria can be visually monitored and is
rapid, highly synchronous, and strongly dependent on host factor exposure; therefore it provides
a tractable system for studying chemical communications between roots of different plants.
Description: Triphysaria is a facultative parasitic plant that initiates haustorium development within
minutes after contact with host plant roots, root exudates, or purified haustorium-inducing
phenolics. In order to identify genes associated with host root identification and early haustorium
development, we sequenced suppression subtractive libraries (SSH) enriched for transcripts
regulated in Triphysaria roots within five hours of exposure to Arabidopsis roots or the purified
haustorium-inducing factor 2,6 dimethoxybenzoquinone. The sequences of over nine thousand
ESTs from three SSH libraries and their subsequent assemblies are available at the Pscroph database
http://pscroph.ucdavis.edu. The web site also provides BLAST functions and allows keyword
searches of functional annotations.
Conclusion: Libraries prepared from Triphysaria roots treated with host roots or haustorium
inducing factors were enriched for transcripts predicted to function in stress responses, electron
transport or protein metabolism. In addition to parasitic plant investigations, the Pscroph database
provides a useful resource for investigations in rhizosphere interactions, chemical signaling
between organisms, and plant development and evolution.

Background
Parasitic plants directly invade and rob nutrients from
host plants [1,2]. The consequences can be devastating to
the host plant and some of the world's most pernicious
agricultural pests are parasitic weeds [3]. The number of
parasitic angiosperms is surprisingly large with over four

thousand parasitic species identified in nineteen different
plant families [4]. Parasitic plants have a wide diversity of
growth habits ranging from the tiny flowered mistletoes
that live in the tops of trees to the enormously flowered
and rootless Rafflesia whose entire vegetative body is
endophytic [4]. The degree to which parasites rely on host

resources also varies. Some obligate parasites, like Rafflesia, have lost photosynthetic capabilities and are fully
heterotrophic. Others, like Triphysaria, are facultative parasites that can mature without a host plant but will parasitize neighboring plants when available.
The single feature shared by all parasitic plants is the ability to invade host tissues via a haustorium [1]. Haustoria
of parasitic plants fulfill multiple functions including host
attachment, penetration, and translocation of resources

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/24

from host to parasite [5]. Interestingly, the competence to
develop haustoria has originated in autotrophic ancestors
multiple times during the evolution of angiosperms [6].
There are two general hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of haustoria. One hypothesis suggests that the genes
encoding haustorium development are derived from nonplant organisms, such as bacteria or fungi, that are endophytic or which have transferred a set of genes required for
haustorium formation into the parasite genome [7]. The
second is that genes encoding haustorium development

are derived from those present in autotrophic
angiosperms where they fulfill functions unrelated to
parasitism. The identification of genes associated with
haustorium development will provide insights into the
evolutionary origins of plant parasitism. These genes will
also elucidate the degree to which haustoria in different
parasitic families are encoded by convergent or homologous genetic pathways.
Parasitic plants in the Orobanchaceae develop haustoria
on their roots in response to contact with host roots. Several molecules, typically products of the phenylpropanoid
pathway, have been identified that induce haustorium
development when applied to Orobanchaceae roots in
vitro [5,8-10]. Early haustorium development in response
to exogenous signal molecules is characterized by three
visible phenotypes: temporary cessation in root elongation, isodiametric cortical swelling, and haustorial hair
proliferation [11,12].
Molecular phylogeny places the Orobanchaceae on a single phylogenetic clade of parasites distinct from the nearest non-parasitic relative [13]. This suggests that the
genetic mechanisms controlling haustorium development
in the Orobanchaceae are likely similar. Triphysaria, formerly Orthocarpus, is an Orobanchaceae that grows as a
common, springtime annual throughout the Pacific coast
from Canada to Baja [14]. Triphysaria is a small genus of
five intercrossing diploid species that are amenable to
classical genetic analyses [15]. Triphysaria is closely related
to the devastating agricultural weeds Striga and Orobanche;
however, Triphysaria itself has no agricultural significance.
Triphysaria are facultative parasites that can grow to maturity without host plants but will readily parasitize many
host species when available, including Arabidopsis and
maize. Triphysaria form haustoria within twelve hours of
being exposed to Arabidopsis roots or root factors in vitro
[16]. The speed, synchrony, and dependence on exogenous inducer makes haustorium development in Orobanchaceae an excellent system for identifying transcripts
associated with subterranean plant-plant communications.
Towards the goal of identifying genes associated with
plant parasitism, we sequenced cDNA libraries enriched

by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) [17] for
transcripts regulated in Triphysaria roots during haustorium development. To date we have sequenced approximately nine thousand ESTs from three SSH libraries
generated after treating Triphysaria roots with either intact
Arabidopsis roots or the chemical haustorium inducer 2,6dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ). DMBQ, first purified
as a haustorium inducer from sorghum [9], induces high
rates of haustorium development in Triphysaria; however
its role in mediating haustorium formation in Triphysaria
– Arabidopsis interactions is not known. The Pscroph database provides on-line access to these EST and assembly
sequences and provides BLAST and keyword search functions [18]. Comparative analysis with other transcriptomes will highlight genes and pathways associated with
the origins of haustorium development and the evolution
of heterotrophy in plants. These studies may provide
insights into genetic strategies for developing crops resistant to parasitic weeds and into strategies for exploiting
allelopathic interactions in agriculture generally.

Construction and content
Parasite treatments
Triphysaria versicolor seeds were collected from thousands
of cross-pollinating plants growing in a grassland stand
near Napa CA. They were surface sterilized in a solution of
2% sodium hypochlorite (50% household bleach) and
0.01% Triton X-1000, rinsed thoroughly with water and
germinated at 16°C in 0.25X Hoagland's solution and 1%
agar [19]. After two to three weeks the seedlings were
transferred along one edge of a square Petri dish containing the appropriate media and incubated at 25°C at a near
vertical angle so that the roots grew down along the surface of the agar. Arabidopsis Columbia seeds were obtained
from Lehle seeds (Round Rock, TX, USA), surface sterilized, and germinated in agar. Arabidopsis seedlings were
then cultivated hydroponically for 40 days in liquid
media (30 seedlings in 30 ml of 0.25X Hoagland's media
in 250 ml flasks shaking at 50 rpm at 25°C under a 16
hours light/8 hours dark cycle).

Haustorium development was induced five to seven days
after the transfer of Triphysaria seedlings to vertical square
plates by exposing their roots to Arabidopsis. This was done
by placing roots of forty day old hydroponically grown

sequences were mapped to the plant gene identified as the best hit in BLASTX searches as described in the text. The number of produces
predicted to contain non-coding sequences (3', 5', or both), or only coding sequences, are shown for each library.
2 Redundant ESTs within each library were identified from the BLASTX reports and removed from the analysis. ESTs lacking BLASTX hits with E
values ≤ 10-8 were also eliminated from this analysis.

Arabidopsis across the roots of Triphysaria seedlings as
shown in figure 1a. Two ml of 0.25X Hoagland's media
were applied to the roots to ensure good contact. Contact
was maintained for up to five hours during which time
Triphysaria roots were harvested for RNA. Haustoria were
also induced by applying two ml of 10 µM DMBQ directly
to Triphysaria roots for construction of the EDIT library.
Early haustorium development could be detected within
24 hr of host parasite contact as swollen, hairy knobs
emerging just proximal to the Triphysaria root tips (Figure
1b,c,d). Triphysaria exposed to media without Arabidopsis
or DMBQ did not develop haustoria.
Library construction
Triphysaria roots were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen at various time intervals ranging from immediately
after treatment to up to five hours later. Triphysaria RNA
was prepared as described [20]. Suppressive subtractive
hybridization was used to generate cDNA libraries
enriched for up or down regulated transcripts using a
commercial kit (BD Sciences, Clontech, Mountain View,
CA). The Host Forward (HF) library was enriched for transcripts upregulated in Triphysaria roots after contact with
Arabidopsis and was made using mock-treated Triphysaria
as the hybridization driver. The Host Reverse (HR) library
was enriched for transcripts down regulated after host
contact and was made using Arabidopsis exposed Triphysaria as driver. The EDIT library was enriched for transcripts upregulated in root tips within five hours of
exposure to DMBQ as previously described [20].
EST sequencing and assembly
Subtracted cDNAs were ligated into pCR2.1-Topo (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cloned in E. coli. Colonies were
picked into 384 well microtiter plates and frozen at 80°C. Sequencing templates were prepared from the
library using a rolling circle amplification technology with
TempliPhi kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Sequencing reactions were run using the BigDye terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA.) and the
products were separated and detected using the ABI3730xl
DNA Fragment Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,

Foster City, CA) at the UC Davis College of Agriculture
and Environmental Sciences Genomics Facility.
DNA trace files were base-called using Phred (version
0.990722.g) and low quality sequences were removed
based on a Phred p value ≤ 0.05 [21]. The sequences were
masked for the pCR 2.1-TOPO cloning vector, linker
sequences, and repetitive sequences (excluding poly A and
poly T) based on alignments generated by the BLASTN
program as used by the PyMood Sequence Processor
(Allometra, Davis, CA) (Alexander Kozik, pers. comm.).
Sequences less than 100 nts were discarded from further
analyses. Approximately five percent of the clones had
linker sequences internal to an ORF sequence. These were
determined to be chimeras generated by the ligation of
multiple SSH fragments into a single plasmid. The chimeric sequences were computationally digested into independent ESTs. The finished ESTs were submitted to
GenBank's dbEST repository [22].
FASTA files of the finished ESTs were assembled into contigs using the cap3 program. Because we assembled
trimmed and masked FASTA sequences, quality files were
not included and the cap3 clipping function was unnecessary. The assembly was performed at the default parameters (overlap length cutoff = 30; overlap percent identify
cutoff = 75; and overlap similarity score cutoff = 500)
[23]. Fifty percent of the assemblies were comprised of a
single EST; an additional forty percent were comprised of
two, three, or four ESTs. The assembly process identified
about 1100 transcript assemblies in the HF library, 1300
in the HR library and 1400 in the EDIT library (Table 1).
Database of early haustorial transcripts
The EST sequences and assembly alignments are available
at the Pscroph database [18]. Data are stored in a MySQL
database and made available on the web using a phpMyAdmin interface. The database is housed at the University
of California-Davis Genome Center.

Proteins predicted to be encoded by the assemblies were
annotated from the BLASTX reports comparing Triphysaria
sequences to either all proteins in GenBank (rel145.fsa_aa

hybridizing to HF probes were assigned red, those hybridizing to HR probes green, and those with EDIT probes blue.
The color intensity reflected the BLASTN score with higher
values assigned to greater homology. Colors were mixed

dant in the forward hybridization reaction compared to
the reverse. This is suggested by the manufacturer to
reduce the number of false positives. The colonies not
analyzed fell into two, roughly equal sized groups; those
that hybridized to both forward and reverse probes and
those that hybridized to neither. While this step reduces
the number of false positives, it also may eliminate interesting transcripts. In particular, colonies that hybridized
with neither probe likely represented weakly expressed,
low abundance transcripts [24]. Furthermore, colonies
that hybridized to probes from multiple libraries may
contain conserved domains in otherwise distinct proteins.
Therefore we sequenced additional, unselected clones
from the EDIT library and eliminated the hybridization in
constructing the HF and HR libraries.

the encoding gene, we mapped the virtual translations of
the SSH ESTs onto the most homologous protein in the
plant protein database. The tcl_blast_parser_123_V017
was used to convert BLASTX output data to a table format
suitable for manipulation in a spreadsheet [25]. Using the
length of the target ORF and the amino acid locations corresponding to the start and stop of the aligned region
between the SSH and plant homologs, we estimated the
number and length of Triphysaria sequences predicted to
be either 3' or 5' non-coding (Table 2, Figure 2). These
regions provide good candidate sites for identifying gene
specific primers.

low colors to each sequence based on the degree to which
the target sequence had homologies in other libraries. The
intensity of color was a function of the BLASTN e value
and colors were mixed when sequences were present in
more than one library.

Depending on the library, from 34 % to 62% of the Triphysaria sequences were predicted to include non-coding
sequences; one to ten percent of the cDNAs included both
5' and 3' non-coding sequences (Table 2). There were
more 3' than 5' non-coding sequences in all libraries;
there were eight times more 3' sequences in the HR
library. The 3' non coding regions recovered in the SSH
libraries were also longer than those predicted for the 5'
(Figure 2). The 3' bias likely results from the initial cDNA
synthesis reaction that is primed with poly-T. Depending
on the library, between ten and twenty percent of the SSH
products had poly-A tracts. The predominance of ORF
encoded sequences in the libraries demonstrates that
these libraries were less biased towards 3' sequences than
would be expected without the Rsa1 digestion.

As shown in table 3, about seventy percent of the
sequences were specific to a single library. About seven
percent of the assemblies were found in both HF and
EDIT libraries but not HR; these represent likely candidates for early haustorium development. However similar
numbers of sequences were in common between the HF
and HR libraries, indicating a basal level of interlibrary
redundancy. The number of sequences in common
between forward and subtracted libraries is higher than
expected if there was no selection for particular crosshybridizing sequences. If the one thousand sequenced
assemblies in each library represent 2% of the approximately 20,000 root transcripts [26], about 0.4% of assemblies would be expected in both libraries by chance alone.
In a previously published wet lab characterization of the
EDIT library, we reported that about 20% of the clones
cross-hybridized to transcripts in both forward and
reverse subtracted probes. Other experiments employing
SSH procedures report false positive rates of cross-hybridizing clones of 30–50% [27,28]. The Clonetech Selelect
PCR users guide states that recovery rates of false positives
will vary between tissue types and RNA preparations [29].

Interlibrary comparisons
We used BLASTN to identify nucleotide sequences in common between the different libraries. This is a bioinformatics alternative to colony hybridization to identify
interlibrary sequence homologies. Figure 3 is a color representation of the BLASTN results generated by the
PyMood software package (Allometra, Davis, CA). The
squares represent 3820 assembly sequences arrayed in the
order HF, HR and EDIT. BLASTN was performed using the
concatenated sequences from the virtual array as target
and sequences from each library as query. PyMood parsed
the BLAST output and assigned mixes of red, blue and yel-

The unpredictably high rate of cross-library hybridizing
transcripts was not a function of the assembly because a
BLASTN analysis of EST sequences before assembly gave
similar results (data not shown). Approximately half of
the cross-hybridizing sequences had multiple sequence
polymorphisms, suggesting these are alleles of coexpressed genes or domains. The levels of expression of
cross-hybridizing sequences were estimated from the Arabidopsis MPSS database to determine if they are particularly highly expressed in roots [26]. The Arabidopsis
homologs to cross-hybridizing Triphysaria sequences
ranged in their root expression between six and over three

thousand transcripts per trillion. An ANOVA analysis
indicated no significant differences between the predicted
expression levels of library specific sequences from false
positives present in both forward and subtracted libraries
(data not shown).
One possible explanation for the unpredictably large
number of false positive clones following SSH procedures
is miss-priming at the first or second PCR reactions.
cDNAs that were not selected during hybridization would
be similarly amplified from both libraries if they have sufficient homology to the 22-mers used in the final amplifications prior to cloning.
Functional classifications
BLASTX was used to assign putative functions to virtual
translations of each library specific assembly. Roughly
75–80% of the library specific sequences had homologies
in the Arabidopsis protein database at an e value ≤ 10-8.
Using the AT number of the best Arabidopsis hits, the putative Triphysaria proteins were placed into functional categories using the Gene Ontology at TAIR [30]. The GO
terms obtained for each library are summarized in supplemental table 1. The TAIR output included multiple GO
terms for most assemblies so there are more GO descriptors than transcripts.

We used chi squared analyses to determine whether different libraries were enriched for certain GO functional categories (supplemental table 1). The frequency of a
particular GO term was determined from the total
number of GO terms obtained for that library. The relative
frequencies of specific GO terms were then compared
between libraries. Table 4 summarizes pair wise comparisons between libraries in the proportion of transcripts in

each of the GO categories. The most significant functional
enrichment was the overrepresentation of transcripts associated with electron transport in the HF library relative to
HR (table 4). Electron transport functions were also
enriched in the EDIT library relative to HR although at a
lower significance (p ≤ 0.05). Correspondingly, transcripts associated with mitochondria were also over-represented in the HF and EDIT libraries relative to the HR
library. The over representation of transcripts associated
with electron transport is consistent with the model that
haustorial inducing factors trigger development through
redox mediated mechanisms [31,32]. The HF library was
also enriched for transcripts associated with stress
responses. This was previously recognized in the EDIT
library and is consistent with the long standing hypothesis
that parasitic plants recruit defense related genes for host
recognition [7,20].
Transcripts associated with the metabolism of nucleic
acids and proteins were significantly less abundant in the
HF and EDIT compared to the HR libraries. The down regulation of DNA metabolism genes is consistent with the
earlier observations that cell division and DNA synthesis
is rapidly terminated in Striga upon contact with DMBQ
[33]. There were also fewer transcripts predicted to encode
protein metabolism functions in the HF and EDIT libraries. While changes in protein profiles have been observed
in Striga following DMBQ treatment, the overall reduction in the proportion of transcripts encoding protein
metabolism genes was not expected [34,35].

Conclusion
Parasitic plants provide an excellent system for studying
genetic mechanisms of chemical signaling between
plants. In addition, parasitic weeds are among the world's

most destructive agricultural pests against which few
genetic resistances are available. Genetic suppression of
parasite development at early stages in parasitism is a
promising approach for engineering resistance against
parasitic weeds but requires knowledge of the genetic factors regulating parasite development. The Pscroph database contains parasitic plant transcripts regulated by host
encoded factors; these provide potential points for engineering parasite resistance. More generally, the identification of regulatory elements induced by the presence of
other plants provides the potential for genetic weed control strategies.

All additional files are in Excel format. Footnote to additional files 1-7:
Sequences from three libraries were compared by BLASTN to determine
which sequences were present in more than one library. The BLASTN cutoff e value was 10-80. Supplemental tables 1-3 contain the library specific
sequences and their annotations, tables 4-6 contain sequences present in
HF and HR libraries, or HF and EDIT libraries, or HR and EDIT libraries, and table 7 contains sequences present in all three libraries. The annotations shown are parsed from a BLASTX search of the Arabidopsis
protein database ATH1.pep_cm_20040228. Footnote to additional file 8:
The HF, HR and EDIT specific sequences were annotated with Gene
Ontogeny descriptors by cross referencing to the best BLASTX hit in
ATH1.pep via TAIR [30]. The first three columns of numbers show the
number of times a particular GO descriptor was assigned. Most of the
assemblies were annotated with multiple GO descriptors so there are more
descriptors than assemblies. A total of 5499 GO descriptors were obtained
for the HF library, 7222 GO descriptors from the HR and 8381 descriptors from the EDIT library. Pair-wise comparisons were made between
each library for the relative proportion of annotations in a particular GO
class. For example, 5499 GO annotations were obtained from the HF
assemblies; of these, 666 (12.1%) were annotated as "other physiological
processes". Similarly, 931 of the 7222 (12.9%) of the GO annotations
obtained from the HR library were "other physiological processes". The
resultant Chi-squared value is 1.73, suggesting there are not significant
differences in the proportion of assemblies annotated as "other physiological processes" between the HF and HR libraries. In contrast, the relative
proportion of "other physiological processes" annotations in the EDIT
library is 11.8 % (992 out of 7222 total); this is significantly different
from the proportions obtained for the HR library (12.9%) but not the HF
(12.1%) at p ≤ 0.05. Numbers in the cells are the Chi-squared values calculated. The yellow shaded cells indicate significant p values ≤ 0.05.
