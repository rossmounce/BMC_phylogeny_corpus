Abstract
Background: Parasitic wasps constitute one of the largest group of venomous animals. Although some
physiological effects of their venoms are well documented, relatively little is known at the molecular level on the
protein composition of these secretions. To identify the majority of the venom proteins of the endoparasitoid wasp
Chelonus inanitus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), we have randomly sequenced 2111 expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
from a cDNA library of venom gland. In parallel, proteins from pure venom were separated by gel electrophoresis
and individually submitted to a nano-LC-MS/MS analysis allowing comparison of peptides and ESTs sequences.
Results: About 60% of sequenced ESTs encoded proteins whose presence in venom was attested by mass
spectrometry. Most of the remaining ESTs corresponded to gene products likely involved in the transcriptional and
translational machinery of venom gland cells. In addition, a small number of transcripts were found to encode
proteins that share sequence similarity with well-known venom constituents of social hymenopteran species, such
as hyaluronidase-like proteins and an Allergen-5 protein.
An overall number of 29 venom proteins could be identified through the combination of ESTs sequencing and
proteomic analyses. The most highly redundant set of ESTs encoded a protein that shared sequence similarity with
a venom protein of unknown function potentially specific of the Chelonus lineage. Venom components specific to
C. inanitus included a C-type lectin domain containing protein, a chemosensory protein-like protein, a protein
related to yellow-e3 and ten new proteins which shared no significant sequence similarity with known sequences.
In addition, several venom proteins potentially able to interact with chitin were also identified including a chitinase,
an imaginal disc growth factor-like protein and two putative mucin-like peritrophins.
Conclusions: The use of the combined approaches has allowed to discriminate between cellular and truly venom
proteins. The venom of C. inanitus appears as a mixture of conserved venom components and of potentially lineagespecific proteins. These new molecular data enrich our knowledge on parasitoid venoms and more generally, might
contribute to a better understanding of the evolution and functional diversity of venom proteins within Hymenoptera.

Background
Hymenopteran venoms have been intensively studied in
social species such as bees, bumblebees, wasps, hornets
and ants [1-6]. Most of the major allergens have been
identified in species of medical importance through a
combination of transcriptomic, proteomic, peptidomic

and glycomic techniques recently gathered under the
newly proposed term of venomic approaches [7]. In
comparison, little has been done on the venom composition of parasitoid Hymenoptera although they represent more than 75% of described hymenopteran species
and 10-20% of all insect species [8]. Fundamental benefits expected from venomic approaches applied to parasitic wasp venoms would consist, for example, in the
discrimination between cellular transcripts present in
the venom glands and those encoding true venom proteins, through the proteomic analysis of venom fluid.

Moreover comprehensive analyses would allow a deeper
characterization of weakly expressed venom components
and a comparative work aiming at retracing the evolutionary history of hymenopteran venoms. Parasitoid
venom proteins also constitute an underestimated
source of toxins that could be studied for a variety of
applied uses.
Parasitic wasps constitute by far the largest group of
parasitic insects with an estimated total number of species of approximately 250 000 [9]. Some develop outside
(ectoparasitoids) and others inside (endoparasitoids) the
body of an insect or other arthropod host and, depending on the species, various stages of the host can be
parasitized (egg, egg-larval, larval, pupal and adult parasitoids). In ectoparasitoid species, venoms often induce
paralysis and/or regulate host development, metabolism
and immune responses [10-12]. Venom proteins from
endoparasitic wasps are predominately involved in regulation of host physiology and immune responses alone
or in combination with other factors of maternal origin
such as polydnaviruses (PDVs) or virus-like particles
present in the venom itself or produced in the ovaries
and ovarian fluids [13-17]. For example, venoms can
synergize the effects of PDVs [18,19] and can interfere
with host’s humoral [20-22] and cellular immune components [23-26].
To date, less than 50 proteins have been individually
identified and characterized from the venoms of a
restricted number of parasitoid wasps species [15,27].
Broader studies have also previously investigated the
composition of parasitoid venoms by the separate use of
proteomic or transcriptomic approaches combined with
bioinformatic analyses. A recent analysis of the venom
proteome of the pupal ectoparasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis has been published, that benefited from the
sequencing and annotation of this wasp genome [28].
Twelve venom proteins from the endoparasitoid Pteromalus puparum were also identified recently using a proteomic approach [29]. On the other hand, transcriptome
analyses allowed the identification of venom proteins in
the pupal endoparasitoid Pimpla hypochondriaca [30-32]
and in two adult endoparasitoid species of the genus
Microctonus [33]. Although these works are undoubtedly
of great interest, most of them did not provide absolute
evidence that all identified proteins were venom components. Therefore, there is still a crucial need for extensive
analyses by combining various techniques of investigation
at the molecular level to allow comparisons between
species.
Chelonus inanitus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is original among the parasitoid species currently studied in
being an egg-larval endoparasitoid species. Indeed it oviposits into the eggs of its host, Spodoptera littoralis
(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and the parasitoid larva then

Page 2 of 15

develops inside the host embryo and early larval stages.
Due to its lifestyle, C. inanitus must thus face up to particular physiological constraints imposed by its immature hosts. The venom, along with PDVs produced in
the reproductive system of this wasp, are essential for
successful parasitism as they protect the parasitoid from
encapsulation by host’s immune cells [34], interfere with
the host’s nutritional physiology [35] and induce a
developmental arrest in the prepupal stage [18,36,37].
Venom of C. inanitus by itself alters the membrane permeability of host hemocytes, has a transient paralytic
effect [38] and synergizes the effect of the PDVs on host
development [18]. The data gathered on the functions
of its venom make C. inanitus a valuable model for
investigating the venom proteins. At least 25 proteins
were found [38] but their sequences were unknown.
The sequences of only two venom proteins from
another species of the subfamily Cheloninae, Chelonus
sp. near curvimaculatus, had been described to date
[39,40].
We report here the analysis of C. inanitus venom
gland products based on the sequencing of clones of a
cDNA library and on mass spectrometry analysis of
venom proteins. This is the first time that this combination of techniques was applied to identify venom proteins from an endoparasitic wasp. The data obtained
might contribute to acquiring a more comprehensive
view on the origin and functional diversity of venom
proteins among Hymenoptera.

Results and Discussion
General overview of the cDNA library of C. inanitus
venom gland

The 2111 ESTs from the venom glands of C. inanitus
were clustered into 488 clusters (95 contigs and 393 singletons, Table 1). The number of ESTs in each contig
ranged from 2 to 534 and these clusters were considered
as putative unigenes. The deduced sequences from 250
clusters (56 contigs and 194 singletons, 56.85% of all
ESTs) shared significant similarities with protein
sequences deposited in non-redundant databases
(EMBL/Genbank), a proportion comparable to that
found by Crawford et al. [33] which have studied the
venom gland transcriptome of the parasitoid wasp
Microctonus hyperodae. Of these products, 164 (corresponding to 36 contigs and 128 singletons, 21.5% of all
ESTs) shared significant similarity with proteins with
assigned molecular functions in the gene ontology database. This relatively low percentage is explained in part
by the fact that the function of the most represented
sequence (534 ESTs) referred below as Ci-23a, is
unknown. At level 2 of the gene ontology system, clusters were classified into 9 molecular functional categories (Figure 1), among which “binding” (GO:0005488)

and “catalytic activity” (GO:0003824) categories were
over-represented (95 and 82 clusters respectively). Interestingly, these categories were also the most common
functional categories assigned to the venom glands ESTs
from the saw-scaled viper, Echis ocellatus [41] and from
the solitary hunting wasp species, Orancistrocerus drewseni [42]. Catalytic activity and binding categories thus
constitute a hallmark of the venom gland transcriptomes
analysed to date. A “structural molecule activity” function (GO:0005198) has been assigned to 48 clusters (20
contigs, 28 singletons) that corresponded essentially to
genes coding for structural constituents of ribosomes
(17 contigs, 21 singletons). In addition, products of
genes functionally annotated as “translation regulator

activity” (GO:0045182) (8 singletons) and “transcription
regulator activity” (GO:0030528) (2 contigs, 15 singletons) were also identified, which encompassed transcriptional regulators, DNA or RNA binding proteins and
translation elongation factors. All these proteins presumably reflect the metabolic effort invested by the
venom gland for the transcription and translation of
secreted products. The 2111 ESTs were used to produce
in silico a database of venom gland open reading frames
(vgORFs) which were matched to the peptide sequences
obtained by nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. An overall of
1279 ESTs (26 contigs and 7 singletons, 60.6% of all
ESTs) were then identified as coding for venom proteins
of C. inanitus.

Identification of the venom proteins of C. inanitus

Venoms of parasitic wasps are reputed to have a low
content in small proteins and peptides in comparison to
venoms of social Hymenoptera [27,43]. Upon separation
of C. inanitus venom proteins by SDS-PAGE, at least 25
proteins with apparent molecular masses ranging from
14 to 300 kDa had been observed while no bands were
seen below 14 kDa. This was also consistent with data
previously reported [38] from the analysis of SDS-PAGE
and two-dimension electrophoresis gels stained with Silver or Coomassie blue staining methods. For the nanoLC-MS/MS analysis presented here, several gradient gels
(4-15%) were run at various conditions to allow excision
of all gel bands detectable upon Coomassie blue staining. Figure 2 shows that the analysed bands represent
the majority of the venom proteins of C. inanitus. However, the presence in this venom of small amounts of
additional proteins and peptides cannot be excluded.
For 25 proteins, named Ci-14a to Ci-300, peptide
sequences exactly matching sequences of the vgORF
database were obtained upon nano-LC-MS/MS analysis
(see additional file 1: Table of peptide identification).
Furthermore, peptides belonging to four additional proteins were detected, namely Vem7, Vem11, Vem17 and
Vem37 (Vem being an abbreviation for Venom Mix).
These proteins were found in several gel bands, a situation usually found for very abundant proteins. There
was no evident correspondence between the relative
abundance of venom protein bands on the gel (Figure 2)
and the abundance of the corresponding ESTs in the
vgORFs database (Table 2). The detailed list of the identified venom proteins will be discussed in the following
sections.
Ci-23a and Ci-45, two proteins with similarities with
venom proteins from C. sp. near curvimaculatus

The Ci-23a venom protein was encoded by a contig corresponding to the highest number of ESTs in the library
(534). It displays 50% of sequence identity (BlastP, Evalue = 7e-21) with a 32.5 kDa protein referred as
“venom protein from C. sp. near curvimaculatus“ [GenBank:ACI70208.1], another chelonine wasp. This latter
protein was historically the first to be isolated and
sequenced from the venom of a parasitoid Hymenoptera
[39]. Although it was found to be necessary for the survival of the parasitoid in the lepidopteran host, Trichoplusia ni [44], it is still not related to any other known
protein and its function remains unknown to date. A
potential cleavage site for both N-arginine dibasic convertase (pattern: .RK|RR[^KR]) and subtilisin-like proprotein convertase (pattern: [KR]R.) was detected at
positions 51 to 53 (RRA) of the Ci-23a sequence. However, sequences coding for such convertases were not
found in our vgORFs database. Remarkably, Ci-23a was

proteins collected from two venom reservoirs were separated on a
4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R-250. From such gels (run at varying conditions) bands were
excised and submitted to nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Numbers on the

devoid of the 12 tandem repeats of 14 residues that
characterized the C-terminal part of the venom protein
of C. sp. near curvimaculatus (see additional file 2:
Amino acid sequence alignment of Ci-23a and the
venom protein from C. sp near curvimaculatus) [39].
These repeat sequences form several a-helices with
strong amphipathic structures supposed to run at the
surface of the protein [39] and we found that they contain an unusualy high number of potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites (14 serine motifs involved in the
motif pattern: [ED]{0,3}.(S) [GA]). Thus Ci-23a, which is
much shorter than its homologue, is potentially processed by non-venomous convertases and is likely to
have a substrate or target site specificity different from

that of the 32.5 kDa venom protein of C. sp. near curvimaculatus. Interestingly, the latter is a very abundant
venom protein [44] while Ci-23a protein is of low abundance (Figure 2).
The Ci-45 venom protein, which gives a strong band
upon Coomassie staining (Figure 2), shows high similarity (BlastP, 79% identity, E-value = 2e-141) to a 52 kDa
chitinase from venom of C. sp. near curvimaculatus
[GenBank:AAA61639.1] [40]. Both proteins possess a
predicted signal peptide and a glycosyl hydrolase family
18 domain (Pfam: PF00704) with four highly conserved
regions present in all known insect chitinases [45-47]
(see additional file 3: Amino acid sequence alignment of
representative chitinases from different insect species).
Members of glycosyl hydrolases 18 family show an
eight-stranded a/b barrel catalytic core structure [48].

The 17 residues featuring this functional domain were
all found in the Ci-45 sequence, notably those of the
second conserved region implicated in catalysis, as
shown by previous site-directed mutagenesis studies
(consensus sequence: (F/L)DG(L/I)DLD(W/I)EYP))
[47,49]. Four cysteine residues involved in two disulfide
bonds are conserved in the two Cheloninae enzymes
and the secondary structures of both proteins were predicted to be highly similar in the placement of a-helix,
b-strand and coil structure (data not shown). Ci-45 differs from its homologue by the absence of a C-terminal
chitin-binding Peritrophin-A domain (CBM_14, Pfam:
PF01607), but this domain does not appear to be essential for the chitinolytic activity of chitinases in Arthropods [46,50-52]. The Ci-45 contig is thus most likely
coding for an active venom chitinase and might be

Vincent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:693
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/693

responsible for the chitinase activity previously detected
in the venom of C. inanitus [38]. According to the classification proposed by Zhu et al. [47], it belongs to a
group of conserved insect chitinases containing a single
catalytic domain (group IV). Our phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 3) grouped the chitinases from venom glands of
C. inanitus and C. sp. near curvimaculatus in a monophyletic clade with that from teratocytes of T. nigriceps
[GenBank:AAX69085.1]. Teratocytes are parasitoid wasp
secretory cells that circulate into the parasitized host
haemolymph, and represent a different way for the wasp
to deliver virulence factors into the host. The teratocyte
released chitinase from T. nigriceps is hypothesized to
contribute to the avoidance of microbial contamination
of the host’s haemocoel or to facilitate the emergence of
parasitoid larvae through the host’s cuticle [53]. Other
examples of chitinases produced by venom glands were
previously reported from spiders [54,55] and from the
parasitoid wasps M. hyperodae [33] and N. vitripennis
[28]. More recently, a chitinase produced by the posterior salivary glands of the cephalopod Octopus kaurna
has also been described [56]. Venom and salivary glands
chitinases described are thus restricted to invertebrate
species. Interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis shows
that venom chitinases belong to distinct clades

Page 6 of 15

comprising also non venomous enzymes. This suggests
chitinases have been selected for production in invertebrate venom glands through multiple independent
recruitment events.
Ci-48b, an IDGF-like protein

Like Ci-45, Ci-48b possesses a glycosyl hydrolase family
18 domain (see additional file 4: Amino acid sequence
alignment of Imaginal disc Growth Factors (IDGFs)-like
proteins from different insect species). However, in the
second conserved region, a glutamine residue (Q157)
replaces the glutamic acid residue that plays a key role
in active insect and bacterial chitinases, in being the
putative proton donor during the catalytic mechanism
[49,57,58]. This feature is shared by members of the
imaginal disc growth factors (IDGFs) family which have
presumably evolved from chitinases to gain new functions [59]. Interestingly, Ci-48b shows high sequence
similarity to IGDFs from several insect species, namely a
venom gland protein of honey bee workers [NCBI Reference Sequence: XP_396769.2] and a hemocyte aggregation inhibitor protein from the lepidopteran species
Manduca sexta [GenBank:ACW82749.1] (Blast P 38%
identity; E-value = 2e-76) [60]. Thus Ci-48b may contribute to the survival and development of C. inanitus

eggs once oviposited into their host either by acting as a
growth factor or alternatively, by modulating the cellular
immune response of young S. littoralis host larvae.
Ci-23c and Ci-220, two putative mucin-like peritrophins

The sequence of the Ci-23c venom protein is 177 amino
acid long, giving a theoretical molecular mass of 19.6
kDa (see additional file 5: Amino acid sequence alignment of Ci-23c, Ci-220 and AD-873). It possesses two
Chitin-binding peritrophin domains 14 (CBM_14, positions 26-78 and 92-144) and a predicted glycosaminoglycan attachment site (positions 155-158). Another
venom protein, Ci-220 (229 amino acids, theoretical
molecular mass 26.3 kDa), also contains two CBM_14
domains (positions 29-84 and 82-135) and a predicted
glycosaminoglycan attachment site (positions 138-141).
The two proteins share an overall 32% identity (BlastP,
E-value = 1e-16) and show sequence similarities to a
wide variety of CBM_14 domains containing proteins,
including a venom component from N. vitripennis [28].
Moreover they share the domain organization of the
mucine-like peritrophin AD-873 identified from the salivary gland transcriptome of the mosquito Anopheles
darlingi [GenBank:ACI30179.1]. Interestingly this peritrophin is speculated to contribute to the maintenance
of the structure of the mouthparts and/or salivary canal
of A. darlingi [61]. In C. inanitus, oviposition is accompanied by intense contractions of the abdomen, which
are necessary to push the venom from the reservoir into
the oviduct, since the venom reservoir is located at the
distal end of one of the gland filaments and has a very
thin wall without a muscle layer [38]. It is thus possible
that the venom proteins Ci-23c and Ci-220, as the mosquito peritrophin, contribute to keeping the reservoir in
shape.
Vem7, an ancient yellow-e3-like venom protein

Vem7 shares high sequence similarity to the yellow-e3
protein [GenBank:ABB82366.1] from A. mellifera
(BlastP, 42% identity, E-value = 2e-81). The yellow-e3
gene is highly expressed in the head and hypopharyngeal
gland of honey bee workers and is considered as the
progenitor of all genes of major royal jelly proteins
(MRJPs) of A. mellifera. Located in the same genomic
region and sharing a similar exon/intron organization,
MRJPs would have been generated via recent duplications [62,63]. Recently, two members of the MRJPs
family, MRJP8 [GenBank:ACD84799.1] and MRJP9
[GenBank:ACD84800.1], were identified in the venom
gland proteome of A. mellifera [5]. It is noteworthy that
phylogenetic analyses put them at the basis of the
MRJPs tree, meaning that they are the most ancient
members of the MRJPs family and suggesting a venomous “pre-royal jelly” function for the MRJPs progenitor

originating from yellow-e3 [5,63]. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that Vem7 forms a monophyletic group with
yellow-e-3 protein (Figure 4) and thus represents the
first example of a venomous protein in this clade. This
supports the hypothesis that a yellow-e-3 gene progenitor of MRJPs may have encoded a venomous protein
like the Vem7 gene.
Putative enzymes

Ci-50 is a venom protein belonging to the lipase family
(Pfam: PF00151). One carboxyl-esterase and two other
lipases were previously identified in the venom proteome of N. vitripennis [28] and a lipase activity has
been found in the venom of P. hypochondriaca [64]. In
N. vitripennis, venom lipases might participate in the
alteration of host’s lipid metabolism to the benefit of the
developing parasitoid eggs [65] and a similar function is
conceivable for C. inanitus.
The partial sequence of the Ci-300 venom protein
shares 39% sequence similarity (BlastP, E-value = 2e-05)
with a Zinc-dependent metalloprotease identified in the
venom of P. hypochondriaca [GenBank:CAD21587.1].
However, Ci-300 lacks the functional characteristic Zn2
+
-binding motif of HExxHxxGxxH and a distal located
methionine [66] found in venom metalloproteinases
from the parasitoid species P. hypochondriaca [67], M.
aethiopoides [33], Eulophus pennicornis [68] and N.
vitripennis [28] (see additional file 6: Partial amino acid
sequence alignment of Ci-300 with insect metalloproteases). The sequence of Ci-300 could have thus considerably diverged from an ancestral Zinc-dependent
metalloprotease-like protein to acquire an original function in the venom of C. inanitus.
The Ci-95 venom protein shows significant sequence
similarity to various angiotensin converting enzymes
(ACEs, Pfam: PF01401) and notably to an ACE-like protein from A. mellifera [NCBI Reference Sequence:
XP_393561.2] (BlastP, 46% identity, E-value = 2e-29). In
addition, upon Western analysis with an antibody made
against recombinant Drosophila ACE (kindly provided
by Dr. Elwyn Isaac, University of Leeds, UK) a clear
band was seen (data not shown). ACE is a dipeptidyl
carboxydipeptidase with a broad in vitro substrate specificity that is best known, in mammals, for its role in
converting inactive angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor,
angiotensin II, and the inactivation of bradykinin [69].
In insects, ACE-like proteins appear to have a wide tissue distribution, from embryos to adult stages [70,71]
and some have been implicated in the metabolic inactivation of neuropeptides in the central nervous system
[72]. Dani et al. [73] have detected an ACE-like enzymatic activity in the venom of P. hypochondriaca and
have speculated that venomous ACE could be involved
in the processing of peptide precursors in the venom

reservoir. More recently, another ACE-like enzyme has
also been identified in the venom of N. vitripennis [28].
Ci-80a, a venom protein encoded by a single transcript
identified in our VgORFs database, belongs to the peptidase family C1, sub-family C1A (papain family, clan CA,
Pfam: PF00112). The partial sequence of Ci-80a contains
two out of the four conserved residues of the active site
of C1A proteases and all the residues involved in the S2
subsite, which is involved in specificity for the dominant
substrate of papain-like cysteine proteases. Interestingly,
viral cystatins encoded by the genome of the bracovirus
CcBV, associated with the parasitic wasp Cotesia congregata, were shown to target some C1A proteases of the
host M. sexta [74]. Cathepsins and their inhibitors may
play an important role, yet undetermined, in the context
of host-parasitoid physiological relationships.
The Ci-40a venom protein contains a partial trypsinlike serine protease domain (Pfam: PF00089) but
displays low sequence similarities with other known proteases (see additional file 7: Amino acid sequence alignment of Ci-40a with serine protease homologs (SPHs)).
At least one of the three residues involved in the catalytic triad for serine protease (aspartate residue in position
111) is present in the partial sequence of Ci-40a. Several

serine protease homologs were already reported from
parasitoid venoms. In the endoparasitoid C. rubecula,
the venom protein Vn50 [GenBank:AAP49428.1] has
been found to be a mutated serine protease acting as an
inhibitor of the defensive reaction of melanization of
host hemolymph [21]. In addition, members of the serine protease protein family were recently identified in
the venom proteomes of N. vitripennis [28] and P.
puparum [29].
The Ci-120 protein shares significant sequence similarity with insect alpha-N-acetyl glucosaminidases
(Pfam: PF05089, EC: 3.2.1.50) and might play a role in
proteoglycan metabolism.
Lectin-like venom protein

A C-type lectin domain (Pfam: PF00059) was found in
the sequence of the Ci-180 venom protein. The domain
extends from positions 76 to 199 of the partial
sequence. An immunosuppressive function has been
proposed for a lectin with a similar C-type lectin
domain, encoded by the genome of the bracovirus
CpBV, associated with the parasitic wasp Cotesia plutellae [75]. Since parasitoid venoms and PDVs are used by
the wasps to manipulate parasitized host physiology, it

Vincent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:693

might not be surprising that common molecules have
been selected for delivery into the host via different
pathways.
CSP-like and OBP-like proteins

The Ci-14a venom protein belongs to the A10/OS-D
insect pheromone-binding protein family (Pfam:
PF03392). A high sequence similarity was observed
between Ci-14a and Csp3 from A. mellifera (BlastP, 56%
identity, E-value = 5e-27), another member of the A10/
OS-D protein family. Csp3 [GenBank:ABH88171.1] is a
chemosensory protein (CSP) ubiquitously expressed in
adults and pre-imaginal stages of the honeybee in which
it may play a role in cuticle maturation [76].
Ci-23b is a venom protein containing a pheromone
binding protein/general-odorant binding protein (PBP/
GOBP) domain (Pfam: PF01395). Homology searches
revealed that Ci-23b has highly diverged from known
PBPs and GOBPs. In particular, it only shows 4 out of
the 6 cystein residues strictly conserved between PBPs
and GOBPs [77,78]. Other OBP-like venom proteins,
unrelated to Ci-23b, have previously been identified in
the venom proteomes of A. mellifera workers and N.
vitripennis females (NCBI Reference Sequences:
NP_001035313.1 and NP_001155150.1, respectively)
[5,28]. Beside the involvement of PBPs and OBPs in
chemical communication, it is possible that in Hymenoptera, some OBP-like proteins fulfil other roles in
relation with the venomous functions.
Venom proteins similar to lethal (1) G0193 isoforms

Ci-48a, Vem17 and Ci-80b venom proteins share
sequence similarities with members of a group of proteins similar to protein isoforms A [GenBank:
AAF46301.1] and B [GenBank:AAS65275.1] encoded by
the lethal (1) G0193 gene from D. melanogaster. This
group of cystein-rich proteins notably includes several

venom and salivary gland proteins of unknown functions reported from various insect species (see additional
file 8: Sequence similarities between Ci-48a, Vem17 and
Ci-80b and proteins similar to isoforms of lethal (1)
G0193). Ci-80b possesses the least conserved amino
acid sequence towards lethal (1) G0193 isoforms suggesting it might have diverged as a virulence factor
involved in host-parasite interactions, which are often
characterized by a high level of divergence.
New lineage-specific proteins

In addition to Ci-23a and Ci-45 which are conserved in
the venom of two Chelonus species, ten C. inanitus
venom proteins did not show any significant sequence
similarity to known proteins (Ci-14b, Ci-15, Ci-27, Ci28, Ci-35a, Ci-35b, Ci-40c, Ci-60, Vem11 and Vem 37).
This is reminiscent of observations on twenty three
venom proteins in N. vitripennis which also have no
similarity to known proteins and appear to be lineageand/or species specific [28]. Given that Chelonines are
egg-larval parasitoids it is possible that new C. inanitus
proteins have evolved to cope with this particular parasitic context. Although they do not contain conserved
domains, they may play an important role during hostparasite interaction and notably Ci-14b, the second
most abundant sequence of the transcriptome (286
ESTs).
Additional putative venom proteins identified from the
vgORFs database

In addition to proteins identified by mass spectrometry,
several ESTs encoding putative venom proteins were
identified in our vgORFs database (Table 3). Five ESTs
encoded partial sequences of at least three different hyaluronidase-like proteins that show significant sequence
similarities to venom hyaluronidases described from several hymenopteran species [79]. One EST encoded a

venom allergen 5-like protein (Figure 5). Venom allergen 5 proteins (also called antigens 5) are commonly
found in venoms of social Hymenoptera of the superfamilly Vespoidea [80]. They belong to a wider group of
proteins expressed by salivary and venom glands of distant animal species, recently gathered under the proposed term of CAP proteins for “Cystein-rich secretory
proteins, Antigen 5 and Pathogenesis-related proteins”
[56]. CAP domain proteins are the dominant allergyinducing toxins in hymenopteran venoms [81], and a
related CAP protein has previously been identified from
the venom of M. hyperodae [33].

Conclusions
In this paper we report the identification of the majority
of venom proteins of the egg-larval endoparasitoid wasp
C. inanitus. We combined technical approaches which
we had successfully used to elucidate the origin of bracoviruses [82]. They are powerful tools to study evolutionary and functional aspects of parasitoid-associated
factors. The most highly redundant set of sequences
encoded a protein (Ci-23a) that shared sequence similarity with a venom protein previously identified in the
related species C. sp. near curvimaculatus [39]. These
venom proteins are thus likely to play a key role, as yet

Page 10 of 15

undetermined, in the life cycle of Cheloninae egg-larval
endoparasitoids. In addition, we have identified 453 unigenes that, for the most part, are likely to code for nonsecretory products of the venom glands.
A striking feature of C. inanitus venom was the
redundancy of components able to interact with chitin.
These components might be important when intermediate or late stages of eggs are parasitized. In this case, the
parasitoid larva has to bore itself into the host embryo
which is surrounded by an embryonic cuticle [83] and
chitinases might help to facilitate this process.
A number of C. inanitus venom proteins and enzymes
shared similarities to venom gland products from other
species that also belong to the Ichneumonoidea superfamily (M. hyperodae, M. aethiopoides, P. hypochondriaca). Sequence similarities were also found with
venom proteins from more distant apocritan species
representative from Chalcidoidea (N. vitripennis), Vespoidea (O. drewseni, Anoplius samariensis, Dolichovespula arenaria) and Apoidea (A. mellifera, Apis cerana
cerana) superfamilies (see additional file 9: Phylogeny of
the major superfamilies of Hymenoptera). The presence
of related venom proteins in species that do not share
the same ecological constraints and lifestyles can partly
be explained by independent recruitment of these

characterized in this study is shown in blue. Venom allergen 5 proteins clades are shown in red.

Vincent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:693

proteins during species evolution [56]. Our phylogenetic
analyses suggest this is the case for the venom chitinases
of the Cheloninae species and the venom chitinase 5 of
N. vitripennis that were acquired independently. However, given that all modern Apocrita share a common
ancestral parasitic origin [84], it is also expected that
some lineages have conserved ancestral venom genes.
Our finding of mRNA coding for a member of the allergen 5 proteins family in the venom glands of C. inanitus
appears to be an example of such conservation. The
sequence of the deduced protein is placed, with the
allergen 5 from the venom of M. hyperodae and N. vitripennis in a monophyletic clade with respect to the phylogenetic tree of allergen 5 proteins found in vespid and
ant venoms (Figure 5). This result suggests that the
ancestral gene was expressed by the venom glands of
the common ancestor of Ichneumonoidea and Aculeata,
155 to 185 million years ago [84] and could have been
lost in Apoidea. Allergen 5 proteins would thus be
representative of one of the most ancient group of
insect venom proteins.
Another interesting point is the discovery of a yellowe3-like protein, Vem7, in the venom of C. inanitus
which give more indications on the evolutionary history
of the yellow-e3 gene family among Hymenoptera. Interestingly the recent genome sequencing of N. vitripennis
has revealed the largest number of yellow/MRJP genes
so far found in any insect, including an independent
amplification of MRJP-like proteins [85]. It would be
worthy to determine if some of these genes have a venomous function in Nasonia species.
On a more general standpoint, once increasing number of comprehensive analyses will become available,
our work on the venom composition of C. inanitus will
contribute to retracing the evolution of venomous functions within Hymenoptera by comparison of the venomous arsenal of different species.

Methods
Insects

C. inanitus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a solitary egglarval parasitoid, was reared on one of its natural hosts
S. littoralis. Adult S. littoralis were kindly provided by
Syngenta AG, Stein, Switzerland. They were raised at
27°C at a LD photoperiod of 14 h:10 h and fed with an
artificial diet. Diet was prepared from dry powder (Beet
Army Worm Diet, Bio Serv, Frenchtown, New Jersey,
USA).

sterile Insect Ringer. Then, the venom gland filaments
were dissected, washed in sterile Ringer, put into an
Eppendorf tube containing 200 μl of RNAlater™(Qiagen)
and stored at - 80°C until RNA isolation. The morphology of the C. inanitus venom gland was previously
described by Kaeslin et al. [38]. For RNA isolation,
venom gland filaments from 60 female wasps were used;
no homogenization was necessary and 0.45 ml Lysis buffer RLT (Qiagen) including 143 mM b-mercaptoethanol
was added followed by a proteinase K digestion as
described by Johner and Lanzrein [86]. The RNA isolation (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) including an on column
DNase digestion (RNase-free DNase I) was performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA
was eluted from the column with 100 μl RNase-free
water. A second digestion with DNase I was carried out
and the RNA was then extracted with acidic phenol; the
RNA was precipitated as described in [87]. The yield
was 9 μg of total RNA.
cDNA library construction

A cDNA library was constructed with the Creator
SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (BD Biosciences, Ozyme, France) following the supplier’s instructions. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from 481
ng of total RNA extracted from C. inanitus venom
glands. The cDNA were ligated into pDNR-LIB (BD
Biosciences Clontech) and ligation products were transformed into ElectroMax DH10B-T1 Phage Resistant
Escherichia coli Competent Cells (Invitrogen, Fisher
Scientific, France).
Sequencing and ESTs quality control

To obtain an unbiased overview of the venom gland
transcriptome, colonies were amplified with the j29
DNA polymerase by rolling circle amplification. Sequencing was done on a ABI sequencer using the standard
M13 forward primer and BigDye terminator cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). Initially 384 clones from the library were analyzed
for the presence of venom proteins-related sequences.
These were detected and a sequencing of a total of 2500
clones was performed. The EST sequences obtained
were analysed for quality control; base calling step was
performed with the Phred program f(S9). Low quality
bases (phred score < 20) were masked and sequences
with more than 30% n-content, or shorter than 60 bp
(after vector/adaptator sequences removing) were
removed.

Collection of venom glands and RNA isolation

Female wasps were anaesthetized on ice for several minutes and then shortly rinsed in 70% ethanol. The
abdominal organs were gently pulled out with forceps
and the reproductive apparatus was placed in 50 μl

ESTs clustering and assembly

After discarding the poor-quality sequences, 2111 highquality ESTs were subjected to clustering using the
TIGR software TGI Clustering tool (TGICL) [88]. The

Vincent et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:693
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/693

clustering was performed by a modified version of
NCBI’s megablast. EST sequences were assigned to clusters based on identity: the clustering parameters were
98% minimum percent identity for overlaps, for a minimum overlap length of 40 nt and a maximum length of
unmatched overhangs of 20 nt.
Sequences from each cluster were assembled into consensus sequences called “contigs” using the CAP3
assembly program [89] available in TGICL. Sequences
from a cluster containing only one sequence were called
“singletons”.
ESTs annotation

To identify similarities with known proteins, the
sequences of contigs and singletons were searched using
the BLASTX algorithm against a local non-redundant
protein database (NR, NCBI) with a cut-off E-value of
1e-5. To define the function of the contigs and singletons, we used the Gene Ontology (GO) controlled vocabulary [90] and more particularly GOSlim, a subset of
GO terms, which provides a higher level of annotations
and allows a more global view of the dataset. To this
end, an automated GO-annotation of the sequences of
contigs and singletons that showed a significant similarity with a Uniprot entry was achieved using the Blast2go
software [91], with a stringency cut-off of 1e-6.
Collection of venom, SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and protein identification

Wasps were anaesthetized on ice and their venom apparatus (venom gland filaments and reservoir) was dissected. For each protein separation the venom of four
wasps was collected. The venom was collected by piercing the reservoirs with a glass capillary. The sucked up
venom was collected in 10 μl sterile H 2 O and mixed
with 10 μl sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl pH 6.5, 4%
(w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue,
5% (v/v) b-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 90°C for 6
minutes. For separation of proteins, precast linear gradient READY GEL (BIO RAD) 4-15%Tris-HCl gels with
10 wells were used. Two equivalents of venom (i.e. the
amount of venom collected from two reservoirs) were
loaded per lane. Electrophoresis was in 0.02 M Tris-HCl
pH 8.8, 0.19 M glycine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. A constant
voltage of 150 V was applied. As marker the HighRange Rainbow™Molecular Weight Marker (GE Healthcare) was used. Staining was done with SERVA blue R
(Coomassie) Brilliant Blue R-250 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For protein identification, gel slices
were cut out, transferred into Eppendorf tubes and covered with 20 μl ethanol (20%). Treatment of gel slices
and nano-LC-MS/MS analysis was as described in [82].
CID spectra were extracted into data files by Bioworks
(Rev.3.3.1, Thermo Scientific) without any filters applied.

Combined dta files were automatically matched to our
personal database of vgORFs by Phenyx software, Version 2.5 (Genebio SA, Geneva, Switzerland). N-terminal
sequencing was done by Edman degradation.
Sequence analysis

Each cluster of nucleotide sequences was annotated by
being searched against GenBank NCBI database [92]
with BLAST algorithms. Since amino acid sequences are
more useful to detect homology over long periods, the
assembled sequences were translated on-line into the
correct open reading frames (ORFs) using ORFINDER
tool from NCBI [93] and compared to the sequences in
the NCBI nr and Swissprot protein databases. Sequences
that did not match were further compared against the
Genbank nucleotide databases (Blastn).
The signalP algorithm [94] was accessed online to predict the presence of signal peptides. The deduced amino
acid sequences of all the proteins identified by nano-LCMS/MS analysis were annotated by searching against Pfam
protein families database [95]. Modification, cleavage and
functional sites were predicted by the ELM server [96].
For amino acid sequence alignments, sequences were
retrieved from NCBI nr database, aligned with
sequences from C. inanitus with the program MAFFT
version 6.0 [97] and edited with the program Jalview
[98]. Alignment refinement was done with Gblocks software (version 0.91b) [99]. Phylogenetic relationships
were estimated by Bayesian MCMC analyses using the
program MrBayes 3.1.2 [100] available online [101,102].
For each set of aligned sequences, we implemented a
mixed model of amino acid substitution, with gammacorrection for heterogeneity rate among residues and
correction for invariable residues. Model of protein evolution was selected using ProtTest 2.4 software [103].
