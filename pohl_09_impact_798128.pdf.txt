Abstract
Background: The increase in availability of genomic sequences for a wide range of organisms has
revealed gene duplication to be a relatively common event. Encounters with duplicate gene copies
have consequently become almost inevitable in the context of collecting gene sequences for
inferring species trees. Here we examine the effect of incorporating duplicate gene copies evolving
at different rates on tree reconstruction and time estimation of recent and deep divergences in
butterflies.
Results: Sequences from ultraviolet-sensitive (UVRh), blue-sensitive (BRh), and long-wavelength
sensitive (LWRh) opsins, EF-1 and COI were obtained from 27 taxa representing the five major
butterfly families (5535 bp total). Both BRh and LWRh are present in multiple copies in some
butterfly lineages and the different copies evolve at different rates. Regardless of the phylogenetic
reconstruction method used, we found that analyses of combined data sets using either slower or
faster evolving copies of duplicate genes resulted in a single topology in agreement with our current
understanding of butterfly family relationships based on morphology and molecules. Interestingly,
individual analyses of BRh and LWRh sequences also recovered these family-level relationships. Two
different relaxed clock methods resulted in similar divergence time estimates at the shallower
nodes in the tree, regardless of whether faster or slower evolving copies were used, with larger
discrepancies observed at deeper nodes in the phylogeny. The time of divergence between the
monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus and the queen D. gilippus (15.3–35.6 Mya) was found to be much
older than the time of divergence between monarch co-mimic Limenitis archippus and red-spotted
purple L. arthemis (4.7–13.6 Mya), and overlapping with the time of divergence of the co-mimetic
passionflower butterflies Heliconius erato and H. melpomene (13.5–26.1 Mya). Our family-level
results are congruent with recent estimates found in the literature and indicate an age of 84–113
million years for the divergence of all butterfly families.
Conclusion: These results are consistent with diversification of the butterfly families following the
radiation of angiosperms and suggest that some classes of opsin genes may be usefully employed
for both phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimation.

Background
Gene duplication has long been recognized as a major
source of evolutionary innovation [1]. It is a pervasive
evolutionary process, with 50% of all genes in any given
genome expected to duplicate and proliferate at least once
in time scales ranging from 35 to 350 MA [2]. In molecular phylogenetics, gene duplication is a process that can
lead to discordance between gene and species trees, and
previous work has shown large problems with duplicate
genes undergoing concerted evolution or birth-and-death
processes [3]. The consensus has been to avoid the use of
paralogous genes until methods are developed to handle
their potential confounding effects [4]. Given the high
likelihood of gene duplication under neutral evolutionary
processes, however, as the size of molecular data sets gets
larger (in number of genes and taxa used) the amplification of duplicated genes may happen inadvertently even
in the course of targeting genes that appear at first glance
to be single copy (See below). The challenge is to begin
studying the range of phylogenetic signal such duplicate
genes provide, to assess their evolutionary dynamics and
potential signal for phylogenetics. Within the butterflies,
for instance, duplicate copies of opsin genes have been
found both within and between families [5], and our previous work suggested the possible utility of one of the
opsins for phylogenetic purposes [6]. The current work
seeks to clarify the potential utility of an expanded collection of opsins for butterfly phylogenetic reconstruction
and divergence time estimation.
Historically opsin genes have been advocated as phylogenetic markers, due to the amount of information we possess about their molecular evolution relative to other
nuclear genes, and the wealth of cloned sequences available for a wide array of organisms [7]. In fact, the long
wavelength-sensitive opsin gene (LWRh) has routinely
been used for the past 10 years in bee, bumblebee and
wasp phylogenetic studies [8-12], and has proven useful
at both shallow [13] and deep phylogenetic levels, suggesting its utility at resolving family level, Cretaceous age
insect divergences [14,15]. After gaining momentum as a
phylogenetic marker, a second copy of the gene, LWRh2,
was subsequently discovered in bees, which fortunately
appears to have evolved under a trajectory independent of
the first copy, making both copies suitable for tree building [16]. Currently there is little information about the
potential use of other opsin genes in reconstructing insect
phylogenies [16], yet almost all insects that have been
studied including butterflies have three clades of opsins
that encode spectrally distinct visual pigments present in
the adult compound eye that are ultraviolet- (UVRh),
blue- (BRh) and long wavelength (LWRh)-sensitive [17].
This suggests that other clades of opsins may also be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction over a similar range of
divergence times.

Butterflies are some of the best known organisms, possessing remarkable life histories and an uncanny beauty, but
yet their most basal relationships have been until recently
still obscure [18]. In the early days of butterfly evolution
research, the study of the oldest butterfly lineages was
intertwined with speculations about timing of their origins [19-22]. In more recent studies, the complexity of
simply finding the most plausible topologies, and the difficulty of disentangling molecular evolutionary rates and
divergence times, resulted in few studies directly concerned with timing the divergence of butterfly clades.
Concerns about the applicability of a molecular clock
[23], and the scarcity of butterfly fossils with which to calibrate it [24-26] have also undoubtedly contributed to
this paucity in the literature. In recent years the advent of
both non-parametric and highly parametric Bayesian
[27,28] methods that free the estimations of divergence
times from the restrictions of a molecular clock and permit the incorporation of flexible fossil or biogeographical
calibration points, has rekindled efforts to date the different diversification events within butterflies, and in the
process sparked a controversy about when and where butterflies originated [27,29]. A generally young and scant
record comprised of about 50 Rhopaloceran fossils, a
group which includes the skippers (Hesperioidea), nocturnal butterflies (Hedyloidea) and true dayflying butterflies (Papilionoidea), all found within the Cenozoic Era
(65.5-0 Mya) and not older than 56–57 Ma (a skipper)
and 48 Ma (a papilionid), respectively [30,31], has in of
itself not been particularly useful in the direct estimation
of the earliest butterfly divergences; and is considered by
some researchers as a veritable indicator of a recent butterfly origin, dating back to the last epoch of the late Cretaceous (70.6 ± 0.6 – 65.8 ± 0.3 Mya) or early Cenozoic
(65.5 – 0.0 Mya) no earlier than 70 Ma ago [18,29]. On
the other hand, molecular phylogenetic methods have
produced much older divergence time estimates for several butterfly families, prompting many to ascribe the origin of butterflies to the diversification of angiosperms,
between 100 and 140 Mya [32-37].
Another group of insects thought to have evolved concordantly with the early diversification of angiosperms are
the ants [38], but despite thorough sampling and an
ample fossil record, disagreements concerning basal relationships and timing of the earliest divergences still exist
[39,40](but see [41]). In contrast, the basal relationships
of butterflies are for the most part resolved, with our current understanding of relationships at the familial level
being based on the study of Wahlberg and collaborators,
which employed both molecular and morphological data
to resolve deep nodes in the phylogeny of butterflies [42].
Therefore, with a known phylogeny, butterflies are a useful group of organisms for examining the impact of dupli-

cate genes on phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence
time estimation.
In this study, we examine the effect of including duplicated opsin genes evolving at different rates on phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time estimates. We
find that individual and combined analyses of the BRh
and LWRh genes are able to recover butterfly family-level
relationships where previously morphological characters
were required in addition to molecular [42]. We estimate
divergence times for clades of high interest to the ecology
and evolutionary biology communities, such as for the comimics Heliconius erato and H. melpomene [43], the migratory monarch Danaus plexippus and the non-migratory
queen D. gilippus [44] and their co-mimics in the genus
Limenitis [45-47]. We find our estimates of family-level
times of divergence with slower evolving gene duplicates
to mostly be in agreement with other recent estimates
found in the literature based on molecular data, and we
push back the minimum age of divergence for the most
basal butterfly family to 113 Mya. Our results suggest the
potential utility of the opsins for resolving even older and
more complex group relationships such as the moths.

Results and discussion
Relative rates tests classify duplicate BRh and LWRh
opsins functionally
As mentioned previously, most insects including butterflies have adult compound eyes that contain at least three
classes of opsin genes (UVRh, BRh and LWRh) that encode
visual pigments with wavelengths of peak absorbance,
max, that fall roughly into the UV (300–400 nm), blue
(400–500 nm) and long wavelength (500–600 nm) portions of the light spectrum. Within these broad partitions
of the spectrum, the visual pigments of butterflies typically cluster in narrower ranges (i.e., 345–380 nm, 437–
470 nm and 514–565) (reviewed in [48]). There are, however, additional opsins that evolved from these three basic
classes in some butterfly eyes, which encode visual pigments with max values outside of these typical ranges (see
below).

All three basic classes of opsin (UVRh, BRh and LWRh)
were present in all 27 butterfly species included in this
study [Additional File 1], except in the two closely-related
satyrines, Neominois ridingsii and Oeneis chryxus, in which
no BRh gene could be found after exhaustive screening of
head-specific cDNAs. We think that these species probably do have blue-sensitive visual pigments in the eye
based on physiological studies (Gary Bernard, pers.
comm.) but we were simply unsuccessful in retrieving
them. Similarly, we also think that besides the violet opsin
we found in the pierid Colias philodice this species likely
has a blue-sensitive visual pigment in the eye based on
electrophysiological studies of a related species [49] but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/99

we did not find it. Full-length coding regions were otherwise obtained for the opsin cDNAs, including both start
and stop codons. The size of these transcripts, including 3'
and 5' UTR regions ranged from 1137–1575 bp (UVRh),
996–1590 bp (BRh), and 1143–1743 bp (LWRh). Besides
the three basic opsin classes, all lycaenid butterflies (this
study and [50]) and the pierid Pieris rapae [51] have duplicated blue opsins, representing two independent BRh
duplications, while the papilionids Papilio xuthus and P.
glaucus, the riodinid Apodemia mormo and the moth Bombyx mori possess duplicated LWRh opsins [6,52,53] representing four independent gene duplications (gene names
for the long-wavelength pigments have been renamed
here for simplicity).
Relative rates test showed that of the lycaenid blue opsin
duplicates, BRh1 evolved slower than BRh2 in every one of
the 7 lycaenid species sampled, although not significantly
so (Table 1). The slower rate of evolution of the BRh1
opsin is consistent with our observation that this gene
encodes the 437 nm visual pigment in Lycaena rubidus,
which is a wavelength of peak absorbance that is more
typical of the "blue-sensitive" visual pigments in butterflies, than the duplicate BRh2 gene in L. rubidus which
encodes the unusually red-shifted 500 nm visual pigment
[50]. Similarly, in the pierid Pieris rapae, the blue opsin
copy (B), which encodes a 450 nm visual pigment [51]
evolved slower than the violet copy (V), which encodes a
more unusual 425 nm pigment, but this result was not significant either. Among the duplicated LWRh genes, significantly different rates of evolution were observed where
Bombyx mori LWRh2 evolved slower than B. mori LWRh1,
Papilio LWRh2 evolved slower than both Papilio LWRh1
and Papilio LWRh3, and Apodemia mormo LWRh1 evolved
slower than A. mormo LWRh2 (Table 1). Here too, the
slowest evolving Papilio LWRh2 encodes a pigment that
with a max at 520 nm is functionally more similar to other
butterfly long-wavelength sensitive visual pigments in its
wavelength of peak absorbance than the pigment encoded
by Papilio LWRh3 (max = 575 nm), similarly, the slower
evolving Apodemia LWRh1 encodes a pigment that with a
slightly blue-shifted max at 505 nm is much more typical
of other butterfly pigments than its faster evolving LWRh2
copy that encodes a pigment with the highly atypical max
at 600 nm [6,54]. Given that the relative rates tests seem
able to classify the slowest and fastest evolving gene copies in a way that also roughly reflected their function, with
the slowest evolving copies having spectral properties falling in a more narrow, similar and presumably ancestral
range than the fastest evolving copies, we decided to
divide our data for further analysis (see below) into alignments which included the slowest or fastest evolving copies.

P-values of gene pairs evolving at different rates are shown in bold.

For phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation,
we also obtained EF-1  and COI for individual taxa
where such sequences were not already available in GenBank. A total of 66 new gene sequences, including 38
opsin genes, 15 EF-1 and 13 COI sequences, are reported
in this study (See Additional File 2). Accession numbers
for all new sequences and those downloaded from GenBank are shown in Additional File 1. The combined data
set consisted of a total of 5523 bp, of which 1158, 1156,
1164, 1066 and 982 bp, belonged to the UVRh, BRh,
LWRh, EF-1 and COI genes respectively.
Maximum parsimony analysis recovers a single tree for
butterflies
Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis of all five genes using
the slowest evolving opsin duplicates identified by the relative rates test resulted in a single tree (Figure 1, Additional File 1) with a topology congruent with that inferred
in a previous study from molecular and morphological
data [42]. Re-running this analysis using the faster evolving gene copies also revealed the same topology. As traditionally recognized, Papilionidae is placed as sister to
(Pieridae + (Nymphalidae + (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae))).
The relationships recovered within Nymphalidae also correspond to the current consensus, which groups Limenitidinae with Heliconiinae and Nymphalinae as sister to
the previous two, Satyrinae as sister to (Nymphalinae +
(Limenitidinae + Heliconiinae)) and Danainae as the
basal subfamily, sister to (Satyrinae + (Nymphalinae +
(Limenitidinae + Heliconiinae))). Within Lycaenidae, the
Theclinae clade, represented by the hairstreak Satyrium

behrii, groups together with the Lycaeninae, and these two
clades are sister to the Polyommatinae.
Dissecting the contribution of different genes to this topological hypothesis through partitioned analysis reveals
that the LWRh gene provides the strongest support to the
topology, followed by the BRh, UVRh, EF-1 and COI
genes (Table 2). This holds true for both combined analyses which included slower and faster gene copies of duplicate genes. Using the slower evolving copies we can see
that both LWRh and BRh support all nodes, as shown by
positive partitioned Bremer support values, whereas the
information provided by UVRh, EF-1 and COI conflicts
with one or more nodes. The UV opsin data strongly
renders the grouping of both (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae),
and (Nymphalidae + (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae)) spurious, and also does not support the monophyly of Satyrinae. EF-1 does not recover the (Lycaeninae + Theclinae)
clade, but it does not take many steps to retrieve it (partitioned Bremer support -2, Table 2). COI conflicts with 10
out of the 26 total nodes, resulting in many negative support values (Table 2). This is not surprising since it has
long been recognized that its fast rate of evolution renders
COI of limited use when reconstructing phylogenetic history at levels deeper than species [33,55].
The Bremer support values rendered by the analysis of the
combined data set using faster evolving gene copies are
qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the values of the
slower evolving copies in most cases (Table 2). A few
exceptions occur at basal nodes in the tree, where using

values for these gene partitions approach zero in both
slow and fast gene copy analyses of these nodes.

the faster evolving copy of duplicated genes eliminates the

most basal of the Nymphalidae (node 23, Figure 1 and

group to (Nymphalidae + (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae))(node 25), the support of COI for the node consisting of Vanessa + Nymphalis (node 19), and adds the
positive support of COI to Papilionidae as sister to (Pieridae + (Nymphalidae + (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae))) (node
26). However, these qualitative differences are not quantitatively important since the individual Bremer support

One possible reason for the poor performance of the
UVRh gene in our data set is that there may be duplicate
copies, especially at deeper nodes in the phylogeny, which
we have not yet identified in these species that are missing
from our analysis. When searching for opsins by screening
cDNAs as we have done in the current study, it is difficult
to know when to stop because there is far less functional
data on the UV class of photoreceptor than either the blue
or the long wavelength. This apparently messy result is
interesting because it suggests we should continue to look
harder. By contrast, for the BRh and LWRh genes, we think
we have identified all but one of the duplicates in the species represented and so this may have contributed to their
striking performance (but see below).
Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses
concur
To ensure that the good performance of the BRh and
LWRh opsins and the poorer performance of the UVRh
opsin was not an artifact of the tree reconstruction
method we also performed maximum likelihood (ML)
and Bayesian analysis of the data. Maximum likelihood
and Bayesian analysis of the LWRh data set as well as the
all opsins, all nuclear, all genes data sets using slower and
faster evolving opsin copies resulted in identical, strongly
supported topologies (Figure 2A and 2D, Additional Files
3 and 4) congruent with that obtained in our combined
MP analyses (Figure 1), and with the inferred phylogenetic hypothesis of Wahlberg et al. (2005). The BRh gene
rendered a nearly identical topology, with the only exception being an unresolved node joining the nymphalid
subfamilies Satyrinae, Nymphalinae and Limenitidinae +
Heliconiinae (Figure 2C, Additional File 3). In contrast,
the UVRh, EF-1 and COI genes rendered non-traditional
groupings with various degrees of bootstrap support (Figure 2B, 2E, 2F, Additional File 3).

We also calculated using MrBayes a rate multiplier parameter (m) that reports relative substitution rate differences
between partitions [4,56], which can vary widely between
genes. As shown in Figure 3, rates of change for opsin
genes are intermediate between fast evolving COI and
comparatively slow evolving EF-1, which can account for
the strong phylogenetic signal contained by the LWRh and
BRh genes at the hierarchical levels under examination in
this study. On the other hand, the relatively lower performance of the UVRh is somewhat puzzling because its m
falls in between that of the two other opsins.
Interestingly, of all 6 gene duplications included in our
data sets (independent BRh duplications in Lycaenidae
and Pieridae, two LWRh duplications in Papilio plus one

Values represent support as calculated using data sets containing slower/faster evolving gene copies. Only one number is displayed when both
analyses rendered the same value.

LWRh duplication in Bombyx mori and one in Apodemia
mormo), only one results in different groupings depending
on which copy is utilized. Including BRh1 in the analysis
resulted in the grouping of Satyrium behrii with the
Lycaeninae under both maximum likelihood (93% bootstrap support, Additional File 3) and Bayesian analysis
(Figure 2C), whereas using BRh2 creates either a polytomy
of the three lycaenid subfamilies when employing ML
(Additional File 3), or the grouping of Theclinae with
Polyommatinae under a Bayesian framework (Figure 2C).
Wahlberg and Wheat [4] included a heat shock protein
gene HSP70 in their initial study, and the resulting highly
supported polyphyly of major lineages was blamed on the
paralogy of heat shock protein genes. We note that it is
highly likely that we would have had similar difficulties
(i.e. either polyphyly or inappropriately clustered taxa)
with a less complete sampling of paralogous genes in the
current study. Such effects have been extensively documented elsewhere [3,57,58].
Regardless of the phylogenetic reconstruction method
used, we found overwhelming support of a single phylogenetic hypothesis. Both the LWRh and BRh genes, as well

as combined analyses of all opsin genes, all nuclear genes
and all 5 genes rendered essentially the same tree topology, which also mirrors the current phylogenetic hypothesis for butterflies proposed by Wahlberg et al. [42] based
on three genes (COI, EF-1 and wingless) and 99 morphological characters. Of the genes used in the above-mentioned study, EF-1 provided the strongest support to the
topology, while COI the weakest (Table 2[42]). In their
case, the addition of morphological data was crucial to
elucidate many higher-level nodes, whereas in our study
LWRh and BRh individually and in combination with
other genes was sufficient to achieve this goal.
Divergence time estimates using duplicate gene copies are
similar at shallow nodes
To estimate divergence times we used two different
relaxed clock methods and the same calibration points on
the phylogenetic hypothesis shown in Figure 1. First we
employed a semi-parametric rate smoothing penalized
likelihood method [27], and second, we used a Bayesian
approach [28]. We note that this is the first study of butterfly divergence times employing both methods. For calibration we used two fossils as well as a biogeographic
event to constrain three nodes. The most recent common

Topologies
Topologies obtained from Bayesian analyses of combined and individual gene data. Numbers above and below
branches represent clade support as posterior probabilities. Nodes with posterior probabilities below 0.5 are showed as polytomies. Branch lengths are shown as average substitutions per site. (A) An identical topology was obtained using the slower
evolving copies of duplicated genes with numbers corresponding to posterior probabilities obtained from the all opsins/all
nuclear/all genes datasets respectively. Only one support value is shown for clades in which all three data sets result in the
same value. Traditional butterfly families are represented by the following colors: Papilionidae (green), Pieridae (yellow), Nymphalidae (red), Riodinidae (purple) and Lycaenidae (blue). (B-F) Bayesian topologies obtained for individual genes: (B) UVRh, (C)
BRh, (D) LWRh, (E) EF-1, (F) COI. Satyrium behrii is marked light green in the BRh gene tree to show how the two gene copies
group with different lycaenid subfamilies. The six duplication events that generated the duplicated genes included in this study
are indicated by black arrows.

ancestors of Vanessa cardui and Nymphalis antiopa (node
19, Figure 1), and of Pieris rapae and Colias philodice (node
2) were constrained to a minimum age of 34 Mya based
on the Florissant fossils Vanessa amerindica [34,59] and
Stolopsyche libytheoides [33,60], respectively, whereas the

split between the Neartic Papilio glaucus and the Paleartic
P. xuthus (node 1) was constrained between 35 and 65
mya, based on the breakage of the super continent Laurasia [61-63].

Bayesian estimates of rate multiplier parameter (m)
by gene partition using the slow gene data set.

Under the Bayesian approach, three priors also need to be
established, namely, the age of the root (node 26, Figure
1), the rate of evolution in substitutions per site per million years, and the variation of the rate of evolution over
time, also called brownmean [28]. We selected 70 and
100 Ma as priors for the age of the ingroup node to reflect

recent competing hypotheses for the origin of butterflies.
Our 70 Ma prior follows the hypothesis of early butterfly
diversification near the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary (K/
T, 65 Mya, [29]), and the 100 Ma prior reflects a conservative approach to a second hypothesis locating this event
sometime in the Cretaceous, roughly following the early
diversification of angiosperms 140 Mya [64]. Both the
mass extinction of terrestrial vertebrates following the
impact of a large meteor off the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico defining the K/T boundary, and the rise of the
angiosperms as dominant terrestrial plants had enormous
evolutionary consequences, providing likely scenarios for
the origin and diversification of insect taxa.
In general penalized likelihood (Additional File 5)
reported older estimates than Bayesian analyses (Table 3,
Additional Files 6 and 7), and the older the node the
larger the difference between estimates obtained through
the two methods and between estimates calculated using
the slower and faster copies of duplicated genes. This is
especially dramatic when we compare the estimates for
when the oldest butterfly family, Papilionidae, is inferred
to have first appeared (node 26). The penalized likelihood estimate using the slower evolving gene duplicates
is much older (240.4 Mya) than the penalized likelihood

Estimates were calculated using combined data sets including slow and fast evolving opsin copies. These results were obtained using a prior
distribution for the age of the ingroup node (root age) of either 70 (± 70) or 100 (± 100) Ma, a rate of evolution of 0.002 substitutions per site per
million years and brownmean value of 0.02.

estimate using the fast evolving gene copy (210.9 Mya)
(Additional File 5), and both estimates are together older
than those obtained using the Bayesian method, 113.1–
197.4 Mya (95% confidence interval) for the slower evolving copies vs. 132.5–216.2 Mya for the faster evolving
copies. It is important to note that the use of the three
shallow level calibration points available under the
restrictions of our data set constitutes a likely source of
variation in our divergence time estimates, especially at
deep nodes very distant in time from the calibrated nodes
[65], so all of these estimates should be viewed with caution (See [18]).
The Bayesian analyses performed on combined data sets
containing slower evolving copies of duplicated genes
rendered younger estimates, and therefore more conservative estimates than the analyses of combined data sets
including faster evolving gene copies or the analyses using
penalized likelihood (Figure 4, Additional File 8). Since
the effect of the priors employed in the analyses is small,
and the choice of a root age of 70 and 100 Ma did not
seem to have much of an impact on divergence dates
(Table 3) the rest of this discussion will be based on the
divergence times estimated using the slower evolving copies, our preferred rate and brownmean priors (0.002,
0.02, respectively) and our most conservative root age
prior of 70 Ma (see methods section).
Our results indicate that the Papilionidae diverged from
the ancestor of all the other butterfly families combined
sometime between 113.1–197.4 Mya (95% confidence
interval) using the slowest evolving copies of duplicated
genes (node 26, Table 3). These results are compatible
with other studies focused on divergences of younger lineages within the family. Zakharov and collaborators suggest for instance the ancestor of Papilio diverged from the
Tribe Troidini up to 100 Mya [63] while Braby et al.,
(2005)[32] propose a minimum age of 90 Ma for the first
diversification within Troidini. We also note that two
other studies [35,63] using similar calibration constraints
as our study, timed the major divergences within the
papilionid genus Papilio as occurring around 57.9 (37.8–
78.0) and 57.9 (43.0–72.8) Mya, respectively, which is
comparable with our estimated divergence of the lineages
leading to P. glaucus and P. xuthus between 47.2–64.8 Mya
(node 1, Table 3).
We estimate the split of Pieridae, the next oldest butterfly
lineage to have evolved, from the ancestor of (Nymphalidae + (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae)) to be situated between
101.1–170.0 Mya (node 25, Table 3), a result consistent
with Wheat et al. [36] who estimated this split to have
occurred between 79 and 166 Mya. Similarly, Braby et al.,
(2006) [33] estimated the subtribes Pierina and Aporiina
to have diverged 58 Mya, and from this result extrapolated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/99

an average age for the crown group of the Pieridae of 95
Ma (99.9% confidence interval between 82 and 112 Mya).
At the subfamily level, our results situate the split between
Pierinae and Coliadinae (node 2, Table 3) in the Pieridae
between 56.4–94.1 Mya, which is consistent with the
results of Wheat et al., (2007) [36], who, using distance
methods on the EF-1 and COI genes alone, estimate this
divergence is between 62 and 96 Mya.
For the youngest butterfly families, the most recent common ancestor of Nymphalidae and (Lycaenidae + Riodinidae) (node 24, Table 3), is located by our analyses at a
minimum age between 93.3–152.7 Mya, and the split
between Lycaenidae and Riodinidae (node 9, Table 3) at
83.6–135.1 Mya. Estimates for the origins of subfamilies
within the Lycaenidae (Theclinae, Lycaeninae and Polyommatinae) and Nymphalidae (Danainae, Limenitidinae,
Nymphalinae, Heliconiinae, and Satyrinae) are shown in
Table 3. Wahlberg (2006) [34] suggests that the nymphalid subfamily Nymphalinae was already present the
Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary, 65 Mya. In our data set, the
first split within Nymphalinae (node 20, Table 3) occurs
between 52.2–75.3 Mya, which is concordant with Wahlberg's estimate. We note too that Peña and Wahlberg
(2008) [37] estimated the split between Satyrinae and the
closely related subfamily Calinaginae (missing from our
data set), to have occurred 80.5 ± 4.9 Mya. Though not
directly comparable, this result is compatible with our
estimated age 78.8–123.8 Mya for the divergence of
Satyrinae from its more distantly related subfamilies
(Nymphalinae + (Limenitidinae + Heliconiinae))(node
22).
On the other hand, Monteiro and Pierce (2001), using a
mitochondrial gene molecular clock estimated the origin
of the satyrine genus Bicyclus between 15 and 20 Mya, and
the split of the subtribe to which it belongs (Mycalesina:
Satyrini) from the subtribe to which Coenonympha belongs
(Coenonymphina: Satyrini) at roughly 35 Mya (extrapolated from Figure 1, [37]). This last estimate is much
younger than our estimation for the split between Bicyclus
and (Coenonympha + (Neominois + Oeneis)) which we find
between 58.6–93.3 Mya (node 13, Table 3). This discrepancy may be partly due to the currently unresolved polytomies that plague the Satyrini tribe [66].
The only divergence time estimate existent for species in
the widely studied nymphalid genus Danaus, to which the
famed monarch butterfly belongs (D. plexippus), corresponds to the divergence between the sister species D.
plexippus and D. erippus, which based on molecular clock
estimates are suggested to have split about 2 Mya [67].
Our analyses situate the split between the less closely
related D. plexippus and the queen butterfly D. gilippus,
between 15–35 Mya (node 10). As expected based on its

Divergence time estimates using the Bayesian method on the slow copy combined data set
Divergence time estimates using the Bayesian method on the slow copy combined data set. Estimations were
performed using the combined five gene data set using priors of age of ingroup node = 70 Ma, rtrate = 0.002 substitutions per
site per million years and brownmean = 0.02. For each estimate 95% confidence intervals are shown in grey. Green bar indicates the major period during which flowering plants diversified, 90–115 Mya [72]. The lower bounds for the 95% confidence
intervals for the lineages leading to all butterfly families falls within or after this period.

position in the butterfly phylogeny, the scientifically conspicuous Danainae originated prior to the Limenitidinae
(Table 3), which contains the palatable species Limenitis
archippus, co-mimic of both the monarch and queen butterflies. We estimated the divergence between the North
American L. archippus archippus and L. arthemis astyanax
(the red spotted purple, which is a palatable mimic of the
papilionid Battus philenor)(node 17), to have occurred
between 4.7–13.6 Mya. This result conflicts with a previous estimate of the colonization of the Nearctic by the
genus Limenitis, situated at about 4 Mya by a molecular
clock calculation but recognized by the author to be based
on a crude divergence rate percentage [68], but is compatible with the postulated Laurasian origin of the genus
Limenitis and the Bering land bridges that connected Asia
with North America in the late Miocene (11.608 ± 0.005
to 5.332 ± 0.005 Mya) [69].
Another taxon famous for its astounding mimicry complexes is the nymphalid genus Heliconius, for which, surprisingly, only two estimates of divergence times exist in
the literature; for intraspecific or more-closely related species in Heliconius than those included in our study. Based
on arthropod mitochondrial gene evolution rates, Brower
found the first split within H. erato and H. melpomene to
have occurred between 1.5 and 2 Mya [70], whereas Kronforst (2008)[71], using the same method, dated the split
between the closely related Heliconius melpomene/cydno
and silvaniform clades, which excludes H. erato, at 2.5
Mya. Our study includes H. melpomene and H. erato, members of branches representative of the first divergence
within the genus, and estimates their split between 12.3–
25.3 Mya (node 14).
Did butterflies diversify in the age of angiosperms?
Butterflies are phytophagous feeders as adults and larvae
on the flowering plants or angiosperms. Using all fossil
evidence, including leaves, flowers, wood and pollen, the
major angiosperm radiation is estimated to have occurred
90–115 Mya (Figure 4 and Additional File 8) [72]. In light
of this information, the molecular timescale estimates we
have presented that seem most reasonable for the butterflies are the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals
for the slow evolving data set (Table 3). Considering the
lower bounds, our data suggest that diversification of the
lineages leading to the five butterfly families was completed sometime after the angiosperm radiation, ~84 Mya.

Conclusion
Our results suggest the use of LWRh and BRh opsins in
resolving both lower and higher level phylogenetic relationships in butterflies and suggest they may help to
resolve relationships and divergence times estimates
between even larger and more complex groups such as the
moths. One possible reason for the unusually good per-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/99

formance of LWRh and BRh opsins may be due to the fact
that we sampled highly expressed transcripts, which may
bias the sample towards copies that for structural reasons
are evolving under independent trajectories. It is very
likely that if we had targeted genomic DNA, then we
would have been more likely to pick up the kinds of duplicate opsin genes that are to be avoided for phylogenetic
purposes, e.g., tandemly repeated copies undergoing gene
conversion.
Another possibility is in the way we have handled this
data. We propose that phylogenomic studies might usefully include duplicate gene copies for phylogenetic analysis if relative rates tests are first used to identify slow and
fast evolving copies. In our data set where the spectral
properties of some of the visual pigments encoded by
duplicate copies are known, this simple procedure
brought together a collection of genes in the slow category
whose ancestral function has been retained and whose
patterns of molecular evolution may have been conducive
to phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence times estimation. Even for genes where no functional information
is known a similar procedure may help, though of course
this suggestion would best be implemented after further
validation using genes with a range of other functions
besides the visual pigments.
As several previous studies on butterfly family and subfamily divergence times have suggested, so too do our
results support an origin of butterflies older than the 70
Ma advocated by Vane-Wright [29] and others, regardless
of the absence of butterfly fossils older than Eocene ages.
The present study, using a set of genes that includes
opsins, which have not been used previously in butterfly
divergence time estimations, reaches the same conclusion:
the origin of butterflies surpasses with ample margin the
Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary by at least 20 Ma.

Methods
Tissue Collection
Most butterflies were included based on initial studies,
which indicated the potential utility of the LWRh gene for
reconstructing family and subfamily-level relationships
[6], and the availability of fossil and/or biogeographical
calibration points (See discussion). These butterfly taxa
were resampled (this study) for their UVRh, BRh, EF-1
and COI sequences. Other species were included because
they are currently being developed as model systems in
butterfly ecology and evolutionary biology. All specimens
were collected as adults in the field and immediately
placed in RNALater (Applied BioSystems/Ambion, Austin, TX) or freshly frozen (Euphydryas chalcedona, Speyeria
mormonia, Satyrium behrii and Agriades glandon, Mono
County, CA; Agraulis vanillae, Huntington Beach, CA;

PCR, Cloning, and Sequencing
For E. chalcedona, N. antiopa, H. erato, A. vanillae, S. mormonia, C. tullia, N. ridingsii, L. heteronea, L. helloides, L.
nivalis, A. mormo, L. arthemis astyanax, L. archippus archippus, D. gilippus, H. melpomene, O. chryxus, S. behrii, A. glandon and C. philodice, total RNA was extracted from one
head with Trizol (GibcoBRL), and cDNA synthesized
using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA). The cDNA was
then utilized in 3' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA
ends) PCR (BD Adv 2 Polymerase Mix) with, in the case of
opsin genes, the adaptor primer AP1 and an arthropod
opsin-specific degenerate primer (5'-GAA CAR GCW AAR
AAR ATG A -3'). PCR products were gel purified (Geneclean kit, QBioGene), incubated for 10 min at 72°C with
0.5 l Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) to add A-overhangs, cloned into pGem T-easy vector systems (Promega,
Madison WI) and sequenced (BigDye® Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems) at the University of California, Irvine DNA core sequencing facilities.
Duplicate gene transcripts were obtained by performing
multi-plex PCR on additional clones to identify templates
that did not amplify with the opsins picked up in this initial procedure. To obtain complete UVRh, BRh and LWRh
opsin sequences, gene specific reverse primers were
designed from the fragments and used to amplify the 5'
RACE products (Additional File 9).

From these cDNAs we also amplified fragments of the
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene
from H. erato and S. mormonia and the nuclear elongation
factor 1 alpha (EF-1) gene from H. erato, S. mormonia, O.
chryxus, S. behrii, A. glandon and A. mormo using the primers mRon (5'- GGR GCH CCH GAT ATA GCH TTY CC -3')
and mHobbes (5'-AAA TGT TGD GGN AAA AAD GTT A3') for COI modified from Monteiro and Pierce (2001),
and EF44(f) (5'-GCY GAR CGY GAR CGT GGT ATY AC-3')
and EFrcM4(r) (5'-ACA GCV ACK GTY TGY CTC ATR TC3') for EF-1 [73].

Standard phenol:chlorophorm extraction of genomic
DNA was performed on one individual adult per species
from L. arthemis astyanax, L. archippus archippus, D. plexippus, D. gilippus, H. melpomene, O. chryxus, L. rubidus, S.
behrii, A. glandon, P. icarus, and C. philodice. From these
pools of genomic DNA we obtained the COI and EF-1
genes from D. plexippus, D. gilippus, H. melpomene, L.
rubidus, and C. philodice; the COI gene from O. chryxus, S.
behrii, A. glandon and P. icarus; and the EF-1 gene from L.
arthemis astyanax and L. archippus archippus using the primers described above.
Phylogenetic Analysis
For each gene we aligned our sequences and others
obtained from GenBank (Additional File 1) using MEGA
3.1 [74] and by hand. Besides the 5 individual gene data
sets, we constructed 3 concatenated data sets combining
all 3 opsin genes (UVRh + BRh + LWRh), all 4 nuclear
genes (UVRh + BRh + LWRh + EF-1) and all 5 genes
(UVRh + BRh + LWRh + EF-1 + COI), respectively.
Because not all sampled taxa possess the same duplications, to prepare these concatenated data sets we first
chose which copies of the duplicated genes to use in the
alignments (Additional File 2). We chose by comparing
the rate of evolution of different paralogous gene pairs
using the relative rate tests as implemented in MEGA 3.1
and selecting for a first round of analyses the slowest
evolving copy for inclusion (except in the case of the
pierid blue opsin gene duplication, in which we chose for
all analyses the V (violet) opsin gene, due to the absence
of C. philodice BRh gene from our data set). The resulting
nucleotide alignments were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships by maximum-parsimony (MP), maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. We then
repeated all 3 concatenated analyses on a second set of
alignments, this time including the faster evolving paralogous copies of duplicated genes. We rooted our trees with
two moth species, the sphingid Manduca sexta and the
bombycid silkworm Bombyx mori. See Additional File 1 for
GenBank numbers of sequences included in slow vs. fast
data sets.

The incongruence length difference (ILD) test [75] implemented as partition homogeneity test in PAUP 4.0 for
assessing incongruence between character sets showed
that the three opsin gene partitions are congruent regardless of whether slower (P = 0.057) or faster (P=0.191)
evolving copies are used, but the addition of EF-1 and
EF-1 + COI to the opsin data results in incongruent data
sets in which the different partitions are evolving nonhomogeneously (P < 0.001 for both slower/faster data sets
for both combinations). Since the utility of the ILD test
has been challenged [76], however, we analyzed the data
partitioned (by gene) and un-partitioned. Maximum parsimony analyses were run using heuristic searches, tree

bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm
with gaps treated as missing data and all characters
equally weighted in PAUP 4.0 [77]. Clade robustness was
evaluated using decay indexes (Bremer support values)
using PAUP 4.0 and TreeRot [78]. Partitioned Bremer support (PBS) values were also calculated to determine the
relative contribution of the 5 gene partitions to the total
Bremer support of the combined, un-partitioned analysis.
For all data sets, including individual and concatenated
gene sequences, the optimal nucleotide substitution
model chosen by Modeltest was the most complex available to date: GTR with proportion of invariant sites (I) and
gamma-distributed rates (G). Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted in PHYML online web server [79,80]
for all 8 data sets and the reliability of the trees obtained
was tested by 500 bootstrap replicates. The optimal DNA
substitution model for each data set was determined by
nested likelihood ratio tests as implemented in Modeltest
3.7 [81]. The GTR + I + G (general time reversible plus proportion of invariant sites and gamma-distributed rates for
sites) substitution model was selected in every case. Proportion of invariant sites and gamma shape parameters
were estimated in PAUP 4.0.
As for the Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction method,
we chose the GTR + I + G model of nucleotide evolution
for all 8 data sets, where the proportion of invariant sites
and the shape of the gamma parameter were estimated for
each gene or partition employed. Bayesian analyses were
performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 [82] on all 8 unpartitioned data sets, and repeated with the all genes data set
under 2 partitioning schemes: by gene (5 partitions) and
by gene and codon position (5 genes × 3 positions = 15
partitions) under the same model selected for ML analyses
(GTR+I+G). In a partitioned analysis the model parameters (in this case, I and G) are calculated separately for
each partition. For each data set, slow and fast, 4 chains, 3
heated and 1 cold, were run simultaneously for 4 × 106
generations sampled every 100th generation. The first
20000 trees were discarded as burn-in samples. The
remaining trees were used to generate a majority rule consensus tree, in which the percentage of samples recovering
a particular clade represents its support measured as posterior probabilities. Resulting tree files were inspected in
Tree View [83]

lowest cross validation scores. We found this smoothing
parameter to be 3.2 for both slow and fast data sets. Using
this value and branch lengths estimated by maximum
likelihood in PHYML we repeated the analysis and estimated the divergence ages presented in Additional File 5.
For the Bayesian analysis, the rate of evolution prior was
selected based on the root to tip median branch length of
our slow and fast trees, a proxy advocated by Thorne and
Kishino (2002) [28] and explained in detail by Wiegmann
et al., (2003)[84]. These branch lengths were calculated
using the GTR + I + G ML model of evolution in PAUP 4.0.
For both slow and fast data sets the median branch length,
divided by the prior of root age resulted in a value
between 0.003 and 0.005 depending on the root age
prior; therefore for our preferred estimates we utilized a
prior of 0.002 ± 0.002 (standard deviation). The prior for
the variation in the rate of evolution over time (brownmean) was set to 0.02 ± 0.02 based on the empirical suggestion of [28] and [84], which states that a preferred
brownmean multiplied by the root age prior should result
in a number between 1 and 2. Large standard deviations
were chosen for all priors to increase the flexibility of our
analyses considering the lack of detailed information
about the actual divergence times and rates of evolution of
butterflies.
Under the Bayesian framework, and for both slower and
faster data sets we performed analyses using all 18 permutations of prior values, which included a prior distribution
for age of the ingroup node of either 70 (± 70) or 100 (±
100) Mya, a prior for the rate of molecular evolution of
either 0.02 ± 0.02, 0.002 ± 0.002 or 0.0002 ± 0.0002, and
a prior for the variation of the rate of evolution over time
(brownmean) of either 0.02 ± 0.02, 0.002 ± 0.002 or
0.0002 ± 0.0002. Parameters were sampled after a burn-in
period of 100,000 cycles, for an additional 1,000,000
cycles sampled every 100. Divergence time estimates were
calculated from these 10,000 samples.
