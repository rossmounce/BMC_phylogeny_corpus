Abstract
Background: Molecular clock dates, which place the origin of animal phyla deep in the
Precambrian, have been used to reject the hypothesis of a rapid evolutionary radiation of animal
phyla supported by the fossil record. One possible explanation of the discrepancy is the potential
for fast substitution rates early in the metazoan radiation. However, concerted rate variation,
occurring simultaneously in multiple lineages, cannot be detected by "clock tests", and so another
way to explore such variation is to look for correlated changes between rates and other biological
factors. Here we investigate two possible causes of fast early rates: change in average body size or
diversification rate of deep metazoan lineages.
Results: For nine genes for phylogenetically independent comparisons between 50 metazoan
phyla, orders, and classes, we find a significant correlation between average body size and rate of
molecular evolution of mitochondrial genes. The data also indicate that diversification rate may
have a positive effect on rates of mitochondrial molecular evolution.
Conclusion: If average body sizes were significantly smaller in the early history of the Metazoa,
and if rates of diversification were much higher, then it is possible that mitochondrial genes have
undergone a slow-down in evolutionary rate, which could affect date estimates made from these
genes.

Background
Dating the origin of the animal kingdom (Metazoa) has
been a long standing challenge in evolutionary biology,
and has important implications for our understanding of
macroevolutionary processes and the tempo and mode of
evolution [1,2]. One widely held view, the "Cambrian
explosion" hypothesis, is that the major groups of animals
diverged near-simultaneously during (or just before) the

early Cambrian period [3]. This hypothesis stems from
the sudden appearance of many metazoan phyla in the
fossil record in the early Cambrian (from 542 to 488 million years ago, Mya). For while some consider the Ediacaran fauna (approximately 600 to 542 Mya, however,
most Ediacaran organisms are between 565 and 541 million years old [4]) to be ancestral metazoans (e.g., [5,6])
and putative Precambrian bilaterian fossils have been

reported (e.g., refs. [7-10]), there are as yet no undisputed
bilaterian fossils in the Proterozoic [11] and the several
hypotheses that support the existence of Precambrian
bilaterians all seem to have some weaknesses (for a
review, see [12]). The apparently rapid evolution of the
major groups of animals in the early Cambrian has long
been considered a challenge to the universal application
of Darwinian gradualism [13].
Against this "Cambrian explosion" hypothesis, it has been
argued that limitations of the fossil record may have
obscured the earlier evolutionary history of the Metazoa
[2,14], and it therefore remains possible that the metazoan phyla arose not by an explosive radiation, but by a
long period of diversification [15]. Arguments for a Precambrian diversification of animal phyla have come from
many sources, including phylogenetic [16] and palaeoecological analyses [17], but one of the most consistent
lines of evidence has come from DNA sequence data.
Molecular clock studies have traditionally relied upon the
assumption that rates of molecular evolution are roughly
constant over time and between lineages, meaning that
genetic distance can be converted into an estimate of time
since divergence. Since the pioneering work of Runnegar
[18], many studies have used the assumption of constant
molecular rates to date metazoan origins. These studies
have produced a wide range of date estimates for the origin of bilaterians, with the date estimates for the split
between the protostomes and deuterostomes ranging
from 630 Mya [19] to 1200 Mya ([20]). Although all strict
molecular clock studies (i.e. based on a constant molecular rate) have placed the origin of bilaterians before the
first undisputed fossil evidence in the Cambrian, these
studies have been criticized for many reasons, particularly
because evidence suggests that rates of molecular evolution vary widely between different animal lineages
(e.g.,[21]).
In response to these criticisms, molecular dating methods
have now been developed that allow for variation in rate
of molecular evolution (for reviews see [22,23]). While
most rate-variable date estimates for the origins of major
animal lineages are much older than the earliest bilaterian
fossils (e.g. [24]), these methods have also produced
some dates that are considered more compatible with the
fossil evidence (Peterson et al. date the last common bilaterian ancestor between 573 and 656 Mya, [25]; Aris-Brosou and Yang date the deuterostome/protostome split on
average 582 ± 112 Mya, [26]). However, these very young
molecular estimates rely on procedures expected on external grounds to yield artefactually young dates. For example, some procedures include methods of branch length
estimation that are known to yield underestimates such as
parsimony or minimum evolution methods [27], maximum likelihood models that neglect between-site rate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/95

heterogeneity [28], or use Bayesian methods with strong
prior assumptions biased towards producing young date
estimates and fast early molecular rates [26,29,30]. Therefore, the conflict between molecular and palaeontological
dates for the origin of the animal phyla remains unresolved (for a review of this debate see [12]).
One possible explanation for the disagreement between
palaeontological and molecular estimates of animal origins would be if rates of molecular evolution were faster
in all or most bilaterian lineages at the base of Cambrian
[21,26]. But at this time, there is no molecular evidence
for higher rates of molecular evolution in the Cambrian.
One possible reason for this, is that such concerted
changes in rate (e.g. where many lineages increase in rate
at the same time) are a particular problem in molecular
dating studies. Although new dating methods allow autocorrelation between ancestral and descendant lineages,
they make no allowance for autocorrelation of rates
between descendant lineages. Moreover, such autocorrelated changes in rate between lineages cannot be identified by "clock tests" which aim to identify departures from
rate constancy [31]. Because concerted changes in rate
cannot be detected from branch length estimates, rate-variable molecular dating methods will only account for such
changes if they are incorporated into the estimation as
prior knowledge.
All molecular dating methods must specify some form of
prior assumptions about both divergence dates and
molecular rates. Variable-rate methods can only accommodate concerted changes in rate in two ways: through
the date prior or the rate prior. Rate-variable methods may
specify a date prior that allows a concerted rate change by
compressing or stretching all branches in part of the phylogeny. This can be achieved in one of two ways [22]:
using a model (such as a birth-death process) that
stretches portions of the tree, or via multiple calibrations
either side of the rate change. In practise, most rate-variable dating methods have taken these approaches. However, the use of evolutionary models to constrain ratevariable dates is problematic in that the assumptions
embodied in such methods (for example, birth and death
model of speciation), often do not adequately reflect the
biological systems being modelled. This is particularly
worrisome for some studies of the metazoan radiation,
where it can be shown that the assumptions of the models
are the main determinant for the young date estimates
[30]. The use of multiple calibrations as constraints on the
nodes of interest has the advantage of using empirical data
to constrain solutions. However it makes the rate-variable
date estimates highly dependent on external calibrations,
and prevents their use as a source of temporal information
that is independent of the fossil record (which is impor-

tant for testing hypotheses such as the Cambrian explosion).
Alternatively, variable-rate methods can specify a rate
prior that favours concerted changes. Again, this could be
done in one of two ways: by simply specifying a directionally biased model or by including additional information
that has been independently found to be associated with
a change in rates (e.g. a body size effect on molecular
rates). Some rate-variable methods have included directionally-biased models (e.g. [26]), in which case the
young date estimates are a result of the assumption of fast
early rates, not a test of this hypothesis. The use of independent rate priors to take into account concerted change
in rate-variable molecular dating has thus far never been
applied, and would rely upon identifying correlates of
molecular rate that may have varied systematically across
the phylogeny [22,32]. For example, if a life history trait
was found that correlated negatively with the rate of
molecular evolution, and if that trait could be shown to
have increased in most metazoan lineages since the Cambrian, then this might imply that rates were generally
faster in Cambrian. Faster rates in the Cambrian would
produce a consistent bias in molecular date estimates,
making molecular dates systematically overestimated
whatever method or data was used. This is the motivation
for the present study. In this paper, we investigate two
potential correlates of molecular rate variation that may,
in this way, help to explain the discrepancy between
molecular and fossil dates of the metazoan radiation.
The first potential correlate of molecular rate is body size.
It has been proposed that ancestral small size in metazoan
lineages would have increased rates of molecular evolution (see discussion in [21]). This theory is supported by
interpretations of the fossil record suggesting that the earliest metazoans were much smaller than extant species,
perhaps resembling modern meiofauna [33] or ciliated
metazoan larvae [34]. However alternative hypotheses
suggest the early presence of complex and large-bodied
metazoans [12]. The potential correlation between ancestral small size in metazoan and fast early rates is also supported by the observation of a negative relationship
between body size and rate of molecular evolution in several vertebrates clades, including birds [35], reptiles [36]
and mammals [37]. However, a recent study of invertebrates which used sequence data from 330 species from
five different phyla, found that, while rates of molecular
evolution varied significantly, there was no evidence that
rate scaled with body size [38]. However that analysis was
restricted to comparisons between species, genera and
families. It is possible that an influence of body size on
rates of molecular evolution in the early stages of animal
evolution will only be evident when extremely divergent
lineages are compared. It is therefore interesting to inves-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/95

tigate whether body size is associated with rate of molecular evolution at higher taxonomic levels (e.g. phylum,
class and order).
We also investigate a second potential correlate of variation in rate of molecular evolution: net diversification rate
(i.e. speciation rate minus extinction rate). The Cambrian
explosion hypothesis suggests that net diversification rate
may have been greatly inflated during the early metazoan
radiation [39]. A correlation between net diversification
rate and substitution rate has been observed in flowering
plants [40], and for a collection of 56 phylogenies including several phylogenies of metazoans [41]. Theory also
suggests that several speciation modes are expected to
result in an increase in substitution rate (see Discussion).
Here we use estimates of extant species number to represent the net diversification rate for the metazoan taxa.
In this study we use a phylogenetic comparative approach
to compare rates of molecular evolution between metazoan phyla, classes, orders and families [see Additional
file 1] that differ in taxon average body size and in species
number. We examine rates of molecular evolution in nine
different genes (including mitochondrial and nuclear,
protein- and RNA-coding genes). Our study shows strong
evidence for a negative correlation between substitution
rate and body size for the mitochondrial genes. There is
also some evidence of a positive correlation between substitution rate and net diversification rate for the mitochondrial genes. This implies that if the earliest
metazoans were much smaller than their modern
descendants, and/or if the net diversification rate was significantly higher, then it is possible that rates of mitochondrial molecular evolution could have been higher
during the early Cambrian. If this is true, then molecular
date estimates based on these sequences could systematically overestimate the date of origin of metazoan phyla.

Results
The relationship between body size and molecular rate in
mitochondrial genes
The mitochondrial sequences show clear evidence of a
negative association between body size and rate of molecular evolution (Table 1). The C20 concatenated alignment
shows a significant negative correlation under the two
partitions of the sequence data (Table 1; C20 shows also a
significant negative correlation under the "gene partitions
model" implemented in PAML, results not shown). This
observation is also supported at the individual gene level,
with two of the six mitochondrial genes showing significant correlations at the 5% level under the "No partition"
model (COII and NADH4), and four of the six showing
significant correlations at the 10% level under the "Codon
partitions" model (COII, COIII, cytB, NADH4). Furthermore, correlation coefficients for all alignments were neg-

ative, whether significant or not. This negative
relationship is also evident from scatterplots of the data
[see Additional file 2].
The relationship between net diversification rate and
molecular rate in mitochondrial genes
There is also evidence, albeit weaker, that the rate of
molecular evolution in mitochondrial genes is positively
correlated with clade size, which in this study is used to
represent net diversification rate. While this relationship
is only significant for a single gene (COIII: |rs| = 0.52; pvalue = 0.031), the coefficients are positive in all cases,
and the scatterplots confirm the positive trend [see Additional file 3]. It is interesting to note the tendency of the
mitochondrial genes to produce "polygonal plots" as
when the difference in species number is less than a factor
of two (i.e of 1 on our log2 scale), then the rate difference
is highly variable, whereas the relationship appears somewhat more obvious when the richness differences are
more dramatic. If this variation in rate contrast associated
with small differences in species number is due to a measurement error effect (i.e. error in estimation of species
number is expected to have a bigger impact on the small
contrasts), it could add noise to the observed correlation
and hide a stronger positive correlation between diversification rate and molecular rate.
Partial correlation test between molecular rate, body size
and net diversification rate in mitochondrial genes
Because the negative correlation observed between molecular rate and body size could be an indirect result of a relationship involving the net diversification rate, we

performed partial correlation tests which did not indicate
any evidence for any relationship involving molecular
rate, body size and net diversification rate together. However, the interpretation of these results is problematic for
data which departs from a normal distribution [42].
Moreover, consistent with the study by Orme et al. [43]
our data indicate no evidence for a relationship between
body size and net diversification rate (p-value~1, results
not shown); the inclusion of the corresponding non-significant correlation coefficient in the partial correlation
tests makes the interpretation of the results of such tests
difficult.
Study of correlates in nuclear genes
In contrast to the mitochondrial genes, the nuclear genes
do not show any significant relationship between molecular rate and either body size or net diversification rate.
The correlation coefficients vary in sign, and are often
close to zero (Table 1). The sole exception is the correlation between body size and substitution rate for ef1a
which, though non-significant, is close in magnitude to
those observed for the mitochondrial sequences.

Discussion
This study provides evidence that the rate of molecular
evolution in mitochondrial genes is negatively correlated
with body size for deep comparisons within the Metazoa.
We have confidence in this result for several reasons. First,
significant results were obtained for both concatenated
and single-gene sequences, despite the use of relatively
conservative non-parametric statistics. Second, all trends
were in the same direction (negatively correlated) whether

or not tests were significant (Table 1). Third, our results
are not confounded by evolutionary relationships
between sequences (a common problem in the study of
rates of molecular evolution), because we used phylogenetically independent comparisons, chosen from a phylogeny supported by several recent studies [24,44-47].
This result is in accordance with previous studies of rate of
molecular evolution in vertebrates [37]. However, it is in
contrast to that of Thomas et al. [38], which found no evidence of any body size effect over a wide range of invertebrate taxa. So why does this study find evidence of a
relationship in invertebrates, when the previous study did
not? The majority of data points in this study are comparisons between invertebrate taxa (see Figure 1), so the association is unlikely to be simply a result of the inclusion of
vertebrate comparisons (which were not included in Thomas et al. study). Furthermore, the two studies employ
very similar methodologies, comparable sequence data,
and overlapping taxonomic coverage. Importantly,
though, the comparisons in Thomas et al. are at a different
level of the metazoan phylogeny to those used in the
present study. Indeed, this study was designed to extend
that of Thomas et al., by sampling a part of the metazoan
phylogeny not included in the earlier study. This is an
important distinction, because the deeper comparisons
included in this study (phylum, order and class) are
potentially more relevant to the problem of molecular
dates for the metazoan radiation than the shallower comparisons made by Thomas et al. (species, genus and family).
There are several possible reasons why this difference in
comparison depth may be responsible for the different
results obtained by the two studies. The use of much
deeper comparisons may have increased the power of the
test in three ways. Firstly, the comparison pairs used here
have longer branch lengths. This means that every comparison samples more substitutions, which will have
increased the accuracy of the rate estimates (as long as the
data are not saturated). Secondly, the body size differences were typically much greater in the present work: the
comparisons used by Thomas et al. differed in body size
by a ratio of less than 8:1, whereas our comparisons have
an average body size ratio of 125:1 [see Additional file 4].
Thirdly, deeper comparisons may have greater resolving
power if they overcome confounding effects of unknown
variables, which may fluctuate over evolutionary time. For
example, a hidden causal variable might have masked the
effects of body size in shallow comparisons, if such a variable was fluctuating on timescales comparable to the
divergence times of species or genera.
In addition to differences in resolving power, it is possible
that the discrepancy between the two studies is a result of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/95

sampling different parts of metazoan diversity, and that
rates of molecular evolution really were affected by body
size in the lineages included in the present study, but not
in those sampled by Thomas et al. [38]. One possible difference between the datasets is that most of the phylogenies analysed by Thomas et al. contained exclusively
terrestrial invertebrates while most of the substitutions
measured in the current study will have taken place in a
marine environment (even for phyla with many living terrestrial representatives). It has been suggested that marine
organisms may have consistently different rates of molecular evolution due to, for example, larger effective population sizes [48] or a direct effect of salt concentration on
mutation rates [49].
A further possibility, and one that is relevant to the issue
of dating the metazoan radiation, is that the association
between body size and rates was more pronounced in the
early period of metazoan evolution. In this case, the effect
detected in this study might not be detected by studies of
more recent metazoan lineages. However, we know of no
reasons for such a temporal shift in the tempo and mode
of molecular evolution.
Providing plausible causal explanations for the body size
effect we have observed is greatly complicated by the fact
that so many life history traits, and other putative causal
variables, tend to covary with body size [37,50]. In particular, two variables that co-vary with body size have been
put forward as potential causes of variation in molecular
rates. Generation time may influence rates of molecular
evolution because organisms that copy their germline
DNA more often per unit time are expected to incur more
DNA replication errors, which could increase the mutation rate. [35,50]. Alternatively, metabolic rate may influence rates of DNA damage, through the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are by-products of
metabolism [51]. Indeed, it has been suggested that metabolic rate is the primary driver of rates of molecular evolution [50], linked to body mass through allometric
scaling, perhaps through a "3/4 power law" (for a review,
see [52]). However, the only studies that have explicitly
compared these two variables found no effect of metabolic rate on molecular rates above its covariation with
generation time and body size [35,37]. Because both metabolic rate and generation time may scale with body size
for many metazoan lineages [52-55], we are unable to test
which provides the better explanation for the pattern we
observe. However, it is possible that the metabolic rate
effect may provide an explanation for our observation of
a body size effect in mitochondrial genes but not in
nuclear genes. Because mitochondria are the site of production of ROS, it is possible that DNA damage from
metabolites accounts for a greater proportion of mutations in mitochondrial DNA than in nuclear DNA, poten-

tially explaining why we observe an effect in the
mitochondrial genes alone. Alternatively, it is possible
that metabolic rate might influence the rate of adaptation
of mitochondrial genes, thus potentially affecting the substitution rate [56]. However, a recent study found no association between metabolic rate and rate of molecular
evolution for a large metazoan dataset [57].
Alternatively, the failure to detect a body size pattern in
rates for nuclear genes may simply be an artefact of relative lack of power: the nuclear sequences typically contained fewer substitutions per branch than did the
mitochondrial sequences, reducing our ability to accurately measure the substitution rate, and so reducing the
power of the tests. It is also possible that the effect we have
detected applies chiefly to synonymous substitutions in
protein coding sequences. Such substitutions will dominate estimates of the overall rate in mitochondrial, but
not in nuclear genes, because the former tend to have a
much lower ratio of amino-acid-changing to synonymous
substitutions [56,58]. In support of this suggestion is the
observation that, in mammals, synonymous substitutions
show more evidence of lineage-specific rate variation than
do amino-acid-changing substitutions [59].
While the existence of a body size effect for deep metazoan comparisons is indicated relatively clearly by our
analysis, evidence for a species number effect is more
equivocal. Although a significant result was obtained only
for a single mitochondrial gene (COIII), the agreement of
the signs of the correlations across all of the mitochondrial genes, together with observation of the scatterplots
[see Additional file 3], tentatively suggest that rates of
mitochondrial evolution may increase with net diversification rate. These patterns are consistent with previous
empirical work that has found a correlation between
diversification rate and rate of molecular evolution
[40,41]. Net diversification rate is the result of addition of
lineages by speciation and removal of lineages by extinction. It is difficult to predict the influence of variation in
extinction rates on rates of molecular evolution, however
some theoretical models do predict a link between speciation and rate of molecular change, and it is possible that
this is the underlying cause of the relationship. For example, the population splitting involved in speciation
implies reduced effective population size (Ne) which
could increase the fraction of mutations that are effectively neutral (with 0 <Ne|s| < < 1) and therefore able to
reach fixation. (e.g., [60]). Speciation involving a founder
event [61] may involve an even more drastic reduction in
Ne. Alternatively, speciation involving adaptation to a
new niche, or runaway sexual selection, may generate
adaptive substitutions which could cause a detectable
increase in substitution rate. However, in contrast to the
genome-wide effects of a reduction in Ne, such adaptive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/95

scenarios would be likely to generate gene-specific patterns which are unlikely to have been detected by our
study, particularly because we have targeted "house-keeping genes" involved in basic cellular processes common to
all organisms (i.e. ribosomal RNAs and oxidative-chain
proteins). Another consideration is that divergence itself
can lead to speciation due to the accumulation of hybrid
incompatibilities (an idea developed in the BatesonDobzhansky-Muller model; [62,63]), and this applies
regardless of how the substitutions are caused (i.e.
whether they are drift-mediated or adaptive substitutions). While these direct causal explanations are certainly
possible, as with the body size effect, it is also possible
that we are observing an indirect relationship caused by a
hidden variable. For example, a recent study in flowering
plants suggests that environmental energy has strong
independent effects on both substitution rate and speciation rate [64].

Conclusion
We have shown that deep metazoan lineages differ systematically in rate of molecular evolution for mitochondrial genes. Importantly, our results suggest that if body
size, or possibly net diversification rate, have shown consistent trends during the radiation of the Metazoa, then it
is possible that many lineages could have undergone concerted changes in rate of molecular evolution. Such a concerted change could potentially confound attempts to
date the metazoan radiation using mitochondrial proteincoding genes, whether by traditional molecular clock
analyses or the more recent rate-variable methods.
Our results also suggest that molecular dates might be
overestimated when larger animals are over-represented
in the sampled taxa. Such a bias could apply even if the
body size of Metazoa has not systematically increased. It
is also important to note that our results apply only to
mitochondrial genes, yet Precambrian molecular dates
have predominantly been generated from nuclear gene
data.
However, our results do suggest that the search for biological correlates of molecular rates may uncover important
patterns that may be used to assess the reliability of
molecular dates, or develop new dating methods that can
incorporate prior knowledge of molecular evolutionary
rates. In particular, this study emphasizes the importance
of examining patterns of molecular evolution at different
"depths" in a phylogeny, as a pattern evident in deep comparisons may not be detectable for shallow pairs.

tion rate, we used the method of phylogenetically independent comparisons [65,66]. Such methods are
necessary due to the common ancestry of taxa, which
implies that measurements from different taxa are not statistically independent. Ignoring this fact means that the
same evolutionary history may be counted multiple
times, and this could generate a spurious association
between variables [66]. As such, we take as each datapoint
the proportional change in the chosen variables between
a pair of sister taxa. Each pair is chosen so as not to overlap
on the phylogeny with any other pair, ensuring that the
datapoints are statistically independent [37,38].
Choice of taxa
We collected data for 64 major taxa in the metazoan phylogeny (Table 2). Phylogenetically independent sister
pairs were chosen from these 64 using an assumed phylogeny (see Figure 1), constructed from multiple sources of
evidence from the literature (in particular from [24,4447]. Because aspects of metazoan phylogeny remain controversial, we avoided including taxa whose placement
varied between our sources. If aspects of this phylogeny
are found to be incorrect in future, we may have to revise
some data points, but we are confident that on the whole
we have been able to choose phylogenetically independent comparisons (Table 2). Because we have restricted the
analysis to sister pairs, divergence dates for the pairs were
not required. Deep phylogenetic uncertainties, such as the
position of the Mollusca, did not affect the choice of the
pairs. The comparison depth was chosen to optimize
DNA sequence availability and number of comparisons,
targeting lineages relevant to dating the Cambrian explosion.
Body size and net diversification rate data
To represent the variables of body size and net diversification rate, we used estimates of median adult biovolume
and extant species number presented in Orme et al. ([43]:
Table 1). In their study, biovolume (in mm3) was calculated for each taxon as the product of three linear dimensions – length, width and height – obtained from the
literature. For each linear dimension, the authors use the
median as a measure of central tendency, because of the
left skewed distribution of most of the taxa. For example,
for the Nemertea, the median length is 75 mm but the
arithmetic mean is 323 mm, largely because of the bootlace worm (Lineus longissimus) which can be up to 10
metres long. When one or two of these linear dimensions
were not available, Orme et al. extrapolated missing values from the available dimensions and the body form. Net
diversification rate (the net result of speciation and extinction for each taxon) is represented by the estimated
number of extant species described per taxon (here
referred to as "clade size"). When several estimates were
available and differed between sources, Orme et al. chose

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/95

the most recent estimates, or the estimates from studies
which focus on the particular taxa.
Substitution rate data
To estimate change in rate of molecular evolution for each
of our species pairs, DNA sequence data from one species
from each taxon was collected from GenBank ([67]; for
details of sequences and taxons, see Additional files 5 and
6). When several equally complete sequences were available for a taxon, one was chosen at random. Because
sequences of different types may show different patterns
of evolution, separate results are reported for six mitochondrial protein-coding genes (COI, COII, COIII, CytB,
NADH1, NADH2), a nuclear protein-coding gene (ef1a)
and two nuclear RNA-coding genes (18S, 28S). However,
not all genes were available for all taxa [for details of
sequences, species names and accessions numbers, see
Additional file 7].

The DNA sequences were automatically aligned using
ClustalW [68]. These alignments were manually refined
using BioEdit [69] and the unalignable parts excised:
between 11% and 70% of the original sequences were
removed depending on the gene [alignments are available
from the authors and for details of the excised part, see
Additional file 8]. In addition to analysing each gene separately, a concatenated alignment of the six mitochondrial
genes was generated, and if any taxon was missing a gene
it was replaced by gaps. Because some concatenated
sequences included a relatively high proportion of gaps
that might bias branch length estimation, in addition to
the complete concatenated alignment (C100), we generated a further alignment (C20) where pairs were removed
if they contained over 20% of missing sequence. Four
pairs were removed under this criterion [see Additional
file 9].
Fixing the phylogeny to the assumed relationships (see
Figure 1), we estimated branch lengths by maximum likelihood, using the BASEML software from PAML v3.15
[70]. For each sequence, we chose the HKY+Γ model of
DNA substitution, with parameter values estimated from
the data for each alignment. Because our phylogeny contained long terminal branches and shorter internal
branches, the use of a more parameter-rich model might
lead to overparametrization, which can bias branch
length estimates [71,72]. For the protein-coding
sequences, codon-based models could not be used, as our
phylogeny contains multiple genetic codes. However, for
these genes, separate results are reported for branch
lengths estimated under a partition of the data into the
three codon positions. For the concatenated alignment of
six mitochondrial genes, results are also reported for a partition in which each gene was assigned its own rate. The
computed values of the branch length estimates in each

pair of sister taxa are available in Additional files 5 and 6.
To estimate the proportional change in the rate of molecular evolution between a pair of sister taxa, we used the
ratio of their maximum likelihood branch lengths. Each
branch length is the product of a rate of evolution and a
divergence time, so for pairs of sister taxa which share the
same divergence time, time cancels from the estimate with
the use of the ratio.
Statistical tests
Because we cannot assume any particular distribution for
the error associated with the variables under study
(molecular rate, body size and clade size), we used the
non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation test to
explore their association. This test takes into account the
magnitude of the difference in each variable, but makes
no detailed assumptions about their associated error. The
tests were two-tailed, as we did not wish to assume the
direction of any potential association between rate and

traits. Tests were conducted using the programming language R [73], with PAML output initially formatted using
the phylogenetic package Ape [74] available for R.
The Spearman's rank correlation test was used to test for
associations between the relative substitution rate variable
and the biological traits variable (biovolume or clade
size). For each pair of taxa, the biological traits variable is
the ratio of the bigger over the smaller biological trait
value. The relative substitution rate variable was represented by the ratio BLBig /BLSmall where for a pair of taxa,
BLBig and BLSmall represent the branch lengths of the taxon
with, respectively, the larger and smaller values of the relevant trait (biovolume or species number).

Pairs used for each gene under analysis. Each sequence that represents
a taxon is reported together with its accession number from GenBank with
the species it came from. The 25 first pairs represent the original pairs chosen on the metazoan tree (see Figure 1). Because gene sequences are not
available for each pair, we chose additional phylogenetically independent
pairs for certain genes (pairs 26 to 29). The symbol "-" indicates that gene
sequences were not available for either one or both members of a comparison pair.
