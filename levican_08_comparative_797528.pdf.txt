Abstract
Background: Carbon and nitrogen fixation are essential pathways for autotrophic bacteria living
in extreme environments. These bacteria can use carbon dioxide directly from the air as their sole
carbon source and can use different sources of nitrogen such as ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, or even
nitrogen from the air. To have a better understanding of how these processes occur and to
determine how we can make them more efficient, a comparative genomic analysis of three
bioleaching bacteria isolated from mine sites in Chile was performed. This study demonstrated that
there are important differences in the carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation mechanisms among
bioleaching bacteria that coexist in mining environments.
Results: In this study, we probed that both Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Acidithiobacillus
thiooxidans incorporate CO2 via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle; however, the former bacterium
has two copies of the Rubisco type I gene whereas the latter has only one copy. In contrast, we
demonstrated that Leptospirillum ferriphilum utilizes the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for carbon
fixation. Although all the species analyzed in our study can incorporate ammonia by an ammonia
transporter, we demonstrated that Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans could also assimilate nitrate and
nitrite but only Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans could fix nitrogen directly from the air.
Conclusion: The current study utilized genomic and molecular evidence to verify carbon and
nitrogen fixation mechanisms for three bioleaching bacteria and provided an analysis of the
potential regulatory pathways and functional networks that control carbon and nitrogen fixation in
these microorganisms.

Background
The employment of microorganisms for metal recovery
from low-grade ores and mineral concentrates and secondary materials, has developed into a successful and
expanding area of biotechnology. In association with this
interest, microbial communities of extreme acidophilic
prokaryotes from bioleaching environments have long
been the subject of active research; however, the components and interactions within these microbial communities' remains poorly understood. Recent acquisition of
genomic data directly from organisms living in naturally
extreme environments [1-4] in combination with genome
sequencing projects of individual species [5,6] provides a
novel opportunity for prediction and exploration of the
metabolic details that control both individual microorganisms and microorganism communities.
Acidophilic prokaryotes involved in metal recovery from
sulfide minerals include members of the Bacteria and
Archaea domains. Three species of chemolithotrophic
bacteria are mainly involved: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans,
Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Leptospirillum sp., all of
which obtain energy primarily from iron and/or sulfur
oxidation. A. ferrooxidans is capable of oxidizing reduced
sulfur compounds and Fe2+ ions to form sulfate and Fe3+,
respectively [7-10]. A. thiooxidans can only oxidize
reduced sulfur compounds such as thiosulfate, tetrathionate, metal sulfides and elemental sulfur to form sulfate [79,11]. Leptospirillum sp. is solely capable of oxidizing Fe2+
ions to form Fe3+ [12]. These autotrophic microorganisms
utilize the energy and reducing power derived from iron
and/or sulfur oxidation for several metabolic processes,
including CO2 fixation and acquisition of several sources
of nitrogen. In both Acidithiobacillus species, CO2 fixation
occurs via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle [5,13,14]
whereas Leptospirillum sp. grows autotrophically; however
the molecular mechanisms involved in carbon fixation
remain obscure.
In acidic bioleaching environments, dissolved inorganic
carbon can reach levels below atmospheric concentrations average. Therefore, it is not surprising that CO2 concentrating mechanisms have been identified in
autotrophic prokaryotes present in such environments
[15,16]. In A. ferrooxidans (ATCC 23270), the presence of
carboxysomes has been inferred from genome annotation
[17], but the physiological role of this compartment and
characterization of global CO2 concentrating mechanisms
in bioleaching bacteria are yet to be determined.
Nitrogen plays an important role in the ecology of microbial communities. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in nitrogen fixation and
assimilation are critical to understand how microorganisms adapt themselves to changes in environmental nitro-

gen. Ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and glutamine are the
main nitrogen sources used by microorganisms in natural
environments. Under low nitrogen levels, diazotrophic
bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen under anaerobic or
microaerobic conditions through the action of the nitrogenase complex. Because reduction of N2 to ammonium is
an energy-demanding process and because the nitrogenase enzyme is very sensitive to oxygen, biological N2
reduction is a tightly regulated process [18,19].
The capability of microorganisms to fix atmospheric
nitrogen plays an important role in recycling scarce nitrogen existing in nutrient-poor acidic conditions; however,
the availability of nitrogen and the energy required for its
fixation may limit bacterial growth and adversely affect
the efficiency of bioleaching operations. The study of
nitrogen metabolism in members of microbial communities is therefore of both fundamental and applied interest.
In bioleaching communities N2 fixation has been predicted for A. ferrooxidans [5,20-22] and members of
groups I [23,4] and III [24] of the Leptospirillum genus.
Genomic analysis of these bacteria revealed the presence
of genes involved in N2 fixation (nif), ammonium transport (amt) and genes encoding the regulatory proteins
NtrC and NifA (specific activators of nif genes). Genes
encoding the regulatory PII protein, which plays a controlling role in the nitrogen metabolism coupled to the
central carbon metabolism [25,26], have also been identified.
Although carbon and nitrogen fixation has been predicted
for A. ferrooxidans and members of the Leptospirillum
genus, the physiology and regulation of these processes
are still poorly understood. Here we report a comparative
genomic analysis of the carbon and nitrogen metabolism
carried out on three sequenced bacterial genomes (A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans and Leptospirillum group II) isolated from naturally extreme environments in the north of
Chile.

Results and discussion
Molecular mechanisms involved in CO2 fixation
CO2 fixation by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle
CBB is composed of 13 enzymatic reactions, 12 of which
are involved in regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
(RuBP) and one of which is responsible for CO2 fixation
catalyzed by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). The key CO2 fixation enzymes in the
CBB cycle are Rubisco, Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and
Sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase (SBP) [27]. We
searched in the genomes of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans,
Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Leptospirillum ferriphilum
for genes encoding these CBB enzymes (See additional file
1: CarbAsilProts.csv for the list and sequence of these proteins). PRK and SBP genes were identified in the Acidithio-

bacillus strains as single copies but not in the Leptospirillum
strain. We identified canonical forms of Rubisco encoded
in the genomes of both Acidithiobacillus species inspected.
In A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, two gene copies encoding
Rubisco form I (cbbSL1 and cbbSL2) and one copy encoding Rubisco form II (cbbM) were identified, as described
previously [28], whereas in A. thiooxidans DSM 17318,
Rubisco forms I and II were each encoded by one gene.
The presence of multiple sets of genes for Rubisco is well
documented in the literature. For example, in Hydrogenovibrio marinus it has been proposed that the expression of
three Rubisco genes (two of form I and one of form II) is
dependent on the environmental CO2 concentration and
that there is an interactive regulation among these genes
[29]. It is interesting to note that both Acidithiobacillus
strains examined in this study contain a cbbR gene
upstream of the cbbSL1 and cbbM genes. CbbR is a positive
regulator of cbb operon that coordinates the expression of
three Rubisco genes [29-31]. It is likely that the presence
of multiple forms and gene copies of Rubisco and a controlled Rubisco expression system allow these bacteria to
rapidly respond to environmental changes in the CO2/O2
concentrations.

doreductase (OGOR) and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR) [34,35]. The presence of such enzymes
activities in autotrophically grown bacteria and archaea is
considered indicative of RTCA function. Inspection of the
Leptospirillum DSM 17947 genome showed the presence of
genes coding for all enzymes of the RTCA cycle, including
the four key enzymes (See additional file 1: CarbAsilProts.csv for the list and sequence of these proteins). All
RTCA cycle enzymes and reactions are depicted in the
metabolic scheme presented in Figure 1. The citric acid
cycle moving in the forward direction, in an oxidative
fashion, according to our genomic search, is unlikely,
because genes encoding for 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
were undetected. CO2 fixation mechanisms other than the
Calvin Cycle and RTCA cycles include the 3-hydroxypropionate and the reductive acetyl-CoA cycles [35]. No evidence of genes coding for the key enzymes of these two
pathways for carbon fixation was found in L. ferriphilum
DSM 17947.

In the Leptospirillum DSM17947 strain only the noncanonical Rubisco-like protein (RLP) was identified,
which is similar to Rubisco form IV of the photosynthetic
thermophilic purple sulfur bacteria Chromatium tepidum
[32]. RLP has not been demonstrated to catalyze CO2 fixation and therefore the enzyme may not take part in the
CBB cycle [33].

Genetic characterization of L. ferriphilum genes encoding
enzymes of the RTCA cycle
In the L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 genome, we detected two
gene clusters, named as cluster 1 and cluster 2, encoding
seven of the ten enzymes involved in the RTCA cycle (Figure 1), including the four key enzymes. The genes encoding malate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase and
isocitrate dehydrogenase (Figure 1, reactions 1, 2, and 6)
were also detected, but in a different genomic locus. In
order to characterize the genetic organization of clusters 1
and 2, we examined co-transcription of these neighbor
genes using a RT-PCR approach. Amplification products
of the predicted size from each inter-operon region from
both clusters were observed, verifying co-transcription of
the four proposed operons. These results suggest that the
genes contained within clusters 1 and 2 are organized into
two transcriptional units (Figure 2). Genomic sequences
of both clusters were inspected looking for theoretical Rho
independent transcriptional terminators in the interoperon regions, but in any of the 4 operons an evident terminator was found. Nevertheless the inter-operon regions
in both cases is big enough for not to suspect a cotranscriptions of genes as it is probed by RT-PCR results (474
nts between ccs and ccl operons and 207 nts. between for
and por operons. It is important to notice that our method
identified three open reading frames by blast search,
encoding the conserved hypothetical proteins orf1, orf2
and orf3, co-transcribed with the known putative RTCA
cycle genes on these two clusters. Additionally, bioinformatic studies showed that each of these open reading
frames contained a putative ribosome binding sequence,

The genomic analysis performed on these three genomes
suggested that the two γ-proteobacteria strains from the
Acidithiobacillus genus (strains DSM 16786 and DSM
17318) can fix CO2 via the CBB cycle. This is based on the
identification of all 13 genes encoding enzymes required
for this cycle; however, distinct forms and copy numbers
of the Rubisco genes were identified. We did not identify
genes encoding the key CO2 fixation enzymes of the CBB
cycle in Leptospirillum DSM 17947.
CO2 fixation by the RTCA cycle
The absence of genes encoding for canonical enzymes of
the Calvin cycle in Leptospirillum DSM 17947 suggested
the existence of an alternative mechanism for CO2 fixation. The reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (RTCA), which
is essentially the TCA cycle running in reverse direction,
also leads to the fixation of two molecules of CO2 and to
the production of one molecule of acetyl-CoA. The acetylCoA formed is then reduced by carboxylation to pyruvate,
from which all other central metabolites can be formed.
The four key enzymes that make possible the reversal TCA
cycle and pyruvate formation are ATP citrate lyase (ACL),
fumarate reductase (FDR), 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxi-

These findings represent the first evidence of the reductive
tricarboxylic acid cycle as being the autotrophic CO2 fixation mechanism in a member of Leptospirillum genus.

Bioinformatic analysis of the L. ferriphilum RTCA cycle
predicted proteins
The RTCA cycle operates in phylogenetically diverse
autotrophic bacteria and archaea [36-41]. Due to this high
diversity, it is not surprising to find some differences
among these organisms with respect to the catalytic mechanisms and enzymes involved in each step of the cycle.

Two examples of these differences are demonstrated by
conversion reactions of citrate, which form acetyl-CoA
plus oxaloacetate and carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate
which forms isocitrate. Both conversions can be catalyzed
in only one reaction as its described for most bacteria, or
in two reactions as has been described for Hydrogenobacter
thermophilus [42]. To elucidate the nature of the RTCA
cycle enzymatic reactions for L. ferriphilum DSM 17947,
we analyzed the deduced amino acid sequences of the predicted proteins using a bioinformatics approach.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:581

The first key enzyme of the RTCA pathway is fumarate
reductase (Figure 1, reaction 3), which catalyzes the reduction of fumarate to succinate using ubiquinol as an electron donor. This enzyme is a transmembrane protein
comprised of two domains; the soluble N-terminal
domain (subunit A) which is exposed to the cytoplasm
and contains a covalently linked FAD, and the membranebound C-terminal domain (subunit B) which contains
three iron-sulfur centers. Based on amino acid comparisons of these core subunits and on comparison of the
metal centers and membrane anchors, fumarate reductase
has been subdivided into five classes, types A-E [43]. The
type E group is comprised of those enzymes that lack a
canonical membrane-anchoring domain but contain
amphipathic subunits that ensure interaction with the
membrane. Although we searched the complete genome
of L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 for specific sequences to each
class of fumarate reductase [43], only the frdA and frdB
genes were detected, which encode the flavoprotein and
iron-sulfur protein subunits respectively, and were located
in tandem in the ccl operon (Figure 2). We did not detect
orthologs for any of the known membrane anchoring subunits. The FdrA and FdrB candidate proteins showed overall similarity to the corresponding subunits of Geobacter
metallireducens (70% and 59%, respectively). In addition,
FdrA has a high similarity to the SdhA subunit of succinate
dehydrogenase from the cyanobacteria Synecchocystis sp.,
which resembles type E enzymes that contain a noncanonical amphipathic subunit structure [43]. Taken
together, these data suggest that the fumarate reductase
from L. ferriphilum is a new member of the fumarate
reductase type E family [43]. In addition, using bioinformatics procedures, the polypeptide encoded by orf1
located upstream of frdA and frdB was predicted to contain four putative amphipathic helices and to be targeted
towards the inner membrane of the cell. We therefore
believe that orf1 is a candidate gene for the anchor subunit
of fumarate reductase. Further research will be required to
evaluate the subunit composition and the catalytic properties of the Frd enzyme from the Leptospirillum genus.
Another key enzyme of the RTCA pathway is 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (OGOR) (Figure 1, reaction
5), which catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of succinyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate. In H. thermophilus, a chemolithoautotrophic hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium that fixes
carbon dioxide via the RTCA cycle, two different OGOR
polypeptide complexes have been reported: one with two
subunits (encoded by korAB) and the other with five subunits (encoded by forDABGEF) [44]. A search of the L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 genome showed five similar genes to
those in the for operon, including forABGE, which encode
the α, β, γ, and ε subunits of OGOR (Figure 2), and two
non-identical copies of forD (encoding the δ subunit).
These latter non-identical copies of forD (forD1 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/581

forD2) were identified in a different genomic loci which is
strikingly different from other models described and will
therefore require further analysis to confirm the nature of
this putative δ subunit and its possible role in the enzymatic activity of the OGOR complex. The deduced amino
acid sequences of these six OGOR subunits showed high
overall similarity (66–80%) to the corresponding OGOR
subunits of H. thermophilus and also to the conserved protein motifs common to 2-oxoacid acceptor oxidoreductases in the Prosite database (α: PF01855, β: PF02775, γ:
PF01558, ε: PF00037, δ1 and δ2: PF02552). No evidence
of korAB genes encoding a two-subunit OGOR was found.
In prokaryotes, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) (Figure
1, reaction 6) is mainly an oligomeric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. ICDH has been mainly studied as a catabolic enzyme
of TCA cycle; nonetheless, in some CO2-fixing organisms
that utilize the RTCA cycle, special properties of the ICDH
enzyme have become evident [42]. For illustration, ICDH
from Clorobium limicola [45] is a monomeric enzyme that
works more favorably fixing CO2 in anabolic way than in
catabolic decarboxylating way, contrary to that for the
ICDH enzyme from E. coli. In addition, a novel mechanism for efficient conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate has been recently described for ICDH from H.
thermophilus [46] and involves two distinct and consecutive reactions catalyzed by 2-oxoglutarate carboxylase
(OGC) and oxalosuccinate reductase (OSR). In L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, we identified isocitrate dehydrogenase genes similar to those from E. coli. This suggests that
L. ferriphilum does not utilize ICDH for anabolic CO2 fixation, as described for C. limicola or H. thermophilus.
Experimental methods will be required to determine
whether the ICDH from L. ferriphilum functions in a manner similar to that from E. coli or whether this enzyme catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate in a
novel manner.
An important reaction in carbon metabolism is the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to citrate via the
TCA cycle. This reaction is catalyzed by citrate synthase;
however, in the case of the RTCA cycle, the reverse reaction is catalyzed by ATP citrate lyase (ACL). ACL is a key
enzyme of the RTCA cycle and is unique to organisms that
utilize the RTCA cycle. ACL has also been reported in
eukaryotes [47-50], where it plays an important role in
supplying acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis. ACL
from Chlorobium [51] and fungi [52] is composed of a
small and a large subunit with similarity to the N- and Cterminal half, respectively, of the mammalian single
polypeptide ACL [53]. On the other hand, in the Aquifex
and Hydrogenobacter genera, a novel and ACL-independent citrate cleavage pathway has been described [54,55].
In these organisms, the ATP-dependent cleavage of citrate

Page 6 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:581

is catalyzed by the combined action of the citryl-CoA synthetase (Ccs) and citryl-CoA lyase (Ccl) enzymes (Figure
1, reactions 8 and 9). Ccs is composed of a 46 kDa β subunit and a 36 kDa α subunit. Ccl is a single polypeptide
protein of 30 kDa.
Inspection of the L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 genome
revealed the presence of ccsAB and ccl, but not aclAB, suggesting that in this bacterium, citrate cleavage occurs via
two successive reactions catalyzed by the enzymes Ccs and
Ccl, as described for the Aquifex and Hydrogenobacter genera and for H. thermophilus [54,55]. In addition, the predicted polypeptide sequences of CcsA, CcsB and Ccl
displayed high amino acid similarity to the corresponding
proteins of H. thermophilus (CcsA: 74% similarity, CcsB:
75% similarity and Ccl: 66% similarity).
Pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR) is another key
enzyme in the RTCA pathway and catalyzes the reductive
carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate (Figure 1, reaction 10). POR, like OGOR, is a member of the 2-oxoacid
oxidoreductase family and both enzymes are structurally
similar, making sequence comparisons difficult; fortunately, the POR and OGOR enzymes of H. thermophilus
have been enzymatically characterized [56-59], and the
amino acid sequences are available in the NCBI database.
We identified five putative por genes (porABGED) in the L.
ferriphilum genome, and based upon the similarity of their
deduced amino acid sequences to those from H. thermophilus we assigned a putative function to these genes.
The predicted proteins PorA, PorB, PorG, PorE and PorD
were similar (65–79%) to α, β, γ, ε and δ subunits of the
POR enzyme from H. thermophilus and has the conserved
pattern of 2-oxoacid: acceptor oxidoreductases (Prosite
database). Additionally, the POR subunit genes were clustered downstream of the for operon (Figure 2).
Pyruvate produced from the RTCA cycle is directed to gluconeogenesis (Figure 1) for the biosynthesis of several carbonated intermediate molecules required by the cell. The
anabolic conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP) is typically catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase (PEPS), whereas the catabolic conversion of PEP
to pyruvate is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK). The combined and coordinated action of PEPS and PK allows the
cell to control the interconversion of pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate according to its metabolic requirements.
Additionally, in several organisms including bacteria and
archaea, phosphoenolpyruvate diquinase (PPDK) has
been reported for interconversion of these metabolites
[60,61] A search of the L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 genome
revealed a candidate gene encoding PEPS, but did not
uncover any genes encoding PK or PPDK. An additional
search for genes involved in glycolytic pathways revealed
that pfkA and pfkB, genes encoding the catabolic regula-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/581

tory enzyme phosphofructokinase, were also missing. The
absence of genes for the glycolitic enzymes pyruvate
kinase (PK) and phosphofructo kinase (PFK) allowed us
to predict that in L. ferriphilum, the Embden-MeyerhofParnas (EMP) pathway also works preferentially in the
anabolic direction. Interestingly, in A. ferrooxidans and A.
thiooxidans which use the CBB cycle to fix CO2, genomic
analysis revealed the presence of genes for both PK and
PFK (PFK-2) enzymes. This suggests that in both Acidithiobacillus strains, the EMP pathway operates in both anabolic and catabolic directions, wherein the 3phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGA) formed by the CBB cycle
enters the EMP pathway to form glucose via anabolic reactions, or to form pyruvate via catabolic reactions. An
incomplete TCA cycle can convert pyruvate to oxaloacetate as well as to succinyl-CoA and 2-oxoglutarate to form
metabolites related to the biosynthesis of cellular components [62]. Hypothetical models delineating the reactions
associated with the glycolytic/glucogenic pathway and the
TCA coupled cycles in the Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum strains examined in this study are shown in Figure 3.
Our genomic analysis suggests that completely different
regulatory mechanisms exist for microorganisms that fix
CO2 via alternative mechanisms. Specifically, the
Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum strains examined in this
study fix CO2 by altering the direction of the central carbon metabolism.
Molecular mechanisms involved in CO2 concentrating
mechanisms
Carbon concentrating mechanisms are present in many
species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, enabling them
to grow in the presence of low concentrations of CO2.
They mainly utilize bicarbonate transporters and CO2
traps to generate high intracellular concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon.

Inorganic carbon transporters that deliver intracellular
HCO3 - represent an important carbon concentrating
mechanism within a diverse group of microorganisms
[63]. In cyanobacteria at least five distinct enzymes for
active inorganic carbon uptake have been described,
including BCT1 (High affinity Bicarbonate Transporter 1),
SbtA (Sodium bicarbonate transporter A), BicA (Low
affinity Na+-dependent Bicarbonate Transporter), NDH14 and NDH-13 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase type 1)
(Reviewed in [64]). BicA is a Na+-dependent HCO3 - transporter belonging to the widespread SulP (Sulphate Transporter or Permease) family [65]. In the Acidithiobacillus
DSM 16786 and DSM 17318 strains analyzed in this
work, a putative gene for the BicA transporter was identified, whereas in L. ferriphilum putative genes for the BCT1
transporter (cmpABCD) were detected.

Figure 3 models of the metabolic direction of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) and TCA cycle pathways in the three
microorganisms examined in this study
Proposed
Proposed models of the metabolic direction of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) and TCA cycle pathways
in the three microorganisms examined in this study. A) Model representing the pathways utilized by L. ferriphilum DSM
17947. PK, pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40); PEPS, phosphoenolpyruvate syntethase (EC 2.7.9.2); PC, pyruvate carboxylase
(6.4.1.1); PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (4.1.1.3.1); POR, pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (1.2.7.1); PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.1.); CS, citrate synthase (EC2.3.3.1).B) Model representing the pathways utilized by A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 and A. thiooxidans DSM 17318. In A. ferrooxidans, the A, B and G subunits of the Por enzyme (encoded by
porABG genes) do not have amino acid identity with those from L. ferriphilum. In addition, por genes from L. ferriphilum DSM
17947 were not detected in either A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 or A. thiooxidans DSM 17318.

The carboxysome is a polyhedral micro compartment
located in the cytoplasm of most autotrophic bacteria and
is surrounded by a proteinaceous monolayer that reportedly contains Rubisco and carbonic anhydrase (CA) [63].
CA converts accumulated cytosolic HCO3 - into CO2
within the carboxysome, elevating the CO2 concentration
in the vicinity of Rubisco [65]. Previous reports described
the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 carboxysome as being
composed of at least seven peptides, all encoded by genes
located in a carboxysome operon [66]. Similarly, seven
candidate genes potentially involved in carboxysome formation were identified immediately downstream of the
cbbLS1 genes in both Acidithiobacillus strains examined in
the present report. The cbbLS2 and cbbM genes from these

strains are followed by the cbbQO genes, which are
involved in posttranslational regulation of Rubisco. Carbonic anhydrases are classified in four main forms: α-CA,
β-CA, γ-CA and ε-CA [67-69]. ε-CA has been described as
a novel form that corresponds to carboxysomal shell protein CsoS3 [70]. The β-CA family is comprised of enzymes
from four evolutionarily distinct clades (A through D).
Candidate genes for β-CA (Clade B), γ-CA and ε-CA, but
not for α-CA, were identified in the A. ferrooxidans DSM
16786 genome. This is consistent with that reported for A.
ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 [6]. In A. thiooxidans DSM17318,
we only identified a single candidate gene for ε-CA,
located in the putative carboxisome gene cluster. In L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, we identified putative genes for β-

CA (clade D) and γ-CA, but not for ε-CA (encoded by the
csoS3 gene) or for any of the carboxysome genes (cso
genes).

genes in the A. thiooxidans DSM 17318 and L. ferriphilum
DSM 17947 genomes, which suggests that these microorganisms utilize alternative mechanisms for assimilation
of nitrogen from the environment, consistent with what
has been reported for members of Leptospirillum Group II
[2,3], and A. thiooxidans [5].

Differences in CO2 concentrating mechanisms were also
predicted from genomic analysis of the bioleaching bacteria examined herein. In both Acidithiobacillus strains,
HCO3 - transport via carboxysomes and the BicA-type protein was inferred. Because CO2 concentrating mechanisms
have been described mainly among organisms that utilize
the CBB cycle, such as cyanobacteria, comparative analysis
with microorganisms that use the RTCA cycle is not possible. Further analysis will be necessary to determine
whether L. ferriphilum truly lacks carboxysomes or
whether an analogous structure is encoded by unidentified genes to improve the efficiency of RTCA cycle
enzymes that fix CO2.

Nitrate and nitrite assimilation
In addition to atmospheric nitrogen, other possible
sources of nitrogen for microorganisms are nitrate and
nitrite. Different nitrate and nitrite assimilation mechanisms have been described [72], but the general requirements include a transporter protein for nitrate and
enzymes that catalyze reduction of nitrate to nitrite and
finally to ammonia [72,73]. In A. thiooxidans, we found a
genomic region where genes homologues to components
of a nitrate and nitrite assimilation system are located
(Figure 4). The elements located in this region include
genes encoding a periplasmic component of a transport
system (nrtA), a putative nitrate transporter (narK), the
large and small subunits of nitrite reductase (nirB and
nirD) and nitrate reductase (narB), plus a hypothetical
protein conserved among several microorganisms that
lacks an assigned function. The nitrogen uptake and
reduction mechanisms in A. thiooxidans appear atypical
compared to that described for other microorganisms that
assimilate nitrate or nitrite [72-74]. For example, we identified a gene for the periplasmic component (nrtA) of an
ABC transport system, but no evidence of the permease
and ATPase components of this system were found. In
addition, next to nrtA we found narK, which encodes a
protein belonging to the major facilitator superfamily
(MFS) involved in the uptake of nitrate and nitrite. We
also found genes corresponding to ferredoxin-dependent
reductases, which participate in nitrate and nitrite reduction [74], but again these genes were distinct from those
reported for similar nitrate and nitrite assimilation systems. Specifically, genes for both nitrate reductase (narB),
which is involved in nitrate assimilation, and for nitrite
reductase (nirBD), which is involved in dissimilatory
nitrite reduction, were identified. However, it is possible
that the ammonium generated by nitrite reductase may be
assimilated in A. thiooxidans DSM 17318.

Nitrogen uptake mechanisms
To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by
which the microorganisms examined herein fulfill their
nitrogen requirements, we searched the genomic
sequences for genes involved in the uptake of different
nitrogen compounds (See additional file 2: NitAsilProts.csv for the list and sequence of proteins involved in
nitrogen assimilation). From this search we identified
genes that encode for the nitrogenase complex in A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, genes encoding proteins involved
in the assimilation of nitrate and nitrite in A. thiooxidans
DSM 17138, and genes coding for ammonia permeases
(amtB) in the three microorganisms.
Nitrogen fixation
In the A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 genome, we identified a
region in which genes of the nitrogenase complex and all
the necessary assembly proteins are located (Figure 3),
consistent with what has been reported in other strains of
A. ferrooxidans [22]. In this region we found the nitrogenase genes nifHDK next to several tandem genes important for assembly of the nitrogenase MoFe cofactor (fdxD,
C1499, nifE, nifN and nifX). Interestingly, the genes draGT,
the products of which are associated with post-translational regulation of nitrogenase in α-proteobacteria
[19,71] were situated in reverse orientation to the nifHDK
operon. In contrast, we did not find any homologous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/581

We examined whether A. thiooxidans DSM17318 was
capable of utilizing nitrate as the sole nitrogen source by
monitoring the growth of this strain in a shaking flask
experiment under aerobic conditions. Preliminary data
showed that this bacterium cannot grow using nitrate as
nitrogen source but can grow normally in the presence of
ammonia (data not shown). Most bacteria that assimilate
nitrate do so under aerobic conditions; in contrast, dissimilatory nitrate metabolism only occurs under anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions. Genome analysis of A.
thiooxidans DSM 17138 showed that conserved genes
involved in nitrate and nitrite assimilation as narB and
nirBD are present. This evidence suggests that this bacterium has the ability to assimilate both nitrate and nitrite
from the environment (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, experimental evidence under anaerobic conditions would be
required to verify this.
Ammonia uptake
Ammonia transporters (Amt) have been described for
almost all organisms, including bacteria [75], and catalyze
the movement of ammonia across the cell membrane. We
identified genes encoding ammonia permeases (amtB) in
all three microorganisms examined in this study. However, assimilation of ammonia from the environment
appears to be the only source of nitrogen for L. ferriphilum
DSM 17947, consistent with that reported for Leptospirillum sp. Group II [2,3].
Regulation of nitrogen assimilation
The process of nitrogen uptake, particularly nitrogen fixation, is energetically costly, and has therefore been shown
to be tightly regulated [[18,19], and [25]]. To assess the
regulatory mechanisms for nitrogen uptake in A. ferrooxidans DSM 16787, A. thiooxidans DSM 17318 and L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, we compared the genetic
information from these three organisms to genomic information from microorganisms with previously described
regulatory systems, focusing in particular on the genome
of A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, which we determined to be
capable of nitrogen fixation.

Nitrogen fixation (NifA, DraTG)
For γ-proteobacteria, nitrogen fixation has been shown to
be regulated via the NifLA system [18,19,76]. The NifA
protein is a transcription factor that regulates the nitrogenase operon, whereas NifL provides post-translational
inactivation of NifA when 2-oxoglutarate levels are high,
indicating an excess of nitrogen in the cell [77]. In the γproteobacteria A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, we identified a
nifA gene near the nitrogenase operon (Figure 5), but did
not find any nifL homologs, which suggests that the regulation of nitrogen fixation in these microorganisms is different from that previously described for other γproteobacteria. This was supported by a NifA-based phylogenetic analysis which grouped A. ferrooxidans DSM
16786 with members of the β-proteobacteria (Figure 6).
This suggests horizontal transfer of this nitrogen regulation mechanism to A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, similar to
what has been proposed for other genes in this microorganism [78]. In addition, the absence of the nifL gene
appears to be extended not only to the DSM 16786 strain,
because we did not find this gene to be present neither in
the genome sequence of the ATCC 23270 strain nor in the
recently available genome sequence of the ATCC 53993.

The lack of nifL in the A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 genome
makes it difficult to discern the manner in which oxygen
levels affect the regulation of nitrogen fixation in this
microorganism. Nitrogenase is very sensitive to oxygen
levels, and microorganisms cope with this problem via
strategies such as anaerobiosis, high rates of oxygen consumption, and compartmentalization. In γ-proteobacteria, the NifL protein responds to high oxygen by
inactivating the NifA protein, whereas in low oxygen conditions, the NifL protein activates the NifA regulator to
stimulate expression of the nitrogenase genes [18,79]. It
has been reported that in some microorganisms such as
Rhizobia, which also lacks nifL, NifA directly responds to
oxygen levels via an N-terminal cysteine motif (CXXXXC)
[18,79]. We identified a similar N-terminal cysteine motif
in the translated A. ferrooxidans nifA sequence, suggesting
that this microorganism circumvents the need for NifL by
utilizing NifA for direct response to oxygen levels.

Phylogenetic tree based on NifA protein sequences
Phylogenetic tree based on NifA protein sequences. The tree was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method, with
1000 replicates. Only those branches that appear in more than 50% of the boostrap replicates are considered. Evolutionary
distances were computed using the JTT matrix. Analysis was conducted using the software MEGA4 [110].

In the A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 genome, we also identified genes encoding dinitrogenase reductase-activating
glycohydrolase (DraG) and dinitrogenase reductase ADPribosyltransferase (DraT) proteins near the nitrogenase
operon (Figure 5). These gene products are involved in
post-translational regulation of the nitrogenase complex
in α-proteobacteria [18,80]. Under high nitrogen conditions, DraT inactivates nitrogenase via ADP-ribosylation
[80]. Under low nitrogen conditions, DraG catalyzes
removal of the ADP-ribose from nitrogenase to activate
the enzyme [80]. Only recently, the presence of these
genes was described in the ATCC23270 strain of A. ferrooxidans [5], making this microorganism the first
reported γ-proteobacteria to be carrying such genes, again
suggesting lateral transfer from other microorganisms.
Although nitrogenase genes were not identified in the A.
thiooxidans DSM 17318 and L. ferriphilum DSM 17947

genomes, we searched these genomes for nitrogenase regulatory elements. In L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, we identified a candidate nifA homolog, annotated as a NifA-like
transcriptional regulator, but the gene was located in a
region containing genes involved in the synthesis of flagella. This NifA candidate has an 82% identity with the
NifA transcriptional regulator from Leptospirillum sp.
Group II. In Leptospirillum sp. Group II, nifA is also located
in a region containing genes involved in the synthesis of
flagella. It is possible that in L. ferriphilum, this NifA-like
protein regulates the synthesis and/or the assembly of
flagella, but this needs to be explored further. Of note, the
NifA gene in L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 is distinct from
that in L. ferrooxidans, an organism previously shown to
participate in nitrogen fixation in the Tinto River
[23,112], and from that in L. ferrodiazotrophum, an organism previously connected to nitrogen fixation in the acid
mine drainage [24].

The NtrB/NtrC two-component system
Another important regulatory system in the assimilation
of nitrogen compounds is the NtrB/NtrC (Part of the
nitrogen regulation system Ntr) two-component system
[18,19]. This system is involved in bacterial response to
different nitrogen sources, such as molecular nitrogen,
ammonia, or nitrate, and is present in great number of
microorganisms [18]. The NtrB protein is a kinase, which
activates NtrC via phosphorylation under low nitrogen
conditions. NtrC is a transcription factor that not only regulates the glnA gene, which encodes the glutamine synthetase enzyme required for metabolic incorporation of
ammonia, and the glnK-amtB operon, which encodes a PII
regulatory protein and an ammonia permease protein,
but also regulates its own operon (ntrBC). Positive regulation of ntrBC is triggered in response to low intracellular
levels of glutamine via the PII sensory system [18,81,82].
We identified genes encoding proteins of the NtrB/NtrC
two-component system in the A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786
and A. thiooxidans DSM 17318 genomes. In contrast, we
identified genes from the NtrY/NtrX two-component
nitrogen assimilation system in the L. ferriphilum DSM
17947 genome. NtrX is a transcriptional regulator similar
to members of the Fis family (53% identity with a protein
from Geobacter uraniireducens) whereas NtrY is a membrane-bound sensor kinase protein. The NtrY/NtrX system
has been described in Azorhizobium caulinodans and Azospirillum brasilense (both diazotrophs), and in A. brasilense,
where it was shown to participate in the regulation of
nitrogen assimilation via detection of ammonia [83]. This
suggests that in L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, NtrY detects
ammonia levels and regulates the transcription factor
NtrX accordingly.

Because amtB is present in all three organisms examined
in this study, this suggests a common mechanism for regulation of ammonia uptake [18,84]. In A. ferrooxidans
DSM 16786 and A. thiooxidans DSM 17318, ammonia levels are detected in response to glutamine concentrations
and uptake is controlled by the NtrB/NtrC system. In L.
ferriphilum DSM 17947, ammonia levels are directly
detected by NtrY and uptake is controlled by the NtrY/
NtrX system. Nonetheless, both systems likely control
similar target genes.
PII protein family
The PII family of signal transduction proteins are found in
eukarya, bacteria and archaea [81,82]. These proteins
comprise one of the central mechanisms for controlling
the metabolism of nitrogen and carbon in the cell [26,85]
via detection of intracellular levels of different compounds, like glutamine, ATP, and 2-oxoglutarate [18].
This allows them to integrate the information from nitrogen (glutamine, ATP) and the carbon metabolism (ATP,
2-oxoglutarate), thus activating or inactivating several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/581

enzymes and transcription factors according to the
requirements of the cell [18,19,26,81,82,85].
We identified several members of the PII proteins family
(See additional file 2: NitAsilProts.csv for the list of proteins) within the genomes of the three microorganisms
examined in this study: A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 had
four PII family member genes, whereas A. thiooxidans
DSM 17318 and L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 only had two.
This difference may reflect the finding that only A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 is capable of nitrogen fixation, thus
requiring a tighter control over the process involved in
nitrogen assimilation (nitrogen fixation and ammonia
uptake). In Figure 7 we propose a model depicting the regulation of nitrogen assimilation in A. ferrooxidans DSM
16786. In this organism, the PII proteins are germane to
regulation of nitrogen levels in the cell, the key effectors
being glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate. Under low nitrogen
conditions, PII protein is uridylylated by GlnD (uridylyl
transferase), which is active when glutamine levels are low
[81,82]. Uridylylated PII interacts with DraG protein to
remove the ADP-ribose from nitrogenase, rendering this
enzyme active for nitrogen fixation. Uridylylated PII also
interacts with the NifA regulatory protein to activate NifA
and stimulate the transcription of its target genes (e.g., the
nitrogenase operon and the elements required for its
assembly). In addition, when nitrogen levels are low, the
intracellular levels of 2-oxoglutarate are high [81,82],
which inactivates the action of the non-uridylylated PII
protein, resulting not only in the removal of AMP from
glutamine synthetase (GlnA) to stimulate glutamine synthesis from ammonia but also in stimulation of NtrC
phosphorylation by NtrB to induce the transcription of
several targets including the amtB-glnK operon, which
contains an ammonia permease and a PII protein, and the
ntrBC operon itself [18,19]. Under low nitrogen conditions, AmtB permease participates in the uptake of ammonia, which is transformed into glutamine by glutamine
synthetase (GlnA). Under high nitrogen conditions,
glutamine stimulates GlnD, which removes the uridylyl
moiety from the PII protein [81,82]. This protein stimulates DraT, which inactivates nitrogenase by ADP-ribosylation. Also, the non-uridylylated PII protein sequesters
DraG to the membrane and binds to AmtB permease,
blocking the uptake of ammonia into the cell [18,80]. In
addition, because 2-oxoglutarate levels are low, the nonuridylylyated PII protein stimulates NtrB dephosporylation of NtrC to prevent activation of NtrC target genes.
Non-uridylylyated PII also stimulates GlnE, which inactivates glutamine synthetase by AMP-ribosylation [18,19].
We propose that A. ferrooxidans likely has four PII genes
because both nitrogen fixation and ammonia uptake
mechanisms are in operation. The PII family of proteins is
also central for the other two organisms examined in this
study. However, because A. thiooxidans DSM 17318 uti-

lizes nitrate reduction and ammonia uptake and because
L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 utilizes only ammonia uptake,
only two PII genes are required to carry out nitrogen
metabolism. For A. thiooxidans DSM 17138 and A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786; the common elements of ammonia
uptake are those involved in detection and regulation of
ammonia levels. Similar to nitrogen fixation, nitrate

assimilation likely occurs under low oxygen conditions, is
tightly regulated, and involves not only detection of
glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate levels, but also detection of
oxygen levels, for expression of the appropriate genes. Further exploration is needed to establish the connection
between ammonia uptake and nitrate assimilation in A.
thiooxidans.

An unexplored issue for nitrogen fixation in A. ferrooxidans
is the oxygen sensitivity of the nitrogenase enzyme. A. ferrooxidans typically uses oxygen as its terminal electron
acceptor during nitrogen fixation, although it reportedly
grows under anaerobic conditions using a ferric ion as the
terminal electron acceptor [86]. We have recent evidence
that this nitrogenase enzyme is functioning under aerobic
conditions on some substrates (data not shown). We
believe that in A. ferrooxidans, inactivation of nitrogenase
may be prevented by two parallel mechanisms: increased
activity of the terminal cytochrome oxidase bd protein
may impart respiratory nitrogenase protection [87] and a
ferrodoxin "FeSII"-like protein may provide conformational protection of nitrogenase. Both protective mechanisms have been described for Azotobacter vinelandii
[88,89]. A homolog of the A. vinelandii FeSII gene was
identified two open reading frames downstream of the
nitrogenase gene nifK, and would likely be co-expressed
with the complete nif operon (data not shown). This putative ferredoxin protein may protect nitrogenase from irreversible inactivation mediated by oxygen, as has also been
described for Gluconobacter diazotrophicus [90]. More
experimental data is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
Although this study provides important genetic information regarding L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, there is insufficient information for development of a nitrogen
metabolism regulatory model. For example, a possible
interaction between the NtrX/NtrY system and the PII proteins has been recently explored in Rhodobacter capsulatus
[91]; for L. ferriphilum DSM 17947, it is unclear which
nitrogenous species is detected by NtrX/NtrY. In addition,
other Leptospirillum species [4,24] are reportedly capable
of nitrogen fixation, in contrast to L. ferriphilum, making
extrapolation from one species to another difficult.
Recently it has been reported the genome sequence of
another strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, which was
released by the Joint Genome Institute and named as A.
ferrooxidans ATCC 53993. This strain was previously characterized as L. ferrooxidans, but now with the genome
available it has been reclassified as a member of the
Acidithiobacillus genus. Comparing the genome sequence
of the ATCC 53993 strain and our A. ferrooxidans DSM
16786 strain, we observed some differences related with
the genome organization (manuscript in preparation),
but the genes and mechanisms involved in carbon and
nitrogen fixation that we are discussing in this paper, are
also present in the ATCC 53993 strain. A similar situation
occurred when we compared the genome sequence of our
L. ferriphilum strain DSM 17947, against the genome
sequence of the microorganism Leptospirillum sp. Group II
UBA (92), where the same genes that we described in this
work for the carbon and nitrogen assimilation, are also
present in this microorganism, confirming that our find-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/581

ings are conserved in microorganisms from the same specie.
Based on our genomic analysis, an ecological role for each
of these three microorganisms within a bioleaching community can be proposed. In this type of environment,
energy is not the limiting factor for the development of
the microbial community, as sulfur or iron minerals are
abundant and can be used as electron donors. Therefore,
carbon and/or nitrogen are likely the most limiting elements for the development of the microbial biomass.
Given this limitation, A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, or other
nitrogen fixing microorganism, may act as the primary
supplier of nitrogen (either in the form of nitrate or
ammonia) and may therefore be essential for the establishment of a microbial community in this system.
Although each of the strains analyzed in this study is capable of carbon fixation, different pathways are employed to
accomplish this purpose. The Calvin-Benson-Bassham
cycle represents the most important extant autotrophic
carbon fixation pathway. Despite its global significance, it
is restricted to organisms with high-energy yield from a
chemotrophic or phototrophic lifestyle. Microorganisms
present in extreme environments (e.g., high temperature,
anaerobic, or acidic conditions) generally utilize different
CO2 fixation pathways [37]. Thus, the presence of the
RTCA cycle in Leptospirillum reflects the fact that these
microorganisms are more metabolically restricted than A.
ferrooxidans or A. thiooxidans; Leptospirillum is the only
genus which strictly uses ferrous iron as an electron
donor. Additionally, the presence of two completely different CO2 fixation mechanisms in the Acidithiobacillus
and Leptospirillum genera likely reflects the distinct growth
and colonization capacities of these bacteria in extreme
environmental conditions. This might also explain the
dominance of the Leptospirillum genus reported in
bioleaching communities from industrial operations or
from naturally extreme environments [93,94].
To date, a lack of mutational studies and/or knockout
strains has prohibited analysis of CO2 and nitrogen
metabolisms in A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans, and L. ferriphilum. However, as demonstrated here and elsewhere
[3,24], genomic and other global (transcriptomic and
metatranscriptomic) approaches (1,4) can bypass this
limitation to provide relevant information regarding individual and community metabolisms.

Conclusion
The genomic study presented here, is the first attempt to
describe the metabolic tactics used by a community of
three chemolitotrophic bacteria found in a Chilean biomining environment. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is capable of oxidizing iron and sulfides as energy source,

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:581

whereas Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans only oxidizes sulfides
and Leptospirillum ferriphilum only oxidizes iron. These
three organisms often share the same environmental
niche, but their relative abundance differs depending on
whether their surroundings are natural or modified by
operations such as mining, likely because the nutrient
sources in both cases are completely different. To have a
deeper insight on how microorganisms take advantage of
the CO2 and nitrogen resources present in their environment we performed this comparative analysis concluding
the following main facts:
A. ferrooxidans fixes CO2 by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham
(CBB) cycle, the same mechanism used by A. thiooxidans,
but the latter has only 1 copy of Rubisco type I instead of
the 2 copies found in A. ferrooxidans. A different and novel
situation was discovered for Leptospirillum ferriphilum that
is fixing CO2 by the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle.
With respect to nitrogen source assimilation we discovered that while all the species analyzed can incorporate
ammonia by their ammonia transporter, Acidithiobacillus
thiooxidans can assimilate nitrate and nitrite and only
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is able to fix nitrogen directly
from the air

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, A. thiooxidans DSM 17318 and
L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 (all strains owned by BioSigma
SA) were grown at 30°C with shaking (200 rpm) in basal
9 K medium ((NH4)SO4: 0.4 g/L, K2HPO4: 0.4 g/L,
MgSO4-7H2O: 0.4 g/L) adjusted to pH 1.8 with concentrated sulfuric acid and supplemented with i) FeSO47H20: 30 g/L, ii) S°: 1% w/v and iii) FeSO4-7H20: 15 g/L
plus Fe2(SO4)3: 12,4 g/L, respectively. Cell number was
determined by chamber counting under microscope
(Thoma Chamber, depth 0.010 mm). Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.

To evaluate the growth of A. thiooxidans DSM 17318 on
nitrate, cells were grown in 9 K medium with or without
ammonia and supplemented with 0.5–4.0 g/L KNO3,
above described. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were
quantified using Nitratest (Merck) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Generation of Genomics Library and Sequence Analysis
Sequencing of A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786 performed
using a shotgun library of 5,568 clones (2,000 bp each)
sequenced by Seqwrite (Houston, TX) and a second
library of 1,433 fosmids (40,000 bp each) sequenced by
Agencourt (Boston, MA), with an estimated coverage 2.79
folds. The final assembly contained 764 contigs forming
286 scaffolds; the biggest scaffolds covered 62% of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/581

total sequence, while the general coverage of all the
assembled contigs is estimated to be near a 94% of the
total sequence. The genome of A. thiooxidans DSM 17318
was sequenced using a shotgun library of 18,0480 plasmid clones (4,000 bp each) and 11,088 fosmid clones
(40,000 bp each) sequenced by Agencourt (Boston, MA),
with an estimated coverage of 4.5×. The final assembly
contained 882 contigs forming 283 scaffolds; the seven
biggest scaffolds covered the 75% of the sequence, while
the general coverage of all the assembled contigs is estimated to be near 92% of the total sequence. The genome
of L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 was sequenced using a shotgun library 13,645 plasmid clones (2,000 bp each) and
10,088 fosmids clones (40,000 bp each) sequenced by
Agencourt (Boston MA), with an estimated coverage of
5.47×. The final assembly contained 321 contigs forming
89 scaffolds; the five biggest scaffolds covered 87% of the
sequence, while the general coverage of all the assembled
contigs is estimated to be near a 94% of the total
sequence. For all the three genomes, base calling was performed using Phred [95,96] and resulting reads were
assembled using a two-stage method: contigs were formed
using Arachne [97], consensus sequences of each contig
were obtained using Phrap [98]. Scaffolds were formed
using the Bambus software [98] based on read mate-pairing. Ambiguities were solved by comparison to the reference sequences and by manual curation.
Genome annotation
The assembled sequences of the three genomes were
annotated using the GenDB annotation system [100].
Candidate ORFs were marked using Glimmer/Critica
[101] and annotated by homology to the COG database
[102], to non-redundant proteins from NCBI and to previously described proteins from the literature. Protein
domains were marked using InterPro [103]. Afterwards
automatic annotation was manually cured.
PCR and RT-PCR
Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out in
order to identify co-transcribed genes of L. ferriphilum
DSM 17947. PCR reactions were carried out to characterize the nirB gene of A. thiooxidans DSM 17318. For RTPCR, total RNA was isolated from cells in late exponential
phase using the protocol described in [104] Briefly, cell
pellets were washed with a solution of 10 mM H2SO4
(pH1.2) followed by PBS buffer (pH 1.2) and suspended
in Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing EDTA, SDS, Triton X100, and Tween 20 (STT buffer) [105]. The suspension
was treated with proteinase K and phenol: chloroform
extracted. The total RNA was precipitated using isopropanol as described in [105]. Genomic DNA for PCR amplification of nirB was obtain using the same protocol in
[104], for total RNA extraction described previously. PCR
and RT-PCR were carried out by standard procedures and

included various control reactions that accompanied each
experiment. The DNA sequences of the various primers
used for both RT-PCR and PCR and their locations on the
genomic open reading frame context are provided (See
additional file 3: OligoList.pdf for the list of primers
used).
Bioinformatics sequence analysis
The genomic sequences from the three microorganisms
under investigation were examined. Proteins involved in
known carbon fixation pathways were obtained from the
KEGG database [106]. Amino acid sequences derived
from genes identified as being involved in the Calvin cycle
and the RTCA cycle were used as query sequences to
search the translated nucleotide database from the
genomes of the A. ferrooxidans DSM 16786, A. thiooxidans
DSM 17318 and L. ferriphilum DSM 17947 strains using
tBlastn [107] with default parameters. When a prospective
candidate gene was identified, its predicted amino acid
sequence was used to formulate a BlastP [107] search of
the NCBI non-redundant data base. Only the best hits
were accepted as evidence for putative orthologs. Candidate genes and their corresponding translated proteins
were further characterized using the following bioinformatics tools: primary structure similarity relations were
determined using ClustalW 1.8 [108], structural motif
predictions were determined using Prosite [109] and peptide domain predictions were determined using ProDom
[110].

Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Mega
software version 4.0 [111]. Tree drawing and visualization
was done using the software FigTree 1.1.2 [112].
