Abstract
Bacteriophage research continues to break new ground in our understanding of the basic molecular
mechanisms of gene action and biological structure. The abundance of bacteriophages in nature and
the diversity of their genomes are two reasons why phage research brims with excitement. The
pages of Virology Journal will reflect the excitement of the "New Phage Biology."

The launching of Virology Journal comes at a time of resurgence of interest in the basic biology of the bacteriophages
and the impact that these viruses have on earth's ecology,
evolution of microbial diversity and the control of infectious disease. Since playing an important part in the birth
of Molecular Biology more than 50 years ago [1], phage
research has continually broken new ground in our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of gene
action and biological structure [2]. This trend shows no
signs of waning. In a recent international meeting entitled
The New Phage Biology [3], the program was largely
devoted to emerging frontiers of research that have been
empowered by a rapid accumulation of genome sequence
information from a wide variety of bacteriophages. Phage
genomics is revealing novel biochemical mechanisms for
replication, maintenance and expression of the genetic
material and is providing new insights into origins of
infectious disease and the potential use of phage gene
products and even whole phage as therapeutic agents.

where bacteria or archaea reside [4]. At one level, there is
diversity in the types of phages that infect individual or
interrelated bacterial species. At another level, there is
diversity among genomically related phages that do not
share the same bacterial hosts. One example is the lytic
Enterobacterial dsDNA phage T4, which has relatives that
are specific to Aeromonas, Vibrio, Acinetobacter, marine and
other bacterial species. The genomes of a few T4-like
phages have been sequenced and found to indeed share
homologies with T4, but to also differ from one another
in size, organization of the T4-like genes and content of
other putative genes and DNA mobile elements (http://
phage.bioc.tulane.edu). It appears that phage families like
the T4-related phages have learned to cross bacterial species barriers and possess plastic genomes that can acquire
and lose genetic cassettes through their travels in the
microbial world. In essence, genomes of the dsDNA
phages may be repositories of the genetic diversity of all
microorganisms in nature.

Two reasons why the new era of phage research brims
with excitement are the abundance of bacteriophages in
nature and the diversity of their genomes. Phage is probably the most widely distributed biological entity in the
biosphere, with an estimated population of >1030 or ~10
million per cubic centimeter of any environmental niche

In addition to evolving by serving as traffickers of microbial genes, phage genomes evolve through the accumulation of mutations in both acquired and core genes.
Sequence divergence among homologues of the essential
genes for phage propagation within a phage family can be
used as a source of information about the determinants of

specificity of the protein-protein and protein-nucleic-acid
interactions that underlie biological function. Phages are
excellent sources of many enzymes and biochemical
transactions that are broadly represented in all divisions
of life. The large numbers of phylogenetic variants of biologically interesting proteins and nucleic acids that one
can derive from sequenced phage genomes are treasure
troves for studies of biological structure in relation to
function. Interest in phage and phage gene products as
potential therapeutic agents is also increasing rapidly and
is likely to have profound impact on the pharmaceutical
industry and biotechnology in general over the coming
years. There is a general sense that the best is yet to come
out of phage research.

Conclusion
We anticipate that the pages of Virology Journal will reflect
the excitement of the "New Phage Biology" by publishing
reports in the areas of Ecology and Taxonomy, Genomics
and Molecular Evolution, Regulation of Gene Expression,
Genome Replication and Maintenance, Protein and
Nucleic Acid Structure, Virus assembly, Biotechnology,
Pathogenesis, Therapeutics and more. It would be especially interesting to see submissions of phage genome
sequence briefs and their biological implications.
