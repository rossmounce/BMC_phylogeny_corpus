Abstract
Background: In crustaceans and insects, development and reproduction are controlled by the
steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Like other steroids, 20E, is synthesized from
cholesterol through reactions involving cytochrome P450s (CYPs). In insects, the CYP enzymes
mediating 20E biosynthesis have been identified, but evidence of their probable presence in
crustaceans is indirect, relying solely on the ability of crustaceans to synthesize 20E.
Results: To investigate the presence of these genes in crustaceans, the genome of Daphnia pulex
was examined for orthologs of these genes, the Halloween genes, encoding those biosynthetic CYP
enzymes. Single homologs of spook-CYP307A1, phantom-CYP306A1, disembodied-CYP302A1, shadowCYP315A1 and shade-CYP314A1 were identified in the Daphnia data base. Phylogenetic analysis
indicates an orthologous relationship between the insect and Daphnia genes. Conserved intron/
exon structures and microsynteny further support the conclusion that these steroidogenic CYPs
have been conserved in insects and crustaceans through some 400 million years of evolution.
Conclusion: Although these arthropod steroidogenic CYPs are related to steroidogenic CYPs in
Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrates, the data suggest that the arthropod steroidogenic CYPs
became functionally specialized in a common ancestor of arthropods and are unique to these
animals.

Background
Steroid hormones, regulate essential processes during
development and reproduction, and are synthesized from
cholesterol under the control of steroidogenic enzymes in
the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family [1]. In Caenorhabditis
elegans, insects and vertebrates, different steroids are produced to control developmental processes, suggesting that
steroidogenic CYPs evolved and became functionally specialized in different lineages during evolution. In insects,

a specific biosynthetic pathway yielding 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), the arthropod molting hormone, evolved,
whereas in the line leading to vertebrates, biosynthetic
CYPs that produce the vertebrate-type steroids evolved
[2]. Since there is some evidence of the presence of vertebrate-type sex steroids in invertebrates such as echinoderms and mollusks, although no unequivocal evidence
that they can synthesize these steroids [3], the possibility
remains that CYPs with the capacity to produce vertebrate-

type sex steroids were present in the common ancestor
even before the protostome-deuterostome split. Thus, the
evolution of steroidogenic CYPs is still an open question.
Crustaceans are believed to represent the ancestral arthropods from which insects originated [4]. The evolutionary
relationship between these two groups is evident from the
common growth strategy of insects and crustaceans that
involves molting so that growth can occur. Molting is governed by periodic increases in the levels of 20E that elicit
the programs that coordinate the developmental and
metamorphic transitions [5]. Although a great deal of evidence reveals that crustaceans, like insects, synthesize 20E
from cholesterol [6], the molecular details of steroidogenesis in crustaceans remain conjectural. In insects, steroidogenic CYPs are products of the Halloween genes
phantom (phm: CYP306A1), disembodied (dib: CYP302A1),
shadow (sad: CYP315A1) and shade (shd: CYP314A1) and
are responsible for the last four hydroxylations in the
pathway leading to 20E [7-14] that is biochemically similar to one that yields 20E in crustaceans [6] (Fig. 1). In
Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in these genes disrupt
20E production and cause the arrest of embryonic development and death. spook (spo: Cyp307a1) is another member of this CYP group which when mutated results in low
20E mutants [15,16] and is believed to mediate a yet
uncharacterized step (the Black Box) in the biosynthesis
of 20E preceding those of Phm, Dib, Sad and Shd. In contrast to phm, dib, sad and shd for which each insect genome
carries one ortholog, several paralogs of spo-like (CYP307)
genes have been formed by duplications, which in turn
have evolved lineage-specific complements of these genes
[2,16,17]. For example, Drosophila has two spo-like genes,
spo and spookier (spok: Cyp307a2) [16]. These two genes are
close paralogs that are believed to mediate the same enzymatic reaction, although at different stages of development.
Although one would expect that orthologs of the insect
Halloween genes are present in crustaceans, there is no
molecular evidence for the existence of these genes in
crustaceans. We have tried for several years to probe hexapod crustaceans for Halloween gene orthologs under various hormonal regimens using degenerate primers based
on the Drosophila and Bombyx genes, but we have been
unsuccessful (K.F. Rewitz, J.T. Warren, E. Chang and L.I.
Gilbert). The development of the genome data base of the
more primitive crustacean, Daphnia pulex, allowed us to
survey this genome and conduct phylogenetic analyses
that suggest strongly that orthologs of spo, phm, dib, sad
and shd do exist in Daphnia and thus, in a crustacean i.e.
the genes appeared in arthropods before the radiation of
insects.

Results and Discussion
By searching the Daphnia data bases [18,19] we obtained
candidate sequences for orthologs of the insect Halloween
genes in Daphnia. Single orthologs of phm, dib, sad and shd
were retrieved and only one sequence exhibited significant similarity to the spo-like genes in the CYP307 family.
We also searched the genomes of non-arthropod invertebrates including the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, the
nematodes C. elegans and Brugia malayi, the annelid
Capitella capitata, the mollusk Lottia gigantea, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [19,20] for Halloween
gene orthologs using TBLASTN. Analyses of these invertebrate genomes did not result in any significant hits indicating the absence of Halloween orthologs and neither
have we been able to identify orthologs of these genes in
any of several vertebrate species.
The genes obtained from Daphnia encode approximately
500 amino acid open reading frames (ORFs) which is typically for proteins belonging to the CYP family [21]. Alignment of Daphnia sequences with orthologs of the insect
Halloween genes shows that the genes, in addition to
being conserved in areas that comprise canonical structural CYP motifs, exhibit considerable conservation in
regions that are believed to determine substrate specificity
(Additional file 1). This indicates that the genes are functionally conserved in Daphnia as they are in insects [2].
The overall amino acid identity between deduced orthologous proteins from eight insects belonging to four different orders and the Daphnia orthologs ranges from an
average of 55.2% ± 6.8 SD (standard deviation) for Spolike proteins to somewhat lower values for Sad proteins
(38.7% ± 8.8 SD). Thus, spo-like genes are the most highly
conserved of these genes and this appears to be true for
Daphnia like it is for insects. Conservation of these genes
from insect to crustaceans, which separated ~400 millions
years ago [4], shows that selection has preserved the genes
because of their function. The reason that spo-like genes
are more conserved than the other arthropod steroidogenic CYP enzymes is not known, although it may be
related to the possibility that Spo acts in the rate-limiting
Black Box reaction(s) [5,22]. If Spo is involved in control
of the flux through the pathway it may have been a particular target for selection because mutations altering its
enzyme activity would have had increased consequences
compared to mutations altering the activity of enzymes
that are less rate-limiting. A phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Daphnia sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis of Daphnia candidate orthologs
A phylogenetic tree was constructed with Daphnia
sequences retrieved from the BLAST searches and
orthologs of the insect Halloween genes from Drosophila,
red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and honey bee Apis
mellifera, which represent three different orders (Diptera,

Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, respectively) of holometabolous insects. The Daphnia gene products separate with
the insect orthologs of Spo/Spok, Phm, Dib, Sad and Shd
in this phylogenetic tree with high bootstrap support (Fig.
1). In examining the genome of Daphnia for orthologs of
these genes, we noticed no closely related paralogs to the
obtained candidate orthologs. This supports the orthology of the genes and indicates that the genes became functionally specialized before the split between crustaceans
and insects and have been under heavy selection pressure
ever since. Only one spo-like gene was obtained and this
gene is phylogenetically a CYP307A subfamily gene i.e.
most closely related to spo/spok. No ortholog of spookiest
(spot: CYP307B1) was found indicating that this gene does
not exist in Daphnia, which implies that it is insect-specific
i.e. originating from a duplication occurring after insects
arose from crustaceans [4] or that it was lost in Daphnia as
it has been in some insects e.g. lepidopterans and Drosophila species [2].
In the phylogenetic analysis, sequences of steroidogenic
CYPs from vertebrates and C. elegans were included to
probe ancestral relationships and the origin of CYPs
involved in steroid biogenesis (Fig. 1). Figure 1 includes
major groups of metazoans CYPs i.e. mitochondrial,
CYP2-related, CYP3-related, CYP4-related, CYP19s and
CYP51s. The steroidogenic CYPs of insects and their Daphnia orthologs are evolutionarily related to vertebrate and
C. elegans steroidogenic CYPs since they cluster in two
major groups, those related to CYP2 enzymes (Spo, Phm,
CYP17, CYP21 and DAF-9) and those that are mitochondrial (Dib, Sad, Shd and CYP11A1). Therefore, it is likely
that different steroidogenic CYP enzymes are derived from
common ancestors and were recruited for steroid biosynthesis prior to the protostome-deuterostome split. Evolution of these ancestral CYPs in C. elegans, arthropods and
vertebrates, by gene duplication and divergence, likely
shaped the biosynthetic pathways yielding the different
groups of steroids in these animals.
Conservation of gene structure
Comparison of intron positions of the aligned Daphnia
protein sequences and the insect orthologs of the Halloween genes shows that many introns are conserved (Fig. 2).
Each Daphnia ortholog contains conserved intron/exon
organization typical of their respective insect orthologs.
The conserved gene structure suggests that the Daphnia
genes have a common evolutionary origin with the insect
Halloween genes and support the inferred phylogenetic
relationship suggesting orthology (Fig. 1). In phm, five
introns are conserved among Daphnia and insects and
only two introns are unique to the Daphnia gene. Introns
that have no counterparts can be explained by intron gain
or alternatively these introns have been lost. Interestingly,
Daphnia spo has two introns whereas insect spo genes have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/60

only one. The position and phase (the nucleotide position
in a codon) of introns in the Daphnia spo gene are equivalent to those conserved in insect spot genes. However, the
Daphnia sequence is the closest ortholog of the insect spo/
spok genes phylogenetically, and only shares one of these
conserved introns. A likely evolutionary scenario is that
the ancestral gene was a spo gene containing both introns
(Fig. 3). In the insect lineage, after the split from crustaceans, duplication of this gene resulted in two copies that
diverged into spo and spot paralogs after which one intron
was lost in the insect spo genes.
Although several introns are conserved among the mitochondrial dib, sad and shd, introns that are unique to each
group of orthologs (e.g. the first phase 1 intron in dib and
shd) indicate an orthologous relationship to the respective
groups. The conserved gene structure of these genes suggests that they evolved from a common ancestor of mitochondrial CYPs by duplications and diverged into the
steroidogenic enzymes that are functionally specialized to
carry out the last three steps in which C22, C2 and C20
hydroxylations form 20E. This implies, at least in part,
that the biosynthetic pathway evolved step-wise by duplication and functional divergence of the biosynthetic
enzymes. In vertebrates, functional divergence and specialization of steroidogenic CYPs are known from studies
of the CYP11 paralogs. CYP11A1 is the enzyme that mediates the removal of the side chain of cholesterol [23].
CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 are paralogs, from a recent duplication, that became functionally specialized as the steroid
11β-hydroxylase and the aldosterone synthase, respectively [24]. dib, sad and shd also exhibit conservation of
gene structure when compared to vertebrate mitochondrial CYPs involved in steroidogenesis [2].
Microsynteny supports orthology
The conserved arrangement of genes on the chromosome
of different species (microsynteny) can be used to infer
phylogenetic relationships that support the orthology of
genes [2,17]. Analysis of local genome structures surrounding the Halloween genes shows little conservation
of microsynteny between insects and crustaceans. This is
likely due to the relatively great evolutionary time separating insects from crustaceans. However, remnants showing
microsynteny can be found in at least two cases. CYP18A1
is a paralog of phm which is found in Drosophila and most
other insects [25]. In Drosophila and Apis, phm and
CYP18A1 are arranged tail-to-tail and adjacent to these
genes are CG6696 and fused (Fig. 2). In Daphnia, the
microsyntenic relationship of phm and CYP18A1 is conserved, although CG6696 and fused appear to have been
rearranged to different chromosomal locations.

Comparison of gene organization in a region of approximately 100 kb surrounding the spo(k) locus reveals that

within a codon: phase 0 between codons, phase 1 after the first base and phase 2 after the second base), on the aligned proteins, are shown as conserved by connecting vertical lines. Insect introns represent introns found in species of insects previously described [2], except Tribolium shd which exhibits unique introns that are not shown. B) Preserved microsynteny in local
genome regions surrounding phm and spo(k). The arrangement of phm and its paralog CYP18A1 is conserved in insects and
Daphnia and so is the microsyntenic relationship of spo (spok in Drosophila) and neverland (nvd). Nvd is believed to be involved
in the conversion of cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol (7dC), the step preceding the Black Box in which Spo/Spok may function [16,26]. The transcriptional direction of the genes is shown by arrowheads. The double arrowhead indicates that ApepP is
in opposite orientations in Drosophila and Anopheles.

spo is adjacent to neverland (nvd) [26] in Daphnia and the
mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Analysis of the genome
region of spo-like genes in species of Drosophila (available
at FlyBase [27]) shows that in Drosophila pseudoobscura,
Drosophila willistoni and Drosophila mojavensis nvd is
located within 60 kb of spok. This is in agreement with the
view that spok is the ancestral gene in Drosophilidae.
Intriguingly, Nvd is a conserved Rieske-like oxygenase
believed to be involved in the conversion of cholesterol to
7-dehydrocholesterol in insects and C. elegans [26,28]. In
insects, this is presumably the first step in the biosynthetic
pathway of 20E from cholesterol via 7-dehydrocholesterol, the latter being the substrate that enters the Black
Box, in which Spo/Spok likely participate (although at different developmental stages) to produce the substrate for

Phm, the ketodiol (Fig. 1). Although unequivocal evidence for the exact function of Nvd and Spo/Spok is lacking, experiments utilizing ecdysteroid precursors to rescue
mutant phenotypes (RNAi-induced for nvd and spok) suggest that in Drosophila nvd and spo/spok genes function in
these two succeeding steps in the biochemical pathway
[16,26]. However, it must be emphasized that the Black
Box may hold more than one reaction and more than one
enzyme may be participating in this conversion [5].

Conclusion
Currently, it is clear that CYPs are involved in steroid biosynthesis in vertebrates and invertebrates. In C. elegans,
insects and vertebrates, the majority of steroidogenic CYPs
are related to one of two groups, the CYP2 enzymes and

Lineage-specific duplications and losses of spo-like genes in Daphnia and insects
Figure 3
Lineage-specific duplications and losses of spo-like genes in Daphnia and insects. An evolutionary scenario based on
the observed distribution of spo-like (CYP307) genes in arthropods. Since insects are believed to have evolved from crustaceans
living in freshwater environments [4] and the only spo-like gene observed in Daphnia belongs to the CYP307A subfamily, the
ancestral arthropod spo gene was likely a CYP307A gene. An early duplication, which probably occurred after insects diverged
from crustaceans, gave rise to spo (CYP307A1) and spot (CYP307B1). In Drosophila, the ancestral spo-like gene, referred to as
spok (Cyp307a2), underwent a second round of duplication in which an intronless retrogene arose. In Drosophila this gene is
referred to as spo. Note that another round of gene duplication, which occurred in the line of Drosophila evolution leading to
the subgenus Drosophila [17], is not shown.

the mitochondrial CYPs. It is therefore likely that these
steroidogenic CYPs evolved from common ancestors
which had the capacity to modify cholesterol before the
split of these animals. This implies that the distinct biosynthetic pathways in these metazoans, which convert
cholesterol to different types of steroids, likely result from
lineage-specific evolution of ancestral steroidogenic CYPs.
The results suggest strongly that steroidogenic CYP
enzymes mediating the biosynthesis of 20E are present in
crustaceans and are relegated to the Arthropoda. Therefore, these enzymes probably became functionally specialized in the line leading to arthropods. Although
functional characterization of the gene products, such as
that done for the insect Halloween genes [1,29], is
required to obtain unequivocal evidence of their role in
20E production in Daphnia, the present data provide the
first evidence for steroidogenic CYP genes in crustaceans
as well as the groundwork for future functional genomic
analyses in the field of crustacean endocrinology.

Methods
Data base search
The Daphnia pulex genome sequence (v1.0) made available by the Daphnia Genomics Consortium and the DOE
Joint Genome Institute [19] was mined for orthologs of
the insect Halloween genes using TBLASTN searches. Apis
and Tribolium sequences, previously described in Rewitz et
al. [2], were used as queries to identify homologous
sequences in the Daphnia data base. Sequences of insect
Halloween genes, previously described in Rewitz et al. [2],
were gleaned from FlyBase [27] and Rene Feyereisen's
website for insect CYPs [30]. C. elegans and vertebrate CYP
protein sequences were acquired from NCBI [20].
Phylogenetic tree construction, intron positions and
microsynteny analysis
Predicted Daphnia orthologs of the insect Halloween
genes were analyzed using a phylogenetic tree with insect
Halloween genes from insects belonging to three different

orders, Apis (Hymenoptera), Tribolium (Coleoptera) and
Drosophila (Diptera). To infer phylogenetic relationships
of these steroidogenic CYPs with other members of this
multigene family, steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic
CYPs representing some of the major groups of metazoan
CYPs were included in this analysis i.e. mitochondrial,
CYP2-related, CYP3-related and CYP4s, CYP19 and
CYP51. Deduced Daphnia protein sequences used in the
alignment can be found in Additional file 2. A multiple
alignment of the protein sequences was constructed with
ClustalX (1.83) [31] and manually edited using SeaView
[32]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from this alignment using the Maximum Likelihood method under the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model using
PHYML (v2.4.5) [33]. Support values were obtained by
bootstrapping 100 replicates. Branches with bootstrap
support below 50 were collapsed to form polytomies.
Gene structure, that is, intron position and phase (the
nucleotide position of the intron within a codon: phase 0
between codons, phase 1 after the first base and phase 2
after the second base) were predicted from manual annotation of the Daphnia genes with support from expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) data and by homology to insect Halloween genes for which gene structures are known. Intron
position and phase were mapped onto a multiple alignment to investigate conservation of intron/exon structure
in relation to phylogeny.
Additional support for orthology of Daphnia and insect
genes was sought by analyses of microsynteny (conserved
order of genes). Genome regions surrounding the candidate Halloween orthologs of Daphnia and several insects
were inspected for ORFs encoding conserved genes. Putative gene orthologs exhibiting conserved arrangement in
relation to the Halloween orthologs were tested for
orthology by reciprocal best hit Blast searches in which
orthologs of each species were BLAST searched against the
genome of the other species to look for best hits (putative
orthologs).
