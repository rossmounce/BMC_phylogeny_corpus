Abstract
Background: Homology is a key concept in both evolutionary biology and genomics. Detection
of homology is crucial in fields like the functional annotation of protein sequences and the
identification of taxon specific genes. Basic homology searches are still frequently performed by
pairwise search methods such as BLAST. Vast improvements have been made in the identification
of homologous proteins by using more advanced methods that use sequence profiles. However
additional improvement could be made by exploiting sources of genomic information other than
the primary sequence or tertiary structure.
Results: We test the hypothesis that extrinsic gene properties gene length and gene order can be
of help in differentiating spurious sequence similarity from homology in the gray zone. Sharing gene
order and similarity in size dramatically increase the chance of a query-hit pair being homologous:
gray zone query-hit pairs of similar size and with conserved gene order are homologous in 99% of
all cases, while for query-hit pairs without gene order conservation and with different sizes this is
only 55%.
Conclusion: We have shown that using gene length and gene order drastically improves the
detection of homologs within the BLAST gray zone. Our findings suggest that the use of such
extrinsic gene properties can also improve the performance of homology detection by more
advanced methods, and our study thereby underscores the importance of true data integration for
fully exploiting genomic information.

Background
Homology is a key concept in both evolutionary biology
and genomics. Homology designates a relationship of
common descent between entities. In genomics,
homologs are genes or genomics regions sharing a common origin, related through speciation, duplication or a
combination of both. Orthology is a specific case of
homology, in which genes in different species evolved
from a common ancestral gene through speciation [1].

The identification of homologous proteins is an important step in predicting the function of proteins that have
not been studied experimentally and is crucial in comparative genomics studies. Identification of taxon-specific
genes and estimation of the rate of gene genesis all rely on
the detection of orthology (and thus homology). Rapid
sequence divergence can obscure the real evolutionary
relationship between genes [2], a scenario that could

result in an overestimation of the contribution of the
emergence of taxon-specific genes.
Algorithms like BLAST detect sequence similarity [3].
Many insignificant (by e-value) BLAST hits are nevertheless homologs. Increased sensitivity can be obtained by
using more sophisticated methods, such as more accurate
search algorithms like PSI-BLAST [4] and hidden Markov
models (HMMs) [5]. These methods have allowed for
large improvements in the identification of homologous
proteins compared to BLAST, yet detection of homology
might also be improved by using information not derived
from the primary sequence of proteins. From here on such
information is referred to as label information. We test the
hypothesis that label information can make an important
contribution in the detection of homology.
In order to estimate the significance of label information,
we need both a method for the initial detection of
sequence similarity as well as a golden standard against
which we can measure the improvements made by the use
of label information. The use of BLAST provides us with a
commonly used method for the detections of homology,
while at the same time leaving room for improvement,
allowing us to use methods like HMMs as a golden standard to benchmark gray zone BLAST hits.
The first label we investigate in this study is gene order. In
the absence of changes in gene order (i.e. if no rearrangement, deletion or duplication of genes were to occur),
even genes with no detectable sequence but sharing gene
order would be homologous. Gene order has been proven
to be a useful tool in the identification of homologs with
low sequence similarity, as illustrated for non-coding
RNA genes [6]. We test the hypothesis that proteins sharing gene order and identified in a BLAST search as being
weakly similar in sequence (gray zone hits) are more
likely to be homologous than proteins with the same
sequence similarity that do not share gene order. The reasoning for the second label we study, protein length, is
similar. Unless gene fusion or fission events have taken
place, gene sharing a common ancestor and retaining the
same fold should be similar in length. A substantial difference in length between two proteins suggests a difference
in three dimensional structure, in turn suggesting a different evolutionary origin; two proteins with similar sizes are
more likely to be homologs than two proteins with a relatively large difference in size.
Here we test whether label information can play an
important role in the identification of homologs in the
gray zone. We use the prokaryotic protein sequences from
the COG database [7] as dataset in an all-against-all
BLAST, and the PFAM database as a golden standard. We
discuss the implications of our findings for the detection

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/356

of sequence homology with more advanced methods, the
identification of taxon specific genes, and the importance
of true data integration.

Results
The value of label information
Here we test the expectation that label information can
play an important role in the identification of homologs
in the gray zone by comparing the results of an all-againstall BLAST search of the proteins from the COG database
to data from the PFAM database. The gray-zone of BLAST
is not systematically defined; normally, it represents a
range of values starting directly above some e-value
threshold up to BLAST's default maximum e-value of 10.
We here refrain from directly designating a grey zone and
instead vary the e-value threshold. For values which are
normally considered grey-zone, we then observe as
expected that a substantial portion of hits are not homologous according to PFAM: 65% of the BLAST hits with an
e-value above 1e-03 but below 10 are homologous
according to PFAM clans, and only 43% of the hits are
homologous at e-values between 1 and 10. In contrast,
over 99% of the hits below a threshold of 1e-03 are
homologous according to PFAM clans, also as expected.

If we now take into account gene order, we observe that
the percentage of homologous hit pairs is increased dramatically when query and target share gene order (Figure
1A); for example, 98% of the gray-zone query-hit pairs
with conserved gene order are homologous, compared to
69% of the pairs without conserved gene order. In other
words, we go from a fraction of false positives of 0.31 to
only 0.02, a 15-fold reduction in the fraction of false positives. Gene length shows similar behaviour (Figure 1B):
query-hit pairs of similar size (the length of the smallest
protein at least 80% of that of the largest protein) are
homologous in 87% of all cases, while for pairs with a
large difference in size (40%–60%) this is 56%. We thus
go from a fraction of false positives of 0.44 to 0.13, a 3fold reduction in the fraction of false positives.
Combining gene order and gene size (Figure 1C) further
increases the differentiation between homologous queryhit pairs and spurious BLAST hits. Query-hit pairs with
gene order conservation and with similar sizes (80%–
100%) are homologous in over 99% of all cases, while for
query-hit pairs of different sizes (40%–60%) and without
conserved gene order this is 55% (Figure 1C). Expressed as
a reduction in the fraction of false positives, this improvement is quite high: from 0.45 to 0.01 is a 45 fold reduction. Note that because of the relatively small number of
genes with conserved gene order (more on this below) the
inclusion of gene order does not have a big impact on the
precision when looking at the fraction of homologous

pairs with a large size difference (56% for all pairs, 55%
for the pairs without conserved gene order).
Comparing the contributions of conserved gene order and
size similarity
The data presented above shows that both having conserved gene order and being of similar size increases the
chance of gray-zone BLAST hits being homologous. Size
and gene order do not offer the same increase in confidence; having conserved gene order means an increase in
the percentage of homologous query-hit pairs from 42%
to 93% for pairs scoring between 1 and 10, while being of
similar size means an increase from 32% to 70% (Figures
1A and 1B). On the other hand, only 3% of the query-hit
pairs with an e-value between 1 and 10 have conserved
gene order, while 42% of the pairs in this score bin belong
to the size bin of proteins most similar in length (Figures
2A and 2B). In summary, the proportion of query-hit pairs
with conserved gene order is smaller, but when encountered conserved gene order is more informative than
being of similar size.
Estimating the number of additional homologs that can be
detected
In order to estimate the number of additional BLAST hits
that the use of label information yields, we employ a heuristic framework to determine the equivalent e-value for a

score and relative size. To normalize for the wide variation in number of hits per query protein, a query-hit pair

bin. Figure 2A shows the number of pairs with and without

search with and without label information. The equivalent e-value is determined approximately as follows: For
each BLAST e-value threshold, hits scoring below that
threshold have a certain chance of being homologous (as
represented by the positive predictive value, see methods).
The same positive predictive value is observed at higher evalues for blast hits with similar length compared to normal blast hits (Figure 3A). We call these two different evalue thresholds that give the same performance equivalent, and they allow us to translate the e-value of normal
BLAST hit to the equivalent e-value of a BLAST hit with
similar length. For example, the positive predictive value
of a BLAST search with an e-value threshold of 1e-03 is
0.998 (in other words, approximately 0.2% of the hits
scoring below 1e-03 are not homologous). When we now
take BLAST hits with the same gene size, this PPV is
attained at e-value 1.4e-02. Using this translated e-value
we can show how many more blast hits one can find using
label information while maintaining the same performance. Figure 3B shows the number of BLAST hits that can
be recovered using equivalent e-values and the labels gene
order and gene size. For e-value thresholds from 1e-02 to
1e-12, between 6% and 12% extra hits are found when we
use label information.
Examples
The protein MA1298 from Methanosarcina acetivorans has
no significant BLAST hits (e-value < 1e-02). MA1298 is
not part of any orthologous groups of the COG database,
while one of its BLAST hits, the protein APE1895 from
Aeropyrum pernix, belongs to COG1955, which contains

We defined the equivalent e-value of a specific label as the e-value threshold that gives the same positive predictive value as a

number of homologs per query when equivalent e-values are used as thresholds in cases where genes of a query-hit pair share

proteins involved in flagella biosynthesis. Since the two
proteins share gene order (both have a neighbour belonging to COG0630, a group containing transport proteins
involved in flagella biosynthesis) and are similar in size
(APE1895 is 85% of the size of MA1298), we expect
MT0685 to be homologous to the proteins from this
COG. We confirmed this using PSI-BLAST: after 3 iterations with APE1895 as query, MA1298 is hit with an evalue of 7e-49. A phylogenetic tree of MA1298 and the
proteins comprising COG1955 shows MA1298 to be
orthologous to the proteins belonging to COG1955 (Figure 4). Thus because of conserved gene order and similarity in size we not only recognize the BLAST hits of
MT0685 as homologs despite their high e-value, we are
also able to improve the COG database. This observation
does not diminish the usefulness of COG, which is created automatically and provides a comprehensive definition of orthologous groups, while the example given
above is the result of manual selection and analysis.
Rather, this example illustrates that gene order and gene
size can be used in parallel to other methods such as
BLAST.
A well-known problem in the detection of homology
using sequence profiles is the threshold effect: creating a
sequence profile and setting a threshold that excludes all
non-homologous sequences while at the same still recog-

nizing all homologs can be very difficult. To illustrate the
value of gene order and gene length in such scenarios, we
mined our data set for gray-zone query-hit pairs of similar
size and with conserved gene order, but where only one of
the two proteins is hit by a PFAM model. These pairs were
left out of our original analysis, as for these pairs we can
not reliably automatically establish if they are homologous according to our golden standard. The protein
SA0534 from Staphylococcus aureus hits the protein
AGl121 from Agrobacterium tumefacie (e-value: 0.6).
SA0534 is member of protein family PF00108 (Thiolase),
while AGl121 is not a member of any protein family.
However, conservation of gene order and similarity in
length suggest that the proteins are homologous. Again
we could confirm this using PSI-BLAST: after 3 iterations
SA0534 hits AGl121 with an e-value of 2e-52. A multiple
sequence alignment of AGl121 with the members of
PF00108 shows the cysteine residue experimentally
proven to be essential for thiolase activity [8] to be conserved.

Discussion
The value of label information
We have shown that query-hit pairs of similar size and
sharing gene order are much more likely to be homologous than pairs less similar in size and not sharing gene
order. Obviously, this effect is most dramatic for gray-

zone hits: query-hit pairs without gene order conservation
and with different sizes (the length of the smallest protein
between 40% and 60% of that of the largest protein) are
homologous in only 55% of all cases, while for query-hit
pairs of similar size (80%–100%) and conserved gene
order this is 99% (Figure 1). For an e-value threshold
between 1e-02 and 1e-12, the use of the labels gene size
and gene order provides an average increase in the
number of hits ranging from 6% to 12% (Figure 3B).
Using label information can mean the difference between
ignoring a gray zone BLAST hit as spurious and recognizing a distant homolog.
The small fraction of gray zone query-hit pairs with conserved gene order compared to gray zone hits of similar
size (Table 1B,C) means that conserved gene order has
less impact on the overall picture. In addition, an a priori
advantage of length as a label over conserved gene context
is that the use of conserved gene order is in practice limited to prokaryotes, because in eukaryotes gene order
evolves relatively fast compared to protein sequences [9].
Note that the use of gene order in this context is not so
obvious, because it does not equal the use of conserved
gene order for function prediction, such as it is applied in
genomic context methods [10,11]. In fact conserved gene
order would not even have been detected if only blast
were used (as is often the case), as one of the genes in a
pair of neighbouring genes does not have a significant

blast hit in the other species. The use of gene order as a
label is here thus the reverse approach of the genomic
context method: we suppose the conservation of gene
order as a clue.
Fusion of proteins
As the COG database offers an orthology prediction we
could use for the detection of conserved gene order, and
because of the summary of an all-against-all BLAST provided with the database, we used the proteins from COG
as a starting point. A potential problem with this dataset
is the presence of fusion proteins in the COG database as
separate entries [7]. We investigated the effect of this lack
of fusion proteins on size similarity as a relevant label by
concatenating the relevant protein entries our analysis
with this alternative set. The results show proteins size to
be a relevant label for recognizing gray zone homologs
also in datasets containing fusion proteins.
Methods other than BLAST
BLAST is applied extensively, yet in many scenarios more
advanced methods are more suitable. The observation
that label information can be of great value in interpreting
the results of a BLAST search could be extrapolated to
more advanced methods. A somewhat trivial example of
this is given in the results section, where we show via label
information that two sequences likely belong to the same
PFAM family, even though only one of them is hit by the
PFAM model above the inclusion bitscore threshold. In
related work [12], the label taxonomy is shown to
enhance the detection of PFAM domains.

In the field of distant homology detection, the challenge
has become the detection of homologous domains (e.g.
profile vs. profile alignment and fold prediction [13,14]).
The applicability of the labels for this field might be difficult, but we think the label protein length could perhaps
be fairly directly translated to the length of conserved
domains. It is very unlikely to find such a direct analogy
for conserved gene order, but more tenuous analogs could
be found among the co-occurrence [15] and relative order
of domains in a protein, or to the more general concept of
functional links, such as co-expression or participating in
the same pathway (thus implicitly assuming the duplication of functional modules). Note also that investigating
the value of label information for more advanced methods such as PSI-BLAST provides a practical challenge in
the sense that it requires an even more reliable method or
database to provide a golden standard.
Implications
One of the scenarios in which improved homology detection and thus label information can have a big impact is
the estimation of percentage of so-called novel genes:
genes for which no homologs could be identified in other

organisms. BLAST is often the method of choice for the
detection of genes specific to a species or taxon [16-18], as
BLAST can make use of all available sequences, while
many methods based on sequence models like PFAM and
SCOP [19,20] do not cover the full spectrum of available
sequence data. Almost two-thirds of the proteins encoded
by the genome of Plasmodium falciparum did not have sufficient similarity to proteins in other organisms to justify
provision of functional assignment, which led the authors
to state that two-thirds of the proteins appear to be unique
to the organism [21]. The use of label information would
allow a more accurate identification of proteins that in
fact do have homologs in the set of proteins with only
gray zone BLAST hits, in turn leading to a decrease in the
fraction of unique proteins.
There has been a call for so-called true data integration
[22]: tools and databases should not only combine different types of biological data in the sense that they provide
access to different types of analysis or data sources
through a single interface, they should in fact combine
different types of data to come to a single answer taking
into account as much of the available data as possible.
This would, in the case of BLAST and the labels gene size
and gene order, be a tool that combines a similarity
search, gene size, and information on genome organization into a statistical framework that produces a single
score representing the likelihood of a hit being homologous to the query. The use of other labels like co-expression and phylogeny requires an extensive integration of
databases and tools, yet as we have shown the gain is
potentially substantial.

Methods
Sequence information and analysis
Protein sequences were taken from the COG database [7].
As one of the two labels we are interested in is gene order
conservation, and gene order evolves more slowly in bacteria [9], we excluded the three genomes of eukaryotes,
leaving us with 63 bacterial genomes with a total of
192987 protein sequence. Gene order information was
taken from Genbank [23] after mapping COG identifiers
to Genbank gene identifiers. Gene order was considered
to be conserved when two genes have one or more neighbours belonging to the same COG. We used BLAST [4] for
the detection of sequence similarity. Where possible we
took advantage of the pre-calculated BLAST data provided
by the COG database. Information on protein families
was taken from version 20.0 of the PFAM database [19].
In the cases where an exact match of a protein in our data
set could not be identified in the PFAM database, we
assigned protein families using HMMer [5] and the models provided by PFAM; in all other cases we used the precalculated results distributed with the database. Multiple

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/356

sequence alignments were made with MUSCLE [24], phylogenetic trees were constructed using PhyML [25].
Measuring the value of label information
We measured the value of the label information in identifying homologous by binning all query-hit pairs from the
all-against-all BLAST provided with the COG database by
e-value and similarity in protein length (defined as the relative size of the smallest protein of a query-hit pair compared the largest in %). For each bin we counted the
homologous pairs sharing gene order, the homologous
pairs not sharing gene order, the not-homologous pairs
sharing gene order and the not-homologous pairs not
sharing gene order. Numbers of hits were normalized by
dividing by the number of hits in that category of a query
protein by the total number of hits of that query in order
to prevent large protein families (which have many very
similar hits) from skewing the results. The chance that the
two proteins of a query-hit pair in a specific score bin and
with specific label properties are homologous (also called
the positive predictive value (PPV) or precision) was calculated by dividing the number of homologous pairs
(true positives) by sum of the number of homologous
pairs and the number of non-homologous pairs (true positives + false positives).

Our methodology requires both a golden standard for
defining homologous proteins as well as a standard for
defining non-homologous proteins. Pairs were considered homologous when the proteins belong to the same
protein family (as defined by the PFAM database) or to
protein families belonging to the same clan [19], while
pairs were considered to be non-homologous when they
were part of protein families not belonging to the same
clan. The number of false negatives was reduced by
excluding pairs belonging to different PFAM clans while at
the same time belonging to the same orthologous group
of the COG database. Query-hit pairs formed by one or
two proteins not belonging to any protein family were left
out of the analysis; this keeps protein pairs that are in fact
homologous, but that are not covered by any of the models in the PFAM database, as well as proteins that are hit
by a PFAM model but fall just below the gathering threshold established by PFAM, from being counted as nonhomologous.
