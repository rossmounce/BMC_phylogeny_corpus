HIV-2 disease progression and transmission is attenuated
compared to HIV-1, yet prospective studies examining
HIV-2 intrapatient evolution have been limited. We examined viral sequence evolution in the C2V3C3 region of the
viral env gene in 8 HIV-2 infected individuals from Dakar,
Senegal, over the course of approximately 10 years. To
compare results to HIV-1 infection, we reanalyzed data
from our previous study that examined intrapatient evolution in HIV-1 infected individuals from the same population. HIV-2 sequences from early and late timepoints were
phylogenetically intermixed for all subjects, and no distinct trends were observed in terms of increases or
decreases in fragment size or number of N-linked glycosylation sites. In homologous env C2V3 sequence, rates of
viral divergence and diversification were slower in individuals infected with HIV-2 than individuals with HIV-1.
This data indicates that viral evolution occurs slowly in
HIV-2 infection, which is consistent with the slow disease
progression observed in HIV-2 infection, and supports the
notion that viral evolution may be a relevant correlate for
disease progression.
