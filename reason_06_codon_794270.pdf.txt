Abstract
It has been suggested that codon insertion and/or deletion may represent a mechanism that, along
with hypermutation, contributes to the affinity maturation of antibodies. We used repertoire
cloning to examine human antibodies directed against 3 carbohydrate antigens and 1 protein
antigen for the presence of such modifications. We find that both the insertion and deletion of
codons occur frequently in antigen-specific responses following vaccination. Codon insertions and
deletions were observed most often in the complementarity determining regions, and less
frequently in the framework regions, of VH, Vκ, and Vλ gene segments, and involved motifs known
to be preferred targets of somatic hypermutation. Clonal lineage analysis shows that these events
occur through out the course of the somatic maturation of individual antibody clones. We also
determined that these alterations of paratope structure have varying effects on the relative affinity
of the binding site for its cognate antigen.

Background
The naïve antibody repertoire arises from the combinational joining of various immunoglobulin gene segments
during the antigen-independent maturation of B cells [1].
In the germinal centers (GC) of peripheral lymphoid
organs, recently activated B cells encounter accessory cells,
T cells, and antigen, and in this environment begin the
process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch
recombination (CSR). [2]. SHM introduces non-random
point mutations into the variable (V) regions of both the
heavy (H) and light (L) gene segments. The mechanism of
SHM is incompletely understood, but is known to be

mediated by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine
deaminase (AID)[3], to target particular sequence motifs
with the V gene segments. [2], and is believed to involve
double-stranded breaks in the target DNA at the sites
modified [4-6]. SHM serves to generate derivative B cell
clones with increased, decreased, or unchanged affinity
for the stimulating antigen. Clones with increased affinity
are presumably preferentially expanded, and give rise to
plasma cells secreting serum antibody. These post-rearrangement modifications may also further expand the primary paratopic repertoire available to the host.

In addition to base-pair substitutions, there are several
reports of antibodies in which germline V-gene codons
have been deleted from the coding region as well as
reports in which extra, non-templated codons have been
inserted into the coding region of the VH and/or VL gene
segments. Such insertions and/or deletions (I/Ds) have
been shown to occur in several human B cell malignancies
[7-9], in germinal center B cells [10,11], in human hybridomas [12], and in peripheral blood B cells [13]. The cooccurrence of these modifications with base-pair substitutions that appear to have arisen from SHM suggest that I/
Ds may be a normal consequence of the somatic maturation of antibody responses. The extent to which I/Ds contribute to antigen-specific responses in humans has not
been addressed. In this study we used repertoire cloning
to examine human antibodies directed against both carbohydrate and protein antigens for the presence of I/Ds,
and find that both events occur frequently in antigen-specific responses following vaccination.

Results
Insertions and deletions occur frequently in human
antibodies of diverse specificity
We have used repertoire cloning to examine, at the molecular level, the antigen-specific human antibody repertoires directed towards the capsular polysaccharides (PPS)
of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6B, 14, and 23F
[14,15], and the protective antigen (protein) of Bacillus
anthracis (PA) that arise following vaccination. In the
course of this comparative analysis, several antibody Fab
fragments were isolated in which the VH or VL regions
had been modified through the insertion or deletion of
codons as compared to their germline sequence of origin.
These modifications (I/Ds) were observed in Fabs specific
for PPS 6B (3 of 7 donors), PPS 23F (3 of 6 donors), PPS
14 (2 of 3 donors), and PA (single donor) (Table 1).
Taken together, 12 of the 124 independent H and L rearrangements analyzed from these donors (9.7%) contained I/D events. Insertions were 1 or 2 residues in
length; deletions varied from 1 to 6 residues in length
(Table 2). I/D modifications were found in Vκ, Vλ, and
VH regions of the Fabs. Deletions were only noted in the
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) while
insertions occurred in both the CDRs and frameworks
(FR) 1 and 2. The identification of I/D events in the VH
CDR3 region is problematic, as this loop often lacks a
direct germline element for comparison. The isolation of
10 clonally-related VH 3–23 encoded PPS 6B-specific Fabs
from donor 23 has allowed us to determine that deletions
occur in this CDR as well. The presence of shared mutations and highly homologous CDR3s indicate a common
origin for all of the donor 023 VH3-23 V-gene segments.
One clone (023.16B11, Table 3), however, has deleted 4
codons immediately adjacent to the JH5 region.

To verify that the I/Ds reported herein were physiologic
events and did not arise during the PCR procedures used
to produce antibody clones, antibody V regions containing I/Ds were re-isolated from residual cDNA used to
make the original libraries. For 2 heavy chains containing
deletions (023.9E5 and 023.14H10) and for 1 heavy
chain containing an insertion (008.4B7) sufficient material remained following library construction to serve as
template for an additional PCR. Primers were designed to
hybridize with the unique CDR3 regions of these 3 clones,
and used paired with the optimal upstream primer to rePCR the remaining cDNA. Analysis was limited to H
chains in order to take advantage of the unique CDR3
sequences. In all three cases, VH regions identical, both in
terms of I/Ds and point mutations, to those reported in
Table 3 and 4 were re-isolated from the appropriate
cDNA, thereby rendering PCR error unlikely as the source
of I/Ds in these clones.
I/Ds occur at RGYW/WRCY motifs
Single base-pair substitutions that occur within the V
regions of immunoglobulin genes during the course of
SHM tend to occur at "hotspots" defined by RGYW/WRCY
sequence motifs [26]. I/Ds identified in randomly selected
immunoglobulin chains have also been associated with
these same motifs [27], suggesting that the mechanism
that generates I/Ds may utilize the same enzymatic mechanism as the more common point mutations. In this
study, the location of I/Ds was highly correlated with
RGYW/WRCY motifs (Table 3, 4). All insertions were

found to be located within local sequences that satisfied
this motif, regardless of the specificity of the Fab or the
isotype of the chain modified. However, such sequence
motifs occur frequently within the CDRs. It is of note,
therefore, that the 3 insertions we identified within the
framework regions (clones 011.11A11, 023.20H2, and
018.6G5) also occur within RGYW motifs. Four of the six
deletions we identified in this study were also located
within RGYW motifs. The analysis of deletions is compromised, however, since it is not possible to know the
sequence of the deleted region. In clone 023.16B11, for
example, if codon 100h, CTT, had mutated to GTT prior
to the deletion, a RGYW motif (AGTT) would have been
created at the site of the deletion.
Insertions duplicate adjacent codons
In all cases inserted codons duplicate those immediately
5' or 3' to the insertion (Table 4). This is valid for single
codon insertions (clones 011.11A11, 023.20H2,
027.064) as well as those with 2 codon insertions (clones
003.6F2, 018.6G5, and 008.4B7). This high degree of
homology, especially in the case of double insertions,
strongly implies that the inserted codon(s) are templated
on those immediately adjacent to the site of insertion. In
one case (008.4B7) the homology involves a mutated
codon, and the insertion may have occurred following the
mutation. However, the AGT to AAT mutation in codon
31 of this Fab would have eliminated the imbedded AGTT
motif containing the insertion.
Deletions may also be templated by adjacent codons
In the 3 instances of multiple codon deletions (clones
023.9E5, 010.3H11, and 023.16B11) the most 3' deleted

codon is homologous to the codon preceding the deletion
(Table 3). For clone 023.16B11 this homology was generated by mutation of the preceding codon (position 100e,
Table 3). This homology has been noted by others
[12,27], and suggest a mechanism consistent with that
originally proposed by Streisinger [28] in which polymerase slippage facilitates the formation of a loop in the template strand that fails to be copied in subsequent rounds
of replication. As stated above, however, the analysis of
deletions is compromised by the necessity of assuming
germline sequence in the deleted region.
I/Ds occur over the course of SHM
In 4 donors, multiple, clonally-related but sequenceunique VH or VL chains were isolated that allowed the
analysis of I/D events in the context of ongoing SHM.
Three PPS 23F-specific Fabs were isolated from donor 018
that utilized VH3-7 H chains paired with A23-encoded L
chains. The VH regions of these Fabs were identical in
CDR3, shared 10 mutations as compared to the VH3-7
germline sequence, were rearranged to JH4b, and appear
to have arisen from the same initial VDJ rearrangement
event. Two of these Fabs had 2 codon insertions in the
FR1 region of the H chain (represented by clone 018.6G5,
Table 4); the remaining Fab lacked insertions in the VH
region. The sequence similarity of the 3 chains suggest
that SHM had begun in this clone prior to the insertion
event, and continued following the event. From donor
003, 9 unique Fabs were isolated that were specific for PPS
6B and utilized clonally related VH3-15 encoded VH
regions. Although unique in sequence, all H chains shared
the majority of their mutations, were highly homologous
in CDR3, and had rearranged with JH5b. All but one of

these chains had a 2-codon insertion in CDR2 (represented by clone 003.6F2, Table 4). The clone lacking the
insertion (003.7D8) shared 15 of 28 mutations with other
members of the family, as well as the CDR3 characteristics
described above. Examination of Clustal multiple-alignment guide trees generated for these sequences (Figure
1A) indicates that the insertion event occurred early in the
SHM-induced divergence of the clones. A similar analysis
of the V1-4 lambda L chain family (9 unique members) of
6B-specific clones isolated from donor 023 indicates the
single chain containing the insertion in FR2 arose late in
the differentiation of this clone (Figure 1B). Clone 20H2
shares 23 of 26 mutations with other members of the
group, and differs from its closest relative lacking the
insertion by only 3 mutations. The insertion event therefore appears to have occurred late in the somatic maturational history of this clone. 5 clonally related B3-utilizing
PPS 6B specific clones were isolated from donor 010. One
of these (010.3H11, Table 3) had deleted 6 codons in the
L chain CDR1. All chains shared an identical insertion at
the Vκ/Jκ junction as well as several mutations, and were
all rearranged to Jκ1 (an additional B3 isolate from this
donor shared no mutations and had rearranged to Jκ4
indicating it was the product of a separate rearrangement
event). Clustal alignment and analysis (Fig 1C) indicated
that in this series, the deletion event occurred midway
through the course of SHM, with mutations accumulating
both before and after the deletion of the 6 residues in
CDR1. Taken together, the analysis of these 4 Fab families
indicates that the I/D events were temporally associated
with SHM, and did not occur during V/J and V/D/J rearrangements, when double-strand breaks are known to
occur [1].
A.

I/Ds have varying effect on affinity for antigen
Insertions and deletions into the CDR regions alter the
canonical loop structure of the combining site [29], and
have the potential to radically effect antigen binding. To
determine the affect such alterations have on relative
affinity for the antigen, I/D events were restored to their
presumed germline configuration for two selected clones
and antigen binding quantitated for the subsequent Fabs.
Fab 003.6F2 was engineered to remove the 2 codon insertion in H chain CDR2 and PPS 6B binding measured (figure 2A). The removal of the insertions reduced the relative
affinity of the Fab for PPS 6B approximately 5 fold, indicating that the in vivo modification had served to generate
a more avid combining site. When similar methodologies
were used to re-insert the 6 codon deletion in 010.3H11 L
chain CDR1 however, little if any effect was seen on the
affinity of the Fab for PPS 6B (Figure 2B). As stated above,
inferences made from experiment in which deleted residues were restored are compromised, since it is not possible to know the nature of the deleted residues.

Discussion
The primary antibody repertoire arises during B cell development through significant structural modifications of
the VH and VL gene loci [1]. Through random rearrangement of VH, D, and JH gene segments, and the combinatorial pairing of these rearranged H chains with similarly
processed L chains, a "paratope space" is generated that
will accommodate a large number of epitopes. There is
also evidence that a subset of B cell receptors (BCRs) may
be further diversified by the accumulation of point mutations prior to antigenic stimulation. [30]. Secondary BCR
diversification occurs in the germinal centers following

antigenic stimulation [31-33], and is thought to result primarily from the accumulation of point mutations in the
CDRs of both H and L chain V genes. This secondary
diversification presumably allows for the selection of antibody clones with increased affinity for the stimulating
epitope, and a concomitant increase in antibody efficacy.
Several previous studies have reported immunoglobulin
gene sequences in which codons appear to have been
inserted into or deleted from the rearranged germline VH
and VL genes encoding the mature antibody heterodimer.
Although many reports resulted from the examination of
B cell malignancies, such modifications have also been
reported from non-transformed IgG+ human B cells [27]
and human hybridomas [12], and it appears that such
modifications may play a physiologically normal role in
the somatic maturation of the human antibody response.
This argument is strengthened by the observed association
of I/Ds both with the CDRs and with motifs within the
CDRs known to be preferentially targeted by the enzymatic machinery responsible for somatic hypermutation
[34].

Our research utilizes repertoire cloning as a methodology
for analyzing antigen-specific antibody response in
humans. Repertoire cloning allows us to examine the
recombination events and V gene usage that give rise to a
protective response for a variety of antigens, to ascertain
the degree to which somatic hypermutation modifies the
ongoing antibody response to different types of antigens,
and to determine the degree to which different members
of the population utilize the same mechanisms in generating antibody diversity. These studies offer us the opportunity to examine I/Ds in the context of ongoing antigenspecific response, to compare the response in different
donors, and in some cases to locate the I/D event within
the SHM history of a single antigen-specific antibody
clone. The combinatorial approach we have taken in cloning and screening expression libraries, although highly
suitable for repertoire analysis, suffers from the fact that
native H and L chain pairing is lost. The frequency with
which physiologic Fabs are recreated depends not only on
the specificity of B cell enrichment prior to mRNA extraction, but also on the complexity of the antigen-specific
antibody repertoire. It is not the case, however, that de

novo antigen-specific paratopes are created by this methodology. We have shown through direct protein sequencing and idiotypic analysis that the combinatorial cloning
technology we employ faithfully reproduces the serum
repertoire of polysaccharide-specific antibodies that arise
in vaccinated individuals [14,15]. This fidelity is more difficult to demonstrate for protein antigens, however. Protein specific antibody repertoires are diverse, and even a
highly enriched protein-specific B cell population would
be expected to contain multiple paratopes utilizing several
different H and L chains. We cannot rule out that combinatorial pairing in such a complex mixture might give rise
to a antigen-specific paratope not present in the in vivo
population, especially in cases where the majority of the
contact residues are located on one chain. Our conclusions pertaining to the single protein specific Fab we
present here (PA-specific clone 001.46F1) must therefore
be interpreted with this in mind.
We find the somatic modification of antibody genes by
the insertion or deletion of codons to be a common occurrence. Of 13 individuals examined in detail for 4 disparate
specificities, 8 (62%) utilized I/Ds in the diversification of
their repertoires for at least one of the specificities examined. Overall, 9.7% of the independent rearranged V
genes analyzed contained I/Ds. All I/Ds we observed were
in Ig genes that had undergone some degree of SHM as

compared to the germline. It is notable that I/Ds were
observed following vaccination both with T-independent
(PPS) vaccines, as well as T-dependent vaccines (PPS-protein conjugates and PA). It appears unlikely, therefore,
that the T-dependent nature of the immunogen strongly
influences I/D events directly. The degree of SHM we
observe 7 days following vaccination, however, implies
that these are recall responses, and the I/D events we
observe (as well as the point mutations) could have arisen
earlier during the primary exposure to antigen. The possible T-dependent nature of this primary exposure is
unknown. We also confirm here that I/Ds occur within
the same RGYW/WRCY motifs known to be hotspots for
SHM. Approximately 70% of the bases in the germline VH
and VL region reported here lie outside of RGYW/WRCY
motifs, making the correlation we observe (100% of insertions and at least 67% of deletions) unlikely to occur by
chance alone. Previous reports of I/Ds in randomly
selected B cells also noted this association, and support
the hypothesis that the enzymatic mechanisms underlying SHM also generate I/Ds. It should be noted, however,
that nucleotide sequences satisfying the RGYW/WRCY
motif occur commonly in the CDRs of both VH and VL
genes, and even if the process is confined to the CDRs by
a mechanism unrelated to SHM, association with the

Table 4 germline sequence aligned with Fab gene sequence in the vicinity of codon insertions. Dashes
indicate identity with the germline-encoded sequence. Asterisks (*) indicate site of inserted bases. Bases
constituting RGYW/WRCY motifs are underlined. Bases replicated in the inserted codons are shown in
bold. Codons are numbered as in[24]. IGMT/HUGO nomenclature for the V1-4 lambda light chain listed
above is IGLV2-14.

framework regions were located within RGYW/WRCY
motifs lends significant support to the hypothesis that
insertions, deletions, and single base pair mutations are
all generated by the same underlying mechanism.
Although incompletely understood, SHM is known to
involve AID and low fidelity DNA polymerases. AID is
thought to target RGYW/WRCY motifs during transcription, and leads to the deamination of C to U. During
repair of this lesion, error-prone polymerases (such as Pol
η, Pol ζ, Pol θ, Rev1) would generate mutations which are
propagated through further rounds of cell division.
Although the proposed method readily accounts for the
introduction of point mutations, it is not as obvious how
the proposed two-step mechanism could directly generate
either insertions or deletions. The fact that insertions
duplicate adjacent codons, and that deletion also share
probable homology with adjacent codons is consistent
with a model of polymerase slippage first proposed by
Streisinger [28] as a mechanism for the introduction of
frameshift mutations, and this mechanism has been proposed for Ig I/Ds. [13,27]. In this model, unpaired loops
form in regions of sequence redundancy during replication, and, depending on which strand the loop forms, an

insertion or deletion in the sequence results if the loop is
not repaired. This mechanism is not dependent on any
particular sequence motif, however, and only requires
homology in the vicinity of the I/D site. It cannot in itself
explain the predominance of I/Ds in the CDRs and their
association with the SHM-preferred motif. There is evidence, however, that both CSR and SHM involve double
stranded breaks (DSB) and subsequent rejoining of the
coding DNA [4-6,35-37]. Although the role of AID in this
mechanism is still undetermined, it has been shown that
DSBs occur in the CDRs during SHM, and that these
breaks also occur at the SHM-preferred RGYW/WRCY
motifs [4]. It has also been shown that DSBs occurring
during CSR are staggered [37]. Staggered DSBs in the
CDRs during SHM would suggest a possible alternative
mechanism for the introduction of both codon insertions
(through fill in of overhangs), and codon deletions
(through exonuclease trimming of overhangs), and may
better account for the restriction of I/Ds to the CDRs than
the polymerase slippage model.
The assumption that the I/Ds we describe arise as a consequence of somatic maturation should also be examined in
the light of other possible explanations. One is that these

Page 7 of 14

Biology Direct 2006, 1:24

are artifactual, that is, they arise either from polymerase
error or strand crossover events during the PCR reactions.
Our ability to re-isolate the identical V regions containing
both the point mutations and the I/D events from residual
non-amplified cDNA makes PCR error an extremely
unlikely explanation. Another possibility is that an isolated H or L chain containing an apparent I/D event may
in actuality represent an un-described allele of the parent
V gene. This has been a significant caveat in other studies
describing I/Ds. Our ability to place the I/D events in the
context of ongoing SHM (i.e. the isolation of clonallyrelated H and L chains with and without the I/D event)
rules this explanation out, at least for those I/D events
where several related chains were isolated. Taken together,
these two factors strongly support the conclusion that the
I/D events we observe represent physiologically relevant
events in the clonal maturation of the antibody response.
Alignment and clonal lineage analysis of somatically
mutated Ig genes allows us to make several unique observations relevant to the origin and timing of these modifications. In addition to ruling out the involvement of a
non-described allele, placing I/Ds within the maturational history of a single rearrangement event allows us to
determine that I/Ds can occur during the antigen-driven
receptor diversification period of B cell development, and
are not restricted to the earlier period of VDJ rearrangement (when DSBs are known to occur). We also show that
I/Ds can continue to occur throughout the somatic maturation of the antibody response.
Lastly, we have determined that although I/Ds can dramatically alter the canonical loop structure of the combining site, their effect on antigen binding can be variable,
and difficult to predict. The significant deletion of 6 residues from L chain CDR1 in clone 3H11, for example, has
little, if any effect on relative binding affinity, while the
insertion of 2 residues into H chain CDR2 of clone 6F2
resulted in a significant increase in relative binding affinity. These results are not surprising, however. The contribution of the individual CDRs (and the H and L chains
themselves) to the formation of the combining site varies,
and an I/D event in a non-contributing CDR (or chain)
would be expected to have little effect on affinity for the
epitope. And, although our methods of analysis preclude
the examination of events that lead to loss of antigen
binding, it can be assumed that I/D events also occur that
result in a complete loss of affinity as well. A single B cell
clone induced to enter SHM by a single antigenic epitope
therefore might give rise to a diverse set of descendant
clones with minor (through point mutation) and/or
major (through codon I/Ds) alterations of the combining
sites. A murine model system (the "quasi-monoclonal"
mouse) has shown directly that a single VH/VL rearrangement is capable of giving rise to a diverse antibody reper-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/24

toire through post-rearrangement modifications [38]. I/
Ds could therefore be viewed as a mechanism (along with
SHM) by which the primary repertoire is diversified to
produce BCRs specific for epitopes not covered by the
original paratope space generated during combinatorial
joining of germ-line gene segments early in B cell development.
The data we present here, when considered with that previously published, provide a compelling argument that
the intrachain addition and deletion of codons occurs as
a normal part of the somatic maturation of the human
antibody response. In addition to increasing antibody
efficacy, these significant alteration of paratope structure
may also serve to generate a BCR repertoire more diversified than that initially created by VDJ recombination
alone. The retention of these modified receptors in the
memory pool would significantly expand the range of
paratopes available to interact with cognate antigen.

Materials and methods
The cloning of human antibody repertoires specific for the
polysaccharide antigens (PPS) of Streptococcus pneumoniae
serotypes 23F and 6B have been described in detail previously [14,15]. Fabs specific for PPS serotype 14, and the
protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis were isolated
using the same approach. In brief, peripheral blood was
collected 7 days after vaccination from adult volunteers
that had received either the licensed 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (Pnu-Immune, Wyeth-Lederle) or a 9-valent
polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine consisting of
PPS from serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F
conjugated to the mutant diphtheria toxin CRM197
(Wyeth-Lederle). For the isolation of PA specific Fabs,
blood was collected from a donor 7 days following the
sixth dose of the anthrax vaccine AVA (BioPort). Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from the 7 day post-vaccination blood sample using Ficoll-Hypaque. PPS
antigens and PA were biotinylated as previously described
[16] and used to "arm" avidin-coated paramagnetic beads
(Immunotech Inc., Marseilles, France). These antigencoated beads were washed, added to 2 × 107 MNC (preabsorbed with avidin-coated magnetic beads), and the
mixture incubated on ice for 30 min. Antigen binding
cells were then isolated with a magnet. The CD19+ percentage of the isolated MNCs ranged from 4 to 23% (average 11%). The number of isolated B cells and the degree
of antigen specific B cell enrichment were not determined
directly. Positively selected cells were washed twice with
cold PBS/0.5%BSA, and used for RNA extraction.
Construction of Fab expression libraries
The procedures for the construction of Fab libraries have
been previously described in detail [14-16]. Briefly, total
RNA was prepared from affinity isolated cells (RNAeasy,

Biology Direct 2006, 1:24

Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and cDNA prepared using the Thermoscript RT-RCR System (GIBCO BRL, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturers instructions. cDNA was
used as template in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
to generate H chain Fd fragments (VDJ-CH1) and total
kappa and lambda L chains for insertion into the expression vector pComb 3H [17] or pARC [14]. Expression
libraries generated from a single individual consist, on the
average, of about 2 × 106 clones, of which about >80%
produce intact Fabs.
Identification of antigen-specific Fabs
Individual transformed E. coli colonies were selected, mastered onto an LB/carbenicillin agar plate, and grown in 1
ml overnight cultures in deep well 96-well plates under
antibiotic selection. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, re-suspended in 140 µl lysis buffer (PBS + protease
inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN)), rapidly frozen and thawed 3
times using liquid nitrogen, and the cellular debris pelleted by centrifugation. Fifty µl of the lysate was transfered
to assay plates that had been coated overnight with
human light-chain specific antibody (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) and incubated for 2 hrs at 37°C to
facilitate capture of the Fabs. Plates were then washed and
50 µl radio-labeled PPS or PA antigen added to each well.
Following incubation at 37°C for 2 hrs, plates were
washed, placed on a PhosphorImager detection plate
(Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the plate was
exposed for varying lengths of time. Following exposure,
the PhosphorImager plates were scanned, and antigenbinding wells identified. Residual lysate from corresponding clones was re-assayed for binding using a radio-antigen binding assay (for the PPS antigens) or by ELISA (for
PA). Positive cultures were identified on the master plates,
streaked for isolation, and individual colonies picked and
grown overnight. Fab production and antigen-specific
binding were then verified in these sub-clones.
Mutagenesis of selected Fabs
Selected Fabs were mutated either to remove inserted
codons or to insert deleted codons. Residues to be modified were selected by comparison to the germline VL or
VH gene of origin. Mutations were introduced by primer
overlap extension. [18], and verified by sequence analysis.
Sequencing and sequence analysis
Plasmids containing H and L chain genes were submitted
to Davis Sequencing, LLC (Davis, CA) for VH and VL
chain sequence determination. Initial sequence analysis
utilized
the
NCBI
IgBlast
server
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/ to identify candidate
germline gene [19]. Following preliminary BLAST alignment, the primary candidate germline gene and all
returned near neighbors were manually inspected to

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/24

ensure both correct germline gene assignment and the
correct location of any inserted or deleted codons. Germline genes assignments were made based on the minimum
number of mutations required to generate the observed Vgene sequence (maximum parsimony). Subsequent analysis, alignments, translations and clonal lineage analysis
were performed using MacVector (Accelrys Inc, Princeton,
NJ). To generate the CLUSTALW multiple alignment
guide trees, an assumed parent V region was constructed
using the known sequence of the relevant V and J germline
genes. For heavy chains, a hypothetical CDR3 region was
constructed using the most common bases found at each
position of the CDR3 in the sequences being analyzed. A
distance matrix was generated by pairwise alignment, and
these distances used to construct the guide tree that
groups and orders the individual sequences. The trees
were then "rooted" on the theoretical germline sequence
to reflect the origin of the divergent sequences from the
original V-(D)-J rearrangement in the naïve B cell. Kappa
V region gene nomenclature is as described in [20].
Lambda V region gene nomenclature is as described in
[21]. H chain V region gene nomenclature is as described
in the IMGT database [22,23]. Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) are as defined in [24].
Antigen binding and Fab concentration assays
The ability of Fabs to bind antigen was determined by a
modified radio-antigen binding assay (for the PPS antigens; [25]) or by elisa (for PA). Fab concentration was
determined by a capture ELISA in which goat anti-human
Fd (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) or goat anti-IgA
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) immobilized on a microtiter plate
captures Fab which is then detected by alkaline-phosphatase labeled goat anti-human L chain (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). This assay is standardized with
a purified Fab standard whose concentration was calculated from UV absorbance at 280 nm.

Reviewer's report 1
Mark Shlomchik, MD, PhD, Professor of Laboratory Medicine

Haven, CT, USA

This paper by Reason and Zhou is an interesting analysis
of the sequences obtained from a carefully designed repertoire cloning exercise, using PBL CD19+ cells enriched
for specificity for immunizing Ags. Volunteers had
received various vaccines 7 days prior to blood collection.
An interesting aspect is the focus on carbohydrate-specific
epitopes, which are more constrained in repertoire and
thus more likely to reproduce authentic VH/VL pairs even
though repertoire cloning re-associates these at random in
vitro.
Though there are potentially a number of important features of these sequences, the current manuscript focuses
on the somewhat unexpected finding that V sequences
contain insertions and deletions at a relatively high frequency. Actually, as acknowledged and partly referenced,
small insertions and deletions (I/D's) have long been
known to accompany somatic hypermutation, though
they have generally been noticed in the context of noncoding or else inactivating mutations that would lead to
frameshifts. Nonetheless, this work shows that such I/D's
are often in frame and can be quite long, and are often
compatible with maintaining specificity for immunizing
Ag. Particularly compelling are the findings of I/D's in the
context of clonal lineages, showing they occur after the
onset of SHM and that SHM itself can continue after the I/

D's. This in turn firmly links the process to Ag-driven SHM
in vivo, a point strengthened by the re-isolation of the
same I/D's from the original cDNA pools. In addition,
limited but interesting reconstruction of I/D's in vivo indicate that they can be neutral or even improve Ag-binding.
Overall, this work helps to establish the physiological relevance of I/D's to the development of the Ag-driven repertoire.
The presentation of the data is clear and the interpretations are reasonable.
The genealogies would be better presented with the mutations on them. My analysis of the primary data from tree
1a indicates that there are potentially many independent
parallel mutations. More information is needed on how
frequent these were and how they were resolved in making the genealogies. A careful analysis of these may reveal
PCR hybrids as well.
I declare that I have no competing interests.
Response to reviewer
The reviewer expressed concerns over the methodology used to
generate the geneologies as well as their presentation. The guide
trees were generated using the CLUSTALW multiple alignment
algorithm. An assumed parent V region was constructed using
the known sequence of the relevant V and J germline genes. For
heavy chains, an assumed CDR3 region was constructed using
the most frequent bases found in the sequences being analyzed.
All sequences were then compared to each other in a pair-wise
fashion to determine their degree of divergence from each other,
and their similarities stored in a matrix as a distance measurement that reflects the "evolutionary" distance between the individual pairs. From the distance matrix, a guide (phylogenetic)
tree is constructed that groups and orders the individual
sequences. The trees are then "rooted" on the theoretical germline sequence to reflect the origin of the divergent sequences
from the original V-(D)-J rearrangement in the naïve B cell. A
section has been added to the materials and methods to better
explain the method by which the alignment trees were generated. The suggestion was also made that a better presentation
of the guide trees would be to include the mutations on them.
Since these V regions are extensively mutated (some with >40
base changes), it is difficult to include the mutations on the
trees in a manner that would be informative. The main purpose
of the guide trees is to order the divergence of the individual
chains such that an inference can be made as to when in the
process the I/D events occurred. The reviewers comments
regarding crossover events during PCR point to a significant
problem when performing PCR on mixed antibody preparation
and were raised by other reviewers as well. This is perhaps more
an issue for individual mutations than for the generation of
insertions and deletions. Although difficult to rule out entirely,
examination of related sequences reveled no obvious example of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/24

this occuring. More significantly, our ability to re-isolate
sequences identical to those reported from residual material
that had not been previously manipulated strongly suggest that,
at least for these sequences, PCR cross over was not an issue.
For other sequences, it remains a possibility and represents a
limitation of the reported data.
The reviewer is also correct in noticing that the primary
sequence data from which the trees were generated indicates
several incidences of independent parallel mutations. It must be
remembered that these sequences have been subjected to antigen-driven selection, both physiologically during affinity maturation, and technically during the cloning procedures. Only
those mutations that retain antigen binding will be detected.
We conclude that those incidences of parallel mutation identify
residues that directly contribute to antigen/antibody binding,
and are therefore positively selected. We have chosen not to
include a discussion of them herein only because they are not
directly relevant to the main topic of the manuscript. They have
been discussed to some degree in the manuscript in which they
were originally reported, and are included in another we are
preparing that deals with the somatic maturational process of
carbohydrate specific antibodies in general.
Reviewer's report 2
Deborah Dunn-Walters, Senior Lecturer, Department of
Immunobiology, King's College London School of Medicine,
Guy's Campus, London (nominated by Dr. Andrew Macpherson, McMaster University Medical Centre, Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada)

The authors have used repertoire cloning to isolate antigen specific human Ig genes after vaccination with
polysaccharide (both T dependent and T-independent
antigens) and protein vaccines. Their analysis of the Fab
repertoires produced shows that insertions and deletions
(I/Ds) are a fairly common occurrence during affinity
maturation of the Ig gene. The observation of I/Ds has
been made previously, but not in the context of specific
antibody responses against different types of antigens.
What is nice about this paper is that the authors have isolated clonally-related sequences so that they can create lineage trees and show that I/Ds can occur during the affinity
maturation process. This, in conjunction with the observations that a) only mutated Ig genes have I/Ds and b) the
somatic hypermutation (SHM) hotspots RGYW and
WRCY are usually found in the vicinity of the I/Ds, shows
that the I/Ds are likely to be created as part of the overall
SHM process.
In the discussion, paragraph 5, concerning the theory that
polymerase error might be responsible for I/Ds, the
authors briefly mention that fidelity of polymerase might
be somehow be altered only near RGYW sequences and
then they quickly move on to discuss double strand

Biology Direct 2006, 1:24

breaks. The current two step hypothesis for the mechanism of SHM is that the initial targetting of WRCY/RGYW
by AID causes a mismatch lesion by deamination of C to
U. This is thought to trigger the second phase of hypermutation which involves mismatch repair and DOES involve
error prone polymerases such as Pol η, Pol ζ, Pol θ, Rev1.
Hence linking hotspots with polymerase error is a plausible theory and the error-prone pols should be mentioned.
The authors also reverted two of the clones to replace the
(assumed) deletion or to remove the insertion. In one
instance the reversion had no significant effect on affinity,
whereas the other had a larger effect. This is, as the authors
point out, not surprising – as not all changes during affinity maturation will result in significant differences in function. Nonetheless it is interesting that the reversion
causing a large difference in affinity was of a conserved
insertion that occurred close to the root of the lineage tree,
and presumably early in the affinity maturation process,
whereas the reversion that didn't make any difference was
of a mutation that had occurred slightly later in the affinity maturation process.
I declare that I have no competing interests.
Response to reviewer
The reviewer is correct in stating that the currently accepted
model of AID-mediated SHM was given insufficient emphasis
in our attempt to postulate a mechanism responsible for the generations of I/Ds, and we have added wording to the discussion
section of the manuscript we hope will correct this. We do feel,
however, that while the currently accepted two-step mechanism
of SHM very plausibly explains point mutations in the V regions
of immunoglobulin genes, it is less robust in explaining the generation of multi-base insertions and deletions at these same
motifs.
Reviewer's report 3
Rachel M. Gerstein, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of
Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA

Somatic hyper-mutation (SHM) is an important mechanism for diversifying antibodies produced during an
immune response to infection. This is important for "finetuning" responses as they evolve and generating higher
affinity B cell clones that can effectively compete for and
capture antigen as antigen concentration drops off once
antibodies and other effector mechanisms make progress
in clearing infectious organisms.
Most mutations made during SHM are nucleotide substitutions. This Ms analyzes the less frequent occurrence of
insertions and deletions (I/Ds). I/Ds have been observed
previously, and, when the antibody gene is left "inframe", have the ability to modify antigen binding. The

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/24

unresolved issue to which this Ms contributes is the extent
to which I/Ds contribute to antigen-specific responses,
and whether I/Ds can improve antigen biding. Importantly, this study considers mutations in human B cells
that are generated in response to the clinically important
polysaccharide antigens (PPS) of Streptococcus pneumoniae
and protective antigen (PA) of Bacillus anthracis. Studies of
SHM in mouse B cells are much more numerous, and
studies of mutations in human B cells that arise during
responses to infection or vaccines are still limited.
This paper will be of interest to immunologists, particularly those studying SHM. The antigen-specificity of these
antibodies allows the authors to construct relational trees
from (probably) clonally-related VH or VL chains, and
document that I/Ds, like SHM-generated substitutions,
are likely to occur over the course of SHM.
The strength of the approach used is that the authors have
an effective system, repertoire cloning, to "capture" and
analyze antigen-specific immunoglobulins in an unbiased
manner: all expressed H chain and L chain genes are
cloned by PCR into expression vectors which are then
used to transform E. coli. lysates from this library are then
screened for both Fab content and then specific antigen
binding.
Another strength of the approach and the study is that the
authors were able to study the contribution of insertions
to relative affinity to antigen by mutating the molecular
clones so as to restore germ-line sequence, and then measuring antigen binding in the different clones. In one
clone, removal of insertions reduced binding 5-fold. It
would be interesting to know the affect of other insertions
on other clones, as conclusions from one clone are somewhat limited.
A number of criticisms are suggested for consideration
The frequency of I/Ds should be presented in a more
informative way. Table 1 reports number of Fabs with I or
Ds compared to the # of Fabs sequenced for each donor.
It would be useful to also report the frequency (ie # nucleotides changed by I/Ds vs the # sequenced).

Similarly, the authors report that location of the I/Ds are
highly correlated with RGYW/WRCY motifs (hotspots for
SHM), yet no numeric or statistical comparisons are provided. Important in this type of comparison is the frequency overall of RGYW/WRCY motifs in the V gene.
Pooled B cells were used for RNA isolation and subsequent PCR cloning. There is no way to assure that any
given sequence is not a product of in vitro strand exchange
during PCR (particularly problematic for related V-

regions; see Ford et al. Gene 142:279-283, 1994) and this
limitation should be acknowledged.
What is the direct evidence that I/Ds are a product of
SHM? Typically, specificity and errors introduced by Taq
are accounted for by sequencing germ-line genes from the
same donor or sequencing a different gene (even CH1
from Cµ). And what argues against the possibility that
some sequences can represent allelic variants in the
human population?
Response to reviewer
Tables 1 and 2were designed primarily to provide the reader
with indication of the number of donors we had processed, the
depth to which each had been explored, and the general distribution of the I/D events. We agree with the reviewer that it is
not easy to ascertain the overall frequency of I/D events from
the tables presented. We have therefore re-calculated the overall
frequency of I/Ds in this study by determining the total number
of independent heavy and light chain rearrangements analyzed
for all donors. This eliminates clonal derivatives which would
bias the denominator. We find the number of donors in which
I/D events to be 8/13 (62%). 12 of the 124 independent H and
L rearrangements analyzed from these donors (9.7%) contained I/D events. A sentence stating these frequencies has been
added to both the results and discussion section of the manuscript.

The caveats of in vitro strand exchange during PCR and other
PCR-related errors is well taken and was raised by other reviewers as well. To verify that the sequences we report did not arise
from PCR related artifacts we decided to re-isolate the antibody
V regions containing I/Ds from the residual cDNA used to
make the original libraries. This is the most direct verification
of the validity of our reported sequences. Analysis was limited
to H chains in order to take advantage of the unique CDR3
sequences. For 2 heavy chains containing deletions (023.9E5
and 023.14H10) and for 1 heavy chain containing an insertion (008.4B7) sufficient material remained following library
construction to serve as template for an additional PCR. In all
three cases, VH regions identical, both in terms of I/Ds and
point mutations, to those reported in Table 3 and 4were re-isolated from the appropriate cDNA, thereby rendering PCR error
unlikely as the source of I/Ds in these clones. We cannot
exclude the possibility that other clones may contain PCRrelated artifacts. We do, however, believe that the re-isolation
of these sequences from non-manipulated material strongly support the conclusion that the I/D events we observe represent
physiologically relevant events in the clonal maturation of the
antibody response. A paragraph has been added to both the
results and to the discussion section of the manuscript to report
these new findings.
The reviewer also suggest the possibility that some sequences
may represent allelic variants of the germline genes in the data-

base. This has been a of particular concern in other studies
describing I/Ds since usually only single sequences are reported.
In 4 donors, multiple, clonally-related but sequence-unique VH
or VL chains were isolated that allowed the analysis of I/D
events in the context of ongoing SHM. Our ability to place the
I/D events in the context of ongoing SHM (i.e. the isolation of
clonally-related H and L chains with and without the I/D event,
figure 1and 018.6G5) rules this explanation out, at least for
these 4 I/D events where several related chains were isolated.
We cannot rule this explanation out for sequences that were isolated without clonal relatives lacking I/D events, and this is a
limitation of the study.
