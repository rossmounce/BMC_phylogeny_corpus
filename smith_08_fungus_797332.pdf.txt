Abstract
Background: Silencing of genes inserted near telomeres provides a model to investigate the
function of heterochromatin. We initiated a study of telomeric silencing in Neurospora crassa, a
fungus that sports DNA methylation, unlike most other organisms in which telomeric silencing has
been characterized.
Results: The selectable marker, hph, was inserted at the subtelomere of Linkage Group VR in an
nst-1 (neurospora sir two-1) mutant and was silenced when nst-1 function was restored. We show
that NST-1 is an H4-specific histone deacetylase. A second marker, bar, tested at two other
subtelomeres, was similarly sensitive to nst-1 function. Mutation of three additional SIR2
homologues, nst-2, nst-3 and nst-5, partially relieved silencing. Two genes showed stronger effects:
dim-5, which encodes a histone H3 K9 methyltransferase and hpo, which encodes heterochromatin
protein-1. Subtelomeres showed variable, but generally low, levels of DNA methylation.
Elimination of DNA methylation caused partial derepression of one telomeric marker.
Characterization of histone modifications at subtelomeric regions revealed H3 trimethyl-K9, H3
trimethyl-K27, and H4 trimethyl-K20 enrichment. These modifications were slightly reduced when
telomeric silencing was compromised. In contrast, acetylation of histones H3 and H4 increased.
Conclusion: We demonstrate the presence of telomeric silencing in Neurospora and show a
dependence on histone deacetylases and methylation of histone H3 lysine 9. Our studies also reveal
silencing functions for DIM-5 and HP1 that appear independent of their role in de novo DNA
methylation.

Background
Linear chromosomes pose a problem for replication of the
terminal section of the DNA strand with a 5' end. The
problem is solved in most eukaryotes by the addition of
repeated sequences to the chromosome ends [1]. Thus the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae sports TG1–3 repeats
on the ends of its chromosomes [2], while telomeres of
both the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa and
humans comprise TTAGGG repeats [3,4]. Drosophila's
chromosome ends are capped by arrays of retrotransposons and the adjacent subtelomeric DNA consists of
repetitive elements called telomere-associated sequences
(TAS) [4]. TAS appear cytologically condensed (that is,
heterochromatic) [5] and confer silencing on nearby
genes, apparently because of spreading of silent heterochromatin. This phenomenon, called 'telomeric silencing', or 'telomere position effect' (TPE), was initially
discovered and studied using transgenes but it also
appears to regulate endogenous subtelomeric genes [6-8].
Telomeric silencing has been demonstrated in organisms
ranging from yeasts to humans (reviewed in [9]) but it has
been best characterized in S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces
pombe and Drosophila melanogaster, organisms that have
no, or very little, DNA methylation. Heterochromatin at S.
cerevisiae telomeres is nucleated by the telomere repeat
binding protein Rap1 [10,11]. Telomeric silencing
requires histone deacetylation by the conserved nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone
deacetylase (HDAC) Sir2p [12], reviewed in [13]. Sir2p is
found in a complex with Sir4p, which interacts with Sir3p
[14]. While Sir2p homologues (sirtuins) have been found
in all eukaryotes examined, Sir3p and Sir4p are restricted
to close relatives of S. cerevisiae. The fission yeast S. pombe
lacks Sir3p and Sir4p but employs methylation of histone
H3 lysine 9 (K9) plus a Sir2p homologue (Sir2) for silencing [15]. Deacetylation by Sir2 allows methylation of K9
by the Clr4 histone methyltransferase (HKMT), which in
turn allows for binding by a homologue of Heterochromatin Protein-1 (HP1), Swi6 [15,16]. Swi6 is recruited to
telomeres by interaction with the telomere repeat binding
factor Taz1, which interacts with Rap1 and the RNAi-RITS
complex [17].
The mechanism of telomeric silencing is largely unknown
in plants and animals [1]. Silencing in Drosophila is
dependent on telomere length, which depends on HP1
and its interaction with both telomere DNA and methylated H3 K9 [18-21]. One of the five Drosophila SIR2
homologues was tested for involvement in telomeric
silencing but none was detected [22]. Sequences associated with mammalian telomeres show features of heterochromatin, including DNA methylation, trimethylated
H4 K20, trimethylated H3 K9 and bound HP1, but the
role of these factors remains to be elucidated [1]. Study of

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/1/1/5

telomeric silencing in humans and mice has been limited,
presumably in part because genes involved in heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation are essential in
these organisms. We therefore initiated a study of telomeric silencing in N. crassa, which has DNA methylation
like plants and mammals, but does not depend on it for
survival.
A single DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), DIM-2, is
responsible for all known DNA methylation in Neurospora [23]. DNA methylation is directed by Neurospora's single HP1 homologue to chromosomal regions
in which histone H3 is trimethylated at K9 by the HKMT
DIM-5 [24-26]. DNA methylation in Neurospora is found
predominantly at transposon relics [27], many of which
are scattered throughout the genome but are most concentrated in centromeric and telomeric regions [28-30].
To look for TPE in Neurospora, we inserted transgenes
near telomeres in mutants that were defective in candidate
silencing genes and were thus predicted to relieve the telomeric silencing. We initially tested several putative sirtuins, which we named nst-1 (Neurospora sir two) through
nst-7 [31]. We found evidence of TPE in Neurospora and
found that several but not all of the nst genes are involved
in silencing. We also tested the involvement of DIM-5,
HP1 and DIM-2 to assess the potential influence of DNA
methylation on TPE. Finally, we tested the effect of chemical inhibitors of HDACs and DNA methylation. We
found evidence for the involvement of DIM-5, HP1 and
HDACs in telomeric silencing in Neurospora. Interestingly, we found that the telomeric transgenes and native
subtelomeric sequences are lightly methylated and that
mutation of dim-2 can affect TPE, although not at all telomeres. We conclude that silencing by DNA methylation
at non-telomeric chromosomal sites and silencing at telomeres share some components (DIM-5 and HP1) but
represent distinct silencing pathways.

Results
Inactivation of nst genes
To investigate whether Neurospora shows telomeric
silencing, we needed to insert a genetic marker in a subtelomeric region and then test its expression in various
genetic backgrounds. As the histone H4 K16-specific
deacetylase Sir2p is central to telomeric silencing in previously examined eukaryotes and has also been implicated
in other forms of silencing [9], we chose to test Neurospora homologues of Sir2p first. The Neurospora
genome contains seven genes predicted to encode a protein with the NAD+-dependent deacetylase domain typical of the Sir2 family, the same number found in the
human genome [32]. We designated these genes nst-1
(Neurospora sir two) through nst-7 [31]. NST-1 is most
closely related to S. pombe Sir2p and S. cerevisiae Sir2p and

Hst1p, two proteins that have partially redundant functions in telomeric silencing [12,33,34]. Neurospora also
has close homologues of S. cerevisiae Hst3p (NST-4) and
Hst4p (NST-3), which both act on acetylated K56 of histone H3 [35] and are required for telomeric silencing in
yeast [33]. NST-2 is most closely related to S. cerevisiae
Hst2p, which is cytosolic and disrupts telomeric silencing
when over-expressed [36]. A tree based on a single alignment of the putative Sir2 catalytic domains of the Neurospora and human sirtuins (Sir2 homologues) is shown
in Figure 1A. While we cannot assume functional similarities based on this level of sequence similarity, it should
be noted that the human sirtuins are not all nuclear histone deacetylases. One study showed localization of the
human sirtuins in the nucleus (SIRT1), the cytosol
(SIRT2), mitochondria (SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5), hetero-

chromatin (SIRT6), and the nucleolus (SIRT7) [32] (Figure 1A). More recently it was shown that SIRT4 is a
mitochondrial ADP-ribosyl transferase [37].
We used RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) [38] to generate strains with nonsense mutations in nst-1. One such
strain (N1982) served as the initial host for insertion of a
telomeric reporter gene (see below). We also employed
RIP to generate likely null alleles of several other nst genes;
altogether, we identified strains with one or more stop
codons in, or upstream of, the putative deacetylase
domains of nst-1, -2, -3 and -5 (Figure 1B). The nst1RIP1sequence (EU869540) introduces a single stop codon
at Q255, well within the conserved region of Sir2p, which
extends from roughly L197 through Q473. The nst2RIP1sequence (EU869542) has a mutation in the pre-

dicted start codon (ATG to ATA). The next potential start
codon is M165, downstream of the region that is predicted to encode the deacetylase catalytic domain. The
mutations in nst-3RIP1 (EU869541) generate a stop codon
at Q69. The nst-5RIP1 sequence (EU872050) contains
seven predicted nonsense mutations (at W115, R152,
Q163, Q177, Q196, Q203, and R234). Interestingly,
unlike the case in S. cerevisiae [33], none of these mutations resulted in any significant growth phenotype, even
when nst-1, -3, and -5 were combined (data not shown).

gene confers hygromycin resistance, even when hph is
expressed at a low level. Our initial work relied on the two
described Neurospora telomere sequences, IVL and VR
[3,29]. From a screen of roughly 150 transformants by
Southern hybridization, we identified a single clone with
the correct integration near Tel VR; nearly all other transformants had ectopic insertions, as is typical in Neurospora. Several attempts to insert the selectable mtr allele
into the subtelomeric region of telomere IVL failed to
yield an isolate with a homologous integration.

Silencing of hph at Telomere VR
As a first step to test for telomeric silencing in Neurospora,
we inserted a selectable marker, hph, into a subtelomeric
region by homologous recombination in strain N1982,
see figure 2, which carries the nst-1RIP1 mutation. The hph

We backcrossed the transformant with the desired insertion at Tel VR to an nst-1+ strain and found that hygromycin resistance (HygR) was lost in progeny with the nst-1+
allele, providing evidence for telomeric silencing in Neurospora and indicating that nst-1 plays a role in this proc-

construct at random ectopic chromosomal locations in a
nst-1+ strain by co-transformation with pBARKS1[39],
which confers resistance to Basta. Strains bearing hph
sequences were identified by Southern hybridization and
were all found to be HygR, confirming that hph is
expressed when not at a telomeric locus (data not shown).

above with this hph marker and then tested the effect of
the mutations on expression of hph at Tel VR. No loss of
silencing was detected in spot tests with the nst-2 mutant
(Figure 3B) but mutation of nst-3 resulted in striking derepression of hph (Figure 3A and 3B). Mutation of nst-5 also
relieved silencing (Figure 3B). While the nst-3 mutant
showed robust growth on hygromycin, the nst-1 and nst-5
mutants showed barely visible growth when 10,000 or
fewer conidia were spotted. However, resistance to hygromycin was reproducibly greater than in a nst+ strain, and

growth was more robust at lower hygromycin concentrations (shown in Figure 3A for nst-1). As one approach to
test the possibility that these genes are partially redundant, we constructed a strain defective for nst-1, -3 and -5
and compared its level of HygR with those of the single
mutants. The triple mutant showed a similar level of
resistance to nst-3 (Figure 3B).
We also generated strains to test the possible effect on telomeric silencing of genes required for DNA methylation,
namely dim-2, dim-5 and hpo, which respectively encode
the DNMT responsible for all known methylation in Neurospora [23], the HKMT responsible of methylation of K9
on histone H3, and the adaptor protein HP1. Elimination
of DNA methylation by mutation of dim-2 had no discernable effect on expression of hph at Tel VR (Figure 3B). In
contrast, both the HKMT DIM-5 and HP1, which reads the
mark created by DIM-5, were critical for silencing of this
marker (Figure 3B).
Silencing of bar at Telomere VIIL
To determine whether telomeric silencing occurs at other
Neurospora telomeres and works on other genes, we
inserted the selectable markers bar, encoding Basta resistance, and ad-3A proximal to two other telomeres, namely
those of chromosome arms VIIL and IIR (Figure 2B and
2C, respectively). These novel telomere regions were identified by sequencing and mapping clones containing
TTAGGG repeats (Wu C, Kim YS, Smith KM, Li W, Hood
HM, Staben C, Selker EU, Sachs MS, Farman ML, unpublished). As the hpo mutation provided the strongest relief
of silencing of hph at Tel VR, we used an hpo strain as the
transformation host. To reduce ectopic integrations, the
strain also included a mutation of mus-52, the gene that
encodes the KU80 homolog required for non-homologous end-joining of DNA double strand breaks [40].
Transformation with the Tel VIIL targeting plasmid
(pTTK19) yielded two BastaR transformants and Southern
hybridizations revealed that both had integrated the construct correctly (Figure 2B). Similarly, we obtained one
BastaR transformant with the Tel IIR-targeting plasmid
pTTK22 and confirmed that this clone integrated the
transgenes properly on LG IIR (Figure 2C). While use of
mus-52 facilitated integration of markers into subtelomeric sites on VIIL and IIR, equivalent attempts to target to
Tel IVL were unsuccessful.

The transformants with markers at VIIL and IIR were
crossed to restore hpo function and test for silencing. We
found that bar expression from the allele at Tel VIIL was
lost in the hpo+ background (Figure 3C). This implies that
the telomeric silencing observed with hph at Tel VR was
not a peculiarity of one chromosome or one marker. The
ad-3A gene was expressed, even in the original transformant (data not shown) and we did not explore the possibil-

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/1/1/5

ity that its level of expression pattern depended on hpo or
other markers. The Ku proteins play a role in telomere
function in other organisms [41] so we tested the effect of
the mus-52 mutation on expression of the Tel VIIL-targeted bar marker. The mus-52 mutation did not cause a
loss of silencing (data not shown), as is also the case in S.
pombe [42]. Interestingly, the Tel IIR bar allele was not
silenced when introduced into an hpo+ background (Figure 3D).
Having demonstrated telomeric silencing on two Neurospora chromosomes, we wished to test whether they
showed a similar dependence on Sir2p homologues and
other proteins implicated in heterochromatin formation.
We therefore crossed strains bearing the marked Tel VIIL
with strains bearing mutations in dim-2, dim-5, hpo, and
the various nst genes that we found to be involved in telomeric silencing on chromosome V. Mutation of dim-5,
hpo, nst-1, nst-2, nst-3 and nst-5 all caused loss of silencing
of bar at Tel VIIL (Figure 3C), albeit to various extents. The
results were generally consistent with the results obtained
for these genes with hph at Tel VR but we were surprised to
find an effect of the nst-2 mutation, as this gene had no
noticeable effect on hph silencing at Tel VR. Another notable difference concerns the DNMT DIM-2. Unlike the situation for hph at Tel VR, the dim-2 mutation caused
derepression of the bar marker at Tel VIIL (Figure 3C) suggesting differential involvement of DNA methylation at
these telomeres.
Inhibitors of HDACs relieve telomeric silencing
The HDAC Class I (Rpd3-like) and II (Hda1-like) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) [43] was previously shown to
cause selective inhibition of DNA methylation in Neurospora [44]. To further explore the mechanism of telomeric silencing in Neurospora, we tested the effect of
inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDACs on the expression of hph at Tel VR and bar at Tel VIIL. We first used a
plating assay to test the effect of the Class III (sirtuin)
HDAC inhibitor nicotinamide [45] on TPE and also on
expression of an interstitial allele of hph allele that was
silenced by DNA methylation spreading from flanking
sequences that had been subjected to RIP [46]. Nicotinamide caused relief of hph at Tel VR but not at the interstitial site (Figure 4A). This finding supports the genetic
evidence that sirtuins are involved in telomeric silencing
in Neurospora and implicates their HDAC activities. It
also suggests that sirtuins are not required for maintenance of DNA methylation.

We adopted an assay involving a gradient of inhibitors for
additional tests of the effects of nicotinamide, TSA and the
DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5AC) on
expression of the telomeric hph (Figure 4B) and bar (Figure 4C) alleles. Both nicotinamide and TSA allowed a

strain (N3120) carrying the telVR hph allele were plated in the presence or absence of 0.5 mg/ml Hygromycin to assay the
effect of the drugs 5-azacytidine (5AC), Trichostatin A (TSA) and NAM on telomeric silencing. C) Same as B except strain

small fraction of conidia to escape silencing and grow on
hygromycin, suggesting that both NAD+-dependent and independent HDACs play a role in telomeric silencing.
Interestingly, repeated tests showed that when both drugs
were added together, the loss of silencing was significantly
greater for telomeric hph, implying overlapping functions
of members from different HDAC classes. In contrast to
transcriptional silencing caused by DNA methylation,
silencing of hph at Tel VR was unaffected by the DNA

methylation inhibitor 5AC. This is consistent with our
findings with strains defective in DNA methylation due to
mutations in the dim-2 gene (Figure 3B). A small number
of colonies escaped silencing of bar on Tel VIIL in the presence of 5AC (Figure 4C), consistent with relief of bar
silencing in a dim-2 mutant (Figure 3C). In summary,
these data suggest that multiple HDACs are involved in
telomeric silencing and that DNA methylation is not universally required for gene silencing in Neurospora.

NST activity
The nst genes were identified by homology to SIR2. Not all
Sir2p homologues appear to be HDACs; some have been
shown to have non-histone substrates or lack deacetylase
activity toward all substrates tested (reviewed in [13]). In
one approach to determine whether the NST proteins
have HDAC activity, we used western blotting to assess
whether mutation of nst genes affected the global level of
histone acetylation at candidate residues. Initial tests
revealed no change in the nst-1, -3 or -5 mutants (data not
shown), consistent with the possibility that they are partially redundant. We therefore tested a triple (nst-1 nst-3
nst-5) mutant and, indeed, found significant hyperacetylation (Figure 5A) in contrast to the case with the single nst
mutants. Although no change was detected with antibodies that recognize acetylated H3 K14 or acetylated H3 K9
and/or K14, an antibody against acetylated H3 K9
revealed increased acetylation in the triple nst mutant
(Figure 5A). We also detected clearly increased acetylation
of H4 in the nst triple mutant, both with H4 tetra-acetyl
antibodies (recognizing acetyl K5, 8, 12, or 16) and with

H4 K16-acetyl antibodies. These results are consistent
with the idea that NST proteins are indeed HDACs.
To directly test whether at least one of the predicted NST
proteins is an HDAC, we expressed NST-1 in Escherichia
coli and assayed it for NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity with various acetylated histone peptides. NST-1 displayed robust activity with an H4 peptide acetylated on
K16 and weak activity with an H3 peptide acetylated on
K9, but showed no activity on H4 peptides acetylated on
K5, K8, or K12 (Figure 5B). Thus, the in vitro assays support the in vivo findings (Figure 5A and Figure 6, below)
and indicate that at least one NST protein is a bona fide
NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase.
DNA methylation of subtelomeric regions
Most available information on the structure and sequence
of telomeres and subtelomeric heterochromatic regions is
from organisms that do not have DNA methylation. Thus
we were interested to examine both native and introduced
sequences associated with telomeres for methylation in

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to compare histone modifications near telomeres in WT and nst triple mutant strains. Telomeric regions investigated are shown in the schematics at left. Vertical striped bars represent telomeric (TTAGGG)n repeats and horizontal striped bars in A represent Pogo LTRs. Black bars represent open reading frames and
are labeled according to the Broad Institute database. Strains N3120 (nst-1+) and N3132 (nst-1RIP1nst-3RIP1nst-5RIP1) show
increased acetylation of H3 and H4 and decreased histone methylation at the derepressed hph gene at telomere VR. A-D)
Immunoprecipitated chromatin was amplified with primers for the indicated regions, shown as gray bars. Values in the figure
indicate enrichment of specific modifications at telomeric regions relative to euchromatic (hH4) regions (A-C). To determine
these values bands were quantified using ImageQuant software and ratios were calculated relative to input DNA. D) We also

Neurospora. We found evidence of light DNA methylation at the silenced Tel VR hph marker and robust DNA
methylation at the Tel VIIL bar marker (Figure 7). This is
consistent with our observation that dim-2 caused derepression of the bar marker at VIIL but did not affect hph
expression at VR (Figure 3B and 3C). We also detected
limited methylation at some, but not all, unmarked telomeres. Specifically, DpnII/Sau3AI sites were lightly meth-

ylated or unmethylated at telomeres IL, IVL, and VR but
substantially methylated at Tel VIIL (Figure 7).
To examine whether the telomeric methylation is dependent on HP1, as found for DNA methylation at other
described chromosomal sites [26], we tested the effect of
a null mutation of hpo. In addition, we tested the effect of
mutating the three nst genes that we had found resulted in

Analyses of DNA methylation near telomeres. DNA was digested with isoschizomers DpnII (D) and Sau3AI (S), separated on agarose gels, blotted, and probed with telomere proximal regions to assay DNA methylation in these regions. Strains
for the TelVR hph panel: N2292, the primary transformant with hph targeted to tel VR (T); N3120, a nst+ strain (WT); N3004,
an hpo strain (hpo); N3132, the triple nst-1, -3, -5 mutant (nst). The hph probe was the first 600 bp of the coding region. Strains
for the tel VIIL bar panel: N3440, the primary transformant with bar targeted to tel VIIL (T); N3441 (nst+); N3443 (hpo). The
bar probe was the entire coding region. For the other panels, DNA samples of a wildtype strain, N150 (WT), an hpo mutant,
N3004 (hpo), and N3132, a triple nst-1 nst-3 nst-5 mutant (nst) were processed as for the other panels and probed for: telomere IL (Tel IL; 226–1249 bp from end); telomere IVL (TelIVL; 2500–3657 bp from end); telomere VR (Tel VR; 1130–2887 bp
from end); telomere VIIL (Tel VIIL; 324–1306 bp from end); a methylated repeat called 8:F10 (see text).

hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 (Figure 5). Introduction of the hpo mutation introduced a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (Tel VR) but it clearly
also resulted in loss of methylation at all regions tested,
consistent with previous indications that hpo causes a global loss of methylation [26]. In contrast, DNA methylation of subtelomeric regions was essentially unaffected in
the triple nst mutant. We also tested the effect of the nst
mutation on methylation of a non-telomeric repeated element (8:F10) [27] and found no effect on DNA methylation in this region (Figure 7).
Histone modifications associated with silent telomeric
regions
Little information is available about histone modifications in telomeric regions and no such information was
available for Neurospora. We therefore used chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to characterize key modifications of histones H3 and H4 associated with sequences
near Neurospora telomeres. Both marked and unmarked
telomeres were examined because of the possibility that
introduced markers could influence the epigenetic state of
the chromatin. Results from our genetic studies with dim5, hpo and nst mutants and from western blots suggested

that the TAS would at least sport methylated K9 on H3
and would perhaps also show hypoacetylated histones.
We found reproducible differences between telomeric
regions and interstitial euchromatic regions (for example,
histone H4 gene, hH4) and, interestingly, we also found
differences between the telomeric regions and interstitial
heterochromatic regions, that is, regions that had undergone RIP and whose DNA is methylated (8:F10). Like previously tested products of RIP bearing DNA methylation,
the marked (hph; Figure 6A) and unmarked (Tel IL & Tel
VIL; Figure 6B and 6C, respectively) telomere-associated
regions showed hypermethylation of H3 K9. Unlike interstitial heterochromatic sequences (Figure 6D and Honda
S, Lewis Z, Selker EU, unpublished), however, the telomere-associated regions showed a striking enrichment
for trimethylated H3 K27 and trimethylated H4 K20. In
addition, both the marked and unmarked telomeric
sequences showed hypoacetylation relative to the control
euchromatic sequence (hH4).
The triple nst mutant attenuated the hypermethylation of
H4 K20 and hypoacetylation of H3 and H4 at the marked
telomere (note the ratio of telomeric to euchromatic PCR
product normalized to the input DNA sample in Figure

6A). Whereas in the wild type the anti-histone H3 K9/K14
antibody produced a relative enrichment (hph/hH4) of 0.8
and the anti-tetracetylated histone H4 antibody produced
a relative enrichment of 0.6 (Figure 6A), both H3 (K9/14)
and H4 acetylation levels were equivalent for hph and hH4
in the nst triple mutant; thus, loss of silencing in the triple
nst mutant correlated with a level of histone acetylation at
telomeric hph typical of euchromatin. These results are
consistent with the western blot results showing increased
acetylation on both H3 and H4 in the nst triple mutant
(Figure 5A). Equivalent results were found for the 5' end
of the hph gene (shown in Figure 6A) and the middle of
the coding region (data not shown). Although the calculated enrichment of hph/hH4 for H3 K27 trimethylation
went up from 8.8 in wild type to 13.3 in the mutant, the
intensity of the PCR product is greatly reduced in the
mutant, which suggests that H3 K27 trimethylation of hph
is also reduced in the triple nst mutant. Although H3 trimethyl-K9, H3 trimethyl-K27, and H4 trimethyl-K20 were
enriched at the unmarked subtelomeric sequences, as for
the telomeric hph, these modifications appeared mostly
unchanged in the triple nst mutant. Only H3 trimethylK27 showed a reproducible change; it decreased about
two-fold in the mutant (Figure 6B and 6C). The nst mutations did not effect DNA methylation at non-telomeric
heterochromatic sequences (Figure 7, 8:F10) and also did
not appear to greatly affect histone modifications at the
region examined (8:F10; Figure 6D).
We also examined native Tel VIIL at the site where the bar
gene was silenced and found comparable patterns of
increased/decreased histone modifications, relative to
control euchromatic sequences (data not shown). Interestingly, we also found hypoacetylation of H3 and H4 at
all subtelomeric regions examined, including actively
transcribed genes. The Tel IL and VIL primers amplify
genes NCU10129.3 and NCU07143.3, respectively, both
of which we found to be active genes. Northern analysis
with RNA isolated from wild type and the triple nst strains
showed that the expression of these genes, like their histone acetylation status, was comparable in the wild type
and the triple nst mutant (Figure 8) [47,48]. In summary,
changes in histone modifications in the nst triple mutant
are localized to the Tel VR-targeted hph allele, with the
exception of a general effect of reduction of H3 trimethylK27.

Discussion
Structural similarities and differences between telomeres
of Neurospora and other model organisms
The structure of the currently known Neurospora telomere sequences [49] is quite simple. The length of Neurospora (TTAGGG)n repeats (~200 bp) is roughly ten-fold
less than in mammals [29]. Unlike other fungi and mammals (reviewed in [50]), subtelomeric regions in Neu-

Expression
Expression of genes near telomeres is unaffected by

(nst+) and N3132 (nst-1RIP1nst-3RIP1nst-5RIP1) and 20 g was
separated by agarose gel, blotted, and probed as described

rospora do not consist of tandem repeats and do not
contain a particular class of repeat element present at each
telomere, or even at a subset of the characterized telomeres. Rather, a short stretch of AT-rich DNA (roughly 2 kb
long but variable in length) separates the first telomere
repeat unit from the most telomere-proximal gene (Wu C,
Kim YS, Smith KM, Li W, Hood HM, Staben C, Selker EU,
Sachs MS, Farman ML, unpublished). The evolutionary
origin of this telomere arrangement likely reflects the
action of a genome defense system called RIP in Neurospora [38]. The RIP machinery detects duplicated
sequences and changes C:G to T:A base pairs, presumably
by deamination of cytosines or methylcytosines [51]. The
resulting AT-rich sequences serve as targets for the DNA
methyltransferase DIM-2 [23], which typically methylates
remaining cytosines [52-54]. Subtelomeric sequences of
Neurospora show hallmarks of RIP, namely a deficiency
of CpA dinucleotides and a corresponding overabundance of TpA dinucleotides, the RIP machinery's preferred
substrate and product, respectively [52], and DNA meth-

ylation (Tel VIIL; Figure 7). The current subtelomeric
sequences may have once shared homology that is now
unrecognizable because of RIP and evolutionary divergence.
Telomeric markers for Neurospora
The simple structure of Neurospora subtelomeres facilitated our strategy to insert selectable markers near Neurospora telomeres. For Tel VR, we chose to insert a copy of
hph within a Pogo transposon relic found directly adjacent
to the telomere repeat (Figure 2A). We also inserted the T
gene (encoding tyrosinase) at Tel VR, and expression of
this allele of T correlated with expression of hph in nst-1
and nst-3 strains (data not shown). We did not analyze
expression of this allele further as RIP may have been
induced by the native copy of T in the Neurospora
genome during successive crosses. For Tel VIIL, the bar and
ad-3A markers were inserted within the coding region of
an expressed gene, NCU09306.3, which is directly flanked
by an unnamed RIP-mutated repeated element found at
more than ten other chromosomal positions (none of
which is within 100 kb of a known telomere) and a CenVII-like RIP-mutated region, which directly flanks the
(TTAGGG)n telomere repeats (Figure 2). Thus, it is likely
that NCU09306.3 is embedded in heterochromatin even
though it is expressed, as is also the case for NCU10129.3,
at Tel IL (Figure 6B and 8). ChIP data supported this possibility, showing an enrichment of histone methylation
and absence of histone acetylation at the 3'end of
NCU09306.3 (data not shown). Most importantly, our
genetic data show that a marker inserted in NCU09306.3,
like one inserted into a non-genic region near another telomere, is subject to telomeric silencing involving both
histone deacetylation and histone methylation.
Involvement of histone deacetylases in telomeric silencing
The first evidence for telomeric silencing in Neurospora
came from our observation of increased expression of the
hph gene in a strain in which we had mutated nst-1, the
closest homologue of S. cerevisiae SIR2. We then found
evidence of extensive involvement of other deacetylases.
The role of protein deacetylases, such as HDACs, is complex because of their multiple and partially overlapping
functions. In S. pombe, telomeric silencing is dependent
on deacetylation of histone H3 K9 and H4 K16 by Sir2,
and subsequent methylation of histone H3 K9 [15,16]. A
Sir2 deletion strain showed increased H3 K9 and H3 K14
acetylation at a subtelomeric region, and reduced H3 K9
methylation and Swi6/HP1 binding. Mutation of the
Class I and II HDACs (Clr6 and Clr3, respectively) or
treatment with the Class I/II HDAC inhibitor TSA also
caused increased expression of telomere-linked genes
[55,56]. In human cells, TSA, but not the sirtuin inhibitor
sirtinol, caused derepression of a subtelomeric reporter
and mislocalization of HP1 [57]. A recent study, however,

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/1/1/5

showed SIRT6 is an H3 K9 deactylase that localizes to telomeres and is required for telomere integrity [58]. Little or
no effect on subtelomeric gene expression was observed in
mouse embryonic stem cells treated with TSA [59]. As
such negative results of drug treatment assays are difficult
to interpret, it remains possible that both Class I/II and III
HDACs are required for mammalian telomere silencing;
additional genetic studies may shed light on this.
Our finding that NST-1 is a NAD-dependent (Class III)
HDAC, as expected, fits our observation that nicotinamide is a potent inhibitor of telomeric silencing in Neurospora (Figure 4). The finding that TSA also interfered
with silencing strongly suggests that Class I or Class II
HDACs are also important. Thus, it should be interesting
to further explore the importance of both NAD-dependent and -independent HDACs in telomeric silencing.
Increased acetylation at H3 K9 would of course be
expected to interfere with methylation of this residue, but
various HDACs may also be involved in silencing at other
levels. For instance, N. crassa NST-1, S. pombe Sir2, S. cerevisiae Sir2p, and human HST-1 all appear to target H4 K16
for deacetylation. In the absence of these proteins,
increased H4 K16 acetylation may somehow interfere
with silencing. Our observation that loss of telomeric
silencing was enhanced when nicotinamide and TSA were
added in combination suggests overlapping roles of
HDACs of Class I/II and Class III. It should be interesting
to test mutants in the four Neurospora Class I and II
HDACs (hda-1 through hda-4) [31] for their involvement
in telomere silencing.
The finding that a triple nst mutant showed a greater
increase in histone acetylation, as assayed by western blot
of nuclear proteins and ChIP (Figures 5A and 7 and data
not shown), than the individual nst-1, -3, or -5 mutants
suggests that two or more of the nst genes have partially
overlapping functions. The nst-2 mutant had no discernable effect on silencing of the hph at Tel VR, but reduced
silencing of bar at Tel VIIL. Curiously, its closest homologues studied, S. cerevisiae Hst2 [36] and human SIRT2
[32], are cytosolic. Altogether, available information from
Neurospora and other organisms is most consistent with
all three classes of HDACs playing a role in telomeric
silencing. It is also important to note that while individual
mutants of nst-1, nst-3, or nst-5 caused a partial loss of telomeric silencing, there was no increase in histone acetylation assayed by western blot or ChIP in these mutants. It
is possible that one or more of these genes encodes a protein that causes an indirect effect on telomere silencing.
Trimethyl-K9 in histone H3 and HP1 are required for
telomeric silencing in Neurospora
We found that methylation of histone H3 K9, a mark produced by DIM-5 and required for DNA methylation

Page 12 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

Epigenetics & Chromatin 2008, 1:5

[24,25], is required for telomere silencing (Figure 3B and
3C) and enriched at all telomeres tested (Figure 6). Similarly, HP1, which binds methylated H3 K9 and is thought
to be essential for heterochromatin formation [26], is
required for telomere silencing (Figure 3B and 3C). ChIP
experiments showed that the silent hph transgene is
marked with H3 K9 trimethylation as well as trimethyl H3
K27 and H4 K20 (Figure 6). This is the first report of a role
for H3 K27 methylation in Neurospora, and an important
observation that shows Neurospora telomeres better
model mammalian telomeres than those of the yeasts,
which completely lack H3 K27 methylation (and DNA
methylation). All three histone methylation marks were
modestly reduced in an nst-1, -3, -5 triple mutant, with the
most striking reduction in H3 K27 methylation. Once the
histone methyltransferases (HKMTs) responsible for
methylation of H3 K27 and H4 K20 methylation are identified, it will be interesting to test whether these marks,
like H3 K9 methylation, are required for telomeric silencing. H3 K27 methylation was not observed in other
regions of heterochromatin (for example, 8:F10) so we
hypothesize it is involved in telomere silencing but not
DNA methylation.

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/1/1/5

mouse [60]. Shortening of telomeres associated with
aging is associated with changes in chromatin structure
that alter the expression of neighboring genes [61].
In summary, our study on the structure and expression of
sequences at Neurospora telomeres demonstrates the
existence of telomeric silencing in Neurospora. We show
important similarities, but also differences, in the silencing of markers integrated at subtelomeric regions. We also
showed that at least one member of the Neurospora sirtuin family of NAD-dependent HDACs, NST-1, is a bona
fide H4 K16 HDAC. Importantly, our work reveals an
additional role for H3 K9 methylation and HP1 in Neurospora, independent of DNA methylation. It also provides evidence for the involvement of multiple classes of
HDACs, including members of the NAD-dependent and independent classes, and H3 K27 and H4 K20 HMTs. One
major question remaining is how exactly heterochromatin is nucleated at Neurospora subtelomeres, as the Neurospora genome contains no good homologues of S.
pombe Taz1 or mammalian telomere repeat binding factors.

Methods
DNA methylation is not generally required for silencing at
Neurospora telomeres
Mutation of the dim-2 gene, which is responsible for all
known DNA methylation in Neurospora [23], did not
cause loss of silencing of the hph gene targeted to Tel VR
(Figure 3B). Similarly, treatment with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5AC did not relieve silencing (Figure 4B).
We conclude that the light DNA methylation observed at
telomere VR (Figure 7) is not required for silencing in this
region. This is consistent with the observation that 5AC
had no effect on silencing of a telomeric transgene in
human cancer cell lines [57]. Interestingly, telomeric
transgenes in mouse embryonic stem cell lines become
increasingly silenced and methylated as they are passaged
and the eventual tight silencing and DNA methylation are
reversible by 5AC [59].

In contrast to the situation at Tel VR, the sequences immediately proximal to Tel VIIL were significantly methylated
(Figure 7) and DNA methylation was responsible for
some silencing of bar inserted in this region. Mutation of
dim-2 or treatment with 5AC both relieved silencing (Figures 3 and 4). It is interesting that dim-5 and hpo are
required for telomeric silencing in Neurospora but DNA
methylation, although frequently present, is not universally required to maintain silencing. Our findings provide
the first examples of H3 K9 methylation acting to silence
a gene independently of DNA methylation in Neurospora.
It is noteworthy that mammals also use common factors
for DNA methylation and telomere silencing [1] and telomere length is regulated by H3 K9 specific HKMTs in

listed in Table 2). The BamHI+XbaI-digested PCR product
was cloned into the BamHI+XbaI-digested his-3 targeting
vector pBM61 [65], generating pBM61-Sir2. pBM61-Sir2
was linearized with NdeI and targeted to the his-3 locus in

showed RsaI RFLPs and was sequenced to identify the RIP
mutations.
The nst-2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA with
primers S2L1-EcoRI and S2L1-SpeI, digested with
EcoRI+SpeI, and cloned into EcoRI+SpeI-digested pBM61.
The resulting plasmid, pBM61-S2L1, was linearized with
NdeI and targeted to his-3 in strains N1445 and N1674.
To mutate nst-3, the gene was amplified with primers
S2L2-EcoRI and S2L2-Not1, digested with EcoRI+NotI,
and cloned into EcoRI+NotI-digested pBM61. The resulting plasmid, pBM61-S2L2, was linearized with NdeI and
targeted his-3 in strains N1445 and N1674. For both nst-2
and nst-3, His+ transformants of N1445 and N1674 were
crossed to each other and progeny were analyzed for evidence of RIP by Southern blotting of RsaI-digested DNA;
RIP mutated alleles were then sequenced.
The nst-5 gene was amplified with primers 203-4 and 2035, digested with BamHI+PacI and inserted into
BamHI+PacI-digested pMF272 [66]. The resulting plasmid, pKA13, was linearized with DraI and targeted to his3 in strain N1674. A His+ transformant was crossed to
strain N1447 and two progeny with duplications were
then crossed to induce RIP. Southern analysis revealed
RFLPs in strain N2681; thus the endogenous allele was
sequenced.
Insertion of markers at telomeres
The bacterial hph gene under the control of the constitutive trpC promoter was removed from pCSN43 [67] by
digestion with SalI and ligated to XhoI-digested pGRG-1/
TYR103 [68] to generate pCM8. To generate pCM11,
pCM8 was digested with PvuII and the hph fragment was
ligated to HpaI-digested pNC36 [3], which contains the
Pogo transposon from the subtelomere of linkage group
VR. BsiWI-digested pCM11 was used to transform strain
N1982 (derived from a cross between strains N2225 and
N565, which was derived from a cross between strains
N564 and N534). Correct integration at LG VR was confirmed by Southern blotting in the transformant, N2292,
and this strain was backcrossed to strain N534 and WT
(N2285). We identified nst-1RIP1 progeny that retained
telVR::hph::T for further study (strains N2284, N2288). A
Southern blot demonstrating subtelomeric integration is
shown in Figure 3. The nst-3RIP1 allele was then introduced
by crossing N2284 and N2634 to obtain strains N2635
and N2636. Strains N2288 and N2634 were also crossed
to generate N2664, which was crossed to strains N1275
(dim-2), N2140 (dim-5), N2552 (hpo) and N2681 (nst-5)
to introduce the designated mutation (yielding strains
N2833, N2997, N3004, and 2693, respectively). N2633
(nst-2) was crossed to N2284 to generate N2667. N2636
was crossed to N2693 to generate the triple nst mutant,
N3132. A nst+ strain (N3120) and nst-1RIP1 (N3125), nst-

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/1/1/5

3RIP1 (N3132) and nst-5RIP1 (N3130) siblings from this
cross were also selected for further study. Complete genotypes are listed in Table 1.
The ad-3A coding region with its promoter was amplified
from genomic DNA with primers ad-3AF and ad-3AR. To
generate pTTK17, the ad-3A PCR product was digested
with NotI+BamHI and ligated to pBARKS1 [69] digested
with the same enzymes. Plasmid pBARKS1 contains the
bar gene under the control of the trpC promoter, which
allows selection for glufosinate ('Basta') resistance. A
region near Tel VIIL (324–1306 bp from the chromosome
end) was amplified by PCR with primers Tel7L5FAatII and
Tel7L5RPmlI, digested with PmlI+AatII and ligated to
pTTK17 DNA that had been digested with the same
enzymes, yielding plasmid pTTK18. A second region of
Tel VIIL (1310–2319 bp from the chromosome end) was
amplified
with
primers
Tel7L3FBamHI
and
Tel7L3REcoRI, digested with BamHI+EcoRI and ligated to
pTTK18 digested with the same enzymes, yielding the
gene targeting vector pTTK19. AlwNI-linearized pTTK19
was transformed into N3017 and BastaR colonies were
selected. Following confirmation of correct insertion by
PCR analysis and Southern blotting (Figure 3), one transformant (N3440) was crossed to strains N2130 (nst-1),
N2633 (nst-2), N2921 (nst-3), N2693 (nst-5), N1877
(dim-2), and N2264 (dim-5). Progeny that retained the bar
marker at Tel VIIL but not the mus52::hph+ allele, and
that also included the desired nst and dim mutations, were
selected for further studies.
The same ad-3A bar construct was also targeted to the subtelomeric region of Tel IIR. A region near Tel IIR (1444–
2472 bp from the chromosome end) was amplified with
primers Tel2R3FBam and Tel2R3REco, digested with
BamHI+EcoRI and ligated to pBARKS1 [69] digested with
the same enzymes, yielding plasmid pTTK20. The ad-3A
region was amplified and inserted into pTTK20 as
described above, yielding pTTK21. A second region of Tel
IIR (259–1278 bp from the chromosome end) was amplified with primers Tel2R5FAatII and Tel2R5RPmlI,
digested with AatII+PmlI and ligated to pTTK21 DNA
digested with the same enzymes, yielding gene targeting
vector pTTK22. AlwNI-linearized pTTK22 was transformed into N3017 and BastaR colonies were selected. Following confirmation of correct insertion by PCR analysis
and Southern blotting (Figure 3), one transformant
(N3456) was crossed to strains N2130 (nst-1), N2633
(nst-2), N2921 (nst-3), N2693 (nst-5), N1275 (dim-2),
and N2264 (dim-5). As above, progeny that retained the
bar marker at Tel IIR but not the mus52::hph+ allele, and
that also carried the desired nst and dim mutations were
selected for further studies.

Telomeric silencing assay
Conidia from strain N3120 (telVR::hph+) or N3441 (tel
VIIL::bar+) were collected in water from flasks containing
Vogel's minimal medium, 2% sucrose, 1.5% agar and
appropriate supplements after 1 week of growth at 32°C.
Roughly 1000 conidia were spread on Vogel's minimal
agar plates with 2% sorbose, 0.05% fructose and 0.05%
glucose (FGS) and allowed to dry briefly. Nicotinamide
was included in agar medium at 1 mg/ml. For the other
drugs, 2 mm × 2 mm filter paper squares soaked with 0.5
l 5-aza-cytidine (Sigma; 24 mM in H2O) or 2 l Trichostatin A (Wako; 33 mM in DMSO) were placed in the
center of the plate. After 5 hr at 32°C, 5 ml 0.7% top agar
with 3 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Hyg; Hygrogold, InvivoGen) was overlaid for a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml.
For Basta selection, Vogel's salt solution with low nitrogen
was used in all media [39]. For better imaging of smaller
colonies on Basta selection plates we avoided top agar and
instead 20 mg/ml Basta isolated from Rely (Bayer) [70]
was poured in 5 ml of bottom agar, then 20 ml of nonselective media was overlaid for a final concentration of 4
mg/ml Basta. Plates were photographed after an additional 2 days of incubation at room temperature. To assay
the effect of nicotinamide on expression of hph located at
a telomere or at an interstitial location flanked by amRIP
sequences, nicotinamide and Hyg were both added
directly to agar medium and roughly 105 conidia were
spread. Photographs were taken after 2 days of incubation
at 32°C.
Spot tests of mutants
To assay Hyg resistance, conidia were collected in water
from flasks containing Vogel's minimal medium, 2%
sucrose, 1.5% agar plus supplements following 1 week of
growth at 32°C. Conidial suspensions were counted in a
hemocytometer and serial dilutions were plated on
Vogel's FGS agar medium with the same supplements, in
the presence or absence of 1 mg/ml Hyg. Strains were
allowed to grow for 2 days at 32°C. To test Basta resistance
[39], conidia were prepared as above and plated on supplemented Vogel's FGS media prepared with low nitrogen
and 1.5% agar in the presence or absence of 2 mg/ml
Basta.
Southern blots
Genomic DNA was isolated from 2-day cultures in Vogel's
liquid medium as described [53]. Approximately 0.5 g
DNA was digested overnight with the designated restriction endonuclease and fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels.
Transfer to nylon membranes and blotting were performed as described [53].
Western blots
Nuclei were isolated as described [71] with the addition of
HDAC inhibitors, TSA (1 M, Wako) and sodium butyrate

http://www.epigeneticsandchromatin.com/content/1/1/5

(50 mM, J.T. Baker). Nuclear proteins were fractionated by
10% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to PVDF membrane
(Millipore Immobilon-P) in 10 mM N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS), pH 11 with 20% methanol, blots were probed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
plus 3% non-fat dry milk with the following antibodies
diluted as recommended by the manufacturer: -H3
(Abcam ab1791), -H3 acetyl K9 (Abcam ab4441), -H3
acetyl K14 (Upstate 06–911), -H3 acetyl K9/K14
(Upstate 06–599), -H4 tetra-acetyl (Upstate 06–866)
and -H4 acetyl K16 (Upstate 07–329). Antibody detection was performed as described [25].
Histone deacetylase assays
NST-1 was expressed as a GST fusion protein for in vitro
activity assays. The nst-1 coding region was amplified with
primers Nst1BamHI and Nst1NotI, digested with
BamHI+NotI and cloned into BamHI+NotI-digested
pGEX-5X-2 (GE Healthcare). The protein was expressed in
E. coli strain BL21, induced with IPTG and purified on glutathione agarose (Sigma) in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM DTT). Following elution with reduced
glutathione, the GST fusion protein was dialyzed against
RIPA buffer with 25% glycerol. In vitro activity assays were
performed as described [15].
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
ChIP experiments were performed as described [25] with
the antibodies above and with -H3 trimethyl K9 [72], H3 trimethyl K27 (Upstate 07–449), and -H4 trimethyl
K20 (Upstate 07–463). Primers used for the detection of
precipitated DNA fragments are listed in Table 2. PCR
reactions were repeated at least two times for each of two
independent ChIP experiments.
