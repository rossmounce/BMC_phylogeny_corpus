Abstract
Background: We have analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of 22 Pan paniscus (bonobo, pygmy
chimpanzee) individuals to assess the detailed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny of this close relative of
Homo sapiens.
Results: We identified three major clades among bonobos that separated approximately 540,000 years ago, as
suggested by Bayesian analysis. Incidentally, we discovered that the current reference sequence for bonobo likely is
a hybrid of the mitochondrial genomes of two distant individuals. When comparing spectra of polymorphic
mtDNA sites in bonobos and humans, we observed two major differences: (i) Of all 31 bonobo mtDNA
homoplasies, i.e. nucleotide changes that occurred independently on separate branches of the phylogenetic tree,
13 were not homoplasic in humans. This indicates that at least a part of the unstable sites of the mitochondrial
genome is species-specific and difficult to be explained on the basis of a mutational hotspot concept. (ii) A
comparison of the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (dN/dS) among polymorphic positions in
bonobos and in 4902 Homo sapiens mitochondrial genomes revealed a remarkable difference in the strength of
purifying selection in the mitochondrial genes of the F0F1-ATPase complex. While in bonobos this complex
showed a similar low value as complexes I and IV, human haplogroups displayed 2.2 to 7.6 times increased dN/dS
ratios when compared to bonobos.
Conclusions: Some variants of mitochondrially encoded subunits of the ATPase complex in humans very likely
decrease the efficiency of energy conversion leading to production of extra heat. Thus, we hypothesize that the
species-specific release of evolutionary constraints for the mitochondrial genes of the proton-translocating ATPase
is a consequence of altered heat homeostasis in modern humans.

Background
The complete mitochondrial genome sequences of
hominid species have been known for a while [1-3] and
were frequently used in studies aiming to understand
important aspects of human evolution [4,5]. While several thousand complete mitochondrial genomes from
various modern human populations are available to date
and complete mitochondrial genomes of six Neandertal
individuals have been recently sequenced [4,5], the number of available individual mitochondrial sequences is
very limited in non-human hominid species. The GenBank database contains at present only two complete

mitochondrial genomes from Gorilla gorilla [GenBank:
NC_011120, GenBank:NC_001645], two from Pan troglodytes [GenBank:NC_001643, GenBank:EU095335] and
only a single mitochondrial genome from Pan paniscus
[GenBank:NC_001644]. Studies addressing the mitochondrial DNA diversity of non-human hominids were,
therefore, restricted to short regions of the mitochondrial genome, most typically parts of the non-coding
and highly variable D-loop [6-9], but also cytochrome c
oxidase subunit, COII [10], NADH dehydrogenase subunit, ND2 [11], or ribosomal genes [12]. These studies
provided valuable information about the diversity of
these species. However, analyses based on low numbers
of polymorphic sites in short sequences are always at
risk of being biased through high standard errors and
gene-specific differences.

The power of analyzing a large number of complete
mitochondrial genomes within a species was demonstrated in humans [13-15]. Analysis of within-species
polymorphisms confirmed that purifying selection is the
major force shaping human mitochondrial DNA diversity, but an impact of adaptive selection was suggested
for haplogroups exposed to cold climates. It was
hypothesized that a slightly decreased efficiency of mitochondria in synthesizing ATP by oxidative phosphorylation might be advantageous at cold temperatures due to
dissipation of more heat [15]. Others questioned
whether adaptive selection is the most plausible explanation for specific patterns of mtDNA diversity in human
haplogroups [16]. A functional analysis of different
mitochondrial genomes from African and Arctic haplogroups could not detect a potential bioenergetic relevance of the specific mtDNA variants [17].
Here we investigate the diversity of the mitochondrial
genome in bonobos, and compare it to 4902 publicly
available complete human mitochondrial genomes.
Bonobos have been inhabiting a well defined territory in
the Congo basin surrounded by rivers [9]. This means
that, in contrast to Homo sapiens, the bonobo population did not undergo dramatic expansion and migration,
and was not exposed to extreme climates. Therefore,
the genetic diversity seen in this species can be largely
attributed to random genetic drift within a rather stable
population of individuals, and thus can serve as a good
reference to unravel specific features of human evolution. Since our analysis included all 13 mitochondrial
encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, we were able to investigate gene-specific differences of evolutionary constraints between Pan paniscus
and Homo sapiens.

Results
Three clades of bonobo mtDNA phylogeny

To obtain a preliminary picture on the mtDNA diversity
of the available bonobo samples, we sequenced the noncoding D-loop region and neighboring parts of the mitochondrial genome in a total number of 31 samples.
Twenty-two individuals with distinct partial genotypes
were then selected for complete mitochondrial genome
sequencing. The sequences have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank:GU189657-GU189677, GenBank:
HM015213]. Comparison of previously reported short
D-loop sequences from 60 bonobo individuals [8,9] with
the corresponding regions of the 22 new complete
sequences demonstrates, as shown by a neighbor-joining
tree (Additional file 1 Figure S1), that all major bonobo
subgroups are represented in our sample. In order to be
able to perform site-by-site comparisons with the 4902
Homo sapiens sequences that were available at the GenBank database at the date of this study, we aligned all

Page 2 of 11

sequences to the human mtDNA reference sequence
(revised Cambridge Reference Sequence, rCRS [18]), and
annotated polymorphic positions according to the rCRS
numbering. We found 1287 differences to the rCRS that
were stable in all bonobo sequences, and 364 positions
that were polymorphic between bonobos.
Pairwise comparison of complete bonobo mitochondrial genomes (Figure 1A) showed a multimodal distribution, one set of pairs with less than 95 differences and
a second, sharper peak representing 145 to 175 differences between sequences. This distribution is indicative
of a stable demographic history, and suggests a lack of
population expansion [9]. We compared the diversity of
bonobo sequences with humans, by selecting 21 previously published sequences representing the major
mitochondrial haplogroups. Additionally, recently published Neandertal mitochondrial genomes were included
in the analysis (Figure 1B). Pairwise nucleotide differences show that the genetic diversity within the most
diverse bonobo groups is comparable with the diversity
of modern humans. The maximal nucleotide difference
between bonobo groups is, however, 1.5 times higher
than in humans, and thus somewhat closer to the distance between modern humans and the extinct Neandertal. Based on the molecular clock theory and
assuming that the human-chimpanzee divergence happened 6 to 8 million years ago [19-21], Bayesian analysis
of mtDNA sequences suggests that the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) of modern bonobos lived
540,000 (430,000- 660,000; 95% credibility interval) years
ago.
A more detailed picture of bonobo diversity is shown
by the neighbor-joining tree of all 22 complete mitochondrial genomes using two Pan troglodytes genomes
as outgroup (Figure 2). The detailed list of branch-specific mutation can be found in Additional file 2 Figure S2.
Similarly to previous studies based on short D-loop
sequences [8,9], most bonobo sequences belong to one
of the two major groups (’A’ and ‘B’ in Figure 2).
Sequences belonging to haplogroup A show a low diversity between each other. It has to be mentioned, however, that two subgroups that are distinguishable within
haplogroup A based on their HVRI (hypervariable
region I) haplotypes [GenBank:AF176761, GenBank:
AJ829459, GenBank:AJ829458, GenBank:AF137484,
GenBank:AJ829461] and [GenBank:AF137486, GenBank:
AF137485] (cf. Additional file 1 Figure S1) are not
represented in our sample. The other large haplogroup
(’B’) displays a regular tree structure. Two D-loop
sequences [GenBank:AF176762, GenBank:AF137491] (cf.
Additional file 1 Figure S1) in previous studies showed a
weak association with haplogroup B [9]. The corresponding two sequences (PP56 [GenBank:GU189665]
and PP69 [GenBank: GU189670]) in our neighbor-

joining tree of complete sequences were placed outside
of the groups ‘A’ and ‘B’. Since the two outlier
sequences showed similar pairwise differences to
sequences in haplogroups A and B, we conclude that
PP56, PP69 and the two previously reported D-loop
sequences [GenBank:AF176762, GenBank:AF137491]
represent a third distinct linage (’C’) of bonobos.
Before the present study, there was only a single complete bonobo mtDNA sequence available in public databases [GenBank:NC_001644] [1], which also served as
reference sequence at early stages of our study. Neighbor-joining algorithms place this sequence within the
haplogroup A when complete sequences are analyzed
(data not shown). Indeed, the coding region of the database sequence (PPRefCOD in Additional file 2 Figure
S2) carries all mutations that are present in one of our
haplogroup A sequences (PP23). In contrast, the D-loop
region of the database sequence (PPRefDL in Additional
file 2 Figure S2) is clearly related to sequence PP10 that
belongs to a subgroup within haplogroup B. Although,
an extraordinary recombination event between the two
major bonobo haplogroups could explain this discrepancy and cannot fully be excluded, we suspect that
sequence [GenBank:NC_001644] is a hybrid sequence of
two bonobo individuals. Therefore, we suggest it to be
depreciated as reference sequence. Instead, the closest
sequence, PP23 [GenBank:GU189661], could be used as
the new reference sequence for the Pan paniscus mitochondrial genome.
Species-specific homoplasies in bonobos

On the basis of the detailed mtDNA phylogeny of Pan
paniscus we were able to identify 31 homoplasic sites
(Table 1), i.e. nucleotide changes with multiple occurrences in independent bonobo lineages. According to
current hypotheses, such homoplasies arise due to an
increased instability of the specific positions (’hotspots’
leading to recurrent or backward mutations [22]). We
examined each of the bonobo homoplasies for the variability of the respective sites in humans. We found that
among the 31 bonobo homoplasic positions 8 were
stable in humans (either they were identical in all complete human mtDNA sequences, or occurred only in a
single sequence or a single group). When classifying
human polymorphic positions with very low allele frequency (< 0.25%) also as non-homoplasic, the amount
of bonobo-specific homoplasies was even higher (13/31,
42%).
Some authors previously reported that species-specific
mutational hotspots exist in primates [23], however,
without being able to propose underlying molecular
mechanisms. The only well recognized mechanism up
to date to explain increased instability of certain sites in
the mitochondrial genome is the neighborhood effect,

Page 4 of 11

when a nucleotide change affects the stability of some
sites in its nearest vicinity [24]. To test whether the
apparent species-specific instability of some of the positions in our investigated bonobo population might be
caused by altered sequence context in the close vicinity
of the particular sites, we searched for stable differences
between humans and bonobos within a 5-nucleotide distance from homoplasic positions. Stable between-species
nucleotide changes were detected in the vicinity of 5
bonobo-specific homoplasic sites (5/13, 38%), while the
neighborhoods of the other 8 sites were identical
between most humans and bonobos (Table 1). The ratio
of neighborhood changes for the complete set of polymorphic bonobo sites was higher (210/364, 58%; difference not significant), clearly demonstrating that
bonobo-specific homoplasic sites are not clustered
around fixed inter-species nucleotide changes. Therefore, the neighborhood effect cannot explain the existence of more than half of the bonobo-specific
homoplasies.
It is interesting to mention that most previously
reported human homoplasic sites were apparently stable
in our sample of bonobos. From the lists of human parallel mutations in the study of Finnilä et al. [25], none
of the homoplasies in the coding region and only 5 out
of 49 D-loop homoplasies were found to be homoplasic
in bonobos. The human hypervariable length polymorphism at position 309 (alternatively numbered as
303) was also homoplasic in bonobos, but another
hypervariable position, 16519, was identical in all
bonobo individuals. None of the human coding region
homoplasies reported by Elson et al. [26] was homoplasic in bonobos.
Evolutionary constraints in hominid mitochondrial
genomes

To investigate evolutionary constraints, we counted the
number of within-species non-synonymous (N) and
synonymous (S) mtDNA nucleotide changes in bonobos.
We also determined these values for polymorphic
mtDNA positions in recently published complete
mtDNA sequences of Neandertals and publicly available
mtDNA sequences of major human haplogroups (Figure
3A and Additional file 3 Figure S3). For each group, we
calculated dN/dS values that describe the relation of the
actual non-synonymous/synonymous ratio to the nonsynonymous/synonymous ratio of all theoretically possible nucleotide changes in the specific sequence [27].
The mitochondrial encoded subunits of complexes III
and IV showed comparable dN/dS ratios both in bonobos and the investigated human haplogroups. Values in
complex III were found twice as high as in complex IV
(P < 0.05 in bonobos; P < 0.0005 in humans), which is
in line with previous reports from other organisms

pointing to strong evolutionary constraints in cytochrome c oxidase [28]. The uniformly low dN/dS values
for complex I in humans also suggest a strong purifying
selection that is even more pronounced in bonobos.
While the low dN/dS ratio of complex V genes in bonobos was comparable to those of complexes I and IV, the
d N /d S ratio of complex V genes in humans showed
notably elevated values (P < 5 × 10-6). Among the major
human haplogroups, superhaplogroup L, containing
most African clades, displayed the lowest dN/dS value
(0.299), still 2.6-fold higher than in bonobos (P = 0.05).
We observed the highest value in the superhaplogroup
N, where most European haplogroups belong, with
0.432 (3.8-fold of that in bonobos; P = 0.0048). When
examining smaller haplogroups in detail (Additional file
3 Figure S3), we found the lowest value in the group of
San (haplogroup L0a’), the most ancient human

haplogroup (0.249; 2.2-fold of that in bobonos; difference not significant), while the highest dN/dS value was
observed in haplogroup A (0.879; 7.6-fold of that in
bonobos; P = 0.0003). Haplogroup A is one of the major
haplogroups that gave rise to Native American populations by migrating from Eastern Asia through the Bering
land bridge [29,30]. Other haplogroups with similar
demographic history (C and D) did not show such an
exceptionally high dN/dS value (Additional file 3 Figure
S3). No dN/dS value could be calculated for complex V
in Neandertals, because none of the reported complete
Neandertal sequences contained any mutation in the
two mitochondrial genes for the ATPase subunits.
Next, we compared between-species stable nucleotide
changes in gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans
(Figure 3B). This analysis confirmed the relevance of
strong purifying selection against non-synonymous

polymorphisms. A similar decreased ratio of non-synonymous nucleotide changes at the between-species scale
was observed for complex III, although, the evolutionary
constraints were in general weaker compared to complex IV. Complex V contained the highest portion of

between-species non-synonymous changes in bonobos,
chimps and gorillas (significantly different from complex
IV, P < 0.0005), but this value was much lower in
humans (no significant difference from other complexes). This suggests that complex V was under a relatively strong constraint after the divergence of the
human branch from the Homo/Pan/Gorilla common

ancestor, but the strength of the purifying selection
decreased dramatically after modern humans emerged
and spread around the world.

Discussion
In this study we present 22 complete mitochondrial genomes from individuals of the species Pan paniscus, the
closest extant relatives of today’s modern humans beside
chimpanzees. Previous studies have explored the phylogeny of bonobos by investigating short sequences in
many individuals [6-12], however, only comparison of
complete mitochondrial genomes can provide means to
reveal gene-specific differences in the degree of diversity
and the strength of evolutionary constraints.
The phylogenetic tree of bonobos presented here,
based on complete mitochondrial genomes, is in line
with the previously published D-loop tree [8,9], demonstrating that HVRI sequencing can be a useful tool for
investigating genetic diversity at small time scales. In
accordance with the high variability of the D-loop [22],
the majority of homoplasic sites, i.e. nucleotide changes
that occur multiple times in independent bonobo
lineages, were detected in the D-loop. Most of these
homoplasic D-loop polymorphisms were also homoplasic in humans, thus, these sites can be considered as
species-independent mutational hotspots. In contrast,
many of the bonobo homoplasic positions in the much
less variable coding region were stable in humans. Similarly, previously reported human coding region homoplasies were all found stable in bonobos. It is still not
clear what causes certain sites to show apparent instability in one species while being stable in a closely related
species. We investigated one possible mechanism for
species-specific homoplasies, the effect of nucleotide
changes in the close vicinity of polymorphic sites. We
found that the majority of the bonobo-specific homoplasies were located in regions that were identical between
humans and bonobos. Thus, a considerable portion of
bonobo-specific homoplasies cannot be explained by
between-species differences in the sequence context.
Whether the broader mtDNA context or changes in the
nuclear background can account for species-specific
instability of certain mtDNA sites, or the apparent
mtDNA instability might be a consequence of heteroplasmy-related phenomena [31,32], remains to be
elucidated.
The comparison between the D-loop regions of the 22
new complete bonobo mitochondrial genomes, and a
previously reported bonobo D-loop tree [8,9] revealed
that, despite the limited number of individuals, the
group of bonobos investigated in this study well represents the entire known bonobo population. Beside the
two previously described haplogroups of bonobos [9],
the analysis of complete mtDNA sequences made it

Page 7 of 11

possible to distinguish a third major bonobo lineage.
Notably, this particular bonobo clade carried the lineage-specific mutation, m.8344A>G, in the mitochondrial
gene for tRNA-Lys (MT-TK). This mutation is one of
the most frequent pathogenic mtDNA mutations in
humans, and associated with the MERRF syndrome
(myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers; MIM
545000 [33]). Apparently, the pathogenic effect of this
particular mutation might be compensated by a neighboring mutation in the tRNA-Lys gene, m.8343A>G,
that is present in all Pan sequences.
The number of pairwise nucleotide differences
between members of the three major bonobo haplogroups was 1.5 times higher than the maximum pairwise differences between modern humans, placing the
time of the most recent common ancestor of today’s
bonobos somewhat between that of modern humans
and the Neandertals. This substantial diversity of mitochondrial genomes suggests that a recent population
bottleneck hypothesized for humans [1], did not take
place in bonobos. An important incidental finding,
revealed by the phylogenetic tree, is that the only complete bonobo mtDNA sequence available to date in the
GenBank database, also used as the bonobo mtDNA
reference sequence, is probably an artificial hybrid of
two sequences belonging to two different major
haplogroups.
The sequence information on the entire mitochondrial
genomes of 22 bonobo individuals allowed us to compare the genetic diversity of different mitochondrial
genes and estimate possible evolutionary constraints acting on these genes. For this we grouped protein coding
genes of the complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS), and analyzed them for the ratio of withinspecies non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide
polymorphisms, a well established marker of evolutionary constraints. Any value of d N/dS below 1 indicates
that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
changes is less than the ratio of theoretically possible
non-synonymous to synonymous changes, and is considered to be a sign of negative selection against nonsynonymous, potentially deleterious mutations [27]. Not
only in bonobos but also in all analyzed human haplogroups, all four mitochondrial encoded OXPHOS
complexes displayed values below 1, indicating that
negative selection is the major force shaping the
mtDNA diversity in these species.
When searching for species-specific changes in selection patterns, we found that genes coding for subunits
of the proton-translocating ATPase (complex V of the
oxidative phosphorylation) showed the most striking difference between bonobos and humans. While in bonobos the strength of within-species evolutionary
constraints in the ATPase genes was comparable to that

Zsurka et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:270
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/270

of complexes I and IV, most human haplogroups displayed d N /d S values in the ATPase genes that were
higher than any of the other mitochondrial OXPHOS
complexes. In contrast, between-species nucleotide
changes showed high proportion of non-synonymous
changes for ATPase in the branches of bonobos, chimps
and gorillas, but were less frequent in humans (cf. last
clusters of Figure 3A and 3B). We interpret these findings as evidence for a strong species-specific evolutionary constraint on the mitochondrial subunits of ATPase
after the divergence of humans from the common
Homo/Pan/Gorilla ancestor, which constraint was, however, released when modern humans migrated from
Africa and populated the world.
This finding is further underlined by the potential
severity of amino acid changes caused by the detected
non-synonymous mutations in complex V. As shown in
Additional file 4 Table S1, human haplogroup A displays
a higher frequency of more severe amino acid changes
than the most ancient human haplogroup (haplogroup
L0a’) or bonobos. Since complex V synthesizes ATP driven by proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane, it is very likely that severe amino acid
changes in both subunits of this complex might have a
crucial influence on the efficiency of the energy conversion [34]. Lower efficiency would mean that a higher
proportion of the electrochemical proton gradient is dissipated in the form of heat. In line with this, it was previously hypothesized that a mildly increased heat
production by mitochondria might have an advantageous effect in adaptation to cold climates, i.e. ATPase
polymorphisms could undergo positive selection [15].
Bonobos have been inhabiting a well defined territory
in the Congo basin with rather constant climate conditions and with large rivers as natural borders [9]. Therefore, the effect of climate adaptation must be negligible
in bonobos, in sharp contrast to humans, who successfully populated extreme climate zones. In light of our
data suggesting released evolutionary constraints for the
OXPHOS complex V, one might hypothesize that while
spreading out of Africa, humans escaped an important
environmental factor that was limiting their evolution.
This factor could be high temperature (i.e. less efficient
complex V and the resulting increased heat production
could result in body overheating at high temperatures).
Climate is, however, unlikely the only reason for the
weaker purifying selection for complex V genes in
humans. The human superhaplogroup L that includes
most African lineages showed a more than twice as high
d N /d S value as bonobos, despite the fact that these
lineages, not leaving Africa, were also not exposed to
extreme climates. Certain physiological changes (e.g.
loss of body hair, high density of eccrine sweat glands,
bipedalism) might have rendered increased heat

production, caused by slightly deleterious ATPase mutation, less harmful in humans. This assumption is in line
with hypotheses suggesting that improved heat homeostasis was an important factor in human evolution
[35,36]. A further reason for the relaxation of purifying
selection in humans might be the less intense sperm
competition as compared to bonobos [37,38]. Although,
a selection based on the energetic performance of the
sperm is not expected to influence the transmission of
mtDNA variants directly (because of the maternal
inheritance of mtDNA), it still might have an indirect
effect through the selection pressure on nuclear genes
relevant for mitochondrial function.
Beside the difference of purifying selection in humans
and bonobos, we also observed differences between
human haplogroups. Of all investigated human clades,
African haplogroups, and the San in particular, showed
the lowest dN/dS values in the ATPase genes. The higher
dN/dS values in other populations that left Africa could
be accounted for environmental factors. Notably, the
highest ATPase dN/dS value was observed in haplogroup
A, one of the three major clades giving rise to the
Native American population after migrating from Asia
through the Bering land bridge. The dN/dS value in haplogroup A was close to 1, suggesting an almost complete
lack of purifying selection in the ATPase genes. However, other haplogroups (C and D) that migrated
through the same route did not show comparably high
dN/dS values (Additional file 3 Figure S3). Therefore, we
conclude, in agreement with others [16], that the
observed increase of dN/dS values for the mitochondrial
ATPase genes in humans cannot be interpreted in favor
of positive selection at colder climate conditions, but
rather is the result of the release of strong evolutionary
constraints during population expansion and migration
of modern humans.

Conclusions
We have sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome
of 22 Pan paniscus individuals. The analysis of the 22
new complete mtDNA sequences revealed the existence
of three major lineages in the bonobo phylogeny. Out of
these three lineages only two were identified previously,
when the analysis was restricted to the highly polymorphic D-loop region of the mitochondrial genome.
Comparing the new sequences with the only complete
bonobo mtDNA sequence that had been available in
public databases before the present study, we found that
the database sequence is very likely a hybrid of
sequences from two different bobono haplogroups. We
analyzed the spectrum of nucleotide changes with multiple occurrences in independent bonobo lineages (homoplasies) and examined the stability of these homoplasic
sites in humans. We found that 13 of 31 bonobo

Zsurka et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:270
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/270

homoplasies were species-specific, and as such are difficult to be explained by the mutational hotspot hypothesis. The most striking difference between bonobo and
human mtDNA diversity we observed when comparing
the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations
in different protein coding genes of the mitochondrial
genome. The mitochondrial subunits of the protontranslocating ATPase complex showed a significantly
increased rate of amino acid changing mutations within
human haplogroups in comparison to bonobos. We
hypothesize that changes of the ATPase complex that
reduce the efficiency of ATP synthesis and increase heat
production were rendered less harmful due to alterations of the heat homeostasis in humans.

Methods
DNA samples

Multiple buccal swab samples from bonobos living in
zoos of Cologne and Frankfurt were obtained by keepers
of the animals. Total DNA was isolated from buccal
swabs using the QiaAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Further bonobo DNA samples were kindly
provided by the EUPRIM-NET Project (Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands), and
the Gene Bank of Primates (German Primate Centre,
Göttingen, Germany). Additional samples were obtained
by KK from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, New Jersey, USA). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Bonn (reference number 128/09).
mtDNA sequencing

A set of 28 primer pairs was used to amplify overlapping
mtDNA fragments from bonobo DNA samples. To avoid
sample mix up, each individual was processed separately.
Direct sequencing of the purified PCR products was carried out on an automatic sequence analyzer by a commercial sequencing service (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg,
Germany). Sequence reads were confirmed manually and
complete mtDNA sequences were assembled using the
SeqMan module of the Lasergene 8.0 software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA). Complete mtDNA sequences
have been deposited in GenBank [GenBank:GU189657GU189677 and GenBank:HM015213].
Phylogenetic analyses

To be able to compare hominid mtDNA sequences to
each other, as well as, to 4902 human database
sequences, all sequences were aligned to the human
reference sequence (revised Cambridge Reference
Sequence, rCRS, NC_012920 [18]) with the ClustalX 2
software [39]. Alignments were verified and corrected
manually using the MEGA 4.0 program [40]. The annotation of polymorphic positions, including nucleotide
positions within genes and amino acid positions with

Page 9 of 11

eventual amino acid changes for protein coding genes,
were done automated based on the rCRS annotation list
using the core algorithm of the MitoWheel web application [41]. In cases of double annotations in the short
overlapping regions between the genes MT-ND4L and
MT-ND4 and between genes MT-ATP8 and MT-ATP6,
polymorphisms were ranked according to the severer
change. Total numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous sites were calculated using the DnaSP v4.50.3
program [42]. For the comparison of human haplogroups, sequences were grouped based on the presence or absence of group-defining mtDNA mutations.
Haplogroup defining mutations are listed in Additional
file 5 Table S2. Statistical significance was assessed by
two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. Neighbor-joining trees
were generated with the ClustalX 2 program [39]. We
estimated the posterior distribution of divergence times
using the mcmctree program [43] with parameters as
described for the analysis of the Neandertal mtDNA [4],
assuming that the chimpanzee-human divergence happened 6-8 million years ago [19-21]. The analysis
included, apart from the 22 new bonobo mtDNA
sequences, two gorilla sequences, two chimpanzee
sequences, and 21 human sequences representing all the
major human haplogroups.
