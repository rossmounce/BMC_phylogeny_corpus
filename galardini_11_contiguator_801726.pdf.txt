CONTIGuator: a bacterial genomes finishing tool
for structural insights on draft genomes
Marco Galardini1, Emanuele G Biondi2, Marco Bazzicalupo1 and Alessio Mengoni1*

Abstract
Recent developments in sequencing technologies have given the opportunity to sequence many bacterial
genomes with limited cost and labor, compared to previous techniques. However, a limiting step of genome
sequencing is the finishing process, needed to infer the relative position of each contig and close sequencing
gaps. An additional degree of complexity is given by bacterial species harboring more than one replicon, which
are not contemplated by the currently available programs. The availability of a large number of bacterial genomes
allows geneticists to use complete genomes (possibly from the same species) as templates for contigs mapping.
Here we present CONTIGuator, a software tool for contigs mapping over a reference genome which allows the
visualization of a map of contigs, underlining loss and/or gain of genetic elements and permitting to finish
multipartite genomes. The functionality of CONTIGuator was tested using four genomes, demonstrating its
improved performances compared to currently available programs.
Our approach appears efficient, with a clear visualization, allowing the user to perform comparative structural
genomics analysis on draft genomes. CONTIGuator is a Python script for Linux environments and can be used on
normal desktop machines and can be downloaded from http://contiguator.sourceforge.net.

Background
In the recent years, the dropping cost of sequencing
technologies allowed biologist to easily widen the number of genomic sequences available for the scientific
community, especially for bacterial species; moreover,
the number of phylogenetically related genomes has also
dramatically increased: the number of genera having
more than 10 complete genomic sequences is 29 and
interestingly, looking at the 12 species with more than
10 genomes fully sequenced, all of them belongs to bacteria (GOLD database [1], November 2010), pointing
out the great value of closely related genomes in the
so-called bacterial comparative genomics. However,
looking at the ongoing or draft genomic projects, within
14 bacterial species with more than 50 running genomic
projects, a lack of finishing efforts can be seen, suggesting that the problems encountered while closing a genome (even bacterial ones) are still time-consuming and

cannot be easily automated. In fact, to close gaps of
draft genomes a series of PCR reactions has to be
designed in an iterative fashion.
To overcome this problems many programs have been
recently developed, using an approach where all the contigs obtained by the first automated assembly run are
mapped to a reference closed genome (usually inside the
same species or as close as possible) and a series of PCR
primers are designed to fill putative gaps existing between
the contigs, in an iterative fashion. These programs are
Projector2 [2], PGA4genomics [3], OSlay [4], ABACAS [5]
and other algorithms present in genome annotation tools
[6]; all of them could be used both for genomic finishing
and, simply, to infer the relative position of the contigs,
but none of them allows the user in finding divergent
regions in the reference and the new genome, which could
be helpful in performing preliminary structural analysis;
moreover, in the case of a genome composed by many
replicons, there is no automated procedure for multipartite genomic organization, avoiding to place one contig in
more than one replicon.

In order to try to solve these problems and help
genomic scientists in performing comparative structural
analyses reducing the time-consuming PCR-based finishing process, we developed CONTIGuator, a script which
combines the routines of one of mostly used tools,
ABACAS, refining the results with a contig profiling
viewable with the Artemis comparison tool (ACT) [7],
in which the putative PCR products for the subsequent
step of the finishing process are also shown.

Implementation
The CONTIGuator pipeline is detailed in Figure 1a; the
user provides a fasta file, containing all the contigs, and
one or more fasta files with the replicon(s) of the reference genome: the first step of the analysis comprises a
megablast run (the user can both have installed the new
Blast+ [8] or the old Blast implementation [9]), which
provides the contig-profiling. This step is useful for
highlighting the parts of the reference and of the contigs
that are homologous or divergent (some examples are
given in Figure 1b, c and 1d); if the targeted genome is
supposed to harbour more than one replicon, the program will ensure that each contig will be mapped only
once. The intermediate output is then used as an input
for the ABACAS perl script, one for each reference
replicon, which performs a MUMmer [10] run (nucmer,
delta-filter and show-tiling executables) and creates a

Page 2 of 5

first pseudocontig molecule. The first pseudocontig
molecule is used and corrected by CONTIGuator to
create the final pseudocontig molecule and the map.
The contigs placed across the starting point of the
molecule are splitted in order to generate a clearer map
and the position of each contig is adjusted according to
the blast output. This map will result in shorter gaps
and therefore more PCR primers will be found in the
subsequent step; as in ABACAS, the gaps between each
contig is filled with Ns. The following step comprises
the use of the Primer3 suite [11] to create a set of primers in order to fill the remaining gaps; the uniqueness
of the primers is ensured by a nucmer scan over all the
contigs given to the program. The last step is optional
and needs the presence of the reference genome ptt files
(usually available in the NCBI ftp repository) in order to
use the protein sequences from non-homologous
regions of the reference genomes for a tblastn run
against the excluded contigs; the output will help the
user to find those regions of the reference genome that
may be still present in the draft genome, although with
a lower level of homology and/or with a different
arrangement.
The outputs of the program are divided in different
directories (one for each replicon), containing the primers sequences (if the option was selected) and a series
of input files for the Artemis comparison tool (ACT):

generating a map (viewable with ACT), Primer3 provides a series of PCR primers that can be used to generate a new set of contigs, from which the
process can be iterated again; b-c-d-e) ACT visualization: the reference genome is on top, pseudocontig on bottom; b) a putative primer placement
over two near contigs; c) a section of no synteny in an otherwise fully syntenic contig; d) a region of the reference genome with no homolog in the
mapped contig; e) the same region in d) highlighted, since it harbors a tblastn hit against the excluded contigs; f-g) verification of structural clues in
ACT: the closed genome of Sinorhizobium meliloti BL225C is on top, the reference genome in the middle and the contigs on bottom.

“Reference.fsa”, containing the reference sequence,
“PseudoContig.fsa”, containing the pseudocontig
sequence, “PseudoContig.crunch”, which is the Artemis
comparison file. As soon as these files are loaded into
ACT, the user can add the “ReferenceHits.tab” and the
“PseudoContig.tab” entry file to show the blast hits on
the reference genome and the position of the contigs in
the pseudocontig molecule; if the primers were generated, the “PCRProducts.tab” entry file can be added to
the pseudocontig molecule to see the putative PCR products. Finally, if the reference genomes ptt files were
present, the user can add the “ReferenceProteinHits.tab”
entry file to show the position of the tblastn hits on the
reference genome.

Results and discussion
CONTIGuator was tested on four closed genomes for
which the first draft assembly was available: the Brucella
microti [12] genome, which comprises two replicons of
about 2 Mb and 1 Mb, respectively, whose draft assembly comprised 1539 contigs against the reference
Brucella melitensis strain ATCC 23457 [13] genome,
which also comprises two replicons of the same size; the
864 draft contigs from the Yersinia enterocolitica subsp.
palearctica Y11 [14] genome against the 4.6 Mb long
reference Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica
8081 [15] genome, the 547 draft contigs from the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis KF147 [16] genome against the
2.6 Mb long reference Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis
Il1403 [17] genome and the 158 draft contigs from the
Sinorhizobium meliloti BL225C [18] genome against the
reference S. meliloti Rm1021 genome[19] genome,
which comprises three replicons of about 3.7 Mb, 1.7
Mb and 1.4 Mb, respectively. A test run of CONTIGuator with the default parameters was performed and
compared with ABACAS, PGA4genomics, OSlay and
Projector2, as well as the primer picking for CONTIGuator, ABACAS and Projector2; the results of this test

are presented in Table 1. With respect to ABACAS,
CONTIGuator allowed the mapping of 257 kbp on average in addition to the other programs; since the pseudocontig map is corrected with the megablast output,
there is a substantial gain in the number of PCR primers
obtained (an average of 21 PCR pairs more), with
respect to PGA4genomics, CONTIGuator allowing the
mapping of 176 kbp more on average. CONTIGuator
mapped 182 kbp less than OSlay; however OSlay does
not produce a set of primers. Looking at the comparison
with Projector2, CONTIGuator allowed the mapping of
1841 kbp more than the previous software: such a dramatic difference is mainly due to a putative malfunction
of projector2 when analyzing the genome of S. meliloti
BL225C, although CONTIGuator mapped more base
pairs for the other genomes as well; however a compensation in the number of PCR primers generated by Projector2 (an average of 52 more PCR pairs) was observed,
which could be due to the fact that both ABACAS and
CONTIGuator ensure the uniqueness of the primers.
Moreover, in the B. microti and S. meliloti tests, CONTIGuator ensured that no contig was assigned to more
than one replicon, while with the other programs many
contigs were assigned to more than one replicon. The
ACT visualization, as shown in Figure 1(b, c, d, e, f, g),
allows the user to highlight which portions of the contigs and of the reference genome are divergent and syntenic, allowing a first glance in the structural features of
the new genome; in Figure 1f and 1g two examples of
ACT visualizations generated by CONTIGuator were
reported, showing experimental verification of the
assembly prediction with the full genome sequence.
Using the four complete genomes, we compared the
three programs that are able to generate PCR primers
(CONTIGuator, ABACAS, Projector2) in terms of how
many gaps the generated set of PCR primers would
putatively close (Table 1). We checked if the relative
position of the contigs on the reference genome was the

same when the contigs were mapped on the complete
genome: the gap was considered as “putatively closed”
when two contigs were mapped near each other on the
reference genome and a PCR pair was designed between
the two adjacent contigs. CONTIGuator was proven to
perform better than ABACAS, since it lead to 10 extra
putative gap closures than ABACAS; the main reason is
the higher number of PCR pairs generated (12) was able
to close more gaps. The other gaps, that ABACAS
couldn’t close, were due to a different relative placement
of the contigs on the reference genome, a placement
that in CONTIGuator was automatically corrected by
the blast-based contig profiling. In comparison with
Projector2, CONTIGuator by far closed more gaps in
Y. enteroclitica and S. meliloti, slightly less for B. microti
and less for L. lactis; it should be pointed out that the
graphical output of projector2 lacks the contig profiler
approach of CONTIGuator and therefore no detailed
structural features can be seen prior to genome finishing. Moreover, as pointed out earlier, ABACAS (and
therefore also CONTIGuator) ensures the uniqueness of
the primer pairs generated, thus putatively removing any
ambiguous reactions. An higher number of gaps closed
(putatively in this simulation) could lead to a lower
number of iterations (input contigs, CONTIGuator
annealing, PCR reactions, new set of contigs) and therefore could strongly reduce the efforts in closing one
genome. In the cases analyzed in this study, the apparent contradiction of more PCR pairs designed in the
first run of the program, may lead to less time needed
to close all the gaps in the draft genome.

Conclusions
CONTIGuator is a powerful and fast algorithm for the
bacterial genomes finishing process, providing a bigger
PCR primers set able to close more gaps, and also giving
clues on the relative position of the various contigs;
moreover, CONTIGuator contigs profiling provides a
high resolution map (viewable with the popular ACT
program), highlighting regions of the reference genomes
that are diverging from the assembled contigs. CONTIGuator indeed represents, before the end of the finishing
phase, a powerful method for the investigation of the
structural genomics based on draft genome sequences.
Availability and requirements
CONTIGuator is a Python script for Linux environments and can be downloaded from http://contiguator.
sourceforge.net, with a GNU/GPLv.3.0 license. The
Python interpreter is needed with the addition of the
BioPython package [20], as well as the Perl interpreter, a
copy of ABACAS (available here: http://abacas.sourceforge.net/), as well as Blast+, MUMmer and primer3; all
these programs must be reachable from the command

line. The Artemis comparison tool is needed to view the
output files. All the software packages were tested with
their latest version, although no malfunction was
reported with the older versions. The program performance was tested on a normal desktop machine (Linux
Ubuntu 10.04, 4CPU Intel 2.50 GHz, 4 GB RAM) with
run times in the order of a few minutes (about 6 minutes with primer picking and about 30 seconds without).
