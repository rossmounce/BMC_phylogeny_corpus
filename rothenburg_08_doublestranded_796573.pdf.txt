Abstract
Background: Double-stranded (ds) RNA, generated during viral infection, binds and activates the
mammalian anti-viral protein kinase PKR, which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor
eIF2α leading to the general inhibition of protein synthesis. Although PKR-like activity has been
described in fish cells, the responsible enzymes eluded molecular characterization until the recent
discovery of goldfish and zebrafish PKZ, which contain Z-DNA-binding domains instead of dsRNAbinding domains (dsRBDs). Fish and amphibian PKR genes have not been described so far.
Results: Here we report the cloning and identification of 13 PKR genes from 8 teleost fish and
amphibian species, including zebrafish, demonstrating the coexistence of PKR and PKZ in this latter
species. Analyses of their genomic organization revealed up to three tandemly arrayed PKR genes,
which are arranged in head-to-tail orientation. At least five duplications occurred independently in
fish and amphibian lineages. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the kinase domains of fish PKR genes
are more closely related to those of fish PKZ than to the PKR kinase domains of other vertebrate
species. The duplication leading to fish PKR and PKZ genes occurred early during teleost fish
evolution after the divergence of the tetrapod lineage. While two dsRBDs are found in mammalian
and amphibian PKR, one, two or three dsRBDs are present in fish PKR. In zebrafish, both PKR and
PKZ were strongly upregulated after immunostimulation with some tissue-specific expression
differences. Using genetic and biochemical assays we demonstrate that both zebrafish PKR and PKZ
can phosphorylate eIF2α in yeast.
Conclusion: Considering the important role for PKR in host defense against viruses, the
independent duplication and fixation of PKR genes in different lineages probably provided selective
advantages by leading to the recognition of an extended spectrum of viral nucleic acid structures,
including both dsRNA and Z-DNA/RNA, and perhaps by altering sensitivity to viral PKR inhibitors.
Further implications of our findings for the evolution of the PKR family and for studying PKR/PKZ
interactions with viral gene products and their roles in viral infections are discussed.

Background
The double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated protein kinase
PKR (eIF2aK2) is an integral component of the innate
immune response (reviewed in [1-3]). In mammals PKR,
which contains two N-terminal dsRNA-binding domains
(dsRBDs) [4], is constitutively expressed at moderate levels in most cells types and can be transcriptionally
induced approximately five-fold after immunostimulation by interferons or dsRNA. PKR is a first line defense
molecule against viral infection. Immediately after infection or early during replication or transcription of viral
genes, even before the interferon response kicks in, viral
dsRNA can activate PKR. Elevated levels of PKR after interferon induction sensitizes cells to react even more strongly
to viral pathogens leading to a general inhibition of protein synthesis and potentially to apoptosis.
PKR has been shown to be crucial for the host response
against a variety of viral pathogens. An important role for
PKR in the antiviral response is further supported by the
finding that many viruses evolved inhibitors of PKR
(reviewed in [1,3,5]). In one model for PKR activation, the
two dsRBDs found in the amino-terminal part of mammalian and avian PKR are thought to fold back onto the
kinase domain thereby inhibiting dimerization and
kinase activity [6]. Upon binding of dsRNA, this autoinhibition is relieved facilitating the dimerization of two PKR
molecules. This dimerization is mediated by both the Nterminal dsRBDs as well as by residues of the kinase
domain and is a prerequisite for the activation of PKR
which is accompanied by the trans-autophosphorylation
of many serine and threonine residues [7-11].
The best-characterized substrate of PKR is the α subunit of
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which is
phosphorylated at Ser51. Phosphorylation of eIF2α is one
of the best-understood mechanisms enabling cells to rapidly alter protein production in response to environmental stimuli (reviewed in [12]). eIF2 consists of three
subunits, α, β and γ. When bound to GTP, eIF2 forms a
ternary complex with initiator methionyl-tRNA, which is
essential for cap-dependent translation initiation. Binding
of this complex to the 40S ribosomal subunit generates a
43S preinitiation complex that binds mRNA and scans to
identify a start codon. Following base-pairing of the anticodon of the tRNA to an initiation codon, scanning is
halted, and the 60S subunit joins. This coincides with the
hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP and dissociation of eIF2.
In order to allow a new round of translation initiation, the
GDP bound to eIF2 must be exchanged for GTP by the
guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Phosphorylation of the eIF2α on Ser51 converts eIF2 into a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, resulting in decreased levels of
GTP-bound eIF2 and leading to the general inhibition of
translational initiation [13,14]. However, a small subset

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

of mRNAs is translated more efficiently after eIF2α phosphorylation. The mRNAs encoding the transcription factors GCN4 in yeast (reviewed in [15]) and ATF4 in
vertebrates [16] contain short upstream open reading
frames (uORFs), which inhibit the efficient translation of
the genuine ORFs when the ternary complex is abundant
[16]. When the levels of ternary complex are reduced after
eIF2α phosphorylation the genuine ORFs are translated
more efficiently.
A family of protein kinases has been identified that mediate translational regulation through phosphorylation of
eIF2α. These kinases all share phylogenetically closely
related kinase domains that are linked to unique regulatory domains that determine the mode of kinase activation (reviewed in [17]). In addition to PKR, four other
eIF2α kinases have been identified in vertebrates: the
heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI/eIF2aK1) is activated under conditions of heme deprivation and arsenite
exposure, the PKR-like endoplasmatic reticulum kinase
(PERK/PEK/eIF2aK3) is activated by unfolded proteins in
the ER, and GCN2 (eIF2ak4) is activated by uncharged
tRNA and thus senses amino acid starvation.
The fifth and most recently discovered member of the
eIF2α kinase family is PKZ, which was cloned from goldfish, zebrafish and Atlantic salmon [18-20]. The kinase
domain of PKZ is most closely related to PKR, however it
contains two Z-DNA binding domains, called Zα
domains, in the N-terminus instead of dsRBDs, as found
in PKR [18,19]. The Z-conformation is an alternative
higher-energy form that can be adopted by doublestranded nucleic acids. In Z-DNA and Z-RNA the
(deoxy)ribose backbone forms a left-handed zigzag helix,
as opposed to the smooth right-handed helix in B-DNA
and A-RNA [21,22]. In cells, formation of Z-DNA is
induced by negative supercoiling, generated by moving
RNA-polymerases during transcription, and can modulate
promoter activity probably by alternating the local architecture of promoter regions and nucleosome positioning
[23,24].
Zα domains specifically bind, stabilize and induce Z-DNA
and Z-RNA [22,25,26]. They adopt a helix turn helix conformation [27,28] that is structurally unrelated to the α-ββ-β-α fold adopted by dsRBDs [29]. Until now, Zα
domains have only been identified in three cellular Zform binding proteins (ZBPs): the RNA-editing enzyme
ADAR1 (reviewed in [1]), which also contains three
dsRBDs, Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1/DLM1) [30]
and PKZ. In all three proteins two Zα domains are found
at the amino-terminus and are separated by a linker that
varies in size between 16 and 91 amino acids [19]. In
addition, expression of these cellular ZBPs are highly
induced upon immunostimulation, and the Zα domains

determine the subcellular localization of the proteins
[26,31,32].
Interestingly, the poxvirus protein E3L, one of the best
studied PKR inhibitors, contains both a Zα domain and a
dsRBD [33], combining the two nucleic acid binding
domains found in PKZ and PKR. Both domains in E3L
have been found to be essential for Vaccinia virus pathogenesis in a mouse model [34]. The importance of Z-form
binding is further indicated by the finding that single
point mutations in the Zα-domain that prevented Z-DNA
binding greatly reduced virus pathogenicity. Remarkably,
pathogenicity was fully restored by substitution of the Zα
domain of E3L with that of ADAR1 or ZBP1 despite a low
sequence identity of about 25% (see [35]).
When transfected into mammalian cells, PKZ inhibited
reporter gene expression to comparable levels as previously observed for PKR [19]. However, an important difference is that a kinase inactivating point mutation in PKR
(K296R) had stimulating effects on reporter protein
expression (two- to six-fold) [36,37], while kinase inactivated PKZ (K199R) had neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects [19]. These findings indicate that endogenous
PKR, which is probably activated in every transfection, can
be inhibited in a dominant negative fashion only by inactive forms of PKR but not by PKZ. Moreover, these results
suggest that dsRBDs and Zα domains have different binding partners or activators. Identification of PKZ, a PKR
homolog in fish possessing different nucleic acid binding
domains, is striking and may reflect adaptation to the different viruses challenging these species.
Hitherto PKR has only been identified in mammals and
chickens. However, similar activity has also been
described in fish cells but the enzymes responsible eluded
molecular cloning for a long time [38,39]. The identification and characterization of genes that are important in
the immune response in poikilotherm vertebrates is of
considerable interest because their pathogens have seriously decimated both wild-type and farm-raised populations leading to significant ecological and economical
losses [40]. In this report, we characterize PKR genes of
fish and amphibians, demonstrating the coexistence of
PKR and PKZ in at least one fish species, and we identify
lineage-specific duplications of PKR genes. Our findings
support the notion that PKR and PKZ play similar but not
identical roles in host defense and open the door to investigate the role of PKR in the innate immune response of
poikilotherms and in the interplay with pathogens.

Cloning of three PKR genes from Tetraodon nigroviridis
The sequences of two partial PKR genes representing parts
of the kinase domains from the freshwater pufferfish T.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

nigroviridis have been reported [41]. Since these sequences
are incomplete and lack 5' and 3' regions it was not clear
whether these genes contain dsRBDs, Z-DNA binding
domains (Zα domains) or other regulatory domains.
Because the draft T. nigroviridis genome sequence was not
of high enough quality for reliable gene prediction, we
performed 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE) experiments in order to obtain the complete gene
sequences. Since both PKR and PKZ genes are inducible
by immunostimulation, we treated a T. nigroviridis fish
with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) for 12 h
to induce expression. Different freshwater pufferfish species often look similar and reliable discrimination
between these species can only be achieved by molecular
techniques [42]. To confirm the species of our pufferfish,
a 306 bp fragment from the cytochrome B (cytb) gene was
cloned and sequenced. The obtained sequence was 100%
identical to 12 T. nigroviridis cytb gene sequences deposited in the database (e.g. accession number AJ248568).
The closest related sequences were from T. fluviatilis, displaying 97% identity. These results demonstrate that our
pufferfish belongs to the species T. nigroviridis. We
designed primers from the available PKR1 and PKR2
sequences and performed 5' and 3' RACE polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). For 5' RACE PCR of PKR1 and
PKR2, 800 and 700 bp bands were observed, respectively
(Figure 1A). The longest fragment obtained for PKR1 contained 872 bp with the first ATG at position +60 (relative
to the presumptive transcription start site). An in-frame
stop codon at position +55 preceded this AUG codon,
which initiated an ORF that extended through the entire
sequence. The 5' RACE for PKR2 yielded a 710 bp fragment with a start codon at position +29, that was preceded by an in-frame stop codon at position +18. The two
lower molecular weight bands represent non-specific PCR
products.
Different primers were used for 3' RACE PCR of PKR1,
which all yielded a single major band that was amplified
to different extents (Figure 1B, lanes 1–4). For PKR2, two
major bands were amplified (Figure 1B, lanes 5–7). Cloning of the PCR products showed that they all contained
poly-A tails. The two fragments obtained with PKR2-specific primers displayed 87% identity in their deduced coding sequences. Since these two sequences represent two
closely related PKR genes, we are referring to them as
PKR2 and PKR3 in the following paragraphs.
Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR covering the complete
ORF using primers derived from the sequences obtained
from 5'- and 3'-RACE PCR, showed products of about 2.1
kb for PKR1 and about 1.2 kb for PKR2 and PKR3 (Figure
1C). Cloning and sequencing of the fragments showed
that PKR1 contains an ORF of 2001 bp. Three dsRBDs

for 5' RACE PCRs with T. nigroviridis cDNA are shown for
primers specific for PKR1 (lane 1) and PKR2 (lane 2). M

shows the results of 3' RACE PCR using four different forward primers used in primary and nested PCRs for PKR1
(lanes 1–4) and three different forward primers combinations
for PKR2 and PKR3 (lanes 5–7). The smaller fragment represents PKR2 and the larger one represents PKR3. (C) PCR
products are shown using primers covering the complete
open reading frames of PKR1 (lane 1), PKR2 (lane 2) and
PKR3 (lane 3). (D) PCR reactions of overlapping regions
were performed with genomic DNA to elucidate the
genomic organization of PKR1. Lanes 1 and 2 show the PCR
products obtained with primers spanning the region between
the 5' untranslated region of PKR1 and exon 15 and exon 14
and the 3' untranslated region of exon 19, respectively. PCR
product shown in lane 3 was obtained with primers covering
exon 17 of PKR1 and exon 7 of PKR2. PCR products were
cloned and completely sequenced.

(dsRB1-3) were identified in the N-terminal region using
the conserved domain database [43] (Figure 2C). While
dsRBD1 and dsRBD3 showed highly significant expected
values (E-value) of 3 × 10-13 and 1 × 10-11, respectively, the
E-value for dsRBD2 was only 0.013. PKR2 and PKR3 contain 1272 and 1296 bp ORFs, respectively. Since only a
single cDNA species was cloned for the 5' RACE of PKR2,
the same forward primer originating from the 5' RACE of
PKR2 was used for PKR2 and PKR3. The weaker band
intensity of PKR3 is probably not a result of lower expression, as amplification worked comparably well for PKR2
and PKR3 in the 3' RACE, but reflects that the primer used
has two mismatches to PKR3 in the middle of the primer
and amplification was thus probably less efficient. Only
one complete dsRBD was identified in PKR2 (E-value = 2
× 10-14), while only a partial dsRBD, which contains only

(Figures 2D and 2E). TnPKR2 dsRBD is most closely
related to TnPKR1 dsRBD1 (80% amino acid identity),
followed by dsRBD3 (40% identity) and dsRBD2 (28%
identity). Amino acid identity in the kinase domain of
PKR1 with PKR2 and PKR3 is 49% and 49.4 %, respectively, while that of PKR2 and PKR3 is 88.5%. A muliple

Cloning and expression analysis of a zebrafish PKR gene
We searched the genomic zebrafish (Danio rerio) database
(see Methods) with the amino acid sequence of TnPKR1
in order to identify a PKR gene using protein query versus
translated database (tblastn). We identified sequences
with apparent homology to the 5' and 3' regions of
TnPKR1 that were present in two different contigs. To
determine whether the identified regions belong to a single gene, we designed primers from the predicted 5' and 3'

untranslated regions, performed RT-PCR and successfully
amplified fragments of about 2.1 kb from various organs
(Figure 3, upper panel). Cloning of these fragments
revealed an ORF of 2046 bp. Like TnPKR1, DrPKR contains three dsRBD (Figure 2G). Two major alleles, PKRa
and PKRb, varying at four amino acid positions (V91I;
P172Q; L355S; M615V) were identified.
In order to analyze whether drPKR displays a similar
expression profile to the previously identified PKR relative
PKZ and to investigate whether it is also inducible by
poly(I:C), we performed RT-PCR with previously prepared RNA from different organs of zebrafish that were
either treated with poly(I:C) or mock-treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 12 h [19]. Primers were
used that cover the complete ORFs of PKR and PKZ. The
housekeeping gene RACK1 was used as a control. As
observed for PKZ, PKR was expressed at low to moderate
levels in most untreated tissues expect for brain, where a
strong signal was observed (Figure 3). In the poly(I:C)
treated animals, PKR was highly induced in heart, muscle,
skin, digestive organs, liver and spleen. In these organs
PKR showed comparable induction to PKZ. No or only
moderate induction of PKR was observed in the eye, brain
and gonads. The most striking expression differences
between PKR and PKZ were observed in the gonads, where
PKR is almost absent and PKZ is moderately expressed but
not induced, and in the brain, where PKR appears to be

eye

expressed at higher basal levels. The different bands
observed for PKZ are a result of previously described different splice products [19]. The occurrence of gene
sequences in the database for expressed sequence tags
(dbEST) can be used to roughly estimate the abundance of
transcripts. Currently, seven D. rerio PKZ EST clones were
found in the dbEST database, while none was identified
for PKR.
Identification of PKR genes from other fish species
Using the cloned fish PKR genes as probes, we used
tblastn to search dbEST and genomic databases in order to
identify more PKR genes. We identified two PKR genes in
the genome of the fugu fish (Takifugu rubripes). They are
present in scaffold 459 and are separated by approximately 3 kb. Owing to the relatively high sequence conservation in the kinase domains, we were able to identify
these with a high level of confidence. On the amino acid
level, the kinase domains of TnPKR1 and TnPKR2 are
around 71% and 66%, identical to those of TrPKR1 and
TrPKR2, respectively. We identified two putative dsRBDs,
each encoded by two exons, in the 5' region of each T.
rubripes PKR gene. Owing to the poorer sequence conservation outside the kinase domain, and the lack of expression analysis and ESTs, we could not reliably determine
the exact structure of these genes.

We identified nine overlapping, high-quality EST
sequences covering the complete 497 amino acids predicted ORF of a single PKR gene from the three-spined
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Two predicted dsRBDs
are present in the N-terminus (Figure 2F). The segment
linking the 3' end of dsRBD2 and the 5' end of the kinase
domain is remarkably small comprising only 29 amino
acids. The complete gene was also identified in the G.
aculeatus draft genome sequence on contig 5174. The
kinase domain of a second PKR gene, whose expression is
not supported by ESTs, was identified approximately 12
kb upstream of GaPKR1.

these additional PKR genes. The three X. tropicalis PKR
genes are tandemly arranged in head-to-tail (parallel) orientation on the same contig, in the order of PKR3, PKR2
and PKR1, with respect to 5' to 3' orientation of the genes,
and are separated by approximately 10 and 6.5 kb, respectively (Figure 4). Sequences coding for putative dsRBDs
were also identified 5' to the kinase domains of XtPKR2
and XtPKR3 and are partly represented in one EST for each
gene. Owing to gaps in the genomic sequence and a high
level of sequence variability outside the kinase domains,
the determination of the exact gene organization was not
possible.

Searching the genome of the Japanese medaka (Oryzias
latipes), we identified one PKR gene in the contig
BAAF02021246. As for the TrPKR genes, we were able to
identify the kinase domain with a high level of confidence
but could not precisely define the rest of the gene or the
exact borders of the exons encoding two putative dsRBD
present in the 5' region.

In an attempt to reconstruct the phylogeny of the PKR
gene family, we aimed to identify mammalian PKR
sequences in addition to those already deposited in GenBank. Owing to the relatively high conservation of
sequences and exon-intron boundaries in the PKR genes
within the primate family, we successfully identified the
PKR gene of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta (Mam))
using tblastn searches of the draft M. mulatta genome
sequence. The coding exons of MamPKR were found in
seven contigs that ranged in size between 1 and 50 kb. The
obtained sequence is identical to the recently released
MamPKR sequence (accession number NP_001077417),
except for an Asn to Arg substitution at position 384,
which most likely represent different alleles. The sequence
identity of MamPKR is highest when compared with African green monkey (92%), human (80%) and chimpanzee
(80%).

The kinase domain of the fathead minnow (Pimephales
promelas) was reconstructed from four overlapping EST
sequences and five EST sequences were identified that
probably encode for two PKR dsRBDs. However, as the
two constructed contigs did not overlap, it is presently
unknown whether the dsRBDs and the kinase domain
sequences belong to the same gene.
Cloning and identification of PKR genes from additional
vertebrates
We screened dbEST for PKR genes from additional organisms. ESTs from the putative 5' and 3' end of a Xenopus laevis PKR gene were identified. We designed primers from
the predicted untranslated regions of this gene, performed
RT-PCR and cloned and sequenced XlPKR1 (not shown).
The predicted 1737 bp ORF encodes for a 65 kD PKR
ortholog, which contains two dsRBDs (Figure 2B). Eleven
ESTs were identified for XlPKR1. Two additional X. laevis
ESTs, representing parts of the kinase domain and showing 65–80% identity on the protein level compared with
XlPKR1, were identified using tblastn. These ESTs probably represent a second PKR gene from this species.

The putative PKR sequences of the monotreme Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus) and the marsupial Monodelphis domestica (gray short-tailed opossum), which were

Using XlPKR1 as a probe, we searched for PKR ESTs from

Since these ESTs are overlapping and span the complete
predicted ORF, we were able to 'in silico' clone this gene,
termed XtPKR1. Like XlPKR1, XtPKR1 contains two
dsRBDs and displays 73% amino acid identity with the
former. In addition, we identified eight ESTs from two
closely related genes, which we named XtPKR2 and
XtPKR3. Combining the sequences of these ESTs and the
information from the draft genome of X. tropicalis, we
were able to identify the complete kinase domains of

predicted using automatic gene prediction approaches,
are found in the Ensembl database [44]. Three alternative
and likely mutually exclusive predicted transcripts are
deposited for the PKR gene of each species. Careful examination of the suggested transcripts and multiple alignments with other PKR sequences indicate that
ENSMODT00000030492 (for M. domestica) and
ENSOANT00000006231 (for O. anatinus) contain the
correct kinase domains that we used for further phylogenetic analyses.
Fish PKR genes are more closely related to fish PKZ than
to PKR genes of other vertebrates
We have previously shown that the kinase domain of fish
PKZ is more closely related to that of mammalian and
chicken PKR than to the other eIF2α kinases [19]. In order
to determine the phylogenetic relationship within the
extended PKR/PKZ family we performed phylogenetic
analyses with the sequences of the kinase domains, as
described in Methods. Kinase domains of human and
zebrafish PERK, which is the closest relative of PKR/PKZ
[19], were used as outgroups for rooting the phylogenetic
trees. These outgroups confirmed the stability of the
topology of the trees. A comparable topology of the PKR/
PKZ clade was obtained when the other two eIF2α kinases
GCN2 and HRI were included in our phylogenetic analyses (data not shown). Both phylogenetic analyses resulted
in the same tree topology (Figure 5). Significant bootstrap
values above 70 (for maximum likelihood analysis) and
significant posterior probabilities converted to percentages above 95 (for Bayesian analysis) are shown above
and below the branches, respectively.

Two major clades were recovered with high statistical support (Figure 5). While in one clade the fish PKR genes
were nested with the PKZ genes, the other clade contained
the PKR genes of all other vertebrates. This demonstrates
that the fish PKR genes are more closely related to PKZ
than to PKR of the other vertebrates. The pufferfish
TnPKR1 and TrPKR1 sequences are nested with one
another as well as TrPKR2 with TnPKR2 and TnPKR3.
Within the fish PKR/PKZ clade, the occurrence of three
independent duplication events is evident (marked with
asterisks in Figure 5), the first of which resulted in the split
into PKZ and PKR genes. The other major clade approximately recapitulates vertebrate evolution, with the Xenopus sp. sequences branching off in a basal node. A close
kinship of the three X. tropicalis PKR genes is observed
which probably reflects two gene duplication events
(marked with asterisks in Figure 5). Chicken (Gg) PKR
branches off before the mammalian PKR genes. Within
the mammalian clade, platypus and opossum PKR genes
are basal to the PKR genes of the placental mammals. It is
important to point out that PKR genes of fish, for example
the three PKR genes of T. nigroviridis, and amphibians, for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

example the three PKR genes of X. tropicalis, while sharing
a common ancestor, arose from independent gene duplications and should therefore be viewed as paralogs, not
orthologs.
Lineage-specific amino acid substitution in the kinase
domains of PKR and PKZ
Multiple sequence alignment of the kinase domains of
PKR and PKZ genes (Figure 6; numbering of amino acid
position is shown relative to human PKR), in combination with the phylogenetic tree, reveal a number of lineage-specific amino acid substitutions that are not found in
genes of other lineages (highlighted in red in Figure 6).
Some examples are mentioned hereafter. Residues specific
for the Tetrapoda lineage are Gly329 and Glu468, the latter of which replaced a Lys that is found in fish PKR and
PKZ as well as in PERK. Mammalia-specific residues are
Leu390, Val423, Leu439 and Cys485. Eutheria-specific
residues are Tyr300 and Ala479. Leu386, Val484, Asp486
and Ile503 are specific for primates. Residues found specifically in PKZ genes are Pro328, Arg386, Glu467 and
Thr469. A three amino acid deletion between residues 510
and 511 is specific for the eutheria lineage.

A highly acidic kinase insert (KI) linking kinase subdomains IV and V is specific for eIF2α kinases and is
highly divergent in length. A striking difference in the
length of the KI is observed between PKZ and PKR
sequences, which ranges from 14–34 residues for PKR and
66–80 residues for PKZ (see Additional file 2). This insert
contains a high proportion of Ser/Thr residues that are targets for autophosphorylation. Taken together, the four
amino acids Asp, Glu, Ser and Thr account for an average
of 56.1% and 54.7% of all residues of the KI of PKR and
PKZ, respectively.
Convergent evolution of PKR/PKZ genes at multiple sites
Evidence for the convergent evolution of PKR genes, if the
multiple sequence alignment (Figure 6) and the phylogenetic tree (Figure 5) are taken into account, is found at
multiple positions. Examples where the same amino acid
substitution apparently evolved independently (highlighted in blue in Figure 6), include position 261 (independent lysine, alanine, glutamate or serine
substitutions), position 290 (independent glycine, lysine,
asparagine, aspartate or glutamate substitutions), position 314 (independent lysine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate or threonine substitutions), position 400 (four
independent lysine substitutions), position 449 (independent lysine, arginine, isoleucine and threonine substitutions), position 493 (independent lysine, glutamate or
glutamine substitutions) and position 524 (independent
glutamate, lysine or alanine substitutions). Of note is also
the independent emergence of a tyrosine at position 363
in the fish PKR lineage and in XtPKR2 and OaPKR because

Multiple sequence alignment of the kinase domains of PKR and PKZ genes from various species. Multiple
sequence alignment of the kinase domains PKR and PKZ from the indicated species (abbreviations are explained in Figure 5 legend) was performed using MUSCLE [64]. Secondary structure elements as reported for human PKR [10] as well as numbering
of residues relative to human PKR are shown above the sequences. Residues involved in PKR inter-dimer contacts (pluses) and
eIF2α recognition (asterisks) are marked above the sequences. Residues or deletions that show evidence for convergent evolution (blue) or are lineage specific (red) are colored. The backgrounds of residues that are highly conserved are colored as follows: 100% conservation, dark green; 90–99% conservation, light green; 80–89% conservation, yellow; conservation of
functionally conserved residues, salmon pink.

it affects the sequence of the LFIQMEF motif that has been
identified as important for eIF2α kinase activity [45].
Only a few residues involved in PKR dimer contact or
substrate recognition are highly conserved
Dimerization of eIF2α kinases that is partly mediated by
residues in the kinase domain (dimer contacts as observed
in the crystal structure are marked with plus signs (+) in
Figure 6) is essential for kinase activity [10]. A salt bridge
formed between Arg262 on one protomer and Asp266 on
the other is important for dimerization of hsPKR [46].
While residues making this salt bridge are present in all
but platypus (Oa) mammalian PKR genes, a predicted
functional salt bridge is only found in 7 out of 17 nonmammalian PKR/PKZ genes. Another important contact
as revealed by site directed mutagenesis is made with residues Asp289 and Tyr293 on one protomer with Tyr323
on the other protomer forming an H-bond triad. While
Tyr323 is conserved in all PKR/PKZ genes, a tyrosine is
found at position 293 in 27 out of 31 genes and an acidic
residue at position 289 in 22 out of 31 sequences. Of the
other contacts, only Val309 is highly conserved.

Residues that contact the substrate eIF2α are marked with
asterisks (Figure 6). Of these only Thr(Ser)451,
Thr(Ser)487 and Glu490 are highly conserved.
Similar genomic organization of PKR and PKZ genes
Owing to large gaps or large stretches of unknown
sequences, the draft T. nigroviridis genome sequence was
of limited help in the cloning process and in determining
the genomic organization of T. nigroviridis PKR genes. Partial sequences of PKR1 and PKR2 were identified in the
same contig in the genomic sequence, indicating close
proximity of these genes. However, the last 189 nucleotides of the 3' coding sequence of PKR1 were missing in
the draft genome as well as the first part of the 5' coding
region of PKR2. In order to better understand the genomic
organization of the PKR genes, we performed PCR from
genomic DNA. We were successful in amplifying three
overlapping fragments covering the complete PKR1 gene,
the intergenic region between PKR1 and PKR2 and the
first half of PKR2 (Figure 1D). This 8.3 kb region was completely sequenced. PKR1 consists of 19 exons covering
approximately 5 kb (Figure 7). The overall genomic
organization is remarkably similar to that of human PKR
[47]. Each dsRBD is encoded by two exons. The kinase
domain is encoded by seven exons. The shortest exon
(exon 10) of tnPKR1 is only 26 bp long. The transcription
start site of TnPKR2 was identified only 1.1 kb 3' of exon
19 of TnPKR1 (Figure 4). In the current release of the T.
nigroviridis genome, the tnPKR genes were found on chromosome
17
contig
(TETRAODON7:17:1829792:5098209). The 3' terminal
exons of PKR1 and 5' terminal exons of PKR2 as well as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

middle exons of PKR3 were still missing in this contig. In
this contig we identified the transcription start site of
TnPKR3 to be approximately 6.6 kb downstream of the
last exon of PKR2. Thus, the three TnPKR genes are tandemly arranged in a head-to-tail orientation (Figure 4).
In order to determine the genomic organization of
zebrafish PKR, we searched the zebrafish genome at the
Ensembl website [44] with the cloned DrPKR cDNA
sequence. The first (5' region) 1409 bp of the ORF were
detected in scaffold2654.7 (annotated chromosome: 18),
while the 3' region was found in scaffold1952 (annotated
chromosome: 18). The complete PKR ORF could be identified in these contigs. The genomic organization of
DrPKR is very similar to that of tnPKR1. Both are composed of 19 exons. In both genes dsRBD2 and dsRBD3 are
linked by one exon, while dsRBD3 and the kinase domain
are linked by five exons.
Exons 1–14 were identified on scaffold2654.7 and exons
15–19 in scaffold1952. Long dinucleotide repeats are
present 5' to exon 14 and 3' to exon 15 that might have
mixed up the annotation process. Adjacent to them are
stretches of 951 bp that show 99% sequence identity.
Thus, it is likely that both contigs represent the same chromosomal location. We tried in vain to amplify the segment linking exons 14 and 15 by long-range PCR from
genomic DNA using various parameters including different primers, annealing temperatures and polymerases.
Remarkably, PKZ was identified around 8 kb 3' to DrPKR
in scaffold1952 in a head-to-tail orientation (Figure 4).
The genomic organization of PKZ based on the sequence
in scaffold1952 is shown in Figure 7. The organization of
the kinase domains is remarkably similar to that of the
PKR genes with exception that the kinase insert in PKZ is
encoded by four exons (exons 4 to 7) instead of two as in
the PKR genes. The kinase domain in all PKR and PKZ
genes is encoded by seven exons, two exons 5' of the
kinase insert and five exons 3' to it. Moreover the first,
fifth and sixth exon of the kinase domain in zebrafish PKR
and PKZ have exactly the same length of 120, 102 and 63
bp, respectively.
The most striking difference is that both Z-DNA binding
domains of PKZ are composed of a single exon as compared with PKR where each dsRBD is encoded by two
exons. There are some discrepancies between the genomic
organization of PKZ as depicted in Figure 7 and the version published earlier, which was based on PCRs from
genomic DNA, partial sequencing and the genomic
sequences available at the time [19]. These discrepancies
could be explained by contamination of the PCRs with
cloned plasmid PKZ and by errors in earlier draft genomic
sequences. However, the most important features, includ-

ing a single exon encoding the two Zα domains, the
boundaries of the exons 5 and 6, which are spliced out in
one splice variant, and the length and position of a
retained intron in other splice variants are concordant.
G. aculeatus PKR1 is organized in a similar manner to the
other PKR genes. As in hsPKR, the two dsRBDs are not separated by an additional exon. Interestingly, the small
linker between dsRBD2 and the kinase domain is encoded
by a single exon, as in drPKZ, and as opposed to five exons
in TnPKR1 and DrPKR.
Both zebrafish PKR and PKZ phosphorylate yeast eIF2α
The budding yeast S. cerevisiae has been used to characterize vertebrate eIF2α kinases [48]. To test whether
zebrafish PKR and PKZ can phosphorylate yeast eIF2α, we

sub-cloned these genes into a yeast expression vector containing a galactose inducible promoter. The resulting PKR
and PKZ plasmids were introduced into isogenic yeast
strains lacking the only endogenous S. cerevisiae eIF2α
kinase GCN2, expressing either wild-type eIF2α (H2557)
or non-phosphorylatable eIF2α-S51A (J223). Strains
transformed with empty vector and a human PKR expression construct were used as negative and positive controls,
respectively. All transformants grew well under noninducing conditions on glucose medium (Figure 8A, left).
When expression was induced on galactose medium,
HsPKR, the two DrPKR variants and DrPKZ exhibited
strong cytotoxicity in the strain carrying wild-type eIF2α
(Figure 8A, upper right). This cytotoxicity was blocked in
the eIF2α-S51A mutant strain, indicating that both

Both zebrafish PKR and PKZ phosphorylate yeast eIF2α. (A) Plasmids expressing full-length human (hs) PKR or
zebrafish (dr) PKZ or two different alleles of PKR, under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter, were introduced into
S. cerevisiae strains H2557 (wild-type eIF2α, upper plates) and J223 (eIF2α-S51A, lower plates) as indicated. After two rounds
of single colony purification, the transformants were streaked out simultaneously on SD-ura (non-inducing conditions, left) or
SGal-ura (inducing conditions, right) medium and grown for three days (SD-ura) or four days (SGal-ura). (B) Western blot
analyses of extracts from strain H2557 transformed with vector, HsPKR, DrPKR or DrPKZ. SDS-PAGE was used to separate
4 μg of WCEs which were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Tagged PKR and PKZ were detected using anti-Flag-tag
antibody (upper panel). eIF2α phosphorylated on Ser51 and total eIF2α are shown in middle and bottom panels, respectively.

zebrafish PKR isoforms and PKZ can phosphorylate yeast
eIF2α.
To examine eIF2α phosphorylation in yeast directly,
whole-cell extracts (WCEs) of strain H2557 transformed
with the expression plasmids for HsPKR, DrPKRa and
DrPKZ were prepared. Following 12 h induction on galactose medium, Western blot analyses using an eIF2α 51phospho-specific antibody confirmed that these kinases
phosphorylated eIF2α on Ser51 (Figure 8B, middle
panel). No eIF2α phosphorylation was observed in cells
transformed with the empty vector. The eIF2α 51-phospho-specific antibody used does not react with eIF2αS51A in the J223 strain [49].
Western blot analyses with anti-yeast eIF2α antibodies
revealed comparable levels of eIF2α (Figure 8B, lower
panel). Expression of PKR and PKZ, monitored with antiFlag tag antibody (Figure 8B, upper panel), indicated that
the kinases were expressed at comparable levels and had
the expected molecular masses (65.4 kD for HsPKR, 80.5
kD for DrPKR and 61.7 kD for DrPKZ). These data confirm that drPKR and drPKZ are eIF2α Ser51 kinases.

Discussion
Although PKR-like activity had been observed in fish cells,
the responsible genes eluded molecular cloning for a long
time. The identification of goldfish and zebrafish eIF2α
kinases (PKZ), which are most closely related to PKR, was
surprising because they contain two Zα domains in the Nterminus instead of dsRBDs as found in PKR [18,19]. This
raised the question of whether the Zα domains actually
replaced the dsRBDs in fish or if species can be identified
in which PKR and PKZ actually coexist.
We have now shown that fish and two amphibian species
actually possess PKR genes. Interestingly, phylogenetic
analyses of PKR and PKZ genes revealed that fish PKR
genes are more closely related to fish PKZ than to PKR of
the other vertebrates. This indicates that a duplication of
an ancestral eIF2α kinase occurred in the fish lineage after
divergence of the tetrapod lineage approximately 450 millions years ago [50] and led to the emergence of both fish
PKR and PKZ. It is most likely that this kinase was an
ancestral PKR gene that presumably contained two
dsRBDs. The most likely scenario is that the dsRBDs of
one duplicated copy were replaced by Zα domains. Since

Page 12 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:12

both Zα domains in PKZ are encoded by a single exon, it
suggests that they might have been acquired from another
cellular ZBP. So far PKZ has been only identified in fish
species of the orders Cypriniformes and Salmoniformes.
We could not identify it in other fish species. At present it
is not clear whether PKZ is present in fish species of other
orders. It might have been lost during evolution in some
species or just evolved in a common ancestor of Cypriniformes and Salmoniformes.
In addition to the early duplication leading to fish PKZ
and PKR genes, four independent duplication events are
evident. Two of these duplications can be observed in T.
nigroviridis: first, an early duplication that gave rise to
TnPKR1 and an ancestral PKR gene and, second, duplication of the latter gene led to the emergence of TnPKR2 and
TnPKR3 relatively late in the evolution of this species. The
other two duplications apparently occurred sometime
during amphibian evolution and can be observed for X.
tropicalis. Since all of the lineage-specific duplications
resulted in tandemly repeated genes that are located
within 1 to 10 kb, they most likely resulted from independent tandem duplication events. This is noteworthy,
because a whole genome duplication occurred early during fish evolution [50,51], which is apparently not the
mechanism for the origin of the duplicated PKR genes.
The observation that all tandemly duplicated PKR/PKZ
genes are arranged in a head-to-tail orientation is consistent with reports obtained for mammals, where the majority of tandemly arrayed genes (68–76%) were found in
this orientation [52]. The presence of the duplicated genes
in the same chromosomal neighborhood might be important for similar transcriptional activation after immunostimulation. This notion is supported by the comparable
strong induction of zebrafish PKR and PKZ after poly(I:C)
stimulation in six out of nine investigated tissues. However, high constitutive PKR expression in brain and
absence of PKR expression in gonads, where PKZ is constitutively expressed at moderate levels but not induced
upon stimulation, appear to be important differences.
Such expression differences might have been important in
the fixation of these duplications. In addition, given the
important role for PKR in host defense, the duplicated
PKR genes probably provided a selective advantage by
leading to the recognition of an extended spectrum of
viral nucleic acid structures, including both dsRNA and ZDNA/RNA, and maybe by altering sensitivity to viral PKR
inhibitors. Fixation of these duplications indicates that
they provided selective advantages.
A strikingly high number of sites at which convergent evolution is evident are found within the PKR/PKZ family. At
these sites, the same amino acid substitution evolved
independently. At many of these sites, non-conservative
amino acid substitutions can be observed. An explanation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

for the observed convergent evolution and the high divergence at multiple sites is that viral inhibitors of PKR and
PKZ might exert strong selective pressure on these genes.
A growing number of viral PKR inhibitors have been identified [1,5]. While some of these appear to directly interfere with dsRNA-mediated PKR activation, others target
the PKR domain directly. Among the best-characterized
PKR antagonists are the Vaccinia virus proteins E3L and
K3L, orthologs of which are found in many poxviruses.
E3L and K3L are important virulence factors and are
involved in determining host range [53]. E3L probably
inhibits PKR activation by preventing its activation by
dsRNA and forming inactive heterodimers with PKR
[54,55]. In addition, E3L has been reported to bind to the
PKR kinase domain directly [55,56]. K3L shares homology with the N-terminus of the PKR substrate eIF2α and
acts as a pseudosubstrate [57]. Iridoviruses, which are
important pathogens of lower vertebrates including fish
and amphibians, possess different eIF2α-related proteins
called vIF2α. The 90 N-terminal residues of vIF2α display
homology to the N-terminus of eIF2α, while the C-terminus of vIF2α, which is comprised of 140–150 residues, is
unique and does not share any detectable homology with
other proteins [58]. It has been suggested that vIF2α acts
similarly to K3L to inhibit PKR-related proteins in the
infected species [58,59]. The molecular characterization
of amphibian PKR and fish PKR and PKZ genes paves the
way for the study of viral antagonists of these kinases.
We have previously shown that zebrafish PKZ inhibits
protein expression when transfected into mammalian
cells [19]. In this study, we used the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as another heterologous system to study the functionality of both PKZ and two PKR alleles from zebrafish.
This system has been used previously to study other eIF2α
kinases including human PKR [48]. Similar to human
PKR, both zebrafish PKR alleles and PKZ were highly toxic
when expressed in yeast. This cytotoxicity was inhibited in
a yeast strain expressing the non-phosphorylatable eIF2αS51A mutant. Furthermore, expression of human PKR
and zebrafish PKR and PKZ resulted in comparable levels
of eIF2α phosphorylation. These findings formally demonstrate for the first time that zebrafish PKR and PKZ are
eIF2α kinases, and they underscore the usefulness of this
system to further characterize these kinases and their viral
inhibitors.
Dimerization of PKR, which is partly mediated by residues in the kinase domain, is essential for PKR function as
well as for the other eIF2α kinases. Multiple sequence
alignment of the kinase domains of PKR and PKZ genes
shows that only some of these residues are highly conserved. A dimer contact that is essential for activity of
human PKR is mediated by a salt bridge between residues
Arg262 and Asp269 [11]. While mutation of one of the

Page 13 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:12

residues impaired eIF2α phosphorylation, reciprocal
mutation of both residues restored kinase activity. This
salt bridge has also been shown to be important for yeast
GCN2 and human PERK function [46]. However, amino
acids forming this salt bridge are missing in 11 out of 31
sequences. Since dimerization is probably important for
the activity of all PKR and PKZ proteins, it is likely that
other residues in these proteins mediate dimerization.
Consistently, second-site mutations that promoted kinase
domain dimerization suppressed the requirement for the
salt-bridge interaction in human PKR [11].
The same is probably true for the residues mediating the
contacts between PKR and its substrate eIF2α because
only 3 out of 12 of these residues are highly conserved.
The residues of eIF2α, on the other hand, are highly conserved between the different species, that is, 100 amino
acids surrounding the phosphorylation site in eIF2α are
identical between zebrafish and human and hence no evidence of co-evolution between PKR and eIF2α was
observed. However, this lack of sequence conservation in
PKR and PKZ is consistent with the observation that most
eIF2α contacts to PKR are directed at the main chain and
not the side chains of the amino acids [10].
A specific feature of eIF2α kinases from multicellular
eukaryotes is the presence of a highly acidic KI linking
kinase subdomains IV and V. The KI is highly divergent in
length ranging from 14 amino acids in C. familiaris PKR to
248 residues in Caenorhabditis briggsae PERK [19] and it
appears to be important for eIF2α phosphorylation
[9,60,61]. Substitution of the Ser/Thr phosphorylation
sites in the KI of human PKR by alanine in combination
with a T446A mutation reduced PKR activity [9]. It has
been recently shown for PERK that the autophosphorylated KI is important for the recruitment and phosphorylation of eIF2α in the cell [61]. A striking difference
between PKZ and PKR proteins is the length difference of
the KI between PKZ (66–80 residues) and PKR (14–34
residues). PKZ evidently acquired a longer KI after the
duplication that led to the emergence of fish PKR and PKZ
genes by the inclusion of two additional exons. As both
zebrafish PKZ and PKR are functional eIF2α kinases (Figure 8), the significance of this difference has still to be
established. However, it is intriguing that the second most
abundant splice variant of zebrafish PKZ encodes for a
truncated KI of 15 residues [19]. In this splice variant, the
two PKZ-specific exons (exons 5 and 6) are spliced out.
The longer KI in primate PKR compared with PKR from
other mammals is probably a result of a duplication of the
KI. This duplication comprises a perfectly conserved
stretch of five amino acids and apparently occurred in the
beginning of primate evolution. Lineage-specific amino
acid substitutions and deletions/insertions provide also
intriguing insights into the evolution of PKR genes. Two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

amino acid substitutions, as well as a three amino acid
deletion, have been identified that are exclusively present
in all eutherian sequences. This pattern indicates that all
of the eutherian PKR genes descended and evolved from a
single ancestral allele.
Zebrafish is the first species known in which PKZ and PKR
coexist. Together with HRI, PERK and GCN2, which are
also found in zebrafish, the total number of different
eIF2α kinases in this species is five. Even more eIF2α
kinases genes (six) are found in X. tropicalis and T. nigroviridis, where we identified three PKR genes. These species
also possess HRI, PERK and GCN2 (Rothenburg, unpublished).
A better understanding of the immune system of lower
vertebrates and the mechanism by which pathogens circumvent the host defense response is of considerable ecological and economical importance. Viruses of lower
vertebrates are abundant worldwide and have been implicated in large losses in wild fish and amphibian populations, as well as in those raised in commercial farms
[40,59,62]. We have discovered heterogeneity for both
zebrafish PKR, with at least two different alleles differing
in four amino acids, and as well as previously for PKZ
(nine alleles) [19]. Given the critical antiviral function of
PKR in mammals and the importance of allelic variation
in immune system-related genes in general, we hypothesize that genetic heterogeneity in the PKR/PKZ system
decreases susceptibility to viruses that directly target PKR
or PKZ. It might be critical to identify the genes of the
innate immune system such as PKR and PKZ for economically important species and take the genotyping into consideration for animal breeding in order to achieve high
levels of heterogeneity and optimal natural resistance.
Furthermore, the low level of sequence conservation
between PKR/PKZ genes in different species might actually be important in limiting inter-species transmission of
viruses.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have demonstrated the presence of PKR
genes in various fish and amphibian species. Independent
duplication events occurred in different fish and amphibian lineages during the evolution of PKR and PKZ leading
to tandemly arrayed genes. Fixation of these duplications
indicates that they provided selective advantages presumably by leading to the recognition of an extended spectrum of viral nucleic acid structures and perhaps by
altering sensitivity to viral PKR inhibitors. Our findings
support the notion that PKR and PKZ play similar but not
identical roles in host defense and open the door to the
investigation of the role of PKR and PKZ in the innate
immune response of poikilotherms and in the interplay
with viral proteins and nucleic acids. The finding that

both zebrafish PKR and PKZ phosphorylate eIF2α in yeast
is an indication of the usefulness of this system for the
characterization of the interaction of viral gene products
with PKR and PKZ.

Methods
Cloning of PKR genes T. nigroviridis, D. rerio and X.
laevis
Twelve hours after intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg/g
bodyweight poly(I:C) (Sigma) for 12 h, total RNA was
prepared from a T. nigroviridis fish, which was purchased
in a local pet shop, using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA was
prepared using SuperScript II reverse polymerase (Invitrogen) using random hexamers according to manufacturer's
protocol. Cytochrome B (cytb) gene was amplified with
primers described in [42] and sequenced. Sequences of
primers described hereafter are shown in Table 1.

We performed 5' and 3' RACE experiments using 5' RACE
and 3' RACE systems (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Relative positions of primers used for
these experiments are shown in Additional file 3. Briefly,
for 5' RACE, 2 μg of total RNA prepared from skin was
primed with tnPKR1race1R and tnPKR2race1R. Initial
PCRs were performed with Abridged Anchor Primer and
tnPKR1 2R or Tn PKR2 2R for 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 s,
58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min. Nested PCRs were performed using Abridged Universal Anchor Primer and

tnPKR1 3R and tnPKR2 3R using identical cycling conditions as noted above. Reactions were performed using
AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (PE Biosystems) and initiated
with a heat activation step at 95°C for 4 min. For 3' RACE,
RNA was primed with Adapter Primer. Initial PCRs were
performed with primers tnPKR1 1F (reaction a), tnPKR1

cloned using TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and completely sequenced.
PCR spanning the 5' untranslated region of PKR1 and
exon 15 of PKR1 was performed with primers tnPKR1
5'1F × tnPKR1 2R. The region spanning exon 14 and the
3' untranslated region of exon 19 of PKR1 was amplified
with primers tnPKR1 1F × tnPKR1 3'utr 1R. Primers
tnPKR1 5F (in exon 17 of PKR1) and tnPKR2 g4R (in exon
7 of PKR2) were used to amplify the intergenic region
between PKR1 and PKR2. After cloning into the TA-Topo
vector, all inserts were completely sequenced using walking primers.
The complete ORF of D. rerio PKR was amplified using
Platinum Taq with primers drPKR 2F and drPKR 5R for
95°C for 2 min followed by 32 cycles of 95°C for 30 s,
60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2.5 min). Expression analysis was
performed with cDNA from poly(I:C) and PBS (control)
treated zebrafish as described previously [19]. PCRs for
PKZ and RACK1 were performed on the same day as
amplification of PKR as described [19].
cDNA from X. laevis spleen was PCR amplified using KOD
polymerase (Novagen) with primers xlPKR1 1F NheI and
xlPKR1 1R for 2 min at 95°C followed by 32 cycles at
95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 2 min, digested
with NheI and KpnI and directly cloned into pcDNA3.1
myc-his (Invitrogen) and completely sequenced.
Yeast strains and plasmids
Zebrafish PKR and PKZ as well as human PKR were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYX113 (R&D systems) containing the GAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter and the
selectable marker URA3. The vector was modified to contain a Precision protease target site and His(6) and Flag
tags at the 3' end of the multiple cloning site. Standard
methods were used for culturing and transforming yeast
strains. Yeast strains H2557 (MATαura3-52 leu2-3 leu2112 gcn2Δ) and J223, a derivative of H2557 in which wildtype SUI2 (eIF2α) was replaced with SUI2-S51A [11],
were transformed with the expression plasmids using the
LiAcetate/PEG transformation method and grown on SDura plates. For each transformation, four single colonies
were picked and colony purified. Colonies were streaked
out in parallel on SD minus uracil (non-inducing conditions) and Sgal minus uracil medium (containing 10%
galactose and all amino acids except uracil; inducing conditions) and grown at 30°C for 3–4 days.
Immunoblot analysis
For immunoblot analysis, yeast transformants were
grown overnight in SD + trp medium. Saturated cultures
were diluted to 1:35 in synthetic complete medium minus
uracil (SC-Ura, containing 2% dextrose and all amino

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/12

acids except uracil) and grown for 6 h at 30°C (OD600 ~
0.8–1.0). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in SGal minus uracil medium (Sgal-Ura, containing 10% galactose and all amino acids except uracil) and
grown at 30°C for 12 h to induce PKR/PKZ expression.
Cells were harvested, washed with ice-cold water, resuspended in breaking buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 15
mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 45 mM NaF, 1 μM 2-aminopurine, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 120 mM (NH4)2SO4, 1
mM DTT and one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche diagnostics) per 10 ml buffer) and broken using glass beads by
continuous vortexing for 15 min at 4°C. WCEs were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min. SDSPAGE was used to separate 4 μg of WCEs. Proteins were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 V for 2 h at
4°C and probed with rabbit phosphospecific antibodies
directed against phosphorylated Ser51 of eIF2α (BioSource International). The membrane was stripped and
probed with polyclonal antibodies against eIF2α (see
[63]). Flag-tagged proteins were detected with anti-Flag
Antibody (Applied Biological Materials).
Phylogenetic analyses
The amino acid sequences of PKR, PKZ and PERK kinase
domains (see Table 2 for accession numbers) were aligned
using MUSCLE, a multiple sequence alignment software
[64], and the resulting alignments were checked using
MacClade (Sinauer Associates). The phylogenetic relationships within the extended PKR/PKZ family were analyzed with the amino acid sequences of the kinase
domains, excluding kinase inserts between β-sheets 4 and
5, which are highly variable in size and sequence, thus not
permitting expedient alignments. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed using maximum likelihood [65] with
nodal support assessed via bootstrapping (1000 pseudoreplicates) [66] as implemented in PHYML [67] and Bayesian methods [68] coupled with Markov chain Monte
Carlo (BMCMC) inference as implemented in MrBayes
v3.1.2 [69]. Model selection for these analyses was performed using ProtTest [70]. The best model chosen for
this data set was JTT+I+G+F, selected by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). For the BMCMC techniques, two
independent analyses were run each consisting of four
chains. Each Markov chain started from a random tree and
ran for 107 cycles, sampling every 1000th generation. In
order to confirm that our Bayesian analyses converged
and mixed well, we monitored the fluctuating value of
likelihood and compared means and variances of all likelihood parameters and likelihood scores from the independent runs using the program Tracer v1.2.1 [71]. The
two independent BMCMC runs resulted in identical
results. These phylogenetic analyses were performed on
the supercomputing cluster of the College of Life Sciences
at Brigham Young University.
