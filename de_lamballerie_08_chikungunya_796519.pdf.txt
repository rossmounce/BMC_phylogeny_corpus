Abstract
Since 2004, several million indigenous cases of Chikungunya virus disease occurred in Africa, the
Indian Ocean, India, Asia and, recently, Europe. The virus, usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti
mosquitoes, has now repeatedly been associated with a new vector, Ae. Albopictus. Analysis of fulllength viral sequences reveals three independent events of virus exposure to Ae. Albopictus, each
followed by the acquisition of a single adaptive mutation providing selective advantage for
transmission by this mosquito. This disconcerting and current unique example of "evolutionary
convergence" occurring in nature illustrates rapid pathogen adaptation to ecological perturbation,
driven directly as a consequence of human activities.

Findings
Mosquito-transmitted Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is
responsible for explosive outbreaks of febrile arthralgia in
humans [1,2]. Several evolutionary lineages have been
identified (fig-1) corresponding to, Western-Africa, Asia,
East/South-Africa and Central-Africa [3]. Phylogenetic
analyses of full-length genomes reveal that CHIKV is readily transported by infected travellers to distant locations
where it generates new outbreaks (fig-2). This propensity
for dispersal and emergence in remote ecological environments illustrates the adaptability of the virus, in particular
to new vector populations.
Until recently, during human outbreaks, the principal
identified vector of CHIKV was Ae. aegypti. However,
CHIKV has been recently associated with an alternative

vector, Ae. Albopictus (the "Asian Tiger Mosquito"), which
has spread in areas previously occupied predominantly by
Ae. aegypti, and dispersed globally via commercial transportation of, for example scrap car tyres [4].
During the 2004 epidemic in Kenya and the subsequent
outbreaks, when CHIKV was introduced into Comoros
and Seychelles, CHIKV was transmitted by Ae. aegypti. Previous studies showed that Ae. Aegypti-associated CHIKV
isolates from Comoros and Seychelles, as well as early isolates from other islands in this region, had an Alanine residue at position 226 of the E1 gene [5]. However, when
the virus reached Reunion and Mauritius Islands, it met
different ecological environments in which Ae. aegypti is
absent or scarce and Ae. albopictus predominates. Within
one year, a new mutation (A226V, ie a Valine residue at

Chikungunya virus dispersal and evolution
Chikungunya virus dispersal and evolution. Phylogenetic trees were produced using alignments of complete or nearlycomplete Chikungunya virus nucleotide sequences, from which the E1 226 codon was removed. Bootstrap resampling values
are indicated at the main branches. Strains with the A226V mutation are indicated. In the tree on the right, horizontal bars are
proportional to genetic distances. The tree on the left shows only the topology of the reconstruction. Branches supported by
a bootstrap <60 are collapsed. Colours that identify the different lineages are the same as in figure 2. Central African strains
that have been assigned to a given lineage based only on partial sequencing of the E1 gene are indicated in the exploded yellow
bubble (a phylogenetic branch reconstructed from E1 sequences is shown). Isolates in the East-South-Africa, Asia and WestAfrica lineages, which have been characterised only in the E1 gene are indicated.

position 226) was identified in some CHIKV samples [5].
The virus also reached Madagascar and Mayotte, where
both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are common. The
A226V mutation was identified in all sequenced 2006
Mayotte isolates [5] and in a recent 2007 Madagascan isolate (this study). This suggests that this mutation is associated with adaptation to Ae. Albopictus and, indeed, we
have recently shown that it improves virus replication and
transmission efficiency in this mosquito [6]. To conclude,
in all Indian Ocean islands where Ae. albopictus is present,
the A226V adaptive mutation was observed 1 or 2 years
after the introduction of CHIKV. Whether this mutation
was acquired several times independently or if an "Ae.
albopictus-adapted" strain evolved in one island and then
dispersed to neighbouring islands is unknown.

The situation is different in India. Our phylogenetic analyses suggest that CHIKV originating from East-Africa or
Comoros was introduced into India in 2006 (fig-1&2). In
2007, an infected traveller from India arrived in Italy and
caused more than 200 indigenous cases of chikungunya.
The Italian strain ITA07-RA1 (GenBank_EU244823) has
the A226V mutation, acquired in Italy (where Ae. albopictus is present) or, more probably, in India (where both Ae.
aegypti and albopictus are present). Since 2006 Indian isolates originate from an ancestor with an Alanine at position 226 (fig-1), the A226V mutation must have been
acquired independently from the identical mutation of
the Indian Ocean isolates. Additional evidence supports
the case for independent mutations. Chikungunya outbreaks were observed in Cameroon (2006) and Gabon

(2007) [2], where Ae. albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti.
CHIKV strains from both outbreaks originate from the
Central-African lineage (ie, are distinct from Indian/
Indian Ocean isolates from the same period), but, in contrast to original Central-African strains (transmitted by Ae.
aegypti) both the Cameroon (Chik_Cam_7079,
GenBank_EF051584) and Gabon (this study) isolates
have the A226V mutation. This implies an independent
adaptive mutation in response to a similar requirement of
transmission by Ae. albopictus.

stration of how viruses can readily circumvent the impact
of human interference on the ecosystem. Our observations also have very serious implications for future emerging arboviruses that infect humans. Aedes albopictus, which
has dispersed into central Africa is also becoming widespread in Europe and North-America. Thus, CHIKV, and
possibly other tropical arboviruses, have the potential to
invade more northerly geographic regions.

It is extremely rare for this phenomenon, known as "evolutionary convergence", to be observed in nature. In virology, convergent mutations have been reported under the
extreme selective pressure of antiviral therapy during the
treatment of acute (eg neuraminidase mutations of influenza virus) or chronic (eg reverse-transcriptase/protease
mutations of HIV) viral diseases. Our results demonstrate
that the selective pressure exerted on CHIKV through the
constraint of having to replicate in a new vector, is similar
to that cited for antiviral therapy. Since the dispersal of Ae.
albopictus from Asia to Europe and the Americas is largely
the result of human commercial activities, the adaptation
of CHIKV to Ae. albopictus provides a fascinating demon-
