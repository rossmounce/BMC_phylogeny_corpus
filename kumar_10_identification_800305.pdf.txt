Abstract
Background: The identification of non-coding transcripts in human, mouse, and Escherichia coli has revealed their
widespread occurrence and functional importance in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic life. In prokaryotes, studies have
shown that non-coding transcripts participate in a broad range of cellular functions like gene regulation, stress and
virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an
obligate human respiratory pathogen responsible for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. Tiling microarrays
enable genome wide mRNA profiling as well as identification of novel transcripts at a high-resolution.
Results: Here, we describe a high-resolution transcription map of the S. pneumoniae clinical isolate TIGR4 using
genomic tiling arrays. Our results indicate that approximately 66% of the genome is expressed under our experimental
conditions. We identified a total of 50 non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs) from the intergenic regions, of which 36 had no
predicted function. Half of the identified sRNA sequences were found to be unique to S. pneumoniae genome. We
identified eight overrepresented sequence motifs among sRNA sequences that correspond to sRNAs in different
functional categories. Tiling arrays also identified approximately 202 operon structures in the genome.
Conclusions: In summary, the pneumococcal operon structures and novel sRNAs identified in this study enhance our
understanding of the complexity and extent of the pneumococcal 'expressed' genome. Furthermore, the results of this
study open up new avenues of research for understanding the complex RNA regulatory network governing S.
pneumoniae physiology and virulence.
Background
The emerging regulatory roles of RNA in prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms are expanding the central dogma of
molecular biology. While the full spectrum of cellular
functions regulated by small non-coding RNA (called
sRNA in prokaryotes) are yet to be established, work is
going on to identify and study the role of non-coding regulatory RNAs in biological systems. In bacteria alone,
more than 150 sRNAs are described [1]. The majority
were identified in E. coli, and their functional characterization showed that they perform regulatory roles in
sugar metabolism [2-4], iron homeostasis [5] and cell surface composition. In bacteria, sRNA also mediates post* Correspondence: bnanduri@cvm.msstate.edu

transcriptional gene regulation, which can be important
in virulence [6,7]. Large-scale identification of sRNAs is a
necessary step towards understanding their functions in
normal bacterial physiology and virulence.
S. pneumoniae, a Gram-positive human pathogen, is
the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and a leading cause of meningitis, sinusitis,
chronic bronchitis, and otitis media [8]. Pneumococci
cause approximately 63,000 invasive infections and 6,100
deaths every year in the United States alone [9]. There is a
precedent for sRNA involvement in pneumococcal physiology and virulence. Investigation of the CiaRH regulon
in S. pneumoniae strain R6 using classic molecular biology and genetic approaches resulted in the identification
of 15 promoters which are regulated by CiaRH, of which
five encodes sRNAs [10]. This two component regulatory
system CiaRH is involved in maintaining cell integrity,
competence and virulence. Expression of these sRNAs

was confirmed by northern blots, and analysis of sRNA
mutants showed that two of these sRNAs were important
for stationary phase autolysis. Two sRNAs identified by
experimental approaches in Streptococcus pneumoniae
strain D39 had demonstrated cis-acting effects on the
transcription of adjacent genes [11]. Thus there is a need
for increased identification of non-coding functional elements in the pneumococcal genome.
A number of computational as well as experimental
approaches have been described for identifying sRNAs in
bacteria [12]. Computational methods usually rely upon
sRNA conservation in closely related species [12,13] and
are often limited to accuracy of transcriptional signal prediction programs (like promoter prediction and rhoindependent terminator prediction). Although computational prediction of sRNAs in S. pneumoniae TIGR4
using program sRNAPredict2 [14] resulted in a list of 63
sRNAs, only nine were validated by Northern blotting in
S. pneumoniae D39 strain [15]. This lack of agreement
between computational prediction and experimental validation necessitates experimental approaches. Experimental methods for sRNA identification include genetic and
molecular biology approaches [6,16,17]. Nowadays,
genomic tiling arrays and RNA-seq methods are commonly used for genome-wide transcriptome analysis in
bacteria [18]. Expression in the intergenic regions of E.
coli and Mycobacterium leprae were identified using tiling arrays, suggesting the likely expression of small noncoding RNAs [19,20]. A recent study identified 27 sRNAs
in Caulobacter crescentus using tiling array approach
[21]. Using parallel sequencing, a large number of putative sRNAs were reported in Vibrio cholerae [22]. Immunoprecipitation with Hfq (sRNA binding protein)
antibody followed by deep sequencing identified 64
sRNAs in Salmonella Typhimurium [23]. A total of 14
sRNAs identified by molecular biology techniques are
described in S. pneumoniae (strains R6 and D39). To date,
global experimental approaches for sRNA identification
in the Streptococcus pneumoniae have not been reported.
Here we describe a genomic tiling array approach for
comprehensive identification of sRNAs in S. pneumoniae
serotype 4 clinical isolate TIGR4. We used whole genome
tiling arrays for these analyses because they offer an unbiased view of transcription at the genome level. Another
reason was absence of Hfq protein in S. pneumoniae
which eliminates the possibility of immunoprecipitation
based identification of sRNAs.
S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genomic tiling arrays identified
50 novel sRNAs in genome, thirteen of which were validated by qRT-PCR. Computational analysis for predicting the function of TIGR4 sRNAs was conducted using
Rfam database searches, BLAST searches and sequence
motif analysis. Tiling arrays also identified 202 operon
structures expressed in TIGR4. Overall, our results pro-

regulatory network of the pneumococcus and underscore
the importance of genomic features present in non-coding regions.

Results
Transcriptionally active regions in TIGR4 genome

A fundamental aspect unique to tiling array data analysis
workflow was defining the baseline for the identification
of expressed regions of the genome. Fluorescence intensities of spiked positive and/or negative control probes
included in the array design are often used for identifying
a probe level threshold for expression. RNA for the tiling
array experiment was isolated from S. pneumoniae strain
TIGR4 [24] during mid-log phase (OD600 nm, 0.4-0.5). To
derive a baseline for expression in our tiling experiment,
we used random probes (~20,000) spotted on the array as
negative controls. For positive controls, we utilized S.
pneumoniae TIGR4 proteome data and selected 35 proteins known to be expressed under identical growth conditions [25]. To minimize sequence based effects on
probe intensity, we took adjacent probe intensities into
account and applied a pseudomedian filter [26]. The
threshold for probe expression was set as 11.0 based on
the distribution of the intensities of positive and negative
control probes, pseudomedian filter setting, and the
accuracy of transcript boundary detection. This threshold intensity had an associated FPR (false positive rate) of
1.63% (Additional file 1). Therefore, probes with intensity
values ≥ 11.0 were considered to be expressed.
Consecutive expressed probes were joined together for
the generation of transcriptionally active regions (TARs).
We identified 2514 TARs in the TIGR4 genome, of which
1324 were found on the nominal forward (+) strand and
1190 were identified on the nominal reverse (-) strand.
The genome size of S. pneumoniae is 2.2 Mb (2,160,837
bp), of which 88.2% is annotated as genes [24] and rest
11.8% as intergenic region. Overall, our results show that
68% of the annotated regions (that constitutes 50% genes)
of the genome are expressed during mid-log phase. In
addition, approximately 55% of the intergenic region was
expressed which includes sRNAs, UTR regions of
mRNAs, and intergenic region within operons. High level
of transcription was detected in the repetitive regions
present inside the intergenic regions, which were
excluded from further analysis. Figure 1, shows the
important steps involved in tiling array data analysis.
Identification and sequence characterization of sRNAs

Novel non-protein coding sRNAs were identified from
the intergenic region of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genome.
Our results identified expression in more than 55% of the
intergenic region. We excluded intergenic region within
operons, small UTRs (untranslated extensions of mRNA)

and repetitive regions (including insertion sequences and
highly conserved mobile repeat sequences like BOX [27]
and RUP [28] elements) from our analysis for identifying
novel sRNA. Here we report for the first time, identification of 50 sRNAs (Table 1, sRNA SN1 in Figure 2A) in the
genome. The majority of the identified sRNAs were
shorter than 200 nucleotides (length range 74 - 480
nucleotides). Since our tiling array design with overlapping probes arranged at 12 bp intervals does not provide
a single nucleotide resolution, we cannot accurately identify the exact transcription start/end sited for sRNA. As
such the start and end for sRNA in Table 1 refer to the
boundaries of transcriptionally active region (putative
sRNAs) and in most cases a promoter is predicted within
25 bp of transcript start site (Additional file 2). The over-

lap between the 50 sRNAs identified in this study and the
63 computationally predicted sRNAs [14] reported for S.
pneumoniae TIGR4 is very small. Only 8 sRNAs are
shared between these two datasets of which four were
validated by Northern blotting [11]. A comparison of
computationally predicted [14] and experimentally verified sRNAs [10,11] is available (Additional file 3). Five of
the sRNAs (SN1, SN5, SN6, SN7 and SN35) were found
to be homologs (BLAST identity > 98%, coverage = 100%)
of the previously described sRNAs (ccnC, ccnA, ccnB,
ccnD and ccnE respectively) from S. pneumoniae R6
strain [10]. The identification of all of the five previously
identified pneumococcal sRNAs in our study, though not
expected a priori, nevertheless strengthens our workflow.
We utilized these five sRNAs as a benchmark dataset for

evaluating the results of our computational analyses of
sRNA sequences.
The expression of sRNAs showed a strong bias towards
the forward strand (38 sRNAs) relative to the reverse
strand (12 sRNAs) even though the distribution of protein coding genes in TIGR4 is almost equal for both
strands of DNA. We found that the TIGR4 genome has
gene orientation bias, a common feature of low-GC
(Gram-positive) organisms. Approximately, half of the
total genes were located to the right of the origin of replication, of which 79% are transcribed in the same direction as DNA replication and vice versa [24] (Figure 2B).
Since two thirds of the identified sRNAs were located to
the right of origin of replication, the majority of the
sRNAs in our study were expressed in the forward strand.
Transcription is usually facilitated by promoter
sequences located in the 5' upstream region on same
strand of DNA. Earlier comparative genomics studies
also have reported the presence of rho-independent transcription terminators as evidence for the identification of
sRNA [29]. Both promoter and rho-independent terminators were also experimentally identified in the five
homologs of previously identified pneumococcal sRNAs
from R6 strain [10]. The results of computational analysis
for promoter/terminator showed that most of the sRNAs
had a predicted promoter within 25 nt upstream of the
TAR start site. In some cases more than one promoter
was predicted in the upstream region of sRNA sequence.
Rho-independent transcription terminators were predicted for 20 sRNAs within 25 bp downstream of transcription end site. The predicted promoter sequence with
transcription start site and terminator sequences for
sRNAs are present (Additional file 2). We also evaluated
the potential protein coding capacity of sRNAs by translating the sequences in all three open reading frames. Our
results indicate that two sRNAs (SN48 and SN50) encoding regions have the potential to code smaller proteins.
Further analysis of the DNA sequence in these regions
using "FGENESB" gene prediction tool http://www.softberry.com identified the presence of smaller ORF (open
reading frame). We did not find any predicted promoter
sequences in the upstream regions of these two sRNAs,
suggesting they may constitute part of an operon. Further
analysis revealed that SN48 is indeed located in a four
gene operon (SP1166 to SP1169). BLAST based sequence
searches against non-redundant protein database at
NCBI did not identify any matches for these two sRNAs
in other genomes suggesting that these potential novel
genes are currently unique to S. pneumoniae TIGR4.
While SN48 and SN50 could encode proteins, in absence
of experimental validation of ORF, it is not possible to
rule out their functional involvement as a sRNA. Therefore we included SN48 and SN50 in our sRNA list (Table
1).

Comparative genomics of sRNA sequences

The average GC content of sRNAs (35% ± 5%) was
slightly less than the average GC content of the TIGR4
genome (39.7%). BLAST analysis of sRNA sequences
against the non-redundant nucleotide database at NCBI
revealed that all sRNA sequences were highly conserved
(coverage ~ 100%, identity > 97%) within other pneumococcal strains (including CGSP14, G54, Hungary19A-6,
R6, and D39; Table 1). But only 25 is found to be conserved in closely related species of Streptococcus (for
example S. mitis, S. gordonii, and S. sanguinis SK36) [30].
However, these sRNAs were not conserved in other species of Streptococcus like S. pyogenes, S. mutans, or S.
bovis. This lack of sRNA sequence conservation at the
genus level indicates that these sRNAs might have been
acquired during pneumococcal evolution. Six sRNA
sequences were found to be conserved in other species
outside Streptococcaceae (for example Lactobacillus,
Clostridium, and Bacillus) and are known to be involved
in various regulatory functions.
Computational functional prediction of sRNAs

sRNAs can be functionally characterized as either cis- or
trans- regulators based on the location of their target
genes. The Rfam database [31] is a collection of non-coding RNA families represented by multiple sequence alignments and profile stochastic context-free grammars. We
searched all TIGR4 sRNA sequences against the Rfam
database to determine their putative functions. We found
that some of the pneumococcal sRNAs we identified were
homologs to well characterized sRNAs in other genomes.
The identified functional categories include FMN riboswitches, TPP riboswitch, PyrR family, Tbox leader elements, r-protein leader autoregulatory structure, putative
endoribonuclease (RNaseP_bact_b), tmRNA, and 6S
(Table 1; description of individual categories is available
at Rfam). With Rfam database searches we could assign
putative functions to 14 sRNAs, 11 of which were predicted to be cis-regulators. Three of the cis-sRNAs were
predicted riboswitches that could directly bind a small
target molecule. For 36 sRNAs we could not predict function using computational methods. These sRNAs likely
represent a novel set of non-coding sRNAs in pneumococci.
Motif and structural analysis of sRNA sequences

To identify sequence characteristics among the pneumococcal sRNAs, we searched for the presence of overrepresented sequence motifs using MEME SUITE [32]. A
sequence motif is a nucleotide sequence pattern that is
widespread and has, or is predicted to have, structural or
biological significance. All sRNA sequences were used for
motif prediction, and the top 8 motifs (present in total 22
sRNAs) were selected based on high score, length (> 15

track clearly demonstrates that all genes predicted in S10 operon are expressed at similar level and this expression is higher than the intensity threshold for expression (11.0).

nucleotides), and p-value (< 1e-10). Our results indicate
that sRNAs predicted to have similar functions share
common motif sequences (Figure 3). All members of
motif group M1 and M2 were functionally similar, the
five sRNAs which were homologs of CiaRH regulated
sRNA in S. pneumoniae R6 strain. Similarly, members of
motif group M3, M5 and M6 share similar functions.
We also investigated secondary structure of motif
sequences based on MFOLD predicted sRNA structures
[33]. Our results showed that in most motif groups, the
sRNA sequences had similar motif structures (Additional
file 4). Motif M1 always forms a partial stem loop-like
structure in all five sRNAs (SN1, SN5, SN6, SN7, and
SN35), while motif M2 forms a large unpaired segment.
Motif M2 in SN7 and SN35 assumes a partial stem loop
structure while a large portion of the sequence still
remains unpaired. Motifs M3, M4, M5, and M7 form
stem loop structures in corresponding sRNA sequences.
Motifs M6 and M8 includes two stem loop structures
along with the unpaired region between them. The 28
sRNAs that had no detectable sequence motifs could represent a set of diverse sequences having different mode of
action.
Searching these motifs in motif database using TOMTOM [34] results in identification of motif M6 associated
with pyrR (transcriptional attenuator and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase activity) regulated function, similar
to sRNAs (SN12 and SN42) predicted function. Motif M6
was identified to be a part of antiteminator binding
region in regulatory protein, PyrR, where it regulates the
transcription of pyr operon by attenuation mechanism
[35-37]. We also analyzed two motifs M3, M5 that were
present in the sRNAs whose functions are well described
in literature. Motif M3 was found to be a part of aptamer
structure (the region binding to small molecules) of FMN
riboswitches [38,39]. Motif M5 was found to be present
in the conserved part of the specifier loop of T-box regulated genes [40,41]. T-box antitermination is considered
as one of the main mechanisms to regulate gene expression in amino acid metabolism in gram-positive bacteria.
The other described motifs could represent important
novel structural or functional regions to be investigated.
Gene expression profile and identification of operon
structures

Our results indicate that ~50% of S. pneumoniae TIGR4
genes were expressed during mid-log growth phase. We
characterized the set of expressed genes, which represent
basal transcriptional activity under our growth condition,
using TIGRFAMs (Figure 4A). The expressed genes are
involved in fundamental biological processes such as
transcription, protein synthesis, protein fate, and cell
division (Additional file 5). Processes such as fatty acid
and phospholipid metabolism were also represented in

Page 11 of 19

the expression profile. We found that approximately 40%
of the expressed genes were involved in processes mediating DNA metabolism, regulatory functions, and signal
transduction. Almost all genes with mobile and extrachromosomal functions were expressed. Genes encoding
surface proteins, proteins involved in acquiring nutrients,
and transporters were also expressed [24]. Interestingly,
one third of the annotated hypothetical genes (97) and
around half of the genes annotated as disrupted reading
frames (52 out of 92) were expressed.
In bacteria genes involved in carrying out similar function are often organized into operon structures. Identifying operon structures is critical for understanding
coordinated regulation of bacterial transcriptome. Identifying transcriptional units can also help in assigning
function to hypothetical genes when present in an operon
of known function [42]. Tiling arrays efficiently identify
co-expressed genes and transcription units at a genomic
scale. We identified co-expression for 520 pairs of TIGR4
genes (Additional file 6) that were transcribed together
and constituted minimal operons. By joining consecutive
overlapping pairs of co-expressed genes, we identified
202 distinct transcription units/operons (size varied
between two to fifteen genes; Additional file 7).
The operons identified in this study were compared to
previously described pneumococcal operons (Table 2).
The vic, man, atp, and marMP operons identified by tiling arrays concur with previously described operon
structures [43-46]. In S. pneumoniae R6, marMP operon
is considered to have three genes (SP2108-SP2110 in S.
pneumoniae TIGR4). In contrast, our results identified
only two genes as transcription unit (SP2109-2110). Our
data clearly shows that the expression of SP2108 is higher
than SP2109 - SP2110 (Additional file 8), suggests that
SP2108 is either expressed as an independent transcription unit or there exists a possibility of overlapping transcripts among these three genes. We did not identify
murMN, phg, and comCDE operon expression, suggesting
that these genes may not be required for mid-log growth
phase. Lack of expression of competence related genes is
expected as THB medium used for propagating S. pneumoniae does not support competence.
Comparing our experimentally identified co-expressed
genes with computationally predicted operons using
"DOOR" [47] showed that there was an approximately
63% overlap between both datasets (291 gene pairs,
excluding rRNA and tRNA; Additional file 9). Thus, our
dataset experimentally validates 291 DOOR gene-pair
predictions. Tiling array expression analysis also identified 229 additional co-expressed gene-pairs that were not
predicted by DOOR, which may help in refining the
boundaries of identified transcriptional units with greater
accuracy. For example, DOOR predicted the S10 operon
(coding for ribosomal proteins) in TIGR4 as a 14 gene

operon (SP0209-SP0222). However, tiling analysis indicated that the S10 operon has 15 genes (SP0208-SP0222)
and included SP0208 (Figure 4B). Interestingly, we found
that Bacillus subtilis S10 operon structure is similar to
our experimentally derived pneumococcal S10 operon
structure (fifteen genes, including a SP0208 homolog)
[48]. One possible reason for the exclusion of SP0208 by
DOOR could be the relatively large 217 bp intergenic
region between SP0208 and SP0209. In another example,
tiling expression identified rplK-rplA (SP0630-SP0631)
genes as part of single transcriptional unit, but DOOR
failed to identify this unit possibly due to the presence of
a large 207 bp intergenic region between rplK and rplA.
Proteins encoded by genes in the same operon often
have related function or are in the same biological pathway. Therefore, putative function may be assigned to

hypothetical genes when located in an operon of known
function [42]. In our operon dataset, approximately 20%
(147) of the genes encode hypothetical proteins. In
operon 8, a three gene operon (SP0077 - SP0079), two
genes encode Trk family of potassium uptake proteins,
and one gene (SP0077) encodes a hypothetical protein.
Therefore, it is possible that SP0077 may be a member of
the Trk transporter protein family. In another three gene
operon (SP0904-SP0906), all genes encode hypothetical
proteins; it is possible these proteins have similar as yet
un-assigned functions.
Experimental validation of sRNAs

Expression of 14 sRNAs identified by genomic tiling
expression analysis was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The
sRNAs selected for validation included 5 sRNAs identified in S. pneumoniae R6 strain and 9 novel TIGR4

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/350

sRNAs identified in the current study. Statistical t-tests
were performed for each sRNA between the Ct value for
the (reverse strand) vs the Ct value of the background (no
primer) to determine if there was significantly higher
expression than background. Another t-test was conducted for each sRNA between the Ct value for the
reverse strand vs the Ct value for the forward strand to
determine if there was significant expression from the
sense strand. At p ≤ 0.05, for 13 sRNAs we found significantly higher expression (lower Ct value) for the coding
strand specific qRT-PCR compared to the non-coding
strand and background (no primer) (Additional file 10).
The p-value of sRNA SN24 was not significant at p < 0.05.
Three of the validated sRNAs (SN4, SN12 and SN16) had
available annotations (Table 1). Although validated, no
functional information was predicted for sRNAs SN2,
SN11, SN22 and SN27. All five sRNAs whose homologs
were present in S. pneumoniae R6 strain were also positively validated. Overall, qRT-PCR validations were successful for thirteen out of fourteen sRNAs.

Discussion
Tiling array analysis is widely used in eukaryotes to study
transcriptional complexity and identifying non-coding
transcripts [49-52]. Recent studies in Mycobacterium leprae and E.coli described whole genome tiling array
approach for sRNA identification [20]. Parallel sequencing technology was used for sRNA identification in Salmonella [23] and Vibrio cholerae [22]. Individual
experimental studies [10,15] altogether identified 14
sRNAs in two different strains of S. pneumoniae (D39 and
R6 strain). To our knowledge, this is the first study to
report the use of whole genome tiling arrays for experimental identification of sRNAs at a global scale in S.
pneumoniae. The tiling array analysis method described
here is a combination of the methods described by others
[49,52], but tailored for prokaryotic genomes. Hfq protein plays a central role in sRNA function in E. coli, facilitating the pairing of sRNA with its mRNA target [53].
One experimental approach for sRNA identification in
bacteria could be the co-immunoprecipitation of sRNA
using Hfq antibodies [16]. However, S. pneumoniae
TIGR4 genome does not code for Hfq protein which precludes applying this method to TIGR4 genome. Therefore, tiling array approach described in this study is a
pragmatic experimental approach for identifying sRNAs.
Identifying the sRNA repertoire of TIGR4 is the first step
towards understanding the sRNA regulatory network of
this human pathogen.
The transcriptome map generated in this study identified expression in two thirds of TIGR4 genome. Tiling
array analyses of E. coli and yeast reported expression of
87% and 90% of the genome respectively [50,54]. Com-

Page 13 of 19

pared to these studies, TIGR4 genome expression in this
study was relatively in lower proportion (68%). Possible
reasons for this lower expression could be the growth
conditions and/or the stringent intensity cutoff used for
identification of expressed regions. We choose a stringent
intensity cutoff (11.0) to maintain a low false positive rate
(1.63%) for identifying sRNAs, which are usually short in
length (50-200 bp).
As a result, we report for the first time genome-wide
identification of 50 novel sRNAs in pneumococcus using
tiling arrays. Additional features, such as presence of a
promoter and rho-independent terminator, were computationally predicted for identified sRNAs. Almost half of
the identified sRNAs showed the presence of a rho-independent terminator. As speculated by others [29,55], our
analysis indicates that identification of rho-independent
terminator sequence is the strongest determinant for the
identification of sRNA. Furthermore, the identification of
rho-independent terminator downstream from sRNA
sequences helped us in differentiating the sRNAs from
the 5' untranslated extensions of genes. However, it is
possible that some sRNAs may be associated with a rhodependent terminator and thus would not be identified in
our search.
Comparative genomics of sRNA sequences revealed
that only six sRNA sequences involved in various regulatory activities were conserved beyond Streptococcaceae
(example Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus (Table 1).
The evolutionary tree of Streptococcus family [30] indicates that S. mitis, S. gordonii, S. sanguinis SK36 are phylogenetically closer to S. pneumoniae than other species
(like S. pyrogens, S. mutans or S. bovis) which explains the
conservation of 25 sRNAs in S. mitis, S. gordonii, and S.
sanguinis SK36), but not present in other species like S.
pyogenes, S. mutans, or S. bovis.. It also indicates that
sRNA prediction algorithms that rely on comparative
genomics need to first account for the observed low
sequence conservation of sRNAs among different species
[13]. Our results suggest that computational methods
which rely on comparative genomics to find sRNAs need
to focus on carefully selected closely related species. The
50 sRNAs identified in this study along with their comparative genomics could serve as a training dataset for
further computational sRNA predictions in pneumococcus, particularly for the identification of sRNAs which are
not expressed under our experimental conditions. At last,
we speculate that computational prediction of Streptococcus sRNAs using comparative genomics with S. mitis, S.
gordonii, and S. sanguinis SK36 will identify new as yet
undescribed sRNAs.
Exploring the sequence characteristics of sRNAs
described in this study showed that sRNAs predicted to
have similar biological function share common sequence
motif. We identified 8 sequence motifs, of which five

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/350

were identified in TIGR4 for the first time. Members of
the motif group without predicted function could have
similar structural or functional properties. For example
SN20 had motif M3 and might function as a FMN switch
similar to SN4 and SN10, which also contain this motif.
Likewise, sRNAs present in motif group M4 could be predicted to have similar yet undefined function. Structural
analysis of motif (Additional file 4) suggests that they
mainly form two kinds of structure in sRNAs; firstly, the
whole motif forms a stem loop structure (like motif M5)
and secondly, the motif is present as two stem loop structures including the unpaired region between them (like
motif M6). Furthermore, motifs present in sRNAs with
similar function also formed a conserved secondary
structure (for example, motifs M1, M2, and M5). We
speculate that (SN32 and SN38), (SN16 and SN29),
(SN21, SN24 and SN33), (SN14 and SN37) contains similar motif structure and might share similar yet unknown
structure/function. This structural conservation of motifs
also suggests that motif regions of sRNA could be structurally or functionally important regions and can be used
as targets for mutational studies to decipher function.
The accuracy of computational operon prediction in
bacteria is 85-91% in terms of specificity and sensitivity
for predicting operonic gene pairs (pairs of consecutive
genes that are part of the same operon) in E. coli and B.
subtilis, respectively [56]. However, the sensitivity of prediction drops to as low as 50% when predicting transcription units with more than one gene [56]. Two examples
were discussed in results where the computational prediction failed to identify a gene pair as a part of an operon
due to the presence of a large intergenic region between
them. The accuracy of computational operon prediction
algorithms also decreases when performing predictions
for newly sequenced genomes for which no training dataset is available. Based on tiling array analysis, we generated 520 gene pairs that were co-expressed and identified
202 transcription units in S. pneumoniae TIGR4. Our
results clearly demonstrate the effective use of tiling
arrays for operon identification at a whole genome scale.
An obvious limitation to the tiling array approach is the
inability to identify operons whose genes are not
expressed in the experimental growth condition. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that combining operons
identified by tiling with computational prediction greatly
improves operon identification in genomes, as speculated
by other researchers [57]. The operons identified in this
study, though not comprehensive, still represent a validated dataset of approximately 202 operons.
Around 8% of the S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genome is
repetitive in nature. It includes sequences (> 50 bp) that
are present at multiple locations in the genome, such as
mobile genetic elements, small dispersed repeats like
RUP and BOX elements, and other repetitive regions.

Page 14 of 19

Although these regions were excluded for identifying
sRNA, we detected a high level of transcription in these
repetitive regions from both sense and antisense strands.
Because it is not possible to identify the actual origin of
transcription with tiling arrays, future experiments
designed to analyze the transcriptional activity in these
repeat regions are warranted. In view of recent findings
where sRNAs are involved in repressing expression of
toxic proteins [58] and are present in multiple copies, we
speculate that that these repetitive regions may be
involved in various regulatory activities within the cell.
In conclusion, our combinatorial approach of experimental identification of sRNAs on a genome scale using
tiling arrays in conjunction with computational analyses
of sRNAs in S. pneumoniae TIGR4 has resulted in the
description of 50 sRNAs in this clinically relevant strain.
Our result forms the initial framework for understanding
sRNA-based regulation of S. pneumoniae gene expression.

Conclusions
Here we have demonstrated the utility of tiling arrays to
study whole genome transcription in prokaryotes. The
analysis of high-resolution transcription map of the S.
pneumoniae clinical isolate TIGR4 results in identification of 50 novel sRNAs. Bioinformatics sequence based
searches helped to predict function of 14 sRNAs. Comparative genomics shows that half of the identified sRNA
sequences are unique to S. pneumoniae genome. We
identified eight overrepresented sequence motifs among
sRNA sequences that correspond to different functional
categories. We identified 202 operon structures in the
genome, further validated by available experimental identifications. Overall, this work elucidated pneumococcal
operon structures and identified previously undiscovered
sRNAs, which will enhance our understanding of the
complexity and extent of the pneumococcal 'expressed'
genome. Also, this work opens up new avenues for understanding the complex RNA regulatory network governing
S. pneumoniae physiology and virulence.
Methods
Isolation of total RNA from S. pneumoniae TIGR4

S. pneumoniae strain TIGR4 [24] was grown in ToddHewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract
(THY). Cells were harvested during mid-log phase
(OD600 nm, 0.4-0.5) of growth by centrifugation from two
biological replicates. The harvested pellets were washed
twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4)
and stored at -80°C. RNA was purified from frozen bacterial pellets using Qiagen RNeasy kit http://www.qiagen.com/ following the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated
RNA was treated with DNase, and the purity was checked
by performing a one-step RT-PCR using primers specific

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/350

for 16 S rRNA in the presence or absence of reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR performed in the presence reverse
transcriptase in the reactions resulted in the amplification of the desired PCR product. In contrast, no PCR
product was generated when reverse transcriptase was
excluded from the reaction mix, confirming that the isolated RNA did not have genomic DNA. RNA concentration and quality were determined by using Agilent
Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Foster City, CA). Purified RNA was
stored in nuclease free water at -80°C. One microgram of
total RNA was used by Nimblegen systems (Roche NimbleGen, Inc. Madison, WI) for labeling and hybridization.
High density genome tiling and hybridization

High density oligonucleotide microrrays from Nimblegen
Systems that incorporate "Maskless Array Synthesis" [59]
technology for designing probes were used to study the
expression of TIGR4 genome. The tiling array was
designed based on the TIGR4 genome sequence
(obtained
from
Genbank,
accession
number
NC_003028). Probes of 50 nucleotide length were
designed in an overlapping fashion at 12 bp intervals for
both strands across the entire genome, resulting in a total
of 359,366 probes. Twenty thousand random probes were
included for measuring non-specific hybridizations.
Labeling of cDNA with Cy3, hybridization, and scanning
were conducted by Nimblegen Systems (detailed protocol
available at http://www.nimblegen.com/products/lit/
lit.html) and Nimblegen provided resulting raw fluorescence intensity values.
Normalization and data analysis

Spatial effects (uneven washing or scanning) were
removed from the fluorescence intensity data using a
global distance-weighted smoothing algorithm for correction available in the NimbleGen Microarray Data Processing Pipeline (NMPP) [60]. NMPP output was log
transformed for further analysis. Quantile normalization
was performed using the Affy package available in R language http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/library/affy/html/normalize.quantiles.html to remove systematic errors (biases)
from the replicate slides and to generate identical intensity distribution for both chips [61]. The correlation coefficient between the intensities of the two chips was r2 ≥
0.90.
Although a number of methods are described in the literature for tiling array data analysis [62-65], most were
not readily applicable to our dataset because of our single
color array design. Furthermore, the existing methods are
not tailored for prokaryotic genomes. Therefore, for processing our TIGR4 tiling array data, we modified Kampa
et al. method [52] as described below:
1. Instead of using PM (positive-match) - MM (mismatch) intensities, we used PM probe intensities only.

Page 15 of 19

2. Pseudomedian filter (which takes adjacent probe
intensities into account) was used to adjust for sequence
based variation at the probe level and provide an initial
smoothing of the raw probe intensity values [26]. Pseudomedian (Hodges-Lehman estimator) for each probe was
calculated with a sliding window size of 11 probes (170
bp).
3. To identify the transcribed regions of the genome, we
considered a probe to be expressed when its pseudomedian intensity was found to be higher than a threshold
value. The threshold value was determined on the basis of
distribution of positive and negative control probe intensities, pseudomedian filter setting, accuracy of transcript
boundary detection, and the associated false positive rate.
4. To identify TARs (transcriptionally active regions),
consecutive expressed (transcribed) probes were joined
together using maxgap-minrun method [52]. The maxgap parameter allows certain number of probes (one or
two probes) to be below the cutoff while still being incorporated into the TAR, whereas the minrun parameter
requires at least a certain length of the TAR to be considered further. To account for the densely packed prokaryotic genomes (shorter intergenic regions), the maxgap
feature was not applied in the intergenic regions. We used
a minrun value of 74 (at least 3 consecutive probes) for
sRNA detection.
5. The pseudomedian filter can result in slightly erroneous identification of transcript boundaries (start and
end). Therefore, we implemented a new step that remodified transcript boundaries using normalized average
raw intensity values. Re-modification was conducted by
either elongating or shortening transcript ends until the
average raw intensity values of the probe (not pseudomedian value) was greater than or equal to the threshold cut
off. Overlapping transcripts were then joined together for
TAR generation.
All of the above analytical steps were performed using
in-house PERL scripts. Steps one, four, and five were
modifications of the Kampa method and are specific to
our analysis. The tiling array data from this study have
been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus under
accession no. GSE12636.
Analysis of annotated regions of TIGR4 genome
Gene expression

Identified TARs were mapped to the current annotation
of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genome [24]. We found that
each gene was represented by a mixed set of expressed
and non expressed probes. Genes that had a significantly
higher proportion of expressed probes in a binomial test
[50] were considered to be expressed (p < .001, which
results in at least 70% gene length coverage by TAR). This
set of expressed genes represented the basal transcription
of TIGR4. Functional analysis of the expressed genes was

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:350
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/350

conducted based on "TIGRFAMs" http://www.tigr.org/
TIGRFAMs/index.shtml.
Operons

Because tiling arrays measure expression in the intergenic
regions of annotated genomes, they can be used to identify and predict operon structures in bacteria. Two or
more consecutive genes were considered to be part of an
operon, if they fulfilled the following criteria: (a) they are
expressed, (b) they are transcribed in same direction, and
(c) the intergenic region between the genes was identified
as a single expressed transcript that overlapped the genes
in both directions. Overlapping pairs of genes are joined
together to identify large operon structures.
sRNAs identification, genomic and structural analysis

To identify small RNAs, TARs were mapped to intergenic
regions of the S. pneumoniae chromosome. Intergenic
regions within operons, small 5' and 3' untranslated
extensions (UTR) of mRNAs, and non-unique regions
(mobile genetic elements and repetitive regions) of the
genome were excluded. Only sRNAs that were identified
at a minimum length of 74 bp (3 consecutive probes)
were considered. Additional features for sRNAs such as
promoters and transcription terminators were predicted
computationally to add confidence in their identification.
Bacterial promoter prediction was done using the "Neural Network Promoter Prediction" program http://
www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html[66]. Putative
sRNA sequences including 50 base pair upstream region
were utilized for promoter prediction. Rho-independent
transcription terminators were identified using program
TransTermHP [67]. The putative sRNA sequence with 50
base pair downstream region is included for terminator
prediction. UTR regions of length less than 100 bp are
discarded. Variation in transcriptional intensity, presence
of promoter and presence of rho-independent terminators are used as evidences to identify structural regulatory elements located inside the leader sequences. A
circular S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genome map along with
genes and sRNAs was generated using DNAPlotter [68].
All sRNA sequences were searched against Rfam database [31] for functional annotation. BLASTN searches
were performed against non redundant nucleotide database at NCBI to determine sRNA sequence conservation
among other genomes. MEME [69] was used for the identification of motifs in non-aligned sRNA sequences,
where a motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of nucleotide sequences. Selected motifs
were searched for their presence against the preexisting
motif database using TOMTOM [34]. Sequence logos for
predicted motifs were generated by WebLogo [70]. sRNA
secondary structures were predicted using MFOLD [33].
The sRNAs, along with additional features, were mapped
onto the TIGR4 genome in Genome Browser "GBrowse"

qReal-time PCR

Expressions of 13 sRNAs were validated by complementary quantitative Reverse Transcription - Polymerase
Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). PCR primers were designed
(Additional file 11) using Primer3 [72] with at least one
GC clamp on the 3" end. The same RNA used for tiling
array labeling and hybridization was used as the template
for qRT-PCR. All reverse transcription (RT) and subsequent PCR reactions were done in parallel and in triplicate. For each sRNA, three different RT reactions were
set up. To measure possible expression of each complementary DNA strand, two strand-specific RT reactions
were done; each reaction used only one strand-specific
primer (forward or reverse). The third RT reaction was
conducted in the absence of primers (to account for
primer independent cDNA synthesis). After the RT step,
both primers were added to all three reactions to complete the PCR step. RT-PCR was performed with 10 ng S.
pneumoniae RNA using the Platinum® SYBR® Green OneStep qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA) as described [73]. Briefly, strand-specific RT reaction
was conducted at 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 5 min, and
0°C for 5 min. At this stage, the PCR primers were added
to the reaction, and amplification and detection of specific PCR products was accomplished using the iCycler
iQ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) with the following cycle profile:
95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 identical cycles at 95°C for
15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Melt curve analysis used 95°C for
1 min and 55°C for 1 min, followed by 80 cycles of 55°C
for 10 s. The Ct (threshold cycle) values from all three RTPCR reactions in triplicate were analyzed to detect
sRNAs expression (Additional file 10).

Additional material
Additional file 1 Determination of intensity threshold for probe
expression. Distribution of the intensities for positive and negative control
probes was used to determine the threshold cutoff for probe level expression.
