Abstract
Background: The legume-rhizobium symbiosis requires the formation of root nodules, specialized organs where
the nitrogen fixation process takes place. Nodule development is accompanied by the induction of specific plant
genes, referred to as nodulin genes. Important roles in processes such as morphogenesis and metabolism have
been assigned to nodulins during the legume-rhizobium symbiosis.
Results: Here we report the purification and biochemical characterization of a novel nodulin from common bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris L.) root nodules. This protein, called nodulin 41 (PvNod41) was purified through affinity
chromatography and was partially sequenced. A genomic clone was then isolated via PCR amplification. PvNod41
is an atypical aspartyl peptidase of the A1B subfamily with an optimal hydrolytic activity at pH 4.5. We demonstrate
that PvNod41 has limited peptidase activity against casein and is partially inhibited by pepstatin A. A PvNod41specific antiserum was used to assess the expression pattern of this protein in different plant organs and
throughout root nodule development, revealing that PvNod41 is found only in bean root nodules and is confined
to uninfected cells.
Conclusions: To date, only a small number of atypical aspartyl peptidases have been characterized in plants. Their
particular spatial and temporal expression patterns along with their unique enzymatic properties imply a high
degree of functional specialization. Indeed, PvNod41 is closely related to CDR1, an Arabidopsis thaliana extracellular
aspartyl protease involved in defense against bacterial pathogens. PvNod41’s biochemical properties and specific
cell-type localization, in uninfected cells of the common bean root nodule, strongly suggest that this aspartyl
peptidase has a key role in plant defense during the symbiotic interaction.

Background
Leguminous plants can establish mutually beneficial
associations with soil N2-fixing bacteria, mainly belonging to the Rhizobiacea family (rhizobia) [1,2]. This
remarkable biological process culminates in the formation of specialized organs, the symbiotic nodules, where
the N2 fixation process takes place. The legume-rhizobium interaction initiates with an exchange of molecular
signals, a chemical dialog that leads to mutual recognition, the attachment of the bacteria to the plant root
hairs, and the formation of the nodule meristem.

Rhizobia invade plant roots via an infection thread
made of plant material while a nodule primordium is
simultaneously induced in the root cortex. Bacteria are
released from infection threads into the cytoplasm of
primordium cells by endocytosis and become surrounded by a plant-derived membrane, the peribacteroid
membrane (PBM). The PBM is a physical and dynamic
barrier between rhizobia and the cell’s cytoplasm. Inside
the hosting cell, the bacteria multiply, undergo a dramatic differentiation process including extreme cell
enlargement, and finally become specialized N2-fixing
bacteroids [3]. In fully developed bean nodules, two
major tissues can be recognized: the peripheral tissue
and the central tissue. Whereas the central tissue is
composed mainly of large infected cells intercalated
with smaller, vacuolated uninfected cells, the peripheral

tissue includes: from the outside to the inside, the outer
cortex, the nodule endodermis, and the inner cortex
(also called the nodule parenchyma), which contains the
vascular bundles [4].
Several plant proteins involved in this symbiotic process show a specific or enhanced expression pattern in
root nodules. These proteins are collectively termed
nodulins and have been classified as early or late nodulins according to the timing of their expression during
root nodule development [5-7]. In general, early nodulins are involved in initial signaling events, infection
development, and nodule organogenesis, whereas late
nodulins, which are induced just before or during the
onset of the N2 fixation process, are involved mainly in
nodule metabolism and function.
Large-scale transcriptome analyses conducted in the
last decade have enabled the identification of plant peptidases whose expressions are up-regulated during rhizobium infection, nodule development and/or senescence
[8-13], suggesting roles for these proteins in the symbiotic process.
Peptidases cleave covalent peptide bonds of proteins
or peptides [14], an essential post-translational modification that alters the half-lives, subcellular trafficking and
activities of a wide array of proteins [15]. In consequence, peptidases are potentially involved in a multitude of biological processes ranging from simple
digestion of proteins to highly-regulated signaling
cascades.
Plant aspartic peptidases (APs; EC 3.4.23), a relatively
small class of endopeptidases, are composed of either
one or two chains [16]. Their catalytic centre is formed
by two Asp residues that activate a water molecule, and
this event mediates the nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond [14]. Enzymes of this group are active at
acidic pH and are generally inhibited by pepstatin A
[16]. Although the biological function of most plant APs
remains hypothetical, these enzymes have been implicated in protein processing and/or degradation, plant
senescence and programmed cell death, stress responses,
and reproduction [17].
APs are synthesized as inactive precursors (also known
as zymogens), in which a hydrophobic N-terminal signal
sequence is followed by a prosegment of about 40
amino acids. Finally, the N- and C-terminal domains are
separated by an insertion of 100 amino acids, a plantspecific insert (PSI) present exclusively in most plant
APs [17].
A small number of plant APs do not contain a PSI
and in consequence have been cataloged as “atypical
APs": nucellin and PCS1 (Gi 2290201 and Gi 15241713,
respectively) involved in cell death regulation [18,19],
CND41 and nepenthesins I and II (Gi 2541876, Gi
41016421 and Gi 41016423, respectively) involved in

nitrogen remobilization [20,21], and CDR1 (Gi
37935737), involved in disease resistance [22]. Despite
having low sequence identity among them, plant atypical
APs contain a high number of cysteines and show specific localizations, which clearly differentiate them from
the majority of plant APs [23].
In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of PvNod41, a novel aspartic peptidase from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) that can be classified
as a plant atypical AP. PvNod41 shows peptidase activity
against casein at mildly acidic pH and is only partially
inhibited by pepstatin A. Sequence analysis of PvNod41
revealed that it is closely related to CDR1, an atypical
Arabidopsis AP involved in pathogen defense. Considering its biochemical properties, as well as its restricted
spatial and temporal expression pattern in uninfected
cells of the symbiotic nodule, PvNod41 could play an
important role in plant defense during nodule
development.

Results
Purification of nodulin 41 (PvNod41) and determination
of its primary structure

PvNod41 was first detected in an attempt to isolate root
nodule proteins able to interact with a synthetic peptide
derived from the amino acid sequence of nodulin 30
[24]. After several interaction assays employing different
experimental conditions, we realized that PvNod41 was
binding to denatured polypeptides. Accordingly, a
method to purify PvNod41 from common bean root
nodules was developed, based on a denatured BSA-affinity chromatography column, followed by Affi-Gel
Heparin Gel chromatography (Figure 1). 12% SDSPAGE analysis of the purified protein fraction confirmed
the presence of a protein with an apparent molecular
mass of 41 kDa. The fraction containing PvNod41 (Figure 1, lane 5), was collected and used for amino acid
sequencing, interaction assays and proteolytic activity
assays. The calculated purification factor from the crude
extract was 250-fold.
The identity of PvNod41 was partially determined by
Edman degradation from purified trypsin-digested peptides (Figure 2). All of the partial amino acid sequences
of PvNod41 were further identified in different
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of common bean (EST
database at NCBI, http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi),
a fact that allowed us to deduce a virtually complete
gene sequence, depicted in detail in Figure 2. Two primers were designed to amplify PvNod41 by PCR. A single ~1.5 kb PCR amplification product was obtained
using either genomic DNA or cDNA of common bean
as template, indicating that this gene contains no
introns. The PvNod41 gene (GenBank: JN255164.1)
encodes a 437 amino acid plant AP (GenBank:

AEM05966.1) composed of a single polypeptide chain
belonging to the A1B subfamily [16]. The two catalytic
sequence motifs in APs (DTG and DSG) are present in
the primary sequence of PvNod41 (Figure 2), as is a
putative signal peptide of 22 amino acids likely to be
responsible for its translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [17]. By comparing the deduced amino acid
sequence of the PvNod41 genomic clone and the Nterminal amino acid sequence of the PvNod41 purified
protein, it became evident that the 50 amino acid prosegment had been removed (Figure 2). Well-known
representatives of the A1 peptidase family are generally
secreted from cells as inactive zymogens that activate
autocatalytically at acidic pH to yield the active peptidase [25]. As we could not find any intermediate form
during the purification process (Figure 1), the 50 amino
acid N-terminal prosegment of PvNod41 is likely
removed by autocatalysis [17].
A phylogenetic analysis was carried out including
selected plant AP sequences representing different
groups within the A1B subfamily. Four phytepsins
belonging to the A1A subfamily, which are APs with
rather different amino acid sequences, were included as
an outgroup. Based on this analysis, PvNod41’s most
closely related protein is CDR1 (43% identity), an AP
involved in resistance to pathogens in Arabidopsis and
rice [22,26] (Figure 3 and Additional file 1), whereas the
other APs were found in different clades (Figure 3).

underlined. The arrow indicates the cleavage position of the
putative signal peptide that directs the protein to the ER. HPLCpurified peptide sequences obtained from the trypsin digestion of
PvNod41 [N-terminal end (N-term) as well as three internal peptides
(P-1, P-2 and P-3)] are also depicted in this figure. The stop codon is
marked with an asterisk.

Preferential binding of PvNod41 to denatured proteins
and peptidase activity

In order to determine its binding preferences, PvNod41
was incubated with native or denatured model substrates. As shown in Figure 4A, PvNod41 preferentially
bound to the denatured forms of BSA, lysozyme and a2macroglobulin, whereas it bound to denatured and
native casein to equivalent levels. PvNod41 was unable
to bind to an unstructured protein such as gelatin, a
mixture of peptides and proteins produced by partial
hydrolysis of collagen generally used to evaluate peptidase activity. PvNod41’s binding preferences for denatured or native BSA and casein were confirmed in far
western blot assays (Figure 4B).
Although purified PvNod41 selectively bound to denatured proteins, no peptidase activity was detected on
BSA or gelatin at pH 4.5 (Table 1). However, PvNod41
was able to degrade casein in both conformational states
(58% of native casein and 67% of acid-denatured casein,
compared to the levels degraded by trypsin) (Table 1).
The optimal pH of PvNod41 catalytic activity was determined on casein, a classic protease substrate (Figure 5).
PvNod41 was found to be most active at pH 4.5 in the
assays, although it maintains residual activity at a wider
range of pH values (pH 3.5-7.5; Figure 5). Similar data

employs succinylated casein as a substrate (QuantiCleave™ Peptidase Assay kit, Pierce). The maximum
activity detected by this method was at pH 5.5 (see
Additional file 2).
The effects of distinct class-specific inhibitors of
known peptidases on PvNod41 activity were studied and
the results are shown in Table 2. None of the AP inhibitors used could completely abolish the hydrolytic activity of PvNod41 on casein. Inhibition in response to
pepstatin A (a widely used inhibitor of APs) was partial,
as was that of 2-mercaptoethanol and Fe3+. The effect of
SDS, known to stimulate peptidase activity, was also

pattern of PvNod41 during root nodule development
was also investigated. No signal was detected in 3-d-old
uninoculated roots, 21 days post-inoculation (dpi)
nodule-stripped roots, or 10 dpi root nodules (Figure 7).
PvNod41 was just barely detected in 12 dpi root
nodules, and accumulated in 14 to 30 dpi root nodules
(Figure 7). Based on the fact that PvNod41 shows a late
developmental expression pattern during root nodule
development, correlating with other late nodulins such
as leghemoglobin and uricase II [27], this protein should

be considered a late nodulin. Additionally, PvNod41
transcript accumulation levels were determined by RTqPCR. PvNod41 transcripts were found in 10 to 30 dpi
root nodules, whereas no transcripts were detected in 3
d-old uninoculated roots. 21 dpi nodule-stripped roots
contained a lower amount of transcript than did root
nodules (Figure 7C).
Since the bean root nodule is formed by different tissues, each composed of particular cell types, we wanted
to know if PvNod41 is expressed in different cells

throughout the root nodule or only in a particular cell
type. The anti-PvNod41 antiserum was used to specifically detect PvNod41 in root nodule sections by laser
scanning confocal microscopy. The PvNod41 signal was
restricted to the central tissue of mature nodules (Figure
8F), specifically in uninfected cells (Figure 8 and Additional file 3). PvNod41 signal was not associated with
the cell wall, plasma membrane, or vacuole (Figure 8E).
Instead, this protease displayed a punctate subcellular
distribution that could be indicative of the endomembrane system. Interestingly, the distribution pattern of
PvNod41 within the cell (Figure 8E) is similar to that of
PCS1, an atypical AP of Arabidopsis thaliana that is
localized to the ER [19].

Discussion
Proteolytic enzymes are usually associated with nutrient
remobilization during starvation, and senescence, stress
responses, and differentiation of cell components
[15,28,29]. However, novel findings on plant peptidase
functions have revealed their involvement in a broad
range of inducible cellular processes [15,30].

A variety of up-regulated genes encoding members of
the large peptidase family have been discovered during
all stages of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis [8-13],
suggesting that peptidases may play an important role in
the symbiotic process. Indeed, rhizobium-induced peptidases have been isolated from various nodulating plants.
MtMMPL1, a Medicago truncatula matrix metalloendoproteinase has been shown to be involved in the Sinorhizobium meliloti infection process [31]. cg12, a
subtilisin-like serine peptidase gene from Casuarina
glauca, was shown to be specifically expressed during
plant cell infections induced by Sinorhizobium meliloti
in transgenic Medicago truncatula plants [32], whereas
Sbts, a Lotus japonicus serine peptidase of the subtilase
superfamily, is transiently expressed during the first two
weeks after inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti and is
proposed to be involved in nodule formation and maintenance [33]. Cysteine peptidases have been implicated

in molecular processes such as defense against root
invasion by soil microorganisms, protein turnover to
create new tissues, cellular homeostasis, and metabolism
[34]. In addition, some of them have been identified in
the cytoplasm of infected nodule cells and their activity
appears to increase markedly during senescence [34,35].
In this work we describe a novel nodulin that has
aspartic peptidase (AP) activity and is expressed exclusively in nitrogen-fixing root nodules during the symbiosis of Phaseolus vulgaris with rhizobia (Figure 6). Even
though AP activity has been previously observed during
nodule senescence [36], to our knowledge this is the
first time that a specific AP has been isolated and characterized during nodule development.
Partial protein sequencing and in silico translation
indicated that PvNod41 encodes a 437 amino acid single
polypeptide containing Asp-Thr-Gly and Asp-Ser-Gly
sequences (DTG and DSG, underlined in Figure 2).
DTG and DSG are conserved motifs found in all plant
APs and are responsible for their catalytic activity. Similarity searches of PvNod41 indicate that this protein
indeed belongs to the A1B peptidase subfamily (MEROPS peptidase database, http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/)
and shares significant sequence similarity with a plant
atypical AP, CDR1, a protein involved in pathogen
defense in Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 3 and Additional file 1) [22].
The biochemical characterization of PvNod41 indicates that this enzyme displays unique enzymatic properties, as compared to other APs. Although PvNod41 is
able to bind to a variety of denatured peptidase model
substrates (Figure 4), it only partially cleaves casein at
mildly acidic pH values (Table 1 Figure 5). Similar to
CDR1 and also PCS1, another atypical AP involved in
cell survival [19], PvNod41 is most active at mildly
acidic pH and is incompletely inhibited by the archetypical AP inhibitor pepstatin A (Table 2).
Plant atypical APs are distinguished from typical APs
by the absence of the plant-specific insert (PSI).
Whereas the PSI is not involved in the catalytic activity
of plant APs, it is definitively required for vacuolar localization [37]. Indeed, most typical APs accumulate inside
protein storage vacuoles [17]. By contrast, characterized
plant atypical APs display unexpected localizations; for
example, tobacco CND41 is located in chloroplast
nucleoids [38], APs from Nepenthes are secreted to the
pitchers [21], and Arabidopsis PSC1 is retained in the
ER [19]. Likewise, PvNod41 expression is induced in
common bean exclusively during root nodule development (Figure 7) and has a specific subcellular localization (Figure 8).
Startlingly, in spite of its sequence similarity to CDR1,
PvNod41 is not an extracellular AP. Instead, this particular AP is located exclusively in uninfected cells of the

Page 8 of 13

root nodule central tissue (Figure 8), and its pattern of
distribution within the cell (Figure 8E) resembles that of
Arabidopsis PCS1, which is localized to the ER [19].
Arabidopsis PCS1 and PvNod41 share some other characteristics: both enzymes are able to hydrolyze casein
but are inactive against other peptidase model substrates, both are most active at a mildly acidic pH but
retain residual activity at a wider range of pH values,
and both are only partially inhibited by pepstatin A.
Whereas the biological role of PvNod41 is still
unknown, it is tempting to speculate that this protein
might contribute to maintaining the integrity of uninfected
root nodule cells via a mechanism analogous to that of
CDR1 [22]. In the central zone of bean root nodules, interconnected rows of uninfected cells are arranged throughout the central region in such a way that they are in direct
contact with virtually all infected cells [4]. In this scenario,
the putative peptide produced by the activity of PvNod41
could induce a mild defense response in uninfected cells,
which in turn could constrain the spread of the bacteria
out of the infected cells of the root nodule. The induction
of PvNod41 during nodulation in both effective and ineffective nodules (Figure 7 and data not shown) in addition
to its absence from uninfected roots supports the hypothesis that PvNod41 is involved in defense.
Future identification of loss-of-function and gain-offunction mutants, as well as the identification of the
natural substrate of PvNod41, will be necessary to
understand better the functional role of this enzyme
during nodulation.

Conclusions
Although a large number of plant AP-like proteins have
been identified, so far only a few of them have been isolated and characterized. In this work we isolate and
characterize a novel nodulin of Phaseolus vulgaris with
AP activity. PvNod41 is expressed exclusively during the
symbiotic process in root nodules and is confined to the
uninfected cells of the nodule central zone. Here, we
have cloned and purified PvNod41, and our results indicate that this enzyme displays some unique properties
and others that are shared by Arabidopsis CDR1 and
PCS1, two atypical APs involved in cell defense and
survival.
Methods
Plant material

Seeds of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Negro
Jamapa) were surface sterilized with a solution of 10%
(v/v) commercial bleach, rinsed with plenty of water and
allowed to germinate for three days on water-saturated
towels in the dark at 28°C. Seedlings were then transferred to vermiculite, inoculated with Rhizobium tropici
CIAT899 [39] and grown in the greenhouse. 3-d-old

Olivares et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:134

roots, as well as root nodules, stems, leaves and nodulestripped roots from 21-days-post-inoculation (dpi)
plants were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -70°C until use.
Protein extraction and purification of PvNod41 protein

To prepare crude protein extracts, 5 g of 21 dpi root
nodules were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground with a
mortar and pestle to a fine powder, and mixed for 10
min at 4°C in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4,
1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 2% (w/v) polyvinyl-polypyrrolidone (PVPP). The homogenate was then
centrifuged at 12, 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant
was recovered.
For PvNod41 purification, bovine serum albumin
(BSA) was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 Gel (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and transferred to a column.
Coupled BSA was denatured by washing with 5 volumes
of 100 mM NaOH. The column was later equilibrated
with 20 volumes of PBS buffer. The protein extract was
passed through the column and unbound and weakly
bound proteins were washed off of the column with 20
volumes of PBS buffer, followed by 5 volumes of 1 M
KCl, 10 mM NH 4 OH. PvNod41 was eluted with 100
mM NH 4 OH and 150 mM NaCl. This fraction was
immediately neutralized by the addition of Tris-HCl pH
6.8 (250 mM final concentration), and then concentrated by precipitation with 80% ammonium sulfate.
After centrifugation (12, 000 g for 10 min at 4°C) the
protein pellet was recovered and re-suspended in 1 ml
of PBS buffer, de-salted against PBS (generating fraction
A, see Figure 1), and passed through an Affi-Gel
Heparin Gel column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA) previously equilibrated with PBS buffer.
Heparin is a linear glycosaminoglycan able to bind to a
wide range of proteins with some exceptions, including
PvNod41, so it was employed to remove contaminating
proteins present in fraction A. The Affi-Gel Heparin Gel
flow-through fraction contained PvNod41 that was practically pure (fraction B, Figure 1).
Amino acid sequencing, PCR amplification and cloning of
PvNod41

100 μg of pure PvNod41 were digested with 5 μg of
trypsin (sequencing grade; Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and the resulting peptides
were purified by reversed-phase HPLC by using a C-18
analytical column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA, USA). Three
selected peptides, as well as the N-terminal end of the
entire protein, were sequenced in an automated gasphase sequencer (LF 3000 Protein Sequencer; Beckman,
Fullerton, CA, USA). All partial amino acid sequences

Page 9 of 13

were BLASTed against the common bean Expressed
Sequence Tag (EST) database (NCBI, http://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi;) [40], and a virtually complete
gene sequence was generated. Two specific primers
aimed at amplifying PvNod41 by PCR were designed: 5’CTCCCTCCTCCTAACAGCGT-3’ and 5’-CATACCAATCTCAGTAATGCTC-3’. The amplified PCR product was cloned into the pCR ® T7/CT-TOPO ®
expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
sequenced by Taq FS Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Fuorescence-Based Sequencing in a Perkin Elmer/
Applied Biosystems 3730 apparatus to confirm the
nucleotide sequence of PvNod41.
Sequence alignment and Phylogenetic analysis

The deduced amino acid sequence of PvNod41 was
BLASTed against different databases at NCBI, as well as
in the MEROPS database, the Glyma1 assembly of the
Soybean (Glycine max) genome project http://www.phytozome.net/soybean.php, the Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula databases of The Gene Index Project
http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/, and the Populus trichocarpa database of The Joint Genome Institute http://
genome.jgi-psf.org/. Related protein sequences were
aligned (ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment Program http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/ClustalW.
html) and displayed using BOXSHADE 3.21 http://www.
ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html.
The eleven protein sequences with the highest identity to PvNod41, as well as representative aspartic peptidases of the A1B subfamily (MEROPS database) were
aligned using ClustalX [41]. Four phytepsins members
of the A1A subfamily were also included as an outgoup. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the
Maximum Likelihood method based on protein
sequences. The topology was inferred using the
PHYML package with the WAG substitution matrix
(loglk = -22012.58462 1). The tree was edited with
MEGA 3.1 software [42].
Protein binding assays

BSA, lysozyme and a2-macroglobulin were immobilized
on agarose beads (Affi-Gel 10 Gel, Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. a-casein-agarose and gelatin-agarose were
purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). One half of each preparation was treated for 10
min with 100 mM NaOH to induce the denaturation of
the bound protein, whereas the second half was
untreated, maintaining the protein in its native state.
Both samples of each preparation were then abundantly
washed using 20 volumes of PBS buffer. 50 μl of each
sample (with native or denatured proteins) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with purified

PvNod41. After extensive washing with PBS buffer,
PvNod41 that was bound to immobilized proteins on
the matrix was recovered by boiling the sample with
Laemmli buffer 2× [125 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS,
20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% (w/v) bromophenol blue] and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and
Coomassie Blue staining.
PvNod41 binding preferences to BSA and casein were
also evaluated using a far western blot assay (also
known as an overlay assay). Briefly, 20 μg of native or
denatured casein or BSA were transferred by vacuum to
nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham
Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK). Blotted membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in
0.5% Triton X-100 dissolved in Tris-Buffered Saline
(TBS) buffer (30 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and
incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 10 μg/ml of
PvNod41 dissolved in TBST [TBS, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X100]. After washing three times for 15 min each with
TBST, the blots were incubated with anti-PvNod41 antiserum diluted 1:5000 in TBST. Immunodetection of
PvNod41 was performed according to the western blot
protocol described below.
Peptidase activity assay

Proteolytic activity of PvNod41 was tested against several model substrates such as casein, BSA, and gelatin
according to established protocols. Briefly, 10 μg of
native or trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-denatured casein,
or native or TCA-denatured BSA, were mixed with
300 ng of PvNod41 and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in
50 mM of sodium citrate, pH 4.5. The same assay was
carried out using 300 ng of TPCK Trypsin (EC
3.4.21.4) (QuantiCleave™ Peptidase Assay kit; Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) as a positive control in 50 mM
sodium borate, pH 8.5. Proteolysis was evaluated by
densitometry analysis of Coomassie blue-stained bands
after 12% SDS-PAGE.
The activity towards gelatin was assayed in-gel as follows: 200 ng of PvNod41 were mixed with Laemmli buffer 2× and loaded, without reducing or boiling, on a 10%
SDS-Polyacrylamide gel copolymerized with 0.15% gelatin. The gel was run at constant voltage (120 V) for 1.5
h at room temperature. SDS was removed by washing
the gel three times with 50 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
4.5 with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at room
temperature and incubation overnight at 37°C. Finally,
the gel was stained with Coomassie blue stain for 1 h,
followed by de-staining. Proteolytic activity appeared as
clear bands on a blue background.
For activity assays at different pH values, 10 μg of
casein was mixed with 300 ng of PvNod41 and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 50 mM of the appropriate buffer (glycine-HCl, pH 2.5; sodium citrate, pH 3.5-5.5;

Page 10 of 13

potassium phosphate, pH 6.5 or Tris-HCl, pH 7.5-9.5).
Proteolysis was measured as described above.
Alternatively, PvNod41 peptidase activity was evaluated
using the QuantiCleave™ Peptidase Assay kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Activity assays were also performed at different pH
values. 200 ng of PvNod41 were incubated overnight at
room temperature with succinylated casein in the presence of 50 mM of the appropriate buffer (sodium citrate,
pH 4.5-5.5; sodium phosphate, pH 6.5-7.5; or sodium
borate, pH 8.5-9.0). After digestion, the fragments were
separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomasie
blue and analyzed by densitometry as described.
The effect of diverse peptidase inhibitors such as
EDTA and pepstatin A, among others, was tested by
preincubating PvNod41 with the inhibitor for 15 min at
37°C before adding casein. Samples were incubated for 1
h at 37°C. The amount of residual casein was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE.
Raising of PvNod41 antiserum and western blotting

13 μg of pure PvNod41 were mixed with 100 μl of complete Freund’s adjuvant (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY,
USA) and injected subcutaneously to BALB/c mice.
Boost injections were prepared in the same manner but
using incomplete Freund’s adjuvant instead, and were
administered at two-week intervals. The antiserum was
obtained 14 days after the last injection.
Plant tissue samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE
and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Biosciences, Little
Chalfont, Bucks, UK). Blotted membranes were blocked
for 1 h at room temperature in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk
dissolved in Tris-Buffered Saline Triton-X100 (TBST) buffer [30 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton
X-100] and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
anti-PvNod41 antiserum diluted 1:5000 in TBST. After
washing three times for 15 min each with TBST, the blots
were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat
anti-mouse IgGAM (H+L) coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA)
diluted 1:5000 in TBST, washed again three times for 15
min each with TBST, and developed with NBT and BCIP
(Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA).
RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA samples were treated with
DNase I (Invitrogen) followed by cDNA synthesis using
the Revert Aid H Minus first strand cDNA synthesis kit
(Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Gene-specific primers to generate 140-150 bp PCR products were
designed using the OligoPerfect™ (Invitrogen) software
(Table 3). Real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed

in optical reaction tubes using an iCycler iQ5 apparatus
(BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). PvNod41 transcript levels
were determined with Maxima™ SYBR Green qPCR
Master Mix (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol in a final volume of 15 μl. The cycling conditions were: preheating for 5 min at 95°C followed by 40
cycles (denaturing for 15 s at 95°C, annealing and elongation for 15 s at 55.8°C and data acquisition at 81°C). A
negative control reaction without template was also
included for each primer combination. The melting
curve protocol began immediately after amplification and
consisted of 1 min at 55°C followed by 80-10 s steps with
a 0.5°C increase in temperature at each step. Threshold
values for threshold cycle (Ct) determination were generated automatically by the iCycler iQ5 software. Eight
technical replicates were analyzed for each biological
replicate. Transcript amounts of PvNod41 in each sample
were obtained by comparison to a PvNod41 standard
curve. The standard curve was prepared by serial dilutions of a known plasmid concentration containing the
coding sequence of PvNod41. Primer and cycling conditions were performed as above described. Each standard
point had six technical replicates. Additionally, a similar
analysis was performed using the bean elongation factor
(PvEf1-a) as a reference gene due to its minimal variability between different treatments. Similar PvNod41expression data were obtained (data not shown).
Immunohistochemistry

Freshly harvested 20 dpi P. vulgaris root nodules were collected, fixed, dehydrated, methacrylate-embedded, and
polymerized as previously reported [43]. For the visualization of cell walls, a method based on the modified pseudoSchiff propidium iodide (mPS-PI) staining technique [44],
with some further modifications, was followed. Rehydrated nodule sections were incubated in 1% periodic
acid at 40°C for 20 min and washed five times for 5 min
each with distilled water. The sections were then incubated in Schiff reagent (100 mM sodium metabisulphite,
0.15 N HCl) for 40 min at room temperature and washed
twice with distilled water. Following, 50 μg/ml propidium
iodide incubation for 10 min at room temperature was
performed. Then, sections were washed three times with
distilled water. The PvNod41 immunolocalization was performed on these sections. Nodule sections were blocked
for 2 h at room temperature in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk

dissolved in Tris-Buffered Saline Tween 20 (TBST) buffer
[0.01 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20]
and incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-PvNod41
antiserum diluted 1:50 (v:v) in TBST plus 5% (w/v) nonfat
dried milk. After washing three times for 10 min each
with TBST, nodule sections were incubated at 4°C for 4
hrs with Alexa Fluor® 633 goat anti-mouse IgG H+L (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 (v/v) in TBST. The sections were
washed three times for 10 min each with TBST at 4°C and
mounted with Citifluor (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, U.S.
A.). Analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Advanced Imaging
Microscopy, Jena, Thübingen, Germany) attached to an
Axiovert 200 M. Alexa Fluor® excitation was obtained at
633 nm, using a He/Ne laser, a HFT UV 488/543/633 nm
dual dichroic excitation mirror and a NFT 545 secondary
dichroic beam splitter with a BP 650-710 IR emission filter
for detection. Cell walls were observed simultaneously via
excitation at 488 nm with an Ar2 laser, using a HFT UV
488/543/633 nm dual dichroic excitation mirror with a LP
505 emission filter. Images were processed using Adobe
Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain
View, CA, U.S.A.). The images shown were acquired from
a single optical section.
In addition, the presence of bacteroids in the infected
root nodule cells was confirmed by the Sytox Green
nucleic acid staining method [45]. PvNod41 was immunodetected as previously described with a specific antiserum. Anti-PvNod41 antibodies were visualized with a
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor ® 633
(red) (Additional file 3). Bacteroid’s DNA and nuclei
were stained with Sytox Green (green). Uninfected cells,
containing PvNod41antigen in the cytoplasm were
clearly distinguished from infected cells containing bacteroids, heavily stained with Sytox Green. Nodule sections were obtained from fixed, dehydrated,
methacrylate-embedded, and polymerized Phaseolus vulgaris root nodules [43].
