Abstract
Background: Nowadays, the focus in metabolic engineering research is shifting from massive
overexpression and inactivation of genes towards the model-based fine tuning of gene expression.
In this context, the construction of a library of synthetic promoters of Escherichia coli as a useful
tool for fine tuning gene expression is discussed here.
Results: A degenerated oligonucleotide sequence that encodes consensus sequences for E. coli
promoters separated by spacers of random sequences has been designed and synthesized. This 57
bp long sequence contains 24 conserved, 13 semi-conserved (W, R and D) and 20 random
nucleotides. This mixture of DNA fragments was cloned into a promoter probing vector
(pVIK165). The ligation mixtures were transformed into competent E. coli MA8 and the resulting
clones were screened for GFP activity by measuring the relative fluorescence units; some clones
produced high fluorescence intensity, others weak fluorescence intensity. The clones cover a range
of promoter activities from 21.79 RFU/OD600 ml to 7606.83 RFU/OD600 ml. 57 promoters were
sequenced and used for promoter analysis. The present results conclusively show that the
postulates, which link promoter strength to anomalies in the -10 box and/or -35 box, and to the
length of the spacer, are not generally valid. However, by applying Partial Least Squares regression,
a model describing the promoter strength was built and validated.
Conclusion: For Escherichia coli, the promoter strength can not been linked to anomalies in the 10 box and/or -35 box, and to the length of the spacer. Also a probabilistic approach to relate the
promoter sequence to its strength has some drawbacks. However, by applying Partial Least Squares
regression, a good correlation was found between promoter sequence and promoter strength.
This PLS model can be a useful tool to rationally design a suitable promoter in order to fine tune
gene expression.

Background
Metabolic engineering is hardly a decade old but its significance is already generally recognized. Metabolic engineering is nowadays commonly applied to improve the
properties and performances of industrial microorganisms: to improve general cellular properties, to increase
the yield and the productivity of native microbial products and for the synthesis of products that are new to the
host cell [1,2].
Thus far, metabolic engineering has been largely restricted
to the deletion and/or massive overexpression of genes
involved in byproduct formation or in the rate determining steps of a metabolic pathway. However, in some cases
such drastic modifications result in deteriorated strain
performances, as the resulting flux distribution of such an
intervention might not be optimal anymore, due to the
interplay of the metabolic pathways in the producer
strain.
Therefore, more rigorous techniques are used both experimentally [3,4] and mathematically [5-7] to both identify
and remedy the bottlenecks in a metabolic pathway. In
addition metabolic control analysis has pointed out that
the control and regulation of cellular metabolism is distributed over several enzymes in a pathway [8]. Multiple
modifications in order to alter the expression level of the
enzymes might thus be mandatory in order to obtain the
desired yield increase.
These mathematical techniques comprise amongst others
the use of detailed dynamic models, both mechanistic
and approximate ones, which are able to elucidate the rate
determining steps in a metabolic pathway. With respect to
the experimental techniques, the construction of promoter libraries seems promising [5,9-16].
Several inducible expression systems are now available for
Escherichia coli. These systems need addition of an inducer
to have promoter activity. In the presence of an inducer,
expression should vary directly and preferably linearly
with the level of added inducer. Unfortunately, most
expression systems seem to exhibit an all-or-nothing phenomenon. Though the population-averaged expression of
a gene controlled by an inducible promoter varies roughly
linearly with the amount of inducer, it is found to be fully
induced in a fraction of the cells and not induced in the
remaining cells [17]. However for metabolic engineering
purposes all cells in a culture should be induced uniformly. Such inducers are thus not fit for fine tuning gene
expression in order to redirect the flux towards the desired
product.
An alternative to the inducible expression systems would
be to insert a constitutive promoter that has the exact opti-

mal strength. However there is a lack of constitutive promoters for E. coli and the available ones do not differ
much in strength. In the literature [9,13,15,16], different
methods are described for generating libraries of artificial
promoters for a selected microorganism or group of
organisms. The promoter libraries cover a wide range of
promoter activities, in small steps of activity increase. We
have followed the strategy of Jensen & Hammer (1998b)
[13] to construct a library of synthetic promoters as a useful tool for fine tuning gene expression in Escherichia coli.
Finally, different mathematical techniques were applied
to find a correlation between promoter strength and promoter sequence.

Results and discussion
The purpose of this work was to construct a library of artificial constitutive promoters as a useful tool for the
model-based fine tuning of gene expression in Escherichia
coli. The synthetic promoters should cover a wide range of
promoter activities. According to the procedures of Jensen
& Hammer (1998a, 1998b) [12,13], the following strategy was performed: (1) design and synthesize a degenerated oligonucleotide sequence that encodes consensus
sequences for E. coli promoters, separated by spacers of
random sequences and flanked with non-degenerated
multi cloning sites; (2) convert this mixture of degenerated oligonucleotides to double-stranded DNA-fragments
using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and a
short oligonucleotide primer complementary to the 3' of
the non-degenerated flank; and (3) clone this mixture of
degenerated DNA fragments into a promoter probing vector.
Design and construction of a degenerated oligonucleotide
sequence
The sequence of promoters of E. coli has been described
and analyzed in several reports [18-25]. Also consensus
sequence motifs are known for prokaryotic promoters
[12,13,26]. From these data we extracted the consensus
sequence for an E. coli promoter (see figure 1).

The Pribnow box or -10 box TATAAT and the -35 box
TTGACA are well known to be present in many prokaryotic promoters and are well conserved for E. coli. In addition, the sequence TTC and TNTT are often found
immediately upstream and downstream the -35 box,
respectively. The sequence TG is frequently found 1 bp
immediately upstream the -10 box. Further the base pair
A and T are found at position -44 and -52, -17 and +2,
respectively. In addition to these motifs 3 semi-conserved
base pairs were included, D (= A, C or G) downstream the
-10 box, R (= A or G) at position -16, -13 and +1 and W (=
A or T) at position -53, -51, -49, -43, -42, -41, -18, +3 and
+4. Based on these data a 57 bp long sequence containing

24 conserved (A, G, C and T), 13 semi-conserved (W, R
and D) and 20 random nucleotides (N) was designed.
In order to obtain an artificial promoter library suitable
for cloning, non-degenerated flanks that carry multiple
recognition sites for restriction endonucleases (Multiple
Cloning Site MCS) were added to both ends of the singlestranded DNA sequence. This resulted in an oligonucleotide sequence of 119 nt (see figure 2). This sequence was
synthesized by Sigma GenosysÂ®. The mixture of oligonucleotides was then converted to double-stranded DNAfragments, using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase
and a short oligonucleotide primer complementary to the
3' end of the non-degenerated flank. In the next step, this
mixture of DNA fragments encoding potential promoter
structures was cloned into a promoter probing vector
(pVIK165) using the following cloning strategy: the mixture of degenerated promoter oligonucleotides and
pVIK165 were digested with restriction enzymes SacI and
XbaI and the degenerated promoter fragments were
ligated to the compatible vector fragments. The ligation
mixtures were transformed into competent E. coli MA8
cells resulting in several clones.

Development of a green fluorescent protein assay
An assay for green fluorescent protein on liquid cultures
was developed based on the GFP assay described by Clontech Laboratories (1999) and Gonzales (2005) [27,28].
First, the relative fluorescence of LB-cultures was compared to LB-cultures where the cells were disrupted by
sonication or 1 drop of 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate). However, there was no difference in fluorescence
between the different procedures. Because LB shows auto
fluorescence, the cells were harvested and washed and
solved in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM
EDTA), physiological solution (0.9% NaCl) or PBSbuffer. Because PBS-buffer gave the best results, this solution was used as solvent (data not shown).

In a next step the effect of incubation temperature was
investigated. Therefore, MA8, MA8 with pVIK165 and 5
clones were grow in 100 ml LB at 25Â°C, 30Â°C and 37Â°C
in duplicate. From these cultures 40 ml was harvested and
the pellet was washed with 40 ml PBS-buffer and resolved
in 4 ml PBS-buffer. Black 96-well microtiter-plates were
filled with 100 Î¼l mixture (in fourfold) and readings were
carried out at 489 nm excitation wavelength and 511 nm

emission wavelength with auto cut off on a Spectramax
Gemini XS. Results are given in figure 3.
Figure 3 nicely illustrates that the fluorescence of GFP
strongly decreases when E. coli is grown at 37Â°C. E. coli
expressing GFP shows stronger fluorescence when grown
at 25Â°C or 30Â°C. This confirms that the formation of the
GFP chromophore is temperature sensitive, although the
fluorescent GFP is highly thermostable. Thus, we decided
to grow E. coli at 30Â°C for GFP activity measurements.
Activities of the synthetic promoters in E. coli
From the LB/kanamycin agarplates 80 clones were picked
up and screened for GFP activity, but only 71 clones
seemed to be positive. The green fluorescent protein activity of liquid cultures of these clones was measured; the
clones cover a wide range of promoter activities from
21.79 RFU/OD600. ml (slightly above the activity found in
E. coli MA8 without mGFP) up to 7606.83 RFU/OD600. ml
(see figure 4).

The promoter library covers 3 to 4 logs of promoter activity in small steps of activity change. The fluorescence from
the mGFP gene without a promoter and from E. coli MA8,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/7/34

that contains no mGFP gene, was also determined. Furthermore, the activity of the artificial promoters was compared to the activity of the pLacI promoter, the
constitutive E. coli promoter of LacI. Therefore, an oligo
was synthesized containing the pLacI sequence flanked
with the same MCS as the degenerated promoter oligonucleotides. In the next step, the pLacI oligo was converted
into double-stranded DNA and cloned into the pVIK165
vector as described elsewhere (see figure 5).
Some of the promoters which resulted from this
approach, turned out to be very strong (more than 27,5fold the pLacI-promoter), others quite weak (almost 7fold lower than the pLacI-promoter). Moreover, circa 4
out of 5 of these artificial promoters have strengths higher
than the constitutive E. coli pLacI-promoter.
These results confirm the findings from[12,13]. They constructed a library of synthetic promoters for Lactococcus
lactis that also covered 3 to 4 logs of promoter activity.
Thus, their proposed strategy to construct an artificial promoter library of different strengths is indeed effective and
here confirmed.

Promoter sequence analysis
Being able to rationally designing a promoter would be
extremely profitable in the context of a model-based metabolic engineering. The present contribution therefore
attempts to link the promoter sequence to its strength. To
this end, several strategies have been applied.

Firstly, the promoters were subdivided into 4 classes,
according to their sequence. Considering the findings of
Jensen and Hammer (1998b) and Rud et al. (2006)
[13,15] these classes are: 1) promoters affected in their
spacer size, 2) promoters affected in their -35 or -10 box,
3) promoters affected both in their spacer size and in their
-35 or -10 box, and 4) no apparent anomalies in their
sequence. The promoters were ordered according to their
strength and coloured according to the class they belong
to; the results are depicted in figure 6.
No correlation could be detected between promoter
strength and anomalies in the consensus sequence nor the

spacer length. This finding for E. coli promoters confirms
the results of Jensen and Hammer (1998b) [13].
E.g., Promoters 8, 16, and 37 are typical illustration of
promoters that do not comply to the postulates of Jensen
and Hammer (1998b) and Rud et al. (2006) [13,15].
Though, promoters 8 and 37 have a mutation in the -35
(TTACA) or the -10 box (TATAT), respectively, and both
have a spacer with length 17 these promoters are strong.
Promoter 16, which belongs to class 4, is on the contrary
weak.
The present results thus conclusively show that postulates
for other prokaryotes [13,15] linking promoter strengthentirely- to anomalies in the -10 box, -35 box, and the
length of the spacer are not generally valid. This might
even seem logical as in general overproduction is not in
the cell's interest, e.g. the presence of the regulatory mechanisms (feed back, feed forward) in cells preventing overproduction. A rough classification in the proposed classes

thus seems not sufficient as a means to rationally design a
library of promoters covering a wide range of promoter
strengths.
In a second attempt, a more rigorous method was followed to link the promoter sequence to their strength. The
sequences of the individual promoters and spacers,
respectively, were aligned and compared with the overall
promoter strength (figure 7). Each entry represents a promoter. The length of the rectangle equals the promoter
strength.
Again no pattern could be detected. The strengths appear
to be randomly distributed in the phylogenetic tree. Thus,
no clear relationship could be detected between the
strength of the promoter and the degree of alignment.

One could also look at which substrings typically occur in
highly expressing promoters and which in low expressing
promoters. All possible substrings that occur in more than
one promoter and that contain 3 or more nucleotides,
were therefore generated. 1216 unique substrings were
found. Both the mean of the strengths of the promoters
containing such a substring as well as the standard deviation were calculated. If a substring occurs only in promoters that are proximal in strength, the corresponding
standard deviation will be low. Thus the substrings were
sorted according to the standard deviation of their mean
strength. Figure 8 shows some of these substrings.
It was not possible to identify a substring that could be
attributed to a certain region of promoter strength. The
first block in figure 8 shows the substrings with the lowest

standard deviations. Those substrings could be interesting
as a low standard deviation means that they occur in promoters that are near each other but unfortunately they do
not occur in more than 2 or 3 promoters and thus not
really represent a substring typical for a certain promoter
strength.
The second and third block of figure 8 shows the results of
substrings that occur in more promoters, but spread over
the whole promoter strength range causing the standard
deviation to be higher. The fourth block shows the substrings with the highest standard deviations. The substrings do not occur often, but very disparately in the
promoter strength space.
It seems thus that the strength of a promoter in E. coli is
not determined by the presence or the absence of certain
substrings. However, a sample set of 58 promoters is not

enough to conclude that consensus sequences typical for
strong or weak promoters do not exist, but if such
sequences exist, they are certainly not unique as a random
sample of 58 promoters is not enough to find some of
them.
In the paper by Jensen et al (2006) [29], a method is given
for finding nucleotide positions that have an influence on
the strength of promoters. They apply it to a promoter set
containing only transitions, no transversions but the
method can also be used in the more general case of random mutations. The promoters are divided into two
classes: strong and weak, with each class containing ns and
nw promoters, respectively. For each position in the promoter, a count is made of which nucleotides are present
in the strong class and which in the weak class (qs and qw).
If a certain nucleotide is found q times across all the promoters at a certain position, it is expected to occur q ns/(ns

the set of weak promoters if there is no correlation
between the nucleotide/position combination and the
strength of a promoter.
The probability of finding the nucleotide under consideration follows a binomial distribution with chance p and
population size q. The probability that a nucleotide at that
certain position occurs more than x times in a certain class
i is:

is no correlation between nucleotides and promoter
strength:

(2)

where nk is the number of promoters in the class under
consideration.
When the actual occurrence of a nucleotide at a certain
position in a certain class, is less than the expected occur-

rence, the probability calculated by equation 1 will be
greater than 0.5. It will be less than 0.5 when a nucleotide
is overrepresented. In figure 9, only position/nucleotide
pairs that have a high P-value are shown. The P-value is
defined as:

if Pr(qi â¥ x) > 0.5
â§ Pr(qi â¥ x)
P â value = â¨
â©1 â Pr(qi â¥ x) if Pr(qi â¥ x) â¤ 0.5
(3)
The higher the P-value, the more likely the corresponding
position/nucleotide combination influences the promoter strength.
Whereas the former techniques did not show any correlation between promoter sequence and promoter strength,
this technique clearly shows that such a correlation exists:
some positions could be identified as having a high influence on promoter strength. Interesting to note is that promoters classified as strong, have a tendency to be shorter
than those classified as weak (see figure 9).
But the technique has some shortcomings in addition to
the drawbacks mentioned by Jensen et al. (2006) [29]: 1)
Promoters are classified in (two) classes. One would prefer a model that predicts the promoter strength quantitatively and not only qualitatively. 2) The artificial division

into two classes: were should the cut-off value be chosen?
One big class and one small class? Or both classes with the
same size? Figures 10a and 10b show the sensitivity of the
number of position/nucleotide combinations retained as
having influence on the promoter strength on the cut-off
value (place were the promoter strength region is splitted). In figure 10a it can be seen that the number of position/nucleotide combinations that are retained as having
influence on the promoter strength is variable when the
cut-off value changes for a constant maximal P-value. 3)
Some position/nucleotide combinations have more influence on the classification than others. But when is a site
considered to have influence and when not? Which maximal P-value should be chosen? Both figure 10a and 10b
show that the maximal P-value has a significant influence
on the position/nucleotide combinations retained. 4) The
influence of the number of nucleotides that should be
counted before any influence of a nucleotide at a certain
position can be assessed: when only two promoters have
a certain nucleotide at a certain position and both of them

are in the same class, that nucleotide/position combination will appear to have a strong influence on the promoter strength. However, a nucleotide that occurs only
two times is not really representative and should thus not
be considered.
More generally, what is the minimal occurrence required
for a nucleotide (over both classes) at a certain position
before considering to test it for influence on promoter
strength? Figure 10b shows that the number of relevant
position/nucleotide combinations drops significantly
when the minimal occurrence requested increases. Also,
when the requested minimal occurrence is higher, the
influence of the cut-off position is stronger: more significant position/nucleotide combinations are found when
the cut-off position is in the middle or at one of the ends
of the promoter strength region.
Nevertheless, this technique can aid in designing new promoters, as was shown by Jensen et al. (2006) [29]. But it

the promoters. Partial Least Squares (PLS) models do not
have the above mentioned limitations.

Therefore, to link the promoter sequence to its strength in
a quantitative way, PLS regression has been performed.

analyze data with strongly collinear and numerous independent variables as is the case for the promoter library
under study. Partial least squares regression is a statistical
method that links a matrix of independent variables, X,
with a matrix of dependent variables, Y, i.e. the nucleotide
sequence and the promoter strength, respectively. Therefore, the multivariate spaces of X and Y are transformed to
new matrices of lower dimensionality that are correlated
to each other. This reduction of dimensionality is accomplished by principal component analysis like decompositions that are slightly tilted to achieve maximum
correlation between the latent variables of X and Y [30].
The nucleotide sequences were therefore encoded in the
matrix X, as shown in Table 1. Each entry in a column represents the absence (0) or presence (1) of a certain nucleotide at a certain position for a certain promoter [31]. Prior
to further evaluations, the columns containing only zeros
or only ones were eliminated.
The data set was randomly divided into two parts: the
training set, containing 42 of the 49 promoters, and the
test set, containing 7 of the 49 promoters. The PLS model

was then built using the training set. First, to avoid overfitting â as this would result in a model not able to generalize to new data-cross-validation was applied to
determine the appropriate number of latent variables. In
cross-validation the data Xtraining, and Ytraining, are split into
blocks and a one latent variable model is built from (k-1)
blocks of data. Based on this model, the excluded block is
used for testing and an individual predictive relative error
sum of squares, PRESS, is calculated. This procedure is
repeated excluding each block once, and the total PRESS
is calculated for the model with one latent variable. This
procedure is then repeated for 2, 3, ... min (m, n) latent
variables, with n and m the sample size and the number
of variables, respectively, and a series of PRESS values are
obtained [32]. Wold's R criterion, given as R =
PRESS(i+1)/PRESS(i) â¤1, was applied to determine the
number of latent variables to be used in the final model.
An additional latent variable is retained only when R is
smaller than one [33]. Using this procedure, 5 latent variables were retained in the PLS model.
Sequentially, the model's predictive ability was assessed.
To this end the promoter strengths of the promoters in the

influence promoter strength. But the technique appears to
be sensitive to the maximal P-value and on how the promoters are splitted into two classes. Furthermore predictions are of limited use, as they only give qualitative
information: "strong" or "weak".
A PLS model was built and validated that reasonably well
correlated the promoter strength to its sequence. Such a
model can be an extremely useful tool to rationally design
a suitable promoter in order to fine tune gene expression
in the framework of model-based metabolic engineering.

test set were predicted by the fully trained PLS model. The
predicted strength versus the observed strength is depicted
in Figure 11.
Thus, a PLS model was built that correlates the promoter
strength to its sequence. The validity of the approach is
shown by the ability to make external predictions: the
strength of 6 out of 7 promoters of the test set is reasonably well predicted.

Conclusion
An artificial constitutive promoter library was synthesized. The mGFP activity of liquid cultures of E. coli MA8
cells in which those promoters were transformed, range
from 22 RFU/OD600 to 7600 RFU/OD600. 57 promoters
were sequenced and used for promoter analysis.
No correlation could be detected between promoter
strength and anomalies in the spacer length of the -10
and/or -35 box. This in contrast to the findings of Jensen
and Hammer (1998b) and Rud et al. (2006) [13,15] for
other prokaryotes, but agrees with the results for E. coli
found by Jensen and Hammer (1998b) [13].
No clear relationship could be established between promoter strength and degree of alignment and in addition
no typical substrings could be detected for strong or weak
promoters.
The method of Jensen et al. (2006) [29] has been applied
to find position/nucleotide combinations that are significantly influencing the promoter strength. Positions could
be detected were the choice of nucleotides is likely to

Bacterial strain and plasmids
Escherichia coli MA8 [supE, thi, del(lac-proAB), Î»-(pir116,
on F')] was obtained from the Netherlands Culture Collection of Bacteria (NNCB). MA8 was used to study promoter activities in Escherichia coli as well as for cloning
purposes. The vector pVIK165 was obtained from the Laboratory of Molecular Biotechnology Plasmid Collection
(LMBP). pVIK165 is a vector for Escherichia coli conferring
kanamycin resistance to the host cell. The vector pVIK165
is a so called suicide vector, carrying a "suicide Î³-ori" replicon. The activity of this origin of replication is restricted
to those E. coli strains (e.g. E. coli MA8) that can provide
in trans the Ï-protein encoded by the pir gene. The vector
carries no promoter followed by a prokaryotic synthetic
ribosome binding site (RBS, 5'-ggagga) and a variant of
the green fluorescent protein (mGFP) gene (containing a
threonine residue at amino acid position 65 instead of
wild type serine residue).
Culture conditions
The culture medium Luria Broth (LB) consisted of 1%
tryptone peptone (DifcoÂ®), 0.5% yeast extract (DifcoÂ®),
and 0.5% sodium chloride (EscoÂ®). The pH of the
medium was 6.7. A seed culture in 5 ml of the medium in
a 20 ml test tube was grown overnight and 2 ml was transferred to 100 ml medium in a 0.5 l Erlenmeyer flask. Incubation was performed at 37Â°C and at 200 rpm for 12
hours.
Enzymes and oligonucleotides
Restriction enzymes, Klenow DNA polymerase, and T4
DNA ligase were obtained from and used as recommended by RocheÂ® and FermentasÂ®, respectively.

Oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma GenosysÂ®.
Second-DNA-strand synthesis and cloning of synthetic
DNA fragments into the vector pVIK165
The single-stranded degenerated promoter oligonucleotides were converted to double-stranded DNA using a 20
bp oligonucleotide (5'-cgaggtaccgaattctagag) complementary to the 3' end of the degenerated promoter oligonucle-

otide as primer for the second-strand synthesis by the
Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I.
The cloning strategy used, is explained in figure 5. The
mixture of degenerated promoter oligonucleotides and
pVIK165 were digested with restriction enzymes SacI and
XbaI. As a result the pVIK165 was cut before the RBS and
the degenerated promoter fragments were ligated to the
compatible vector fragments. The ligation mixtures were
then transformed into Ca2+-competent MA8 cells by using
a modified transformation procedure of [34]. The transformation mixtures were plated on LB agar plates containing (per liter) 0.025 g kanamycin.
Cloning the constitutive pLacI promoter into the vector
pVIK165
The single-stranded LacI promoter oligonucleotide (5'ggcgcaaaacctttcgcggtatggcatgatagcg) flanked with the same
MCS of the degenerated promoters were converted to
double-stranded DNA using a 20 bp oligonucleotide (5'cgaggtaccgaattctagag) complementary to the 3' end of the
MCS as primer for the second-strand synthesis by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I.

The cloning strategy used, is revealed in figure 5. The pLacI
oligonucleotide and pVIK165 vector were digested with
restriction enzymes SacI and XbaI. As a result the pVIK165
was cut before the RBS and the LacI promoter was ligated
to the compatible vector fragment. The ligation mixture
was then transformed into Ca2+-competent MA8 cells
using a modified transformation procedure of Hanahan
(1991) [34]. The transformation mixtures were plated on
LB agar plates containing (per liter) 0.025 g kanamycin.
Green fluorescent protein assay
An assay for the mutated green fluorescent protein was
developed based on the GFP assay described by Clontech
Laboratories (1999) and Gonzales (2005) [27,28]. Cultures carrying the plasmid derivates of pVIK165 were
grown in duplicate in LB supplemented with kanamycin.
After determination of the optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) with an UVIKOM 922, 40 ml culture was harvested and the pellet was washed with 40 ml PBS-buffer
(20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and
resolved in 4 ml PBS-buffer. Black 96-well microtiterplates were filled with 100 Î¼l mixture (in fourfold) and
readings were carried out at 489 nm excitation wavelength
and 511 nm emission wavelength with auto cut off on a
Spectramax Gemini XS.
Promoter sequence analysis
Plasmids were extracted using a NucleospinÂ® Plasmid
Quick Pure kit (Macherey-Nagel) and sent to the Genetic
Service Facilities for sequencing using a 21 bp oligonucleotide (5'-taaccttcgggcatggcactc) complementary to the

mGFP gene. A multiple sequence alignment was done
using the software ClustalW. The software package TreeIllustrator was applied to visualize a radial tree and to link
the respectively promoter activity to each entry [35]. Substring analysis and influence of nucleotide/position combinations on promoter strength as described by Jensen et
al. (2006) [29], were done in Perl. Plots were generated in
R [36] using the rgl package [37]. Partial Least Squares
(PLS) regression was done in the software package R [36].

Authors' contributions
MDM carried out the molecular genetic studies and participated in the sequence alignment. GJL carried out the
probabilistic approach to relate the promoter sequence to
its strength. JM applied PLS regression to construct a
model. MDM, GL and JM drafted the manuscript. EJV and
WKS revised the manuscript critically. All authors read
and approved the final manuscript.
