Abstract
Background: Phylogenetically related miRNAs (miRNA families) convey important information of
the function and evolution of miRNAs. Due to the special sequence features of miRNAs, pair-wise
sequence identity between miRNA precursors alone is often inadequate for unequivocally judging
the phylogenetic relationships between miRNAs. Most of the current methods for miRNA
classification rely heavily on manual inspection and lack measurements of the reliability of the
results.
Results: In this study, we designed an analysis pipeline (the Phylogeny-Bootstrap-Cluster (PBC)
pipeline) to identify miRNA families based on branch stability in the bootstrap trees derived from
overlapping genome-wide miRNA sequence sets. We tested the PBC analysis pipeline with the
miRNAs from six animal species, H. sapiens, M. musculus, G. gallus, D. rerio, D. melanogaster, and C.
elegans. The resulting classification was compared with the miRNA families defined in miRBase. The
two classifications were largely consistent.
Conclusion: The PBC analysis pipeline is an efficient method for classifying large numbers of
heterogeneous miRNA sequences. It requires minimum human involvement and provides
measurements of the reliability of the classification results.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that have the ability to repress the expression
of target genes post-transcriptionally. Since the discovery
of the first two miRNA genes, lin-4 [1,2] and let-7 [3,4],
much has been learned about the structure, biogenesis
and function of miRNAs [5-7]. A growing number of miRNAs have been found in animals, plants and viruses [8,9].
The "miRBase" database [10] currently hosts 4039 miRNAs from 45 species (Release 8.2).

Studies in plants [11], animals [12,13], and viruses [8]
have shown that the innovation of miRNAs is an ongoing
process [14,15], which indicates that most miRNAs are of
different evolutionary origins. Some miRNAs, however,
were also populated through local or genome-wide duplications [14,16], and formed miRNA families. As the phylogenetically related miRNAs convey important
information about the function and evolution of miRNAs, a reliable classification of miRNA families is indispensable for miRNA studies.

Some work has been done in classifying miRNA families.
The nomenclature system for miRNAs by "miRBase" [17]
can be view as one of the earliest classifications. It classified miRNAs with similar mature forms together and
assigned them the same id numbers. In recent releases of
miRBase, a "miRNA family (miFam)" feature was present,
which clustered similar miRNA precursors together based
on computational analysis and manual inspection. In a
recent report by Hertel et al [14], the phylogenetic distribution of miRNAs in 30 species was systematically studied. In that study, potential miRNAs in the species were
identified with BLAST [18] and profile based methods
[19]. The phylogenetic analysis was based on pair-wise
sequence identity between precursors, and the significance of the sequence identity cutoff was evaluated with a
z-score.
These studies have revealed important phylogenetic information about miRNAs. However, there are some underlying problems with the current methods. First, the mature
forms of miRNAs were often used as the classification criteria in the methods, intentionally or not. This can
decrease the sensitivity of finding paralogous miRNAs, as
the mature part of a duplicated copy of a miRNA is not
necessarily under strong selective pressure. Meanwhile,
due to the short length of the mature forms, false classification caused by convergent evolution is very likely to
happen. Second, since a fixed sequence identity cutoff
value alone is inadequate to classify the miRNAs (See
additional file 1: Classification by BLAST), most of the
current methods relied on manual inspection in deciding
the families. This introduces a heavy human factor in the
classification process. Third, most of the current methods
do not have a measurement of the reliability of the classification results. The z-score used by Hertel et al [14] was
no exception, because the z-score was actually a measurement of the significance of a fixed sequence identity cutoff
value (a BLAST-like e-value could be directly derived from
a z-score).
In this study, we designed a bootstrap based analysis pipeline (the Phylogeny-Bootstrap-Cluster (PBC) pipeline) to
identify phylogenetically related miRNAs. In our method,
the families are identified based on branch stability in the
bootstrap trees derived from overlapping input sets of
genome-wide miRNA precursor sequences. This approach
is similar to the "nodal stability" approach [20] that has
been used in phylogenetic tree inference. The difference is
that we vary the input data set rather than multiple
sequence alignment parameters. A "Vote" algorithm was
designed to automate the process of identifying and evaluating potential families. The human involvement in the
classification process was minimized, and the reliability
of each family was evaluated by its supporting levels from
the bootstrap trees. We tested the PBC analysis pipeline

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/66

with the miRNAs from the six animal species, H. sapiens,
M. musculus, G. gallus, D. rerio, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans. The resulting classification was compared with the
miRNA families defined by miRBase. While the classifications were largely consistent, our reliability measurement
showed that a few new families can be supported and several families in miRBase may not be supported. The PBC
analysis pipeline offers an efficient and objective method
for classifying large amount of miRNAs.

Results
Algorithm
The phylogeny-bootstrap-clustering (PBC) analysis pipeline
This method is base on the branch stability in the bootstrap trees derived from overlapping input sets of genomewide miRNA precursor sequences. For a set of miRNA
sequences, we can always perform a multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) and build a bootstrap tree from the
alignment result. Due to the imperfection of MSA, it is
almost certain that some false classifications will happen.
However, the true classifications are generally more
robust to variations in input sequences or alignment
parameters of MSA than the false classifications [20].
Based on this principle, we can add additional sequences
to the original input sequence set of the MSA, and generate a new bootstrap tree. The true families should be more
stable and are more likely to be intact under a branch of
high bootstrap value in the new tree, while the falsely classified families are more likely to be broken up in the new
tree. If multiple new trees are built with different additional sequences, the likelihood for a falsely classified
family to be intact in all the new trees decreases geometrically. In practice, for efficient classification of large
amount of miRNAs, the original input sequences and the
additional input sequences can be genome-wide collections of miRNAs.

Suppose we have n species whose miRNA information is
available. Let Si denote the set of miRNA precursor
sequences in species i, and let Si+Sj denote the union of Si
and Sj. In the PBC analysis pipeline, we use the sequence
sets (S1, S1+S2, ..., S1+Sn) as the input, where S1 is the original input sequence set and S2, ..., Sn are different additional sequences. MSA, neighbor-joining (NJ) tree
building and bootstrapping are carried out for each input
sequence set, and n corresponding bootstrap trees are
built (bTree1, ... bTreen) (see Figure 1). In these input sets,
the S1 set of sequences appear in all the input sequence
sets. The addition of other sequence sets (S2, ..., Sn) to S1
introduces variations to the input of MSA. From the bootstrap trees (bTree1, ... bTreen), we identify the branches
with bootstrap values above the family defining cutoff values and denote such branching nodes as the "family
defining nodes." If all the S1 leaves under such a branch
are also clustered together under a "family defining node"

in all the other trees, these leaves form a consensus family.
The detailed procedure of this step is capsulated in the
"Vote" algorithm described in the next section. A consensus family may contain sequences from several species,
but only the classification of the S1 sequences is confirmed
in this step. The reliability of the classification of a group
of S1 sequences in a family can be measured as the average
of the bootstrap values of their best common ancestors in
the n input trees.
Once the S1 sequences are classified, for an individual
sequence x from (S2, ..., Sn), we can carry out another PBC
analysis with the input sequence sets as (S1+x, S1+x +S2, ...,
S1+x +Sn; removing redundant x wherever it occurs) to
classify x with its phylogenetically related miRNAs in S1.
However, for genome-wide sets of sequences, this is computationally prohibitive (as each run of the PBC analysis
take hours). Instead of confirming individual sequence, in
practice, we formulate a confirmation set of sequences C
which is composed of the sequences from (S2, ..., Sn)
whose phylogenetic relationship with miRNAs in S1 is of
interest. We also remove the most obviously S1-specific
miRNAs from S1 according to the result of the first round,
these include the miRNAs in singleton families in the first
round and the miRNAs in tandem clusters. A new round
of PBC analysis is then carried out using the input set of
(S1+C, S1+C +S2, ..., S1+C +Sn) (removing redundant
sequences wherever they occur; S1-specific sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/66

removed from S1). Those sequences in the confirmation
set C whose classifications are confirmed in the new
round are patched back to the consensus families (of the
first round). The resulting consensus families form a classification of miRNAs that are phylogenetically related to
S1 miRNAs. In other words, S1 miRNAs are the index for
this classification. Phylogenetic relations among S2, ..., Sn
sequences that are not related to any S1 sequences are not
covered in this classification, but such relations can be
examined in the same way by using a different set of
sequences as index.
The "Vote" algorithm
The "Vote" algorithm is the kernel of the PBC analysis
pipeline. The input for the "Vote" algorithm includes the
set of bootstrap trees (bTree1, ... bTreen), the "family defining bootstrap cutoff values" which are derived from well
studied known families and are tree specific, and a "evaluation bootstrap cutoff value" which is used to evaluate
families defined in other trees. Usually, the "family defining cutoff values" are set to be greater than the "evaluation
cutoff value".

The "Vote" algorithm (see Figure 2) is designed to identify
families from the bootstrap trees and get measurements of
reliability of the identified families. Suppose the S1
sequences form the index, as is in the case of the first
round of PBC. First, for each tree and from root down, the

branches with bootstrap value above (>=) the family
defining cutoff values are sought. The search will not go
inside a branch if the top node of the branch already has
a bootstrap value above the cutoff. The top nodes of these
branches are the "family defining nodes." For each identified branch, the S1 leaves in the branch form a testing set.
Second, for each testing set, we can obtain the bootstrap
values of their Best Common Ancestor (BCA) in the input
trees. The BCA of a set of nodes in a bootstrap tree is
defined to be the common ancestor with the highest bootstrap value among all the common ancestors of the set of
nodes (See additional file 2: Best common ancestor
(BCA)). Third, the reliability of a testing set is evaluated by
its BCA bootstrap values in the input trees. If the BCA
bootstrap value is above the evaluation cutoff value in a
tree, the testing set is regarded as supported by that tree. If
a testing set is supported by enough input trees, it is
deemed as confirmed (this is where the name "Vote"
comes from). In practice, we request a testing set to be
supported by n-1 trees, allowing one exception. If a testing
set is not confirmed, it is progressively broken down until
all its subsets are confirmed. Finally, all the confirmed sets
are clustered into consensus families using a single linkage clustering approach [21].
Testing
Classification of miRNAs from six animal species using
the PBC analysis pipeline

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/66

The input for the testing case were the miRNAs from six
animal species, H. sapiens, M. musculus, G. gallus, D. rerio,
D. melanogaster, and C. elegans. These miRNAs cover most
of the experimentally identified miRNAs. S1 was set to be
the human miRNAs and S2, ..., S6 were the miRNAs from
the other five species. MSA was carried out with CLUSTALW 1.83 [22]. Neighbor-joining trees building and
bootstrapping were carried out with Mega 3.1 [23] using
1000 bootstrap replications and p-distance substitution
model. The family defining bootstrap cutoff values are
tree-specific, and are set to be the smallest bootstrap value
of the reference miRNA families (let7, mir-124, mir-17
and mir-1, See additional file 3: Reference miRNA families) in each input tree. These reference families are well
established in the literature. The actual cutoff values were
84% for the "hsa" tree, 90% for the "hsa-mmu" tree, 91%
for the "hsa-gga" tree, 78% for the "hsa-dre" tree, 75% for
the "hsa-dme" tree and 82% for the "hsa-cel" tree. The
evaluation cutoff value is set to be 50%.
After the first round of the PBC analysis, we examined the
composition of the consensus families. For human miRNAs with same id numbers, only 2 are separated in the
consensus families, namely mir-92/mir-92b and mir-449/
mir-449b, showing that most of the miRNA families are
robust to the variation in the input of the PBC pipeline.
We further examined the alignments for mir-92/92b and
mir-449/449b. In both cases, the mature sequences had

high sequence identities while the hairpin sequences had
low identities outside the mature parts. The miRNAs in
these cases are separated into different families, as they
may be the results of convergent evolution.
The confirmation set of sequences were deduced from the
consensus families of the first round of PBC. The confirmation set includes the miRNAs from the other species
that were not classified with their human counterparts
(having the same id numbers). There were 1 from mouse,
0 from chicken, 2 from fish, 5 from fly, and 3 from worm
(including cel-lin-4 and cel-lsy-6). The confirmation set
also includes the non-human miRNAs that were classified
in a family with none of its human counterparts. There
were 13 from mouse, 1 from chicken, 12 from fish
(selected 3 from the dre-mir-430b miRNA cluster), 20
from fly, and 16 from worm. A second round of PBC analysis was carried out. 42 of the miRNAs in the confirmation
set were confirmed and were patched back to the consensus families and the unconfirmed miRNAs were kept out
of the families. The resulting consensus families formed
the classification of phylogenetically related miRNAs with
the human miRNAs as the index. The full list can be found
in additional file 4: Full list of the families with human
member. The supporting levels of the human miRNAs in
each family can be found in additional file 5: Supporting
levels of the families.
The phylogenetic distribution of miRNAs
Based on the family composition, we categorized the
miRNA families in the testing case into categories I-IV.
Category I contains miRNA families that have miRNAs
from both mammals and invertebrates. In addition, we
demand that all the Category I families should have
chicken or fish miRNAs. Category II contains miRNA families that have miRNAs from both mammals and nonmammal vertebrates. Category III contains miRNA families that have miRNAs from mammals only. Category IV
contains the miRNA families that have no mammal miRNAs. The distribution is summarized in Table 1. An abbreviated list of the human miRNAs of the families is shown
in Table 2. It should be noted that worm or fly miRNAs
are present in eight families in category III. These families
were put in category III because there were no chicken or
fish miRNAs in these families. These cases are likely to be

the result of convergent evolution or incomplete miRNA
discovery in chicken and fish. Most of the human miRNAs
in these eight families are from a recent publication [24].
Although the discovery of miRNAs is not comprehensive
in species like chicken and fish, the phylogenetic distribution of the miRNA families still shows interesting trends.
The majority of the human miRNAs are conserved only in
vertebrates. Among the human miRNAs, 47 are in category I, 146 are in category II, and 269 are in category III.
This shows that more than half of the human miRNAs are
conserved in mammals only, and the majority of the rest
are vertebrate only. Only a small portion of human miRNAs have invertebrate homologues. Mouse miRNAs display a similar distribution. For the invertebrate miRNAs,
the portion of miRNAs that are conserved in vertebrates is
also very small, 22/78 in D. melanogaster and 6/114 in C.
elegans. Only a small number of miRNAs, the 15 miRNA
families in category I, are conserved between invertebrates
and mammals. However, more than half of all the miRNAs with known function are in these families. This
shows a high correlation of sequence conservation and
functional importance among the miRNAs. The discovery
of miRNAs is still ongoing, so more data and analysis will
be needed to generate a quantitatively more detailed phylogenetic distribution of miRNAs.
Comparison with the miFam classification
Since Release 8.1, a miFam (miRNA family) feature which
provides family classification information of miRNA hairpin sequences has been available in miRBase. We compared our classification results with the miFam
classification in Release 8.2. Not considering the families
with one or less human miRNA or the families without
non-human miRNAs, our comparison showed that 122
out of the 172 comparable PBC families are the same in
miFam. While most of the miRNA families are consistent,
we examined the cases where the classification was different (summarized in Table 3). Most of these differences
involve additional merging or separation of the families
between the two classifications. For the families that are
merged in the PBC classification, the multiple sequence
alignments of the hairpin sequences are generally acceptable, but the alignments of the mature sequence are not
necessarily strong. One example is the mir-134/mir-412

case (See additional file 6: Multiple sequence alignments
of selected miRNA families), in which the hairpin
sequences are similar while the mature sequences differ
greatly. The situation is reversed in the families that are
merged in the miFam classification. One example is the
mir-25, 92/mir-92b case, in which the mature sequences
are almost identical while the rest of the sequences share
little sequence similarity (See additional file 6). In only
three cases, the families defined by PBC intersect with
(overlap with but are not covered by) the families defined
by miFam, but all these miRNAs are tandem clustered
miRNAs which diverge from each other much more than
most miRNA homologues.
Taken together, the comparison between the PBC and the
miFam classifications showed that most of the families
were consistent. Most of the differences stemmed likely
from the differences in treating information from the
mature sequences. While the PBC analysis pipeline relies
totally on the precursor sequences, the miFam classification may have taken certain reference from the similarity
between the mature sequences.
Classification of new miRNAs
While preparing the manuscript, a new release of miRBase
sequences (Release 9.0) became available. We used our
PBC analysis pipeline to classify the 12 new human miR-

NAs in this release by treating them as the confirmation
set. The results showed that hsa-mir-758 can be assigned
to the hsa-mir-379,380, 411 family; hsa-mir-767 can be
assigned to the hsa-mir-105 family; and hsa-mir-802 can
be assigned to the hsa-mir-511 family. The sequence
alignments and the support levels among the trees can be
found in additional file 7: Classification of new human
miRNAs in Release 9.0. The hsa-mir-758 case is present in
miFam already, while the other two cases have not been
reported.

Discussion
From an evolutionary point of view, miRNAs are a heterogeneous group of sequences. First, miRNAs are of heterogeneous evolutionary origins. Most of the miRNAs are
not related to each other. They are categorized together as
miRNAs just because they share certain common
sequence features and functional mechanisms [6]. As is
shown in the phylogenetic distribution of miRNA families
in this study, miRNAs also differ greatly as to their levels
of conservation across the species. Second, miRNAs differ
in their evolutionary patterns. Some, the let-7 family for
example, maintain almost identical mature forms in evolution. Others, the mir-10, 99, 100, 125 family for example, diverge in the mature forms (See additional file 8: The
mir-10, 99, 100, 125 family).

* "hsa" and "mir" are omitted wherever no confusion can be caused. The miRNAs are human miRNAs if no prefixes are present.

The evolutionary distance between miRNAs is the underlying basis for the classification of miRNAs. The heterogeneous nature of miRNA sequences has made it impossible
to use a single model to summarize the evolutionary distance between miRNAs. In context, many current methods actually manually inspect the classification process,
which brings in a heavy human factor.
In the PBC analysis pipeline, we used a non-parametric
approach. The analysis depended totally on the precursor
sequences, and no model of the evolutionary distances
between miRNAs was assumed a priori. The classification
criteria were essentially derived from the data or were
based on knowledge from the literature (the reference
families). The human factor was minimized in the classification process. Meanwhile, the reliability of the families
can be evaluated by their support levels in the bootstrap
trees.

78 entries), and C. elegans (cel, 114 entries), were chosen
for this study. miFam family information was retrieved
from the same release.
Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was carried out with
CLUSTALW 1.83 [22]; neighbor-joining trees with bootstrap were inferred by Mega 3.1 [23] with 1000 bootstrap
replications and p-distance substitution model. All the
other data analysis was carried out by customized Perl
modules and scripts, which were attached as the additional file 9: The software and instruction for the PBC
analysis pipeline. The codes are also available at [25].

Conclusion
The PBC analysis pipeline is an efficient method for classifying large numbers of heterogeneous miRNA
sequences. The analysis pipeline assumes no models for
the evolutionary distances between miRNAs. It requires
minimum human involvement and provides a method to
evaluate the reliability of the classification results. This
analysis pipeline is efficient for classifying genome-wide
sets of miRNA sequences. It is also an efficient method to
classify newly cloned individual miRNAs into existing
miRNA families.

Methods
Implementation
