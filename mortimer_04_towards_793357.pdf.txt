Abstract
Background: The fliC and fljB genes in Salmonella code for the phase 1 (H1) and phase 2 (H2)
flagellin respectively, the rfb cluster encodes the majority of enzymes for polysaccharide (O) antigen
biosynthesis, together they determine the antigenic profile by which Salmonella are identified.
Sequencing and characterisation of fliC was performed in the development of a molecular
serotyping technique.
Results: FliC sequencing of 106 strains revealed two groups; the g-complex included those
exhibiting "g" or "m,t" antigenic factors, and the non-g strains which formed a second more diverse
group. Variation in fliC was characterised and sero-specific motifs identified. Furthermore, it was
possible to identify differences in certain H antigens that are not detected by traditional serotyping.
A rapid short sequencing assay was developed to target serotype-specific sequence motifs in fliC.
The assay was evaluated for identification of H1 antigens with a panel of 55 strains.
Conclusion: FliC sequences were obtained for more than 100 strains comprising 29 different H1
alleles. Unique pyrosequencing profiles corresponding to the H1 component of the serotype were
generated reproducibly for the 23 alleles represented in the evaluation panel. Short read sequence
assays can now be used to identify fliC alleles in approximately 97% of the 50 medically most
important Salmonella in England and Wales. Capability for high throughput testing and automation
give these assays considerable advantages over traditional methods.

Background
Salmonella express flagellar (H), polysaccharide (O) and
capsular (Vi) antigens which determine strain pathogenicity and therefore variation of these antigens has formed
the basis for Salmonella serotyping. The Kauffmann-White
scheme, first published in 1929, divides Salmonella into
more than 2500 serotypes according to their antigenic formulae. Within these, 46 O antigen groups are recognised

by Salmonella serotyping. O antigen synthesis and assembly is encoded by the rfb gene cluster which typically contains 12 open reading frames, and ranges in size between
serotypes, from approximately 8 kbp to 23 kbp. The variation of O antigens is not due to individual gene sequence
variation, but rather to different sets of genes [1]. Approximately 20,000 repeating flagellin proteins polymerise to
form the flagellar filament. The ends of the protein are

conserved and responsible for the hairpin shape of the
subunit while variation in the central region generates the
antigenic diversity. Most serotypes exhibit diphasic flagellar antigen expression by alternately expressing two genes,
fliC (phase 1) and fljB (phase 2) which encode flagellins
of different antigenicity. Salmonella serotyping methods
recognise 63 distinct phase 1 flagellar antigenic factors
and 37 phase 2 flagellar antigenic factors although the latter are not always present. Some antigenic factors,
denoted by square brackets in formulae, may be present
or absent without affecting serotype designation. Serotyping methods are stable, reproducible and have high typeability, yet there are several drawbacks, particularly the
dependence on availability of antisera considering the
ethics, cost and quality control measures necessary to
maintain such a supply.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) [2,3] is currently
the bench-mark for molecular subtyping of Salmonella,
however it is best used in combination with plasmid profiling and ribotyping for strain discrimination for epidemiological purposes [4]. Other approaches include
fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism
(FAFLP) [5] and multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis
(MLEE) [6] which sample genomic DNA and provide a
view of genetic diversity between strains and partially
group some serotypes, but on the whole do not group or
identify serotypes. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
has been used to discriminate between Salmonella strains
by sampling variation in a set of housekeeping genes
which precludes antigen encoding genes [7]. In 1993, Luk
et al [8] published a length heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR)based method that targeted genes only associated with
particular O antigens (A, B, C2 and D), while a more
recent study by Fitzgerald et al [9] developed a serotype
specific PCR assay targeting a single O serotype (O:6,14).
Several studies have used a molecular approach to discriminate between particular flagellar serotypes (9, 11–
12). FliC fragment restriction patterns using a dual
enzyme combination allowed differentiation of flagellar
types b, i, d, j, l,v, and z10 but r and e,h nor [f],g,m, [p], g,p,
and g,m,s could be separated using this technique [10].
Hong used restriction fragment patterns of fliC and fljB for
serotyping of poultry Salmonella but could not distinguish
S. Enteritidis from S. Gallinarum and S. Dublin [11].
Design of a multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (multiplex-PCR) to identify 1,2, 1,5, 1,6, 1,7, 1,w, e,n,x and
e,n,z15 second-phase antigens has been reported [12].
Peters and Threlfall reported fliC restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles were not specific
enough to differentiate between certain serotypes [13]. To
date no studies have attempted a universal molecular
serotyping approach. Relevant publicly available
sequence data is incomplete, as is epitope mapping information about specific serotypes, therefore approaches are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/31

currently being explored to characterise the expressed
antigen or the encoding genes as an alternative to traditional serotyping.
For fliC, evidence from antibody binding studies suggests
that sequences of ~300 nucleotides of the central variable
region of flagellin correlate with serotype [14] and differences in amino acid sequence can be associated with differences in antigenic specificity. Comparative sequencing
has distinguished some salmonella serotypes or biotypes
[15-18]. Previous studies have provided full gene
sequence for 19 phase 1 flagellar types. The need for a
robust single molecular technology to discriminate different serotypes is clear, however sequence data representing
all 63 recognised phase 1 flagellar types is incomplete. The
aim of this study was to generate full gene sequences for
representatives of the majority of phase 1 flagellar serotypes with a view to identifying serotype-specific motifs.
These were then used to design a short sequence- or single
nucleotide polymorphism-(SNP) based assay targeting
characteristic motifs using pyrosequencing. This technology is based on sequencing by synthesis; four nucleotides
are added step-wise to a primer-template mix. Incorporation of a nucleotide i.e. extension of the DNA strand, leads
to an enzymatic reaction resulting in a light flash. A pyrogram is produced from which the template DNA sequence
is deduced. The assay was validated on a panel of 55
strains to initiate a DNA sequence based approach for
serotyping Salmonella enterica.

Results and discussion
Alignment of 106 fliC sequences generated in this study
and 32 phase 1 flagellin sequences previously published
(see Methods section), representing 35 phase 1 flagellar
serotypes revealed a clear division of sequences into two
groups. Representative sequences are aligned in Additional file 1. A tree indicating the relatedness of these
sequences generated from translated DNA sequence supported this division with a 100% bootstrap value (Figure
1). Sequences encoding phase 1 flagellar antigens exhibiting antigenic factors "g" or "m,t" are referred to as members of the g-complex and the fliC sequences of this group
clustered exclusively with the non-motile strains Gallinarum and Pullorum on the tree (Cluster I, Figure 1). The
level of amino acid sequence homology within Cluster I
sequences was 90.05%. Sequences not encoding the antigenic factors "g" or "m,t", formed the second group of
sequences (Cluster II), referred to here as the non-g complex. Lower levels (80.3 %) of amino acid similarity were
observed within Cluster II. Sero-specific polymorphisms
were identified within the central variable region where
consensus sequences of Cluster I and Cluster II diverged,
between amino acid positions 160 – 407 (based on
amino acid numbering system of the sequenced strain of

S. Typhimurium (AE008787) represented here as
sequence type Typhimurium_a).
Salmonella fliC sequences were conserved at their termini
and variable in the central region between serotypes
[16,18] and clustered according to allele. Amino acid and
nucleotide positions described here-in are with reference
to the sequenced strain LT2. It was apparent from the
alignment of sequences generated in this study that two
assays were required, one encompassing Cluster I strains
and one for Cluster II. Multiple alignments were created
for each cluster and regions of the fliC gene containing
sero-specific polymorphisms were identified at nucleotide
positions 917 – 933 and 739–749 in Cluster I and Cluster
II respectively (Figures 3 and 4). PCR primers were
designed to amplify the target region in each sequence
(see below). One multiplex PCR was developed for each
group containing a mixture of specific primers. All primers designed for short sequence assays in this study are
shown in Additional file 3 and the testing algorithm is
shown in Figure 5.
Summary of fliC sequence variation within the g-complex
All polymorphisms within the g-complex sequences analysed are displayed in Figure 2 The target region (high-

lighted) was selected because it conferred multiple serospecific amino acid substitutions and was variable at the
DNA level. In the 17 bp nucleotide sequence assayed, 15
sequence types were identified (Figure 3). This region was
assayed against the test panel of 17 Salmonella strains
belonging to the g-complex and was able to exclusively
identify sequence motifs corresponding to phase 1 flagellar serotypes. The serotypes not differentiated by this assay
([f],g,m, [p], g,m, g,m,s and g,m, [p],s or non-motile Gallinarum) were known from full sequencing to be identical
at the target region.
Amino acid differences between g-complex strains
identified by full sequencing
The following polymorphisms located in fliC of the gcomplex are likely to be involved in specific epitope formation: two amino acid sequence types were observed in
25 fliC-[f],g,m, [p] sequences obtained from Salmonella
enterica serovar Enteritidis strains. Twenty-three S. Enteritidis strains demonstrated complete conservation in their
DNA sequence (B16, B18, JTCM02 and 20 phage type 4
strains (Enteritidis_b)). The sequence of B17 was congruent with published S. Enteritidis (M84980)
(Enteritidis_a), and exhibited a single amino acid
(Ser>Gly at 302) substitution compared to sequence type

Amino acid polymorphisms among fliC of g-complex strains
Figure 2
Amino acid polymorphisms among fliC of g-complex strains. Alignment displaying polymorphic codons only of g-complex fliC
genes. Codon numbering is based on LT2 sequence, a slash is used where codons fall between LT2 codons in alignment. Highlighted area indicates region analysed in g-complex assay.

Enteritidis_b. Published S. Othmarschen (U06455) fliCg,m, [t] sequence inferred the same amino acid sequence
as Enteritidis_a but exhibited a silent mutation at the
DNA level. As the fliC sequence for these two serotypes
was identical it was apparent that the sequence included
here represented an S. Othmarschen strain in which the t
factor was absent.
Published S. Gallinarum sequences demonstrated 100%
DNA homology to Enteritidis_b except for a SNP encoding a stop codon in M84975. S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum are non-motile as they do not express flagella.
Antisera to the g factor antigen react strongly with
induced-motility S. Pullorum culture, indicating that g
epitopes are expressed in these cells [19]. This correlates
with our sequence data as S. Pullorum clusters with g,m
sequences (Figure 1). Biotype-specific polymorphisms for

S. Pullorum were observed at amino acid position 91 and
323. Molecular identification of S. Pullorum and S. Gallinarum would be of considerable benefit as standard serotyping cannot differentiate these two serotypes.
FliC-g,q was differentiated from all other g-complex
sequences by an Asp>Gly serotype-specific polymorphism
observed at position 284 for S. Moscow. A Thr>Ala substitution at residue 304 conferred by a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) was identified between sequences
of g,m and g,p, congruent with a previous report [20], and
forms the basis for differentiation of these two serotypes.
DNA polymorphisms, but no inferred amino acid substitutions, were observed between strains exhibiting g,m,s
and g,m, [p],s. The p factor was not coded for by the fliC
sequences of these strains.

Sequence motifs at target g
Sequence motifs at target g. The assay for g-complex strains
detected 17 bp of sequence commencing at nucleotide position 917. Fifteen sequence types were identified and differentiated between H1 serotypes.

S. Essen fliC-g,m was distinct from other g and m coding
sequences by an Asp>Asn substitution at 283. fliC-g,p,s
could be differentiated from fliC-g,p by a Thr>Ala
substitution at 254. A motif of two amino acids at positions 302 and 307 was common to S. Derby, S. Agona, S.
Adelaide, and S. Berta which exhibit phase 1 flagellar antigenic factors "f" and "g". This motif was exclusive to these
serotypes. DNA sequence variation at corresponding positions allowed S. Derby and S. Agona to be distinguished
from S. Adelaide and S. Berta. FliC-g,z51; and fliC-m,t with
fliC-g,m,t each form distinct clusters (Figure 1).
Summary of fliC sequence variation within the non-g
complex
Sequence conservation within alleles that did not encode
g or m,t antigenic factors was demonstrated by 97.8 –
99.1% homology and 80.35% homology was measured
in the complex. The high level of variability between alleles in this group did not allow association of specific
amino acids to epitope formation that was possible with
the g-complex sequences. The quantity and distribution of
polymorphic bases observed in this group (specified

among non-g complex strains tested.

below) meant that there was a choice of regions that could
be used for differentiation. Following testing of four
possible regions, the region encompassing amino acids
248–250 was selected for use in the final non-g assay.
Each serotype had a unique motif at the target region
except fliC-l,v and fliC-l,z13 which shared a sequence type
(Figure 4).
Some amino acid sequences were not identical within
non-g alleles, including i, r, d, e,h, a and z4,z23 (Additional
file 1). A previous study of fliC-i sequences reported no
variation in a 260 bp region among seven Typhimurium
strains [17]. Six full S. Typhimurium fliCs and a fragment
spanning nucleotides 434–1090, corresponding to amino
acids 159 – 400, of a further 20 S. Typhimurium strains
were sequenced. Three distinct DNA sequences which
resulted in translated differences in the expressed peptides

and was found in two strains: 571896 and 571913. Strains
571896 and 571913 were phage type DT104 however,

typing patterns so no assured correlation could be made
with phage type or other phenotype. S. Choleraesuis

sequence (fliC-c) differed from that published

and S. Saintpaul exhibit factors e,h in their phase 1 flagellar. Amino acid sequence was conserved in two strains of
S. Saintpaul but distinct for each serotype due to four
amino acid substitutions at codons 192, 213, 238, 356. S.
Brandenburg and S. Panama exhibit l,v in the phase 1
antigen, no inferred amino acid differences were detected.
FliC-l,v sequences clustered with fliC-l,z13(Figure 1).
FliC from three strains exhibiting the z4 antigenic factor in
phase 1 flagellar were sequenced. Cluster analysis grouped
these sequences together in the non-g group although
they contain regions of sequence similar to g-complex
strains (amino acid positions 96 – 164). Z4,z24 is distinct
from z4,z23 and z4,z23 sequences varied within the serotype
at seven amino acid positions: 235, 237, 239, 242, 253,
351 and 369. The complex mosaic nature of fliC is evident
from analysis of amino acid alignment of sequences in
particular strains from subgroups in the SARC collection
(see Materials and Methods).
Molecular serotyping assays
By comparison of amino acid sequences coding for antigens of the different serotypes, sero-specific motifs were
identified. Individual regions of fliC were selected for the
g-group and non-g group to provide unique sequence for
as many serotypes as possible, while keeping the assay
simple to perform and analyse. Two multiplex PCRs were
developed for the production of fliC amplicon of g-complex strains and fliC amplicon of non-g strains. Sero-specific motifs in each amplicon were consequently
identified by sequencing-by-synthesis.
G-complex assay
Fifteen sequence types were identified in the 17 bp of
nucleotide sequence assayed (Figure 3). Twenty-seven
strains were tested and each produced a recognised
sequence motif which differentiated between serotypes.
Serotypes would be fully resolved through the detection
of further polymorphisms, for example g, [s],t and g,t can
be separated through additional detection of a A>G
change at nucleotide position 777 conferring amino acid
Ser>Gly substitution specific to g,t.
Non-g assay
Fourteen sequence types were identified in the 9 bp of
nucleotide sequence assayed (Figure 4). Thirty strains
were tested, each producing a recognised sequence motif
allowing separation of serotypes. Serotypes l,v and l,z13
gave the same motif at the target region but could be separated by nucleotide substitution A>G at position 783
conferring a Thr>Ala change.

The stability of the targeted polymorphisms in Salmonella
phase 1 flagellar antigens was demonstrated through testing on a panel of 55 isolates. The SNP responsible for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/31

antigenic difference between serotypes g,m and g,p was
within the target region and so could be differentiated by
the assay. The amino acid substitution that separated fliCg,p,u was also encoded within the sequence assayed. Antigens i, r, c, d, b, e,h, k, a, z41, z, z10, z4,z23, z4z24, g,q, g,m,p,
g,p,u, [f],g,t, g,z51 and biotype S. Pullorum gave unique
motifs, l,v and l,z13 shared a motif. Some serotypes for
which certain factors may be present or absent (denoted
by square brackets in antigenic formulae) were not separated from similar serotypes: [f],g,m, [p], g,m and g,m,
[p],s; [f],g,m, [p] and g,m, [t]; g, [s],t and g,t although
these could be separated by other DNA polymorphisms as
discussed. Two motifs were observed for k, each specific to
S. Thompson and IIIb. Two motifs were observed for d,
specific to S. Duisberg and S. Muenchen / S. Schwarzengrund. Published sequence data for fliC-m,t, from serotypes
S. Banana, S. Oranienburg and S. Pensacola were included
in assay design. The polymorphic region targeted by the
assay is predicted to differentiate m,t sequences from
other g-complex antigens, and also differentiate S. Pensacola from S. Banana and S. Oranienberg. Strains exhibiting factors m,t were not available for testing.

Conclusions
A high level of sequence homology between fliC genes of
g-complex strains was observed. Data produced for this
study is congruent with a previous report of g-complex
sequences [16]. The genetic basis between distinct antigens in this group of sequences can be a single amino acid
substitution. Specific motifs could be identified as the
genetic basis for particular antigenic differences and hence
their involvement in epitope formation and stability
among strains inferred.
Full gene sequences were distinct for each antigen analysed in this study. Furthermore, analysis of multiple representatives revealed that some antigens were encoded for
by multiple sequences. In these cases DNA sequence
based methods are more discriminatory than traditional
serotyping methods which do not recognise these as distinct antigens.
Assays were designed such that an unknown strain could
be identified in respect of its phase 1 flagellar antigen in
two steps. The specific PCR acted as the first level of identification and the resultant amplicon was used for the
pyrosequencing assay. A positive PCR indicated which of
two Pyrosequencing assays to apply. Each assay was uniform in that only one mix of pyrosequencing primers and
one dispensation order was needed. All the strains tested
were successfully amplified by PCR. As some analyses
have been performed on unpublished data, exhaustive
testing of the assay will be performed to confirm specificity and typeability of all recognised serotypes.

Molecular serotyping will incorporate the desirable properties of serology (typeability, reproducibility, epidemiological significance) together with the advantages of DNA
analysis (ability to automate, labour saving, serum
independent). Antisera production and associated quality
control measures would be unnecessary for a DNA
sequence based method. Time-consuming flagellar phase
reversal to identify both flagellar antigens is not necessary
at the genetic level. Other advantages include reduced
labour costs, rapid results in comparison to traditional
serotyping methods. DNA sequence data is highly portable and easy to interpret. The method described was easily
automated by use of the vacuum preparation tool for the
DNA strand separation step and could be further automated by use of robotics for PCR set-up. Result output
included a pyrogram, raw text and confidence level; automation of data analysis could be achieved by use of a computer script to screen at a set confidence level and crosscheck results against a database of recognised motifs.
With the capability to identify approximately 97% of
phase 1 flagellar antigens from medically important Salmonella strains occurring in England and Wales, the assay
can be used now as an economic screen of unknown isolates and alleviate the burden on routine serotyping work.
A scheme including the phase 1 flagellar assay and complementary assays for phase 2 flagellar and polysaccharide
antigens is currently being piloted and based on incidence
data of the top 50 serotypes from 2003, it is anticipated
that the scheme will provide a complete molecular serotype for around 80% of isolates and confident prediction
of 76% of the remainder.
Future work
Alternative sero-specific polymorphisms identified in this
study could be exploited by similar assays to allow further
separation when antigens did not give unique pyrograms.

The alliance of the fliC assay to a fljB and rfb assay would
allow the full antigenic formulae of Salmonella serotypes
to be determined. Common phase 2 flagellar antigens will
be selected for sequencing and together with published
data will be analysed for sero-specific motifs and a short
sequence assay designed with the approach described in
this study.
In 1993, Luk et al [8] outlined a simple length heterogeneity PCR for identification of Salmonella major serogroups
A, B, C2, and D. They based their PCR on the presence/
absence of genes or sequence polymorphisms within
shared genes. Essentially, only serogroups A and D possess a gene to synthesise tyvelose but serogroup A genes
carry an early stop codon and do not produce the sugar
itself. Only groups B and C2 possess a gene to synthesise
abequose but the sequences are distinct. We have also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/31

designed a preliminary pyrosequencing assay to distinguish these serogroups based on amplification and short
sequences of these genes (data not shown).
In summary, epitopes are conformational and it is difficult to determine which amino acids would interact from
a linear sequence. However, in the g-complex sequences
some amino acid changes could be identified as responsible for differences in antigenic factors because variation
was minimal. There is no common factor among the nong antigens and the sequences are much more heterogenous; there are too many substitutions to draw conclusions about epitope specific sequences. Epitope mapping
could be used to further investigate epitopes responsible
for antigenic specificity.

Methods
Bacterial strains
Strains exhibiting the different phase 1 flagellar antigenic
factors were selected from Salmonella Reference Collections A, B and C obtained from the University of Calgary.
Multiple isolates of S. Enteritidis phage type 4, and S.
Typhimurium phage type DT104 plus a panel of serotyped strains were gratefully received from the Salmonella
Reference Laboratory, Health Protection Agency, Colindale (Additional file 2).
DNA preparation, PCR and sequencing
MagNA Pure instrument and Total Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit 1 (Roche, East Sussex). PCR reactions contained
1X PCR buffer, 20 pmoles of FL_START2, 20 pmoles rFSa1
[21], 1 U Taq polymerase, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 4 mM
MgCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset).

PCR amplification of the fliC gene was performed with an
9700 GeneAmp PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire): 35 cycles of 95°C for 60 sec, 50°C for 60 sec, 72°C
for 30 sec followed by a 7 min final extension at 72°C.
PCR products were purified with Qiaquick spin columns
(Qiagen Ltd, West Sussex) and quantitated by gel electrophoresis using Ready-to-Run pre-cast gels (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire). Fifty to one-hundred
nanograms of the purified PCR product was used for cycle
sequencing, with specific primers (Additional file 3) and
the CEQ DTCS dye terminator kit (Beckman Coulter,
Buckinghamshire). Excess dNTPs were removed from
sequencing reactions using GenClean, a 96-well plate format gel filtration system (Genetix Ltd, Hampshire).
Sequencing reactions were run on a CEQ 8000XL capillary
sequencer (Beckman Coulter). Primers were designed on
generated sequence aided by Eprimer3 [22] in a primer
walking approach to complete sequencing of the full
gene. Sequences generated have been submitted to GenBank (Accession numbers AY649696-AY6497242).

Sequence analysis
Data were analysed and assembled using SeqMan, a component of the DNA Star software package. Multiple
alignments were created using BioEdit (Tom Hall, North
Carolina State University).

Phylogeny inference package Phylip (Joe Felsenstein, University of Washington) was used to compute a distance
matrix from protein sequences and build trees illustrating
the relatedness of fliC sequences. Some previously published sequences were included (Additional file 3). Polymorphisms postulated to be serotype specific were
identified from the alignments of full fliC sequences; inhouse programme MOP-UPs [23] identified motifs and
designed primers to user-specified groups of sequences in
the alignment (Anthony Underwood, Health Protection
Agency, London).
Assay design
Two multiplex PCRs were designed to amplify polymorphic regions of both g- and non-g complex fliC sequences.
Amplicon sizes were approximately 316 bp for g-complex
strains, 170 bp – 250 bp, (size varied according to serotype) from non-g strains. The order of nucleotide dispensation was tailored to enable the first two dispensations to
act as negative and positive controls.
DNA preparation and Pyrosequencing
A 1 µl loop of cells was boiled in 100 µl of sterile distilled
water for 10 min at 95°C. One microlitre of lysate was
used for PCR. Two PCRs were run in parallel to amplify
fragments of the fliC gene. Fifty microlitres of PCR product was prepared containing 1 U Taq polymerase, 0.25
mM of each dNTP, 4 mM MgCl2. PCR for amplification of
g-complex strains used three forward primers: 100 pmol
GPYRO-A; 12.5 pmol GPYRO-B; and 12.5 pmol GPYROC; and 125 picomoles of reverse biotinylated primer GREV. PCR for amplification of non-g strains used 14
forward primers (NON-G-PYRO-A, NON-G-PYRO-B etc.)
in equal concentrations. Thirteen biotinylated reverse
primers (NON-G-REV-A, NON-G-REV-B etc.) were used
in equal concentrations. In each 50 µl reaction 125 pmol
of mixed forward primer and 125 pmol mixed reverse
primer was used. Primer sequences are detailed in Additional file 3.

Thermocycling was performed with an Applied Biosystems 9700 GeneAmp PCR System using a touch-down
programme: initial denaturation step of 94°C for 2 min;
followed by 17 cycles of 94°C for 20 sec, 66°C (-1°C per
cycle) for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec; followed by 20 cycles of
94°C for 20 sec, 54°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec. The
excess primers were removed using a filter plate and vacuum system (Genetix Ltd, Hampshire) before visualising
the PCR products on the Ready-To-Run agarose system (as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/31

previously). Biotinylated single-stranded DNA was immobilized on streptavidin-coated sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire) with binding buffer.
The mixture was agitated at 1400 rpm for 10 min at room
temperature. Single stranded DNA bound to beads was
isolated from the mixture using a series of wash steps for
5 seconds each in turn, 70% ethanol, 0.2M NaOH and
washing buffer. Ninety-six samples were prepared in 2
minutes by automation of strand separation step using a
vacuum preparation tool (Pyrosequencing AB, Uppsala,
Sweden). A combination of pyrosequencing primers was
used for each assay; 20 primers for the non-g complex
assay, and three for the g-complex assay (Additional file 3)
into which DNA was eluted. Pyrosequencing primers were
annealed to single-stranded DNA on the beads by heating
to 80°C for 2 minutes and allowed to cool slowly. Single
stranded binding protein, enzyme mix, substrate mix and
dNTPs (Pyrosequencing) were added sequentially by the
instrument according to the programmed dispensation
order.
