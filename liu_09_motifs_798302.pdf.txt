<p>An integrative strategy of comparative presynaptic neurons.</p>
Presynapticneuronal-specific expression ingenomics, experimental and computational approaches reveals aspects of a regulatory network

Abstract
Background: Hundreds of proteins modulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity
during neuronal development and in response to synaptic activity. The expression of genes in the
pre- and post-synaptic neurons is under stringent spatio-temporal control, but the mechanism
underlying the neuronal expression of these genes remains largely unknown.
Results: Using unbiased in vivo and in vitro screens, we characterized the cis elements regulating the
Rab3A gene, which is expressed abundantly in presynaptic neurons. A set of identified regulatory
elements of the Rab3A gene corresponded to the defined Rab3A multi-species conserved elements.
In order to identify clusters of enriched transcription factor binding sites, for example, cisregulatory modules, we analyzed intergenic multi-species conserved elements in the vicinity of nine
presynaptic genes, including Rab3A, that are highly and specifically expressed in brain regions.
Sixteen transcription factor binding motifs were over-represented in these multi-species conserved
elements. Based on a combined occurrence for these enriched motifs, multi-species conserved
elements in the vicinity of 107 previously identified presynaptic genes were scored and ranked. We
then experimentally validated the scoring strategy by showing that 12 of 16 (75%) high-scoring
multi-species conserved elements functioned as neuronal enhancers in a cell-based assay.
Conclusions: This work introduces an integrative strategy of comparative genomics,
experimental, and computational approaches to reveal aspects of a regulatory network controlling
neuronal-specific expression of genes in presynaptic neurons.

Background

Synaptic transmission, the crucial process that enables information transfer in the nervous system, is a series of events in
which neurotransmitters are released via exocytosis from
presynaptic neurons and taken up by postsynaptic neurons.
In presynaptic neurons, synaptic vesicles facilitate uptake of
neurotransmitters and dock at the active zone of the plasma
membrane. In response to calcium signaling, vesicles rapidly

fuse with the plasma membrane and release neurotransmitters by exocytosis. The vesicles are recycled by subsequent
endocytosis. These events are orchestrated by multiple protein complexes [1,2]. For example, one class of proteins is
attached to the synaptic vesicle membrane, and is involved in
calcium sensing (SYT1 and SV2a), membrane fusion
(VAMP1), and vesicle recycling (SCAMP5). Another group of
proteins is bound with scaffold proteins or directly anchored

at the active zone and functions in vesicle docking (SYN1 and
RIMs), priming (RIMs) and fusion (SNAP25 and STXBP1). In
addition to these proteins, RAB3 proteins (RAB3A and
RAB3C) function as molecular linkers between synaptic vesicles and the active zone by cycling between vesicle-associated
and dissociated forms and interacting with multiple effectors,
such as RIMs and SYN1 [3-5].
To ensure precisely controlled synaptic communication,
members of protein complexes in presynaptic neurons have
highly coordinated expression and protein localization [6-9].
Spatial and temporal expression patterns of several presynaptic genes have been reported in detail. For instance, in
mammalian brain, Rab3A is expressed throughout all brain
regions, including cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and thalamus [10,11]. In the mouse, detectable levels of Rab3A, Syp
and Sv2a mRNAs are reported from embryonic day 9.5 or
10.5, an early neurogenesis stage in which progenitors gradually undergo cell cycle withdrawal and neuronal differentiation [12-14]. During neuronal maturation and synapse
formation, Rab3A expression dramatically increases and the
protein becomes localized to the presynaptic terminal of neurons [15,16]. In contrast to the increased expression during
neuronal development, neurodegenerative and psychiatric
disorders such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease and
schizophrenia are marked by decreased levels of RAB3A,
SYT1, and SNAP25, coupled with the loss of functional synapses [17-19]. It is clear that both gene expression and protein
distribution in presynaptic neurons are tightly regulated during neuronal development, differentiation and maintenance.
However, cis-regulatory mechanisms mediating the neuronal
expression of presynaptic genes still remain unknown.
Comparative genomics has taken advantage of the increasing
number of whole genome sequences available for many
model organisms in order to identify unknown regulatory elements [20-26]. For example, 353 of 868 multi-species conserved elements (MCEs) examined by in vivo enhancer assay
using mouse transgenesis were associated with tissue-specific
expression of the reporter gene [27,28]. Furthermore, investigations of the promoter regions of co-expressed genes have
led to discovery of significant clusters of transcription factor
binding sites, that is, cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) [29-33].
Although these common CRMs are statistically over-represented in regulatory elements of co-expressed genes, their
arrangement and activity may vary greatly [34-36]. Therefore, co-expressed genes defined from large-scale expression
studies provide excellent means to study common tissue-specific regulatory modules.
To elucidate the common CRMs regulating neuronal-specific
expression of presynaptic genes, we first defined a cluster of
nine presynaptic genes that were highly and specifically
expressed in neuronal tissues. Unbiased in vivo and in vitro
screens of cis-regulatory sites for Rab3A, one of the nine
genes, revealed regulatory roles for all MCEs in the vicinity of

this gene. We thus identified motifs of 16 transcription factors
that were enriched in intergenic MCEs of the nine presynaptic
genes in comparison to ubiquitously expressed genes. Identified CRMs were then used to develop a novel metric to rank
MCEs according to their potential for mediating neuronalspecific expression. By experimentally validating the highscoring as well as the low-scoring MCEs, we confirmed that
this CRM-based scoring metric accurately identified neuronal-specific regulatory elements.

Results
Gene selection for neuronal-restricted expression
In our previous work, we performed comparative sequence
analysis of presynaptic genes encoding proteins mainly
present in the presynaptic nerve terminal [37]. To select
genes with neuronal-restricted expression, we used SymAtlas
to examine the expression profiles of these genes obtained by
microarray analysis in 54 mouse non-redundant tissues and
at 7 developmental stages [38]. Expression profiles for 107
presynaptic genes, represented by 161 oligonucleotide gene
probes with a consistent expression pattern, were available. A
hierarchical k-means clustering of the 107 gene expression
patterns revealed three distinct groups (Figure 1; Table S1 in
Additional data file 1): nine genes, including Rab3A, Rab3C,
Scamp5, Snap25, Stxbp1, Syn1, Sv2a, Camk2N1 and Dnm1,
are tightly clustered with the most abundant expression
restricted to brain tissues (cluster 1, Figure 1a, Table 1); 27
genes are grouped with moderate neuronal expression (cluster 2, Figure 1b); and 71 genes are expressed in all tested tissues with an ubiquitous or nonspecific pattern (cluster 3,
Figure 1c).
Given that genes in cluster 1 were highly similar in their
expression pattern, we asked whether they share potential
cis-regulatory elements critical for neuronal-specific expression. Our strategy involved a systematic mapping of cis-regulatory elements for one gene (Rab3A), and then using these
data as a guide to characterize the regulatory elements for
other genes. Rab3A is well-suited for this case study for several reasons. First, the exclusive neuronal expression of
Rab3A is conserved among mammalian species (mouse, rat
and human), suggesting that common regulatory mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved. Second, Rab3A is a
small gene spanning a 3 kb genomic region with a 4.3 kb
upstream intergenic region. This short genomic interval
allows a systematic analysis of the entire region for functional
regulatory elements. We followed a two-pronged approach to
precisely characterize regulatory elements for the Rab3A
gene: an assessment of multiple-species conserved elements
(MCEs) and an unbiased screen for functional elements with
a series of deletions.

Identification of a genomic region sufficient for Rab3A
neuronal-specific expression
The Rab3A gene resides in one of the most gene-rich regions
on mouse chromosome 8 between Pd4c and BC051227 (Figure 2a). Two Rab3A transcripts were found in the GeneBank
mRNA database: a longer transcript containing a 374 bp 5'
untranslated region (UTR) adjacent to the first exon, defined
as the RefSeq transcript (build 37 assembly by NCBI); a
shorter transcript containing a 156 bp 5' UTR 1,000 bp
upstream of the first exon, reported in genome-wide transcriptome analysis [39] (Figure 2b). To validate these two
transcripts, we examined the presence of the two distinct
Rab3A mRNA in mouse brain by RT-PCR and quantitative
PCR. Both transcripts were detected in mouse cortex at 12.5
days post coitum (dpc), 14.5 dpc, 17.5 dpc, postnatal day 1,
postnatal day 7 and 6 months stages (Figure 2c). Quantitative
analysis showed that the short transcript was the predominant form (Figure 2d). Although the RefSeq transcript corresponds to the long transcript, this mRNA was expressed at
low level in all tested stages (Figure 2; Figure S1 in Additional
data file 2).
Based on this refined gene annotation, we initiated characterization of Rab3A regulatory elements by examining conserved elements in non-coding regions of the Rab3A locus.
We compared the sequence of murine Rab3A to sequences of
17 vertebrate species using the UCSC genome browser [40].
The conservation profile revealed only five distinct MCEs in
non-coding regions: MCE1 (-1,394, -1,216), MCE2 (-305, 137), MCE3 (-69, -2), MCE4 (+281, +500) and MCE5 (+3,381,
+3,881), ranging from 76 to 82% nucleotide sequence identity
between mammalian species (Figure 3a).
To examine if the 5.5 kb chromosome interval encompassing
five MCEs around Rab3A was sufficient to give rise to neuronal expression of Rab3A, we tested this region by transient
transgenesis using a modified bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) clone. Specifically, the enhanced green fluorescent

protein (EGFP) reporter gene replaced the first exon of
Rab3A in a BAC clone (RP433N2) as described by [41]. The
modified BAC clone was then truncated into two reporter
constructs containing either a 15 kb genomic region (7 kb
upstream and 5 kb downstream regions) or a 5.5 kb genomic
region with all predicted MCEs (2.4 kb upstream and 100 bp
downstream) (Figure 2b). Transgenic embryos were generated with each construct and assessed for EGFP expression at
14.5 dpc by histochemistry in three transgenic lines. Embryos
carrying either the 5.5 kb or 15 kb genomic construct showed
EGFP expression restricted to neural tissues, similar to that of
endogenous Rab3A at the same stage (Figure 2c-e). The
stronger signal in embryos carrying the 15 kb construct was
likely due to high copy numbers of the EGFP reporter (data
not shown). Based on the consistent neuronal expression of
EGFP reporter, we concluded that the 5.5 kb region covering
Rab3A coding sequence and five MCEs contained necessary
cis-regulatory elements responsible for neuronal expression
of Rab3A.

Characterization of cis-regulatory elements in Rab3A
locus by two strategies
In vivo transgenic experiments identified a 5.5 kb genomic
region containing cis-regulatory elements responsible for
neuronal expression of Rab3A at 14.5 dpc. To characterize
regulatory elements, it was necessary to first define the
Rab3A promoter region. Luciferase vector pGL, which contains the Luciferase coding sequence without a promoter, was
used to identify the Rab3A promoter region. We generated a
series of deletions in the 1.5 kb upstream region of Rab3A and
fused them with pGL vector. These constructs were transfected into three cell lines: Neuro2a (mouse neuroblastoma),
HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) and Hela (human adenocarcinoma) to assess their ability to drive Luciferase
expression (Figure 4b, c). The MCE3 region in pGL-8 initiated Luciferase expression in all three cell lines, whereas
deletion of this region in pGL-19 completely disrupted Luciferase activity even with intact upstream enhancers. There-

between LT and total RNA is presented as red bars. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean of four replicates used for each stage.

fore, the MCE3 region was defined as the Rab3A promoter
region.
The remaining Rab3A MCEs were then examined for their
ability to drive Luciferase expression under the control of the
Rab3A promoter (MCE3) in three cell lines (Table 2). Two
MCEs, MCE1 and MCE2, greatly enhance Luciferase activity
in the Neuro2a cell line but not in HEK293 and Hela cells,

supporting their roles as independent enhancers in a neuronal cell type specific manner (Figure 4d, e). A similar induction by MCE1 and MCE2 were also observed under the control
of the SV40 promoter, ruling out the possibility that the
Rab3A promoter itself contributed to the neuronal expression (Figure 4f, g). In contrast, the intronic MCE4 and the
MCE5 in the 3' UTR led to decreased Luciferase activity in all
tested cell lines, regardless of the promoter used (Figure 4h-

Summary of Rab3A multi-species conserved element (MCE) effects on
Luciferase expression in Neuron2a, HEK293 and Hela cell lines. Rab3A
MCE1, 2, 4 and 5 were examined individually by fusing into the
Luciferase construct harboring either the Rab3A gene promoter
(MCE3) or the SV40 promoter. Three cell lines were used: Neuro2a
(mouse neuroblastoma), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) and Hela
(human adenocarcinoma). MCE1 and MCE2 robustly enhanced
Luciferase activity in the Neuro2a cell line but not at a comparable level
in HEK293 and Hela cells under the control of either the MCE3 or
SV40 promoter. MCE4 repressed Luciferase activity in all three cell
lines, even under control of the SV40 enhancer. MCE4 also showed a
strong positional effect, in which a position upstream of the MCE3
promoter failed to reduce Luciferase expression. MCE5 led to a
decrease of Luciferase activity under the SV40 promoter and SV40
enhancer. However, when MCE1 and MCE2 induced Luciferase activity
in Neuro2a cells, MCE5 did not have an effect on Luciferase activity. +,

k). Additional experiments will be needed to accurately define
the role of these negative elements on Rab3A gene regulation;
they may regulate transcription as repressors, or affect transcript stability, splicing or translational efficiency.
To complement the analysis of individual MCEs, we performed an unbiased screen of the 5.5 kb region for any potential cis-regulatory elements by Luciferase assay. Fine
mapping of the entire 1.5 kb upstream region and the first
intron was performed using a series of deletion constructs
(Figure S2 in Additional data file 2). Closer inspection by
additional Luciferase deletion constructs refined the core
promoter region to a 64 bp region upstream of the Rab3A 5'
UTR (Figure S3 in Additional data file 2). Although two
enhancer elements (Es) were mapped to E1 (-1,435, -1261)
and E2 (-345, -123) regions, existence of repressor(s) (in the
region between -802 and -346) cannot be excluded (Figure S4
in Additional data file 2). In addition, elements that reduce
Luciferase activity (Ns) were found in the first intron, N1
(+240, +425) and N2 (+410, +556), and the Rab3A 3' UTR
(+3,362, +3,860) (Figures S5 and S6 in Additional data file
2). Strikingly, all experimentally identified regulatory elements correspond to MCEs. MCE1 (-1,394, -1,216) and MCE2

(-305, -137) closely correlated with the two enhancers, while
MCE4 (+281, +500) covered the N1 region and overlapped
with the N2 region. Thus, in the case of the Rab3A locus,
MCEs in intergenic regions are good indicators of critical tissue-specific cis-regulatory elements.
Next we computationally searched for putative transcription
factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the 2.8 kb genomic region
(starting from1.5 kb upstream to the end of the first intron of
Rab3A) using the PWM_SCAN tool [42] and the 546 positional weight matrices (PWMs) corresponding to vertebrate
transcription factors in TRANSFAC version 8.4 [43]. Based
on a P-value threshold of 0.0002, we predicted 77 and 23
binding sites in MCE1 and MCE2, respectively. These
included well-known neuronal transcription factors NGF1-C,
CREB, and EBF1/Olf-1 (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). In
addition, MCE4 contained sites for transcription factors
REST/NRSF (P-value = 0.0001), which might contribute to
MCE4's repressor effect.
A group of binding sites located within a regulatory region
may represent a CRM [44]. Therefore, we examined other
genes that harbor the same CRM in their upstream regions for
a similar expression pattern to that of the Rab3A gene. We
searched 5 kb upstream regions of approximately 17,000
mouse RefSeq genes (version mm8) for the presence of the
same set of binding sites as in Rab3A MCEs within a 500 bp
window (see Materials and methods). This analysis identified
42 putative gene targets based on the Rab3A MCE1 CRM
(Table S3 in Additional data file 1) and 13 gene targets based
on the MCE2 CRM (data not shown). Next, we tested whether
these 42 genes were expressed at significantly high levels in
any of the mouse tissues for which genome-wide expression
data are available. Based on the genome-wide gene expression profiles for 54 mouse tissues and 7 developmental stages
(available in SymAtlas), we tested for each tissue, using the
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test (see Materials and
methods), whether these 42 putative targets of the MCE1
CRM had a greater expression compared to all other genes.
Overall, we found that these 42 genes had higher expression
levels in 18 tissues with a P-value â¤ 0.05, of which 10 tissues
were neural tissues such as cerebral cortex, preoptic area and
substantia nigra. However, the 13 genes containing MCE2's
CRM failed to show significant up-regulation in any of the
mouse tissues tested. Our data suggest that at least a subset of
CRMs, that is, for Rab3A MCE1, might be associated with a
specific expression pattern.

Identification of common motifs mediating neuronalspecific expression of the nine presynaptic genes
Next we hypothesized that co-expression of the nine presynaptic genes (Rab3A, Rab3C, Scamp5, Snap25, Stxbp1, Syn1,
SV2a, Camk2N1 and DNM1) may be mediated via common
CRMs. We have previously identified and characterized
MCEs of 107 presynaptic genes [37]. Assuming that MCEs
could serve as a reliable guide in the search for putative neu-

ronal-specific CRMs, we searched for DNA-binding motifs
enriched in the upstream MCEs near the nine genes with
strong neuronal expression (cluster 1, Figure 1a) relative to
the upstream MCEs near genes with nonspecific expression
pattern (cluster 3, Figure 1c). This analysis revealed 16 PWMs
enriched in cluster 1 genes' MCEs with a P-value â¤ 0.05 (Table
3); we also ensured that these predictions had low false discovery rates (FDRs; < 2.8%). These 16 motifs are among the
TFBSs predicted in Rab3A MCE1 and MCE2, including binding sites for the well-known neuronal transcription factors
REST/NRSF, CREB and NGF1c. Therefore, we asked if the
presence of these sequence motifs is a likely determinant of
neuronal-specific gene expression.
Using the set of 16 transcription factor motifs over-represented in the cluster 1 genes' MCEs, we searched for 'neuronal-regulatory potential' in 3,347 intergenic MCEs
corresponding to the 107 presynaptic genes (Figure 5). Specifically, we introduced a scoring function that scores each MCE
as a sum of the likelihood-ratio of enrichment for each of the
16 motifs if they are present in the MCE. We ranked 3,347
MCEs by their scores representing the MCE's potential for
regulating neuronal-specific expression in the range 0, for
non-specific, to approximately 1,000, for the most neuronalspecific element. As expected, MCEs in cluster 1 have a
greater score relative to those in cluster 2 (Wilcoxon rank sum
P-value = 0.0015) and cluster 3 (Wilcoxon rank sum P-value
= 2.2e-05) (Figure S7 in Additional data file 2). The differences remain significant even after we group all MCEs corresponding to a specific gene and use their median score as the
summary statistic for the gene (both P-values â¤ 0.006). We

note that while the above analysis is not meant to be an independent validation of our MCE ranking procedure, it does
suggest that specific combinations of transcription factor
motifs are enriched in MCEs in the vicinity of cluster 1 genes.
Using this scoring strategy, we selected candidates of neuronal-specific enhancers from a pool of 3,347 intergenic MCEs
for experimental validation. Apart from already tested Rab3A
elements (MCE1 and MCE2), we selected 14 high-scoring
MCEs (ranging from 1,006 to 90.5) for 12 genes (Table 4; see
Materials and methods). Of the fourteen MCEs, eleven belong
to cluster 1, two belong to cluster 2, and three belong to cluster 3 genes. In addition, as a negative control, for ten selected
genes a low scoring MCE (score = 0) was also randomly chosen, matched with the high score MCE with regard to length
and distance to target gene. We assessed the regulatory role of
24 MCEs (14 high scoring and 10 low scoring MCEs) in the
Luciferase promoter assays, in which the Luciferase vector
contained a SV40 promoter fused with the coding sequence of
the firefly Luciferase gene. Tested cell lines included Neuro2a
(mouse neuroblastoma cell), MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblast cell), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell 293) and
Hela (human adenocarcinoma cell). Overall, including the
two Rab3A MCEs (MCE1 and MCE2), we observed robust
enhancer activities driven by 75% (12 of 16) of the high-scoring MCEs and in 30% (3 of 10) of the low-scoring MCEs in
Neuro2a cells; none of the tested MCEs increased Luciferase
expression in MEF, HEK293 and Hela cells except
CAMK2G.23, which slightly induced Luciferase expression in
Hela cells (Figure 6). Therefore, a majority (12 MCEs; 75%) of
predicted neuronal enhancers revealed a regulatory role in

the neuronal cell type. More specifically, of the total 26 MCEs
tested, 12 were true positives, 4 were false positives, 7 were
true negatives and 3 were false negatives (Table 4). This yields
a nominal sensitivity of 12/15 = 80% and a nominal specificity
of 7/11 = 63%. Our results, although based on a small testing
set, indicate that this scoring strategy based on expression
similarity and motif-enrichment provides a powerful tool for
the identification of enhancers in a particular tissue of interest, in our case, neuronal tissue/cell type.

Discussion

Deciphering the cis-regulatory code for tissue-specific and
developmental-stage-specific gene expression remains a significant challenge [44-48]. In this study we have focused on
identifying common CRMs mediating neuronal expression,
using a combined computational and experimental approach.
In order to achieve biological specificity, we have restricted
our investigation to neuronal-specific genes of a specific function, namely, presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Using a

Functional validation of 14 high scoring MCEs and 10 low scoring MCEs listed in Table 3. Luciferase constructs were generated by inserting
each MCE into the Luciferase promoter vector (pGL3p), which contains a SV40 promoter and Luciferase coding sequence. (a-d) The corresponding
Luciferase activity was examined in one neuronal cell line, Neuro2a cells (a), and three non-neuronal cell lines, Hela cells (b), HEK293 cells (c) and MEF cells
(d). Each construct was tested in triplicate in each set of experiments. Every experiment of all 24 constructs was repeated at least three times. Each
Luciferase construct was co-transfected with the Renilla pRLCMV vector for normalization. MCEs that significantly induced Luciferase activity are highlighted
with an asterisk (P < 0.05, Student's t-test). The error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean of triplicates used for each construct.

The list of 16 high scoring multi-species conserved elements (MCEs) and 10 low scoring MCEs for experimental validation (see Materials and method
for selection detail). *Genomic regions upstream of CAMK2N1, SYN1 and Rab3A genes do not contain low-scoring MCEs. One of the high-scoring
MCEs (STX18.12) failed to be cloned. A Luciferase assay in the Neuro2a cell line identified neuronal enhancers in 12 high-scoring MCEs and 3 lowscoring MCEs marked in bold (Student's t-test, P < 0.05).

combination of TFBSs in conserved elements in nine genes
with an abundant and restricted expression in neuronal tissues, we developed a combined computational-experimental
strategy for the evaluation of the 'neuronal regulatory potential' of MCEs.
Several slightly different approaches to identify CRMs mediating tissue-specific gene expression have been previously
proposed [44-48]. Our approach differs from these in a few
important ways. For instance, some of the other approaches
employed genome-wide selection of co-expressed genes
solely based on microarray expression profiles. This may
recruit many genes that may belong to diverse pathways,
therefore reducing the signal-to-noise ratio in subsequent
analysis [49]. In contrast, we restricted our analysis to 150
genes known to be involved in synaptic transmission in presynaptic neurons; we further divided them into distinct
expression clusters based on neuronal-related and non-neuronal-related tissue types. Nine presynaptic genes were found
to have a striking neuronal-specific pattern that is likely coregulated by common CRMs, whereas 72 genes with widespread and/or low levels of expression served as an internal
control.
A major challenge in the identification of TFBSs is that the
binding motifs are usually short and degenerate and thus
result in high false positive rates [32]. However, it has been
shown that functional binding sites tend to be clustered [45].

Thus, by first identifying enriched motifs in the MCEs near
the nine neuronal-specific genes, and by focusing on clustered occurrences of these motifs, we could reduce the rate of
false positives. Seventy-two presynaptic genes with non-specific expression served as negative controls, further enhancing the specificity of CRM identification.
Another challenging issue with many previous computational
studies is the arbitrary selection of the proximal promoter
region to search for enriched motifs and determine CRMs
[44]. As previously shown, selection of evolutionarily conserved sequences from larger intergenic or intronic (MCE)
regions may represent an alternative approach [44]. Consistent with these previous findings, a detailed experimental
delineation of regulatory elements of Rab3A revealed a
remarkable correspondence between functional elements
and evolutionary conservation. However, it has been shown
that, in many cases, functional elements are known to reside
in non-conserved regions [50,51].
To capture the contributions of various enriched motifs comprising a CRM, we chose a likelihood-ratio-based scoring
metric specifically designed to assess the neuronal regulatory
potential of a MCE. Our scoring metric weights the presence
of a binding site based on its enrichment P-value, such that
more enriched (lower P-value) motifs are weighted higher.
This choice was based on the ability of the scoring metric to
discriminate MCEs in the vicinity of genes expressed highly

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/7/R72

Genome Biology 2009,

and specifically in neuronal cell types from MCEs near genes
that are broadly expressed. In this respect, our approach is
most similar to that taken in [44], where the authors estimated the weights based on an optimization procedure.
Besides the statistical analysis used to verify the specificity of
the MCE ranking procedure, we experimentally validated several high-scoring and low-scoring MCEs through a cell linebased Luciferase reporter assay. The comparison of neuronal
cell line and non-neuronal cells offered, to some extent, a clue
as to tissue/cell type specificity. Overall, based on 26 tested
MCEs, we were able to predict neuronal-specific expression
with roughly 75% sensitivity and 63% specificity. Although we
have provided a proof-of-principle, we expect that a scoring
metric trained on a larger set of validated neuronal-specific
genes would permit a genome-wide prediction of neuronal
enhancers.
From a methodological perspective, the strengths of our
study include: carefully selected co-expressed genes with a
related function (pathway); a two-pronged approach to determine cis-regulatory elements of one prominent gene - Rab3A;
reliance on MCEs regardless of their proximity to the gene;
pre-determination of enriched motifs to define the CRM; a
weighted scoring strategy to rank MCEs according to their
neuronal regulatory potential; and experimental validation of
a subset of both high-scoring and low-scoring MCEs for their
neuronal-specific enhancer properties. Certainly, despite
these advantages, we are also aware of several limitations.
First, our experimental validation is based on cell-culture
experiments. However, in vitro methods cannot fully recapitulate endogenous expression patterns. As described in Pennacchio et al. [27], an in vivo enhancer assay in transgenic
mouse embryos would be a more reliable and conclusive
method to evaluate our findings. Moreover, although our
scoring system is applicable to a genome-wide prediction of
neuronal-specific enhancers, we still need to assess this application on a large set of gene and genomic elements.
This study focuses on identification of cis-regulatory elements responsible for neuronal expression; however, cis elements only partly determine gene expression, which is
regulated by additional epigenetic factors such as nucleosome
positioning, DNA methylation and a number of histone modifications [52-54]. Such epigenetic marks play critical roles in
gene regulation in higher organisms. For instance, several
studies have revealed the critical role of nucleosomes in chromatin structure and remodeling and, ultimately, in gene regulation. Nucleosome occupancy can block access to
regulatory elements, thereby inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to specific DNA sequences. To assess the role
of nucleosome occupancy, using a previously published computational modeling approach and the software program provided by the authors [55], we predicted the nucleosome
occupancy probability for the 16 MCEs (including 50 bp
flanking sequences). In our study, four MCEs with high scores
for enrichment of neuronal-specific motifs did not show any

Volume 10, Issue 7, Article R72

Liu et al. R72.13

enhancement of Luciferase gene expression. We found that
relative to the 12 positive elements, the 4 negative elements
had significantly greater probability of being occupied by
nucleosomes (Mann-Whitney rank sum P-value = 0.04). This
finding suggests that nucleosome occupancy, in addition to
other levels of regulation, needs to be included in the evaluation of regulatory potential of genomic elements.
Conserved non-coding sequences are not only essential for
gene expression, but are also associated with phenotypic variability and human disorders. To date, increasing attention
has been focused on changes in cis-regulatory regions, such
as substitutions or deletions, that might contribute to species
uniqueness and human disorders [24,56,57]. Several cis-regulatory mutations are known to underlie diverse aspects of
behavior, physiology and disease susceptibility in human [5860]. For example, a non-coding single nucleotide polymorphism (RET+3) within a conserved enhancer element in the
first intron of RET, a receptor tyrosin kinase, has been
reported to be significantly associated with Hirschsprung disease featured by congenital aganglionosis with megacolon
[61-63]. Our study decoding cis-regulatory elements required
for neuronal gene expression could further facilitate investigation of genetic variations in functional regulatory elements,
thus greatly improving our knowledge of how regulatory
sequences are involved in human diseases.

Conclusions

We selected nine presynaptic genes that were most abundantly expressed in neural tissues and demonstrated, by in
vivo and in vitro screens, that MCEs upstream of one of these
genes, Rab3A, functioned as cis-regulatory elements. We
then identified 16 transcription factor binding motifs that
were enriched in intergenic MCEs in the vicinity of these nine
genes. We devised a computational scoring metric based on
the enriched motifs to assess an MCE's potential to function
as a neuronal-specific enhancer. This scoring metric was
shown to accurately detect neuronal-specific enhancers,
based on experimental validation of a number of predicted
MCEs using cell based assays. Thus, our study introduces a
comprehensive strategy for identification of neuronal specific
enhancers.

Materials and methods
Expression clustering of microarray profiles
Mouse expression profiles are available from the Genomics
Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation [38]; the data
used were based on the analysis across 54 mouse tissues and
7 developmental stages on Affymetrix microarrays [64]. Normalized and filtered expression files were analyzed using
TIGR Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV), a versatile microarray
data analysis tool that incorporates algorithms for clustering,
visualization, and statistical analysis [65,66]. We clustered
240 unique oligonucleotide probe sets that interrogated 126

different presynaptic genes into three distinct clusters. By
closer inspection, we excluded 52 probes that hybridized to
intergenic or intronic sequences. In addition, clustering of
expression data placed 19 genes into more than one cluster
and these genes were eliminated in the further analysis. As a
result, 107 genes corresponding to 161 probes were clustered
into 3 distinct expression groups by the hierarchical k-means
clustering method.

RT-PCR and quantitative PCR
Brain tissues or cultured cells were homogenized in Trizol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and total RNA was extracted
by the Trizol procedure and using an RNeasy mini prep kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). For RT-PCR, 2 Î¼g aliquots of
DNase-treated RNA were reverse-transcribed using a High
Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) as described by the manufacturer.
Reverse-transcribed products (2 to 4 ng) were used for PCR
and the products obtained after 26 or 32 PCR cycles with the
different primers were analyzed by agarose gel. Primer set F1/
R1 was designed to be specific for the shorter transcript of
Rab3A (ST), F2/R1 was designed to be specific for the longer
transcript of Rab3A (LT), and F3/R1 was targeted to common
sequences of both the ST and LT as total Rab3A mRNA. The
Î²-actin set was the control for RNA loading (Table S4 in Additional data file 1).
cDNA products (2 to 4 ng) were used for quantitative PCR
with a SYBR green PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). The primer
set ST-F/R was used to detect the ST, the primer set LT-F/R
to detect the LT, and the primer set E3-4-F/R to detect exons
3 and 4 of the total Rab3A mRNA. All samples were tested
simultaneously with two primer sets: the control primer set
(E3-4-F/R) and the test primer set (either ST-F/R or LT-F/
R). This allowed ST/LT expression levels to be normalized to
the total Rab3A level. All samples were tested in triplicate.
Relative quantification (quantitative PCR) was performed on
an ABI Prism 7900HT system and Ct values were analyzed by
SDS2.2 software (Applied Biosystems). The relative mRNA
quantity of ST and LT at each developmental stage was normalized to total Rab3A mRNA to obtain the relative ratio
according to the calculation method in the user manual.

Generation of EGFP reporter constructs
The EGFP reporter gene was introduced into BAC clone
RPCI-23 433N2 (CHORI, BAC/PAC Resources, Oakland, CA,
USA) by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli
according to the method of Gong et al. [41]. Two 500 bp
sequences (homology arms A and B) flanking mouse Rab3A
exon 1 were amplified by PCR (Table S4 in Additional data file
1) and cloned into the AscI and PacI restriction sites flanking
the EGFP coding sequence in the pLD53SCAEB shuttle vector. The modified vector was transformed into BAC host cell
DH10B by electroporation. After two-step homologous
recombination, the modified BACs were screened by PCR

Volume 10, Issue 7, Article R72

(Table S4 in Additional data file 1) to detect the two EGFP
junctions and confirmed by Southern blot. Specifically, DNA
was digested with EcoRI or HindIII, separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon
membrane. The blots were analyzed using the 'A box' or
'EGFP' as probe. Wild-type BAC DNA served as the negative
control and shuttle vector as the positive control.
The BAC-EGFP 15 kb construct was generated from the modified BAC clone. The modified BAC was digested with NotI
and SwaI (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
and separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The
15 kb fragments were enriched by gel extraction and cloned
into the NotI site of the pBSKS+ vector. Resultant colonies
were screened by the presence of EGFP gene (Table S4 in
Additional data file 1) and positive clones were confirmed by
DNA sequencing. The BAC-EGFP 5.5 kb construct was
directly amplified by PCR (Table S4 in Additional data file 1)
upon the modified BAC and then cloned into the EcoRV site
of the pBSKS+ vector. Resultant colonies were screened by
the presence of EGFP and positive clones were confirmed by
DNA sequencing. The two reporter constructs were linearized
by NotI and SalI and used to generate transgenic mouse lines.

Generation and genotyping of transgenic mice
By pronuclear microinjection, reporter constructs were
inserted into fertilized eggs derived from the intercross of the
(BL6xSJL) F1 mouse strain (Transgenic Core Facility, University of Pennsylvania). Transgenic embryos were collected
at 14.5 dpc. Tail snips of transgenic embryos were incubated
overnight in 700 Î¼l of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8; 10 mM
EDTA, pH 8; 0.1 M NaCl; 2% SDS) supplemented with 1 Î¼g/
Î¼l proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). DNA
was extracted using standard phenol-chloroform procedures,
precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 10 mM Tris/10
mM EDTA. PCR was performed to determine the presence of
the EGFP gene.

Immunohistochemistry of transgenic positive embryos
Transgenic embryos (three transgenic positives and three
negatives) at 14.5 dpc were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight at 4Â°C, dehydrated using graded alcohols and
embedded in paraffin. Five-micron sections were deposited
onto superfrost-coated slides and air dried. After heating at
65Â°C for 20 minutes, slides were deparaffinized in three
rounds of xylene. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked with incubation in 100% methanol with 1% H2O2 for
20 minutes at room temperature. Slides were rehydrated
using graded alcohol at room temperature and placed into a
humidifier. After slides were bathed with blocking buffer
(10% horse serum, 0.1% tween-20, dilute with 1Ã phosphatebuffered saline) for 30 minutes at room temperature, each
slide was then covered with the primary anti-GFP antibody
(15 Î¼g/ml; #11122, Invitrogen) and left overnight at 4Â°C. A
Biotin-Streptavidin Amplified kit (Biogenex Laboratories Inc,
San Ramon, CA, USA) was then used as follows. Incubation of

biotinylate secondary anti-rabbit antibody was followed by
application of streptavidin conjugated horse radish peroxidase labeled antibody. Each incubation lasted 30 minutes at
room temperature and phosphate-buffered saline was used as
wash. The DAB chromogen was applied for 5 minutes (color
reaction product: brown). The slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and covered by a coverslip. All images were visualized using conventional
microscopy.

Generation of Luciferase constructs
Rab3A-related Luciferase constructs were generated by
inserting the genomic sequence of the Rab3A locus into the
SmaI site of the Firefly Luciferase pGL3-basic vector (pGL
series), pGL3-promoter vector (pGLp series) or pGL3-control
vector (pGLc series) (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI,
USA). PCR was used to generate insertion fragments using
related primer sets listed in Table S4 in Additional data file 1.
MCE-related Luciferase constructs were generated by inserting each MCE into the SmaI site of the Firefly Luciferase
pGL3-promoter vector. MCEs were amplified by PCR using
related primer sets listed in Table S4 in Additional data file 1.
All Luciferase constructs were confirmed by sequencing.

Transient transfection and Luciferase assays
Cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown to 60% confluence in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM), 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamin, 1%
MEM Non-essential Amino Acid solution, 1% antibiotics;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were co-transfected with Firefly Luciferase constructs and Renilla Luciferase pRLCMV [pRLCMVrenilla] vector (Promega
Corportaion) using the liposome-mediated Fugene 6 Reagent
(Roche Applied Science,) at a DNA/lipid ratio of 2:1 in DMEM
medium without fetal bovine serum. On the day of the transfection, 3 Î¼g of Firefly Luciferase construct DNA and 0.06 Î¼g
of Renilla Luciferase vector were mixed with 6 Î¼l of Transfast
reagent and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes.
After incubation, plated cells were changed with fresh modified growth medium (DMEM, 1% fetal bovine serum, 1% Lglutamin, 1% MEM Non-essential Amino Acid solution, 1%
antibiotics; Sigma-Aldrich) and overlaid with DNA/Transfast
mixture. Cells were incubated for 48 hours and harvested
with 500 Î¼l of passive lysis buffer (Promega Corporation).
Luciferase activities were measured with 20 Î¼l of protein
extract solution using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corporation) and a Bio-Rad luminometer
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Each construct was tested in
triplicate in each set of experiments. The ratio between the
Firefly Luciferase and Renilla Luciferase was used as the relative Luciferase activity for each construct. Every experiment
for all 24 constructs was repeated at least three times. For
experimental validation of MCEs, we used Student's t-test to
calculate statistical significance, in which a P-value < 0.05
was considered to be significant.

Identification of target genes sharing the CRMs of the
Rab3A MCEs and their tissue-specific expression
Based on putative TFBSs in Rab3A MCE1, we first merged all
overlapping binding sites whose corresponding PWMs were
'similar'. For PWM-pair similarity we used a previously published metric based on relative entropy and applied a cutoff Pvalue of 0.02 [67]. Among all merged hits we retained the best
scoring binding site. This yielded seven PWMs for MCE1. We
then expanded each of the seven PWMs to include other
related PWMs, using the same operational definition of similarity as above; we thus had seven families of PWMs. Based on
genome-wide annotation of putative binding sites using our
previously described phylogenetic footprinting approach
[42], we searched for additional mouse transcripts that harbored at least one member of each of the seven PWM families
within a 500 bp window in their 5 kb upstream region. We
thus identified 42 transcripts. Using the same strategy, MCE2
also yielded 7 families of related PWMs and 13 gene targets
were identified by this CRM in the genome-wide search.
We downloaded the genome-wide expression profiles for 61
tissues from Novartis. We specifically obtained the GCRMA
(Guanine Cytosine Robust Multi-Array Analysis) processed
expression values. For each tissue, using the Wilcoxon rank
sum test, we tested the null hypothesis that the expression
levels of these gene targets were no greater than those of the
other genes in that tissue.

Identification of over-represented motifs in cluster 1
genes
The MCEs of presynaptic genes were defined by Hadley et al.
[37]. Using the computational tool phastCons [68], MCEs
were defined as the most conserved elements from genomewide alignments of the mouse genome with seven other vertebrate genomes, including human, chimpanzee, dog, rat,
chicken, zebra fish and puffer fish.
Using our PWM_SCAN tool and TRANSFAC PWMs as
described above, we identified the putative binding sites in all
MCEs upstream of the 107 presynaptic genes until the next
neighboring gene. For each motif, we compared the number
of occurrences in the MCEs corresponding to cluster 1 genes
relative to the MCEs corresponding to cluster 3 genes and
estimated the significance of enrichment using 1,000 random
permutations.
We then estimated the FDR for each P-value threshold based
on permutations. From the entire set of MCEs that was used
as a background control for the above enrichment analysis,
we randomly selected 158 MCEs (same number as the cluster
1 5' MCEs used for enrichment analysis) and estimated the
enrichment of 546 PWMs. Based on 100 randomizations, we
have, in effect, done 54,600 tests of enrichment. Since a priori we do not expect any meaningful enrichment in these randomly selected MCEs, the fraction of tests that qualify a

certain P-value threshold provide an estimate of the FDR for
that P-value.

Cis-regulatory module scoring metric
Given the 16 motifs enriched in cluster 1 MCEs, we hypothesized that the co-occurrence of some of these motifs in an
MCE may be indicative of the MCE's role as a neuronal-specific enhancer. However, we wished to weight motifs proportional to their enrichment score. For a motif with a Fisher
exact test P-value of p, we set its weight as (1 - p)/p, which can
be interpreted as the likelihood ratio of the probability of the
motif not occurring by chance to the probability of the motif
occurring by chance. Let p(x) be the P-value of motif x. Thus,
for an MCE having occurrences of motifs m1, m2, ..., mk, the
score is given by:

Selection of 16 MCEs for Luciferase assay
Approximately 3,347 upstream MCEs from 107 presynaptic
genes were ranked by scores. We selected the top 30 MCEs,
corresponding to 12 presynaptic genes. Among the 12 genes,
6 belong to cluster 1, 2 belong to cluster 2 and 4 belonged to
cluster 3. For each gene, normally one MCE with the highest
score was chose for evaluation. Two MCEs (one with the highest score and one with a lower score) were chosen only if the
gene was a cluster 1 gene and had several MCEs in the top 30.
To complete the cluster 1 gene list, a low score MCE (score =
96.13) of the Rab3C gene was also chosen. All selected MCEs
were carefully inspected with regard to their conservation,
relative position to neighboring genes and length. In addition,
as a negative control, for each selected gene a zero scoring
MCE was randomly chosen, matched to the high score MCEs
with regard to their length and distance to the target gene.
(Exceptions were CAMK2N1, SYN1 and Rab3A, which did not
have a zero scoring MCE, and one of the 17 high scoring MCEs
(STX18.12) failed to be cloned.) Experimental validation
using the Luciferase assay was as described above.
