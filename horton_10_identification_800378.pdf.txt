Abstract
Background: Laboratory studies have demonstrated that a variety of immune signaling pathways regulate malaria
parasite infection in Anopheles gambiae, the primary vector species in Africa.
Methods: To begin to understand the importance of these associations under natural conditions, an association
mapping approach was adopted to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in selected immune
signaling genes in A. gambiae collected in Mali were associated with the phenotype of Plasmodium falciparum
infection.
Results: Three SNPs were identified in field-collected mosquitoes that were associated with parasite infection in
molecular form-dependent patterns: two were detected in the Toll5B gene and one was detected in the gene
encoding insulin-like peptide 3 precursor. In addition, one infection-associated Toll5B SNP was in linkage disequilibrium
with a SNP in sequence encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase that has been associated with Toll signaling in
mammalian cells. Both Toll5B SNPs showed divergence from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting that selection
pressure(s) are acting on these loci.
Conclusions: Seven of these eight infection-associated and linked SNPs alter codon frequency or introduce nonsynonymous changes that would be predicted to alter protein structure and, hence, function, suggesting that these
SNPs could alter immune signaling and responsiveness to parasite infection.
Background
The causative agents of malaria are protozoan parasites of
the genus Plasmodium, which are transmitted to humans
by anopheline mosquitoes. The highest number of cases
occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, where the most deadly parasite Plasmodium falciparum is transmitted primarily by
Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. With over 500 million
new cases a year [1] and over half of the world's population at risk for malaria, increased understanding of the
complex factors governing transmission is a pressing
need.

Extensive genetic structuring among natural populations of A. gambiae is likely to have an impact on parasite
transmission. In particular, frequencies of paracentric
inversions on the right arm of the second chromosome
(2R) have revealed that many A. gambiae populations
deviate strongly from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. On
the basis of these findings, Mopti, Savanna, and Bamako
chromosomal forms were described [2]. Genetic differentiation among these chromosomal forms revealed the
presence of molecular forms characterized by fixed
nucleotide differences in the intergenic spacer of the Xlinked ribosomal DNA [3]. In Mali, the M molecular form
corresponds to the Mopti chromosomal form and the S
molecular form corresponds to the Savanna and Bamako
forms. The distribution of the M molecular form appears

mostly limited to West and Central Africa, whereas the S
molecular form is found throughout the range of A. gambiae [4]. Gene flow between the S and Mopti-M forms is
severely restricted [5,6].
In addition to chromosomal complexity, the genome of
A. gambiae is characterized by high level nucleotide polymorphism. The published genome of A. gambiae PEST
strain was reported to have a frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 1.6 × 10-3 or approximately 1 SNP per 625 bp [7]. Morlais et al [8] found
similarly high levels of polymorphism in other laboratory
strains of A. gambiae. The most recent genome assembly
of A. gambiae in the Ensembl database [9] reports a SNP
density of 1 per 247 bp.
In 35 genes putatively involved in mosquito-pathogen
interactions and behaviour, Morlais et al [8] identified
460 SNPs, 140 of which encode nonsynonymous substitutions. The authors also examined SNP frequencies in
genes encoding fibronectin, thioester-containing protein
3 (TEP3), and peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)
in field-caught A. gambiae from sites in Senegal, Burkina
Faso and Cameroon where the M and S molecular forms
are sympatric [8]. Although the genes selected by Morlais
et al [8] have been shown to function in anti-pathogen
defense in A. gambiae [10], no data on SNP associations
with parasite infection and molecular form - a key variable based on aforementioned predictions of gene flow
[5,6]- were presented.
In addition to studies that have reported SNPs in genes
implicated in anti-parasite immunity, a number of studies
have taken a genome-wide approach to identify factors
that regulate parasite transmission. In particular, Riehle et
al [11] determined that colocalized quantitative trait loci
(QTL) within a region of chromosome 2L in A. gambiae
collected from a single site in Mali accounted for a significant amount of the variation in P. falciparum infection.
The authors designated these QTL as a Plasmodiumresistance island or PRI, but also acknowledged that there
were numerous other loci throughout the genome that
likely contributed to variation in infection [11]. Riehle et
al [11] also hypothesized that resistance is the ancestral
phenotype, whereas susceptibility to infection with P. falciparum results from mutations in the A. gambiae
genome that result in failure of anti-parasite immunity.
Based on these general concepts - that A. gambiae populations exhibit significant genetic structuring, that SNPs
are present in anti-pathogen genes in natural populations
of A. gambiae, that susceptibility to infection may result
from a failure of anti-parasite immunity- and the use of
association mapping to link SNPs in functional genes
with disease states [12], it was hypothesized that SNPs
predicted to alter immune signaling could be linked to
natural P. falciparum infection in A. gambiae. Furthermore, the strength of these associations may be a reflec-

Page 2 of 13

tion of the different genetic backgrounds of A. gambiae, a
phenomenon that will dictate the success of genetic interventions (e.g., creation of refractory mosquito strains) to
block parasite transmission in natural populations [13].
To begin testing these hypotheses, SNPs in a subset of
immune signaling genes were identified using direct
sequencing of conserved domains, and the association of
these SNPs with P. falciparum infection in A. gambiae
collected in Mali were analysed. This association study
revealed significant molecular form-dependent associations of P. falciparum infection with three SNPs in genes
encoding Toll5B and an insulin-like peptide 3 precursor.
In addition, these analyses revealed an epistatically associated SNP in a gene encoding MKK4 - a mitogen-activated protein kinase that has been predicted to function
in the Toll signaling pathway [14-16]. Hence, these data
support the proposed hypotheses and provide new
insights on regulatory factors that are associated with
control of P. falciparum infection in A. gambiae.

Methods
Sample collection

Blood fed female mosquitoes were collected from five villages in Mali in 2006 and 2007 (Table 1). These villages
were selected based on previous data, which identified
them as populations in which M and S forms are sympatric. This facilitated acquisition of adequate numbers of
each form from a single environment. Mosquitoes were
collected between July 28 and September 2 in 2006 and
between August 8 and September 8 in 2007 to reduce
genotype frequency changes related to season. Collected
mosquitoes were dissected so that the head and thorax
were separated from the abdomen. Head and thorax samples were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) to determine P. falciparum infection status
and the paired abdomens were used for species identification and SNP genotyping.
Species identification and ELISA for P. falciparum infection

Mosquitoes were identified to species using the PCR
assay described by Scott et al [17] and to molecular form
using the restriction fragment length polymorphism protocol of Fanello et al [3]. Briefly, following HhaI restriction of an amplified fragment of the X-linked ribosomal
DNA, M molecular form individuals were identified by
the presence of a 367 bp fragment, while S molecular
form individuals were identified by fragments of 110 bp
and 257 bp [3]. The presence of P. falciparum in heads
and thoraces was determined using a "sandwich" circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based ELISA [18,19]. All
ELISA-positive specimens were rescreened against a
standard curve of recombinant CSP to estimate relative
infection levels.

SNP discovery

Genes encoding Toll5B, MKK4 and insulin-like peptide
precursor 3 were selected for analysis based on established roles in anti-pathogen signaling in A. gambiae or in
other mosquito species [20-25]. Primers were designed to
amplify fragments of the encoding sequences of the genes
of interest in the size range of 120-260 bp, which was
optimal for Luminex genotyping (see below).
For PCR, genomic DNA was isolated from A. gambiae
abdominal tissue using the Qiagen BioSprint 96 (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Each
amplification reaction contained 1× buffer with MgCl2
(Roche), 67 μM of each dNTP (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.22 μM primers (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO), 0.7 U Taq Polymerase (Roche), and 40 ng of
genomic DNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C
for 2 min; 2 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 62°C for 30 sec, 72°C
for 30 sec; 6 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55-61°C (the range
of target-specific annealing temperatures) for 30 sec,
72°C for 30 sec; 27 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30
sec, 72°C for 30 sec, followed by a 7 minute extension at
72°C. Amplimer sizes were confirmed by electrophoresis
prior to purification with Exo SapIT ([26]; USB, Cleveland, OH) for DNA sequencing.
Initial amplifications were performed using six sets of
pooled genomic DNA samples from each of four P. falciparum-infected A. gambiae (n = 24) and six sets of
pooled genomic DNA samples from each of four uninfected control A. gambiae (n = 24) collected in the same
village on the same day. This pooling strategy has been
shown to be very accurate (>98%) for detecting SNPs in
individuals [27]. Pooled sequences were aligned using
MegAlign (DNAStar Lasergene 8.0, Madison, WI) software and the ClustalW algorithm [28]. Each potential
SNP was confirmed manually with the chromatogram of
the pool. When a polymorphism was detected in the
pooled A. gambiae amplimers, each of the four genomic
DNAs in the pool was subjected to separate re-amplifica-

tion and sequencing to determine if the locus was indeed
polymorphic, and if so, which individuals were polymorphic and whether the individuals were homozygous or
heterozygous.
Individual sequences from the 48 genomic DNA samples used for SNP discovery were aligned using MegAlign
(DNAStar Lasergene 8.0, Madison, WI) software and the
ClustalW algorithm [28]. Loci demonstrating divergence
from the consensus sequences were designated as potential SNPs. The existence of each SNP was confirmed by
manual examination of individual chromatograms. All
SNPs were analysed by SIFT [29] and pMUT [30] to
determine the likelihood that a particular SNP would
affect protein function.
Genotyping

SNPs for Luminex analysis [31] were chosen based on the
presence of a minimum of 20 bp of flanking sequence that
was free of SNPs. Based on this requirement, we selected
11 SNP loci out of 96 SNPs for analysis: insulin-like peptide 3 precursor loci 2-5 (AGAP010602; Ins32, Ins33,
Ins34, Ins35); MKK4 loci 1 and 3 (AGAP003365; MKK41,
MKK43) and Toll5B loci 1-4 and 6 (AGAP010669;
Toll5B1, Toll5B2, Toll5B3, Toll5B4, Toll5B6). Allele-specific primers were designed for each of the 11 SNPs
(Additional file 1). A total of 134 P. falciparum-infected
A. gambiae and 134 uninfected A. gambiae collected in
the same village on the same day were analysed with
Luminex (Additional file 1). The 48 individuals used for
SNP discovery were included among these samples, providing internal quality control checks for Luminex performance in detecting heterozygotes and homozygotes at
each of the dimorphic loci.
Allele-specific primer extension (ASPE)

For each Luminex assay, SNP-containing amplimers were
combined in a final volume of 10 μl. This mixture was
treated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and exonuclease (ExoI) to remove unused PCR primers and

dNTPs. For each reaction, 1 U of SAP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, New Jersey) and 5 U ExoI (USB
Corp., Cleveland, Ohio) were mixed with 10 μl of amplified product and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, followed by 80°C for 15 minutes to inactivate the enzymes.
Ten μl aliquots of ASPE master mix containing 500 nM
of each ASPE primer, 50 mM MgCl2, 10× buffer (supplied
with enzyme), 100 μM each dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 400
μM biotin-dCTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) and
0.8 U Platinum Tsp DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) were
dispensed to the pooled, SAP/ExoI-treated PCR products
using a Biomek® 2000 Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California). The ASPE
reaction was performed in a PTC-225 Peltier Thermal
Cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, Massachusetts) and
cycling parameters consisted of an initial denaturation at
96°C for 2 minutes, followed by 94°C for 30 seconds and
56°C for 2 minutes, repeated 49 times, ending with 72°C
for 5 minutes.
Hybridization to FlexMAP beads

Individual FlexMAP™ bead types (MiraiBio, Alameda,
California) were obtained at a concentration of 2.5 × 105
microspheres/ml. After resuspension by vortexing for 5
minutes, 2.5 μl of each bead type per sample was used to
make up the appropriate bead mix for each of the three
multiplex assays. Each bead mix was concentrated by
centrifugation at 10,000 × g for three minutes followed by
careful removal of the supernatant. Beads were then
resuspended in 2× TM hybridization buffer (0.4 M NaCl,
0.2 M Tris HCl pH 8.0, 0.16% Triton X-100) and dH2O,
and added to each sample for a final volume of 50 μl
(resulting in 625 beads/allele in 1× TM). Samples were
denatured at 96°C for 90 seconds, followed by hybridization at 52°C, 47°C and 37°C for 30 minutes at each temperature. The hybridized beads were washed twice by
centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 3 minutes, removal of the
supernatant and resuspension in 70 μl of 1× TM buffer.
After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant for a
third time, beads were resuspended in 70 μl 1× TM buffer
containing
8
μg/ml
streptavidin-phycoerythrin
(ProZyme, San Leandro, California), a fluorescent
reporter molecule used to detect the ASPE-incorporated
biotin.
Sample analysis on the Luminex 100 System

Samples were analysed on the Luminex 100 System using
Data Collection Software Version 1.7 with settings specified by the manufacturer; the median fluorescence intensity (signal) was measured over 100 independent events
(beads). The genotype of each SNP locus was determined
by the ratio of fluorescence intensity of allele A, IA, and
that of allele B, IB. If IA /IB was greater than 3.5, genotype
was set as AA; if IA /IB was less than 0.5, genotype was set

Page 4 of 13

as BB; for other ratio values, the genotype was set as AB.
These thresholds were confirmed by comparison to the
direct sequencing data available for each of the polymorphic loci.
Statistics

The pwr package for R http://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/pwr/index.html was used for power analysis.
This package calculated effect size, required sample size,
and power for each SNP using the methods of Cohen
[32]. Significant differences in allele frequency (1)
between infected and uninfected samples within a population and (2) between any two populations were determined using Fisher's exact test (for 2 by 2 contingency
tables) or Chi-square test implemented in R statistics
package http://www.r-project.org. Significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple comparisons [33].
Unaccounted population structure can lead to the discovery of spurious associations or dilute true associations
[34,35]. To eliminate associations due to population
structure, we tested whether our SNP genotypes showed
significant divergence based on geographic location and
molecular form. Samples were first divided into eight
groups based on collection site and molecular form.
Next, pairwise FST values were calculated using Arlequin
v 3.11 [36]. The two groups with the highest p-values
were then combined and pair-wise FST values were recalculated. If genetic divergence, as described by FST,
between a pair of groups is minimal, the p-value is close
to 1. This was repeated until all between-group FST values
were significant. The eight initial groups (based on collection site and molecular form) were ultimately reduced
to 3 distinct groups: M, S1, and S2, as described in the
Results. Within each of the three groups, linkage disequilibrium was calculated using Arlequin. Phylip v 3.68
[37,38] was used for phylogenetic tree construction.

Results
Among the 11 SNPs analysed, the frequency of exact
matches between direct sequencing and Luminex for
individual genotypes (n = 48) was greater than 98%, indicating that Luminex was highly accurate for genotyping.
Based on SNP genotypes at the 11 loci selected, at least
three genetically distinct populations in Mali (Figure 1)
were identified. In agreement with population genetic
studies based on microsatellites [39,40], significant
genetic differentiation between M and S molecular forms
was observed. Further, Pimperena S (S2) form mosquitoes were differentiated from S forms collected in other
villages (S1). This outcome may be due to temporal variation in the relative abundance of the Bamako and
Savanna chromosomal forms, both of which are the S
molecular form and therefore indistinguishable using the
Fanello et al [3] molecular form diagnostic.

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of field-collected A. gambiae. Construction was based on pairwise FST calculated from SNP allele frequencies.

The association between SNP genotypes at each locus
and infection status within each of the three populations
indicated in Figure 1 was evaluated using Chi-square and
Fisher's exact tests. Infection rates of the genotyped A.
gambiae ranged from 3.27% in Selinkenyi to a high of
15.09% in Doneguebougou (Table 1). Genotype frequencies at the Ins35 locus were significantly different
between the Pimperena (S2) and S1 groups, while genotype frequencies at the Toll5B1 locus were significantly
different between S2 and all other groups (M and S1 in
Table 2). All SNPs identified to be associated with infection status had an effect size (h) greater than 1 (Table 3)
and power greater than 0.85. Those SNPs that were determined to be associated with population groups had
power greater than 0.83 (Table 3). SNPs with smaller h,
such as Ins32 and Ins35 (0.75 < h < 1), could be associated
with infection if a larger sample size was scored. For
example, if 30 infected specimens and 62 uninfected
specimens for Ins32 were genotyped and a similar genotype frequency distribution was observed, Ins32 could be
identified as significantly associated with infection status.
The sample sizes of this study were not sufficient to confirm involvement of SNPs with smaller h - such as Ins32
or Ins35 - in the regulation of P. falciparum development
in A. gambiae.
Three SNPs - Ins34 (3L), Toll5B1 (3L), and Toll5B6 (3L)
(Table 2) - were found to be associated with P. falciparum
infection status. Ins34 is a synonymous SNP resulting in a
change from GGC to GGT at nucleotide position 462 in
the Insulin-like peptide 3 precursor gene. Toll5B1 introduces a synonymous SNP at nucleotide position 129,
changing the codon from ATC, a common codon (28.3%),
to ATT, a rarer codon (12.9%). Toll5B6 results in a nonsynonymous codon change from AGC (Ser, S) to AAC
(Asn, N) at amino acid position 454 in the predicted
translation of Toll5B. These SNPs were not identified in
either the NCBI or Anobase SNP databases generated by

Page 5 of 13

reads from the PEST strain (10× coverage) or from the
MOPTI strain (1.2× coverage) aligned to Celera A. gambiae contigs, although Ins34 and Toll5B6 were both present in the M and S form scans available from VectorBase
[41]. However, these loci were not identified to be polymorphic in either scan [41]. The CC genotype at the
Ins34 locus in M form mosquitoes was more common in
samples that were not infected with P. falciparum. In both
M and S1 populations, Toll5B1 C alleles were significantly associated with infection status. While the Toll5B1
TT genotype was rare, TC heterozygotes were more common in uninfected A. gambiae than in P. falciparuminfected A. gambiae. Within the S1 population, individuals with the AG genotype at the Toll5B6 locus were less
likely to be infected with P. falciparum.
Significant differences in median P. falciparum sporozoite infection intensities were observed in the collected
samples (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p = 1.88x10-5, Figure 2, Table 4). However, no significant association
between P. falciparum infection intensity and any SNP
locus genotype was observed. The sporozoite infection
intensities were highly variable in M and S1 populations
as indicated by the standard deviations being more than
double their associated means shown in Table 4. Among
infected mosquitoes, samples from Pimperena (S2) had
higher median sporozoite intensities than those from
other villages. VectorBase A. gambiae population data
indicated that samples from Pimperena are mostly
Savanna chromosomal form while other sites like Doneguebougou and Selinkenyi are composed of a mixture of
Bamako and Savanna forms. Thus, the possibility of chromosomal form affecting the density of P. falciparum in
the S1 group cannot be ruled out.

Discussion
Many factors contribute to mosquito infection and successful transmission of malaria parasites, including innate
immunity. As such, considerable efforts have been
focused on understanding the mosquito immune system
and natural variability in these defenses. In humans,
numerous reports have demonstrated that natural variability to infection can be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that regulate host
immunity [42-44]. Although SNP associations have been
described for a variety of human infections and diseases,
these have not been identified for P. falciparum infection
in genetically defined natural populations of A. gambiae
until this study.
The Toll and Imd signaling pathways are important regulators of innate immunity in A. gambiae. In particular,
Garver et al [45] reported that, under laboratory conditions, the Toll pathway controlled P. falciparum infection
intensity in A. gambiae, while the Imd pathway appeared
to regulate resistance to infection. Two Toll5B SNPs -

Toll5B1 and Toll5B6 - were significantly associated with
P. falciparum infection status among field-collected A.
gambiae. Anopheles gambiae Toll5B is orthologous to
Drosophila melanogaster Toll-5, also known as Tehao
[10], and Toll5 in Aedes aegypti [46]. In Ae. aegypti,
Toll5B was inducibly expressed in the mosquito fat body
following fungal infection [47]. In A. gambiae, Pinto et al
[48] reported that Toll5B expression is significantly
upregulated in hemocytes of adult female mosquitoes
infected with Plasmodium berghei at 24-28 hours postinfection, a period associated with active parasite invasion of the midgut epithelium. Based on these observations and these data, Toll5B is likely to be responsive to P.
falciparum infection in A. gambiae under natural conditions.
Both Toll5B SNPs showed divergence from HardyWeinberg equilibrium. In particular, Toll5B1 showed significant divergence from Hardy-Weinberg expectation in
both the M (p = 0.00016) and S1 (p = 0.00077) forms,
while Toll5B6 showed significant divergence from HardyWeinberg expectation in the M form (p = 0.00035; Table
5), suggesting that selection pressure(s) acting on these
loci may skew the genotype frequencies of this gene. For
Toll5B1, the observed heterozygosity was greater than
expected, both in M and S1 groups (Table 5). For this
SNP, CT heterozygotes were more common (96%) in
uninfected samples while 72% of infected samples were
CC homozygotes. TT homozygotes were very rare and

only one sample of this genotype was identified in the
entire collection. These circumstances indicate the possibility of heterosis or balancing selection on this locus. For
Toll5B6, the GG homozygote was the most common
form in all groups and the proportion of GG was highest
in the M uninfected group. The effect size of this SNP
was 0.514, so a larger sample size (83 infected and 183
uninfected) would be needed (Table 3) to confirm
involvement of this SNP with respect to infection status
in the M form population.
Toll5B1 occurs in a highly polymorphic region, containing 13 polymorphic loci within a stretch of 166 bp.
Six of these SNPs occur in clusters of rare codons or
result in the change from a common codon to a rare one.
Clusters of rare codons have been shown to alter protein
production in a synergistic manner [49-51]. Genotype
frequencies of Toll5B1 and infection associations of this
SNP were significantly different between Pimperena (S2)
and A. gambiae M and S1 groups (Table 2). Taken
together with observations on codon frequency and protein function, these data suggest that within the M and S1
molecular forms, this SNP may have a functional effect
on P. falciparum infection, but this association may be
population-specific, as indicated by the lack of any
Toll5B1-P. falciparum infection association in the Pimperena (S2) population. Toll5B6 is a non-synonymous
SNP that introduces the amino acid change S454N. The
replacement of serine by the more bulky asparagine could

introduce subtle changes in the 3-dimensional structure
of the Toll leucine-rich repeat (LRR) in which this mutation occurs.
Additional analyses revealed that MKK43, a SNP in the
MAPK kinase MKK4 gene, located on chromosome 2,
was in linkage disequilibrium with infection-associated
Toll5B1, a SNP on chromosome 3, in the S1 population (p
= 0.0001). In mammals, MKK4 can be activated by TLR3
[16] and TLR2 signaling [14,15], indicating that MKK4
activation is functionally linked to Toll signaling. Downstream of this activation, MKK4 functions with MKK7 as
the primary activator of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or JNK,
one of three immunity-associated MAPKs. In D. melanogaster, Toll activation of MKK4/7 and JNK during septic
injury regulates cytoskeletal genes typically associated
with a wound healing response to infection [52]. A potential Toll/MKK4/JNK signaling module - if biologically
functional in A. gambiae - could be linked to the profound cytoskeletal changes in the midgut epithelium that
have been described during P. berghei and P. falciparum
infection of laboratory and field specimens of A. gambiae,
respectively [53-55]. This possibility is currently being
investigated.
In mammals, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling cascade (IIS) has been shown to regulate innate
immunity through Toll- and NF-κB-dependent pathways
[56,57]. In particular, IIS activation can induce or inhibit
NF-κB-dependent signaling and is, thereby, capable of

exerting both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects on the
host immune response. In Anopheles stephensi, control of
malaria parasite development is regulated by signaling
proteins associated with the IIS cascade [[22], CorbyHarris et al. unpublished]. The IIS is highly conserved
[23] and critical components of the cascade, as well as a
variety of insulin-like peptides, including insulin-like
peptide 3 precursor, are expressed in the midgut of A.
gambiae [[58]; Luckhart, unpublished].
Four SNPs in the insulin-like peptide 3 precursor gene Ins32, Ins33, Ins34 and Ins35 - were analysed and significant infection (Ins34) and molecular form (Ins35) associations were found for two of these (Table 2). Ins34
introduces a synonymous mutation, with no remarkable
change in codon frequency. Although Ins34 is predicted
to have little to no effect on protein function, this infection-associated SNP was in linkage disequilibrium in the
S1 population with Toll5B2 (p = 0.03307, Additional file
2), a SNP that introduces the non-synonymous mutation
D56A into Toll5B. This SNP encodes a mutation close to
the N-terminus and outside of the predicted LRRs, in an
ectodomain region identified in other Toll proteins as the
cysteine-rich capping structure [59]. The N-terminal capping structure may participate in protein-protein interactions that are critical for Toll receptor function [59].
Within the S1 population, Ins32, Ins33, and Ins35
showed levels of linkage disequilibrium with Toll5B2 similar to that observed for Ins34 (p = 0.01238, 0.02931,

reflects the fact that these loci are closely linked physically. Although Ins35 was not significantly associated
with infection status (Table 2), this SNP was also in linkage disequilibrium with Toll5B2 in the S2 population (pvalue = 0.00406, Additional file 2). However, in the S2
population, the neighboring SNPs - Ins32, Ins33, Ins34 did not show similar levels of linkage disequilibrium with
Toll5B2 (p = 0.09584, 0.14396, 0.13238, respectively,
Additional file 2), suggesting that the associations of
Ins34 and Ins35 with Toll5B2 may, in fact, represent novel
biological functionality that is population-specific in A.
gambiae.
The positional effects of SNPs in the architecture of signaling cascades have been investigated in a series of relevant studies. Riley et al [60] examined SNPs in the D.
melanogaster Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway.
The least polymorphic signaling protein genes (e.g., Ras,
Dr, and Polehole) were those that were proximal to the
origin of signaling at the cell surface, while the most polymorphic genes were located farther downstream in the
signaling cascade (e.g., Dsor1, Csw and Ksr; [60]). Computational simulations of MAPK signaling predicted sim-

ilar constraints in that if signal amplification was crucial,
the upstream signaling proteins were more constrained
than were the downstream components [61]. Together
these findings suggest that a SNP in an upstream component of a signaling cascade, such as Toll or an ILP, could
have pleiotropic effects on the downstream components
of the signaling cascade and an increased potential for a
deleterious outcome [62]. In studies of the Tor signaling
pathway, however, selection constraints were found to be
greater in the downstream components rather than the
upstream components of the cascade [62]. Regardless of
the pattern of selection constraints, the polarity of a signal transduction pathway is an integral part of determining the effect of a SNP. As such, the molecular cell biology
of the signaling pathway protein networks highlighted
herein can complement studies of phenotype-associated
SNPs in natural A. gambiae populations.

Conclusions
In summary, the infection-associated SNPs that have
been identified here could be used as genetic markers for
the susceptibility of an anopheline population to malaria
parasite infection. More importantly, however, these
SNPs confirm previous laboratory associations of the target genes with the regulation of parasite infection in A.
gambiae, extending possible functional linkages among
these target genes and confirming the influence of population structuring on biological associations of the SNPs
under study. In particular, these data together with associated laboratory data that implicate these gene products
in anti-parasite immunity suggest that Toll5B, MKK4 and
insulin-like peptide 3 alone or perhaps in some combination may be involved in the regulation of P. falciparum
development in A. gambiae under natural conditions.
The alternative hypothesis - that the true functional
genes are linked to these SNPs - will be evaluated as haplotype maps are developed. In addition, these data have
revealed that SNPs are not equally distributed among A.
gambiae molecular forms and that selection pressures
may be driving deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These insights suggest that gene flow may impede
the spread of transgenes under field conditions and that
selection may alter the distribution of transgenes, factors
that must be accommodated in the development of any
field strategies.
