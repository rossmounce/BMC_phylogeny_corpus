Abstract

Gene duplication is thought to be a major driving force in evolutionary innovation by providing material from which novel
gene functions and expression patterns may arise. Duplicated
genes have been shown to be present in all eukaryotic

genomes currently sequenced [1] and are thought to arise by
tandem, chromosomal or whole genome duplication events.
Unless the duplication event is immediately advantageous
(for example, by gene dosage increasing evolutionary fitness),
the gene pair will exhibit functional redundancy, allowing one

Results: Using the abundance of duplicated genes within the Fugu genome, we selected seven pairs
of teleost-specific paralogs involved in early vertebrate development, each containing clusters of
CNEs in their vicinity. CNEs present around each Fugu duplicated gene were identified using
multiple alignments of orthologous regions between single-copy mammalian orthologs
(representing the ancestral locus) and each fish duplicated region in turn. Comparative analysis
reveals a pattern of element retention and loss between paralogs indicative of subfunctionalization,
the extent of which differs between duplicate pairs. In addition to complete loss of specific
regulatory elements, a number of CNEs have been retained in both regions but may be responsible
for more subtle levels of subfunctionalization through sequence divergence.

deposited research

Background: A major mechanism for the preservation of gene duplicates in the genome is
thought to be mediated via loss or modification of cis-regulatory subfunctions between paralogs
following duplication (a process known as regulatory subfunctionalization). Despite a number of
gene expression studies that support this mechanism, no comprehensive analysis of regulatory
subfunctionalization has been undertaken at the level of the distal cis-regulatory modules involved.
We have exploited fish-mammal genomic alignments to identify and compare more than 800
conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) that associate with genes that have undergone fish-specific
duplication and retention.

of the pair to accumulate mutations without affecting key
functions. Because deleterious mutations are thought to
occur much more commonly than neutral or advantageous
ones, the classic model for the evolutionary fate of duplicated
genes [2,3] predicts the degeneration of one of the copies to a
pseudogene as the most likely outcome (a process known as
non-functionalization). Less commonly, a mutation will be
advantageous, allowing one of the gene duplicates to evolve a
new function (a process known as neo-functionalization).
Therefore, the classic model predicts that these two competing outcomes will result in the elimination of most duplicated
genes. However, several studies suggest that the proportion
of duplicated genes retained in vertebrate genomes is much
higher than is predicted by this model [4-6]. This has led to
the suggestion of an alternative model whereby complementary degenerative mutations in independent subfunctions of
each gene copy permits their preservation in the genome, as
both copies of the gene are now required to recapitulate the
full range of functions present in the single ancestral gene.
This was formalized in the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model [7] in a process referred to as
subfunctionalization.
The key novelty of the DDC model is that, rather than attributing different expression patterns of duplicated genes to the
acquisition of novel functions, they are attributed to a partial
(complementary) loss of function in each duplicate. In combination they retain the complete function of the pleiotropic
original gene, but neither of them alone is sufficient to provide full functionality. For this model to be viable, the subfunctions of the gene are required to be independent so that
mutations in one subfunction will not affect the other. The
modular nature of many eukaryotic protein-coding sequences
as well as cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), such as enhancers
or silencers [8], means both can act as subfunctions or components of subfunctions of the gene in subfunctionalization.
CRMs are cis-acting DNA sequences, up to several hundred
bases in length, thought to be composed of clustered combinatorial binding sites for large numbers of transcription factors that together actuate a regulatory response for one or
more genes [9]. The larger number of independently mutable
units represented by CRMs, the small size and rapid turnover
of transcription factor binding sites, as well as observations
that, for many gene duplicates, changes that occur between
paralogs are due to changes in expression rather than protein
function has led a number of researchers to emphasize that
important evolutionary changes might occur primarily at the
level of gene regulation [10,11]. Consequently, subfunctionalization is thought most likely to occur by complementary
degenerative mutations within regulatory elements.
Teleost fish provide an excellent system to study the DDC
model in vertebrates due to the presence of extra gene duplicates that derive from a whole genome duplication event early
in the evolution of ray-finned fishes 300-350 million years
ago [12-17] This provides the opportunity for comparative

analyses of gene duplicates in fish against a single ortholog in
tetrapod lineages such as mammals. In particular, for analyses involving important developmentally associated genes,
these 'single copies' represent as close as possible the ancestral gene from which the fish duplicates descended, since
such genes are often highly conserved in sequence and function throughout vertebrates. We therefore refer to fish-specific duplicate genes as 'co-orthologs' (a term previously used
in [18]) as each copy is co-orthologous to the single homolog
in tetrapods.
A number of studies on fish duplicated genes have identified
cases of subfunctionalization at both the regulatory and protein level. For instance, analysis of the synapsin-Timp genes
in the pufferfish Fugu rubripes identified a case of protein
subfunctionalization where two isoforms of the SYN gene
expressed in human are expressed as two separate genes in
Fugu [19]. A number of functional studies on the shared and
divergent expression patterns of developmental co-orthologs
in fish have also been carried out, for example, eng2 [20],
sox9 [18] and runx2 [21]. In each case, partitioning of ancestral expression domains for each co-ortholog compared to the
single (ancestral representative) gene in mammals was
observed via gene expression studies, supporting a process of
regulatory subfunctionalization along the lines of the DDC
model. Work on identifying the regulatory elements involved
has so far been limited to those responsible for divergent
expression within the well-studied Hox genes. Santini et al.
[22], through comparison to the single tetrapod Hox cluster,
identified a number of conserved elements in fish-specific
Hox clusters. These appeared to be partitioned between clusters, suggesting they may be responsible for their divergent
expression. In addition, the zebrafish hoxb1a and hoxb1b
genes, co-orthologs of the HOXB1 gene in mammals and
birds, were found to exhibit complementary degeneration of
two cis-regulatory elements identified upstream and downstream of the gene, consistent with the DDC model [23]. Similarly, Postlethwait et al. [24] carried out a comparative
genomic analysis of the regions surrounding two zebrafish coorthologs, eng2a and eng2b, against the single human
ortholog EN2 and found one conserved non-coding element
partitioned in each copy, together with a number of elements
conserved in both. Both co-orthologs have overlapping
expression in the midbrain-hindbrain border and jaw muscles, but eng2a is expressed in the somites and eng2b is
expressed in the anterior hindbrain (both of which are
expression domains found in the single mammalian
ortholog). Hence, according to the DDC model, they hypothesized that sequences conserved in both co-orthologs represent regulatory elements responsible for overlapping
expression domains, whilst conserved sequences specific to
each gene are candidates for regulatory elements that drive
expression to domains present in the single mammalian
ortholog but now partitioned between co-orthologs. Despite
these isolated examples, evidence for the DDC model, by way

Studies into fish-specific duplicated genes have identified a
number of examples in the Fugu genome (for example,
[15,39]). As with most genes in general, few of these Fugu
specific duplicates have CNEs in their vicinity. Suitable gene
candidates for study of CNE evolution between teleost-specific gene paralogs were initially identified using 2,330 CNEs
derived from a whole-genome comparison of the non-coding
portions of the human and Fugu genome [29]. CNE clusters
that mapped to the vicinity of a single human genomic region
but were derived from two non-contiguous Fugu scaffolds
were considered further. We selected seven genomic regions

deposited research

Identification of co-orthologs in the Fugu genome

For each CNE cluster region in the human genome, we identified homologs to the human trans-dev protein on each Fugu
scaffold, suggesting the presence of co-orthologous genes. To
confirm this, we carried out a phylogeny of these protein
sequences together with tetrapod orthologs and all available
co-orthologs from the zebrafish genome. In addition, two outgroups utilizing the closest in-paralog as well as an invertebrate ortholog were included in each alignment to help
resolve the phylogeny (Figure 1). In all cases where a close
paralog could be identified, the Fugu co-ortholog candidates
branch with strong bootstrap values with tetrapod orthologs
of the target trans-dev gene, rather than the closest paralog,
confirming these genes are true co-orthologs. Furthermore,
for all phylogenies, the Fugu and zebrafish/medaka
sequences branch together after the split with tetrapods, confirming they derive from a fish-specific duplication event. In
only one out of three cases (pax2) where two co-orthologous
proteins could also be identified in zebrafish does each Fugu
copy branch directly with each zebrafish copy, indicating
their proteins have followed similar evolutionary paths (Figure 1d). In contrast, the other two cases (sox1 and unc4.1)
exhibit a different topology in that both zebrafish coorthologs are more similar to one of the Fugu co-orthologs
than the other (although weak bootstrap values for the fish
unc4.1 may suggest alternative phylogenies). This is most
likely due to species-specific asymmetrical rates of evolution
seen between many genes in teleost fish [52], as well as elevated rates of evolution in duplicated genes in general, and
pufferfish in particular [38], which may have obscured the
true phylogenies in these cases. The given names of the Fugu
co-orthologs used in this study (see Materials and methods
for more details on nomenclature), their location in the Fugu
genome and protein sequence accession codes can be found

in human that fitted this criterion, each containing clusters of
CNEs in the vicinity of a single gene implicated in developmental regulation: BCL11A (transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A), EBF1 (early B-cell factor 1), FIGN
(fidgetin), PAX2 (paired box transcription factor Pax2), SOX1
(HMG box transcription factor Sox1), UNC4.1 (homeobox
gene Unc4.1) and ZNF503 (zinc-finger gene Znf503). Some of
these genes have relatively well characterized roles in early
development, such as PAX2 (which plays critical roles in eye,
ear, central nervous system and urogenital tract development
[40-42], SOX1 (involved in neural and lens development
[43,44], BCL11A (thought to play important roles in leukaemogenesis and haematopoiesis [45]) and EBF1 (important for B-cell, neuronal and adipocyte development [46,47].
FIGN, UNC4.1 and ZNF503 are less well characterized,
although studies of their orthologs in mouse or rat indicate
important roles in retinal, skeletal and neuronal development
[48-51].

reviews

Fugu-mammal CNEs, enriched for putative CRMs, therefore
provide an excellent class of sequences through which to test
the DDC model further. In addition, a study has found that at
least 6.6% of the Fugu genome is represented by fish-specific
duplicate genes [15], making Fugu an attractive genome in
which to identify and analyze regulatory elements involved in
subfunctionalization of fish co-orthologs. Transcription factors and genes involved in development and cellular differentiation appear to be overrepresented within duplicated genes
in fish genomes [38], improving the chances of identifying
suitable candidates. Here, by taking an approach similar to
Postlethwait et al. [24], we carried out alignments of genomic
sequence around seven pairs of Fugu developmental coorthologs against a number of single mammalian orthologous
regions in order to investigate whether differential presence
of conserved elements between co-orthologs is consistent
with the DDC model of regulatory subfunctionalization.

comment

Comparison of non-coding genomic sequence across extreme
evolutionary distances such as that between fish and mammals to identify regions that remain conserved has proved
powerful in identifying sequences likely to be vertebrate-specific distal CRMs (see [25] for a review). Fugu-mammal conserved non-coding elements (CNEs), identified genome-wide,
cluster almost exclusively in the vicinity of genes implicated
in transcriptional regulation and early development (termed
trans-dev genes) with little or no conservation in non-coding
sequence outside of these regions; a finding confirmed by a
number of recent studies [25-31]. Furthermore, a majority of
those CNEs tested in vivo drive expression of a reporter gene
in a temporal and spatial specific manner that often overlaps
the endogenous expression pattern of the nearby trans-dev
gene, confirming this association and their likely role as critical CRMs for these genes [26,29,32-36]. The tight association
of CNEs with trans-dev genes is likely the result of the fundamental nature of developmental gene regulatory networks
involved in correct spatial-temporal patterning of the vertebrate body plan [26,37].

All but one of the CNE regions in human are located in genepoor regions termed 'gene deserts' that flank or surround the
trans-dev gene and are characteristic of regions thought to
contain large numbers of cis-regulatory elements [30]. These
gene deserts appear to have been conserved to some degree in
both Fugu copies (albeit in a highly compact form). For example, a large gene desert of approximately 2.2 Mb is located
downstream of BCL11A up to the ubiquitin ligase gene FANCL
in human, and similar (compacted) versions of this gene
desert are present in both Fugu regions, although
downstream of bcl11a.2 it is almost a quarter of the size com-

CNEs were independently identified within each Fugu coorthologous region by carrying out a combination of multiple
and pairwise alignment with the same orthologous sequence
from human, mouse and rat (the entire dataset from this
study can be accessed and queried through the web-based
CONDOR database [53]). The regions in which CNEs were

pared to the same region in bcl11a.1 (98 kb versus 380 kb). In
the majority of regions under study (five out of seven), CNEs
extend purely within these large intergenic regions directly
flanking or within the introns of the trans-dev gene. In those
regions in which CNEs extend beyond or within the genes
neighboring the trans-dev gene (that is, bcl11a.1, znf503.1
and znf503.2) the gene order and orientation between Fugu
and human has remained largely conserved, spanning three
to five genes, something that is relatively rare within the Fugu
genome [54,55]. This may be due to functional constraints on
these regions whereby it is necessary to maintain the CRM
and associated gene in cis [34,56]. For the remaining coorthologous regions the degree of synteny varies widely. For
instance, neither Fugu pax2 region has conserved gene order
with the human genome. Two orthologs of NDUFB8 and
HIF1AN (upstream of human PAX2) are partitioned and
rearranged so that hif1an is downstream of pax2.1 and
ndufb8 is downstream of pax2.2 (Figure 2).

Similar to other trans-dev gene regions identified previously
(for example, [26]), the co-orthologs under study have highly
variable numbers of CNEs conserved in their vicinity, ranging
from 11 CNEs in sox1.2 to 156 in znf503.1 (Figure 4). Comparison of the overall number of CNEs conserved between coorthologous copies revealed three sets, bcl11a.1/2, ebf1.1/2
and znf503.1/.2, that have notably different overall numbers
of CNEs located in their vicinity, indicating a large-scale loss
of elements in one co-ortholog compared to its counterpart
since duplication (Figure 4). In the cases of bcl11a.1/2 and
znf503.1/2, this large-scale asymmetrical loss of elements in
one co-ortholog copy correlates to a large decrease in genomic
sequence within the same region (Additional data file 2).

The accuracy of these results depends heavily on ensuring
that the loss of elements in one co-ortholog is the result of
subfunctionalization rather than lack of sequence coverage in
the genomic sequence. The proportion of 'N's (sections of
unfinished sequence) within each Fugu genomic sequence
can be seen in Table 1. We found that only one of the gene
regions, sox1.2, contains a significant proportion of unfinished sequence (8.9%), suggesting some of the CNEs defined
as 'distinct' in sox1.1 may have overlapping counterparts in
sox1.2. However, closer examination of the positioning of the
unfinished sequence reveals that the vast majority occurs in a
region easily defined by two flanking overlapping CNEs that
contains just a single distinct CNE in its counterpart coortholog. The region in sox1.2 potentially containing counterparts to most of the distinct CNEs in sox1.1 contains less than
3% unfinished sequence, suggesting most, if not all, of these
distinct CNEs are defined correctly. Without 100% finished
sequence in all cases it is, of course, possible that a small proportion of the CNEs identified as distinct in these coorthologs may have an overlapping counterpart within unfinished sequence, but given the high levels of finished sequence
in most of the gene regions, this is unlikely to account for a
significant number.

deposited research

The DDC model for the retention of gene duplicates over evolution states that following duplication, genes undergo complementary degenerative loss of subfunctions or, on the
regulatory level, expression domains. Based on the assumption that CNEs represent putative autonomous CRMs that
control gene expression to one or more specific expression
domains, we would predict that this process of regulatory
subfunctionalization would involve the degeneration or loss
of these elements between gene duplicates so that the ancestral CRMs were to some degree partitioned between the two
genes. We identified 811 CNEs in total for all 14 regions in
Fugu with lengths ranging from 30-562 bp (mean = 117 bp,
median = 85 bp) and human-Fugu percent identities ranging
from 60-94% (mean = 74%). CNEs from each co-ortholog
were defined as 'overlapping' if there was conservation
between them to at least part of the same single sequence in
human. CNEs that were conserved between human and only
one Fugu co-ortholog with no significant overlap to CNEs in
the counterpart co-ortholog were defined as 'distinct'. Figure
3 illustrates the definition of overlapping and distinct CNEs
identified in a multiple alignment between Fugu regions
around pax2.1 and pax2.2, against the reference human
PAX2 region.

reports

Pattern of CNE retention/partitioning between coorthologs

Many of the co-orthologs have also undergone substantial
partitioning of elements, as indicated by the large proportion
of the identified CNEs classified as 'distinct' in each coortholog. For example, fign.1 and fign.2 have a similar
number of CNEs in their vicinity (47 and 50, respectively) but
42% and 56% of these CNEs, respectively, are distinct to each
co-ortholog. The extent of distinct CNEs as a proportion of
total CNEs differs significantly between sets of co-orthologs,
ranging from 24.5% (13/53) in pax2.1 to 83% (34/41) in ebf1.1
(Figure 4). For co-orthologs of BCL11A and EBF1 the majority
of CNEs in both genes are distinct. Only in co-orthologs of
PAX2 are the majority of CNEs in both genes found to be
overlapping (Figures 3 and 4), suggesting a high level of
retention of regulatory domains in both genes since duplication. In the majority of gene pairs, namely co-orthologs of
FIGN, SOX1, UNC4.1 and ZNF503, one copy has the majority
of its CNEs as distinct while the other has a majority of its
CNEs overlapping with that of its counterpart co-ortholog,
suggesting an asymmetrical rate of element partition.

reviews

the sequence between human and Fugu, in contrast to the
rearrangement of surrounding genes, confirms the likelihood
that the CNEs and trans-dev genes identified are associated
with each other.

human. The baseline is 268 kb of human sequence. Conservation between human and each sequence is shown as a peak. Peaks that represent conservation
in a non-coding region of at least 65% over 40 bp are shaded pink with coding exons shaded purple and peaks located within untranslated regions shaded
light-blue. All CNEs conserved in at least one of the Fugu co-orthologs are color-coded. CNEs in both Fugu co-orthologs that overlap the same region in
human are shaded yellow while CNEs that are 'distinct' (or conserved solely) in pax2.1 are shaded red and CNEs distinct to pax2.2 are shaded green.
Peaks marked with a double-headed arrow are conserved in Fugu in the opposite orientation (and therefore do not show up in the VISTA plot). A number
of the CNEs around PAX2 are also duplicated CNEs (dCNEs) that are located elsewhere in the genome in the vicinity of PAX2 paralogs. CNEs marked
with an orange box have another dCNE family member in the vicinity of PAX5 and the CNE marked with a blue box has a dCNE family member conserved
upstream of PAX8.

Evolution of overlapping CNEs since duplication
Overlapping CNEs comprise a large proportion and, in some
cases, the majority of CNEs identified around many of the
gene pairs and have, therefore, remained to some extent
under positive selection in both co-orthologs. The distribution of lengths and percent identities for 381 overlapping
CNEs versus 430 distinct CNEs is significantly different for
both lengths (p < 1 × 10-16) and percent identities (p = 1.1-8).
Overlapping CNEs have significantly higher average lengths
(mean = 149.6 bp, median = 116.1 bp) than distinct CNEs
(mean = 87.6 bp, median = 62 bp) as well as slightly higher
percent-identities (mean = 75.2% and median = 75% for overlapping versus mean = 72.4% and median = 71.7% for distinct). Only 4 of the distinct CNEs overlap to some degree but

by less than the arbitrary 20 bp cut-off required for CNEs to
be defined as overlapping. Removing these leaves the mean
lengths and percent-identities virtually unchanged, confirming that the cut-off did not significantly bias the distribution
of distinct elements towards smaller elements.
We studied two aspects to gauge evolutionary changes occurring in these elements since duplication: changes in element
length and changes in substitution rate between overlapping
CNEs in Fugu.

CNE length
A total of 182 pairs of overlapping CNEs were identified
across all co-ortholog pairs with a one-to-one relationship.

Overlapping CNEs are conserved to the same human
sequence across the length of the overlap. However, it is possible that elements have undergone differential evolution,
with one element containing a significantly greater number of
independent substitutions than the other, indicative of either
subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. To measure
whether the sequence of one CNE has diverged faster than its

In addition to being involved in a teleost-specific duplication
event, a number of the CNEs identified around the trans-dev
genes in this study have been previously retained from
ancient duplications thought to have occurred at the origin of
vertebrates. While the majority of CNEs are single copy in the
human genome, a recent study identified 124 families of
CNEs genome-wide that have more than one copy across all
available vertebrate genomes and are referred to as 'duplicated CNEs' (dCNEs) [29]. dCNEs are associated with nearby
trans-dev paralogs and a number have been shown to act as
enhancers that drive in vivo reporter-gene expression to
similar domains [29]. The absence of these sequences in nonvertebrate chordate genomes and their association with paralogs that arose from whole-genome duplication events at the
origin of vertebrates [58] places their origins sometime prior
to this event more than 550 million years ago. The conservation of these elements over such extreme evolutionary distances suggests they play critical roles in the regulation of
paralogs that have since undergone neofunctionalization. We
found 30 non-redundant human CNEs (conserved to 52 coorthologous CNEs in Fugu) to be dCNEs in the vicinity of one
or more paralogs of the nearby trans-dev gene (Table 3). This
further confirms the tight association of these CNEs with
their nearby trans-dev genes as dCNEs resolve the CNE-gene
association more clearly [59]. These dCNEs were identified in
five of the seven co-orthologous regions with some dCNEs
associated with more than one paralog (for example, PAX2
associated dCNEs located in the vicinity of PAX5 and PAX8;
Table 3; Figure 3). 80% of the co-ortholog CNEs identified as
dCNEs (42/52) are conserved in both co-ortholog regions in
Fugu, a two-fold enrichment (p < 0.001) over the expected
number given the overall proportions of overlapping and distinct elements in the CNE dataset.

reports

The length of the overlap in the human sequence between coorthologous CNEs ranged from 24-460 bp (mean = 107.5 bp
± 2.27 standard error of the mean). For each overlapping pair,
we calculated the proportion of the overlapping sequence as a
function of the full length Fugu-human conserved sequence
in each co-ortholog. We found 62% of the pairs to have undergone significant degeneration in element length in one of the
copies compared to its counterpart (Figures 5 and 6); 30% of
pairs overlapped over the majority of both elements, suggesting little evolution of element length since duplication, and
approximately 8% have undergone a significant level of
degeneration in element length in both copies at their edges.
These results suggest the process of subfunctionalization may
also be occurring, at least in some of these cases, through the
partial loss of function in both copies, allowing gene preservation through quantitative complementation (as suggested in
[7]). It is also possible that sequence loss could causes
changes in module function through the change in binding
site combinations present. In genes such as pax2.1 and
pax2.2 that have the majority of their CNEs overlapping in
both genes, this presents an additional mechanism by which
both copies may be preserved. In addition to overlapping
CNEs that have undergone evolution at their edges, 29 overlapping CNEs have undergone evolution at the centre of the
element, essentially creating a split element (that is, a CNE in
one co-ortholog overlaps two or more CNEs from the other
co-ortholog).

counterpart, we used the Tajima relative rate test [57] with
the human sequence as the outgroup (or ancestral) sequence.
The Tajima relative rate test measures the significance in the
difference of independent substitutions in each sequence relative to the outgroup sequence using a chi-squared statistic
(see Additional file 3 for the results of relative rate tests for all
overlapping CNEs). The percentages of overlapping CNEs
that show a statistically significant difference in substitution
rate in one copy over another range from 17% in sox1 to 26%
in znf503 (Table 2). One of the most significant examples
within this set was found in a pair of CNEs upstream of coorthologs of UNC4.1 and can be seen in Figure 6. These
results suggest that a substantial number of the elements
appear to have undergone an asymmetrical rate of evolution
since duplication, something we would expect under the DDC
model. Alternatively, if these changes were positively selected
it may indicate a process of neofunctionalization whereby coorthologs have evolved novel regulatory patterns to that of the
ancestral copy.

Discussion

Recent studies show there are a surprisingly large number of
duplicated genes present in the genomes of all organisms that
cannot be accounted for by the classic models of nonfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The presence of large
numbers of duplicated genes within the genomes of teleost
fish, now widely presumed to have undergone a whole
genome duplication event around 300-350 million years ago,
provide an excellent opportunity for comparative studies to
test the DDC model. Prior to the availability of large-scale
genomic sequences, the ability to study regulatory subfunctionalization through identifying the regulatory elements
responsible was limited due to a lack of appropriate identification strategies. The discovery of thousands of CNEs con-

served across the vertebrate lineage, highly enriched for
sequences likely to be distal cis-regulatory modules, allowed
us to develop a strategy to begin to uncover this. We identified
potential gene candidates that contain both CNEs in their
vicinity and are likely to derive from fish-specific duplication
events using data from the initial whole genome comparison
of the Fugu and human genomes. CNEs that cluster in the
same location in human but derive from two separate locations in the Fugu genome strongly indicate the presence of coorthologous regions. We selected seven clusters of CNEs in
the human genome, each in the vicinity of a single trans-dev
gene that fulfilled these criteria. For each of these genes, we
recreated a phylogeny using protein sequences identified in
each Fugu region, confirming the genes are both orthologs

to have a different function.

CNEs in each co-ortholog are referred to by their CONDOR database identifiers [53]. Each CNE was considered duplicated if the human sequence
they are conserved to shows significant hit to a sequence elsewhere in the genome through BLAST. Any gene in the vicinity (<1.5 Mb away) of the
BLAST hit that is paralogous to genes within a window of the same size around the query CNE is shown in the final column.

The process of subfunctionalization, as described in the DDC
model, is defined as the fixation of complementary loss of
subfunctions that result in the joint preservation of duplicate
loci [7]. For regulatory subfunctionalization, a subfunction
may represent expression of a gene in a specific tissue, cell
lineage or temporal stage. For genes with complex regulation
these subfunctions are controlled by one or a combination of
cis-regulatory modules. A proportion of these can be predicted through the comparative genomic approaches outlined
in this study and for the purposes of this discussion are
assumed to be represented by CNEs. Under the DDC model,
subfunctionalization is thought to occur by two different
routes: qualitative and quantitative [7]. Under qualitative

subfunctionalization one duplicate copy undergoes one or
more complete loss-of-subfunction mutations with the second copy subsequently acquiring null-mutations for a different set of subfunctions. Thus, each copy is required to
recapitulate the full set of ancestral subfunctions. Under this
route, a conserved element representing an independent cisregulatory module that undergoes a null-mutation in one of
the gene copies will no longer be under selective constraint,
and will be 'lost' (that is, will not be detectable by sequence
conservation) through the accumulation of degenerative
mutations over evolution. This process should, therefore, be

What explanations could account for this high level of CNE
retention observed between co-orthologs? The first is the possibility that some CNEs have undergone quantitative subfunctionalization. Here, degenerative mutations in both
CRMs lead to a partial loss of subfunction in each element
(such as a reduction in the level of expression in a specific tissue) rather than complete loss. Therefore, both elements
must be maintained in the genome once the summed activity
for a particular subfunction in both copies has been reduced
to the original level of the ancestral gene [7,60]. Alternatively,
some of these elements may function as silencers or insulators or play roles in chromatin remodeling, ensuring correct
regulatory compartmentalization and control of both gene
duplicates. Another explanation could be the possible interrelations of cis-regulatory modules. As previously mentioned,
there is a possibility that some CRMs are interrelated and act
in concert to perform their function. It is possible, therefore,
that the loss of a CRM critical for the function of other CRMs
could lead to large-scale loss in one gene copy. For example,
the partitioning of two CRMs that are functionally
independent but both dependent on another CRM for correct
function would lead to the retention of that critical CRM in
both gene copies. Finally, it is possible that although both elements have retained general sequence identity, small nucleotide changes between the elements (such as those seen in
asymmetrically evolving CNEs) may have substantial consequences for element function. Indeed in a recent pioneering
study, Tümpel et al. [62] pinpointed subtle sequence changes
within well-defined enhancers responsible for divergent
expression of hoxa2 co-orthologs (hoxa2(a) and hoxa2(b)) in
Fugu. Sequences of the enhancers responsible for full expression of HOXA2 in mice and chicken within the hindbrain
were found to be generally conserved in both Fugu copies.
Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that a small number of
base-pair differences between hoxa2(a) and hoxa2(b)
enhancers within several known transcription factor binding
sites was sufficient to erase enhancer activity and was shown
to be responsible for the lack of expression of hoxa2(a) within
certain expression domains. However, the authors could not
explain why the non-functional enhancers in hoxa2(a) had

reports

In addition to CNEs that have undergone full partitioning
between co-orthologs, some pairs have also retained a
number of overlapping CNEs that have been preserved to

some extent in both copies. For co-orthologs such as pax2.1/
pax2.2, this type of CNE constitutes the majority of CNEs
located around these genes, and is a common feature in most
of the other co-ortholog pairs. Overlapping CNEs appear, in
general, to be longer than distinct CNEs, although at this
stage the relationship (if any) between element size/conservation and its functional importance/regulatory complexity is
still unknown. While some of these elements have remained
virtually identical in length since duplication, others have
undergone major changes both at the edges and at the core of
one of the elements, suggesting information loss in one or
both copies. A significant proportion of overlapping CNEs
have also undergone asymmetrical rates of substitution, suggesting one copy retained the ancestral function while the
other was free to evolve, possibly to a novel function.

reviews

By comparing each Fugu co-ortholog with its single orthologous region in mammals, we attempted to identify those
'ancestral' cis-regulatory modules present in the mammalian
copy that are retained in only one of the Fugu copies and
those that have to some extent been retained in both copies.
This approach is particularly appropriate for early developmental regulators for which function and regulation are likely
to be highly constrained across all vertebrates and the mammalian gene represents as close as possible the ancestral preduplication state. The probability of the preservation of gene
duplicates through subfunctionalization is also assumed to be
higher in genes with complex regulation that contain large
numbers of independently mutable CRMs [60], a view reinforced by the overrepresentation of genes involved in development and cellular differentiation found in fish-specific
gene duplicates [38]. As with trans-dev genes across the
genome, overall numbers of CNEs between gene pairs differs
substantially and is likely to reflect differences in regulatory
complexity or the extent to which regulation in these genes
has been conserved across vertebrate evolution. All seven
pairs of co-orthologs contained a number of CNEs that have
been partitioned into each co-ortholog along the lines of the
qualitative subfunctionalization model. The extent to which
CNEs have been partitioned between co-orthologs, however,
varies widely. For some co-ortholog pairs, such as bcl11a and
ebf1, the majority of CNEs appear to be completely partitioned between the two genes, whilst for other pairs, such as
pax2, only a relatively small proportion is. In the DDC model,
following initial subfunctionalization, the process of nullmutation fixation in persisting redundant subfunctions is
thought to be random, leaving a roughly equal number of subfunctions in each gene copy. Although this appears to be true
for the fign, pax2 and unc4.1 co-orthologs, partitioning in
bcl11a.1/.2 and ebf1.1/.2 is highly asymmetrical. In both of
these cases there is relatively little overlap between the
complement of CNEs associated with each co-ortholog pair. It
is possible, therefore, that the loss of some CNEs in one coortholog may have consequences for further loss of elements
in that gene. CRMs may not all be functionally autonomous
and may interact together to actuate their regulatory role [61].
The degeneration of one or more integral CRMs from a coortholog could accelerate further degeneration of other CRMs
that are functionally dependant on them. Under this scenario,
a gene duplicate may undergo substantial loss of elements,
possibly influencing further asymmetrical loss.

alization is more subtle and results from the fixation of reduction-of-expression mutations in both duplicates [7]. Here,
both regulatory modules must be maintained in the genome
once the summed activity for a particular subfunction in both
copies has been reduced to the original level in the single
ancestral gene.

remained partially conserved, although they postulated they
may have regulatory roles in expression domains not covered
by the survey. This study highlights the power of correlating
known expression differences between co-orthologs with
comparative sequence analysis, especially with previous
knowledge of the binding sites involved. It also highlights, as
functional assays on more ancient duplicated CNEs have
demonstrated [29], that sequence similarity may not always
extend to functional similarity. Indeed, it is equally plausible
that some of the sequence evolution seen between some overlapping CNEs is indicative of neofunctionalization. It would
be of great interest for future studies to correlate any novel
expression of teleost co-orthologs compared to other vertebrate homologs with changes in these elements. Finally,
CNEs may represent several independent or overlapping
CRMs and the loss of sequences within the CNE may be due
to loss of just one of the CRMs, constituting a form of qualitative subfunctionalization
The pattern of CNE retention and evolution in these Fugu coorthologs is certainly consistent with both mechanisms of
subfunctionalization inherent in the DDC model. However,
the extent of the contribution of each mechanism to subfunctionalization is different for each gene pair. This could be a
consequence of each co-ortholog pair having followed a
different evolutionary path after duplication; each under a
number of different selective pressures depending on their
expression and/or function as well as the influence of stochastic evolutionary events following a relaxation of evolutionary constraint due to genetic redundancy. It is clear,
therefore, that confirmation of regulatory subfunctionalization in these gene pairs will require both the characterization
of expression patterns for both co-orthologs (through
approaches such as in situ hybridization) and confirmation of
the regulatory potential of their surrounding CNEs through
rapid in vivo reporter-gene assays. Currently, due to the limitations of Fugu as an experimental model, none of the
expression profiles for the genes in this study have been characterized, which could be used to assess the extent and type of
regulatory change these gene duplicates have undergone. In
the more commonly used zebrafish experimental model
organism gene expression profiles of two gene-pairs from this
study, pax2 and sox1, have been characterized. Expression
patterns of PAX2 co-orthologs of PAX2 (Pax2a and Pax2b)
[63] are highly similar, although absence of Pax2b expression
in the developing kidney as well as differences in temporal
expression confirms they have undergone a level of regulatory
differentiation. This appears to corroborate the pattern of element retention/partitioning seen in Fugu pax2 co-orthologs,
where the majority of CNEs are largely conserved in both copies with a smaller number of elements partitioned between
each gene. This suggests that, similar to their zebrafish
homologs, they may have largely overlapping expression
domains and have undergone a more subtle form of quantitative subfunctionalization through changes in their temporal
expression. A recent survey of expression of the SOX B family

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/4/R53

of genes identified a level of regulatory differentiation
between the zebrafish sox1a and sox1b co-orthologs [64]. The
main differences in expression are temporal (for example,
sox1a expressed in the lens a number of hours before sox1b),
although there are also spatial differences with sox1a expression initiated in hindbrain and forebrain whereas sox1b initiates only in the forebrain. The overall expression patterns of
these co-orthologs correspond closely to SOX1 expression in
other vertebrates, indicating that changes in their expression
are due to subfunctionalization rather than neofunctionalization. Our study reveals that at least half of all CNEs identified
around sox1 co-orthologs have been partitioned, indicative of
a level of subfunctionalization, while only one of the overlapping CNEs has undergone a significant level of substitution; a
possible reflection on the lack of neofunctionalization in these
genes. As patterns of subfunctionalization are known to occur
differently between fish species, it remains for further studies
of the pax2 and sox1 co-orthologs in Fugu to discover whether
expression differences are similar to those observed in
zebrafish.
The majority of regions in this study, in addition to containing
CNEs derived from a teleost-specific duplication have counterparts elsewhere in the genome that derive from more
ancient vertebrate-specific duplications, reflecting the complex duplication histories of their associated genes. The fact
that most of these sequences are retained not only between
co-orthologs (for example, bcl11a.1 and bcl11a.2) but also
between out-paralogs (for example, BCL11A and BCL11B)
spanning over half a billion years of evolution is an indicator
of the potentially critical nature of these sequences to the
regulation of these genes. In addition, this dataset provides
many candidates for further functional studies on the evolution of these sequences and the implications of these changes
on their neofunctionalized paralogs and subfunctionalized
co-ortholog targets.
The role the teleost-specific genome duplication has played in
the evolution of this lineage remains unclear. It is now generally accepted that the genome duplication event(s) that
occurred at the origin of vertebrates played a major role in
species diversity and, in particular, the huge increase in vertebrate morphological complexity [65,66]. In contrast, the
more recent teleost specific genome duplication does not
appear to have had the same effect, with arguably less complexity in the teleost anterior-posterior axis than in tetrapods
[5]. Speciation in teleosts though is unmatched among
descendants of other vertebrate lineages, with over 22,000
known species, making up over half of all extant vertebrates
species [67]. This has led to suggestions that the genome
duplication event may be directly responsible [14,68].
Indeed, evidence presented in a review by Taylor et al. [13]
indicates that ployploidized members of the Salmon family
and Catostomidae (sucker fish) exhibit higher degrees of speciation than members of the same family that remain diploid.
Subfunctionalization has been proposed as a likely mecha-

Materials and methods

To verify that these genes were phylogenetically co-orthologous to mammalian copies we carried out multiple alignments of each pair of Fugu proteins together with available
orthologs from human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken using
CLUSTALW (v1.83) [71] downloaded from Ensembl Compara
(v36) unless otherwise stated. In addition we used all available orthologs from zebrafish. Two of these are previously
experimentally characterized co-orthologs and were downloaded from the SwissProt protein database (pax2.1,
PAX2_BRARE; pax2.2, O93370; sox1a, Q4V997; sox1b,
Q2Z1R2). The remaining novel zebrafish orthologs were
downloaded using Ensembl Compara. In the cases of BCL11A,
FIGN and ZNF503 only a single ortholog was identified by
Ensembl. In the case of EBF1, no zebrafish ortholog could be
identified, and was, therefore, replaced by a single ortholog
from the stickleback genome. The closest available invertebrate ortholog of each gene in either Ciona (ci), Drosophila
(dm) or Caenorhabditis elegans (ce) was used as an outgroup
(BCL11A, LD11946p (dm); EBF1, coe (ci); FIGN, CBG21866

reports

Regulatory subfunctionalization is considered to be a major
mechanism for the retention of gene duplicates in the
genome. This work provides the first large-scale identification and analysis of putative cis-regulatory elements through
comparative genomics between duplicated genes using the
Fugu genome as a model. Using seven pairs of fish-specific
gene duplicates we showed that all pairs have undergone a
level of element partition consistent with one of the main
mechanisms proposed for regulatory subfunctionalization. In
addition, the regulatory elements in this study may have
undergone more subtle levels of subfunctionalization through
differential loss of element content and asymmetrical rates of
substitution. In addition to presenting this work as an analysis in its own right, the methods in this study can be extended
to any similar study in which regions derived from an intragenomic duplication can be compared to one or more related
genomes in which the orthologous region has remained
single-copy.

up of hits from two non-contiguous Fugu scaffolds (that is,
two separate locations in the Fugu genome) were considered
further. Previously, we reported that the genes found closest
to CNEs are statistically over-represented for Gene Ontology
(GO) annotations [70] relating to transcriptional regulation
and/or development (trans-dev) [26]. Genes within each of
these clusters in the human genome (including the closest
gene either side of the cluster) were considered to be transdev if they contained any of these over-represented GO annotations. To avoid ambiguities in associating CNEs to genes,
we selected only those regions containing a single trans-dev
gene within the CNE cluster. Ten pairs of Fugu scaffolds conformed to these criteria. Seven regions containing the largest
number of CNEs in addition to well defined orthologous
sequence within each Fugu region (that is, those that contain
genes neighboring the CNE cluster) were selected for further
analysis. These scaffolds contain CNEs that are conserved in
the vicinity of the following trans-dev genes in the human
genome: BCL11A, EBF1, FIGN, PAX2, SOX1, UNC4.1 and
ZNF503. Fugu protein sequences from the corresponding
orthologs were obtained from Ensembl Compara (v36),
except in the case of PAX2 where only partial sequences were
present. In these cases, tBLASTn searches using known protein sequences from zebrafish pax2 co-orthologs pax2.1
(SPTR: PAX2_BRARE) and pax2.2 (SPTR: O93370) were
used to identify the Fugu protein sequence.

Conclusion

Woolfe and Elgar R53.15

comment

nism for this increased rate of speciation since differential
resolution of subfunctions in multiple gene pairs would lead
to reproductive incompatibility due to a reduction in hybrid
fitness [69]. Evidence for such lineage-specific subfunction
partitioning has been demonstrated for a small number of
genes (for example, divergent expression of sox9 in stickleback compared to zebrafish [18]), but large-scale studies will
be required to resolve the degree of subfunctionalization that
took place before and after divergence within the teleost lineage. Furthermore, if lineage speciation is driven by differential subfunctionalization, we might expect the pattern of CRM
evolution and partition/retention for the Fugu genes discussed here to be different to those in other fish species. The
recent release of a number of divergent draft teleost genomes,
including those of zebrafish, medaka and stickleback, should
allow further studies in this direction. Furthermore, the
approach and analysis used in this study can be extended for
use in any situation where genomic regions surrounding
duplicated genes can be compared to an orthologous region
that has remained single copy. This may be particularly useful
for inter-teleost comparisons, where co-ortholog genes have
been differentially retained since the whole-genome duplication prior to the teleost radiation.

paralog could be identified for UNC4.1. A phylogenetic tree
was created from each alignment using the neighbor joining
(NJ) method and 1,000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA v3.1
[72].

Fugu co-ortholog gene nomenclature
F. rubripes is not a good experimental model organism due to
difficulties in captive breeding and experimental manipulation. Consequently, few of its genes have been experimentally
validated. Most gene predictions in the Fugu genome therefore remain novel, uncharacterized and have no current gene
name. For the purposes of this study we decided upon a naming scheme for the Fugu co-orthologs that uses the same
name as the human ortholog (for example, SOX1 = sox1)
together with a number that denotes the specific co-ortholog
(for example, sox1.1/sox1.2). This naming convention is similar to that used in early studies of zebrafish co-orthologs (for
example, pax2.1 [63]) but which has now been superseded by
a naming convention using letters (for example, pax2a)
(ZFIN gene nomenclature guidelines [73]). We therefore used
a number-based nomenclature to distinguish Fugu coorthologs from zebrafish co-orthologs. For those genes in
which zebrafish co-orthologs had previously been
characterized (pax2a/pax2b, sox1a/sox1b) we named Fugu
equivalents by their phylogenetic similarity to these characterized zebrafish genes as ascertained through phylogeny. So,
as an example, PAX2 co-orthologs were identified on Fugu
scaffolds 86 and 59 (assembly v4; Figure 1d). The phylogeny
identified the protein encoded on S86 as closest to zebrafish
pax2a and that encoded on S59 as closest to pax2b (Figure
1c); therefore, the gene on S86 was named pax2.1 and the
gene on S59 was named pax2.2. The rest of the co-orthologous sets that did not have characterized zebrafish equivalents were assigned names randomly. It is important to note
this nomenclature is used purely to distinguish the genes and
has no functional significance.

ment so that the trans-dev gene was in positive orientation
and masked for known repeats and low complexity regions
using RepeatMasker and the relevant species-specific repeat
library. Multiple alignments for the discovery of conserved
sub-sequences located in the same relative order and orientation were carried out using the MLAGAN alignment toolkit
[75] with translated anchoring and the phylogenetic guide
tree '((human (mouse rat)) fugu)'. Pairwise glocal alignments
to uncover conserved elements that may have undergone
rearrangements (and are, therefore, no longer in the same relative order along the sequence) or inversions between Fugu
and all other organisms utilised in the MLAGAN alignment
were carried out in a pairwise fashion using Shuffle-LAGAN
[76] with default parameters. Each pair of Fugu co-orthologous regions was aligned to the same orthologous mammalian sequence. CNEs were identified from the alignments
using the VISTA program [77] as regions with at least 65%
identity over 40 bp using Fugu as the baseline sequence.
CNEs were filtered further to include only those that were
conserved in human and at least one rodent.

Identification of overlapping and distinct CNEs
between Fugu co-orthologous regions
The human sequence was used as a reference in order to
ascertain whether CNEs identified from each co-ortholog
region overlapped the same human sequence (termed 'overlapping') or were conserved in only one co-ortholog (termed
'distinct'). CNEs between co-orthologs were considered overlapping if the conserved sequence overlapped the same position in the human genome by at least 20 bp. Fugu CNEs that
were defined as 'distinct' to one co-ortholog were used as
query sequences against the alternative Fugu co-orthologous
genomic region using the CHAOS local aligner [75] on both
strands with the following parameters: word length 10, score
cut-off 10, degeneracy tolerance 1, rescoring cut-off 1,000,
and BLAST-like extension on. Resulting alignments were filtered to retain only those with at least 65% identity over 40
bp.

Identification of CNEs in Fugu co-orthologous regions
CNE clusters derived from the whole-genome alignment were
used to define the extent of sequence in both human and Fugu
for use in more sensitive multiple alignments. Regions up to
the next known gene from the most peripheral CNEs in each
cluster were extracted in both human and Fugu using the
Ensembl API [74]. Special attention was paid to include the
same orthologous region between co-orthologous pairs to
ensure equivalent comparison. In situations where the full
extent of the region could not be identified in one of the coorthologs due to the location of the region at the end of a scaffold (for example, scaffold_86, znf503.1; Additional data file
1), only CNEs identified up to the same orthologous region
(estimated by the presence of nearby genes) in the second coortholog were used for comparative analyses. Orthologous
sequences corresponding to each human region were similarly extracted in mouse (assembly v34) and rat (assembly
v3.4). All genomic sequences were orientated prior to align-

Evolution of overlapping CNEs
Element length
To ensure equivalent comparison, the length of the human
CNE was used when measuring changes in element length
between CNEs conserved in both co-orthologs. For each pair
of overlapping CNEs with a one-to-one relationship (that is,
each CNE overlapped one other CNE), the proportion (P) of
the length of the overlap compared to the full length of each
CNE was calculated using:
P = ov/len
where ov is the length of the overlap between co-orthologous
CNE (in bp) and len is the full length of the CNE. Values of P
that tend towards 1 indicate all or the majority of the element
is contained within the overlap while those tending towards 0

comment

To compare the evolutionary rates of Fugu co-orthologous
copies against the single human copy (representing the
ancestral sequence) we used all 'overlapping' co-orthologous
CNEs. For those CNEs that did not have a one-to-one relationship (for example, in cases where two or more CNEs in
one region overlapped a single CNE in another) we treated
each individual overlap region independently. Multiple alignments were created for each co-ortholog CNE individually
together with orthologous sequence from human, mouse, rat,
dog and chicken (where available) to produce the best mapping of orthologous bases. The human sequence from the
overlap detected was used to extract corresponding sequence
within each multiple alignment for each co-orthologous Fugu
copy together with those of orthologous sequences from the
other vertebrates. These sequences were then realigned
together using DIALIGN (v2.2) [78] and all gapped positions
removed using the Gblocks program (v0.91b) [79]. A Tajima
relative rate test of each pair of Fugu co-orthologous copies
against the single human sequence was carried out as
described in [57]. Only sequences that showed at least 4 independent changes in one of the elements and a p value ≤ 0.05
were considered to have undergone significant change.
