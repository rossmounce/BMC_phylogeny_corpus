information

The complete genome sequences of various eukaryotic model
organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana
and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, have revealed a large
number of novel genes of unknown functions. In S. cerevisiae, for example, around 1,800 genes (of the total of around
5,800) encode proteins that so far remain functionally
uncharacterized (compilation from Saccharomyces Genome
Database (SGD) [1] April 2004). Since the completion of its
DNA sequence [2], the genome of S. cerevisiae has been
extensively studied, serving as a test case for novel and impor-

interactions

Background

refereed research

We have screened the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fragments that confer a growthretardation phenotype when overexpressed in a multicopy plasmid with a tetracycline-regulatable
(Tet-off) promoter. We selected 714 such fragments with a mean size of 700 base-pairs out of
around 84,000 clones tested. These include 493 in-frame open reading frame fragments
corresponding to 454 distinct genes (of which 91 are of unknown function), and 162 out-of-frame,
antisense and intergenic genomic fragments, representing the largest collection of toxic inserts
published so far in yeast.

cooperative effort between European and American labs, a
nearly complete collection of deletion mutants of all yeast
protein-coding genes is now available [18-20], which offers
the possibility of systematically screening numerous phenotypes, including synthetic lethals [21-23], in search of novel
gene functions.
As a complement to gene inactivation, phenotypic changes
resulting from gene overexpression may also be informative
of gene functions. Indeed, in a number of cases, such as genes
encoding cytoskeletal proteins or protein kinases and phosphatases, overexpression may lead to a lethal phenotype (see
[24] for a review). The overexpression approach is complementary to the loss-of-function approach, as it leads to dominant phenotypes even in the presence of the wild-type gene,
thus allowing the study of genes for which no loss-of-function
mutants can be obtained. Overexpression of gene fragments
can be equivalent to 'dominant negative mutation' in which
the fragment disrupts the activity of the wild-type gene [25].
Overexpression can also activate specific pathways, leading to
deleterious phenotypes: examples include genes involved in
the yeast pheromone response pathway, such as STE4, STE11
and STE12 (see [24,26] and references therein). In other
cases, specific effects are not known, but the region responsible for toxicity has been identified. For example, lethality
upon overexpression of Rap1p depends on the presence of the
DNA-binding domain and an adjacent region [27]. In general,
however, unless the domain structure of the protein is well
understood, one cannot predict which segment(s) of it would
act as a dominant mutant when overexpressed.
Several yeast cDNA libraries have been screened for lethal or
impaired growth phenotypes upon overexpression under the
control of the GAL1 or GAL10 promoters on centromeric or
multicopy plasmids [28-30]. Other libraries of random
genomic DNA have also been screened for toxicity upon overexpression from the same promoters [24,26]. Whereas the
four earlier studies each identified only a few genes (from 1 to
24 each, making a grand total of 43), Stevenson et al. [30]
identified 185 genes (20 of which were shared with earlier
work) that cause impaired growth when overexpressed.
In the work reported here, we have screened the yeast
genome with the aim of characterizing a list of fragments
whose overexpression confers growth impairment. To do this,
we constructed a yeast genomic library in a multicopy plasmid vector in which transcription is driven by a chimeric
tetO-CYC1 promoter [31]. Random genomic inserts of a mean
size of 700 base-pairs (bp) were overexpressed in yeast as
translational fusions using the plasmid-borne initiation
codon. Out of around 84,000 clones tested, we have identified the largest collection yet of toxic overexpressed fragments in yeast: 714 showed overexpression-dependent
lethality or various degrees of growth impairments, identifying 454 protein-coding genes (91 of which are of unknown
functions), and a variety of intergenic or other regions.

Results
Screening the library of yeast random genomic
fragments for toxic phenotypes
We have analyzed a total of 84,086 independent yeast transformants, each of which contains a random fragment of the
yeast genome placed under the control of a doxycyclinrepressible promoter (Figure 1a,1b). Effects on growth or survival were monitored by spotting serial dilutions of the transformants in the presence and absence of doxycyclin
(uninduced and overexpression conditions respectively, Figure 1c). Phenotypes were recorded using numerical values
from 0 to 3 (Figure 2): value 3 was assigned to normal growth
(similar to non-toxic control), 2 and 1 were assigned to intermediate growth levels (less abundant and/or smaller-sized
colonies), and 0 was assigned to complete or almost complete
absence of colonies (comparable to the toxic control on the
same plate). We have retained 714 clones (0.85% of total) that
show impaired growth in overexpression conditions (Table 1).
Among these, 112 also show a slight or severe growth reduction (level 2 for 77 cases, or level 1 for 35 cases, respectively)
in unexpressed conditions. Proof that the observed growth
defects were caused by the presence of the plasmid rather
than an accidental mutation in the clone was directly demonstrated by the recovery of the wild-type phenotype after plasmid loss using selection for resistance to 5-fluoroorotic acid
(5-FOA) (Figure 2).

Identification of the genomic inserts conferring toxic
phenotypes
Inserts of the selected clones were identified by DNA
sequencing (Materials and methods). The complete list of
inserts is described in Additional file 1 and 2, and results are
summarized in Table 1. A majority of inserts (493, or 69% of
total) carry in-frame portions of annotated open reading
frames (ORFs), excluding Ty and Y' ORFs. In addition, a significant number of inserts (162 (23%)) correspond to fragments of ORFs cloned either in antiparallel orientation or
out-of-frame with respect to the initiator ATG codon or to
intergenic regions. The 59 remaining cases (8% of total) correspond to fragments of transposable elements (17 clones)
and subtelomeric Y' elements (9 clones), to RNA-coding
genes (4 clones), and to non-chromosomal replicons such as
the 2 mm plasmid and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (29
clones). If any random fragment of the yeast genome were
capable of generating a toxic phenotype, in-frame ORF
fusions would represent only around 10-12% of the selected
inserts (around 70% of the genome correspond to coding
regions, and only one frame out of six corresponds to the natural frame). The fact that the toxic inserts correspond principally to in-frame portions of natural ORFs suggests that the
coding part of the genome is the most prone to confer toxicity
when overexpressed.

Analysis of domains within in-frame ORF fragments
The 493 inserts corresponding to in-frame ORF fragments
represent 454 distinct annotated ORFs (see Materials and

three times and one ORF (YHR056c in the CUP1 region) was

Overexpression library construction and screening
Overexpression library construction and screening. (a) Construction of an HA-tagged vector. The pCMha190 vector used here was constructed by
insertion of a linker (gray box) in place of the multiple cloning site in vector pCM190 [31]. Features shown include the promoter and TATA box as well as
the terminator from the original plasmid (open boxes), and the start codon, HA-tag, BamHI site and stop codons (thick vertical bars) from the introduced
linker sequence. The linker was composed from the following annealed oligonucleotides: EXP3: 5'GATCGTTTAAACCATATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGG ATCCTGACTGACTGATC-3', EXP4: 5'GGCCGATCAGTCAGTCAGGATCCAGCGT AGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACATATGGTTTAAAC-3'. (b) Library construction in pCMha190
(see Materials and methods for experimental details). The resulting ligation product is schematized, with the insert as a striped box and adaptors as
hatched boxes. Sequences shown below are from junctions, with uppercase letters corresponding to vector (the extra nucleotide from filling-in is
underlined), lowercase letters to adaptors and bold nnn's to insert. Arrows indicate the different primers used: SEQ8 and SEQ4 are used for PCR
amplification of the insert, and SEQ1 for sequencing (see sequences in Additional data file 8). (c) First-round screening of toxic phenotypes. The growth of
random and control clones on selective medium in uninduced and overexpression conditions is shown. Drops of serial dilutions (1/100 to 1/100,000) of
cultures were grown for 45 h at 30°C. A3, non-toxic control clone transformed by pCMha190; H1, toxic control clone transformed by MCM1 gene cloned

of doxycycline were scored as described in the text. Each clone was assigned a growth index where the first number represents the growth in uninduced
conditions and second number the growth in induced conditions; for example, 3/3 indicates a non-toxic insert; 3/0 indicates a highly toxic insert. Clone
numbers are the same as in the tables describing the toxic inserts (see Additional file 1,2,3,4). (b) After 5-FOA-induced plasmid loss, growth of surviving

upstream of the natural ATG initiator codons, lengthening
the natural peptides by reading in-frame through the
untranslated region. Other cases correspond to the central
coding region of natural genes.
To find possible common characteristics, we have compared
between themselves all the peptides encoded by in-frame
ORF fragments. BLASTP analysis was combined with detection of characterized conserved domains, of COG patterns
(clusters of predicted orthologous groups of proteins [32]),
and of transmembrane spans (TMS) to identify toxic inserts
similar to each other (see Materials and methods). Out of the
493 in-frame ORF fragments, a total of 170 were divided up
into 57 distinct groups of similarity, containing from two to 12
inserts, including overlapping fragments of the same ORF
(see Additional file 4). It is expected that several ORFs from a
same paralogous gene family are found in a same group. Note
that in 16 out of 57 groups, the inserts contain transport-specific domains and/or transmembrane spans.
As well as comparing inserts to each other, we also analyzed
the totality of the conserved domains present in all peptides

encoded by the 493 toxic inserts (see Materials and methods).
Characterized domains are found, at least partially, in a total
of 281 inserts (see additional file 1 and 3). Of a total of 183 distinct domains, 46 are represented more than once. We have
compared the frequency of these 46 domains among the toxic
inserts versus their frequency among the 5,803 ORF-encoded
proteins of the entire genome (Table 2). We find that 37
domains are significantly over-represented compared to a
random expectation, suggesting that we have screened specific domains.
These 37 domains correspond predominantly to various
transporter domains (11 cases), such as amino-acid permeases and mitochondrial carrier protein domains. The
toxicity of these domains is probably due to the presence of
transmembrane spans. Indeed, 132 out of the 493 toxic peptides contain at least two transmembrane spans, including
cases where one span is putative (see Materials and methods).
Among these, 63 contain three or more predicted spans and
26 have five spans or more. Putative spans were also recognized in 84 other ORF fragments (seven with at least three

interactions

Other important domains for interactions with polypeptides,
phospholipids or small molecules (nine cases) are also overrepresented. The WD40 motif, a propeller-like platform for
stable or reversible binding of proteins in eukaryotes, has
been found in inserts of 12 distinct ORFs (see additional data
file 3). The 12 ORFs code for proteins having interactions with
other proteins in complexes related to RNA processing or
transcription [10], and nine have at least one partner also
selected during our screening (see Discussion). Other interacting domains were found, such as dynamin, MRS6, and
adaptin_N domains, which have roles in the dynamics of proteins, membranes and cytoskeleton, and PBD, a small domain
which binds small GTPases and inhibits transcription activation. The PH domain, which binds phosphoinositides or other
ligands and is involved in signal transduction, was found in
inserts of three distinct ORFs involved in different functions:

The serine/threonine protein kinase domain (S_TKc) is significantly under-represented in our screen. Among the 10
toxic inserts whose cognate genes code for protein kinases
(PK), only four contain this domain (Additional data file 3). In
these four cases, the S_TKc domain is either truncated (Additional data file 4), or flanked by a coiled-coil region and/or a
low-complexity segment. Two other inserts contain the PBD
(and PH) domains, and the four remaining inserts contain no
characterized domain to date. As it is known that overexpression of some protein kinases is deleterious for cells (see [24]
and references therein), our results suggest that a domain different from the catalytic domain is responsible for the toxicity
of these proteins, and that the fragments selected in our
screen have a role in binding ligands such as substrates or
regulators of protein kinase activity, or of proteins involved in
the signaling cascades. Three other genes coding for protein
kinases of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI kinase) family are also represented in our screen by four toxic inserts,
none of which contained the kinase domain (see Discussion).

refereed research

RNA-and DNA-binding domains (nine cases) involved in replication, transcription or translation functions, such as PUF,
KH and rrm, are also much more represented than expected
(Table 2). The PUF domain is also involved in recruitment of
proteins into a complex that controls mRNA translation (see
[33] for review).

metabolism and other functions (eight cases), of which several may be involved in interactions with other domains.

In addition to the domains described above, we found toxic
inserts coding for natural peptides without recognizable
domains but containing regions of low complexity (56 cases).

We have seen above that 493/714 toxic inserts are in-frame

454 genes corresponding to these toxic inserts is given in

information

Nature of the selected genes

A number of these peptides are highly charged, either negatively or positively (see Additional data file 3). Such charged
peptides might interact in an artifactual way with other
charged domains of proteins or nucleic acids or with small
molecules. Interestingly, the prion-like (Q+N)-rich domain
was found in eight of the natural peptides having low-complexity regions.

interactions

The remaining 137 domains (out of 183) were found only once
each. Many correspond to functional categories described
above, such as transport, metabolism, and interactions with
nucleotides, other proteins or other ligands. Seven domains
associated with ubiquitination functions were also found (see
Additional data file 3 and 5). Several of the domains encountered have also been isolated as mammalian genetic suppressor elements (GSEs), which are cDNA fragments that inhibit
cell growth (see [34] and references therein).

refereed research

Peptide sequences of toxic natural ORF fragments were searched for domains (see text), and the frequency of domains found more than once was
compared to the frequency in the whole proteome. References and names of domains are in the first two columns; occurrences in the whole
genome (S. cerevisiae) and in the toxic inserts are in the third and fourth columns, respectively. The next three columns show the statistical analysis
performed as follows: 1,000 random selections of 843 domains (total number of occurrences in the toxic inserts) were made from the set of 15,925
domains identified in S. cerevisiae (see Materials and methods); mean (column 5) represents the mean number of occurrences of each domain among
the toxic inserts; the 95% confidence interval (column 6) was calculated using the SD of the 1,000 random drawings; column 7 shows the result of
this analysis for each domain: NS, not significant; +, domain over-represented in toxic inserts; -, domain under-represented in toxic inserts. The last
column gives a brief description of domains from NCBI Conserved Domain Database [65]. *KOG0446 was found using cdd.v1.63 of NCBI CDSearch [64].

and 14,733 bp. The mean size of this distribution is 2,401 bp
(standard deviation (SD) 1,671 bp), to be compared with a
mean size of 1,444 bp (SD 1,094 bp) for the entire set of 5,803
ORFs of the yeast genome. The bias towards longer ORFs is
expected from our cloning strategy (see above). Note that the
35 ORFs that we found more than once are nearly randomly
distributed in various size classes.
We examined the distribution of these genes according to different criteria, such as function, subcellular localization, viability and phylogeny (Table 3) and compared it to the
distribution of the genes of S. cerevisiae.
Among the 454 ORFs identified, 91 are unclassified, and function is not yet clear for six others (see Additional data file 3).
The remaining ORFs represent a variety of functional classes
(Table 3). Distribution of the 454 ORFs shows statistically
significant deviations for eight out of the 15 functional classes,
taking into account biases due to mean size of genes in each
class. Globally, there is a deficit of genes involved in protein
synthesis and of unclassified genes, and an excess of genes
involved in transport facilitation and cellular transport (echoing the fact that we found many inserts containing transporter domains and transmembrane spans), in cell fate, in
transcription and, to a lesser extent, in cell cycle/DNA
processing and in homeostasis (regulation of/interaction
with the environment).
As seen above, many toxic inserts contain multiple predicted
TMS. Such inserts correspond most often to genes coding for
transporters or for non-transporter membrane proteins [35].
We have selected a total of 96 transporters (see Additional
data file 3) of which 18 belong to the class of putative uncharacterized transporters, whose toxic inserts contain several
TMS. Fourteen others belong to the class of transporters of
unknown classification, including 13 genes of the nuclearpore complex family, whereas there is a total of 58 genes in
this family in the whole genome. On the other hand, 24 genes
coding for non-transporter membrane proteins were also
selected. Taken together, 120 transporters and non-transporter membrane proteins are represented in our screen,
twice as many as expected (61 expected), as 782/5,803 ORFs
are known or predicted as coding for such proteins [35].
The distribution of the proteins encoded by these genes in the
cell is strongly biased in favour of the plasma membrane and
against the cytoplasm, and, to a lesser extent, in favour of
nucleus and cytoskeleton (Table 3).
Although the majority of inserts originate from non-essential
genes, we have found 96 essential genes (21%) among the
selected ORFs. This is a significantly higher percentage than
in the whole genome, where 939/5,803 genes (16.2%) are
essential (Table 3).

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R72

Using the classification from Malpertuy et al. [36] and additional updating (Génolevures [37]), we find that the majority
of genes yielding toxic fragments in this work are conserved
(336/454 (74%)) between S. cerevisiae and other sequenced
organisms, whereas 106 (23%) are ascomycete-specific and
10 (2.2%) are orphan genes. This distribution is significantly
different from the distribution among the 5,803 genes of S.
cerevisiae, where 64% of protein-coding genes are conserved
(see Table 3). The under-representation of orphan genes in
our screen is already apparent in the under-representation of
functionally unclassified genes, as a high rate of orphans of
the whole genome (79%) are also unclassified (data from
Génolevures [37] and Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequences (MIPS) [38]).

Toxicity of entire genes versus ORF fragments
To compare the phenotypes conferred by overexpression of
the entire gene and of the gene fragment, we have cloned the
cognate entire genes of 13 in-frame toxic inserts into the vector pCMha191 (see Materials and methods). One criterion for
the choice of the genes was the absence of a mutant phenotype of the corresponding gene disruption at the time this
work was started, except for the NOP4 gene whose disruption
is lethal. Six of these genes are singletons; three others have a
paralog already known as toxic upon overexpression. Six out
of the 13 still have no known function to date (Table 4).
Expression at the protein level of both entire gene and gene
fragment was verified by western-blot analysis, using an antihemagglutinin (HA) antibody (data not shown). As seen in
Table 4 and Figure 3, we found that overexpression of 10
genes was as toxic or more toxic than overexpression of the
gene fragments. One gene, YGR149w, was less toxic in its
entire version than in the truncated form, which was weakly
toxic. Finally, we found that two genes, YML128c/MSC1 and
YDL112w/TRM3, showed no toxicity when overexpressed,
whereas the cloned inserts were strongly toxic. In these two
cases, the immunolocalization of overexpressed products was
examined, and the cytoplasmic localization of the fragment
agreed with the location of the natural gene product (data not
shown), indicating that the toxic effect is not the result of mislocalization of the overexpressed fragment. The gene MSC1
had already been screened [24] as a toxic fragment in overexpression conditions, the region concerned being the same as
in our screening. This gene has low similarity to a stress protein of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and has a role in meiotic
recombination. The TRM3 gene contains a carboxy-terminal
domain responsible for tRNA methyltransferase activity [39],
which is absent from our insert. The protein is a member of a
complex probably involved in signaling [10].

Analysis of other fragments
Additional data file 2 analyzes the 221 other toxic inserts
which do not correspond to in-frame fragments of annotated
ORFs. Sixty-eight inserts correspond to natural ORF fragments cloned in an antiparallel orientation, most of them
being entirely included within the ORF sequence (47 cases),

The distribution of genes was examined in respect of four classifications: function, cellular localization of the gene product, viability and phylogeny.
Data are from MIPS [38] and Génolevures [37]. Cellular localization was known for 3,928 out of the 5,803 proteins in the entire genome and for 319
proteins out of the 454 that yield toxic inserts. For other comparisons, the set of 454 selected genes was compared to the set of 5,803 genes of S.
cerevisiae. Note that a given gene may be present in more than one MIPS class. Significant evidence that a given gene class is over-or underrepresented among toxic genes as compared to all S. cerevisiae genes is emphasized by bold characters. *p < 0.005; †p < 0.025.

the others overlapping the intergenic upstream region of the
natural ORF (17 cases) and sometimes the next gene as well
(four cases). Their toxicity can result either from the overexpression of an antisense RNA or from the overexpression of a
toxic artificial peptide encoded by a fortuitous ORF. Several
arguments favor the second hypothesis. First, short ORFs
longer than 24 codons (maximum observed 250 codons), and
in-frame with the start codon of the cloning vector, are
observed in 53 cases (78% of the total). A number of those

artificial ORFs are due to the 'mirror' effect produced by
codon-biased natural ORFs [40,41]. But the fact that they are
observed more than one-third of the time suggests a positive
selection for toxic artificial peptides. Second, antiparallel
ORF fragments do not correspond to a majority of essential
genes, as might be expected from antisense RNA inhibition.
Third, we have directly verified, for two inserts recloned in the
same vector, that addition of a stop codon that blocks translation of the artificial ORF also suppresses toxicity (see Addi-

information

In total, short artificial peptides may be encoded by 92 out of
the 162 inserts described above. Comparison of the 92 peptides between themselves reveals several low-complexity
sequences (see Additional data file 2), mostly encoded by
antiparallel ORF fragments whose direct amino-acid
sequence is itself of low complexity. Comparison with the proteins of S. cerevisiae and of all available sequenced organisms

Among the 59 remaining inserts, 17 belong to Ty elements, 10
of which are in-frame ORF fragments corresponding to TyB
only (two of them containing the carboxy-terminal part of the
rve domain (integrase core)), whereas all antisense fragments
(three inserts) correspond to TyA. Y' elements, which are
present in 20 copies in the genome, are represented by nine
inserts, all coding for highly basic or acidic peptides (of which
three are in-frame fragments of natural ORFs) which contain
repeats of amino acids or motifs, and confer a strongly toxic

interactions

Fifty-three additional inserts correspond to natural ORF fragments cloned out-of-frame with respect to the plasmid-borne
ATG codon, of which only 12 code for artificial ORFs longer
than 24 codons (see Table 1 and Additional data file 2). Intergenic regions are represented by 41 inserts, of which 27 (65%
of total) code for short artificial ORFs.

compiled in our internal database (GPROTEOME3, see Materials and methods) reveals no significant similarity. None of
these artificial ORFs corresponds to the 137 new annotated
yeast genes of Kumar et al. [42], to the 62 new genes of Oshiro
et al. [43] or to the 84 genes of Kessler et al. [44]. Even though
we have no evidence for antisense RNA activity, we cannot
exclude a toxic effect due to the overexpressed transcript
itself.

inserts are toxic, their observed number is not different from
that expected from the size and number of Y' in the genome.
Four inserts from yeast chromosome XII are fragments of
genes coding for 18S or 25S RNA, two inserts being cloned in
the sense orientation. The 2 mm plasmid is represented by 17
fragments, 10 of which are in-frame fragments of ORFs coding for REP1, REP2 and FLP1. The seven other inserts are outof-frame or antisense fragments of FLP1, or fragments of
intergenic regions, all (except two) coding for artificial ORFs.
Finally, mtDNA is represented by 12 fragments, mostly corresponding to intergenic regions on the minus strand of the
chromosome. Artificial peptides highly enriched in the amino
acids tyrosine (Y), isoleucine (I), and lysine (K) are encoded
by 10 out of the 12 mitochondrial inserts.

Discussion

The general fitness of living organisms largely depends on a
harmonious equilibrium between the various cellular components and on their capacity to maintain homeostasis. The
intricate circuitries that regulate gene expression form the
basis of these properties, and massive deregulation of single
components may result in flagrant phenotypic defects leading
to serious growth impairment or even cell death. Our largescale screening of the yeast genome using random genomic
fragments resulted in a collection of several hundreds of
inserts showing toxic effects on cell survival or growth when
overexpressed. These toxic effects are expected to result from

several distinct molecular situations that have been encountered at various frequencies in our experiments. Of the total
of 714 toxic inserts studied, a majority (69%) correspond to
the overexpression of fragments originating from natural
protein-coding genes (454 genes were identified in total). But,
interestingly, a large minority (23%) correspond to noncoding DNA fragments. The remaining cases (less than 10% of
the total) correspond to fragments of Ty or Y' elements, of the
2 µm plasmid or of mtDNA which, after analysis, can be
attributed to one of the two previous categories. Toxic fragments of natural gene products are interesting to consider
with respect to the functions of the corresponding genes. But
the second category may be even more promising in that it
offers us a description of DNA sequences that cannot be overexpressed in a cell without a deleterious effect.
The toxicity of coding fragments may result from the imbalance between products of tightly controlled genes, or from the
titration of active complexes by the presence of truncated proteins and/or isolated domains. In addition, nonspecific
effects might also exist, for example, as a result of an abnormal intracellular localization of an artificially overabundant
peptide or protein. We did not attempt to distinguish experimentally between these possibilities for all the coding inserts
isolated in this work. Taking into account only specific effects,
in the limited number of cases in which the entire gene
corresponding to a toxic insert was cloned in the overexpression vector (see Results), we verified that toxicity was due, in
most cases, to the disruption of the precise dosage of an
essential cellular component (the entire protein is also toxic

The biases we have observed show little overlap with previous
screenings of S. cerevisiae, which had previously identified a
total of 231 genes or gene fragments that were toxic when overexpressed [24,26,28-30,49]. Among the 185 genes of Stevenson et al. [30], those involved in protein synthesis are
represented twice as frequently as in the whole genome,

The finding of a large minority of toxic inserts corresponding
to noncoding DNA is puzzling. Indeed, some of the toxic
inserts originate from annotated but questionable ORFs, and
some originate from antisense or intergenic fragments which
can artificially be translated into small ORFs. None of these
peptides has recognizable characterized domains, but many
of them are charged, mostly positively (see Additional data
file 2) and some have amino-acid sequences of low complexity. It could be proposed that all these small ORFs represent a
reservoir of potentially new gene sequences in the genome. In
addition, 100 of the in-frame toxic inserts had no characterized domains and sometimes no predicted secondary structure. These inserts do not contain conserved domains, COGs
or TMS, and are not biased in amino-acid composition (see
Additional data file 3). They may correspond to domains that
have not yet been described, or to domains whose structure
has diverged, but another possibility would be that some protein domains are perhaps not structured in a permanent way
before evolving towards a structurally functional domain.
Interestingly, a significant proportion of the expressed peptides we selected are specific to ascomycetes, or are even true
orphan genes that have no known homolog in any other species than S. cerevisiae. A collection of toxic polypeptides, act-

reports

As our results also showed a bias towards a number of interaction domains, we have examined the known interactions of
the proteins encoded by the 454 genes found in this screen
(see Materials and methods). Genetic interactions were also
considered, excluding the coexpression results obtained in
microarray experiments. It appears that 88.3% of our genes
(401/454, of which 70 are of unknown function) code for proteins which have known genetic or physical interactions, or
are members of complexes (see Additional data file 3). Moreover, for 60% of these (242/401), at least one of their known
partners is also found in our screen (see Additional data file 6
and 7). Among the 53 genes having no known interactions, 24
correspond to transporter or membrane proteins (see Additional data file 3).

whereas they are twice less frequent in our own experiment.
In contrast, genes involved in transport facilitation and interactions with the environment were not over-represented in
the Stevenson et al. experiment. Common biases are, however, observed in favor of transcription, cell-cycle and cellular
transport genes. Overall, only 33 of our 454 ORFs were previously identified by the previous authors (the total rises to 78
if one considers individual gene studies). Twenty-five other
genes from the previous screenings not found here are members of paralogous gene families represented in our work (see
Additional data file 3). The limited overlap may result from
partial genome coverage. However, by screening 84,086
clones (a coverage of around 4.5 genome equivalents), we
must have encountered a total of 4,677 ORFs, each being represented 1.6 times as an ORF fragment (see Materials and
methods). We have thus screened for toxicity around 80% of
the natural yeast ORFs. But the limited overlap of results may
also be explained by the experimental bias introduced by each
technique. The previous experiments were mostly based on
cDNA cloning, which favors short and highly expressed
genes, whereas our genomic library favors large ORFs (mean
size 800 ± 557 codons per ORF) and has no expression bias.
In addition, the largest previous experiment [30] was done
using centromeric plasmids and a galactose promoter as
opposed to our multicopy vectors. Furthermore, our serial
dilution drop assay is probably more sensitive to growth alteration than the replica techniques previously used. Finally,
previous overexpression experiments relied on changing the
nutrient composition of the growth medium (galactose vs glucose) whereas our experimental set-up relied on the presence/absence of a drug in a medium of the same nutritional
composition.

reviews

Even in the absence of precise mapping of the toxic domain
present in our clones, we were able to explore the nature of
the domains found in each insert. Our experiment has shown
a bias towards domains corresponding to transport functions
and to various interactions (Table 2). As mentioned in
Results, the toxic effect of transport-specific domains may be
due to the presence of corresponding TMS.

when overexpressed) and, in some cases, to the titration effect
exerted by the incomplete fragment of the natural protein
(the entire protein is not toxic when overexpressed). A few
examples where the domain responsible for toxicity upon
overexpression is known can be found in the literature. In the
case of TOR1 and TOR2 genes, toxicity is specific to a central
domain of the proteins distinct from their carboxy-terminal
protein kinase domain; overexpression of the entire gene has
no effect, and can even cure the negative effect of the overexpressed domain [45]. Alarcon et al. [45] have proposed that
Tor proteins could serve as a scaffold on which to assemble
other proteins for appropriate interaction with the kinase
domain. Our results agree with this hypothesis, as four out of
the five yeast genes belonging to the conserved family of PI
kinase-related protein kinases - TOR1, TOR2, TEL1 and TRA1
- were selected in this work, all represented by inserts of the
central region of these proteins (Figure 4 and Additional data
file 3). In mammalian cells, overexpression of such fragments
of ATM, a homolog of TEL1, also has a negative effect [46]. In
other cases in which overexpression of the entire gene is toxic,
certain domains responsible for the toxicity have been
mapped, for example the Myb DNA-binding domain of RAP1
(see Background), the ZnF C3H1 domain of CTH1 [47] and
the bZIP domain of GCN4 [48]. All these DNA-binding
domains were significantly over-represented in our screen
(Table 2).

ing as genetic suppressor elements and interfering with major
cellular functions, is of interest not only in antifungal
research but also as a means of identifying new domains with
major physiological roles.
Finally, given the large number of inserts encoding very short
ORFs (around 70 amino acids in the groups of antiparallel,
intergene and out-of-frame fragments, and 80 in total, see
Additional data file 2), we cannot exclude the possibility that
some transcripts are toxic through hypothetical mechanisms
that may include, for example, nonspecific interactions with
other cellular or nuclear complexes or through overloading of
some component(s) involved in RNA metabolism.

uracil (SC - URA) always supplemented with 10 µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) (uninduced conditions). Phenotypic tests
were done on solid medium (12 cm × 12 cm plates) containing
70 ml of SC - URA + 10 µg/ml doxycycline (uninduced conditions) or SC - URA without doxycycline (overexpression conditions). Yeast cells transformed by pCMha191 recombinants
were grown at 30°C on SC - tryptophan medium, with or
without addition of doxycycline. Plasmid loss was carried out
on SC plates containing uracil (50 mg/l) and 0.1% of 5fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA).

Vector construction and cloning

Conclusions

In a large-scale phenotypic screening of overexpressed random DNA fragments, we selected around 470 genes (including Ty, Y' and the 2 µm plasmid) whose domains inhibit or
impair growth when overexpressed. Many functional
categories are represented, transporter proteins being especially over-represented, and genes of unknown function represent one-fifth of our selection. Our approach gave access to
genes controlling intracellular and membrane structures, as
well as to genes whose deficiency is compensated for by
genetic redundancy. Comparable approaches, using efficient
phenotyping technology [50] and appropriate screening procedures, could be used for identification of genes involved in
specific functions, such as homeostasis and response to
stress.
We have carried out an analysis of toxic protein domains,
pointing out the importance of binding domains and of protein-protein interactions correlated to regulation of cell
growth and cell division. This provides a large body of data for
targeting more specific studies on the modular construction
of proteins and the role of interaction domains in multicomponent assembly of physiological complexes. Finally, in some
cases, the deleterious effects in our system of inserts that
encode very short ORFs may suggest that overexpression of
some transcripts is also toxic for cell growth.

Materials and methods

Plasmids pCMha184, pCMha189, and pCMha190 were
derived from the centromeric (pCM184, pCM189) or episomal (pCM190) overexpression vectors, containing a tetracycline-regulatable promoter system and URA3 (pCM189,
pCM190) or TRP1 (pCM184) as selection markers [31]. In the
original vectors, a 33 bp BamHI-NotI fragment was replaced
by a synthetic linker with ends compatible with these sites
and introducing an ATG codon followed by an in-frame HAtag, a BamHI cloning site, and stop codons in the three
frames (Figure 1a). The episomal pCMha191 vector was
derived from pCMha184 (TRP1 selection marker) by replacement of the centromere and replication origin with a 2 µm
plasmid replication origin. This was PCR-amplified from
pCMha190 using primers M1 and M2 (see Additional data file
8) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and ligated to the 5,953
bp EcoRI-BglII fragment of pCMha184.
The overexpression system was checked by cloning two short
genes, MCM1 and AUAI (861 and 285 bp respectively), which
are toxic when overexpressed under the control of a GAL1
promoter [29]. Both genes were PCR-amplified from yeast
genomic DNA (see primers in Additional data file 8), cloned
into vectors pCMha189 and pCMha190, and transformed into
yeast strain FYAT-01. Only gene MCM1, cloned in the highcopy pCMha190 vector, had a clear and constant toxic effect
on yeast growth when overexpressed. We thus decided to
build the library into pCMha190 and to choose the MCM1
gene as a control for toxic phenotype in overexpression
conditions.

Strains and media

Thirteen complete genes corresponding to 13 selected toxic
inserts (see Results) and the MCM1 control gene were cloned
into the BamHI digested plasmid pCMha191 (TRP1 marker).
Genes were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA (see primers
in Additional data file 8). For each gene, two independent
plasmids were transformed into yeast strain FYBL2-5D. In
parallel, the same strain was transformed with the plasmids
bearing the corresponding toxic inserts.

The yeast genomic library was constructed using Escherichia
coli DH10B cells (Electromax DH10B, Gibco-BRL).

Two toxic inserts, 156C1 and 57B6, which are antiparallel
fragments of YGL039w and YAL062w/GDH3 ORFs, were
modified by PCR synthesis (see Additional data file 9), then

Total yeast DNA from strain FY1679 (Mata/α, ura3-52/ura352, trp1-∆63/+, leu2-∆1/+, his3-∆200/+) [51] was a generous

trp1-∆63, leu2-∆1) [52] and FYAT-01 (Matα, ura3-∆851,
trp1-∆63, leu2-∆1, his3-∆200, ade2-661) (A. Thierry, unpublished work) were used for transformations and growth defect
screening. All strains are isogenic derivatives of S288C.

Another library had previously been constructed with the
same vector ligated to a distinct DNA-adaptor preparation
and was partially used, giving rise to 160,000 primary clones.
Characteristics of the transformants were the same as
described above. Eight pools of plasmid DNA were prepared
from this first library.

The dependence of the phenotype on the presence of the plasmid was demonstrated using two methods: for 150 tested
clones, wild-type phenotypes were recovered after plasmid
loss using 5-FOA resistance selection; for 35 other clones,
plasmids were extracted from transformed strain FYAT-01
and retransformed into strain FYBL2-5D, in which the toxic
phenotypes were confirmed.

interactions

A total of 51 independent transformations were made. This
corresponds to 1,888,000 clones. We tested 150 clones for the
presence of an insert and observed that more than 85% contained one (average size 700 bp, minimum 220 bp, maximum
1,620 bp). Colonies from each transformation were pooled
and distinct Qiagen Tip 500 DNA preparations were made
and stored separately for yeast transformation. Final concentration of DNA was 300 to 1,300 ng/µl. The detailed protocol
of library construction is available on request.

Transformed yeast clones were transferred into fresh liquid
SC - URA + doxycycline medium in 96-well microplates by
manual picking (30,015 clones) or with the Q-Pix robot
(54,071 clones) for overnight growth. Non-toxic and toxic
control clones (transformed by empty pCMha190 vector and
by vector bearing MCM1, respectively) were also inoculated
into each microplate. Cultures were grown overnight at 30°C
and stored at 4°C before dilutions for phenotypic examination. Screening of the toxic phenotypes after overexpression
was done in a two-round selection, using the 'drop test', which
allowed us to see even slightly impaired growth effects. Tenfold serial dilutions in water were made from each 96-well
culture microplate with a Beckman Biomek 2000 robot, then
manually replicated with the 96-pin Beckman replicator onto
SC - URA + doxycycline and SC - URA plates in parallel (Figure 1c). Clones showing impaired growth in overexpression
conditions were streaked onto SC - URA + doxycycline
medium for colony isolation, then transferred (one subclone
per streak) into a new 96-well microplate and grown for 22 h
at 30°C. This plate served as a mother plate for four culture
microplates which were grown overnight at 30°C (one plate
for the second-round screening, another plate for PCR amplification on colonies for sizing and sequencing the inserts and
two plates for storage at -80°C). For the second round of
screening, cultures were diluted (1/100 to 1/10,000 dilution)
and tested on SC - URA + doxycycline and SC - URA plates in
parallel. Phenotypes in the presence and absence of doxycycline (uninduced and overexpression conditions respectively)
were scored as described in Results and Figure 2. Between the
two rounds of screening, most of the clones conserved a comparable phenotype. For those displaying an important difference, a new subclone was tested again, and the transformant
was rejected if the phenotype revealed was inconsistent.

Identification of the toxic inserts at the nucleotide and
peptide levels
Inserts of the selected clones were PCR-amplified directly
from cultures using primers SEQ4 and SEQ8 (Figure 1b). The
length of each insert was determined by gel electrophoresis
and the 5' junction was sequenced using primer SEQ1. Identification of each insert in our internal database (see below)
was carried out using the DOGEL program [56], adapted by
Nicolas Joly (Institut Pasteur) to our purpose. This program
gives the start position of the insert on chromosomes, the
corresponding genetic object and the start position in the
ORF relative to the natural ATG (see Additional data files 1
and 2). We first verified the sequence at the junction with the
adaptor-insert. Correct in-frame ligation between vector and
adaptor-1 was observed for 632 clones (88.5% of total). For
the remaining 82 clones, base substitutions, and short (one to
three nucleotides) deletions within the adaptor-1 were
observed (nine and 18 cases respectively). A total of 46 cases
of a single G addition at the junction vector-adaptor-1, and 15
partial vector sequence duplicates were found (see Additional
data files 1 and 2). As the incorrect ligations introduced no
stop codon between the initiation codon of the vector and the
first codon of the insert, these clones were conserved for further analysis. In these cases, the start position of the insert
relative to the chromosome and to the ORF coordinates was
corrected manually.
For analysis of in-frame ORF fragments, sequences of peptides encoded by toxic inserts were extracted from the complete sequences of S. cerevisiae proteins, taking the first
amino acid corresponding to the junction with the adaptor as
the starting point and the end of the insert or the last codon of
the ORF as the end point.
Fragments of mtDNA, 2 µm plasmid, and DNA coding for Y'ORFs, Tys, long terminal repeats (LTRs) and RNA were
examined manually for their position relative to the coding
sequences.
Sequences of inserts other than in-frame ORF fragments were
systematically translated into amino-acid sequences from the
junction with the adaptor up to the first stop codon
encountered in the insert. Sequences coding for more than 24
amino acids were internally compared using BLASTP, then
compared to the S. cerevisiae annotated ORFs and to the
308,738 sequences of our internal database (see below).

Databases
Genetic entities corresponding to the toxic inserts were identified by comparison with the DNA sequences of the 16 chromosomes (available in the Comprehensive Yeast Genome
Database (CYGD) at MIPS [38]); with our own interpretation
table containing the coordinates of 6,256 coding sequences
(CDS or ORFs), which comprises the new genes found by
Blandin et al. [57]; with the 2 µm plasmid DNA sequence
[58]; and with the yeast mitochondrial sequence [59]. The set

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/9/R72

of 6,256 ORFs of S. cerevisiae was filtered to eliminate all
spurious ORFs or unlikely real genes, as well as Ty, Y' and
mitochondrial ORFs, yielding a final list of 5,803 ORFs [60].
For all comparisons of the set of 454 toxic ORFs with the set
of ORFs of the entire genome, we used these 5,803 ORFs.
GPROTEOME3 is an updated version of the GPROTEOME
sequence library [61] containing 308,738 predicted protein
sequences from 60 organisms (F. Tekaia, personal
communication).

Analysis of the toxic inserts and of their cognate genes
Comparisons among the peptides encoded by in-frame ORF
fragments were done using BLASTP [62]. Alignments corresponding to E-values equal to or lower than 10-3 were examined individually before validation.
Conserved domains or patterns of COGs [32] were identified
using the NCBI Conserved Domain Search service (CDSearch [63,64]). The NCBI Conserved Domain Database
(cdd.v1.62) [65] contained domains derived from Smart [66]
and Pfam [67] collections, plus contributions from NCBI such
as COGs, leading to 11,088 position-specific score matrices
(PSSMs). A routine was written for extraction of the CDSearch results obtained for the toxic inserts and the 5,803
proteins of the entire genome. The cut-off E-value was chosen
to be equal to or less than 10-4 for most domains, and 10-3 for
short domains (60 amino acids or fewer). Domains were considered as present even when represented only partially. In
describing genes (Table 4) or toxic in-frame inserts (see Additional data files 1, 3 and 4), only one domain (giving the best
hit) was chosen for a given insert, among several possible hits.
In contrast, to compare the frequency of a given domain
among all toxic inserts versus its frequency among the 5,803
proteins of S. cerevisiae (Table 2), all occurrences were taken
into account, giving a total of 843 occurrences among the 493
toxic inserts, and a total of 15,925 occurrences among the
5,803 proteins.
Searches for transmembrane spans (TMS) were done using
TopPredII [68] implemented by Deveaud and Schuerer
(Institut Pasteur), predicting both certain and putative TMS.
The isoelectric points (IEPs) of proteins or peptides were calculated using iep algorithm from the European Molecular
Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) [69].
Descriptions of selected genes and their products were
retrieved from the Yeast Proteome Database [70] (release of
March 2002; this database is no longer freely available), and
from MIPS [38]. Functional classes, cellular localizations and
a list of essential genes were retrieved from MIPS [38]; gene
classes (conserved/asco-specific/orphan) are from Génolevures [37]. Paralogous gene families of S. cerevisiae [57] are
accessible at Génolevures [37] through gene or ORF name.

We consider that our library contains DNA fragments randomly distributed throughout the genome. Out of 84,086
clones tested, 11% (9,530) contain a DNA fragment cloned inframe with the frame of the natural ORF (~68% of the
genome corresponds to coding regions, and only one frame
out of six corresponds to the natural frame), the others containing noncoding, out-of-frame or antisense DNA fragments. If we use the simplifying assumption that all genes are
equally represented among the 9,530 clones (not taking into
account the size diversity of genes), each of the 5,803 ORFs
will be represented 1.64 times (9,530/5,803). The probability
Px of encountering any gene x times is described by a Poisson
distribution:
