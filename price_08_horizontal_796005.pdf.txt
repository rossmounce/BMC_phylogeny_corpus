EvolutionEscherichia coli as regulation factors have paralogs, but these usually arose by horizontal gene transfer rather than by duplication

Abstract
Background: Most bacterial genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from other bacteria
instead of being inherited by continuous vertical descent from an ancient ancestor. To understand
how the regulation of these acquired genes evolved, we examined the evolutionary histories of
transcription factors and of regulatory interactions from the model bacterium Escherichia coli K12.
Results: Although most transcription factors have paralogs, these usually arose by horizontal gene
transfer rather than by duplication within the E. coli lineage, as previously believed. In general, most
neighbor regulators - regulators that are adjacent to genes that they regulate - were acquired by
horizontal gene transfer, whereas most global regulators evolved vertically within the γProteobacteria. Neighbor regulators were often acquired together with the adjacent operon that
they regulate, and so the proximity might be maintained by repeated transfers (like 'selfish
operons'). Many of the as yet uncharacterized (putative) regulators have also been acquired
together with adjacent genes, and so we predict that these are neighbor regulators as well. When
we analyzed the histories of regulatory interactions, we found that the evolution of regulation by
duplication was rare, and surprisingly, many of the regulatory interactions that are shared between
paralogs result from convergent evolution. Another surprise was that horizontally transferred
genes are more likely than other genes to be regulated by multiple regulators, and most of this
complex regulation probably evolved after the transfer.
Conclusion: Our findings highlight the rapid evolution of niche-specific gene regulation in bacteria.

Background

Transcription factors (TFs) bind to specific sites on DNA
where they regulate the expression of target genes and thus
allow bacteria to adapt to a changing environment. In the well
studied bacterium Escherichia coli K12, more than 150 TFs
have been characterized [1] and nearly 100 more are predicted from the genome sequence. Most of the E. coli TFs
include a DNA-binding domain that determines target site
specificity as well as a sensing domain that binds to small
metabolites or to signaling proteins [2]. With the availability
of complete genome sequences from diverse bacteria,
researchers have begun to consider how these TFs and their
binding sites evolved [2-6].

Evolution of regulation by duplication?
Because E. coli TFs form large families of homologous proteins, the interpretation has been that most of them arose by
gene duplication [2,7]. Two TFs from any given family usually
regulate distinct genes and bind to distinct effectors; the
duplicates therefore generally have distinct rather than overlapping functions. However, it has not been clear from previous studies whether the duplicates arose within the E. coli
lineage [8] or were acquired by horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), or how long ago these duplication events occurred.
For example, the ancestral TF might have been transferred to
another lineage, where it diverged and acquired a new function, and could then have been reacquired, to give paralogs
that arose by HGT rather than by duplication within the E.
coli lineage [9]. This is termed 'allopatric gene divergence'.
It has also been proposed that gene duplication is a major
source of regulatory interactions. Although paralogous TFs
usually have different functions, there are many cases in E.
coli in which paralogous TFs regulate the same genes, or paralogous genes are regulated by the same TF, and a few cases
where paralogous genes are regulated by paralogous TFs [4].
Between 7% [2] and 38% [4] of the regulation in E. coli is
reported to have arisen by gene duplication, although another
group reported that this is rare [7]. Also, about one-third of
paralogous genes are reported to have conserved operon
structure [10] and conserved regulatory sequences [3].
Because these studies did not examine whether the paralogs
were closely related and whether the regulation was conserved from an ancestral state, these regulatory similarities
could have evolved independently, instead of being conserved
from the common ancestors of the genes.

Price et al. R4.2

of these regulatory sites are quite old [3,11,12]. This also
implies that these regulatory sites are under strong purifying
(negative) selection.
However, because these studies compared orthologous genes
in E. coli and its relatives, they did not examine the regulation
of recently acquired genes. As most of the genes in E. coli K12
were acquired by HGT after the divergence of the γ-Proteobacteria [13], it is important to consider how acquired genes
are regulated. HGT genes may evolve new regulation after
they are acquired, either because the genes' regulators from
the source bacterium are not present in the new host or
because different conditions in the new host select for different regulation. On the other hand, newly acquired genes
might be more likely to be fixed in the population if they
already contain regulatory sequences that can function in
their new host. Thus, the evolutionary origin of the regulation
of acquired genes also has broader implications for our
understanding of HGT.

Neighbor regulators evolve by HGT?
Finally, it has been observed that many of the regulators in E.
coli are adjacent to operons that they regulate [14]. These
'neighbor regulators' usually regulate just one or two operons,
and the proximity of these regulators to their regulated genes
suggests that HGT might be involved in the evolution of these
regulatory relationships [14]. Furthermore, these neighbor
regulators are often conserved adjacent to their targets in
other genomes [15]. However, as far as we know, there has not
been a direct test of whether neighbor regulation is associated
with HGT.

Evolutionary histories of TFs
To clarify the origins of transcriptional regulation in E. coli,
we conducted a detailed phylogenetic analysis of its TFs. This
allowed us to distinguish paralogs that have been maintained
in the lineage since their duplication from paralogs that were
acquired by HGT. We found that relatively few of the TFs
evolved by duplications within the E. coli lineage. Instead, we
found a surprisingly complex history of HGT for many of the
regulators, especially for the neighbor regulators and the as
yet uncharacterized regulators. Furthermore, these specific
regulators are often co-transferred together with their regulated genes, which allows us to predict regulatory targets. In
contrast, most of the global regulators appear to have ancient
origins in the γ-Proteobacteria.

Evolution of regulatory sites

Convergent evolution of regulatory interactions

The evolution of the regulatory sites that TFs bind to has also
been studied by comparing upstream sequences across E. coli
and its relatives [3,11,12]. It appears that regulatory sites are
usually conserved in close relatives within the family of
Enterobacteria, such as Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and are often also conserved in moderately distant relatives within the γ-Proteobacterial division,
such as Vibrio cholerae or Shewanella oneidensis. So, many

We then analyzed the histories of individual regulatory interactions. To determine whether gene regulation evolves by
duplication, we examined the evolutionary histories of regulatory interactions that are shared between paralogs in one of
the three ways listed above (paralogous TFs that regulate the
same gene, paralogous genes that are regulated by the same
TF, or paralogous genes that are regulated by paralogous
TFs). Specifically, we compared the age of these shared regu-

Genome Biology 2008,

latory interactions with the age of the duplication that created
the paralogs. To date each regulatory interaction, we assumed
that the interaction is no older than the presence of both TF
and regulated gene in the E. coli lineage. We found that the
regulatory similarities between paralogs usually evolved after
the duplication event, rather than being conserved from their
common ancestor, as has been assumed [4]. This shows that
little of the regulatory network was created by duplication.
Furthermore, these similarities between paralogs are much
more common than expected by chance. It appears that gene
regulation is subject to convergent evolution, and so related
genes independently evolve regulatory interactions with the
same (or similar) genes. Although convergent evolution at the
molecular level is usually thought of in terms of protein function, here the key functional features are the genes' upstream
regulatory regions, which independently (and hence convergently) evolve to bind the same regulators or to bind related
regulators. Of course, many TFs bind upstream of multiple
genes, and in most cases those binding sites also evolved
independently. We use the term 'convergent evolution' for
paralogs to emphasize that their binding sites evolved independently, and not by duplication.

Regulation of acquired genes
Because global regulators are strongly conserved and account
for more than half of all known regulatory interactions [1], we
wondered how they relate to HGT genes. We found that HGT
genes tend to be under more complex regulation than native
genes, and the global regulator CRP regulates a higher proportion of HGT genes than of native genes. We identified
cases in which regulatory sites for conserved global regulators
have been conserved across HGT events within the γ-Proteobacteria, but most of the regulation of these HGT genes
appears to have evolved after the transfer event. This illustrates that major parts of the regulatory network evolved
recently under selection. Overall, most of the TFs have been
acquired recently and, even for the global regulators, most of
the binding sites have evolved relatively recently. We provide
a schematic overview of our results in Figure 1.

Results and discussion
Evolutionary histories of transcription factors
Because most TFs belong to large families and have paralogs,
we built phylogenetic trees for the TFs (see Materials and
methods, below) and we manually compared these trees with
the species tree shown in Figure 2. We focused on the period
after the divergence of E. coli from Shewanella, because we
found phylogenetic reconstruction deeper within the γ-Proteobacteria to be impractical. (Most gene trees are poorly
resolved beyond this distance, probably because the phylogenetic signal is reduced once the sequence divergence becomes
too great.) According to our species tree (see Materials and
methods, below), this period comprises about a third of E.
coli's evolutionary history since the divergence of the bacte-

ria, or perhaps 1 billion years. As we see below, much as
changed during this time.
We classified a TF as being acquired by HGT after this divergence if close relatives of the TF were found in more distantly
related bacteria, so that three or more gene loss events would
otherwise be required to reconcile the gene tree with the species tree (for example, see Figure 3; see Materials and methods, below, for details). We classified a TF as being duplicated
within the E. coli lineage if it had a paralog that was closely
related in the gene tree (for example, Figure 4). We classified
a gene as an 'ORFan' if it had no homologs in organisms more
distantly related than Shewanella. The origin of microbial
ORFans is unclear [16], but they might be HGT from an
unknown source. Finally, we classified other TFs as native
(evolving by vertical descent; for example, Figure 5). However, because our criteria for identifying HGT was conservative, there may be undetected HGT events within the 'native'
TFs, as well as ancient HGT before the divergence of E. coli
from Shewanella.
Besides phylogeny, we also classified TFs by their function.
We analyzed characterized transcription factors from RegulonDB 5.6 [1]. We classified the 20 TFs that regulated the
largest number of genes as global regulators. We classified
TFs that regulate adjacent genes as neighbor regulators. To
exclude autoregulation, which is common, we classified TFs
as neighbor regulators only if they regulate adjacent yet distinct transcription units. (Five of the global regulators also
regulate adjacent operons; those were excluded from the
neighbor regulators.) We also considered other characterized
TFs and putative, as yet uncharacterized regulators. We analyzed the history of each of the global regulators, and of a sample of each of the other types of regulators (see Figure 6 and
Materials and methods, below; for data on individual TFs, see
Additional data file 1).
Whereas most global regulators were native genes within the
γ-Proteobacteria, most neighbor regulators have been
acquired after the divergence of the E. coli and Shewanella
lineages (Figure 6). Other characterized regulators were
native, HGT, or duplications within the lineage leading to E.
coli, in roughly equal proportions. Finally, most of the putative regulators were acquired by HGT (Figure 6). Overall, we
found little duplication of TFs within the E. coli lineage. In the
following sections we examine in more detail the global regulators, the neighbor regulators, and the pattern of HGT.

Vertical evolution of most global regulators
We found that 17 out of the 20 global regulators have evolved
vertically since the divergence of E. coli from Shewanella. For
example, as shown in Figure 5, crp has mostly evolved vertically, with no evidence for gene gain and with gene losses only
in the highly reduced genomes of the insect endosymbionts.
There may have been homologous recombination, however.

Evolutionary history of regulators and regulatory interactions
Evolutionary history of regulators and regulatory interactions. (a) Most of the transcription factors (TFs) regulate adjacent genes. These 'neighbor
regulators' are often transferred between related bacteria and are often lost, and so they seem to be niche specific. Neighbor regulated genes are often
regulated by other regulators as well, but this regulation is usually not conserved across horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. (b) Scenarios for the
evolution of regulatory interactions. For each scenario, we show the proportion of known regulatory interactions in E. coli [1] that evolved that way.
Scenario 1: regulatory interactions are conserved after gene duplication in a small fraction of cases. Scenario 2: even when paralogous TFs or paralogous
regulated genes have similar regulatory interactions, this often results from the evolution of similar regulation after HGT, rather than being conserved
from the duplication event. Scenario 3: in some cases, a single region of DNA evolves to bind two paralogous TFs. Unlike scenario 2, this scenario relies
on the similarity of the TFs. Scenario 4: Most TFs, and probably most other genes as well, ultimately arose by a duplication, either within a lineage or by
allopatric gene divergence. Nevertheless, the regulatory interactions are usually not shared with their paralogs. (To estimate a frequency for scenario 4,
we assumed that all genes arose by some kind of duplication.) Separate results for paralogous TFs, for paralogous regulated genes, and for paralogs of both
are given in Table 1.

Our finding that global regulators are gained and lost more
slowly than other regulators complements a report that global
regulators, as defined by their weak DNA binding specificity,
undergo slower sequence evolution than other regulators [3].
However, the previous report used bidirectional best Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) hits to identify orthologous TFs, which can give misleading results [17]. To confirm

that the sequence of global regulators evolves slowly, we
examined 40 evolutionary orthologs of characterized TFs
between E. coli and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. These
orthologs were identified by an automated analysis of
phylogenetic trees [18] and were confirmed by inspection. We
found a clear correlation between conservation (defined as
the BLAST bit score divided by the self score for the E. coli

gene) and the number of genes that the TF is reported to regulate in RegulonDB (Spearman ρ = 0.48, P < 0.002, n = 40;
see Additional data file 2). Thus, global regulators do evolve
more slowly than other regulators, both in terms of gene gain
and gene loss and in their amino acid sequence.

Co-transfer of neighbor regulators with regulated genes
In contrast to global regulators, most neighbor regulators
were acquired by horizontal transfer. Neighbor regulators
were also marginally more likely than other non-global regulators to be HGT (P = 0.06, by Fisher's exact test). To determine whether these neighbor regulators were co-transferred

with nearby genes that they regulate, we considered whether
the TF and regulated gene(s) had xenologs that were near
each other. (Xenologs are homologs that are related to each
other by HGT rather than by vertical descent.) Of the 39
neighbor regulators that we inspected, 27 were classified as
HGT, and 24 of those have been acquired by co-transfer with
one or more of their regulated genes (for example, xapR with
xapA in Figure 3). In contrast, a previous analysis [5] revealed
that bacterial TFs do not usually co-evolve with their regulated genes. The previous analysis relied on bidirectional best
BLAST hits, and for TFs these hits are often spurious [17].

Figure 3
Repeated co-transfer of xapR with xapA, which it regulates
Repeated co-transfer of xapR with xapA, which it regulates. In the presence of xanthosine, xapR activates the transcription of the xapAB operon, which
allows the transport and catabolism of xanthosine [65]. The gene tree shows that xapR forms a well supported clade (80/100 bootstraps) within a larger
family of regulators (COG583). xapR is scattered across the γ-Proteobacteria, within which we identify four acquisition events. For each acquisition, we
show the multiple independent gene losses that would otherwise be required to explain the gene's distribution across the species tree. The gene tree also
places xapR from Shewanella baltica between the sequences from Vibrio spp., which suggests that it could have been acquired separately by the two groups
of Vibrio. However, this potential fifth acquisition event is rejected because of several factors: the bootstrap support is low; a small change to the tree's
topology (one swap) would render the gene tree congruent with the species tree; and the gene might have been transferred from an ancestor of one of
these Vibrio spp. to S. baltica. The xapR tree was computed from amino acid sequences using phyml with 100 bootstraps, four classes of gamma-distributed
rates (with optimized alpha), and an optimized proportion of invariant sites [55]. In the gene tree, the scale bar corresponds to 20% amino acid divergence,
and the internal nodes are labeled with their bootstrap values. The gene context shows gene order only (not spacing or scale).

It has also been proposed that repressors are more likely than
activators to co-evolve with their regulated genes [19]. However, we found that activators, repressors, and dual regulators
were equally likely to be co-transferred with their regulated
genes (see Additional data file 1). The discrepancy might arise
because we looked for co-transfer events, whereas the previous work looked for gene loss events. In other words, the regulators are co-evolving with their genes by HGT, regardless of
the sign of the regulation, but activators are more likely to be
lost, perhaps as the first step toward loss of the entire pathway
[19]. Indeed, both of the regulators whose loss is discussed in
detail in the previous work have undergone co-transfer with
regulated genes (flhDC with fliA and fliD, and malT with
malS; see Additional data file 1). Overall, HGT appears to be
associated with neighbor regulation, and a majority of neighbor regulators have been co-transferred with their regulated
genes.

Most uncharacterized regulators are neighbor regulators
We considered that co-transfer might be used to predict the
function of uncharacterized regulators. To determine
whether such predictions would be reliable, we looked for cotransfer events among the 38 non-neighbor regulators

(including global regulators) that we examined. We also
looked for co-transfer events involving TFs that are known [1]
or predicted [20] to be in operons. We found ten additional
co-transfer events, and in seven of these cases the co-transferred genes are regulated by the TF. (In most of these cases
the TF was not classified as a neighbor regulator because it
was co-transcribed with the regulated genes.) The three
exceptions were as follows: fecR has been co-transferred with
its sensor fecI; alpA has been co-transferred with yfjI as part
of prophage CP4-57 [21]; and the flagellar regulator flhDC has
co-transferred with motAB, which is also involved in chemotaxis. Overall, co-transfer was not a 100% reliable indicator of
regulation, but we found few exceptions relative to the large
number of co-transfer events that did indicate regulation (3
versus 30), and in all cases the co-transferred genes did have
related functions.
We then analyzed, by hand, the evolutionary history of a random sample of 20 uncharacterized regulators. (We chose
genes that contain a putative DNA-binding domain but are
neither characterized nor annotated with another function
[see Materials and methods, below].) We found that most of
these uncharacterized regulators were acquired by HGT (17/

The regulator purR evolved by duplication from the ribose repressor rbsR, itself acquired by HGT
Figure 4
The regulator purR evolved by duplication from the ribose repressor rbsR, itself acquired by HGT. Within the Enterobacteria/Vibrionaceae subgroup of the
γ-Proteobacteria, both rbsR and purR exhibit largely vertical evolution. The closest relatives of rbsR and purR from outside this subgroup of γProteobacteria are associated with genes for ribose utilization and probably function as ribose repressors. The absence of both rbsR and purR from
Buchnera and its relatives and from Sodalis might suggest additional transfer events, but because Buchnera and its relatives have under 700 genes, absence
from this clade is not evidence for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Sodalis is also a reduced genome, with around 2,600 genes, whereas most
Enterobacteria have over 4,000 genes. The purR/rbsR tree was computed from protein sequences with phyml and 100 bootstraps (as in Figure 3).

20; Figure 6). Almost half of them (9/20) were co-transferred
with adjacent genes. This proportion is similar to the proportion of neighbor regulators that are co-transferred (24/39).
(The proportions are not significantly different [P > 0.2, by
Fisher's exact test].) Hence, we predict that most of the as yet
uncharacterized regulators in E. coli are neighbor regulators.
We also predict that most of the uncharacterized regulators
control the expression of just one or two operons, as is seen
for the characterized neighbor regulators [14].

We tried to identify co-transfer automatically by searching for
conserved proximity in distant organisms, but without much
success. We used bidirectional best hits to identify potential
orthologs in those organisms, and although these best hits are
often false positives we hypothesized that testing for conserved proximity would eliminate the false positives. Unfortunately, this automated approach did not identify most of
the co-transferred TFs that we identified manually (data not
shown). Many of the HGT events are between E. coli and
related bacteria (discussed below), and detailed phylogenetic
analysis is required to uncover these HGT events. Conserved

The global regulator crp has undergone predominantly vertical evolution
Figure 5
The global regulator crp has undergone predominantly vertical evolution. Crp has conserved context, and the gene tree is concordant with the species tree
except for the Pasteurellacea and perhaps Sodalis. The incongruent placement of Sodalis is not supported by a nucleotide sequence tree (data not shown).
The deep branching of the Pasteurellacea is strongly supported, and two swaps would be required to make its placement concordant with the species tree.
An insertion of crp into Pasteurellacea is unlikely because of the conserved proximity of the functionally unrelated gene yheT. Instead, the placement
probably reflects homologous recombination or long branch attraction. In any case, this does not affect the lineage leading to Escherichia coli, and so we
classified crp as native. The crp tree shown was computed from protein sequences with phyml and 100 bootstraps (as in Figure 3).

proximity has also been used in combination with orthology
groups (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins [COGs]
[22]) to identify regulatory relationships [15]. That study
made many successful predictions but also had a high rate of
false positives because of the difficulty in automatically placing TFs into orthology groups [15]. Thus, automating the
identification of co-transfer is beyond the scope of this report.

Repeated HGT of regulators between related bacteria
While examining the neighbor regulators, we sometimes
found that close homologs of these regulators had sporadic
distributions in E. coli and its relatives (for example, xapR in
Figure 3). We classified as 'repeated HGT' those genes whose
sporadic distributions implied two or more HGT events
within the γ-Proteobacteria. (As previously, we inferred an
HGT event when three or more independent deletion events
would otherwise be required to explain the distribution
across species of a clade in the gene tree.) By this restrictive
definition, we found repeated HGT between relatives for 17 of
the 39 neighbor regulators that we examined, which indicates
both a strong preference for gene transfer within γ-Proteobacteria and high rates of gene gain for this class of genes.

Previous studies have disagreed as to whether HGT of regulatory genes is relatively common [23] or relatively rare [24].
The study that found that HGT of regulatory genes was rare
relied on clusters that contained only one gene per genome to
define gene families [24]. Such clusters might be difficult to
identify for large families such as TFs. Although we do not
compare the rate of HGT for regulators with the rate of HGT
for other types of genes, we find high rates of HGT for regulators, with the exception of a few global regulators (Figure 6).
Previous studies have also disagreed as to whether HGT
within the γ-Proteobacteria is prevalent [24,25] or not
[13,26]. To confirm that HGT between related bacteria is
common, we used an automated procedure, based on the
presence and absence of close homologs of a gene, to identify
potential HGT events (see Materials and methods, below).
We then considered whether the closest xenologs of these
HGT genes were from related bacteria. We found that these
closest xenologs were far more likely to be from related bacteria than expected by chance (P < 10-15, by binomial test; see
Additional data file 3). Because identifying HGT between
related genomes requires large numbers of genome
sequences, so that the absence of the gene from intermediate
genomes can be confirmed (for example, see Figure 3), too

Evolutionary histories of Escherichia coli TFs
Evolutionary histories of Escherichia coli TFs. We classified characterized regulators as global regulators, neighbor regulators, or other regulators, and we
also analyzed some putative (as yet uncharacterized) regulators. We classified these transcription factors (TFs) as native because the divergence of E. coli
from Shewanella, as acquired by horizontal transfer after that divergence, as ORFan (indicating horizontal gene transfer [HGT] from an unknown source),
or as duplications within the E. coli lineage. For the duplicated TFs, we examined whether they regulate the same genes as their duplicates. For the HGT
regulators, we examined whether they were co-transferred with nearby genes and whether they underwent repeated HGT within γ-Proteobacteria.

few genomes may have been available for previous studies to
observe this trend. For example, we analyzed 87 γ-Proteobacterial genomes, whereas Lerat and coworkers [13] analyzed
only 13 γ-Proteobacteria.

Evolutionary histories of regulatory interactions
Little of gene regulation arises by duplication
As discussed above, most of the TFs that we analyzed appear
to have arisen by HGT events rather than by duplications
within the E. coli lineage. If we extrapolate from the TFs tabulated in Figure 6, and correct for the uneven sampling of different types of regulators, then 33 ± 7 of the 255 regulators in
E. coli arose by lineage-specific duplications, and 163 ± 10
regulators were acquired by HGT. (We estimated these
standard errors by simulating data according to the observed
frequencies within each type of regulator [parametric boot-

strap].) Thus, although bacterial TFs form large families that
often have many representatives within a single genome,
these representatives are largely xenologs that arose by HGT,
rather than being evolutionary paralogs that arose by duplication within the E. coli lineage.
When we examined the few TFs that did arise by lineage-specific duplication, we found that many of them do not share
regulation with their paralogs. We must exclude uncharacterized TFs, and we also excluded autoregulation, which is
reported for over half of the characterized TFs in RegulonDB
and which need not be conserved from the common ancestor
(see below). Out of 12 lineage-specific duplications, six TFs
share one or more regulated genes with their paralogs. Combining these results, we hypothesized that little of gene regulation arises by duplication.

Ancient paralogs rarely conserve regulation from their common
ancestor
In contrast, an analysis by Teichmann and Babu [4] found
that '... more than two-thirds of E. coli ... transcription factors
have at least one interaction in common with their duplicates.' More broadly, they report that, '... more than one-third
of known regulatory interactions [in E. coli] were inherited
from the ancestral transcription factor or target gene after
duplication.' However, they identified distant homologs
within E. coli by analyzing structural domains. Most of these
structural paralogs diverged so long ago that the homology
cannot be identified by protein BLAST (data not shown).
Because gene regulation in bacteria evolves rapidly [5,6,17],
we suspected that these paralogs diverged before the current
regulation of these genes evolved. If this is correct, then these
regulatory similarities between paralogs were not inherited
from a common ancestor, and might instead be due to convergent evolution.
To determine whether the homologs identified by Teichmann
and Babu [4] diverged before their current regulation
evolved, we compared the evolutionary ages of the duplication events and of the gene regulation. In particular, we considered whether one of the duplicated genes had been
acquired by HGT after the duplication event. If HGT occurred
after the duplication event, then because the regulatory relationship cannot predate the coexistence of those genes in the
same genome, the regulation must have evolved after the
acquisition, and hence after the duplication as well.
For example, the response regulators arcA and dcuR (which
is also known as yjdG) were identified as homologs by Teichmann and Babu [4], and they both regulate dctA [27]. As
shown in Figure 7, dcuR and dctA are present in other Enterobacteria but are absent from more distant γ-Proteobacteria
such as Pasteurella, Vibrio, and Shewanella spp., which
shows that these genes were acquired relatively recently.
Because both arcA and dcuR are more closely related to genes
from a variety of distantly related bacteria than they are to
each other (data not shown), they must have diverged from
each other long before the transfer of arcA or dcuR into the E.
coli lineage. Also, although dctA is present in some of the
more distant γ-Proteobacteria, those lineages lack arcA,
which shows that these genes were not in the same genome
until relatively recently. We conclude that the joint regulation
of dctA by ArcA and DcuR must have evolved after the transfer of dcuR and dctA into the E. coli lineage, and long after the
divergence of arcA from dcuR.
We repeated this analysis for 30 randomly selected examples
of shared regulation between homologous genes from Teichmann and Babu [4] (see Additional data file 4). In most cases
we found that one of the genes had been acquired by HGT relatively recently, and from bacteria that do not appear to contain orthologs of the other genes, so that the regulation
presumably evolved after the horizontal transfer event. We

Convergent evolution of regulation of dctA by two distantly-related
Convergent evolution of regulation of dctA by two distantly-related
response regulators. From the gene trees (not shown), we identified
subfamilies that correspond to dctA, dcuR, and arcA. For example, we split
arcA and its relatives from the closely related torR subfamily of response
regulators, which is also present in many γ-Proteobacteria. We show the
presence and absence of these subfamilies within the γ-Proteobacteria.
The coexistence of dcuR and dctA in the genome is relatively recent, which
shows that this regulation evolved after dcuR diverged from arcA.

also identified inconsistent operon structure, which seemed
to be evidence against evolution by duplication. For example,
the paralogous genes tdcE and pflB are both regulated by CRP
and IHF. Because tdcE and pflB are in operons, and because
the first genes of those operons are not homologous (tdcA and
focA), the regulation of the two operons probably arose independently. Alternatively, the first genes could have inserted
between the duplicated genes and their promoters (after the
duplication event), but this seems unlikely. Furthermore,
changes in operon structure are often accompanied by
changes in gene regulation [28]. We confirmed only one of
the 30 interactions as evolving by duplication. Thus, most of
the regulatory similarities between distant homologs are not
inherited from a common ancestor. The pattern that Teichmann and Babu [4] identified might instead reflect convergent evolution.

Closer paralogs rarely conserve regulation from their common
ancestor
To determine whether closer homologs have a tendency
toward shared regulation, we identified homologs within the
E. coli genome by protein BLAST. We required the score from
BLAST to be at least 30% of the self-score for each gene individually. Because this threshold is effective at distinguishing
orthologs within the γ-Proteobacteria from other homologs
[29], this threshold should select for paralogs within the γProteobacteria. Of the 14,993 homologous pairs of proteins in
E. coli K12, this rule selected 1,560 pairs. Given these 'close

paralogs', and the regulatory interactions between genes and
TFs from RegulonDB, we looked for three types of shared regulation between paralogs, as in the report by Teichmann and
Babu [4]. We identified paralogous TFs that regulated the
same gene (for example, ArcA and DcuR regulate dctA; see
above), paralogous genes regulated by the same TF (for example, CRP regulates araE and galP), and paralogous TFs that
regulate paralogous genes (for example, CpxR regulates
ompC and OmpR regulates ompF). As above, we excluded
autoregulation from consideration. A detailed examination of
the interactions is given in Additional data file 5.

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R4

Price et al. R4.11

Across all three types of shared regulation, we found that 14%
of the regulatory interactions in RegulonDB were shared
between paralogs (Table 1). After removing regulation that is
more recent than the duplication event and removing shared
regulation that has inconsistent operon structure, however, it
appears that only 5% to 8% of the interactions actually
evolved by duplication. (The uncertain 3% represent interactions in which the relative age of the duplication and of the
regulation was unclear, and operon structure could not be
used to clarify.) The other 6% to 9% of interactions arose by
convergent evolution between paralogs.

For each case of shared regulation between paralogs, we examined the evolutionary histories of the duplicated genes to determine whether the
regulation was likely to be conserved from the common ancestor. If so, then the regulatory similarity probably evolved by duplication; if not, then the
similarity results from convergent evolution. For cases where two paralogous transcription factors (TFs) regulate the same operon, we also
considered whether the TFs bind to the same site. For cases where two paralogous genes are regulated by the same TF, we also considered whether
the first genes in the operons were homologous, as would be expected for evolution by duplication. The results are tabulated here (see Additional
data file 5 for individual interactions). Because some regulatory interactions are shared with paralogs in more than one way, the totals are smaller
than the sums over the types.

Overall, we found that only 5% to 8% of regulatory interactions arose by duplication within the E. coli lineage. Another
6% to 9% of regulatory interactions reflect independent (convergent) evolution of similar regulation for homologous
genes. Thus, convergent evolution probably accounts for
more of the regulatory interactions than does evolution by
duplication. One caveat in our analysis is that these proportions can be expected to rise as more knowledge of the E. coli
regulatory network becomes available. Missing information
from either of two paralogs will cause any duplication of reg-

Although most TFs were acquired by HGT, we also found that
most of the global regulators are more ancient. Because the
20 global regulators account for about two-thirds of the regulatory interactions in RegulonDB, we wondered how these
global regulators relate to the bulk of E. coli genes, which have
been acquired by HGT.
Because many of the genes in E. coli were acquired by HGT
relatively recently, we hypothesized that these genes would
have less time to evolve complex regulation. In particular, we
expected that HGT genes would tend to be regulated by fewer
TFs than other genes. However, when we examined the regulation (as described in RegulonDB) of HGT genes that were
identified by the automated presence/absence approach, we
found that HGT genes are significantly more likely than other
genes to be regulated by several different TFs (Figure 8). For
example, 68% of HGT genes are regulated by two or more
TFs, but only 57% of the other genes in RegulonDB are regulated by multiple TFs (P < 0.0005, by Fisher's exact test). We
also compared HGT genes with conserved γ-Proteobacterial
genes that are reported not to undergo HGT [29], and we
again found that the HGT genes had, on average, more complex regulation (data not shown).

We also considered autoregulation separately. A recent report
[30] found a weak but statistically significant similarity in
autoregulation within families of TFs. However, among the
close paralogs, we did not find any similarity between paralogs in their tendency to autoregulate. More precisely, we
considered pairs of close paralogs of TFs and we considered
whether autoregulation was correlated for these pairs. We did
not find an effect (odds ratio 1.15; P > 0.5, by Fisher's exact
test; 66 pairs). Again, the pattern that was identified in the
previous work that considered more distant paralogs could
possibly result from convergent evolution.

Complex regulation of acquired genes

0.0

To determine whether the amount of shared regulation
between close paralogs was greater than would be expected by
chance, we randomly shuffled the regulatory network 1,000
times (see Materials and methods, below). All 1,000 shuffled
networks had fewer cases of regulatory similarity between
paralogs than were found in the true network. When we considered each type of sharing separately, we found the same
result. In particular, paralogous TFs regulate paralogous
genes significantly more often than we would expect by
chance, whereas a previous report found it to be less common
than expected [4]. To determine whether convergent evolution was more common than expected by chance, we compared the regulatory similarities in the shuffled networks with
the number of regulatory similarities between paralogs that
evolved independently. We found that all three types of convergent evolution occurred more often in the real network
than in any of the shuffled networks. Thus, convergent
evolution appears to be a significant factor in the evolution of
gene regulation.

Price et al. R4.12

ulation to be missed, and so the amount of duplicate regulation that can be identified grows more rapidly than the size of
the network. However, because only 13% of the TFs evolved
by duplication within the E. coli lineage, and because the
majority of the regulatory similarities between paralogs
reflect convergent evolution, we can still conclude that little of
gene regulation has evolved by duplication.

Proportion

One mechanism of convergent evolution was apparent; we
found four operons that were clearly acquired after the duplication of their regulators, and yet each of these operons are
regulated by paralogous TFs that bind to shared sites (the
paralogous TFs that share binding sites are gntR/idnR and
narL/narP). Apparently, if paralogous TFs maintain overlapping DNA binding specificities, then a single site can evolve to
bind both TFs. As the evolution of these sites relies on the
functional similarity of the paralogs, it is debatable whether
these cases should be termed convergent evolution. In most
cases, however, no such simplifying mechanism was apparent, and we believe that the paralogs evolved similar regulation entirely independently.

HGT genes tend to have more regulators than other genes (P < 10-4, by
Wilcoxon rank sum test; 354 HGT genes and 998 other genes).

global regulator is usually CRP (61/73 cases). HGT genes are
preferentially regulated by CRP; of the genes with characterized regulation in RegulonDB, CRP regulates 48% of the HGT
genes but only 23% of the other genes (P < 10-15, by Fisher's
exact test). This presumably occurs because CRP regulates
carbon source choice and because many of the HGT genes
encode the catabolism of specific carbon sources. (At a false
discovery rate of 5%, none of the other global regulators has a
statistically significant association with HGT genes.) More
generally, we speculate that HGT genes are particularly likely
to be niche specific and hence to require complex regulation.
In any case, these results suggest that the evolution of regulation is driven by selection and that it evolves more rapidly
than the time scales considered here.

Regulation of acquired genes: evolving new sites versus acquiring
genes with regulatory signals
Given that most of the global regulators are highly conserved
within γ-Proteobacteria, and that typical genes are preferentially transferred within the γ-Proteobacteria, we wondered
whether these genes would conserve their regulation across
HGT events. Among the genes that have been acquired by the
E. coli lineage from other γ-Proteobacteria, we examined
neighbor regulated operons, CRP-regulated genes, and genes
that are regulated by global regulators and have identifiable
binding sites.
To determine whether genes are acquired together with regulatory signals, we first considered neighbor regulated operons
that have undergone co-transfer with their regulators within
the γ-Proteobacteria. In these cases (17 of the 39 neighbor regulators that we examined), it is likely that the regulation of the
operon by the adjacent TF predates the horizontal transfer
event. For six of these 17 operons, there is another known regulator for the operons, and in five of those cases that regulator
is CRP. CRP is conserved in both sequence and DNA-binding
specificity across the γ-Proteobacteria; for example, the pro-

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R4

Price et al. R4.13

tein Clp from the distant γ-Proteobacterium Xanthomonas
campestris is 45% identical to E. coli CRP, has a similar DNAbinding specificity, and complements a crp knockout when
cloned into E. coli [31,32]. So, we used a position-specific
weight matrix derived from known CRP binding sites in E.
coli to predict binding sites for CRP upstream of these operons and upstream of their xenologs in other γ-Proteobacteria
(see Materials and methods, below). We found likely binding
sites upstream of xenologs for three of the five operons (Table
2). We did not find CRP sites upstream of E. coli melAB or its
xenologs, perhaps because CRP does not bind this promoter
in the absence of melR [33]. Finally, dsdXA has a conserved
CRP binding site in Enterobacteria, but the xenolog from
Photobacterium profundus does not. Overall, this analysis
suggested that complex regulation, which in these cases
involved both a neighbor regulator and CRP, can be maintained across HGT events.
We then examined the CRP regulon more broadly. As discussed above, CRP regulates a larger proportion of HGT
genes than of native genes. Although crp has evolutionary
orthologs only within β,γ-Proteobacteria (data not shown),
most of the HGT genes that are regulated by CRP (81%) have
their best hits to more distantly related bacteria. We
examined a random sample of 20 of these genes that were
putatively acquired from distant bacteria by hand, and we
confirmed that most of them (18/20) were acquired from distantly related bacteria. Many of these genes (12/20) have a
sporadic distribution of homologs in intermediate related
bacteria such as Vibrio spp., which suggests that there might
be a more recent HGT event as well. In this case, we wondered
whether the regulation occurred before or after this intermediate HGT event. When we searched for CRP sites upstream
of the first gene in the operon in these intermediate species,
we found likely regulatory sites for four out of 12 genes. Thus,
in most cases, these genes have evolved regulatory sites for
CRP after their transfer into the E. coli lineage, even if they

These E. coli operons are regulated by CRP as well as by an adjacent regulator and have been co-transferred, together with their neighbor regulators,
between the E. coli lineage and other γ-Proteobacteria. We used a weight matrix to identify potential binding sites for CRP upstream of these
operons and their xenologs. For each site we report its sequence, its score in bits, and its position relative to the start codon of the first gene in the
operon. The sites that were used to build the weight matrix have 8.41 ± 2.66 bits (mean ± standard deviation). Within each site's sequence, positions
that match the consensus nAnTGTGAnnnnnnTCACAnTn are capitalized.

were acquired from other γ-Proteobacteria. Given that the
CRP regulon is the largest in E. coli, it is striking that most of
this regulation has evolved relatively recently.
We also considered whether other global regulators have
binding sites that have been conserved across HGT events
within the γ-Proteobacteria. We considered E. coli genes that
were acquired from other γ-Proteobacteria (according to our
automated presence/absence analysis), that are regulated by
global regulators, that are the first gene of their operon, and
that have upstream matches to weight matrices from DPInteract [34]. We found 20 genes that matched these criteria,
and in just six cases the closest xenolog also has a potential
site for the regulator. Because we used a weak threshold to
identify sites (6.0 bits), this could be an overestimate. This
analysis confirmed that many of the binding sites for global
regulators have evolved relatively recently.
Finally, according to our automated analysis, 57% of the HGT
genes in E. coli were acquired from outside the β,γ-Proteobacteria. Because most E. coli TFs do not have orthologs in such
distantly related bacteria [5,17], most of this regulation probably evolved after the transfer event. Overall, we found a few
cases in which complex regulation has been conserved across
HGT events, but most of the regulation of these HGT genes in
E. coli appears to have evolved after the genes were acquired.

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R4

Price et al. R4.14

regulation is maintained by HGT. Thus, neighbor regulators
can be viewed as being 'selfish regulons', as an analog to the
selfish operon theory [35,36]. More precisely, we imagine
that the genes themselves and the regulatory relationship
between them benefit the host, but the proximity itself may
not be of benefit to the host and is selected for by HGT. It
remains unclear how neighbor regulation arises in the first
place; we discuss that issue below. We found that many of the
putative, as yet uncharacterized TFs of E. coli have also been
co-transferred with adjacent genes, and so we infer that most
of these TFs are also neighbor regulators and that they also
regulate just one or two operons [14].
Although most TFs have been acquired by HGT, most of the
global regulators are well conserved within the γ-Proteobacteria. Because these global regulators are responsible for about
two-thirds of known regulation, gene regulation could be
more conserved than would be implied by the recent origins
of the typical TF. However, HGT genes have more complex
regulation than do native genes, and most of these HGT genes
are acquired from distant bacteria in which global regulators
are not conserved. Even for genes that were acquired from
other γ-Proteobacteria, most of the binding sites for global
regulators that are found in E. coli appear not to be conserved
across the HGT events. Thus, it appears that on the time
scales considered here, regulation evolves rapidly, even
though the global regulators evolve slowly.

Conclusion

Nonrandom evolution of gene regulation

We found that TFs are often co-transferred with their regulated genes, which confirms a suggestion [14] that neighbor

Second, HGT genes tend to be under more complex regulation than native genes, which is surprising. HGT genes have
had less time to evolve complex regulation. Also, HGT genes
tend to be less highly expressed than native genes (P < 10-15,
by Wilcoxon rank sum test; expression levels from Price and

We have shown that the TFs of E. coli evolved primarily by
HGT rather than by duplications within the E. coli lineage.
Lineage-specific duplication accounts for a small minority of
TFs (13%) and for an even smaller proportion of regulatory
relationships (5% to 8%). In contrast, most of the TFs (64%)
have been acquired by HGT after the divergence of the E. coli
lineage from Shewanella spp. These findings support the
model of 'allopatric gene divergence', wherein a TF's function
diverges after HGT moves the TF into a new genome with new
selective pressures, and once the TF's function diverges it is
reacquired [9]. For example, dcuR and arcA (Figure 8)
appear to be allopatric paralogs. Allopatric divergence avoids
the complications of selection for both copies of the gene that
arise when two new paralogs are in the same genome. One
might imagine that, once reunited in the same genome, there
would be crosstalk or conflict between these regulators, but
this is not generally the case. Indeed, even for TFs that underwent duplication within the E. coli lineage, only about half of
them share binding sites with their paralogs. DNA binding
specificity may evolve rapidly; many TFs are neighbor regulators that bind just one or two sites in the genome, so that their
DNA-binding specificity should not be highly constrained by
selection. Paralogous TFs usually respond to different signals
as well, but we do not address that here.

We found two nonrandom patterns in the evolution of gene
regulation. Both of these patterns appear inconsistent with
neutral or nearly neutral theories for the evolution of gene
regulation. First, although regulatory similarities between
paralogs (either paralogous TFs or paralogous regulated
genes) account for 14% of the regulatory interactions, evolutionary analysis shows that these similarities often result
from convergent evolution rather than being conserved from
the common ancestor. The tendency toward convergent evolution is statistically significant. We propose that paralogs
tend to have similar (but distinct) functions, and that selection sometimes causes these paralogs to have similar
regulatory interactions. For example, the distant paralogs
aroF and aroG encode isozymes with different feedback inhibition, but both genes are regulated by TyrR. The distant paralogs phoE and ompC encode outer membrane porins with
different specificities, and both are regulated by two-component systems that sense ion concentrations (PhoB/PhoR and
EnvZ/OmpR). We also found a few cases in which a new site
has evolved to bind two paralogous TFs that have overlapping
DNA binding specificities.

coworkers [37]), which implies weaker selection on their regulation. We propose that many HGT genes are niche specific
and hence require more complex control, whereas native
genes are (relatively) constitutively expressed. In particular,
many of the neighbor regulated genes are also regulated by
the catabolite repressor CRP, so that each gene's expression is
regulated by the availability of glucose as well as by a more
specific signal related to the gene's function. More generally,
HGT genes may be 'second best' systems that are not needed
under optimal conditions, and hence need to respond to global regulators as well as to a specific sensor. In contrast,
native genes may be regulated by a single sensor. Because our
knowledge of gene regulation in E. coli is highly incomplete,
however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the apparently complex regulation of HGT genes results from some
bias in what geneticists choose to study.

Neighbor regulators as 'selfish', niche-specific regulons
The mechanism by which neighbor regulators form remains
unclear. If we examine the closest homologs of neighbor regulators and regulated genes that are not near to each other,
then we usually find that these homologs are not in the same
genomes (data not shown), and so the proximity does not
appear to result from deleting intervening genes. We also
note that neighbor regulated genes are more likely than other
characterized genes to be in operons instead of transcribed
individually (P < 0.01, by Fisher's exact test), so there may be
some operons that are evolving 'selfishly' along with their regulators, even though the selfish model does not appear to
apply to operon formation in general [25,28,38,39].

in the genome, in around 10 seconds on average [41]. The
search time might be greater because of nonspecific binding
to DNA [40], but in vivo the lactose repressor finds its target
in at most a few minutes [42]. Thus, we doubt that there is
selection for a TF to be encoded near to its target site(s).
Regardless of the origin of neighbor regulation, the repeated
HGT of neighbor regulators within γ-Proteobacteria suggests
that these regulons are niche specific. Niche-dependent selection for these genes is also consistent with the functional bias
of HGT genes [23], the role played by HGT genes in peripheral (nonessential) rather than central metabolism, and the
metabolic compatibility of acquired genes with the pre-existing capabilities of the host [43]. Conversely, the sporadic distribution of these genes is consistent with the high rate of loss
of recently acquired genes [44]. The rapid loss would most
likely be neutral, but it could also reflect selection against
capabilities that are deleterious if not frequently needed [45].

Complex patterns of HGT

We speculate that neighbor regulation might arise because it
allows the TF to bind to a single site and regulate both the TF
and the regulated operon. For example, the majority of TFs
regulate their own transcription, and if an HGT event inserts
an operon adjacent to the TF, then the pre-existing site could
regulate that operon's transcription. This would explain why
the majority of neighbor regulators are divergent from their
regulated genes, and strong selection to maintain the shared
site might explain why the divergent orientation is associated
with autoregulatory TFs [14,15]. The other neighbor regulators might arise from divergent neighbor regulators by local
inversion, as can be seen for xapR (Figure 3).

We found that HGT of TFs is rampant, and that many genome
sequences are required to detect these events, so that the
absence of the gene from intermediate groups of bacteria is
clear. Because of HGT between related bacteria, simply comparing the gene tree with the species tree (for those species
that contain the gene) may not be a sensitive indicator of
HGT. We found that HGT of global regulators was rare, but
because these regulators are resistant to gene loss we cannot
use gene absence to help us identify HGT. Thus, we could be
underestimating the rate of HGT for these genes. As in the
case of crp, these global regulators often have conserved context, so insertion of a xenolog and loss of the original gene
appears not to occur. However, homologous recombination
could be replacing all or parts of these sequences in place,
especially given the high conservation of these genes (for
example, the DNA sequence of crp is 88% identical between
E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium LT2). Indeed, some
workers argue that all bacterial genes are subject to frequent
HGT events [46]. In this case, the distinction between HGT
and other genes might not be meaningful, but there remains
a difference between genes that are frequently gained and lost
(niche-specific neighbor regulators) and genes that have
occasionally undergone recombination (global regulators).

Another explanation is that neighbor regulation might be
selected for because a newly synthesized TF would be closer
to its target [14]. This type of proximity could also explain why
neighbor regulators tend not to be transcribed in the convergent orientation relative to the regulated operon, because the
convergent orientation increases the distance from the newly
synthesized TF to its site by a few kilobases [40]. However,
the time for TFs to find their targets is short regardless of
their location; TFs bind to specific sites at rates of around
108/M per second, and if the TF has a single site in the
genome then that site's concentration is about 10-9 M, so that
a newly synthesized TF should find its binding site, anywhere

Why should HGT between related bacteria be prevalent? One
possibility is that DNA from related organisms is more easily
integrated into the host's genome. In general, however, the
divergence of the genes involved appears to be too great for
homologous recombination. Another possibility is that
related bacteria are more likely to have genes that fit into the
pre-existing metabolic pathways of the new host, which
increases the likelihood of HGT [43]. Finally, our results suggest that compatibility of gene regulatory systems might
select for HGT between related bacteria. Even when genes are
acquired together with neighbor regulators, these genes are
also often regulated by global regulators such as CRP, and we

found some cases in which CRP binding sites were conserved
across transfer events. CRP and most of the other global regulators from E. coli are not present in distant bacteria [17],
and so the transfer of regulatory sites can only occur between
related bacteria. Even if the operon has only one regulator,
differences in the core transcriptional machinery in different
hosts might prevent the newly acquired neighbor regulator
from functioning, especially for activators.

Materials and methods
Regulatory interactions
We obtained regulatory interactions from RegulonDB 5.6 [1].
After removing RNA genes and pseudogenes, and the housekeeping sigma factor RpoD, we had 159 characterized TFs,
1,354 regulated genes, and 3,085 regulatory interactions
between them. A few of the TFs are heterodimers; in these
cases, we analyzed only one of the two subunits. We also
examined TF and gene annotations in EcoCyc [47] and known
operons in RegulonDB.

Evolutionary histories of TFs
We investigated the evolutionary histories of TFs by comparing the gene tree with the species tree. As a first step, we used
fast neighbor-joining trees [48] for COGs, PFams, and ad hoc
BLAST families from the MicrobesOnline tree browser [49]
and we compared the gene trees to the MicrobesOnline species tree. (The most relevant parts of the species tree are
shown in Figure 2, and the construction of the species tree is
described below.)

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R4

Price et al. R4.16

gene's origin (for example, purR/rbsR, in Figure 4, is classified as a duplication).
Once we had a tentative classification, we confirmed it by
checking for close homologs (by BLASTp) that might be
absent from the gene family (because of the limitations of
gene family assignment) and by building a smaller and more
accurate phylogenetic tree for a selected subset of homologs.
To build these higher quality trees, we used MUSCLE [52] to
align the protein coding sequences, Gblocks to trim the
alignments [53], and both TreePuzzle [54] and phyml [55] to
build phylogenetic trees.
We also asked whether the putative HGT event affected the E.
coli lineage. For example, as seen for crp (Figure 5), the tree
suggests a transfer event from E. coli's ancestors to another
lineage, but this does not imply that E. coli's ancestors
acquired the gene by HGT. These genes were classified as
native.
We assume that these genes were transferred from other bacteria into the E. coli lineage, rather than vice versa, even
though it is theoretically possible that these TFs arose in the
E. coli lineage relatively recently and were then transferred
elsewhere. Because most of the TFs belong to large families
that are present in many other bacterial lineages, and also
because these TFs often have distant paralogs in E. coli, a
recent origin of these families within the E. coli lineage is not
plausible.

Species tree
Given a gene tree and a species tree, we identified horizontal
transfer events using a combination of the gene phylogeny
and the pattern of gene presence and gene absence. If a
strongly supported clade in the gene tree was present in disparate genomes, so that three or more deletion events would
be required to explain the distribution of the subfamily on the
species tree, then we assigned an HGT event. Deletions in the
highly reduced genomes of the insect endosymbiont group
(Buchnera, Wigglesworthia, and Blochmannia) were not
considered as evidence for HGT. Given that HGT appears to
be common in bacteria, the threshold of three or more deletion events is conservative. In particular, with higher thresholds, a large number of deletions from ancestral bacteria are
required to explain the present distribution of genes, which
requires the ancestral bacteria to have had unreasonably
large genomes [50,51].
If the gene tree showed paralogs, and the phylogeny of two
subgroups was consistent with the species tree, then we
assigned a gene duplication event. Histories that did not meet
either of these criteria were considered native, even if there
were minor discrepancies between the species tree and the
gene tree. If a gene exhibited evidence for both HGT and
duplication, then we used the most recent event to classify the

The species tree was computed from maximum likelihood
trees of concatenated proteins by using matrix representation
of parsimony [56]. The maximum likelihood trees were generated from a lower quality guide tree by selecting, for each
internal node in the guide tree, a small number of descendant
genomes and close out-groups (less than 20 genomes in
total). Given this small group of genomes, we identified COGs
[22] that are present as a single copy in each genome. Because
these groups of genomes usually consisted of close relatives,
there were typically hundreds of conserved genes. We aligned
and trimmed each COG, again using MUSCLE and Gblocks,
and concatenated the alignments. Because the resulting
alignments were often very large, we removed invariant sites,
and if the alignment still contained over 5,000 positions then
we took a random sample of sites. We then built a tree with
phyml, using four categories of evolutionary rates. We converted the trees to a matrix of characters [56] and used PAUP
4.0b10 [57] to infer the most parsimonious tree. Finally, we
used PHYLIP [58] to infer maximum likelihood branch
lengths, with gamma-distributed rates, from a concatenated
alignment of 74 highly conserved proteins.
A fuller description of the species tree construction is available online [49]. The tree does not contain bootstrap values,
but most of the source trees have strong bootstrap support

and are congruent with each other (data not shown). The
most relevant uncertainties are the placement of Photorhabdus, and whether Sodalis should be grouped with the other
insect endosymbionts (Buchnera and so on).

Sampling of regulators
We examined all of the top 20 global regulators, which
account for about two-thirds of the regulatory interactions in
RegulonDB. For neighbor regulators, we examined those that
were described in an earlier compilation of regulatory
interactions, ColiNet 1.1 [59], which we used in the initial
phase of this project. Although this is not a truly random sample, we do not know of any reason why the more recently characterized regulators would have different evolutionary
histories. We examined a random sample of 23 of the other
characterized regulators in RegulonDB. Again, these were
primarily regulators that were described in ColiNet.
We identified putative regulators in E. coli K12 by searching
for gene ontology GO:0003700 ('transcription factor activity') using the MicrobesOnline database. We randomly
selected 20 of these to examine, and we verified that they
were predicted to contain helix-turn-helix domains (by using
InterPro), that they were not annotated as restriction
enzymes or DNA modification enzymes, and that they were
not already characterized according to EcoCyc [47].

Automatic identification of HGT genes
To identify HGT automatically, we looked for genes that lack
close homologs in consecutive groups of related bacteria (Figure 9). We defined 'close' homologs by BLAST scores, and to
confirm the putative HGT we used a quartet test (see Figure
9). This approach contrasts to approaches that rely heavily on
the gene tree [13,24] and is more similar to presence/absence
analyses [60,61]. Although the method is conservative, and
misses many HGT events (data not shown), it classifies about
a quarter of protein coding genes in E. coli K12 as HGT, which
yields a sufficiently large sample for analysis.
The quartet test was not conducted if there was no more distant homolog in each of the groups of genomes that were
'missing' good hits to the gene, because in these cases we do
not have four genes to form a quartet from. If we did have a
gene from each group of genomes, we aligned the four genes
with MUSCLE, we removed positions with gaps and we tested
the likelihood of all three topologies with tree puzzle [54],
using gamma-distributed evolutionary rates.

Volume 9, Issue 1, Article R4

quently than for other regulators, so that they regulate more
genes.
To test this null hypothesis, we shuffled the network so that
that the number of interactions for each TF and for each regulated gene was unchanged (similar to the report by Maslov
and Sneppen [62] but for regulatory networks). More precisely, we selected the regulated genes for each TF by sampling without replacement from the complete set of regulated
genes. We re-sampled parts of the network to avoid duplicate
interactions between regulated genes and TFs. This gave
networks with the same degree distribution as the original
network, both for TFs and for regulated genes.
An alternate randomization test is to permute the paralogy
relationships instead of the regulatory networks. (See the
report by Teichmann and Babu [4], although they use the
terminology of 'domain architectures' rather than paralogy.)
This test confirmed that convergent evolution is more
common in the real network than expected by chance; all
three types of convergent similarity in Table 1 were more
common in the real network than in 999 or more of the 1,000
paralogy shuffles that we ran.

Predicting binding sites for global regulators
We obtained characterized CRP binding sites in E. coli from
DPInteract [34]. We aligned these sites with MEME [63],
converted the alignment to a weight matrix with palindromic
symmetry, and used patser [64] to search for sites. We
searched from -200 to +100 relative to each gene's start
codon, and we considered only potential sites with a score of
6.0 bits or higher. This cut-off is quite weak and leads to high
sensitivity but modest specificity; we found sites in E. coli for
13 of the 16 CRP-regulated genes that we examined, but 13%
of randomly selected upstream regions for xenologs of E. coli
genes had a hit at 6.0 bits or above. Nevertheless, the xenologous CRP sites in Table 2 are unlikely to have occurred by
chance; yiaK and gntK have hits over 10 bits, which occurs in
less than 1% of upstream regions, and araB has two nearby
sites, which suggests cooperative binding and is also unlikely
to occur by chance.
Analyses for other global regulators that have weight matrices
in DPInteract were conducted similarly, but without forcing
the weight matrix to be palindromic. Some of the sigma factors have multiple models, in which case we used the best
score for any model. The weight matrices for lrp and fis were
not used because they have poor specificity [34].

Shuffled regulatory network
To test whether the regulatory similarities between paralogs
occurred more often than we would expect by chance, we used
a simple null hypothesis that the regulatory network evolves
randomly. This null hypothesis is equivalent to a simplistic
neutral model in which binding sites for regulators arise neutrally, and binding sites for global regulators arise more fre-

Automated identification of HGT genes
Automated identification of HGT genes. We examined the highest Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) scores of homologs within groups of
genomes at increasing distances from Escherichia coli. If the BLAST score was substantially lower (by a factor of 1.3) in two consecutive groups relative to
its best score in more distant genomes, then the gene was considered a candidate for horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Given such candidates, we then
used a quartet test to determine whether the best hit from the more distant genome was actually more closely related to the E. coli gene than were the
best hits from intermediate genomes. The quartet test confirmed HGT in 92% of these cases, and for 71% of the genes whose quartet topology indicated
HGT the topology was strongly supported (P < 0.05, by Shimodaira-Hasegawa test in tree puzzle [54]). 'HPVS' refers to Haemophilus, Pasteurella, Vibrio,
Shewanella, and related species.
