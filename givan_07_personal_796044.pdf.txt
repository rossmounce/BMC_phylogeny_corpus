Abstract
Background: Large molecular sequence databases are fundamental resources for modern
bioscientists. Whether for project-specific purposes or sharing data with colleagues, it is often
advantageous to maintain smaller sequence databases. However, this is usually not an easy task for
the average bench scientist.
Results: We present the Personal Sequence Database (PSD), a suite of tools to create and
maintain small- to medium-sized web-accessible sequence databases. All interactions with PSD
tools occur via the internet with a web browser. Users may define sequence groups within their
database that can be maintained privately or published to the web for public use. A sequence group
can be downloaded, browsed, searched by keyword or searched for sequence similarities using
BLAST. Publishing a sequence group extends these capabilities to colleagues and collaborators. In
addition to being able to manage their own sequence databases, users can enroll sequences in
BLASTAgent, a BLAST hit tracking system, to monitor NCBI databases for new entries displaying
a specified level of nucleotide or amino acid similarity.
Conclusion: The PSD offers a valuable set of resources unavailable elsewhere. In addition to
managing sequence data and BLAST search results, it facilitates data sharing with colleagues,
collaborators and public users. The PSD is hosted by the authors and is available at http://
bioinfo.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/psd/.

Background
Bioscientists routinely interact with biological sequence
databases. Often the interactions are with one of the several large national or international databases that provide
web-based tools; for example, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [1], EMBL Nucleotide
Sequence Database [2] and DNA Data Bank of Japan [3].
To maintain data accuracy and integrity, well-defined procedures exist for submitting and changing entries in these

databases. Although these procedures ensure a reliable
resource for scientists around the world, they present significant restrictions to researchers who want to maintain
their own sequences of interest in a web-accessible database that can be searched and shared with other users.
We present the Personal Sequence Database (PSD). The
PSD is a suite of tools that allows a user to create, maintain and share small- to medium-size sequence databases.

All interactions between a user and the database are over
the internet with a web browser. Although at its core the
PSD stores DNA and protein sequences, it also offers several data analysis tools, including ClustalW [4] and CAP3
[5], and the BLASTAgent, a custom tool that monitors
NCBI sequence databases for new entries with sequence
similarity to a particular PSD entry. Sequences in the PSD
can be organized into groups that represent a user-defined
level of association. The PSD allows a user to run BLAST
[6] searches against the database sequences or against specific sequence groups within the database. Sequence
groups can be maintained privately or shared with public
users. If a sequence group is shared publicly, anyone can
run BLAST searches against the sequences within the
group. The PSD is maintained as a web-accessible public
resource and is available, free of charge, to any educational user [7].

Implementation
User and database interfaces
The PSD user interface is generated by Perl (version 5.8.5)
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts. The scripts utilize the HTML::Template library (version 2.7) [8] to separate Perl code from the HTML markup. The web services
are delivered by an Apache hypertext protocol daemon
(httpd; Apache/1.3.29, mod_perl/1.29) [9,10] from a Sun
Microsystems (Santa Clara, California, USA) V40z server
running the Red Hat (Raleigh, North Carolina, USA)
Linux operating system. The database tier is provided by
the MySQL [11] database engine (version 3.23.58) from a
separate, dedicated Sun Microsystems V40z running the
Red Hat Linux operating system. Interactions between the
scripts and the MySQL database are facilitated by a private
ethernet network and the Perl DBI library (version 1.43)
[12].
NCBI sequence databases
Local versions of NCBI [1] DNA and protein databases are
maintained by the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB). Once every 24 hours, custom Perl
scripts download newly submitted sequences from NCBI
and merge them into the local copies of each database.
DNA and protein sequences submitted to NCBI within
the last month are also maintained as separate databases.
Periodically, new versions of the full databases are downloaded and replace the local merged versions. When necessary, individual sequences are extracted from these
databases using tools distributed in the NCBI toolbox
[13]; for example, fastacmd.
BLAST searches
All BLAST searches use local NCBI BLAST [6] engines and
local copies of NCBI sequence databases. BLAST searches
are submitted to a local computer cluster and the results
are parsed by custom Perl scripts.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/479

SOAP interface
The SOAP interface is facilitated by the SOAP::Lite Perl
library (version 0.69) [14].
Other software
The PSD makes use of various other software packages.
Bioperl, version 1.4 [15], is used to manipulate biological
sequences. Multiple sequence alignments are generated by
ClustalW, version 1.8.4 [4]. CAP3 [5] is used to generate
contigs from overlapping DNA fragments. Some metadata
is compressed using the zlib library, version 1.1.4 [16].

Results and Discussion
Although the PSD encompasses several distinct programs,
users mainly interact with a handful of Perl CGI scripts
(psd.cgi, psd_blast.cgi and bulkAddSeq.cgi) that access a
MySQL database. Layers of abstraction render many of the
underlying details invisible and users are presented with a
consistent interface to perform database functions. We
will describe the primary interface elements presented in
a user's web browser.
PSD registration
An online registration system is available from the main
PSD website (see above). Upon successful registration the
PSD is available for immediate use. During the registration, the user supplies a user name and password for login
purposes. Subsequent changes to registration information
are facilitated by a user administration interface.
Sequence data entry
The PSD allows sequence entry either individually or in
batch. After logging in to the PSD, a user can enter a single
sequence by following a link to "Add A Sequence." The
raw sequence and associated metadata are entered in the
appropriate areas of the page, see Figure 1A, which
include: sequence name, description and sequence type,
and the primary sequence. As described below, other
options include enrolling the sequence in the BLASTAgent
and identifying protein domains within the sequence.
Upon entering as much information as desired, the entry
is saved and the data becomes part of the user's database.
An additional method is available to add a batch of multiple sequences. By following a link to "Add many
sequences," the user is presented with a form to either
upload a FASTA [17] file from their desktop computer or
to copy and paste multiple sequences in FASTA format in
a supplied box form element. Although not optimized for
entering single sequences, the bulk form can also serve
this purpose. In either case, sequence names and descriptions are extracted from the FASTA formatted sequence.
Using either the single or bulk sequence entry forms, the
sequences are available for immediate use once deposited
into the PSD. Currently, public users are limited to 5000
sequences of up to 5000 residues each. These limitations

PSD sequence data and metadata
PSD sequence data and metadata. This is an example web page from the PSD containing all data and metadata associated
with a protein sequence (DNA sequence pages are identical). A) Data entered by the user, either manually or automatically
during batch import, and BLASTAgent settings. Notice that this particular sequence is not enrolled in BLASTAgent, but a
BLASTP search of NCBI NR database has been run and the 596 hits are stored for the user to view. BLAST search options are
illustrated; for example, the Entrez term "Caenorhabditis elegans [orgn]" limits the database hits to only those from C. elegans.
B) Protein domains. Potential protein domains can be identified for any PSD sequence. A BLAST search of the NCBI CDD
database is run and hits are illustrated graphically and by text. C) Sequence metadata. Sequence-associated data may be generated by tools integrated within the PSD, as in the top 2 entries, a BLAST2 alignment and a ClustalW multiple sequence alignment, or from external tools as the last entry illustrates.

may change in the future and can be negotiated by contacting the author. As described below, the limitations are
designed to mitigate the computational demands of hosting the PSD but still provide adequate functionality for
the average user.
BLAST hit tracking system – BLASTAgent
An especially useful feature of the PSD is the ability to
store results of BLAST searches. This process starts by initializing the BLASTAgent for a specific sequence. The user
has the option of choosing from several combinations of
BLAST [6] algorithm and NCBI [1] sequence database,
including: BLASTN, TBLASTN, TBLASTX of non-redundant DNA; BLASTP or BLASTX of non-redundant protein;
BLASTN or TBLASTN of GSS or STS; and BLASTN,
TBLASTN or TBLASTX of mouse, human or other EST
databases. All BLAST databases are maintained locally and
updated nightly. After a BLAST search finishes, the results
are viewable in a table format. This static list of BLAST hits
remains available until the sequence is deleted from the
user's database.

Subsequent to BLASTAgent initialization, it is possible to
periodically re-run the BLAST search and identify new
BLAST hits – ostensibly sequences added to the NCBI
database since the last search. This process is either done
manually, by pressing the "Search for New Hits" button,
or automatically by choosing the "Yes" option for the
form menu element entitled "Enroll in BLASTAgent?". If
the BLASTAgent is activated, BLAST searches automatically run weekly. If new BLAST hits are identified the user
will receive an email listing the sequences that have new
hits. If no new BLAST hits are identified, the user will not
receive an email message. Currently the user has no ability
to alter when or how often the automatic BLASTAgent
searches run, although this feature will be added in the
future. However, a user has the option to re-run the
BLASTAgent search manually at any time.
BLAST results can be filtered using two methods. First, a
BLAST Expect value (E-value) limitation can be imposed.
The E-value limit is always in effect, but the default value
of 1e-06 can be modified by the user to allow either a
higher or lower value. Current E-value choices range from
1e-100 to 100. Filtering by E-value is particularly effective
at limiting the number of BLAST hits for sequences with
high representation within the NCBI databases; for example, 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Users can also filter BLAST
hits by NCBI Entrez terms. The PSD can use any valid Entrez term to filter BLAST hits. Filtering by Entrez query is
especially effective at targeting a specific set of sequences;
for example, sequences from a particular organism. The
Entrez vocabulary is available from the NCBI website [18]
or from links within the PSD.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/479

BLAST hit sequence manipulation
If a BLAST search identifies hits for a PSD sequence, several options are available to manipulate the hit sequences.
When viewing the BLAST results, links are provided to the
specific entry at NCBI and to display the BLAST alignment
of the query sequence and the database hit sequence.
Additional analysis options are available depending on
the type of BLAST database searched. For example, if the
hits are from a protein database, specific hits can be
selected and subjected to a ClustalW multiple sequence
alignment. If the hits are from a DNA database they can be
subjected to either a ClustalW or CAP3 multiple sequence
alignment algorithm. All database hits are available for
direct download in FASTA format irrespective of sequence
type. BLAST, ClustalW and CAP3 alignments can be saved
as metadata associated to the PSD sequence used as the
query in the BLAST search (see below).
PSD sequence domain identification
Any PSD sequence can be subjected to protein domain
identification. Domain identification is facilitated by a
BLAST search of local copy of the NCBI Conserved
Domain Database (CDD) [19]. A BLASTP or BLASTX
search is used depending on whether the PSD sequence is
a protein or DNA sequence, respectively. Results of the
CDD BLAST search are saved both as text and as a graphical representation of the domain hits relative to the query
sequence, see Figure 1B. Links to the NCBI web page for
each domain are provided in the text output. The results
of a domain search remain associated with the PSD
sequence entry until the domain search is deleted or the
PSD sequence entry is removed from the database.
PSD sequence notes
Metadata, referred to as "Sequence Notes", can be associated and saved with any PSD sequence entry, see Figure
1C. These metadata can be hand-entered text, a BLAST
alignment, or a multiple sequence alignment generated by
ClustalW or CAP3 (see above). When a sequence alignment is generated within the PSD, it is presented as a web
page that can be permanently associated with the PSD
sequence entry. If saved, the graphical nature of the alignments as well as the text output are faithfully stored until
they are manually deleted or the PSD sequence entry is
removed from the database. Additionally, an interface is
provided to manage the notes; for example, changing a
note title or deleting batches of notes.
PSD sequence groups
Often it is useful to collect sequences related to each other
by some characteristic. The PSD facilitates this process
through the creation of sequence groups. Any PSD user
can create an unlimited number of sequence groups. Individual sequences are submitted to a group using checkboxes and a pull-down menu to select the desired group.

Page 4 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:479

If the sequences are added in bulk (see above), the user
can select a group to which the sequences will be added
upon submission of the form. An interface is available to
add or delete sequences from a group or to change the
group membership of sequences from one group to
another. Additionally, group characteristics can be
changed using the Sequence Group Administration (SGA)
page. Sequence groups are a powerful way to organize
sequences for further analysis; for example, BLAST
searches or sequence sharing (see below).
BLAST searches of PSD databases
Any user can search their PSD using BLAST. If a user has
created sequence groups, these can be searched independently from the other sequences in the database. All of the
BLAST algorithms are available from a pull-down menu
on the BLAST interface. Before the BLAST search occurs,
the PSD collects the sequences appropriate for the BLAST
algorithm; for example, DNA sequences for a BLASTN
search or protein sequences for a BLASTP search. The collected sequences are converted to a BLAST database, the
BLAST search runs on a PSD server and the data are delivered to the user's browser. Multiple query sequences can
be submitted at once – the BLAST output is concatenated.
Each BLAST search is accompanied by a graphical representation of the BLAST hits relative to the query sequence.
Users can easily move between BLAST results and PSD
sequence entries using links back to the PSD in the BLAST
results.
Sharing PSD sequence groups
Using the SGA page (see above), any PSD sequence group
can be made publicly available, which is described as
"published" within the PSD. All data associated with published PSD sequences are available for browsing by public
users, including: the sequence, sequence notes, protein
domain information and BLAST hits, if available. However, public users cannot alter any characteristic of the
sequence or associated metadata. The published sequence
groups are available through a common interface specialized for this purpose. A link to the public interface, which
can be distributed to collaborators or displayed on a web
page, is provided on the SGA page when the group is published. The SGA page allows a user to provide optional
text that will be rendered in HTML on the public interface.
This optional text can be used to provide links to other
resources the user feels is appropriate or valuable for the
specific sequences contained within the group. Any public
sequence group can easily be made private again using the
SGA page.

In addition to the shared sequences and associated metadata, public PSD sequence groups are available for BLAST
searches by public users. A link to the public BLAST search
page is provided on the public interface. When public

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/479

users follow this link, they are presented with a simple
BLAST form that can be submitted with a query sequence
in FASTA format. The BLAST results contain links back to
the sequences in the published sequence group of the
PSD. Using the SGA page, a user can supply a template for
links to an external resource; for example, an external
database containing more extensive information about
sequences within the group. These external links will be
displayed for every hit in the BLAST report. External links
require a specialized syntax, which is explained on the
SGA page.
Each public sequence group has its own home web page.
Thus, users can maintain multiple independent public
sequence groups, each available as a distinct shareable
and/or public resource. As mentioned above, there is no
limit to the number of sequence groups that can be created by a single user.
Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface
A SOAP interface to public sequences (see above) is available for users interested in writing custom software to
interact remotely with the PSD. Full PSD functionality has
not been included in the SOAP interface, but this is a
future goal. For detailed information about using the
SOAP interface, users are directed to the PSD information
website [7].
Computational requirements and considerations
From the perspective of providing a public resource such
as the PSD, an obvious concern is the potential computational requirements needed. Although still a concern, several mechanisms have been devised to minimize the
computational load. There are two main components to
the computational load: storage space and server Central
Processing Unit (CPU) usage. Multiple strategies reduce
the storage space requirements for the MySQL tables storing the PSD data. The most obvious strategy, as described
above, is to limit the number and length of sequences a
user can store in a particular PSD. These limitations are
first approximations and may be altered in the future as
space requirements are re-evaluated. Another strategy is to
not store BLAST alignments in the database. The necessary
information to recreate a particular BLAST alignment on
the fly using bl2seq (NCBI) is stored in the PSD, alleviating storage of the actual alignment text. Finally, when a
user stores metadata, which is often a web page, the data
are subjected to a zlib compression algorithm [16] to minimize their size within the database.

Currently, the PSD contains 101,496 sequence entries
with a length of less than 5000 residues. Given the above
sequence constraints, this represents approximately 20
users if each user stored the maximum of 5000 sequences.
To store these sequences, the database engine requires

Page 5 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:479

approximately 84MB of disk space. About 1% of these
sequences are enrolled in BLAST searches, which increases
storage requirements by about 100 MB. Given these
parameters, we estimate that PSD usage could increase
4000-fold and still be rather inexpensive to manage at current hard drive prices. It is expected that the cost per byte
of disk space will continue to drop, increasing the manageable number of potential PSD users.
As mentioned above, another concern is CPU usage. Three
aspects of the PSD affect processor load: the Apache web
delivery engine [10], the MySQL database engine, and the
BLAST searches. The most fundamental strategy to manage these loads is to distribute the services to distinct
machines specialized for their purpose. Demands on the
PSD web server are manageable and are less of a concern
than the MySQL and BLAST CPU requirements. Currently
the MySQL database is hosted by a single four-processor
machine with 4GB of RAM. It is likely that this will be the
weak link within the PSD architecture. Imposing the
above limits on an individual user's PSD will help to manage MySQL load, but depending on its popularity the PSD
could easily outgrow the current MySQL machine. If necessary, multiple MySQL servers could be incorporated
into the architecture to provide parallel and redundant
database servers. As database load gradually increases over
time, additional database servers can be added. Several
strategies are used to manage the computational demands
imposed by the BLAST searches. The PSD runs three types
of BLAST searches. When a user initializes a BLASTAgent
an initial BLAST search runs against a full NCBI database;
i.e., NT or NR. These BLAST searches are quite demanding
and usually last for several minutes. Alternatively, when
identifying new hits, BLAST searches most often run
against databases that contain only those sequences
deposited into NCBI within the last month. Therefore,
these are smaller databases and the BLAST searches are
much less demanding, usually lasting only several seconds. The majority of BLAST searches are of the latter type,
which minimizes the computational demands. BLAST
searches can also be run against a user's database. Due to
the size limitation imposed on individual PSD databases,
these BLAST searches are quite fast and do not require significant CPU time. In addition to the above measures, a
custom-designed daemon process running on a PSD
server manages jobs to limit the number running at any
given time, which mitigates the computational demand.
Finally, no method exists to bulk-submit sequences to the
BLASTAgent system. Although seemingly a drawback, this
design is intentional and requires a user to decide which
sequences are most important for BLAST searches and
minimizes inefficiencies associated with running BLAST
searches with many highly similar PSD entries.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/479

The PSD is currently supported by the CGRB at Oregon
State University. The CGRB maintains an extensive computational infrastructure, including a computer cluster
that the PSD leverages to run BLAST searches and multiple
sequence alignments. Several nodes within the cluster are
dedicated to the PSD and additional nodes can be added
when necessary. We estimate that the number of BLAST
searches could increase 100-fold and still remain manageable. The PSD represents an important public resource
and the CGRB is committed to supporting it into the foreseeable future.

Conclusion
The Personal Sequence Database is an integrated suite of
tools that allows users to create and maintain small- to
medium-sized biological sequence databases. Multiple
requisite database functions exist, including: sequence
uploading and downloading, database searching by keyword and BLAST sequence similarity searching. The PSD
provides several sequence analysis functions, including
protein domain identification and multiple sequence
alignments. The PSD also offers BLASTAgent, a powerful
resource that provides an automated system for tracking
new BLAST hits appearing in NCBI databases. Although
some shared functionality exists with other software [2026], the PSD represents a unique set of resources that is
unavailable from any other single location.
A user can organize database entries into sequence groups,
ostensibly representing some shared relationship.
Sequence groups behave as individual units within the
larger database. Each sequence group can be maintained
privately or publicly. Public sequence groups, also
referred to as "published" groups within the PSD, are
available to any user as a read-only resource. As such, a
published group represents an individual web-accessible
sequence database that can be distributed to colleagues
(ie, as a URL) or maintained as a long-term public entity.
Therefore, any single user can maintain multiple sequence
groups, each of which can be either private or published.
An interesting use of these capabilities is to incorporate
PSD sequence groups into other web resources. For example, the Marine Microbial Genomics (MMG) website [27]
uses PSD sequence groups to allow visitors to run BLAST
searches against the genomes of dozens of newly
sequenced bacterial genome sequences. Although the
MMG website is maintained in association with the
authors, anyone could mimic this method on their own
sites with no involvement of the author. Therefore, the
PSD can provide computationally-intensive resources to
researchers within less well-developed computational
infrastructures.
It is common for a geographically distributed group of
researchers to collaborate on large projects. Often these

Page 6 of 7

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:479

projects revolve around accumulating DNA sequences,
either for genome assembly, gene discovery or expression
analysis. For these types of projects, the PSD can facilitate
research and data sharing between groups by serving as a
central resource to which all groups can refer for sequence
data. Although in its current version the PSD does not
allow multiple users to have read/write access to individual databases, future versions will include this capability.
Interested parties can contact the authors for more information about this functionality.
Finally, there are several areas of additional functionality
scheduled for future PSD releases. These include more
extensive search capabilities, an advanced BLAST interface, more configuration options (ie, when and how often
BLASTAgent runs), downloadable BLAST results, automatic determination of Gene Ontology [28] terms associated with user-specified entries and a more extensive
collection of sequence analysis tools, including PFAM
searches [29] and basic phylogeny tools. These improvements will appear gradually as development proceeds.
Interested parties should refer to the PSD information
web page for future announcements.
