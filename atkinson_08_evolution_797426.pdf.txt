Abstract
Background: Members of the eukaryote/archaea specific eRF1 and eRF3 protein families have
central roles in translation termination. They are also central to various mRNA surveillance
mechanisms, together with the eRF1 paralogue Dom34p and the eRF3 paralogues Hbs1p and Ski7p.
We have examined the evolution of eRF1 and eRF3 families using sequence similarity searching,
multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.
Results: Extensive BLAST searches confirm that Hbs1p and eRF3 are limited to eukaryotes, while
Dom34p and eRF1 (a/eRF1) are universal in eukaryotes and archaea. Ski7p appears to be restricted
to a subset of Saccharomyces species. Alignments show that Dom34p does not possess the
characteristic class-1 RF minidomains GGQ, NIKS and YXCXXXF, in line with recent
crystallographic analysis of Dom34p. Phylogenetic trees of the protein families allow us to
reconstruct the evolution of mRNA surveillance mechanisms mediated by these proteins in
eukaryotes and archaea.
Conclusion: We propose that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaea possessed
Dom34p-mediated no-go decay (NGD). This ancestral Dom34p may or may not have required a
trGTPase, mostly like a/eEF1A, for its delivery to the ribosome. At an early stage in eukaryotic
evolution, eEF1A was duplicated, giving rise to eRF3, which was recruited for translation
termination, interacting with eRF1. eRF3 evolved nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) activity either
before or after it was again duplicated, giving rise to Hbs1p, which we propose was recruited to
assist eDom34p in eukaryotic NGD. Finally, a third duplication within ascomycete yeast gave rise
to Ski7p, which may have become specialised for a subset of existing Hbs1p functions in non-stop
decay (NSD). We suggest Ski7p-mediated NSD may be a specialised mechanism for counteracting
the effects of increased stop codon read-through caused by prion-domain [PSI+] mediated eRF3
precipitation.

Background
Members of eRF1 and eRF3 protein families are involved
in two major cellular processes in both eukaryotes and
archaea. Firstly, these proteins are involved in translation
termination [1,2]. Secondly, both eRF1 and eRF3 are key
players in mRNA quality control surveillance mechanisms, as are their paralogues Dom34p in the case of
eRF1, and Hbs1p and Ski7p in the case of eRF3 [3-6].
Involvement of these proteins in two different cellular systems and differences in substrate specificity among family
members make them interesting candidates for in silico
comparative analyses. Such analyses can provide a direct
link between protein sequence and structure as well as
insight into functional aspects of translation termination
and mRNA decay.
During translation termination, nascent peptide is
released from the ribosome by hydrolytic attack of the
water molecule, leaving the P-site tRNA in a deacylated
state. This is accomplished by the combined action of two
distinct functional classes of proteins, the class-1 and
class-2 release factors (RFs). Class-1 RFs (eRF1, aRF1, RF1
and RF2) recognise stop codons in the ribosomal A-site
and trigger hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA in the peptidyl
transferase center (for a review see [7,8]). Class-2 RFs
(aRF3 and RF3) are GTPases that assist class-1 RFs in this
process.
Eukaryotic and archaeal class-1 RFs (aRF1 and eRF1,
respectively) are homologues of each other but not of bacterial class-1 RFs (RF1 and RF2). This is clear from the lack
of structural similarity between them [9] as well as functional differences [1,5,10-14]. Meanwhile, Class-2 RFs are
found in both eukaryotes and bacteria (but so far not
Archaea [15,16]). However, although the latter proteins
are members of the translational GTPase (trGTPase)
superfamily [14,17,18], they have very different origins
within it; the eukaryote protein (eRF3) arises from the a/
eEF1A side of the superfamily, hereafter referred to as the
EF1 family [16] while the bacterial protein (RF3) arises
from the distantly related EF2 side [19]. Consistent with
its EF1 origin, eRF3 binds and transports eRF1, a structural
mimic of tRNA [20], to the ribosomal A-site, similar to the
role of eEF1A in binding and delivering aminoacyl-tRNAs
to the same site. The class-1 RFs appear to be essential as
a/eRF1 is universal among eukaryotes and archaea. For
the class-2 RFs, eRF3 was reported to be an essential protein in eukaryotes [21], although later studies showed that
over-expression of eRF1 can restore translation termination activity in an eRF3 temperature sensitive mutant [5].
RF3, on the other hand, is a non-essential protein in bacteria with a patchy phylogenetic distribution [22].
In addition to their role in translation termination,
eukaryotic RFs participate in an RNA surveillance pathway
called Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) [5,23,24]. NMD

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

occurs when a premature stop codon is encountered during translation (for a review see [25]). During NMD, eRF1
and eRF3 are recruited to the ribosome and act as a platform for the assembly of the NMD multi-protein complex
on the mRNA. The NMD complex eventually targets the
corrupted message for rapid degradation by Dcp1–Dcp2,
Xrn1 and the exosome. At the core of the NMD complex
are the Upf proteins, which have conserved roles in animals, plants and yeast [26,27]. Upf1 in particular is
known to interact with eRF3 in animals and yeast, and its
presence in plants suggests eRF3/Upf1p involvement in
NMD may have arisen very early in eukaryotic evolution
[28].
Alongside NMD, two additional eukaryotic mRNA quality
control mechanisms have recently been discovered that
involve trGTPases. No-go Decay (NGD) also acts to
release ribosomes that are stalled on the mRNA [6]. The
onset of NGD in yeast involves the proteins Hbs1p, a
eukaryote-specific paralogue of eEF1A and eRF3 in the
EF1 family [15,16] and Dom34p (synonym Pelota), a paralogue of eRF1 [29,30]. Acting as a GTP Stabilising Factor
(GSF) [31], Hbs1p forms a ternary complex with GTP
(Dom34p·Hbs1p·GTP), similar to eRF3 and eRF1
[32,33]. The C-terminus of Hbs1p, which is homologous
with eRF3, is sufficient for the Hbs1p·Dom34p interaction, suggesting a similar architecture of complex formation in the two protein pairs [34]. mRNA cleavage is
central to NGD, and the RNase responsible is proposed to
reside within Dom34p, which has endonuclease activity
in the N termini in both the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and the archaeaon Thermoplasma acidophilum [32,35].
Thus, although more detailed biochemical analysis is
required, current data suggests aDom34p carries out its
role as an RNase without Hbs1p, just as aRF1 can fulfill its
role in termination without a functional eRF3 in archaea
and in the eukaryotic in vitro translational system [36].
Finally, non-stop decay (NSD), specifically involving
another eRF3/Hbs1p homologue Ski7p is so far known
only in S. cerevisiae [3,4]. This mechanism rescues translating ribosomes that have read through the stop codon
instead of terminating. In the proposed model, these
ribosomes translate the poly-A tail of the mRNA, adding a
poly-lysine tail to the newly synthesised protein. The
ribosome then stalls and Ski7p recruits the halted complex for degradation. From complementation experiments, it seems likely that Ski7p functions can be
performed by Hbs1p [37], thus it should be specified that
when we discuss NSD in the following, we refer specifically to the Ski7p-mediated NSD pathway unless stated
otherwise.
We have examined the evolution of both class-1 and class2 RF protein families across eukaryotes and archaea in
order to reconstruct evolution of their involvement in

mRNA quality control mechanisms. While related or similar mechanisms certainly occur that do not necessarily
involve these factors, this study is limited to those involving factors derived from eukaryotic and archaeal class-1
and class-2 release factor families. We predict an absence
of peptide release during NGD based on the absence of a
characteristic GGQ motif across the entire taxonomic distribution of Dom34p. Involvement of the a/eRF1 NIKS
and YXCXXXF motifs in stop-codon recognition is indirectly strengthened by their absence in Dom34p in all
examined organisms. Finally, Ski7p-mediated NSD
appears to be restricted to a subset of species in the genus
Saccharomyces.

Results
In order to investigate the evolution of RNA surveillance
mechanisms, we examined the distribution of eRF1/
Dom34p and eRF3/Hbs1p family members by extensive
database searching. This showed that e/aRF1 and
Dom34p are universal among examined eukaryotes and
archaea, and confirmed that eRF3 and Hbs1p are so far
missing entirely from archaea. Within eukaryotes, eRF3
appears to be universal, while Hbs1p is only missing from
several apicomplexan genera. To investigate the molecular
evolution of these proteins in more detail, taxonomically
broad alignments were created including representatives
of all paralogues. Separate alignments were constructed
for the two protein families that play central roles in
mRNA surveillance and translation termination, eRF1/
Dom34p and eRF3/Hbs1p/Ski7p. Consensus sequences
based on these alignments were then used to identify
regions of sequence conservation for comparison with
known structural and functional elements and alignments
were used to construct phylogenetic trees.
eRF1/Dom34p family alignment
eRF1 and Dom34p paralogues contain N (amino-terminal), M (middle) and C (carboxy-terminal) domains (fig.
1A and 1B). In the MAFFT alignment, all three domains
are aligned across all eRF1 and Dom34p proteins (fig. 1B).
The M and C domains, responsible for eRF3 binding in
eRF1 [10,11,38,39], share secondary and tertiary structure
conservation, confirming these two domains are homologous across the paralogues [35]. This conservation is also
seen at the sequence level, where it is strongest within conserved structural elements (fig. 1B). However, homology
is ambiguous in the N domain, particularly the extreme N
terminus, where secondary structure is unconserved. The
N termini also have different three dimensional folds in
eRF1 and Dom34p [35]. Thus, while it is most likely that
the N domains of eRF1 and Dom34p have a common
evolutionary origin, they have diverged considerably in
sequence, structure and therefore probably in function.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

N domain
In silico comparative analyses [40-43], genetic screening
[44], domain swapping [45,46], and biochemical studies
[20,45,47-49] all support stop codon recognition being
carried out in the N domain of eRF1. This activity particularly involves residues in and around the highly conserved
NIKS and YXCXXXF motifs (where X represents any
amino acid) (fig. 1B). The disruption of either of these
motifs has been shown to drastically impair the ability of
eRF1 to decode stop signals.

Both the NIKS and YXCXXXF motifs are found in the N
domain of all e/aRF1 with universal conservation (fig.
1B). However the S of NIKS is not 100% conserved, sometimes present as L, N or D. The only exceptions to the NIK
amino acids of the motif are the eRF1s of ciliates as previously reported [40,42]. Two previously unreported ciliate
paralogues (eRF1-2s; see below) also have variant NIKS
motifs but conserved YXCXXXF and GGQ motifs. Paramecium tetraurelia eRF1-2 has 60% identity to its eRF1-1,
and these versions have SIQD and SIKN motifs respectively. Tetrahymena thermophila eRF1-2 has 31% identity to
eRF1-1, and these have SIKN and NIKD motifs respectively. Although they carry the same motif, there is no evidence from the phylogeny that the SIKN versions are
orthologous (see below). YXCXXXF is also universal in all
sampled a/eRF1 sequences except for a small subgroup of
Archaea (Sulfolobus, Caldivirga and Hyperthermus), which
carry YXTXXXF. Neither NIKS or YXCXXXF are present in
Dom34p (fig 1B), suggesting that the N domain of
Dom34p has a substantially different role from that of e/
aRF1. Recent crystallographic analysis of S. cerevisae [32]
and Thermoplasma acidophilum [35] Dom34p, shows that
the α helical protuberance carrying NIKS in eRF1 is absent
in Dom34p and the β-region carrying YXCXXXF has a different architecture in the two proteins (fig. 1B, 2B).
The N domain of Dom34p has been suggested to responsible for the mRNA cleavage that is core to NGD, as this
domain in both archaea and yeast has been shown to display endonuclease activity [35]. Positions E41, E/D44 and
D45 (fig. 1B, 2B) appear to be important for this function
[35]. D45 is particularly well conserved, with all sampled
eukaryotic and archaeal Dom34p proteins carrying this
residue. D/E41 is 80% conserved across a/eDom34p, and
the sole exception to D/E44 is G. Lamblia, which has V44,
but does have E42 and E43. Thus, this acidic patch is a
highly conserved feature of Dom34p in both eukaryotes
and archaea, consistent with its involvement in the conserved endonuclease activity in Thermoplasma acidophilum
and S. cerevisiae Dom34p [35]. A conserved role of the N
domain in eukaryotes and archaea is also supported by
the yeast and archaeal Dom34p N terminal domains
being superimposable, although orientation differences

mean a conformational change would be required to
bring the S. cerevisiae protein's N domain into close proximity with mRNA [32].
M domain
Induction of peptide release by class-1 RFs in general and
e/aRF1 in particular, is completely dependent on a highly
conserved GGQ motif in the M domain of the protein
[12,50-53] (fig. 1B, fig. 2A). Interestingly, this sequence is
also found in the non-homologous bacterial class-1 RF
(RF1). RF1 penetrates the ribosomal peptidyl transferase
center and positions the GGQ residues adjacent to the
CCA-end of the P-site tRNA, thus participating directly in
peptide release [54]. Since there is very little sequence similarity otherwise between RF1 and e/aRF1, and their structures are quite different as well [9,55] this appears to be a
striking case of convergent evolution. Nonetheless, GGQ
is a universally conserved motif in the e/aRF1 M domain
(position 198–201, fig. 1B) where it lies at the end of a
long protruding arm (fig. 2A).

The GGQ motif is absent from Dom34p (fig. 1B). In fact,
in Dom34p, the region corresponding to the e/aRF1 GGQ
minidomain is poorly conserved in general including
multiple insertions/deletions. This is clearly seen in the
superimposition of the eRF1 and Dom34p structures (fig.
2B) [32,35]. The overall organization of the M domain in
the two proteins shares the same fold, but the tip of the M
domain carrying the GGQ motif in eRF1 is completely
absent from Dom34p so that the latter M domain appears
truncated by almost 50% relative to eRF1. Although
Dom34p from the apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum
contains a GGQ tripeptide in this vicinity, it is difficult to
ascertain homology due to the poor sequence conservation and multiple indels in this region (data not shown).
However, it is also unlikely that the C. parvum Dom34p
and eRF1 GGQ motifs are homologous due to the large
evolutionary distance between these proteins (see below).
Dom34p and eRF1 also contain a large conserved patch
around positions 239–248 (fig. 1B). This region is particPage 5 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:290

ularly strongly conserved in aRF1 and eRF1, as indicated
by the extent of the consensus sequence. Nonetheless, the
exact sequence at this position is not entirely conserved
between aRF1, eRF1, aDom34p and eDom34p, such that
there is no single universal residue among them. The
strongest conservation is residues 244–245 which are PG
throughout aRF1, aDom34p and eDom34p. The conservation of this patch suggests it is functionally important,
and its location in the M domain suggests that this function may involve positioning the stem of the protein on
the ribosome. The 244–245 consensus in eRF1 is the
chemically and structurally different motif SA, suggesting
an eRF1-specific role of this region in the structure.
eDom34p has been reported to contain a putative nuclear
localization signal (NLS), with the sequence PRKRK at
coordinates 192–196 (fig. 1B) [29,56,57]. We find a
"PrKrr" consensus sequence in eDom34p at this location.
This region is at an exposed position in the structure, near
the tip of eDom34p and thus would be accessible to
nuclear receptors. Similar motifs are also found in both
aRF1 (PGKHRk, 192–197) and eRF1 (PKKHGR, 192–
197), neither of which are nuclear-localised proteins,
strongly questioning the functionality of the putative NLS
in Dom34p. This is supported by experimental disruption
of this putative NLS [58] which showed that it is dispensable for eDom34p activity in vivo.
C domain
The most striking feature of the C-terminal domain of
eRF1/Dom34p is the GILRY motif (positions 441–445,
fig. 1B) implicated in eRF1 eRF3 complex formation [11].
This is actually part of a larger motif with the sequences
GFGGIGGILRY in eRF1 and AFGGIAAILRY in aRF1 (fig.
1B). It is surprising that this motif is so conserved in aRF1
since archaea lack eRF3. In fact, the archaeal version of
this motif is also well conserved in e/aDom34p, suggesting that its functional role extends beyond eRF3 binding.
A second region implicated in eRF1 eRF3 interaction is
position 307–331 (fig. 1B, Merkulova et al., 1999). This
shows some conservation in e/aDom34p, particularly
E309, I/L320, F/Y329 and G330. This stretch overlaps an
RNA-binding motif (positions 321–352, fig. 1B, 2A)
found in both eRF1 and Dom34p as well as eukaryotic/
archaeal ribosomal proteins L30e, L7Ae/S6e and S12 [30].
The conservation of this region across all families, particularly residues A337, A342 and L346, suggests it may have
a role in interaction with ribosomal RNA across the paralogues.

Following the GFGGIGGILRY/AFGGIAAILRY motif, eRF1
and eDom34p proteins carry a poorly aligned region that
is variable in length and rich in acidic amino acids [16].
This region has been implicated in eRF3 binding by eRF1
[10], although the lack of sequence conservation suggests

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

that composition is more important than sequence in this
region. Examination of the 48 available archaeal genomes
reveals a similar aRF1 acidic extension in all Caldivirga and
Pyrobaculum species, some Thermoproteaceae, and a shorter
version in all examined Ferroplasma and Thermoplasma
species (additional file 1).
Region 356–393 (fig. 1B, 2A), contains a large insertion in
a/eRF1 relative to a/eDom34p in all examined eukaryotes
and Euryarchaea. Where found, this extra sequence is
roughly similar in length but there is little sequence conservation, even within eukaryotes. There also appear to
have been a number of losses and small indels and the
insertion is most notably absent in some Crenarchaea and
in Nanoarchaeum equitans (additional file 2). This suggests
two independent losses may have occurred, one within
Crenarchaea and one in the lineage to N. equitans, which
can not be placed confidently in the phylogeny (see
below). The functional significance of this extra sequence
is unknown, but it forms a prominent highly exposed protuberance in the structure (fig. 2A).
Across the length of the proteins, a/eRF1 in general displays more sequence conservation than e/aDom34p. This
is apparent from the relative extent of their consensus
sequences (fig. 1B) as well as in their relative branch
lengths in the phylogenetic tree (see below). This suggests
that e/aRF1 is under more evolutionary constraint at the
sequence level than e/aDom34p.
Molecular phylogeny of eRF1/Dom34p family
An unrooted phylogeny of a/eRF1 and a/eDom34p M and
C domain sequences from archaea and eukaryotes (fig. 3)
shows the universal distribution of these subfamilies in all
examined taxa. To gain greater resolution of within subfamily relationships, separate phylogenies of a/eRF1 and
a/eDom34p were carried out using the full length alignment, with positions from the N, M and C domains (additional files 3 and 4). The branch support values from these
full length analyses are also indicated on figure 3 subtrees.
Eukaryotes are reproduced as a strongly supported monophyletic group by both proteins (1.0BIPP, 99% MLBP for
full length eRF1 and 1.0BIPP, 93% MLBP for full length
eDom34p), but neither aRF1 or aDom34p have support
for monophyly of archaea, which are weakly paraphyletic
in both subtrees. Although there is limited resolution, particularly in the M+C domain analyses, both proteins seem
to be vertically inherited in eukaryotes and archaea as
many major groups are reproduced with good support in
the independent full length (N+M+C) analyses, particularly with eDom34p (additional files 3 and 4). The
improved taxonomic resolution with eDom34p over eRF1
is probably due to the faster evolutionary rate of this protein, with the result that it contains more phylogenetic
information (i.e., more variable sites).

Phylogeny of the eRF1/Dom34p family. The tree shown was derived by Bayesian inference based on 178 universally
aligned positions of eRF1 and Dom34p amino acid sequences from the M and C domains. The analysis was terminated after 5
million generations, at which point the SDSF was 0.0205 and 500,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. Branch lengths
are drawn to scale as indicated by the scale bar at lower left. Branch support values from this analysis are indicated in black,
with BIPP in square brackets and MLBP without brackets. Only MLBP values greater than 50% and BIPP values great than 0.65
are displayed. Branch thickness is drawn proportional to BIPP values from separate phylogenetic analyses of full length a/eRF1
(349 positions, blue branches) and a/eDom34p (292 positions, purple branches) as indicated by the key to the right of the figure. Numbers in blue and purple italics correspond to MLBP support from the separate a/eRF1 and a/eDom34p phylogenetic

Several instances of eRF1 paralogues are found. A second,
divergent eRF1 from Tetrahymena thermophila is found
at a basal position among eukaryotes with strong support
(1.0BIPP, 94% MLBP with full length eRF1). This suggests
an ancient duplication, but the length of the branch
makes it hard to rule out artefactual long branch attraction
to the outgroup. The evolution of eRF1 in ciliates is of
interest, since some species possess variant genetic codes
for decoding stop codons. However, duplication of eRF1
has only previously been described in species of Euplotes
[59,60]. Phylogenetic analysis of a comprehensive ciliate
dataset shows several duplications within ciliates, all of
which are inparalogues (additional file 5). The exception
to this is the divergent T. thermophila eRF1-2, which has
an unstable long branch but does not appear to be an
orthologue of the extra eRF1 of Euplotes or of a previously
unidentified second eRF1 in Paramecium (additional file
5).
eRF3/Hbs1p family alignment
The eRF3/Hbs1p/Ski7p proteins consist of four domains:
N (N-terminal), G (GTPase), post-G and C (C-terminal)
(fig. 4A, 4B). G, post-G and C-domains are also found in
a/eEF1A, while N domains are only found in eRF3, Hbs1p
and Ski7p. The N domains are highly variable in sequence
and length and may have independent origins in these
paralogues. The G domain is highly conserved, typical of
all GTPases [19], and the C domain is essential for interactions with eRF1 [11,61,62].
N domain
The N-terminal domains of eRF3 and Hbs1p vary greatly
in length. In eRF3 its size ranges from being completely
absent in Giardia lamblia eRF3 [16], to 321 amino acids in
Leishmania major. In Hbs1p, the N-terminal domain of the
predicted proteins ranges in size across eukaryotes with
extremes of 27 amino acids in Aspergillus fumigatus to 367
in Neurospora crassa. This variability is consistent with an
N-domain role in species-specific regulation of protein
activity, as has been shown for eRF3 [63].

The N domains of eRF3 in several species of fungi have
repeats rich in Gln, Gly, Asn and Tyr (additional file 6)
and has been demonstrated to be prionogenic in some
species of yeast [64]. Interestingly, repeats of the same
composition are also found in the N terminal extensions
of eRF3 in the kinetoplastid protists Leishmania major and
Trypanosoma cruzi (additional file 6). However, given the
distant relationship between yeasts and kinetoplastids
these repeats are unlikely to be homologous. There is also
so far no evidence that the kinetoplastid repeats could be
prionogenic.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

G, Post-G and C domains
Strong conservation is seen throughout domains G, postG and C (fig. 4B), typical of most members of the EF1
superfamily [15]. Secondary structure is on the whole well
conserved between eRF3 and aEF1A (fig. 4B), as has been
seen in comparisons of eRF3 with eukaryotic (eEF1A) and
bacterial (EF-Tu) orthologues of aEF1A [65]. Conservation is greatest across families in the G (GTPase) domain
and drops slightly in the C terminal domain. Characteristic features of all GTPases, such as NKXD and (G/
A)XXXXGK(S/T) motifs are clearly visible in the alignment (fig. 4B) (for review see [66,67]). Within this
domain, a threonine residue found to be critical for termination activity of eRF3 [68] is universally conserved (position T358, fig. 4B). This residue is conserved across the
EF1 superfamily (fig. 4B) reflecting its important structural role in a core β-sheet adjacent to the GTPase switch
II (G3) motif that interacts with bound GTP/GDP [69].
The T358 of eRF3 is phosphorylated in vitro by a phosphorylation recognition site at alignment position 355–358
in S. cerevisiae eRF3 [68] (fig. 4B). However, the functional
significance of this is unclear as phosphorylation is not
observed in vivo [68].

The C terminal domain of eRF3 is responsible for
eRF1·eRF3 complex formation. However the exact position for this activity is not known, and evidence from
studies in different species seem to differ. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae, eRF3·eRF1 binding
requires the C-terminal one third of eRF3 (positions 566–
800, fig. 4B) [61]. In human eRF3, two smaller regions
have been implicated (positions 776–785 and 592–669)
[11]. In the ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus, eRF1 binding has
been localized to a region in-between, but not overlapping the human binding sites (positions 688–771) [62].
This could be a result of lineage-specific differences in
release factor interactions among eukaryotes. All of these
regions have good conservation in eRF3 (fig. 4B), and
indeed across the EF1 family. The exception to this is the
extreme C-terminal (776- end), the eRF1-interacting
decamer in humans [11] which is poorly conserved and
variable in length.
The motif GRFTLRD in eRF3 (760–766, fig 4B) is well
conserved and postulated to have an important role in
eRF1 interactions [65]. Our alignment shows that this
patch is also conserved across the EF1 family, especially
positions G760, R761 and R765 (fig. 4B). Mutagenesis in
S. pombe eRF3 identified F762 and R765 as necessary for
eRF1 binding [65]. As the residues important for eRF1
binding are also conserved in paralogues of eRF3, they
may be important for a more universal EF1 structure or
function rather than specific for eRF3 interactions with
eRF1.

Ski7p is a divergent variant of Hbs1p. It shows a low overall level of conservation including a striking number of
sometimes quite large insertions (fig 4B). Alignment
within the Post-G and C domains is especially poor. However, there is enough conservation to confirm homology,
especially at positions 644–650, 736–738 and 772–775
(fig. 4B). Quite a number of otherwise universal EF1 family motifs in the Post-G and C-terminal domains appear to
be lost completely from Ski7p, including the "GRFTLRD"
motif implicated in eRF1 interactions [65] (760–766, fig
4B). Loss of these motifs suggests that some activity common to the other EF1 family members has been lost from
Ski7p, although the functional significance of these motifs
is unknown.
Phylogenetic analysis of eRF3/Hbs1p family
Within the eRF3/Hbs1p families eRF3 is universal among
eukaryotes, while Hbs1p is nearly universal, missing only
from two of the three examined genera of Apicomplexa
(Plasmodium and Theileria; fig. 5). Surprisingly, these apicomplexans still encode the Hbs1p binding partner
eDom34p, including the C terminal extension thought to
be involved in eRF3 binding to eRF1 [10]. Shorter branch
lengths in the tree (fig. 5) and greater conservation across
all eukaryotes in the consensus alignment fig. 4B) show
that eRF3 generally experiences greater constraint on the
primary structure than Hbs1p, as is the case with their
binding partners, eRF1 and Dom34p (fig. 1B and 3).

From the alignment (Fig. 4B) and phylogenetic tree (fig.
5), it is clear that Ski7p is a paralogue of Hbs1p, found
only in a subset of saccharomycete yeasts. The highly
divergent nature of these sequences makes it difficult to
place them accurately within a full Hbs1p phylogeny,
which includes a number of other long branches (fig. 5).
However, without the latter sequences and with the additional Saccharomyces Hbs1p and Ski7p identified in
genomic TBLASTN searches, the Ski7p sequences form a
clade that strongly groups with the rest of the saccharomycete Hbs1p sequences (0.97 BIPP, 88%MLBP, Fig. 6).
The Ski7p group appears to arise early within this lineage,
possibly after the divergence of Debaryomyces (0.97 BIPP,
76%MLBP, fig. 6). Hbs1p and Ski7p have previously been
identified as occurring on syntenic blocks in the S. cerevisiae genome, suggestive of an origin in the whole genome
duplication (WGD) event thought to have occurred in the
Saccharomyces lineage after the divergence of Kluyveromyces
waltii [70]. Surprisingly however, the phylogeny in fig. 5
strongly suggests that Ski7p arose from an independent
earlier duplication event and was then lost from some lineages (1.0 BIPP, 81%MLBP). The observed synteny may
be a result of Hbs1p and Ski7p being adjacent in the
genome (following single gene duplication) at the time of
the WGD, with subsequent loss of one copy from each of
the old and new chromosomal locations. Whenever the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

precise timing of the origin of Ski7p, this protein clearly
arose in ascomycete yeast and in currently available
genomes, is limited to a closely related subset of Saccharomyces species.

Discussion
We have analysed datasets of the eRF1/Dom34p and
eRF3/Hbs1p/Ski7p protein families in eukaryotes and
archaea in order to reconstruct evolution of three different
mRNA quality control mechanisms that are known to be
governed by these proteins.
We find that Dom34p is universal in eukaryotes and
archaea. As the only biochemically demonstrated role of
Dom34p is in NGD in yeast, and given the sequence,
structural and functional similarities between archaeal
Dom34p and yeast Dom34p, we propose that NGD is
probably an ancient mechanism. We propose that NMD
on the other hand is probably restricted to eukaryotes,
while NSD specifically mediated by Ski7p is present only
in a subset of saccharomycete yeasts. However, NSD
mediated by Hbs1p may be more widespread.
Class-1 release factors, such as eRF1, perform two distinct
tasks during termination of protein synthesis – recognising the stop codon and then promoting release of the peptide chain. The former requires two motifs, NIKS and
YXCXXXF [45,48,49,71], see fig. 2A). We find that the
eRF1 homologue Dom34p, which functions in a process
devoid of stop codon recognition (NGD), lacks both
motifs (see fig. 1B). This is confirmed by the recently published Dom34p structures [32,35] where the whole GGQ
and NIKS regions are shown to be absent (fig. 2B).
The absence of the eRF1-specific motifs involved in the
stop-codon recognition in Dom34p corroborates well
with the available functional information suggesting
codon-independence of NGD. This mRNA decay mechanism is onset by ribosome stalls caused by hairpin loops
and pseudoknots in addition to rare codons, suggesting
that the trigger for NGD is a delay in the onset of elongation rather than the nature of the stall as such [6].
Peptide release by eRF1 is mediated by a GGQ motif at the
tip of the M domain (fig. 2A). Release of the nascent peptide greatly destabilises the ribosomal complex, prompting subunit dissociation [72]. The lack of GGQ in
Dom34p suggests an absence of peptide release in NGD,
with the ribosomal complex remaining stabilised. This
may serve to further minimise translation of the NGDdestined mRNA. As Dom34p acts as an endoribonuclease
in NGD [35], the stabilised complex may also anchor
Dom34p while it degrades the mRNA. It worth mentioning that this stabilisation is transient, since mRNA cleavage in the ribosomal A-site destabilises the ribosomal

Phylogeny of the Hbs1p/Ski7p families
Phylogeny of the Hbs1p/Ski7p families. The tree shown was derived by Bayesian inference phylogeny based on 395 universally aligned amino acid positions for Ski7p, Hbs1p, and eRF3 sequences. The tree includes all identified Ski7p sequences.
The analysis was terminated after 5 million generations, at which point the SDSF was 0.005, and 500,000 generations were discarded as burn-in. For sequences retrieved as nucleotides and translated into amino acids, the numbers in brackets indicate the
start and end coordinates of the genomic DNA that was matched in the TBLASTN search. Branch lengths designation, support
values and major taxon group designation are as in Figure 4.

complex, as seen in experiments with the bacterial toxin
RelE. This toxin, similarly to Dom34p, promotes mRNA
cleavage in the A-site, destabilising the mRNA and tRNA
binding to the ribosome ([72] and VH, unpublished
observations).
In yeast, NGD requires the concerted action of Dom34p
and Hbs1p. However, while Dom34p is universally
present in eukaryotes and archaea, Hbs1p is missing from

all examined archaea [15,16] as well as some Apicomplexa. Since the endonuclease activity in NGD appears to
reside entirely in Dom34p [35], NGD is most probably
present in archaea and Apicomplexa. The absence of both
eRF3 and Hbs1p homologues suggests that GTPase participation is dispensable in archaeal NGD as well as in termination. The situation in Apicomplexa is not as easy to
explain, but it appears that eDom34p has secondarily
acquired the ability to carry out its function without a

trGTPase binding partner. As restoration of translation termination in eRF3 temperature sensitive mutants is
restored by eRF1 overexpression [5], this suggests that
trGTPase involvement is not at the core of NGD or translation termination in eukaryotes. Rather, trGTPase
involvement appears to be more peripheral and may be
utilised mainly for improving efficiency by delivering the
binding partner with the main catalytic function to the
ribosome.
In the eRF1 family, three highly conserved patches were
found in the M and C domains (239–245, 321–352 and
438–446) (fig. 1B, 2A). All are located on the solvent-oriented face of eRF1 in complex with the ribosome, directly
opposite the ribosome-oriented face bearing NIKS and
GGQ motifs (see fig. 2A). Positions 321–352 correspond
to the RNA binding motif, presumably involved in ribosome binding [30], and positions 438–446 include the
GILRY motif, involved in eRF1·eRF3 interaction [11].
Although no specific function has been identified for
patch 239–245, its strong conservation across aRF1 and a/
eDom34p (fig. 1B) suggests that this region has an important functional role.
Intriguingly, the patches of conserved residues in eRF1
and eDom34p (fig. 1B) that have been implicated in
eRF1:eRF3 (and presumably eDom34p:Hbs1p) interaction [10,11,39] are also conserved in aRF1 and aDom34p
(fig. 1B). This is despite the fact that archaea lack eRF3 and
Hbs1p orthologues. This raises the question of whether
aRF1 and aDom34p could be interacting with another
eRF3/Hbs1p-like GTPase, the closest candidate for which
is aEF1A. However, we find no regions of aEF1A that are
obviously shared with eRF3 and Hbs1p to the exclusion of
eEF1A (fig. 4) and could therefore indicate retention of a
function lost in eEF1A. Additionally, the acidic C-terminal
extension that is also crucial for eRF1:eRF3 interaction
[10,16] is lacking in all aRF1s except for Caldivirga and
Pyrobaculum (additional file 1). The latter is probably of
independent origin and unrelated function. Thus the bulk
of the evidence still suggests that a trGTPase binding partner is not required for termination or NGD in archaea.
Although archaea may possess NGD, NMD is almost certainly missing in archaea because they lack eRF3 as well as
homologues of other components of the eukaryotic NMD
system such as Upf1-3 [28]. eRF3's role in NMD is closely
linked to the factor's functional interaction with the
mRNA polyA tail. Polyadenylation of mRNA in eukaryotes regulates mRNA stability, efficiency of translation and
transport (for a recent review see [73]). In eukaryotic
mRNAs, the polyA sequence and polyA-binding protein
(PABP) form a complex with the N-domain of eRF3 on
the terminating ribosome [24,74,75]. This interaction is
implicated in eRF3's functions in regulating polyA deadenylation via recruitment of the deadenylation complex

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

[76], stabilisation of the mRNA against the NMD [77] and
efficient translation initiation [78] and termination [79].
The abovementioned PABP/eRF3 interaction modulates
GTP binding to eRF3 [33] which could be one of the signals orchestrating the interplay between the translation
termination, initiation, mRNA depolyadenylation and
NMD. Thus, since eRF3 is dispensable for translation termination in archaea, the extensive functional connections
between eRF3 and the eukaryote-specific mRNA polyadenylation system might be the primary reason for its conservation in this domain of life. In fact, NMD may be a byproduct of this interaction. However, it should be mentioned that PABP/eRF3 interactions have only been studied in yeast and animals, where they have been seen to
involve the divergent N domain. Thus characterisation of
eRF3's role in the polyadenylation system in a wider range
of eukaryotes is required to understand further the evolutionary relationship between these processes.
Finally, Ski7p-mediated NSD seems to be unique to a subset of Saccharomycete yeasts (fig. 6). Among sequenced
genomes, we find Ski7p only in S. cerevisae, S. kudriavzevii,
S. bayanus, S. mikata and S. paradoxus. However, NSD
mediated by Hbs1p instead of Ski7p may operate in a
wider taxonomic range. Knock-out complementation
experiments showing that Hbs1p from S. kluyveri, a yeast
that does not carry Ski7p, can complement an S. cerevisiae
Ski7p deletion mutant [37]. This suggests a scenario
where Dom34p·Hbs1p complexes act in both NSD and
NGD. It is not known at present how widespread Hbs1pmediated NSD might be in eukaryotes. However, it is
tempting to link Ski7p/Hbs1p-mediated NSD with the
[PSI+] prionogenic property of eRF3 that is known from
several yeast species [64], such as S. cerevisae which uses
this property to regulate termination potential in the cell.
Here, termination efficiency is lowered with the formulation of insoluble eRF3 amyloid fibers in the [PSI+] state or
elevated with a transition to the soluble [psi-] state. The
PSI+ state can result in up to 16% stop codon readthrough [80], which results in longer protein isoforms
than are produced in the [psi-] state. However, this also
creates a lot of read-through nonsense. Thus, organisms
with [PSI+] activity might benefit from an extra mRNA
surveillance system that specifically targets read-through
messages.
This hypothesis is consistent with the recent finding that
Ski7p deletion enhances the observed [PSI+] phenotype
[81], which suggests a link between these phenomena.
Many yeasts show an eRF3 [PSI+] phenotype caused by N
domains rich in Gln, Gly, Asn and Tyr [64]. We find similar N domains in the eRF3 proteins from a range of sampled fungi, including the basidiomycete Cryptococcus
neoformans (additional file 6). This suggest that [PSI+]
activity originated quite early in fungi, before the basidiomycete/ascomycete split. Thus it is possible that the [PSI+]
Page 13 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:290

phenotype predates, and perhaps provided the driving
force for the specialisation of the Hbs1p duplicate Ski7p
in Saccharomycetale NSD.

Conclusion
Based on these results we hypothesise the following scenario (fig. 7). We propose that the last common ancestor
of eukaryotes and archaea possessed Dom34p-mediated
NGD. This Dom34p may or may not have required a
trGTPase for its delivery to the ribosome (the most likely
candidate for which would have to be EF1A). Then, at an
early stage in eukaryotic evolution, a duplication of the
eEF1A gene occurred. One paralogue became eRF3 and
was recruited for the termination stage of protein synthesis, interacting with release factor eRF1. This eRF3-type
protein evolved NMD-activity before or after it was again
duplicated. This second duplication gave rise to modern
eRF3 and Hbs1p, with the latter being recruited for NGD.
These two duplication events occurred very early in
eukaryotic evolution, well before the last common ancestor of all extant taxa. Finally, a third duplication within
ascomycete yeast gave rise to Ski7p, which may have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/290

become more specialised for a subset of existing Hbs1p
function in NSD. The origin of Hbs1p-mediated NSD is
unknown, but we propose that Ski7p NSD may be a specialised mechanism for counteracting the effects of
increased stop codon read-through caused by [PSI+] eRF3
precipitation. Biochemical investigation of these mechanisms in a wider range of eukaryotes is required to test
these hypotheses. Particularly, verification of NGD function of Dom34p in archaea is required, and further investigation of the taxonomic range of Hbs1p-mediated NSD.
Thus, it seems that the evolution of mRNA decay systems
in eukaryotes has been driven by eRF1 and eRF3 gene
duplications. Interestingly, these two proteins have experienced a number of additional duplications in eukaryotes. Mammals encode two versions of eRF3, which differ
mainly in their N terminal domains [82,83] and plants
can encode up to three copies of eRF1 [84]. This could be
explained by the existence of a diversity of cellular pathways utilising termination events as check points in
mRNA metabolism. This also suggests the existence of
additional pathways for regulation of mRNA decay and

Methods

Authors' contributions

Amino acid sequences of eRF1 and Dom34p were
retrieved from the NCBI non redundant (nr) database
using BLASTP with Saccharomyces cerevisiae query
sequences. More divergent members of the aRF1 and
aDom34p subfamilies were retrieved using Sulfolobus solfataricus query sequences. Preliminary alignments and
Neighbour Joining phylogenetic trees were derived using
Clustal X [85] to confirm the orthology of various members of the eRF1 and Dom34p families (data not shown).
Based on these trees, the dataset was trimmed down to a
taxonomically broad subset of archaeal and eukaryotic
sequences to form the dataset "eRF1/Dom34p." Additional ciliate eRF1 sequences were added to create dataset
"Ciliate eRF1" using sequences identified by a similar
BLASTP search limited by taxonomy to Ciliates.

GCA carried out sequence searching and phylogenetic
analysis. VH conceived of the study and carried out structural analysis. GCA and VH participated in the design of
the study and drafted the manuscript. SLB helped draft the
manuscript and participated in the coordination of the
study. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

A taxonomically broad set of archaeal and eukaryotic
eRF3, Hbs1p, aEF1A, eEF1A and Ski7p sequences was
downloaded from a local database (trGTPase database,
http://www.GTPbase.org.uk, GCA unpublished). Second
copies of eRF3 in mammals, which differ mostly in their
N terminal domain sequences [86] were not included.
Ski7p and Hbs1p gene sequences from additional Saccharomyces species were retrieved from the NCBI Core Nucleotide database using a TBLASTN search limited to
"Saccharomycetales" and using S. cerevisiae Ski7p and
Hbs1p protein sequences as queries. Sequences were
translated to amino acids using the Emboss Transeq web
application [87].
Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v6.234b with strategy L-INS-I [88]. Consensus sequences were computed
with the Python program ConsensusFinder (available
upon request from GCA). Large gaps and ambiguously
aligned regions in the alignments were excluded from
subsequent phylogenetic analyses using Bioedit [89]
(additional files 7 and 8). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian Inference (B1) with MrBayes 3.1.2
and maximum likelihood (ML) with RAxML-VI-HPC
2.2.3 [90]. MrBayes was run for 5 million generations
under a mixed amino acid model with a gamma correction for rate variation among sites. Runs consisted of 2
sets of 1 cold and 3 heated chains, with the output saved
("sampled") every 1000 generations. Consensus trees
were calculated after 500,000 generations were discarded
as burn-in. Maximum likelihood bootstrapping with
RAxML was run with the PROTMIXJTT model with 25 per
site rate categories and 100 bootstrap replicates.
Structures were visualized and prepared as figures with
PyMOL molecular visualization system http://
