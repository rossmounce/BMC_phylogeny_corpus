Abstract
Background: Bathymodiolus azoricus is a deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussel found in association with large
faunal communities living in chemosynthetic environments at the bottom of the sea floor near the Azores Islands.
Investigation of the exceptional physiological reactions that vent mussels have adopted in their habitat, including
responses to environmental microbes, remains a difficult challenge for deep-sea biologists. In an attempt to reveal
genes potentially involved in the deep-sea mussel innate immunity we carried out a high-throughput sequence
analysis of freshly collected B. azoricus transcriptome using gills tissues as the primary source of immune transcripts
given its strategic role in filtering the surrounding waterborne potentially infectious microorganisms. Additionally, a
substantial EST data set was produced and from which a comprehensive collection of genes coding for putative
proteins was organized in a dedicated database, “DeepSeaVent” the first deep-sea vent animal transcriptome
database based on the 454 pyrosequencing technology.
Results: A normalized cDNA library from gills tissue was sequenced in a full 454 GS-FLX run, producing 778,996
sequencing reads. Assembly of the high quality reads resulted in 75,407 contigs of which 3,071 were singletons.
A total of 39,425 transcripts were conceptually translated into amino-sequences of which 22,023 matched known
proteins in the NCBI non-redundant protein database, 15,839 revealed conserved protein domains through InterPro
functional classification and 9,584 were assigned with Gene Ontology terms. Queries conducted within the
database enabled the identification of genes putatively involved in immune and inflammatory reactions which had
not been previously evidenced in the vent mussel. Their physical counterpart was confirmed by semi-quantitative
quantitative Reverse-Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) and their RNA transcription level by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments.
Conclusions: We have established the first tissue transcriptional analysis of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent animal
and generated a searchable catalog of genes that provides a direct method of identifying and retrieving vast
numbers of novel coding sequences which can be applied in gene expression profiling experiments from a
non-conventional model organism. This provides the most comprehensive sequence resource for identifying novel
genes currently available for a deep-sea vent organism, in particular, genes putatively involved in immune and
inflammatory reactions in vent mussels.
The characterization of the B. azoricus transcriptome will facilitate research into biological processes underlying
physiological adaptations to hydrothermal vent environments and will provide a basis for expanding our
understanding of genes putatively involved in adaptations processes during post-capture long term acclimatization
experiments, at “sea-level” conditions, using B. azoricus as a model organism.

Background
Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems are driven by
unique physical, geochemical and biological processes
with specialized energy sources at the origin of the
trophic web. Since the discovery of hydrothermal vents
and their associated fauna in the Galapagos Rift, evidence of the establishment of dense faunal communities
based on chemosynthesis have mounted over the past
decades, and generally in relation to areas where tectonic movements and deep ocean volcanism are active
[1]. Hydrothermal vent ecosystems are characterized by
the synthesis of organic matter by means of chemoautotrophic bacteria using reduced elements extracted
from the hydrothermal fluids as source of energy [2,3].
Mussels in the genus Bathymodiolus are biomass
dominant at many known deep-sea hydrothermal vent
and cold seep habitats. Survival in such extreme conditions requires unique anatomical and physiological
adaptations. For example the development of specialized
gill epithelial cells harboring methanotrophic and thiotrophic endosymbiont bacteria constitutes one the best
recognized adaptation strategies to chemosynthetic
environments [4]. Dual symbiosis thus provides a clear
nutritional advantage to Bathymodiolid mussels, allowing them to obtain energy from both sulfide and
methane at the vent sites [5-7]. Near the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, and in the vicinity of the Azores region, Bathymodiolus azoricus subsists at vent sites, amid unusual
levels of heavy metals, pH, temperature, CO2, methane
and sulfide, while coping successfully with environmental microbes [8].
Despite its prominence as a model to study physiological adaptation to extreme physical and chemical conditions [9], there is currently no large scale genome project
for Bathymodiolus species. Gene expression profiles are
limited to a few EST projects mainly originated from the
Evolution and Genetics of Marine Populations team at
the Biological Station of Roscoff, France. In a recent analysis, the screening of cDNA libraries from whole bodies
of B. azoricus resulted in 362 contigs and 1,918 singletons. Many genes known to be involved in both metallic
and oxidative stress responses were then identified [10].
However, these data remain private and there is currently
no published reports based on those sequences. More
recently, the effect of temperature on the vent mussel B.
thermophilus was investigated by means of subtractive
suppression hybridization experiments aimed at the identification of genes differentially expressed in response to
different temperatures regimes [11].
Thus far, knowledge of deep-sea biology or of the
molecules involved in the maintenance of homeostasis
in hydrothermal vent animals has been limited in part
by the lack of information about their genomes and systematic sequencing of expressed sequence tags to

identify protein coding genes on a large scale. The deepsea vent biological systems represent the opportunity to
study and provide new insights into the basic physiological principles that govern the defense mechanisms in
vent animals and to understand how they cope with
microbial infections. The problem of microbial threat
and the need for immunity exist in both deep sea and
shallow water bivalves however differences in the genes
of marine organisms living in so distinct habitats are
likely to occur. In order to significantly increase the
number of B. azoricus genes in the public database and
to discover new deep-sea vent adaptation-related genes
in B. azoricus, and particularly for immune-related
genes we have conducted a high-throughput experimental approach using pyrosequencing, on the 454 GS FLX
(Roche-454 Life Sciences) with Titanium chemistry, to
sequence the transcriptome of B. azoricus gill tissues. In
the absence of a reference genome, this sequence
method, which has not yet been widely applied to
hydrothermal vent animals, holds great potential for discovery of genes and genetic markers in unconventional
model species through de novo transcriptome sequence
assembly. The assembled and annotated sequences were
produced and have been organized in a dedicated database, accessible through the website, http://transcriptomics.biocant.pt:8080/deepSeaVent providing an
extensive catalog of genes expressed in gill tissues harboring immune cells, the hemocytes, of the deep-sea
vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus.

Results and Discussion
Sequence analysis

A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA of fresh
gill tissues from Bathymodiolus azoricus collected at
deep-sea vents and sequenced in a single GS FLX Titanium plate. A total of 778,996 raw nucleotide reads
were produced with an average length of 283 bp, corresponding to 223.7 Mb. After removal of the SMART
adaptors, by a custom script, the sequences were
assembled with the MIRA software. A total of 582,650
quality reads were assembled into 75,407 contigs of
which 3,071 were singletons corresponding to a total of
38,8 Mb. The length of the consensus sequences varied
from 40 bp to 3,400 bp, with an average length of 509
bp. A summary of data is indicated in Table 1.
3,416 contigs were longer than 1 Kb, and 270 longer
than 1.5 Kb. The distribution of contig length and EST
assembly by contig are shown in Fig 1.
Functional annotation

The contigs were annotated taking into consideration
the identity of the translation frame, the conserved protein domains and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. To obtain
the translation frame, all contigs were queried against

the NCBI protein database (nr) using BLASTx algorithm
[12], resulting in 18,407 significant matches for an
E-value ≤ 10 -6 . The process was repeated for contigs
without hits, increasing the E-value cut-off to 10-2, and
resulting in the identification of 3,616 additional contigs.
The remaining contigs were processed through the
ESTscan application [13], from which it was possible to
identify the coding frame for 17,402 additional contigs.
A total of 42,073 putative amino-acids sequences was
obtained following this approach. The entire set of
amino-acid sequences hits was queried against the InterPro database of protein families and functional domains
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterPro [14,15], from which
15,839 were identified as bearing conserved protein
domains. The same set of sequences was annotated with
Gene Ontology (GO) terms resulting in 9,584 functional
assignments according to the organizing principles of
GO describing gene products and their properties. This
classification scheme was useful to assign Bathymodiolus
contigs to one of the major GO annotation categories,
i.e., Biological Processes, Cellular Components and
Molecular Functions in a species-independent manner
[16] (Fig 2).
The largest proportion of GO assigned sequences fell
into broad categories for all three major GO functional
domains as presented in Fig 2. Within the Biological
Process, 31% and 32% of assignments corresponded to
“Cellular Process” (GO:0009987) and “Metabolic Process
(GO:0008152) respectively, followed by the “Localization” (GO:0051179, 7%) and “Establishment of Localization” (GO:0051234, 7%) GO categories. Furthermore,
the matches of molecular function terms were most

prevalent within the “Binding” (GO:0005488, 46%) and
“Catalytic Activity” (GO:0003824, 33%), followed by the
categories “Structural Molecule Activity” (GO:0005198,
8%) and “Transporter Activity” (GO:0005215, 5%).
Finally for the Cellular Component GO the most evident matches were within the “Cell Part” (GO:0044464,
31%) and “Cell” (GO:0005623, 31%) terms, followed by
“Organelle” (GO:0043226, 16%) and “Macromolecular
Complex” (GO:0032991, 12%). Together, these GO
classes accounted for most of the assignable transcripts,
and may represent a general gene expression profile signature for B. azoricus from the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent field.
The contigs without any homology may correspond to
one of the following categories: a) novel or diverged
amino acid coding sequences that are specific to Bathymodiolus species, b) represent mostly 3’ or 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) that would lack protein matches as
they are non-coding or c) contain sequences to short to
result in significant hits.
Despite that the Gene Ontology project is aimed at
describing gene product characteristics and gene product annotation data, by ways of a direct acyclic graph
(DAG) structure of controlled vocabularies, the process
of assigning GO terms to gene products might prove
difficult given the current GO structured vocabulary and
the systematic relationship between the GO terms. This
follows from the fact that GO describes how gene products behave in a cellular context and thus a gene product might be associated with or located in one or more
cellular components; it is active in one or more biological processes, during which it performs one or more
molecular functions.
Immunity, stress and bacterial genes in Bathymodiolus
azoricus gills

The innate immune system acts to protect the individual
from invasive bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotic pathogens
by detecting molecular signatures of infection and initiating effector responses. It probably originated early in animal phylogeny and is intimately related with wound
healing and tissue maintenance functions among invertebrates [17]. This defense system is essential for the survival
of invertebrates which do not possess immunoglobulins
and rely on unique capabilities to detect and respond to
microbe associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids, lipoproteins,
peptidoglycan (PGN) and (1®3) b-D-glucans [18] present
on the cell surface of microorganisms. Upon recognition
of the MAMPs, signal transduction molecules and transcription factors are set to mediate and control the expression of immune effector molecules, for example, the
antimicrobial peptides. The vent mussel B. azoricus has
been the subject of previous studies, in our laboratory,

aiming at the characterization of its cellular and humoral
immune reactions as a means to better understand physiological adaptations to vent environments. Given the limited immune gene expression information available for
this non-conventional model organism, a query-based
strategy was used to identify coding sequences within the
DeepSeaVent database, for the selection and retrieval of
nucleic acid information of cDNAs corresponding to
genes potentially involved in immune and inflammatory
reactions. Therefore, the selection of candidate genes
presented in Table 2 was based on queries using specific

descriptors matching immunity and inflammation-related
criteria allowing thus the identification and retrieval of
relevant cDNA sequences from the transcriptome library.
The identification of putative genes was based on GO
annotation and querying the DeepSeaVent database

A number of putative genes which have not previously
been identified in B. azoricus were classified within the
context of GO representation and to one of the following immune categories: immune recognition, signal
transduction, transcription and effector molecules

and are likely representing the transcriptional activity at
the time animals were collected from the bottom of the
sea (Fig 5). Particularly, the metal-binding metallothionein gene was highly expressed in the non-normalized
transcriptome library, probably reflecting the physiological need for continuous production of this protein to
overcome the metal stress occurring at vent sites and to
regulate intracellular levels of metals. Other immune
response representatives also showed increased levels of
expression as compared to the remaining genes studied.

different cDNA abundance as PCR amplifications
revealed different amplicon intensities for some of the
confirmed genes, presumably due to different mRNAs
prevalence in the normalized cDNA library (Fig 4). This
was further analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) utilizing non-normalized cDNA as template for amplification
of immune-related genes. Indeed, results demonstrated
the differential abundance of transcripts in the non-normalized transcriptome library confirming that genes
tested in our study are not expressed at the same level

These include immune recognition molecule aggrecan
and c-lectin, cell signalling molecule integrin, signal
transduction complex component IRAK, and antibacterial protein defensin, (Fig 5), all providing evidence of a
functional immune system in B. azoricus.
The selected putative genes are being currently investigated under controlled conditions in our laboratory, to
assess the effect of long-term acclimatization in aquaria
at atmospheric pressure, the effect of de novo hyperbaric
stimulations in the IPOCAMP chamber and the effect
of exposure to marine Vibrio bacteria, on B. azoricus
transcript profiling experiments [20,21].
Furthermore, this search-based analysis was also particularly important to determine a “bacterial fingerprint” in
B. azoricus gill tissues, since we expected the vent mussel
to have a rich microorganismal community and more
specifically a substantial accumulation of endosymbiont
bacteria within its gill tissues. The selection of poly-A
RNA as the starting material for our transcriptome
library likely eliminated many potential microbial
sequences. However, 3,522 contigs in DeepSeaVent presented protein match hits to bacterial phylotypes, supporting the evidence for the presence of bacteria in gill

tissues of B. azoricus, and representing thus a potential
bacterial fingerprint, most likely of chemoautotrophic
nature, in deep-sea hydrothermal vent mussels. Additionally, a number of bacterial sequences were ascribed to
several non-cultured marine bacteria, to chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur- or methane-oxidizing bacteria as evidenced, for instance, by the presence of the SoxB, SoxY,
SoxH, methane monooxygenase, Biopolymer transport
protein ExbD/TolR genes when querying our database
using InterPro or GO terms as “methane” or “sulfur”.
Similarly, searches using the genera Calyptogena and Riftia names returned several hundreds of putative protein
sequences, the majority of which associated to endosymbionts from the giant hydrothermal vesicomyid clam and
vestimentiferan tubeworm, respectively from the East
Pacific Rise hydrothermal region.
Such an approach has the potential to reveal sequences
that have apparent bacterial origin including many genera
of species that have been associated with mussel pathogens or as normal flora in the gut system [22]. In this case,
mutualistic interaction between symbiont bacteria and
their animal hosts may be taken to another level of analysis based on transcriptome sequencing. New genes

1,923 amino-acid sequences, respectively, were identified.
Furthermore, the shared amino-acid sequences were analyzed in relation to the distribution of GO functional
annotation categories, using the 4,120 sequences
retrieved with a bit score of 120. The highest percentage
of common GO-annotated sequences (50% sharing and
above) between the two databases corresponded to the
categories, Cell Killing, Cellular Component Biogenesis,
Macromolecular Complex and Structural Molecule
Activity (Table 3).
The biological significance of these findings was not
immediately evaluated due the comparatively low amount
of amino-acid sequences available in the Mytibase as compared to DeepSeaVent. However, representatives of broad
GO categories are present in both Mytibase and DeepSeaVent databases, suggesting that mussels originated
from distinct marine habitat may share common biological
processes, cellular components and molecular functions.
Such inter-database computational analyses offers now
the potential to unravel genes specifically involved in
hydrostatic pressure and chemosynthetic environmental
adaptations by comparing transcriptome profiles from
two closely related Mytilid family members living in
very distinct marine habitats.

involved in host recognition of endosymbionts and
immune-effector mechanisms underlying host defense
responses may shed light into understanding mutualism
better and provide explanations as to how endosymbiont
bacteria, living inside the bacteriocytes of vent mussels, are
able to evade immune recognition, during early stages of
acquisition and how mutualism is maintained. One possible explanation might lie within the immune response
itself, where constitutive immune responses of bacteriocytes towards the dense population of endosymbionts,
might be expressed at different levels of the rest of the
body and therefore, keeping endosymbionts under control
[22]. This hypothesis is currently under experimental consideration in our laboratory.
Deep-sea vent mussel comparison to shallow water
mussel

The DeepSeaVent database was compared to Mytibase, a
recently created EST database from the shallow water
mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis [23]. The comparison
was restricted to the amino-acid sequences with InterPro
annotation from both databases and by setting the
BLAST parameters to an E-value of 10-5 and bit scores
ranging from 90 to 200. Under such conditions 5,261 and

Conclusions
Comparison of our results with recently published transcriptomic studies on B. azoricus confirms the efficacy
of 454 sequencing to reveal a large number of putative
transcripts and significantly improve the genomic
knowledge on this deep sea animal. The use of 454 pyrosequencing to develop a new EST collection containing
potentially 39,425 new transcripts provides a new
resource for genome-wide association studies of vent
mussel physiological variations, which is the focus of
ongoing projects in our laboratory, addressing in particular the molecular adaptation mechanisms of B. azoricus to deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments. This
new resource now gathered in the DeepSeaVent database will set the stage for innovative work and the
establishment of large scale expression studies to validate the deep-sea vent mussel as a bone fide experimental model to study the biology of adaptation to deep-sea
hydrothermal vent environments.
Methods
Animals sampling

Mussels were collected from the hydrothermal vent field
Lucky Strike (37° 13.52’ N, 32° 26.18’ W; 1700 m depth),
on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), with the American R/
V Revelle using the ROV Jason II (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), during the MAR08 cruise (July 9th August 16th 2008) led by Chief Scientist Dr Anna-Louise
Reysenbach. Once the mussels were brought to the surface, they were immediately processed onboard for subsequent manipulation of RNA or immediately stored at
-80°C for long-term preservation of tissue samples.
cDNA library construction and pyrosequencing

Gill tissues from 6 different animals were dissected from
-80°C preserved animals and processed for total RNA
extraction using the RiboPure(tm) kit (Ambion(r), Austin,
TX). The quality of total RNA was verified on a 1.4%
(w/v) agarose-MOPS-formaldehyde denaturating gels
and by assessing the A260/280 and A260/230 ratios using the
NanoVue spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Poly-A RNA was extracted from each total
RNA sample using the Poly(A)Purist(tm) mRNA Purification Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Ambion Inc, Applied Biosystems). The mRNA from
each gill tissue sample from all 6 animals (approximately
20-50 μg/ml) was pooled and used as the source of starting material for cDNA synthesis and the production of
normalized cDNA intended for 454 sequencing. The normalization process was performed by Evrogen (Moscow,
Russia) and based on the SMART double-stranded
cDNA synthesis methodology using a modified templateswitching approach that allows the introduction of
known adapter sequences to both ends of the first-strand

Page 12 of 17

cDNA. cDNA was further amplified by PCR and normalized using Duplex-Specific Nuclease-technology [24,25].
Four micrograms of normalized cDNA were sequenced
in a full plate of 454 GS FLX Titanium according to the
standard manufacturer’s instructions (Roche-454 Life
Sciences, Brandford, CT, USA) at Biocant (Cantanhede,
Portugal).
Sequence processing, data analysis and functional
annotation

Following 454 sequencing, the quality trimming and size
selection of reads were determined by the 454 software
after which the SMART adaptor sequences were
removed from reads using a custom script and the polyA masked using MIRA, to assure correct assembly of
raw sequencing reads [26]. A total of 778,996 quality
reads were subjected to the MIRA assembler [26] (version 3.0.5), with default parameters, yet only 582,650
reads were assembled. For some reads, after masking
the poly-A, the sequence length was shorter than 40 bp,
otherwise the minimum length assumed by the MIRA
default parameter settings. The software also disregards
all reads that do not match any other read or that
belong to the megahub group, i.e. a read that is massively repetitive with respect to other reads. Such reads
are considered singlets and were not included in the
final assembly result. On the other hand, singletons
were defined as reads that match other reads but neither
do have sufficient coverage nor present conditions to
assemble with them. The entire set of reads used for
final assembly was submitted to the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive under the accession n° SRA024338 (Submission: SRA024338.1/Bathymodiolus azoricus).
The translation frame of the contigs was determined
through queries against the NCBI non redundant protein database using BLASTx with an E-value of 10-6 and
assessing the best twenty five hits. Contigs without hits
were submitted again to BLASTx homology searches
against the NCBI nr database with a higher E-value cutoff set at 10-2. Sequences with a translation frame identification derived from the two previous searches were
used to establish the preferential codon usage in B. azoricus based on which the software ESTScan detected
further potential transcripts from the two previous sets
of sequences with yet no BLASTx matches. This procedure originated a third set of sequences with putative
amino-acid translation. To illustrate the outline flow for
the transcriptome annotation procedure a diagram is
shown in Fig 6.
The entire collection of sequences of at least 30
amino-acid long, resulting from the BLASTx and the
ESTScan procedures, was processed by InterProScan for
the prediction of protein domain signatures and Gene
Ontology terms. All the results were compiled into a

SQL database developed as an information management
system.
The distribution of sequences into GO categories was
calculated at each level and were passed to the parent
GO at the top of the broad ontology domains, considering that each single assignment into a GO child was
only counted once in the total sum. This information
was also useful to establish the number of amino-acid
sequences shared between the two Mytibase and DeepSeaVent databases.

The retrieval of sequence information matching bacterial phylotypes was based on a convergent analysis of
bacterial hits among the best BLASTx hits. The number
of positive hits was calculated and plotted according to
the position of best hit ranging from the first to the
twentieth. A convergent number of bacterial hits was
found at 3,522 contigs (Fig 7). The unique identifiers of
the 3,522 contigs (gi accession number) were retrieved
and translated into the taxon ID using the information
provided by NCBI. A custom script based on the BioPerl

module bio::db::taxonomy, version 1.6 [27], was used to
link the taxon of interest to the superkingdom Bacteria
and verify whether or not the BLASTx hit corresponded
indeed to the canonical Eubacterial sequences.
Identification of candidate genes putatively associated
with immunity and inflammatory reactions

Candidate genes were selected following queries performed to our database using distinct search descriptors
based on BLAST hit descriptions; GO descriptions;
Interpro descriptions, GO and Interpro identification
numbers. Queries were aimed at the identification of
genes described in the literature as being related to
immunity and inflammatory reactions. ReverseTranscription followed by Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) was performed to confirm the physical identity of the selected genes recognized among the 454ESTs using the normalized cDNA. 2 μg of total RNA,
initially used to generate the transcriptome library, were
reverse transcribed using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR
system (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s
instructions. All the contig sequences from putative
immune genes were submitted to GenBank and assigned
the accession numbers HM756110 to HM756130;
HM756132 to HM756134; HM756136 to HM756149;
HM756151 and HM756152 (Table 4).
Primers targeting the immune candidate genes were
designed using the Primer-Blast [28] from NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, specifying an expected PCR product of 200-300 bp and primer annealing temperatures
between 56°C and 58°C. 25 μl PCR volume reactions
were set with 1 μl of each forward and reverse primers

(0.5 μM final concentration) and using a 2× PCR mix
from PROMEGA (Madison, USA). PCR cycling conditions were according to Bettencourt et al. 2009 [29].
PCR products were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis according to standard methods.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was further used to assess
and quantify the relative expression of the candidate
genes previously tested on semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
The non-normalized cDNA was obtained as previously
described and consisting of the same cDNA utilized for
subsequent normalization and 454 sequencing procedure. Quantitative PCR reactions were performed on the
CFX96™ Real Time PCR System mounted onto the
C1000 Thermal Cycling platform (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Amplifications were carried out using 0.5 μl (10 μM) of
the specific primers as for semi-quantitative PCR and
mixed to 10 μl of SsoFast™ Eva Green SuperMix (SYBR
based system, Bio-Rad) and 50 ng of cDNA in a final
volume of 20 μl. PCR cycling conditions were 95°C for 3
min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C 10 s, 58 °C 15 s and
72 °C 30 s. 6 replicates were performed for each gene
tested in real time PCR reactions. Melt curves profiles
were analyzed for each gene tested. The 28S rRNA gene
was used as the housekeeping gene and for normalization of expression of gene of interest or immune-related
target genes. The comparative CT method (ΔΔC T )
for the relative quantification of gene expression was
used for assessing the normalized expression value of
immune-related genes using the 28S rRNA as the control transcript (CFX Manager™ Software, Bio-Rad). Data
were transferred to Excel files and plotted as histograms
of normalized fold expression of target genes.
