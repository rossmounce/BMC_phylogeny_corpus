Abstract
Background: Sexual dimorphism in brain gene expression has been recognized in several animal species.
However, the relevant regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. To investigate whether sex-biased gene
expression in mammalian brain is globally regulated or locally regulated in diverse brain structures, and to study
the genomic organisation of brain-expressed sex-biased genes, we performed a large scale gene expression
analysis of distinct brain regions in adult male and female mice.
Results: This study revealed spatial specificity in sex-biased transcription in the mouse brain, and identified 173
sex-biased genes in the striatum; 19 in the neocortex; 12 in the hippocampus and 31 in the eye. Genes located on
sex chromosomes were consistently over-represented in all brain regions. Analysis on a subset of genes with sexbias in more than one tissue revealed Y-encoded male-biased transcripts and X-encoded female-biased transcripts
known to escape X-inactivation. In addition, we identified novel coding and non-coding X-linked genes with
female-biased expression in multiple tissues. Interestingly, the chromosomal positions of all of the female-biased
non-coding genes are in close proximity to protein-coding genes that escape X-inactivation. This defines Xchromosome domains each of which contains a coding and a non-coding female-biased gene. Lack of repressive
chromatin marks in non-coding transcribed loci supports the possibility that they escape X-inactivation. Moreover,
RNA-DNA combined FISH experiments confirmed the biallelic expression of one such novel domain.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the amount of genes with sex-biased expression varies between
individual brain regions in mouse. The sex-biased genes identified are localized on many chromosomes. At the
same time, sexually dimorphic gene expression that is common to several parts of the brain is mostly restricted to
the sex chromosomes. Moreover, the study uncovered multiple female-biased non-coding genes that are nonrandomly co-localized on the X-chromosome with protein-coding genes that escape X-inactivation. This raises the
possibility that expression of long non-coding RNAs may play a role in modulating gene expression in domains
that escape X-inactivation in mouse.

Background
Emerging evidence indicates that the regulatory pathways underlying sexual differentiation result in phylogenetically widespread transcriptional sex-bias in the
brain of organisms ranging from D. melanogaster to
humans [1]. We earlier uncovered an evolutionary conserved signature of sex-biased gene expression in the

These results suggested that sexual differences present
in adult human brain are in part genetically controlled
and not solely attributed to environmental differences
between the sexes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that
several genes on the Y-chromosome are expressed in
many regions of prenatal human male brain [3], raising
the possibility that expression of Y-linked genes may be
partially responsible for sexual dimorphism during early
development in the human brain. Moreover, sex-biased
expression is partly conserved between mouse and

human, suggesting that there is a common mechanism
of transcriptional modulation of sex-bias operating
across mammals.
The mechanisms by which sex differences in the brain
are established and controlled during development are
not understood in detail, but sex hormones clearly play
major roles. However, sex hormones are not sufficient
to explain all sex differences, and genes encoded in the
sex chromosomes are also known to be important [4].
These genes include male-specific Y-encoded genes as
well as female-biased X-encoded genes that escape the
dosage compensating inactivation of one X-chromosome
in females. In mouse, only a few genes that escape
X-inactivation have been identified [5-9]. These genes
are known to produce female-biased expression very
early during development [10], but the molecular
control mechanisms remain mostly unknown.
A genome-wide investigation of whole adult mouse
brain and several peripheral tissues demonstrated that
sexual dimorphism in gene expression is highly tissue
specific [11]. However, sex-biased expression in distinct
regions of the brain has not been previously investigated. Since the brain is a highly heterogeneous and
functionally compartmentalized structure, it is of interest to explore whether gene expression in distinct
regions of the brain is regulated differentially in males
and females. Indeed, three-dimensional magnetic resonance microscopy in mice demonstrated sex-specific,
post-puberty changes in brain structures [12]. Furthermore, sex-specific functional differences in various brain
regions, particularly the amygdala and hypothalamus,
have been observed in both human and rodent [13-15].
Given the implications of sex-biases for many neurological and psychiatric disorders [16], the importance of
studying sexually dimorphic gene expression in the
brain is increasingly being realized.

In the present study, we investigated male and female
gene expression in distinct structures of the mouse
brain using genome-wide microarray analysis. The study
unravelled sub-structure-specific sexual gene expression
dimorphism in the mouse brain. Our findings also
include novel observations regarding the regulation of
domains and genes escaping X-inactivation on the
mouse X-chromosome.

Results
Sexually dimorphic gene expression in distinct brain
regions

To investigate possible sub-structure-specific as well as
potentially uniform sex-biased gene expression in the
adult mouse brain, we assessed genome-wide RNA expression in striatum, neocortex, hippocampus and eye from
male and female mice using oligonucleotide microarrays.
Lung was included in the analysis to allow comparisons
with a peripheral tissue. We reasoned that sex-biased transcription present both in brain and in a peripheral tissue
would indicate wide-spread expression bias. This in turn
would suggest a sex-biased control mechanism for these
genes operating throughout the body and not specifically
in the brain. Two microarray platforms were used: Illumina 6v1.1 in case of striatum and neocortex and Affymetrix M430v2.0 in case of hippocampus, eye and lung. A
total number of 456 microarrays were included in the
study, comprising a balanced number of male and female
samples in each tissue (Table 1, Methods).
Genes with sexually dimorphic RNA expression were
identified in striatum (n = 173), neocortex (n = 19), hippocampus (n = 12), eye (n = 31) and lung (n = 160) using
FDR ≤ 0.05 as significance criteria (Table 1). The female
to male fold changes in expression were statistically significant but small (between 1.1 and 2-fold) in terms of
mean and median values for most genes (Figure 1,

Figure 1 Overview of significant probes in microarray analysis. An overview is shown of the probes presenting significant sex-biased signals
in five tissues. A: Tissues analysed using Illumina 6v1.1 platform (striatum and neocortex). B: Tissues analysed using Affymetrix M430v2.0 platform
(hippocampus, eye and lung). Columns designate samples (F: females, M: males) and rows designate probes. Yellow colour denotes upregulation and blue colour denotes down-regulation of a gene in a sample, as compared to the overall mean expression of the particular gene
within a tissue in the sex-balanced data sets.

Additional file 1). Only Xist (Inactive X-specific transcript, female up-regulated), Prl (Prolactin, female upregulated) and genes located on the Y-chromosome
(male up-regulated) showed female to male changes
greater than two-fold in any of the brain tissues analysed.
We also investigated the chromosomal localization of
sex-biased genes and observed a significant overrepresentation of X- and Y-encoded genes in all tissues investigated (Table 1). Indeed, sexually dimorphic gene
expression was almost exclusively restricted to genes
located on the sex chromosomes in neocortex and hippocampus. Interestingly, striatum contrasted with the
other brain regions in terms of the wide chromosomal
distribution of sex-biased genes as well as in terms of
quantity of biased genes, with an order of magnitude
increase in the number of sex-biased genes (Table 1,
Additional file 1). This result demonstrated that sexbiased gene expression is not uniform throughout the
whole brain, but rather differentially pronounced in

diverse brain structures. Since two similar but not identical microarray platforms were used in the study, direct
comparisons of number of sex-biased genes and the
estimated fold-changes of individual genes in each tissue
should take differences between the platforms into
account (See Discussion).
Gene ontology and disease association analysis
demonstrated that sex-biased genes in striatum are
mainly related to brain-specific functions (Additional
file 2). Therefore, the results suggest a possible molecular background behind well-known functional sexdifferences in striatum.
Common signatures of sex-biased gene expression in
different brain regions

We investigated whether we could identify genes that
are sex-biased in multiple tissues. The inventories of
sex-biased genes in each tissue resulted in five lists
(Additional file 1A-E). These lists were compared to

Reinius et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:614
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/614

identify genes that were sex-biased in more than one of
the tissues included in the study (Figure 2A). We found
that nearly all of the genes that were sex-biased in multiple tissues are located on the X- and Y-chromosomes.
Many of these sex chromosome encoded genes, listed as
“Known X, Y-linked” in Figure 2B, are already well
documented in the literature in terms of sex-biased
function and/or expression [9,17-22]. These genes
include Xist, which is essential for the onset of X-inactivation [23], 2010000I03Rik (also known as Jpx) which is
located in the X-pairing region [24,25] and several genes
previously known to escape X-inactivation, including
Kdm5c, Eif2s3x, Kdm6a (formerly termed Utx) and
Ddx3x. All X-linked genes named above were femalebiased. We also detected male-biased expression of their
Y-linked paralogous genes: Kdm5d, Eif2s3y, Uty and
Ddx3y. In addition to previously reported sex-biased
genes, we identified five novel X-linked genes with upregulation in female tissues: 2010308F09Rik,
D330035K16Rik, 5530601H04Rik, 2610029G23Rik, and
D930009K15Rik (“Novel X, Y-linked”, Figure 2B). On
the Y-chromosome, we identified two novel male-biased
genes: 4921530F17Rik, up-regulated in male neocortex
and striatum and C030026M15Rik, up-regulated in male
eye and lung tissues. Among the genes encoded in autosomal chromosomes, we did not identify any transcript
that was sex-biased in all brain structures (Figure 2B).
Two autosomal genes were however sex-biased in both
striatum and neocortex: Prl (Prolactin, chr13, female
up-regulated), a gene that promotes lactation,
and Arid1b (AT rich interactive domain 1B, chr17,
male up-regulated), a chromatin-remodelling factor.
1700012B15Rik (unknown function, chr12, female upregulated) was identified in both eye and lung.
Thus, we conclude that genes commonly sex-biased in
multiple brain structures are primarily attributed to the
sex chromosomes. Since most of the novel sex-biased
genes that were differentially expressed in several parts
of the brain are encoded in the X-chromosome, and
since X-gene dose effects may indeed produce changes
in brain function and behaviour [26], we restricted
further analysis to female-biased X-linked genes.
Novel female-biased X-encoded genes code for long noncoding RNAs

The function of the five newly identified X-linked femalebiased genes, 2010308F09Rik, D330035K16Rik,
5530601H04Rik, 2610029G23Rik and D930009K15Rik, is
not known. Cross-species BLAST indicated that only
2610029G23Rik is conserved between mouse and human
(human gene symbol: Cxorf26). The lack of human
homologs for the other four genes suggested that they
could be non-coding. To explore this possibility, we performed coding potential calculations based on sequence

composition [27]. This analysis classified 2010308F09Rik,
D330035K16Rik and D930009K15Rik as non-coding
(Table 2A). Furthermore, 5530601H04Rik and
D930009K15Rik were found as annotated non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs) in two ncRNA databases, namely RNAdb [28] and NONCODE [29] (Table 2B). The classification of the female-biased transcripts as non-coding was
further strengthened by the lack of any significant hit of
their sequences in the mouse Refseq protein database
(Table 2C). Thus, four out of five of the newly identified
female-biased X-linked transcripts are most likely long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class that is generally
defined as ncRNAs longer than 200 nucleotides [30,31].
Female up-regulated chromosomal domains that contain
a lncRNA and a protein-coding gene that escapes Xinactivation

All of the previously known female-biased genes on the
X-chromosome that were identified in multiple tissues
(“Known X, Y-linked”, Figure 2B) escape, or are involved
in the regulation of, X-inactivation [9,23-25]. Of particular interest was that when we investigated the chromosomal localizations of the novel female-biased lncRNAs,
we observed that all of these non-coding genes are positioned close to female-biased coding genes on the
X-chromosome (Figure 3A). Moreover, a closer examination revealed that three out of four female-biased
lncRNAs are proximally paired with female-biased coding genes that are known to escape X-inactivation (Figure 3B). Indeed, 2010308F09Rik is located 33 kbp
upstream of Ddx3x and these two genes are encoded in
a “head to head” orientation; D330035K16Rik is positioned within an intron of Eif2s3x and D930009K15Rik
is located 2.6 kbp downstream of Kdm5c. Furthermore,
the remaining female-biased non-coding gene, 5530
601H04Rik, is co-localized with the protein-coding and
female-biased gene 2610029G23Rik, and these genes are
situated in a “head to head” arrangement separated by
9.7 kbp (Figure 3B).
Quantitative RT-PCR experiments confirmed the
female-biased expression of the above mentioned pairs
of X-linked coding and non-coding genes in brain, eye
and lung tissues (p ≤ 0.05, two-sided unequal variance ttest) (Figure 4). One exception was 2010308F09Rik, not
confirmed as female-biased in lung, but evidently
female-biased in brain and eye. Female to male foldchanges were in the same range as detected in the
microarray experiments, and in the expected range for
X-inactivation escapee genes [32]. An X-linked negative
control for sex bias, Rps4x, which is inactivated on the
silent mouse X-chromosome [33,34] and therefore not
expected to show female-biased expression, remained
unchanged. A positive control for female-bias, Xist, was
highly female-biased (~10 000-fold) as expected.

The observation of female-biased domains in the

that the female-biased gene pairs in each domain might

be co-regulated. Given the well known X-inactivation
status of three out of four of the coding genes, we suspected that the three co-localized lncRNAs might also
escape X-inactivation. We could not find any data in the

literature concerning the possibility that the
fourth female-bias cluster, containing the coding
gene 2610029G23Rik and the non-coding gene
5530601H04Rik may also escape X-inactivation. Thus,
we decided to study this cluster of two female-biased
genes in more detail as described in the next section.
A novel domain that escapes X-inactivation in mouse

To investigate whether the chromosomal domain
containing genes 2610029G23Rik (coding) and
5530601H04Rik (non-coding) escapes X-inactivation, we
performed RNA FISH experiments in mouse cells, using
a probe aimed at nascent RNA from the genomic cluster
that contains the 5530601H04Rik and 2610029G23Rik
transcripts. In parallel, we included a probe for Xist
RNA. We counted signals in 88 randomly chosen cells

in which Xist signals were detected. As expected, strong
monoallelic Xist signals were distinguished (Figure 5AB), marking the silenced X-chromosome. In contrast,
signals from the novel female-biased cluster were biallelic in 80.7% of the cells, monoallelic in 7.9% of the cells
and 11.4% of the cells lacked signals (Figure 5C). To
verify that the detected nascent RNA signals were
derived from the locus containing 5530601H04Rik and
2610029G23Rik, we subsequently performed DNA FISH
with probes aimed to their genomic locus and a second
probe aimed to the Xist locus (located at 1.6 Mbp distance from the two Riken genes). Indeed, RNA-DNA
FISH experiments demonstrated that RNA and DNA
signals for the female-biased cluster were overlapping
(Figure 5A-B). Moreover, DNA signals for the femalebiased cluster and the Xist locus appeared close, as

Figure 5 A novel domain in the mouse X-chromosome that escapes X-inactivation. Results from sequential RNA-DNA FISH experiments on
the novel female-biased cluster containing 5530601H04Rik and 2610029G23Rik, and on Xist, in female mouse cells are shown. A: Confocal images,
showing monoallelic Xist RNA signals (red) and biallelic RNA signals from the novel female-biased cluster (green). In agreement with the
expected genomic distance between the Xist locus and the novel cluster (~1.6Mbp), DNA signals from Xist (yellow) appear close to the DNA
signals from the novel cluster (white). RNA and DNA signals for the novel cluster are proximal, indicating that the intended nascent RNA was
targeted. The nucleus is stained with DAPI (blue). B: Enlargements of the merged RNA + DNA image in panel A, showing that RNA and DNA
signals for the novel cluster are overlapping. C: Quantitative data showing allelic expression of the novel escapee cluster in nuclei positive for

expected given their short chromosomal distance.
Altogether, these results demonstrated that the newly
identified female-biased cluster contains genes that
escape X-inactivation in the majority of the cells.
Biallelic expression of this novel cluster strengthens
the association between female-biased lncRNAs and
domains that escape X-inactivation, and supports the
possibility that female-biased lncRNAs are biallelically
transcribed. Furthermore, this is supported by the lack
of repressive chromatin mark, namely H3K27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3), in the respective loci (Figure 6).
H3K27me3 is apparently depleted not only in proteincoding X-inactivation escapee genes, but also in the colocalized female-biased lncRNA genes. One of the
lncRNAs, 2010308F09Rik, was located in the border
region of H3K27me3 enrichment. This might explain
why female-bias of this transcript was not detected in
lung tissues, and why the female to male expression

ratio of the co-localized gene Ddx3x was consistently
lower than the ratios for the other X-inactivation escapees in the quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Figure 4). We
propose that female-biased lncRNAs transcribe from
domains that escape X-inactivation in mouse, suggesting
possible control functions of lncRNAs in such domains.

Discussion
Sex-biased gene expression differs regionally in the adult
mouse brain

We observed a large difference in number and chromosomal localization of sex-biased genes between striatum
and the other brain structures investigated, including
neocortex, hippocampus and eye. These results suggest
that sex differences are spatially regulated in distinct
regions of the brain. A caveat to our tissue comparisons
is that two similar but not identical array platforms
were used in the study. Therefore, “microarray platform”

cannot be excluded as a confounding factor when making direct comparisons of number of sex-biased genes
over the platforms. Nevertheless, striatum clearly differentiated from neocortex in the amount and chromosomal locations of sex-biased genes, and these two tissues
were analysed using the same platform. Our results thus
indicate that sex-biased gene expression is brain regionspecific rather that uniformly controlled in the whole
brain. Whether only striatum, or also other additional
regions are more sexually dimorphic than neocortex in
terms of gene expression in the brain remains to be
clarified. Indeed, the possibility that specific sex differences in brain gene expression may occur in a spatially
regulated manner has earlier been proposed based on
the high heterogeneity in structure and function of the
brain [11]. We propose that further analysis of regions
well-known to be functionally dimorphic in males and
females, such as the hypothalamus [35] and the amygdala [36], may show more pronounced sex-biased gene
expression.

The chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes in
striatum contrasted with the observations in neocortex
and hippocampus. In these tissues, sex-bias was essentially restricted to genes encoded in the X- and Ychromosomes. Striatum is perhaps best known for its
involvement in regulation of movement, reward and
emotions, and studies in rodents showed sex differences
in functions that are dependent on this brain structure
[37-39]. The results of our study provide molecular support for the notion that striatum may be essential in
controlling at least some aspects of sexually dimorphic
behaviours and functions.
A general conclusion from our study of discrete brain
regions is it that most female to male gene expression
differences are less than two-fold. These results are in
agreement with measurements obtained in whole mouse
brain [11] also showing expression differences less than
two-fold for most genes. Although small in magnitude,
these expression changes are statistically highly significant. A challenge for the future is to functionally analyse

Reinius et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:614
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/614

possible consequences of these sexual gene expression
biases in different regions of the brain, their establishment during brain development and their regulation by
hormones and hormone-independent factors.
Sex-biased expression of sex-linked genes throughout the
brain

Genes that were sex-biased in all brain regions included
in the study were encoded exclusively in the X- and
Y-chromosomes. This suggests that sex-biased transcription throughout the adult brain is restricted to sexlinked genes. The sex-specific functions of these genes
in the brain should be the subject of future analysis.
Among autosomal genes, only two genes, namely Prl
and Arid1b, were sex-biased in more than one brain
region. Prolactin has more than 300 separate functions
in vertebrates [40] and sex-biased functions are included
among them. Arid1b is a chromatin-remodelling factor
with widespread expression [41,42]. Increased expression
of this gene in male brain, and its possible implications
for sex-biased chromatin remodelling, remains to be
investigated.
Female-biased expression of lncRNAs in chromosomal
domains that escape X-inactivation

One of the most important outcomes of our study is the
identification of four female-biased lncRNA genes that
are localized on the mouse X-chromosome close to
female-biased protein-coding genes. These results define
four female up-regulated chromosomal domains each of
which contains a coding and a non-coding gene. A second important observation is that each of these X-chromosome domains contains genes that escape Xinactivation. Indeed, three out of four female-biased
coding genes (Ddx3x, Eif2s3x and Kdm5c) were shown
to escape X-inactivation by other investigators [9]. Our
RNA FISH experiments demonstrated that also the
fourth coding gene, 2610029G23Rik, as well as the noncoding 5530601H04Rik, are localized in a genomic
region that escapes X inactivation. In addition, while the
present article was under preparation, a second study
demonstrated independently that 2610029G23Rik
escapes X-inactivation in a hybrid Mus musculus × Mus
spretus cell line [43]. The non-random clustering of coding escapees and lncRNA genes on the X-chromosome
(FDR = 0.00, Methods), the female biased expression of
all of these genes, and the observed depletion of the
repressive chromatin mark H3K27me3 in coding as well
as in non-coding loci, supports the view that both coding and lncRNA genes escape X-inactivation. In conclusion, our study indicates the presence of four domains
in the mouse X-chromosome, containing a proteincoding gene and a lncRNA, each of which escapes X
inactivation.

Page 10 of 15

Previous studies of X-inactivation in humans showed
that escapee genes are grouped in large gene clusters on
the X-chromosome [21,44-46], suggesting that escape
mechanisms control continuous chromosomal domains.
In mice, on the other hand, previously described escapee
genes were interspersed and few, indicating that escape
mechanisms control smaller regions or even single
genes [9,21,46-48]. Our results suggest that clusters of
genes that escape X-inactivation also exist in mice,
although the size of these domains is apparently smaller
than in humans. Escape mechanisms may be regulating
both coding and non-coding genes collectively within
confined domains in the mouse X-chromosome. It is
possible that the female-biased lncRNAs escape Xinactivation as a side effect of being located closely to
functional protein-coding escapee genes. However, an
alternative possibility is that the lncRNAs themselves
serve a function in the escaping domains, and this possibility will be discussed in the following section.
Possible roles for long non-coding RNAs in domains that
escape X-inactivation

The mechanisms that control escape from silencing on
the inactive X-chromosome remain cryptic. Our observation of four chromosomal domains, each containing a
female-biased coding and a non-coding gene, raises the
possibility that lncRNA are themselves involved in the
regulation of X-chromosome domains that escape inactivation. Although the functions of most lncRNAs
remain enigmatic, there is increasing evidence suggesting roles in epigenetic regulation [30,31,49]. Recent
reports showed that expression of lncRNAs can remodel
local chromatin and promote transcriptional activation
of closely located genes [50]. For example, the expression of fbp1 in yeast was shown to be mediated by
expression of 5’ located lncRNA transcripts, and accompanied by progressive opening of proximal chromatin
[51]. Another example is the activation of yeast pho5,
where the transcription of an intergenic, 3’ located, antisense lncRNA contributed positively to chromatin plasticity and nucleosome disassembly [52]. Expression of
lncRNAs in domains that escape X-inactivation might
regulate the expression of neighbouring protein-coding
genes by similar mechanisms, involving relaxation of
nucleosome complexes, increased accessibility for transcriptional machineries and recruitment of transcription
factors that activate transcription in the domain.
Other mechanisms of lncRNA control in X-inactivation escaping domains are possible. For example,
lncRNAs may mediate movement of escapee domains to
transcriptionally active compartments in the nucleus.
Similar lncRNA-dependent movements were previously
described, although towards transcriptionally silent compartments [53,54]. Another described role for lncRNAs

Reinius et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:614
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/614

involved the establishment of chromosomal boundaries
between transcriptionally active and inactive domains
[55,56]. By analogy, it is possible that transcription of
lncRNA in escaping domains mediates the formation of
chromatin boundaries to restrict the spread of heterochromatin from neighbouring silent regions in the
X-chromosome, thereby ensuring escape of the colocalized protein-coding genes.
The proposed hypotheses could be tested in the future
by mutation or silencing of the lncRNAs identified in
our study.
X-linked lncRNAs are known to be involved in multiple steps of control of the binary transcriptional state of
the X-chromosomes in mammalian females, including
initiation, establishment and maintenance of X-chromosome silencing [57,58]. The current report raised the
possibility that lncRNAs might act as gene expression
modifiers in domains that escape X-inactivation. Unlike
proteins and small RNAs, lncRNAs can remain tethered
to the site of transcription, and therefore uniquely direct
allelic regulation [57]. This property could favour the
choice of lncRNAs as regulators of sexually antagonistic
genes on the X-chromosome during evolution. Selection
for cis-acting modifiers of expression of sexually antagonistic genes on the X-chromosome is certainly predicted
[59]. lncRNAs as local expression modifiers in domains
that escape X-inactivation may very well prove to be a
novel example of such cis-acting elements in the
X-chromosome.
Sex chromosomes have evolved from autosomes independently many times in animals [60]. However, the
main dilemma of dosage compensation and regulation
of sexually antagonistic genes has been alike for each
sex chromosome system [61]. It is possible that
lncRNAs may have evolved as a solution for allelespecific regulation of confined domains in several types
of sex chromosomes. The fast sequence evolution of
non-coding RNAs [62] could make these molecules suitable for regulation of sexually antagonistic genes. To
evaluate this possibility, the roles of lncRNAs in allelespecific regulation of genes encoded in the sex chromosomes should be studied not only in mouse but also in
species with other sex chromosome systems.

Conclusions
Our data indicate that the degree of sex-biased gene
expression varies between distinct brain structures in
adult mouse brain. In particular, striatum showed wider
transcriptional sex-bias than neocortex both in terms of
number of sex-biased genes and chromosomal distribution of these genes. More interestingly, we identified
female-biased lncRNA genes clustered on the Xchromosome with protein-coding genes that escape
X-inactivation. These clusters are free of repressive

Page 11 of 15

histone marks, supporting the view that female-biased
lncRNAs are biallelically expressed in domains that
escape X-inactivation. Based on our observations, we
propose that these lncRNAs might modulate the epigenetic state of nearby coding genes.

Methods
Identification of sex-biased genes

Microarray data: Microarray collections from discrete
tissues were contributed by GeneNetwork (GN) (University of Tennessee). Details of the processing of tissues
and the array data are described earlier [63-66], and
summarised on the GN homepage http://www.genenetwork.org. In brief, Illumina Mouse-6v1.1 arrays (striatum and neocortex) were normalized with rank
invariant normalization and Affymetrix M430v2 arrays
(hippocampus and eye) were normalized with robust
multichip average (RMA). Signals were log transformed
and standardized to a mean of 8 and a standard deviation of 2. RMA normalization was also applied to the
lung data (Affymetrix M430v2). Array data can be
accessed via GN http://www.genenetwork.org. GN Striatum data set: “HQF BXD Striatum Illumina Mouse-6.1
November 2007 Rank Invariant Data Set”, GN Accession: GN152. GN Neocortex data set: “HQF BXD Neocortex ILM6v1.1 (Feb08) RankInv”, GN Accession:
GN157. GN Hippocampus data set: “Hippocampus Consortium M430v2 (June06) RMA”, GN Accession:
GN110. GN Eye data set: “Hamilton Eye Institute
Mouse Eye M430v2 Data Set (Sept08) RMA”, GN
Accession: GN207. GN Lung data set: “HZI Lung
M430v2 (Apr08) RMA”, GN Accesion: GN160. The analysis was restricted to include only C57BL/6 × DBA/2
mice. Prior to any further analysis, the data collection
was screened for arrays in which sex had been potentially reversed in the databases, since such misclassifications would distort and reduce power of the sex-specific
analysis. This was done by graphing the log 2 intensity
values of two Xist probes in each array and tissue in
scatter plots. Male and female arrays in which Xist
expression fell in the expected quadrant of the opposite
sex were excluded from the analysis (Additional file 3).
The data sets were subsequently balanced to include an
equal number of arrays from each sex. Identification of
sex-biased genes: Sex-biased genes were identified in
each tissue using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test followed by Benjamini-Hochberg correction of the p-values
(TIGR MeV v.4.3 package [67]). The nonparametric
Wilcoxon test avoids possible violations of assumptions
of normal distribution of signals in each particular
probe-set, while the Benjamini-Hochberg correction hinders inflation of false positives in the resulting gene lists,
which may otherwise be a caveat in microarray
approaches. The criterion for differential expression was

Reinius et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:614
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/614

a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value lower or equal
to 0.05. Both raw and adjusted p-values for each significant probe are listed in Additional file 1. Heatmaps
were generated in TIGR MeV v.4.3 [67]. Gene ontology
and disease association analysis, presented in Additional
file 2, was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
Software v8.6 (Ingenuity Systems). FDR of the observed
co-localization of female-biased genes on the X-chromosome was calculated by considering Xist, Jpx and the
coding escapee genes (coding genes in Figure 3) as fixed
and repeatedly drawing four random X-linked probes
from the arrays (since four lncRNAs were identified).
FDR was calculated as the number of times four drawn
probes were located at a maximum of 50kb distance
up-/down-stream of the fixed genes divided by the number of permutations (104).
Quantitative RT-PCR

Mouse tissues: Tissues were collected from female and
male C57BL/6 × DBA/2 mice, and these samples were
independent from the individuals used in generating the
microarray data. Animals had been housed at Uppsala
Biomedical Center, Sweden, in agreement with animal
research ethical regulations (Swedish ethical committee
permit: c79/9). Dissected brain (rostral part, including
striatum, neocortex and parts of hippocampus, excluding olfactory bulbs), eye and lung tissues were snap-frozen on dry ice and subsequently kept at -80°C. RNA
and cDNA: RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To inspect
RNA quality, 28 S and 18 S ribosomal bands were
examined by gel electrophoresis, and optical 260/280,
260/230 ratios were measured (ND-1000, NanoDrop
Technologies) ranging 2.0-2.2. RNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA using a Dynamo cDNA synthesis kit
F-470L (Finnzymes) and the following reagents: 0.95 μg
total RNA, 15 ng/μl random hexamers, 10 U/μl MMuLV RNase H- reverse transcriptase, 1 × RT buffer,
nuclease-free water, in a total reaction volume of 20 μl.
Incubations were performed in a PTC-100 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research): 25°C; 10 min, 37°C; 45 min,
85°C; 5 min. cDNA samples were subsequently diluted
1:10 in double distilled water and kept at -20°C until
usage. Primers: Transcript-specific primers (Additional
file 4) were designed on opposite sides of exon/exon
junctions using Primer3 [68]. Since D330035K16Rik and
D930009K15Rik lack exon/intron structures, intra-exonic primers were used for these transcripts. Multiple
primer pairs were tested for each transcript, and primers
with the highest PCR efficiencies were selected for the
experiments. qPCR: Quantitative PCRs were performed
in a ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). Reactions contained 0.3 μM of
each primer, 1 × Power SYBR Geen Master Mix

Page 12 of 15

(Applied Biosystems), 4 μl cDNA sample and distilled
water in a total reaction volume of 30 μl. Thermal cycles
were: 50°C; 2 min, 95°C; 10 min, 40 cycles: 95°C; 15 s,
60°C; 1 min. To ensure that single PCR products of
intended lengths were amplified, a melting program was
executed subsequent to the quantifications and PCR
products were separated by gel electrophoresis. To control for potential signals from amplification of genomic
DNA (gDNA) during quantification, minus RT controls
were employed (reverse transcription without M-MuLV
RNase H- reverse transcriptase). gDNA signals were
consistently undetectable or negligible. Data analysis:
Background-subtracted expression values (copy numbers) were determined relative to a standard curve
(cDNA dilution series) in 7000 SDS v.1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems). Expression values in each sample were normalized to the geometric mean of the endogenous
expression of Actb and Gapdh. The criterion for differential expression was p ≤ 0.05, two-tailed unequal variance t-test (R v2.6.2 Environment for Statistical
Computing http://www.r-project.org, t.test(), Arguments:
alternative = “two.sided”, var.equal = FALSE).
Sequential RNA - DNA FISH

Cells: Adult mouse fibroblast cultures were prepared as
previously described [69] with minor modifications.
Briefly, female mice were decapitated and the tails were
cut and washed in PBS. After removing superficial dermis, remaining tails were cut into 2-3 mm pieces and
placed into gelatin-coated 6 well plates (Costar) containing 1 ml medium in each well. Culture medium was
composed of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 10% fetal bovine
serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Tails
were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 5 days, during
which fibroblasts migrated out of the explants. Tissue
pieces were then removed and cells were cultured in
fresh medium until they reached confluence. RNA DNA FISH: Mouse fibroblasts were passaged and grown
on Culturewell™ MultiWell cell culture system (Molecular Probes) for 36 hours, and then fixed by 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by
permeabilization in 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS with 10
mM Ribonucleoside Vanadyl Complex (New England
Biolabs) for 5 min. Fixed cells were stored in 70% Ethanol at -20°C until usage. Sonicated BAC DNA
(5530601H04Rik and 2610029G23Rik: RP23-149J5, Xist:
RP23-84A16) was labelled with Green-dUTP or OrangedUTP (Abbott Molecular) using the BioPrime Array
CGH Genomic Labeling system (Invitrogen). Hybridization with labeled DNA (10 ng/μl) and mouse Cot1 DNA
(100 ng/μl) (Invitrogen) was performed overnight at
37°C in 2 × SSC, 50% formamide and 12% dextran sulfate, with 10 mM Ribonucleoside Vanadyl Complex.

Reinius et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:614

Cells were washed with 2 × SSC and 50% formamide
(15 min; 40°C) and 2 × SSC (15 min; 40°C). DNA was
counterstained and cells were mounted in Vectashield
(Vector Labs). Cell imaging and generation of optical
sections in 3D were carried out on Leica DMI 3000B.
After image acquisition, the slide with cells were washed
two times by 4 × SSC with 0.05% Tween20 (10 min; 40°
C), followed by treatment with 10 ng/μl RNase A (QIAGEN) at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were then denatured in 2 ×
SSC and 50% formamide at 80°C for 40 min. DNA FISH
hybridizations were carried out with labelled DNA (10
ng/μl) and mouse Cot1 DNA (100 ng/μl) (Invitrogen) in
2 × SSC, 50% formamide and 12% dextran sulfate overnight at 37°C, followed by the same washing and
mounting steps as described for RNA FISH. DNA FISH
images, of cells with recorded RNA FISH signals, were
acquired in the same way. The images presented in Figure 5 were uniformly processed and merged in Adobe
Photoshop CS3 (Adobe).
H3K27me3 ChIP-chip data

H3K27me3 data from female and male adult mouse
liver [43] was downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO accession: GSE20617, data sets:
GSM517918_female_liver_H3K27me3_peaks, GSM517
917_male_liver_H3K27me3_peaks). LiftOver (UCSC
Genome Browser) and SignalMap v1.9.0.03 (NimbleGen)
was used to visualize H3K27me3 enrichment shown in
Figure 6.
