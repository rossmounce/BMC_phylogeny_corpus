Abstract
Background: The function of voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels greatly depends on coupling
to cytoplasmic accessory β subunits, which not only promote surface expression, but also modulate
gating and kinetic properties of the α1 subunit. Schistosomes, parasitic platyhelminths that cause
schistosomiasis, express two β subunit subtypes: a structurally conventional β subunit and a variant
β subunit with unusual functional properties. We have previously characterized the functional
properties of the variant Cavβ subunit. Here, we focus on the modulatory phenotype of the
conventional Cavβ subunit (SmCavβ) using the human Cav2.3 channel as the substrate for SmCavβ
and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.
Results: The conventional Schistosoma mansoni Cavβ subunit markedly increases Cav2.3 currents,
slows macroscopic inactivation and shifts steady state inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction.
However, currents produced by Cav2.3 in the presence of SmCavβ run-down to approximately
75% of their initial amplitudes within two minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration. This
suppressive effect was independent of Ca2+, but dependent on intracellular Mg2+-ATP. Additional
experiments revealed that SmCavβ lends the Cav2.3/SmCavβ complex sensitivity to Na+ ions. A
mutant version of the Cavβ subunit lacking the first forty-six amino acids, including a string of
twenty-two acidic residues, no longer conferred sensitivity to intracellular Mg2+-ATP and Na+ ions,
while continuing to show wild type modulation of current amplitude and inactivation of Cav2.3.
Conclusion: The data presented in this article provide insights into novel mechanisms employed
by platyhelminth Cavβ subunits to modulate voltage-gated Ca2+ currents that indicate interactions
between the Ca2+ channel complex and chelated forms of ATP as well as Na+ ions. These results
have potentially important implications for understanding previously unknown mechanisms by
which platyhelminths and perhaps other organisms modulate Ca2+ currents in excitable cells.

Background
Voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels couple membrane
depolarisation to the entry of Ca2+ that, in turn, is funda-

mental in a variety of cellular events such as contraction
[1,2], changes in gene expression [3] and neurotransmitter release [4,5]. Cav channels belong to the super-family

of voltage-gated ion channels that also include sodium
channels and potassium channels [6], and can be broadly
classified into high-voltage activated (HVA) and low-voltage activated (LVA) classes. HVA Cav channels are heteromeric protein complexes composed of a pore-forming α1
subunit and auxiliary β and α2δ subunits [7]. In addition
to promoting surface expression of the Cavα1 subunit,
Cavβ subunits modulate the kinetics of activation and
inactivation, gating [8-10] and the rate of recovery from
inactivation [11,12].
Schistosomes are parasitic trematode flatworms that cause
schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting approximately
200 million people worldwide. With the ultimate goal of
understanding the molecular basis for neuromuscular
transmission in these parasitic flatworms, we have previously cloned three transcripts from Schistosoma mansoni
that code for one L-type-like and two non L-type high
voltage-activated Cav channel α1 subunits [13]. Heterologous expression of these α1 subunits in Xenopus oocytes
and mammalian cell lines has proved problematic, perhaps because of the relatively high A-T content of these
coding regions, or the lack of a specific chaperone in these
systems. Additionally, we have identified two Cav channel
β subunits from schistosomes and other platyhelminths:
a conventional β subunit (SmCavβ), and a variant β subunit (SmCavβvar), which appears to be unique to platyhelminths and has unusual structural and functional
features [14,15].
When heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the
conventional schistosome Cavβ subunit significantly
increases Cav2.3 current amplitude, and shifts the steady
state inactivation curve to more hyperpolarized potentials
[16] (in these experiments, we use the robustly expressing
human Cav2.3 α1 subunit as a "reporter" to assess β subunit function). The actions of this β subunit are consistent
with those of mammalian Cavβ subunits [10]. Here, we
have reproduced and extended our previous data on modulation of Cav2.3 currents by the schistosome SmCavβ
subunit (SmCavβ) in a mammalian cell system, which
may better approximate the cellular milieu in which these
channels are found in situ. Xenopus oocytes are widely used
in expression of ion channels and other proteins, in part
because they are primed for high levels of protein translation. However, most other cells are not that strongly
geared towards this role. Oocytes are much larger than
adult, differentiated cells and contain high amounts of
yolk granules. In addition, the mammalian cell line HEK
does not express the endogenous Cavβ subunit that complicates analysis of heterologously expressed Cav channels
in Xenopus oocytes [17]. Finally, adult S. mansoni live in a
mammalian host environment.
Interestingly, during these studies, we observed a rapid
run-down of the currents produced by Cav2.3 channels

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/6

co-expressed with this schistosome Cavβ subunit.
Decrease of Ca2+ channel activity under whole-cell patchclamp, a configuration of the patch-clamp technique that
disrupts the contact between membrane and cytoplasm, is
a well-known phenomenon [18-21]. However, very few
studies have dealt with the structural and biochemical
causes for run-down, and those studies focus primarily on
L-type Ca2+ channels. Notably, Kameyama and collaborators were able to relate run-down of L-type Ca2+ channels
to the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin [22]. Here we
investigate the mechanism of this β subunit-dependent
rundown, examining the role of several forms of ATP and
cations in run-down of the Cav2.3/SmCavβ complex.
Additionally, we use a truncated β subunit protein to provide clues regarding the molecular substrate within the
SmCavβ subunit that mediates run-down of Cav2.3/
SmCavβ currents.

Results

SmCavβ modulates activation and inactivation of Cav2.3 in
a conventional manner
To assess the modulatory phenotype of Cavβ subunits, a
HEK-293 cell line stably expressing the human Cav2.3d
subunit (GB Acc. # L27745) was used. Using Ca2+ as the
charge carrier, currents produced by Cav2.3 alone peaked
at +30 mV with an average amplitude of -261 ± 20 pA (n
= 15). Co-expression of SmCavβ increased peak amplitudes to -1640 ± 276 pA (n = 5) and shifted the I–V peak
leftwards, to +20 mV (Figure 1A,B).

Using Ca2+ as the charge carrier, the decaying phase of
Cav2.3 currents produced by Cav2.3 channels alone or
with SmCavβ subunits was well fitted by a double exponential function with fast (τfast) and slow (τslow) time constants of inactivation (Table 1). The double exponential fit
to the decay of currents produced by Cav2.3 in response to
a pulse to +30 mV had a fast time constant of 16 ms that
contributed 66% to total current decay, and a slow time
constant of 69 ms that represented 34% of total current
decay. The double exponential fit to the decay of currents
produced by Cav2.3 co-expressed with SmCavβ in
response to a depolarizing pulse to +20 mV had a fast time
constant of 31 ms, which contributed 55% to total current
decay, and a slow time constant of 116 ms that contributed 45% to total inactivation. Fundamentally, SmCavβ
slowed macroscopic inactivation of Cav2.3 currents by
increasing the time constants of both the fast and slow
components while simultaneously decreasing the contribution of the fast component and increasing the contribution of the slow component to total inactivation (Figure
1C and Table 1). Co-expression of SmCavβ markedly
shifted the midpoint of steady-state inactivation in the
hyperpolarizing direction (Figure 1D). Midpoints of single order Boltzmann fits to steady-state inactivation curves
of Cav2.3 and Cav2.3 + SmCavβ currents were, respectively, -8 mV and -49 mV (P < 0.05, Student t-test). The

slope factors of these Boltzmann fits to steady-state inactivation were not significantly different: 12 mV/e-fold for
Cav2.3 and 10 mV/e-fold for Cav2.3 + SmCavβ (Table 1).
SmCavβ significantly slowed the rate of recovery from
inactivation. The fractional recoveries of current as a function of time at -80, -100 and -120 mV were well fitted by
a single exponential function with recovery time constants
from inactivation (τrec). For example, τrec for Cav2.3 and
Cav2.3 + SmCavβ from -100 mV were, respectively, 71 and
168 ms (p < 0.05, Student t-test) (Figure 1E; see Table 1
for recovery time constants for the three potentials).
The mammalian (rat) β2a subunit (GB Acc. # M80545)
increased current amplitude to a similar extent as the
schistosome Cavβ subunit, shifted the steady-state inactivation curve in the hyperpolarizing direction, although to
a lesser degree than the schistosome Cavβ subunit, slowed
macroscopic inactivation, and shifted the I–V peak in the
hyperpolarizing direction (Figure 1).
Cav2.3 currents run-down in the presence of SmCavβ in a
manner independent of Ca2+ but dependent on chelated
forms of ATP and free Na+
Currents produced by Cav2.3 progressively decrease in
amplitude to approximately 75% of their initial values
within ~2.5 minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration, but only when SmCavβ is co-expressed (Figure
2A). Over the same time frame, no run-down was
observed for currents produced by Cav2.3 expressed
alone, nor in the presence of the mammalian Cavβ2a subunit nor with the structurally atypical schistosome
SmCavβvar subunit (Figure 2B). Substitution of CaCl2 by
an equimolar concentration of BaCl2 did not prevent rundown, indicating that this phenomenon is Ca2+ independent (Figure 2A).

We hypothesized that this rapid run-down could be
caused by physical dissociation between SmCavβ and
Cav2.3. However, as the kinetics of inactivation and the
steady state inactivation properties were identical before
and after run-down (Figure 2C,D), it seems likely that the
association between Cav2.3 and SmCavβ remained intact
in these conditions.
Since Mg2+ is known to block Ca2+ channels from the
intracellular side, we replaced Mg2+-ATP with an equimolar concentration (5 mM) of Na+2-ATP, yet under these
conditions we still observed significant run-down that,
again, was dependent upon co-expression of the schistosome Cavβ subunit (Figure 3A). No run-down was
observed in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments using a
"minimal" internal solution without ATP (Figure 3C).
Further experiments indicate that non-chelated forms of
ATP (Tris2-ATP) do not mediate SmCavβ-dependent
Cav2.3 run-down (Figure 3B). Currents produced by
Cav2.3/Cavβ2a did not run-down in the presence of 5 mM
intracellular NaCl, Na2-ATP, Tris2·ATP or in minimal
intracellular solution (Figures 3D1 and 3D2).
Next we explored the possibility that this particular form
of run-down was caused by the cations associated with the
ATP molecule (Mg2+ and Na+). Free Mg2+ reduced currents
produced by Cav2.3 alone by about 75%, and by about
90% when SmCavβ was co-expressed (Figure 4); therefore,
since it would be very challenging to distinguish Ca2+ current decrease due to run-down from Ca2+ current decrease
due to blockade by internal Mg2+, we did not pursue rundown studies in the presence of free Mg2+. However, in
contrast with Mg2+, free Na+ did not suppress the activity
of Cav2.3 channels expressed alone or co-expressed with
the schistosome SmCavβ or with the mammalian Cavβ2a
subunit (Figure 5A–D). However, substituting Mg2+-ATP
with NaCl resulted in significant run-down (Figure 5E),
indicating Na+-dependent modulation of channels containing SmCavβ.
The structural basis for run-down mediated by SmCavβ
resides in its acidic N-terminal domain
The N-terminus of the SmCavβ subunit contains an atypical domain that is rich in glutamic acid and aspartic acid
residues (Figure 6A). Since BLAST screens for similar
domains in other proteins did not yield any hits, we set to
investigate whether this N-terminal domain represents
the structural base for the atypical modulation of the
SmCavβ subunit. Furthermore, there is precedence for
important modulatory effects on Cav channels localizing
to the N-terminal regions of β subunits [23-26]. To this
end, we created a truncated version of SmCavβ that lacks
the first forty-six amino acids containing this acid-rich
domain (Figure 6A), and tested whether it still caused
Cav2.3 currents to run-down. The N-terminally truncated

SmCavβ subunit enhanced Cav2.3 currents, slowed their
macroscopic inactivation and shifted their steady-state
inactivation to the same extent as the wild type SmCavβ
subunit (Figure 6B,C). However, unlike the wild-type version of SmCavβ, the N-terminally truncated SmCavβ subunit did not induce run-down of Ca2+ currents within 2–3
minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration with
an internal solution containing either 5 mM Mg2+-ATP
(Figure 6D,F), or 5 mM NaCl (Figure 6E,F).

Discussion
In this study we set out to characterize the modulatory
phenotype of a Cavβ subunit from the parasitic trematode
S. mansoni. This β subunit is phylogenetically close to
other Cavβ subunits [14]. The mammalian HEK-293 cell
line was used as the expression system and the mamma-

lian Cav2.3 channel splice variant "d" as our "test" α1 subunit. This splice variant is susceptible to modulation by
Cavβ subunits [27] and is the longest of all known versions of the Cav2.3 subunit [28]. Our data show that
SmCavβ exhibits similar modulatory phenotypes in HEK
cells and Xenopus oocytes. Additionally, SmCavβ slows
recovery from inactivation of Cav2.3 currents using Ba2+ as
the charge carrier, i.e. in the absence of intracellular Ca2+
accumulation. Using strontium as the charge carrier,
mammalian and jellyfish Cavβ subunits also slow recovery from inactivation of this same channel in conditions
in which Ca2+ does not accumulate in the intracellular

compartment [11]. However, it is important to note that
recovery from inactivation appears to depend heavily on
the identity of the Cavα1 subunit being assayed: all jellyfish and mammalian Cavβ subunits delayed recovery from
inactivation of Cav2.3 channels, but accelerated the recovery of the jellyfish L-type Cav channel [11].
SmCavβ-dependent run-down of Cav2.3 currents
While characterizing the modulatory phenotype of
SmCavβ, we consistently observed a rapid run-down of
Cav2.3 currents only in the presence of SmCavβ. This contrasts with previous studies, in which run-down appears
to occur in the α1 subunit, independently of accessory
subunits [29-31]. Down-regulation of Ca2+ currents
caused by interaction of Cavβ subunits with intracellular
proteins is well documented. For example, interaction of
Cavβ subunits with small GTPases of the RGK family [32],
with large GTPases of the dynamin family [33], or with
the nuclear protein HP1 [34] results in down-regulation
of Ca2+ currents. Our data represent the first case, to our
knowledge, of down-regulation of Ca2+ currents by interactions between Cavβ subunits and chelated forms of ATP
or Na+ ions, which are likely relevant to platyhelminth
physiology. Unlike previous studies, in which hydrolysable forms of ATP suppress Ca2+ current run-down [35,36],
here we show that two physiologically relevant, hydrolysable forms of ATP induce SmCavβ-mediated decrease in
Cav2.3 activity. The possibility that run-down was caused
by Mg2+ ions that dissociate from the ATP molecule was
considered, but the fact that free Mg2+ dramatically suppressed Cav2.3 currents posed a significant challenge to
explore this possibility. These results are reminiscent of
the effects of Mg2+ ions at a similar concentration on Ltype Cav channels, which occurs by their binding to a lowaffinity site at the pore of the α 1 subunit [37]. Since ATP
associates with Na+ ions under physiological conditions
[38], we also measured run-down of Cav2.3/SmCavβ
channels in the presence of intracellular Na+2-ATP.
Because we detected significant run-down under these
conditions, and knowing that the binding constant
between Na+ ions and ATP is relatively low, about 13 M-1
(in contrast to 9000 M-1 for Mg2+, [39]), we hypothesized
that Na+ ions that had dissociated from ATP were causing
this run-down. Experiments using NaCl instead of Na+2ATP confirmed this hypothesis.

Our study is not the first to show Cavβ-dependent rundown of non-L type Ca2+ current. The mammalian Cavβ
subunit appears to enhance run-down of the non-L-type,
Cav2.1 α1 subunit [40]. However, it is important to note
that in that study, run-down occurred under the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration on Xenopus oocytes,
where the connection between cytoplasm and plasma
membrane remains largely intact. Therefore the mechanism(s) of run-down employed by the mammalian Cavβ

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/8/6

subunit is likely to be distinct from that used by the schistosome Cavβ subunit.
Molecular substrate for SmCavβ-dependent Mg2+-ATP and
Na+ sensitivity
Since the conventional SmCavβ subunit contains a string
of acidic residues in the N-terminal domain that is not
found in its mammalian counterparts, we generated a version of this subunit that lacked this region, to test whether
this unique domain is the molecular substrate for this particular form of run-down. Deletion of this acidic, N-terminal fragment did not change the modulatory phenotype
of SmCavβ on current amplitude, inactivation kinetics or
steady-state inactivation. However, in contrast to our
results with wild type SmCavβ, Cav2.3 currents did not run
down when co-expressed with this mutated subunit, using
Ca2+ as the charge carrier and in the presence of intracellular free Na+ or Mg2+-ATP. It seems likely that sensitivity to
intracellular Mg2+-ATP and free Na+ resides in all or part of
the string of acidic residues of the SmCavβ subunit.
Physiological relevance
Several reports have shown that the Ca2+ currents of platyhelminth muscle and nerve cells are very labile, running
down within minutes or even seconds after establishing
the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. In previous
work, the intracellular solution used to record voltagegated Ca2+ currents from muscle cells of S. mansoni was
titrated with NaOH to bring the pH to a physiological
value [41]. We have empirically calculated that this action
would bring the concentration of Na+ to approximately 19
mM, which is sufficient to reduce Ca2+ currents modulated
by SmCavβ significantly, according to our data. Similarly,
Ca2+ currents recorded from isolated muscle cells of the
free-living flatworm Bdelloura candida run-down within 20
seconds of establishing the whole-cell configuration [42]:
It is tempting to speculate that this run-down was caused
by the relatively high concentration of NaCl (30 mM)
added to the intracellular solution in these experiments.

Our previous studies have identified a different schistosome Cavβ subunit (SmCavβvar; [14]), which does not
exhibit the hallmark action of Cavβ subunits, namely, to
increase Ca2+ current density. Together with the data presented here, this raises the question of whether schistosomes employ unique strategies to modulate excitability
via atypical modulation of HVA Cav channels, information that could be useful in the design of targeted therapies to treat schistosomiasis.

Conclusion

We have identified novel functions for a schistosome Cavβ
subunit, namely to confer Ca2+ currents with sensitivity to
intracellular Mg2+-ATP and Na+ ions, which translates into
a reduced ability on the part of this Cavβ subunit to

basis for this atypical sensitivity to both Mg2+-ATP and
Na+ ions resides in a domain or domains located within
the first forty-six amino acids of SmCavβ, which contains
a string of twenty-two aspartic and glutamic acid residues
not present in other Cavβ subunits.

Using standard methods, we cloned all Cavβ subunits into
the pXOOM vector [43], which is optimized for expression of inserts in mammalian cells (under control of a

green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for transfection. For SmCavβ, the insert from the original SmCavβ

Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB). Primers
were designed against the beginning and end of the coding regions of the sequence, and included appropriate

were: Forward: 5'-GGAAGCTTATGGCTGGTGATCGAGGATATTCA-3', which includes two G residues and a Hind

was purified over a QiaQuick spin column (Qiagen), and
digested with Hind III and Not I. The digested band was

the absence of PCR errors.
Cell culture and transfection of HEK293-Cav2.3 cells
HEK293 cells stably transfected with Cav2.3d [44] were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with L-glutamine, glucose and 10% foetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere (95%) at 5% CO2 and 37°C. Cells were used for up
to 20 passages and were split every 2–4 days. For electrophysiological recordings, cells were seeded in Petri dishes
coated with poly-l-lysine, and transfection of auxiliary β
subunits was performed with Tfx on cells at a confluence
of 50–60%, using 1 μg of the construct and a DNA: Tfx
ratio of 1:2. Cells exhibiting green fluorescence were used
for further study.
Construction of a N-terminal deletion mutant of the
SmCavβ subunit
To generate a mutant subunit lacking amino acids 2–46 of
the N terminus domain, a diluted sample of the SmCavβ
clone was used as template for amplification of the truncated insert by PCR. The forward primer (5'-GGGGATCCATGGAAAATGCTCGTCAGGGAACGG-3') was designed
to bind to the SmCavβ clone, starting from nucleotide
142. This forward primer contains a start codon, a Kozak

7.4. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and
fire polished before each experiment. To ensure a fast dialysis of the intracellular compartment, only pipettes with
resistances between 0.8 and 1.2 MΩ were used. Membrane seals were obtained by applying negative pressure.
All experiments were performed at room temperature
(22°C). The voltage-dependence of steady state inactivation was determined by measuring the peak current
evoked with a depolarising pulse to elicit the maximum
current as a function of the voltage of a preceding 1.5 s
pre-pulse test (between -110 and +20 mV). Steady-state
inactivation curves were fitted by a sigmoid (Boltzmann)
distribution of the form:
F (V) = Imax/{1 + exp [V0.5 - V)/K]}
Where Imax is the maximal current, V is the pre-pulse voltage, K is the slope factor and V0.5 is the voltage at which
inactivation is half-maximal.

To study inactivation as a function of time, the decaying
phases of the inward currents evoked by a test pulse to +20
or +30 mV were fitted to a double exponential equation of
the form: I (t) = I0 + I1 exp (-t/τ1) + I2 exp (-t/τ2), where τ1
and τ2 represent the fast and the slow time constants of
inactivation, respectively, I1 and I2 represent the relative
contribution of each component to inactivation and I0 is
the offset. To assess the rate of recovery from inactivation
from the closed state, a two-pulse protocol was used. Two
test pulses to +20 or +30 mV were separated by a recovery
step to -80, -100 or -120 mV for varying amounts of time
(from 10 ms to 1 second). The length and voltage of the
first test pulse was adjusted accordingly for each particular
channel combination. For example, currents produced by
Cav2.3 channels alone were maximal at approximately
+30 mV and inactivated completely within 100 ms,
whereas currents produced by Cav2.3/SmCavβ were maximal at approximately +20 mV and required several seconds to inactivate fully. In the latter case, recovery from
inactivation was measured using Ba2+ instead of Ca2+ as
the charge carrier (Ba2+ currents inactivate faster than Ca2+
currents produced by Cav2.3 [45]), thereby decreasing the
need to use an excessively long depolarising first pulse
protocol, which could compromise cell viability. The currents evoked by the second pulse of this double-pulse protocol were normalized to the currents produced by the
first pulse and plotted against the duration of the interpulse interval.
