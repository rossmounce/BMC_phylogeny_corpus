Abstract
Background: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is an intracellular bacterial pathogen which can colonize a
variety of hosts, including human, causing syndromes that vary from gastroenteritis and diarrhea to systemic
disease.
Results: In this work we present structural information as well as insights into the in vivo function of YqiC, a 99residue protein of S. Typhimurium, which belongs to the cluster of the orthologous group 2960 (COG2960). We
found that YqiC shares biophysical and biochemical properties with Brucella abortus BMFP, the only previously
characterized member of this group, such as a high alpha helix content, a coiled-coil domain involved in
trimerization and a membrane fusogenic activity in vitro. In addition, we demonstrated that YqiC localizes at
cytoplasmic and membrane subcellular fractions, that a S. Typhimurium yqiC deficient strain had a severe
attenuation in virulence in the murine model when inoculated both orally and intraperitoneally, and was impaired
to replicate at physiological and high temperatures in vitro, although it was still able to invade and replicate inside
epithelial and macrophages cell lines.
Conclusion: This work firstly demonstrates the importance of a COG2960 member for pathogen-host interaction,
and suggests a common function conserved among members of this group.

Background
Salmonella enterica is an intracellular facultative anaerobe
Gram-negative that infects a variety of hosts, which
include mammals, avians and reptiles. In human beings, S.
enterica causes over 33 million cases of disease worldwide
annually, which may vary from gastroenteritis and diarrhea
to severe life-threatening systemic disease (typhoid fever)
[1]. The outcome of the disease depends on both the serovar of Samonella and the host susceptibility. Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), can
infect humans and animals, but causes different syndromes in each host. In humans, Salmonella produces
enterocolitis, but in mice it causes a systemic illness that
resembles human typhoid fever. Because of this, S. Typhimurium is widely used as a model organism to study the

host-pathogen interactions that contribute to the onset of
the systemic disease [2,3].
The pathogenic strategy of S. Typhimurium includes
penetration of the mucosal barrier, invasion of non-phagocytic cells of the intestinal mucosa and survival and replication inside macrophages of the spleen and liver during
the systemic phase. The ability of S. Typhimurium to survive to host defense mechanisms and to cause disease has
been directly linked to genes encoded in pathogenicity
islands, which are large horizontally acquired regions of
the chromosome. Of outstanding importance are two type
three secretion systems (T3SS), which together with cognate effector proteins are essential for cell invasion, intracellular survival and, therefore, for mice colonization [4].
Besides, factors encoded in the genomic backbone of
Salmonella are also important for virulence in the murine
model [5-8].

the cluster of orthologous groups 2960 (COG 2960). This
COG includes 322 members (Pfam June 2010), encoded in
genomes of pathogenic, non-pathogenic and symbiotic
bacteria. In spite of the high conservation of this COG
across bacterial species, no description of the in vivo function of any member has been reported. In this work, we
carried out microbiological studies which demonstrate that
YqiC is required for the pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium
in the murine model, since a null mutant is highly attenuated when inoculated both orally and intraperitoneally. We
also show that this protein is dispensable for cell invasion
and intracellular replication in murine macrophages and
human epithelial cell lines, but it is necessary for efficient
growth at the mammalian host physiological temperature
outside the cells. The microbiological results are complemented by biophysical and biochemical studies. These analyses demonstrate that YqiC shares properties with the
recently reported BMFP from Brucella abortus (another
member of the COG 2960) which include a trimeric
coiled-coil structure and the ability to induce membrane
fusion in vitro [9]. The results presented here contribute to
elucidate the function of members of the COG 2960 and
their biological role.

Results
S. Typhimurium YqiC is a trimeric protein with a high
helical content

YqiC is a 99-residue protein of S. Typhimurium (UniProtKB entry K09806) which belongs to the cluster of
orthologous groups 2960 (COG 2960). The bioinformatic
analysis of the primary sequence of YqiC predicts a high
helical content (66-77%) http://www.predictprotein.org,
including two helical segments that span the N- and
C-terminal halves of the protein (encompassing residues
4-43 and 49-79, respectively). Both helical segments are
amphipathic but only the C-terminal one is predicted to
form a coiled-coil structure http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/
paircoil/paircoil.html. YqiC secondary structure was
experimentally determined by its far UV circular dichroism spectrum (Figure 1), which showed a typical signature
of an alpha helical protein. The percentage of helical structure of YqiC, estimated through the analysis of its CD
spectra using K2D program (63%), agrees with the percentage of amino acids involved in the predicted N- and
C-terminal alpha helices.
On the other hand, we studied the oligomeric state of
YqiC by chemical cross-linking and static light scattering. Chemical cross-linking of YqiC yielded trimers as
the largest products when the amount of cross-linking
reagent was increased (Figure 2A). Moreover, analysis of
YqiC by static light scattering coupled to size exclusion
chromatography showed a single homogeneous peak
with a molecular mass of 40.2 kDa, in agreement with a
trimeric structure (Figure 2B).

The characteristics described here are similar to the
structural features that we have previously reported for
Brucella abortus BMFP, which is a member of the COG
2960 that only conserves 22% sequence identity with
YqiC [9].
YiqC promotes membrane fusion in vitro

As YqiC shares structural properties with BMFP, we investigated if this protein also conserves the membrane fusion
activity reported for BMFP [9]. With this aim, we measured the increase in the size and aqueous content mixing
of phospholipids vesicles produced after YqiC addition.
Changes in the size and aggregation state of vesicles were
evaluated by turbidity measurements at 400 nm whereas
the aqueous content mixing was evaluated by measuring
the fluorescence of the Tb-DPA complex produced upon
fusion of vesicles containing TbCl3 or DPA encapsulated
in their aqueous interior phase, and the percentage of mixing was calculated as described in materials and methods.
Experiments were carried out on small unilamellar vesicles
composed of a mixture of DPPC and DPPA in a 75:25
molar ratio, both at acid or neutral pH. YqiC produced
both a significant increase in the turbidity (Figure 3A) and
aqueous content mixing (Figure 3B) in the vesicle solutions, mainly at acid pH, after addition of YqiC. These
results indicate that YqiC has a pH-dependent in vitro
fusogenic activity.
Subcellular localization of YqiC

To determine the subcellular localization of YqiC, we
performed a mechanical lysis fractionation procedure. A

into two fractions: the supernatant, which contains cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins, and the pellet fraction,

which contains the inner and outer membrane proteins.
Fractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting using
an anti-YqiC polyclonal antibody. YqiC was localized in
the two fractions, although lower levels of YqiC were
found in the membrane fraction (Figure 4). This result

composed of DPPC and DPPA in a molar ratio of 75:25. The lipid:protein molar ratio was 100: 1. The data presented are the results of a
representative experiment of three independent repetitions.

indicated that YqiC is both soluble and membrane associated inside the cell. As a control, we used an antibody
against the periplasmic protein MBP [10], which was
only detected in the supernatant fraction.
Evaluation of a yqiC defective strain phenotype in vitro

The in vivo functions of the members of the COG 2960 are
unknown. To investigate the role of YqiC protein in
S. Typhimurium, we constructed an S. Typhimurium
ATCC 14028 null mutant in yqiC through allelic exchange.
The resulting strain was named 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT. The
gene yqiC is encoded divergently to the ribB gene and convergent to the glgS gene in the S. Typhimurium chromosome. Thus, it appears that yqiC is transcribed as a
monocistronic element, and polar effects upon allelic
exchange are not expected. The successful elimination of
the yqiC gene was corroborated by PCR analysis and a western blot assay of cell lysates of 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT and its

complemented derivative (bearing plasmid pBBR-yqiC,
which encodes intact yqiC gene), using a polyclonal antibody raised against YqiC (data not shown). As a first
approach to assess the effect of the mutation in the
physiology of Salmonella, we tested the effect of temperature in the replication of yqiC mutant strain in LB. No difference in the growth pattern of the yqiC mutant strain
compared with the WT was detected at 28°C (average generation time 44.9 +/- 1.4). However, an increased generation time at 37°C was observed for 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT,
where the average generation time was 22.5 +/- 0.7 minutes for S. Typhimurium 14028 and 48 minutes for 14028
ΔyqiC::CAT (Figure 5). This difference in growth was
enhanced when the strains were incubated at 42°C, where
the average generation time was 30.2 +/- 0.68 minutes for
the WT strain and 78.9 +/- 0.7 minutes for the ΔyqiC::
CAT mutant strain. At both temperatures, trans complementation with the plasmid encoding yqiC restored the
wild-type growth curve pattern to 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT.
These results indicate that the mutation of yqiC affects the
ability of S. Typhimurium to replicate at physiological and
high temperatures. No growth curve pattern alteration was
observed for the 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT strain when incubated
in M9 minimal media or acid LB (pH = 4.0) at 28°C (data
not shown), which indicates that the yqiC mutant is neither
auxotrophic nor acid sensitive.
Survival of the STM-yqiCmutant in cultured cells

The pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium is critically dependent on its ability to infect and multiply into eukaryotic
cells. We investigated whether the 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT
strain was affected in its ability to invade and survive
within cultured eukaryotic cells. J774 murine macrophages

OD600 was measured at different time points over 48 hours. The data presented are the results of a representative experiment of three
independent repetitions.

and HeLa human epithelial cell lines were infected with
WT S. Typhimurium and 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT strains. As
the 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT strain grows defectively at physiological temperature, all strains were grown at 28°C prior to
infection. Infected cells were kept at 37°C and viable intracellular bacteria was determined in cell lysates at 1, 6 and
24 hours after infection. In both cell types, no differences
were detected at all time points examined in the CFU
recovered from cell lysates infected with the WT or the
yqiC mutant strains (Figure 6). This result indicates that
the yqiC gene does not contribute to neither Salmonella
entry nor intracellular survival in the cell types assayed.
Role of S. Typhimurim YqiC in virulence

In spite of the clear effect of the yqiC mutant strain on
growth at 37°C, we did not observe any defect in colonizing and surviving inside in vitro cultured eukaryotic
cells grown at 37°C. Thus, we evaluated the virulence of
the yqiC mutant in the murine model. To this aim, we
performed oral infections with S. Typhimurium ATCC
14028, 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT and 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT transcomplemented with yqiC in BALB/c mice. As illustrated
in Figure 7, no survival was registered by day 20 in mice
inoculated with WT strain. However, the yqiC mutant
showed complete attenuation in virulence, as all mice
infected with this strain survived along the 30-day period of the experiment. The yqiC gene provided in trans
fully complemented the 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT phenotype,
causing 100% mice death by day 19. In addition, we
determined the LD50 of S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028
and 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT in mice inoculated intraperitoneally as described in Materials and methods. A dramatic
increase in the LD50 was observed in the yqiC defective
strain (>5 × 105 CFU), as compared with the WT (10100 CFU) (Table 1). Together, these results clearly show
that YqiC is required for S. Typhimurium virulence in
the murine infection model.

Discussion
In this work we have characterized the YqiC protein of
S. Typhimurium. YqiC shares common structural and
biochemical characteristics with its previously reported
orthologous BMFP protein of Brucella abortus [9],
although these proteins share only 22% of sequence
identity and Brucella spp and Salmonella are phylogenetically distant bacteria. The common structural characteristics between YqiC and BMFP, namely high alpha
helix content, coiled coil C-terminal and amphipathic
alpha helix N-terminus, are also predicted by bioinformatics analysis for other proteins of the COG 2960
(such as those encoded by Escherichia coli, Shewanella
oneidensis, Legionella pneumophila, Xanthomonas campestris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis,
Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti and
Rhodopseudomonas palustris). This structural conservation strongly suggests a common function for the members of this COG.
In addition, we demonstrated that YqiC has membrane
fusogenic activity, like BMFP and other trimeric coiledcoil and/or amphipathic proteins [11,12]. This activity is
higher at acidic pH. A similar fusogenic activity at low
pH was observed for B. abortus BMFP (unpublished
data). The fusogenic activity could be relevant as many
processes that involve bacterial or host cell membrane
fusion events are important for pathogenic bacteria to
successfully establish host infection. In this regard, both
S. Typhimurium and B. abortus penetrate the cell by phagocytosis, and reside within a host vacuole that rapidly
undergoes acidification. This drop in the pH serves as a
signal for the expression of bacterial factors that alter
intracellular membrane traffic in order to set their replicative niche [13-15]. The improved YqiC activity at low
pH could indicate that this protein is active at the vacuolar stage of the bacterial infection. It is interesting to
highlight that YqiC shares structural similarity with

bacteria from cell lysates was determined 1, 6 and 24 hours post infection as described in Materials and methods. The reported value is the
media of duplicates of a representative experiment +/- standard deviation.

Figure 7 yqiC is essential for virulence in mice. BALB/c mice
were orally infected with 1 × 105 CFU of wild-type S. Typhimurium
ATCC 14028, 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT or 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT + pBBR-yqiC. The
survival of infected mice over time is shown.

S. Typhimurium-SipB protein, as both are predominantly
alpha helical in aqueous solution and have a coiled-coil
domain involved in trimerization [16]. SipB is an effector
protein essential for Salmonella invasion secreted
through the SPI-1-encoded T3SS and was the first bacterial protein reported to display membrane fusogenic
activity [16], however the function of this membrane
fusogenic activity in the bacterial pathogenesis has not
been clearly defined [17]. The activity of YqiC may be
required during the interaction of Salmonella with the
host cell to hijack membrane trafficking pathways. This
would probably be accomplished by competitive inhibition, mimicking eukaryotic membrane fusogenic proteins, such as the SNAREs (given the structural
similitude with these proteins) and inhibiting lysosomal
fusion with the Salmonella-containing vacuoles. Current
work is addressing whether YqiC is translocated to the
host cell.

Alternatively, the YqiC-membrane fusogenic activity
could be required during the biogenesis of bacterial
outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which are spherical
bilayered structures liberated from the outer membrane
in Gram negative bacteria [18]. OMV act as delivery
vesicles for bacterial toxins into host cells, promote
quorum sensing, are involved in stress response, inhibit
phagosome-lysosome fusion during bacterial growth
within macrophages and are important constituents of
the matrix of Gram-negative and mixed bacterial biofilm
[19-23]. To date, the machinery that cause vesicle formation remains elusive but it may be expected that a
protein with membrane fusion activity could be involved
in this process [18,24]. In this regard, in spite of the
lack of a signal peptide or transmembrane domains we
demonstrated that YqiC can be localized both soluble
and associated to membranes. This localization pattern
was also observed for B. abortus BMFP (unpublished
data). Subcellular localization pattern of YqiC may be in
tune with its hypothetical function in biogenesis of
OMV, as soluble and membrane-bound states of YqiC
can be related to transient associations of this protein
with the outer membrane. At this point, is interesting to
note that OMV produced by Shigella flexneri contain
IpaB, a SipB homologue which also displays membrane
fusion activity [25,26]. Accordingly, many of the bacterial species conserving an YqiC homolog have been
shown to generate OMV [18,27]. Further work is needed
to investigate the possible role of YqiC in the biogenesis
of OMV.
The in vivo importance of YqiC was demonstrated by
the fact that this protein is necessary for S. Typhimurium virulence in the murine model, as an yqiC mutant
strain was unable to kill mice within the period of time
assayed and had a significantly higher LD50. The basis
for this attenuation in virulence may be related to the
observed defect to grow at physiological temperature in
vitro. Temperature represents a common environmental
challenge that microorganisms should be able to sense
and respond to in order to survive [28]. Many other single gene mutations produce temperature-sensitive, virulence-attenuated Salmonella strains. Examples include

smpA, which encodes for an outer membrane lipoprotein, uspA, which encodes for an universal stress
response protein and the genes for DegP and DegQ proteases [29-31]. Interestingly, temperature sensitivity
could not be the only factor responsible for the virulence attenuation observed for the yqiC mutant, as this
strain was still able to invade and replicate inside
macrophages and epithelial cell lines incubated at 37°C.
These phenotypes may be due to differences in the
metabolic status and environmental conditions affecting
bacteria replication in rich media under laboratory conditions and inside the eukaryotic cell.

was then cloned into the EcoRI site of the broad-hostrange plasmid pBBR1MCS1 [33].
Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein

Conclusion
We have demonstrated in this work that S. Typhimurium YqiC shares structural and biochemical characteristics with B. abortus BMFP, in spite of their relatively
low sequence identity. Thus, members of the COG 2960
may accomplish a conserved function among phylogenetically distant bacteria. This function may be necessary
to display full virulence. This seems to be the case, as in
a parallel work we observed virulence attenuation when
analyzing a B. abortus BMFP-defective strain (Cravero et
al, unpublished work). This work is the first demonstration of the in vivo importance of a member of the COG
2960. However, future research is necessary to clarify
the physiological processes in which the membrane
fusogenic activity and possibly other unknown functions
of YqiC are required.

pET24D plasmid encoding the sequence of yqiC was
transformed in E. coli BL21 (lambda DE3). The cells
were grown in LB at 37°C to an OD 600 of 0.5 and
induced with 1 mM isopropyl b-D thiogalactoside
(IPTG) for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
3000 × g for 20 min, resuspended in binding buffer
(Qiagen), and disrupted by sonication with a probe tip
sonicator. Total cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 × g
for 30 min to remove non-soluble protein, cell debris,
and unbroken cells. Binding and elution from nickel
nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin were carried out under
native conditions according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Qiagen). Eluted proteins were dialyzed
against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Proteins
were assayed with a Coomassie blue-based staining
solution.

Determination of the Molecular Weight by Static Light
Scattering

Plasmid pET24D-YqiC (encoding full length YqiC protein)
was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028
chromosome DNA using primers 5’-AACCATGGTTGACCCGAAAAAAATT-3’ and 5’-TTCTCGAGCTCTT

Purified YqiC was cross-linked with ethylene glycol bis

[34] to evaluate the secondary structure content.
Turbidity Assay

Turbidity measurements were taken on a Multiskan
Spectrum double-beam spectrophotometer (Thermo
Electro Corp.) by using 1 cm matched silica cuvettes at
400 nm. The SUV concentration was 250 μM. The lipid:
protein ratio for the turbidity assays was kept at 50:1.

Transfer Membranes (Millipore) containing transferred
proteins were blocked in 5% nonfat milk PBS for 1 h,
and incubated with either a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal
anti-YqiC or 1:200 anti-MBP mouse polyclonal antibodies. The secondary antibody used was goat anti-mouse
IgG (Fc Specific) Peroxidase Conjugate (Sigma) at
1:1000 dilution. Positive signals were detected with Chemiluminiscent ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection
System (Amersham Biosciences) on a Storm Image and
Detection system (Molecular Dynamics).
Cell fractionation

Wild-type S. Typhimirium strain was grown in 80 mL
LB medium to an OD600 of 1 and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in
3 ml 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl and
mechanically lysed in a FastPrep instrument. Cell debris
was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 8000 × g.
Subsequently, membranes were sedimented by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g (4°C). The pellet was
resuspended in a volume equivalent to that of the supernatant. Samples from the supernatant and pellet fraction
were analyzed by immunoblotting.

Vesicle Internal Content Mixing

Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared containing either
5 mM terbium chloride, 50 mM sodium citrate,10 mM
Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), or 50 mM sodium dipicolinate (DPA)
and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The vesicles concentration
was 100 μM. In both cases, no encapsulated material was
removed by gel filtration of the vesicles using Sephadex
G-25 (Pharmacia) equilibrated with iso-osmolar 50 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Zero
percent and 100% fluorescence (aqueous content mixing)
were taken as the intrinsic fluorescence intensity of the
Tb/DPA-labeled liposome mixture and the fluorescence
obtained after vesicle lysis with 0.2% n-dodecyl maltoside
in assay buffer without EDTA as described by Duzgunes
et al [35]. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at
25°C using a Molecular Devices SpectroMAX GeminiEM
spectrofluorometer. The extent of vesicles aqueous content mixing was determinated according to the following
equation:
% aqueous content mixing = [(Ft − F0 )/(Fmax − F0 )] × 100

Where F 0 is the value of initial fluorescence of the
vesicles, Ft is the value of fluorescence after incubation
for t minutes with the protein, and Fmax is the value of
fuorescence after addition of 0.2% of n-dodecyl
maltoside.
Immunoblot analysis

Polyclonal anti-YqiC primary antibodies were obtained
in mice immunized with purified YqiC. Immobilon-NC

Construction of yqiC S. Typhimurium mutant strain

Elimination of the yqiC gene was achieved by using
Lambda Red-mediated recombination described previously
[36]. A lineal DNA fragment that contains the sequence
for a chloramphenicol resistance cassette plus flanking
regions of yqiC was constructed by PCR using the pair of
primers 5’-CGCACTACAATAAGAGCTAACACTTACCAGTTCAGGGAAAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC
G-3’ and 5’-TGGATCGACTGGCGGAATGGCGGGCGCAGGTTTTACTTCTCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA-3’.
5 μg of this construction were introduced into strain
LB5010 by electroporation. Chloramphenicol resistant
colonies were then verified by PCR using a set of primers
that hybridize within the insertion cassette and with an
adjacent chromosomal region. Finally, isogenic strain was
constructed by P22-mediated transduction of the mutant
DNA into S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028. The substitution
of the yqiC gene in this strain was verified by PCR and by
the lack of expression of YqiC protein using western blot
assay. The S. Typhimurium ΔyqiC::CAT mutant was
named 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT.
Mice infections

To determine the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the S. Typhimurium strains used, groups of seven 6-8 weeks old,
female, BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with serial 10-fold dilutions (from 1 × 101 to 1 × 105 CFU)
of the wild type S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 or 14028
ΔyqiC::CAT, and deaths were recorded for 28 days. For

oral infections with S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028, 14028
ΔyqiC::CAT and 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT trans-complemented
with pBBR-yqiC, mice were starved for food and water for
4 h. Following starvation, 105 CFU of each specific strain
in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) were administered by oral gavage to each mouse. Survival of infected
mice was recorded over 30 days. Inoculation doses were
verified by serial dilution and plating into LB agar.

Cell invasion and intracellular replication

7.

J774 murine macrophages and HeLa human epithelial
cell lines were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per
well in 24-well culture plates. Stationary phase cultures
of S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028, 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT
and complemented strain 14028 ΔyqiC::CAT + pBBRyqiC grown at 28°C overnight were added to the cells at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Culture plates
containing infected cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 10 min and incubated at 37°C for 30 min to allow
bacterial uptake and invasion. The extracellular bacteria
were removed by washing thrice with PBS and incubating with 100 μg/ml gentamycin for 1 h. Thereafter, the
cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml gentamycin for the
rest of the experiment. After 1, 6 and 24 h, the cells
were lysed with 1 mL of 0.1% Triton-X 100 per well
and bacterial counts were determined by plating serial
dilutions of the lysates on LB agar plates with appropriate antibiotic followed by incubation at 28°C.
