Abstract
Background: Expansins and expansin-like proteins loosen cellulose microfibrils, possibly through the rupture of
intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Together with the use of lignocellulolytic enzymes, these proteins are potential
molecular tools to treat plant biomass to improve saccharification yields.
Results: Here we describe a new type of expansin-related fungal protein that we have called loosenin. Its
corresponding gene, loos1, from the basidiomycete Bjerkandera adusta, was cloned and heterologously expressed
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. LOOS1 is distantly related to plant expansins through the shared presence of a DPBB
domain, however domain II found in plant expansins is absent. LOOS1 binds tightly to cellulose and chitin, and we
demonstrate that cotton fibers become susceptible to the action of a commercial cellulase following treatment
with LOOS1. Natural fibers of Agave tequilana also become susceptible to hydrolysis by cellulases after loosenin
treatment.
Conclusions: LOOS1 is a new type of protein with disrupting activity on cellulose. LOOS1 binds polysaccharides,
and given its enhancing properties on the action of hydrolytic enzymes, LOOS1 represents a potential additive in
the production of fermentable sugars from lignocellulose.

Background
The central technological impediment to the full industrial utilization of lignocellulose is the general absence
of low-cost technology for overcoming its recalcitrance
[1]. Filamentous fungi, especially white-rot type basidiomycetes, efficiently degrade plant cell wall biopolymers
due to the production of a battery of extracellular
enzymes such as cellulases, hemicellulases and ligninases
[2]. Basidiomycete fungi represent a source of enzymes
with potential applications due to their elevated ligninolytic activity. Bjerkandera adusta is a basidiomycete fungus well known for its high ligninase activity [3] and
recently, its cellulolytic capabilities have been characterized [4,5].
Plant cell walls are physiologically remodeled by a
group of proteins with the ability to relax their components and promote cell enlargement [6]. These proteins,

called expansins, are also involved in organogenesis [7],
abscission [8], initiation of leaves [9], fruit ripening
[10,11], pollen tube penetration of the stigma, and other
developmental processes in which cell wall modification
occurs [12-14]. It has been proposed that expansins disrupt non-covalent bonds between cellulose microfibrils
and matrix polymers by a non-enzymatic mechanism
leading to wall loosening and extension [15]. The classification of expansins is based on their phylogenetic relationships. In plants, four families form the expansin
superfamily comprising: a-expansin (EXPA), b-expansin
(EXPB), expansin-like A (EXLA) and expansin-like B
(EXLB). In contrast to EXPA and EXPB, for which
experimental data showed cell wall loosening [6,16,17],
the function of the EXLAs and EXLBs has been deduced
solely from their gene sequences, and to date, only one
example of biological activity has been established for a
member of the EXLB family, involved in root colonization by a mycorrhizal fungus in tomato plants [18].
Expansin proteins contain between 250-275 amino
acids, divided among two domains and a signal peptide.
The N-terminal domain (or domain I) acquires a DPBB

(double psi beta barrel) fold, with structural and
sequence similarity to glycoside hydrolase family 45
(GH45) proteins, a b-1,4-endoglucanase family [19,20].
Domain II, at the C-terminus, presents homology to
proteins of the group 2 pollen allergens, and has been
hypothesized to function as a polysaccharide-binding
domain, although this is yet to be proven experimentally
[19,20]. Another group called expansin-like family X
(EXLX) has been identified. This group comprises of
proteins with distant homology to EXPAs and EXPBs,
and are present in non-plant organisms [21]. Protein
sequences with homology to expansins have been found
in slime molds [22], bacteria [23,24], and ascomycete
fungi [25,26]. Here, we report the identification and
characterization of loosenin, a novel expansin-type protein, (LOOS1) from Bjerkandera adusta. Part of the
loosenin sequence is similar to the DPBB domain present in plant expansins, and fungal b-1,4-endoglucanase
family 45. The heterologously expressed LOOS1 preparations bind polysaccharides, permit sugar release
from cellulose after treatment with a commercial cellulase and show loosening activity on cotton fibers.
Finally, the recalcitrant natural lignocellulosic substrate
Agave tequilana bagasse was 7.5 times more susceptible
to the action of a cocktail of cellulases and xylanases
after it had been previously treated with LOOS1.

Results
Cloning of loos1 gene

We were interested in finding novel cellulolytic and
cellulose-disrupting activities of fungal origin. Upon
analysis of 768 sequenced clones from a subtracted
cDNA library from B. adusta (Cuervo et al; manuscript
in preparation), one sequence, that we have termed
loos1, was selected because it presented high identity
to proteins from fungal species Laccaria bicolor
[EMBL:B0CQ69] 64%, Schizophyllum commune [EMBL:
D8QC43] 53%, and Flammulina velutipes [EMBL:
ACZ59470.1] 54%, annotated as expansin family proteins (Additional File 1, Table S1 and Figure S1). We
aimed to determine if loos1 was also expressed under
lignocellulose growing conditions. cDNA was amplified
by RT-PCR from total RNA, obtained from B. adusta
grown on wheat straw medium. The PCR product was
cloned and its sequence confirmed. The analysis of the
390 bp clone suggested that it encodes a novel type of
protein with distant homology (approximately 20%) to
the family of plant expansins, that we named loosenin
[GenBank:GU322016].
loos1 genomic DNA sequence includes three introns I, II
and III, two of which (introns II and III) exhibit the canonical 5’-GT....AG-3’ donor-acceptor pairs. Intron lengths
are 55, 53 and 52 nt, respectively, in agreement with the
average intron size of filamentous fungi (50-70 bp), and

Page 2 of 9

account for 160 extra nucleotides relative to the cDNA
(Figure 1a). The 5’ and 3’ UTRs are predicted to consist of
98 and 100 nucleotides respectively (Figure 1b).
Homology Modeling of Loosenin

The loosenin amino acid sequence was used for fold
recognition using the PHYRE web server version 0.1.
The top three results were EXLX1 from Bacillus subtilis
[PDB:2BH0], the homologue pollen allergen PHL P1
N-terminal domain from Phleum pratense [PDB:1N10]
and an EXPB and group-1 allergen from maize
[PDB:2HCZ]. All had an estimated precision of 100%
indicating a successful fold assignment to the DPBB fold
family. Primary sequences identities were 19, 19 and 20%
respectively confirming that loosenin is indeed a remote
homologue of the expansins. We used the alignments
provided by PHYRE to construct five models of the complete loosenin amino acid sequence with 2BH0, 1N10
and 2HCZ as templates using maximum MD-refinement.
All five models were essentially identical with an average
RMSD of 0.4 Å. Structures 2BH0 and 1N10 had an
RMSD (of the equivalent superimposed alpha-carbons) of
around 1.4 Å to the models when 2HCZ had an RMSD of
0.5 Å, although amino acid identity to loosenin was very
marginally greater (Figure 2). This measure would reflect
the similarity of the proteins cores. Unlike typical expansins, loosenin is composed of a single domain, albeit one
highly similar to domain I of expansins, as evidenced by
fold recognition. Kerff et al [27] performed a sequence
analysis of EXLX1 (structure 2BH0) together with other
polysaccharide recognizing proteins through which they
identified several conserved residues. Similarly, we superimposed the loosenin model with the above-mentioned
structures and identified the equivalent residues.
In loosenin, T31 and D105 (highlighted in cyan in Additional File 1, Figure S2) correspond to the two strictly
conserved residues, equivalent to T12 and D82 in
EXLX1, and known to form a conserved hydrogen bond
between the OH group of Thr and the carboxylic group
of Asp. Other residues that show perfect sequence conservation between loosenin and the other three structures are G38, A39, G75, T92, and D93. Four more
positions identified as important by Kerff et al correspond to loosenin Y33 (also conserved in 2HCZ and
1N10, however it is substituted by a T in 2BH0); A52
(conserved in 2BH0, but found as C in the other two
structures); D103 (is substituted by A in 2BH0, or H in
1N10 and 2HCZ); and finally F109 (found conserved in
the rest of the structures as an L). Except for G75, all
these residues were identified by Kerff et al. as part of
the groove which is thought to serve as the polysaccharide binding site by means of hydrogen bonding. The
model thus suggests that loosenin is also a polysaccharide binding protein.

coding sequence of loos1. Introns I, II and III are shown in lowercase italic letters, to compare to the coding sequence of loos1.

Heterologous expression of Loosenin in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae

To determine if loosenin affects cellulose, loos1 cDNA
was cloned and heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under a regulatable Cu-responsive

promoter. The recombinant LOOS1 was secreted and
enriched preparations were obtained by ultrafiltration
from culture supernatants (Figure 3a). Preparations of
crude extracts and enriched protein showed that
loosenin molecular weight is approximately 15 kDa
when expressed in yeast (Figure 3a), suggesting some
type of post-translational modification, given the predicted 11.4 kDa molecular weight of the mature protein.
LOOS1 is a polysaccharide binding protein

Since LOOS1 contains a potential polysaccharide binding groove, we investigated its binding ability to two different substrates: crystalline cellulose (Avicel) and chitin.
Indeed, LOOS1 was only found in the precipitated fraction after incubation with the substrates (Figure 3b).
Binding of BSA to the same substrates was non-specific
and clear bands can be observed on both, the precipitated and the soluble fractions (Figure 3b).
Loosenin allows endoglucanase activity on commercial
cotton fibers

Kerff et al as belonging to the polysaccharide binding groove in
BsEXLX are indicated as sticks. Strictly conserved residues in Kerff’s
analysis are indicated in cyan and conserved residues in yellow. The
structural alignment and figure were produced with Pymol.

To explore the susceptibility of loosenin-treated cotton
fibers to the hydrolytic action of enzymes that act on
amorphous cellulose, a commercial preparation of cellulase corresponding principally to endoglucanase (E.C
3.2.1.4, as experimentally confirmed) (Additional File 1,
Figure S3), was added to loosenin-treated cotton fibers.
Reducing sugars (RS) release was achieved in the presence of cellulase at a velocity of 1.12 μmol per minute
when the fibers had been previously treated with 20 μg

of loosenin (Figure 3c), for a specific activity of 56 IU/
mg/protein. The velocity of RS release was directly proportional to the amount of loosenin added to the reaction mixture (2.19 μmol/min when 40 μg of loosenin
were added [Figure 3c]), and specific activity of 54.75
IU/mg protein). This effect is specific to the presence of
LOOS1, given that addition, at the same concentrations,
of proteins from mock supernatants of S. cerevisiae cultures or an irrelevant protein (BSA) produced no activity
after treatment with cellulase (Figure 3c; and Additional
File 1, Figure S4). Additionally, although mercerization
allowed higher levels of RS release from loosenin treated
fibers in comparison to non-mercerized fibers (compare
Figure 3C with Additional File 1, Figure S5a) no RS
release was detected in the untreated control, indicating

that mercerization treatment does not disrupt the fibers
to allow sugar liberation by cellulase (Figure 3c). Finally,
lack of RS release in the absence of cellulase indicates
that loosenin has no cellulolytic activity per se.
Thermal- and pH-stability of loosenin

Since robustness of enzymes is a key factor for industrial applications, the analysis of the thermal- and
pH-stability of LOOS1 was carried out. Thermostability of LOOS1 was analyzed by incubating the reaction
of loosenin and cotton fibers at 15, 25, 40, 60 and 80°
C, and then adding cellulase to monitor the release of
RS at 50°C. Specific activity at 25°C was 55.58 IU/mg
protein. No RS were detected after treatment at 40°C
and higher temperatures, indicating than LOOS1

Quiroz-Castañeda et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:8
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/8

activity is not thermostable (data not shown). Similarly,
the effect of incubating LOOS1 for 8 h in buffers with
pH ranging from highly acidic to highly alkaline was
analyzed. In this case, at pH 3, LOOS1 retained 42.6%
of its original activity (24.17 IU/mg compared to 56.7
IU/mg achieved at pH 5). At neutral pH LOOS1
remaining activity decreased to 49.5%, and to 10.6% at
pH 10 (Figure 3d).
Loosenin allows digestion of a natural lignocellulosic
material

We also analyzed the effect of incubating Agave
tequilana fibers with loosenin and then treatment with
a commercially available mixture of cellulases and xylanases (GC 220). After 10 min of incubation with GC
220, loosenin-treated agave fibers samples contained 3.2
times more RS than samples treated with GC 220 only,
and by one hour of incubation loosenin-treated samples
contained 7.5-fold more RS than the untreated samples
(Figure 4).
Loosenin exhibits disrupting-activity on cellulose

Loosenin disruptive-activity on cotton fibers was then
investigated. Cotton fibers incubated for 8 h with 20 μg
LOOS1, mock supernatant proteins or acetate buffer
only were visualized by phase contrast microscopy. The

Washed A. tequilana bagasse was cut into pieces and then
incubated with 50 mM acetate buffer, 50 mM acetate buffer plus

during 8 h at room temperature. Then, one μl of GC 220 (equivalent
to 1 U of endoglucanase) was added and samples taken at the
indicated time points to analyze for RS release. Acetate buffer

cotton fibers in the untreated controls had a homogeneous structure with widths between 13 and 17 μm
along the fiber (Figure 5). On the contrary, LOOS1treated fibers showed local disruption of the fiber structure observed as enlarged “bubbles” (defined as those
loosened structures measuring at least 40 μm width;
Figure 5), 2.6 times wider with respect to the untreated
controls. The occurrence of these bubbles also depended
on the concentration of loosenin added, being observed
at a frequency of 1 bubble/field at 20 μg (average width:
52.25 μm ± 10.07), and 1.6 bubbles/field at 40 μg (average width: 66.62 μm ± 10.62), compared to the absence
of evident bubbles in the untreated control (which occasionally showed wider regions of up to 30 μm, average
width: 26.60 μm ± 4.21) (Figure 5). Loosened areas of
cellulose have been previously reported for fungal swollenins that show expansin-like activity [26].

Discussion
Cellulose recalcitrance remains a limiting factor for
enzymatic hydrolysis in biofuels production. Increasing
of the loosened cellulose surface area by the use of nonhydrolytic proteins (a process called amorphogenesis)
would allow access to hydrolytic enzymes making the
saccharification process more efficient. We have cloned
and characterized a new type of expansin-related
protein, loosenin, from the basidiomycete fungus
Bjerkandera adusta that seems to have a role in amorphogenesis. This is the first report of a protein with
expansin-like activity for a basidiomycete. Indeed, Blast
similarity searches recovered fungal sequences annotated
as members of the expansin superfamily. Despite the
low primary sequence similarity of LOOS1 to plant
expansins (approximately 20%), its three-dimensional

model fits domain I of the crystallized EXLX1 from
Bacillus subtillis, Zea mays b-expansin and PHL P1
homologue with the highest score possible, and conserves those residues thought to be involved in binding
to the polysaccharide chain.
Interestingly, the structure of loosenin consists of only
one domain with a DPBB fold, the first reported of this
type, suggesting that this structure might be sufficient to
produce cellulose-disrupting activity. Expansin domain
II appears to bind carbohydrates via a number of hydrophobic residues that tightly associate with the substrate,
given the need of local (cell specific) cell wall disruption.
For loosenin, both binding and disrupting activity reside
in domain I. On the other hand, expansin domain II
could serve other purposes, such as providing higher
activity or stability. It was also noticed by Kerff et al,
that the potential polysaccharide binding groove of
domain I is extended by three aromatic residues on the
surface of D2, allowing the binding of four additional
saccharide units, suggesting a stronger union to the
polysaccharide and possibly increasing its activity
towards it. Loosenin is a good model to answer these
questions by making fusions to homologues of expansin
domain II.
Our work demonstrates that, in accordance with the
prediction of the three-dimensional modeling, LOOS1
binds specifically to crystalline cellulose and chitin.
Furthermore, loosenin is indeed a cellulose-disrupting protein, and that cotton and Avicel (which behaved in the
same way as cotton when mercerized or not in the presence of loosenin [Additional File 1, Figure S5b and S5c]),
are modified by its action. Indeed, dose-dependent LOOS1
treatment of cotton fibers induces local disruptions that
possibly become a substrate for an endoglucanase enzyme
that otherwise could not act upon them, supporting its
role as a protein involved in amorphogenesis. It is important to remark that loosenin, contrary to plant expansins,
was successfully heterologously expressed in yeast, given
the industrial significance of cellulose-disrupting proteins
and cellulolytic enzymes. The putative secretion signal
sequence of loosenin seems to be recognized by S. cerevisiae because the protein was found in the culture supernatants. The activity of loosenin purified from B. adusta
itself remains to be analyzed and compared to that
reported here, given that it is known that S. cerevisiae
hyperglycosylates secreted proteins in some cases (N-glycosylation). Indeed, loosenin molecular weight was higher
than the predicted by its primary sequence (15 versus 11.4
kDa) suggesting a posttranslational modification. In this
respect, three O-glycosylation sites were predicted at positions 3, 105 and 107, but no N-glycosylation sites were
found for the loosenin of B. adusta. Further experiments
are needed to understand the role of glycosylation on loosenin activity.

Page 6 of 9

The biological function of loosenin in B. adusta
remains to be analyzed. It is possible that the fungus
uses this protein to efficiently degrade lignocellulose
together with a battery of extracellular hydrolytic
enzymes (ligninases, cellulases, xylanases, etc). However,
a role of loosenin in the physiology of the fungus cannot
be ruled out, as it could also participate in the remodeling of the fungal cell wall to allow hyphal growth as
suggested for Aspergillus nidulans EglD with an expansin-like motif [25].
Finally, loosenin represents a good candidate as an
additive to enhance sugar production from plant biomass. Loosenin activity was more efficient when the lignocellulosic materials were mercerized, as seen for other
saccharification processes. Agave tequilana is a crop
extensively grown in some areas of Mexico, and the
shredded fibrous waste is usually burnt or left to decompose. Indeed, A. tequilana fiber became a susceptible
substrate for a cocktail of commercial cellulases and
xylanases in the presence of LOOS1. Loosenin shows
optimum activity at the same pH as most cellulolytic
enzymes. And although it is not a thermostable protein,
probably because of the temperate origin of B. adusta,
similar sequences are present in a number of other
basidiomycetes fungi, opening the possibility to find
them expressed also in thermophilic species, such as
Pycnopourus sanguineus [28], or others. It is important
to remark upon the low enzymatic activity needed in
combination with loosenin to observe its effect, given
the high costs of enzymes at industrial levels.

Conclusions
Here we describe a new type of protein with a role in
amorphogenesis of cellulose that we have called loosenin, from the basidiomycete Bjerkandera adusta. Loosenin is distantly related to plant expansins, binds to
cellulose and chitin, and has a disrupting activity on
cellulose fibers. Treatment of lignocellulosic materials
(cotton fibers and Agave tequilana bagasse) with loosenin enhances sugar liberation after the addition of
commercial cellulases, suggesting an interesting potential use for the production of fermentable sugars from
lignocellulose.
Methods
Strains and growth conditions

Bjerkandera adusta strain UAMH 8258 was kindly provided by Dr. Rafael Vazquez-Duhalt. Mycelium was grown
on PDA medium (2% potato, 2% dextrose and 1.5% agar)
for its propagation and stocking. For the isolation of loos1
gene, B. adusta was grown in 2% wheat straw liquid medium (mineral base medium: 7.8 mg/L CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O,
18 mg/L FeSO4·7H2O, 500 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 10 mg/L
ZnSO4, 50 mg/L KCl, 1 g/L K2HPO4 and 2 g/L NH4NO3,

1.5% agar; pH 5 (modified from [29]) supplemented with
powdered wheat straw (maximum and minimum particle
sizes of 3 and 0.5 mm), for 5 days at 28°C and 200 rpm.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303a (MATa
can1-100 ade2-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 12 trp1-1 ura3-1)
was grown in SC-Ura-minus medium [0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 2% dextrose (Baker), adenine 20 mg/L,
leucine 60 mg/L, tryptophan 20 mg/L and histidine
20 mg/L (Sigma-Aldrich)]. For heterologous expression of
loosenin, SC-Ura-minus medium was supplemented with
50 μM Cu2SO4 and cells were grown at 28°C for 1 day.
E. coli strain DH5a was used for plasmid propagation
and manipulation according to [30].
Molecular cloning of loos1

loos1 sequence was originally identified by BLAST analysis (Additional File 1, Table S1) of clones obtained
from a subtracted cDNA library from B. adusta grown
in the presence of crude oil (Cuervo, et al, manuscript
in preparation). The sequence was then amplified from
a sample of total RNA of B. adusta grown in wheat
straw medium by Reverse Transcription coupled-PCR
with primers LOOS1fwd: 5’-CGGAATTCATGTTCTTCAACG-3’ and LOOS1rev: 5’-CCTCGAGCTAATCCAGGGT-3’. The primers sequences included EcoRI
and XhoI sites (underlined) at the 5’- and 3’-ends,
respectively, to facilitate subsequent cloning steps. The
390 bp PCR fragment was purified and cloned into the
pGEM-T (Promega) vector resulting in pGEM-LOOS1,
and its sequence was confirmed (Macrogen, USA).
Genomic DNA extraction

Mycelium grown for 7 days in liquid wheat straw medium was collected, frozen and pulverized with liquid
nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted with UltraClean
Megaprep Soil DNA kit (MoBio), and used as template
for PCR amplification with primers LOOS1fwd and
LOOS1rev. The PCR product was cloned in plasmid
pGEM-T (Promega) resulting in vector pGEM-LOOS1
g, and its sequence was determined (Macrogen USA).
Domain prediction

Conserved domains were identified using the CDD
(Conserved Domain Database, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) and InterProScan (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/) databases.
Structural Modeling of Loosenin

We identified templates for Loosenin homology modeling using the PHYRE Protein Fold Recognition Server
[31]. This program identified two expansins and one
expansin-homologue with the highest scores (100% estimated precision). We then modeled the Loosenin
sequence using the program modeller9v7 [32] using the

Page 7 of 9

sequence alignments obtained by PHYRE simultaneously generating 5 models with a molecular dynamics
level of refine.very_slow. The four resulting models
were compared using Pymol (DeLano Scientific LLC),
first by fitting them together and then comparing the
structures.
Expression of recombinant LOOS1 in yeast

Plasmid pGEM-loos1 was digested with EcoRI and XhoI
and the 390 bp resulting fragment was subcloned in vector pSAL3 [33], giving rise to plasmid pSAL3-loos1.
Yeast strain W303a was transformed with plasmid
pSAL3-loos1 or empty pSAL3 by the lithium acetate
method [34], and selected on solid SC-Ura-minus medium. After 3 days of incubation, one colony of each
transformation was grown in a pre-inocule of 20 ml of
SC-Ura-minus medium at 28°C and 250 rpm to mid
log-phase (between 0.4-0.6 OD), at this point a dilution
was made to 0.1 OD in 1 L of SC-Ura-minus medium,
adding Cu2SO4 to a final concentration of 50 μM, and
supplementing the media with protease inhibitors
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Complete®
Roche). Finally, cells were grown to 0.8 OD to recover
supernatant by centrifugation (1073 × g for 10 min at
4°C), that was kept at 4°C until use.

Supernatant recovered from 1 L yeast cultures was concentrated 50 times by ultrafiltration through a 10 kDa
cut-off membrane (Amicon stirred cell 8400, and Ultracell membranes, Millipore), and then filtered through a
30 kDa cut-off membrane (Amicon Ultra 4 Centrifugal
Filter, Millipore). The filtrate was recovered and concentrated again through 10 kDa cut-off membranes (Amicon Ultra 4 Centrifugal Filter, Millipore) to a final
volume of 200 μl. Mock supernatant from empty pSAL3
vector cultures was only concentrated by ultrafiltration
(10 kDA cut-off). Protein concentration was measured
according to [35] using a bovine serum albumin (BSA)
standard curve. Enrichment and molecular weight estimations of recombinant loosenin were performed resolving 20 μg of protein in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
20 μg of mock supernatant were loaded as well. The PA
gel was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250
(Sigma-Aldrich) and distained with a solution of methanol:water and acetic acid. Treatments of samples with
loosenin were performed with these enriched preparations throughout this work.
Polysaccharides binding assay

The assay was performed as reported by [36] with
some modifications. Avicel PH-101 (Fluka) and chitin
from shrimp shells (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as binding matrices. 40 μg of LOOS1 or BSA were mixed

Quiroz-Castañeda et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10:8
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/1/8

with 50 mg of binding matrix suspended in 200 μl of
15 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM
NaCl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min with agitation, and then the supernatant was removed by centrifuging at 13,500 rpm/2 min/RT (unbound fraction).
Pellets were washed 4 times with the same buffer; the
protein was dissociated from the matrix by boiling
with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (bound fraction). Both
fractions were loaded in a 15% polyacrylamide gel and
resolved by electrophoresis. Gels were stained with
Coomassie blue.
Loosenin treatment of cotton fibers

Pharmaceutical-grade cotton fibers were mercerized
according to [26]; briefly, 7 mg of cotton fibers were
incubated with 25% NaOH for 15 min at 4°C, and
washed several times with distilled water to eliminate
the excess of alkali. Loosenin and control treatments of
the fibers were as follows: incubation with (a) 20 or
40 μg of loosenin in 1 ml of 50 mM acetate buffer pH
5 for 8 h at 25°C; (b) 20 or 40 μg of proteins from
mock supernatants, (c) buffer only, (d) 0.5 U of commercial Trichoderma viride cellulase (Sigma-Aldrich
Cellulase E.C 3.2.1.4, Catalogue no. C-1794). For microscopic observations these reaction mixtures (a-c) were
sonicated (Ultrasonic cleaner 1510, Branson) for 1 min,
after incubation and the cotton fibers visualized by contrast phase microscopy (Zeiss).
Reducing sugars release assay

Commercial T. viride cellulase was added to final
concentration of 0.5 U to the above reaction mixtures
(a-c) after 8 h of incubation at 25°C, and the temperature increased to 50°C. Aliquots of 50 μl were then
taken at 10, 20, 40 and 60 min after the addition of
cellulase. Concentration of released reducing sugars
was determined using the DNS method described previously [4]. All assays were performed in triplicate.
Specific activity of loosenin was indirectly calculated
by dividing the amount of RS release after the loosenin/cellulase treatment by the amount of loosenin
protein used in the assay that although non-hydrolytic,
should indirectly reflect the degree of disorganization
of the fiber.
Thermal- and pH-stability of loosenin

Heat-stability of loosenin was assayed by incubation of
mercerized cotton as explained before except that loosenin-treatment reactions (or control reactions) were carried out at 40, 60 or 80°C; treatment was ended by
placing the samples on ice, and then incubated at 50°C
after the addition of cellulase. Quantification of RS
release was then performed as explained above. Similarly, pH-stability determination was performed in

Page 8 of 9

reactions at pH ranging from 3 to 10, followed as well
by quantification of RS release at pH 5. System buffers
were McIlvaine (pH 3), sodium citrate (pH 5 and 7),
and borate-HCl (pH 10).
Treatment of a natural lignocellulosic substrate

Agave tequilana fiber was cut with scissors into 2.5-5
mm pieces, and washed with distilled water overnight
and five consecutive times, after which no RS release
were detected by the DNS method. Then, 25 mg of
these fibers were mercerized as explained above, and
then incubated 8 h at 25°C with 20 μg of LOOS1 or
with 20 μg of proteins from mock supernatant in 1 ml
50 mM acetate buffer pH 5. Next, 1 μl of commercially
available enzyme cocktail GC 220 (Genencor-Danisco)
containing cellulases and xylanases activities, was added
to the reaction mixture (equivalent to 40 μl/g fiber and
to 1 U of endoglucanase, as determined experimentally),
and incubated at 50°C, to analyze for RS release through
time as explained before.
