Abstract
Background: Talins are large, modular cytoskeletal proteins found in animals and amoebozoans such as
Dictyostelium discoideum. Since the identification of a second talin gene in vertebrates, it has become
increasingly clear that vertebrate Talin1 and Talin2 have non-redundant roles as essential links between
integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in distinct plasma membrane-associated adhesion complexes. The
conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ module is important for talin function. This structural element mediates
the interaction of talins with F-actin. The I/LWEQ module also targets mammalian Talin1 to focal adhesion
complexes, which are dynamic multicomponent assemblies required for cell adhesion and cell motility.
Although Talin1 is essential for focal adhesion function, Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions. The
nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis has only one talin gene, but alternative splicing of the talin mRNA
produces two proteins with different C-terminal I/LWEQ modules. Thus, C. intestinalis contains two talins,
Talin-a and Talin-b, with potentially different activities, despite having only one talin gene.
Results: We show here that, based on their distribution in cDNA libraries, Talin-a and Talin-b are
differentially expressed during C. intestinalis development. The I/LWEQ modules of the two proteins also
have different affinities for F-actin. Consistent with the hypothesis that Talin-a and Talin-b have different
roles in cell adhesion, the distinct I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b possess different subcellular
targeting determinants. The I/LWEQ module of Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions, where it most likely
serves as the link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton. The Talin-b I/LWEQ module is not targeted
to focal adhesions, but instead preferentially labels F-actin stress fibers. These different properties of C.
intestinalis the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules mimic the differences between mammalian Talin1 and
Talin2.
Conclusion: Vertebrates and D. discoideum contain two talin genes that encode proteins with different
functions. The urochordate C. intestinalis has a single talin gene but produces two separate talins by
alternative splicing that vary in a domain crucial for talin function. This suggests that multicellular organisms
require multiple talins as components of adhesion complexes. In C. intestinalis, alternative splicing, rather
than gene duplication followed by neo-functionalization, accounts for the presence of multiple talins with
different properties. Given that C. intestinalis is an excellent model system for chordate biology, the study
of Talin-a and Talin-b will lead to a deeper understanding of cell adhesion in the chordate lineage and how
talin functions have been parceled out to multiple proteins during metazoan evolution.

Background
The amoebozoan and animal talins (Fig. 1) are an ancient
family of modular proteins that link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane in several different multicomponent adhesion complexes [1-3]. The amoebozoan
cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum contains two
talins, each of which has a different role in the D. discoideum life cycle. TalA is required for cell motility and adhesion to the substrate in undifferentiated amoebae [4,5],
and TalB is required for morphogenesis during multicellular differentiation [6,7]. Vertebrates also have two talin
genes, TLN1 and TLN2, which encode Talin1 and Talin2,
respectively [3,8-10]. Talin1 is required for cell adhesion
and motility and is the primary talin component of focal
adhesions [6,7,11]. This role for Talin1 is analogous to
that of TalA in adhesion and migration of D. discoideum
amoebae [4,5]. Although Talin2 has not been completely
characterized, the available evidence indicates that Talin1
and Talin2 have non-redundant roles in vertebrates, with
Talin2 serving as a component of stable adhesions in differentiated tissues such as striated muscle [10]. This suggests that Talin2 may be an analog of D. discoideum TalB,
which is required for multicellular differentiation [6,7].
Thus, at opposite ends of the large phylogenetic distance
that separates amoebozoans and vertebrates within the
opisthokont (i.e., animals, amoebozoans, and fungi) lineage [3,12], two different talins are required for cell adhesion in distinct adhesion assemblies.
In contrast to D. discoideum and vertebrates, invertebrates
including Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans and the nonvertebrate chordate Ciona intestinalis
have only one talin gene [3]. However, alternative splicing
of the talin mRNA in D. melanogaster and C. intestinalis
produces multiple talins that vary at their C-termini [3].
Therefore, despite having only one talin gene, multiple
talin proteins can account for the biological functions of
talin in these organisms.
Little is currently known about the functions of these talin
splice variants. In this report we have determined that the
I/LWEQ modules of the alternative splice variants of C.
intestinalis talin have different actin-binding affinities and
different subcellular targeting signals. We show that the
Talin-b I/LWEQ module has a higher affinity for F-actin
than the Talin-a I/LWEQ module and is also targeted to
actin stress fibers in cells. In contrast, the Talin-a I/LWEQ
module does not label stress fibers, but is instead targeted
to focal adhesions. These differences are similar to those
seen with Talin1 and Talin2 in vertebrates, where Talin1 is
the link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton in
focal adhesions [11,13]. These results suggest that alternative splicing is an effective mechanism for producing distinct talin proteins with different functions in C.
intestinalis. The recent completion of its genome sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/40

has increased the utility of C. intestinalis as a model chordate [14-17]. Thus, further studies of Talin-a and Talin-b
in C. intestinalis will be useful in identifying fundamental
roles for distinct talin proteins in cell adhesion in chordates.

Results
Identification of C. intestinalis Talin-a and Talin-b
During a previous analysis of the evolutionary history of
amoebozoan and animal talins we determined that the C.
intestinalis genome contains one talin gene, but that alternative splicing produces two talin proteins, based on the
presence of multiple, distinct cDNA sequences in the GenBank expressed sequence tag (EST) database [3]. Like all
the other talins previously identified, the full-length C.
intestinalis talin contains an N-terminal FERM domain
linked to a C-terminal I/LWEQ module by a central α-helical rod domain [18]. In the present study we have identified multiple cDNA clones corresponding to C. intestinalis
Talin-a and Talin-b (Table 1). These data indicate that
Talin-a is perhaps more widely expressed, based on the
distribution of cDNAs in the available libraries, than
Talin-b. Talin-a cDNAs were found in libraries from the
whole adult organism, heart, gastrula/neurula, tailbud
embryo, free swimming larva, blood cells, neural complex, and testis. In addition to these C. intestinalis Talin-a
cDNAs, several Talin-a ESTs were also identified from the
tunicate Molgula tectiformis. Talin-b cDNAs have been
identified from libraries prepared from blood cells and
the adult organism. We have also identified a Talin-b EST
from a cDNA library prepared from gastrula of the tunicate Ciona savignyi, so this splice variant is not restricted
only to C. intestinalis (Table 1).

Comparison of the variant cDNA sequences of C. intestinalis with the genomic DNA sequence showed that the
two cDNAs are the result of alternative splicing at the end
of exon 48 of the talin transcript (Fig. 2A). The alternative
final protein-coding exon 49 produces talin proteins that
are 42% identical over their C-terminal 78 amino acids
(Fig. 2B). This sequence divergence is greater than that
between the paralogous human Talin1 and zebrafish
Talin2, which are 82% identical over the same region, and
is more comparable to the divergence between human
Talin1 and Caenorhabditis elegans talin, which are 57%
identical at their C-termini. Multiple sequence alignment
(Fig. 2C) of the C-termini of representative chordate talins
using CLUSTAL W [19] and conversion of that alignment
into an unrooted tree (Fig. 2D) using TreeView [20] illustrate the relatively high level of divergence of the C-terminus of the I/LWEQ module of C. intestinalis Talin-b from
the other chordate talins.

The I/LWEQ module is a conserved F-actin-binding element that also targets Talin1 to focal adhesions in mammalian cells [13].

Unambiguous Talin-a and Talin-b cDNAs were identified by comparison of the C-terminal protein sequences (Fig. 2B) with the original Talin-a and
Talin-b that we have previously identified [3]. CJ430072 is an EST for Talin-a from a larva cDNA library of the tunicate Molgula tectiformis;
BW522112 is an EST for Talin-b from a gastrula library from Ciona savignyi. All of the other sequences are from C. intestinalis. Talin-a and Talin-b
alignments of the C. intestinalis protein sequences derived from these ESTs are shown in Additional File 2 and Additional File 3, respectively.

Actin binding activity of the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ
modules
The I/LWEQ module of talins and other members of the
superfamily (e.g., fungal Sla2 and animal Hip1) specifies
actin binding in these proteins [2,9,21]. We have recently
determined that the C-terminus of the I/LWEQ module,
corresponding to the splice variant sequences of C. intestinalis Talin-a and Talin-b, contains the minimal actinbinding site of mammalian Talin1 [13]. This observation
led us to determine whether the actin-binding affinities of
the I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b for F-actin are
different (Fig. 3). We found that the Talin-b construct
binds to F-actin with an apparent Kd of 0.19 μM, while the
Talin-a I/LWEQ module bound with an apparent Kd of
0.76 μM. These values are similar to those we previously
determined for mammalian Talin1 and Talin2, whose Kd
values were 0.31 μM and 0.88 μM, respectively [22].
Subcellular targeting of Talin-a and Talin-b
Focal adhesions are dynamic multi-component adhesion
complexes required for cell adhesion and cell motility
[23,24]. Talin1 is required for the assembly of focal adhesions [25], and we recently determined that the I/LWEQ
module of Talin1 is also essential for targeting this talin
isoform to focal adhesions in mammalian cells [13].
Because C. intestinalis Talin-a and Talin-b vary in this subcellular targeting region of talin, we used expression of
dsRed-Talin-a and dsRed-Talin-b fusion proteins to determine whether the Talin-a and Talin-b I/LWEQ modules
also have different subcellular targeting determinants in
mammalian cells. Interestingly, we found that the I/
LWEQ module of Talin-a strongly labels focal adhesions
in HeLa cells (Fig. 4, column 1, arrowheads), where the
dsRed-Talin-a fusion protein colocalized with the diag-

nostic focal adhesion component vinculin (overlay).
Although the Talin-a I/LWEQ module does interact with
F-actin in vitro (Fig. 3), it did not preferentially label actin
stress fibers in cells (Fig. 4 column 2; arrowheads identify
dsRed-Talin-a in focal adhesions at the ends of stress fibers). In contrast to Talin-a, the Talin-b I/LWEQ module
was not targeted to focal adhesions (Fig. 4, column 3;
arrowheads identify stress fiber localization of dsRedTalin-b I/LWEQ module), but instead strongly labeled
actin stress fibers in HeLa cells (Fig. 4, column 4, arrowheads), where dsRed-Talin-b I/LWEQ module colocalized
with FITC-phalloidin-labeled F-actin (overlay).

Discussion
Analysis of EST data produced primarily by Nori Satoh
and colleagues of Kyoto University [26] has shown that
alternative splicing of talin pre-mRNA leads to the production of two proteins with different C-termini in C.
intestinalis. The variable distributions of Talin-a and Talinb in different cDNA libraries suggest that Talin-a and
Talin-b are differentially expressed during C. intestinalis
development. We have also shown that the variant I/
LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b have different biological properties: Talin-b has the higher affinity for Factin and preferentially labels actin stress fibers, while
Talin-a is targeted to focal adhesions. Therefore, alternative processing is a mechanism for producing multiple
talin proteins, with distinct activities associated with a
critical structural element, in these nonvertebrate chordates, even though the C. intestinalis genome contains
only one talin gene.
Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism for
expanding the proteome. In humans, 30–65% of all gene

Subcellular targeting of the I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talin-b. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with
either the dsRed-Talin-a.2341–2531 or the dsRed-Talin-b.2341–2531 fusion construct (I/LWEQ module) and counterstained
with vinculin to independently label focal adhesions or fluorescein-phalloidin to label F-actin, as previously described [13]. The
Talin-a I/LWEQ module targeted to focal adhesions, where the fluorescence signals for dsRed-Talin-a.2341–2531 and the focal
adhesion component vinculin overlap (Column 1, overlay). The Talin-a I/LWEQ module did not preferentially localize to actin
stress fibers (Column 2). In contrast to Talin-a, the Talin-b I/LWEQ module was not targeted to focal adhesions (Column 3).
However, dsRed-Talin-b.2341–2531 did colocalize with actin stress fibers, as shown by the colocalization of the fluorescence
signals of dsRed-Talin-b.2341–2531 with phalloidin-stained F-actin (Column 4, overlay).

products are subject to alternative splicing, and similar
levels are also seen in other organisms, including the
mouse, fruitfly, and nematode [27]. Alternative splicing
frequently results in changes in protein structure that alter
protein-protein interactions. For example, alternative
splicing of the non-erythroid protein 4.1R produces variants that alter the efficiency of the interaction with the
spectrin/actin complex by a factor of two [28]. This is similar to differences we have identified in the C. intestinalis
talin alternative splice variants, where the Talin-b I/LWEQ
module interacts with F-actin with a four-fold higher
affinity than that of Talin-a. The higher affinity for F-actin
may explain the preferential localization of the Talin-b I/
LWEQ module to actin stress fibers in cells.
Alternative splicing can also alter subcellular targeting
determinants of the resultant proteins [27]. HeLa cells
represent a heterologous system for the study of tunicate

talins in vivo, but we have recently used them to determine
that the C-terminal I/LWEQ module of Talin1 contains a
focal adhesion targeting determinant [13]. We have
shown here that the Talin-a I/LWEQ module, but not that
of Talin-b, is targeted to focal adhesions in HeLa cells.
Although focal adhesions have not yet been directly
observed in C. intestinalis cells, the C. intestinalis genome
contains genes for several characteristic focal adhesion
components that were previously thought to be restricted
to vertebrates. These include at least 14 α-integrins, 5 βintegrins, focal adhesion kinase, vinculin, and α-actinin
[15]. Vinculin and β-integrin are well-characterized Talin1
binding partners. Given the presence of these classical
focal adhesion proteins in C. intestinalis, our results suggest that Talin-a is likely to function similarly to mammalian Talin1 as an adhesion complex component during C.
intestinalis development. The lack of a focal adhesion-targeting determinant in the C-terminus of Talin-b may indi-

cate that this protein is a component of other adhesion
complexes in the organism, as we have seen with mammalian Talin2. Talin2 is not targeted to focal adhesions in
undifferentiated cells but is preferentially targeted to costameres and intercalated disks, which are stable adhesions
in differentiated striated muscle [10].
The presence of two related, but ancient and highly divergent talins (30% identical) with different physiological
roles in D. discoideum [4-6] supports the hypothesis that
gene duplication, followed by neo-functionalization, produced multiple talins that are required for cell adhesion
during cell differentiation [3,29]. A similar explanation
may also account for the maintenance of Talin1 and
Talin2 in vertebrates since duplication of the ancestral
animal talin early in the chordate lineage, more than 450
million years ago [3]. In support of this hypothesis regarding vertebrate talins, several recent studies have shown
that these distinct proteins indeed have different roles.
Talin1 and Talin2 interact with different proteins
[3,30,31] and have different affinities for their common
partner F-actin [22]. Talin1 is required for mammalian
embryogenesis, probably as an essential component of
adhesion complexes required for cell motility during gastrulation [32]. Talin2 is unable to complement this lethal
phenotype. We have recently shown that the adult tissue
distributions of mammalian Talin1 and Talin2 also vary,
with Talin1 being the more widely expressed isoform
[10]. Talin2 is most abundant in brain and muscle. We
have shown that Talin2 is induced during muscle differentiation along with other muscle-specific proteins such as
archvillin, integrin-β1D, and metavinculin, which is an
alternative splice variant of vinculin [10]. As expected,
Talin1 is a component of focal adhesions in undifferentiated myoblasts, but Talin2 is not found in focal adhesions
of these cells or other mammalian cells. Talin2 is instead
a component of stable adhesion assemblies such as costameres and intercalated disks in mature striated muscle
[10]. Taken together, these studies indicate that vertebrate
Talin1 and Talin2 are differentially expressed during cell
differentiation and organismal development and that
they function as non-redundant components of distinct
adhesion complexes in different cells and tissues. Thus, in
both D. discoideum and vertebrates, multiple talins are
involved in talin functions.
Development in C. intestinalis is a complex, multistage
process. Following fertilization and subsequent embryogenesis, a free-swimming tadpole larva containing a notochord, nervous system, and musculature settles upon a
solid substrate and metamorphoses into a sessile, filterfeeding organism. The adult contains organs common to
other chordates, including a digestive system, heart, and
nervous system [33]. C. intestinalis has only one talin gene,
but the existence of the splice variants Talin-a and Talin-b,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/40

which vary in the important C-terminal I/LWEQ module
[13], further supports the emerging paradigm that talin
function is due to the actions of distinct proteins, which
are expressed at different times and in different places during chordate development [3,10]. The results presented
here suggest that alternative splicing is the means by
which two talins with different roles in cell adhesion, and
perhaps cell differentiation, are produced from one talin
gene in C. intestinalis. Thus, this mechanism may bridge
the one-talin bottleneck present in invertebrates between
the multicellular amoebozoan D. discoideum [34] and vertebrates [3]. Further studies at the cellular and molecular
levels will identify when and where Talin-a and Talin-b
are produced in C. intestinalis, and how they contribute to
the assembly and function of adhesion complexes during
development of this model organism.

Conclusion
Taken together with previous studies showing that talin
function is due to the activities of distinct proteins, which
are differentially expressed and targeted to different adhesion complexes in multicellular organisms, our results
show that alternative splicing of the C. intestinalis talin
mRNA produces two different proteins, Talin-a and Talinb. These proteins vary in the C-terminal I/LWEQ module,
which is critical for talin function. Moreover, these differences lead to different activities of the alternative splice
variants. Our data suggest that C. intestinalis Talin-a is
involved in cell adhesion and motility in assemblies that
are similar to focal adhesions. Identification of the structural determinants responsible for the different properties
of Talin-a and Talin-b will expand our knowledge of how
different talins are involved in cell adhesion in chordates.
Given that C. intestinalis has recently re-emerged as a
model for the study of chordate development [33,35], further research comparing the roles of Talin-a and Talin-b
during C. intestinalis development will also increase our
knowledge of how talin functions have evolved during
animal evolution.

Methods
Identification of Talin-a and Talin-b
Talin-a and Talin-b cDNAs were identified in BLAST
searches [36] of the GenBank non-human, non-mouse
EST database using the C-terminal 250 amino acid
sequence of Ciona intestinalis talin [GenBank:
AABS01000025] as the query sequence [3]. Unambiguous
Talin-a and Talin-b cDNAs were identified by comparison
of the C-terminal protein sequences with the original
Talin-a and Talin-b that we identified previously [3]. Fulllength and partial C-terminal chordate talin sequences
were aligned with CLUSTAL W [19] using the European
Bioinformatics Institute server as previously described [3].
Unrooted trees were then calculated from these alignments using TreeView [20]. The sequence alignments in

Fig. 2 were prepared for display using MacBoxShade as
previously described [3].
PCR amplification of Talin-a/b from Ciona intestinalis
and protein preparation
Whole Ciona intestinalis adults were obtained from the
Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA). Organisms were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized, and
homogenized. RNA was extracted using RNAqueous-Midi
(Ambion). First strand cDNA was synthesized using
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 1 μg
total RNA and the oligo dT primer (5'-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'). Talin-a/b regions were
then amplified by PCR using gene specific primers with
the first-strand cDNA as a template: Talin-a/b sense, 5'CCGGAATTCATTTTGGAAGCCGCAAAATCAATCGC-3'
Talin-a antisense, 5'-CCTGGCGCGCCTTAATCGGATTCAGAATCATCCTTGT-3'
Talin-b
antisense,
5'CCTGGCGCGCCCTATTTCTTTTGGTTTTGCTCGTATTTC3' PCR amplicons were recovered using pCR2.1-TOPO
(Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pET-41 (Novagen)
for production of GST-fusion proteins. The proteins produced correspond to amino acids 2341–2531 for both
Talin-a and Talin-b. All constructs were verified by DNA
sequencing. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were prepared as previously described [2,22].
F-Actin Binding
Actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton, Inc (Denver, CO).
The binding of the I/LWEQ modules of Talin-a and Talinb to F-actin was determined as previously described
[2,22]. Briefly, F-actin co-sedimentation assays were performed in buffer A (2 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2
mM ATP, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), keeping the concentration of GST-Talin-a/b.2341–2531 constant at 4.0
μM while increasing the actin concentration from 0 to 25
μM in a total volume of 50 μl. Actin polymerization was
induced by addition of 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl and
allowed to proceed for 60 minutes at 22°C. The critical
concentration for actin polymerization is 0.71 μM under
these conditions. Following centrifugation at 160000 g for
20 minutes at 22°C, the supernatant and pellet fractions
were separated for subsequent analysis with SDS-PAGE
using 12% gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie
Blue G250. Digital quantification of the cosedimentation
data was performed using NIH Image v1.62 and binding
curves were calculated using GraphPad Prism 4.0 as previously described [2,22]. The R2 values for the binding
curves were 0.95 for Talin-a and 0.99 for Talin-b. Neither
GST-Talin-a.2341–2531 nor GST-Talin-b.2341–2531 sedimented at 160,000 g in the absence of F-actin. We have
determined previously that the presence of the GST purification tag has no effect on actin binding of I/LWEQ
module proteins [2,22]. The concentration of actin was
determined using its molar extinction coefficient at 290

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/7/40

nm. The concentrations of GST-Talin-a and GST-Talin-b
were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and
by calculating the extinction coefficient of each protein
[37].
Immunofluorescence
C. intestinalis Talin-a/b I/LWEQ module constructs were
subcloned from pET-41 to pDsRedC2-monomer (BD Biosciences) and verified by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells
(American Type Culture Collection CCL-2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100
μg/ml streptomycin and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. Glass coverslips were ethanol-washed and coated with 10 μg/ml
fibronectin. HeLa cells were plated on the coverslips in
complete growth medium and allowed to adhere for 12
hours. Transfection of HeLa cells was performed with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells
were transfected with 0.8 μg of DNA and 2 μl Lipofectamine 2000 in normal growth medium for 24 hours.
Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformadehyde, permeabilized briefly on ice with 1% Triton X-100, and labeled
with either anti-vinculin antibody at a dilution of 1:300
(V9131, Sigma) or FITC-phalloidin at 1:400 dilution as
previously described in our analysis of the subcellular targeting of mammalian Talin1 [13]. Fluorescence images
were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope and
processed using OpenLab (Improvision). Expression of
intact dsRed-Talin-a/b constructs in transfected cells was
confirmed in immunoblots using an anti-dsRed polyclonal antibody. We have shown previously that the addition
of a fluorescence tag to the N-terminus of both full-length
talin and talin I/LWEQ module constructs has no effect on
the talin subcellular targeting [10,13]. Transfection of
HeLa cells with the dsRed vector alone did not affect the
morphology of HeLa cells and dsRed protein was diffusely
distributed throughout the cytoplasm.

Alignment of full-length chordate talin protein sequences. A. Chordate
talin sequence alignment. Talin1 and Talin2 from human (Hs, Homo
sapiens), chicken (Gg, Gallus gallus), pufferfish (Tn, Tetraodon
nigroviridis), and Ciona intestinalis (Ci Tn-a/b) were aligned using
CLUSTAL W. The T. nigroviridis sequences are from the Genoscope
database [39] and have been annotated manually. The G. gallus Talin2
sequence was compiled manually from the current version of the chicken
genome (GenBank). The gap at position 1789–1830 corresponds to exon
40 of the human Talin1/2 sequences and may represent an unsequenced
region of the chicken genome, or chicken Talin2 may lack this exon altogether. The insertion at position 12–13 shows that C. intestinalis talin is
orthologous to vertebrate Talin2. The I/LWEQ module begins at position
2345 of human Talin1 (ILEAAK). The alternative splice variants of C.
intestinalis Talin-a and Talin-b are shown in red. Sequence identity (*);
