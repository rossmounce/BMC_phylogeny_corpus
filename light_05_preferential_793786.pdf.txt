Abstract
Background: Many biological networks show some characteristics of scale-free networks. Scalefree networks can evolve through preferential attachment where new nodes are preferentially
attached to well connected nodes. In networks which have evolved through preferential
attachment older nodes should have a higher average connectivity than younger nodes. Here we
have investigated preferential attachment in the context of metabolic networks.
Results: The connectivities of the enzymes in the metabolic network of Escherichia coli were
determined and representatives for these enzymes were located in 11 eukaryotes, 17 archaea and
46 bacteria. E. coli enzymes which have representatives in eukaryotes have a higher average
connectivity while enzymes which are represented only in the prokaryotes, and especially the
enzymes only present in βγ-proteobacteria, have lower connectivities than expected by chance.
Interestingly, the enzymes which have been proposed as candidates for horizontal gene transfer
have a higher average connectivity than the other enzymes. Furthermore, It was found that new
edges are added to the highly connected enzymes at a faster rate than to enzymes with low
connectivities which is consistent with preferential attachment.
Conclusion: Here, we have found indications of preferential attachment in the metabolic network
of E. coli. A possible biological explanation for preferential attachment growth of metabolic
networks is that novel enzymes created through gene duplication maintain some of the compounds
involved in the original reaction, throughout its future evolution. In addition, we found that
enzymes which are candidates for horizontal gene transfer have a higher average connectivity than
other enzymes. This indicates that while new enzymes are attached preferentially to highly
connected enzymes, these highly connected enzymes have sometimes been introduced into the E.
coli genome by horizontal gene transfer. We speculate that E. coli has adjusted its metabolic
network to a changing environment by replacing the relatively central enzymes for better adapted
orthologs from other prokaryotic species.

Background
Recent studies indicate that metabolic networks evolve at
the local level through patchwork evolution and retrograde evolution [1-3]. Patchwork evolution, which is

likely to be more important, occurs when an enzyme
evolves from a broad spectrum enzyme to an enzyme with
a highly specialized activity [4]. Retrograde evolution is a
process where the depletion of a substrate from the envi-

Properties of scale-free networks and network representaProperties of scale-free networks and network representation. a) The figure shows a network where most
nodes have very low connectivities (k = 1) but two nodes
have connectivities which are far higher than the connectivity
of most nodes in the network (k = 12). Scale-free networks,
among other networks, have this general property. b) The
upper part of the figure shows a common network representation where the substrates and products of the reactions
represent the nodes in the network and the enzymes represent the edges. Our network representation is shown in the
lower part of the figure where the enzymes represent the
nodes in the network and the substrates and products represent the edges (reaction graph).

ronment leads to the evolution of an enzyme which can
accept a new substrate and catalyze the production of the
depleted substance [5].
Metabolic networks and other complex networks such as
the film actor collaboration network, the world wide web,
protein domain networks and protein-protein interaction
networks are small-world networks with some properties
which are consistent with scale-free networks [6-8]. The
small-worldness of the metabolic network of E. coli has
recently been contested for an alternative network representation where carbon atomic traces in metabolic reac-

tions were used [9]. A small-world network is
characterized by 1) short path lengths between any two
nodes in the network and 2) a high clustering coefficient,
which means that the neighbors of a certain node of the
network are often connected to each other thereby forming clusters. A scale-free network, in this context, has a
power-law connectivity (degree) distribution, i.e. there are
many nodes which have very low connectivities and a
handful of nodes with much higher connectivities (hubs),
see Figure 1a. Scale-free networks are robust networks in
the sense that they often remain intact when a large fraction of randomly chosen nodes is eliminated from the
network [10]. However, if a small fraction of the hubs of
the network is eliminated the network is likely to become
fragmented into several components. It has been suggested that the scale-free character of biological networks
has evolved through natural selection for the advantage of
robustness and error-tolerance that the scale-free network
topology confers to the organism [6]. A study by Gleiss et
al showed that chemical reaction networks, which clearly
have not been subjected to natural selection, also show
scale-free characteristics thereby showing that scale-free
networks can arise without natural selection and may be a
general feature of chemical reaction networks [11].
Networks with scale-free properties have been shown to
evolve when two simple rules are applied: 1) The network
grows by the addition of new nodes. 2) Preferential
attachment: New nodes are more likely to become connected to well connected nodes in the network [12].
While preferential attachment is often at the root of scalefreeness, a network with an power-law degree distribution
might be produced through other mechanisms. Preferential attachment in the context of genetic networks may
take place partly through gene duplication [13,14]. In
agreement with preferential attachment Eisenberg and
Levanon [15] showed that the proteins which have
homologs in all 3 domains of life, which are likely to be
of ancient origin, have higher connectivities in the protein-protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae. In contrast, Kunin et al [16] recently showed that the most highly
connected proteins date to after the evolution of primordial eukaryotes but before the radiation of eukaryotes to
Plants, Metazoa and Protista. Here, we investigate the evidence for preferential attachment and the role of horizontal gene transfer in the metabolic network evolution of E.
coli.

Results
Connectivity and phylogenetic group
If preferential attachment is an important mechanism in
the evolution of metabolic networks older enzymes
should have a higher average connectivity (k) than
younger enzymes. In order to investigate this prediction
we extracted the enzymes and the reactions in E. coli from

Page 2 of 11

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:159

the EcoCyc [17] and KEGG [18] databases. The network
representation of the metabolic network of E. coli was constructed using EcoCyc, see methods. The nodes in our
graph represent the enzymes (complete EC numbers) catalyzing the reactions and the edges represent one or more
compounds involved in the reactions. There is an edge
from enzyme El to enzyme E2 if El catalyzes a reaction
where compound A is produced and then E2 uses A as
substrate. There can be at most one edge in each direction
between the nodes in the graph. The connectivity of a
node is defined as the number of edges connecting the
node
to
other
nodes
in
the
network.
Enzymes (complete EC numbers) were collected from
KEGG orthology [18] and were found in 163 different
organisms (11 eukaryotes, 17 archaea and 135 bacteria).
Among these the E. coli enzymes with representatives in
74 organisms (11 eukaryotes, 17 archaea and 46 bacteria)
of reasonably well understood phylogenies were extracted
for further studies, see Figure 2. The enzymes were divided
into five age groups, see Table 1. The enzymes in group 1
are likely to be among the oldest since they have representatives in eukaryotes, archaea and bacteria. Group 2
contains the enzymes with representatives in eukaryotes
and bacteria but not in archaea while group 3 contains the
enzymes with representatives in archaea and bacteria but
not in eukaryotes. Group 4 contains E. coli enzymes without representatives in eukaryotes or archaea but with representatives in bacteria other than γβ-proteobacteria and
group 5 contains enzymes with representatives in γβ-proteobacteria only. Enzymes belonging to group 1–3 are
probably ancient enzymes since they exist in at least two
domains of life. Enzymes which are found in group 5 are
only found in bacteria which are comparatively close relatives of E. coli, in the γβ-proteobacteria group, see Figure
2, which indicates that they are relatively recent additions
to the metabolic repertory of E. coli. It is possible that
some of the enzymes in groups 1–3 could have evolved
relatively recently and subsequently been horizontally
transferred to the other domains of life but the evidence
of horizontal gene transfer between organisms belonging
to different domains of life is not abundant. Horizontal
gene transfer between bacterial species is believed to be
more common [19] and therefore there may be enzymes
in group 4 which have been transferred from γβ-proteobacteria. Gene loss, which is estimated to be three times
more common than horizontal gene transfer in prokaryotes [20], is probably a more important source of error in
this study since genes which serve an important function
in bacteria but not in archaea or eukaryotes may have
been lost in the archaeal and eukaryotic lineages and as a
consequence groups 4 and 5 may not exclusively contain
relatively recently evolved enzymes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/159

The average connectivities for the E. coli enzymes with representatives in the five groups were calculated, see Figure
3a. The enzymes which are represented in all 3 domains
of life (group 1) have the highest average connectivity
together with the enzymes which occur in bacteria and
eukaryotes (group 2) while the enzymes that occur only in
γβ-proteobacteria (group 5) have the lowest connectivities. The average connectivity was 40% higher for group 1
than for group 5 enzymes. In order to estimate the significance of the results 100 000 randomized networks were
generated through shuffling the group numbers while preserving the network topology. The Z-score, see methods,
of the enzymes that occur in eukaryotes is substantially
higher than the Z-score for the enzymes which only occur
in archaea and bacteria, see Figure 3b.
In a similar manner 147 other organisms were investigated. We collected the metabolic reactions for these
organisms from KEGG. It should be noted that these metabolic networks have not been investigated to the extent
of the E. coli metabolic network. Therefore, the connectivities of the enzymes and the results are probably not of the
same reliability. We found that the larger prokaryotic
genomes often have a particularly strong correlation
between connectivity and domain presence while the correlation in smaller prokaryotes and eukaryotes is weaker,
see Figure 4. Many of the smaller prokaryotes are obligate
intracellular parasites or symbionts. The genomes of obligate parasites and symbionts have been metabolically
reduced and many metabolic functions, such as the
amino acid metabolism, are frequently provided by the
host. Since enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism
are often ancient proteins with high connectivities, see
Figure 5a and 5b, the absence of genes coding for these
enzymes in the genomes of the obligate symbionts/parasites can account for the lack of correlation between connectivity and domain presence in smaller genomes.
In conclusion we found that E. coli enzymes which have
representatives in all domains of life, and in eukaryotes
but not archaea, have a higher average connectivity in the
metabolic network of E. coli than the presumably younger
enzymes which only have representatives in γβ-proteobacteria. This finding lends support for one of the predictions
of the mechanism of preferential attachment.
Connectivity and horizontal gene transfer
It has been suggested that the scale-free properties of biological networks may arise, at least partially, as a result of
preferential attachment of new nodes to highly connected
nodes through gene duplication [13,14]. Preferential
attachment by gene duplication may take place according
to the following scenario; Initially, the duplicated gene
has exactly the same function and position in the network
as the template gene. Since many genes are connected to

Page 3 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:159

the hub of the network, the duplicated gene is by chance
likely to be connected to the hub of the network. Subsequently, the duplicate gene may evolve towards another
functionality but it could retain some of its original function. For instance, a multi-domain protein could loose
one of its domains through deletion but retain the other
domains and possibly part of its original functionality. In
such a scenario the older proteins are more likely to be
highly connected than the younger proteins.
An alternative scenario is preferential attachment by horizontal gene transfer (HGT); A new, or alternative, enzyme
is introduced through HGT. The new enzyme is more
likely to be retained in the metabolic repertory if it confers
a new or improved function at a central, rather than
peripheral, position of the metabolism – such as if it is
connected to a highly connected enzyme or if it is itself
highly connected. This is a consideration which may be
particularly important in the metabolism of bacteria since
some bacteria are prone to delete dispensable genes from
their genomes [21]. Arguably, connectivity is a measure
which indicates the centrality and importance of an
enzyme in which case horizontally transferred genes
should frequently be highly connected or be connected to
highly connected enzymes. According to this scenario,
horizontally transferred enzymes would be preferentially
attached to highly connected enzymes and/or be preferentially replacing highly connected enzymes.
Although the extent of the evolutionary impact of HGT is
still under debate [22-24], it is generally accepted as an
important evolutionary process in microbial species [19].
Roughly 18% of the protein coding genes in E. coli are
likely to have been introduced into the E. coli genome by
HGT since the species diverged from the Salmonella lineage according to an analysis by Lawrence and Ochman
where base composition and codon usage patterns were
used to identify the horizontally transferred sequences
[25]. Using this data set we found that 85 of the 486 E. coli
enzymes used in this study are likely to be examples of
HGT (HGT enzymes). The average connectivity for the
HGT enzymes in the metabolic network of E. coli is 42.2
while the other enzymes (non-HGT enzymes) have an
average connectivity of 33.1. The most striking difference
between the connectivity distributions of the HGT
enzymes and the non-HGT enzymes is that only 15% of
the HGT enzymes have connectivities between 0–9 and
37% of the HGT enzymes have higher connectivities than
60 while 28% of the non-HGT enzymes have connectivities of 0–9 and 26% have connectivities higher than 60,
see Figure 6. These results indicate that horizontally transferred enzymes in the metabolic network of E. coli are
either introduced into the repertory of the organism as a
comparatively high connectivity enzyme or acquires
many connections during the evolution of the network.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/159

We classified the HGT enzymes into the five phylogenetic
groups and determined the average connectivities for each
group, see Figure 7 and Table 1. Only HGT enzymes
belonging to group 1 and 2 have higher connectivities
than the non-HGT enzymes belonging to the same group.
From Figure 7a it is clear that the high average connectivities of group 1 and 2 enzymes, which was seen in Figure
3a, is partly but not solely due to HGT enzymes. It should
be noted that the horizontal transfers of enzymes which
are specific for βγ-proteobacteria only (group 5) may be
underestimated since HGT events between closely related
species are hard to detect [24].
Most horizontally transferred genes go through the process of amelioration, the adjustment of the transferred
sequence to the base composition and codon usage of the
resident genome. Therefore, most detectable HGTs have
taken place relatively recently in the history of E. coli [25].
Consequently, we can conclude that while it is true that
the highly connected enzymes in the metabolic network
of E. coli are often old in the sense that they are enzymes
with representatives in eukaryotes, and which therefore
probably originated in the last common ancestor of
eukaryotes and bacteria, they are also overrepresented
among the enzymes which have been introduced recently
into the E. coli genome through HGT. These findings suggest that horizontally transferred genes are introduced and
retained preferentially at central positions of the metabolism of E. coli.
The connectivity of essential enzymes and isozymes
Jeong et al [26] showed that the highly connected proteins
in the protein-protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae
are more likely to be indispensable to the organism than
less well connected proteins. We wished to study if there
was a similar correlation in the metabolic network of E.
coli. We used the essentiality classification from the study
of Gerdes et al [27] of E. coli under aerobic growth in nutrition rich medium. We calculated the mean connectivity
for the essential and the dispensable enzymes respectively
and found that the essential enzymes do not show a
higher
connectivity
than
expected

( kessential = 29, knon−essential = 35 , for networks where 15
compounds have been removed). It is possible that the
relatively small size of the metabolic networks compared
to the protein-protein interaction network is the reason a
similar correlation could not be found in the metabolic
network of E. coli.
The hubs are the most important nodes for the integrity of
the network. If a fraction of the hubs are removed the network is likely to become fragmented into smaller components. Since these enzymes are very important for the

robustness of the network it might be suspected that the
EC numbers with the highest connectivities could have
more than one representatives in the genome, i.e. that
there are two or more isozymes representing these highly
connected nodes. Isozymes in multicellular organisms are
often active in different tissues while isozymes in single
cellular organisms frequently have different substrate specificities or are activated in different environments (such
as aerobic or anaerobic environments). We here designated a pair of enzymes as isozymes if they catalyze the
same reaction but are coded for by different genes, which
are not part of the same enzyme complex.
We used Expasy [28], SGD [29] and EcoCyc [17] to determine which enzymes in the metabolic networks of E. coli
and S. cerevisiae occur as isozymes. We found 77 EC numbers that were associated with isozymes in E. coli and 97
EC numbers that were associated with isozymes in S. cerevisiae, see additional files. The mean connectivities for
the isozymes and the non-isozymes were determined and
the result was compared to randomized networks. We
found that the isozymes do not have a noticeably higher
mean
connectivity
than
non-isozymes
( kisozyme = 37, knon−isozyme = 34 , for networks where 15
compounds have been removed). The result may indicate
that isozymes are not necessarily crucial for the integrity of
the metabolic network. In accordance with our result it
has recently been shown that the isozymes of S. cerevisiae
are not overrepresented among essential enzymes [30].
Connectivity and function
Kunin et al showed that the functional classes in the protein-protein network of S. cere-visiae display distinctly different connectivity levels [16]. In a similar manner we
investigated whether enzymes belonging to different functional groups are characterized by distinct connectivities.

We classified the enzymes into 7 functional classes
according to EcoCyc [17]; lipid metabolism, nucleotide

metabolism, amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism,
energy metabolism, other biosynthesis and other degradation and calculated the mean connectivities for the different functional classes, see Figure 5b and Table 2. The
mean connectivities for the enzymes involved in nucleotide, amino acid, other degradation and energy metabolism are higher than expected. The amino acid
metabolism and nucleotide metabolism enzymes are
clearly over represented in 3 domains of life while
enzymes involved in energy metabolism are slightly more
common in 3 domains of life than expected by chance.
Many of the pathways involved in energy metabolism,
such as the citric acid cycle and glycolysis, are believed to
be very old. However, there are substantial variations in
the energy metabolism between different species and
domains of life [31]. Therefore, the observation that
energy metabolism enzymes are not overrepresented in
three domains of life is not surprising.
Contrastingly, enzymes involved in lipid and sugar
metabolism are on average half as well connected as the
enzymes involved in nucleotide, amino acid and energy
metabolism. The group of enzymes involved in lipid
metabolism is less than half the size of the second smallest functional group and due to its small size the Z-score
for this functional group is less reliable than for the other
functional groups. The sugar metabolism enzymes are
clearly over represented among the enzymes that occur in
bacteria only, see Figure 5a, which was anticipated since
there are many bacterial specific enzymes involved in
sugar transportation [32].
Network growth through preferential attachment
According to the mechanism of preferential attachment
new enzymes in the network should be preferentially
attached to already well connected nodes. We do not have
access to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) that
existed before the 3 domains of life evolved. However, a
rough representation of the metabolic network of that
organism was created by extracting the enzymes that occur
in all domains of life. The connectivities of the enzymes in

the connectivity increase appears to be linear (r = 0.87)
following the equation f(x) = 2.6 + 0.41x, where x is the
connectivity in the ancient network. We can therefore conclude that the addition of new nodes to the metabolic network of E. coli occurs in a manner which is consistent with
preferential attachment.

that derived network were determined. We then calculated the number of enzyme nodes that have been added
to an enzyme by subtracting the connectivity of the
enzyme in the current E. coli network by the connectivity
of the enzyme in the ancient network. We found that the
enzymes which have higher connectivities in the ancient
network gain new connections at a higher rate than the
enzymes with lower connectivities, see Figure 8. The correlation between connectivity in the ancient network and

We have investigated two predictions generated from the
mechanism of preferential attachment in the evolution of
the metabolic network of E. coli. First, if preferential
attachment is of any significance in the evolution of the
metabolic network of E. coli, the older enzymes in the network should have a higher average connectivity. We have
found that E. coli enzymes which are represented in three
domains of life, and in eukaryotes but not archaea, have a
higher average connectivity than expected by chance. Second, another prediction generated from the hypothesis of
network evolution through preferential attachment is that
highly connected nodes should gain new edges at a faster
rate than nodes with low connectivities. To investigate
this prediction we extracted the enzymes with representatives in 3 domains of life and determined the network representing LUCA's metabolic network. In accordance with
the mechanism of preferential attachment we found a
positive linear correlation between connectivity in the
ancient network and number of connections gained
through evolution.
Further, we found that the E. coli enzymes which are
believed to have undergone horizontal gene transfer

teria such as E. coli are adjusting their metabolic networks
to a changing environment by replacing the relatively central enzymes, with high connectivities, for better adapted
orthologs from other prokaryotic species.

Conclusion

It is well known that many novel functions in organisms
are obtained through gene duplication, followed by subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. Therefore, a
possible biological explanation for the preferential attachment growth of metabolic networks, which we have now
found some support for, could be that novel enzymes,
which are created through gene duplication, maintain
some compounds involved in the reaction catalyzed by
the original enzyme throughout its future evolution. As a
supplementary explanation we propose that horizontally
transferred enzymes are introduced preferentially at central positions of the metabolic network of E. coli.

Databases and representation framework
We built a representation of the metabolic network of E.
coli by using EcoCyc [17] (downloaded in March 2004) to
gather the EC assigned enzymes and to determine the connectivities of the enzymes. An alternative network based
on KEGG was also produced and the study was performed
which generated similar results, results not shown. The
connectivity of an enzyme is defined as the number of
edges connecting the enzyme to other enzymes. Only one
edge in each direction between any two enzymes was

The phylogenetic distribution and connectivity of
enzymes in different functional classes. a) Function and
phylogenetic distribution. The E. coli enzymes were classified
into 7 functional classes (amino acid metabolism, energy
metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, sugar
metabolism, other biosynthesis and other degradation) and
divided into enzymes which are represented in 1, 2 or 3
domains of life. 100 000 randomized networks were generated for comparison and Z-score calculation. b) Connectivity
and function. The enzymes were divided into functional
classes and the Z-scores for the connectivities of each functional class were calculated for the network where the 15
most promiscuous compounds have been removed.
(HGT enzymes) have a higher average connectivity than
other enzymes (non-HGT enzymes). This is especially true
for the HGT enzymes with representatives in eukaryotes,
which is the most highly connected group of E. coli
enzymes. This result suggests that the highly connected
enzymes are often old in the sense that they are likely to
have originated in LUCA and been part of the bacterial
metabolic repertory for a long time. However, these
ancient enzymes are sometimes relatively recent additions
to the metabolic network of E. coli. It is possible that bac-

The nodes in our graph represent the enzymes (complete
EC numbers) catalyzing the reactions and the edges represent one or more compounds involved in the reactions.
There is an edge from enzyme El to enzyme E2 if El catalyzes a reaction where compound A is produced and then
E2 uses A as substrate. The network representation used in
our study has been used before for metabolic network
analysis where it has been referred to as 'protein-centric'
graphs [33] or 'reaction graphs' [7], see Figure 1b. Our representation of the full metabolic network of E. coli consists
of 486 nodes and 99 917 edges.

One problematic aspect with metabolic network analysis
is how promiscuous compounds, such as H2O, should be
handled. One may argue that the network would become
more biochemically meaningful if these compounds are
removed because the promiscuous compounds are usually not limiting factors of reactions [34]. In this study, we
have chosen to apply a simple network-based criterion.
We count the number of times a compound occurs as part
of an edge in the network. The most common compounds
were then considered as promiscuous compounds [2,3].
We performed our studies on different networks where up
to 40 compounds have been removed.
Statistical analysis
For the statistical analysis 100 000 randomized networks
were generated through shuffling the group numbers
while preserving the network topology. Subsequently, Zscores were calculated. The Z-score expresses how far the
average connectivity of the enzymes belonging to a certain
phylogenetic group differs from the average connectivity
of randomly sampled enzymes, measured in units of the
random sampling distribution's standard deviation. The
larger the Z-score, the less likely that the difference
between phylogenetic group's average and the random
group's average is by chance.
