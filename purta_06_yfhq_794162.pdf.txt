Abstract
Background: Naturally occurring tRNAs contain numerous modified nucleosides. They are
formed by enzymatic modification of the primary transcripts during the complex RNA maturation
process. In model organisms Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae most enzymes involved in
this process have been identified. Interestingly, it was found that tRNA methylation, one of the
most common modifications, can be introduced by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent
methyltransferases (MTases) that belong to two structurally and phylogenetically unrelated protein
superfamilies: RFM and SPOUT.
Results: As a part of a large-scale project aiming at characterization of a complete set of RNA
modification enzymes of model organisms, we have studied the Escherichia coli proteins YibK, LasT,
YfhQ, and YbeA for their ability to introduce the last unassigned methylations of ribose at positions
32 and 34 of the tRNA anticodon loop. We found that YfhQ catalyzes the AdoMet-dependent
formation of Cm32 or Um32 in tRNASer1 and tRNAGln2 and that an E. coli strain with a disrupted
yfhQ gene lacks the tRNA:Cm32/Um32 methyltransferase activity. Thus, we propose to rename
YfhQ as TrMet(Xm32) according to the recently proposed, uniform nomenclature for all RNA
modification enzymes, or TrmJ, according to the traditional nomenclature for bacterial tRNA
MTases.
Conclusion: Our results reveal that methylation at position 32 is carried out by completely
unrelated TrMet(Xm32) enzymes in eukaryota and prokaryota (RFM superfamily member Trm7
and SPOUT superfamily member TrmJ, respectively), mirroring the scenario observed in the case
of the m1G37 modification (introduced by the RFM member Trm5 in eukaryota and archaea, and
by the SPOUT member TrmD in bacteria).

Background

Results and discussion

All mature transfer RNAs (tRNA) molecules, from all
known living organisms, contain numerous modified
nucleosides at multiple positions [1]. Although other
RNA species also contain modified nucleosides, they are
less common than in tRNA, where over 80 modifications
have been found to occur at typically ~10%, but sometimes even at as many as 25% positions [2]. Recently,
owing to the availability of complete genome sequences,
there has been a remarkable progress in identification of
enzymes that introduce modifications in tRNAs of model
organisms Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(reviews: [3,4]). For instance, as a part of a large-scale
project, aiming at identification of the complete repertoire
of RNA methyltransferases (MTases) in E. coli by combination of bioinformatics and experimental analyses, we
have recently identified the so far "missing" enzymes that
introduce m7G46 [5] and mnm5s2U34 [6]. In E. coli the
only tRNA methylations, for which the corresponding
enzymes (and genes that encode them) remain unknown,
are those of the 2'-OH groups of ribose at positions 32
and 34 of the anticodon loop (Figure 1).

Preparation of the substrates and methyltransferase
candidates
Analysis of the tRNA sequences and modified nucleosides
in the MODOMICS database [17] revealed the presence of
2'-O-methylated uridine (Um) in position 32 of the anticodon loop in tRNAGln1 (UUG) and tRNAGln2 (CUG), and
2'-O-methylated cytidine (Cm) at the same position in
tRNAfMet1 (CAU), tRNAfMet2 (CAU), tRNASer1 (UGA), and
tRNATrp1 (CCA). On the other hand, the nucleoside in
position 34 was found to be 2'-O-methylated in tRNALeu4
(UAA) to 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-O-methyluridine (cmnm5Um), and in tRNALeu5 (CAA) to Cm. We
selected tRNASer1 and tRNAGln2 as representative substrates
for the methylation at position 32, while tRNALeu5 was
selected as a representative substrate for the methylation
at position 34. Transcripts were generated in vitro using
T7-RNA polymerase (see Methods).

Ribose methylation is one of the most common modifications. In E. coli it was found to be introduced at different
positions of different RNAs by site-specific enzymes, Sadenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent MTases that
belong to two structurally and phylogenetically unrelated
protein superfamilies: Rossmann-fold MTase (RFM) [7,8]
and SPOUT [9]. These superfamilies have been defined
based on sequence and structural comparisons (review:
[10]). The RFM superfamily can be exemplified by the 23S
rRNA:Um2552 MTase RrmJ (which is also able to methylate tRNA in vitro, albeit at an unspecified position)
[11,12], while the SPOUT superfamily can be exemplified
by the tRNA:Gm18 MTase TrmH [13,14].
Previously, we found that in S. cerevisiae methylations at
positions 32 and 34 are introduced by the Trm7 enzyme,
a close homolog of RrmJ and a member of the RFM superfamily [15]. However, apart from the rRNA MTase RrmJ,
there are no close homologs of Trm7 in E. coli that could
carry out the corresponding reactions in tRNAs [16],
which suggests that modifications at positions 32 and/or
34 in prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNAs could be carried
out by analogous, i.e. unrelated proteins. To test this
hypothesis, we assayed the so far functionally uncharacterized members of the SPOUT superfamily [9]: YibK,
LasT, YfhQ, and YbeA for their ability to exert methylation
of tRNA at positions 32 and/or 34.

Among the cloned open reading frames without experimentally assigned functions, we selected a set of putative
MTases identified as candidates for RNA modification
enzymes in earlier studies: YibK, LasT, YfhQ, and YbeA
[9,18]. All these proteins are members of the SPOUT
superfamily of MTases [9], which is characterized by the
presence of a deep topological knot [19,20]. The experimental analysis of these putative tRNA modification
enzymes in E. coli was greatly facilitated by the availability
of a complete set of cloned individual genes encoding Histagged proteins [21] and the corresponding knock-out
(K.O.) strains [22], which should lack the corresponding
MTase activities and hence, contain unmethylated substrates. Thus, on the one hand, total tRNA was extracted
from the yibK, lasT, yfhQ, and ybeA K.O. strains. On the
other hand, we have expressed and purified His-tagged
YibK, LasT, YfhQ, and YbeA proteins. Here, data is shown
in detail only for YfhQ, as it was the only MTase candidate, for which we were able to demonstrate the tRNA
MTase activity using the selected substrates. SDS-PAGE
analysis of the fractions containing YfhQ in the presence
of 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol showed one band corresponding to approximately 30 kDa (Figure 2), in agreement with the theoretical value calculated for the YfhQ
monomer (29.168 kDa). The immunoblot analysis using
anti-His tag antibodies confirmed the presence of a Histagged protein in the 30 kDa band (data not shown).
Interestingly, SDS-PAGE analysis in the lower concentration of β-mercaptoethanol (e.g. 5%) revealed an additional band of approximately 60 kDa, suggesting the
existence of a very strong dimer. It was verified by Western
blot analysis as containing the His6 protein (data not
shown), this suggesting that it is indeed the dimeric form
of the 30 kDa protein. Gel filtration chromatography
revealed that the apparent molecular mass of the native
form of the YfhQ protein is about 58 kDa (Figure 3). Thus,

we conclude that YfhQ exists as a strong dimer, similarly
to its homologs from the SPOUT superfamily with known
structures (e.g. YibK [23]). The results of SDS-PAGE and
gel filtration analyses for YibK, LasT, and YbeA were qualitatively similar, e.g. their molecular mass agreed with the
theoretical values expected for monomers and dimers
(data not shown).

yfhQ encodes a MTase responsible for the formation of
Cm/Um 32 in the anticodon loop of tRNA
In order to test whether YfhQ, YibK, LasT, or YbeA could
methylate the U or C nucleosides in positions 32 or C in
position 34 of the anticodon loop, we incubated the purified proteins with AdoMet and with in vitro transcribed
tRNAs: [α-32P]CTP-labelled tRNASer1, [α-32P]UTP-labelled

chromatography (2D-TLC) followed by autoradiography.
The results shown in Figure 4 demonstrate that YfhQ is
able to introduce Cm in the in vitro transcribed tRNASer1
and Um in the in vitro transcribed tRNAGln2. We were unable to detect the MTase activity of YibK, LasT, or YbeA on
any of these substrates (data not shown), therefore they
were not analyzed further.
In order to further confirm that YfhQ is responsible for
methylation at position 32, a similar experiment was performed using [α-32P]UTP-labelled tRNASer1. After incubation in the presence of AdoMet and purified YfhQ, the
tRNA was hydrolyzed by ribonuclease (RNase) T2, which
cleaves the phosphodiester bonds to generate 3'-monophosphate nucleosides but does not cut the phosphodiester bond between a 2'-O-methylated nucleoside and the
3'-adjacent nucleoside, leaving 2'-O-methylated dinucleotides. The analysis of cleavage products revealed the presence of radioactively labelled CmUp (Figure 5),
demonstrating that YfhQ methylates a C nucleoside 5'adjacent to a U. A similar experiment performed using [α32P]UTP-labelled tRNAGln2 revealed the formation of radioactively labelled UmUp (Figure 5). These results are perfectly consistent with the expected 2'-O-methylation at
position 32 (followed by U both in tRNASer1 and
tRNAGln2).
We confirmed the localization of the 2'-O-methyl group
by an independent approach. [α-32P]UTP-labelled
tRNASer1 was modified using purified YfhQ and then
cleaved by RNAse T1. The resulting oligonucleotides (8, 6,
5 and 4-nt long fragments) were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and revealed by autoradiography. The oligonucleotides were eluted from gel and cleaved with
RNAse T2. The TLC analysis of cleavage products revealed
the presence of radioactively labelled CmUp (Figure 6)
derived from a 5-nt fragment, demonstrating that YfhQ
methylates a C nucleoside 5'-adjacent to a U nucleoside in
a given nucleotide context, encompassing position 32.

tRNAGln2, and [α-32P]CTP-labelled tRNALeu5. Combinations of every protein with every tRNA substrate were
tested. After incubation, the tRNA was hydrolyzed using
nuclease P1 and the resulting 5'-phosphate nucleosides
were analyzed by two-dimensional cellulose thin layer

To determine whether the Cm32/Um32 MTase activity
was affected in the yfhQ K.O. strain, cell extracts of E. coli
MC1061 and of yfhQ K.O. strains were incubated with
AdoMet and [α-32P]CTP-labelled in vitro transcribed
tRNASer1 or [α-32P]UTP-labelled tRNAGln2. After incubation, tRNA was hydrolyzed by nuclease P1 and the nucleotides were analyzed by 2D-TLC and autoradiography.
The results shown in Figure 7 revealed the absence of Cm/
Um formation in yfhQ K.O. extract. This result was complemented by transforming the yfhQ K.O. strain with a
plasmid carrying the yfhQ gene, purifying the YfhQ protein from that strain, as described in the Methods section,
and testing it for the MTase activity (Figure 8). The
observed activity allows us to conclude that YfhQ is essential for the Cm32/Um32 methylation.

peak at 16 ml corresponds to a dimeric form of YfhQ.
We also found that total (crude) tRNA extracted from the
wild-type strain MC1061 was not a substrate for the purified YfhQ enzyme, while tRNA from the yfhQ K.O. strain
was an excellent substrate for this enzyme. The purified
YfhQ protein was incubated with 14C-radiolabelled
AdoMet ([methyl-14C]AdoMet) and total tRNA extracted
either from the wild type strain MC1061 (supposedly
fully methylated) or from the yfhQ_K.O. strain (supposedly unmethylated in the position specific for the YfhQ
MTase). After incubation, the tRNA was hydrolyzed by
nuclease P1 and the resulting nucleotides were analyzed
by 2D-TLC and autoradiography. As expected, the result
shown in Figure 9 revealed the formation of a radioactive
compound with migration characteristic for Cm only in
the case of tRNA from the yfhQ K.O. strain, but not in the
case of the fully modified tRNA. This suggests that in E.
coli YfhQ is the only MTase responsible for the formation
of Cm32 in tRNA. Curiously, no Um was detected in this
last experiment. The cause could be that tRNAs that normally contain Um32 are much less abundant than tRNAs
containing Cm32. However, the possibility that another
MTase can also form Um32 cannot be totally excluded. In
accordance with the recently proposed, uniform nomenclature for RNA modification enzymes [17] we suggest to
rename YfhQ as TrMet(Xm32). Alternatively, according to
the traditional nomenclature for bacterial tRNA MTases, it
could be named TrmJ.
Sequence analysis and modeling of YfhQ reveals a
conserved active site common to ribose 2'-O-MTases from
the SPOUT superfamily and underscores the convergent
evolution with the RFM superfamily
YfhQ was previously reported to belong to the SPOUT
superfamily of MTases [9], although at that time no structural information was available for any of these proteins
to guide the identification of the active site. Only recently,
a number of SPOUT structures were solved, providing

templates for homology modeling of other members. We
carried out the protein fold-recognition analysis for the
YfhQ sequence using the GeneSilico meta-server [24] to
predict its structure. We found, as expected, that the structures of SPOUT superfamily members were identified as
the only compatible templates for YfhQ, with genuine
ribose MTases RlmB [19], TrmH [14], and AviRb [25], as
well as putative MTases RrmA [20] and YibK [23] reported
with highest scores (Figure 10). We constructed a homology model of YfhQ using the "FRankenstein Monster's
approach" [26,27]. Comparison of the model with the
templates (Figure 11) reveals the common "knotted"
structure of the AdoMet-binding site and conservation of
the residues demonstrated to be involved in catalysis in
TrmH [28]. This suggests that tRNA MTases TrmH and
YfhQ use a very similar mechanism for methylation of
ribose in different positions, 18 and 32, respectively. The
same active site is also conserved in YibK, which we found
not to methylate tRNA and which we predict to be
involved in modification of one (or more) of the "unassigned" ribose methylations in rRNA [29]. We predict that
the tRNA-binding activity and substrate specificity of
YfhQ is at least in part dependent on the presence of the
C-terminal extension, which is absent from other members of this family (e.g. no extensions in YibK) or replaced
by different domains or extensions implicated in RNAbinding (e.g. additional helices at N- and C-termini
present in TrmH or the N-terminal domain in RlmB and
AviRb).
The statistical significance of sequence conservation
between YfhQ and previously characterized SPOUT
MTases of known structure (expectation value 3*10-16 in
the 2nd iteration of PSI-BLAST [30]) practically guarantees
that their structures are very similar. Experimental support
for this prediction is obtained from the Circular Dichroim
(CD) analysis (Figure 12, see Methods for details), which

resulting nucleotides were analyzed as described [38]. This
image shows the TLC analysis for a 5-nucleotide long fragment (nucleotides 31–35).

reveals that the secondary structure content of YfhQ
(approximately 43% of helices and 23% of strands) is
similar to the prediction reported here, taking into
account the helical structure of the unmodeled C-terminal
region. These values are also comparable to the secondary
structure observed in the crystal structure of a bona fide
SPOUT member YibK and our measurements of CD spectra carried out for YibK (data not shown).

Conclusion
Our results reveal that methylation at position 32 in the
anticodon loop of bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs is carried out by completely unrelated enzymes: a SPOUT
superfamily member YfhQ and RFM superfamily member
Trm7. This scenario is strikingly similar to the one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/7/23

observed in the case of m1G37 modification, which is carried out by the SPOUT superfamily member TrmD in bacteria and by the RFM superfamily member Trm5 in
eukaryota and archaea [31,32]. On the other hand, methylation of ribose at position 18 is carried out by members
of the SPOUT superfamily both in prokaryota and eukaryota: TrmH [13], and Trm3 [33], respectively, while the N1methylation of adenosine A58 (not observed in E. coli, but
e.g. in Thermus thermophilus) is catalyzed by members of
the RFM superfamily [34,35]. It is unclear which of these
two MTase superfamilies was more ancient and how they
replaced each other for the methylation of different positions in tRNAs from different phylogenetic lineages.
Among the four members of the SPOUT superfamily studied in this work (YfhQ, YibK, LasT, and YbeA) we were
unable to identify the MTase specific for the position 34
in E. coli tRNAs. It remains to be determined if this last
missing tRNA MTase is present among the remaining, so
far uncharacterized members of SPOUT and RFM superfamilies [8,9] and whether it uses a known active site or
invented a new one for the same reaction. Definitely,
more work is needed to elucidate the complicated pathways of evolution of RNA modification systems in all
Domains of Life.

Methods
Preparation of the substrates
Plasmids containing the yfhQ, yibK, lasT, and ybeA genes
inserted into the pCA24N vector and the corresponding E.
coli K.O. strains were constructed as described earlier
[21,22]. pBlueScript II KS (+) (Stratagene) has been modified by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce BpiI and
Mph1103I cloning sites in pBlueScript II KS (+)
polylinker, resulting in pKS_RNA vector. The serT and leuZ
genes, encoding tRNASer1 and tRNALeu5 respectively, were
PCR-amplified from the E. coli genomic DNA using primers 5'-GCATGCATTGGCGGAAGCGCAGAGATTCGAAC3' and 5'-GAAGACCCTATAGG AAGTGTGGCCGAGCGGTTG-3' for serT and 5'-TAATGCATGGTACCCGGAG
CGGGAC-3' and 5'-AGACCCTATAGCCCGGATGGTGGAATCGGTAG-3' for leuZ. The final PCR product was
cloned into the pKS_RNA vector, generating plasmids
pKS_SerT and pKS_LeuZ. Transcripts were generated in
vitro using T7-RNA polymerase and Mph1103I-cleaved
pKS_SerT or pKS_LeuZ plasmids as templates. The
tRNAGln2 transcript was generated exactly as described in
[36]. Full-length transcripts were purified by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Expression and purification of the YfhQ, YibK, LasT, and
YbeA recombinant proteins
Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3).
Transformed cells were grown at 37°C in Luria broth
(supplemented with chloramphenicol at 30 µg/mL) to an
optical density at 660 nm (OD660) of 0.7. At this stage,

duplicate in a dot-blot manifold (Scie-Plast) using a DE-81 cellulose filter. The filter was washed three times with 200 µl of
the reaction buffer and one time with 70% EtOH, dried and
exposed to the PhosphorImager screen. The resulting image
was scanned on the Storm 820 PhosphorImager.

IPTG (isopropylthiogalactopyranoside) was added up to a
final concentration of 1 mM to induce recombinant protein expression. Cells were harvested after 3 hours incubation at 37°C and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol) and lysed by
sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation
(20,000 × g during 10 min) and was applied to a column
of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech)
charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with buffer A
supplemented with 5 mM imidazole and the adsorbed
material was eluted with a linear gradient (0.05 M up to
0.4 M) of imidazole. Eluted fractions were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE in the presence of 5–7.5% β-mercaptoethanol.
In the higher concentration of β-mercaptoethanol only
the monomeric form was observed (Figure 2), while the
lower concentrations allowed to observe both the monomeric and dimeric forms. YfhQ was further purified by gel
filtration chromatography. The partially purified enzyme
was applied on a Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol).
Circular Dichroism analysis
CD spectra were collected on the Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with a temperature controller. The concentration
of YfhQ protein was 5 µM and YibK protein 6.6 µM. Scans
were collected at 20°C from 200 to 260, in 1 nm steps,
using a 1 mm pathlength cuvette. Secondary structure
content was estimated from CD spectrum using the
CDpro software [37].

YfhQ protein, and 10 µM [14C-methyl]AdoMet (53 mCi/
