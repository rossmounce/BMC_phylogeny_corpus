Abstract
Background: Cyanobacteria are recognized as the primordial organisms to grace the earth with molecular oxygen
~3.5 billion years ago as a result of their oxygenic photosynthesis. This laid a selection pressure for the evolution of
antioxidative defense mechanisms to alleviate the toxic effect of active oxygen species (AOS) in cyanobacteria.
Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are metalloenzymes that are the first arsenal in defense mechanism against oxidative
stress followed by an array of antioxidative system. Unlike other living organisms, cyanobacteria possess multiple
isoforms of SOD. Hence, an attempt was made to demonstrate the oxidative stress tolerance ability of marine
cyanobacterium, Leptolyngbya valderiana BDU 20041 and to PCR amplify and sequence the SOD gene, the central
enzyme for alleviating stress.
Result: L. valderiana BDU 20041, a filamentous, non-heterocystous marine cyanobacterium showed tolerance to the
tested dye (C.I. Acid Black 1) which is evident by increased in biomass (i.e.) chlorophyll a. The other noticeable change
was the total ROS production by culture dosed with dye compared to the control cultures. This prolonged incubation
showed sustenance, implying that cyanobacteria maintain their antioxidant levels. The third significant feature was a
two-fold increase in SOD activity of dye treated L. valderiana BDU20041 suggesting the role of SOD in alleviating
oxidative stress via Asada-Halliwell pathway. Hence, the organism was PCR amplified for SOD gene resulting in an
amplicon of 550 bp. The sequence analysis illustrated the presence of first three residues involved in motif; active site
residues at H4, 58 and D141 along with highly conserved Mn specific residues. The isolated gene shared 63.8%
homology with MnSOD of bacteria confirmed it as Mn isoform. This is the hitherto report on SOD gene from marine
cyanobacterium, L. valderiana BDU20041 of Indian subcontinent.
Conclusion: Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) coupled with induction of SOD by marine cyanobacterium,
L. valderiana BDU20041 was responsible for alleviating stress caused by an azo dye, C. I. Acid Black 1. The partial SOD
gene has been sequenced and based on the active site, motif and metal specific residues; it has been identified as Mn
metalloform.

known as oxygenic or plant-type photosynthesis [1]. This
marked the turning point in the evolution of earth, opening up the era for aerobes. For the survival of cyanobacteria with oxygenic photosynthesis, the selection pressure
led to the evolution of SODs [2-7]. Cyanobacteria are well
documented for its ability to maintain the antioxidant
levels by releasing H2O2 into the environment [2-5]. The
prime armory for the release of H2O2 is superoxide dismutases. The first implication on the protective role of

cyanobacterial SOD in photo-oxidative damage was
shown in Anacystis nidulans [6].
SODs are generally classified according to their metal
species which acts as redox-active center to catalyze the
dismutation reaction O2- + 2H+ T O2 + H2O2. Cu/ZnSOD
type consists of Cu(II) and Zn(II) at the active site,
MnSOD has Mn(III), the third FeSOD possess Fe(III),
and a fourth NiSOD contains Ni(II/III). Generally SODs
are localization specific. MnSOD is found in the cytosol
and thylakoid membrane, whereas Fe and NiSOD in the
cytosol and Cu/Zn is periplasmic in location but
cyanobacteria have multiple forms of each type encoded
by more than one gene [7]. The existence of multiple
SODs may result from the fact that the cells of cyanobacteria are divided into compartments by internal membranes [8]. Since O2- ions are negatively charged and
cannot cross the phospholipids bilayer readily, they are
efficiently trapped within the compartment where they
are generated. This may have been selected for the evolution of multiple SODs in compartmentalized cells [9].
Different levels of expressions in terms of SOD isoenzymes resulted in response to oxidative stress caused by
various abiotic factors such as, pesticides [10], lignin and
its model dye [11] and nutrient limitation [12] particularly of Fe/MnSOD. In addition, our hitherto reports on
marine cyanobacterium, Leptolyngbya valderiana BDU
20041 on exposure to synthetic dye has shown that the
organism decolourized Acid black1, C.I. 20470 (100 mG
L-1) to 85.6% in 12 days [13,14]. The active moiety
involved in decolourization was adjudged to be AOS,
mainly H2O2 (40 μM of H2O2 mG-1 Chl h-1) which is
excreted by the organism into the milieu [14]. The SOD
activity was found to be induced by two-fold in the presence of dye suggesting a significant role in the production
of H2O2 [14].
In the present study, we proposed to analyze the role of
SOD in L. valderiana BDU 20041 during oxidative stress
at the molecular level in order to more precisely identify
its isoform. Hence, an attempt was made to PCR amplify,
sequence and identify the metalloform of the SOD from
the marine cyanobacterium, L. valderiana BDU20041 of
Indian subcontinent.

Results and Discussions
ROS are repeatedly reported to be the inevitable by-products of biological redox reaction and normal metabolism
in humans, animals, plants and algae [15]. Cyanobacteria
are oxygenic photosynthetic organisms that are prone to
the oxidative stress due to the facts that they contain an
array of photosynthetic pigments and that they both produce oxygen during photosynthesis and consume oxygen
during respiration. It has been estimated that 1% of O2

Page 2 of 10

consumed by cells is diverted to produce ROS in various
subcellular loci [16].
The increased production of ROS and the resultant oxidative stress are considered to be the initial event and act
as an alert signal for the organisms under several environmental stresses, such as light, temperature and UV. Inevitably, ROS also react with biologically important
molecules such as lipids, proteins and DNA, inducing
oxidative damage in membranes and the photosynthetic
apparatus, which probably results in the death of cells
[15]. Here we focus on synthetic dye induced oxidative
stress and oxidative damage in cyanobacteria.
In the present study, the dye dosed stress response of L.
valderiana BDU20041 was tested in nitrogen free ASN
III medium for a stipulated period of 12 days. The
response to stress was determined by the organism's
decolourizing efficiency which varied among the duration tested (Figure 1). This shows that decolourization
was only due to the metabolic activity of the organisms
and not an abiotic factor. The results compliance with the
decolourization studies by cyanobacteria [17,18].
Earlier reports deciphers that oxidative stress induces
formation of ROS by multiple pathways [15,19]. Firstly,
the photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls and
phycobilins in cyanobacteria that act as photosensitizers
(PS) under stress [15]. It is noteworthy that the energy of
excited chlorophylls or phycobilins is utilized efficiently
for photosynthesis under normal growth conditions.
However, the inhibition of photosynthesis or the electron
transport chain under stress may elevate the photosensitization process as well as the formation of ROS in this
way.
Secondly, the essential role of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in the life of cyanobacteria promotes
the possibility of subjection to oxidative stress. The probable electron transfer from the electron transport chain,
especially in photosystem I (PSI), to molecular oxygen,

Priya et al. Saline Systems 2010, 6:6
http://www.salinesystems.org/content/6/1/6

the way to quench extensive excitation energy, is an alternative source of ROS. Photoreduction of molecular oxygen by the primary electron acceptor in the PSI complex
is thought to be the main source of superoxide in illuminated cells [19].
Hence in the present study, experiments were carried
out to evaluate the above phenomena as a response of L.
valderiana BDU20041 to oxidative stress caused by C.I.
Acid Black 1.
First, dye treated L. valderiana BDU20041 showed
increase in chlorophyll a proportional to the rate of
decolourization (Figure 2) which suggests that dye hinders the availability of light for the photosynthetic
machinery. In addition, there was a slight variation in the
phycobilins of dye untreated and treated L. valderiana
BDU20041 at the end of 12 days (Figure 3). These
changes in chlorophyll and phycobilins during decolourization corroborate with the first phenomena mentioned
above on the organism's potential to strive against oxidative stress caused by C.I. Acid Black 1.
The second notable feature is the total ROS produced
in stress response which is represented as 2', 7'- Dichorofluorescein (DCF) with relative fluorescence intensity at
520 nm. Generally, ROS levels increase in response to abiotic stress [20]. Decreased levels of ROS initially in the 3rd
h with L. valderiana BDU20041 dosed with dye may be
due to its involvement in degradation whereas, within 24
h, the organism increases the rate of ROS production and
showed sustenance (Figure 4).
The initial decrease in total ROS in dye dosed culture
could be attributed to two reasons (i) role of ROS in dye
decolourization [21-23] (ii) the free radical generated
passes through the Asada-Halliwell pathway initiated by
SOD that converts the highly reactive oxy-radicals
through an array of reaction to less toxic forms [19,24].
Further, the sustenance of ROS clearly depicts the stress
response in L. valderiana BDU20041 as cyanobacteria

valderiana BDU20041 in ASN III nitrogen free medium.

maintain their antioxidants level by release of reactive
oxygen species into the milieu [5,24]. Studies with
eukaryotic and bacterial systems showed that, low levels
of AOS are indispensable to act in cellular signaling and
in the control of gene expression [25]. Because of the dual
functions of ROS, a tight control of their concentrations
may be anticipated, which requires a delicate balance of
systems involved in their generation and destruction [26].
Hence, the third significant trait studied was the
response of SOD enzyme to oxidative stress (in this case,
C.I. Acid Black 1). SOD activity was found to increase in
the 3rd h and on further exposure to dye, the activity
increased two-fold and got sustained thereafter (Figure
5). This obviously proves that SOD plays a significant role
in alleviating oxidative stress in L. valderiana BDU20041.
As the initial oxy-radical product to be formed under
any oxidative stress is the superoxide radical (O2-.) which

upon further reaction within the cell can generate more
ROS such as hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen. Superoxide dismutases are metalloenzymes that dismutase
these superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxides. Their
activity increases on exposure to oxidative stress [16].
Hence, they can be depicted as the central dogma of antioxidative system. Hence, in our study attempts was made
to isolate and characterize the SOD gene involved in
abating oxidative stress caused by C.I. Acid Black 1.
The SOD gene from the DNA isolated of marine
cyanobacterium, L. valderiana BDU20041 was amplified
using the below mentioned primers. Electrophoresis of
the amplified products of gradient PCR (61°C) showed a
band of 550 bp and none in negative control (Figure 6).
The nucleotide sequence of the partial SOD gene of 432
bp was submitted to GenBank database (AY974247) and
their deduced aminoacid was 144 residues (AAX84682)
(Figure 7). The computational analysis on the sequenced
partial SOD gene comprised of an N-terminal and a Cterminal region from 1 to 63 and 70 to 143 residues
respectively with a theoretical molecular weight of 15.5
KDa.
When the obtained sequence was aligned within
cyanobacterial SOD, MnSOD of Thermosynechococcus
elongates BP1 (BAC07589) and Leptolyngbya boryana
(P50058) had maximum homology of 47%. The least
homology of 43% was shared with Leptolyngbya boryana
(P50056). The homology difference could be attributable
to partial SOD gene, in particular C-terminal region
where most of the aminoacids are highly conserved residues along with motif region (DVWEHAYY).
Further, the isolated sequence on analysis (Figure 8)
showed the presence of first 3 residues of SOD motif
region DVWEHAYY (D281-W223) along with conserved
residues-glycine (G53), histidine (H55), phenylalanine
(F61), serine (S105), tryptophan (W108), leucine (L109), arginine (N125) and glutamine (Q126). These highly conserved

residues were found to be precise for cyanobacterial
MnSOD as described by Priya et al [7].
All living systems have only one of each type of SOD in
the various cellular compartments indicating that they
have far more complex antioxidant defenses than other
organisms. As per the findings of Parker and Blake [27],
Jackson and Copper [28] and Priya et al [7] our analysis of
gene sequence of L. valderiana BDU20041 shows that the

Erlenmeyer flasks containing artificial sea water (ASN
III) medium [29] at 25 ± 2°C for a week.

residues histidine (H4, H58) and aspartate (D141) plays a
role in active sites (Figure 8, 9). In addition, the presence
of important metal specific residues viz., glycine (G54),
isoleucine (I81), glycine (G106), tryptophan (W107) and
proline (P129) concludes that the metalloform isolated
from L. valderiana BDU20041 is that of Mn (Figure 8, 9).
The elucidated structure possesses 6 helices and 3
sheets (Figure 10). Homology modeling with MnSOD of
L. valderiana BDU 20041 showed a similarity of 63.76%
with Bacillus anthracis (1XUQ) and 60.98% with
Deinococcus radiodurans (1Y67) (Figure 11). The RMSD
value of superposed structure shows that the alpha carbons are at 0.88A and backbone carbon is at 0.85. This
further substantiates that the isolated SOD gene is
MnSOD with its co-coordinating residues at position
His4, His58 and Asp141 (Figure 9).
The radial neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis of all
cyanobacterial SODs from public database (NCBI/DDBJ/
EMBL) showed four distinct metalloforms viz., Mn, Fe,
Cu/Zn and NiSODs. The SOD gene from L. valderiana
BDU 20041 is found to be grouped with MnSODs (Figure
12).
The identified MnSOD indicates that it is one of the
most probable means through which marine cyanobacterium, L. valderiana BDU20041 alleviates oxidative stress
caused by abiotic factors (C.I. Acid Black 1).

Materials and methods
Azo Dye

The diazo dye, Acid Black 1 (C.I. 20470, Aldrich) was
used in the study. Stock solution was prepared by dissolving dye in deionized water and sterilized by membrane
filtration (0.2 μM) Millipore.
Cyanobacterial strain

Axenic culture of Leptolyngbya valderiana BDU20041
from the germplasm of National Facility for Marine
Cyanobacteria (NFMC), Tiruchrappalli, Tamil Nadu, was
utilized in this study. The cells were grown photoauto-

The medium ASN III [29] was modified as either ASN III
nitrogen free medium (without NaNO3) or nitrogen limited medium (with a low concentration of 5 mG L-1
NaNO3). The organism was grown in ASN III medium
for 5 days initially and then in ASN III N limited medium
for 5 days at 27 ± 2°C at 20 μmol photon m2 s-1 light intensity, unless otherwise stated. Mid-log cultures were centrifuged; the harvested cells were washed with nitrogen
free medium and resuspended in the same medium. This
was used as inoculum for all the experiments; the results
are presented as means of triplicates.
Decolourization assay

The decolourization studies were performed by inoculating an equal volume of cultures (500 μL, based on chlorophyll content) to test tubes with 4.5 mL nitrogen free
ASNIII medium containing filter sterilized dye, C.I. Acid
Black 1 to a final concentration of 0.01%. The cultures
were incubated for a stipulated period of 12 days in the
above said conditions. Respective abiotic (medium with
0.01% dye only) and biotic (medium with organism only)
controls were also maintained in similar conditions as
mentioned above.
Culture was harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 g for
10 min on day 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12. The absorption spectrum
of the clear supernatant from 400 to 700 nm was recorded
using a spectrophotometer (JASCO V-550 UV-Visible
spectrophotometer, Japan). The percentage of decolourization was calculated as follows
100× A − B

where, A = initial absorbance at zero hour, B = final
absorbance.

Preparation of enzyme extract

Cyanobacterial culture was pelleted by centrifugation at
10,000 × g for 10 min and was washed with ice-cold 25
mM Tris-Cl, pH7.0 and homogenized with the same buffer using Braun sonicator (Labsonic 2000 UB), Germany
on an ice bath. Crude lysate was clarified several times by
centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The clear
supernatant obtained served as crude intracellular
enzyme source.

In vivo detection of ROS using DCFH-DA

The production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) that
includes both active oxygen and nitrogen species was
detected by using 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate

(DCFH-DA) in dye (C.I Acid Black 1, 100 mG L-1) treated
cultures at 3, 24 and 48 hr following He and Hader [14].
DCFH-DA cannot be added or incubated prior to dye
treatment due to rapid autooxidation of DCFH-DA or
hydrolysed 2, 7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) by
exposure to light [15]. Therefore, DCFH-DA (final concentration 5 μM from stock solution of 2 mM) was imme-

shaker at room temperature in dark at 27 ± 2°C for 1 h.
The fluorescence of the samples was measured with a
spectroflurometer (JASCO V550 spectroflurometer,
Japan) at room temperature, with excitation wavelength
of 485 nm and emission wavelengths at 520 nm to determine the relative ROS production. The results were corrected by subtracting the fluorescence of dye untreated
control samples.
DNA isolation

For genomic DNA isolation, actively growing cells were
harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min), washed
twice with sterile double distilled water followed by a
final wash with TE buffer (10 mM Tris: 1 mM EDTA, pH
8.0). Total genomic DNA was extracted using the xantho-

PCR amplification and cloning of amplified gene

Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to two separate
conserved regions were designed based on the published
nucleotide sequence of cyanobacterial Fe/MnSOD and
used for PCR amplification of DNA fragment coding for
partial SOD gene. The sequence of the primers were 5'CAC C(C/A)T TGC C(C/T)T A(C/T)G-3' and 5'-GAG
GTA GTA AGC (G/A)TG TTC CCA-3'. The PCR reaction was performed using Mastermix (Eppendorf, Germany) containing 1 U Taq DNA polymerase, 0.10 μM of
each primer, and 50 nG of template DNA in a 25.0 μL
reaction mixture using a Master gradient thermal cycler
(Eppendorf, Germany). The cycling profile included an
initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 minutes followed by 29
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 53°C for 1 min (gradient, G =
10°C), 72°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72°C for 6
minutes. Sterile water replaced DNA for the control. Five
microliters of the amplified products were subjected to
1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium
bromide (2.25 mg ml-1 distilled water) in 1× TAE (40 mM
Tris-acetate: 1 mM EDTA), visualized with a UV transilluminator and documented using CCD camera (Alpha

amplified product were obtained with an ABI 310 automated sequencer using the chain-termination method
with big-dye terminators (Applied Biosystems, Foster,

were checked by manual inspection of the electropherograms of both forward and reverse sequences. The base
call conflicts were resolved by aligning and comparing
both strands using SeqScape® software v 2.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA).
