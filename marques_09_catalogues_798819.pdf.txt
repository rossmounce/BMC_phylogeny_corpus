<p>A comparative evolutionary analysis of two mouse long noncoding RNA libraries reveals a much larger pool of noncoding RNAs
Mammalianto be noncoding RNAs
remains yet long discovered.</p>

Abstract
Background: Despite increasing interest in the noncoding fraction of transcriptomes, the number,
species-conservation and functions, if any, of many non-protein-coding transcripts remain to be
discovered. Two extensive long intergenic noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcript catalogues are now
available for mouse: over 3,000 macroRNAs identified by cDNA sequencing, and 1,600 long
intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) intervals that are predicted from chromatin-state maps.
Previously we showed that macroRNAs tend to be more highly conserved than putatively neutral
sequence, although only 5% of bases are predicted as constrained. By contrast, over a thousand
lincRNAs were reported as being highly conserved. This apparent difference may account for the
surprisingly small fraction (11%) of transcripts that are represented in both catalogues. Here we
sought to resolve the reported discrepancy between the evolutionary rates for these two sets.
Results: Our analyses reveal lincRNA and macroRNA exon sequences to be subject to the same
relatively low degree of sequence constraint. Nonetheless, our observations are consistent with
the functionality of a fraction of ncRNA in these sets, with up to a quarter of ncRNA exons having
evolved significantly slower than neighboring neutral sequence. The more tissue-specific
macroRNAs are enriched in predicted RNA secondary structures and thus may often act in trans,
whereas the more highly and broadly expressed lincRNAs appear more likely to act in the cisregulation of adjacent transcription factor genes.
Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that each of the two ncRNA catalogues
unevenly and lightly samples the true, much larger, ncRNA repertoire of the mouse.

Background

The eukaryotic transcriptome now appears far more complex
and extensive than previously anticipated. Transcription
units are frequently interleaved [1] and transcripts are produced from both coding and noncoding stretches of the
genome, including intergenic, intronic and promoter regions
[2,3], resulting in a vast array of RNA molecules varying in

size, abundance and protein-coding potential. For example,
of the 10% of human euchromatic nucleotides that appear to
be stably transcribed, more than half lie outside protein-coding gene annotations [2]. Widespread non-protein-coding
RNA transcription is evident in many eukaryotic genomes,
including mouse, fruitfly and plants [4].

Despite the ever increasing number of long (>200 nucleotide)
noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts being identified, the
functions of most remain to be determined. Indeed, their biological significance remains controversial [5]. Arguing in
favor of their biological relevance are observations that
ncRNAs often show variable, perhaps regulated, spatiotemporal expression patterns [6,7], and that their sequences are
better conserved with respect to substitutions, insertions and
deletions than are putative neutrally evolving sequences [8].
Many long ncRNAs whose functions have been experimentally determined act as transcriptional regulators [4]. For
some long ncRNAs it is the act of transcription itself that promotes or suppresses transcription from a neighboring gene
locus. In such cases, it is expected that the resultant RNA
transcript lacks biological relevance, and thus fails to be subject to selection. The DNA sequence that is transcribed, on the
other hand, may be subject to strong selection because of harboring, for example, transcription factor-binding sites that
become accessible upon transcription. Other long ncRNAs
form ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate transcription
in trans, far from the long ncRNA locus. The protein-binding
sites of these long ncRNAs, which may span RNA secondary
structures, are expected to be subject to purifying selection
and thus evolve more slowly than neutral sequence.
In order to address issues of functionality and evolutionary
conservation of ncRNAs, it will be important to determine
their numbers and conservation (or otherwise) in different
eukaryotic genomes. Partial ncRNA catalogues have become
available for a number of different species, including mouse.
One of the first such catalogues is of long intergenic ncRNA
transcripts (herein termed 'macroRNAs') sequenced from
mouse cDNA libraries by the FANTOM consortium [3,9].
Comparison of the evolutionary signatures of 3,222 macroRNAs to those of neighboring putatively non-functional
sequence showed that macroRNAs exhibit suppressed evolutionary rates for both primary and promoter sequences; these
results support the functionality of a small (approximately
5%) portion of such transcripts' sequences [8]. These results
countered an earlier analysis that suggested that macroRNAs
generally were poorly conserved and thus unlikely to be functional [5]. The findings also serve as an illustration of how the
careful application of reliable neutral rates is essential to
assess constraint [8].
Recently, Guttman and colleagues [10] introduced a second
catalog of 1,600 long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA)
intervals in mouse, identified using genome-wide chromatinstate maps. Briefly, lincRNA loci are genomic intervals outside protein-coding gene annotations that are significantly
enriched in two epigenetic markers of transcription: trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), often associated with active promoters, and trimethylation of lysine 36 on
histone H3 (H3K36me3), associated with transcribed regions
[11]. In contrast to macroRNA loci, the fraction of transcribed
nucleotides and the transcript sequences for most lincRNA

intervals remain unidentified. This is because RNA transcription was investigated, using a hybridization-based approach,
for only 350 randomly sampled regions [10]. RNA transcription was validated for approximately 70% of these regions,
resulting in a total of 2,126 exons overlapping 549 lincRNA
intervals [10]. LincRNA exons and their putative promoters
were found by Guttman et al. [10] to be better conserved than
introns, which is suggestive of the action of purifying selection.
In order to compare the level of constraint between macroRNA and lincRNA exons, Guttman and colleagues [12]
employed a new method, called SiPhy. Instead of considering
the level of constraint across the full extent of these exons'
sequences, SiPhy reports exons' highest level of constraint
apparent in sliding windows typically of width 12 nucleotides.
One advantage of this approach is that it estimates constraint
from patterns of nucleotide substitutions. Another is that
constraint is estimated across multiple alignments from 21
mammalian species. However, the method does not employ a
full evolutionary model. Moreover, comparisons are made
against genome-wide random samples, rather than against
genomically local samples from putatively neutrally evolving
sequence that would account for local substitution rate variation. SiPhy results indicate that lincRNA exons tend to contain more highly constrained 12-nucleotide sequences than
macroRNA exons [10]. Rather than calculating maximum
constraint, we were interested in assessing the levels of constraint across all aligned exonic nucleotides for each of the
two catalogues. We realized that mouse-human pairwise
comparisons of full transcript sequences (>100 nucleotides)
will often reflect greater numbers of nucleotide substitutions
than SiPhy 12-nucleotide windows [12], and thus will tend to
be more informative. This analysis would provide a more
comprehensive reflection of selective constraints that have
acted upon the complete extent of these macroRNA and lincRNA exons.
A surprisingly small fraction (approximately 11%) of lincRNAs were seen to be present also in the macroRNA set.
Explanations for this relatively poor overlap were not
advanced by Guttman et al. [10]. Perhaps the use of different
experimental approaches, and of different tissues and cell
lines, has resulted in an uneven sampling from different portions of the mouse transcriptome? Alternatively, since the
amount of functional sequence and how it compares between
catalogues remain unknown, one or both catalogues may contain a large fraction of 'transcriptional noise', resulting from
spurious transcription of non-functional loci. If, as Guttman
et al. report, lincRNA loci are considerably better conserved
than are macroRNA loci, then the poor overlap between the
two ncRNA catalogues may simply reflect differences in their
amounts of inconsequential transcription.
We sought to compare the selective constraints that have
acted upon macroRNA and lincRNA loci to determine

whether these catalogues contain different proportions of
spurious inconsequential ncRNA transcripts. For our analysis
we considered the full extent of ncRNA sequences and
employed three complementary approaches: a multi-species
comparison that complements the Guttman et al. approach; a
rate-based method that, importantly, accounts for base composition and local variations in neutral substitution rates; and
a human population genetics based approach. We considered
only exonic sequence - rather than all transcribed ncRNA
sequence as done previously [8] - to allow comparison with
the Guttman et al. study. Contrary to the results of Guttman
et al., we find that the two ncRNA catalogues exhibit similar
degrees of constraint and amounts of functional sequence.
We then explored the biological properties of transcripts in
these catalogues and concluded that each of these catalogues
preferentially samples different portions of the mouse transcriptome. Importantly, our results indicate that a large
number of long intergenic ncRNAs remain to be identified.

both significantly overrepresented with such elements (2.2and 2.6-fold overrepresentations, respectively; P < 10-4, permutation test; Table 1) compared with intergenic regions.
NcRNA exons, from both catalogues, thus contain a higher
density of conserved sequence elements than random samples of intergenic sequence, but the two catalogues show no
considerable difference in constraint between them.
These observations were supported by an analysis of the density within ncRNA exons of a second set of conserved
sequence, indel-purified sequence (IPS) [14]. This set of 90Mb long ungapped human, mouse and dog alignments, which
is highly enriched in functional sequence, was previously
identified using a neutral indel model [14]. By comparing the
density of ncRNA exons to the genomic distribution of intergenic IPSs in the mouse genome, macroRNA and lincRNA
exons were found to be substantially and significantly overrepresented in IPSs (1.73- and 1.77-fold increases, respectively; P < 10-4, permutation test; see Materials and methods;
Table 1).

Results
Similar densities of cross-species conserved sequence
elements within macroRNA and lincRNA exons

No significant difference in constraint between
lincRNA and macroRNA exons

We started by investigating the levels of cross-species conservation for the two long intergenic ncRNA catalogues (macroRNAs [8] and lincRNAs [10]). For this we initially
considered whether ncRNA exons are enriched in phastCons
elements, short sequences that have been conserved among
17 vertebrate species (including mammals, an amphibian, a
bird and fish) [13]. In agreement with the earlier SiPhy results
[12], we found that macroRNA and lincRNA exon sets are

Next we were interested in investigating if macroRNA and
lincRNA loci exhibit signatures of constraint on nucleotide
substitutions across the full extent of their exonic sequences
and whether the lincRNA catalogue, as reported [10], contains highly conserved transcripts. We compared the rates of
nucleotide substitution (dexon) between mouse-human
orthologous ncRNA exons to the rates (dAR) for ancestral
repeats (ARs), here defined as transposable elements that

LincRNA exons were observed to exhibit lower substitution
rates (median dexon = 0.426; Table 1) than neighboring neutrally evolving ARs (median dAR = 0.473). MacroRNA exons
also exhibit suppressed rates and to a similar extent (median
dexon = 0.418 versus median dAR = 0.473; Table 1). These differences in substitution rates between exonic and AR
sequences are highly significant (P < 10-15, two-sided MannWhitney (MW) test) and are consistent with a fraction of the
ncRNA exons having evolved under selective constraint.
We next sought to compare the extents by which purifying
selection has reduced nucleotide substitution rates for the
two catalogues, particularly mindful of the claims that lincRNAs are highly conserved, much more so than are macroRNAs [10]. For each catalogue we estimated the degree of
constraint on nucleotide substitutions in ncRNA exons versus
genomically neighboring ancestral repeats, dexon/dAR. The
dexon/dAR ratio for neutrally evolving sequence is expected not
to be significantly different from 1. A ratio significantly
smaller than 1 is indicative of purifying selection on deleterious substitutions being more prevalent in ncRNA exons than
in closely linked ARs. In this analysis, we took care to account
for the known positive correlation of substitution rates with
G+C content [17]. This was important because we found that
lincRNA exons possess a significantly higher median G+C
content than macroRNA exons (43.0% and 41.8%, respectively; P < 10-5, MW test; Figure 1). We note that this difference in nucleotide composition is likely, through its positive
correlation with neutral substitution rate, to contribute to the
higher dexon rate observed for the lincRNA set. It is also notable that the G+C content of ARs neighboring ncRNA loci is
significantly lower than that observed for either set of ncRNA
exons (median G+C content: 40.6%, P < 10-15, MW test; Figure 1). To account for these differences, we divided sequences
into five distinct classes according to their G+C content (see

inserted prior to the mouse-human split and that remain in
both species. Whilst a small minority of transposable elements are clearly functional [15], virtually all (>99.3%)
mouse-human ARs have acquired indel mutations uniformly
across their sequences, which is the expectation from neutral
evolution [14]. Furthermore, highly constrained nonexonic
elements arising from transposable elements contribute only
0.04% of the human genome [1]. Consequently, because
essentially all ARs evolve neutrally their rate of nucleotide
substitution provides a reliable proxy of the neutral rate of
evolution [14]. Such neutral rates are strongly autocorrelated
on a megabase scale but vary more widely within, and
between, chromosomes [16]. Genomically proximal AR
sequences thus provide useful evolutionary yardsticks against
which the suppression of substitution rates in neighboring
functional sequence can be inferred. To ensure the accuracy
of estimates, only exons for which at least 100 bp of mouse
sequence could be aligned to human were used in this analysis (3,537 of 5,893 macroRNA exons; 1,784 of 2,126 lincRNA
exons).

Materials and methods). For each ncRNA exon the substitution rate (dAR) of putatively neutral sequence in its vicinity
was inferred using mouse-human ARs (within a radius of 200
kb from the ncRNA locus boundary). More specifically, these
rates were inferred from AR alignments, matched in length
and in nucleotide content to the ncRNA genomic sequence,
generated by randomly sampling single columns from ARs
that were genomically neighboring and were represented in
the same G+C content class.
Having accounted for local and G+C-dependent variation in
dAR rates, we observed that median dexon/dAR values for lincRNA exons and macroRNA exons were not significantly different (0.904 for lincRNA, and 0.887 for macroRNA; P =
0.06, MW test; Table 1 and Figure 2a). In comparison, protein-coding exons were substantially better conserved than
these ncRNA sequences (median dexon/dAR = 0.338; P < 10-15,
MW test; Figure 2a), in agreement with previous findings
[10]. We also compared the numbers of ncRNA exons that
individually could be judged as having evolved under constraint owing to a suppressed rate of mouse-human nucleotide substitution rate (see Materials and methods). A
significantly higher proportion of macroRNA exons were
identified as being constrained compared with lincRNA exons
(1,393 (39.4%) versus 595 (33.6%), P < 10-4, two-sided
Fisher's exact (FE) test; Table 1).
We thus conclude, contrary to the initial report [10], first that
lincRNA sequences tend not to be highly conserved, and sec-

ond that their constraint is not significantly different from
that of macroRNAs.

Constraint on orthologous human sequence
We were next interested in whether the human sequences
orthologous to the mouse macroRNA and lincRNA exons
exhibit a signature of more recent selective constraint, not in
the approximately 90 million years since the last common
ancestor of human and mouse, but in the last approximately
80,000 years of modern human evolution. For this we took
advantage of HapMap data [18] and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within human sequences
orthologous to mouse ncRNA exons and ARs. More specifically, we counted SNPs in macroRNA or lincRNA exons and
in ARs according to their derived allele frequencies f: SNPs
were considered rare if f < 10% and intermediate in frequency
if 10% â¤ f â¤ 90%. We then compared proportions of rare
derived alleles in ncRNA exons with those in ARs. MacroRNA
exons were found to show a significant excess of rare derived
alleles, compared to ARs, which is compatible with the action,
within the modern human population, of purifying selection
on these sequences: numbers of rare over intermediate frequency derived SNPs were 978/2,675 in macroRNAs, and
25,478/79,295 in local ARs (P < 0.001, FE test; Table 1). No
such biases were found for lincRNA exon sequences (369/
1,110 in lincRNAs versus 24,755/77,066 in local ARs, P =
0.58, FE test; Table 1). Purifying selection on deleterious
mutations during modern human evolution is thus evident
for macroRNA exons but not for the lincRNA set.

Constraint on lincRNA and macroRNA promoter
sequences
We then turned to analyzing the evolutionary signatures evident from inferred macroRNA and lincRNA promoter
sequences. From the locations of mouse CAGE (cap-analysis
of gene expression) tags [3,19] we identified putative transcription start sites (TSSs) overlapping (by at least 1 nucleotide) 504 lincRNA intervals with validated expression and
1,802 macroRNA full-length transcripts. Thereafter we investigated the evolutionary signatures of their associated core
promoters, defined as 400 bp upstream of the TSS [20]. To
ensure accurate estimates, we only considered putative promoters with an alignable mouse-human region containing
greater than 100 bp (460 lincRNA and 1,477 macroRNA promoters).
The median substitution rate within ncRNA promoter (dpro)
regions was found to be significantly lower than that of neutrally evolving local ARs for both ncRNA catalogues (median
dpro values of 0.366 and 0.402 for macroRNAs and lincRNAs,
respectively; P < 10-15, MW test; Table 1). MacroRNA promoters were found to be under significantly greater selective constraint than lincRNA promoters (median dpro/dAR values of
0.787 and 0.857, respectively; P < 10-15, MW test; Table 1 and
Figure 2b). Alternatively, these results could reflect a mutational bias resulting in higher mutation rates in lincRNA promoters. In particular, regions of relatively open chromatin
(such as active promoters) are prone to higher rates of damage and thus mutation [21]. This mutational effect is expected

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R124

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/11/R124

to be more pronounced for promoters of genes associated
with higher levels of expression [21]. As we show later, lincRNAs tend to be expressed at higher levels than macroRNAs.
Both promoter sets appear to have been under slightly lower
selective constraints than protein-coding transcript promoters (median dpro/dAR = 0.747, P < 10-11, MW test; Figure 2b).
Sequences proximal to TSSs of protein-coding transcripts
have previously been shown to be marginally better conserved than those of noncoding transcripts [3].
Our results confirm previous observations [8,10] that ncRNA
promoters evolve under stronger purifying selection than
their ncRNA transcript sequences (P < 10-7, MW test). Some
of these ncRNAs may thus confer function by virtue of being
transcribed, perhaps by altering chromatin status to favor the
transcription of genes in their genomic vicinity [22,23],
rather than possessing a RNA sequence-specific function.

(94%) and macroRNA exons (92%) can be aligned. This
would be consistent with more macroRNAs than lincRNAs
being specific to the rodent lineage.

Noncoding RNA expression profiles
Cross-species conservation of transcription
Our findings are consistent with some of these ncRNA loci
being functionally conserved across approximately 90 million
years of evolution. Nevertheless, for function to be conserved,
evidence would be required for transcription in human, as
well as mouse, aligned orthologous sequence. It has been
reported that approximately 70% of lincRNA intervals in
humans exhibit similar chromatin signatures in the orthologous region of the mouse genome [10]. This proportion, however, was only estimated after lincRNA intervals, whose
sequences are not alignable between human and mouse, were
discarded [10]. This implies that the true fraction of conserved lincRNAs is smaller. Furthermore, as transcription is
only expected to be validated for a fraction of these human
and mouse lincRNA intervals, it remains to be determined
both how many lincRNA loci show conserved transcription in
both mouse and human, and whether the two ncRNA catalogues contain different proportions of cross-species conserved (that is, orthologous) ncRNA loci.
To determine the degree of conserved transcription between
human and mouse, we searched for evidence of ncRNA exon
expression using publicly available expression data (see
Materials and methods). The majority of mouse ncRNA loci
have no evidence for transcription in their human orthologous sequence, at least from available expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences. Evidence for transcription of humanaligned ncRNA exons was available for only 21% (446) of lincRNAs and 14% (641) of macroRNAs.
Nevertheless, it is notable that lincRNAs exhibit both significantly greater evidence for cross-species conservation of transcription (P < 10-15, FE test; Table 2) and significantly more
exons that can be aligned between human and mouse: 98% of
lincRNA exons and 73% of macroRNA exons contain one or
more aligned human bases. Interestingly, when compared to
the genome of a more closely related species, the rat (Rattus

During our identification of ncRNA promoters (described
above), we noted that lincRNA TSSs were more frequently
supported by CAGE tags than macroRNA TSSs (91% and
59%, respectively, P < 10-16, FE test). Moreover, lincRNA
TSSs are associated with greater numbers of CAGE tags than
macroRNA TSSs (means of 6.8 and 5.0 for lincRNAs and
macroRNAs, respectively). These two observations suggested
that lincRNAs may tend to be expressed at higher levels than
macroRNAs. To investigate this hypothesis, we used data
from gene expression arrays targeting over 36,000 mouse
transcripts [24]. These arrays were found to interrogate 230
lincRNA exons and 1,111 macroRNA exons. We shall assume
these subsets of exons faithfully represent the characteristics
of the full sets. We compared the median average difference
(AD) value between the two catalogues. Between values of 102
and 104 AD is known to be proportional to mRNA concentration in the sample [25,26]. We found that lincRNA exons tend
to be expressed more highly than macroRNA exons (median
AD values of 311.5 and 286.4, respectively; P < 5 Ã 10-3, MW
test; Table 2). Exons represented in both catalogues, or exons
that were found to be constrained, are also more likely to be
highly expressed (data not shown).
The higher expression of lincRNAs may indicate that macroRNAs are more likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific
manner. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the
number of 'tissue-specific' ncRNAs for which the expression
level in one tissue was at least five times higher than the
median expression level across all tissues. We identified more
such tissue-specific ncRNA exons for the macroRNA set compared to the lincRNA set (148 (13%) and 15 (6%), respectively;
P < 5 Ã 10-3, FE test; Table 2). Similar results were obtained
when other tissue-specificity thresholds (namely, three- and
ten-fold higher expression level than the median expression
level across all tissues) were used (data not shown). Next we
calculated tissue specificity (TS) values for each tissue and
each locus. TS is defined as the fractional expression of a locus

in one tissue relative to the sum of its expression in all tissues.
The maximum TS value (maxTS) for a locus thus provides an
indicator of tissue specificity, with higher values reflecting
more tissue-specific expression [27]. We found that macroRNA exons do indeed have a higher median maxTS value
than lincRNA exons (0.056 and 0.052, respectively, P < 0.01,
MW test; Table 2). These findings support the hypothesis that
macroRNAs tend to show more restricted tissue expression
than lincRNAs.
Protein-coding genes that are widely expressed tend to evolve
more slowly than genes with more restrictive tissue expression [28]; nevertheless, this tendency is mild for genes whose
products are intracellular [27]. For long ncRNAs, which of
course are also intracellular, no positive correlation was
observed between median ncRNA expression level and dexon/
dAR value (rho = -0.099, P < 0.05, Spearman correlation).

Regulation of ncRNA transcription
To further investigate the hypothesis that macroRNAs tend to
be more tissue-specific than lincRNAs, we next considered
the chromatin status of macroRNA loci. LincRNAs were
defined, in part, from their promoters being associated with
trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and their
transcribed regions being associated with trimethylation of
lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K4me36) [10]. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) macroRNAs are substantially and significantly (13.9-fold, P < 10-4, permutation test) enriched in
the H3K4me3 epigenetic mark at promoters, but their exons
are not associated with the H3K4me36 mark of active transcription (1.2-fold enrichment; P = 0.1, permutation test).
This suggests that although their promoters are active, macroRNA transcription occurs at low levels in ESCs. This interpretation is consistent with the higher enrichment of
H3K27me3, a mark usually associated with transcriptional
repression, in the macroRNA promoters than in lincRNA promoters (9.5- versus 4.9-fold enrichment; P < 10-3, permutation test) for ESCs. Although these data represent only
promoter and transcript activity for one cell line, they are consistent with our hybridization-based expression analysis in
several mouse tissues. The observed differences in chromatin
maps between lincRNA and macroRNA intervals in this one
cell type may reflect the higher and broader expression of lincRNAs in many cells and tissues.

Biological insights onto lincRNA and macroRNA
function
The two ncRNA catalogues differ in their extents and tissue
specificity of expression. Furthermore, lincRNA exons appear
to be more enriched in short highly conserved sequences than
macroRNA exons. One contributing reason for the higher
density of these conserved sequences within lincRNA loci
could be the preference for ncRNA loci to lie in the genomic
vicinity of particular classes of protein-coding genes. Transcription factor genes, for example, are typically found in the
midst of large numbers of conserved noncoding sequence

Marques and Ponting R124.7

[29,30]. Both ourselves [31] and Guttman et al. [10] have
shown a significant tendency for macroRNAs and lincRNAs,
respectively, to be transcribed in the vicinity of transcription
factor gene loci. This analysis was repeated to allow a direct
comparison between these sets. Although we find that macroRNA exons and lincRNA exons each exhibit a significant (P
< 10-4, permutation test) preference to lie close to proteincoding genes involved in the regulation of transcription, this
enrichment is considerably stronger for lincRNAs than it is
for macroRNA exons (2.4- and 1.7-fold enrichment, respectively; Table 1). This result suggests that constrained
sequences involved in the transcriptional regulation of neighboring transcription factor genes may contribute more to levels of constraint in lincRNA exons than to macroRNA exons.
In other words, the excess of constraint in lincRNA over macroRNA exons may reflect stronger purifying selection on their
DNA, rather than RNA, sequences.
Long ncRNAs, perhaps harboring protein-binding ligands in
the form of stable RNA secondary structures, may form ribonucleoprotein complexes that regulate transcription in trans
[32]. In order to gain further insights into lincRNA and macroRNA mechanisms of action, we assessed the relative abundance of RNA-sequence that is functional in ncRNA
transcripts by calculating the densities of predicted RNA secondary structures [33] in lincRNA and macroRNA exons.
Whilst a significant (P < 0.01, permutation test) 1.4-fold overrepresentation of these structures was found within macroRNA exons (Table 1), no significant tendency was observed
for lincRNA exons (20% depletion, P = 0.24, permutation
test; Table 1). This result suggests that macroRNAs are more
likely to regulate transcription in trans by forming ribonucleoprotein complexes, whilst lincRNAs are more often cis-regulatory molecules.

Similar results are obtained for a revised, more
conservative ncRNA catalog
The set of macroRNAs was defined originally as FANTOM
consortium transcripts lacking protein-coding potential that
mapped outside of ENSEMBL protein-coding gene models
from an early (May 2004; mm5) mouse genome assembly [8].
We were concerned that improvements to the mouse genome
assembly [34] and its gene models (in particular their
untranslated region sequences) may necessitate redefinition
of some intergenic macroRNAs. Indeed, by discarding all
ncRNAs overlapping with current ENSEMBL protein-coding
gene annotations (mm9) only 2,214 macroRNAs (covering
4,374 exons) and 1,416 lincRNAs (covering 1,033 exons)
remain. In these revised ncRNA sets, only 219 of 2,214 (9.8%)
macroRNAs and 159 of 1,416 (11.2%) lincRNAs are represented in both catalogues.
This more conservative definition of ncRNA loci leads, as
expected, to slight increases in substitution rates (dexon, dpro,
dexon/dAR, dpro/dAR; Table S1 in Additional data file 1), and
decreases in expression and tissue-specificity levels (AD,

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R124

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/11/R124

Genome Biology 2009,

maxTS; Table S2 in Additional data file 1). Importantly, however, macroRNA loci and their promoters remain more constrained than lincRNA loci (Table S1 in Additional data file 1).
We conclude that both ncRNA catalogues contain an important fraction of functional material and that the observed suppression in evolutionary rates is not principally due to overlap
with previously unannotated protein-coding gene exons.

Discussion

This study, and two that preceded it [8,10], indicate that long
intergenic ncRNA loci tend to be less constrained than protein-coding genes, but are more constrained than putatively
neutral sequence. Mutations within both promoter and transcribed sequences tend to be deleterious and thus are preferentially purged from the population (Table 1) consistent with
a fraction of these ncRNA loci being functional. Evolutionary
constraint between mouse and human is evident for 23% of
all ncRNA exons that we examined (Table 1). The remaining
77% of exons will be divided, in as-yet undefined proportions,
among selectively neutral, or positively selected, sequence
and among sequence that is specific to rodents, having been
acquired in that lineage or else lost in the primate lineage
[35]. Functional long ncRNA loci are likely to arise, and to be
lost, at high rates, with substantial divergence rendering
sequence similarities between diverse vertebrates indiscernible. This is because of purifying selection being considerably
less stringent on these ncRNA loci than it is on protein-coding
genes [4].
Our study shows, as expected, that coding exons and their
promoters tend to be subject to the greatest degree of purifying selection (dexon/dAR = 0.338; dpro/dAR = 0.747 (median
values)), and again as expected [3,8,10] that promoters of
long ncRNAs are better conserved than their exons (dpro/dAR
= 0.787 versus dexon/dAR = 0.887 for macroRNA loci; dpro/dAR
= 0.857 versus dexon/dAR = 0.904 for lincRNA (median values)). However, it was unexpected both that lincRNAs were
not 'highly conserved', as previously reported [10], and that
macroRNA exons were as well conserved as lincRNA exons
(Figure 2). Our results are likely to differ from those of Guttman et al. primarily because we have analyzed evolutionary
signatures of constraint across the full extent of exonic
sequences as opposed to restricting analysis to the most
highly conserved short sequence motifs within an exon. The
approach used here has similar, or even greater, power to
detect constrained ncRNAs as that chosen by Guttman and
colleagues. Indeed, for most sequences the information content currently available from 12-nucleotide windows of multiply-aligned sequences (with a maximum branch length of
four substitutions per site [12]) is smaller than those for
human-mouse pairwise comparisons (0.42 substitutions per
site on average) exceeding 100 aligned nucleotides.
Our analyses suggest that lincRNA loci contain a lower, not
higher, proportion of functional sequence than macroRNA

Volume 10, Issue 11, Article R124

Marques and Ponting R124.8

loci. However, this slight difference may only reflect the contrasting experimental approaches taken when defining each
of the two catalogues. By contrast to macroRNA exons, whose
boundaries were identified by direct mapping of the
sequenced transcript onto the mouse genome and thus are
expected to correctly delineate macroRNA exons, lincRNA
exons were defined using a hybridization-based approach
whose accuracy was strongly dependent on the microarray
resolution, resulting in exonic limits that were only defined
approximately. A consequence of this experimental imprecision is that the lincRNA exon set will be contaminated by
intronic nucleotides, which would be expected to slightly
inflate true exonic rate estimates. It would thus not be surprising if true lincRNA exons were to have evolved little differently from macroRNA exons.
Guttman et al. previously presented evidence that the highest
level of constraint in 12-nucleotide windows within lincRNA
exons exceeds that within macroRNAs [10]. This would be
consistent with the modest difference in multi-species conserved (phastCons) elements between the two sets (Table 1).
Nevertheless, a greater proportion of macroRNA exons show
significant evidence of constraint than lincRNA exons (Table
1). Taken together, these findings are consistent with lincRNA
exons containing short regions of highly constrained
sequence, whereas constraint in macroRNA exons is distributed more diffusely (Figure 3). Short functional DNA elements, such as those regulating the expression of
transcription factor genes, may contribute more to sequence
constraint on lincRNA exons than they have to macroRNA
exon constraint. Furthermore, in contrast to macroRNAs, we
found no statistical evidence for lincRNAs being enriched in
predicted RNA secondary structures. Consequently, macroRNA locus function may more frequently be RNA
sequence-specific, whereas lincRNA loci may more often act
in a RNA sequence-independent manner, for example, by
transcriptional interference [36].
The low degree of concordance between the two sets may
reflect a situation where the true long ncRNA locus repertoire
of the mouse genome is very large, such that only small numbers of long ncRNA loci are identified in both of two largely
independent experimental samples. The low concordance
may also reflect biological differences between the two long
ncRNA catalogues, which were identified by two very different experimental approaches. MacroRNAs tend to be
expressed in a tissue-specific manner and to be associated, in
mouse ESCs, with chromatin marks that are usually associated with transcriptional repression (namely, promoter
H3K27me3 marks) but not exonic markers of transcription
(H3K4me36). The large degree of complementarity between
the two catalogues might be expected because macroRNAs
are more frequently tissue-specific, having been identified
from full-length cDNA libraries prepared from diverse mouse
tissues, including from very early embryonic stages and preimplantation embryos, whereas lincRNA loci were identified

defined by Guttman and colleagues [10]. To identify putative
TSSs in both transcript sets we searched for CAGE tags [3,19]
(from 592,568 mouse CAGE tag clusters available from the
UCSC Genome Browser Database [38]) that overlapped by at
least 1 nucleotide the transcribed ncRNA locus. We defined
the core promoter as the 400 bp upstream of the putative
TSS.

Conclusions

Mouse (mm8) ENSEMBL protein-coding exons were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser Database [38]. To
define mouse-human ARs, we first downloaded RepeatMasker [39] transposable element annotations from the UCSC
Genome Browser Database [38] for human (hg18). Next,
human-mouse blastZ whole genome alignments [40], available from the UCSC Genome Browser Database [38], were
used to identify and extract the putative orthologous
sequence in mouse (mm8) for all loci. All regions of at least
100 bp in size were defined as mouse-human ARs.

Here we show that two sets of intergenic long ncRNA loci in
mouse tend to be subject to similar and generally low levels of
selective constraint. Nevertheless these sequences evolve significantly slower than neighboring neutral sequence, which is
consistent with their functionality.
Importantly, it does appear that the vast majority of all true
long ncRNA loci remain to be identified. We arrive at this conclusion because even broadly expressed (that is, non-tissuespecific) macroRNA exons are poorly represented in the lincRNA catalogue (8.4%; 81 of 963 exons). Clearly, much work
remains to be done to identify the complete set of mouse
ncRNAs before general conclusions concerning their biological mechanisms can be made.

Materials and methods
Data sets
We employed the liftOver tool [37] to map successfully onto
mouse genome build mm8 3,051 (5,893 exons) of the 3,122
macroRNAs [8] from mouse assembly mm5. We downloaded
the genomic positions of lincRNAs and 2,126 lincRNA exons

Nucleotide substitution rates
Genomic coordinates of ARs, exons and promoter loci in each
catalogue (mm8) were used to obtain their corresponding
genomic sequences. Mouse-human blastZ whole genome
alignments [40], available from the UCSC Genome Browser
Database [38], were used to identify and extract putative
orthologous sequence in human (hg18) for all loci. We estimated nucleotide substitution rates (dexon or dpro) between
orthologous mouse-human aligned sequences using baseml,
from the PAML package [41], with the REV substitution
model. We considered only mouse-human alignments longer
than 100 bp, to ensure the accuracy of the estimates.

Genome Biology 2009,

The G+C content was determined for all exons, promoters
and ARs. AR G+C content was used to define five equally populated classes of G+C content and assigned all sequences to
these classes according to their G+C fraction: G+C content â¤
0.3426; 0.3426 < G+C content â¤ 0.3867; 0.3867 < G+C content â¤ 0.42509; 0.42509 < G+C content â¤ 0.4699; 0.4699 <
G+C content. The higher the number of G+C classes the better neutral rates will account for nucleotide content biases but
the less neutral material will be available within each class.
To obtain normalized rates (dexon/dAR or dpro/dAR), we estimated the nucleotide substitution rate for all ARs within 200
kb upstream and downstream of the sequence of interest
within the same G+C content class and defined dAR as the
median of these values.
Significantly constrained sequences were identified when
their mouse-human substitution rate was significantly (P <
0.025, false discovery rate = 3.6%) smaller than the rates of
neighboring putatively neutrally evolving sequence with the
same nucleotide content. For this, we estimated the local neutral rates by concatenating all local ARs' mouse-human alignments from a matched G+C content class. We then randomly
sampled single columns from these alignments to obtain
putatively neutral sequence with the exact length and nucleotide content as the sequence of interest and estimated the
substitution rate. A promoter or exon was considered to be
constrained if fewer than 25 dAR values from 1,000 iterations
of this procedure were smaller than its substitution rate (that
is, P < 0.025).

Genome-wide association procedure
The significance of genome-wide associations was assessed,
as previously, using a randomization procedure that accounts
for G+C content and chromosome-specific biases [8]. This
compares, within a workspace I (see below), a defined set of
genomic segments S against multiple randomized sets of segments of matched length S', chosen within the same G+C subset of I and within each chromosome. The sets S and S' are
compared with respect to their overlap with six specific sets of
sequence annotations E: IPSs previously identified with a
false discovery rate of 10% [14]; a set of evolutionarily conserved phastCons elements in 17 species (mouse, rat, rabbit,
human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog, cow, armadillo, elephant, tenrec, opossum, chicken, Xenopus, tetraodon, fugu
and zebrafish) alignments (PhastCons17way) [13] obtained
from the UCSC Genome Browser Database [38]; Evofold predictions of RNA secondary structure [33]; protein-coding
gene territories (see below) associated with Gene Ontology
term [42] 'regulation of transcription' [GO:0045449]; H3K4
and H3K27 intervals; and H3K36 intervals. The workspace I
was defined as the intergenic sequence between ENSEMBL
protein-coding genes. In the third case (Evofold predictions
of RNA secondary structure) I was further restricted to those
intergenic sequences that are multiply aligned to genomic
sequences of five or more vertebrate species in the eight-way

MultiZ alignment [43], and exhibit overlap with PhastCons
multispecies conserved elements. This extra filter was
required to account for Evofold searching for RNA secondary
structures only within such conserved regions. Simulations
were performed 10,000 times.

Protein coding genes with regulation of transcription
annotation
We divided the mouse genome into protein-coding gene territories by determining the mid-distance, i, between each
known mouse protein-coding gene and its closest upstream
and downstream protein-coding neighbor i - 1 and i + 1 [31].
A gene's territory is defined as the interval delimited by
genomic coordinates i - 1 to i + 1. Gene ontology annotations
for mouse protein-coding genes (build mm8) were downloaded from ENSEMBL [44] and ncRNA loci lying within
each territory were associated with this protein-coding gene
annotation.

Derived SNP frequency
We downloaded African population frequency data for SNPs
assayed by the HapMap consortium [18], and corresponding
chimpanzee and rhesus macaque alleles (NCBI build 1). We
considered the ancestral allele to be the chimpanzee allele if
its Phred quality score was higher than 40 (less than 1 error
per 1,000 bases), or else the macaque allele when it was
sequenced at sufficient quality. SNPs were discarded if they
failed to segregate within the analysis panel, or if fewer than
100 samples were typed, or if ancestral or reference human
alleles (taken from NCBI build 35) failed to agree with either
of the SNP alleles. We used whole genome pairwise mousehuman alignments to extract the genomic coordinates of
human (hg18) orthologous regions of mouse (mm8) ncRNA
exons and ARs. We identified SNPs overlapping these regions
and recorded their derived allele frequencies f. We compared
the numbers of overlapping SNPs within two derived population frequencies, rare (f < 10%) or intermediate (10% â¤ f â¤
90%), for ncRNA exons and ARs.

Conservation of expression in orthologous human
regions
We used human ESTs and RNA sequences from GenBank to
search for evidence of human transcription of orthologous
exons of mouse macroRNAs and lincRNAs. The coordinates
of all human ESTs and RNAs available from GenBank (downloaded 10 July 2008) that mapped uniquely to regions outside of known protein coding genes in the human genome
(Ensembl v50, 384,861 sequences) were mapped onto the
mouse build 36 assembly using the human-mouse genome
alignment data and the LiftOver [37] tool from UCSC. We
used default parameters, and set the minimum ratio of
mapped nucleotides to 0.2, appropriate for the human-mouse
divergence. We considered a ncRNA exon to be expressed in
its human orthologous region if it overlapped by one or more
nucleotides one of 145,321 human EST/RNA sequences that
map to the mouse genome.

Expression profile analysis
To investigate the expression profiles of ncRNAs, we used
RNA hybridization-based GNF Gene Expression Atlas data
for 61 mouse tissues [24]. To associate ncRNA exons with oligonucleotide tags on the microarrays, we intersected their
genomic coordinates (obtained from the UCSC Genome
Browser Database [38]). Exons were assigned the expression
level, measured as AD, of their associated tag. Subsequently,
median expression levels for each exon across all 61 tissues
were calculated. An exon was classified as being tissue-specific if its expression in one tissue exceeded by at least five
times the median expression level across all tissues.
We defined the tissue specificity value (TS) of an exon
expressed in tissue i as its AD expression value in i divided by
the sum of its AD values in all tissues. To minimize redundancy in the tissue set, we considered only 32 tissues for
which expression had been found previously to be poorly correlated [27]. The maximum TS (maxTS) was considered to be
the highest TS value found across these 32 tissues.
