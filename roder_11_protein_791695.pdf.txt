Protein or no protein? Using PCR for detecting
allergens in foods
Martin Röder*, Stefan Vieths, Thomas Holzhauser
From Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Meeting 2011
Venice, Italy. 17-19 February 2011

The latest amendment (2007/68/EC) of annex IIIa of the
European Directive 2000/13/EC currently requires 14
groups of allergenic food ingredients to be mandatory
labelled. The labelling does not refer to a certain compound of an allergenic food but the allergenic food
itself. Thus, every method that has been demonstrated
to reliably detect the target food is applicable. State of
the art in the detection of allergenic foods has been the
protein based Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay
(ELISA) and meanwhile, numerous studies have demonstrated good correlation between protein based ELISA
and DNA based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
methods. Even in protein enriched isolates or concentrates DNA has been proven to be an alternative molecular marker for the presence of an allergenic food.
Since 2005 the number of scientific publications on PCR
for allergen detection has increased tremendously, of
which real-time PCR with sequence specific fluorescent
probes is considered state-of-the-art technology. Both
ELISA and PCR exhibit strengths and limitations: ELISA
are considered a quantitative methodology with high
sensitivity at a level of 1-10 mg/kg. However, known
cross-reactivity to phylogenetically closely related foods
or ingredients thereof may lead to false-positive results.
By contrast PCR offers unparalleled specificity to avoid
complaints or potentially expensive food recalls due to
false-positives. For PCR, a sensitivitiy below 10 mg/kg,
which is considered sufficient in comparison to known
clinical threshold data, is feasible. Moreover, real-time
PCR allows multi-allergen screening in one run. In addition, first PCR methods with quantitative features have
been published and more are expected in the near
future. Thus, PCR may complement or even substitute
ELISA depending on the allergenic food to detect.
