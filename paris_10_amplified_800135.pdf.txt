Abstract
Background: AFLP markers are widely used in evolutionary genetics and ecology. However the frequent occurrence of
non-homologous co-migrating fragments (homoplasy) both at the intra- and inter-individual levels in AFLP data sets is
known to skew key parameters in population genetics. Geneticists can take advantage of the growing number of full
genome sequences available for model species to study AFLP homoplasy and to predict it in non-model species.
Results: In this study we performed in silico AFLPs on the complete genome of three model species to predict intraindividual homoplasy in a prokaryote (Bacillus thuringiensis ser. konkukian), a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) and an animal
(Aedes aegypti). In addition, we compared in silico AFLPs to empirical data obtained from three related non-model
species (Bacillus thuringiensis ser. israelensis, Arabis alpina and Aedes rusticus). Our results show that homoplasy rate
sharply increases with the number of peaks per profile. However, for a given number of peaks per profile, genome size
or taxonomical range had no effect on homoplasy. Furthermore, the number of co-migrating fragments in a single
peak was dependent on the genome richness in repetitive sequences: we found up to 582 co-migrating fragments in
Ae. aegypti. Finally, we show that in silico AFLPs can help to accurately predict AFLP profiles in related non-model
species.
Conclusions: These predictions can be used to tackle current issues in the planning of AFLP studies by limiting
homoplasy rate and population genetic estimation bias. ISIF (In SIlico Fingerprinting) program is freely available at

Background
Many key questions in evolutionary genetics and ecology
cannot be addressed solely using model species, and until
recently, the genomic study of non-model species (ecogenomics [1,2]) was limited by the lack of genomic information available. However, the taxonomical range of
model species for which whole genome sequences are
readily available in databases is already wide and is rapidly expanding. The genomic resources already available
can constitute a key tool for molecular ecologists, to optimize experimental design and decrypt the genetics of
related non-model species [3,4]. Amplified Fragment
Length Polymorphism (AFLP) [5] is one of the most
extensively used DNA fingerprinting methods and has
many applications on model and non-model species, such
as inferring genetic structure, genetic diversity, demogra* Correspondence: margotparis1@gmail.com

phy, phylogeny, genotyping, gene mapping or genome
scan analyses [6-11]. Genomic DNA is digested into
thousands of fragments using restriction enzymes. A subset of the genomic restriction fragments is PCR amplified
using primers with 1 - 4 selective bases each, thereby
reducing the number of fragments on the profile. The
fragments are separated lengthwise using electrophoresis, and discrete peaks can be visualized on a typical
AFLP profile. Each discrete peak position is scored, i.e.
characterized as a biallelic locus (coded 0/1) in a 50 - 500
bp range [11]. This technique is based on the assumption
that co-migrating fragments of the same length are
homologous and come from the same chromosomal
region. In practice, this assumption is not systematically
tested [12].
The quality of the AFLP result (i.e. the profile) is determined by several factors, including the number of peaks
detected and their length distribution. The AFLP method
usually produces 40 - 200 peaks per profile [7]. A large
number of peaks in a profile increases the probability of

detecting genetic polymorphism, but also the probability
of poorly separated unscorable peaks and homoplasy.
Homoplasy occurs when non-identical fragments originating from different loci in the genome co-migrate [12].
Peak homoplasy can arise through two major processes
in AFLP data sets. First, at the individual level, an AFLP
peak can contain several non-identical co-migrating fragments which co-migrate by chance, or because they share
similar sequences but not the same location in the
genome (repeated DNA). These fragments with high similarity could be orthologous or paralogous copies of
genes, pseudogenes, transposable elements, or repetitive
sequences with unknown functions [13]. Second, at the
inter-individual level, AFLP peaks of the same length in
two different profiles are not necessarily homologous [1315]. Additionally, homoplasy between individuals can be
increased artificially during the scoring. This "technical
homoplasy" has recently been described by Arrigo et al.
[16] which recommended AFLP scoring procedures minimizing this bias. Caballero et al. [17] recently used a theoretical approach to estimate biases due to co-migrating
fragments in population genetic analyses based on AFLP
data. They found that inter-individual homoplasy causes
overestimation of allele frequencies, underestimation of
the degree of differentiation between subpopulations and
reduces the performance of genomic scan when detecting
loci under selection. Furthermore, intra-individual
homoplasy can also affect the estimation of genetic estimators [18,19]. Evaluating and limiting homoplasy in data
sets used for population genetic inference and genome
scan analysis is therefore of primary importance.
Few studies have attempted to estimate the proportion
of co-migrating AFLP fragments in a profile or between
individuals either directly by sequencing peaks [15,2023], or indirectly by comparing AFLP patterns resulting
from several runs of selective amplification using primers
with an additional nucleotide [14,24], by modeling the
fragments' length distribution [12,25] or by performing in
silico AFLP [13,26]. These studies established that
homoplasy is frequent in most AFLP data sets and is
higher in short peaks or when many AFLP peaks are generated. In the rare studies evaluating the proportion of
co-migrating fragments, homoplasy ranged from 4% in
individuals up to 100% across species from distantly
related taxa.
At the individual level, the number of peaks and the
clarity of the profiles are strongly dependent on the selection of restriction enzymes and on the number and the
sequence of selective bases. For most studies on plant and
animal genomes, the restriction enzyme combination
EcoRI/MseI and three selective bases for each primer are
used [7,27]. For larger or polyploid genomes, a two-step
amplification procedure using 4 selective bases is recommended [28,29]. On the other hand, for small bacterial

Page 2 of 13

and fungal genomes, a single amplification with one or
two selective nucleotides is sufficient [30,31]. Moreover,
the nucleotide composition of the selective bases influences the number of amplified fragments and their length
distribution [26,32] thereby affecting homoplasy. For
example, the use of A/T selective bases results in an overrepresentation of shorter fragments in Arabidopsis thaliana [26].
Although all these factors have an important influence
on the AFLP profiles, it is difficult to foresee which combinations of enzymes and selective bases will be the most
informative for the AFLP study of non-model species.
The most commonly used method is to first test a large
amount of primer combinations on a sub-sample of representative individuals before performing the whole population analysis using a few selected primer
combinations, but this process can be time consuming
and expensive. Another approach is the use of bioinformatics, to take advantage of the exponentially growing
number of full genome sequences available, for example
by performing in silico AFLPs [33-35].
In silico AFLPs simulate the AFLP experimental process
on a full sequenced genome and provides the length of
the virtual fragments, their sequences and their positions
along the genome at no cost. In this study, we first validated this approach by showing the consistency between
in silico and experimental AFLPs on the model species
Arabidopsis thaliana. We also examined whether the fluorescence intensity of peaks was a reliable predictor of
homoplasy. Then, in silico AFLPs were performed on
three model species genomes covering wide taxonomical
and genome size ranges, including a prokaryote (Bacillus
thuringiensis ser. konkukian, 5.2 Mb), a plant (Arabidopsis
thaliana, 120 Mb) and an animal genome (Aedes aegypti,
1,310 Mb). This made it possible to compare the profile
quality (number of peaks generated and proportion of
non-homologous co-migrating fragments per profile) in
genomes which widely differ in size and in the abundance
of repetitive sequences [36-38], but comparable for their
GC content (35.4%, 36% and 38.2% respectively). We first
examined the effect of genome features such as size and
repeated elements prevalence and AFLP parameters
(number of selective bases, GC content) on homoplasy at
the intra-individual level (i.e. co-migrating fragments
within a peak). We then looked at the effect of these
parameters on the number of peaks generated and peak
length distribution. As most AFLP studies are used on
non-model species, we finally asked to what extent
knowledge of the profiles obtained in silico for model species can help to predict the quality of the profiles
obtained empirically on non-model related species. To
answer this question, we compared the in silico AFLP
results obtained in the three model species with the
experimental AFLP profiles obtained in three related,

non-model species (Bacillus thuringiensis ser. israelensis,
Arabis alpina and Aedes rusticus).

Results
The ISIF procedure: description and validation on model
species

The user friendly program ISIF allows carrying out in silico AFLPs on species for which whole genome sequences
are available. ISIF is freely available at http://wwwleca.ujf-grenoble.fr/logiciels.htm. The program can analyze all sequences saved as plain text, without line numbers and spaces, such as text files. The AFLP procedure is
simulated by the program step by step: 1) identification of
the restriction sites and production of the pool of restriction fragments, 2) selection of the final set of fragments
that exhibit the selective bases used for the amplification,
and 3) determination of the length of all peaks in the
AFLP profile by adding the adaptor length to the selective
AFLP fragments. For any restriction enzyme and selective bases combinations, ISIF can provide the sequences
of the virtual fragments, their positions along the
genome, their length and the length of the associated
peaks in the AFLP profile.
In silico AFLPs on A. thaliana using the primer combination EcoRI+ATG/MseI+ATG generated 20 non-identical fragments between 50 and 500 pb; however, due to
size homoplasy, this only corresponded to 13 different
peak sizes (Figure 1). Experimental AFLP generated a
profile with 12 peaks (Figure 1) and the two profiles
almost perfectly matched, except for the expected peak at
410 bp that was scored as missing in the experimental
profile (Figure 1) because it was below the detection
threshold (only 85 rfu in intensity). We repeated the
whole AFLP protocol three times, and we found no difference between the three experimental AFLP profiles;
the reproducibility rate was 100%. All experimental
sequenced fragments obtained by pyrosequencing perfectly matched the sequences of in silico fragments,
including the 410 bp fragment.
In silico AFLP profiles

In silico analyses generated a total of 5,345 fragments and
2,709 peaks for the model species B. thuringiensis ser.
konkukian (5 to 260 peaks per primer combination using
1 to 3 selective bases), 17,425 fragments and 9,907 peaks
for A. thaliana (2 to 283 peaks per primer combination
using 4 to 6 selective bases), and 21,729 fragments and
10,138 peaks for Ae. aegypti (3 to 294 peaks per primer
combination using 5 to 8 selective bases). For each species, the mean number of peaks per group of primer combination with a similar number of selective bases (1 to 8
when considering the total number of selective bases
added for the 2 primers) and nucleotide composition (GC
content) is shown in Table 1. The results of all 284 primer

Page 3 of 13

combinations are presented in Additional file 1. The total
peak length distribution (i.e. without selective bases)
showed that the number of small length peaks greatly
exceeded that of longer length peaks for the three
genomes (Figure 2A). Fragment length distribution did
not differ between the eukaryote and prokaryote
genomes (Table 2).
We first examined the effect of upstream parameters:
genome features (size and repeated elements prevalence)
and AFLP parameters (number of selective bases, GC
content) on homoplasy. Homoplasy was measured using
two statistics: the homoplasy rate (H) in each AFLP profile (i.e. ratio of the number of peaks containing comigrating non-homologous fragments to the total number of peaks), and the number of co-migrating fragments
per homoplasious peak. Then, we looked at the effect of
these parameters on AFLP diagnostics (number of peaks
and peak length distribution) to finally evaluate the accuracy of AFLP diagnostics to predict homoplasy.
Effects of upstream parameters on homoplasy

Homoplasy rate calculated for each primer combination
ranged from 0 to 69.2% for B. thurigiensis ser. konkukian,
0 to 58.5% for the model species A. thaliana and 0 to
66.6% for Ae. aegypti (Figure 2B). There was no significant effect of genome size on homoplasy rate, but we
observed significant differences of the number of comigrating fragments within a peak among the three species with different genome size (Table 2). Homoplasious
peaks contained on average 3 co-migrating fragments for
the model species B. thurigiensis ser. konkukian (range: 2
- 18) and A. thaliana (range: 2 - 64) and 4 co-migrating
fragments for Ae. aegypti (range: 2 - 582). The presence of
repetitive elements had a positive effect on the number of
co-migrating fragments. A large frequency of co-migrating fragments was found in Ae. aegypti peaks (Figure 2D).
In our study, a maximum of 582 co-migrating fragments in one single peak was observed for Ae. aegypti. Of
the 582 co-migrating fragments of 324 bp, 580 exhibited
high similarity in sequence (mean identity index = 0.97,
range: 0.84 - 1, calculated with Bioedit version 7.0.5 [39])
and corresponded to highly repetitive sequences in the
genome. Using RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org, [40]), the sequence was identified as a LINE retroelement. For A. thaliana, a maximum of 64 comigrating fragments of 108 bp including 61 similar
sequences (mean identity index = 0.97, range: 0.87 - 1)
was observed, corresponding to a LTR element (Gypsy).
For B. thurigiensis ser. konkukian, two peaks contained 18
co-migrating fragments of 89 and 144 bp and were both
composed of 14 fragments with the same sequence (mean
Identity index = 1) but located at different places in the
genome. These sequences were not identified as transposable elements by RepeatMasker.

EcoRI+ATG/MseI+ATG for the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.

Effects of upstream parameters on AFLP diagnostics

The number of selective bases determined the number of
peaks generated and should be chosen according to the
genome size under analysis; a larger number of selective
bases reduced the number of fragments and peaks generated (Table 1). Furthermore, for the three species and for
the same number of selective bases, the number of peaks
generated decreased whilst the GC content of the selective bases increased (Table 2). For example, for Ae.
aegypti, the primer combinations with 6 selective bases
biased in AT produced more than twice the number of
peaks than those biased in GC (mean = 156 and mean =
58 respectively, Table 1). The same trend was observed
for the other species. The composition of primer combinations (i.e. GC content) had no significant effect on
homoplasy rate and on the number of co-migrating fragments present in the peaks (Table 2).
Accuracy of AFLP diagnostics to evaluate homoplasy

Generalized linear model showed a very strong effect of
the number of peaks in a profile on the homoplasy rate
(Table 2). Indeed, for all species a strong positive correlation was found between the number of peaks detected in
a profile and the homoplasy rate (Figure 2B, Pearson's
correlation: N = 84, r = 0.94, P < 0.001 for B. thurigiensis
ser. konkukian; N = 100, r = 0.94, P < 0.001 for A. thaliana

and N = 100, r = 0.93, P < 0.001 for Ae. aegypti). For
example, in profiles with 100 peaks, about a quarter of
peaks were composed of co-migrating fragments. The
homoplasy rate decreased to around 15% for profiles with
50 peaks. In our study, only 43 profiles out of 284 did not
present any co-migrating fragments but they contained
few peaks (2 - 32 peaks). However, the choice of primer
combinations producing less than 30 peaks does not
guarantee the absence or a low level of homoplasy. For
example, in the A. thaliana, the primer combination
E+ACG/M+CTC generated a homoplasy rate of 28.5% in
a profile with 40 AFLP fragments distributed in only 7
peaks.
The probability of peaks being homoplasious was negatively correlated with their length, (Figure 2C; B. thurigiensis ser. Konkukian: Pearson's correlation, r = -0.30,
N = 329, P < 0.001; A. thaliana: r = -0.83, N = 451, P <
0.001 and Ae. Aegypti: r = -0.77, N = 451, P < 0.001), small
length peaks more often contained co-migrating fragments. For example, peaks smaller than 100 bp in length,
accounted for 36% of the homoplasy in our data. Our in
silico results are in concordance with the theoretical finding that small peaks are more often homoplasious [18].
There was a significant positive effect of the total number of peaks in a profile on the number of co-migrating
fragments present in peaks and a significant negative

effect of peak length (Table 2). Indeed, homoplasious
peaks contained more co-migrating fragments in profiles
with a large number of peaks and in a smaller length
range. However, when considering only peaks containing
more than 10 co-migrating fragments (183 peaks), no
more effect of peak size or effect of the number of peaks
in a profile on the number of co-migrating fragments
were detected (Table 2). This suggests a random size distribution of peaks containing a large number of fragments.
Detecting homoplasious peaks in empirical profiles

A total of 118 peaks were generated by the seven primer
combinations on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana,
of which 10 were homoplasious. There was a significant
effect of peak size on peak fluorescence intensity and no
significant effect of homoplasy (Table 2). Homoplasious
peaks tended to exhibit higher fluorescence intensity
than non-homoplasious peaks (means ± sd: 6803 ± 3632

rfu and 4198 ± 3303 rfu respectively), but many nonhomoplasious peaks also exhibited high fluorescence, so
that peak intensity may not represent a valuable quality
criterion in detecting homoplasious peaks.
Predicting the AFLP profiles of non-model species

The number of fragments obtained in silico for three
model species, the bacterium B. thuringiensis ser.
konkukian, the plant A. thaliana and the insect Ae.
aegypti, was compared with that obtained for closely
related species, B. thuringiensis ser. israelensis, Arabis
alpina and Aedes rusticus, for which no full genome
sequences were available (Figure 3A). The details for each
model/non-model species pair and each primer combination are presented in Additional file 2.
For all species pairs, we found a positive, significant
relationship between the number of in silico fragments
and the average number of experimental fragments (Pearson's correlation: N = 6, r = 0.96, P = 0.003 for bacteria; N

= 19, r = 0.86, P < 0.001 for plants and N = 20, r = 0.86, P <
0.001 for mosquitoes). The number of fragments in A.
alpina tended to be larger than the number of in silico
fragments of A. thaliana. This difference was not surprising since the A. alpina genome (2n = 16) is larger than the
A. thaliana genome (2n = 10, [41]). For Bacillus and
Aedes, the relationship between model and non-model
species was close to a linear function with slope 1 and
intercept 0 for profiles with less than 150 peaks (Figure
3A). However in silico AFLP tended to over-estimate the
number of peaks in non-model species for primer combinations generating more than 150 peaks per profile (Figure 3A).
The distribution of peak length differed for all model/
non-model species pairs. For all non-model species, small
peaks (less than 70-100 bp depending on species) were
significantly below the number expected in silico in
model species (Figure 3B). For mosquitoes and plants,
large peaks (more than 300 bp) were also overestimated
in silico. This pattern was not present in Bacillus, probably because only few peaks are predicted in this range.

Discussion
Lessons of in silico AFLPs to detect homoplasy

The ISIF program allows to accurately predict AFLP profiles in model species using the genomic information
available. The correspondence between in silico and
empirical AFLP profiles has already been described for
simple model species of bacteria [42,43] and for the plant
A. thaliana [34].
The experimental AFLP procedure generated the peaks
predicted by the in silico analysis carried out using ISIF,
except for one long fragment (> 400 bp) insufficiently
amplified to be detectable on the electrophoresis profile.
However, this fragment was detected by pyrosequencing.
The decrease in AFLP peak intensity as peak length
increases is a well known phenomenon [28,44] illustrated
here (see Figure 1). In our profile, fluorescence showed a
decreasing intensity in high fragment lengths, except for
the 318 bp peak containing 6 co-migrating fragments
which exhibited much higher fluorescence intensity than
the peaks of similar length. This suggests that fluorescence intensity could be a good indicator for peaks containing many different co-migrating fragments. However,

detecting homoplasious peaks in an experimental AFLP
profile based on fluorescence intensity remains a challenge, because the intensity of a peak does not necessarily
reflect the actual number of different co-migrating fragments. For example, in the profile shown in Figure 1, the
113 bp peak contains two co-migrating fragments, but is
less intense than the 115 bp peak which is not homoplasious. Overall, in A. thaliana, the effect of homoplasy on
peak fluorescence intensity was not significant (Table 2).
This limitation in detecting a posteriori homoplasious
peaks in an experimental profile highlights the need to
develop tools to limit a priori the probability of generating homoplasious peaks. In silico AFLPs make it possible
to choose the best primer combinations prior to carrying
out the experimental procedure.
Homoplasy in model species

A high level of homoplasy was found when analyzing all
study species, ranging up to 69%. For all species,
homoplasy was highly dependent on the number of peaks
generated per profile. It was about 15% in profiles containing 50 peaks and as much as 25% in profiles containing 100 peaks. This is in the range of homoplasy
theoretically predicted by modeling the distribution of
fragment lengths and calculating homoplasy rates given
the fragment number in a profile [25], or experimentally
estimated in sugar beet (13%) [24]. Given that the aim of
most AFLP studies is to generate a large number of polymorphic markers at the lowest cost, many AFLP based
studies are likely to contain a large number of homoplasious peaks.
For a given number of selective bases, the number of
peaks per profile depends on genome size. To obtain a
50-peaks profile, a total of 3 selective bases are needed for
B. thuringiensis var konkukian, 5 - 6 for A. thaliana, and 6
- 7 for Ae. aegypti. Accordingly, Altholff et al. [13]
obtained 0 to 189 peaks per profile when carrying out in
silico AFLP with 6 selective bases primer combinations of
8 taxa with genome size ranging from 5.23 to 2900 Mb. In
their study, homoplasy ranged from 0% for bacteria with
profiles containing 0 or 1 peak to 49% for a human profile
containing 171 peaks. The authors concluded that
homoplasy is dependant on genome size. However, by
using the same primer combinations for all species, they
could not distinguish between the linked effects of
genome size and of the number of peaks per profile. In
our study, a large range of primer combinations adapted
for each species was used to obtain profiles containing at
least 5 to 260 peaks per species, allowing for discrimination between the effects of genome size and the number
of peaks. For a given number of peaks per profile, the
homoplasy rate (i.e. the proportion of peaks containing
co-migrating fragments) was apparently not related to
genome size or systematic position.

Page 9 of 13

However, homoplasious peaks can contain a larger
number of co-migrating fragments in large and complex
genomes. Furthermore, even if small length peaks are
more likely to be homoplasious than longer peaks as previously reported [12], our results suggest that this can be
not valid for peaks containing more than 10 fragments, as
we observed highly homoplasious peaks at almost any
length. The most frequent type of homoplasious peak is
made up of two or more fragments of different sequences,
co-migrating by chance. Small peaks are more likely to
belong to this type, because of the skewed fragment
length distribution (Figure 2A). Less frequently,
homoplasious peaks are made up of many highly repetitive sequences. This is more likely to be found in large
genomes, as they usually contain many repetitive
sequences, such as transposable elements [37,45]. For
example, an impressive 582 co-migrating, highly similar
fragments was found in Ae. aegypti. This is not completely unexpected as 47% of the Ae. aegypti genome consists of transposable elements which can exhibit up to
50,000 copies per genome [38,46]. A strategy that could
be used to avoid cutting in transposable elements is to use
restriction enzymes sensitive to DNA methylation,
because many transposable elements are known to be
silenced by methylation [47]. However, this strategy cannot be routinely recommended to AFLP users, because
transposable elements silencing is not only species
dependent, but also tissue-dependent.
All these results highlight the importance of the choice
of primer combination for the quality and the practical
usefulness of the AFLP profiles. Both the number and the
GC content of selective bases can have a strong effect on
the number of peaks per profile, and therefore on
homoplasy. In our case, the three genomes analyzed are
AT-rich, so that primers with AT selective bases generate
more peaks and therefore more homoplasious profiles.
Furthermore, some combinations generate a particularly
high homoplasy rate, or amplify repeated sequences.
Predicting the AFLP profiles of non-model species

The in silico AFLP profile obtained from the model species can help to predict the AFLP profiles obtained in
related species, for which complete genomic information
does not exist. For the three pairs of species analysed, we
observed a strong correlation between the predicted and
observed profiles. The correlation was particularly strong
between two varieties of the same species, Bacillus thuringiensis ser. konkukian and var israelensis, but remained
very strong between species of the same genus (Aedes)
and even between two species from different genera
(Arabidopsis and Arabis) and with different genome sizes
(two-fold difference [41]). In model species, the
homoplasy rate is strongly correlated to the profile quality (number and size distribution of peaks generated). As

Paris et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/287

non-model species profile quality is correlated to that
obtained in model species, the extent of homoplasy in
non-model species can be predicted from their profile
quality.
In silico AFLPs tended to over-estimate the number of
peaks expected in non-model species for profiles with
more than 150 peaks. This phenomenon has already been
described in the tetraploid species Damasonium alisma
that produced less AFLP peaks using a primer combination with 6 selective bases than using a primer combination with the same 6 selective bases plus an additional A,
T, G or C [29]. For the authors, many of the loci were
insufficiently amplified using the 6 selective bases primer
combination to produce peaks higher than the scoring
threshold and were therefore not scored. Indeed, the
decrease in the number of AFLP peaks scored in profiles
with a large number of peaks may be due to multiple
causes, including scoring errors in complex profiles
[48,49], competition across fragments during the amplification process [29], and the poor amplification of longer
fragments [28,44]. According to this later hypothesis, we
observed less large fragments (more than 300 bp) than
expected in all our in silico/experimental comparisons,
except for the Bacillus pair of species for which few large
fragments were expected. Furthermore, less small fragments than expected were observed in all our in silico/
experimental comparisons. This could be due to the loss
of small fragments during the purification step before
separation, although the purification protocol we used is
supposed to retain fragments larger than 30 bp; or they
could be lost during the electrophoresis separation.
Finally, the quality of sequences in published model
species genomes could be a further source of bias in the
number of peaks predicted with in silico AFLP. Indeed,
most available model genomes contain genotyping errors
or gaps represented by a series of Ns, even for the model
species A. thaliana. Finally, the fragmentation of most
large published genomes into thousands of scaffolds (for
example, the Ae. aegypti genome is composed of 4,768
supercontigs) may further bias the estimation of the
number of fragments amplified.
Recommendations

The optimization of the AFLP reaction (and especially
the choice of selective primers) is often achieved through
an empirical procedure. For instance, the polymorphism
and the reproducibility of markers are generally the most
important criteria on which the choice of AFLP primers
is based. However, such optimization procedures are
probably not able to avoid, in a reliable way, the occurrence of size homoplasy in AFLP profiles. Here we show
that ISIF allows a rapid screen of candidate restriction
enzymes and/or combinations of selective bases during
the optimization steps of the AFLP reaction. Low level of
homoplasy at the intra-individual level is likely to coin-

Page 10 of 13

cide with low level of homoplasy at the inter-individual
level. In silico AFLPs can be used to prevent homoplasy in
AFLP data sets and in turn, reduce biases in population
genetics, conservation of genetic resources or genome
scan analyses. In addition, the present study shows that
genomic sequences of model species can be used to predict AFLP profiles generated in related non-model species. Finally, ISIF represents a key tool to plan the number
of fragments to be sequenced in complex and costly high
throughout genomic experiments such as pyrosequencing, or to address further questions such as evaluating the
distribution of restriction fragments in genomes. We
conclude the present study with general suggestions on
the choice of primer combinations and the process for
peak selection. These suggestions in addition to recommendations made in Gort et al. [18] will help to improve
experimental AFLP studies on both model and nonmodel species.
• Primer combinations generating less than 30 AFLP
peaks per profile can help to limit homoplasy within a
profile. In practice, the total number of six selective
bases originally recommended by Vos et al. [5], generally used in most published studies, is insufficient in
preventing homoplasy in most plant and animal
genomes. In addition, the choice of selective bases
biased in GC content can reduce markedly the number of peaks generated for many species. Furthermore, the choice of restriction enzymes with high GC
content recognition sites is likely to reduce the number of restriction fragments for low GC content
genomes.
• If possible, primer combinations which amplify
repetitive sequences should be avoided.
• Peaks smaller than 100 bp in length can pose problems, as they can be responsible of more than one
third of homoplasy. Our analysis suggests that focusing on the longer fragments would help reduce this
issue.
• Peaks of large length that exhibit particularly high
fluorescence intensity compared to peaks of a similar
length in the same profile should be considered with
caution, as they often contain several non-homologous co-migrating fragments.
• The mean number of peaks per profile should
always be mentioned in AFLP studies to allow the
evaluation of the homoplasy rate within profiles.
Indeed, most of the published studies only mention
the total number of polymorphic peaks scored (but
see Meyer et al. [50]). However, this does not correspond to the number of peaks per profile, which
depends on the relatedness across individuals and on
the number of individuals genotyped. For example,
the analysis of a small number of individuals, of
related individuals or of poorly differentiated populations can lead to the identification of only a small total

Paris et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:287

number of polymorphic fragments, but with a large
number of fragments per profile.

Conclusions
Carrying out in silico analyses before the experimental
work allows a rapid screen of candidate restriction
enzymes and the combinations of selective bases to be
used, in order to optimize the experimental work. It can
also help to plan the number of fragments to be
sequenced in complex and costly high throughput
genomic experiments such as pyrosequencing. Most
importantly, in silico AFLP can help to limit homoplasy in
AFLP data sets, reducing biases in population genetics,
conservation of genetic resources or genome scan analyses. Finally, in silico analysis represents a key tool to
address further questions such as evaluating the distribution of restriction fragments in genomes.
Methods
In silico AFLPs on model species

Three model species for which the full genome sequences
are available were used in this study: Bacillus thuringiensis ser. konkukian, Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) and Aedes aegypti (Liverpool strain). Bacillus
thuringiensis ser. konkukian genome and plasmid were
obtained from GenBank (accession number AE017355
and CP000047), Arabidopsis thaliana genome was
obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource
http://www.arabidopsis.org, and Aedes aegypti genome
was obtained from VectorBase http://www.vectorbase.org. In silico AFLPs were performed on total
genomic DNA for A. thaliana and Ae. aegypti without
taking into account organellar genomes that are negligible in length in comparison to the nuclear genome [13].
For bacteria the length of the plasmidic genome is of significant length in the whole genome, therefore both
genomic DNA and plasmid DNA where used for B. thuringiensis ser. konkukian. For all in silico analyses, fragments between 50 and 500 pb were considered.
For B. thuringiensis ser. Konkukian, in silico AFLP profiles were generated using all possible combinations of
primers EcoRI/MseI: E+0/M+1, E+1/M+1 and E+1/M+2
(84 combinations). For the species A. thaliana and Ae.
aegypti, 100 EcoRI/MseI primer combinations were randomly chosen among combinations containing between 3
to 5 selective bases and 5 to 8 selective bases respectively
(Additional file 1). For each species, the number and the
sequence of the selective bases used for amplification
were chosen in order to generate less than 300 peaks per
profile. Producing profiles with more than 200 peaks is
unrealistic in practice but such situations were chosen
here to ensure a high homoplasy rate. For each in silico
profile, the number of non-identical fragments (i.e. fragments with different sequences or chromosomal positions) and the number of detectable peaks (i.e.

Page 11 of 13

regrouping all co-migrating fragments) were determined.
All statistical analyses were carried out using R software
version 2.5 [51].
We tested the effects of the number of peaks in profiles
and of species identity on H in a generalized linear model
(GLM) with a Quasibinomial error. Subsequently, for
each species we performed Pearson's correlation between
H and the number of peaks per profile, and between H
and peak length. The effects of the number of peaks in
profiles, peak length, species identity and composition of
selective bases (i.e. GC content) on the number of comigrating fragments in homoplasious peaks were tested
in a GLM; models with Poisson error distribution showed
evidence of overdispersion, therefore we used a negative binomial family to build models [52]. The effects of these
four parameters on the number of co-migrating fragments in homoplasious peaks were then tested in a GLM
including only peaks containing more than 10 co-migrating fragments. For GLMs, significance was calculated
using type-II analysis-of-variance using a F test (quasibinomial models) or a likelihood ratio test (negative-binomial models) [52].
Empirical AFLP profiles in a model species

The genome of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana
was used to validate the reliability of both experimental
AFLP and of the results of ISIF in silico AFLP. The advantage of using this selfing plant is that the published
genome (Ecotype Columbia) is identical to the genome of
all plants from this ecotype. An in silico profile using the
primer combination EcoRI+ATG/MseI+ATG was generated and compared with the corresponding experimental
AFLP profile. This primer combination was chosen
because in silico it generated two homoplasious peaks
(containing 2 and 6 co-migrating fragments, respectively). AFLP analyses were obtained according to Paris et
al. [53]. In short, 150 ng of the total genomic DNA was
first digested with 2 units of EcoRI (New England Biolabs) for 2.5 hours at 37°C, and then with 5 units of MseI
(New England Biolabs) in the same conditions. Specific
oligonucleotide adaptors were then ligated to the end of
the restriction fragments with 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase
(New England Biolabs) for 3 hours at 37°C. Pre-selective
and selective amplifications were performed with 0.2 μM
of primers complementary to the adaptor sequences after
20 times dilution of the digestion/ligation product and 10
times dilution of the pre-selective PCR product. Labeled
selective fragments were separated by electrophoresis on
an ABI 3130 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
AFLP patterns were then visualized with GeneMapper
V3.7 software (Applied Biosystems): a fluorescent peak
corresponds to the presence of an amplified restriction
fragment. A scoring threshold of 500 rfu in fluorescence
intensity was set up to detect peaks. For each sample, all
peaks between 50 and 500 pb were considered. Repro-

Paris et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/287

ducibility of the AFLP method was checked by carrying
out the whole AFLP protocol three times as recommended by Bonin et al. [48]. All peaks of the experimental AFLP profile were sequenced to confirm homology
among experimental and in silico fragments both in
length and in sequence using pyrosequencing 454 Life
Science and the GS 20 protocol (Roche Applied Science)
following the manufacturer's instructions.
In order to determine if homoplasious peaks can be
detected using their fluorescence intensity, we used 7
primer combinations (E+ATG/M+ATG, E+GC/M+GC,
E+AAT/M+CAC, E+ATG/M+CTC, E+AGG/M+CAC,
E+ATG/M+CAA, E+AGG/M+CAA) chosen because
they produce in silico homoplasious peaks. A GLM with a
negative -binomial family model was then used to test the
effects of peak size and of homoplasy on peak intensity.
Predictions of in silico AFLPs to non-model species

For the comparison between model and non-model species, the in silico AFLP profile prediction for model species was performed on 6 primer combinations EcoRI/
MseI for B. thuringiensis ser. konkukian, 7 primer combinations EcoRI/MseI and 12 primer combinations PstI/
MseI for A. thaliana, and 20 primer combinations EcoRI/
MseI for Ae. aegypti (Additional file 2). Three non-model
species were used for these analyses: the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis ser. israelensis of worldwide origin [54],
the plant Arabis alpina collected from the Alps (France
and Switzerland), and the mosquito Aedes rusticus collected in the Rhône-Alps region (France). For B. thuringiensis ser. israelensis, total genomic DNA was extracted
from overnight culture at 27°C of isolated bacterial
strains using the DNeasy tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the
Gram positive bacteria protocol. Total genomic DNA was
extracted from leaves of A. alpina using the DNeasy Plant
Kit (Qiagen) and from larvae of Ae. rusticus and using the
DNeasy tissue Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
All the experimental AFLP profiles were generated
using the protocol described above, and using the same
primer combinations described in the in silico analyses.
Finally, experimental profiles were generated on 2 - 23
individuals depending on the primer combinationfor B.
thuringiensis ser. israelensis, on 123 - 728 A. alpina
plants, and on 2 - 279 Ae. rusticus larvae. For each pair of
model/non-model species, a Pearson's correlation
between the number of AFLP fragments obtained in silico
and experimental AFLP profiles was performed. We also
compared the fragment length distribution for each pair
of model/non model species using GLMs on peak frequencies. Peaks were categorized by groups of 20 bplength, and a GLM was performed for each of the 23
groups, with 'model' or 'non-model' as fixed effect.
