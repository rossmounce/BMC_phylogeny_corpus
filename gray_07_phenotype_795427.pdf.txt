Abstract
Background: The Sydney blood bank cohort (SBBC) of long-term survivors consists of multiple individuals
infected with attenuated, nef-deleted variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) acquired from a
single source. Long-term prospective studies have demonstrated that the SBBC now comprises slow progressors
(SP) as well as long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). Convergent evolution of nef sequences in SBBC SP and LTNP
indicates the in vivo pathogenicity of HIV-1 in SBBC members is dictated by factors other than nef. To better
understand mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of nef-deleted HIV-1, we examined the phenotype and env
sequence diversity of sequentially isolated viruses (n = 2) from 3 SBBC members.
Results: The viruses characterized here were isolated from two SP spanning a three or six year period during
progressive HIV-1 infection (subjects D36 and C98, respectively) and from a LTNP spanning a two year period
during asymptomatic, nonprogressive infection (subject C18). Both isolates from D36 were R5X4 phenotype and,
compared to control HIV-1 strains, replicated to low levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In
contrast, both isolates from C98 and C18 were CCR5-restricted. Both viruses isolated from C98 replicated to
barely detectable levels in PBMC, whereas both viruses isolated from C18 replicated to low levels, similar to those
isolated from D36. Analysis of env by V1V2 and V3 heteroduplex tracking assay, V1V2 length polymorphisms,
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed distinct intra- and inter-patient env evolution.
Conclusion: Independent evolution of env despite convergent evolution of nef may contribute to the in vivo
pathogenicity of nef-deleted HIV-1 in SBBC members, which may not necessarily be associated with changes in
replication capacity or viral coreceptor specificity.

Background
The Sydney blood bank cohort (SBBC) of long-term survivors (LTS) consists of multiple individuals who became
infected with an attenuated strain of HIV-1 via contaminated blood products from a common blood donor
between 1981 and 1984 [1-3]. Viral attenuation has been
attributed to gross deletions in the nef and nef/long-terminal repeat (LTR) overlapping regions of the HIV-1
genome. Despite being infected from a single source,
long-term prospective studies on SBBC members demonstrated that the cohort now consists of subjects with slow
disease progression (SP), as well as individuals who
remain true long-term nonprogressors (LTNP) and
antiretroviral therapy-naive with stable CD4 counts and
low or undetectable HIV-1 RNA levels [4]. Three SBBC
members (one SP and two LTNP) have since died from
causes unrelated to HIV-1 infection [3,4]. Although the
cohort members had differing clinical courses, a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of nef/LTR sequences in the
SBBC donor and four of the transfusion recipients demonstrated a convergent pattern of nef sequence evolution,
characterized by progressive sequence deletions evolving
toward a minimal nef/LTR structure that retains only the
key sequence elements that are required for viral replication [4]. Thus, HIV-1 pathogenicity in SBBC members is
dictated by viral and/or host determinants other than
those that impose a unidirectional selection pressure on
the nef/LTR region of the HIV-1 genome.
The HIV-1 env gene, which encodes the viral envelope
glycoproteins (Env) is a significant viral determinant in
HIV-1 pathogenesis [reviewed in [5-7]]. HIV-1 Env initiates viral entry via binding to CD4 and subsequently to a
coreceptor, either CCR5 [8-12] or CXCR4 [13]. CCR5using (R5) HIV-1 strains predominate at early, asymptomatic stages of infection. In 40–50% of infected adults,
progression of HIV-1 infection is accompanied by a switch
in coreceptor specificity to HIV-1 variants able to use
CXCR4 or both CCR5 and CXCR4 for entry (X4 or R5X4
strains, respectively) [14,15]. A switch in the specificity of
HIV-1 Env from R5 to X4 or R5X4 is considered an indicator of poor prognosis, partly because it increases the
number of CD4+ cells that are susceptible to cytolytic
infection by HIV-1, and is associated with rapid progression of HIV-1 infection. R5 HIV-1 variants are present
exclusively in the remaining 50–60% of infected individuals who progress to AIDS, without switching coreceptor
specificity [16,17], and exert pathogenic effects that contribute to HIV-1 progression via mechanisms that remain
poorly understood [5]. Thus, changes in HIV-1 env that
affect viral tropism are important for progression of HIV1 infection.
Analysis of inter- and intra-host evolution of env sequence
has provided important insights relevant for HIV-1 trans-

mission and progression. While several reports showed an
inverse relationship between the rate and extent of viral
diversification and progression of HIV-1 infection [1825], other studies demonstrated that disease progression
is associated with increasing rates of viral diversity [2628]. A later study made significant headway in reconciling
these conflicting studies by identifying 3 distinct phases of
HIV-1 env sequence diversity and divergence during the
asymptomatic period preceding the development of AIDS
[29]; an early phase of variable duration with linear
increases (approximately 1% per year) in both viral divergence and diversity; an intermediate phase characterized
by a continued increase in viral divergence but with a stabilisation or decline in viral diversity; and a late phase
characterized by a stabilisation of viral divergence and a
continued stability or decline in viral diversity. The emergence of X4 HIV-1 variants often coincided with transition
between the early and intermediate phases. More recent
studies identified convergent sequence evolution in env
during the early phase toward a common ancestral
sequence [30], suggesting that HIV-1 recovers certain
ancestral features early in HIV-1 infection that most likely
serve to restore viral fitness. However, other studies examining HIV-1 progression in individuals harbouring only
R5 variants showed an increase in viral diversity in viral
isolates obtained from patients with AIDS compared to
isolates from asymptomatic individuals [31], raising the
possibility that selection pressures driving HIV-1 evolution may be distinct in patients who maintain R5 viral variants compared to those who experience a coreceptor
switch.
While the viral determinants underlying the pathogenicity
of nef-deleted HIV-1 strains harbored by SBBC members
are presently unknown, several lines of evidence support
the hypothesis that evolution of HIV-1 env contributes to
disease progression in this cohort; 1) compartmentalized
evolution of HIV-1 V3 env sequence in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) of the SBBC donor was shown to contribute to the
development of HIV-associated dementia (HIVD) [32]; 2)
enhanced cell killing in ex vivo human tissue cultures by
HIV-1 isolates from the same SBBC subject was predicted
to result from more efficient coreceptor usage [33]; and 3)
increased Env-mediated fusion was shown to increase the
in vivo pathogenicity of nef-deleted simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [34].
To better understand the role of HIV-1 env in the pathogenesis of nef-deleted HIV-1 strains harbored by SBBC
members, we examined the phenotype and env sequence
diversity of sequential viruses isolated from 3 SBBC members. Isolates from the SBBC "donor" (subject D36; SP)
were R5X4 phenotype and replicated to low levels in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In contrast,
isolates from 2 SBBC "recipients" (subjects C98 and C18;

SP and LTNP, respectively) were CCR5-restricted with variable replication kinetics. Analysis of env by V1V2 and V3
heteroduplex tracking assay, V1V2 length polymorphisms, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed
distinct intra- and inter-patient env evolution. Thus, independent evolution of env despite convergent evolution of
nef may contribute to the in vivo pathogenicity of nefdeleted HIV-1 in SBBC members, which may not necessarily be associated with changes in replication capacity or
viral coreceptor specificity.

Results and discussion
Subjects
The clinical history of the study subjects, results of laboratory studies and antiretroviral therapies have been
described in detail previously [3,4,32]. The results of laboratory studies relevant for the HIV-1 isolates used in this
study are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, the SBBC donor,
subject D36 presented with HIVD in December 1998 after
being infected with HIV-1 for 18 years without antiretroviral therapy. The development of HIVD coincided with a
fall in the CD4 cell count to <200 cells/μl and the presence
of high plasma and CSF HIV-1 RNA levels. The subject was
placed on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
regimen of abacavir, nevirapine and zidovidine in January
1999, which suppressed plasma and CSF viral loads to
below detectable levels and resolved the symptoms of
HIVD [32,35]. As reported previously, transfusion recipient C98 commenced HAART in November 1999 after 16
years of HIV-1 infection, following a steady decline in
CD4+ T-cells and a gradual increase in HIV-1 RNA from
below detectable levels to 1500 RNA copies/ml [3,4]. He
died in March 2002 of amyloidosis, which was not HIV-1
related. Likewise, transfusion recipient C18 died in 1995
of causes unrelated to HIV-1 infection. C18 remained
antiretroviral therapy naive despite 12 years of infection,
with stable CD4 cell counts and low plasma HIV-1 RNA
levels [3]. Thus, subjects D36 and C98 showed evidence of

slow progression while subject C18 remained a long-term
nonprogressor.
HIV-1 isolated from PBMC on 2 consecutive occasions
was used in this study (Table 1). The time between isolations ranged from 2 to 6 years. For the purpose of this
report, the initial isolates are referred to as "early" isolates,
and the subsequent isolates are referred to as "late" isolates (designated "E" and "L", respectively).
Replication kinetics
We first examined the capacity of the HIV-1 isolates to replicate in PHA-activated PBMC (Fig. 1). The R5 ADA and
R5X4 89.6 HIV-1 strains were included as positive controls, and replicated rapidly to high levels peaking at day
7 post-infection (Fig. 1A). Both D36E and D36L viruses
replicated to comparatively low levels, with similar kinetics as ADA and 89.6 (Fig. 1B). Both C18 viruses replicated
with similar kinetics, but peak levels of replication by
C18L were modestly higher (approximately 2-fold) than
those achieved by C18E (Fig. 1D). In contrast, replication
of C98E and C98L viruses was barely detectable (Fig. 1C).
Since D36 and C98 were slow progressors and C18 was a
LTNP, there was no association between replication kinetics of HIV-1 isolates in PBMC and disease progression in
the study subjects. However, the results highlight the heterogeneity in replication capacity by nef-deleted HIV-1
strains isolated from multiple subjects infected from a single source.
Coreceptor usage
The results of the preceding experiments suggest the existence of additional phenotypic changes that may contribute to altered replication capacity in PBMC. We therefore
compared the coreceptor usage of HIV-1 isolates in Cf2Luc cells (Fig. 2). The R5 ADA and R5X4 89.6 strains were
included as positive controls and used CCR5 or both
CCR5 and CXCR4 for virus entry, respectively (Fig. 2A), as
expected [9,11,36]. Consistent with results of previous

studies [32], D36E and D36L viruses were dual tropic and
used CCR5 and CXCR4 for virus entry (Fig. 2B). C98E,
C98L, C18E and C18L viruses used CCR5 only for virus
entry. Replication of dual tropic D36E and D36L viruses
in PBMC was abolished by preincubation of cells with the
CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 [37,38], but was unaffected
by the CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779 [39] (data not shown).
This suggests that the viral quasispecies in D36 isolates are
not a mixture containing R5 variants, and confirms previous studies that showed infection of PBMC by R5X4
viruses occurs primarily via CXCR4 [40]. Thus, D36 isolates are of R5X4 phenotype, and C18 and C98 isolates are
of R5 phenotype. These results indicate that the presence
of a functional nef gene is not required for HIV-1 to
undergo a switch in coreceptor preference from R5 to
R5X4. However, since D36 harbored R5X4 variants with-

out antiretroviral therapy while remaining asymptomatic
for at least 4 years (Table 1), the results suggest that acquisition of an R5X4 phenotype is not sufficient for rapid disease progression in the absence of nef. Moreover, the fact
that C98 maintained an R5 virus that replicated poorly in
PBMC, despite evidence of disease progression, suggests
that nef-deleted viruses may acquire increased pathogenicity in vivo by mechanism(s) that are not necessarily associated with changes in coreceptor usage or enhanced
replicative capacity in vitro.
V1V2 and V3 HTA analysis
Changes in the dominant viral quasispecies may serve to
augment HIV-1 pathogenicity in vivo without increasing
replication capacity or changing coreceptor preference in
vitro [5]. Therefore, to determine whether distinct viral

variants are present in early and late D36, C18 and C98
viruses, Env V1V2 and V3 HTA analyses were conducted.
The V1V2 and V3 HTAs were conducted using [32P]labelled probes generated from the R5 ADA Env or the X4
NL4-3 Env (Figs. 3 and 4; left and right panels, respectively). HTA negative controls consisted of reactions containing probe alone or mixed with homologous,
unlabelled target DNA to identify homoduplexes. HTA
positive controls consisted of ADA probe in reactions containing unlabelled NL4-3 or 89.6 Env (Figs. 3 and 4; left
panels), or NL4-3 probe in reactions containing unla-

belled ADA or 89.6 Env (Fig. 3 and 4, right panels) to
identify heteroduplexes. V1V2 HTAs using either probe
demonstrated that C98L contained 2 dominant variants
that were distinct from the single, dominant species found
in C98E (Fig. 3). Similarly, V1V2 HTAs with either probe
demonstrated 2 dominant variants in D36L that were distinct from 4 variants found in D36E. V1V2 HTAs using the
NL4-3 probe demonstrated 3 variants in C18L that were
distinct from 4 variants found in C18E. However, the ADA
probe appeared to be less sensitive for detecting distinct
V1V2 variants in C18E and C18L viruses. In addition to
the presence of distinct V1V2 heteroduplexes between

Virology Journal 2007, 4:75

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/75

viruses isolated from individuals, V1V2 heteroduplexes
were also distinct between subjects.
The V3 heteroduplex patterns also demonstrated distinct
viral variants using either probe (Fig. 4). However, the resolution of V3 heteroduplexes was more readily achieved
using the NL4-3 probe. V3 HTAs demonstrated 4 major
variants in C18L that were distinct from a single variant
present in C18E; 2 major variants in C98L that were distinct from a single major variant present in C98E; and 2
major variants in D36L that were distinct from 2 major
variants present in D36E. Similar to results of the V1V2
HTAs (Fig. 3), the V3 heteroduplexes also appeared to be
distinct between subjects. Together, the results of the
V1V2 and V3 HTAs suggest significant inter- and intrapatient evolution of HIV-1 Env. In contrast to convergent
sequence evolution previously reported for HIV-1 nef in
the study subjects [4], the V1V2 and V3 HTA results suggest independent evolution of HIV-1 Env.
V1V2 length polymorphism analysis
The V1V2 region of HIV-1 Env contains extensive length
polymorphisms, which can be utilized to compare the
genetic relationships between different viral populations
[41]. Furthermore, V2 region extensions have been associated with slow progression or long-term nonprogression
of HIV-1 infection [23,42]. We further investigated the
extent of HIV-1 Env diversity in SBBC viral isolates by
measuring V1V2 length polymorphisms using GeneScan
assay (Fig. 5). Although GeneScan analysis is unable to
discriminate between distinct V1V2 variants of the same
length which contain discrete amino acid substitutions, it
has the sensitivity to detect a single nucleotide (nt) deletion or insertion within PCR products [41]. D36E virus
contained 2 dominant V1V2 length polymorphisms

measuring 271 and 277 nt, whereas D36L virus contained
one dominant species measuring 280 nt and 4 minor species measuring 255, 268, 269 and 277 nt (Fig. 5). C98E
and C98L viruses each contained single, dominant V1V2
length polymorphisms measuring 241 and 267 nt, respectively. C18E virus contained a single, dominant V1V2
length polymorphism measuring 241 nt, which was identical in nt length to the dominant species detected in C98E
virus. However, C18L contained 5 distinct V1V2 length
polymorphisms measuring 240, 247, 249, 250 and 252
nt. Thus, in each study subject, late viruses contained variants with V1V2 nt lengths that were distinct from those
detected in early viruses.
These results suggest that significant evolution of V1V2
Env occurred in each of the study subjects, an interpretation supported also by results of the V1V2 HTA analysis
(Fig. 3). That C18E and C98E viruses contained dominant
variants with identical V1V2 nt length raises the possibility that these 2 subjects once harboured Env variants with
some shared features. However, the increase in number of
V1V2 length polymorphisms in D36L and C18L viruses
compared to D36E and C18E viruses, respectively, the
shift in dominant V1V2 length polymorphism in C98
viruses, and the lack of overlap between V1V2 length variants detected in D36L, C98L and C18L viruses suggests
divergent evolution of HIV-1 Env in these SBBC study subjects. In contrast to previous studies [23,42], long-term
survival of HIV-1 infection in these subjects was not associated with increased V1V2 nt length. Furthermore, significant increases in V1V2 nt length diversity were observed
in late viruses from a SP (D36) and a LTNP (C18) compared to respective early viruses, and no increase in V1V2
nt length diversity was observed in late virus from a SP
(C98); this suggests that divergent evolution of HIV-1 Env

in the study subjects was neither necessary nor sufficient
for disease progression.
Sequence analysis
The preceding studies showed differences in phenotype
between D36, C98 and C18 viruses and evidence of divergent Env sequence evolution. However, an association
between disease progression and results of phenotypic or
genetic studies could not be made. To determine the
genetic basis underlying differences in viral phenotype,
and to better understand Env sequence changes which
may contribute to HIV-1 progression in SBBC members,
the gp120 region of Env was cloned and the V1 to V3
region of multiple, independent Envs sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of interpatient sequence sets showed
monophyletic clustering of D36 Env sequences (Fig. 6).
The majority of C98 and C18 Env sequences clustered separately, but 1 C18 Env (C18L.3) clustered with C98 Envs,
suggesting the presence of shared sequence similarities.
This is not unexpected, since C18 and C98 were infected
with a closely related HIV-1 strain and, unlike D36 whose
virus had a coreceptor switch (Fig. 2), both C18 and C98
continued to harbor less evolved R5 variants. Analysis of
intrapatient sequence sets showed that the majority of

C18E and C98E clones cosegregated separately from C18L
and C98L clones, respectively. However, clear cosegregation of D36E and D36L Envs in the monophyletic D36
cluster was not evident. Since phylogenetic analysis
ignores sequence insertions and deletions, this suggests
that Env sequence evolution in D36 may primarily
involve nucleotide insertions and/or deletions rather than
discrete substitutions.
Multiple sequence alignments of the V1V2 and V3 regions
of Envs cloned from each virus are shown in Fig. 7A and
7B, respectively. The net charge of the V3 regions of D36E
and D36L clones was +6, and the net charge of the V3
regions of C98E, C98L, C18E and C18L clones was +2 or
+3. Consistent with results obtained in coreceptor usage
assays with HIV-1 isolates (Fig. 2), coreceptor usage based
on net V3 charge using the sinsi matrix [43] predicts D36E
and D36L clones to be R5X4 phenotype, and C98E, C98L,
C18E and C18L clones to be R5 phenotype. Although the
presence of a basic residue at position 11 or 25 in V3 is

Virology Journal 2007, 4:75

strongly associated with CXCR4 usage [44,45], all D36E
and D36L clones lacked basic residues at either position.
Therefore, although D36E and D36L viruses are R5X4
phenotype in transfected Cf2th cells and use CXCR4 for
HIV-1 entry into PBMC (data not shown), CXCR4 use for
HIV-1 entry was not determined by the presence of
charged amino acids at positions 11 or 25. Recently, the
presence of isoleucine at amino acid 326 in V3, or proline
or cysteine residues in V1 was shown to be important for
macrophage (M) tropism of the R5X4 HIV-1 89.6 strain
and other blood-derived, M-tropic R5X4 viruses [46]. In
support of these results, D36E and D36L Envs lack these
genetic changes, and the primary isolates replicate poorly
in cultures of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM)
compared to 89.6 [47].
The base of the V1V2 stem contains a highly conserved
potential N-linked glycosylation site in the CNTS
sequence of NL4-3 (Fig. 7A), which is present in all but
seven of 208 clade B HIV-1 Env sequences screened from
the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV Database [48].

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/75

One of 3 D36E clones and 2/3 D36L clones lacked a
potential N-linked glycosylation site at this position (Fig.
7A). Similarly, the glycosylation site at this position was
lacking in 1/3 C98E and 1/3 C98L clones. In contrast, the
glycosylation site at the V1V2 stem was conserved among
all C18E and C18L clones, and in contrast to D36 and C98
clones there was a high degree of sequence homology in
this region to that of NL4-3. Elimination of a glycosylation site at this position is sufficient for CD4-independent
infection by HIV-1 ADA, achieved by altering the position
of the V1V2 loops and exposing the coreceptor binding
site in gp120 [49-52]. Thus, alterations in glycosylation at
the V1V2 stem may serve to enhance receptor binding,
which could contribute to HIV-1 pathogenicity at later
stages of HIV-1 infection. To this end, it is interesting to
note that Env clones lacking this glycosylation site were
present only in SBBC slow progressors (D36 and C98),
whereas the glycosylation site was present in all Envs from
the LTNP (C18). Further sequence analysis of a greater
number of Env clones is required to determine the significance of this sequence change in SBBC SPs and LTNPs. In

addition, further studies to biologically characterize these
Envs are required to determine whether SBBC Envs exhibit
functional changes that could potentially contribute to
HIV-1 pathogenicity.

Conclusion
In this study, we analyzed the phenotype and Env
sequences of HIV-1 present in 3 SBBC members who were
slow progressors or long-term nonprogressors. Early and
late viruses from D36 were R5X4 whereas viruses isolated
from C98 and C18 remained CCR5-restricted, indicating
that a coreceptor switch was neither necessary nor sufficient for disease progression in these subjects. Replication
capacity of these viruses in PBMC ranged from rapid to
barely detectable and was not associated with disease progression. Although SBBC subjects had evidence of convergent evolution of nef sequence [4], analysis of Env
diversity by V1V2 and V3 HTA, V1V2 length polymorphism assay, and maximum likelihood phylogeny suggest
that Env sequence evolution was divergent in SP and
LTNP subjects. Our results suggest that evolution toward
a pathogenic Env phenotype may occur in long-term survivors infected with nef-deleted HIV-1, which is not necessarily associated with changes in replication capacity or
coreceptor usage, or degree of Env sequence diversity.

Methods
Isolation of HIV-1
HIV-1 was isolated from patient's PBMC by coculture with
selected PBMC according to published methods [36].
Briefly, 2 × 106 patient PBMC were mixed with 10 × 106
PHA-activated PBMC from 2 normal uninfected donors,
and cocultured for 28 days in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 20 U/ml
interleukin-2 (IL-2). Fifty percent media changes were performed twice weekly. Five million PHA-activated PBMC
from a different donor were added at every second media
change. Supernatants were tested for reverse transcriptase
(RT) activity using [33P]dTTP incorporation as described
previously [53]. Supernatants testing positive for RT activity were filtered through 0.45 μm filters and stored at 80°C.
HIV-1 replication kinetics
Five hundred thousand PHA-activated PBMC were
infected in 48-well tissue culture plates by incubation
with 1 × 106 [33P] cpm RT units of virus supernatant in a
volume of 250 μl for 3 h at 37°C, as described previously
[32,54]. Virus was then removed, and PBMC were washed
3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% (vol/vol)
FCS and 20 U/ml IL-2 for 27 days. Fifty percent medium
changes were performed twice weekly, and supernatants
were tested for HIV-1 replication by RT assays on days 1,
7, 14, 21 and 28 post-infection.

Coreceptor usage
Coreceptor usage by primary HIV-1 isolates was determined using Cf2-Luc cells expressing CD4 alone, or
expressing CD4 together with CCR5 or CXCR4, as
described previously [32,36,54,55]. Briefly, Cf2-Luc cells
were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid pcDNA3-CD4 and
20 μg of plasmid pcDNA3 containing CCR5 or CXCR4
using the calcium phosphate method, and infected 48 h
later by incubation with 1 × 106 [33P] cpm RT units of HIV1 in the presence of 2 μg of Polybrene (Sigma) per ml.
After overnight infection, virus was removed and the cells
were cultured for an additional 48 h prior to lysis in 200
μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Cell
lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and assayed for
luciferase activity (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
V1V2 and V3 HTA
The V1V2 probes were generated by PCR amplification of
a 282 bp fragment of the HIV-1 ADA or NL4-3 Env using
primers SK122 (5'-CAAGCCTAAAGCCATGTGTA-3'; corresponding to nucleotide positions 6561 to 6580 of NL43) and SK123 (5'-TAATGTATGGGAATTGGCTCAA-3'; corresponding to nucleotide positions 6822 to 6843 of NL43). The V3 probes were generated by PCR amplification of
a 239 bp fragment of the HIV-1 ADA or NL4-3 Env using
primers V3c (5'-CCATAATAGTACAGCTGAATG-3'; corresponding to nucleotide positions 7062 to 7081 of NL4-3)
and V3d (5'-ATTTCTGGGTCCCCTCCTGAGGATTG-3';
corresponding to nucleotide positions 7276 to 7301 of
NL4-3). Labelling was achieved by incorporation of α[32P]-dCTP in the PCR, which consisted of an initial
denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of
95°C for 30 sec, 52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min followed by a final extension step of 72°C for 7 min. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a QIAquick
spin column (Qiagen). The V1V2 and V3 Env target DNA
sequences were generated from genomic DNA of PBMC
infected with each primary HIV-1 isolate by PCR using
primers SK122/SK123 and V3c/V3d, respectively.
Genomic DNA of PBMC infected with HIV-1 ADA, NL4-3
or 89.6 was used as controls. PCR reactions proceeded as
described above, except that radiolabelled dCTP was not
included. Amplimers were purified using a QIAquick spin
column (Qiagen). Heteroduplex reactions were performed as described previously [21] with the following
modifications. The reactions consisted of 1× annealing
buffer [1 M NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5), 20 mM
EDTA], 5 μl unlabelled V1V2 or V3 target PCR product,
and 2.5 μl labelled V1V2 or V3 probe. The reactions were
denatured at 95°C for 4 min and then allowed to anneal
on wet ice for 5 min. The heteroduplexes were separated
in 5.5% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-borateEDTA buffer, and were visualized by autoradiography of
dried HTA gels.

V1V2 length polymorphism analysis
V1V2 length polymorphisms in HIV-1 Env were quantified using a fluorescent-based assay that has been
described in detail previously [41]. This technique measures HIV-1 sequence diversity by taking advantage of frequent length polymorphisms that occur within the V1V2
region of HIV-1 Env, and has the sensitivity to detect a single nucleotide deletion or insertion. Briefly, the V1V2
region of HIV-1 Env was amplified from genomic DNA of
PBMC infected with each primary HIV-1 isolate by nested
PCR using outer primers V12-51 and V12-52, and inner
primers V12-50 and V12-53, as described previously [41].
The V12-50 primer used in the second round PCR was
labelled with a fluorophore, 6-carboxy-fluorescien, at the
5' end (PE Biosystems). PCR amplified, fluorescently
labelled products were purified using QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen), separated in 6% (wt/vol) denaturing
polyacrylamide gels using an automated sequencer (ABI
PRISM 377; PE Biosystems) and analysed using GeneScan
software (PE Biosystems). Peaks with areas <10% of the
total peak area were considered not significant, as
described previously [56]. The fraction of sequences in the
viral quasispecies with a given nucleotide length was calculated from GeneScan data and plotted against nucleotide length, as described previously [57].

Env cloning, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
A 2.1 kb fragment of HIV-1 Env (corresponding to nucleotide positions 6332 to 8452 in NL4-3) was amplified from
genomic DNA of PBMC infected with each primary HIV-1
isolate by nested PCR using outer primers env1A and
env1M [58], and inner primers envKpnI and envBamHI
[59], as described previously [60], and cloned into pGEMT Easy (Promega). The V1 to V3 region of 2 to 3 independent Envs cloned from each primary HIV-1 isolate was
sequenced using a SequiTherm EXCEL II DNA sequencing
kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) and a model
4000L LI-COR DNA sequencer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).
Nucleotide sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW and
corrected by hand. Phylogeny was estimated by a maximum likelihood algorithm (DNAml) with a transition/
transversion ratio of 2.0, empirical base frequencies, and
a randomised input order of sequences. Bootstrap values
were calculated from 100 resamplings of the same alignment using Seqboot.
