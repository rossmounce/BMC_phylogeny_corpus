influenza virus

Abstract
Background: Rapid diagnosis and surveillance for H5 subtype viruses are critical for the control of H5N1 infection.
Results: In this study, H5 Dot ELISA, a rapid test for the detection of avian H5N1 influenza virus, was developed
with two complementary H5 monoclonal antibodies. HA sequencing of escape mutants followed by epitope
mapping revealed that the two Mabs target the epitope component (189th amino acid) on the HA protein but are
specific for different amino acids (189Lys or 189Arg). Gene alignment indicated that these two amino acids are the
most frequent types on this position among all of the H5 AIV reported in GeneBank. These two H5 Mabs were
used together in a dot ELISA to detect H5 viral antigen. The detection limit of the developed test for multiple
clades of H5N1 viruses, including clades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7, and 8, was less than 0.5 hemagglutinin units. The
specificity of the optimized dot ELISA was examined by using 100 H5 strains, including H5N1 HPAI strains from
multiple clades, 36 non-H5N1 viruses, and 4 influenza B viruses. No cross-reactivity was observed for any of the
non-H5N1 viruses tested. Among 200 random poultry samples, the test gave 100% positive results for all of the
twelve RT-PCR-positive samples.
Conclusions: Considering that the test is convenient for field use, this H5 Dot ELISA can be used for on-site
detection of H5N1 infection in clinical or environmental specimens and facilitate the investigation of H5N1
influenza outbreaks and surveillance in poultry.

Background
Influenza A virus is classified into subtypes H1 to H16
and N1 to N9 based on the antigenic specificity of
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The 16
HA subtypes of the influenza viruses found in aquatic
birds act as the carrier (reservoir) of all avian influenza
virus A [1]. Only two influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and
H3N2) are currently circulating in the human population, while H5 and H7 are the most malignant, causing
death in avian species [2]. The emergence of the H5N1
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus caused
highly contagious and deadly disease outbreaks in poultry in several Asian countries, including China, Indonesia, Cambodia, Japan, Korea, Laos, Thailand, and

Vietnam [3-5]. Recently, the H5N1 virus has been
shown to spread incessantly to many regions all over
the world [6]. Most of these outbreaks were confined to
poultry, but the virus was reported to be transmitted to
humans in a few countries and most of these cases lead
to death in infected human. Despite the comparatively
small number of human cases, this situation warrants
careful monitoring. Of foremost concern is the risk that
conditions in parts of Asia could give rise to an influenza pandemic [7]. As of August 2010, there have been
totally 505 cases of confirmed H5N1 infection in
humans, resulting in 300 fatalities [8].
Rapid and sensitive laboratory and field tests for the
diagnosis of H5N1 HPAI infection are essential for disease control [9]. Conventional laboratory methods for
H5N1 virus detection include virus isolation in embryonated eggs or Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
cells, followed by subsequent HA and NA subtype identification using serological methods [10,11]. Molecular

detection methods such as reverse transcriptase PCR
(RT-PCR) have been widely applied for the laboratory
diagnosis of influenza infections and HA subtype identification [12,13]. However, these methods are technically
demanding and time consuming, or requiring high level
biosafety facility. Therefore, antigen detection based on
serologic methods has repeatedly shown its value to
diagnose various infectious diseases.
The development of a panel of broad spectrum
H5-specific monoclonal antibodies used in rapid antigen
tests allows to differentiate H5 subtype from other HA
types in the field. Detection of H5 antigen provides
strong evidence of H5 avian influenza virus infection
[14]. Monoclonal antibody (Mab) based diagnostic antigen detection tests for H5 AIV have been reported.
Monoclonal antibodies are a homogenous population of
antibodies, derived from a single antibody-producing
cell whereby all antibodies produced are identical and of
the same specificity for a given epitope [15]. The specificity of these Mabs responses provides a basis for an
effective diagnostic reagent [16]. However, as an RNA
virus, AIV tends to change its antigenic structure during
evolution. Antigenic drift leads to hemagglutinin variants within each HA subtype from different globe
regions at different times. Certain Mabs that specifically
target a given HA epitope of one type AIV, may not be
able to recognize other AIV strains with a mutated antigenic epitope even if such a mutation is slight. Therefore, using one single Mab for H5 AIV antigen
detection, in most cases, will not cover all the H5
subtype AIV circulating world around. Here we report
the development of an antigen-capture dot ELISA based
on a pair of Mabs targeting the same epitope on H5,
however, by two different and dominant amino acids
respectively, in an attempt to make a universal H5 AIV
rapid detection test.

Results
Identification of monoclonal antibodies recognizing
complementary epitopes on H5 hemagglutinin

A panel of Mabs against influenza hemagglutinin was
screened for efficient detection of different strains of
H5N1 viruses. Based on the results of the HI assay,
Mabs 6B8 and 4C2 were chosen for further studies due
to their high HI activity (Table 1) against a wide range
of rescued reassortant viruses from different clades.
Both Mabs were found to be of the IgM isotype. After
the virus neutralizing activity has been confirmed (data
not shown), the amino acids involved in forming the
epitopes of the Mabs were analyzed using escape mutant
analysis. All HA amino acid numbering in this work
uses H5 numbering excluding the signal peptide. Upon
sequencing escape mutants from 3 different parental
strains (Table 2), a few mutant clones of Mab 6B8

showed mutations at either Lys189 or Asn155, while
clones of Mab 4C2 presented mutations at Arg189,
Ser155 or Asn155. The results indicated that the 189th
and 155th amino acids were involved in the epitopes of
both Mabs, but in different forms. Mab 6B8 is able to
bind to H5 with either Lys189 or Asn155 independently.
Mab 4C2 binds to Arginine on 189th amino acid of H5,
and it recognizes both Serine and Asparagine at position
155.
In order to determine the significance of the two epitopes of 6B8 and 4C2, the protein polymorphism of H5
was studied, taking into account all H5 sequences in the
NCBI database. As shown in the Table 3, among both
avian and human H5N1 strains, Arg and Lys appear in
more than 98.4% of H5N1 strains in the 189 th amino
acid, while Asn and Ser are the most dominant amino
acids in the position 155. This finding indicated that the
Mab pair, which can cover the two epitopes, is able to
recognize more than 98.4% of H5N1 strains in the database. Based on this, Mabs 6B8 and 4C2 were thought to
have good potential for being used in combination to
detect H5N1 infections.
To further ascertain this prediction, an antigen capture ELISA was performed, and the two Mabs were
found to recognize complementary epitopes and react

that the Mab 6B8 and 4C2 complemented each other
and were a good pair to use in rapid antigen detection
of H5 influenza.
Combination of monoclonal antibodies in H5 dot ELISA

Different concentrations of Mabs were used before confirming the optimal concentration in a prototype rapid
test. 1 ug each of 6B8 and 4C2 were immobilized on a
nitrocellulose membrane and serve as capturing antibodies, The sample was lysed with 400 ul lysis buffer and
loaded on the membrane with a filter device. The H5N1

The specificity of the H5 dot ELISA was tested with a
total of 100 HPAI H5 strains isolated from humans and
avian species and 40 non-H5 subtype influenza virus
strains from different regions and years, including 26
seasonal influenza virus strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B
subtypes) and 2 pandemic influenza virus strains circulating in humans. Viruses of H5 or HA subtypes not
available in our laboratory were rescued by reverse
genetics with the six internal genes from A/Puerto Rico/
8/34. The reactivity and specificity of the H5 dot-ELISA
were examined with 200 ul of PBS containing the H5
strains adjusted to an HA titer of 8. Non-H5 viruses
with HA titers of 16 were used in order to eliminate
false-positive results. Virus strains listed in Table 5 and

6 were tested in the laboratory and the rest strains were
studied at the sites of those virus donors. The dot
ELISA rapid test with 4C2 and 6B8 can successfully
detect all the 100 H5 virus strains from different clades,

covering clades 1, 2.2, 2.3, 0, 7, 4, and 8, and representative H5 Indonesia isolates, which belong to clade 2.1. No
cross-reactivity was observed for any of the non-H5
subtype viruses tested. Other avian viruses such as Newcastle Disease (ND), Infectious Bursal disease (IBD),
were also tested to be negative with the H5 dot ELISA.
The analytical sensitivity of the H5 Dot ELISA was
determined against 18 strains of H5 virus belonging to
the major genetic groups (clades or subclades) diluted
serially. As shown in Table 4, the detection limit of the
test varied from 0.5 to 0.125 HA units/200 ul of sample.
The detection limit of the commercial kit for influenza
A virus detection (Rockeby) was determined to be 200
ul of sample containing at least 1.5 HA titer of virus.
Performance of H5 dot ELISA in the detection of variant
H5N1 Indonesia strains in poultry samples relative to RTPCR

The dot ELISA test was further evaluated with poultry
samples. The swabs from birds infected with H5N1
virus can secrete virus of titer higher than l08 EID50/ml.
Samples were serially diluted 10 times from 10-1 to 10-4
with PBS and tested by the dot ELISA kit to determine
the detection limit for swabs. The sensitivity test
indicated that the dot ELISA kit was able to detect the
presence of virus at a concentration down to 105 EID50/
ml in swabs, suggesting the test can be used for the
detection of H5 infection in sick birds.
From 150 samples taken from clinically healthy birds,
one sample was found to be positive with the test. The
same sample was confirmed to be the only positive

swab among the 150 samples in RT-PCR with H5 specific primers. 50 tracheal swabs obtained from sick birds
were also tested with both dot ELISA and RT-PCR
(Table 7). The results with the dot ELISA showed that
nine samples were positive for H5 infection. The same
result was observed from the verification with RT-PCR.
As shown in Table 8, specificity test using various
H5N1 viruses from several years and areas in Indonesia
showed that the ELISA kit is 90% specific compared
with RT-PCR using H5 primers, but 100% specific compared to HA2 primer. This indicates that the dot ELISA
kit is able to detect H5N1 as long as the virus did not
undergo a genetic mutation in their HA genes. Taken
together, these findings indicate that the dot ELISA kit
is suitable for specific early detection of H5 virus infection in avian species.

Discussion
Point-of care rapid tests are designed and marketed for
use in the ambulatory setting, in order to guide physicians in making the best possible clinical decisions and
help farmers in preventing animal disease spreading and
stopping the immediate threat to human health. Conventional methods for H5 virus detection are time-consuming and technically demanding, and most
importantly, these methods are not practical for field
investigation [17]. Several rapid diagnostic kits for the
detection of H5 subtype viruses have been reported. But

more than a couple of monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies are required to reach appropriate specificity and sensitivity of detection, which increases
production cost [14]. The application of the complementary Mab pair reported in this study provides a
solution to this and makes it possible for the cost effective production of rapid H5 tests for field usage.
One of the H5 strains from chicken, which can not be
detected by the dot ELISA, was subjected to HA
sequencing. The sequence result indicated that multiple
deletions occur in its H5 sequence, such as the 353 rd
and the 387th nucleotide. These mutations may cause
changes in HA protein structure and abolish the interaction to specific Mabs. These nature virus mutants may
not replicate properly and spread efficiently due to their
genetic instability. Therefore, it is concluded that the
dot ELISA performed here is able to detect those circulating H5N1 viruses that did not change genetically in
their HA genes. Unlike chicken, duck and other water
fowls do not show any symptom even if they are
infected with high concentration of H5 virus [18]. These
virus carriers can cause virus shedding and spreading.
Virus titration studies indicate that these non-symptomatic birds can shed more than 108 EID 50 /ml of the
virus to the environment. The dot test developed here is
sensitive enough to achieve specific early detection in
poultry species. Therefore, the use of the H5 dot ELISA
rapid test on site will reduce the risk of the false

negative results via symptom observation only. Though,
as a common challenge for all the rapid field tests, there
is the possibility of false negative results due to the limitation of test sensitivity, this H5 dot ELISA serves as an
effective tool for H5 screening at the very early stage.
For those possible infected populations, it is still necessary to confirm with RT-PCR after the primary H5
infection screening with this rapid test first, if the clinical condition allows.
Selection of the H5 HA specific MAbs for the development of the H5 dot ELISA was based on detailed
analyses of their binding properties. The selected H5specific MAb 4C2 and 6B8 demonstrated high specificity
to H5 HA in the HI assay and IFA. Neutralization
escape mutants with the Mab pair showed substitutions
at amino acid positions 155 and 189. These amino acids
are two of the key residues in the H5 receptor-binding
site of the globular head of the HA molecule. H5N1
HPAI viruses are classified into distinct phylogenic
clades based on their phylogenetic divergence [19]. The
MAb pair described here recognizes multiple clades of
H5N1 viruses, including clades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7,
and 8 in the H5 dot ELISA. This result could suggest
that the epitope-binding sites of the two complementary
MAbs are highly conserved in H5N1 viruses. Such conformational epitopes in the receptor binding site are HA
subtype-specific [20]. Future studies will be performed
to apply this Mab pair for therapeutic purpose against
H5 influenza infection without mutant evasion [21]. 38
non-H5 subtype influenza virus strains were tested to be
negative in this dot ELISA. Though they constitute only
a small subset of the possible viruses, the cross-reactivity
of the H5 dot ELISA with other subtype viruses is
believed to be extremely low. Further evaluation, however, will be performed with more samples, especially
human samples, to determine the specificity of the assay
in a more quantitative way.
The performance of the H5 dot ELISA has been
proved to be stable based on a standard method in
which the kits were stored at 37°C for a week (data not
shown). The study indicated that the H5 dot ELISA
developed here is suitable for the usage in field where
the storage condition at low temperature is not available. It has been studied as well that the performance of
the test will not be affected by those potential chemical
ingredients in oral or nasal swabs, such as antibiotics,
mouth wash and nasal sprays. However, the only drawback of the current test is the potential cross reaction
with bloody samples, which may cause false-positive
results during testing. Fortunately, a new technology
developed recently provides solution to this problem.
The target can be detected by fluorescence labeled antibodies and be observed with a portable fluorescence
reader. Any false positive signal from blood will be

Page 6 of 9

eliminated by using fluorescence with target-specific
wave length.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the H5 dot ELISA developed can serve as
rapid devices for the on-site detection of H5 influenza
virus. It has been evaluated in this study with tracheal
swabs from avian species. It could also be used to test
other types of swabs from other species, such as mammals. Future studies will be performed to confirm this.
Based on complementary Mabs, the test can respond to
more than 99% of circulating H5 influenza viruses with
the as sensitivity as a rapid field test. Further investigation, however, is needed to shorten the processing time
of each test for a new generation of rapid field tests.
Based on all these studies, indicating that the test is
convenient for field use, this H5 Dot ELISA can be used
for on-site detection of H5N1 infection in clinical or
environmental specimens and facilitate the investigation
of H5N1 influenza outbreaks and surveillance in poultry.
Methods
Viruses and cells

As shown in Table 9, twenty-four human H5N1 influenza strains (clade 2.1) isolated from Indonesia were
obtained from the Ministry of Health, Indonesia. Twelve
avian H5N1 influenza strains isolated from Indonesia
were collected by the faculty of veterinary medicine,
Bogor agriculture university, Indonesia. Forty-six H5
influenza strains were tested in Wantai biotechnology
company, China. Five non-H5 subtype strains were
obtained from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority
of Singapore. Sixteen H1N1, six H3N2, and four influenza B virus strains were isolated from human clinical
samples by the Department of Pathology, Singapore
General Hospital. The remaining H5 and non H5 influenza viruses were generated with reverse genetics in our
lab as described previously [22]. All of HA and NA
genes were synthesized by GenScript. The reassortant
viruses were rescued by transfecting plasmids containing

HA and NA together with the remaining six gene plasmids derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) into a
coculture of 293T and MDCK cells. All of H5N1 and
non-H5N1 strains studied in the laboratory in Singapore
are listed in Table 5 and 6. Viruses were inoculated into
the allantoic cavities of 11-day-old embryonated chicken
eggs and harvested following 48 h of incubation at 37°C.
Virus titers were determined using hemagglutination
assays according to standard methods [19]. H5N1 subtype viruses were inactivated with formaldehyde as
described previously [23]. All experiments with live
H5N1 and H7N7 subtype viruses were performed in a
biosafety level 3 containment laboratory in compliance
with CDC/NIH and WHO recommendations and also
were approved by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority and the Ministry of Health of Singapore.
MDCK cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were propagated in
Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Virus stocks were
grown in MDCK cells in DMEM supplemented with
0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 200 ng/ml of
trypsin.
Preparation and purification of Mabs

Hybridomas secreting specific Mabs were derived from
BALB/c mice which had been immunized twice intramuscularly with purified H5N1 AIV in 0.1 ml of PBS,
emulsified with an equal volume of adjuvant (SEPPIC,
France). An intraperitoneal booster of the same dose of
H5N1 virus was given three days before splenocytes
were fused to the SP/2.0 myloma cells, as previously
described [24]. 6B8 was generated from mice immunized with H5N2 strain A/chicken/Singapore/98, while
4C2 was obtained from mice with H5N1 strain A/
human/Indonesia/CDC669/06. Hybridoma culture
supernatants were screened by immunofluorescent
assays using mock-infected or variant H5N1 infected
MDCK as antigen, respectively, as described below.
Hybridomas identified to produce specific antibody,
were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded in 75
cm2 flasks. One week later, the hybridoma suspension
was harvested and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation
at 400 g for 10 min, followed by collection of the supernatant and storage at -20°C. IgM were purified from
clarified Mab supernatant using protein A affinity column (Sigma, USA) and Immnopure® IgM purification
kit (Pierce, IL, USA) in accordance with manufacturer’s
instructions. IgM concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop, DE, USA).

Briefly, receptor-destroying enzyme-treated sera were
serially diluted (twofold) in V-bottom, 96-well plates
and mixed with an equal volume of virus. Plates were
incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and 1%
chicken red blood cell was added to each well. The HI
endpoint was the highest serum dilution in which agglutination was not observed.
Selection of escape mutants

Generation of escape mutants follows the standard
method as described previously [21,25,26]. Serial 10-fold
dilutions of A/Indonesia/CDC669/06 (H5N1) virus were
mixed with an excess amount of 4C2 MAb (1 ug/ul) in
an equal volume, and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) with
6B8, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
The mixture was inoculated into 11-day old embryonated chicken eggs. The eggs were incubated at 37°C for
48 h. Virus was harvested and used for cloning in limiting dilution in embryonated chicken eggs and the escape
mutants were plaque purified. Viral RNA was isolated
using LS Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as specified by the
manufacturer. Reverse transcription and PCR were performed with specific primers for the HA gene of H5
subtypes. Mutations in a HA gene were then identified
by sequencing and compared with the sequence of the
parent virus.
H5 Antigen capture ELISA

96-well, round-bottom microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde,
Demark) were coated with 1 ug/well of capture MAb in
100 ul of carbonate buffer (73 mM sodium bicarbonate
and 30 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.7) overnight at 4°C
or 37°C for 2 h. The plates were washed twice with
PBST, followed by two washes with PBS after each incubation with antibody or antigen. The antibody-coated
plates were blocked by incubation with 100 ul of blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% milk) for 1 h at room
temperature and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h with
100 ul of virus-containing samples diluted in PBST.
Virus binding was detected by incubation for 1 h at 37°
C with 100 ul of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
detection MAb (800 ng) (in-house labeling; Roche).
Chromogen development was mediated by the addition
of 100 ul of freshly prepared substrate solution (o-phenylenediamine-dihydrochloride; Sigma). The reaction
was stopped by adding 0.1 N sulfuric acid, and the optical density at 490 nm was recorded. The detection limit
was determined by the optical density value that gave a
signal-to-noise ratio of 3.
Dot ELISA

Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test

Mab 4C2 and 6B8 were subjected to HI test which was
carried out according to the standard method [19].

The dot ELISA rapid test kit with the two complementary Mabs was manufactured by Wantai biotechnology
company, China [14]. The dot ELISA test was

He et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:330
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/330

performed following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
200 ul of samples was lysed with 400 ul lysis buffer and
loaded on a filter device. The filtrated samples went
through the membrane coated with Mabs. Following
washing with wash buffer of three times, the substrate
reagent was added on the membrane and the signal was
developed. Results were read within 5 minutes after adding stop solution.

Preparation of tracheal swab samples

200 samples of tracheal swab were collected from fresh
avian species from Bogor and Makassar (South Sulawesi)
to detect any possible existence of H5 avian influenza
virus. A serial dilution (multiple of 10) was performed on
the virus of subtype H5N1 with predetermined titer level.
The multiplication level of the dilution started initially at
10 -1 and gradually increased to 10 -4 . The dissolved
viruses were tested by dot ELISA kit to determine the
capability of detecting the most dissolved virus in swabs.
The experiment has been repeated three times. Using
Reed and Muench mathematical technique, the infectivity titer of each sample was expressed as EID50/ml.
RT-PCR

Extraction of total RNA was performed following manufacturers’ protocol from QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Germany) using all necessary safety precautions. The resultant RNA was dissolved in 20 ul of
RNase-free water. Three PCRs were performed using
two H5 primer pairs and HA2 specific primers individually. One pair of H5 primers consist of primers J3 and
B2a as described previously [27]. The primer pair is as
follows: J3: GAT AAA TTC TAG CAT GCC ATT CC
B2a: TTT TGT CAA TGA TTG AGT TGA CCT TAT
TGG. The second H5 specific primer pair was forward
primer: 5’-TCAGATTTGCATTGGTTACC-3’ and
reverse primer: 5’- ACTATGTAAGACCATTCCGG3’).
HA2 primers were: forward primer: 5’-ACTATGAAGAATGAAACACCT-3’ and reverse primer: 5’ GCAATGAAATTTCCATTACTCTC-3’).
One step RT-PCR cycling conditions were 60°C for 1
min, 42°C for 10 min, 50°C for 30 min, and 94°C for 15
min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min and lastly followed by 72°C
for 10 min. The PCR products were resolved in 1.2%
agarose gels with the sizes of around 312 bp- 456 bp.
PCR products were further sequenced to confirm the
identity of the products.
