Abstract
Background: ORF59 DNA polymerase processivity factor of the human rhadinovirus, Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is required for efficient copying of the genome during
virus replication. KSHV ORF59 is antigenic in the infected host and is used as a marker for virus
activation and replication.
Results: We cloned, sequenced and expressed the genes encoding related ORF59 proteins from
the RV1 rhadinovirus homologs of KSHV from chimpanzee (PtrRV1) and three species of macaques
(RFHVMm, RFHVMn and RFHVMf), and have compared them with ORF59 proteins obtained from
members of the more distantly-related RV2 rhadinovirus lineage infecting the same non-human
primate species (PtrRV2, RRV, MneRV2, and MfaRV2, respectively). We found that ORF59
homologs of the RV1 and RV2 Old World primate rhadinoviruses are highly conserved with
distinct phylogenetic clustering of the two rhadinovirus lineages. RV1 and RV2 ORF59 C-terminal
domains exhibit a strong lineage-specific conservation. Rabbit antiserum was developed against a
C-terminal polypeptide that is highly conserved between the macaque RV2 ORF59 sequences. This
anti-serum showed strong reactivity towards ORF59 encoded by the macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses,
RRV (rhesus) and MneRV2 (pig-tail), with no cross reaction to human or macaque RV1 ORF59
proteins. Using this antiserum and RT-qPCR, we determined that RRV ORF59 is expressed early
after permissive infection of both rhesus primary fetal fibroblasts and African green monkey kidney
epithelial cells (Vero) in vitro. RRV- and MneRV2-infected foci showed strong nuclear expression of
ORF59 that correlated with production of infectious progeny virus. Immunohistochemical studies
of an MneRV2-infected macaque revealed strong nuclear expression of ORF59 in infected cells
within the differentiating layer of epidermis corroborating previous observations that differentiated
epithelial cells are permissive for replication of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses.

Conclusion: The ORF59 DNA polymerase processivity factor homologs of the Old World
primate RV1 and RV2 rhadinovirus lineages are phylogenetically distinct yet demonstrate similar
expression and localization characteristics that correlate with their use as lineage-specific markers
for permissive infection and virus replication. These studies will aid in the characterization of virus
activation from latency to the replicative state, an important step for understanding the biology and
transmission of rhadinoviruses, such as KSHV.

Introduction
Multiple proteins encoded in herpesvirus genomes are
required for origin dependent DNA synthesis, including
an origin binding protein, a helicase, a primase, a primase-associated factor, a single-stranded DNA binding
protein, a DNA polymerase, and a DNA polymerase
processivity factor, see for example [1]. In order for the
DNA polymerase to copy the viral genome during virus
replication, it requires the processivity factor, which binds
the polymerase and enhances its ability to synthesize fulllength products [2,3]. There is considerable interest in
understanding the biology of the polymerase-processivity
factor interaction due to the potential for developing herpesvirus-specific drugs that could inhibit genome replication and the production of progeny virus [4,5]. A
concerted effort has been made to develop serological reagents that specifically react with each of the different herpesvirus processivity factors to study their cellular
localization and trafficking and interactions with other
cellular proteins that are critical for virus replication[6-8].
Because of its role in viral DNA synthesis, the processivity
factor has also become an important protein marker for
virus replication.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human
herpesvirus 8, the recently discovered human rhadinovirus belonging to the gammaherpesvirus subfamily,
encodes a highly conserved DNA polymerase in open
reading frame (ORF) 9 and a DNA polymerase processivity factor in ORF59 [9]. KSHV ORF59 binds DNA as a
homodimer, interacts with the ORF9 DNA polymerase to
strongly enhance its ability to synthesize full-length DNA
[6,10,11] and is necessary for origin-dependent viral DNA
replication [12]. In comparison to other human herpesviruses, the KSHV processivity factor displays the strongest
similarity (29% amino acid identity) with the processivity
factor (BMRF1) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the only other
known human gammaherpesvirus. More closely-related
processivity factors are present in the related New World
and Old World primate rhadinoviruses, herpesvirus
saimiri (HVS) of the squirrel monkey (30% identity)[13])
and rhesus rhadinovirus of the rhesus macaque (49%
identity) [14,15], respectively. The specificity of the interaction between KSHV ORF59 and its DNA polymerase
was demonstrated by the inability of the related processivity factors of herpes simplex type 1 (UL42)(20% identity)

and p41 of human herpesvirus 6 (19% identity) to functionally replace KSHV ORF59 [10].
KSHV is now considered to be the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), pleural effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease [16]. Essentially all affected
cells in these diseases are latently infected with KSHV and
only rare cells have active virus replication [17]. Similarly,
infection of cells in vitro by KSHV results in the rapid
establishment of latency with only rare cells showing productive viral replication. Treatment of latently-infected
cells with the phorbol ester, TPA, induces activation of
virus replication and production of progeny virus. Using
an antibody that recognizes KSHV ORF59, the processivity factor was found to be highly expressed in the nuclei of
infected cells that harbor actively replicating virus [18,19].
Immunofluorescence studies have localized KSHV ORF59
and other core replication proteins within the viral DNA
replication compartments in the nuclei of infected cells
[20]. Deletion analysis of ORF59 has revealed regions critical for binding to the DNA polymerase and doublestranded DNA, as well as a region that enhances the
processivity of the DNA polymerase [6]. Transport of the
viral DNA polymerase into the nucleus is dependent on
ORF59 [20], which contains a nuclear localization signal,
and binding domains within ORF59 have been identified
that are required for nuclear transport of the polymerase
[21]. The reactivity of a monoclonal antibody to KSHV
ORF59 with the cognate antigen in the nucleus is an
important marker of activation of KSHV replication [6].
Rhadinoviruses closely-related to KSHV have been identified in a variety of Old World primates, including
macaques, gorillas and chimpanzees. Cloning, sequencing and functional characterization of these viruses is of
interest due to the structural and functional similarities
with KSHV and the possibility of developing an animal
model of KSHV pathology. These Old World primate
rhadinoviruses segregate into two distinct lineages. The
RV1 lineage consists of KSHV in humans, retroperitoneal
fibromatosis herpesviruses (RFHV) in different species of
macaque [22], and closely-related viruses in chimpanzees
[23,24], gorillas [24] and African Green monkeys [25].
The RV2 lineage consists of rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV)
[26] and related viruses in different species of macaques

[22,27,28], chimpanzee [29], baboon [30], gibbons [31]
and drills [32]. These data suggest that every Old World
primate species, including humans, are host to rhadinoviruses of both RV1 and RV2 lineages, although a human
RV2 virus has yet to be identified.
Previous studies have shown that RRV, the RV2 rhadinovirus prototype in the rhesus macaque, produces a permissive, replicative infection in cultured rhesus monkey
fibroblast cells with obvious cytopathic effects, first evident between 4-7 days, and the production of infectious
virus [26]. A genome-wide transcription profile and a
more restricted profile of several key RRV genes have been
determined during the time course of infection [33,34]. In
general, these studies have shown that the transcription of
RRV genes after de novo permissive infection parallels the
transcription profile of KSHV genes after activation of
latently-infected cells by treatment with phorbol esters or
sodium butyrate.
In order to examine the conservation of ORF59 within the
RV1 and RV2 rhadinovirus lineages and develop reagents
to detect and differentiate RV1 and RV2 permissive infections, we cloned and sequenced the ORF59 homologs of
the RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses from chimpanzee and
three species of macaque and compared these with the
KSHV and RRV ORF59 sequences. Sequence comparisons
revealed strong conservation between the RV1 and RV2
rhadinoviruses within the majority of the ORF59 coding
sequences. However, lineage-specific sequences were
identified in the C-terminal domains, and a polyclonal
rabbit antiserum was developed against this domain in
the RV2 ORF59 proteins. Specificity of this antiserum was
demonstrated by Western blot and immunofluorescence
analysis. Using this antiserum and ORF59-specific RTqPCR assays, we demonstrate that RRV and the related
RV2 rhadinovirus, MneRV2, from M. nemestrina, both
undergo a permissive infection in rhesus primary fetal
fibroblast (RPFF) cell cultures and in Vero African green
monkey kidney epithelial cells with abundant expression
and nuclear localization of ORF59. We also show that
RV2 ORF59 expression is coupled with active replication
of the viral genome and production of infectious virions.
Finally, we demonstrate reactivity of the anti-RV2 ORF59
antiserum within the nuclei of epithelial cells present in
the differentiated layer of skin epithelium of a pig-tailed
macaque that had been naturally infected with MneRV2.
This in vivo data with a macaque RV2 rhadinovirus is congruent with previous in vitro studies, in which expression
of ORF59 and other markers of KSHV replication correlated with epithelial cell differentiation, suggesting that
differentiated epithelial cells are a specific source of infectious virions in hosts naturally infected with Old World
primate rhadinoviruses.

Results
The ORF59 proteins of the Old World primate RV1 and
RV2 rhadinoviruses are highly conserved and show lineagespecific conservation in their C-terminal domains
We cloned and sequenced the ORF59 homologs from
members of the RV1 lineage of Old World primate rhadinoviruses from chimpanzee, P. troglodyte (PtrRV1), and
three species of macaque, M. mulatta (RFHVMm), M.
nemestrina (RFHVMn) and M. fascicularis (RFHVMf),
using primers and templates listed in Table 1, as described
in Materials and Methods. We also cloned and sequenced
the ORF59 homologs from members of the RV2 lineage of
Old World primate rhadinoviruses from chimpanzee
(PtRV2) and two species of macaque, M. nemestrina
(MneRV2) and M. fascicularis (MfaRV2). We compared
these sequences with the previously published sequences
of KSHV ORF59 (RV1 lineage in humans) [9] and the
ORF59 homolog of the RV2 rhadinovirus from M.
mulatta, RRV [14]. Alignment of the ORF59 protein
sequences revealed strong amino acid sequence conservation with approximately 50% of the residues being identical in all of the sequences from the RV1 and RV2 lineages
(highlighted in black, Fig. 1). This strong conservation
extended through most of ORF59, up to ~aa300 (KSHV
numbering). The C-terminal domains showed little overall conservation between the RV1 and RV2 lineages.
Instead, a strong lineage-specific conservation was
observed, especially within the macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses extending from aa310-394 (RRV numbering, highlighted in blue, Fig. 1).

Overall, the chimpanzee RV1 rhadinovirus (PtrRV1)
ORF59 was most closely related to the KSHV ORF59
sequence with 89% identical amino acids (Table 2). While
the similarity of the macaque RV1 sequences to both the
PtrRV1 and KSHV sequences ranged from 56-58%, the
similarity between macaque RV1 sequences themselves
was 82-94%. Within the RV2 lineage, the ORF59
sequences of the different macaque rhadinoviruses were
88-95% conserved with each other and 64% conserved
with the PtrRV2 chimpanzee sequence. The similarity of
the KSHV ORF59 and RV2 ORF59 sequences ranged from
49-51% (see Table 2).
Alignment of the ORF59 sequences from the RV1 and RV2
Old World primate rhadinoviruses revealed strong
sequence conservation of several functional domains that
have been identified in KSHV ORF59. Dimerization and
binding domains for the KSHV DNA polymerase have
been identified within the KSHV ORF59 sequence at aa127 and aa276-304 (see Fig. 1). These regions showed
blocks of strong conservation across all ORF59 sequences
interspersed with blocks conserved between the different
rhadinovirus lineages. A three amino acid motif "KRR"

1 We have utilized the virus nomenclature scheme indicating the host genus (first letter), species (second and third letters) with the designation of
rhadinovirus lineage, ie RV1 or RV2, to provide a unique designation for the rhadinoviruses from different Old World primate species. For
historical reasons, Homo sapiens HsaRV1 remains as KSHV, the macaque RV1s remain as RFHVMn, RFHVMm, and RFHVMf and the rhesus
macaque MmuRV2 remains as RRV. The gene-specific primers are derived from published sequences (Genbank accession number is indicated) or
from new sequences obtained in this study.
2 a and b designations indicate forward and reverse strand primers, respectively
3 5' and 3' gene-specific primers used for preparing the full-length ORF59 bacterial expression vectors
4 CODEHOP PCR primers used for cloning the initial regions of the ORF59 genes
5 gene-specific primers used in conjunction with the CODEHOP PCR primers to obtain the full-length ORF59 coding sequences
6 gene-specific primers used in conjunction with the MneRV2 ORF59a primer to construct MneRV2 ORF59 truncation mutants
7 gene-specific primers used in conjunction with the MneRV2 ORF59b primer to construct MneRV2 ORF59 truncation mutants

tion aa376 in the KSHV ORF59 was found to be critical for
nuclear localization of both ORF59 and the DNA
polymerase of KSHV [21]. This motif and the downstream
serine were conserved in all of the RV1 ORF59 sequences
analyzed (Fig. 1). A similar motif "KRK" (aa369-371,
RRV) was conserved in all the RV2 ORF59 sequences analyzed. This motif was separated by one amino acid from a
serine residue which was conserved in all three macaque
RV2 OR59 sequences but not the chimpanzee RV2
ORF59.
Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned amino acid sequences
revealed a separate clustering of the RV1 and RV2 ORF59
sequences, with KSHV ORF59 clustering with the RV1
sequences (Fig. 2), as expected from previous studies with
other viral genes [22]. In the RV1 cluster, the ORF59
sequences from the human (KSHV) and chimpanzee
(PtrRV1) viruses grouped together, demonstrating a close
evolutionary relationship. The ORF59 sequences from the
macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses clustered together with the
sequences of the M. mulatta and the M. fascicularis rhadinoviruses, RFHVMm and RFHVMf, respectively, showing
the closest similarity. ORF59 from the M. nemestrina rhadinovirus, RFHVMn, was an outgroup of the macaque virus
sequences. The chimpanzee and macaque RV2 ORF59
sequences clustered separately from KSHV and the other
RV1 ORF59 sequences, with the chimpanzee sequence as
an outgroup of the macaque sequences. Within the
macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses, the ORF59 sequences from
M. mulatta (RRV) and M. fascicularis, (MfaRV2) clustered
together, with the ORF59 from M. nemestrina (MneRV2)
as an outgroup.
RRV orf59 is transcribed early after RRV infection of RPFF
cells
The orf59 of the RV1 rhadinovirus, KSHV, has been classified as an early-late gene due to its low level expression in
latently-infected cells and increased expression after activation of latently-infected cells to begin replicating viral

DNA and producing infectious virions [18]. In order to
study the expression kinetics of the orf59 of an RV2 rhadinovirus, rhesus primary fetal fibroblast (RPFF) cell cultures were infected with RRV and total nucleic acids were
extracted at different times after infection. The mRNA levels of RRV orf59 were compared to those of the RRV
homologs of the orf50 lytic transactivator gene, the orf9
DNA polymerase, the orf8 glycoprotein B and the orf73
latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) using genespecific RT-qPCR assays to quantitate mRNA, as described
in the Materials and Methods. Viral mRNA expression levels were normalized to the mRNA levels of the cellular
ribosomal phosphoprotein gene (RPO). RRV orf59 mRNA
was first detected 8 hours post infection and its levels continued to rise strongly until 48 hours post infection. Subsequently, the levels remained fairly constant through 72
hours post infection. (Fig. 3). Similarly, mRNAs for the
RRV orf8, orf9, and orf50 were first detected at 8 hours post
infection. The levels of these mRNAs continued to rise
over the 72 hour time course with a strong increase in the
orf8 glycoprotein B mRNA by 72 hours. A very low level of
ORF73 LANA mRNA was reproducibly detected 8 hours
post infection, but no increase was observed over the 72
hour time course. Maximal mRNA copy number for
ORF59 reached ~32,800, while the copy numbers for
ORF73, ORF50, ORF9 and ORF8 reached ~50, 20,900,
20,200 and 25,700, respectively.
ORF59 homologs elicit a strong humoral antibody
response in macaques naturally infected with RV1 or RV2
rhadinoviruses in vivo
Previous studies have shown that ORF59 of KSHV is
immunogenic in KSHV-infected patients with KS [35] and
serological assays have been developed to detect antibodies to KSHV ORF59 to study virus prevalence and detect
infection [36]. To determine whether the macaque RV1
and RV2 ORF59 proteins are immunogenic in naturallyinfected macaques, full length ORF59 proteins from RRV,
MneRV2, and RFHVMn were expressed as 6XHis-fusions

Comparison of the ORF59 homologs of Old World primate RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses. The orf59 genes from
the RV1 rhadinoviruses from chimpanzee (PtrRV1) and three species of macaque, M. mulatta (RFHVMm), M. nemestrina (RFHVMn) and M. fascicularis (RFHVMf), and the ORF59 genes from the RV2 rhadinoviruses from chimpanzee (PtrRV2) and the two
species of macaque, M. nemestrina (MneRV2) and M. fascicularis (MfaRV2), were cloned using a CODEHOP PCR approach (see
Materials and Methods) and the encoded amino acid sequences were aligned with the previously published sequences of the
human RV1 rhadinovirus, KSHV (NP_572115) and the rhesus macaque RV2 prototype, RRV17577 (AAD21393). Identical residues in six of the nine sequences are highlighted in black. Identical residues in at least three of the four RV2 sequences are highlighted in blue, whereas identical residues in at least three of the RV1 sequences are highlighted in purple. Domains involved in
nuclear localization (NLS), dimer formation, DNA-binding and DNA polymerase (Pol-8) binding [6,11,21] of KSHV ORF59 are
indicated. The RV2-specific antigens of RRV and MneRV2 ORF59 used to produce the anti-RV2 ORF59 rabbit polyclonal antisera are underlined (see Materials and Methods).

in the pQE30 vector. The 6XHis-ORF59 fusion proteins
were purified on Ni-NTA agarose and analyzed by immunoblotting. Significant amounts of 6XHis-ORF59 fusion
proteins were detected in each case using an anti-6XHis
antibody with molecular weights ranging from 44-45 Kd
(Fig. 4, RowB). The immunoblot was probed with plasma
from several juvenile pig-tailed macaques (age ~1 year).
No reactivity was detected (data not shown). Various
immunoreactivities were detected with plasma from older
macaques and macaques infected with SIV. Serum from
the adult rhesus macaque dBL2 reacted strongly with the
full-length RRV ORF59 protein (Fig. 4, lane2A, C), and
more weakly with the MneRV2 and RFHVMn ORF59 proteins (Fig. 4, lanes1A, C and 3A, C, respectively). Serum
from the SIV-infected pig-tailed adult macaque J00079
reacted most strongly with the RFHVMn ORF59 (Fig. 4,
lane 6A, C), with weaker reactivity to both the MneRV2
and RRV ORF59 (Fig. 4, lanes 4A, C and 5A, C, respectively). In contrast, serum from the SIV-infected macaque
K99344 reacted strongly with all three macaque RV1 and
RV2 ORF59 proteins (Fig. 4, lanes 7-9A, C).

The reactivity of the different macaque sera to ORF59 was
examined by Western blot analysis of N- and C-terminal
truncations of the MneRV2 ORF59, as described above.
All three macaque sera exhibited strong reactivity to the T1
C-terminal truncation mutant containing only 101 N-terminal amino acids of the 394 amino acid MneRV2 ORF59
(Table 3). Sera reactivity was also seen to the T2, T3 and
T4 C-terminal truncation mutants which also contained
the N-terminal amino acids of the T1 truncation. No sera
reactivity was detected to the T5 and T6 N-terminal truncation mutants containing only the C-terminal amino
acids 299-394 or 354-394, respectively (Table 3). These
results indicate that at least the first 101 amino acids and
maybe more of the highly conserved ORF59 N-terminal
domain contain antigenic epitopes recognized by the
macaque immune system during natural rhadinovirus
infections.

Alignment of the ORF59 sequences from the RV1 and RV2
macaque rhadinoviruses revealed a strong conservation
between RV2 sequences within the ORF59 carboxy-terminal region (Fig. 1). Since the region from amino acid 300388 of the RV2 sequences showed little conservation with
the RV1 ORF59 sequences, this region was chosen as an
antigenic target for the development of specific antimacaque RV2 ORF59 antisera. The coding regions for
these 89 amino acids from both RRV and MneRV2 ORF59
were cloned into the 6XHis expression vector, pQE30, and
recombinant proteins were produced in bacteria and purified, as described in Materials and Methods. Equal
amounts of the purified RRV and MneRV2 ORF59
polypeptides were combined and used to immunize rabbits. The 425 rabbit anti-RV2 ORF59 antiserum showed
strong reactivity with the RV2 ORF59 proteins from both
RRV and MneRV2 (Fig. 5) but not with ORF59 from the
chimpanzee PtrRV2. This absence of cross-reactivity correlated with lack of conservation within the antigenic region
between the macaque and chimpanzee RV2 sequences

RV2 ORF59 proteins are highly expressed in the nuclei of
infected fibroblast and epithelial cells in vitro
The RV1 ORF59 from KSHV accumulates in the nuclei of
latently-infected cells in vitro after activation by TPA or
sodium butyrate treatment to initiate viral replication
[18,19]. To determine the localization of the RV2 ORF59
proteins, semi-confluent cultures of fibroblast cells
(RPFF) or epithelial cells (Vero) were infected with purified RRV at an MOI of ~0.01. The infected cell cultures
were incubated for 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 or 8 days, fixed, incubated
with the rabbit anti-RV2 ORF59 antiserum and examined
by confocal microscopy. Numerous foci of ORF59-positive cells were detected in both the RRV-infected Vero cells
(Fig. 6A-C; 10Ã magnification - obvious single and multicell foci with fluorescent nuclei are present) and RPFF cells
(Fig. 6D-F; 40Ã magnification of a multi-cell focus of
infection). In the infected RPFF cells, seven ORF59-positive foci of infection were detected at day 3 (four single
cell foci and 3 multi-cell foci)(Fig. 7A). This increased to a
total of 43 ORF59-positive foci by day 8 (seven single cell
foci and 36 multi-cell foci). At day 3, the multi-cell foci
contained on average approximately seven ORF59-positive cells per foci (Fig. 7B). By day 8, this had increased to
an average of 56 ORF59-positive cells per foci. The total
number of ORF59-positive cells increased from 49 (day 3)
to 457 (day 5) and to 3974 (day 8) (Fig. 7C). No obvious
ORF59-positive cells were detected prior to day 3.

The ORF59-positive foci of infected Vero cells showed a
distinct clustering suggesting syncytia formation seen with
other herpesviruses (Fig. 6A-C). This clustering/aggregration is more obvious in the image of the ToPro-3-stained
cell nuclei (Fig. 6B). These ORF59-positive clusters con-

The RV2 ORF59 proteins are highly expressed during RV2 rhadinovirus infections of RPFF and Vero cells and
localize to the nucleus. Subconfluent cell cultures were infected with either RRV or MneRV2, and ORF59 expression was
detected by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-RV2 ORF59 antiserum. Nuclear DNA was visualized with
Topro-3 stain. ORF59 immunofluorescence (A, D, G, and J), Topro-3 nuclear fluorescence (B, E, H and K), and an overlay of
ORF59 and Topro-3 fluorescence (C, F, I, and L) are shown. (A-C) Vero cells infected with RRV and reacted with the rabbit

tained strongly positive cells, weakly positive cells and
cells with no apparent ORF59 staining (see inset, Fig. 6C).
The ORF59-positive foci of infected RPFF cells showed no
obvious clustering or aggregation (Fig. 6D-F). Examination of the ORF59-positive foci in the RPFF cells at high
magnification (40Ã) revealed a co-localization of ORF59
immunofluorescence (green) and Topro-3 DNA fluorescence (blue) consistent with a nuclear localization of
ORF59 (see insert, Fig. 6F). The ORF59 staining was widespread throughout the nucleus, but had a speckled or
mottled appearance revealing distinct areas with minimal
ORF59. No antibody reactivity was seen with cells that
were mock-infected (data not shown), and a clear demarcation of the ORF59-positive cells and negative cells was
observed in the periphery of the infection foci showing
specificity of the antibody reaction (Fig. 6A-F).
A similar analysis of RPFF cells infected with the closelyrelated RV2 rhadinovirus from pig-tailed macaques,
MneRV2, was performed. Confocal analysis of the
MneRV2-infected RPFF cells revealed numerous foci reacting with the RV2 ORF59 antiserum (Fig. 6G-I). The rabbit
anti-RV2 ORF59 antisera gave strong fluorescence that colocalized with Topro-3 within the nucleus. (Fig. 6I and
insert). With both the RRV and MneRV2 infections, an
obvious gradient of ORF59 immunofluorescence was
seen within the positive foci. Strong fluorescence was
observed in the cells within the center of the positive foci
(Fig. 6). Weaker fluorescence was observed in the cells at
the edge of the foci, suggesting that the virus infection was
permissive and was spreading from an epicenter by production of new infectious virions and infection of adjacent cells. These results demonstrate that the rabbit antiRV2 ORF59 antisera reacts with the ORF59 proteins
expressed in vitro by both RRV and MneRV2. Furthermore,
they show that ORF59 is produced and accumulates
within the nucleus during these permissive infections.
To examine the specificity of the commercial mouse monoclonal antibody developed against the KSHV ORF59,
RPFF cell cultures infected with RRV or MneRV2 were
fixed and stained with the mouse monoclonal antibody.

While no reactivity was observed with RPFF cells infected
with RRV, strong nuclear fluorescence staining was
observed in numerous foci in RPFF cells infected with
MneRV2 (Fig. 6J-L). To confirm this reactivity, the RV1
and RV2 ORF59 recombinant 6XHis-fusion proteins were
examined for reactivity with the anti-KSHV ORF59 monoclonal antibody. While the RFHVMn, and MneRV2
ORF59 proteins both reacted with the monoclonal, the
RRV ORF59 protein did not (data not shown).
RRV infection of RPFF and Vero cells is permissive and
results in viral genome replication and production of
infectious virions
In order to examine the relationship between ORF59
expression and genome replication during permissive
infections, the time course of RRV genome accumulation
was determined after RRV infection of RPFFs. These cells
are known to be permissive for RRV infection [14,26].
RRV infection of RPFFs was compared to infection of African green monkey Vero cells, which have previously been
reported to be unable to support RRV replication [37].
Subconfluent cultures of RPFF and Vero cells were
infected with purified RRV virus at an approximate MOI
of 0.01 and the amount of cell-associated RRV DNA and
cell-free RRV DNA in the culture supernatant was assayed
using an RRV-specific TaqMan qPCR assay [30]. By 24
hours post infection, the cell-associated RRV DNA
increased more than 100 fold over the amount associated
with the cell monolayer during the virus adsorption
period in both the RPFF and Vero cell cultures (Fig. 8). At
24 hours the amount of cell-free RRV DNA present in the
culture medium increased by nearly four logs in both cell
cultures. By day 8, the cell-associated RRV DNA in the
infected RPFF cultures had increased by almost 5 logs over
the amount present after the initial adsorption period,
while the cell-free RRV DNA had increased by 6 logs. By
day 8, the cell-associated and cell-free RRV DNA in the
infected Vero cultures had increased by almost 3 logs and
5 logs, respectively.

To determine whether this increase in RRV DNA represented infectious virus, aliquots of the RRV DNA-contain-

After 5 days, the newly infected RPFF cell cultures showed
significant cytopathic effects (data not shown). qPCR
analysis of cell-associated and cell-free RRV DNA revealed
greater than 107 viral genomes in both the RPFF cultures
receiving medium from either the initial RPFF or Vero
infected cultures. These results demonstrate that RRV
infection of both RPFF and Vero cells is permissive resulting in viral genome replication and production of infectious RRV virions, which correlates with the expression
and nuclear accumulation of RRV ORF59.

Expression of RV2 ORF59 in the skin of a pig-tailed
macaque naturally infected with the MneRV2 rhadinovirus and simian retrovirus-2 (SRV-2). Formalin-fixed
skin tissue from (A) a juvenile (MneRV2 and SRV-2 negative)
and (B) an adult (MneRV2 and SRV-2 positive) pig-tailed
macaque from the WaNPRC was reacted with the 425 rabbit
anti-RV2 ORF59 antiserum as described in Materials and
Methods. A magnification of a section of the tissue in B (large
arrowhead) is shown in (C). The different layers of the epidermal tissue are indicated. The vertically-oriented cells in
the basal layer correspond to the undifferentiated, proliferating, columnar basal keratinocytes. The round cells present in
the spinous layer and the flattened cells present in the granular layer correspond to the post-mitotic suprabasal keratinocytes.

fin-embedded skin tissue of a young (1.84 yr old) female
M. nemestrina that presented with a chronic SRV-2 infection at the WaNPRC. The anti-RV2 ORF59 serum from
rabbit 425 displayed no reactivity with stratified skin epithelium from a juvenile macaque negative for both
MneRV2 and SRV-2 viruses (Fig. 9A). In contrast, the antiRV2 ORF59 antiserum strongly reacted with the nuclei of
keratinocytes in the stratified epithelium of the skin and
in the epithelium surrounding the hair follicles (Fig. 9B).
The columnar cells within the basal epithelial layer
showed variable antibody reactivity, with strong staining
observed in only ~10-12% of the cells. Within the spinous
layer, a number of cells were detected that had strong antiRV2 ORF59 staining in large, round nuclei. Finally, a few
strongly stained nuclei were detected in the granular layer
immediately below the cornified epithelium (Fig. 9B).
These nuclei appeared flattened and were distinct from
the round spinous and columnar basal cells. Approximately 50-60% of the suprabasal cells stained strongly for
RV2 ORF59. Our results demonstrate that the suprabasal
keratinocytes are infected with MneRV2 and express
nuclear ORF59 suggesting that they are actively replicating
the viral genome and producing infectious virions.

Discussion

Figure 9

We have compared the ORF59 homologs of members of
the RV1 and RV2 lineages of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses
from chimpanzee and three species of macaques. We
obtained the complete sequences of the ORF59 homologs
of the RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses from chimpanzee
(PtrRV1 and PtrRV2) and the cynomolgus macaque (RFHVMf and MfaRV2). These are the only complete gene
sequences presently determined for these rhadinovirus
species. We also obtained the complete ORF59 sequences
of the RV2 rhadinovirus from pig-tailed macaques
(MneRV2) and the RV1 homologs from pig-tailed and
rhesus macaques (RFHVMn and RFHVMm). We com-

pared the sequences obtained in the current study with
the published sequences of ORF59 from KSHV [9] and the
rhesus macaque RRV [14]. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the ORF59 sequences from these
viruses confirmed the existence of separate RV1 and RV2
lineages of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses in Old World primates, which was originally demonstrated using fragments of the viral DNA polymerase gene [22-25]. The
ORF59 sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses
strongly support a close evolutionary relationship
between KSHV and the RV1 rhadinoviruses from the
chimpanzee (PtrRV1) and macaque (RFHVMn, RFHVMm, and RFHVMf), while the rhesus macaque rhadinovirus, RRV, and the other RV2 rhadinoviruses constitute a
separate and distinct lineage of KSHV-like rhadinoviruses.
Within the RV1 lineage, the ORF59 sequences of the
human and chimpanzee rhadinoviruses, KSHV and
PtrRV1, respectively, were closely related, reflecting the
close evolutionary relationship of human and chimpanzee hosts. No RV2 rhadinovirus has yet been identified in
humans to date, so the relationship between the human
and chimpanzee RV2 rhadinoviruses is unknown. In both
the RV1 and RV2 lineages, the ORF59 sequences from the
M. mulatta and M. fascicularis rhadinoviruses clustered
together, with the M. nemestrina viral sequences as a distinct outgroup. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the
macaque species M. mulatta and M. fascicularis are more
closely related to each other than they are to the M. nemestrina species which evolved in a geographically distinct
area [38]. Thus, the phylogenetic clustering of the viral
ORF59 sequences from the different RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses mirrors the phylogenetic relationship of their
primate hosts, providing strong evidence for co-speciation
of the virus and host.
A comparison of the ORF59 sequences revealed a higher
conservation among the RV2 rhadinoviruses than was
observed for the RV1 rhadinoviruses from the same primate species, even though the RV1 and RV2 viruses appear
to have co-evolved within the same host species over the
same period of time. The amino acid conservation
between the chimpanzee and macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses was 64-65% whereas the conservation between the
chimpanzee and macaque RV1 rhadinoviruses was only
56-58%. Similarly, conservation between rhadinoviruses
from M. nemestrina and M. mulatta/M. fascicularis
macaque species was 88-89% for the RV2 lineage and
82% for the RV1 lineage. Finally, conservation between
the M. mulatta and M. fascicularis macaque species was
94.9% for the RV2 lineage and 93.8% for the RV1 lineage.
This suggests that the two viral lineages have experienced
different evolutionary pressures within the same host that
has directly affected the rate of divergence of the ORF59
gene. Functionally, the ORF59 gene family encodes a

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/205

DNA polymerase processivity factor which is required for
copying the viral genome during the replicative cycle of
the virus for the production of new virions. Our data suggests that an inherent difference in the biology of the RV1
and RV2 lineages has exerted an effect on the divergence
of the ORF59 gene.
Nevertheless, our studies show a strong sequence similarity between the ORF59 sequences of the RV1 and RV2
rhadinoviruses within the N-terminal 300 amino acids
with 45% of the amino acids conserved in all of RV1 and
RV2 species examined. Our truncation study indicated
that the N-terminal domains of the macaque RV2 rhadinovirus ORF59 proteins contain one or more antigenic
epitopes recognized in naturally infected macaques. This
contrasts with the epitopes of the ORF59 homologs of
KSHV and EBV (BMRF1) recognized by mice during development of murine monoclonal antibody reagents, which
cluster in the C-terminal ORF59 domain. Although only
6% of amino acid residues in the ~100 amino acid C-terminal domain were conserved across all of the RV1 and
RV2 species, a strongly lineage-specific conservation was
detected, especially within the macaque RV2 sequences.
We developed a rabbit anti-RV2 ORF59 polyclonal antiserum against the conserved C-terminal domain of the RRV
and MneRV2 ORF59 proteins. This antiserum reacts specifically with the ORF59 homologs of different macaque
RV2 rhadinoviruses and not with ORF59 homologs of
RV1 rhadinoviruses or with the related ORF59 homolog
(BMRF1) of EBV or macaque lymphocryptoviruses. The
antiserum does not react with the ORF59 homolog of the
chimpanzee RV2 rhadinovirus due to significant differences in the amino acid sequence of the chimpanzee virus
in the targeted C-terminal region.
We tested the immunoreactivity of the commercial monoclonal antibody developed against KSHV ORF59 with
the different macaque ORF59 proteins. Recombinant
ORF59 protein from the macaque RV1 rhadinovirus,
RFHVMn, reacted with the anti-KSHV ORF59 monoclonal
antibody. Surprisingly, this antibody also showed reactivity with the MneRV2 ORF59, but not the RRV ORF59.
Truncation studies have indicated that residues 279-301
in KSHV ORF59 constitute part of the epitope recognized
by anti-ORF59 monoclonal antibody 11D1[6]. Examination of this region in the ORF59 alignment in Figure 1,
revealed an amino acid substitution in aa292 from a Lys
in KSHV ORF59 to an Arg in RRV ORF59. All other RV1
and RV2 ORF59 sequences contained the Lys residue in
this region of high sequence conservation. These sequence
comparisons suggest that the Lys at residue 299 may compose part of the monoclonal epitope that is disrupted by
the Arg in the RRV ORF59 sequence.

In this study, we used the rabbit anti-RV2 ORF59 antiserum to analyze RV2 rhadinovirus infections of cultured
cells in vitro. Our results demonstrate that significant
numbers of fibroblast (RPFF) and epithelial (Vero) cells
express ORF59 after infection with RRV or the closely
related RV2 rhadinovirus from pig-tailed macaques,
MneRV2. ORF59 expression is localized to the nucleus of
infected cells in a non-uniform pattern. Our studies indicate that the RV2 infection in these cells spreads from an
initial focus of infection, detected as a single ORF59-positive cell, to adjacent cells that over time also become
ORF59 positive. Infection of adjacent cells could be due to
cell-cell transmission by passage of cell-associated virus
through physical contact, or due to a strong concentration
gradient of cell-free virus immediately surrounding the
infected ORF59-positive cell that results in preferential
infection of immediately adjacent cells. However, numerous cases were identified in our micrographs in which an
ORF59-negative cell was detected in close proximity to
one or more ORF59 positive cells (see cells immediately
adjacent to the labeled cells in panels 5F and I). This suggests that direct physical contact between infected and
non-infected cells is more important for virus transmission than proximity. We also continued to detect single
ORF59-positive cells during the 8 day incubation, indicative of de novo infections in the cell culture by cell-free
virus.
KSHV ORF59 is critical for replication of the viral genome
within the nucleus [6,10-12]. This processivity factor has
an arginine/lysine rich nuclear localization signal in its Cterminal domain that is responsible for targeting the protein to centers of replication in the nucleus [20,21]. We
identified homologous arginine/lysine rich domains in
both the chimpanzee and macaque RV1 and RV2 ORF59
proteins that could function to target the proteins to
nuclear replication centers.
Our data show a strong correlation between the expression and nuclear localization of the RV2 ORF59 proteins
and the replication of viral genomes and production of
infectious virus during RRV infection of RPFF cells. This
confirms previous studies that RRV infection of rhesus
fibroblasts cells is permissive (Desrosiers et al., 1997;
DeWire et al., 2003). Our studies demonstrate that Vero
cells are similar to RPFF cells in their ability to be infected
by and support the replication of RRV. The RRV-infected
Vero cell cultures showed high levels of nuclear ORF59positive cells, replicated viral genomes and infectious
virus released into the culture medium. The level of cellassociated viral genomes at 24 and 48 hours was comparable to that seen with RPFFs, but the level did not
increase as significantly over time. The amount of cell-free
virus in the culture medium of the infected Vero cells mirrored the results seen with infected RPFF cells. Interest-

ingly, the ORF59-positive RRV-infected Vero cells
displayed evidence of aggregation and syncytia formation
that was not evident with the RRV-infected RPFF cells. Further analysis of this phenomenon is ongoing. Our data do
not agree with a previous study, which indicated that Vero
cells did not support RRV replication (DeWire et al.,
2003). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, however, we utilized the 17577 isolate of RRV in our study,
while the DeWire study utilized the H26-95 isolate [26].
Previous microarray analysis has shown that RRV ORF59
mRNA expression initiates 12-24 hours post infection and
the levels increase significantly between 48 and 72 hours.
RRV ORF59 mRNA expression during this time course was
significantly inhibited by treatment of cells with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) suggesting that the orf59 gene could
be classified as an early-late viral gene whose expression is
dependent upon viral replication[34]. KSHV orf59 gene
expression is induced 10-24 hours after TPA induction of
latently-infected PEL cells [18,39], and mRNA abundance
was maximal 48 hours post-induction and with subsequent decline thereafter [18]. PAA treatment blocked the
majority of KSHV ORF59 protein synthesized at 24 hours,
indicating that it also belongs to the early-late class of viral
proteins [18]. We analyzed the expression of RRV ORF59
mRNA after RRV infection of RPFF cells using real-time
quantitative RT-qPCR and compared it to the expression
of several other RRV genes. RRV ORF59 mRNA expression
was first detected 8 hours post infection, similar to the
time frame for KSHV ORF59 mRNA expression after TPA
induction of latently infected cells. We found that RRV
ORF59 mRNA expression was concomitant with the
expression of the mRNA for the ORF50 viral activator, the
ORF9 DNA polymerase, and the ORF8 glycoprotein B.
The co-expression of these genes at early time points after
RRV infection of RPFF cells is consistent with a permissive
RRV infection and the onset of viral replication and production of infectious virions.
Using our rabbit RV2 ORF59 antiserum, we detected RV2
infections in keratinocytes within the differentiated epithelium of the skin of an MneRV2-infected pig-tailed
macaque. This is the first evidence for an RV2 rhadinovirus infection of a non-lymphoid cell in vivo. The anti-RV2
ORF59 antiserum gave low level and intermittent staining
of the columnar keratinocytes in the basal layer of the skin
epithelium in this animal. Cells in this layer consist of
stem cells and transit-amplifying cells, which are continuously dividing. These cells are the source of the suprabasal
cells that have migrated into the upper epithelial layers
and undergone terminal differentiation [40]. In our study,
we observed consistent and strong nuclear ORF59 staining in the nuclei of keratinocytes present in the more differentiated spinous and granular layers of the epithelium.
Whereas cells in the upper epithelium of uninfected ani-

mals typically lose their nuclei [40], we observed RV2
ORF59-positive nuclei throughout all layers of the
infected epithelia. This is reminiscent of papillomavirusinfected epithelia where the infected cells leave the basal
layer and remain active in the cell cycle due to the action
of the E7 oncoprotein [41]. As the papillomavirusinfected cells differentiate during their migration from the
basal layer, the replicative cycle of the virus is activated
with high-level expression of transcripts encoding viral
replication-associated proteins and late gene products.
The viral genomes are replicated and the virions are
assembled with the release of the mature virions from
nucleated cells present in the uppermost layers of the epithelium. Our results suggest that a similar phenomenon is
occurring in the epithelial cells infected with the RV2
rhadinoviruses. As in the case of the RPFF and Vero cells
undergoing permissive in vitro infection with the RV2
rhadinoviruses, the suprabasal epithelial cells in the skin
of the MneRV2 infected macaque were strongly reactive
with the anti-RV2 ORF59 antiserum in nuclei. In KSHV
infected cells, nuclear localization of ORF59 drives
nuclear import of the KSHV DNA polymerase during activation of the replicative cycle of the virus [20]. Our in vitro
results demonstrate a strong correlation of the expression
and nuclear localization of RV2 ORF59 with the replication of the viral genome and production of infectious virions. Our in vivo ORF59 staining results demonstrate that
suprabasal keratinocytes in differentiated skin epithelium
are infected with the RV2 rhadinovirus and express
nuclear ORF59 suggesting that they are actively replicating
the viral genome and producing infectious virions. Verification of this is ongoing.
Infectious KSHV virions are detected in the saliva of
infected individuals, and saliva is thought to be the major
route of transmission for de novo infections [42,43]. In
vitro tissue culture models support a role for differentiation of latently infected oral epithelial cells in the activation of KSHV replication and production of infectious
virions in saliva [44]. We have also detected RV2 rhadinovirus genomes in macaque saliva suggesting a similar
mode of transmission (unpublished results). Our immunohistochemical results indicate that epithelial differentiation is also an activating event to initiate virus replication
and production of infectious RV2 virions in latently
infected cells. The activation of virus replication detected
in our study would likely lead to the production and
release of infectious RV2 virions from skin epithelium in
addition to virus released into saliva from the oral epithelium. Current studies are ongoing to determine whether
skin epithelia plays a role in RV2 transmission, as occurs
with papillomavirus infections.

Conclusion
The ORF59 DNA polymerase processivity factor
homologs of the Old World primate RV1 and RV2 rhadinovirus lineages are phylogenetically distinct yet demonstrate similar expression, and localization characteristics
that correlate with their use as lineage-specific markers for
permissive infection and virus replication. The development of an antiserum specific for the ORF59 homologs of
macaque RV2 rhadinoviruses provides an approach to
studying the permissivity of RV2 rhadinovirus infection in
cell cultures in vitro and in the macaque in vivo. This will
aid in the characterization of virus activation from latency
to the replicative state, an important step for understanding the biology and transmission of rhadinoviruses, such
as RRV and KSHV.

Materials and methods
Tissue
Retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF) tumor tissue from M.
nemestrina (MneM78114), naturally infected with RFHVMn and MneRV2, was provided by C.-C. Tsai, Washington National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC). Spleen
tissue from Mne442N, an M. nemestria naturally infected
with RFHVMn and MneRV2, was obtained from R. Shibata, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. RF
tumor tissue from M. mulatta (MmuYN91-224), naturally
infected with RFHVMm, was kindly provided by the late
H. McClure (Yerkes National Primate Research Center).
Spleen tissue from an M. fascicularis (Mfa95044) naturally
infected with RFHVMf and MfaRV2 was obtained through
the Tissue Distribution Program at the WaNPRC. Tissue
samples from a chimpanzee naturally infected with
PtrRV1 and PtrRV2 were a gift from S. Shapiro at M.D.
Anderson. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks were obtained from a female M. nemestrina
(MneF94292) (WaNPRC) that was naturally infected with
simian retrovirus-2 and MneRV2.
Mammalian Cell Culture
Rhesus primary fetal fibroblasts (RPFF) were kindly provided by M. Axthelm, Oregon National Primate Research
Center (ONPRC) and grown in DMEM complete (Invitrogen) at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero) were obtained from M.E. Thouless,
University of Washington and grown in DMEM complete
at 37Â°C, 5% CO2 .
Rhadinovirus isolates
An isolate of the rhesus macaque RV2 rhadinovirus, RRV
strain 17577, was kindly provided by M. Axthelm and S.
Wong (ONPRC). The MneRV2 isolate J97167 obtained
from an M. nemestrina at the WaNPRC was described previously [30]. Virus stocks were prepared by infecting cultures of RPFF cells with either MneRV2 or RRV. Viral
particles were harvested from culture supernatant by high

speed centrifugation. or by concentration on a 50% OptiPrep (Iodixanol) cushion [45]. Virus stock was passed
through a 0.45 Î¼m filter prior to use.
OFR59 cloning and sequence analysis
The protein sequences of the ORF58, ORF59 and ORF60
genes from KSHV and RRV (NCBI) were aligned using
ClustalW. The consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) technique [46-48] was used to
design CODEHOP PCR primers from conserved amino
acid motifs within these genes to enable the amplification
and sequence analysis of this region within other Old
World primate RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses. Primers
NFFEa (ORF60) and PQFVb (ORF59) (see Table 1) were
designed based on the homology between KSHV and RRV
and used to amplify a portion of the orf59-60 intergenic
region of RFHVMn from spleen DNA from Mne442N.
Amplification reactions were performed on an iCycler
(BioRad) with Platinum TAQ (Invitrogen) using the supplied buffer, 2 mM MgCl2 and a 55-70Â°C temperature gradient. From the RFHVMn orf59 sequence obtained with
these primers, a specific primer, YGVRb, was identified
(Table 1). A CODEHOP PCR primer, WCFIb (Table 1),
designed from conserved sequence motifs identified in
the orf58 homologs of KSHV and RRV, was used with the
YGVRb primer to amplify the remainder of the orf59
allowing the determination of the complete RFHVMn
ORF59 sequence. A similar approach was used to amplify
the complete ORF59 genes from RFHVMm, RFHVMf,
PtrRV1, MneRV2, MfaRV2, PtrRV2 and human EBV
(BMRF1) using the primers shown in Table 1.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW and analyzed using the protein maximum-likelihood program
from the Phylip package, version 3.62 (University of
Washington, Seattle). Phylogenetic tree output was produced using TreeView (R.D.M. Page).
RT-qPCR assay for RRV mRNA expression
RPFF cells were plated at 2 Ã 105 in a 6-well plate and
grown overnight at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. The cells were incubated with purified RRV (MOI of ~0.01) for 2 hours,
washed several times and then further incubated at 37Â°C
for various times. The cells were harvested with trypsin
and pelleted by centrifugation. RNA was isolated using an
RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers instructions, treated with DNAase to remove contaminating viral
genomic DNA and converted to cDNA (250 ng of
DNAase-treated RNA, 50 pmoles of random decamer
primers (IDT), 0.5 mM dNTPs, M-MLV buffer (Promega)
and 1 unit M-MLV reverse transcriptase - 50 minutes at
42Â°C followed by inactivation at 70Â°C for 15 minutes).
SYBR green-based qPCR assays were developed to quantitate RRV mRNA levels for ORF8 (glycoprotein B), ORF9

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/205

(DNA Polymerase), ORF50 (viral transactivator), ORF73
(latency-associated nuclear antigen) and ORF59 (DNA
polymerase processivity factor). Amplification primers for
each gene were derived from the published RRV17577
genome sequence (NC_003401) (Table 4) [14]. PCR
amplification of cDNA was performed with IQ SYBR
Supermix (BioRad) with a 95Â°C denaturation step for 30
seconds, a 62Â°C annealing step for 30 seconds and elongation at 72Â°C for 30 seconds for 50 cycles. The presence
of contaminating viral DNA in the DNAase-treated RNA
was controlled for by eliminating reverse transcriptase in
the cDNA conversion. All of the assays were found to be >
95% efficient based on standard curves using 4-fold dilutions of DNA purified from RRV infected RPFF cells. Viral
mRNA expression was normalized to the cellular ribosomal phosphoprotein (RPO) mRNA levels detected by
RT-qPCR (see Table 4 for primers) using the delta cycle
threshold (ÎCT) method.

Bacterial expression of ORF59 proteins
pGEX-2T and pQE30 vectors were constructed to express
ORF59 homologs from different RV1 and RV2 rhadinoviruses fused to either GST or 6X-His, respectively. A sense
primer containing a BamHI site followed by the 5' coding
sequence downstream of the initiation codon ATG was
designed for each ORF 59 homolog except for PtrRV1 and
PtrRV2 for which the primers contained BglII sites. Antisense primers were derived from the 3' end of the individual ORF59 genes, and contained a stop codon and a HindIII site with the exception of the PtrRV1 primer which
had a BglII site. The primers were used to amplify the orf59
genes from the DNA templates shown in Table 1 with a
temperature gradient as described above. The PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction
enzymes and inserted into BamHI digested pGEX2T(PtrRV1) or BamHI and HindIII digested pGEX-2T to
produce GST-ORF59 fusion expression clones. The same
PCR fragments were inserted into digested pQE30 vector
to produce 6X-His ORF59 fusion expression clones. The
resulting plasmids were transfected into Rosetta 2 cells
(pGEX-2T) or M15 cells (pQE30). Bacteria were grown to
an OD600 of 0.7-1.0, induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and incubated for 5 hours. GST-fusion proteins were obtained by
sonication of the cell pellets, adsorption onto s-hexylglutathione-agarose (Sigma) and elution with 20 mM glutathione. 6XHis fusion proteins were obtained by lysis of
the bacterial cell pellets in 6 M guanidine, adsorption
onto Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), washing with 1 M urea
pH 6.3 and elution in 1 M urea pH 4.5.

each inserted into the pQE30 expression vector to produce N-terminal 6XHis-tagged ORF59 fusion polypeptides. Recombinant proteins were prepared in M15
bacteria, as described above. The two ORF59 polypeptides
were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose and reverse-phase
HPLC, combined as a single immunogen, and injected
into two rabbits, 424 and 425.
Western analysis
The ORF59 recombinant proteins were analyzed on Invitrogen 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels in MES buffer and
transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were
blocked with tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 and
5% non-fat milk prior to incubation with either a 1:1000
dilution of macaque plasma, a 1:10,000 dilution of 425
anti-RV2 ORF59 rabbit polyclonal serum, a 1:5,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-GST (Sigma), or a
1:10,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-RGS 6X His
(Qiagen). The membranes were then incubated with a
1:10,000 dilution of anti-human IgG-Dylight 700 for
macaque serum, anti-rabbit IgG-DyLight 800 or anti-

mouse IgG-Dylight 800 (Thermo Scientific). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized on an Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor). The Pageruler Plus prestained protein
ladder (Fermentas) was used for molecular weight estimation.
ORF59 immunofluorescence assays
Approximately 1.5-2.0 Ã 104 cells were plated onto 17 mm
spots in 60 mm Petri dishes in 100 Î¼L of complete DMEM
and were incubated overnight at 37Â°C. The cells were
infected at low MOI (100 Î¼L of purified RRV or MneRV2
at a dilution of 1:10) for 2 hours at 37Â°C. Virus was
removed and 150 Î¼L fresh media was added to each spot.
Cells were incubated for various times prior to fixation in
8% paraformaldehyde. Cells were stained with a 1:1000
dilution of HHV8-ORF59 mouse monoclonal (ABI) or a
1:650 dilution of polyclonal rabbit 425 anti-RV2 ORF59
antiserum. For visualization of ORF59, cells were stained
with a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa 594,
or goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). To identify
nuclei, cells were stained with a 1:500 dilution Topro-3

using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal confocal microscope.
RRV replication and production of infectious virions
RPFF or Vero cells were plated at 2 Ã 105 in a 6-well plate
and grown overnight at 37Â°C, 5% CO2. The cells were
incubated with purified RRV (MOI of ~0.01) for 2 hours,
washed several times and then further incubated at 37Â°C.
At 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 days post infection, the culture medium
was collected and the cells were harvested by trypsinization and low-speed sedimentation. DNA was extracted
from each cell pellet and from the combined culture
medium obtained from each well during the total incubation period. The levels of RRV DNA in the cultured cells
and medium were determined by real-time qPCR as
described [30]. To demonstrate the production of infectious virus in the cell cultures, culture medium was
removed from the RRV-infected RPFF and Vero cell cultures 5 days post-infection and incubated with uninfected
RPFF cell cultures for 2 hours. The cell cultures were
washed several times and further incubated. Five days
post infection, the level of RRV DNA in the culture
medium was determined by qPCR.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue slides were deparaffinized and heated in Target
Retrieval, pH 9 (DAKO) for 25 min followed by 20 min at
room temperature. This was followed by blocking steps
(0.3% H2O2 for 10 min, 0.15 M glycine/PBS for 15 min,
1% BSA and 10% normal horse serum in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween-20) for 30 min). The slides
were then incubated with the 425 rabbit anti-RV2 ORF59
antiserum (1:300 in TBST/BSA/NHS) for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was visualized with the Envision kit from DAKO. All incubation steps were
interspersed with washing-steps using TBST (3 Ã 5 min).
