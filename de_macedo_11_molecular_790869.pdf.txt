Abstract
Background: Since 1991 several outbreaks of acute coccidioidomycosis (CM) were diagnosed in the semi-arid
Northeast of Brazil, mainly related to disturbance of armadillo burrows caused by hunters while digging them for
the capture of these animals. This activity causes dust contaminated with arthroconidia of Coccidioides posadasii,
which, once inhaled, cause the mycosis. We report on the identification of C. posadasii in soil samples related to
outbreaks of CM.
Results: Twenty four soil samples had their DNA extracted and subsequently submitted to a semi-nested PCR
technique using specific primers. While only 6 (25%) soil samples were positive for C. posadasii by mice inoculation,
all (100%) were positive by the molecular tool.
Conclusion: This methodology represents a simple, sensitive and specific molecular technique to determine the
environmental distribution of Coccidioides spp. in endemic areas, but cannot distinguish the species. Moreover, it
may be useful to identify culture isolates. Key-words: 1. Coccidioidomycosis. 2. Coccidioides spp. 3. C. posadasii.

Background
Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis acquired by
inhalation of infective arthroconidia from Coccidioides
immitis or C. posadasii [1], which are pathogenic species of dimorphic fungi that live saprobiotically in soil
from arid regions of the western hemisphere [2]. The
largest known endemic area covers the southwestern
United States and all of semi-arid northern Mexico
[3,4]. Coccidioidomycosis also occurs in several semiarid
areas of Central and South America [5,6]. The most
recent endemic area was discovered in Brazil, where the
first two autochthonous cases acquired the infection in
semi-arid regions of the states of Bahia and Piauí in
1978 and 1979. Since then, several cases have been diagnosed in these states and also in the states of Ceará and
Maranhão [7,8].
Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii are the only
species included in the genus Coccidioides. These two
species are morphologically identical but genetically and

epidemiologically distinct [1,9]: C. immitis is geographically limited to California’s San Joaquin valley, whereas
C. posadasii is found in the remaining semi-arid areas
in the southwest of the United States, Mexico, Central
and South America.
Stewart & Meyer in 1932 reported the first isolation of
C. immitis from soil, proving that this substrate is the
primary source for coccidioidomycosis. They studied
soil samples collected from a disturbed site in the San
Joaquin river valley (California, USA) that was the possible source of an acute coccidioidomycosis outbreak [10].
Another important contribution to environmental studies on Coccidioides spp. was reported by Emmons in
1942, which was able to isolate the fungus from soil
samples and from wild rodents in a known endemic
area [11]. The fungus has been isolated by animal inoculation of a soil suspension in sterile saline, a method still
considered to be gold standard for detecting fungus in
environmental samples. As this method detects the
parasitic spherule form in animal tissues, it permits the
precise identification of Coccidioides spp. Unfortunately
it is also an expensive methodology with relatively low

sensitivity, and the results take a long time to obtain,
usually up to 45 days [7,12,13].
The method of simply culturing soil samples on cycloheximide containing media slants is also very laborious,
expensive, time consuming and of biological risk for the
laboratory personnel. Comparing this method with that
of animal inoculation, it is not able to demonstrate the
parasitic form, necessary to ascertain the isolation of
Coccidioides spp. [13].
In Brazil, the isolation of Coccidioides spp. from soil
by animal inoculation has been used in some environmental investigations of small outbreaks of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in armadillo hunters who
are used to dig armadillo’s burrows. Soil samples were
collected inside and around armadillo’s excavated burrows, ten to twenty samples, covering a small area of 4
to 6 m 2 . This method demonstrated the fungus in
around 15% of the soil samples and it is important to
emphasize that negative samples were often collected a
few centimeters away from the positive ones. Thus, it is
possible that viable elements of C. posadasii, with low
metabolic activity and/or with low virulence, may be
present in a soil sample but remain undetected by culture [7,14].
In the county of Oeiras, Piauí state, C. posadasii was
isolated from three (12.5%) out of 24 soil samples collected in and around an excavated armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus) burrow [7]. The same group of investigators obtained more environmental isolates of C. posadasii from soil samples related to excavation of armadillo
(D. novemcinctus) and paca (Cuniculus paca) burrows in
the county of Miguel Leão, Piauí [15-17].
Using multiplex PCR with two molecular markers,
Greene et al (2000) demonstrated the presence of C.
immitis in only four (0.55%) out of 720 soil samples collected in endemic areas of coccidioidomycosis in California (USA) [12].
The molecular identification of Coccidioides spp. in
environmental samples depends on several factors, especially the sampling site, storage conditions, processing
techniques, DNA extraction methods, and adequate
choice of the genetic target.
There is a growing need in the knowledge of the global geographical distribution of Coccidioides spp., their
focal distribution in endemic areas and their genetic
diversity in the environment. In fact the development of
efficient molecular tool for the environmental identification of Coccidioides spp. is a continuous challenge in
order to comprehend the ecology and biogeography of
this important pathogen.
The present study aimed to detect Coccidioides spp. in
soil samples, related to small outbreaks of CM, by culture and molecular methods.

Methods
The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee of the Center for Biological Evaluation and
Care of Research Animals at Fiocruz, no. P.0173-03
(COBEA at FIOCRUZ).
Environmental soil sampling

Twenty-four soil samples were collected from two different sites suspected to be contaminated by C. posadasii in the counties of Caridade do Piauí (7°43’59’’S, 40°
59’23’’W) and Elesbão Veloso (6°12’07’’S, 42°08’25’’W),
situated 447 km and 156 km, respectively, from Teresina, the capital of the state of Piauí, in the northeast
region of Brazil, which includes a vast semi-arid area.
Soil samples were collected, in both sites, in burrows
that were dug by the hunters who presented acute
respiratory CM 9 to 14 days after the risk activity. Ten
soil samples were collected in Elesbão Veloso (EV1EV10) and 14 were collected in Caridade do Piauí
(CP01, CP07, CP09 and CP12-CP22). The samples were
placed into 100 mL sterile bags to be processed in Rio
de Janeiro, at the Mycology Laboratory of IPEC/FIOCRUZ, according to both protocols: 1) animal inoculation in mice and 2) molecular detection. All soil
samples were kept at room temperature (ranging from
20 to 28°C) till the arrival at FIOCRUZ in Rio de
Janeiro.
As negative soil controls, eight environmental samples
were collected in the savanna of central Brazil: four in
Goiânia (LL 2611, 19 261101, V 2611 e C 261101) and
four in Brasília (DF21, DF22, DF23 e DF24).
Animal inoculation

The soil samples were processed and analyzed according
to the classical technique described by Stewart & Meyer
(1932), modified as follows: samples were weighed, and
1 g was mixed in 50 mL of 0.9% sterile saline with
chloramphenicol (500 mg/L). Each suspension was vortexed and allowed to settle for 30 minutes at room temperature (25°C). The supernatant was aspirated, and 1
mL was inoculated intraperitoneally into four albino
Swiss mice weighing 18-20 g. One control animal was
used for each soil sample [10]. Animal necropsy was
performed after four weeks of incubation or immediately
after an animal death before the end of the incubation
period. The animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber
according to recommendations of COBEA. Liver and
spleen samples were processed for a) direct mycological
microscopy in wet mount preparations with 10% KOH;
b) culture by inoculation onto Sabouraud 2% glucose
agar medium DIFCO® with and without cycloheximide;
and c) preservation in 10% formalin for histopathological study. Control animals were not inoculated, but

were maintained in a separate cage and subsequently
submitted to the same protocol as the inoculated animals. This method is considered the gold standard for
the isolation and identification of culture isolates suspected of being C. immitis or C. posadasii.
DNA extraction from soil

The DNA was obtained using the Fast DNA® SPIN® Kit
for soil (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Soil DNA was analyzed by
electrophoresis in 0.8% (w/v) agarose gels in TrisBorate-EDTA buffer as well as in a spectrophotometer
at 260 nm absorbance (Beckman DU-600) to check its
amount, purity and molecular size. Final DNA obtained
from soil samples had large molecular length (> 10 kb)
and the humic acids contamination was not observed in
electrophoresis gel. Therefore, DNA samples could be
used as template to amplify 28S rDNA by PCR. DNA
extracts were amplified by Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using 1 μl of the extract (5 to 10 ng of DNA g
soil-1) per 50 μl of reaction.
Characterization of soil-extracted DNA

Soil-extracted DNA was amplified using the universal
primers U1 and U2, which amplify a 260-bp product of
a subunit of 28S fungal rDNA, to demonstrate the
absence of PCR inhibitors and the presence of fungi in
the sample, as described previously [18]. A negative control without DNA was included in all amplifications.

Design of specific primers for Coccidioides

Initially, a BLASTn [20] search of GenBank revealed
that the specific probe (5’-TCTGGCGGTTGGTT-3’) for
C. immitis proposed by Sandhu et al. (1995) presents
100% similarity with three C. immitis 28S rDNA
sequences deposited in the database [18]. However, this
probe also presents 100% similarity with more than two
hundred sequences of several other soil fungi and bacteria, leading the development of a new probe specific
for Coccidioides. To obtain this new probe, all the 28S
rDNA sequences of Coccidioides spp. and all other fungi
deposited at GenBank until June 22, 2010, were aligned
using the CLUSTAL X software [21]. Probes were
designed based on conserved sequences of Coccidioides
spp., and BLASTn software was used to identify specific
probes for Coccidioides [20]. A probe designated RFA12
(5’-TCCCCCATGCTCCGGGCC-3’) presented 100%
sensitivity and specificity for all 22 sequences of Coccidioides (8 of C. immitis and 14 of C. posadasii) deposited at GenBank until June 2008 and was used together
with an previously described probe P2 (5’CTCTGGCTTCACCCTATTC-3’) [18] to amplify a fragment of Coccidioides 28S rDNA of around 375 bp. It
was also evaluated the efficiency of a semi-nested PCR
system, by using the pair of primers RFA12 and RFA13
(5’-TAATCATTCGCTTTACCTCA-3’) which amplify a
fragment around 520 bp, in a step before the using of
RFA12 and P2 primers.
Standardization of PCR from soil samples

DNA extraction from clinical and environmental isolates
of Coccidioides spp

DNA of 21 clinical and environmental isolates of Coccidioides spp. was included in this study. From the Fungal
Culture Collection at IOC/FIOCRUZ, six were identified
as C. immitis (USA) and two as C. posadasii (Argentina);
thirteen (nine clinical and four environmental) isolates
identified as C. posadasii from Piauí/Brazil were preserved
at the Laboratory of Mycology at IPEC/FIOCRUZ [19].
DNA of other species of fungi and bacteria

DNA of several species of fungi (41) and bacteria (3)
were included in the study: Sporothrix schenckii (5);
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (5); Histoplasma capsulatum (2); Aspergillus niger (3); Aspergillus fumigatus (3);
Aspergillus nidulans (3); Blastomyces dermatitidis (1);
Microsporum canis (1); Trichophyton rubrum (1); Trichophyton mentagrophytes (1); Cryptococcus neoformans
(6); C. gattii (10); Rhodococcus equi (1); Mycobacterium
avium (1); and Paenibacillus sp. strain 9500615. The
isolates were preserved at the Laboratory of Mycology at
IPEC/FIOCRUZ or obtained from soil samples preserved at the Laboratório de Ecologia Microbiana Molecular of IMPPG/UFRJ.

To standardize a sensitive and specific molecular tool
for detecting Coccidioides spp. in soil, the following
steps were performed:
PCR for cultured microorganisms

The PCR reaction mixture consisted of 1 μl of genomic
DNA suspended in a mixture 5 μl 10 × PCR buffer (10
mM Tris (pH 9.0), 500 mM KCl), 2.5 μl of 10 mM
dNTPs, 5 μl 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 μl of each primer
(RFA12/P2; 10 pmol/μl), 1.25 μl of 5 U AmpliTaq DNA
polymerase, and 33.25 μl of MilliQ water. PCR amplification was performed with the primers (RFA12/P2) in a
DNA thermal cycler. The temperature profile included
an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 5 min; 30 cycles
of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min 30 s, and 72°C for 1
min; followed by a single terminal extension at 72°C for
3 min. As negative control, water instead of template
was performed at all PCR reactions.
Semi-nested PCR for cultured microorganisms

The reaction mixture of the the primary round PCR
(RFA12/RFA13) consisted of 1 μl of DNA extract in a
total volume of 50 μl with 5 μl 10 × PCR buffer (10
Mm Tris (pH 9.0), 500 mM KCl), 2.5 μl 10 mM dNTPs,

5 μl 25 mM MgCl 2, 1 μl of each primer (10 pmol/μl),
1.25 μl of 5 U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and 33.25 μl
of MilliQ water. The reaction cycles included an initial
denaturation step at 94°C for 5 min; 20 cycles of 94°C
for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min; followed by a single terminal extension at 72°C for 3 min.
Reaction mixtures of 2° PCR round (RFA12/P2) was
identical, except by primers and 1 μl of the first reaction
was added as template to the second reaction. Reaction
mixtures with second primer set (RFA12/P2) were thermally cycled once at 94°C for 5 min, 30 times at 94°C
for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a single terminal extension at 72°C for 3 min.

0.5 μl of negative soil DNA (soil from an area without
coccidioidomycosis) was added to 0.5 μl of each pure
and diluted DNA sample in triplicate. All products
obtained by direct PCR and semi-nested PCR were subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel with 1 ×
TBE buffer (89 mM Tris-borate, 2.5 mM EDTA [pH
8.0]) for 2 h, and a 1 Kb DNA Ladder (Promega) served
as molecular marker. The gel was then stained for 15
min with 0.5 μg ml-1 ethidium bromide and observed
under short-wavelength ultraviolet light. The image was
captured by an IMAGO system.

The reaction mixture of the primary PCR consisted of 1
μl of DNA extract in a total volume of 50 μl with 5 μl

35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 1 min 30 s, and 72°
C for 2 min, followed by a single terminal extension at
72°C for 3 min.
Semi-nested PCR from soil

The reaction mixture of the primary round PCR
(RFA12/RFA13) consisted of 1 μl of DNA extract in a
total volume of 50 μl with 5 μl 10 × PCR buffer (10
mM Tris (pH 9.0), 500 mM KCl), 1 μl 10 mM dNTPs,
2.5 μl 50 mM MgCl2, 1 μl of each primer (10 pmol/μl),
0.5 μl 10 mg/μl BSA, 0.5 μl 100% formamide, 0.5 μl of 5
U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and 37 μl MilliQ. The
reaction cycles included an initial denaturation step at
94°C for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 1
min 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, and a single terminal
extension at 72°C for 3 min. Reaction mixtures of 2°
PCR round was identical, except by primers and that 1
μl of the first reaction was added as template to the second reaction. Reaction mixtures with second primer set
(RFA12/P2) were thermally cycled once at 94°C for 5
min, 35 times at 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 1 min 30 s, and
72°C for 2 min, and a single terminal extension at 72°C
for 3 min. A negative control without DNA was
included in all amplifications.
Evaluation of sensitivity of the semi-nested PCR

The sensitivity of the semi-nested PCR method was
determined with primers specific for C. immitis (RFA12/
RFA13 and RFA12/P2) using DNA of a C. posadasii isolate, either pure (without dilution) or diluted by 10-2,
10-3 and 10-4 in water free of DNAse and RNAse. Next,

C. posadasii was isolated by intraperitoneal inoculation
into mice, from 6 (25%) out of the 24 soil samples studied: 3 out of 10 (30%) from Elesbão Veloso and 3 out
of 14 (21.4%) from Caridade do Piauí.
Molecular methods

The DNA obtained from each soil sample was of excellent quality, with its molecular weight concentrated
above 1.5 kb
PCR and semi-nested PCR applied to DNA of cultured of
Coccidioides spp. and controls

Direct PCR with primers specific for Coccidioides spp.
(RFA12/P2) was able to identify 19 out of the 21 Coccidioides spp. isolates tested, which presented the specific
375-bp band. However, semi-nested PCR using the same
primers, RFA12/RFA13 and RFA12/P2, was able to
identify all the 21 isolates tested (Figures 1 and 2). The
same direct and semi-nested PCR methodologies presented negative results when applied to DNA of all species of other different pathogenic fungi and bacteria.
These results demonstrate the high specificity of the primers developed in this study and highlight the increased
sensitivity, expected in semi-nested PCR reactions from
environmental samples.
PCR and semi-nested PCR applied to soil DNA samples

The DNA obtained from the soil samples was submitted
to direct PCR and semi-nested PCR using the same primer system. Only 8 out of 24 (33.3%) soil samples presented the specific 375-bp band by direct PCR: 2/10 from
Elesbão Veloso and 6/14 from Caridade do Piauí (Data
not shown). However, using semi-nested PCR with the
primers RFA12/RFA13 and RFA12/P2, all the soil samples presented the specific 375-bp band indicative of Coccidioides spp. (Figure 3). By the same molecular method,
the DNA obtained from the soil of central Brazil presented 100% negative results. The results comparing both
classical and molecular methods to detect Coccidioides
spp. in soil samples are summarized in Table 1.

detecting specific sequences of Coccidioides spp

Semi-nested PCR with primers specific for Coccidioides
spp. (RFA12/RFA13 and RFA12/P2) when applied to
DNA of C. posadasii in serial dilutions was sufficiently
sensitive to detect specific C. immitis 28S rDNA, generating a product of 375-bp, as visualized in a 1.2% agarose gel (Figure 4).

Discussion
Inoculation into mice has long been the classical
method for isolating and identifying pathogenic fungi
present in environmental samples such as soil. Many
studies have been performed over several decades,
mainly by intraperitoneal inoculation into albino, nonisogenic and non-immunocompromised mice, thereby
producing knowledge on the geographic distribution,
natural habitats and environmental microfoci of pathogenic fungi, especially Histoplasma and Coccidioides spp.
Due to its nature, the animal model works as a biological filter, selecting species or lineages thermo tolerant
to 35 - 37°C with metabolic and genetic properties that
permit their survival and multiplication in mammalian
tissues. Usually, when suspected soil material is inoculated intraperitoneally, the saprobic microbiota composed of bacteria and fungi are blocked and eliminated
by the immune system of the inoculated mice. In the
presence of fungal agents of systemic mycoses, they may
multiply and disseminate to regional lymph nodes and

other organs like the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, skin
and/or central nervous system. Spleen and liver were
the organs that allowed the highest positivity for isolating Coccidioides spp. of the inoculated mice [10].
Coccidioides spp. isolates have been obtained from
soil samples of known endemic areas. Usually, the
positivity is very low when the samples are collected
randomly, even in endemic areas; however, when sampling is directed to a specific suspected site related to
cases of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis with a
consistent epidemiological history of dust inhalation,
the probability of obtaining positive samples increases
significantly. In fact, such sites may harbor microfoci
of Coccidioides spp. where they find suitable ecological
conditions to multiply and reach high spore concentrations in restricted areas. These quantitative aspects
have been demonstrated for Cryptococcus neoformans
and C. gattii through plating onto selective Niger Seed
agar (NSA) medium, which allows the concentration of
viable fungal propagules to be estimated [22]. Nevertheless, this plating method is not used to detect the
agents of coccidioidomycosis due to its high biological
risk and because other fast-growing saprobic fungi may
lead to misidentification. Thus, there are no adequate
tools for estimating the concentration of Coccidioides
spp. elements in various substrata, natural habitats or
environmental sources related to outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis, where high concentrations of the fungus may exist.

The low frequency of C. immitis isolation from soil
samples may be due to seasonal variations or a nonhomogeneous distribution in the soil. A study conducted in the US investigated environmental samples
collected over eight years in the same endemic area
detected the presence of C. immitis, ranging from 0 43% [14]. Few environmental isolates of C. immitis and
C. posadasii from endemic areas of Mexico and the
United States are available for scientific purposes.

epidemiology of Coccidioides spp. were based mainly on
clinical isolates from different geographical regions [1,9].
Therefore, environmental isolates of C. posadasii from
semi-arid northeastern Brazil are of interest for these
studies.
Regarding the environmental samples collected in and
around two excavated armadillo (D. novemcinctus) burrows in Elesbão Veloso and Caridade do Piauí, we
obtained positivity rates of 30% and 21.4%, respectively,
using the mouse inoculation method. These rates seem
very satisfactory when compared to literature data
Greene et al. 2000 [12]. The low number of soil samples
collected in a specific contaminated habitat excavated
during armadillo hunting may have contributed to these
results. Moreover, it should be taken into consideration
that only a small amount (1 g) from each soil sample
was examined after suspending it in 50 mL of saline,
from which only 0.5 mL was inoculated into each
mouse. Thus, it is possible that viable propagules of
Coccidioides spp. present in the sample were not inoculated, producing a false negative result. Beyond the
quantitative aspect, the animal model is incapable of
detecting lineages unable to grow at 37°C or present in
numbers too low to invade and grow in mammalian tissues. On the other hand, propagules with low metabolic
activity can remain in latency in soil. In fact, most
aspects of the population structure of Coccidioides spp.
in the environment remain unknown.
Curiously, during the investigation of the samples from
Caridade do Piauí, the same method of animal inoculation permitted the simultaneous isolation of C. posadasii
and Cryptococcus neoformans from one soil sample, while
C. neoformans was isolated from another soil sample that
was negative for C. posadasii. These findings demonstrate the complexity of the fungal microbiota in environmental habitats, such as in this case of D. novemcinctus.
These habitats are not exclusive to armadillos, but they
are shared with wild rodents, snakes, scorpions, birds and
many insects. In the surroundings of this armadillo burrow, it was observed a resting site of Zenaida auriculata,
a New World tropical dove endemic to South America,

that appear periodically in this region. It is possible that
Coccidioides spp., Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii,
interacting together and/or with other living elements of
the soil microbiota, as well as with several other hosts,
may generate adaptations and select lineages of these
pathogenic fungi. The demonstration of naturally
acquired coccidioidomycosis in D. novemcinctus armadillos captured in Piauí reinforces the complexity of this
subject [23]. Nevertheless, there have been no investigations of naturally acquired coccidioidomycosis in other
species of armadillos, or in other animals such as rodents,
foxes, goats, horses, donkeys, cattle and other mammals.
Molecular biological techniques have been used to
identify pathogenic fungi. Sandhu et al. (1995) analyzed
116 cultures of several human pathogenic fungi using
the universal primers U1 and U2 to amplify the conserved 28S rDNA region of fungi, which was then hybridized with probes specific for each fungal species [18].
Sixteen clinical isolates of C. immitis tested by this
method demonstrated 100% positivity in identifying this
species.
Another approach used for the identification of isolates of C. immitis is direct PCR using primers with
nucleotide sequences based on the gene csa, which is a
19-kDa specific C. immitis antigen secreted in the
growth phase of fungal cultures that generates a product
of about 519 bp [24]. In another study, Bezerra et al.
(2006) obtained 100% positivity analyzing the DNA of
19 cultures of C. immitis: twelve clinical isolates from
the state of Piauí and seven isolates preserved for 50-75
years in the culture collection of the Department of
Mycology from the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz at FIOCRUZ
in Rio de Janeiro [19].
Regarding the development of molecular methods for
the detection of Coccidioides spp. directly in soil samples, obtaining an adequate DNA preparation represented a large challenge. Using mechanical agitation
followed by direct cellular enzymatic lysis, we obtained
DNA samples with a molecular weight concentrated
above 1.5 kb, which were suitable for the amplification
reactions by PCR. It should be mentioned that only

recently adequate equipment and a Fast DNA SPIN kit
for soil (QBIOgene, Carlsbad, CA, USA) allowed the
attainment of this suitable DNA from soil samples.
In the present study, the primers designed to detect
Coccidioides spp. 28S rDNA in soil took into consideration the low number of copies of the target DNA present in soil. This permitted the detection of Coccidioides
spp. 28S rDNA in six isolates from the USA and two
from Argentina, as well as in thirteen Brazilian isolates.
The molecular detection of any of the Coccidioides species in soil or in clinical specimens is of equal
importance.
Optimization of direct PCR with specific primers to
detect C. immitis was first performed with DNA
extracted from 21 lineages of Coccidioides spp. (eight
from the Fungal Culture Collection at IOC/FIOCRUZ,
and nine clinical and four environmental isolates from
the state of Piauí preserved at the Laboratory of Mycology of IPEC/FIOCRUZ). In this way, we detected a 28S
rDNA fragment with a product of nearly 375 bp in 19
out of the 21 isolates tested. However, applying a seminested PCR system to these DNA samples with a new
pair of primers specific for Coccidioides spp., we
detected bands of sizes compatible with the expected
fragment in the DNA of all cultures tested. As a control,
the DNA of 41 lineages of other human pathogenic
fungi (S. schenckii, P. brasiliensis, H. capsulatum, A.
niger, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, B. dermatitidis, M.
canis, T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, C. neoformans and
C. gattii) were submitted to the same protocol, and all
results were negative. The results were also negative
when the protocol was applied to DNA from bacteria.
Our results indicate the high specificity of PCR with
these primers and highlight the increased sensitivity,
expected in nested PCR reactions using DNA obtained
from soil samples. The next step was to optimize direct
PCR with specific primers for detecting Coccidioides
spp. in the DNA extracted from our 24 soil samples.
The direct PCR method revealed the expected fragment
only in 8 (33.3%) soil samples, but when the semi-nested
system was used, all the soil samples were positive, thus

confirming to be a very sensitive method for detecting
Coccidioides spp. 28S rDNA. It is important to note that
all of the positive soil samples were collected in and
around armadillo burrows strongly suspected to be
heavily contaminated because their disturbance caused
acute cases of human and canine coccidioidomycosis. It
is possible that these restricted sites harbor high concentrations of viable arthroconidia of C. immitis, which
are easily detected by animal inoculation, as well as dormant or dead fungal elements with DNA partially preserved, which can only be detected by molecular tools.
To evaluate these factors, it should be of interest to analyze soil samples collected in concentric circles from the
center of the focus.
As controls for the PCR protocols applied to our soil
samples from Piauí, we analyzed DNA extracted from
soil samples collected in non-endemic areas of the cities
of Goiânia (capital of the state of Goiás) and Brasília
(Capital of Brazil), and none presented the 375-bp band,
reinforcing our results. Thus, we believe it is important
to note that the primer system RFA12 + P2 was able to
identify both C. immitis and C. posadasii.
The molecular detection of Coccidioides spp. in suspected soil or in clinical specimens has obvious importance for epidemiological studies and laboratory diagnosis
of coccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, molecular procedures
such as PCR present substantial advantages, as they reduce
the biological risk inherent in the classical techniques and
reduce the time necessary to identify a suspected environmental focus or diagnose a clinical case to a few hours. On
the other hand, this 28S rDNA marker is not able to distinguish C. immitis from C. posadasii in positive soil samples. However, other markers can be used to detect these
specific species. Umeyama et al. (2006) describe speciesspecific primers for C. immitis based on the ITS1 and
ITS4 region, and they were able to differentiate isolates of
C. immitis and C. posadasii [25].
The methodology described in the present study was
found to be a sensitive and specific tool for detecting
Coccidioides spp. in soil. We believe that the RFA12 +
P2 primer system will be useful for epidemiological
investigations of clinical cases as well as for environmental studies to identify hazardous sites in Brazil and
elsewhere.

Conclusions
This study introduced a simple, sensitive and specific
molecular technique to determine the environmental
distribution of Coccidioides spp. in endemic areas, but
cannot distinguish the species.
