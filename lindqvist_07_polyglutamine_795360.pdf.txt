Abstract
Background: A controversial topic in evolutionary developmental biology is whether morphological
diversification in natural populations can be driven by expansions and contractions of amino acid repeats
in proteins. To promote adaptation, selection on protein length variation must overcome deleterious
effects of multiple correlated traits (pleiotropy). Thus far, systems that demonstrate this capacity include
only ancient or artificial morphological diversifications. The Hawaiian Islands, with their linear geological
sequence, present a unique environment to study recent, natural radiations. We have focused our
research on the Hawaiian endemic mints (Lamiaceae), a large and diverse lineage with paradoxically low
genetic variation, in order to test whether a direct relationship between coding-sequence repeat diversity
and morphological change can be observed in an actively evolving system.
Results: Here we show that in the Hawaiian mints, extensive polyglutamine (CAG codon repeat)
polymorphism within a homolog of the pleiotropic flowering time protein and abscisic acid receptor FCA
tracks the natural environmental cline of the island chain, consequent with island age, across a period of 5
million years. CAG expansions, perhaps following their natural tendency to elongate, are more frequent
in colonists of recently-formed, nutrient-rich islands than in their forebears on older, nutrient-poor
islands. Values for several quantitative morphological variables related to reproductive investment, known
from Arabidopsis fca mutant studies, weakly though positively correlate with increasing glutamine tract
length. Together with protein modeling of FCA, which indicates that longer polyglutamine tracts could
induce suboptimally mobile functional domains, we suggest that CAG expansions may form slightly
deleterious alleles (with respect to protein function) that become fixed in founder populations.
Conclusion: In the Hawaiian mint FCA system, we infer that contraction of slightly deleterious CAG
repeats occurred because of competition for resources along the natural environmental cline of the island
chain. The observed geographical structure of FCA variation and its correlation with morphologies
expected from Arabidopsis mutant studies may indicate that developmental pleiotropy played a role in the
diversification of the mints. This discovery is important in that it concurs with other suggestions that
repetitive amino acid motifs might provide a mechanism for driving morphological evolution, and that
variation at such motifs might permit rapid tuning to environmental change.

Background
The genetic mechanisms underlying organismal radiations are of great interest to biologists. Whereas genetic
redundancy, differential regulation of gene transcription,
and alternative RNA splicing to produce protein variants
have each been implicated as fundamental means by
which evolution has tinkered with morphology, less
importance has been demonstrated for specific amino
acid (AA) substitutions in coding regions [1-5]. A prominent reason for this difference is that the first three mechanisms can better escape deleterious effects caused by
pleiotropy (the covariation of phenotypic traits) [1]. Still,
AA motifs of varying lengths in pleiotropic proteins [6,7]
have been correlated with morphological radiations, but
only at the level of entire subphyla (deep time) [8,9] or
among artificially selected dog breeds (historical time)
[10,11].

In the rice FCA homolog a 9-residue polyQ tract occurs
directly C-terminal to its WW protein-protein interaction
domain [23], which in Arabidopsis is crucial for proper
self-processing of FCA pre-mRNA [20]. We document that
the Hawaiian endemic mints show considerable length
variation at the same glutamine repeat and that this variation is temporally coincident with the emergence and subsidence of islands in the Hawaiian chain. Since
polymorphic polyQ tracts in mammalian proteins are
known to be responsible for a number of human neurological disorders at critical lengths [24], we considered the
possibility that the mint FCA-like repeat motif could also
have phenotypic consequences. Here, we describe how
FCA-like polyQ variation and its island-wise distribution
may have contributed to the rapid morphological diversification of the Hawaiian mints.

Results and Discussion
Here we present a case in which shifting length of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in a highly pleiotropic protein
may contribute to morphological radiation and incipient
speciation along a natural geological gradient of Pliocene
to modern age. The Hawaiian Islands are an isolated volcanic archipelago formed by plate movement over a mantle plume, with the consequence that islands evolve and
subside in a linear geographic manner [12]. The three genera and ca. 60 species of endemic mints (Lamiaceae) represent one of the largest Hawaiian plant radiations. They
originated from polyploid (likely octoploid) North American ancestors and diversified from a single introduction
to the Hawaiian Islands [13,14]. Their morphological and
ecological variation is extensive; plants range from subalpine vines to rainforest shrubs, flowers may have either
bird or insect pollinated anatomies, and seed dispersal
patterns may depend on either dry or fleshy fruits [15]. In
contrast to this extensive diversity, however, genetic variation in nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequence markers
has been found to be remarkably low, resulting in a lack
of phylogenetic resolution among representatives of the
two largest genera, Phyllostegia and Stenogyne [13].
We isolated a FCA homolog from an expressed sequence
tag (EST) library for the Hawaiian endemic mint Stenogyne
rugosa (Lamiaceae) [16]. The FCA protein of Arabidopsis,
originally isolated as a flowering time gene [17], is a receptor for the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) [18].
Although highly pleiotropic [19], FCA is nonetheless
finely autoregulated [20] such that flowering time is modulated in different mutant alleles [19,21]. Phenotypic features of fca mutant plants, likely linked to late flowering,
include increased leaf number, leaf area, and size of petals, stamens, carpels and fruits [19]. An additional phenotype is reduction of the secondary root system [18,22].

The polyglutamine tract in FCA-like proteins varies in
length
Before extensive experimentation with the mints, we
investigated the organismic distribution of the polyQ tract
by surveying databases for FCA homologs. We found FCAlike proteins only in land plants, but these extended in
phylogenetic depth to mosses, which diverged from seed
plants over 400 My (million years) ago [25]. Substantial
variation in the polyQ repeat was obvious among species,
and multiple Triticum FCA-like proteins in the database
demonstrated polyQ polymorphism (Figure 1; see also
Additional file 1).
Extensive polyglutamine polymorphism among the
Hawaiian mints
We genotyped 92 different Hawaiian mint individuals
(representing 44 species and five presumed hybrid taxa)
for polyQ variation (Additional file 2). A total number of
19 different alleles were discovered, with multiple alleles
in some individuals (up to 11 in one presumed hexadecaploid individual, with an average of 2.9 alleles per individual), and an allele size range of 81–135 base pairs (bp)
(see Additional file 2). Direct sequencing of selected individuals (including homozygotes) confirmed the repeat
pattern, with an allele size of 87 bp corresponding to one
CAG repeat, and therefore a range of 0–17 Q residues and
one AA deletion at 81 bp (Figure 2).

For further analysis of the observed variation, we pooled
alleles across the current taxonomy [15] since (i)
sequence-based evidence for intergeneric hybridization,
(ii) amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
data indicating interspecific gene flow [13], and (iii) considerable non-hierarchical EST-SSR diversity [16,26]
together suggest that the Hawaiian mints may best be considered a metapopulation expressing only emergent mac-

The overall distribution of FCA-like allele frequencies

99–102 bp (5–6 repeats), but in particular, its right tail
where polyQ repeats are longest renders the distribution

shift to the left with increasing island age (Figure 3). This
pattern is further demonstrated by repeat length variation
being significantly different (Kruskal-Wallis or one-way
ANOVA, P < 0.001) on an island-to-island basis, with
shorter repeats found on older islands, and longer ones on
younger islands (Figure 4). Post hoc Tamhane's T2 tests
revealed stepwise significant differences that reflect island
age (Table 1).
CAG repeats are known to be prone to elongation via replication slippage [27]. Theoretical and empirical work on
non-CAG SSRs has suggested that expansion rates for particular repeat loci are basically constant, whereas contrac-

tion rates appear to be exponential [28]. Under this
model, at a certain critical repeat length the two rates
should be equal and repeat allele frequencies should be
normal at equilibrium. However, this critical value, and
the allele equilibrium, can of course shift under selection.
Since mint populations on younger islands (longer
repeats; Figure 4) likely descend from those present
already on older ones (shorter repeats, Figure 4) [12],
under a constant rate of CAG expansion our data are consistent with critical allele lengths decreasing with island
age as islands form and subside and selection pressures
increase.

To bolster the case that the observed allelic distributions
are specific to FCA-like genes, we genotyped equally large
sets of Hawaiian mint individuals for several other ESTSSR loci [16], and the FCA homolog was the only locus
that displayed a clear geographic repeat progression (two
such counterexamples are shown in Figure 5) [26]. To
investigate further, we also genotyped a large number of
individuals (N = 53) of the Hawaiian mints' parent lineage within the genus Stachys, which have stable, continental distributions [14]. This group followed the expected
pattern, with an average inferred repeat length (4 repeats)
slightly lower than that for Kaua'i (4.33 repeats).

Figure allele lengths of FCA homologs shift with island age in the Hawaiian chain
Average4
Average allele lengths of FCA homologs shift with island age in the Hawaiian chain. Longer alleles are more frequent on younger islands. The mean differences are statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA, P < 0.001). See Table 1
for island-island Tamhane's tests. X-axis, island age (in millions of years, decreasing, as indicated next to representative volcanoes [12]). Whiskers indicate ± 0.5 standard deviations around the means.

Morphological variables correlate with glutamine repeat
lengths
To examine the possible involvement of the polyQ repeat
in the pleiotropic function of the FCA-like protein, we
analyzed correlations between repeat length and measures for selected morphological variables [15]. We used
average repeat lengths as placeholders for genotypes. We
found significant positive associations (using linear
regression) of FCA-like allele length with several features
related to reproductive investment (Table 2). Although R2

values were relatively low, as might be expected from subtle developmental influence, slopes were similar: allele
length always increased with values of quantitative morphological variables (Figure 6). Importantly, none of
these traits showed significant island-wise partitioning
(Kruskal-Wallis or one-way ANOVA, P > 0.05), which suggests genotype-phenotype correlation independent from
geography. Furthermore, none of the reproductive features showed significant correlation with allele lengths of
the other loci figured in Figure 5[26]. Taken together,

these results support the hypothesis that the observed
phenotypes may be linked to FCA-like genotypes rather
than to underlying population structuring. It follows from
this hypothesis that longer and longer FCA-like alleles
may be equivalent to Arabidopsis fca mutants of increasing severity [21], for which later flowering times would be
expected to increase reproductive investment [19]. However, Hawaiian mints are perennials, unlike annual Arabidopsis, so vegetative-reproductive intervals will require
detailed study to assess correlation with FCA polyQ length
variation.
We also investigated the possible influence of taxonomic
effects using partitioned regression analyses. These experiments were meant to control for any lineage-based effects
that could reflect underlying (yet undiscovered) population structuring. Indeed, for six of seven morphological
variables, data based on Phyllostegia alone showed significance, but for one of these seven traits, both Stenogyne and
Phyllostegia data points produced significant regression
lines. In every case, R2 increased in each taxonomically
partitioned analysis (Table 2). Clearly then, morphospecies assigned to Phyllostegia provide most of the allelic correlation in our pooled analysis of Hawaiian mints.
Nevertheless, taxonomic partitioning among the FCA-like
alleles alone could be excluded, since repeat lengths were
not significantly different between the genera Phyllostegia
and Stenogyne (Mann-Whitney U, P = 0.206). Our interpretation is that the FCA-like protein may be only one factor regulating polygenic trait differences underlying
morphological distinction between the currently recognized genera.
We also performed island-wise regression analyses, the
results of which (excluding spurious significance for
O'ahu, which has marginal sample size N = 12) demonstrated that three reproductive morphological variables
significantly correlated with FCA-like allele length on
younger islands only (Table 2). These findings echo the
right-hand tail on the FCA homolog allele distributions
(Figure 3).
Selection in the context of the Hawaiian environment
An easily understood whole-island selective force that
may be operating to reduce CAG repeat length over time
is the well-known nutrient cline of the Hawaiian Island
chain. Phosphorus (P), in particular, leaches from volcanic soils as they age, generating a competitive environment for plant growth [29]. Another growthcompromising factor that may have influenced presentday older islands is periodic drying during glacial periods
[30]. Although we were not able to directly observe it,
competition may be manifested at the level of the fca root
phenotype (reduced secondary root systems [18,22])
since it has been shown that availability of P can have a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/105

dramatic effect on root dynamics in the Hawaiian Islands.
Sites low in P on Kaua'i show greater living fine-root mass
and root length density than do younger sites on Hawai'i
[31]. Although it remains to be empirically demonstrated,
our evidence is consistent with FCA-like alleles of reduced
wild-type function permitting greater allocation of
resources to reproduction on younger, nutrient-rich
islands where benefits of extensive root systems are less
important. It is even possible that positive selection on
slightly deleterious alleles could occur if reproductive isolation via flowering time modulation were advantageous
in founder populations inhabiting pioneer habitats [32].
Altered FCA-like protein function from a structural
framework
We investigated the inferred slightly deleterious nature of
longer polyQ tracts by examining the hypothetical structure of FCA-like proteins. In addition to the conserved
WW protein-protein interaction domain, FCA-like proteins have two conserved RNA recognition (RRM)
domains [17]. Along with the FY factor that binds to the
WW domain, FCA is a component of a 3'-end RNA
processing complex [33]. Aside from its well-defined
domains, FCA-like proteins are unlike any other known
protein family. However, detailed homology analysis and
structural modeling based on multiple complete
sequences reveals important structural features (see Additional file 1).

In order to function in an autoregulatory RNA processing
complex, it is clear that simultaneous binding of RNA,
FCA and the FY protein is required for physiological effect
[24,33]. As such, the variable ca. 300 AA long intervening
sequence between the second RRM and WW must have a
well defined, rather rigid structure (Additional file 1). No
strong matches were found by threading programs for the
complete segment, or for parts of it, but various beta-folds
dominate among the weak matches. The first 100 residues, which differ between monocots and dicots, show
normal compositional variability and are likely to fold
into regular secondary and tertiary structure. Two potentially stable, pseudo-dimeric 38 AA segments (labeled 3
and 4 in Additional file 1) occur in this region. The following segment of ca. 200 residues is enriched in glutamines
and prolines, and poor on charged residues. Moreover,
glutamines and prolines occur scattered throughout the
entire length of this segment, spaced by 4–8 residues. Similar features are also observed after the WW domain. In
several regions, the number of Q residues varies (from 3
to 9) among otherwise similar sequences (Figure 1; see
also Additional file 1).
What could this rigid, Q-rich structure be like? One possibility is that a left-handed beta-helix would form. In these
large structures of least 200 residues, beta strands and

Five reproductive morphological traits show similar linear
correlations with FCA homolog average allele length per
Hawaiian mint individual. The x-axis is average allele length,
and the y axis represents measurements in millimeters. Dark
blue = nutlet size; green = corolla lower lip length, light blue
= corolla upper lip length, red = number of flowers per verticillaster, yellow = pedicel length. Regression lines, from top
to bottom at the y-intercept,: pedicel length, flowers per verticillaster, corolla upper lip length, corolla lower lip length,

that none of these morphological variables show significant
correlation with average allele lengths for the other two loci
shown in Figure 5.

turns alternate to form a macrohelix that can be 50 Å long.
For example, beta-helices are suggested to form in the
long polyQ tracts of human disease-causing proteins past
the critical value of Q37 [24]. We hypothesize a long beta
helix covering the latter half of the RRM-WW linker and
extending some 65 AA after the WW domain. The
glutamines would favor beta-strand formation, and the
prolines, the requisite beta-turns to form the tertiary helical structure [34]. The WW domain would fold separately
as a loop structure, as is seen, for example, in the beta helical structure of penicillin dextranase (Protein Data Bank
ID 1ogo.pdb). Similarly, the very C-terminal, non-repetitious 20 residues of FCA-like proteins should also arrange
into a normal irregular fold and participate in ABA binding [18]. It could well be that the N-terminal RRM
domains and the C-terminal WW domain come close to
each other in three-dimensions, since beta sheets (present
in the RRMs and beta helices) bind well to the sides of
other beta sheets [35].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/105

A structural/functional problem actively studied in relationship with Q-rich proteins is fibril formation, found in
several neurogenerative diseases [24,35]. The longer the Q
expansion, the more severe the effect [24]. In a beta-helix
type of structure, long Q-stretches in FCA-like proteins
could form an extra strand that would easily fit into the
general fold. As a result, mutual orientation of the loops
would change by about 120 degrees, and possible interactions between structural elements before and after the Qrepeat would be eliminated. In the mints, only Q-expansions up to 17 are observed, and whereas these would not
be long enough to nucleate new structures, they would be
sufficient to render the known functional domains of the
FCA protein more mobile [cf. [36]], lessening the formation of functionally productive 3 end-processing complexes. As such, polyQ expansions could retard FCA
homolog autoregulation and have deleterious physiological (and phenotypic) effects while not being long enough
to permanently hinder folding of the functional structure.

Conclusion
The Hawaiian mint FCA-like system suggests the possibility that polyQ variation, as readily measured over a relatively short geological time sequence, contributed to
morphological change and participated in incipient speciation. Paradoxically, these effects may have "taken advantage" of developmental pleiotropy by way of natural
selection on genetic variation causing slightly deleterious
protein function. This discovery supports suggestions that
repetitive AA motifs might provide a general mechanism
for driving morphological evolution [10], and that variation at such motifs might permit rapid tuning to environmental change [37-39]. Furthermore, our finding of
substantial polyQ variation in FCA-like proteins across
plants suggests the possibility that other species may modulate flowering time and simultaneously undergo morphological evolution via selection on polyQ repeat
polymorphism.
Of great importance, however, is that the central hypothesis of this study must survive functional testing. This
could be accomplished by heterologous or homologous
transformation experiments with fca null Arabidopsis
plants, the former by incorporating different mint alleles,
the latter by inserting engineered FCA constructs with
CAG repeats of increasing lengths. Furthermore, if the
FCA/FY interaction does indeed become less stable with
increasing polyglutamine length, then changes in alternative splicing of mint FCA-like RNA [22] might be detectable in vivo.

Methods
Database survey of FCA homologs
The organismic distribution of the polyQ tract was investigated by surveying databases for FCA homologs using

sequential TBLASTN [40] searches, moving outwards
from initial Stenogyne (EU005232), rice (AAW62371),
and Arabidopsis (AAW38964) searches. Query sequences
included the WW domain, some of the RRM-WW spacer,
and parts of the C-terminus. Using this methodology, the
sequences shown in Figure 1 and Additional file 1 were
recovered, along with many others, including potato
(Solanum), CV496389; tobacco (Nicotiana), EB428208;
cotton (Gossypium), CO075196; peach (Prunus),
DY654198; soybean (Glycine), BU083978; watermelon

DY398660; loblolly pine (Pinus), CO165492; white
spruce (Picea), DV987123; and moss (Physcomitrella),
BJ590264.
Plant material and DNA extraction
Plant materials were in most cases obtained from herbarium specimens. In some cases, fresh material, further
dried in silica gel, was obtained during field work.
Included in the study were a total of 44 Hawaiian endemic
mint taxa and 5 putative hybrids (N = 92). Also included
were a total of 44 Stachys species (N = 53) from throughout the geographic range of the genus. Taxon, voucher,
and collection locality information is provided in Additional file 2. Genomic DNA from individual accessions
was extracted either as described in [14] or using the
DNeasy Plant Mini kit following the manufacturer's
instructions (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California, USA).
SSR amplification and scoring
Simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were identified
using the free online tool SSR Primer [41] as described by
[16]. Using homologous genomic DNA from Stenogyne
rugosa, PCR amplifications were optimized by testing different PCR reagents and annealing temperatures. The following protocol proved successful: 10 μL reaction volume
using the AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA), 0.2 mmol/L of
a dNTP blend, 1 μmol/L of each primer, and 1 μL
genomic, unquantified DNA, with a PCR touch-down
protocol: 1) initial denaturation 95°C 10 min, 2) 10
cycles of 95°C 1 min, 60°C 1 min, decreasing annealing
temperature 1°C/cycle, 72°C 1 min 30 sec, 3) 35 cycles of
95°C 1 min, 50°C 1 min, 72°C 1 min 30 sec, and 4) a
final extension 72°C 10 min. Analysis of SSR variation
was accomplished using a fluorescently labeled forward
primer, size standard ROX500, and an ABI 3100 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Amplification profiles
were scored using the GeneMapper Software v3.7
(Applied Biosystems).

To confirm the presence of CAG repeats and to determine
the corresponding numbers of repeats to allele lengths,
selected accessions of Hawaiian mints were analyzed with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/105

direct sequencing. Two homozygous accessions (Stenogyne cranwelliae 1 and Phyllostegia hispida) were included,
permitting a precise determination. PCR products were
purified using 8 μL 10× diluted exoSAP-IT (USB Corporation) per reaction. Cycle sequencing, using the same primers as in the PCR reaction, was performed in 10 μL
reactions using 2 μL BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems), 10 pmol
primer, and 3 μL cleaned PCR product. Sequencing products were purified with ethanol precipitation and analyzed using an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). Forward and reverse sequences were edited
and aligned using Sequencher ver. 4.1.4 (GeneCodes, Ann
Arbor, Michigan, USA).
Analyses of SSR variation
Frequency distributions of alleles and statistical tests were
calculated using the software SPSS v. 13.0 (SPSS Inc.). Frequency distributions were calculated for all data together
and for subsamples from the four islands Hawai'i, Maui
Nui, O'ahu, and Kaua'i. Maui Nui represents a single landmass now separated into the islands Kaho'olawe, Lana'i,
Maui, and Moloka'i. Length differences among pooled
alleles for these four populations were investigated using
Kruskal-Wallis and one-way ANOVA tests. Since the Levene Test of Homogeneity of Variances was significant, the
post hoc Tamhane's T2 test with ANOVA was performed
(equal variances not assumed).
Curve fitting of SSR/morphological relationships
Morphological data were scored using information from
[15] or from our own observations of available herbarium
material when information was not recorded in this reference (P. kaalaensis, P. renovans, P. waimeae, and S. cranwelliae, the latter two taxa for nutlet size only).
Measurements from the following morphological variables were scored: nutlet size, length of corolla lower and
upper lips, number of flowers per verticillaster, corolla
tube length, corolla size (estimated as a multiple of
corolla (i) upper and (ii) lower lips, and (iii) tube
lengths), length of pedicels and calyces, and leaf area
(length × width). Hawaiian mint flowers are usually
arranged in small, compact, axillary cymes, forming verticillate arrangements at each node or sometimes racemose
inflorescences. The corollas are strongly zygomorphic and
bilabiate and the fruits usually consist of four nutlets. For
each morphological variable the relationship between
allele length means (independent variable) and average
values of the morphological variable (dependent variable) was investigated by linear, quadratic, and exponential
curve fitting in SPSS for the following different groups of
data points: all Hawaiian mint accessions, Phyllostegia
accessions only, Stenogyne accessions only, and accessions
from the four islands Hawai'i, Maui Nui, O'ahu, and

fits in almost all cases, only these are reported here. Following common practice, no adjustments for multiple
tests were made since (i) there are biological explanations
for the null hypotheses to be rejected, and (ii) the results
are meant to be exploratory, requiring further experimental confirmation.

FCA structural analysis
Several threading programs were used to search for structural elements in FCA-like proteins [42-44]. Alignments
were constructed using CLUSTALW [45], followed by
hand adjustments. CHARMM C30B1 [46] was used for
structural modeling of representative beta helices in the
Protein Data Bank.

The experimentally known RNA recognition (RRM) domains and the
WW domain are shown in boxes, with probable secondary structure
marked (arrows for beta strands, cylinders for alpha helices). The hypothesized beta helix between the second RRM and the WW domain is marked
with a thick green line under the alignment. Representative Q expansions
are marked with asterisks, and the one analyzed here is boxed. Other
boxes with numbers stand for likely beta domains. Segments 1a,b,c and
2a,b,c show weak mutual similarity, which is highlighted by the fact that
the Lolium perenne sequence aligns best as 1a+1b+2c, as shown. However depending on the sequence set used, Lolium FCA can also align as
1a+1b+1c. A similar pseudo-dimeric structure is likely to exist for boxed
domains 3 and 4. Sequences shown in the alignment: T. aestivum (Triticum), AAP84419 and AAP84418; L. perenne (Lolium), AAT72460;
O. sativa (Oryza), AAW62371; H. vulgare (Hordeum), AAF97846;
