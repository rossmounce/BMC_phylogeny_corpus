Abstract
Background: Fragaria belongs to the Rosaceae, an economically important family that includes a number of
important fruit producing genera such as Malus and Prunus. Using genomic sequences from 50 Fragaria fosmids, we
have examined the microsynteny between Fragaria and other plant models.
Results: In more than half of the strawberry fosmids, we found syntenic regions that are conserved in Populus, Vitis,
Medicago and/or Arabidopsis with Populus containing the greatest number of syntenic regions with Fragaria. The
longest syntenic region was between LG VIII of the poplar genome and the strawberry fosmid 72E18, where seven out
of twelve predicted genes were collinear. We also observed an unexpectedly high level of conserved synteny between
Fragaria (rosid I) and Vitis (basal rosid). One of the strawberry fosmids, 34E24, contained a cluster of R gene analogs
(RGAs) with NBS and LRR domains. We detected clusters of RGAs with high sequence similarity to those in 34E24 in all
the genomes compared. In the phylogenetic tree we have generated, all the NBS-LRR genes grouped together with
Arabidopsis CNL-A type NBS-LRR genes. The Fragaria RGA grouped together with those of Vitis and Populus in the
phylogenetic tree.
Conclusions: Our analysis shows considerable microsynteny between Fragaria and other plant genomes such as
Populus, Medicago, Vitis, and Arabidopsis to a lesser degree. We also detected a cluster of NBS-LRR type genes that are
conserved in all the genomes compared.
Background
Genetic mapping with common markers has indicated
significant synteny in many plant families, including
Rosaceae [1,2]. These studies have suggested that there is
a significant conserved synteny among closely related
plant genomes and the degree of synteny decreases with
evolutionary distance. Comparative DNA analyses, however, has shown that large segmental or whole genome
duplication (WGD) with subsequent gene loss can
obscure synteny among related species [3]. Even though
the placement of WGD is still controversial in the rosid
lineage, it appears that Vitis (grape), which is a basal
rosid, has undergone less WGD than Populus (rosid I)
and Arabidopsis (rosid II), and Arabidopsis has undergone numerous additional chromosomal rearrangements

[4-7]. We have previously reported a complex network of
microsyntenic regions between Prunus and Arabidopsis
using map-anchored Prunus sequences and Prunus BAC
sequences [8,9]. The level of microsynteny between Prunus and Populus, however, was considerably high, reflecting the closer evolutionary distance between Populus and
Prunus (Figure 1) and the apparent stability of the Populus genome compared to Arabidopsis [4].
The NBS-LRR family is the largest class of Resistance
genes (R gene). In addition to the genetically cloned R
gene loci, a large number of R gene analogs (RGAs) have
been isolated from various plant species [10]. In grass,
interspecific analyses have shown that the R genes are frequently found in non-syntenic positions unlike other
genes, suggesting rapid reorganization of R genes [11]. In
Solanaceae, however, conserved syntenic R genes have
been described [12].
In this report, we show the microsynteny between Fragaria fosmid sequences [13,14] and other model genomes

A region in LG VIII of the poplar genome and the
strawberry fosmid 72E18 had a syntenic block with the
most gene pairs - 7 out of 12 genes in the fosmid were collinear. Since the syntenic region includes the first and last
predicted genes of 72E18, the syntenic block can be
potentially larger. 72E18 had another syntenic region in
LG X of poplar and in all other genomes compared (Figure 2).

Results and Discussion
Microsynteny between F. vesca and other plant model
genomes

To study the degree of synteny conservation between the
strawberry and other sequenced plant model organisms,
we used the 50 strawberry fosmid sequences [13,14]
downloaded from NCBI. More than half (26 out of 50) of
the strawberry fosmids contained microsyntenic regions
in Populus, Vitis, Medicago and/or Arabidopsis (Table 1).
Four syntenic regions were conserved in all five genomes
and four were conserved in four genomes (Table 1).
Twelve strawberry fosmids detected multiple syntenic
regions in more than one chromosome of the same species, supporting the history of genome duplication events
in these model species (Table 1). The microsyntenic
regions between the strawberry fosmids and the model
genomes contained three to seven gene pairs and covered
7 to 142 kb in model genomes and 7 to 35 kb in strawberry fosmids (Table 2). The number of conserved syntenic regions in Vitis was less than in Populus but more
than in Medicago or Arabidopsis (Table 2). The Medicago
genome is partially sequenced, so the number of
microsyntenic regions may increase when the whole
genome sequence data is used in the analysis. However,
the degree of synteny between Vitis and strawberry was
unexpectedly high considering Vitaceae is a basal rosid,
the earliest diverging lineage of the rosids. The rate of
gene loss after large genome duplication can vary
depending on the species, and different rates of genome
evolution may have been applied in these species after the
ancient genome duplication. It could also be partly
explained by the studies that suggest that Vitis has undergone less WGD than Populus and Arabidopsis [5-7].

One of the fosmids, 34E24, had four RGAs and our synteny analysis found similar clusters in all the genomes
compared (Figure 3). Multiple RGAs in the strawberry
fosmid matched to multiple RGAs in the clusters of other
genomes. Three genes in 34E24 are not related to R
genes, and none of these genes had matches in the R gene
cluster-containing regions of other compared genomes.
34E24_7, the longest predicted RGA in the strawberry
fosmid 34E24, had reciprocal top matches in the syntenic
region of Populus, Medicago, and Arabidopsis (Figure 3).
34E24_7 and its reciprocal top matches in Populus, Medicago, and Arabidopsis. 34E24_7 was the best match of the
Vitis gene GSVIVP00003147001, and the Vitis gene was
the second best match of 34E24_7. The observation that
the homologous regions contained the reciprocal best
hits and that they showed high percent identities suggest
that these are putative orthologous regions. Since only
RGAs in the genomic regions matched, however, it is possible these RGA clusters reside in non-syntenic positions.
InterProScan analysis showed that most of the genes in
the clusters have the characteristic domains of NBS-LRR
proteins [15] (Table 3). The NBS domain of NBS-LRR
proteins is also called NB-ARC since it is composed of
two contiguous sub-domains, NB and ARC [16]. The NB
sub-domain contains kinase 1a (P-loop), RNBS-A, and
other kinase motifs that are common to a variety of other
nucleotide binding proteins. ARC sub-domain contains
GLPL motif [16]. Studies have shown that there are two
distinct groups of NBS-LRR genes, with or without the
N-terminal Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology
region [12,17]. Since most of the NBS-LRR genes without
the TIR domain have a coiled-coil (CC) motif in the Nterminal region [12], the two groups have been called
TNL (TIR-NBS_LRR) and CNL (CC-NBS-TIR) [13].
None of the genes in the Fragaria/other genomes conserved cluster had a TIR domain, suggesting that they
belong to the CNL group.
34E24_7 has two NB-ARC and three LRR domains.
34E24_7 also has two RPW8 domains in addition to these
typical domains of NBS-LRR genes, one at the N-terminal of each NB-ARC domain. The Arabidopsis RPW8
gene, a representative of the most recently characterized
class of R genes, is a small, probable membrane protein
with no other homology to known proteins and it confers
broad-spectrum mildew resistance [18,19]. We detected

Bolded are the syntenic regions that are conserved in all five genomes.
Italicized are the syntenic regions that are conserved in four of the five genomes

genes that have a similar structure to 34E24_7, containing
NB-ARC and LRR domains in addition to RPW8
domains, in all the genomes compared: two Arabidopsis
genes, AT5G66900 and AT5G66910, one Medicago gene,
CU137666_10, one grape gene, GSVIVP00003147001,
and one Populus gene, proteinId_563015. This Medicago
gene has recently been reported as one of the NB-ARC
genes with atypical domain structure due to the fused
RPW8 domain [20]. We also detected two grape genes
with both NB-ARC and RPW8 domains but without LRR
domains. The majority of the R genes in the different species clusters had NB-ARC and LRR domains without
RPW8, which is characteristic of the largest class of R
genes.
The rest of the three RGAs in the fosmid 34E24 do not
contain NB-ARC domains even though they matched to

NB-ARC genes in other genomes (Table 3). 34E24_3 contains the RPW8 domain, 34E24_5 contains a disease
resistance protein signature detected by the PRINTS
database, and 34E24_4 contains a LRR domain. Close
examination of these genes, however, revealed that they
did contain some of the motifs that are characteristic of
the NB-ARC domain. Both 34E24_3 and 34E24_5 contained a P-loop, and 34E24_5 contained RNBS-A and a
kinase as well. The examination also revealed that the
order of the domains in these three clustered genes,
34E24_3, 34E24_4 and 34E24_5, is very similar to that of
34E24_7, suggesting a potential gene duplication event
followed by gene rearrangements to produce three
smaller genes (Figure 4). The observation that four strawberry RGAs match to the similar sets of genes in other
genomes (Figure 3), in spite of their different domain

components, also suggest that these genes share common
evolutionary history.
The Arabidopsis and Populus RGA clusters also contained genes with LRR or fragmented NBS domain without the intact NB-ARC: proteinId_76154 and
AT5G66630 with fragmented NBS, proteinId_76154 with
LRR and RPW8 domains, and AT5G66630 with a RPW8
domain. A previous study [15] has shown that
AT5G66630 contains a zinc-finger domain and clusters

with other zinc-finger domain containing genes, but it is
fused with the NBS-like domain. The study also reports
that the NB-ARC like domain of AT5G66630 is related
most closely to a nearby cluster of NBS genes, one of
which (AT5G66890) is lacking the NBS region, suggesting
a translocation of this domain [15]. In our analysis, the
RGA cluster in Fragaria matched to both the AT5G66630
and the nearby cluster of R genes including AT5G66890
(Figure 3).

One interesting observation was the occurrence of the
LRR-only genes in the NBS-LRR gene clusters of several
plant genomes. LRR domains are found in numerous proteins with various functions and are usually involved in
protein-protein interaction [21] and they are considered
to be responsible for R specificity [18]. Two classes of R
genes, the tomato Cf-X genes [22] and the rice Xa21 [23],
encode transmembrane proteins with extracellular LRRs.
The frequent existence of the NBS fragments without
LRR domains prompted a suggestion that they may
encode adaptor molecules that are important in signaling
[18]. Similarly, the existence of the LRR-only genes may
suggest their functional importance in the disease-resistance mechanism involving NBS-LRR R genes.
Phylogeny analysis of the NBS-LRR genes in the clusters

To determine which NBS-LRR subgroup the genes we
detected belong to, we performed phylogeny analysis on
the genes that contain both NBS and LRR domains (Figure 5). In this analysis, we included the representatives of

sub-groups of NBS-LRR genes [13] and some of the previously reported RGAs from Prunus genomic DNA [10].
All the CNL genes were grouped together separately from
the TNL genes, and all the genes that we detected in our
analysis grouped with other known CNL genes (Figure 5).
The CNL branch was further divided by the subgroups,
CNL-A, CNL-B, CNL-C and CNL-D, identified by a previous study [15]. All the NBS-LRR genes in the clusters
that have been identified in our study belong to the CNLA branch (Figure 5). In the CNL-A branch, genes from
the same or related species, Medicago, Arabidopsis, Vitis,
and Populus, grouped together (Figure 5). Arabidopsis
genes in the CNL-A branch formed a separate basal
group, and the rest was further divided into two groups,
one with the Medicago genes and another with the rest
(Figure 5). The group contained RGAs from Fragaria,
Populus and Vitis (Figure 5). The observation that RGAs
from Vitis group together with RGAs from Fragaria and
Populus is in accordance with the unexpectedly high syn-

the low level of synteny between Fragaria and Arabidopsis suggest that the stability of genomes, in addition to the
evolutionary distance, is important in synteny conservation. We also detected a cluster of NBS-LRR type R genes
in all rosids analyzed in this study. The clusters included
R genes with unusual domain structure such as NBS only,
LRR only and NBS-LRR genes with RPW8. The phylogeny analyses showed that the NBS-LRR genes belong to

The 50 Fragaria vesca fosmid sequences [13,14], were
downloaded from NCBI. Results of detailed analysis of
the fosmids, including fosmid construction, sequencing,
and identification of genetic elements are summarized in
two publications [13,14]. We performed gene predictions
using fgenesh and the Medicago (rosid I) trained gene set
[Additional file 1], since the predicted gene sets [13,14]
were not available at the time of analysis. The protein
data of Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis, and Medicago were
downloaded from the web sites of TAIR [24], JGI [25],
Genoscope [26], and http://www.medicago.org, respectively.
The predicted protein sequences of the Fragaria fosmids were compared with the Medicago, Populus, Arabidopsis, and Vitis proteins by pairwise comparison using
the BLASTP program. The top ten matches with an E
value less than 1e -10 were used for further analysis. Syntenic groups with at least three gene pairs were selected
when the distance between the two adjacent matches
were less than 200 kb, using DAGchainer [27], as
described before [9].

using TreeView [32]. The tree is divided into two major groups, TNL and CNL. All the homologs detected from this study group together with CNL-A,
a subgroup of CNL. The Arabidopsis genes that belong to TNL (A through H) and CNL (B through D) are used as controls. The Prunus genes C5, Cd134,

Detection of Domains and Phylogeny Analysis of NBS
genes

The clusters of genes that matched to the cluster of genes
in the Fragaria fosmid 34E24 were analyzed for known
domains using InterProScan at the InterPro Database.
The NBS-LRR proteins sequences were aligned using
CLUSTAL W [28] with default parameters for slow/accurate option, available at Kyoto University Bioinformatics
Center [29] and phylogenetic trees were generated using

Neighbor Joining method. The NJ tree was bootstrapped
(1000). The Arabidopsis sequences used as controls for
various subtypes of TNL and CNL [15] and the Prunus
RGAs [10] were downloaded from NCBI.
