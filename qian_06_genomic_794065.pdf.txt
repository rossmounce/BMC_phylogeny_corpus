Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA (Methicillin Resistant S. aureus), is an acquired
pathogen and the primary cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. In S. aureus, teichoic acid is
an essential component of the cell wall, and its biosynthesis is not yet well characterized. Studies
in Bacillus subtilis have discovered two different pathways of teichoic acid biosynthesis, in two strains
W23 and 168 respectively, namely teichoic acid ribitol (tar) and teichoic acid glycerol (tag). The
genes involved in these two pathways are also characterized, tarA, tarB, tarD, tarI, tarJ, tarK, tarL for
the tar pathway, and tagA, tagB, tagD, tagE, tagF for the tag pathway. With the genome sequences
of several MRSA strains: Mu50, MW2, N315, MRSA252, COL as well as methicillin susceptible
strain MSSA476 available, a comparative genomic analysis was performed to characterize teichoic
acid biosynthesis in these S. aureus strains.
Results: We identified all S. aureus tar and tag gene orthologs in the selected S. aureus strains which
would contribute to teichoic acids sythesis.Based on our identification of genes orthologous to tarI,
tarJ, tarL, which are specific to tar pathway in B. subtilis W23, we also concluded that tar is the major
teichoic acid biogenesis pathway in S. aureus. Further analyses indicated that the S. aureus tar genes,
different from the divergon organization in B. subtilis, are organized into several clusters in cis. Most
interesting, compared with genes in B. subtilis tar pathway, the S. aureus tar specific genes (tarI,J,L)
are duplicated in all six S. aureus genomes.
Conclusion: In the S. aureus strains we analyzed, tar (teichoic acid ribitol) is the main teichoic acid
biogenesis pathway. The tar genes are organized into several genomic groups in cis and the genes
specific to tar (relative to tag): tarI, tarJ, tarL are duplicated. The genomic organization of the S.
aureus tar pathway suggests their regulations are different when compared to B. subtilis tar or tag
pathway, which are grouped in two operons in a divergon structure.

Background
Staphylococcus. Aureus (S. aureus) is a Gram-positive bacterium, which causes a variety of suppurative infections and
toxinoses in humans. The death rate associated with S.
aureus infection is still high even with antimicrobial drug
treatments due to the development of antibiotic resistance
in Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)
strains. Current developments in antimicrobial therapeutics show little efficacy in treating S. aureus and this bacterium remains a major human health threat. S. aureus, and
in particular its cell wall, remain a major target of glycopeptide antibiotics and focus of bacteriology research.
Teichoic acids, polymers of alternating phosphate and
alditol groups, in addition to peptidoglycan are an essential component of bacterial cell walls. Teichoic acid biosynthesis in S. aureus has not been well characterized. B.
subtilis and S. aureus are both phylogenetically classified
into Bacillus/Staphylococcus group. Unlike that in S. aureus,
the teichoic acid biogenesis in B. subtilis is well understood[1,2]. There are two major types of cell wall teichoic
acid in B. subtilis, poly(glycerol phosphate) [poly(GroP)]
in strain 168 [2] and poly(ribitol phosphate)
[poly(RboP)] in strain W23 [3]. In strain 168, the biosynthesis of teichoic acid poly(GroP) involves genes tagA,
tagB, tagD, tagE, and tagF. These tag genes are organized in
a divergon of two divergently transcribed operons, tagAB
and tagDEF[4,5]. In W23, the biosynthesis of teichoic
acids poly(RboP) involves genes tarA, tarB, tarD, tarF, tarI,
tarJ, tarK and tarL. The tar genes, similar to the tag genes,
are also organized in a divergon, tagAB-tagDEF [2]. The
biogenesis of essential wall teichoic acid in B. subtilis differs in these two strains, yet still shares similar enzymatic
steps. Functions of tagB, tagD, tagF were identified biochemically [1,6]. Based on high sequence similarity, tarA,

tarB, tarD, and tarF are believed to perform similar enzymatic reactions as tagA, tagB, tagD, and tagF do respectively [2], while tarI, tarJ, tarK and tarL carry functions
specific to poly(RboP) teichoic acid biosynthesis [2].
It has been reported that S. aureus H contains ribitol in its
cell wall as does B. subtilis W23 [7,8]. It has also been
shown that a TarD like enzyme exists in S. aureus with catalytic characteristics different from B. subtilis TagD [9].
These studies suggest poly(RboP) could be one of the cell
wall teichoic acids in some S. aureus strains, yet this has
not been unequivocally demonstrated.
Recently the genomes of MRSA strains Mu50, MW2,
N315, MRSA252, and COL as well as methicillin susceptible strain MSSA476 have been sequenced [9-12]. The
available sequence information enables us to take a comparative genomics approach to study the genomic requirements of wall teichoic acid in S. aureus by comparing
them to the genes involved in B. subtilis teichoic acid synthesis.
We took all B. subtilis tar and tag genes, computationally
to identify all orthologous genes supposedly involved in
wall teichoic acid biogenesis in the S. aureus strains Mu50,
MW2, N315, MRSA252, MSSA476 and COL. Our results
suggest that poly(RboP), rather than poly(GroP), is the
major teichoic acid in these strains. We also report the
genomic organization of the teichoic acid biogenesis
genes, which is different from the divergon organization
in B. subtilis W23 and 168.

Results
Identify genes involved in wall teichoic acid synthesis in S.
aureus through comparative genomics analysis
In order to identify the genes concerned with wall teichoic
acids synthesis in S. aureus, strains Mu50, MW2, N315,
MRSA252, MSSA476 and COL, amino acid sequences of
all tar genes in B. subtilis W23 strain and tag genes in B.
subtilis 168 strain from GenBank were BLASTed against
the Refseq ORFs of Mu50, MW2, N315, MRSA252,
MSSA476 and COL. Significant hits were identified (data
not shown), and further subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The analysis led to the identification of the corresponding tar or tag orthologs in the S. aureus strains we
examined. "Ortholog" here is technically defined as those
with the best phylogenetic similarity. By deleting branches
of less homologous hits, the trees in Figure 1 were generated, indicating the orthologous tar or tag genes in those
S. aureus strains. tarB, tarF, tarL, tarK from B. subtilis W23
and tagB, tagF from B. subtilis 168 share common BLAST
hits in these S. aureus strains. We grouped these genes as
well as their BLAST hits together to perform the phylogenetic analysis and built an integral tree (Figure 1e) to
show their respective orthologous relationship.

Interestingly, these S. aureus orthologs, identified by phylogenetic analysis, shown in Figure 1, are actually the best
BLAST hits (not shown). (We subsequently performed a
"reverse BLAST hit" analysis on the identified S. aureus
ORFs.) We took the S. aureus ORFs (the best BLAST hits)
and BLASTed them back against B. subtilis strain 168
ORFs. Their corresponding tag genes were also identified
as the best BLAST hits (not shown). The reverse BLAST was
not performed for W23 strain since its genome sequence
is not currently available. The reverse best BLAST hit analysis was in agreement with phylogenetic clustering in
identifying the orthologous genes involved in wall teichoic acid synthesis in examined S. aureus strains (Figure
1). The orthologous relationship is also summarized in
Table 1. We further performed dot-blot analysis, which
also support the identified corresponding orthologous
relationships (Figure 2a, 2b).
S. aureus contains tarF instead of tagF
The protein alignment of S. aureus tagF/tarF orthologs
with B. subtilis TagF and TarF (Figure 3b) shows that tagF/
tarF orthologs in these S. aureus strains are fully aligned
with the W23 TarF in length, and also like W23 TarF, are
about only half the size of 168 TagF. And only the C-terminal part of the larger TagF is significantly homologous
to TarF[2].

In B. subtilis, despite sharing 60% identity, the size difference between TarF and TagF implies a functional difference. TagF and TarF both use CDP-glycerol as a substrate
but do not carry out identical functions. In strain W23,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/74

TarF is likely to be responsible for the addition of the second glycerol-phosphate which completes the linkage unit
process. While in 168, TagF polymerizes the complete
glycerol-phosphate chain onto the first residue [6], which
requires a bigger protein. Thus the size difference correlates with their functional difference between TagF and
TarF. The size difference between TagF and TarF may also
be used to differentiate tar or tag pathway in teichoic acid
synthesis [5].
In the analyzed S. aureus strains, the size of tagF/tarF
orthologs suggests the existence of TarF like function
rather than TagF like function, and additional enzymes
are required to complete teichoic acid synthesis[2].
S. aureus utilize tar pathway instead of tag pathway for
teichoic acid biosynthesis
In B. subtilis strain W23, tarI, tarJ. tarK and tarL are specific
to tar pathway, which are responsible for the synthesis of
RboP and the addition of poly(RboP) to the linkage unit
[2] and are absent in strain 168's tag pathway. The identification of tarI, tarJ and tarL orthologs (Figure 1 and Table
1) and the tarF kind of function (instead of that of tagF)
strongly suggest that the tar rather than the tag pathway is
employed for cell wall teichoic acid synthesis in analyzed
S. aureus strains. In the rest of the paper, these S. aureus
wall teichoic acid synthesis genes are all referred as tar
genes (Tar prefix will be used to refer to their protein products).

There are two copies for each tar J, tarI and tarL gene in
those S. aureus strains (Figure 1, Table 1 and Figure 2).
Interestingly, the tarK ortholog is missing from the analyzed S. aureus strains. In W23, tarK and tarL are identified
to catalyze a similar function, but tarL could take a bigger
substrate enzymatically (poly(Rbop)) [6]. Thus the
absence of tarK ortholog in S. aureus could either mean it
is functionally replaced by one of the two tarL or be compensated for by the extra copy of tarL.
Identifying the correct full length tarB in S. aureus Mu50
and N315
According to multiple sequence alignment analysis and
BLAST analysis of B. subtilis TarB/TagB (protein) with the
corresponding S. aureus orthologs, the TarB ORFs in
Mu50 and N315 were found to be notably shorter than B.
subtilis TarB/TagB. They were also shown to lack half of the
amino acid residues from the N-terminal of B.subtilis
TarB/TagB (Figure 3a). One would expect that the translation start site would be further upstream in both strains.
The ORF prediction was thus rerun on this genomic
region (see methods), and the correct tarB/tagB in Mu50
and N315 were identified (see Additional file 1). The correct tarB in N315 is from 687949 to 689052, producing an
ORF of 367 amino acids; the correct tarB In Mu50 is

located between 712200 and 713303, also encoding an
ORF of 367 amino acids. Both two new TarB ORFs were
subsequently confirmed by a TBLASTN analysis against
these two genomes with B. subtilis TarB as query. The new
TarB ORFs in Mu50 and N315 strains and their alignment
with the original incorrectly predicted ones are shown in
Figure 3a.
Genomic organization of tar genes and duplication of tarI,
tarJ and tarL in S. aureus strains
In B. subtilis, the wall teichoic acid synthesis genes are
organized into a divergon, tarABIJKL-tarDF in W23 and
tagAB-tagDEF in 168 (Figure 4, Additional file 4). However, in S. aureus, the tar genes seem are rather organized
by genomic distance as tarIJL-tarF-tarIJL-tarA-tarB-tarD in
cis orientation (Figure 4, see Additional file 4). This

genomic organization is conserved in all six analyzed S.
aureus strains.
As shown above, BLASTP and phylogenetic analysis identify two copies of tarI, tarJ and tarL in each analyzed S.
aureus strain, which are clustered into two tarIJL regions
with the same gene order. Alignment and dot blot analysis
of these two tarIJL regions in each S. aureus strain confirm
this gene duplication (Figure 5, N315 is shown. The others with similar results are not shown). The relevant
genomic sequences of tarIJL regions including the intergenic regions among I, J, K genes and the upstream 275 bp
were used as an input for Dotmatcher program to perform
dot-blot analysis of the two tarIJL regions (see Materials
and Methods). We also ran the NCBI BLAST2seq program
to align the two regions (not shown). These analyses fur-

duplication should not be a remote event. And part of tarL region is less conserved, which indicate that two tarL copies could
have different functions. This phenomenon can be used to explain why there is no homologs of tarK in these S. aureus strains.
Other S. aureus strains give similar results and are not shown here.

ther confirmed the homology between those two tarIJL
regions, which strongly suggests the whole tarIJL region is
duplicated. The high homology indicates the duplication

should not be an evolutionary (or biologically) distal
event. Why and how this gene duplication occurred is still
a question that remains to be answered.

The dot blot analysis also demonstrated that a small section of the C-terminal of tarJ is not very conserved in the

yet clear. Similarly, the N-terminal of tarL (almost half the
size of tarL) is neither homologous between the two tarL
genes. It implies that one of the tarL is very likely to be the
missing tarK.

Discussion
To understand the biosynthesis of cell wall teichoic acid in
S. aureus strains Mu50, MW2, N315, MRSA252, MSSA476
and COL, we took a bioinformatics approach to perform
a comparative genomics analysis., We used the B. subtilis
teichoic acid synthesis pathway as the base for comparison and identified all the genes essential to teichoic acid
synthesis in these six S. aureus strains. Besides tarA/tagA,
tarB/tagB, and tarD/tagD like genes, we identified tarF
rather than tagF like gene and tar specific genes tarI, tarJ
and tarL. The latter three ones are duplicated in these S.
aureus strains.
In B. subtilis, tarA, tarB, tarD and tarF in W23 are the most
similar to their counterparts in strain 168: tagA, tagB, tagD
and tagF [6], whose functions in wall techoic acid synthesis are well understood [1,2]. Since tarF does not carry out
a polymerization function as tagF does, W23 tar pathways
requires tarI, tarJ, tarK and tarL to add poly(RboP) to the
linkage unit to complete teichoic acid synthesis [2]. The
identification of tarF like function and tarI, tarJ, tarL like
genes strongly support the fact that the analyzed S. aureus
strains use a tar like pathway and poly(RboP) is their
major cell wall teichoic acids. This conclusion is consistent with the observations that a TarD rather than TagD

like catalytic mechanism presentin S. aureus [13] and the
identification of ribitol teichioc acid in the cell wall of S.
aureus H [7,8].
The tarI, tarJ and tarL in the six analyzed S. aureus strains
are duplicated. Compared to the W23 tar pathway, tarK is
absent in the six S. aureus strains. Based on the proposed
function of tarK and tarL [2], we suggest that tarK is functionally redundant with one of the tarL in S. aureus or
compensated by the duplication of tarL. Figure 6 schematically describes the tar pathway in the analyzed S. aureus
strains. Compared to the proposed tar pathway in B. subtilis W23 (Figure 6, top panel) [1], the TarK in W23 could
be replaced by one of the S. aureus TarL, or the TarK and
TarL steps in W23 are actually merged as one TarL step in
S. aureus (Figure 6, bottom blocks). Table 2 lists the putative enzymatic functions for S. aureus tar genes based on
the SWISSPROT annotation of B. subtilis W23 tar genes. In
this report, we also identified the correct ORFs for tarB in
S. aureus strains N315 and Mu50, which are actually
longer than the original ORFs in GenBank.
The genomic organizations of tar genes in S. aureus are
quite different from B. subtilis. They are organized into
several clusters in cis rather than the divergon in B. subtilis,
and may be subjected to different regulatory mechanisms.

Conclusion
As we analyzed, tar (teichoic acid ribitol) is the main teichoic acid biogenesis pathway in the S. aureus strains.
And, the tar genes are organized into several genomic
groups in cis and the genes specific to tar (relative to tag):
tarI, tarJ, tarL are duplicated. The genomic organization of

the S. aureus tar pathway suggests their regulations are different when compared to B. subtilis tar or tag pathway,
which are grouped in two operons in a divergon structure.

Methods
Data sources
Six bacteria strains are included in this analysis: Staphylococcus aureus Mu50, MW2, N315, MRSA252, MSSA476,

COL and Bacillus subtilis 168. Their respective Refseq proteomes are downloaded from NCBI microbial genomes
website [15]. The complete geonome sequence of Bacillus
subtilis W23 is not available yet. The Tar proteins in W23
(A, B, D, F, I, J, K, L) are also downloaded from NCBI
microbial genomes website [15].
BLASTP search
The eight Tar proteins and five Tag proteins (A, B, D, E, F)
were used as queries to BLASTP against the proteomes
(ORFs) of S. aureus Mu50, MW2, N315, MRSA252,
MSSA476 and COL. For each querying protein, using E
value cut off of 1e-10, we collected all the significant hits.

To define the identified possible Tar/Tag homoglous proteins in six S. aureus strains, we also took the above identified S. aureus proteins (ORFs) to BLAST back against
proteome of B. subtilis168. Mutual best BLAST hit is
another evidence of the orthologous relationship.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
building
The above selected BLAST hits from the combined dataset
plus the relevant Tar protein are taken to do ClustalW
alignment. The multiple sequence alignment result is further taken as input to do phylogenetic analysis.

Mega3 package is used for phylogenetic analysis and tree
building. First the ClustalW produced .aln files were transformed into Mega readable .meg files, followed by performing neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis taking
.meg files as inputs. The default Mega parameters were
used when making NJ trees and performing bootstrap test
(bootstrap replication time at 500).
Since Tar/TagB, Tar/TagF, TarL, and TarK share certain significant BLAST hits, we put them and their BLAST hits
together to do ClustalW alignment and Mega analysis.
MUMmer alignment and dot plot analysis
MUMmer package V3.0 was downloaded from TIGR ftp
sites [16], which was used to align between the B. subtilis
168 genome and each genome of the six S. aureus strains.
Promer program was selected for its relatively high sensitivity. Promer generates amino acid alignments between
two DNA input files which contain multiple sequences in
FASTA format. Mummerplot was used to produce the dotblot of the MUMmer alignments (Figure 2).
Identification of full length tarB in S. aureus Mu50 and
N315
The TarB orthologs identified from S. aureus Mu50 and
N315 Refseq proteomes are remarkably shorter than TarB
in B. subtilis W23, MRSA252, MSSA476 and COL, missing
the N-terminal part and only about half the size of W23

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/74

TarB. We applied NCBI's ORF finder program [14] to analyze the TarB regions of N315 and Mu50. Two extended
ORFs were identified which were similar to W23 TarB in
length. Alignment analysis confirmed they are TarB
orthologs in these two S. aureus strains (Figure 3).
The ORF in N315 for TarB locates in the genome from
687949 to 689052, and ORF in Mu50 for TarB from
712200 to 713303.
The genomic organization of tar genes
The genomic localization information of Tar and Tag
genes in B. subtilis 168, W23 and S. aureus strains Mu50,
MW2, N315, MRSA252, MSSA476, COL were retrieved
from NCBI microbial genomes website [15]. Genomic
organization maps of the five bacteria were then made
(Figure 4, Additional file 4).
Analysis of tarIJL duplication in S. aureus strains
BLASTP and phylogenetic analysis identified two copies of
TarI, J and L in S. aureus Mu50, N315, MW2, MRSA252,
MSSA476 and COL. From genomic analysis, TarI, TarJ and
TarL in the analyzed S. aureus strains, are clustered into
two tarIJL regions. To confirm that it is caused by gene
duplication, we further performed alignment and dot-blot
analysis of those two tarIJL regions in each of the S. aureus
strains. [14]

We first cut out the relevant genomic sequences of tarIJL
regions, including the intergenic regions among I, J, K
genes and upstream 275 bp. Then we used dotmatcher
program from EMBOSS package[17] to perform dot-blot
analysis of the two tarIJL regions (Figure 5). We also ran
NCBI bl2seq program to align the two regions (not
shown).

Authors' contributions
ZQ, YY and YZ did most of the analysis. LL helped with
organizing the data. YJ identified the miss annotation of
S. aureus tar genes in GenBank and proposed the analysis.
YL and YJ supervised the analysis and interpreted the
results. ZQ, LL and YJ read and approved the final manuscript.

full size genomic organization image. The top line of this figure is the
divergon organization of tar and tag in B. subtilis W23 and 168 as a reference. The following six lines represented in arrows are graphic demonstration of genomic organization of the six S. aureus strains. Arrows in
different colours represent different genes as illustrated by the colour table
at the bottom. The length of each arrow is defined accurately by the scale,
demonstrating the exact amino acid length of each gene. Figures below the
arrows denote the GI numbers of corresponding gene. Figures between the
arrows denote gap sizes in nucleotide unit between adjacent genes. Noting
that, the black dots between some arrows denote the distances of corresponding genes, which are too long to illustrate by the normal scale.
BLAST hits are also shown for each gene below. All six S. aureus strains
share a similar genomic organization, which is quite different from their
B. subtilis W23 and 168 counterparts.
