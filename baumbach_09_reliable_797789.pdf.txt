Abstract
Background: Transcriptional regulation of gene activity is essential for any living organism.
Transcription factors therefore recognize specific binding sites within the DNA to regulate the
expression of particular target genes. The genome-scale reconstruction of the emerging regulatory
networks is important for biotechnology and human medicine but cost-intensive, time-consuming,
and impossible to perform for any species separately. By using bioinformatics methods one can
partially transfer networks from well-studied model organisms to closely related species. However,
the prediction quality is limited by the low level of evolutionary conservation of the transcription
factor binding sites, even within organisms of the same genus.
Results: Here we present an integrated bioinformatics workflow that assures the reliability of
transferred gene regulatory networks. Our approach combines three methods that can be applied
on a large-scale: re-assessment of annotated binding sites, subsequent binding site prediction, and
homology detection. A gene regulatory interaction is considered to be conserved if (1) the
transcription factor, (2) the adjusted binding site, and (3) the target gene are conserved. The power
of the approach is demonstrated by transferring gene regulations from the model organism
Corynebacterium glutamicum to the human pathogens C. diphtheriae, C. jeikeium, and the
biotechnologically relevant C. efficiens. For these three organisms we identified reliable
transcriptional regulations for ~40% of the common transcription factors, compared to ~5% for
which knowledge was available before.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that trustworthy genome-scale transfer of gene regulatory
networks between organisms is feasible in general but still limited by the level of evolutionary
conservation.

Background
In the post genome era we observe a continuously growing, vast amount of sequenced organisms spread over all
domains of life. Besides the identification and annotation

of functional sites within the emerging nucleic acid
sequences, an important task in molecular genetics, biotechnology, and human medicine is to unravel the regulation of these sites. DNA-binding transcription factors

(TFs) are the most important components of the cell's regulatory machinery [1]. They recognize specific operator
sequences close-by the promoter regions of the controlled
target genes, referred to as transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs), and thereby influence the amount of produced proteins. Although inevitable for the understanding of the cell's handling of changing environmental
conditions, the wet-lab reconstruction of the resulting
transcriptional regulatory networks is cost-intensive, timeconsuming, and impossible to perform for any species
separately [2,3]. Even for prokaryotic model organisms,
such as Escherichia coli or Corynebacterium glutamicum the
monumental task of deciphering transcriptional regulatory networks for whole species is far from being complete. The current knowledge is brought together and
stored in reference databases, such as RegulonDB [4] and
CoryneRegNet [5]; see [6] for a more detailed analysis of
such platforms.
The gathered information about substantial parts of the
transcriptional regulatory apparatus is used to study conserved network structures, sensing mechanisms, and to
uncover hidden architectures behind gene regulatory networks [7,8]. In addition, specialized approaches, based on
the evolutionary conservation of the responsible transcription factors and the controlled target genes, are used
to transfer knowledge on gene regulatory networks
between different organisms but aim to provide more
general, qualitative conclusions (trends) across many species [9]. The main problem, however, is the neglect of the
fact that orthologous regulators and target genes not necessarily are involved in conserved regulations. Another
complicacy is the dependency on reliable homology
detections. Other approaches utilize annotated transcription factor binding sites to compute mathematical models
for further TFBS predictions; where the by far most widely
used model for TFBSs are position weight matrices
(PWMs) [10]. Here, the major intricacy lies in the comparatively low level of TFBS conservation between different
organisms [11], even for essential factors such as the bacterial SOS response and DNA damage regulator LexA [12].
Hence, the consideration of PWM-based predictions apart
from further evidence is not very meaningful. Moreover,
there is a hidden problem with PWM calculations: The
determination of the position to which a transcription factor binds is difficult and time-consuming. It is normally
performed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays,
DNAse footprinting, ChIP-to-chip assays, or mutations of
putative TFBSs [13-15]. With all of these methods a precise identification that is accurate to one base pair is problematic. Furthermore, since TFs bind the double-stranded
DNA it is a matter of interpretation which strand of the
DNA sequence is annotated and stored in the database.
This causes a practical problem when a motif from either

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/8

strand based on approximate knowledge of its position is
used for PWM construction.

Methods
In the past years, we extensively studied the transcriptional regulatory repertoire of the model organism C.
glutamicum and other corynebacteria important in human
medicine and biotechnology. We gathered all publicly
available data, combined it with own wet-lab findings and
developed the reference database and analysis platform
CoryneRegNet [5,11,12,16]. Here we introduce an integrative bioinformatics approach that aims for a reliable
transfer of gene regulatory interactions, which combines
both of the above introduced major approaches: homology detection and DNA binding site prediction. Instead of
studying general trends and conserved network motifs
across hundreds of organisms we are interested in highquality predictions with just few or even no false-positives
for C. diphtheriae, C. efficiens, and C. jeikeium based on evidenced observations from the model organism C. glutamicum.
The success of the approach relies on the optimal interplay of the used bioinformatics components. On a very
general level, the workflow is depicted in figure 1. An integrated database system is used for data fusion of annotated nucleotide and amino acid sequences together with
evidenced transcriptional regulatory relationships and
corresponding sequence features. By having all required
data at hand we can re-adjust inaccurately determined TF
binding sequences by shifting some motifs by some positions and by assigning a strand annotation, if necessary.
Sequence motif discovery tools [17] may be utilized for
that purpose or publicly available special purpose tools,
such as MoRAine [18]. After computing a PWM for each
transcriptional regulator of the model organism from the
re-annotated TFBSs, motif matching tools (such as PoSSuMsearch [19] or MATCH [20]) are used to predict binding sites in the target organism assuming that the DNAbinding motif of the regulator is sufficiently conserved.
This is done for any pair of the conserved regulators and
target genes. It is obvious that the TF itself has to be conserved in the target organism; but the second condition
(homologous target genes) is very important as well to
provide reliable, high-quality predictions since a highscoring PWM-based sequence match alone is not very
meaningful [10]. This is the only way to reduce the huge
amount of false-positives without further background
knowledge even for comparatively restrictive thresholds
that miss most of the true-positives. An application example illustrating the problem for corynebacteria may be
found in ref. [11]. The detection of conserved, orthologous proteins based on the given amino acid sequences
alone was a long-standing challenge in computational
biology. It emerged that clustering approaches utilizing

Using genetic upstream sequences and transcription factor binding site annotations the TFBSs can be re-adjusted and modeled
as PWMs for subsequent TFBS predictions. Sequence clustering tools can be applied to the stored genome annotation and

from a model organism to a closely related species if the regulator as well as the target gene are orthologous and a matching

BLAST[21]-based pairwise sequence similarity measures
attack the problem comparatively well. Popular
approaches are Markov clustering [22], spectral clustering
[23] and graph cluster editing [24,25].

Results and discussion
To demonstrate our combined approach we decided to
integrate MoRAine [18] for TFBS readjustment, PoSSuMsearch [19] for binding motif matching, and FORCE [25]
for homology detection and applied it to corynebacterial

data gained from CoryneRegNet [5] (see additional file 1).
The goal was to use proven knowledge from the model
organism C. glutamicum (CG) to predict reliable gene regulatory networks in C. diphtheriae (CD), which is a human
pathogen, C. jeikeium (CJ) that is pathogen and extremely
antibiotic resistant, and the sister organism of CG namely
C. efficiens (CE), which is import for biotechnological production processes. First, the homology detection identified the common repertoire of conserved transcription
factors between CG and CD, CE, and CJ (49, 77, and 31

regulators respectively). This observation of an average
common TF set of ~70% fits well with the previously published study on the individual and common repertoire of
corynebacteria [26]. For the next step in the pipeline the
known transcription factor binding sites for each of the 69
characterized TFs of CG have been re-adjusted resulting in
an average improvement of the mean information content of the underlying position frequency matrices of
~23% (see additional file 2). Subsequently, PWMs are
computed and matched with all upstream sequences of
orthologous target genes in CD, CE, and CJ to predict
putative TFBSs. In the case of ambiguity of the homology
prediction, the pipeline also considers the neighborhood
of the respective genes in the target organism and chooses
the candidate gene with the maximal number of homologous genes in the genetic surrounding. If the regulator, the
target gene, and the binding site are conserved sufficiently,
the regulation is considered to be conserved and added to
the pipeline's output. Although these restrictions are very
strict, we found 530 reliable novel gene regulations for
CD, CE, and CJ and thereby increased the database content of the reference database CoryneRegNet considerably
(factor 4.2). For the three organisms we identified reliable
transcriptional gene regulations for ~40% of the common
transcription factors, compared to ~5% for which knowledge was available before. Table 1 statistically summarizes
the original and the transferred database content. Figure
2a exemplarily shows a network visualization of the PcaR
regulon as known from CG compared to the transferred
one of CE. It is obvious that all of the 11 target genes
including the regulator itself are orthologous between CG
and CE. Since the binding sites are conserved too, as indicated by the sequence logos in figure 2b/c, the pipeline
considered all regulations as transferable from CG to CE.
This observation fits well with the known PcaR regulon of
C. efficiens [27].
The whole data analysis procedure is very time-efficient (<
1 min computing time) and we added the new datasets
into the CoryneRegNet 5.0 database for public access.
Although it is very likely that our predictions are highly
reliable we separated the evidenced from the predicted
datasets within the front-end and now provide two subversions of CoryneRegNet.
In the application described above, we combined the software packages MoRAine, FORCE, and PoSSuMsearch into
a data fusion workflow that is responsible for the data
transfer between model and target organisms. One could
also think about a combination of other computational
biology tools designed for the same purpose. For instance
FORCE could be replaced by TribeMCL [22] and PoSSuMsearch by MATCH [20]. We decided to use PoSSuMsearch
since it provides statistically sound p-value computations
within reasonable response times [19]. FORCE has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/3/8

included into the pipeline since it has been shown to outperform other clustering approaches on prokaryotic datasets [25].
With Regulogger [28], Alkema et al. presented a pipeline
that mainly focuses on the reconstruction of conserved
regulatory networks for Staphylococcus aureus. Regulogger
mainly concentrates on the detection and characterization
of conserved sequences in promoter regions (phylogenetic footprinting) of orthologous genes. For the determination of these orthologous genes, the COG database [29]
is used, which is impracticable at least for our target species since no COG annotations are available for other
corynebacteria than C. glutamicum. In the near future,
novel ultra-fast sequencing technologies will provide
much more data on organisms that are not included in
COG. In [30] and a subsequent follow-up study [31], the
TRACTOR_DB database [32] was used to identify conserved regulatory interactions between E. coli and thirty
gamma-proteobacteria. Here, pairwise BLAST Bidirectional Best Hits (BBHs) are used directly to identify
orthologous genes, which may result in suboptimal predictions [25]. However, the presented results support our
strategy to combine orthology information with binding
site detection. Besides, the conservation of gene regulatory
networks between corynebacterial organisms has never
been studied before and the integration of the presented
results into the CoryneRegNet reference database provides
a powerful tool for further network studies.
The current study is strongly limited by the level of phylogenetic conservation between the reference organism and
the target species. Since remodeling of transcriptional
gene regulation is a crucial strategy used by bacteria to
evolve and regulate novel biochemical features, (1) specific regulatory pathways may have been altered and (2)
unique transcriptional regulatory mechanisms may have
been developed. The following three limitations with our
approach for inter-species network transfer arouse: (1)
Interactions that do not evolve in the reference species
cannot be detected in a specific target organism. (2) Utilizing pure sequence-based similarities for in silico orthology detections neglect that proteins with comparably high
overall amino acid sequence similarity may have different
specific functions within the cell although they are predicted as putative homologs and vice versa. (3) In our
approach, we assume that a conserved transcription factor
in the target organism interacts with a binding site that is
very similar to that in the reference organism. This is not
necessarily the case and may result in both, false positive
and false negative predictions. However, the rapidly
increasing amount of fully sequenced organisms without
much background knowledge about their gene regulatory
repertoire strongly restricts our alternatives to computa-

Conclusion
Besides the immediate advantages for the worldwide
medical and biotechnological corynebacteria community,
we anticipate the presented results to be a starting point

for an integrated analysis of gene regulatory networks in
the light of a combined analysis of orthologous genes conjointly with conserved DNA binding sites. Although we
tested the presented strategy with corynebacteria, it is of
general interest and can be applied to many other organisms as well. We conclude that trustworthy transfers of
gene regulatory networks between organisms on a

Appendix
Here, we briefly introduce the integrated bioinformatics
tools that have been utilized for this article.
MoRAine – Regulatory binding site re-adjustment
MoRAine is a software that re-assesses and re-annotates
transcription factor binding sites. Each TFBS sequence
with experimental evidence underlying a PWM model is
compared against each other. MoRAine heuristically
solves a combinatorial optimization problem to readjust
TFBSs by possibly switching their strands and shifting

them a few positions to the left or to the right in order to
maximize the mean information content of the resulting
PWM. In [18] we validated and confirmed the improvement of the PWM-based TFBS prediction performance for
E. coli by using MoRAine as pre-processing step prior to
PWM computation. For this article, we applied MoRAine
to adjust corynebacterial TFBSs for computing the PWM
model being the input for PoSSuMsearch.
PoSSuMsearch – Statistically sound binding site prediction
The in silico prediction of TFBSs is a long-standing challenge in computational biology and several software tools
exist for this purpose. Here we used PoSSuMsearch. It provides a combination of (non-permuted) lookahead scoring and efficiently searching an enhanced suffix array that
previously has been created from corynebacterial
upstream sequences. The scores of putative matches are
compared to a threshold that is computed based on the
tolerable frequency of hits in random sequences (p-value)
by an efficient and exact lazy-evaluation method [19]. To
our knowledge, PoSSuMsearch is the only available bioinformatics tool that provides a statistically sound TFBS
match evaluation together with reasonable response
times. We used PoSSuMsearch to predict putative binding
sites for conserved corynebacterial regulators.
FORCE – Transitivity clustering of protein sequences
Another long-standing challenge in bioinformatics is the
detecting of homologous proteins based on amino acid
sequence similarity. For this purpose, we recently developed a clustering approach based on weighted graph cluster editing (or weighted transitive graph projection). With
FORCE, we presented a heuristic that solves the respective
NP-hard graph-modification problem. In [25], we demonstrated the ability of FORCE to cluster hundreds of

thousands of protein sequences efficiently and accurately.
Our evaluations with gold standard databases show that it
outperforms other tools at least in terms of accuracy. In
particular its ability to handle huge datasets makes it the
ideal candidate for the study introduced in this article. We
used FORCE as homology detection software to identify
conserved transcriptional regulators as well as orthologous target genes.

Data fusion workflow as used for the presented study with CoryneRegNet. We used all validated datasets of Corynebacterium glutamicum
from the CoryneRegNet database. All known transcription factor binding
sites were re-adjusted by using MoRAine (no position shifts, but strand
annotation; method: Cluster growing/Motif-seed similarity) for subsequent computations of position weight matrices (PWMs). We utilized
PoSSuMsearch to scan the upstream/promoter sequences of all transcription units of C. efficiens, C. diphtheriae, and C. jeikeium, extracted
from CoryneRegNet, to scan for putative transcription factor binding sites
by using the MoRAine-adjusted binding sites of C. glutamicum. All
amino acid sequences of C. efficiens, C. diphtheriae, C. glutamicum,
and C. jeikeium were extracted from CoryneRegNet and grouped into
clusters of orthologous/conserved corynebacterial proteins by using the
FORCE software. We consider two genes as orthologous/conserved (1) if
the corresponding proteins are in the same FORCE cluster and (2) if at
least one of the surrounding genes is also "FORCE-conserved". We consider a gene regulatory interaction as conserved between C. glutamicum
and another corynebacterium if (1) the transcription factor is conserved
(2) its binding sites are conserved, and (3) the putative target genes are
conserved as well. The corresponding gene regulation is added to the CoryneRegNet 5.0 p database. Refer to the CoryneRegNet web site for an interactive version of this picture including links to the corresponding tools.
