Abstract
Background: Recent publications concerning the interordinal phylogeny of placental mammals
have converged on a common signal, consisting of four major radiations with some ambiguity
regarding the placental root. The DNA data with which these relationships have been
reconstructed are easily accessible from public databases; access to morphological characters is
much more difficult. Here, I present a graphical web-database of morphological characters focusing
on placental mammals, in tandem with a combined-data phylogenetic analysis of placental mammal
phylogeny.
Results: The results reinforce the growing consensus regarding the extant placental mammal
clades of Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Euarchontoglires, and Laurasiatheria. Unweighted parsimony
applied to all DNA sequences and insertion-deletion (indel) characters of extant taxa alone support
a placental root at murid rodents; combined with morphology this shifts to Afrotheria. Bayesian
analyses of morphology, indels, and DNA support both a basal position for Afrotheria and the
position of Cretaceous eutherians outside of crown Placentalia. Depending on treatment of third
codon positions, the affinity of several fossils (Leptictis,Paleoparadoxia, Plesiorycteropus and
Zalambdalestes) vary, highlighting the potential effect of sequence data on fossils for which such data
are missing.
Conclusion: The combined dataset supports the location of the placental mammal root at
Afrotheria or Xenarthra, not at Erinaceus or rodents. Even a small morphological dataset can have
a marked influence on the location of the root in a combined-data analysis. Additional
morphological data are desirable to better reconstruct the position of several fossil taxa; and the
graphic-rich, web-based morphology data matrix presented here will make it easier to incorporate
more taxa into a larger data matrix.

Background
Cladistic phylogeny reconstruction of mammals has its
roots in publications by Malcolm McKenna [1] and was
more explicitly algorithmic in the 1980s [2,3]. In the latter
publications, discrete characters were analysed with an
explicit optimality criterion, and were in principle observ-

able by anyone with access to relevant material, in order
to make specific, testable hypotheses regarding mammalian interrelationships. In retrospect, debate about mammalian interrelationships following these publications
moved away from competing authoritarian statements on
how mammalian groups are interrelated and towards a

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:108

more focused discussion of the actual characters upon
which such interrelationships are hypothesized [e.g., [4]].
Objections to algorithmic approaches to phylogeny
reconstruction, particularly regarding its practice among
morphologists [e.g., [5]], have occasionally noted the
uninformative and/or low quality of character descriptions. Individual investigators are not necessarily to fault
for the format in which their character lists are published,
as editorial standards for such information vary widely,
not to mention the capacity of different journals to publish graphic and/or textual appendices. Nevertheless, calls
for the improvement of standards by which morphological character data are published, and by which they are
selected for inclusion in a given study, have been made
[e.g., [6]].
Web-based databanks offer an ideal means by which the
information content of anatomical character sets can be
maximized. Initiatives such as digimorph [36], morphobank.org [37] and morphbank.net [38] have for several years taken advantage of this medium [7] , and have
made it easier for investigators to evaluate morphological
data with the ultimate goal of better understanding character evolution and phylogeny. However, as of this writing, a databank focusing on the skeletal anatomy of
placental mammals is still lacking.
Hypotheses of placental mammal phylogeny
A widely cited dataset consisting primarily of nuclear
DNA sequences [8,9] has been interpreted to contain an
unambiguous signal dividing placental mammals into
four main clades: Xenarthra (armadillos, sloths, and anteaters), Afrotheria (sea cows, elephants, hyraxes, elephant
shrews, aardvarks, tenrecs, and golden moles), Euarchontoglires (primates, tree shrews, colugos, rodents, and lagomorphs), and Laurasiatheria (lipotyphlans, bats,
carnivorans, pangolins, perissodactyls, whales, and artiodactyls), with a root separating Afrotheria from the
remaining placental mammals. Studies of mtDNA that
include both coding and non-coding sequences [10], as
well as the longest concatenation of nuclear DNA to date
[11], with ca. 200,000 aligned nucleotides for 18 terminal
taxa, support this topology.

Other DNA datasets, including analyses of rare molecular
features such as the presence/absence of retroposons [12]
and sequence analysis of LINEs [13], provide independent
support for the same unrooted topology, but disagree on
the location of the root. This falls either at Atlantogenata
(Afrotheria+Xenarthra) [13,14], Xenarthra [12], or Glires
(Rodentia+Lagomorpha) [15]. Earlier analyses of mitochondrial protein-coding genes [16] and of a combined
morphology+DNA dataset [17] have also supported a
basal (and often paraphyletic) position of rodents,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/108

although in [16] erinaceids were located at the placental
root, adjacent to murid rodents. The most recent molecular phylogenetic analyses of placental mammals support a
relatively basal position of afrotherians and xenarthrans
(except for [15]), and a monophyletic Rodentia and Glires
[18], but the precise identity of the basal-most placental
taxon remains elusive.
Palaeontological work continues to yield fossil mammals
that are relevant to debates on mammalian phylogeny
and the placental root [19-21]. Some have argued that certain Cretaceous eutherians comprise the sister taxon to
Glires [22]. If Cretaceous eutherian lineages could be
definitively linked with modern rodents and lagomorphs,
this could be interpreted to support to the hypothesis of
Glires basal within Placentalia [15]. However, the most
taxon- and character-rich phylogenetic analyses including
Cretaceous eutherians [20,21] do not support their placement within crown Placentalia, nor are they unanimous
in identifying a basal-most crown placental clade.
In this paper, I present an image-rich, morphological
character-database focusing on placental mammals, in
tandem with a reanalysis of morphological and sequence
data that bear on placental mammal phylogeny. The morphological character list is based on [17], which was in
turn based on the work of many other publications, as
cited therein. I combine these morphological data with
the DNA sequence dataset (19 nuclear and 3 mitochondrial genes) of [9], and for the first time include information on 221 indels from their DNA sequence alignment. I
apply a number of corrections to both the sequence- and
morphological data sets; and using both maximum parsimony (MP) and a Bayesian algorithm, I investigate the
support of these data for the aforementioned hypotheses
on mammalian interrelationships and the placental root.

Results and Discussion
The majority of the combined DNA-morphology analyses
support the clades Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Euarchontoglires, and Laurasiatheria, as well as the placement of the
Tertiary insectivoran-grade mammal Centetodon within
Lipotyphla and the two Cretaceous eutherians (Ukhaatherium and Zalambdalestes) outside of Placentalia (Figs. 1,
2, 3). Using MP, the position of the placental root varies.
With all data and gaps included and weighted equally
(Fig. 1), or with third position transitions removed, it is at
the Malagasy lesser hedgehog-tenrec Echinops, within a
paraphyletic Afrotheria. A strict consensus in each case
leaves the placental base unresolved (Fig. 1A) due to the
variable position of Zalambdalestes. With third positions
of protein-coding genes removed, it is at Xenarthra followed by Afrotheria with Cretaceous taxa outside of
crown Placentalia (Fig. 2). Results from the Bayesian analysis using either living taxa and sequence data alone, or

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:108

including three fossils (Zalambdalestes, Ukhaatherium, and
Centetodon) plus morphology (Fig. 3), places the placental
root at Afrotheria followed by Xenarthra. When included,
Cretaceous taxa are again reconstructed outside of crown
Placentalia.
Interestingly, MP applied only to extant taxa with all DNA
characters, but without morphology, yields a placental
tree rooted on murid rodents (Fig. 4B). Inclusion of morphology changes this signal to favour a root within
Afrotheria, at the Malagasy tenrec Echinops (Fig. 4A).
Removal of third positions favours a placental root at
Xenarthra (Fig. 2) with or without morphological data. As
evident by comparing Figs. 1B and 4A, exclusion of the 12
fossil taxa in the equally weighted MP analysis does not
shift the root away from the afrotherian Echinops.
Table 1 summarizes the results of Templeton and Winning Sites tests using PAUP 4.0b10 [23] evaluating competing hypotheses on the location of the placental root.
Using MP applied to the combined dataset, and regardless
of the treatment of third positions, the hypotheses of
Glires or Erinaceus basal are rejected. With third coding
positions excluded, these tests yield p-values close to but
not consistently below 0.05 for both Atlantogenata and
Muridae at the placental root. With all DNA-indel-morphology characters included, Atlantogenata is rejected
and Muridae is not. Monophyletic, basal Afrotheria or
Xenarthra is not rejected in any case (Table 1).
The position of the placental root influences the optimization of morphological characters throughout the placental tree. However, some morphological characters
optimize at the root of Placentalia under a number of
hypotheses. With either Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Atlantogenata, Glires, Muridae, or Erinaceus at the placental base,
three morphological character states optimize as placental
synapomorphies: #39-1 (single hypoglossal foramen),
#48-0 (foramen rotundum confluent with sphenorbital
fissure), and #159-1 (epipubic bones absent). With either
Afrotheria or Atlantogenata basal, two additional morphological synapomorphies for Placentalia optimize
unambiguously: #11-0 (presence of a sulcus for the internal carotid artery on the promontorium of the petrosal)
and #105-1 (prominent lingual cusp on upper P3). A paraphyletic Rodentia at or near the placental base (following [16] or Fig. 4B) greatly increases the number of
morphological characters that show unambiguous change
on the branch leading to crown Placentalia, and requires
significantly more homoplasy among morphological
characters than the other hypotheses of rooting.
The placement of several fossils, namely Leptictis,Paleoparadoxia, Plesiorycteropus and Zalambdalestes, remains ambiguous in this study. However, when resolved, the latter

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/108

taxon falls outside of crown Placentalia (Figs. 2, 3); this
result has also been supported by other, independent
datasets [20,21]. In the current study, the treatment of
DNA third positions influences the topology of several
fossils, a result that may appear counterintuitive since all
DNA data are missing for these fossils. Nevertheless, this
is a straightforward result based on the altered optimizations of morphological characters on those branches of
the tree that are rearranged by addition of the sequence
partition, which in turn can affect the influence of those
characters on the placement of fossils [24].

Conclusion
Compared to just a decade ago, there is now a broad level
of agreement on the basic topology of the extant mammalian radiation [e.g., [8-14]]. Using a relatively large DNAindel-morphology dataset based on [8,9,17], this study
has made a number of changes to both molecular and
morphological homology (see additional file 1), yet
recovers the same basic pattern of living placental phylogeny (Figs. 1, 2, 3), dividing the unrooted tree into Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Euarchontoglires, and Laurasiatheria.
The same level of agreement cannot yet be said to exist for
all fossil clades. In this study, Ukhaatherium, Centetodon,
Hyopsodus, Meniscotherium, Phenacodus, Arsinoitherium,
Moeritherium, and Anagale are placed with some consistency across analyses. The remaining four fossils (Leptictis,
Paleoparadoxia, Plesiorycteropus, and Zalambdalestes) vary in
their position depending on the analysis, indicating that
at present the morphological data sampled here are not
sufficient to reconstruct the phylogeny of these taxa. I concur with [25] that the current morphological sample
could be expanded significantly. Nevertheless, this study
demonstrates that even a small morphological dataset can
influence a much larger body of DNA sequences. Here,
morphology not only improves resolution in some clades
that remain poorly resolved based on DNA sequences
alone (e.g., favouring sea cow-elephant), but can also shift
the placental root from Muridae to Afrotheria (Fig. 4). The
combined data favour a placental root at either Afrotheria
or Xenarthra (Table 1; Figs. 1, 2, 3). Both Atlantogenata
and Muridae receive suggestively low p-values with third
coding positions excluded; Glires and Erinaceus are the
least favoured root-taxa among the alternatives tested
with the present dataset.
The morphological web-database presented here will
make it easier for researchers to incorporate these data
into larger phylogenetic matrices that sample additional
fossils. In the long term, such representations will be
essential to reconstruct the morphology of the placental
common ancestor. Towards this end, morphological character matrices should be easily accessible and understandable across institutions and generations of scientists; and

they should build upon previous work in order to offer an
ever-expanding character database. Many kinds of molecular data have enjoyed such accessibility for well over a
decade. The relatively infrequent presentation of graphic
character databases limits the utility and appreciation of
morphological character matrices, a condition that in
recent years has, fortunately, begun to change.

Morphology matrix
The current web-matrix includes corrections to Appendices 1 and 2 of [17] [see additional file 1]. Among the typographical errors listed, only one had an effect on the
analysis: character 41 of Tapirus ("mastoid exposure in
braincase") was inadvertently omitted from the printed
Appendix 1 from [17]. It should have been listed as state
"0" for Tapirus (mastoid exposed). With this correction,
and using either PAUP [23] or NONA [27] under the analytical defaults of POY 2.7 [28] (e.g., polymorphisms
treated as missing data), the morphological dataset published in appendix 1 of [17] yields the reported 4 trees at
1088 steps.

The terms "fenestra rotunda", "fenestra cochleae", and
"round window" have been used interchangeably for the

aperture in the ventrum of the petrosal pars cochlearis,
leading into the cochlea, just posterior to the fenestra vestibularis (or oval window; see [29]). Asher et al. [17,24]
had previously used the descriptor "rotundum" for this
structure in characters 4 and 5, which should have been
reserved for the distinct exit foramen for the maxillary
division of the trigeminal nerve (as in primates, carnivorans, and marsupials). In order to avoid confusion
between the fenestra "rotunda" (round window) and the
foramen "rotundum" (exit foramen for V-2), text and
images for characters 4–7 now use the term "fenestra
cochleae" for this opening on the ventrum of the pars
cochlearis, following [29].
Relative to the descriptions first published in [17], the text
for several characters has been changed in order to better
correspond to the specimens available for display on the
website.
In addition to the typographical corrections summarized
above, some of the coding decisions in [17] have also
been changed [see additional file 1], which of course do
influence the structure of the tree. Six of these were indicated in [24]; four additional improvements are identified
here.
First, instead of identifying a separate character state for
"glenoid poorly defined" for character #56 in Manis, this
character is coded as in most other mammals: state 0, "glenoid even with petrosal." This increases consistency in
how the fossil taxon Plesiorycteropus was coded, and
reflects the actual position of the glenoid fossa for the
mandible in a transverse plane near the petrosal bone, as
opposed to the dorsally situated glenoid in, for example,
chrysochlorids or caviomorph rodents.
Second, the lacrimal bone (character #71) in leporid
skulls is not always well ossified to surrounding bones,
and in some specimens it may fall out leaving an artefactual "fenestra" in the anterior orbit. This was incorrectly
coded in [17,24] as a separate character state, "fenestra in
anterior orbit." Here, this is recoded in the leporid terminal as "lacrimal foramen present."
Third, Didelphis possesses a distinct foramen rotundum
(i.e., exit foramen for the maxillary [2nd] division of the
trigeminal nerve, character #48), just posterior to the
sphenorbital fissure [30,31]. The foramen rotundum was
mistakenly coded as "confluent with sphenorbital fissure"
in [2,17,24]. It is here corrected to state 1 ("distinct") to
reflect the ossified, separate exit foramen for the maxillary
division of the trigeminal nerve in this taxon.

foramen, reflecting the usage of [31]. As summarized by
[[32]: p. 175], the terms "condylar" or "condyloid"
foramen have been used for this structure [2]. However,
the descriptor "condylar" or "dorsal condylar" may also
refer to small, nutrient foramina adjacent to the occipital
condyle [[32]: p. 151]. Several taxa show multiple
foramina that perforate the basioccipital anterior to the
occipital condyle (e.g., Didelphis); others show a single,
conspicuous hypoglossal foramen (e.g., Pteropus), and
others lack a hypoglossal foramen (e.g., Balaenoptera).
Asher et al. [17,24] had previously coded Orycteropus, Sus,
and Sorex as lacking hypoglossal foramina; here, these
codings are corrected to state 1 ("single") for the former
two, and states 0 and 1 (polymorphic) for Sorex.
DNA sequence and indel dataset
Sequences of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene in Equus (accession AF252540) were added to the alignment of [9]. In
addition, several interruptions of the reading frame and
placements of several indels were adjusted (see additional
file 1), amounting to 34 alterations in presumed sequence
homology. In addition, 221 insertion-deletion indel characters from protein-coding genes in this DNA dataset were
incorporated into a new phylogenetic analysis using MP
[23] and MrBayes [33]. Each indel character is coded as 0
(for gaps) or 1 (for insertions) and consists of one or more
units of three contiguous gaps. Regardless of length, such
occurrences were coded as a single, binary character,
shared by two or more taxa when they show overlap.
Elongate gaps that overlapped with multiple, smaller gaps
were coded as a single event; i.e., when an elongate gap
character in taxon A overlapped with multiple, smaller
gap characters in taxa B and C, the smaller gap-characters
were coded as inapplicable for taxon A and treated as
missing data in the analysis, based on the method of "simple indel coding" [34]. The newly-aligned sequence dataset is available linked to additional file 1. Exclusion of
sites identified as "alignment ambiguous" by [9] did not
have a significant effect on the topologies reported here.
Taxon sample
The choice of Recent taxa for inclusion in this dataset is
based on maximizing the overlap of the morphological
dataset with the 19 nuclear and 3 mitochondrial gene
dataset used by [9]. This is the same sample used by [24],
and is slightly smaller than that used by [17], including 41
extant and 12 extinct mammalian terminals. Not included
are the sciurid, Bradypus, Tadarida, and Vampyrum
sequences used by [9]; and a single terminal is used for the
Caribbean lipotyphlan Solenodon (using sequence data for
Solenodon paradoxus). Several terminal taxa are composites, listed here with suprageneric names, and are identified in table 1 of [24].

Fourth, character #39 "condyloid foramina" should have
been worded to specifically indicate the hypoglossal

Phylogenetic analysis parameters
Different schemes for weighting third positions codons in
MP (excluded, transitions ignored, included) were
explored. Sequence data for all fossils were coded as missing; all morphological character changes were treated as
nonadditive (unordered). In all MP analyses, multistate
characters were treated as polymorphic, indel characters
embedded in the sequence data matrix were treated as
missing data (but were represented in an additional character matrix), and tree searches using PAUP [23] were heuristic using at least 200 random addition replicates and
TBR branch-swapping. Bootstrap values are based on at
least 100 pseudoreplicates of a 3-replicate TBR random
addition sequence.

Analyses with MrBayes [33] used the AIC as applied in
MrModeltest [35], based on ML scores generated by PAUP
[23], to determine the model of evolution for each genetic
locus independently as well as for the combined nuclear
and mitochondrial genes as two discrete partitions. In
most cases this identified the GTR+G+I model as optimal
(Table 2). Bayesian treebuilding was computationally
intensive. Partitioning the data into units of nuclear (ca.
15KB) and mitochondrial (ca. 1.5KB) DNA, plus 221
indel characters, the former two with an independent
GTR+G+I model and the latter with a restriction site
model (as recommended in MrBayes documentation),
and combining them with the datasets for morphology
including fossil taxa, took 18 days for 2 million generations on a single mac G5 processor (2.5 GHz and 2.5 GB
RAM) with MrBayes 3.1. This still did not yield convergence across two independent runs. Hence, Bayesian analyses included three of the 12 sampled fossils (plus all 41
Recent taxa), using just over 1.6 million generations in
two independent runs, which yielded the same consensus
of post-burnin topologies (Fig. 3).
Analysis of sequence data for the 41 extant terminals only,
with three unlinked evolution models defined for
nucDNA, mtRNA, and indels, yielded convergence for two
independent runs after ca. 3 weeks of uninterrupted computing time for one million generations on a 2Ghz P4
desktop PC with 512MB RAM. Using 21 unlinked models
of sequence evolution for each gene (Table 2) in two additional runs of one million generations each yielded the
same post-burnin, majority rule consensus topology as
the 3-model analysis. Based on manual inspection of likelihood scores, Bayesian analyses across these analyses
reached stationarity after approximately 15K generations;
burn-in was conservatively defined after 50K generations.
Statistical tests of competing topologies were carried out
in PAUP 4.0b10 [23]. One of the four MPTs including all
data with all changes equal (Fig. 1), and one of the four
MPTs resulting from the analysis excluding third coding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/108

positions (Fig. 2), were compared with several alternatives
(Table 1). Because of differences in taxon sample across
studies concerning the root of Placentalia [e.g., [9,15,16]],
these alternatives were constructed with the present dataset, using backbone-constraints derived from each study.
For example, taxa from the present dataset sampled in
common with [16] were constrained in PAUP to fit figure
1 from [16], which supported erinaceid insectivorans
basal followed by murid rodents. One of the resulting
MPTs was then compared to an unconstrained, optimal
MPT using the present morphology-DNA-indel dataset
under the assumptions given in Fig. 1 (equal weighting)
and Fig. 2 (third positions excluded). The same procedure
was followed for hypotheses supporting basal positions of
Atlantogenata [14], Xenarthra [12], Afrotheria [9], Glires
[15], and Muridae (Fig. 4B).
