Abstract
Background: The Viridiplantae comprise two major phyla: the Streptophyta, containing the
charophycean green algae and all land plants, and the Chlorophyta, containing the remaining green
algae. Despite recent progress in unravelling phylogenetic relationships among major green plant
lineages, problematic nodes still remain in the green tree of life. One of the major issues concerns
the scaly biflagellate Mesostigma viride, which is either regarded as representing the earliest
divergence of the Streptophyta or a separate lineage that diverged before the Chlorophyta and
Streptophyta. Phylogenies based on chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes support the latter
view. Because some green plant lineages are not represented in these phylogenies, sparse taxon
sampling has been suspected to yield misleading topologies. Here, we describe the complete
chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence of the early-diverging charophycean alga Chlorokybus
atmophyticus and present chloroplast genome-based phylogenies with an expanded taxon sampling.
Results: The 152,254 bp Chlorokybus cpDNA closely resembles its Mesostigma homologue at the
gene content and gene order levels. Using various methods of phylogenetic inference, we analyzed
amino acid and nucleotide data sets that were derived from 45 protein-coding genes common to
the cpDNAs of 37 green algal/land plant taxa and eight non-green algae. Unexpectedly, all best trees
recovered a robust clade uniting Chlorokybus and Mesostigma. In protein trees, this clade was sister
to all streptophytes and chlorophytes and this placement received moderate support. In contrast,
gene trees provided unequivocal support to the notion that the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade
represents the earliest-diverging branch of the Streptophyta. Independent analyses of structural
data (gene content and/or gene order) and of subsets of amino acid data progressively enriched in
slow-evolving sites led us to conclude that the latter topology reflects the true organismal
relationships.
Conclusion: In disclosing a sister relationship between the Mesostigmatales and Chlorokybales,
our study resolves the long-standing debate about the nature of the unicellular flagellated ancestors
of land plants and alters significantly our concepts regarding the evolution of streptophyte algae.
Moreover, in predicting a richer chloroplast gene repertoire than previously inferred for the
common ancestor of all streptophytes, our study has contributed to a better understanding of
chloroplast genome evolution in the Viridiplantae.

Background
Analyses of morphological and ultrastructural characters,
and also of the information carried by gene sequences
have established that green algae belonging to the class
Charophyceae gave rise to the more than 500,000 land
plant species currently inhabiting our planet [1,2]. Charophycean green algae and land plants form the green plant
lineage Streptophyta [3], whereas most, if not all, of the
other extant green algae belong to the sister lineage Chlorophyta [2]. In contrast to the large diversity of land
plants, only a few thousands charophycean species are living today. Six monophyletic groups are currently recognized in the Charophyceae: the Mesostigmatales [4]
represented by Mesostigma viride, a scaly biflagellate that
has long been thought to be a member of the Prasinophyceae (the earliest-diverging lineage of the Chlorophyta) [5]; the Chlorokybales represented as well by a
single species (Chlorokybus atmophyticus); the Klebsormidiales (3 genera, 45 spp.); the Zygnematales (~ 50 genera,
~ 6,000 spp.); the Coleochaetales (3 genera, 20 spp.); and
the Charales (6 genera, 81 spp.) [6].
Recent phylogenetic studies of nuclear and organelle gene
sequences have yielded conflicting results regarding the
branching order of charophycean lineages and the identity of the charophycean lineage(s) that is/are sister to
land plants. A phylogeny based on four genes from three
cellular compartments (the nuclear 18S rRNA gene, the
chloroplast atpB and rbcL and the mitochondrial nad5)
supports the notions that the Charales are sister to land
plants and that charophycean green algae evolved progressively toward a more elaborated cellular complexity,
occurring sequentially as biflagellated unicells, cubical
packets of two, four or eight non-flagellated cells (sarcinoid morphology), unbranched/branched filaments and
complex branched thalli with parenchymatous tissue
[4,7]. In this four-gene tree, inferred using the glaucocystophyte Cyanophora paradoxa and chlorophyte green
algae as outgroup, the deepest branch is occupied by the
Mesostigmatales, the Chlorokybales emerge just after the
Mesostigmatales, the Zygnematales are resolved as the
next divergence, and finally the Coleochaetales are sister
to the clade uniting the Charales and land plants.
Although the latter clade received strong support (> 90%
bootstrap value), moderate bootstrap support was
observed for the positions of the Coleochaetales, Zygnematales and Klebsormidiales. In contrast, our phylogenetic analyses of more than 50 genes and proteins derived
from complete charophycean chloroplast genome
sequences using Mesostigma as an outgroup do not indicate the existence of a sister relationship between the Charales and land plants [8,9]. These analyses, which are
independently supported by structural genomic features,
rather identified the Charales as a basal divergence relative
to both the Coleochaetales, Zygnematales and land

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/2

plants. The position of the Mesostigmatales in the
Viridiplantae is also a matter of controversy. In the fourgene tree [4] and in trees based on 18S rDNA [10], actin
genes [11] and concatenated chloroplast genes [12], Mesostigma represents the earliest divergence of the Streptophyta; however, separate phylogenetic analyses of
multiple mitochondrial and chloroplast genes place
theMesostigmatales before the split of the Streptophyta
and Chlorophyta [13-17]. More recently, the finding that
Mesostigma shares more ESTs with land plants than with
the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [18] as well as
the discoveries of a multigene family (BIP2-like
sequences) [19] and a GapA/B gene duplication [18,20]
restricted to Mesostigma and streptophytes were interpreted as compelling evidence for the affiliation of this
unicellular biflagellate with the Streptophyta.
We have undertaken the sequencing of the chloroplast
genome from representatives of all charophycean lineages
to unravel the phylogenetic relationships among these
lineages and to gain insight into the origin of the highly
conservative pattern displayed by land plant chloroplast
DNAs (cpDNAs). We have reported thus far the cpDNA
sequences of Mesostigma viride (Mesostigmatales) [13],
Chaetosphaeridium globosum (Coleochaetales) [21], Staurastrum punctulatum and Zygnema circumcarinatum (Zygnematales) [22], and Chara vulgaris [8]. Comparative
analyses of Mesostigma cpDNA (137 genes, no intron)
with its land plant counterparts (110–120 genes, about 20
introns) revealed substantial changes in genome architecture (namely gene losses, intron insertions, and scrambling in gene order) [13]. Chaetosphaeridium and Chara
cpDNAs more closely resemble their land plant counterparts than Mesostigma cpDNA at the levels of gene content
(125 and 127 genes, respectively), intron content (18
introns in both cpDNAs), and gene order [8,21]. Like
most land plant and green algal cpDNAs, Mesostigma, Chaetosphaeridium, and Chara cpDNAs exhibit a quadripartite
structure that is characterized by the presence of two copies of a rRNA-containing inverted repeat (IR) separated by
large (LSC) and small (SSC) single-copy regions. In contrast, the chloroplast genomes of the zygnematalean algae
Staurastrum and Zygnema lack an IR [22]. Although their
gene content (121 and 125 genes in Staurastrum and Zygnema, respectively) is similar to that found in Chaetosphaeridium and bryophyte cpDNAs, they feature substantial
differences in overall gene order and intron content (8
and 13 introns). Comparative analyses of the abovementioned genomes revealed that the chloroplast genome of
land plants inherited a myriad of characters from charophycean green algae [8,9].
In the present study, we describe the complete cpDNA
sequence of Chlorokybus atmophyticus (Chlorokybales) and
present chloroplast phylogenies based on the genomic

data currently available for land plants, green algae, and
other algae with primarily- or secondarily-acquired chloroplasts. We show that the Chlorokybus chloroplast
genome bears close resemblance to its Mesostigma homologue and that the Mesostigmatales and Chlorokybales
form a strongly supported clade that represents the deepest branch of the Streptophyta.

Results
Structural genomic features
The Chlorokybus cpDNA sequence maps as a circular molecule of 152,254 bp with an overall A+T content of 63.8%
(Figure 1). While this size is in the range expected for a
streptophyte or chlorophyte genome, the nucleotide composition deviates slightly from the range (67.5–73.8%
A+T) previously reported for streptophyte algae [8] and is
most similar to the A+T content found for the ulvophyte
Pseudendoclonium akinetum (62.3%) and the chlorophycean alga Scenedesmus obliquus (67.2%) [23]. Compared to
its Mesostigma homologue, the Chlorokybus genome has a
surplus of 33,894 bp and a deficit of 6.1% in A+T content.
Both genomes are gene-rich and display the typical quadripartite structure found in streptophyte cpDNAs. In Chlorokybus, the two identical IR sequences of 7,640 bp are
separated by a LSC region of 109,098 bp and by a SSC
region of 27,876 bp. A total of 138 genes (not counting
duplicate copies and unique ORFs) are encoded by Chlorokybus cpDNA: six reside in the IR sequence, whereas 23
and 109 are located in the SSC and LSC regions, respectively. The coding sequences of the 138 genes represent
58.8% of the genome size. Although genes are more
tightly packed in the genomes of Mesostigma (73.2%),
Chaetosphaeridium (76.9%), the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (80.7%) and the chlorophytes Nephroselmis olivacea (68.7%) and Scenedesmus (67.2%), a similar level of
compactness is observed for the other completely
sequenced chlorophyte genomes (50.1–62.3%) [23]. At
435 bp, the average size of the intergenic spacers in Chlorokybus cpDNA is twice that found in Mesostigma cpDNA
(221 bp). The intergenic regions account for most of the
difference in nucleotide composition between the two
genomes, with a variation of 13.5% in A+T content found
for these regions (67.7% in Chlorokybus and 81.2% in Mesostigma) relative to only 4.6% for the coding regions
(61.1% in Chlorokybus and 65.7% in Mesostigma). Like its
homologues in Mesostigma and the prasinophyte Nephroselmis, the Chlorokybus genome is poor in introns; it carries a single intron, a group I intron in the trnL(uaa) gene.
Homologous introns at identical position in this chloroplast gene have been reported in virtually all of the streptophytes studied thus far [8] and in a number of
chlorophytes [23].

The gene repertoire of Chlorokybus cpDNA bears most similarity with that of Mesostigma cpDNA and features two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/2

genes (rbcR and ycf27) that have not been identified in the
green algal and land plant chloroplasts investigated to
date. These genes, which encode transcriptional regulators
of the LysR and OmpR families, are present in the chloroplast genome of the glaucocystophyte Cyanophora [24], in
all four completely sequenced red algal cpDNAs (Porphyra
purpurea [25], Cyanidioschyzon merolae [26], Cyanidium
caldarium [27] and Gracilaria tenuistipitata [28]), and in
algal chloroplasts that were acquired by secondary endosymbiosis from the red algal lineage (the heterokont
Odontella sinensis [29], the cryptophyte Guillardia theta
[30] and the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi [31]). Besides
rbcR and ycf27, only two genes in Chlorokybus cpDNA
[accD and trnR(ccg)] are missing from Mesostigma cpDNA;
conversely, only three of the Mesostigma genes (bioY, ssrA
and ycf81) are missing from Chlorokybus cpDNA. Together,
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma cpDNAs encode seven genes
[bioY, rbcR, ssrA, ycf27, ycf61, ycf65 and trnA(ggc)] that are
absent from all other completely sequenced chloroplast
genomes of green algae but are found in Cyanophora, red
algal cpDNAs and/or the secondary chloroplasts derived
from the red algal lineage.
At the level of gene organization, Chlorokybus cpDNA also
most closely resembles its Mesostigma homologue (Table
1). In these two genomes, the IR and the corresponding
single-copy regions display essentially the same gene content but vary in the order of 15 blocks of colinear
sequences that collectively encode about 90% of the
shared genes (Figure 1). Using GRIMM, a program allowing pairwise comparisons of gene orders, we estimated
that a total of 14 inversions (4 in the SSC region and 10 in
the LSC region) would be required to interconvert the
chloroplast gene orders of Chlorokybus and Mesostigma.
The Chlorokybus genome is more rearranged than is its
Mesostigma counterpart relative to the IR-containing
genomes of Nephroselmis and representatives of the Streptophyta (Table 1). These results are congruent with the
two best trees based on inversion medians that we
recently inferred from streptophyte gene order data using
Mesostigma as outgroup [8]. In these trees, the branch
leading to Chlorokybus exhibits 9 or 10 inversions compared to the only 2 or 3 inversions observed for the branch
leading to Mesostigma.
The intergenic regions of the Chlorokybus and Mesostigma
genomes were surveyed for the presence of short repeated
sequences (tandem repeats, palindromes and dispersed
repeats). As estimated with RepeatMasker http://
www.repeatmasker.org, short repeats represent only 1.4%
and 0.7% of the intergenic regions in Chlorokybus and Mesostigma cpDNAs, respectively. While short repeats are also
rare in other charophycean green algal genomes and in
Nephroselmis cpDNA, they are much more abundant in the
genomes of chlorophytes representing the Ulvophyceae,

c This value was obtained by dividing the percentage of shared genes/gene pieces found in conserved clusters by the number of conserved clusters.
d The GRIMM web server [70] was used to infer the numbers of inversions required to transform the gene order displayed by Chlorokybus or
Mesostigma cpDNA into those of the compared genomes. In this analysis, the order of the 109 genes/gene pieces shared by the six compared
genomes was examined.

Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae (Table 2). Most of
the Chlorokybus repeats consist of tandem repeats with
repeat units ranging from 9 to 27 bp in size, whereas the
repeats present in Mesostigma consist mainly of stem-loop
structures of 26 to 55 bp.
Phylogenetic inferences based on sequence data
To identify the phylogenetic positions of Chlorokybus and
Mesostigma within the Viridiplantae, we first analyzed an
amino acid data set containing a total of 8,657 sites
(4,179 of which are phylogenetically informative) using
maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML),
ML distance and LogDet methods (Figure 2A). This data
set was derived from 45 protein-coding genes common to
the cpDNAs of 37 green algal/land plant taxa (Table 3)
and eight non-green algae; the non-green algal sequences
served as outgroup to root the trees. Unexpectedly, the
best trees inferred with all four methods identified a clade
uniting Chlorokybus and Mesostigma. This clade received
100% bootstrap support; however, its basal placement relative to the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta (topology T1;
Figure 2A) was moderately supported, with 75% and 80%
bootstrap values in MP and ML analyses, respectively. In
the alternative T2 topology, the Chlorokybus + Mesostigma
clade was identified as the first branch of the Streptophyta, whereas in the alternative T3 topology, it represented the most basal divergence of the Chlorophyta.
Both T2 and T3 were recovered in ML and MP analyses,
with T2 being better supported than T3 in ML analyses
and the situation being reversed in MP analyses. Comparing these results with those reported by Lemieux et al. [13]
indicates that the placement of Mesostigma at the base of

the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta remained favoured
upon broader taxon sampling but received weaker support. In contrast to the study of Lemieux et al. [13] in
which both T2 and T3 proved to be significantly worse
than T1 in confidence tests of tree selections, only the T3
topology was rejected at the 5% percent confidence level
(T2, P = 0.135; T3, P = 0.031) in Approximately Unbiased
(AU) tests.
The relationships observed for the other green algae and
land plant taxa in the phylogeny shown in Figure 2A are
congruent with recently published green plant phylogenies based on whole chloroplast genome sequences [8,3237]. The clade formed by the two zygnematalean green
algae (Staurastrum and Zygnema) is sister to all land plants
and, as previously reported, this sister-relationship is
weakly supported. The bryophytes (Marchantia, Anthoceros
formosae and Physcomitrella patens) are sister to all other
land plants, and again here, support for the monophyly of
this group is weak to moderate. We find unambiguous
support for the gymnosperm lineage (Pinus thunbergii),
being sister to all angiosperms; however, the relationships
among the members of the latter group are less resolved
than in chloroplast phylogenies focusing on streptophytes
and including a larger number of phylogenetically
informative sites [8,32,34,35]. For example, our analysis
fails to identify the monophyly of monocots although it
provides strong support for the monophyly of eudicots
(represented by ten taxa including Nicotiana tabacum,
Spinacia oleracea, Arabidopsis thaliana and Eucalyptus globulus). The monocots Acorus calamus and Phalaenopsis aphrodite would be expected to cluster with the strongly

supported clade uniting the grasses (Zea mays, Saccharum
officinarum, Oryza sativa and Triticum aestivum). For the
Chlorophyta, the basal divergence of the Prasinophyceae
(Nephroselmis) relative to the Ulvophyceae (Pseudendoclonium and Oltmannsiellopsis viridis), Trebouxiophyceae
(Chlorella vulgaris) and Chlorophyceae (Scenedesmus,
Chlamydomonas and Stigeoclonium helveticum) is strongly
supported, but the branching order of the latter three lineages is unclear. In agreement with chlorophyte phylogenies inferred from cpDNA-encoded proteins and genes
[36], the Trebouxiophyceae are sister to the Ulvophyceae.
In contrast, chloroplast phylogenies inferred from gene
order [36] as well as mitochondrial phylogenies inferred
from proteins or genes [38] revealed that the Ulvophyceae
share a sister-relationship with the Chlorophyceae. Concerning the relationships among the other algae examined, our results agree with the chloroplast genome-based
tree reported by Hagopian et al. [28] and with phylogenies
inferred from smaller sets of chloroplast genes [39-41]
and from nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted genes [42-44]
in being consistent with the hypothesis that the chloroplasts of chromists (the chlorophyll c-containing cryptophytes, heterokonts and haptophytes) originated from a
single secondary endosymbiotic event involving a red alga
[45]. We found that Guillardia, Odontella and Emiliania
form a moderately supported clade, which is sister to the
strongly supported clade uniting the red algae Porphyra
(Bangiales, Bangiophycidae) and Gracilaria (Florideophycidae). As expected, the two red algal taxa representing the
Cyanidiales [Cyanidium and Cyanidioschyzon (Bangiophycidae)] robustly cluster in a separate clade.

The phylogenies that we inferred from a separate data set
containing the chloroplast gene sequences (first and second codon positions) for all the proteins analyzed in Figure 2A proved to be more robust than the corresponding
protein trees (Figure 2). The nucleotide data set comprised
a total of 18,116 sites, 7,779 of which are phylogenetically
informative. Better resolution of both internal and terminal nodes was observed for the portions of the gene trees
corresponding to the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta. All
four inference methods identified in 80% to 99% of the
bootstrap replicates the strongly supported clade uniting
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma as the deepest branch of the
Streptophyta (T2 topology, Figure 2B). T1 was the only
alternative topology observed in these analyses. This
topology and the T3 topology were rejected at the 5% percent confidence level (T1, P = 0.028; T3, P = 7e-31) in AU
tests.
Genome-based phylogenies are susceptible to artefacts in
phylogeny reconstructions because they are inherently
associated with limited taxon sampling [35,46,47]. Fastevolving characters, in particular, are challenging for inference of such phylogenies because they are likely to have
experienced many changes that mask the phylogenetic signal [48]. To examine whether these sites are a source of
inconsistency in the protein phylogenies shown in Figure
2A, we analyzed subsets of the original data in which
increasing proportions of the fastest-evolving sites were
removed. Figure 3 shows the effect of excluding 10% to
90% of the phylogenetically informative sites on the
robustness of the Chlorokybus + Mesostigma clade and on

the robustness of the T1, T2 and T3 topologies in both ML
and MP analyses. Whatever the subset of data examined,
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma remained strongly affiliated in
the same clade (Figure 3A). After excluding up to 30% or
40% of the phylogenetically informative sites, the T1
topology was still moderately supported, with bootstrap
values varying from 61% to 87% (Figure 3B). However,
consistent with the idea that the fastest-evolving sites are
a source of phylogenetic inconsistency, removal of 50% to
80% of the phylogenetically informative sites resulted in
a substantial decline in the robustness of T1 and a concomitant increase in the level of support observed for T2
and/or T3, with T2 receiving a maximal support level of
about 80% upon removal of 70% of the informative sites
(Figure 3B). Intriguingly, when fastest-evolving sites were
further removed, the T1 topology became more robust
and received maximal bootstrap support levels of 96%
and 90% in ML and MP analyses, respectively (Figure 3B).
Despite extensive loss of the original information, many

nodes in the best ML tree shown in Figure 2A remained
strongly supported (Figure 4).
In the above analyses focusing on the most reliable slowevolving characters present in the original amino acid data
set, we have also followed the evolution of the phylogenetic signal by tracing the characters supporting unambiguously the T1, T2 or T3 topology (Figure 3C). A
comparable number of characters support unambiguously each of these topologies in the original data set and
most subsets (up to 80% site removal). Importantly, the
vast majority of the approximately 65 characters supporting each topology in the original data set fall within the
fastest-evolving sites. After removing 50% of the phylogenetic information, less than 15 unambiguously supporting characters were identified for each topology, and
exclusion of more than 85% of the information led to
complete loss of the characters providing unambiguous
support for T2 and T3, thus explaining the prevalent

recovery of T1 in analyses of the corresponding data subsets (Figure 3B).
Given that a representative of the Klebsormidiales was not
included in the above analyses, incomplete taxon sampling of the charophycean green algae might have led to
the artefactual clustering of Chlorokybus with Mesostigma.
To investigate the relationship between Chlorokybus and
the Klebsormidiales, we inferred phylogenies from the
chloroplast small and large subunit rRNA genes of Mesostigma, Chlorokybus, Klebsormidium, Entransia, and 17
other streptophytes (Figure 5). Support for the specific
affinity between Mesostigma and Chlorokybus remained
very robust in these analyses, and consistent with the fourgene tree of Karol et al. [4] and our previous phylogenetic
study based on chloroplast rRNA genes [16], Klebsormidium and Entransia formed a lineage that is sister to the
clade uniting the Charales, Coleochaetales, Zynematales
and land plants.

Phylogenetic inferences based on structural data
To gain independent information concerning the phylogenetic position of the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade, we
examined structural features of the chloroplast genome
(gene order and gene content) from the same taxa used in
our phylogenetic analyses of protein and gene sequences.
MP analysis of the gene order data alone (525 characters)
confirmed the close affinity of Mesostigma to Chlorokybus
(29 characters are specifically shared by these algae) and
showed that the clade uniting these two algae represents a
basal divergence of the Streptophyta (Figure 6A).
Although relationships were not as well resolved as in the
phylogenies inferred from sequence data (see Figure 2),
they were found to be generally congruent with these phylogenies. The failure to identify the chlorophytes as a
monophyletic group is probably related to the dramatic
differences in gene order observed in this group
[23,36,49-51]. Likewise, the inclusion of Emiliania within
the clade containing all chlorophytes and streptophytes
probably stems from the considerable gene order divergence displayed by this haptophyte compared to the two
other algae carrying secondary chloroplasts and the red
algae [31].

MP analysis of gene content yielded a phylogeny more
poorly resolved than that inferred from gene order (Figure
6B). Although this analysis failed to identify the Chlorokybus + Mesostigma clade and most of the streptophyte clades
observed in the best trees inferred from sequence data, it
clustered the chlorophytes belonging to the Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae and Chlorophyceae together in a
highly supported clade and identified a sister-relationship
for the Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae. Similarly, the
relationships observed for the chloroplasts of the red
algae and secondary chloroplasts were well resolved,

revealing a clade uniting the red algal chloroplasts and a
sister clade clustering the secondary chloroplasts.
MP analysis of combined gene order and gene content
data proved to have a better resolving power than the
analyses based on the individual data alone, even though
bootstrap support for some nodes were not significantly
higher (Figure 7). The Chlorokybus + Mesostigma clade was
identified as the most basal divergence of the Streptophyta and the monophyly of all chlorophytes, except
Nephroselmis, was observed. With regards to the red algal
lineage, the red algal chloroplasts formed a strongly supported monophyletic group, whereas the clade clustering
the secondary chloroplasts received low bootstrap support.

Discussion
Mesostigma and Chlorokybus are sister taxa
Our finding that the Chlorokybus chloroplast genome
shows remarkable similarity in gene content and gene

order with its Mesostigma homologue is entirely congruent
with our phylogenetic inferences based on whole chloroplast genome data in indicating a close alliance between
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma. In trees inferred from all data
sets examined in this study, except the gene content data
set, these two green algae form a strongly supported clade
that either branches basally within the Streptophyta or
before the split of the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta. The
evidence for a sister relationship between Mesostigma and
Chlorokybus is particularly compelling considering that
analyses of gene order and sequence data independently
support this relationship.
Because Mesostigma and Chlorokybus differ in cellular
organization and habitat, the sister relationship shared by
these two green algae indicates that important changes
occurred at these levels in the lineage leading to Chlorokybus. More specifically, colonies made up of sarcinoid,
cubical packets of non-flagellated vegetative cells and
occurring in subaerial habitats (mainly on rocky sub-

strata) evolved from unicellular, scaly biflagellates living
exclusively in aquatic habitats. The opposite scenario in
which Mesostigma took origin from a 'Chlorokybus-like'
zoospore evolving into a free-living flagellate can be discarded because it is less parsimonious for the following
three reasons. First, all early-diverging lineages of the
Chlorophyta comprise primarily flagellates; second, given
that Mesostigma has two multi-layered structures in its
flagellar apparatus instead of a single one as in Chlorokybus
and is the only streptophyte featuring an eyespot, the
transformation of Chlorokybus-like zoospores into Mesostigma-like cells would require the gain of an eyespot and
of an additional multi-layered structure; and third, recent
evidence suggests that sarcinoid chlorophytes arose from
unicells on multiple occasions [52]. Considering that Mesostigma reflects a more ancestral condition than Chlorokybus, the sarcinoid cellular organization of Chlorokybus can
no longer be viewed as an intermediate step in the pathway leading to multicellularity [7]; according to the evolutionary scenario reported here, the filamentous cellular
organization displayed by streptophyte green algae

Since the discovery of Chlorokybus by Geitler in 1942 [53],
a range of divergent views have been expressed concerning
its classification. This rare green alga, which Geitler
observed in only two locations in Austria, had been considered to belong to various orders of the Chlorophyceae
until Rogers et al. [54] placed it in the newly erected charophycean order Chlorokybales on the basis of the
ultrastructure of the flagellar apparatus. Vegetative cells of
Chlorokybus can be induced to produce flagellated cells,
also called zoospores. As observed for the flagellated cells
of all charophyceans and Mesostigma, Rogers et al. [54]
found that the body and flagella of the Chlorokybus
zoospores are covered with small square scales and that
the laterally inserted flagella are attached internally to a
multilayered structure. More recently, based on his studies
of the mitotic and cytokinetic patterns of vegetative cells,
Lokhorst et al. [55] proposed to remove Chlorokybus from
the Chlorokybales and merge it in the Klebsormidiales.
In the present study, we could not investigate the relationship of Chlorokybus with members of the Klebsormidiales;
however, it is unlikely that the inclusion of klebsormidialean green algae in our phylogenies would have abolished the specific affinity we uncovered between
Mesostigma and Chlorokybus. Indeed, these two algae
remained robustly clustered when we inferred phylogenies from the chloroplast small and large subunit rRNA
genes of Mesostigma, Chlorokybus, Klebsormidium, Entransia, and 17 other streptophytes (Figure 5). Moreover, the
chlorokybalean and klebsormidialean lineages clearly
represent separate branches in the four-gene tree of Karol
et al. [4].
The Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade occupies the
deepest branch of the Streptophyta
The phylogenies reported here shed new light into the
controversy regarding the position of Mesostigma within
the Viridiplantae. The strong clustering of Mesostigma with
Chlorokybus, an alga that is without any doubt a streptophyte with regards to its cellular organization, provides
unambiguous evidence that Mesostigma belongs to the
Streptophyta. Solid evidence for the positioning of Mesostigma within the Streptophyta also comes from the
observation that trees inferred from chloroplast gene
sequences and gene order data robustly resolve the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade as the deepest branch of the
Streptophyta (Figure 2B). We are confident that these
lines of evidence based on chloroplast genome data reflect
the true organismal relationship of Mesostigma with streptophytes because they are consistent with phylogenetic
and EST data derived from separate cellular compart-

ments. Like the gene phylogenies reported here, a number
of phylogenetic analyses support the affiliation of Mesostigma with streptophytes [4,10-12], and in agreement
with this relationship, recent analyses of EST data from
Mesostigma revealed nuclear genes that appear to be specific to streptophytes [18-20].
It appears that the placement of the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade before the divergence of the Streptophyta and
Chlorophyta in our analyses of the amino acid data set
corresponding to the gene data set is the result of phylogenetic inconsistencies. Although this topology was recovered with moderate bootstrap support by all methods of
phylogenetic inference (Figure 2A), our analyses of data
subsets progressively enriched in slow-evolving characters
suggest that it is incorrect (Figure 3). When about 70% of
the fastest-evolving sites in the original data set were
removed, the placement of the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus
clade within the Streptophyta was favoured with moderate support; however, further exclusion of phylogeneti-

cally informative sites led to the re-emergence of the
topology positioning this clade before the divergence of
the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta. In light of these results
and of the overwhelming evidence supporting the affiliation of the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade with the Streptophyta (see above), we conclude that the phylogenetic
signal in the original amino acid data set was masked by
conflicting (non-phylogenetic) signals.
Current issues in chloroplast phylogenomic studies
Our study provides another example of the importance of
taxon sampling in phylogenomic studies. The use of complete chloroplast genome data in phylogenetic analyses of
green algae and land plants has been implemented as a
powerful alternative to the traditional approach based on
a few genes from many taxa. This whole-genome
approach, however, has been strongly criticized because it
can yield statistically well-supported trees that do not
reflect true organismal relationships as a result of sparse
taxon sampling [47]. The debate on the taxon-dense ver-

mented with several streptophyte and chlorophyte taxa no
longer support Mesostigma as sister to all other green algae
and land plants but rather favour the notion that this alga
occupies the earliest branch of the Streptophyta.

sus character-rich approaches has focused on three high
profile cases of chloroplast phylogenomic studies: the earliest angiosperms [14,34,56-59], the deepest branch of the
land plants [33,60,61] and the most basal divergence of
the Viridiplantae/Streptophyta [4,10,11,13,16,17]. In all
three cases, the tree topologies inferred from chloroplast
genome data have now been shown to be sensitive to
taxon sampling and the addition of taxa has been instrumental in resolving the conflicts between the characterrich and taxon-dense data sets. In the case of the earliest
angiosperms, the addition of basal monocots [35,62] and
magnolids [63] has strengthened the notion that either
Amborella or a clade containing Amborella and the Nymphaeales is sister to all other angiosperms. With regards to
the deepest divergence of the land plants, addition of a
single lineage, the lycophytes, had a dramatic effect on the
resolution of the liverworts, mosses, hornworts and vascular plants, providing support for the liverworts being sister
to all other land plants and the hornworts being sister to
vascular plants [8,37,61]. Finally, as reported in this
study, analyses of chloroplast genome data sets supple-

Aside from sparse taxon sampling, a number of other factors can compromise the performance of phylogenetic
reconstruction methods in chloroplast phylogenomic
studies [14,57]. These include misspecifications of the
evolutionary models employed, compositional heterogeneity of the data sets and evolutionary rate heterogeneity
among different characters and lineages. In this context, it
is worth discussing the utility of the amino acid versus
nucleotide data sets in phylogenetic analyses of green
algae and land plants. Amino acid sequences have frequently been used in the past to infer deep phylogenies
because they avoid problems with saturation of silent substitutions and differential G+C content. However, our
study has clearly shown that the nucleotide data set
greatly outperformed the deduced amino acid data set in
its ability to identify the true phylogenetic position of the
Chlorokybus + Mesostigma clade. Nucleotide data were also
found to be superior to amino acid data in studies aimed
at identifying the deepest divergence of the land plants
[8,61]. These observations suggest that the nucleotide
data sets are not as saturated and biased in base composition as the divergence time of the streptophyte lineages
under study would predict. The exact cause of our failure
to recover the true position of the Chlorokybus + Mesostigma clade with the amino acid data set remains
unclear. One of the possible explanations is that the
empirical model of amino acid replacement (cpREV) used
to reconstruct the evolution of chloroplast proteomes in
ML analyses is not optimal for green algae and land
plants. This model of amino acid substitution was derived
from 45 proteins encoded in the chloroplast genomes of
Cyanophora, a diatom, a red alga, a euglenid and five land
plants [64]. A more realistic model of amino acid substitution derived from a broad sampling of the Viridiplantae
could help to resolve more accurately the deep branches
of this phylum.
Considering the numerous potential problems associated
with tree reconstructions in phylogenomic studies, the
phylogenies inferred in these studies need to be validated
with independent data sets before concluding that they
reflect true organismal relationships. Candidate sources of
independent phylogenetic data are diverse and include
sequence data from other genomes as well as structural
genomic and morphological data.
The shared ancestry of Mesostigma and Chlorokybus
alters our view of chloroplast genome evolution in the
Viridiplantae
The shared streptophyte ancestry of Mesostigma and Chlorokybus reveals that the chloroplast genome of the comPage 13 of 17

BMC Biology 2007, 5:2

mon ancestor of all streptophytes was richer in genes than
previously thought. We infer that this ancestral genome
harboured a minimum of 144 genes, 17 of which are not
found in the Chlorophyta [bioY*, ndhJ, odpB, rbcR*, rpl21,
rpl22, rpl33, rps15, rps16, ssrA*, ycf27*, ycf61*, ycf65*,
ycf66, trnA(ggc)*, trnP(ggg), and trnV(gac), where asterisks denote the genes present only in Mesostigma and/or
Chlorokybus]. The chloroplast genome sequences currently
available for chlorophytes suggest that the gene repertoire
of the common ancestor of these algae was smaller and
included 131 genes, only four of which are not present in
the Streptophyta [rne, rnpB, ycf47, and trnR(ccu)].
Changes in gene content, gene order, and in the size of
intergenic regions mainly account for the differences
between the Mesostigma and Chlorokybus chloroplast
genomes. Seven gene losses [accD, rbcR, ycf27, and
trnR(ccg) in Mesostigma, and bioY, ssrA, and ycf81 in Chlorokybus] and a minimum of 14 inversions distinguish
these two genomes. Compared to their Mesostigma counterparts, the Chlorokybus intergenic regions accumulated a
larger proportion of short dispersed repeats and grew significantly in size, resulting in a gene density comparable
to that observed in the loosely packed genomes of chlorophytes belonging to the Trebouxiophyceae, Ulvophyceae,
and Chlorophyceae. The higher abundance of short dispersed repeats might have provided more opportunities
for recombination between these elements and thus may
explain the higher rate of gene rearrangements observed
in the Chlorokybus lineage [8].

Conclusion
In disclosing a sister relationship between the biflagellate
Mesostigma and the sarcinoid Chlorokybus, our study alters
substantially our concepts regarding the evolution of
streptophyte algae and closes the long-standing debate on
the phylogenetic position of Mesostigma within the
Viridiplantae. The weight of evidence supporting the
notion that streptophyte algae took their origin from a
unicellular freshwater flagellate like Mesostigma has now
become overwhelming and in the future, this hypothesis
should gain further support from phylogenetic analysis of
EST data. In predicting a richer chloroplast gene repertoire
than previously inferred for the common ancestor of all
streptophytes, our study has also a significant impact on
chloroplast genome evolution in the Viridiplantae. The
chloroplast gene repertoires of Mesostigma and Chlorokybus
are the largest known among green algae and include several genes that are present in non-green algae but are
absent from all other green algal cpDNAs investigated
thus far.

Methods
DNA cloning, sequencing and sequence analysis
Chlorokybus atmophyticus was obtained from the
Sammlung von Algenkulturen Göttingen (SAG 48.80)
and grown in medium C [65] under 12 h light/dark cycles.
A random clone library was prepared from a fraction containing both cpDNA and mitochondrial DNA [66]. DNA
templates were obtained with the QIAprep 96 Miniprep
kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada) and sequenced as
described previously [22]. Sequences were edited and
assembled using SEQUENCHER 4.1.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The fully annotated chloroplast genome sequence has been deposited in
[GenBank:DQ422812].

Genes and ORFs were identified as described previously
[36]. Repeated sequences were identified with REPuter
2.74 [67] using the -f (forward), -p (palindromic), and allmax options at minimum lengths of 30 bp and were
classified with REPEATFINDER [68]. Number of copies of
each repeat unit was determined with FINDPATTERNS of
the Wisconsin package version 10.3 (Accelrys, San Diego,
CA, USA). Stem-loop structures and direct repeats were
identified using PALINDROME and ETANDEM in
EMBOSS 2.9.0 [69], respectively. Genomic regions containing non-overlapping repeated elements were identified with RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org
running under the WU-BLAST 2.0 http://blast.wustl.edu
search engine.
Analysis of genome rearrangements
The GRIMM web server [70] was used to infer the number
of gene permutations by inversions in a comparison of
Chlorokybus and Mesostigma cpDNAs as well as in pairwise
comparisons involving either Chlorokybus or Mesostigma
cpDNA with selected IR-containing genomes. For these
analyses, genes within one of the two copies of the IR were
excluded from the data set, and the SSC and LSC + IR
regions were considered as two separate chromosomes.
The SSC and LSC regions were assumed to be independent
from one another because the conserved gene partitioning
pattern displayed by the examined genomes is not consistent with the occurrence of inversions spanning the SSC
and LSC regions.
Phylogenetic inferences from sequence data
GenBank files were retrieved for the 37 green algal/land
plant chloroplast genomes listed in Table 3 and for the
following eight non-green algal chloroplast genomes:
Cyanidioschyzon merolae (GenBank:NC_004799), Cyanidium caldarium (GenBank:NC_001840), Cyanophora paraEmiliania
huxleyi
doxa
(GenBank:NC_001675),
(GenBank:NC_007288), Gracilaria tenuistipitata (GenGuillardia
theta
(GenBank:NC_006137),
Odontella
sinensis
Bank:NC_000926),

(GenBank:NC_001713), Porphyra
purpurea
(GenBank:NC_000925). All GenBank files were revised to
ascertain that all genes in each genome are identified and
annotated using the same gene designations. The chloroplast genome sequences of the euglenid Euglena gracilis
(GenBank:NC_001603) and the chlorarachniophyte
Bigelowiella natans (GenBank:NC_008408) were not sampled in this study because they produce long branches in
phylogenetic analyses that could lead to wrong topologies
[15]. The chloroplasts of these taxa were secondarily
acquired from green algae through independent endosymbiotic events.
A data set of 45 concatenated protein sequences was
derived as described previously [66] from all protein-coding genes common to the above chloroplast genomes,
except rbcL (a gene existing as two distinct forms in red
and green algal lineages and possibly implicated in an
horizontal transfer event [71]). Phylogenetic analyses of
this data set were carried out using ML, MP, ML-distance
and LogDet-distance methods. ML trees were computed
with PHYML 2.4.5 [72] under the cpREV45+Γ+I model of
amino acid substitutions [64] and bootstrap support for
each node was calculated using 100 replicates. MP trees
and ML-distance trees were inferred using PROTPARS and
NEIGHBOR, respectively, in PHYLIP 3.65 [73]. The ML
distances were computed with PUZZLEBOOT 1.03 and
TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 [74] under the cpREV45+Γ+I model.
Robustness of MP and distance trees was assessed by bootstrap percentages after 100 replications. LogDet-distance
trees were computed using PAUP 4.0b10 [75] with the
neighbour-joining search setting. The LogDet-distances
were calculated with LDDist [76], and the proportion of
invariant sites was estimated using the capture-recapture
method of Steel et al. [77]. Confidence of branch points
was estimated by 1,000 bootstrap replications.
A data set containing the gene sequences (first two codon
positions only) coding for the 45 proteins represented in
the amino acid data set was also analyzed using various
methods of phylogenetic inference. This nucleotide data
set was prepared as described previously [8]. ML trees were
inferred using PHYML 2.4.5, whereas MP and ML-distance trees were inferred using PAUP 4.0b10. In MP analysis, trees were searched with the full heuristic option and
optimization was performed by branch-swapping using
tree bisection and reconnection; in ML-distance analysis,
trees were searched with the neighbour-joining search setting. ML and ML-distance trees were constructed under the
GTR+Γ+I model using the parameters estimated by
PHYML. Confidence of branch points was estimated by
100 bootstrap replications in ML and MP analyses and
1,000 bootstrap replications in ML-distance analysis. LogDet-distance trees were computed using PAUP 4.0b10
with the neighbour-joining search setting. The LogDet-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/2

distances were calculated with LDDist, and the proportion
of invariant sites was estimated using the capture-recapture method of Steel et al. [77]. Confidence of branch
points was estimated by 1,000 bootstrap replications.
AU tests [78] were performed with CONSEL 0.1i [79] on
the amino acid and nucleotide data sets to compare the
three alternative positions of the Chlorokybus + Mesostigma
clade. Test trees were constructed as follows: ML phylogenies excluding Chlorokybus and Mesostigma were optimized using PHYML and the abovementioned
evolutionary models, and then the Chlorokybus + Mesostigma clade was added to positions corresponding to the
T1, T2 and T3 topologies. Site-wise log-likelihoods for
each test tree were computed with TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 [74]
using the -wsl options.
The influence of removing increasing proportions of fastevolving sites in the amino acid data set was investigated
as follows. Substitution rates among sites in the data set
were estimated with CODEML for the best trees inferred
by ML and MP, and these rates were averaged for each site.
Phylogenetically informative sites were incrementally
removed by order of decreasing rate of evolution to generate 13 subsets of data. ML and MP analyses of these subsets were performed as described above for the original
amino acid data set. The number of phylogenetically
informative sites supporting unambiguously the placement of the clade uniting Chlorokybus and Mesostigma at
each of the three possible positions in the global phylogeny was identified using MacClade 4.08 [80].
Phylogenetic inferences from structural genomic data
A data set of gene content was prepared from the chloroplast genomes of the 45 taxa listed above by coding the
presence of a gene, the presence of a pseudogene, and the
absence of a gene as Dollo characters with values of 2, 1
and 0, respectively. Gene order in each of these chloroplast genomes was converted to all possible pairs of
signed genes (i.e., taking into account gene polarity) and
a gene order data set was obtained by coding as binary
characters the presence/absence of signed gene pairs in
two or more genomes. The gene content and gene order
data sets were merged together to produce a data set of
combined structural data. Each of the three data sets was
subjected to MP analysis under the Dollo principle (i.e.,
assuming that characters can be lost independently in several evolutionary lineages but cannot be regained [81])
using PAUP 4.0b10. Confidence of branch points was
estimated by 100 bootstrap replications. MacClade 4.08
was used to generate the matrices of gene content and
gene order data, to trace the encoded characters on tree
topologies, and to calculate tree lengths.
