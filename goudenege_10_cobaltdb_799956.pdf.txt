CoBaltDB: Complete bacterial and archaeal
orfeomes subcellular localization database
and associated resources

Abstract
Background: The functions of proteins are strongly related to their localization in cell compartments (for example
the cytoplasm or membranes) but the experimental determination of the sub-cellular localization of proteomes is
laborious and expensive. A fast and low-cost alternative approach is in silico prediction, based on features of the
protein primary sequences. However, biologists are confronted with a very large number of computational tools
that use different methods that address various localization features with diverse specificities and sensitivities. As a
result, exploiting these computer resources to predict protein localization accurately involves querying all tools and
comparing every prediction output; this is a painstaking task. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive database,
called CoBaltDB, that gathers all prediction outputs concerning complete prokaryotic proteomes.
Description: The current version of CoBaltDB integrates the results of 43 localization predictors for 784 complete
bacterial and archaeal proteomes (2.548.292 proteins in total). CoBaltDB supplies a simple user-friendly interface
for retrieving and exploring relevant information about predicted features (such as signal peptide cleavage sites
and transmembrane segments). Data are organized into three work-sets (”specialized tools“, “meta-tools“ and
“additional tools“). The database can be queried using the organism name, a locus tag or a list of locus tags and
may be browsed using numerous graphical and text displays.
Conclusions: With its new functionalities, CoBaltDB is a novel powerful platform that provides easy access to the
results of multiple localization tools and support for predicting prokaryotic protein localizations with higher
confidence than previously possible. CoBaltDB is available at http://www.umr6026.univ-rennes1.fr/english/home/
research/basic/software/cobalten.

Background
Determining the subcellular localization of proteins is
essential for the functional annotation of proteomes
[1,2]. Bacterial proteins can exist in soluble (i.e free)
forms in cellular spaces (cytoplasm in both monoderm
and diderm bacteria and periplasm in diderms),
anchored to membranes (cytoplasm membrane in
monoderms, inner- or outer membrane in diderms) or
cell wall (in monoderms). They can also be released into
the extracellular environment or directly translocated
into host cells [3]. All protein synthesis takes place in
the cytoplasm, so all non-cytoplasmic proteins must
pass through one or two lipid bilayers by a mechanism

commonly called “secretion”. Protein secretion is
involved in various processes including plant-microbe
interactions [4,5]), biofilm formation [6,7] and virulence
of plant and human pathogens [8-10]. Two main systems are involved in protein translocation across the
cytoplasmic membrane, namely the essential and universal Sec (Secretion) pathway and the Tat (Twin-arginine
translocation) pathway found in some prokaryotes
(monoderms and diderms) and eukaryotes alike [11-16].
The Sec machinery recognizes an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and translocates unfolded proteins
[12], whereas the Tat machinery recognizes a basic-rich
N-terminal motif (SRR-x-FLK) and transports fully
folded proteins [13,14]). In addition to these systems,
diderm bacteria have six further systems that secrete
proteins using a contiguous channel spanning the two

membranes (T1SS, [17,18], T3SS, T4SS and T6SS
[19-24]) or in two steps, the first being Sec- or Tatdependent export into the periplasmic and the second
being translocation across the outer membrane (T2SS,
[25-27] and T5SS, [28,29]). Other diderm protein secretion systems exist: they include the chaperone-usher system (CU or T7SS, [30,31]) and the extracellular
nucleation-precipitation mechanism (ENP or T8SS,
[32]). It is worth mentioning that the terminology T7SS
has also been proposed to describe a completely different protein secretion system, namely the ESAT-6 protein secretion (ESX) in Mycobacteria, now considered as
diderm bacteria [33]. Beside Sec and Tat pathways,
monoderm bacteria have additional secretion systems
for protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, namely the flagella export apparatus (FEA [34]),
the fimbrilin-protein exporter (FPE, [35,36]) and the
WXG100 secretion system (Wss, [37,38]).
Establishing whole proteome subcellular localization
by biochemical experiments is possible but arduous,
time consuming and expensive. Data concerning predicted proteins (from whole genome sequences) is continuously increasing. High-throughput in silico analysis
is required for fast and accurate prediction of additional
attributes based solely on their amino acid sequences.
There are large numbers of global (that yield final localization) and specialized (that predict features) tools for
computer-assisted prediction of protein localizations.
Most specialized tools tend to detect the presence of Nterminal signal peptides (SP). Prediction of Sec-sorting
signals has a long history as the first methods, based on
weight matrices, were published about fifteen years ago
[39-41]. Numerous machine learning-based methods are
now available [42-50]. The distinction between Tat- and
Sec- sorting signals is essentially based on the recognition, in the n/h regions edge, of the twin-arginine motif
[51], using regular expressions combined with hydrophobicity measures [52] or machine learning [53]. Prelipoproteins SP have the same n- and h- regions as Sec
SP but contain, in the c-region, a well-conserved lipobox
[54], recognized for cleavage by the type II signal peptidase [55]. Lipoprotein prediction tools use regular
expression patterns to detect this lipobox [56,57], combined with Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [58] or
Neural Networks (NN) [59]. Other attributes predicted
by specialized tools are a-helices and b-barrel transmembrane segments. In 1982, Kyte and Doolittle proposed a hydropathy-based method to predict
transmembrane (TM) helices in a protein sequence.
This approach was enhanced by combining discriminant
analysis [60], hydrophobicity scales [61-63] amino acid
properties [64,65]. Complex algorithms are also available
and employ statistics [66], multiple sequence alignments
[67] and machine learning approaches [68-73]. b-barrel

segments, embedded in outer membrane proteins, are
harder to predict than a-helical segments, mostly
because they are shorter; nevertheless, many methods
are available based on similar strategies [74-87].
This plethora of protein localization predictors and
databases [88-91] constitutes an important resource but
requires time and expertise for efficient exploitation.
Some of the tools require computing skills, as they have
to be locally installed; others are difficult to use (numerous parameters) or to interpret (large quantities of graphics and output data). Web tools are disseminated and
need numerous manual requests. Additionally, researchers have to decide which of these numerous tools are
the most pertinent for their purposes, and selection is
problematic without appropriate training sets. Recent
work shows that the best strategy for exploiting the various tools is to compare them [92-94].
Here, we describe CoBaltDB, the first public database
that displays the results obtained by 43 localization predictor tools for 776 complete prokaryotic proteomes.
CoBaltDB will help microbiologists explore and analyze
subcellular localization predictions for all proteins predicted from a complete genome; it should thereby facilitate and enhance the understanding of protein function.

Construction and content
Data sources

The major challenge for CoBaltDB is to collect and integrate into a centralized open-access reference database,
non-redundant subcellular prediction features for complete prokaryotic orfeomes. Our initial dataset contained
784 complete genomes (731 bacteria and 53 Archaea),
downloaded with all plasmids and chromosomes (1468
replicons in total), from the NCBI ftp server ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria in mid-December 2008.
This dataset contains 2,548,292 predicted non-redundant proteins (Additional file 1).
The CoBaltDB database was designed to associate
results from disconnected resources. It contains three
main types of data: i) CoBaltDB pre-computed prediction using 23 feature-based localization tools (Table 1),
ii) CoBaltDB pre-computed prediction obtained using 5
localization meta-tools (Table 2) and iii) data collected
from 20 public databases with both predicted and
experimentally determined subcellular protein localizations (Table 3).
These data were organized in five “boxes“ with regard
to the features predicted: three boxes correspond to signal peptide detection (Lipoprotein, Tat- and Sec- dependent targeting signals); one box for the prediction of
alpha-transmembrane segments (TM-Box); and one box,
only available for diderms (Gram-negatives), for outer
membrane localization through prediction of betabarrels.

Data generation

There is a great diversity of web and stand-alone
resources for the prediction of protein subcellular location. We retrieved and tested 99 currently (in 2009)
available specialized and global tools (software
resources) that use various amino acid features and
diverse methods: algorithms, HMM, NN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), software suites and others), to predict protein subcellular localization (Additional file 2).
All tools were evaluated: some are included in
CoBaltDB, some may be launched directly from the
platform (Table 4), and others were excluded because of
redundancy or processing reasons or both (Table 5).
Some tools are specific to Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. Many prediction methods applicable to
both Gram categories have different parameters for the

two groups of bacteria. For these reasons, each NCBI
complete bacterial and archaeal genome implemented in
CoBaltDB was registered as “monoderm” or “diderm”,
on the basis of information in the literature and phylogeny (Additional file 3). Monoderms and diderms were
considered as Gram-negative and Gram-positive, respectively. All archaea were classified as monoderm prokaryotes since their cells are bounded by a single cell
membrane and possess a cell envelope [3,95]. An exception was made for Ignicoccus hospitalis as it owns an
outer sheath resembling the outer membrane of gramnegative bacteria [96].
Currently, CoBaltDB contains pre-computed results
obtained with 48 tools and databases, and additionally
provides pre-filled access to 50 publicly available tools
that could not be pre-computed or that provide new

information (tools dedicated to a special phylum, consensus tools or tools predicting proteins secreted via
other pathways). The data pre-computing process is illustrated in Figure 1; web-based and stand-alone tools
were used separately. Web-based localization prediction
tools were requested via a Web automat, a python automatic submission workflow using both “httplib” and
“urllib” libraries. A different script was created for each
tool. For web-tools with no equivalent (such as “TatP”
for Tat-BOX and “LIPO” for Lipoprotein-BOX) and
incompatible with automatic requests, we collected
results manually. CoBaltDB also provides a platform
with automatically pre-filled forms for additional submissions to a selection of fifty recent or specific web
tools (Table 4). The stand-alone tools were installed on
a Unix platform (unique common compatible platform)
and included in a global python pipeline with the HTTP
request scripts. We selected information from a up-todate collection of 20 databases and integrated this data
within CoBaltDB; these databases were retrieved by simple downloading or creating an appropriate script which
navigates on the web databases to collect all protein
information. The global python pipeline used multithreading to speed up the pre-computation of the 784
proteomes.
Database Creation and Architecture

For each protein, every output collected (a HTML page
for web tools and a text file for standalone applications)

was parsed and selected items were stored in a particular format: binary “marshal” files. The object structure
obtained by parsing tool output was directly saved into
a marshal file, allowing a quick and easy opening by
directly restoring the initial parsing object. Another
script then creates the CoBaltDB repository, by reading
and analysing all marshal files to generate a specific formatted file (”.cbt”) for each replicon. These files contain
all the required protein information and a simplified
representation of the tools’ results. Some initialization
files containing information about phylogeny or genome
features are also used.
The repository is used by the Graphical User Interface
(GUI) to display CoBaltDB information. For raw data
from tools, the GUI accesses the marshal file directory.
Accessing the CoBaltDB Repository and Raw Data

The CoBaltDB platform has been developed as a clientserver application. The server is installed at the Genouest Bioinformatics platform http://www.genouest.org/?
lang=en. The client is a Java application that needs to
be locally downloaded by the users. Queries are submitted to the server-side CoBaltDB repository using a
locally installed client GUI that provides tabular and
graphical representations of the data. The repository is
accessed through SOAP-based web services (Simple
Object Access Protocol), implemented in Java 5 using
the Apache Axis 1.4 toolkit and deployed on the servlet
engine Tomcat 5.5.20. CoBaltDB integrates: an

Figure 1 A schematic view of the CoBaltDB workflow. CoBaltDB integrates the results of 43 localization predictors for 784 complete bacterial
and archaeal proteomes. Each complete NCBI prokaryotic genome implemented in CoBaltDB was classified as: archaea, or monoderm or diderm
bacteria. 101 protein subcellular location predictors were evaluated and few were rejected. Selected tools were classified as: feature localization
tools (Specialized), localization meta-tools (Global) or databases. The data recovery process was performed manually or via a Web automat using
a python automatic submission workflow for both stand-alone and web-based tools. Databases were downloaded. For each protein, ouptuts
collected were parsed and selected items were stored in particular CoBaltDB formatted files (.cbt). The parsing pipeline creates one “.cbt” file per
replicon to compose the final CoBaltDB repository. The client CoBaltDB Graphical User Interface communicates with the server-side repository via
web services to provide graphical and tabular representations of the results.

initialization web service (that returns the current list of
genomes supported); two repository web services that
allow querying the database either by specifying a replicon or a list of locus tags; and a raw data web service
that retrieves all recorded raw data generated by a given
tool for the specified locus tag.

Utility
Running CoBaltDB

Our goal was to build an open-access reference database
providing access to protein localization predictions.
CoBaltDB was designed to centralize different types of
data and to interface them so as to help researchers
rapidly analyse and develop hypotheses concerning the
subcellular distribution of particular protein(s) or a
given proteome. This data management allows comparative evaluation of the output of each tool and database
and thus straightforward identification of inaccurate or
conflicting predictions.
We developed a user-friendly CoBaltDB GUI as a Java
5 client application using NetBeans 5.5.1 IDE. It presents four tabs that perform specific tasks: the “input”
tab (Figure 2) allows selecting the organism whose proteome localizations will be presented, using organism
name completion or through an alphabetical list. Alternatively, users may also enter a subset of proteins, specified by their locus tags. The “Specialized tools” tab
(Figure 3) supplies a table showing, for each protein

Page 7 of 19

identified by its locus tag or protein identifier, some
annotation information such as its gene name, description and links to the corresponding NCBI and KEGG
web pages. Clicking on a “locus tag” opens a navigator
window with the related KEGG link, and clicking on a
“protein Id” opens the corresponding NCBI entry web
page. The table shows, for each protein and for each
feature box (Tat, Sec, Lipo, aTMB, bBarrel), a heat map
(white/blue) representing the percentage of tools predicting the truth/presence of the corresponding localization feature in the protein considered. Clicking on the
heat map opens a new window that shows the raw data
generated by each tool of the considered feature box,
thus allowing the investigator to access the tool-specific
information they are used to. The predictions of related
feature databases are given next to the corresponding
heat-map. The proteins which are referred to by the
databases implemented in CobaltDB as having an
experimentally determined localization appear with a
yellow background colour. This representation enables
the user to observe graphically the distribution of tools
predicting each type of feature. The “meta-tools” tab
(Figure 4) provides the predictions given by multi-modular prediction software (meta-tools or global databases)

description. Both tables may be sorted with respect to
any column, i.e. in alphanumerical order for the locus
tags, protein identifiers, annotation descriptions and
localization predictions, or in numerical order for the
percentages. This makes it straightforward to identify all
proteins with particular combinations of localization features. Both tables may be saved as Excel files. Finally,
the CoBaltDB “additional tools” tab (Figure 5) enables
queries to be submitted to a set of 50 additional tools
by pre-filling the selected forms with the selected protein sequence and Gram information whenever appropriate. For this use, the investigator might have to enter
additional parameters.
Finally, for each protein, all results were summarized
in a synopsis (Figure 6); the synopsis presents the results
generated by all the tools in a unified manner, and
includes a summary of all predicted cleavage sites and
membrane domains. This “standardized” form thus provides all relevant information and lets the investigators

establish their own hypotheses and conclusions. This
form may be saved as a .pdf file (Figure 6). Examples of
using the CoBaltDB synopsis are provided below in the
second case study.
Selected CoBaltDB uses

We propose to illustrate briefly some possible uses of
CoBaltDB.
1-Using CoBaltDB to compare subcellular prediction tools
and databases

The various bioinformatic approaches developed for
computational determination of protein subcellular localization exhibit differences in sensitivity and specificity;
these differences are mainly the consequences of the
types of sequences used as training models (diderms,
monoderms, Archaea) and of the methods applied (regular expressions, machine learning or others). By interfacing the results from most of the reliable predictions
tools, CoBaltDB provides immediate comparisons and
constitutes an accurate and high-performance resource
to identify and characterize candidate “non-cytoplasmic”
proteins. As an example, using CoBaltDB to analyse the
82 proteins that compose the experimentally confirmed

Goudenège et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:88

Figure 4 The CoBaltDB Meta-Tools interface. The “meta-tools” panel presents the CoBaltDB-computed results for multi-modular prediction
software that uses various techniques to directly predict 3 to 5 subcellular localizations for proteins in mono- and/or diderm bacteria.

“Lipoproteome” of E. coli K-12 [97] shows that 72 are
correctly predicted by the three precomputed tools
(LipoP [59], DOLOP [57] and LIPO [56]), and that the
other 10 are only identified by two of the three tools
(Additional file 4A). Eight of these lipoproteins were not
detected by DOLOP, because the regular expression pattern allowing detection of the lipidation sequence ([LVI]
[ASTVI] [GAS] [C] lipobox) is too stringent (Additional
file 4B). By comparison, the PROSITE lipobox pattern
(PS00013/PDOC00013) is more permissive ([DERK](6)[LIVMFWSTAG] (2)- [LIVMFYSTAGCQ]- [AGS]-C).
This example demonstrates that using a single tool may
result in errors and suggests that the best approach is to
combine the various “features-based” methods available
and compare their findings. This view also applies to
meta-tools predictors. E. coli K12 lipoproteins can be
found anchored to the inner or the outer membrane
through attached lipid, but some of them are periplasmic (Additional file 4A). The comparison of in silico
subcellular localization assignments with experimental
findings clearly indicates that all meta-tools require significant improvements in accuracy and precision, that

none should be used to the exclusion of the others. It
also appears that analysis with specialized tools, organized on a “one feature at a time” basis (Lipo SPs, TAT
SPs ...), most reliably gives predictions consistent with
experimental data. For this purpose, CoBaltDB is a
unique and innovative resource.
2-Using CoBaltDB to analyse protein(s) and a proteome

One valuable property of CoBaldDB is to recapitulate all
pre-computed predictions in a unique A4-formated
synopsis. This summary is very helpful for assessing
computational data such as the variation and frequency
in the predictions of signal peptide cleavage sites: such
predictions are sometimes significantly consistent, but
often are not in agreement with each other (Figure 7A).
However, correct identification of signal peptide cleavage sites is essential in many situations, especially for
producing secreted recombinant proteins.
The CoBaltDB synopsis could also be used to discriminate between SignalPeptidaseII- and SignalPeptidaseI-cleaved signals and between SPs and N-terminal
transmembrane helices. Indeed, most localization predictors have difficulties distinguishing between type I

pre-filling selected forms with selected sequence and Gram information as appropriate.

and type II signal peptidase cleavages. CoBaltDB can
be exploited in an interesting way to benchmark this
prediction by displaying all cleavage site predictions in
a “decreasing sensitivity” arrangement (SpII then Tatdependant SPI then Sec-SPI). By considering lipoprotein datasets from different organisms, we evidenced
two principal profiles (Figure 7B) and found that all
experimentally validated lipoproteins score 100% (all
tools give the same prediction) or 66% in the
CoBaltDB LIPO column (see explanation in the paragraph above). In addition, in almost all of the examined cases, tools dedicated to Twin-arginine SP
detection do not identify SpII-dependent SP, whereas
the Sec-SP predictors detect both Sec and Tat-type I
as well as type II signal-anchor sequences.
These observations allow us to propose, for our data
set, thresholds for each box: as previously illustrated,
lipoproteins have score > 66% in the LIPO prediction
box; Tat-secreted proteins have 0% in the LIPO box and
100% for the two TAT-dedicated tools; Sec-secreted
proteins have 33% in the LIPO Box (due to the fact that
LipoP detects both SpI and SpII [59]), 0% in the TATtools, and > 80% in SEC-specialized tools. Rules of this

type can be used to check entire proteomes for evaluation of the different secretomes as illustrated in the
following case studies.
3-Using CoBaltDB to compare proteomes

Using CoBaltDB and the thresholds described above, we
can compare the predicted lipoproteomes (Figure 8A) of
the three completely sequenced substrains of E. coli
K12: MG1655 and W3110 (both derived from W1485
approximately 40 years ago [98]), and DH10B which
was constructed by a series of genetic manipulations
[99]. Each of these three substrains encode 89 lipoproteins found in both other substrains (Additional file 4).
Four additional lipoproteins are detected in DH10B
(BorD, CusC, RlpA and RzoD) and are second copies
lipoprotein genes, present in the 113-kb tandemly
repeated region of the chromosome (Figure 8B, coordinates 514341 to 627601, [99]), and strain DH10B contains one gene encoding the Rz1 proline-rich lipoprotein
from bacteriophage lambda absent from the two other
substrains. Lipoprotein YghJ, that shares 64% homology
with V. cholerae virulence-associated accessory colonization factor AcfD [100], is absent from the DH10B genome annotation. However, comparative genomic analysis

shows that a yghJ locus could be annotated in this strain
but corresponds to a pseudogene caused by a frameshift
event (Figure 8C). YfbK was also overlooked in the
DH10B annotation process but in this case, the gene is
intact. Finally, differences between lipoprotein prediction
results concerning YafY, YfiM and YmbA are due to
erroneous N-terminus predictions. YafY in DH10B was
predicted to be a lipoprotein due to the N-terminal 17
aa-long type II signal peptide and was published as a
new inner membrane lipoprotein [101]. In substrains
MG1655 and WS3110, the original annotation fused the
yafY loci with its upstream pseudogene ykfK (137 N-

terminal aa longer). The presumed start codons of YfiM
and YmbA in MG1655 were recently changed by adding
17 (lrilfvcsllllsgcsh) and 5 (mkkwl) N-terminal amino
acids, respectively (PMC1325200). These modifications
substantially affect the prediction of their subcellular
localization. Inspection of the genomic sequences of the
two other substrains leads to equivalent changes such
that YfiM and YmbA in all three substrains are now
predicted to be lipoproteins. In conclusion, using
CoBaltDB to compare lipoproteomes between substrains, we were able to detect genomic events as well as
“annotation” errors. After correction, we can conclude

that the three E. coli K12 substrains have 93 lipoproteins
in common; that one locus whose function is related to
virulence has been transformed into a pseudogene in
DH10B; and that DH10B contains five additional
lipoproteins due to duplication events and to the presence of prophages absent from the other two substrains
(Figure 8D).
4-Using CoBaltDB to improve the classification of
orthologous and paralogous proteins

Protein function is generally related to its subcellular
compartment, so orthologous proteins are expected, in
most cases, to be in the same subcellular location. Consequently, inconsistencies of location predictions
between orthologs potentially indicate distinct functional
subclasses. Thus, CobaltDB can be used to help improve
the functional annotation of orthologous proteins by
adding the subcellular localization dimension. As an

example, OxyGene, an anchor-based database of the
ROS-RNS (Reactive Oxygen-Nitrogen species) detoxification subsystems for 664 complete bacterial and
archaeal genomes, includes 37 detoxicifation enzyme
subclasses [102]. Analysis of CoBaltDB subcellular
localization information suggested the existence of additional subclasses. For example, 1-cystein peroxiredoxin,
PRX_BCPs (bacterioferritin comigratory protein homologs), can be sub-divided into two new subclasses by
distinguishing the secreted from the non-secreted forms
(Figure 9a). Differences in the location between orthologous proteins are suggestive of functional diversity, and
this is important for predictions of phenotype from the
genotype.
CoBaltDB is a very useful tool for the comparison of
paralogous proteins. For example, quantitative and
qualitative analysis of superoxide anion detoxification

subsystems using the OxyGene platform identified three
iron-manganese Superoxide dismutase (SOD_FMN) in
Agrobacterium tumefaciens but only one SOD_FMN
and one copper-zinc SOD (SOD_CUZ) in Sinorhizobium
meliloti. The number of paralogs and the class of orthologs thus differ between these two closely related genus.
However, adding the subcellular localization dimension
reveals that both species have machinery to detoxify
superoxide anions in both the periplasm and cytoplasm:
both one of the three SOD_FMN of A. tumefaciens and
the SOD_CUZ of S. meliloti are secreted (Figure 9b).
CoBaltDB thus helps explain the difference suggested by

OxyGene with respect to the ability of the two species
to detoxify superoxide.

Discussion
CobaltDB allows biologists to improve their prediction of
the subcellular localization of a protein by letting them
compare the results of tools based on different methods
and bringing complementary information. To facilitate the
correct interpretation of the results, biologists have to
keep in mind the limitations of the tools especially regarding the methodological strategies employed and the training sets used [93]. For example, most specialized tools

tend to detect the presence of N-terminal signal peptides
and predict cleavage sites. However the absence of an
N-terminal signal peptide does not systematically indicate
that the protein is not secreted. Some proteins that are
translocated via the Sec system might not necessarily exhibit an N-terminal signal peptide, such as the SodA protein
of M. tuberculosis, which is dependent on SecA2 for secretion and lacks a classical signal sequence for protein
export [103]. Furthermore, there is no systematic cleavage
of the N-terminal signal peptide as it can serve as a cytoplasmic membrane anchor [104,105]. Another example:
although type II and type V secretion systems generally
require the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide in
order to utilise the sec pathway for translocation from
cytoplasm to periplasm, type I and type III (and usually
also type IV) systems can secrete a protein without any
such signal [28,106]. Other proteins, such as Yop proteins
exported by the Yersinia TTS system, have no classical
sec-dependent signal sequences; however the information
required to direct these proteins into the TTS pathway is
contained within the N-terminal coding region of each
gene [107-109].
Some challenges still need to be addressed in the
prediction of the subcellular localization of proteins. For

instance, bioinformatics has recently focussed on predicting proteins secreted via other pathways [110,111].

Conclusion
We have developed CoBaltDB, the first friendly interfaced database that compiles a large number of in silico
subcellular predictions concerning whole bacterial and
archaeal proteomes. Currently, CoBaltDB allows fast
access to precomputed localizations for 2,548,292
proteins in 784 proteomes. It allows combined management of the predictions of 75 feature tools and 24 global
tools and databases. New specialised prediction tools,
algorithms and methods are continuously released,
so CoBaltDB was designed to have the flexibility to
facilitate inclusion of new tools or databases as required.
In general, our analysis indicates that both feature-based
and general localization tools and databases have perform
diversely in terms of specificity and sensitivity; the diversity
arises mainly from the different sets of proteins used during the training process and from the limitations of the
mathematical and statistical methodologies applied. In all
our analyses with CoBaltDB, it became clear that that the
combination and comparative analysis of results of heterogeneous tools improved the computational predictions,

Goudenège et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:88
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/88

and contributed to identifying the limitations of each tool.
Therefore, CoBaltDB can serve as a reference resource to
facilitate interpretation of results and to provide a benchmark for accurate and effective in silico predictions of the
subcellular localization of proteins. We hope that it will
make a significant contribution to the exploitation of in
silico subcellular localization predictions as users can easily
create small datasets and determine their own thresholds
for each predicted feature (type I or II SPs for example) or
proteome. This is very important, as constructing an
exhaustive “experimentally validated protein location”
dataset is a time-consuming process –including identifying
and reading all relevant papers– and as experimental findings about some subcellular locations are very limited.
