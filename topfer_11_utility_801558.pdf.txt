Utility of arsenic-treated bird skins for DNA
extraction
Till Töpfer1,2*, Anita Gamauf3,4 and Elisabeth Haring4,5

Abstract
Background: Natural history museums receive a rapidly growing number of requests for tissue samples from
preserved specimens for DNA-based studies. Traditionally, dried vertebrate specimens were treated with arsenic
because of its toxicity and insect-repellent effect. Arsenic has negative effects on in vivo DNA repair enzymes and
consequently may inhibit PCR performance. In bird collections, foot pad samples are often requested since the feet
were not regularly treated with arsenic and because they are assumed to provide substantial amounts of DNA.
However, the actual influence of arsenic on DNA analyses has never been tested.
Findings: PCR success of both foot pad and body skin samples was significantly lower in arsenic-treated samples.
In general, foot pads performed better than body skin samples. Moreover, PCR success depends on collection date
in which younger samples yielded better results. While the addition of arsenic solution to the PCR mixture had a
clear negative effect on PCR performance after the threshold of 5.4 μg/μl, such high doses of arsenic are highly
unlikely to occur in dried zoological specimens.
Conclusions: While lower PCR success in older samples might be due to age effects and/or DNA damage through
arsenic treatment, our results show no inhibiting effect on DNA polymerase. We assume that DNA degradation
proceeds more rapidly in thin tissue layers with low cell numbers that are susceptible to external abiotic influences.
In contrast, in thicker parts of a specimen, such as foot pads, the outermost horny skin may act as an additional
barrier. Since foot pads often performed better than body skin samples, the intention to preserve morphologically
important structures of a specimen still conflicts with the aim to obtain optimal PCR success. Thus, body skin
samples from recently collected specimens should be considered as alternative sources of DNA.

Background
Currently, natural history museums all over the world
receive a rapidly growing number of requests for tissue
samples from preserved specimens for DNA-based examinations. The demand for extensive taxon sampling,
coupled with the ease of applying molecular techniques,
encourages many researchers to analyse specimens kept
in museum collections. Thus, museum specimens, in parallel with blood and tissue collections, are of growing
importance for molecular studies, particularly when rare
or extinct species are required for phylogenetic analysis
or when comparison between extant and historical populations is the focus [1-8]. However, the majority of preserved specimens have not been collected for molecular

analyses and serve as valuable vouchers for various other
studies. Tissue sampling results in irreversible and at
least partial physical damage to the specimens [8,9], and
such demand is in disagreement with the curatorial duty
to preserve specimens in the best possible condition.
Therefore, it is desirable to develop sampling strategies
that reduce destructive effects to a minimum whilst
accommodating the needs of molecular studies.
For the purpose of DNA analysis, the majority of preserved avian specimens are sampled by cutting off foot
(or toe) pads or part of them [10]. As foot pads may
provide other useful insight, e.g. into patterns of ecomorphological adaptations (e.g. [11]), such sampling
causes substantial structural loss, especially in small
birds [8]. In contrast, body skin may allow repeated invisible sampling due to its greater availability and because
the feathers conceal the sampled area. The medial area
where the bird has been opened during preparation is

easily accessible and therefore most convenient for sampling purposes. However, foot pad samples are frequently requested because it is assumed that they
provide substantial amounts of DNA. This may be considered necessary for old specimens containing DNA
that is presumably degraded [10]. Moreover, unlike the
remaining parts of bird skins, the feet were not always
treated with arsenic.
Arsenic is commonly used to preserve dried vertebrate
specimens because of its toxicity to pest insects (overview in [12]). Usually, a 10% arsenic solution is brushed
on the inside of the skin during preparation and/or is
distributed as a powder in the plumage or fur. Because
of health concerns, the use of arsenic has been banned
in many vertebrate collections [12]. In old specimens,
the existing arsenic concentration may vary to an
unknown extent and taxidermists did not routinely
document whether they had used arsenic.
Since arsenic has a deleterious effect on in vivo DNA
repair enzymes [13-17], it may inhibit PCR performance.
Thus, as the feet were not normally treated with arsenic,
foot pad samples were considered reliable sources of
DNA negating the potential negative effects on PCR
[10]. However, the actual influence of arsenic on PCR
has never been specifically investigated.
In this study, we analyse the applicability of sampling
body skin instead of foot pads in order to avoid destructive sampling of the feet, thus preserving them for subsequent studies. We compare PCR success of body skin
samples with foot pad samples. Furthermore, we examine the actual potential of arsenic as a PCR inhibitor.
Firstly, in a comparative approach, we investigate possible differences in PCR success between arsenic-treated
and untreated samples. Secondly, we test the impact of
arsenic on PCR success experimentally.

Materials and methods
We analysed 64 individual study skins of the European
Jay Garrulus glandarius from the ornithological collection of the Natural History Museum Vienna (Table 1).
In this collection, arsenic was used for specimen preservation until 1971 after which it was replaced by Eulan
(chlorphenylid). Thus we preferentially included individuals that have been collected within a narrow timescale
before and after the 1971-timeline. To control for
potential effects of specimen age, we included additional,
particularly old specimens to check for a potential age
bias in our interpretation. In order to cover a range of
collection dates it was necessary to sample different subspecies of G. glandarius.
Specimens were placed on a clean sheet of paper and
sampled individually. Both a foot pad and a skin sample
from the bird’s belly were taken from each specimen
using sterile scalpels and forceps. Both paper and

fresh tissue material and were used as templates for PCR control and arsenic
concentration experiments.

equipment was exchanged after sampling a specimen.
To obtain skin samples, the body plumage of the ventral
surface was separated. A piece of skin was cut off from
an unfeathered area of the belly, preferably where the
bird was opened during preparation. Foot pad samples
were cut from the fleshy ventral parts of the feet and
toes. We tried to compensate for the compactness of
foot pads compared to the sheet-like skin patches by
taking slightly larger skin pieces: the size of a foot pad
sample was ~ 2 × 2 mm, integument samples measured
~ 3 × 3 mm. Extracted DNA of two fresh tissue samples
(Gglagla6 and Gglagla8, Table 1) was used as a positive
control.
DNA extraction was performed using the Agowa sbeadex forensic kit (Agowa GmbH, Berlin), following the
standard protocol except incubation time and elution
volume: Incubation of body skin samples was about 12
to 16 hours, for foot pad samples up to 24 hours
depending on visible progress of tissue digestion. The
final elution volume of DNA solution was 20 μl. Polymerase chain reaction of a partial sequence of the mitochondrial control region (CR) was performed in 25 μl
final reaction volume containing 3.0 μl template DNA,
applying the following conditions: 3 min of pre-denaturation at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation

for 30 sec at 94°C; primer annealing for 30 sec at 58°C;
elongation for 40 sec at 72°C, and final elongation for
10 min at 72°C before cooling to 4°C. We used four
PCR primers (Table 2). By combining the forward primer with each of the three reverse primers three PCR
products of different lengths could be amplified (lengths
referring to Gglagla17): CR-Cor14+/Phe-Cor- (600 bp),
CR-Cor14+/CR-Cor13-/(330 bp), and CR-Cor14+/CRCor12- (192 bp). Amplification products were analysed
by electrophoresis in 1.0% agarose gels before sequencing. If negative, individual PCRs were repeated two
more times before being considered as negative. The
authenticity of the respective DNA sequences was determined by comparison to G. glandarius reference
sequences taken from [18]. All 600 bp PCR fragments
were purified from agarose gels using the Qiaquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned (TOPO TA Cloning
Kit, Invitrogen) prior to sequencing. Sequencing of
cloned PCR products (both strands) was performed with
universal M13 primers by AGOWA.
Influence of arsenic on PCR performance

In an additional experiment the influence of arsenic on
PCR performance was tested by adding stepwise increasing concentrations of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) solution to the PCR mixture (resulting final concentrations
ranged from 4.6 - 6 μg/μl). We took the identical
sodium arsenite as used by the NHM’s taxidermists,
who usually applied a ~10% arsenic solution to the
skins, in order to repeat the most common specimen
treatment at many natural history museums authentically. DNA of a fresh tissue sample (Gglagla8) served as
template. Primers CR-Cor14+ and CR-Cor13- (330 bp)
were used and PCR cycle conditions were identical to
the other samples.
The data interpretation is based on multivariate statistics. As the data set is composed by non-intervalscaled and not independent variables, logistic regression with repeated measurements (Wald test) was
used. Wald test is a parametric statistical test in which
the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of
interest is compared with the proposed value assuming
their difference to be approximately normally distributed. The square of the difference is compared to a chisquared distribution [19]. All calculations were done
using SPSS 17.0.

Results
In general, PCR amplification yielded clear bands of the
expected fragment sizes. Sequencing of PCR products
confirmed all sequences to be authentic mt CR amplicons, either identical or very similar to the published G.
glandarius references.
PCR success from arsenic-treated and untreated foot pad
and body skin samples

We evaluated PCR success as a general measure of
usability of tissue samples considering two aspects: (1)
presence/absence of PCR product in general, (2) maximum amplicon length. An overview is given in Table 3.
Regarding overall PCR success (Figure 1), none of the
samples was completely negative.
All samples irrespective of collection time and tissue
type were successful for the 192 bp-amplicon. With
respect to the larger amplicons (330 bp, 600 bp) skin
and foot pad samples differed considerably (Wald c2 =
19.024, P < 0.001). This was also tested separately for
arsenic-treated and untreated samples. In both cases
foot pad samples performed better (before 1971: Wald
c2 = 26.665, P < 0.001; after 1971: Wald c2 = 4.382; P =
0.036). Furthermore, general PCR success was significantly influenced by the age of the sample, in which
younger samples performed better. This was tested separately for the two time periods (before 1971: Wald c2 =
6.347, P = 0.012; after 1971: Wald c 2 = 14.709; P <
0.001) as well as for the whole sample (Wald c 2 =
22.896, P < 0.001). Finally, the maximum amplicon
length obtained depended significantly on sample age
(before 1971: Wald c2 = 30.754, P < 0.001; after 1971:
Wald c2 = 29.758; P < 0.001; complete sample: Wald c2
= 26.186, P < 0.001).
The relationship between age of sample and PCR performance can also be seen in Figure 2 and Table 3: A
higher proportion of successful PCR was obtained from

younger samples. For the 600 bp-amplicon this was the
case with DNA from both tissue types, whereas for the
330 bp-amplicon foot pads performed only slightly better. From specimens older than 1915 the 600 bp-amplicon could not be obtained at all. However, this was also
the case for several younger samples (i.e., maximum
amplicon length 192 bp).
Finally, we tested the influence of arsenic treatment
on PCR success for the complete sample, excluding the
collection date for this calculation. Arsenic-treated samples performed significantly worse (Wald c2 = 20.400, P
< 0.001). However, it should be noted that the effect of
sample age cannot be excluded completely from the
analysis as all samples from before 1971 had been treated with arsenic.
PCR experiment using arsenic

The addition of arsenic solution of increasing concentration to the PCR mixture had a clear negative impact on
PCR performance (Figure 3). However, this effect did
not increase continuously with rising arsenic concentrations. Compared to the sample without arsenic (lane 1)
DNA amplification proceeded without visible inhibition
until a certain threshold was passed (lanes 6 to 8). This
threshold was reached at a sodium arsenite concentration of 5.4 μg/μl.

Discussion
While both foot pad and body skin samples yielded
mtCR DNA sequences, the two tissue types differed in
the proportion of successful PCR amplifications (Figure
1, Table 3). For both the 330 bp and the 600 bp-amplicon foot pads proved to be more successful and mostly
showed somewhat stronger signal intensity on electrophoresis gels. Practically, this is not problematic, as even
samples with weak gel signals yielded sufficient DNA for
sequencing purposes. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to learn more about the reasons for the different
performance.
Disentangling effects of tissue type, age and arsenic
treatment

One explanation for the better performance of foot pads
in the PCR experiment is the assumption that DNA
degradation is lower in foot pads compared to body
skin. We also cannot rule out the possibility that skin
samples in general contain less DNA owing to smaller
cell numbers than in foot pads. However, it appears
plausible that DNA degradation might proceed more
rapidly in thin body skin that is more exposed to external influences such as temperature and humidity compared to thicker tissue structures of a specimen, e.g.
foot pads. This might explain the lower PCR success
with longer amplicons (600 bp and 330 bp, respectively)

from body skin samples (Figure 1). The outermost
horny skin of the foot pads may represent an additional
barrier. Since moisture is an important factor promoting
DNA degradation by fostering enzymatic activity
[20-22], the treatment of skins during preparation (e.g.,
under field conditions) as well as transport and storage
conditions crucially influence DNA quality. Consequently, we cannot conclude which of these factors had
the greatest influence on PCR results. At least the fact

that general PCR success in all samples is reciprocally
proportional to amplicon size (192 bp-amplicon 100%,
330 bp-amplicon 82%, 600 bp-amplicon 64%) suggests
that differences in DNA quality are crucial factors rather
than solely DNA concentration.
The influence of collection date on PCR success (Figures 1, 2) is ambiguous and cannot be generalised.
Although our data show a correspondence of specimen
age and PCR performance, DNA degradation might

Figure 3 Influence of arsenic concentration on PCR
performance. DNA template from fresh tissue sample Gglagla8.
Arsenic concentrations (μg/μl): lanes 1-8: 0 - 4.6 - 4.8 - 5.0 - 5.2 - 5.4
- 6.0 - control sample (without DNA or arsenic). Signal intensity
decreases with increasing arsenic concentration and breaks down
from sample 6 (5.4 μg/μl).

proceed at different rates in each specimen depending
on its individual history. Apart from the rule-of-thumb
that recent samples might deliver a larger amount of
non-degraded DNA that allow the generation of longer
amplicons (cf. e.g. [23]) there are many individual
exceptions (Figure 2). The data presented here confirms
findings of other studies [24-27] that the maximum
amplicon length varies individually, depending not only
on a specimen’s age but also on the respective collectors
or taxidermists.
The actual impact of the specimens’ arsenic content on
PCR performance could not be determined unequivocally. Since we do not know to which extent the feet were
actually treated with arsenic, we assumed an identical
treatment both for skin and foot pad samples. Although
statistics showed a significant effect of arsenic treatment
on overall PCR success rate, it is evident that the time
factor cannot be eliminated from the test, simply because
the arsenic-treated samples are the older ones. Thus,
lower amplification success in arsenic-treated samples
might also be attributable to individual age effects and
different rates of DNA degradation (Figure 1).
PCR experiment using arsenic

The common assumption that arsenic might inhibit
PCR is based on the known mutagenic effects of arsenic.
Arsenic itself is unlikely to cause gene mutations
directly [14,28], but can induce DNA strand breaks by
mediation of reactive oxygen species in living cells [29].
However, these reports refer to living systems and are

not directly comparable to in vitro processes. Although
our PCR experiment with different tissue types suggests
that arsenic has an influence on PCR success, this effect
is doubtlessly superimposed by age-dependent DNA
degradation. Besides potential DNA damage, arsenic
could also influence PCR performance by interaction
with DNA polymerase. A number of studies demonstrate
arsenic to inhibit DNA transcription factors [13] and to
impede in vivo DNA repair mechanisms by binding to
polymerases [13-17]. In particular, arsenic attachment to
zinc finger domains of proteins hampers normal polymerase activity [17]. Assuming that arsenic directly inhibits polymerase activity, this inhibition should be
observed with any amplicon length in in vitro experiments. Nevertheless, this was not the case in our experiments with various museum specimens. Our PCR
experiment using increasing arsenic concentrations
further disproved this assumption: regarding the high
concentrations necessary to inhibit PCR in our experiment (~ 5.4 μg/μl, Figure 3) we consider such high doses
of arsenic to be highly unlikely to occur in dried zoological specimens like bird skins. This is corroborated by the
findings of [12] who detected arsenic concentrations as
low as 0.935 mg/l and 0.173 mg/l in skin and feather
samples respectively. Although we did not perform particular measurements, we assume that arsenic concentration in the final DNA elution used in our comparisons of
the two tissue types was much lower than in our PCR
experiment: The highly DNA-specific extraction protocol
is based on purification by means of a DNA-selective
membrane and the discard of any other cellular compound. We therefore consider the contribution of arsenic
in dried museum specimens to be negligible for a potential inhibition of DNA polymerase.
Sampling museum specimens

A main question of this study was whether sampling of
anatomically scarce components of a specimen (foot
pads) could be substituted by less critical parts (body
skin). In contrast to [10] we neither regard foot pad sampling as “non-destructive” nor the damage done to the
feet as “negligible” in morphological respect. This is particularly important for small-sized specimens and those
of rare taxa that cannot be re-obtained. When using body
skin instead of cutting off foot or toe pads, care should be
taken not to damage those areas where the skin is sewn
in order to avoid impairing the skin’s stability (in small
birds the skin often remains unsewn and potential sampling areas can be reached easily). Alternatively, punch
biopsy samples can be taken instead of using scalpels
[30]. By doing so, there should be sufficient skin material
remaining for other examinations and replication of
experiments. The negligible effect of this procedure on
the specimen’s appearance is comparable to carefully

Töpfer et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/197

sampling single feathers from preserved skins as recommended by [8].
In our study, the two tissue types were compared to
find out whether they are equally useful regarding PCR
success. The results show that, especially for old specimens, foot pad samples are the better choice. Nonetheless, for particularly valuable, small, or rare specimens
the use of skin samples should be considered first. We
are convinced that using body skin samples can relieve
ornithological and other vertebrate collections, at least
partly, of the need to cause irreversible damage to specimens. This might be a reasonable alternative for
recently collected specimens.

Conclusions
This study shows that the arsenic content in body skin
samples of dried specimens has a negligible effect on
DNA polymerase efficacy as inhibition occurs only at
very high concentrations that are unlikely to be found in
dried zoological specimens. However, potential DNA
damage due to arsenic treatment cannot be ruled out,
although such an effect is hard to disentangle from normal DNA degradation in old samples. Nonetheless, irrespective of arsenic content, PCR success proved to be
significantly better with DNA from foot pads compared
to body skin, especially for old specimens. Therefore,
the conflict between the intention to preserve morphologically important structures and the need for DNA
sources yielding optimal PCR success remains. In order
not to compromise the future research potential of zoological specimens, both interests should be balanced
carefully.
