Genome-scale identification of Soybean BURP
domain-containing genes and their expression
under stress treatments
Hongliang Xu, Yaxuan Li, Yueming Yan, Ke Wang, Ya Gao, Yingkao Hu*

Abstract
Background: Multiple proteins containing BURP domain have been identified in many different plant species, but
not in any other organisms. To date, the molecular function of the BURP domain is still unknown, and no
systematic analysis and expression profiling of the gene family in soybean (Glycine max) has been reported.
Results: In this study, multiple bioinformatics approaches were employed to identify all the members of BURP
family genes in soybean. A total of 23 BURP gene types were identified. These genes had diverse structures and
were distributed on chromosome 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 18. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these
BURP family genes could be classified into 5 subfamilies, and one of which defines a new subfamily, BURPV.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of transcript levels showed that 15 of the 23 genes had no
expression specificity; 7 of them were specifically expressed in some of the tissues; and one of them was not
expressed in any of the tissues or organs studied. The results of stress treatments showed that 17 of the 23
identified BURP family genes responded to at least one of the three stress treatments; 6 of them were not
influenced by stress treatments even though a stress related cis-element was identified in the promoter region. No
stress related cis-elements were found in promoter region of any BURPV member. However, qRT-PCR results
indicated that all members from BURPV responded to at least one of the three stress treatments. More significantly,
the members from the RD22-like subfamily showed no tissue-specific expression and they all responded to each of
the three stress treatments.
Conclusions: We have identified and classified all the BURP domain-containing genes in soybean. Their expression
patterns in different tissues and under different stress treatments were detected using qRT-PCR. 15 out of 23 BURP
genes in soybean had no tissue-specific expression, while 17 out of them were stress-responsive. The data
provided an insight into the evolution of the gene family and suggested that many BURP family genes may be
important for plants responding to stress conditions.

Background
The BURP domain-containing protein family is defined
by its conserved amino acid motif whose name is based
on four typical members, BNM2, USP, RD22, and PG1b.
BURP domain-containing proteins have so far only been
found in plants, suggesting that their functions may be
plant specific. Generally, the BURP family proteins consist of several modules: an N-terminal hydrophobic
domain, a presumptive transit peptide; a variable internal region containing either a short conserved segment

or other segments; an optional segment consisting of
repeated units which is unique to each member; and the
BURP domain at the C-terminus [1].
BURP domain-containing proteins were classified into
four subfamilies, BNM2-like, USP-like, RD22-like, and
PG1b-like [2]. All members of each subfamily contain
BURP domain at the C-terminal region. Within the
domain there are several conserved amino acid residues,
including four cystein-histidine repeats and one tryptophan residue. The spacing between the four CH residues
is highly conserved, being X 5-CH-X10 -CH-X23-27-CHX23-26-CH-X8-W, where X is any amino acid. The difference between the BURP domain-containing proteins

mostly occurred in the region immediately downstream
of the hydrophobic signal peptide. This region contains
a short conserved segment and an optional segment of
repeated units. Unlike other BURP domain-containing
proteins, the BNM2-like subfamily proteins are directly
linked to the C-terminal region by a short conserved
segment following the signal peptide [3]. Both the USPlike subfamily and RD22-like subfamily proteins can be
distinguished from other subfamily proteins by a region
containing ~30 amino acid residues followed by a variable region. However, for the RD22-like subfamily proteins, the variable region consists of repeat sequences
while USP-like subfamily has no such a region [2]. The
PG1b-like family proteins differ from other subfamily
members by the presence of multiple copies of a 14
amino-acid repeat sequence [4].
Many members of the BURP protein family have been
found in various plant species but the functions of these
proteins are unknown or only tentatively explored.
Transcription of BNM2 from oilseed rape (Brassica
napus L.) is induced at the start of microspore embryogenesis but the corresponding protein remains confined
to seeds where it is localized in the protein storage
vacuoles [4-7]. VfUSP, an abundant non-storage seed
protein with unknown function from the field bean
(Vicia faba L.), is expressed during the early stages of
zygotic embryogenesis [8], and at very early stages of in
vitro embryogenesis [9]. ASG1 is a specifically expressed
gene during the early embryo sac development in apomictic gynoecia, but does not express in sexual gynoecia
of Panicum [10]. PG1b, the non-catalytic b-subunit of
the polygalacturonase isozyme (PG) from ripening
tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plays a significant
role in regulating pectin metabolism by limiting the
extent of pectin solubilization and depolymerization
[4,11]. SCB1 is a seed coat specific protein [12] identified in soybean. OsRAFTIN1, an anther-specific protein
in rice (Oryza sativa L.), transports sporopollenin from
tapetum to developing microspores via Ubisch bodies
[13]. AtUSPL1 occurs in cellular compartments such as
Golgi cisternae, dense vesicles, prevaculoar vesicles and
the protein storage vacuoles in the parenchyma cell of
cotyledons, and thus may play a role in seed development [14]. So it seems that many BURP family members
play a role in maintaining the normal metabolism or
development in plants.
Besides their significant roles in plant development
and metabolism, many BURP domain-containing proteins have been reported to be stress-induced. RD22, a
drought induced protein of Arabidopsis [15], has often
been used as a reference for drought stress treatment in
different plants. The mechanism for abscisic acid (ABA)
regulation of plants stress has been well studied in Arabidopsis. ABA activates the gene expression of rd22BP1

Page 2 of 16

and ATMYB2, which in return induces the expression of
the RD22 gene as transcription factors [16]. Both ADR6,
the auxin down-regulated protein [17], and SALI3-2, an
aluminium-induced protein [18], were found in soybean.
Transcription of BnBDC1, from oilseed rape, was upregulated by manitol, NaCl and ABA, and down-regulated by UV irradiation and salicylic acid [19]. Among
the 17 BURP genes from Oryza sativa, 15 were induced
by at least one of the stresses including drought, salt,
cold, and ABA treatment [3]. All the reports about
BURP family genes indicate that this group of genes
may have two major functions in plants. One is the regulation of reproductive development in plants, such as
BNM2, VfUSP and ASG1, while the other is responsive
to stress, for example RD22 and ADR6.
Soybean is one of the most economically and nutritionally important crops. It provides not only vegetable
protein and edible oil but also essential amino acids for
humans and animals. However, soybean production is
threatened by drought and other environmental stresses.
BURP domain-containing proteins are known to be
involved in embryogenesis or stress responses. Over the
years, some of the soybean BURP proteins including
ADR6, SALI3-2 and SCB1 have been identified and studied. As the genome sequence of the soybean is complete, it is possible to analyze the entire family of
soybean BURP proteins. In the current study, 23 putative genes of the BURP family were identified. To discover the functions of all the members, we investigated
the transcript level of all genes in eight different tissues
and organs as well as under 3 different stress treatments. The results presented in this study showed that
the expression of most of the soybean BURP genes is
non-tissue-specific but stress-responsive.

Results
Identification and distribution of soybean BURP family
members

Through soybean genome blast and online software
identification, a total of 23 putative BURP genes were
identified. These putative genes were designated Gm01,
Gm02, Gm04.1, Gm04.2, Gm04.3, Gm06.1, Gm06.2,
Gm06.3, Gm07, Gm08.1, Gm08.2, Gm08.3, Gm11.1,
Gm11.2, Gm12.3, Gm11.3, Gm12.1, Gm12.2, Gm13,
Gm14.1, Gm14.2, Gm18.1, Gm18.2. Previously reported
BURP domain-containing protein genes in soybean,
SCB1, ADR6, BURP2, and Sali3-2 correspond to Gm07,
Gm12.2, Gm14.1, and Gm12.3, respectively. The 23 soybean BURP genes were located on chromosome 1, 2, 4,
6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 18 (Figure 1). We noticed
that BURP genes on chromosome 11 and 18 clustered
together with each other. Examination of the location of
each BURP gene http://soybase.org/gbrowse/cgi-bin/
gbrowse/gmax1.01/ revealed that all GmBURP genes

except for Gm07, Gm08.2, Gm14.1, and Gm14.2, were
located in duplicate regions (Table 1). Gm04.3, Gm06.1,
Gm08.1, Gm11.1, and Gm18.1 were found as single
copy in their duplicated areas. The results of intronexon structure identification (Figure 2) showed that
most of BURP domain-containing protein genes have
very few introns, 10 out of 23 have only one intron; 9
have two introns; and 2 have no introns. The other two
genes have 3 introns. BURP genes located close to each
other on the same chromosome tend to have similar
structures. Specifically, both Gm4.1 and Gm4.3 have one
intron flanked by two exons; Gm11.1, Gm11.2, and
Gm11.3 have one intron; Gm14.1 and Gm14.2 have 3
introns. However, Gm18.1 has one intron and the
nearby Gm18.2 has two introns.
Sequence analysis of BURP proteins

The BURP domain for each predicted protein was identified by searching against the SMART database. One of

23 BURP domain-containing proteins, Gm08.1 had only
an incomplete BURP domain at the C-terminal. The
characteristics of the soybean BURP proteins including
the signal peptide, pI, molecular weight, and some additional gene features are presented in Table 1.
Based on the protein sequences and the produced phylogenetic tree, 41 BURP proteins from different species
(3 from Arabidopsis thaliana; 2 from Brassica napus; 4
from Bruguiera gymnorrhiza; 1 from Zea mays; 23 from
Glycine max; 3 from Oryza sativa; 1 from Vicia faba; 4
from Lycopersicon.) were classified into 5 subfamilies,
BNM2-like, USP-like, RD22-like, PG1b-like, and BURPV
(Figure 3). The first four subfamilies had been defined
before, but BURPV is new. Interestingly, all the BURPV
members were from soybean. From the alignment of
BURP domain sequences, several highly conserved residues were identified: two glycine residues, two F residues,
two E residues, and four CH motifs (Figure 4). The conserved sequence of the BURP domain was described as

means any amino acid residue. However, not all
sequences corresponded to this consensus. Gm08.1 with
incomplete BURP domain lacked all the conserved residues but had all four CH motifs. In Gm14.1, Gm14.2 and
Gm18.1 the last conserved residue W was replaced by F;
and Gm18.2 lacked the last CH motif.
Organ and tissue specific expression of GmBURP genes

Several genes of the BURP family have been noted for
their differential expression patterns in various plant tissues and organs. As a way to reveal the expression pattern
of each GmBURP gene, the transcript levels were determined in 8 different tissues and organs (root, stem, leaf,
flower, epicotyl, hypocotyl, cotyledon, and seed) of soybean cultivar Zhonghuang13 using qRT-PCR analysis
(Figure 5). The gene specific primers are listed in Table 2.

The result showed that GmBURP genes vary widely in
their specificities and in expression levels. According to
their expression specificity GmBURP genes were divided
into two groups. The first group (Gm01, Gm02, Gm04.2,
Gm04.3, Gm06.1, Gm06.2, Gm06.3, Gm08.1, Gm11.1,
Gm12.1, Gm12.2, Gm12.3, Gm14.1, Gm14.2, and Gm18.1)
were expressed in all 8 tissues and organs but in different
levels. Judging from their expression patterns, these genes
may play roles in some basic metabolic pathways. Gm04.3,
Gm06.1, Gm11.1, Gm12.1, Gm12.2, Gm12.3, and Gm18.2
were strongly expressed in roots. Gm06.1, Gm08.1,
Gm12.2, Gm12.3 and Gm18.2 were strongly expressed in
stems. Gm04.2, Gm12.2 and Gm12.3 were most strongly
expressed in leaves. Gm01, Gm02 and Gm14.1 were
strongly expressed in flowers, indicating that they may
play a role in soybean sexual reproduction. Gm01, Gm02,
Gm04.3, Gm06.3 and Gm18.1 were highly expressed in

epicotyls. Gm01, Gm04.3, Gm06.1, Gm06.3, Gm08.1,
Gm11.1, Gm12.2, Gm12.3 and Gm14.1 had high expression levels in hypocotyls. In seeds only two genes, Gm04.3
and Gm06.3 were highly expressed, indicating that they
could have similar functions as Gm07.
The second group of genes (Gm04.1, Gm07, Gm08.2,
Gm08.3, Gm11.2, Gm11.3, Gm13 and Gm18.2) were not
expressed in at least one of the eight selected tissues and
organs. All the genes of this group, except for Gm13,
were not expressed in leaves. Gm11.3 was not expressed
in any of the eight tissues and organs. It may, however,
be specifically expressed in certain tissues or development periods not studied here. Gm07 (SCB1), one of the
well studied GmBURP genes from soybean, was highly
expressed in seeds, very low expression in stems and
cotyledons, and no expression in the other 5 tissues.
Gm08.2 was highly expressed in hypocotyls, but not in
leaves and roots, which suggested that it mainly functions
at the early stages of soybean development. Gm08.3 had
relatively high expression in epicotyls and flowers. Gm13
was highly expressed in epicotyls but not in seeds. As
Gm08.2 it may mainly function at the early stages of
plant development. Gm11.2 and Gm18.2 were expressed
only in roots and stems. Since each member of this
group lacked expression in one or more analysed tissues
or organs, this group of genes may have more specific
functions in soybean than the group 1 BURP genes.
All the GmBURP genes, except for Gm18.2 of the
PG1b-like subfamily, were highly expressed in epicotyls.
Only two BURPV subfamily members (Gm04.3 and

Gm07) were highly expressed in seeds. Three genes,
Gm08.2, Gm12.2, and Gm12.3, of the five GmBURP
genes belonging to the USP-like subfamily were highly
expressed in hypocotyls. Two BNM2-like subfamily
genes Gm06.1 and Gm11.1 had high expression levels in
hypocotyls, and Gm06.1 also had a high expression level
in stems. Meanwhile, the expression levels of the RD22like genes varied widely but all of them were expressed
in all eight selected tissues and organs. More specifically,
Gm06.1 was mainly expressed in stems, leaves and epicotyls; Gm14.1 was relatively high expressed in flowers
and hypocotyls; Gm14.2 was mainly expressed in leaves,
flowers, and hypocotyls; while Gm18.1 was highly
expressed in epicotyls. The expression pattern indicates
that members belonging to this subfamily may play significant roles in soybean, but it was postulated that they
mainly function in different tissues or organs.
Promoter cis-element identification and expression under
stress treatments

Several genes of the BURP family have been reported to
be stress related. Examples are RD22 from Arabidopsis
which responds to drought, and SALI3-2 (Gm12.3)
which is induced by aluminium.
The online database PLACE was used to identify ciselements for each GmBURP gene. 2000 bp upstream of
the full-length cDNAs were searched against the database
and two putative stress-responsive cis-elements ABRE
(ABA responsive element) and DRE (dehydration-responsive element) [20,21] were found for most of the GmBURP

Gm08.2, Gm08.3, Gm11.3, Gm12.1, Gm12.2, Gm13, and
Gm14.2). We noticed that ABRE elements were identified
in the promoter regions of all members from BNM2-like,

Page 9 of 16

USP-like, and RD22-like subfamily but not BURPV subfamily. DRE sequences were identified in some members
of all four subfamilies except BURPV. The results indicate
that most of the GmBURP genes may be stress-relative.
To support the predictions made by PLACE analysis,
dehydration and salt-inducible GmBURP genes were
screened. Water potential determination results showed

that water potential of all samples was lowered under
ABA, NaCl, or PEG treatments, indicating that plants
were effectively stressed (Figure 7). qRT-PCR was
employed to analyze the gene expression on transcriptional level under three different treatments (Figure 8, 9,
10). The result showed that 17 GmBURP genes
responded to at least one of the stress treatments. For
ABA treatment two genes, Gm04.3, and Gm06.1, and
three genes, Gm08.1, Gm12.2, and Gm12.3, were upand down-regulated, respectively, while 10 genes (Gm01,
Gm02, Gm04.1, Gm04.2, Gm06.2, Gm08.3, Gm13,
Gm14.1, Gm14.2, Gm18.1) were initially up-regulated
and later down-regulated during the later stages of the
treatment. After PEG treatment 5 genes (Gm04.1,
Gm08.3, Gm14.1, Gm14.2, and Gm18.1) were up-regulated, and 4 genes (Gm06.1, Gm08.1, Gm12.2 and
Gm12.3) were down-regulated, while 7 genes (Gm01,
Gm02, Gm04.2, Gm04.3, Gm06.2, Gm11.1, and Gm13)
were first up and then down-regulated. The expression
patterns under NaCl were different: 3 genes, Gm01,
Gm02 and Gm14.2, were up-regulated; 2 genes, Gm12.1
and Gm12.2, were down regulated; 9 genes (Gm04.3,
Gm04.1, Gm06.1, Gm06.2, Gm07, Gm11.1, Gm13,
Gm14.1, and Gm18.1) were first up and then downregulated; 3 genes, Gm04.2, Gm08.1, and Gm12.3, were
first down-regulated and then up-regulated.
Many GmBURP genes were regulated by more than
one of the treatments. Among the 17 stress responsive
GmBURP genes, 13 of them responded to all the three
treatments; two of them (Gm08.3 and Gm11.1) respond
to two different stresses; Gm07 and Gm12.1 only
responded to NaCl treatment. More interestingly, two
genes, Gm04.1 and Gm07, which were not expressed in
leaves, were also stress responsive: Gm04.1 responded
to all the three treatments while Gm07 responded to

treatments: PEG, NaCl, and ABA. The x-axis is the time courses of
treatments. The y-axis is water potential of soybean leaf under stress
treatments.

Page 10 of 16

NaCl treatment only. We also noticed that all the members of BNM2-like (except for Gm11.3), RD22-like and
BURPV were responsive to at least one treatment. More
significantly, RD22-like subfamily genes responded to all
three treatments. Some members of other subfamilies
also responded to stress treatment: the PG1b-like subfamily had three genes (Gm01, Gm02, and Gm08.3)
which were stress responsive, while the USP-like subfamily had four genes, Gm12.2, Gm08.1, Gm12.3, and
Gm13, responded to at least one of the three
treatments.
The results of qRT-PCR were not always consistent with
these of the promoter region analysis. There were no
ABRE or DRE elements detected in any of the promoter
regions of BURPV family members, but the real-time PCR
results showed that all the members of this subfamily were
stress responsive. This strongly indicated that some unidentified stress responsive cis-elements may play an
important role in regulating the soybean stress response.

Discussion
Structure characteristics of BURP proteins

BURP domain-containing proteins contain three or four
distinct modules: (1) an N-terminal hydrophobic domain
which is a presumptive signal peptide; (2) a short conserved segment; (3) an optional repetitive region which
is unique to each member; and (4) the C-terminal
BURP domain [1]. They were classified into four subfamilies by Granger [2], and the structure of the conserved BURP domain was described as CHX 10CHX2527 CHX 25-26CH [1]. The most obvious characteristics of
the BURP domain are 2C residues and 4 CH motifs.
More recent report showed that the distance between
the last three CH motifs are not always 25-27 and 2526, respectively, and the domain was newly described as
X5-CH-X10-CH-X23-37-CH-X23-26-CH-X8-W [3]. However, the conserved residue F is replaced by W in three
BURP domain-containing proteins, Gm14.1, Gm14.2,
and Gm18.1. It was also noticed that all the three proteins were from RD22-like subfamily.
A lot of work has been done to reveal the structure of
the BURP domain but still little is known about the function of each module. It is through the BURP domain, that
SCB1 (Gm07) is localized on the cell wall [12]. The BURP
domain of SALI3-2 (Gm12.3) was shown to be a key
component for its tolerance to salt. Deletion of the signal
peptide of SALI3-2 reduced salt tolerance of transgenic
yeast [22]. So, it seems that these two parts are important
for the function of BURP proteins. However, the mature
PG1b contains only the repeated region after the cleavage
site of its transit peptide, and the BURP domain. These
two parts form a PG1 complex with catalytic PG2 polypeptide [4,23,24]. Despite the conservation of the BURP
domains and their sequence similarities, the function of

each BURP protein and the roles of each module seem to
be greatly varied among plants.
Evolution of BURP genes and divergence of their
functions

In total 41 BURP domain-containing proteins from various plants were classified into 5 subfamilies. Members
of RD22-like, BNM2-like, USP-like, and BURPV subfamilies were all from dicotyledons, while in PG1b subfamily members can come from both dicotyledon and
monocotyledon plants.
The classification of the BURP protein genes may not be
final, and it remains unknown how these subgroups
evolved. By comparing the surrounding genomic
sequences, Hattori [1] proposed that the exons coding the
signal peptide and C-terminal BURP region may have
been âshuffledâ into the various modular protein structures. Hattori also suggested that in view of the highly
repetitive nature of the BURP proteins, the amplification
of short sequences has also been important during the
evolution of the family. The PG1b subfamily BURP proteins from dicotyledons were clustered more closely than
the two (Zm22403013 and OsBURP16) from monocotyledons which suggested that BURP genes existed before the
divergence of the monocotyledon and dicotyledon
lineages. Four GmBURPs (Gm01, Gm02, Gm08.3, and

Gm18.2) are more closely clustered with each other than
with At15219066 from Arabidopsis and two GmBURP
proteins, Gm04.1 and Gm06.3, are more closely clustered
than four proteins (LePG1b, LeAroGP1, LeAroGP2, and
LeAroGP3) from tomato, indicating that duplications of
some BURP genes in Glycine max happened earlier than
the divergence of soybean and Arabidopsis or tomato. It is
the same in BNM2-like, and USP-like subfamilies, suggesting that the divergence of soybean from faba bean (Vicia
faba L.), and oilseed rape happened after the duplication
of GmBURP genes.
The location of BURP genes in soybean may also give
some insight into the evolution of the gene family. 19
out of 23 BURP genes were found located in duplicated
regions (Table 1). 17 out of the 19 BURP genes (Gm01,
02, 04.1, 04.2, 04.3, 06.1, 06.2, 06.3, 08.1, 08.3, 11.1, 12.1,
12.2, 12.3, 13, 18.1, and 18.2) located in duplicate
regions appear to originate from segmental duplications.
Gm11.2 and Gm11.3 seem to originate from tandem
duplications. Among the 19 BURP genes, Gm04.1,
Gm06.1, Gm08.1, Gm11.1 and Gm18.1 were found as
single copies, this is not surprising because mass gene
losses and chromosome rearrangements following largescale genome duplication have occurred in soybean [25],
leading to losses of about 25% of duplicated genes [26].
The four genes, Gm07, Gm08.2, Gm14.1 and Gm14.2,

which are located outside of the duplicated region,
might have been produced by retrotransposition. The
structure similarity and variation between genes located
on the same chromosome and phylogenetic analysis
might help to explain the order of duplication evens of
the sister genes on the same chromosome. For example,
Gm04.2, Gm04.1, and Gm04.3 located in different duplicate regions of the same chromosome, all have two
introns flanked by three exons. However, phylogenetic
analysis showed that Gm04.2 was more similar to
Gm06.2, and Gm04.1 was close to Gm06.3 while
Gm04.3 which is located relatively close to Gm04.2 had
no duplicate genes on chromosome 6. It is possible that
the duplication of the same ancestral gene on chromosome 4 created Gm04.1 and ancestor for Gm04.3 and
Gm04.2 then they evolve independently. The intron and
exon sequences for ancestor gene elongated for various
reasons before it split into Gm04.2 and Gm04.3.
Through fragmental duplication the two chromosome
fragments, one contains Gm04.1 and the other contains
Gm04.2 and Gm04.3 were independently copied to different part of chromosome 6. During the later evolution,
the counterpart of Gm04.3 was lost and structures for

the counterparts of Gm04.1 and Gm04.2 changed by
deletion or insertion of other fragments or partial
sequence repeats variations.
Genome blast did not identify any BURP genes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii http://genome.jgi-psf.org/, while
18 BURP proteins from Physcomitrella patens subsp.
patens were recorded in NCBI protein database. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lives in lakes or other freshwaters,
while the moss Physcomitrella patens grows on land, the
differences in the BURP distribution indicate that BURP
family genes appeared when plants start to move from
water to land where the environment became more variable. The origin of BURP genes indicates this gene family
may play a role in plant adaptation to adverse environments. According to the phylogenetic analysis, BURP
genes from different species were classified into 5 subfamilies, this classification suggests that their functions diversified during evolution. BNM2, expressed during the start of
microspore embryogenesis and the corresponding protein
is confined to seeds [5,6,22], VfUSP, expressed during the
early stages of zygotic embryogenesis [8] indicating that
proteins in BNM2 and USP subfamilies may have similar
functions. PG1b, the non-catalyticb-subunit of the

polygalacturonase isozyme (PG), and SCB1 from soybean
seed coat suggest possibly similar functions for the other
members in PG1b and BURPV subfamilies. RD22, from
Arabidopsis, has been reported to be stress related. It is
interesting that during embryogenesis, fruit ripening and
seed development the cells need to lose water and store
certain materials to fulfil the physical functions. During
these processes an in-cell stress environment may be created. It seems possible that the diversified BURP members
retain their original of stress response functions. For
example, proteins belonging to RD22 subfamily mainly
respond to stresses during the vegetative plant development, while members from USP or BNM2 subfamilies
respond to stresses during plant reproduction.
Organ or tissue specific expression of GmBURP genes and
their expression under different stress treatments

In the current work, GmBURP gene expression pattern
in different tissues and organs and under various stress
conditions were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The result
showed that some genes with high sequence similarity
also have similar expression pattern in different tissues

and organs or under different stress conditions. For
instance, two genes Gm01 and Gm02, which are similar
to each other, were expressed in all eight different tissues and organs and both had very low expression in
leaves and seeds, while highly expressed in epicotyls
and, under three different stress treatments they all
had an up-regulated period. Two closely clustered
genes, Gm06.1, and Gm08.1, of the BNM2-like subfamily, were highly expressed in stems and hypocotyls, and
responded to all stress treatments. All the GmBURP
genes from RD22-like subfamily showed no tissue specificity, and were responsive to all stress treatments. However, not all genes with similar sequences showed the
same expression pattern. E.g. Gm06.3 and Gm04.1 are
closely clustered and highly similar members of the
PG1b-like subfamily. Gm06.3 was expressed in all eight
tissues and organs and did not respond to any of the
three stress treatments, while Gm04.1 was not expressed
in leaves, and respond to all stress treatments. Gm08.3
and Gm18.2 from the same subfamily with high
sequence similarity showed different expression patterns,
too: Gm08.3 had no expression in leaves, but it

Xu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/197

responded to ABA or drought treatments. Although
Gm18.2 did not expressed in leaves either, it was not
responsive to any of the three treatments. Two genes,
Gm12.1 and Gm11.2, from the BNM2-subfamily showed
the same patterns as Gm08.3 and Gm18.2. Previously
described examples also existed in the USP-like family.
Sequence similarity indicates that these genes might be
the result of relatively recent gene duplication events.
The difference of tissue or organ specificity and stress
response maybe result from different upstream or downstream regulatory elements or factors.
Through phylogenetic analysis we defined a new subfamily, BURPV, containing two members which are all
from soybean. Promoter analysis revealed no ABRE or
DRE elements was found in the upstream 2000 bp
region of the full length cDNA. Interestingly, all the
BURPVgenes responded to at least one stress treatment,
suggesting the existence of some unknown stress related
cis-element. One member of this new defined subfamily,
SCB1 (Gm07), a seed coat specific protein has been
reported to have very strict expression pattern [12], but
we found that in addition to the strong expression in
seeds, it was slightly expressed in cotyledons and stems.
Interestingly, despite the lack of expression in leaves,
SCB1 was up-regulated by NaCl stress. Another
GmBURP gene, Gm04.3, from the new subfamily BURP
may also play a role during seed development because it
had a similar expression pattern to SCB1 which made it
a candidate gene for study of the influence of stress
treatments on seed development.
Soybean is very important for the society because it is
a major source of oil and protein-rich food. However,
the production of soybean is threatened by drought and
restricted by poor soil quality. RD22, an Arabidopsis
drought responsive gene has been reported for its stress
response [15]. All the GmBURP genes belonging to
RD22-like subfamily and most of GmBURP genes from
other subfamilies are stress responsive. Itâs worth mentioning that the GmBURP genes Gm04.1, Gm07, and
Gm08.3, which had no detectable transcription detected
in unstressed leaves, were induced by stress treatments.

Conclusions
The BURP domain-containing proteins are a large
family of evolutionarily conserved proteins only found
in plants. Members of the family had been reported to
be involved in the reproductive development and stress
resistance of plants. In this study of the complete soybean genome, we identified 23 BURP proteins. We also
propose their classification based on the sequence alignment and previous reports which give insight into the
evolutionary relationships of the genes from multiple
plant species. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis revealed
the expression patterns of these genes in different

Page 14 of 16

tissues and under different stress treatments. Most
BURP genes showed no tissue specificity and respond to
stress treatments. Clearly, there is a need to functionally
validate the roles of those genes induced under different
stress conditions. Another important finding of the
work is that all the members in soybean that belong to
RD22 subfamily showed strong response to all three
stress treatments. This may indicate that this subfamily
specifically acted as a defence against stress in soybeans,
and it is likely to play similar roles in other plant species. The results described here will be helpful for the
further study of the functions of BURP domain-containing proteins, and for the screening candidate drought
resistance genes in soybean and in other plants.

Methods
Identification of BURP family genes in soybean

Four typical BURP gene sequences BNM2 [GenBank:
AF049028], USP [Genbank: X13210], RD22 [GenBank:
NM_122472], and PG1b [GenBank: M98466] were used to
blast against the soybean genome database http://www.
phytozome.net/soybean using TBLASTX program. For
each query sequence several putative genes located on different chromosomes were found. A data file containing all
the information of the target genes including location on
the chromosomes, genomic sequences, full CDS
sequences, and protein sequences was provided in the
above website. Redundant genes were removed manually.
The SMART database (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de
[27]) and the conserved domain database (CDD) http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi were used
to confirm each predicted BURP protein.
Phylogenetic tree construction and sequence analysis

To investigate the molecular evolution and phylogenetic
relationships among BURP proteins in plants, a phylogenetic tree was generated by multi-alignment of BURP
domain sequences of all 23 BURP family proteins from
soybean and 18 protein sequences from other plants
(Arabidopsis, tomato, rice, faba, mangrove, bean, tomato,
oilseed rape and maize). The SMART program was used
to extract the protein sequences of the BURP domain
for each protein [27], and then they were aligned using
ClustalX1.83 [28]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using software MEGA4.0 [29]. Online software
Compute pI/Mw http://au.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html
was used to predict the molecular weight and pI for
each predicted BURP protein. SignalP 3.0 Server http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ and SMART were
employed to predict possible signal peptides. Exonintron organizations of GmBURP genes were determined by comparing predicted coding sequences (CDS)
with their corresponding genomic sequences using software GSDS http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/. To analyze

Xu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/197

whether the motifs in each putative BURP gene implicated in stress responses, the online database PLACE
(http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/index.html[30]) was
employed by analyzing the 2000 bp upstream region of
the predicted CDS.
Plant growth and treatments

Seeds of soybean (Glycine max L.) cultivar Zhonghuang13 were germinated in pots containing soil collected from an experimental field of the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Beijing, China), and
the seedlings were grown in natural environment. To
study tissue or organ specific expression, cotyledons, epicotyls, and hypocotyls were collected from five-day-old
seedlings, while vegetative tissues such as leaves, stems,
and roots were collected from 4-week-old seedlings.
Flowers were collected when they were in full bloom.
Seeds were collected 2 weeks after flowering. After samples were collected they were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80Â°C. For stress treatments, 4-week-old seedlings growing in a chamber were
treated with different media containing 100 Î¼m ABA,
150 mM NaCl, and 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000,
respectively [31]. Seedlings without treatment were used
as control. Leaves of the stress-treated plants were collected at time intervals of 0, 2, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48 h (PEG
treated samples were collected within 0-12 hours because
later collection they would dry up). After collecting all
the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and then stored at -80Â°C for RNA extraction. Water
potential of soybean leaves was detected at each time
interval for all the three treatments with WP4-T Dew
Potentiameter (Decagon devices). Three replicates were
detected for each sample.
RNA extraction and synthesis of the first-strand cDNA

Total RNA was isolated from frozen samples by using
TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was
removed by digesting each sample (10 Î¼g of total RNA)
with DNaseI (TIANGEN) according to the manufactureâs
instruction. After DNaseItreatment, 4 Î¼l RNA of each
sample was heated at 65Â°C for 7 min. Then the firststrand cDNA was synthesized in a 20 Î¼l volume containing 0.5 Î¼l AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega), 0.5 Î¼l
RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 Î¼l oligo dT primer, 2 Î¼l
dNTP mixture, 4 Î¼l MgCl 2 (25 mM), 2 Î¼l 10Ãreverse
transcriptase buffer and 4 Î¼l heat treated RNA sample.
Finally, the reaction mixture was incubated at 42Â°C for
50 min.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) analysis

Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer5.0
and their specificity was checked by observing the

Page 15 of 16

melting curve of the RT-PCR products. The Soybean
constitutively expressed CYP2 (cyclophilin) gene was
used as reference for normalization. The primers are as
follows: sense: 5â-CGGGACCAGTGTGCTTCTTCA-3â
and antisense: 5â-CCCCTCCACTACAAAGGCTCG-3â
[32]. RT-PCR was performed in a 25 Î¼l volume containing 12.5 Î¼l 2ÃSYBRÂ® Premix Ex Taqâ¢ (TaKaRa), 1 Î¼l 50fold diluted cDNA, 0.15 Î¼l of each gene-specific primer
and 11.2 Î¼l ddH 2 O. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95Â°C for 3 min, 45 cycles of 15 s at 95Â°C, 57Â°C for
15 s and 72Â°C for 20 s. Three replicates were used for
each sample. Reaction was conducted on a CFX96 RealTime PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). All data were
analyzed using the CFX Manager Software (Bio-Rad).
