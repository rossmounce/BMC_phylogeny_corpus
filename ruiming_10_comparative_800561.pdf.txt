Comparative venom gland transcriptome analysis
of the scorpion Lychas mucronatus reveals
intraspecific toxic gene diversity and new
venomous components

Abstract
Background: Lychas mucronatus is one scorpion species widely distributed in Southeast Asia and southern China.
Anything is hardly known about its venom components, despite the fact that it can often cause human accidents.
In this work, we performed a venomous gland transcriptome analysis by constructing and screening the venom
gland cDNA library of the scorpion Lychas mucronatus from Yunnan province and compared it with the previous
results of Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus.
Results: A total of sixteen known types of venom peptides and proteins are obtained from the venom gland
cDNA library of Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus, which greatly increase the number of currently reported
scorpion venom peptides. Interestingly, we also identified nineteen atypical types of venom molecules seldom
reported in scorpion species. Surprisingly, the comparative transcriptome analysis of Yunnan-sourced Lychas
mucronatus and Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus indicated that enormous diversity and vastly abundant
difference could be found in venom peptides and proteins between populations of the scorpion Lychas
mucronatus from different geographical regions.
Conclusions: This work characterizes a large number of venom molecules never identified in scorpion species. This
result provides a comparative analysis of venom transcriptomes of the scorpion Lychas mucronatus from different
geographical regions, which thoroughly reveals the fact that the venom peptides and proteins of the same
scorpion species from different geographical regions are highly diversified and scorpion evolves to adapt a new
environment by altering the primary structure and abundance of venom peptides and proteins.

Background
More than 400 million years of evolution does not make
the scorpions alter their morphology. However, although
this one of the oldest arachnid is highly conserved in
shape all along, they occupy vast territory of the world
from Africa to Asia, Australia and America. Such powerful adaptability mostly owes to their highly specialized
venom apparatus which consists of the vesicle holding a
pair of venom glands connected to the stinger used
to inject the venom [1]. The extant scorpions can be
phylogenetically divided into 14 families based on a

morphological cladistic analysis, among which the
Buthidae is considered to be the largest and the most
medically important family [2]. As a result, this enormous
family has attracted the biggest scientific interest and
been extensively studied. Till now, approximate 800 scorpion species have been classified into the Buthidae family.
Previous study confirmed that each one of the species
may typically contain more than one hundred different
peptides in venom ranging in mass from 1,000-9,000 Da
[3-5]. Among the venom peptides in this range, two
classes are most regarded. One of them is small neurotoxic proteins that recognize ion channels and receptors
in membranes of excitable cells, and thus toxic to different organisms [6,7]. The other is antimicrobial peptides

which are important defensive molecules of the ancient
innate immunity [8].
It is acknowledged that the Buthidae family possesses
a very different venom arsenal comparing to other nonButhidae families [9]. Moreover, even within the Buthidae family, vast abundance difference can be observed
in venom compositions between genus to genus, different species within a genus and individuals within a species [10-12]. As a result, previous study estimated that
approximately 150,000 distinct polypeptides presented
in about 1500 known scorpion species in the world [13].
Numerous peptides in scorpion venoms are a big treasury waiting for exploitation. Proteomic and transcriptomic approaches have already helped us to draw a
rough picture of the molecular diversity of the scorpion
venom components [14]. To the best of our knowledge,
the transcriptomic approach is more effective in getting
an overview of scorpion venom. Not only because it can
reflect the biological processes inside the venom gland
cells, but also provides clues to the research of evolutionary path leading to scorpion toxin diversification
directly [4].
The family Buthidae has drawn most of attention
because of its medical importance. Beyond all doubt,
the venom peptides from family Buthidae will play an

important role in studying biological systems and be a
treasure for use in drug development. However, up to
date, research interests mostly concentrate on a few
genera in this family such as Androctonus [15], Buthus
[16], Mesobuthus [17], Parabuthus [18], Centruroides
[19], or Tityus [20]. In a sort of sense, other almost
eighty genera are totally ignored, despite whose venom
components are extremely attractive. Lychas mucronatus belonging to the genus Lychas of the family Buthidae is one of these scorpion species lacking of
concern. Lychas mucronatus is widely distributed in
Southeast Asia and southern China including Hainan
island [21]. This small-sized venomous animal can be
found easily in the suburbs of Yunnan, Guangxi and
Hainan provinces [22]. Recently, our group collected
one population of Lychas mucronatus from Hainan
province. We performed its venom transcriptome analysis, and some new toxins were identified [23-25].
After that, we also obtained another population of the
scorpion Lychas mucronatus from Yunnan province
(Figure 1) which subsequently identified to be the
same species with Hainan-sourced population according to morphological identification. It provided an
opportunity to give a faithful and particular investigation on intraspecific diversity of scorpion venom

peptides exist at the transcript and gene levels.
Although previous researches have demonstrated that
there are intraspecific molecular diversity exiting in
geographic isolated scorpion populations, these
researches used mtDNA phylogenetic reconstruction
or limited proteomic information to elucidate how the
subspecies of scorpion evolved accompanied with biogeographic events [26,27]. Comprehensive and accurate
information about intraspecific variation of scorpion
venom peptides and proteins is still unrevealed. In this
work, we constructed a non-normalized cDNA Library
and carried an EST approach to overview the transcriptome of the venom gland of the scorpion Lychas
mucronatus from Yunnan province. A great deal of
venom peptides and proteins belonging to known or
atypical toxin types were identified. Most high abundance toxin types were compared with previous results
conducted on Hainan-sourced population. This work
provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of
venom transcriptomes of two Lychas mucronatus
populations. The results reveal the fact that both the
primary structure and abundance of venom peptides
are quite different in the same scorpion species from
different geographical regions. Besides, transcriptomic
comparison between two populations of Lychas mucronatus also provides some clues to understand how
scorpion is reorganizing its venom toxins to adapt a
new environment in evolutionary development.

Results
Morphological comparison of two Lychas mucronatus
populations

Lychas mucronatus is one scorpion species widely
distributed in Southeast Asia. In China, they chiefly
exist in Yunnan, Guangxi and Hainan provinces. Our
group gets two populations of the scorpion Lychas
mucronatus successively from Hainan and Yunnan
provinces with distinct ecotopes (Figure 1). Based
on Kovařík and Zhu’s description [21,22], the adults of
Lychas mucronatus can be easily recognized based on
coloration and morphological characteristics as following: (1) Generally, Lychas mucronatus is 40-65 mm
long, carapace, mesosomal tergites and legs are yellow
and blotched, metasoma segments are yellow to yellowish-brown from base to terminal, pedipalp, patella is
predominantly dark, pedipalps manus is bright yellow
with sparse, minute black spots and fingers are dark yellow brown; (2) Pedipalp fingers of males are curved,
whereas those of female are straight; (3) Second segment of metasoma has 10 keels, and the third metasomal segment has 8 keels; (4) Sixth cutting edge on
movable fingers of pedipalps has 3 granules; (5) Pectinal
teeth number is 16-26 (frequently 19-23); (6) Metasoma
of males has the same length as that of females.

According to microscopic observation, both scorpion
populations we collected possess the same characters
mentioned above. So we convinced that two scorpion
populations obtained from two provinces actually
belong to the same species Lychas mucronatus.
EST sequencing and clustering

The Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus cDNA library
was constructed with the same methods as Hainansourced Lychas mucronatus [23]. Both of libraries are
not amplified, their clone number rates of different
types of venom peptides and proteins should reflect the
actual transcriptive abundance in original biological
samples. The Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus
cDNA library possessed a 2.6 × 106 cfu/ml titer with
more than 99% recombinant efficiency. In order to get
more types of peptides and proteins, we selected 1000
random colonies for sequencing which have a total of
738 readable sequences. These EST sequences were
then submitted into the dbEST (accession numbers:
GT028570-GT029307). After processed by EGassembler
online bioinformatics service [28], 738 ESTs are
assembled as 309 singletons and 71 contigs consisting of
two or more ESTs (Figure 2).
We compared the consensual cluster sequences
against SWISS-PROT and GenBank NCBI databases by
BLAST algorithms for a functional classification of
these unique sequences. 189 clusters (488 ESTs)
showed homology to existent peptides or proteins
(Expect value <e-4), whereas the other 191 clusters
(250 ESTs) hadn’t good matches (Table 1). Among
these “match” sequences, 83 clusters (414 ESTs) are
deduced to be secretory peptides and proteins. These
putative toxins and secretory venom components
represent nearly 56% of total ESTs. It is worth noticing
that neurotoxins account for 20% of the whole transcripts and peptides putative to have the antimicrobial
function account for 12%. For those “non-match”
ESTs, the longest ORFs were generally predicted and
screened for possible signal peptides. The result indicated that 25 clusters (79 ESTs) are supposed to possess a signal peptide. This part of non-matched clones
obviously a possible source for new venom peptides.
127 clusters (128 ESTs) don’t have signal peptide and
39 clusters (43 ESTs) haven’t ORF found. The total
unassigned ESTs account for 33% which is similar to
the results of other transcriptome studies [4,29]. Particular information about bioinformatical analysis of
Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus cDNA library can
be got from our submitted work “Evolution of the
scorpion venom arsenal inferred by comparative
transcriptome and molecular phylogeny analyses”
(unpublished data). The distribution of all ESTs in
both populations was depicted in Figure 3.

Known toxin types

The “-ome” approaches have already helped to reveal a
great number of scorpion venom toxin types [4,10,30].
Most of these molecules are named as known toxin
types because they have been identified for function or
at least their primary structures were reported in literature [3,31,32]. However, there always have new scorpion
venom toxins with special primary structures and unrevealed functions been reported continuously [33]. This
part of toxins is named as atypical toxin types. From the
venom gland cDNA library of the scorpion Lychas
mucronatus collected from Yunnan province, sixteen
known toxin types were obtained. They are encoded by
342 ESTs (57 clusters), accounting for approximately
46% of the total venom gland transcripts. All these
sequences possess signal peptides. Most of these types
have been identified at the protein level, whereas a few
of them are only found at the transcript level. The

particular comparison of these known toxin types from
Yunnan Lychas mucronatus and previously identified
known toxin types from Hainan Lychas mucronatus will
be detailed in subjects below (Table 2).
NaTx (toxins specific for sodium channels)

Till now, NaTx were only found in the venom of the
family Buthidae except one peptide phaiodotoxin from
the family Iuridae [34]. They are 6500-8500 Da (58-76
residues) polypeptides showing the conserved structure
core constrained by three disulfide bridges: two disulfides link the a-helix to the anti-parallel b-sheet and the
third disulfide links the b-sheet to an extended segment
preceding the helix. But the fourth disulfide bridge, also
called wrapper disulfide bridge [35], varies in position,
and sometimes is even lost. These structure-conserved
‘long-chain’ peptides are considered to be the primary
causes of the neurotoxic symptoms induced by scorpion
envenomation.

We obtained 43 NaTxs transcripts from the venom
gland cDNA library of Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus, accounting for nearly 11% of whole toxin-like
peptide sequences. These sequences were grouped in 12
clusters. According to sequence similarity and targeting
receptor site, NaTxs are assorted into two patterns:
a-NaTxs and b-NaTxs [36]. 6 clusters putative a-NaTxs
encoded by 11 ESTs were found in Yunnan-sourced
population, whereas putative b-NaTxs possess of an
obviously higher abundance which have 32 ESTs encoding 6 clusters.
One cluster of putative b-NaTxs (GT028621 and
GT028626) encoded by 16 transcripts is the most abundant NaTx cluster in Yunnan-sourced population
library. This cluster contains two almost identical
sequences differing by only two amino acids. The transcript GT028621 encodes a mature peptide of 63 amino
acid residues with 8 cysteines which would form a disulfide bridges pattern of “C-C-CX 3 C-C-CXC-C” (C,
cysteine; X, amino acids of various types). This peptide
shows homology to the beta-toxin Toxin CsEv1 identified from Centruroides sculpturatus. This homology may
indicate that the most abundant ‘long-chain’ neurotoxin
in the venom of Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus
can affect sodium channel activation by binding voltageindependently at site-4 of sodium channels. Although
the most abundant NaTx transcripts (EU159276 and
EU159292) from Hainan-sourced library have the same
cysteine pattern as GT028621, obvious diversity can be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/452

observed in primary structures. Specially, GT028621
don’t contain a basic amino acid residue at C-terminal
region, which shows that C-terminal modification would
not exist at the post-translational level.
Although no significant difference was observed in the
NaTx types from two scorpion populations of Lychas
mucronatus, the NaTxs were distinct in primary structures (Figure 4). Moreover, the abundance of NaTxs was
quite different. NaTxs account for nearly 16% of all
toxin-like peptides in Hainan-sourced population, but
11% in Yunnan-sourced population. In addition, both
scorpion populations possessed of a high abundant of
putative b-NaTxs.
a-KTx (a subfamily of toxins specific for potassium
channels)

a-KTx is widely spread in all scorpion species ever
studied. This main toxin type possesses from 25 to 45
amino acid residues well packed with three or four disulfide bridges [31]. Their conserved three-dimensional
structures are always constituted by a a-helix connected
to a two or three-stranded b-sheet [37].
In the scorpion Lychas mucronatus from Yunnan
province, we obtained 11 clusters (94 ESTs) encoded for
a-KTx. Among them, 9 clusters of putative a-KTxs are
constrained by 3 disulfide bridges, and the other 2 clusters are packed with four disulfide bridges (Figure 5).

Page 6 of 15

GT028876 represents a 3 ESTs cluster encoding a
putative a-KTx. It has a mature peptide of 42 amino
acid residues. Because of its unique primary structure,
no homologies were shown after BLAST search.
However, two clusters represented by EU163859 and
EU163857 from Hainan-sourced population show some
homology to GT028876. In respect that they have the
same cysteine pattern as those function identified
potassium channel toxins [25]. GT028876 may be a new
group of short chain K+ channel blockers.
GT028663 and GT028654 belong to the most abundant a-KTx cluster which is encoded by 70 ESTs. Both
transcripts were supposed to encode a mature peptide
with 49 amino acid residues. The mature peptides are
constrained by 4 disulfide bridges, which is distinct to
most other putative a-KTx toxins obtained from both
scorpion populations. Blast search presented homologous Tx771 putative potassium channel toxin from
Buthus occitanus Israelis and male-specific potassium
channel inhibitor IsTX from Opisthacanthus madagascariensis which was proved to be a blocker to voltagegated potassium channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.3. Surprisingly,
the highest abundant toxin type from Yunnan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus has no homologous transcript in
Hainan-sourced population. Although there is still no
clue on exact function of this a-KTx cluster, it is maybe

very important for the survival of Yunnan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus. Besides, another 2 ESTS cluster
represented by GT028917 also possesses of the same
cysteine pattern as above-mentioned sequences. These
72 ESTs form another new group of short chain K +
channel blockers together. EU163848 represents the
most abundant a-KTx cluster in Hainan-sourced population. It possesses of a 32 amino acid mature peptide
with a pI of 4.82. This 31 ESTs encoded acidic a-KTx
cluster has homologous cluster represented by
GT028769 in Yunnan-sourced population. But the abundance of these acidic putative K+ channel toxins is quite
distinct between two populations and their functions are
also to be identified.
Potassium scorpion toxins are usually classified into 4
subfamilies: a, b, g and  KTxs [13]. Each subfamily
consists of several groups. Based on similar analysis as
described before [38], GT028811 and GT029234 belong
to a-KTx12 group, GT028874 belongs to a-KTx17
group, and the other short chain KTxs constitute at
least 4 new groups. a-KTx is the most abundant toxin
type in Yunnan-sourced population. It takes parts of
nearly 23% of total toxin-like peptides, which is nearly
2-fold higher than 13% in Hainan-sourced population.
In a word, not only the primary structures, but also the
abundance of a-KTxs between two scorpion populations
displayed high diversity.

Other neurotoxins

There are two other neurotoxin types identified from
Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus. One type belongs
to b-KTx, which is previously called “orphan peptides”.
This type is constituted by a freely moving amino acid
sequence at N-terminal region and a cysteine-stabilized
ab motif at C-terminal region [39]. We obtained 4 clusters (12 ESTs) encoding b-KTx from Yunnan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus (Figure 6). The primary structures of
these long-chain K+ channel toxins show high homology
between two scorpion populations. It was worth mentioning that two transcripts GT028643 and GT028645
with only 3 amino acid residues difference in N-terminal
region were proved to be encoded by a single gene and
generated by alternative 3’ splice sites. The results of
electrophysiological experiments showed that the
recombinant protein of these two transcripts have a very
weak effect to block voltage-gated potassium channels
Kv1.1 which means the real target of these b-KTxs is
still waiting to be identified (Data preparing for publish).
They also represent the most abundant cluster of b-KTx
in the venom of Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus.
Based on similar analysis as described before [13,38],
GT028816 is a new member of b-KTx1 group, while
GT028643, GT028645 and GT028908 are new members
of b-KTx2 group. All the ESTs encoded for b-KTx in
Yunnan-sourced population take parts of 3% of whole

toxin-like peptides which is obviously less than the 7%
in Hainan-sourced population.
Till now, fewer Ca 2+ channel toxins have been
obtained from scorpion venoms [40]. This type of toxin
specific for ryanodine receptors possesses of an ICK
(inhibitory cysteine knot) motif at C-terminal region.
One EST GT029194 encoding calcine was identified
from the library of Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus.
GT029194 has an 8 amino acid residues long pro-peptide and a mature peptide of 34 amino acid residues
constrained by three disulfide bridges. FE193690 from
Hainan-sourced population has the same primary structure as GT029194, which suggests that the calcine is
conserved between two scorpion populations (Figure 7).
Both of the transcripts show the conserved cysteine pattern like Tx758 from Buthus occitanus Israelis and Opicalcine-1 from Opistophthalmus carinatus. So that,
GT029194 should be a new member of calcium channel
toxins group 1 based on similar analysis as described
before [13,38].
AMPs (antimicrobial peptides)

AMPs are a wide class of venom peptides with antimicrobial functions [8]. It is an important defensive
weapon of innate immunity for scorpion [41]. AMPs
take on great diversity in primary amino acid sequences.

Most of them are short cationic peptides [42], and are
structurally divided into three groups, namely linear
peptides with an amphipathic a-helix, cysteine-rich peptides with one or several disulfide bridges [43], and peptides with a predominance of specific amino acids such
as glycine, proline and histidine [44]. In a word, AMPs
form the first line of host defense against pathogenic
infections.
In Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus, 5 type peptides are presumed to belong to AMPs: Short cationic
antimicrobial peptides (Scamp), Ponericin-like antimicrobial peptides (Plamp), bradykinin-potentiating peptide like (bpp like), Glycine-rich peptides and Anionic
peptides.
Scamp is a type of low molecular weight peptides
belonging to the family of cationic host defense peptides
[45]. This toxic type shows homology to small linear
cationic toxins BmKb1 identified from the scorpion
Mesobuthus martensii [46]. This kind of peptide always
possesses of a conserved proline in the seventh amino
acid residue and a lysine in the C-terminal region of
mature peptide [24]. Our group had already identified
one Scamp mucroporin from the Hainan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus, which can effectively inhibit
standard bacteria, especially gram-positive bacteria.

From Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus, we obtained
2 clusters (26 ESTs) of Scamp. Among them, GT028857
shared the same primary structure as mucroporin. Actually, both two clusters of Scamp obtained from Yunnansourced Lychas mucronatus have homologous transcripts
in Hainan-sourced population venom (Figure 8). Scamp
possesses of a high abundance in both scorpion populations venom (more than 6% in Yunnan-sourced population and 9% in Hainan-sourced population).
From Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus, we
obtained 1 clusters (9 ESTs) encoded for Plamp, which
was a homologous toxin type of Ponericins identified
from ant venom with a high activeness against Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria [47]. Plamp has a
mature peptide consist of 24-25 amino acid residues,
most of which are Lys and Arg. The primary structures
of Plamps between two scorpion population are greatly

conserved (Figure 9), but its abundance in Yunnansourced population is obviously lower than Hainansourced population.
Until now, bpp like are only characterized from the
venom of family Buthidae. This type of toxin is represented by Bradykinin-potentiating peptide BmK3 identified from the scorpion Mesobuthus martensii [48]. From
Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus, we obtained 1 clusters (24 ESTs) encoded for this toxin type, represented by
GT028786. GT028786 has almost identical primary
structure like EU163895 from Hainan-sourced population (Figure 10). According to sequence alignment analysis, the N-terminal region of GT028786 shows homology
to parabutoporin which has a strong antibacterial activity
against Gram-negative bacteria and fungal [49]. As a
result, the special primary structure of scorpion bpp
like with one putative antimicrobial region at N-terminus

and the other putative Bradykinin-potentiating region at
C-terminus makes it to be a hypothetic bi-function
protein.
Glycine-rich peptides are a type of specific amino acid
predominant peptides first characterized from scorpion
by our group. In this work, 2 ESTs encoded for Glycinerich peptides were obtained from Yunnan-sourced
population (Figure 11). After a multiple sequence alignment analysis, we could find that Glycine-rich peptides
in Hainan-sourced population have more diversity and
also a higher abundance.
Anionic peptides are a type of acidic venom peptides
rich in aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues. Such
toxin type was previously obtained from both the family
Buthidae and non-Buthidae [30,50]. To the best of our
knowledge, this acidic toxin type takes a higher abundance in venom of family Buthidae than non-Buthidae.
Considering the family Buthidae possesses a higher
abundance of basic neurotoxins in venom. It may imply
that Anionic peptides play an important role in balancing the pH value of scorpion venom liquid [30]. 2 clusters (25 ESTs) encoded for Anionic peptides were
obtained from Yunnan-sourced population. Both clusters represented by GT028615 and GT028723 have
homologous transcripts in Hainan-sourced population
(Figure 12). In Hainan-sourced population, anionic peptides account for 12% of total toxin-like peptides, which
is 2-fold higher than 6% in Yunnan-sourced population.
Although there was still no consensus about the role
of AMPs in scorpion venom, they were postulated to
have the functions of protecting the scorpion from bacterial infection, depolarizing neural cells inducing

immobilization of prey and potentiating the action of
other neurotoxins within the venom [51]. 8 clusters (86
ESTs) encode for AMPs were obtained from Yunnansourced Lychas mucronatus, which accounted for 21%
of all toxin-like peptides. However, the abundance of
AMPs reached remarkable 40% in Hainan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus. The primary structure of AMPs
from Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus showed more
diversity. This comparison suggested that Hainansourced Lychas mucronatus definitely can protect itself
more effectively from microorganisms.
Other venom components

These venom components include 7 known toxin types
and nineteen atypical types of venom molecules. The 7
known toxin types are lipolysis activating peptides
(LVPs), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), serine protease from
scorpion venom (SPSV), metalloprotease, salivary protein, La1-like peptides and 8C toxin. LVPs are a group of
long chain toxins shared high homology to those NaTxs
but in defect of a cysteine. This structure makes LVPs
form an interchain disulfide bridge and exert distinct biological activity on adipocyte lipolysis [52]. 7 clusters (69
ESTs) encoding LVPs were identified from Yunnansourced Lychas mucronatus. It was worth mentioning
that LVPs were the second most abundant toxin type in
the venom of Yunnan-sourced population. It accounted
for 17% of whole toxin-like peptides far more than 3% in
Hainan-sourced population. Although the abundance of
LVPs was quite distinct in two populations, their primary
structures seemed conserved (Figure 13). PLA2, SPSV
and metalloprotease are proteinases within scorpion
venom. Their abundances are correspondingly lower

than those “common” toxin types in venom, but without
a doubt, they are very important for scorpion to prey and
digest. Salivary protein is a type of high molecular weight
protein in scorpion venom. Salivary protein was denominated for its homology to the salivary derived protein
from tick, and this type of toxins always has a mature
peptide of about 210 amino acid residues. La1 is the
most abundant toxin identified from the venom of
Liocheles australasiae [9]. But the abundance of La1-like
peptides in venom of family Buthidae is not such high,
and the accurate function of La1-like peptides is still
unknown. 8C toxin is another new type of toxin-like
peptides well packed by 4 disulfide bridges, which was
first obtained by our group. Nineteen atypical types of
venom molecules obtained from Yunnan-sourced population were seldom reported in other scorpion venoms.
The accurate function of these atypical scorpion venom
toxins is still needed to be characterized [see Additional
file 1]. Other venom components accounted for nearly
41% of whole toxin-like peptides in venom of Yunnansourced population, which is a big natural venom
resource waiting for exploring.

Discussion
Scorpion venom is a complex mixture of biologically
active peptides with diverse physiological effects [14].
Most of the peptides ever identified are disulfide-rich
neurotoxins that specifically modulate various ion channels permeability of excitable and non-excitable cells
[31]. However, more and more other venom components have been characterized recently, including antimicrobial peptides without disulfide bridges and other
functional molecules [32,53]. In order to gain further
insight into scorpion venom compositions, it is not
enough to employ routine studies by protein chemistry
always aiming at the isolation of specific active components. The introduction of powerful chromatographic
techniques, followed by primary structure determination

using automatic Edman degradation, makes it possible
to produce an overview of scorpion venom compositions. Mass spectrometry was firstly used to get the
mass fingerprinting of toxic fractions of Tityus serrulatus venom [54]. Since then, overall venom compositions
of ten scorpion species have been comprehensively
investigated at the proteome level, including eight species from the family Buthidae [14]. The powerful technique help to confirm the hypothesis that scorpion venom
is a complex mixture of various distinct proteins with
vastly abundant difference between families to families,
genus to genus and different species within a genus [9].
We chose transcriptomic approach to get an overview
of the Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus venom
because it’s not affected by the extraction of venom and
the dynamic expression of the gland or peptide maturation like proteomic approach [12]. The transcriptomic
analysis is more likely to give a comprehensive comparison of the venom compositions from two Lychas mucronatus populations.
Some evidences already displayed the phenomenon of
intraspecific diversity of scorpion venom peptides
[12,26]. According to SDS-PAGE and random amplified
polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques, the venom of
Scorpio maurus palmatus from four geographically isolated localities in Egypt was investigated. Both obvious
morphological differences and protein molecular weights
diversity were observed [55]. But the particular distinctions such as primary structure and exact abundance of
venom toxins among different populations of the same
scorpion species are not clearly clarified. As two populations of the scorpion Lychas mucronatus successively
obtained from Hainan and Yunnan provinces were
convinced to be the same species according to morphological analysis, our study conduct on the venom components of Lychas mucronatus by a transcriptome
approach may fitly figure out the question.

Ruiming et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:452
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/452

The experimental methods for constructing the venom
gland cDNA library of Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus was the same as Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus [23]. 60 adult specimens from both scorpion
populations were selected when venom gland cDNA
library was constructed. The gender difference of scorpions is basically half to half. We cut off scorpion
venom glands 2 days after extraction of their venom by
electrical stimulation. Most temporary influences such
as age, seasonal, sex, feeding behavior and time for RNA
transcription can be excluded. Nevertheless, the experimental results confirmed our hypothesis about the
diversity exist in nearly every toxin type (Table 2).
Almost all high-abundant toxin types were obtained
from two scorpion populations. Great diversity was
observed in these highly expressed venom compositions,
especially neurotoxins and AMPs. Among neurotoxins,
short chain a-KTx was highly expressed in Yunnansourced population, whereas long chain NaTx and bKTx was highly expressed in Hainan-sourced population. Particularly, a-KTx in the venom of Yunnansourced population is not only 2-fold higher abundant
than in Hainan-sourced population, but also more diversified in primary structures. GT028663 represents the
most abundant a-KTx cluster in Yunnan-sourced population, but we can not find its homologous transcripts in
the venom gland cDNA library of Hainan-sourced population. EU163848 represents the most abundant a-KTx
cluster from Hainan-sourced population. Although
EU163848 shows homology to GT028601 from Yunnansourced population, EU163848 obviously has a higher
expression level. Taken together, Yunnan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus possesses a higher abundant and
more diversified a-KTxs in venom and the homologous
transcripts of the most abundant a-KTx cluster in the
venom of Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus have a
relatively low expressed level in the venom of Yunnansourced Lychas mucronatus. All these obvious diversity
should be intricately related to scorpions’ adaption in
different environment which primarily concern the scorpions’ interaction with their prey and predators. On the
other hand, Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus possesses a higher abundance of NaTxs in venom. Because
the NaTxs can cause severe neurotoxic symptoms after
scorpion envenomation [36], Hainan-sourced Lychas
mucronatus could be a more dangerous killer, which is
more efficient for not only preying but also defensing
itself from other predators.
According to the transcriptome analysis, we can conclude that both scorpion populations possess relatively
high abundant AMPs. But it’s unexpected that the abundance of AMPs in the venom of Hainan-sourced population reached remarkable 40% of all toxin-like peptides.
Till now, more and more AMPs have been isolated and

Page 12 of 15

characterized [56,57]. AMPs can destroy bacteria, fungi,
parasites, and even some viruses [58]. They are important defensive weapons of scorpion innate immunity. So
we can assume that the high expression levels of AMPs
could protect Hainan-sourced Lychas mucronatus away
from microbial infection, and it may also implicate
other unascertained benefits for the survival of the
population.
Hainan island locates in Southern China and is separated from mainland by Qiongzhou strait. Because surrounded by South China Sea, the climate of Hainan
island is hot and humid all the year round. Yunnan
locates in southwest China and is a mountainous region,
whose rainfall is relatively less than Hainan province.
Hainan island is an excellent living environment for
Lychas mucronatus. In this biotope, Hainan-sourced
Lychas mucronatus has enough prey. But this hot and
humid environment may also bring powerful nature
enemy and more pathogenicbacteria. In a word, the distinctive living environments probably relate to the adaptive evolution of two Lychas mucronatus populations.
The dissimilarity of toxin-like peptides between two
populations was showed in Figure 14. Although two
populations of scorpion belong to the same species,
diversity of venom peptides had gradually accumulated
since Hainan island was separated from Chinese mainland 2.5 million years ago [59]. Long period isolation
doesn’t make the scorpion Lychas mucronatus change
their toxin types much in venom, but the primary structure and abundance of these toxin types change a lot
which probably related to the adaption of Lychas mucronatus in different environment. To the best of our
knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive comparative analysis of venom transcriptomes between two
populations of the same scorpion species from different
geographical regions. It provides accurate difference of
venom peptides between Lychas mucronatus from Hainan and Yunnan. Sight is no longer restricted to only
protein molecular weights and concentration, but also
the detailed diversity of primary structure and abundance. Besides, because two scorpion populations are
obtained successively from island and mainland, Lychas
mucronatus could represents a useful model system for
studying molecular evolution and biogeography. In addition, the geographical variability in the venom of the
same species also provides some clues for producing of
effective anti-venoms and understanding the symptomatology of envenomation.

Conclusions
Our work unravels a large number of venom molecules
never identified in scorpion species. The result provides
a comprehensive comparative analysis of venom transcriptomes of the same scorpion species from different

geographical regions, which thoroughly reveals the fact
that peptides and proteins of the same scorpion species
from different geographical regions are highly diversified
and the scorpion venom arsenal is a constantly evolving
system to adapt the different biotopes. We can make a
conclusion that there are far more peptides in one scorpion species venom than previous expectation considering of the geographical isolation.

Methods
cDNA library construction

The Yunnan-sourced Lychas mucronatus were collected
from Shidian county of Yunnan province in September
2008. Venom glands of 60 wild specimens were cut off
2 days after extraction of their venom by electrical stimulation [60], and ground into fine powder in liquid
nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and then mRNA was
prepared with PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation Systems
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). SuperScript™ Plasmid
System (Invitrogen) was used to construct a directional
cDNA library from 6 μg mRNA. cDNA inserts were
directionally cloned into the plasmids pSPORT 1

according to the supplier’s instructions. The recombinant
plasmids were transformed into electrocompenent cells.
Sequencing

After growing the clones overnight in appropriate Luria
Broth culture medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin, random colonies were selected in order to obtain an
unbiased overview of the venom gland transcriptome.
After overnight culture, plasmid DNA was isolated
using alkaline lysis method. Purified plasmids were single-pass sequenced on ABI 3730 automated sequencers
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Bioinformatics analysis

Phred program were used to examine the trace files of
sequenced clones, the cutoff Phred score was set to 40
as before [30,61]. Vector and adaptor sequences were
removed using the program Cross Match. After removing the PolyA tail, we discarded those sequences shorter
than 100 nt. High-quality sequences were processed on
the website EGassembler http://egassembler.hgc.jp/ with
the default parameter [28]. The resulted sequences were
deposited into the dbEST. Each cluster was annotated

by being searched against SWISS-PROT http://www.
expasy.org/tools/blast/ and GenBank NCBI database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast using BLAST algorithms with an e-value cut-off set to <10 -4 . After
BLAST search, the unmatched clusters were further
identified for open reading frames using the ORFfinder
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/. Considering
the extreme diversity of scorpion toxins, those clusters
putative to encode venom peptides was re-examined
manually to pick out individual different isoforms. All
clusters were checked for the existence of signal peptides using the SignalP 3.0 program http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/services/SignalP/ [62]. All the sequence alignment
was performed by Clustal_X 1.83 software followed
by manual adjustment [63], and viewed by the software
Jalview [64].
