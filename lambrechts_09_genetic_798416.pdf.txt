Abstract
Background: Several observations support the hypothesis that vector-driven selection plays an
important role in shaping dengue virus (DENV) genetic diversity. Clustering of DENV genetic
diversity at a particular location may reflect underlying genetic structure of vector populations,
which combined with specific vector genotype × virus genotype (G × G) interactions may promote
adaptation of viral lineages to local mosquito vector genotypes. Although spatial structure of vector
polymorphism at neutral genetic loci is well-documented, existence of G × G interactions between
mosquito and virus genotypes has not been formally demonstrated in natural populations. Here we
measure G × G interactions in a system representative of a natural situation in Thailand by
challenging three isofemale families from field-derived Aedes aegypti with three contemporaneous
low-passage isolates of DENV-1.
Results: Among indices of vector competence examined, the proportion of mosquitoes with a
midgut infection, viral RNA concentration in the body, and quantity of virus disseminated to the
head/legs (but not the proportion of infected mosquitoes with a disseminated infection) strongly
depended on the specific combinations of isofemale families and viral isolates, demonstrating
significant G × G interactions.
Conclusion: Evidence for genetic specificity of interactions in our simple experimental design
indicates that vector competence of Ae. aegypti for DENV is likely governed to a large extent by G
× G interactions in genetically diverse, natural populations. This result challenges the general
relevance of conclusions from laboratory systems that consist of a single combination of mosquito
and DENV genotypes. Combined with earlier evidence for fine-scale genetic structure of natural
Ae. aegypti populations, our finding indicates that the necessary conditions for local DENV
adaptation to mosquito vectors are met.

Background
Dengue viruses (DENV) are mosquito-borne viruses
which, like many RNA viruses, exhibit substantial genetic
diversity [1]. This diversity can be hierarchically organized
in large clusters of lineages sometimes termed 'genotypes'
(the terms lineage and genotype will be used interchangeably hereafter) within each one of the four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4) [2]. In the last 200 years, the
number of DENV lineages worldwide has been increasing
exponentially [3], along with increasing epidemic frequency and occurrence of severe forms of the disease
[4,5]. Dengue is now the most common human arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) disease and a major public
health threat [6]. Although DENV genetic variation alone
is not sufficient to completely explain the incidence of
severe disease or the magnitude of outbreaks, there is
compelling evidence for differences in virulence and epidemic potential among DENV lineages (reviewed in [2]).
Understanding the evolutionary processes shaping the
increasing diversity of DENV lineages will, therefore, provide important insights into the mechanisms regulating
epidemics and pathogenicity associated with genetic variation among viruses [1].
The spatial distribution of DENV genetic diversity generally reveals a population structure whereby geographic
subdivisions reflect greater gene flow within than between
subdivisions (reviewed in [7]). Results from a recent study
indicated that such a genetic structure can be observed on
a fine spatial grid [8]; phylogenetic differences were
detected among DENV isolates recovered from schools
separated by only a few kilometers in rural Thailand.
Although multiple DENV lineages co-circulated within
individual schools, there was strong genetic differentiation among lineages between schools that remained stable over the 10-month sampling period [8]. Thus, despite
frequent viral migration into the area, individual schools
located a few kilometers apart represented distinct DENV
evolutionary entities. A fundamental unanswered question concerns the relative influence of natural selection
(adaptive evolution) and genetic drift (neutral evolution)
on the genetic structure of DENV populations [9].
Although it is clear that stochastic processes play a significant role in shaping DENV genetic diversity [10,11],
genetic signatures of adaptive evolution have been recurrently detected in natural DENV isolates [12-16].
Among evolutionary forces actively driving the evolution
of arboviruses, vector-driven selection may play an important role by selecting lineages that are better suited for
mosquito transmission [9]. For instance, the emergence of
chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Indian Ocean in 2004,
and subsequent spread to India and Europe was attributed
to the acquisition of a single adaptive mutation that
enhances transmission efficiency by Aedes albopictus
[17,18]. This mutation confers a selective advantage in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/160

locations where Ae. albopictus predominates over Ae.
aegypti, which is usually considered the primary vector of
CHIKV. Similarly, the emergence of a new lineage of West
Nile virus in North America was attributed to earlier and
more efficient transmission by Culex mosquitoes relative
to the lineage that initially colonized this part of the world
[19]. DENV are no exception in this regard. Displacement
of the American (AM) DENV-2 genotype by a Southeast
Asian (SA) DENV-2 genotype in the Western Hemisphere
was associated with more efficient infection and dissemination in Ae. aegypti of the SA than AM genotype [20-22].
Likewise, an invasive DENV-3 isolate from Sri Lanka
infected and disseminated more efficiently in Ae. aegypti
mosquitoes than a displaced, native DENV-3 isolate [23].
Interestingly, in both DENV examples above, outcompeted genotypes tended to cause mild disease whereas
invasive genotypes correlated with more severe disease
manifestations. This supports the view that enhanced vector transmission, among other factors, may contribute to
the evolutionary success of lineages that are more virulent
to humans [2].
The potential role of vector-driven selection in DENV evolution raises the question whether the genetic structure of
DENV populations reflects, at least partly, that of their
vectors. Indeed, Ae. aegypti distribution consists of a
patchwork of genetically differentiated populations [2427]. Because the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for
DENV is in part genetically determined (reviewed in
[28]), it has been hypothesized that the structure of DENV
populations may partly result from the adaptation of
viruses to the local vector genotypes [9]. Under this
hypothesis, DENV transmission would be more efficient
by local vector genotypes (sympatric vector-virus pairs)
than by vector genotypes from distant populations (allopatric vector-virus pairs). Pathogen adaptation to local
hosts has been reported in a variety of systems (reviewed
in [29]), including malaria parasites and their mosquito
vectors [30]. Evolution of local adaptation has been predicted when the pathogen has an evolutionary advantage
over the host, such as higher mutation rate, shorter generation time, higher migration rate, and larger population
size [31-33]. These conditions could undoubtedly apply
to the DENV-Ae. aegypti system [9].
An additional necessary condition for the occurrence of
DENV local adaptation to Ae. aegypti is that the genetic
structure of mosquito populations must be coupled with
some degree of genetic specificity of vector-virus compatibility. In other words, DENV transmission by Ae. aegypti
must be determined, at least partly, by genotype × genotype (G × G) interactions. Such G × G interactions,
whereby the infection outcome depends on the specific
combination of host and pathogen genotypes, are found
in many systems [34]. The effects of vector and virus genotypes, independently, on DENV transmission by Ae.

aegypti are well-documented. Variation in vector competence for a reference DENV isolate among different geographic strains of Ae. aegypti has been repeatedly reported
[35-38], and can often be directly correlated to genetic differences [39,40]. Reciprocally, DENV isolates have been
shown to vary in their infectivity to a given mosquito
strain [20,22]. Results from an earlier study showing some
degree of interaction specificity between laboratory strains
of mosquitoes and DENV serotypes and isolates [41] and
from another study where SA genotypes of DENV-2 performed better than AM genotypes in two field-derived
populations of Ae. aegypti, but not in a laboratory adapted
colony [21] were suggestive of genetic specificity of vectorvirus compatibility. However, the occurrence of G × G
interactions between DENV and Ae. aegypti has not been
formally quantified in natural populations.
Here, we measured the extent of G × G interactions
between DENV and mosquito genotypes that are naturally
interacting in the field. We challenged three Ae. aegypti
isofemale families derived from a wild population sampled in 2007 in Ratchaburi, Thailand with three low-passage DENV-1 viruses that were isolated the same year from
humans (in Bangkok, Kamphaeng Phet, and Ratchaburi,
respectively). Following standard methods of quantitative
genetics [34], we estimated the extent to which the outcome of the infection is determined by G × G interactions
by measuring the statistical effect of isofemale family ×
virus isolate interactions on several indices of vector competence, defined as the intrinsic permissiveness of a vector
to become infected and subsequently transmit a pathogen
[42].

virus titers in the blood meals were remarkably similar
across isolates and experimental blocks, with all titers
ranging within a third of a log unit per ml (Table 1). This
allowed us to assume that most of the phenotypic differences observed between isolates were due to genetic differences. Across families and isolates, 63.1% of females
were infected, and 42.9% had a disseminated infection.
Isofemale families differed significantly in wing length
(S.S. = 0.052, F2,57 = 3.85, P = 0.027), indicating significant genetic variation in body size. The mean wing length
(± SE) was 3.11 ± 0.018, 3.08 ± 0.018, and 3.04 ± 0.018
mm for families A, B, and C, respectively. Corresponding
mean age at pupation (± SE) was 7.29 ± 0.035, 7.15 ±
0.037, and 7.28 ± 0.033 days, respectively. Although three
data points are not enough to obtain a valid correlation, it
is worth noting that the overall proportion of infected
mosquitoes by family tended to be negatively correlated
with their mean wing length (linear regression: R2 = 0.97,
P = 0.102), supporting the view that larger females are
more resistant to dengue infection than small females
[43].

Results

Two factors had a significant influence on end-point mortality of adult mosquitoes at 14 days post-infection (dpi).
Mortality significantly differed between blocks (S.S. =
0.245, F1,4 = 19.5, P = 0.012), and marginally significantly
between virus isolates (S.S. = 0.178, F2,4 = 7.08, P = 0.049).
Although 5.8% of females in the first block died before 14
dpi, 16.3% of females in the second block did so, possibly
due to the one-day age difference. Across blocks, endpoint mortality was 5.3%, 11.1%, and 16.1% for the KPP,
BKK, and RTB isolates, respectively. Mortality did not
depend on the family-isolate combinations (S.S. = 0.131,
F4,4 = 2.62, P = 0.19).

Overall, vector competence was scored in 333 female Ae.
aegypti. Each combination of isofemale family and virus
isolate was represented by 28–53 individuals (mean = 37,
median = 36) divided into two experimental blocks of
11–28 individuals (mean = 18.5, median = 19). The three
DENV-1 isolates used in this study were collected within a
one-month period at three locations in Thailand (Bangkok: BKK, Kamphaeng Phet: KPP, and Ratchaburi: RTB)
and had identical passage histories (Table 1). Estimated

The proportion of infected mosquitoes strongly depended
on the family, the isolate, and most importantly in the
context of this study, their interaction (Table 2a; Figure
1a). The percentage of infected mosquitoes ranged from
30.2% to 100% among family-isolate combinations. The
interaction effect appeared to be mainly due to the combination of the RTB isolate and mosquito family B for
which the proportion of infected mosquitoes was lower

than would have been expected from examination of the
other combinations (Figure 1a). Because the family × isolate × block three-way interaction was not statistically significant, our results indicated that the effect of the family
× isolate interaction was consistent across blocks (Table

blood meal titer between blocks did not affect the probability of infection in a given mosquito-virus combination.

tion was not statistically significant, possibly due to variation between experimental blocks as indicated by the
significant family × isolate × block three-way interaction
(Table 1b). Moreover, exclusion of the 123 uninfected
mosquitoes reduced statistical power of this analysis.

tence we examined (midgut infection success, viral RNA
concentration in bodies, virus titer in head/legs) were at
least partly determined by the specific combination of
mosquito family and virus isolate. The use of a randomized complete block design allowed us to rule out the
possibility of environmental bias by confirming the consistency of family × isolate interactions effect across experimental blocks.

Viral RNA concentrations in the body of infected mosquitoes and the number of fluorescent focus units (FFUs) in
the head/legs of mosquitoes with a disseminated infection varied substantially among family-isolate combinations, with varying ranking orders of viral isolates for each
isofemale family (Figure 2). Both variables were significantly influenced by the family × isolate interaction, with
no significant difference between experimental blocks
(Table 3). Regardless of their ranking order in a given
mosquito family, the general profile of each isolate shared
some degree of similarity between viral RNA concentration and numbers of disseminated FFUs (Figure 2), possibly reflecting differing viral growth capacities in different
mosquito genetic backgrounds. Viral RNA concentration
in infected mosquitoes did not appear to be correlated to
the proportion of infected mosquitoes or the proportion
of mosquitoes with a disseminated infection, indicating
that the probability of these events may be largely independent of the efficiency of viral genome replication.

Our conclusions are based on the premise that family ×
isolate interactions reliably approximate G × G interactions [34]; i.e., in our design observed phenotypic differences truly reflect the underlying genetic differences
between mosquitoes and viruses. The use of isofemale
families to assess the genetic basis of a trait assumes that
the ratio of among- to within-families variations is proportionate to the heritable variation for that trait [44].
This assumption is reasonable as long as environmental
variation in rearing conditions or parental effects do not
differ between families. We ensured homogeneity by
maintaining the F0-F2 parental generations under standard laboratory conditions and rearing the F3 individuals
under strictly identical conditions. Non-genetic differences in virus infectivity were minimized by growing the
viruses simultaneously under the same conditions and
exposing mosquitoes to very similar blood meal titers
(Table 1). Uncontrolled, slight differences in blood meal
titers did not appear to influence results. For instance, the
RTB isolate produced the highest average values across
families for all vector competence indices, although the
BKK isolate had the highest blood meal titers in both

Discussion
Results of our experiment strongly support the hypothesis
that vector competence of Ae. aegypti for DENV-1 is governed by G × G interactions. With the exception of virus

experimental blocks. Although virus amplification in cell
culture may have imposed a selective pressure on the original viruses, the low number of passages allowed us to
assume that we still had isolates representative of wildtype viral genetic diversity. Overall, it seemed reasonable
to conclude that our approach provided a reliable estimate of G × G interactions in this system.
It is remarkable that we were able to detect G × G interactions using a very restricted experimental design (three
mosquito families × three virus isolates). Observing a
highly significant effect of the interaction term with limited statistical power indicates that G × G interactions
likely represent a strong determinant of vector competence in natural Ae. aegypti populations, which display a
much higher level of genetic polymorphism than was captured by our three isofemale families sampled at a single
location. We expect G × G interactions to be even more
prominent when mosquito genotypes from more genetically distinct populations are examined. Indeed, a nested
analysis of Ae. aegypti mitochondrial haplotype frequencies in Thailand showed that while 57% of the total variation was found within collections, 18% and 25% of that
variation were found among samples collected within a
distance of 25 km and more than 100 km apart, respectively [25]. Moreover, because the three DENV-1 isolates
used in this study were all collected in Thailand in 2007,
it is likely that they are closely genetically related. We

expect that G × G interactions will occur to a greater extent
when the analysis includes more distantly related viral lineages or even different serotypes.
A practical implication of our results is that the conclusions drawn from one particular vector-virus combination
(such as one mosquito population challenged with a reference DENV isolate) are not likely to be representative of
other combinations. This challenges the broad-scale relevance of genetic loci associated with vector competence
that were identified in laboratory-tractable systems. A
recent meta-analysis showed that quantitative trait loci
(QTL) controlling host resistance against one pathogen
isolate were on average recovered in only 24% of the cases
where infections with different isolates were investigated;
i.e., each particular host-pathogen combination was
based on a different set of QTL and epistatic interactions
[45]. G × G interactions may help to explain why the QTL
controlling midgut infection by a Jamaican DENV-2 isolate in highly selected lines of Ae. aegypti [46,47] did not
correlate with those previously identified in field-derived
Ae. aegypti challenged with a Puerto Rican DENV-2 isolate
[48]. Likewise, it sheds a new light on a study where
DENV-2 isolates of the SA genotype performed better than
isolates of the AM genotype in two field-derived Ae.
aegypti populations, but not in a laboratory-adapted colony [21].

Although additional studies are warranted to confirm the
impact of G × G interactions on actual virus transmission
through an infectious bite, their occurrence during DENV
incubation in Ae. aegypti provides important insights into
the mechanisms shaping DENV population structure and
evolution. It helps to explain why despite strong genetic
bottlenecks during mosquito transmission, major DENV
variants are generally conserved in both vertebrate and
arthropod hosts [49,50]. Indeed, G × G interactions indicate that elimination of viruses that are incompatible with
local mosquito genotypes may counteract the effect of
genetic drift in the form of purifying selection at the population level. Likewise, the observed spatial clustering of
DENV lineages on a restricted spatial scale [8] may in fact
be promoted by location-specific vector-driven selection.
Over time, genetic specificity of vector-virus compatibility
would combine with the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti
populations to drive the adaptation of DENV to increased
compatibility with local mosquito genotypes [9]. Interestingly, it is worth noting that in our experiment, while the
three isofemale vector families were derived from samples
collected in Ratchaburi, all of the vector competence indices were highest, on average, for the viral isolate from that
same location (RTB). Although this does not constitute
firm evidence for local adaptation of DENV, it is consistent with the hypothesis that DENV transmission may be
achieved with greater success by sympatric than by allopatric vector-virus pairs. Inclusion of mosquito families
from different populations in a similar design will help to
more definitively address this question. Future research
using multiple replicates of sympatric and allopatric pairs
will determine the extent of local adaptation in this system. It is clear that factors other than vector-mediated
population structure contribute to the evolution of certain
DENV lineages; i.e., 'cosmopolitan' genotypes that are
found across broad geographical distributions. We speculate, however, that to some extent the spatial organization
of DENV populations may reflect the geographical distribution of Ae. aegypti genotypes, which would be similar to
what was demonstrated (at the species level) for Mexican
populations of Plasmodium vivax and their Anopheles vectors [30].

Conclusion
We demonstrate that the vector competence of Ae. aegypti
for DENV-1 is determined by G × G interactions in which
potential for mosquito infection and virus transmission
depends on the specific combination of vector and virus
genotypes. This observation challenges the general relevance of genetic loci controlling vector competence that
were identified using a single combination of mosquito
and virus genotypes. The combination of G × G interactions and spatial genetic structure of vector populations is
consistent with the potential for DENV adaptation to local
vectors. Mosquito vector-driven selection may play a more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/160

important role in DENV microevolution than previously
thought.

Because we wanted to (i) use a representative sample of a
natural mosquito population and (ii) minimize parental
effects due to the variability in environmental conditions
[51], we used F3 isofemale families of Ae. aegypti generated
from field-sampled immatures (larvae and pupae) raised
for two generations in the laboratory. Isofemale families
consist of the progeny of individual females. They are classically used in studies of quantitative genetics to investigate the genetic basis of a trait (e.g., [52]). Although Ae.
aegypti females can mate multiple times, they are thought
to be monandrous due to male accessory gland proteins
that are transferred during copulation and induce subsequent sexual refractoriness [53]. Based on the assumption
that sibs are genetically more similar than non-sibs, one
can estimate the extent to which a trait has a genetic basis
by comparing the phenotypic variations observed within
and between families [44]. Using this approach genetic
effects are confounded with potential maternal effects,
which can be controlled by rearing the parental generations under standard homogenous conditions. Our experiment was based on a reciprocal cross-infection design
involving three Ae. aegypti isofemale families and three
DENV-1 isolates. The experiment was duplicated in two
separate experimental blocks by splitting F3 mosquitoes
from the same batch into two groups and infecting each
group on two successive days with the same viral culture
harvested one day apart. This procedure allowed us to
assess the repeatability of results while controlling for nuisance factors introduced by duplication of the experiment
(e.g., mosquito age, virus titer). We measured G × G interactions with the statistical effect of the family × isolate
two-way interaction on vector competence [34]. We estimated the repeatability of the results with the statistical
significance of the family × isolate × block three-way interaction as an indication of the degree of consistency of the
two-way interaction effect across blocks.
Mosquitoes
The F0 generation was initiated with a large number
(>1,500) of immatures collected from multiple (3–6) artificial containers in each of 10–12 households in Don
Thako, Muang district, Ratchaburi (Thailand) during September 2007. Adults were allowed to emerge in the laboratory, mate randomly, and feed on anesthetized hamsters
as a blood source. Eggs were collected and stored on dry
pieces of paper towel maintained under high humidity.
Mosquitoes in F1-F3 generations were raised under standard insectary conditions at 27 ± 1°C, high humidity, and
under 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. Eggs were hatched synchronously by placing them under low pressure for 30

min and larvae were reared in 25 × 40 cm plastic trays
filled with 1.5 l of deionized water at a density of approximately 200 individuals per tray. F1-F2 larvae were fed on
a 1:1 mix of ground puppy chow and bovine liver powder
(0.05 g/tray on days 0, 1, and 2; 0.1 g/tray on day 3; 0.2 g/
tray on day 4; 0.3 g/tray on day 5; and 0.2/tray on days 6
and 7). Adults were housed in large cages with permanent
access to 10% sucrose. F1 females were fed on defibrinated
sheep blood (Quad Five, Ryegate, MT) through pieces of
desalted porcine intestine stretched over water-jacketed
glass feeders. F2 females were allowed to mate randomly
for three days and then housed individually. They were
daily offered a blood meal on a human arm and allowed
to lay eggs on wet filter papers. In order to obtain a large
number of F3 females in each family, egg batches from
multiple (4–6) gonotrophic cycles were combined and
hatched simultaneously. F3 larvae were reared at a low
density (approximately 125 per tray) to maximize their
survival. Larvae of each family were reared in several trays
that were moved daily at random between the shelves of
the insectary to minimize any uncontrolled environmental variation. They were fed on a 1:1 mix of ground puppy
chow and bovine liver powder (0.02 g/tray on day 0; 0.04
g/tray on day 1; 0.06 g/tray on day 2; 0.08 g/tray on day 3;
0.1 g/tray on day 4; 0.2 g/tray on day 5; and 0.1/tray on
days 6 and 7). Female body size was estimated for each F3
isofemale family by measuring the wing lengths of a random sample of 20 individuals per family. Wings were
measured from the tip (excluding the fringe) to the distal
end of the alula with a precision of ± 0.01 mm using a dissecting microscope equipped with a micrometer. All
experimental infections were conducted using F3 females.
Infection
We used three DENV-1 isolates that were recovered during
July-August 2007 as part of routine surveillance diagnostic
procedures at the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) Bangkok laboratory from the
serum of clinically ill dengue patients attending hospitals
in Bangkok, Ratchaburi, and Kamphaeng Phet. Each diagnostic isolate underwent a strictly identical passage history (Table 1). Five passages in cell culture was the
minimum number required to obtain a titer sufficiently
high to infect mosquitoes orally using an artificial blood
meal. Confluent cultures of Ae. albopictus cells (C6/36,
ATCC #CRL-1660) in 6-well plates were inoculated with
virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and incubated
at 28°C under 5% CO2. Half of the supernatant was
replaced with fresh medium 7 dpi. Cells and medium
were harvested at 11 and 12 dpi to prepare the infectious
blood meal of experimental blocks 1 and 2, respectively.
The blood meal consisted of 1:1 mix of defibrinated sheep
blood (Quad Five) and virus suspension. Three- to sixday-old (block 1) and four- to seven-day-old adult mosquitoes (block 2) deprived of sucrose for 24 hours were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/160

offered an infectious blood meal for 30 min via membrane feeding as described above. Samples of the blood
meal were saved for subsequent viral titration by fluorescent focus assay (FFA) in C6/36 cells [54]. Preliminary trials showed that there was no detectable decrease in blood
meal titer over a period of 30 min. After feeding, mosquitoes were briefly knocked-down with CO2 and fully
engorged females were transferred to paper cups and held
in a Precision incubator at 27 ± 1°C and under 12:12 hour
light:dark cycle and supplied with 10% sucrose ad libitum.
High humidity in the incubator was maintained with containers filled with water.
Vector competence
The intrinsic ability of mosquitoes to transmit DENV was
assessed 14 dpi with two standard phenotypes used in
vector competence studies: (i) midgut infection and (ii)
viral dissemination from the midgut to other tissues. Midgut infection was determined by detecting the presence of
virus in mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen). Viral
dissemination was determined by detection of virus in
mosquito legs and heads. Virus titers in the head and the
legs of the same individual were strongly correlated
among infected mosquitoes (linear regression: R2 = 0.522,
P < 0.0001). We, therefore, used their average in the quantitative analyses of virus dissemination. We used both categorical (infection and dissemination status) and
continuous measures (viral RNA concentration in bodies,
virus titer in heads/legs) of vector competence components. We also recorded the proportion of dead mosquitoes at 14 dpi to account for any differential mortality
between experimental groups. Mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO),
and their legs and heads were removed individually and
transferred separately into 0.5 ml of mosquito diluent
(MD), consisting of 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) with 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 μg/ml
gentamicin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. The remainder of
the mosquito bodies were placed individually into 0.7 ml
of MD, and all samples were stored at -80°C before
processing. Samples were thawed on ice and homogenized in a mixer mill (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 24 cycles/
sec for 2 min. Infected bodies were screened by TaqMan®
quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Although viral RNA molecules are not equivalent to infectious virions, our conservative qRT-PCR detection threshold (104 viral RNA
copies per sample, see below) allowed us to consider that
positive bodies contained >1 infectious virion because
viral RNA copy numbers are 100- to 10,000-fold higher
than virus titers [21,55]. Disseminated infections in the
heads and legs of mosquitoes whose body was positive by
qRT-PCR was determined by FFA in green monkey kidney
cells (Vero cells, ATCC #CCL-81) as described in [54].
Mosquitoes whose bodies were negative by qRT-PCR were

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:160

considered uninfected and their legs and heads were not
processed further. We verified the validity of the screening
scheme by confirming that the bodies, legs, and heads of
a random sub-sample of individuals negative by qRT-PCR
were also negative by FFA.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Viral RNA was quantified in mosquito bodies by a serotype-specific, one-step TaqMan® qRT-PCR method modified from [56]. Briefly, RNA was extracted and purified
using a semi-automated Prism 6100 Nucleic Acid Prepstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A sample of
300 μl of each mosquito homogenate was pre-filtered and
lysed with 300 μl of 2× Nucleic Acid Purification Solution,
and 500 μl of the resulting lysate was deposited in a Purification Tray. Isolated RNA was washed once with 500 μl
of Wash Buffer 1, once with 500 μl of Wash Buffer 2, twice
with 300 μl of Wash Buffer 2, and finally eluted in 60 μl
of Elution Solution. qRT-PCR was carried out in 96-well
plates with a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems) using a TaqMan® One-Step RT-PCR Master
Mix Reagents kit (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was
assayed in a 50 μl reaction containing 10 μl of RNA template, 0.5 μM of forward primer, 1 μM of reverse primer,
and 0.25 μM of fluorogenic DENV-1 specific probe. Forward and reverse primer sequences NS5F and NS5R
reported in [56] were used to generate an amplicon of 104
bp within the NS5 gene. The dual-labeled DENV-1 specific probe sequence used in this study (5'-[6-FAM]-CTCAGAGACATATCAAAGATTCCAGC-[BHQ1]-3') was slightly
modified from the DSQ1 sequence reported in [56] so
that the target region of the NS5 gene was strictly identical
among our three isolates (as confirmed by sequencing).
The thermal profile consisted of an RT step at 48°C for 30
min, 10 min of Taq polymerase activation at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of PCR with 30 sec of denaturation at
95°C and 1 min of annealing/extension at 60°C. RNA
solutions of known concentration were synthesized by in
vitro transcription (IVT) and used as RNA standards for
absolute quantification across plates [56]. A standard RTPCR was carried out on viral genomic RNA using a forward primer including a T7 promoter sequence. The T7
forward primer sequence was the IVT NS5F sequence
reported in [56] and the reverse primer sequence was the
cFD4 sequence reported in [57]. PCR products were
cleaned up using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) and 1 μg of DNA was subjected to IVT using the T7
MAXIscript IVT kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) to generate a
transcript of 480 bp containing the target NS5 region. IVT
products were treated with TurboDNase (Ambion) at
37°C for 15 min and RNA was cleaned using the RNeasy
MinElute kit (Qiagen). RNA was re-suspended in DEPCtreated water and molecular concentration was calculated
by converting the optical density at 260 nm into the
molecular copy number [56]. Solutions of concentrations

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/160

ranging from 107 to 101 RNA copies/μl were aliquoted and
stored at -80°C until used to generate a standard curve for
each TaqMan® plate. Baseline fluorescence was set automatically to account for differing starting RNA quantities
between samples. The threshold level of fluorescence for
threshold cycle (Ct) determination was optimized manually so that the slope of the standard curve was as close as
possible to the theoretical value -3.32 which corresponds
to 100% PCR efficiency. Positive and negative controls
were included on each plate. For all plates the standard
curve had an R2 > 0.985 and the detection limit was 103
RNA copies/μl; i.e., 104 RNA copies per 10 μl of RNA template.
Fluorescent focus assay
Virus titers were quantified using a tissue-culture assay
based on immuno-fluorescent detection of infectious foci
developing in cell monolayers [54]. Blood meal titers
were assayed in C6/36 cells to provide a relevant estimate
of viral infectivity to mosquito cells, whereas virus titers in
mosquito heads and legs were assayed in Vero cells
because we were interested in the eventual infectivity to a
mammalian host. Cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with 4,500 mg/l of Dglucose and L-glutamine (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate, 100
U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Eight-well
chambered slides were seeded with Vero or C6/36 cells at
a density of 2.5 × 105 or 5.0 × 106 cells/well, respectively,
and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C (Vero) or 28°C (C6/
36) under 5% CO2, to produce a confluent monolayer.
Ten-fold serial dilutions of blood meal samples or head/
legs homogenates were inoculated onto cell monolayers
in a final volume of 50 μl/well. Viral adsorption was
allowed to proceed for one hour at 37°C (Vero) or 28°C
(C6/36) under 5% CO2, rocking the slides every 15 min.
At the conclusion of the adsorption, an overlay of growth
medium with 5% FBS, and 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose
(CMC, Sigma-Aldrich) was added in a final volume of 0.5
ml/well. DENV infectious foci develop faster in Vero than
in C6/36 cells [54]. After an incubation of 48 hours at
37°C (Vero) or 72 hours at 28°C (C6/36) under 5% CO2,
the overlay medium was removed from the infected monolayers and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS.
Infected monolayers were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold
absolute methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and washed once
with PBS. Slides were incubated for one hour with a
mouse anti-dengue complex primary antibody clone D32H2-9-21 (Millipore, Temecula, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS
containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA 0.2%).
After three washes in PBS-BSA 0.2%, slides were incubated
for 30 min with a goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated
secondary antibody (Millipore) diluted 1:50 in PBS-BSA
0.2%, followed by three washes in PBS-BSA 0.2% and a
final wash in distilled water. Cells were mounted in

Data analysis
We first analyzed differences in body size between isofemale families by comparing wing lengths using a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Then, because our experiment fulfilled the characteristics of a randomized complete block design [58], we used full-factorial analyses
including the factors mosquito family, virus isolate, experimental block, and all their interactions. Categorical variables (infection and dissemination status) were analyzed
with multi-way logistic nominal regressions, whereas continuous variables (viral RNA concentration in bodies,
virus titer in heads/legs, mortality) were analyzed with
multi-way ANOVAs. In order to satisfy the assumptions of
the statistical tests (in particular, normality of the residuals), we used a logarithmic transformation of viral RNA
concentrations and virus titers and an arcsine-transformation of mortalities. The proportion of mosquitoes with a
disseminated infection and concentration of viral RNA in
bodies were analyzed among infected mosquitoes (i.e.,
excluding uninfected mosquitoes). The average virus titer
of heads and legs was analyzed among mosquitoes with a
disseminated infection (i.e., excluding mosquitoes that
did not have a disseminated infection). Differences were
considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with the software JMP version 5.1.2 http://www.jmpdiscovery.com.
