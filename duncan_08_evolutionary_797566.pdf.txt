Abstract
Background: Gene clusters, such as the Hox gene cluster, are known to have critical roles in development. In
eukaryotes gene clusters arise primarily by tandem gene duplication and divergence. Genes within a cluster are often coregulated, providing selective pressure to maintain the genome organisation, and this co-regulation can result in temporal
or spatial co-linearity of gene expression. It has been previously noted that in Drosophila melanogaster, three of the four
runt-domain (RD) containing genes are found in a relatively tight cluster on chromosome 1, raising the possibility of a
putative functional RD gene cluster in D. melanogaster.
Results: To investigate the possibility of such a gene cluster, orthologues of the Drosophila melanogaster RD genes were
identified in several endopterygotan insects, two exopterygotan insects and two non-insect arthropods. In all insect
species four RD genes were identified and orthology was assigned to the Drosophila sequences by phylogenetic analyses.
Although four RD genes were found in the crustacean D. pulex, orthology could not be assigned to the insect sequences,
indicating independent gene duplications from a single ancestor following the split of the hexapod lineage from the
crustacean lineage.
In insects, two chromosomal arrangements of these genes was observed; the first a semi-dispersed cluster, such as in
Drosophila, where lozenge is separated from the core cluster of three RD genes often by megabases of DNA. The second
arrangement was a tight cluster of the four RD genes, such as in Apis mellifera.
This genomic organisation, particularly of the three core RD genes, raises the possibility of shared regulatory elements.
In situ hybridisation of embryonic expression of the four RD genes in Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee A. mellifera
shows no evidence for either spatial or temporal co-linearity of expression during embryogenesis.
Conclusion: All fully sequenced insect genomes contain four RD genes and orthology can be assigned to these genes
based on similarity to the D. melanogaster protein sequences. Examination of the genomic organisation of these genes
provides evidence for a functional RD gene cluster. RD genes from non-insect arthropods are also clustered, however
the lack of orthology between these and insect RD genes suggests this cluster is likely to have resulted from a duplication
event independent from that which created the insect RD gene cluster. Analysis of embryonic RD gene expression in
two endopterygotan insects, A. mellifera and D. melanogaster, did not show evidence for coordinated gene expression,
therefore while the functional significance of this gene cluster remains unknown its maintenance during insect evolution
implies some functional significance to the cluster.

Background
Runt-domain (RD) containing proteins are transcriptional regulators that are able to activate or repress transcription dependent on the biological context of the cell
[1] and are involved in cell fate specification and cell differentiation during development in metazoans [2]. The
RD, a DNA binding domain, consists of a 128 amino acid
motif that mediates DNA binding, heterodimerisation
with a -subunit (similar to the mammalian CBF proteins) [3] and also nucleotide binding [4] Outside of the
RD itself, the only conserved motif in this protein family
is a C-terminal pentapeptide (VWRPY, or I/LWRPF) which
is thought to mediate the interaction with the transcriptional co-repressor Groucho [5].
The number of RD genes reported in metazoan genomes
varies, and it is generally acknowledged that the RD genes
have been independently duplicated in the chordate and
insect lineages [6,7]. Studies of sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) runt and the mammalian runt orthologues
Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 have shown that RD proteins
play an essential role in actively cycling cells and regulate
cell proliferation prior to terminal differentiation [8]. All
three RD proteins in humans are associated with disease,
particularly cancer. Runx1, for example, is required for
haematopoiesis and mutations in this gene cause leukaemia. Runx2 is required for bone development, and Runx3
for growth and differentiation of the gastric epithelium
[8]. The Caenorhabditis elegans and S. purpuratus runt genes
are also expressed in the gut [9,10], implying that runx3
may be the ancestral runx gene in chordates [2], although
this is not supported by molecular data [6].
The number of RD genes found in ecdysozoan genomes
also varies, with a single RD gene in C. elegans, and three
in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae [6]. In Drosophila, four
RD genes are present in the genome: runt and lozenge,
which have been very well characterised and two uncharacterised RD containing genes, CG42267 (previously
CG15455) and CG34145 [6].
In Drosophila, runt is involved in many developmental
processes, including embryonic segmentation [11,12], sex
determination [13,14] and neurogenesis [15,16]. Runt is
initially expressed in a broad domain in the centre of the
syncitial blastoderm embryo regulated by bicoid [17,18]
and tailless [17], and is required for activation of sex-lethal,
the major switch in Drosophila sex-determination [13].
Runt is a pair-rule gene but also has gap gene like properties [19]. During segmentation runt is expressed in the
blastoderm with a dual segment periodicity, becoming
expressed in seven stripes of cells. The expression of each
of the seven stripes appears to be regulated independently
by the gap genes, but possibly also by the maternal coordinate gene bicoid [17]. Other pair-rule genes, particularly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/558

hairy, act to maintain the runt expression pattern [17,18].
Later in the segmentation cascade runt is expressed with
segmental periodicity, resulting in the formation of the
secondary stripe pattern. This pattern is dependent on all
of the pair-rule genes except sloppy-paired [17]. Following
segmentation runt is expressed in a subset of cells in the
developing nervous system and determines cell fate in
specific neural lineages [16].
The other well-characterised Drosophila RD protein, lozenge, also has roles in several developmental processes. It
has been shown to function in the development of antennae and tarsal claws, as well as haematopoiesis and female
fertility [20]. Lozenge was first identified on the basis of its
role in eye development and is critical for the differentiation of both photoreceptor neurons and non-neuronal
cone cells [21,22]
Gene clusters, such as the Hox gene complex, are often
ancient and are found in animals separated by hundreds
of millions of years of evolution. While gene clustering as
a phenomenon appears more common in genomes of
higher complexity, for instance in mammalian as compared to insect genomes, very ancient clusters such as
those involving the wnt family of genes [23] and the Fox
gene transcription factors [24] have been reported across
evolution. In the well-studied cases of the Hox, Wnt and
Fox clusters, genes within the cluster show coordinated
expression during embryogenesis, implying the genes
may be regulated by shared cis-regulatory elements, which
invoke stabilising selection to maintain the gene cluster.
For the majority of gene clusters, however, it is not clear
whether the genomic organisation is maintained as a
result of functional constraints, or whether it is merely by
chance that no chromosomal rearrangements disrupting
the complex have become fixed.
It has been previously noted that of the Drosophila RD
genes, runt, CG34145 and CG42267 are closely linked on
chromosome 1 [6], and are likely to have evolved as a
result of tandem gene duplication. The close linkage of
these genes may be due to the recent evolution of multiple
RD genes in Drosophila or alternatively may indicate the
presence of functional constraints that retain these genes
in close proximity. It is possible to distinguish between
these possibilities by comparison of the genomic organisation amongst species that are sufficiently diverged to
have had numerous chromosomal rearrangements
become fixed, resulting in a shuffling of both the order
and spacing of genes.
A comprehensive survey of runt domain containing genes
in a wide range of arthropods is now possible due to the
availability of genome sequence for several key species.
Here we identify the RD genes in the genomes of several

endopterygotan insects, including the twelve Drosophila
species [25], Apis mellifera (the honeybee) [26], Nasonia
vitripennis (the jewel wasp) [27], Tribolium castaneum (the
red flour beetle) [28]Bombyx mori (the silkmoth) [29] and
Aedes aegypti (the yellow fever mosquito) [30]. The
genomes of two fully sequenced exopterygotan insects,
Acyrthosiphon pisum (the pea aphid) [31] and the Pediculus
humanus (the human body louse) [32] were also included
in this analysis. In addition two non-insect arthropod
genome sequences are now available: the crustacean
Daphnia pulex [33] and the chelicerate Ixodes scapularis
[34]. We examine the phylogenetic relationships and
genomic organisations of the RD genes in these organisms, and present evidence for a putative conserved runt
complex in insects. To determine if the close genomic
proximity of these RD genes in insects relates to functional
conservation of regulatory elements, the embryonic
expression profiles of the four RD genes were examined in
D. melanogaster and the hymenopteran insect A. mellifera.

Results
Identification of a runt gene complex in Drosophila
species
Three of the four RD genes in D. melanogaster are clustered
within 163 kb on chromosome 1 and are likely to have
arisen by tandem gene duplication [6]. There is very tight
linkage between CG42267 and CG34145, but there are
three annotated functionally unrelated genes that lie
between CG34145 and runt. Lozenge is separated from the
other three genes by a distance of over 11 Mb.

To determine whether the genomic organisation of this
'runt complex' is the result of functional constraint or has
been maintained purely by chance, we utilised the recent
release of the twelve Drosophila species genome sequences
[25]. These species are approximately 40 – 60 million
years diverged [35], and extensive gene shuffling within
the chromosome arms has occurred even between moderately diverged genomes such as D. melanogaster and D.
yakuba [25,36].
Four RD genes were identified in each of these Drosophila
genomes; in some cases the gene prediction was incomplete and complete predictions were obtained using
Augustus [37]. In all cases the presence of both the RD and
C-terminal VWRPY motif was confirmed. Identity was
then assigned to these orthologues based on homology to
the D. melanogaster protein sequences, as inferred by Bayesian phylogeny (Fig. 1) [see Additional file 1 for multiple
sequence alignment].
The orthologues of CG34145, CG42267 and Runt are all
found tightly linked (within 140 – 225 kb) in all 12 Drosophila species. In contrast, the orthologue of lozenge is
usually present on the same chromosome but not closely

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/558

linked to the other three RD genes. In species where scaffolds have been assigned to chromosome groups, this
complex falls on the X chromosome (chromosome 1 in D.
melanogaster).
The number and identity of intervening genes is not well
conserved (Fig. 2), although Cyp6v1 is always found
between CG34145 and runt. Hydra and CG1835 are found
between these two genes in the melanogaster sub-group,
with the exception of D. sechellia where both genes are
localised to an orphan scaffold (scaffold 600) which is
likely to be an assembly error. CG1835 is also found in a
conserved position in D. willistoni. There is also an unannotated gene likely to fall within this region in D. melanogaster that shows homology to D. simulans GD17499,
this gene is found in all members of the melanogaster
group but is unannotated in most (Fig. 2). It is possible
that this sequence does not produce an mRNA transcript,
although there is EST evidence in D. melanogaster to suggest that it does (BK003230). Despite the variation in
number of intervening genes, the approximate spacing
between the three genes is well conserved; with ~100 kb
between runt and CG34145 (in all species except D. sechellia, where the distance is 20 kb) and ~168 kb between
CG23415 and CG42267. The orientation of transcription
is also conserved; orthologues of CG42267 and runt are
transcribed from the sense strand, while CG34145 is transcribed from the anti-sense strand. The transcriptional orientation of lozenge is not well conserved, but it is
transcribed from the sense strand in the majority of species, except D. erecta and D. virilis, possibly resulting from
independent genome inversion events in these species.
Together, the phylogenetic and genomic organisation
supports the duplication of the RD genes prior to the radiation of the Drosophila lineage, and the resultant cluster of
RD genes shows remarkable stability since the divergence
of Drosophila species 60 million years ago [35].
Identification of a runt gene complex in other insect
species
A survey of other fully sequenced insect genomes [2628,31,32,38], shows that aspects of this runt gene complex are conserved, not only in the endopterygotan insects
A. mellifera, A. aegypti, B. mori and T. castaneum, but also
in the exopterygotan insects P. humanus (a Phthiapteran)
and A. pisum (a Hemipteran). In all of these insects four
RD genes were identified, and phylogenetic analyses (Fig.
3) were used to assign orthology to these genes. Where RD
genes were incompletely or incorrectly annotated, particularly in the genomes of T. castaneum, A. aegypti, A. pisum
and B. mori, annotation was performed manually with the
assistance of Augustus [37] and GenomeScan [39], in all
cases the presence of both the RD and C-terminal VWRPY
motif was confirmed (the C-terminal pentapeptide in A.

Phylogeny and genomic organisation of Drosophila runt domain protein sequences.
An unrooted Bayesian phylogeny of Drosophila full-length RD protein sequences. Phylogeny was constructed using MrBayes
[67] under the Jones amino acid substitution model. Posterior probabilities are shown on internal branches. The RD proteins
are subdivided into the four established orthologue groups. Species names are abbreviated as follows: Dmel = D. melanogaster,
Dsim = D. simulans, Dsec = D. sechellia, Dyak = D. yakuba, Dere = D. erecta, Dana = D. ananassae, Dpse = D. pseudoobscura,
Dper = D. persimilis, Dwil = D. wilistoni, Dmoj = D. mojavensis, Dvir = D. virilis, Dgri = D. grimshawi and species names are followed by the FlyBase accession numbers. Asterisks indicate protein sequences that have been manually annotated. Orthologue groups are colour coded, the red group shows homology to the Drosophila runt protein, the purple to the Drosophila
lozenge protein, the green to the Drosophila CG42267 protein and the blue to the Drosophila CG34145 protein.

genes
falling
between
BmCG42267
(BGIBMGA008905) and BmCG34145 (BGIBMGA008970/
008971). Surprisingly, a very tight cluster of all four RD
genes can also be found in the exopterygotan insect P.
humanus, where all four genes are found within 70 kb,
with no intervening genes.

It has been generally asserted that the RD gene family has
derived from serial duplication of a single ancestral gene
[6]. The structure of the insect RD gene phylogeny presented in Fig. 3, indicates that runt is ancestral to the other
three RD proteins, and has been duplicated twice; one
copy became the runt gene, while the second was further
duplicated to evolve the CG34145 and CG42267 genes.

Data for A. aegypti and A. pisum were inconclusive due to
gaps in the genome assemblies, but the orthologues of
both runt and CG34145 were found on the same contig in
close proximity, consistent with that seen in the other
insects. In all cases the transcriptional orientation of these
three core RD genes is completely conserved.
Interestingly, in the species where the four RD genes are
tightly linked (A. mellifera, B. mori and P. humanus), the
orthologue of lozenge lies proximal to the orthologue of
runt. This contrasts to the remainder of species where loz-

Expression of the RD genes: comparison of Drosophila
and A. mellifera
The persistence of an intact RD gene cluster in all insects
examined, despite more than 400 million years of evolution, and significant changes in life history and developmental modes, implies some functional relevance to the
organisation of these genes. Analysis of gene expression

patterns has previously provided important insight into
the nature of selective forces acting on gene clusters [41].
The expression patterns of runt and lozenge are well-understood in D. melanogaster, but the expression patterns of the
other two RD genes remains uncharacterised. As the Drosophila RD complex shows evidence of dispersal, of lozenge
in particular, we also chose to examine the expression patterns of all four RD genes in the basally branching endopterygotan insect, A. mellifera, which possesses a tight
cluster of all four RD genes (Fig. 4).

In situ hybridisation of Drosophila and A. mellifera
embryos was used to compare expression domains of the
four RD mRNAs. Drosophila runt (Fig. 5a) is expressed
early in development in a broad domain, then in a dualsegment periodicity in embryonic stages 4–6, and later in
a segmental periodicity following gastrulation, as previously reported [42]. A. mellifera runt is expressed in a similar pattern (Fig. 5b), in stripes across the embryo that

form in an anterior to posterior succession in a pattern
that is typical of A. mellifera pair-rule genes [43].
The expression of Drosophila lozenge (Fig. 5g) is not consistent with that previously reported; a previous study
demonstrated that by embryonic stage 7 lozenge expression is restricted to the anterior of the embryo in a subpopulation of prohaemocytes, which terminally differen-

tiate to form crystal cells (which are involved in innate
immunity and wound healing) by embryonic stage 10
[44]. In this study lozenge mRNA is initially maternally
provided and is localised to nuclei at early stages, expression later in development is ubiquitous. This difference in
expression patterns is probably because the previous
study used an enhancer fragment linked to a reporter gene
to determine the expression pattern. A. mellifera lozenge
(Fig. 5h) expression is detected very early (stage 1) in the
anterior region of the embryo and is then detected in a distinct cell type, that develop from head mesoderm (Fig.
5h). These may be differentiating crystal cells, which
develop from the head mesoderm in Drosophila [45]. By
stage 9 (just prior to hatching), Amlz is expression is
detected throughout the embryo (data not shown).

This presence of multiple RD genes in the genomes of
non-insect arthropods raises the possibility that the duplication of the RD genes occurred prior to the radiation of
arthropod species and that multiple RD genes and their
genomic organisation were present in the last common
ancestor of arthropods. To examine this possibility phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the RD domain
sequence from the proteins of known RD genes. Representatives from several non-arthropod metazoan clades
were selected, including the basally branching non-bilaterian Trichoplax adhaerens [48], the cnidarian Nematostella
[49], and the RD genes from two sequenced lophotrochozoan species, the gastropod snail Lottia gigantea, and the
polychaete Capitella (Fig. 6) [see Additional file 4 for multiple sequence alignment].

The embryonic expression of the other two RD genes in
Drosophila, CG34145 (Fig. 5c) and CG42267 (Fig. 5e),
have not been previously described. At all embryonic
stages expression of both of these genes is ubiquitous,
with in situ hybridisation of imaginal discs also showing
no evidence of localised expression (data not shown).
Both AmGB11654 and AmGB19482, the A. mellifera
orthologues of these genes, are also expressed ubiquitously throughout late stages of embryonic development
(Fig. 5d and 5f).

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the duplication of the
RD genes has occurred independently in the deuterostome and arthropod lineages, and that the duplication
events that gave rise to the multiple vertebrate runx genes,
have occurred independently of the duplications giving
rise to the multiple RD genes in the sea urchin, S. purpuratus. Somewhat surprisingly however, the phylogeny also
indicates independent duplication events have given rise
to the chelicerate RD genes and the crustacean/insect RD
genes. The phylogeny indicates a single origin for chelicerate RD genes independent of the duplications that gave
rise to the RD genes in Daphnia and in insects. Supporting
this is the expression pattern of the RD gene cloned from
Tetranychus urticae (the two-spotted spider mite), which
clearly suggests a role for Tu-run in segmentation, but also
in limb specification [47], a role not seen for either the A.
mellifera or Drosophila orthologues of runt, but consistent
with expression of Cs-runt in C. salei.

While clustered genes often show coordinated expression,
neither the Drosophila nor A. mellifera RD genes (Fig. 5)
demonstrate strong coordination of either temporal or
spatial expression during embryonic development.
The evolution of RD proteins in metazoa and arthropods
The presence of a runt domain cluster (Fig. 4) in all insect
species examined, together with the phylogenetic data
presented in Fig. 3, suggests that the duplication of the RD
genes occurred prior to the divergence of the insect lineage
into these two branches. In order to examine the evolution of these RD genes, and this cluster in a wider context,
the genome sequence of two non-insect arthropods were
utilised. Examination of the genome sequences of the
crustacean D. pulex and the chelicerate I. scapularis clearly
demonstrates multiple RD genes in both of these species,
contradicting previous assertions that non-insect arthropods have only a single RD gene [7]. The water flea D.
pulex has four RD genes, and two of these fall on the same
scaffold (Fig. 4). In contrast I. scapularis only has two RD
genes, and at present these fall on two independent scaffolds. Extensive searches of the I. scapularis genome have
been unable to identify any further orthologues, however
this could be due to the preliminary nature of the genome
assembly. Two RD genes have also been identified in the
spider Cupiennius salei [46], and one in the two-spotted
spider mite, Tetranychus urticae [47].

Interestingly, a single D. pulex gene (Dp290554) groups
with the clade of insect RD proteins, while the other three
D. pulex genes form an independent clade. This seems to
indicate that runt is the ancestral protein in crustaceans
and chelicerates. However, the crustacean/insect clade on
the whole is not well resolved, as by necessity, this phylogeny only included 125 amino acids of the RD as two of
the D. pulex sequences are incorrectly annotated and are
missing 10 amino acids of the RD, thus reducing the informational content of the alignment.
Bayesian phylogeny of the full RD from arthropod species, minus the truncated D. pulex sequences (Fig. 7) [see
Additional file 5 for multiple sequence alignment], supports the independent duplication of RD genes in chelicerates and in crustaceans and insects. As before
Dp290554 groups reliably with the insect runt RD
sequence, providing evidence for runt being the ancestral
RD protein in these species, which was suggested (albeit

Discussion
In this study we identified four RD genes in the twelve
sequenced Drosophila genomes [25] and in several nondipteran endopterygotan insects including A. mellifera, A.
aegypti, B. mori, and T. castaneum. Four RD genes were also
identified in the exopterygotan insects, P. humanus and A.
pisum, and the crustacean D. pulex. Two different arrangements of RD genes were observed in these species: a semidispersed cluster was seen in Drosophila species and in T.
castaneum; and an intact, tight cluster with few or no intervening genes was seen in A. mellifera, B. mori and P.

humanus. In the other species examined, the genome
assembly was fragmented such that one or more RD genes
was localised to a different contig and thus no assertions
about cluster organisation could be made. In species with
an intact RD gene cluster, lozenge was found to be located
proximal to runt, while in the species with a semi-dispersed cluster lozenge was often localised to the same chromosome, but separated from the core cluster by
megabases of DNA. The genomic organisation of the
remaining three RD genes, including gene spacing and
transcriptional orientation, was remarkably conserved.
The number and identity of intervening genes in this cluster varies; between two and seven genes lie between the

CG34145 and runt orthologues in Drosophila species,
including Cyp6v1. Cyp6v1 is a P450 enzyme, and is part of
a large gene family that is prone to duplication [50]. Hydra
and CG1835 are localised between CG34145 and runt in
D. melanogaster, D simulans, D. yakuba and D. erecta, these
two genes are localised to an orphan scaffold in D. sechellia (scaffold 600), but this is likely a problem with the
genome assembly. Hydra is found exclusively in the melanogaster sub-group, with no orthologues found in any
other dipterans or insects (data not shown), suggesting
recent evolution of this gene. Conversely CG1835 is also
found in D. willistoni suggesting at least two independent
losses of this gene (in the obscura group and D. ananassae)
A fourth gene is found in this region in the melanogaster
species group, however this gene is unannotated in D.
melanogaster and therefore may represent a conserved regulatory sequence rather than a protein coding gene.
CG42267 and CG34145 are in much tighter linkage, and
the majority of Drosophila species have either one or no
intervening genes in this region, other than D. persimilis
which has three. Based on established taxonomic relationships between Drosophila species it is likely that there has
been multiple gains or losses of genes in these genomic
regions, although this effect may be exaggerated due to
inaccuracies in the genome assemblies or gene prediction
models. In all but one non-dipteran insect species, no
intervening genes were identified in the RD gene cluster,
the only exception being in B. mori where five annotated
genes fall between BmCG42267 and BmCG34145. The
presence of intervening genes in the Dipteran RD cluster,
seemingly unrelated in either expression or function, is
consistent with the RD complex being considered a
genomic regulatory block [51] and is reminiscent of the
Hox complex in Drosophila, where invasion of cuticle
genes into the ANT-C complex between labial and proboscipedia has been attributed to the accelerated rate of evolution in this lineage, and may have contributed to splitting
of the Hox complex in Drosophila [52].
The presence of an intact cluster in the endopterygotan
insects A. mellifera and B. mori, and the exopterygotan
insect P. humanus, strongly supports the phylogenetic data
that duplication of the RD genes occurred prior to the
radiation of insect species, and implies that the ancestral
insect genome had a very tight cluster of four RD genes.
The semi-dispersed gene cluster seen in Drosophila and T.
castaneum may indicate that the functional constraint
holding lozenge in the gene cluster has been lost or modified in the Coleopteran and Dipteran lineages. The pattern
of RD gene dispersal in these species is similar to that seen
for the Fox family of transcription factors, where relaxation of selection on the cluster has resulted in cluster fragmentation [24]. The dissolution of such clusters also may
be the result of accelerated genome evolution associated
with Drosophila lineages [25]. However, the T. castaneum

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/558

genome is not noted to have undergone particularly rapid
evolution [53] and consistent with this, the T. castaneum
genome has just a single Hox complex, with no evidence
of dispersal [53]. A recent study has shown that while up
to 91% of orthologues remain in synteny between D. melanogaster and the most diverged Drosophila species, D. virilis synteny is only 3% between D. melanogaster and B.
mori, and 10% between D. melanogaster and A. mellifera
[54]. This, along with the high observed rate of turnover
of intervening genes within the RD cluster, would indicate
that the conservation of genomic organisation seen for RD
genes across insect genomes would be very unlikely to
have occurred simply by chance, and is likely to have been
maintained by selection, presumably in favour of retaining function.
Functionally related genes are known to have, in some
cases, conserved genomic organisation [55]. In general,
genes that have evolved as a result of tandem gene duplications tend to maintain a similar function to their parental copy due to sharing of the same regulatory elements
[56], and this sharing of regulatory elements can facilitate
the evolution of co-regulation [41]. To examine the possibility of co-regulation acting as a selective force to maintain the RD gene cluster, the expression of the four RD
genes was examined in D. melanogaster (which houses a
semi-dispersed RD cluster) and in A. mellifera (which
houses an intact 'ancestral' RD cluster) as a means of
investigating functional conservation of RD gene orthologues between these species. In situ hybridisation did not
reveal any strong evidence for spatial or temporal co-regulation of RD gene orthologues during Drosophila or A.
mellifera embryogenesis. Although it is possible that localization or expression of the protein (which would not be
detected by in situ hybridisation) is altered independently
of that of its mRNA. Three of the four RD genes are
expressed ubiquitously in the blastoderm stage of embryogenesis in Drosophila, while the fourth, runt is expressed
in a pair-rule pattern in seven stripes. Therefore the cluster
of RD genes in insects could be driving co-regulation of
expression at the blastoderm stage, while runt expression
is negatively regulated by fushi tarazu [18], however this
is not the case for A. mellifera. It is possible that overlapping rather than shared regulatory elements are responsible for the retention of the gene cluster. However, this
scenario would also appear unlikely; while the runt
enhancer in Drosophila covers a distance of approximately
14 kb [57], the intergenic distance between CG34145 and
runt averages around 100 kb across Drosophila species, and
the number of intervening genes in this region varies
markedly, highlighting that this genomic region is free to
evolve.
There has been much speculation about the origin of the
RD proteins, and it is largely accepted that the RD genes

Page 12 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:558

have been independently duplicated in the deuterostome
and protostome lineages [6,7]. However, the question of
RD gene evolution in arthropods has not been addressed
specifically. Phylogenetic analyses presented here support
the notion of gene duplication prior to the radiation of
insect species, as all insect RD proteins could be placed
into four orthologue groups. However, two non-insect
arthropods whose genomes have been sequenced completely, the chelicerate I. scapularis and the crustacean D.
pulex, also have multiple RD genes, and phylogenetic
analyses support the notion that these genes have been
independently duplicated in insect and non-insect arthropod lineages. This phylogeny implies that the ancestor of
arthropods had a single RD gene. However, gene conversion events are known to result in phylogenetic analyses
that overestimate the incidence of gene duplication. This
is an issue for linked genes, such as those generated by
tandem gene duplication [58], and has resulted in spurious phylogenies for insect gene families [59].
The phylogeny presented here indicates that there have
been multiple duplications of RD genes across bilaterian
evolution, and as there is no evidence for the duplicated
copies decaying into pseudogenes, these duplicated copies are likely to have undergone rapid divergence resulting
in subfunctionalisation or neofunctionalisation of the
protein functions. This kind of rapid divergence could be
due to the chromosomal location of the ancestral gene, as
it is known that areas of the genome are more prone to
this phenomenon, such as the X chromosome in Drosophila, where the RD gene complex is localised [60]. Consistent with the hypothesis of rapid divergence following
duplication, there is clear evidence for neofunctionalisation of the duplicated genes, in both ecdysozoan and deuterostome species. For instance, the C. elegans RD gene
and one of the sea urchin RD genes, which are most
closely related to mammalian runx3, are both expressed in
the developing gut, a role not seen in the cnidarian Nematostella. This has led to the assertion that runx3 may be the
ancestral RD gene in chordates [2], although this hypothesis is yet to be supported by molecular data [6].
To date there has been no discussion about the evolution
of RD genes in arthropods, and the phylogenetic analyses
presented here indicates that the last common ancestor of
all arthropods had a single RD gene, which has been independently duplicated in the chelicerate and crustacean/
insect lineages. All arthropod RD genes possess a runt
DNA binding domain and a Groucho binding domain,
suggesting that these proteins are able to act as transcriptional regulators, and both runt and lozenge have been
shown to modulate developmental gene expression in
Drosophila [20]. The functions of CG34145 and CG42267
are unknown, although CG42267 was identified as having a role in the control of cell survival in an RNAi screen

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/558

[61] and it has been suggested that cross-talk between RD
proteins and the cell cycle may modulate cell cycle progression [62]; this would also be consistent with the ubiquitous expression of CG42267 and CG34145 during
embryogenesis in Drosophila and A. mellifera [62]. Interestingly, one of the two sea urchin RD genes is also highly
expressed in proliferating cells during embryogenesis
[10], perhaps supporting an ancestral role for the RD
genes in cell-cycle modulation.
The phylogenetic data indicates that runt is the ancestral
RD gene in insects and crustaceans. In insects runt has a
key role in segmentation [42], and orthologs of runt have
been shown to be involved in the segmentation of two
chelicerates [46,47], raising the possibility that one of the
functions of the single RD gene in the last common ancestor of all arthropods was a role in segmentation, and that
the duplication and diversification of the RD genes has
served to recruit the transcriptional co-repressor Groucho
into new developmental niches, such as eye development
[21].

Conclusion
RD genes are present in the genomes of organisms
throughout metazoa, often found in multiple copies. Phylogenetic evidence supports the notion that these duplication events leading to multiple genomic copies of RD
genes have occurred independently in the deuterostome
and ecdysozoan lineages. Within arthropods, RD genes
are also clustered, however phylogenetic data supports the
independent duplication of RD genes in the chelicerate
and crustacean/insect lineages. The RD genes in insects
bear all the hallmarks of a functional gene cluster, in particular the very tight association of three of the four RD
genes; CG42267, CG34145 and runt. However, in situ
hybridisation of RNA expression did not suggest any temporal or spatial co-regulation of these RD genes in either
Drosophila, which has a semi-dispersed cluster formation
or in A. mellifera, which has an intact complex. It is possible that the retention of such a complex is not associated
with functional constraints but is merely an artefact of
tandem gene duplication; however, given the accelerated
genome evolution observed in both Drosophila and mosquito species [63], but not T. castaneum [53], this would
seem unlikely. While the significance of this RD gene cluster in insect species remains unknown the persistence of
this cluster across all insect species implies functional
importance.

Phylogenetic analyses and cluster identification
Full-length RD metazoan protein sequences were
obtained from relevant genome databases [25-28,30-34],
or from NCBI. Unannotated RD proteins were predicted
with the assistance of Augustus [37], and GeneScan [39].
Where required, runt domains were extracted from full
length protein sequences using the hmmer suite of programs [64], against the Pfam runt hmm model (PF00853,
138 amino acids) [65].

GB 11654 CTCGTGCTCGAGTCGCCCTAGTAG

Multiple alignments were carried out using ClustalX [66].
The multiple alignments were analysed using MrBAYES
v3.1.2 [67] under the Jones model with default priors. The
Jones model was chosen as the most appropriate model of
amino acid substitution after preliminary analyses using
MrBAYES with mixed models. The Monte Carlo Markov
Chain search was run with four chains over 1000000 generations with trees sampled every 1000 generations. The
first 250000 trees were discarded as 'burn-in'.

Amplified DNA fragments were purified using the High
Pure PCR purification kit (Roche) and cloned into pCRIITOPO (Invitrogen). The sequence and orientation of each
cloned gene fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Identification and cloning of RD genes
Drosophila RD genes were identified in FlyBase [68], and
A. mellifera orthologues of these Drosophila genes were
identified by tBlastN [69] searches of the A. mellifera
genome [26].

RNA was extracted from A. mellifera embryos using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an
oligo-dT primer. The cDNA was used as a template for
amplification of putative RD genes using the following

In situ hybridisation
A. mellifera embryos were collected and fixed as described
[70]. Antisense or sense digoxigenin (DIG) labelled RNA
probes were produced by in vitro transcription from linearised DNA templates containing cDNA fragments. In situ
hybridisation on A. mellifera embryos were performed as
previously described [70].

Authors' contributions
EJD and PKD performed the bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses. MJW performed the A. mellifera ISH experiments. PKD performed the Drosophila ISH experiments
and conceived the study. EJD, JMS, MJW and PKD wrote
the manuscript.
