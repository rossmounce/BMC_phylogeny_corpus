Abstract
HIV-1 epidemic in India is largely driven by subtype C but other subtypes or recombinants have
also been reported from several states of India. This is mainly due to the co-circulation of other
genetic subtypes that potentially can recombine to generate recombinant/mosaic genomes. In this
study, we report detail genetic characterization of HIV-1 envelope sequences from North India
(Delhi and neighboring regions). Six of 13 were related to subtype C, one B and the rest six showed
relatedness with CRF02_AG strain. The subtype C possessed the highly conserved GPGQ motif
but subtype B possessed the GPGR motif in the V3 loop as observed earlier. While most of the
sequences suggested CCR5 co-receptor usage, one subtype C sample clearly indicated CXCR4
usage. A successful mother to child transmission was established in two pairs. Thus, co-circulation
of multiple subtypes (B and C) and the recombinant CRF02_AG strains in North India suggests a
rapidly evolving scenario of HIV-1 epidemic in this region with impact on vaccine formulation. Since
this is the first report of CRF02_AG envelope from India, it will be important to monitor the spread
of this strain and its impact on HIV-1 transmission in India.

Introduction
HIV-1 displays a tremendous amount of genetic diversity.
The binding of the HIV-1 to host cells is mediated by envelope glycoprotein. When the HIV-1 envelope protein
binds to its primary receptor CD4, it undergoes conformational changes and it then binds to one of the coreceptors
(chemokine receptor CCR5, CXCR4 or others) via its V3
loop. This tri-molecular interaction leads to the viral
membrane fusion [1]. HIV-1 envelope is composed of rel-

atively conserved (C1 to C5) and variable regions (V1 to
V5). The V3 region elicits neutralizing antibodies and also
govern co-receptor usage [1,2]. Replacements in the V3
region with basic amino acids are associated with CXCR4
usage [2,3]. Subtypes A and C usually contain a highly
conserved GPGQ amino acid motif, while GPGR is the
predominant motif in the V3 loop of subtype B envelopes
[4,5]. Mutational patterns in the V3 loop region are likely
to be of clinical significance as they can influence their

susceptibility to known CCR5 inhibitors. Although all
HIV-1 genetic subtypes originated in Africa, it is not fully
understood how certain subtypes dominate different
regions of the world. For e.g. subtype B predominates in
US and UK but subtype C is predominant in India, some
parts of Asia and Africa [6].

fragment (V3 to V5) was amplified using two internal sets
of primers with following sequences:

It is fairly well established that HIV-1 that uses CCR5
chemokine receptor (R5-tropic) is transmitted preferentially than the ones that use CXCR4 chemokine receptor
[7]. Individuals with a 32 bp deletion in the CCR5 open
reading frame (ORF) are largely protected against HIV-1
infection [7-9]. Approximately 50% of HIV-1 subtype B
infected individuals show HIV-1 co-receptor switch from
CCR5 to CXCR4 which is associated with rapid progression of HIV/AIDS [10]. This is observed mainly in US and
UK where subtype B predominates. However, in India,
where subtype C predominates, the coreceptor switch has
not been observed [11]. Replacements of charged amino
acids within the V3 region are known to alter the co-receptor usage [2,3,12]. Genetic variations in the subtype C
HIV-1 envelope sequences have recently been reported
from Southern India with some strains exhibiting multiple co-receptor usage, including CXCR4 chemokine receptor, present predominantly on T-helper lymphocytes
[13,14]. It is noteworthy that we recently reported novel
B/C LTR [15] and Vpr B/C/D sequences from North India
[16].

The cycling conditions for amplifying both the fragments
were: 35 cycles at 98°C for 15 sec, 55°C for 30 sec and
72°C for 1 min with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
PCR-amplified DNA was cloned into pGem-T expression
vector (Promega Biotech. WI, USA) and sequenced in
both directions using T7 and SP6-specific primers. The
sequence from one representative clone from each sample
was used to carry out phylogenetic analysis and sequence
comparisons. The final concentration of MgCl2 was 20
mM for both the PCRs. Mother and child samples were
processed separately to avoid cross contamination.

Given the large size of India, and with increasing global
travel, it is likely that subtypes other than B may also cocirculate, creating an ideal situation for the formation of
recombinants. With this in mind, we genetically characterized the HIV-1 envelope sequences from HIV-1 infected
individuals from Northern India and report the presence
of HIV-1 CRF02_AG for the first time.

Methods
Genomic DNA isolation and Polymerase chain reaction
Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh peripheral blood
collected in EDTA using a kit from Qiagen (QIAamp
Blood Minikit) as described before by us [8,9]. All requisite ethical clearances were obtained before initiating this
study. All the polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were
performed with high fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (ExTaq, Takara, Japan) using the following primers:

Forward primer: 5'-ATGGGATCAAAGCCTAAAGCCATGTG
Reverse primer: 5'-AGTGCTTCCTGCTGCTCCCAAGAACCCAAG
Approximately 1.25 Kb DNA fragment corresponding to
V1 to V5 region was amplified initially. Thereafter, 700 bp

Forward primer: CTGTTAAATGGCAGTCTAGC
Reverse primer: CACTTCTCCAATTGTCCCTCA

Patient population and genetic analysis
We carried out genetic analysis of 13 HIV-1 envelope
sequences from Northern India. Nine unrelated and 2
mother-child pairs (Pair 1, D & E 57 and Pair 2, D & E 58)
were selected randomly from two locations (one from
GTB Hospital, Delhi - Samples ND1 to 5, all from commercial sex workers-CSW) and the rest were from Punjab/
Haryana region. Primers were designed to carry out nested
PCR as described earlier. It is noteworthy that we were
unable to amplify envelope sequences from several samples which may be due to extreme genetic variability and
therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the frequency of any genetic subtype from this study. Alternatively, since most of the HIV-1 infected individuals were
on antiretrovirals, the amounts of proviral DNA may have
been too small to amplify. Sequences were compared with
reference strains (figure 1) (Los Almos-http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov). At least 4 independent clones were
analyzed from each sample and only one representative
clone from each sample was genetically analyzed. Multiple sequence analysis was performed in ClustalW 1.8.3
obtained from DNA data bank of Japan (DDBJ) website
http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html. The phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MEGAA 4.1 (beta)
software. Genotyping was carried out using viral genotyping tools located at NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi, REGA subtyping tool
ver 2.0 http://www.bioafrica.net/subtypetool/html and
Recombination Identification Program (RIP) 3.0. http://
www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/RIP/RIP.html.
Potential N-glycosylation sites were calculated using NGlycoSite program http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/
sequence/GLYCOSITE/glycosite.html.

Results and discussion
All of the HIV-1 infected individuals were infected
through heterosexual route (except mother-child pair)

HIV-1 envelope sequence comparison and coreceptor usage
HIV-1 envelope sequence comparison and coreceptor usage. HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified from infected individuals and subjected to sequencing as described in the text. Only the V3 loop region sequences with short flanking constant
regions are shown with their accession numbers, their subtype assignment and possible co-receptor usage. Dots in the
sequence indicate identity with consensus C, B, 02_AG and A sequences; asterisk indicates identical amino acids; single dot at
the bottom of four groups of samples represents semi-conserved substitution of amino acids and double dots represent conserved substitution. Subtypes were determined using Viral Genotyping Tool, REGA Subtyping Tool and RIP 3.0 with maximum
blast identity.

and their CD4 count varied from 120 - 150 (sample A81
& 82) and between 400-500 (D57 and D58). Most of
them were under 1st line of antiretroviral treatment. The
GPGQ motif present in the middle of the V3 loop was
conserved among all subtype C and CRF_02 AG strains.
Remarkably 5 of subtype C samples showed conservation
of A residue just downstream of GPGQ motif (not
observed in consensus C) and 4 of them showed H to Y
change just prior to the second cysteine of the V3 region
(figure 1). The subtype B sample (VT5) possessed the
GPGR amino acid motif at the crown of the V3 loop as
expected. It is noteworthy that we recently reported novel
mosaic B/C HIV-1 LTR and B/C/D recombinant Vpr structures from the same region of India (Punjab/Haryana
region) [15,16]. Group M subtype reference sequences
along with outlier sequences were downloaded from Los
Almos HIV data base. The sequences were subjected to
various genetic subtyping tools (Phylogenetic Analysis,
RIP 3.0, Viral Genotyping Tools and Rega Subtyping).
This analysis indicated that 6 of 13 were related to subtype
C, one B and the rest 6 showed resemblance with
CRF02_AG strain (figure 2). Successful mother-to-child
transmission was detected in both the pairs (Bootstrap
value 99 in pair 1 and 71 in Pair 2) as judged by high

bootstrap value (figure 2). It is noteworthy that no
changes in the V3 sequences were observed in both the
mother-infant pairs. Maximum intra-patient proviral
diversity was observed in two samples (A81 and C5)
(manuscript under preparation). It was reported earlier
that subtype determination based on phylogenetic analysis should also be confirmed by using other tools or signature sequences present in V3 region [17]. Representative
subtype sequences identified by RIP 3.0 program are given
(additional file 1). Each curve is a comparison between
the envelope regions being analyzed (query- as indicated
at the top of each square) and multiple reference
sequences downloaded from the data bank. Using this
kind of analysis, HXB2 (panel A) and an isolate with an
accession number FJ769836 (panel B), were identified as
subtype B; isolate FJ968673 as CRF_02AG (panel C) and
isolate with an accession number FJ968672 as subtype C.
The most remarkable finding was the predominance of
CRF02_AG strain among the unrelated commercial sex
workers (CSWs) from Delhi (Capital of India) region. All
the isolates from Punjab/Haryana region showed relatedness with consensus C. This recombinant form is predominantly found in Africa (Cote Divoire, Mali, Senegal,

Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1 envelope sequences from North India
Phylogenetic analysis of the HIV-1 envelope sequences from North India. All the reference sequences from M-group
& outlier group were retrieved from Los Almos Data Base and used for constructing neighbor joining phylogenetic tree. Indian
CRF02_AG strains are represented as 'Black Circles'; 'Black Square' for subtype C; and 'Black Diamond' as subtype B. The evolutionary history was created using Neighbor-Joining Method in MEGA4. Similar evolutionary pattern was detected when Maximum Likelihood and UPGMA methods were used (data not shown). Mother-child pairs were shown by filled and empty circles
by numbers (1 and 2). Empty circles denote maternal envelope sequences while filled circles denote infant envelope sequences.

Ghana and Cameroon etc.) followed by Korea, Spain and
France. The potential glycosylation sites present in V3 to
V5 region varied from 7 (A81) to 15 (ND5 (data not
shown). This is important because in some instances
hypo-glycosylated forms of envelope have been associated with better transmission and in their ability to interact with neutralizing antibody [18].

It was remarkable that sample A81 clearly showed CXCR4
coreceptor usage by both the programs (WebPSSM and
Geno2Pheno) designed to predict HIV-1 coreceptor
usage. This is important because earlier studies with
Indian subtype C envelope showed exclusive use of CCR5
co-receptor [11]. It is important to note that Samples A82
and C5 showed discrepancy in their predicted coreceptor
usage and this is because the two programs use different
parameters [19,20].
Successful transmission of virus (judged by high bootstrap values) was observed in both the mother-child pair
samples. It is important to study the functional implications of the changes in the viral gene sequences between
mother-infant pairs to understand the molecular basis of
successful transmission [21]. VT5 (subtype B) sample, as
expected, showed CXCR4 usage and all of the CRF02_AG
strains showed CCR5 usage.
In summary, we show for the first time presence and transmission of CRF02_AG HIV-1 strain in India (Delhi - Capital of India) and presence of subtypes B and C in North
India. These observations will impact on the T-cell
epitope based vaccine. The existence of multiple HIV-1
genetic subtypes in this region is likely to generate novel
and complex recombinants.
