Abstract
Background: The Xanthomonadaceae family contains two xylem-limited plant pathogenic bacterial
species, Xanthomonas albilineans and Xylella fastidiosa. X. fastidiosa was the first completely
sequenced plant pathogen. It is insect-vectored, has a reduced genome and does not possess hrp
genes which encode a Type III secretion system found in most plant pathogenic bacteria. X.
fastidiosa was excluded from the Xanthomonas group based on phylogenetic analyses with rRNA
sequences.
Results: The complete genome of X. albilineans was sequenced and annotated. X. albilineans, which
is not known to be insect-vectored, also has a reduced genome and does not possess hrp genes.
Phylogenetic analysis using X. albilineans genomic sequences showed that X. fastidiosa belongs to the
Xanthomonas group. Order of divergence of the Xanthomonadaceae revealed that X. albilineans and
X. fastidiosa experienced a convergent reductive genome evolution during their descent from the
progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus. Reductive genome evolutions of the two xylem-limited

Xanthomonadaceae were compared in light of their genome characteristics and those of obligate
animal symbionts and pathogens.
Conclusion: The two xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae, during their descent from a common
ancestral parent, experienced a convergent reductive genome evolution. Adaptation to the
nutrient-poor xylem elements and to the cloistered environmental niche of xylem vessels probably
favoured this convergent evolution. However, genome characteristics of X. albilineans differ from
those of X. fastidiosa and obligate animal symbionts and pathogens, indicating that a distinctive
process was responsible for the reductive genome evolution in this pathogen. The possible role in
genome reduction of the unique toxin albicidin, produced by X. albilineans, is discussed.

Background
The Xanthomonadaceae are a family of Gram negative bacteria belonging to the order Xanthomonadales in the
gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria [1]. Members of
this family are typically characterized as environmental
organisms and occupy diverse ecological niches, such as
soil and water, as well as plant tissues. Many Xanthomonadaceae, especially species from the genera Xanthomonas
and Xylella, cause plant diseases and only one, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, is known to be an opportunistic human
pathogen.
Complete genome sequences of several Xanthomonas species and Xylella fastidiosa strains have been determined,
making those bacteria attractive models for study of plantpathogen interactions [2]. X. fastidiosa was the first completely sequenced plant pathogen. Sequence analysis
showed that this xylem-limited bacterium, which is
insect-vectored to a variety of diverse hosts, had a reduced
genome and did not possess hrp genes, which encode a
Type III secretion system (T3SS) found in most Gram negative plant pathogenic bacteria [3]. Phylogenetic analysis
with rRNA sequences showed that the two major genera of
Xanthomonadaceae, Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas,
form a coherent group excluding X. fastidiosa [4-6]. These
characteristics suggested the hypothesis that this species
evolved from an ancestor shared with Xanthomonas and
Stenotrophomonas by genome reduction during adaptation
to life within its hosts [2].
Xanthomonas albilineans is a systemic, xylem-limited pathogen that causes leaf scald, one of the major diseases of
sugarcane (interspecific hybrids of Saccharum spp.) [7].
Leaf scald symptoms vary from a single, white, narrow,
sharply defined stripe to complete wilting and necrosis of
infected leaves, leading to plant death. X. albilineans produces the toxin albicidin that has phytotoxic and antibiotic properties [8]. Albicidin is a potent DNA gyrase
inhibitor that targets the chloroplastic DNA gyrase A,
inhibits chloroplast DNA replication and blocks chloroplast differentiation, resulting in the white foliar stripe
symptoms [8,9]. All attempts to identify hrp genes in X.
albilineans failed so far [10,11]. A phylogenetic study with

the housekeeping genes ihfA and efp, which did not
include S. maltophilia sequences, suggested that X. albilineans was an evolutionary intermediate between several
Xanthomonas species and X. fastidiosa [11].
Unlike other xylem-invading xanthomonads that interact
with living plant tissues, such as X. campestris pv. campestris or X. oryzae pv. oryzae, X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans
appear to be strictly xylem-limited, living only in dead
xylem cells or tracheary elements. In order to better understand the evolution of these two xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae, we sequenced the genome of X. albilineans
strain GPE PC73 from Guadeloupe [11]. This sequence
was compared to complete genome sequences of other
closely related members of the Xanthomonadaceae. This
comparative analysis revealed that X. albilineans and X.
fastidiosa experienced a convergent reductive genome evolution from a common ancestral parent of the Xanthomonas genus.

Results
General genomic features of X. albilineans
The genome of X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 consists of
one circular chromosome of 3,768,695 bp and three
extrachromosomal plasmids of 32, 27 and 25 Kbp, respectively. The chromosome exhibits a GC skew pattern typical of prokaryotic genomes that have two major shifts, one
near the origin and one near the terminus of replication,
with dnaA assigned as base pair 1 of the chromosome (Figure 1). The GC skew pattern of X. albilineans contains a
lower number of diagram distortions and has much lower
amplitude than the GC skew pattern of X. fastidiosa (Figure 2). However, the amplitude of the GC skew pattern of
X. albilineans is significantly higher than the one of other
xanthomonads and S. maltophilia (Figure 2). Of the 3115
putative protein-coding sequences (CDSs) manually
annotated on the chromosome of X. albilineans strain GPE
PC73, 2014 (64%) were assigned putative functions
based on homology to other known proteins and domain
analyses.

The general features of the X. albilineans chromosome
were compared to those of the chromosomes of the folPage 2 of 15

higher than the G+C content of the chromosome of X. fastidiosa strain Temecula1. The chromosome of X. albilineans shows an average coding density of 84%, which is also
similar to other xanthomonads.
Comparative genomic analyses
In order to assess phylogenetic relationships among the
nine Xanthomonadaceae mentioned above (Table 1), we
performed multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). The
phylogenetic tree obtained with the concatenated data set
of seven housekeeping genes showed that X. albilineans
belongs to the same clade as X. fastidiosa (Figure 3). The
clade containing X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa is clearly
distinct from the clade containing the four xanthomonads
of the Hrp Xanthomonas group (X. campestris pv. campestris,
X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria, X. axonopodis pv. citri and X.
oryzae pv. oryzae). On the basis of this phylogenetic tree,
we conclude that X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa derived
from the progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus (Figure 3).

lowing eight Xanthomonadaceae strains: X. oryzae pv. oryzae
strain MAFF 311018 (isolated from rice; [12]), X. campestris pv. campestris strain ATCC 33913 (isolated from cabbage; [13]), X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain 85-10
(isolated from pepper; [14]), X. axonopodis pv. citri strain
306 (isolated from citrus; [13]), S. maltophilia strain
K279a (isolated from the blood of an infected patient;
[15]), S. maltophilia strain R551-3 (isolated from poplar;
[16]), X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c (isolated from citrus; [3])
and X. fastidiosa strain Temecula1 (isolated from grapevine; [17]). The chromosome of X. albilineans is 1.4 Mb
smaller than the chromosomes of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain 85-10 and X. axonopodis pv. citri strain 306, but
it is 1.2 Mb bigger than the chromosome of X. fastidiosa
strain Temecula1 (Table 1). The G+C content of the chromosome of X. albilineans averages 63%. This value is similar to those of other Xanthomonas strains, but it is 12%

In order to identify orthologs shared by the nine Xanthomonadaceae strains (Table 1), we performed OrthoMCL
comparative analyses [18]. The X. albilineans CDSs shared
with X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c, S. maltophilia strain K279a or
X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain 85-10 are represented
on the circular chromosome (Figure 1). Interestingly, the
chromosome of X. albilineans harbours several large
regions that do not contain any genes present in the other
eight Xanthomonadaceae strains. These regions correspond
either to phage related sequences or to large genes encoding proteins that contain repeated Rhs elements that are
known to be frequently transferred by horizontal genetic
transfer [19]. They also contain several gene clusters specific to X. albilineans: (i) the albicidin biosynthesis gene
cluster XALB1 which was previously sequenced from X.
albilineans strain Xa23R1 [20] and which contains three
nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) genes; (ii)
three additional NRPS gene clusters to which cannot be
ascribed a precise function as they have not been previously identified and no strictly orthologous genes were
found in other bacteria; and (iii) a gene cluster encoding
a T3SS of the SPI-1 (Salmonella Pathogenicity Island -1)
family that is mainly found in free-living animal pathogens [21]. The OrthoMCL analyses identified a total of
522 CDSs of the genome of X. albilineans strain GPE PC73
that are not shared with any of the other eight Xanthomonadaceae complete genome sequences compared in this
study. They also identified 1256 CDSs shared by the nine
Xanthomonadaceae, which represent a Xanthomonadaceae
core gene set which was likely inherited from a common
ancestor.

derived from a common ancestor shared with Stenotrophomonas. The chromosome sizes of X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa are smaller than those of any other xanthomonad
(Table 1), suggesting that both species evolved from the
progenitor of xanthomonads by genome reduction. To
examine how the chromosomes of X. albilineans and X.
fastidiosa have evolved to result in these different sizes, we
determined the order of divergence of X. albilineans, X. fastidiosa, the four xanthomonads of the Hrp Xanthomonas
group and S. maltophilia (Figure 3). Orthologous genes
shared by S. maltophilia and a species of the Hrp Xanthomonas group, but missing in X. albilineans or X. fastidiosa, may be assumed to have been lost by X. albilineans or
X. fastidiosa, respectively. Inversely, genes of a species of
the Hrp Xanthomonas group that are shared with S. maltophilia, X. albilineans or X. fastidiosa may be assumed to

have been inherited from the progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus. On the basis of OrthoMCL analysis, the
numbers of genes lost by X. albilineans strain GPE PC73
and X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c are at least 585 and 1121,
respectively (numbers obtained by comparison with X.
campestris pv. campestris; 585 genes lost by X. albilineans =
the number of CDSs conserved in both X. campestris pv.
campestris and S. maltophilia and missing in X. albilineans;
1121 genes lost by X. fastidiosa = the number of CDSs conserved in both X. campestris pv. campestris and S. maltophilia and missing in X. fastidiosa; Figure 4A). The
number of ancestral genes inherited from the progenitor
of the Xanthomonas genus is higher in X. axonopodis pv.
vesicatoria than in any other species of the Hrp Xanthomonas group (2809 ancestral genes present in X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria = the number of CDSs of X.

genome CDS correspond to the 1256 orthologs shared by the nine Xanthomonadaceae

axonopodis pv. vesicatoria conserved in X. albilineans or S.
maltophilia; Figure 4A). Interestingly, X. oryzae pv. oryzae
strain MAFF 311018 contains the smallest number of
genes lost by X. albilineans or X. fastidiosa, indicating that
a significant number of genes lost by X. albilineans or X.
fastidiosa were also lost by the xylem-invading pathogen X.
oryzae pv. oryzae (Figure 4A). On the basis of OrthoMCL
analysis including both X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 and
X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c, 512 ancestral genes were lost by
both X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa (512 = number of
orthologs shared only by X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria
strain 85-10 and S. maltophilia strain R551-3, Figure 4B),
960 ancestral genes were lost only by X. fastidiosa (960 =
613 + 290 + 57 = number of CDSs of X. albilineans strain
GPE PC73 conserved in X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain
85-10 or S. maltophilia strain R551-3 and missing in X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c, Figure 4B), and 182 ancestral genes
were lost only by X. albilineans (182 = 63 + 39 + 80 =
number of CDSs of X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c conserved in
X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain 85-10 or S. maltophilia
strain R551-3 and missing in X. albilineans strain GPE
PC73, Figure 4B).
Comparison of the reductive evolutions of X. albilineans
and X. fastidiosa
Further comparative analyses were performed to compare
genome erosion in X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa. For

these analyses, we selected the genome of X. axonopodis pv.
vesicatoria, which contains the highest number of genes
inherited from the progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus
(Figure 4A). OrthoMCL analysis identified 3004 CDSs of
X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria that do not include any transposase genes and that are shared either by X. albilineans
strain GPE PC73, X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c or one of the two
S. maltophilia strains K279a and R551-3. For each of the
3004 CDSs, we looked for the best BLAST hit within a
database that included: (i) all annotated CDSs from the
genome sequence of X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 and
(ii) all available sequences from public databases excluding all sequences from the xanthomonads. On the basis of
these analyses and among the 3004 CDSs, we selected the
genes for which the best BLAST hit belonged to X. albilineans, X. fastidiosa or S. maltophilia. We made the hypothesis that these genes were inherited by X. axonopodis pv.
vesicatoria from the ancestor of the xanthomonads. These
best BLAST hit analyses confirmed that 2864 of these
3004 CDSs have the same ancestor as genes present either
in X. albilineans, X. fastidiosa or S. maltophilia and were
therefore inherited by X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria from the
progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus. The elimination of
paralogs present in at least two copies in X. axonopodis pv.
vesicatoria generated a list of 2816 CDSs representing one
copy of each gene inherited by X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria
from the progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus. These

between 10417-10686 bp. Bootstrap percentages retrieved in 500 replications are shown at the nodes. The scale bar (0.2) indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The long branch separating the Xanthomonadaceae from the two other
distant taxa (B. pseudomallei strain NCTC 10247 and Ralstonia solanacearum strain GMI1000) has been shortened.

2816 CDSs are listed and individually analysed in additional file 1. Among them, 1334 CDSs are shared by both
X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans (these represent the ancestral genes conserved by X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans),
480 CDSs are shared only with one of the two S. maltophilia strains (they represent the ancestral genes lost by
both X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans), 112 CDSs are shared
with X. fastidiosa but not with X. albilineans (they represent
the genes lost only by X. albilineans) and 890 CDSs are
shared with X. albilineans but not with X. fastidiosa (they
represent the genes lost only by X. fastidiosa). The distribu-

tion in functional COG categories of these 2816 CDSs is
illustrated in Figure 5.
Analyses of the arrangement of these 2816 ancestral genes
on the chromosome of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain
85-10 led to the identification of DNA regions constituting contiguous ancestral genes that are missing in X. albilineans or X. fastidiosa (Additional file 1). During the
speciation of X. fastidiosa or X. albilineans, the loss of these
DNA regions was due either to a single event of deletion
or to the cumulative effect of multiple events (pseudogPage 6 of 15

enization and short deletions). For example, the loss in X.
fastidiosa of the large DNA region constituted by ancestral
genes from XCV1928 to XCV2044 seems to be due to a
single event of deletion since all these ancestral genes are
missing in X. fastidiosa (Additional file 1). This large DNA
region lost by X. fastidiosa encodes all flagellar proteins
and several chemotaxis proteins. The sum of the length of
the ancestral genes present in this DNA region is 106,626
bp, strongly suggesting that X. fastidiosa experienced a single deletion of a DNA fragment of a larger size. The other
DNA regions constituting contiguous ancestral genes that
are missing in X. albilineans or X. fastidiosa are shorter and,
for this reason, their loss may result either from a single
event of deletion or from multiple mutational events.
Analysis of the arrangement on the chromosome of X.
axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain 85-10 of ancestral genes
absent in X. albilineans or X. fastidiosa did not allow us to
determine if the genes absent in both xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae were lost by their common ancestor or
were lost independently after their divergence.
The loss of genes by pseudogenization and short deletions
should not affect the position on the chromosome of the
genes that precede or follow the lost genes. In order to
identify ancestral genes putatively lost by pseudogenization and short deletions, we looked for ancestral lost
genes that are present on the chromosome of X. axonopodis
pv. vesicatoria between the orthologs of two ancestral
genes that are contiguous and conserved in X. fastidiosa or
X. albilineans. For example, the rpf (for regulation of pathogenicity factors) gene cluster contains in X. axonopodis pv.
vesicatoria two ancestral genes (XCV1913 and XCV1914
which are conserved in S. maltophilia) that are missing in
both X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa. The ancestral genes
XCV1912 and XCV1915 that precede and follow respectively these two lost genes are orthologs of either
Xalc_1342 and Xalc_1343 or XF1110 and XF1111 that are
contiguous in X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa, respectively.
Using the same strategy we identified 147 and 131 ancestral genes potentially lost by pseudogenization by X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans, respectively (Additional files 2
and 3).
Common genomic features of X. fastidiosa and X.
albilineans
The close relationship between X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa is illustrated by the common unique characteristics of
their enzymes involved in cellulose degradation. In these
two xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae, endoglucanase
EngXCA and 1,4-beta cellobiosidase CbhA possess a cellulose binding domain (CBD) and a long polyserine linker
(PSL) at their C termini (Table 2). The endoglucanase
EngXCA is conserved in all other Xanthomonas species and
also has a CBD, but the linker is much shorter and its serine content is much lower (Table 2). The 1,4-beta cellobiosidase CbhA is conserved in the xylem-invading

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/616

xanthomonads X. campestris pv. campestris and X. oryzae
pv. oryzae but, in these two species, CbhA does not possess
any linker nor any CBD (Table 2). The presence of a CBD
is known to increase catalytic activity by reducing the
"substrate accessibility problem" [22]. The long flexible
PSL was proposed to enhance substrate accessibility [23].
The presence of genes encoding enzymes harbouring a
PSL and a CBD provides evidence that both X. fastidiosa
and X. albilineans are adapted to use plant cell breakdown
products as carbon sources.
The OrthoMCL analyses identified 18 orthologs shared
only by X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c, X. fastidiosa strain
Temecula1 and X. albilineans GPE PC73 (corresponding to
the CDSs conserved in these three strains that are missing
in all the other six Xanthomonadaceae genome sequences
analysed herein). BLAST analyses confirmed that 11 of
these 18 CDSs are unique to X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa
(Additional file 4). Interestingly, they include the gene
metE which encodes the 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine
methyltransferase.
This
enzyme is absolutely required for the biosynthesis of
methionine and is therefore present in all Xanthomonadaceae. However, the metE gene present in the two xylemlimited Xanthomonadaceae is closer to the gene metE of
Mesorhizobium sp. (amino acid identity = 466/764 = 60%)
than the metE present in the other Xanthomonas species
and in S. maltophilia (amino acid identity 89/346 = 25%).
This strongly suggests that the progenitor of the two
xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae lost the ancestral metE
gene (which was conserved in other Xanthomonas species
and S. maltophilia) and acquired another metE by horizontal genetic transfer. The 11 genes unique to X. albilineans
and X. fastidiosa also include one cysteine protease gene,
one ABC transporter gene, one polysaccharide deacetylase
gene, one glycosyl transferase gene, one hydrolase gene,
one cell filamentation protein gene and four hypothetical
protein genes (Additional file 4).
BLAST analyses confirmed that X. albilineans, like X. fastidiosa, lacks the Hrp T3SS that is present in other Xanthomonas species and does not possess any of the known
Hrp type III effectors. The Hrp T3SS, which plays a major
role in suppressing host plant defense responses in most
other pathogenic Xanthomonas strains [24], was therefore
probably acquired after the divergence of the Hrp Xanthomonas group and xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae lineages. No remains of the Hrp gene cluster were found in
the complete genome sequence of X. albilineans strain GPE
PC73 nor in the available complete genome sequences of
X. fastidiosa.

Discussion
In their rather cloistered environmental niche inside
xylem vessels, X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa may have
largely avoided surveillance by general and specific plant

defense systems. Their lack of a T3SS of the Hrp1 or Hrp2
families may be explained by the fact that X. albilineans
and X. fastidiosa live and multiply essentially in a dead-cell
environment. However, like other bacterial vascular pathogens, they may interact with living xylem parenchyma
cells through pit membranes [25]. If they do, they do not
use a Hrp TTSS but another system that remains to be
identified. The adaptation of X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa
to a xylem-limited lifestyle is also illustrated by their
enzymes adapted to the use of plant cell breakdown products as carbon sources. The low number of genes unique
to both X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa (11, see Additional
file 4) may be explained by a very early divergence of the
two xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae lineages, possibly
followed by strong selective pressure to adapt to their different biological niches and lifestyles. X. fastidiosa is vector-transmitted by various xylem sap-feeding insects and
is able to colonize many plant species (citrus, wine grape,
coffee, alfalfa, peach, plum, almond, elm, maple, pear,
etc) (reviewed in [26]). On the other hand, X. albilineans
is mainly transmitted by mechanical means and is not
known to be insect-transmitted, and is able to colonize

only sugarcane and few other monocots in the Poaceae
family (reviewed in [8]).
The genome of X. albilineans encodes a T3SS that displays
similarities with the Burkholderia pseudomallei bsa T3SS
which belongs to the injectisome family SPI-1 (Salmonella
Pathogenicity Island -1) and which is required for the virulence of this human pathogen. The SPI-1 injectisome
family mainly includes T3SSs from human and insect bacterial pathogens or symbionts [21]. Interestingly, the
genomes of Erwinia amylovora strain Ea273 and Erwinia
tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 both contain two copies of a
SPI-1 T3SS [27,28]. The role of these SPI-1 T3SSs in these
plant-invading Erwinia spp. remains unknown. E. amylovora is insect-disseminated, although the interactions
between this pathogen and its insect hosts remain poorly
understood. It was suggested that the presence of a SPI-1
T3SS in Erwinia spp. indicates a common ancestry and
close phylogenetic relationship between Erwinia spp. and
insect-related enteric bacteria, raising the possibility that
an insect host might be serving as a mixing vessel for the
exchange of genes between Erwinia strains and other
enteric bacteria [27]. Similarly, the presence of a SPI-1

T3SS in the genome of X. albilineans could indicate an
insect-associated life style of this plant pathogen.
The MLSA performed herein resulted in a phylogenetic
tree that included X. fastidiosa into the Xanthomonas group.
This phylogenetic tree is in accordance with the presence
of the unique gum genes in both X. fastidiosa and Xanthomonas species of the Hrp Xanthomonas group. The gum
genes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides and the formation of biofilms, play
a key role in pathogenicity of these Xanthomonadaceae.
These genes, which were probably acquired by the progenitor of the Xanthomonas genus, were most likely lost by X.
albilineans and conserved by X. fastidiosa during their speciation. Our MLSA phylogenetic tree is also in accordance
with i/the presence of 11 unique genes, including metE, in
X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa, and ii/the alignment of the
5' end of the 16S RNA of Xanthomonadaceae (Additional
file 5).
Additionally, based on this MLSA, the same 480 ancestral
genes appeared to be lost by both X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa. Interestingly, 209 of the 480 ancestral genes lost by
both X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa are also absent in X.
oryzae pv. oryzae (a xylem invading pathogen belonging to
another phylogenetic clade), indicating that independent
but convergent evolution events were involved in genome
erosion of X. oryzae pv. oryzae and the xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae. Some of these genes lost by three xyleminvading pathogens are orthologous of genes with
assigned functions and are organized into clusters. The
five following ancestral gene clusters were lost by X. albilineans, X. fastidiosa and X. oryzae pv. oryzae: i/ the ancestral
genes XCV0258 to XCV265 encoding enzymes involved in

the glyoxylate cycle; ii/ the ancestral genes XCV0592 to
XCV0602 encoding enzymes involved in malonate
metabolism; iii/ the ancestral genes XCV1316 to XCV1334
including one TonB-dependant receptor gene, a two component signal transduction system (TCSTS) and chemotaxis genes, iv/ the ancestral genes XCV2187 to XCV2196
including one TCSTS and a type I secretion system and v/
the ancestral genes XCV2796 to XCV2803 encoding
enzymes involved in catabolism of polysaccharides
(Additional file 1). These examples support the hypothesis of a link between the convergent erosion of three
xylem-invading Xanthomonadaceae and the adaptation to a
same restricted environment (the xylem) in which these
lost functions are useless. However, only 38 of the 480
ancestral genes lost by both X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa
are also absent in another xylem invading pathogen, X.
campestris pv. campestris, indicating that adaptation to
xylem lifestyle favoured or allowed genome erosion, but
did not necessarily induce it. Alternatively, the convergent
genome erosion of the two xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae may be linked to similar insect-associated lifestyles
that may have favoured genome erosion because most of
the genes required for a plant-associated life style are most
likely not required for an insect-associated life style.
Similar striking convergence in fundamental genomic features associated with a restricted lifestyle is very well documented for obligate animal symbionts and pathogens,
especially for Buchnera (reviewed in [29]). In these bacteria, gene losses are non-random but can affect all functional categories. The most dramatic losses affect genes
that are involved in metabolism but are not required for
survival. Another general feature is the loss of most DNA
repair systems and transcriptional regulatory mecha-

nisms, indicating that there is reduced need for transcriptional regulation in a stable environment [29]. In X.
fastidiosa, and to a lesser extent in X. albilineans, losses also
affected genes involved in metabolism and transcriptional
regulatory mechanisms (Figure 5). Metabolic capabilities
essential for other habitats may have been lost in the
genome reduction process coincidently with the adaptation of X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans to the nutrient-poor
xylem environment. For X. fastidiosa, genome erosion has
been extreme. For example, X. fastidiosa retained only one
transcriptional sigma factor gene and one outer membrane efflux protein tolC gene, and it lost all genes
involved in synthesis of the flagellar apparatus. This
extreme erosion allowed X. fastidiosa to save energy (synthesis and operation of the flagella confer a growth disadvantage of about 2%; [30]).
In obligate animal symbionts and pathogens, the process
of genome shrinkage might have taken place in two separate stages [29]. A massive gene loss must have occurred
soon after the establishment of the obligate symbiosis,
probably by means of large deletions that eliminated a
series of contiguous genes. The large DNA region containing the flagellar genes was probably lost by X. fastidiosa
during a similar stage. The accumulation of mobile elements, representing a source of chromosomal rearrangements and gene inactivation, seems to have an important
role in this first stage. A similar process is likely responsible for the limited genome erosion of X. oryzae pv. oryzae,
which possesses a very high number of insertion
sequences (IS) covering 20% of the genome [31]. During
the second stage of genome reduction in obligate animal
symbionts and pathogens, genome shrinkage seems to
have mostly occurred through a process of gradual gene
loss, scattered along the genome. Such losses seem to follow a pattern that starts with the inactivation of a gene
(pseudogenization) by single-nucleotide mutations, and
continues with a rapid reduction in length until the original gene is completely eroded [29,32]. A similar process is
likely responsible for the genome erosions of X. fastidiosa
and X. albilineans (Additional files 2 and 3). Furthermore,
the coding density of X. fastidiosa strain Temecula1 is significantly smaller than that of xanthomonads probably
because of the degradation of ancestral genes. In X. fastidiosa strain 9a5c, the number of short annotated CDSs is
considerably higher than in other Xanthomonadaceae
(Table 1), although the functionality of these shortened
CDSs, which may result from the degradation of ancestral
genes, is questionable.
Obligate animal symbionts and pathogens display rapid
evolution and have highly biased nucleotide base compositions with elevated frequencies of adenine and thymine
(A+T) (reviewed in [29]). X. fastidiosa also displays rapid
evolution (note that the length of the branch separating X.
fastidiosa from the ancestor common to X. albilineans and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/616

X. fastidiosa is much longer, Figure 3) and has a high A+T
content in comparison with other Xanthomonadaceae
(Table 1). Furthermore, the GC skew pattern of the chromosome of X. fastidiosa has very high amplitude and contains a high number of diagram distortions (Figure 2). A
similar atypical GC skew pattern was observed for the
chromosome of a Buchnera aphidicola strain [33]. This latter atypical GC skew coincides with the loss of genes
involved in the replication restart process (recA and priA)
and may be explained by a higher frequency of cytosine
deaminations [34]. The loss of DNA repair genes recX,
dinG and dinP may explain, similarly, the very high GC
skew of X. fastidiosa. It may also explain the more extensive genome erosion of X. fastidiosa, compared to X. albilineans and X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Alternatively, the most
important factor affecting genome erosion of X. fastidiosa
may reflect the insect-associated lifestyle specific to this
Xanthomonadaceae [26].
The GC skew pattern of the X. albilineans chromosome
contains a lower number of distortions and has a significantly higher amplitude than the GC skew pattern of
other Xanthomonas species (Figure 2), indicating that no
recent events of recombination have occurred in X. albilineans. Furthermore, the synteny between the chromosomes of X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 and X. axonopodis
pv. vesicatoria strain 85-10 also indicated that recombination events were limited during the speciation of X. albilineans (Additional file 1). The limited recombination of
the chromosome of X. albilineans, its limited erosion, its
high G+C content and its low number of IS elements may
indicate that a distinctive process was responsible for the
reductive genome evolution of this pathogen.
We propose a unique mechanism of genome erosion
involving the unique toxin albicidin produced by X. albilineans. Albicidin is a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor with
50% inhibitory concentrations (40 to 50 nM) lower than
those of most quinolones [9]. DNA gyrase inhibitors
block the religation of cleaved DNA intermediate during
gyrase catalysis, resulting in lethal double-stranded DNA
breaks [9,35]. In the presence of subinhibitory doses of
DNA gyrase inhibitors, the SOS response mediates survival of the bacteria by allowing DNA replication to continue past breaks that would normally block it. In
exchange for this survival advantage, there is an increased
mutation rate because the polymerases that perform the
repair are prone to error [36,37]. Several studies showed
that subinhibitory doses of quinolones result in an
increased mutation rate in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [35,38-40]. X. albilineans has two genes conferring
resistance to albicidin: an albicidin efflux pump gene that
is present in the albicidin biosynthesis gene cluster XALB1
[20,41] and an albicidin-resistant DNA gyrase A gene elsewhere on the chromosome. This albicidin-resistant DNA
Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:616

gyrase A is unique to X. albilineans [42]. It contains a
unique insertion of 43 amino-acids length close to the
albicidin binding site. Production of albicidin in ancestral
bacteria that possessed both the albicidin biosynthesis
gene cluster and a DNA gyrase A sensitive to albicidin may
have induced genome erosion. In these ancestral bacteria,
most of the albicidin molecules were secreted by the albicidin efflux pump. Occasionally, molecules of albicidin
that were not secreted most likely had the same effect as
subinhibitory doses of quinolones: the SOS response was
induced, thus resulting in DNA repair, recombination and
mutagenesis. Successive and cumulative effect of albicidin
at each replication cycle eventually resulted in genome
erosion. The genome erosion induced by albicidin was
likely arrested by evolution of the albicidin-resistant DNA
gyrase A.
Acquisition of the albicidin biosynthesis genes by the
ancestor of X. albilineans conferred a selective advantage
because of the potent antibiotic activity of albicidin. The
DNA damage caused by albicidin may rapidly have
induced the mutation of DNA gyrase A gene and thus
stopped the process of genome erosion, possibly explaining the distinctive genomic characteristics of X. albilineans.
Albicidin inhibits the growth of X. axonopodis pv. vesicatoria (data not shown), suggesting that the DNA gyrase A of
the ancestral Xanthomonas was sensitive to albicidin.
Transfer of the albicidin biosynthesis gene cluster to X.
axonopodis pv. vesicatoria led to production of functional
albicidin [43], demonstrating that the production of albicidin per se is not lethal for a producer that possesses an
albicidin-sensitive DNA gyrase A. No remains of the albicidin biosynthesis genes were found in the complete
genome sequences of X. fastidiosa. Therefore, albicidin is
most likely not responsible for genome erosion of X. fastidiosa. However, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that
albicidin biosynthesis genes were lost during evolution of
X. fastidiosa. For example, cluster XALB1 could have been
lost concurrently with the flagellar biosynthesis gene cluster because these two gene clusters are close on the chromosome of X. albilineans.

Conclusions
During their descent from a common ancestral parent, the
two xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae experienced a convergent reductive evolution. Adaptation to the nutrientpoor xylem elements and to the cloistered environmental
niche of xylem vessels probably favoured this convergent
evolution. Alternatively, the most important factor affecting genome erosion of X. fastidiosa and X. albilineans may
reflect insect-associated lifestyles specific to these Xanthomonadaceae. X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa evolved differently: genome erosion has occurred to different extents
and specific genes have been acquired independently by
X. albilineans and X. fastidiosa. For example, X. albilineans
has acquired a T3SS of the SPI-1 family that is mainly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/616

found in free-living animal pathogens and four NRPS
gene clusters that are involved in the biosynthesis of albicidin and probably other unknown small molecules. The
toxin albicidin may be responsible for the distinctive
genome erosion of X. albilineans. Much progress has been
recently made in understanding how X. fastidiosa spreads
within the xylem vessels as well as the traits that contribute to its acquisition and transmission by sharpshooter
vectors (For review, [26]). A similar in-depth functional
analysis will be necessary to identify the genes that are
required for X. albilineans to spread and succeed within
sugarcane xylem vessels.

Methods
Bacterial strain
X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 was isolated from a diseased stalk of sugarcane cv. H63-1418 in Guadeloupe
(France, [11]). Sequenced strain GPE PC73 is referred to
as CFBP 7063 in the French Collection of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria ([44]http://www.angers.inra.fr/cfbp/).
Genome sequencing, assembly and finishing
The complete genome sequence of X. albilineans was
determined using the whole-genome shotgun method.
Three libraries (A, B, and C) were constructed; two of
them were obtained after mechanical shearing of genomic
DNA and cloning of generated 3 Kbp and 10 Kbp inserts
into plasmids pcdna2,1 (Invitrogen) (A) and pCNS (B)
(pSU18 derived), respectively. Larger DNA fragments of
about 25 Kbp (generated after partial digestion with
Sau3A) were introduced into plasmid pBeloBac11 to generate a BAC library (C). Plasmid DNAs were purified and
end-sequenced (33792 clones for A, 10752 for B and
4800 for C) by dye-terminator chemistry with ABI3730
sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) leading to an approximately 17-fold coverage. The Phred/
Phrap/Consed
software
package
([45]http://
www.phrap.com) was used for sequence assembly and
quality assessment. A total of 2151 additional sequence
reactions were necessary for gap closure and sequence polishing that consisted of random sequencing of subclones
(for 1625 sequence reactions) supplemented with 145
sequences of PCR-products and 381 sequences of oligonucleotide-targeted regions. Final error estimation rate as
computed by phred/phrap/consed was less than 0.04
errors per 10 Kbp. The sequences reported here have been
deposited in the EMBL GenBank database, and accession
numbers are FP565176, FP340279, FP340278 and
FP340277 for the chromosome and for plasmids plasmI,
plasmII and plasmIII, respectively.
Gene prediction and annotation
Sequence analysis and annotation were performed using
iANT (integrated ANnotation Tool; [46]) as described for
R. solanacearum [47]. The probabilistic Markov model for
coding regions used by the gene prediction software

FrameD [48] was constructed with a set of CDS sequences
obtained from the public databank Swiss-Prot as revealed
by BLASTX analysis. The alternative matrices were built
using genes first identified in ACURs (Alternative Codon
Usage Regions) based on homology and taken from the R.
solanacearum annotation process [47]. Predicted CDSs
were reviewed individually by gene annotators for start
codon assignment. The corresponding products were
automatically annotated using a protocol based on
HAMAP scan [49], InterPro domain annotation and
BLASTP analysis. Results were individually expertized to
generate the proposed annotations. Proteins were classified according to MultiFun classification [50]. The complete annotated genetic map, search tools (SRS, BLAST),
annotation and process classification are available at
http://iant.toulouse.inra.fr/X.albilineans[51].
Phylogenetic analysis
A phylogenetic tree was constructed from MLSA, with the
maximum likelihood method and GTR as substitution
model (with I: 0.01 and G: 0.52). The seven loci chosen,
gyrB, groEL, recA, dnaK, efp, atpD and glnA, are typically
selected housekeeping genes located at the following positions of the X. albilineans chromosome: 0.004, 0.348,
1.369, 1.983, 2.245, 3.442, and 3.655 Mb from the origin
of replication, respectively. The total length of the concatenated group of full length CDSs nucleotide sequences
was 10417 bp-10686 bp. The tree obtained with the concatenated data set of the seven housekeeping genes was
constructed with B. pseudomallei strain NCTC 10247 as
outgroup. Multiple alignments of the nucleotide
sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes (gyrB, atpD, dnaK,
efp, groEL, glnA, recA) for the 11 taxons were performed
using ClustalW (The nucleotide alignment is provided in
Additional file 6). The phylogenetic tree was calculated
with PHYML ([52,53]; http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/; version 2.4.4).
OrthoMCL analysis
OrthoMCL clustering analyses were performed using the
following parameters: P-value Cut-off = 1 × 10-5; Percent
Identity Cut-off = 0; Percent Match Cut-off = 80; MCL Inflation = 1.5; Maximum Weight = 316. We modified
OrthoMCL analysis by inactivating the filter query
sequence during the BLASTP pre-process. All CDSs of X.
axonopodis pv. vesicatoria strain 80-15 listed in Additional
file 1 were assessed as having a best BLASTP hit within
sequences belonging to X. albilineans, X. fastidiosa or S. maltophilia. Best BLASTP hit analyses were performed with
database UniProt by excluding all accessions from the xanthomonads using expectation value lower than 1 × 10-5.
