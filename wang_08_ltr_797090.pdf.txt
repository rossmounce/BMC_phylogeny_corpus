Abstract
Background: Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR elements) are ubiquitous Eukaryotic
TEs that transpose through RNA intermediates. Accounting for significant proportion of many
plant genomes, LTR elements have been well established as one of the major forces underlying the
evolution of plant genome size, structure and function. The accessibility of more than 40% of
genomic sequences of the model legume Medicago truncatula (Mt) has made the comprehensive
study of its LTR elements possible.
Results: We use a newly developed tool LTR_FINDER to identify LTR retrotransposons in the Mt
genome and detect 526 full-length elements as well as a great number of copies related to them.
These elements constitute about 9.6% of currently available genomic sequences. They are classified
into 85 families of which 64 are reported for the first time. The majority of the LTR
retrotransposons belong to either Copia or Gypsy superfamily and the others are categorized as
TRIMs or LARDs by their length. We find that the copy-number of Copia-like families is 3 times
more than that of Gypsy-like ones but the latter contribute more to the genome. The analysis of
PBS and protein-coding domain structure of the LTR families reveals that they tend to use only 4–
5 types of tRNAs and many families have quite conservative ORFs besides known TE domains. For
several important families, we describe in detail their abundance, conservation, insertion time and
structure. We investigate the amplification-deletion pattern of the elements and find that the
detectable full-length elements are relatively young and most of them were inserted within the last
0.52 MY. We also estimate that more than ten million bp of the Mt genomic sequences have been
removed by the deletion of LTR elements and the removal of the full-length structures in Mt has
been more rapid than in rice.
Conclusion: This report is the first comprehensive description and analysis of LTR
retrotransposons in the Mt genome. Many important novel LTR families were discovered and their
evolution is elucidated. Our results may outline the LTR retrotransposon landscape of the model
legume.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile repetitive DNA
that have been found in virtually all eukaryotic genomes

investigated so far [1-3]. LTR retrotransposons are class I
TEs that transpose in a "copy and paste" mode via RNA
intermediates. Typical structural characters of a LTR retroPage 1 of 13

transposon include: 1) two highly similar LTR sequences
from several hundred to several thousand bp; 2) 4–6 bp
target site duplication (TSD) at its 5' and 3' ends; 3)
primer binding site (PBS) downstream of 5' LTR and polypurine tract (PPT) upstream of 3' LTR; 4) protein-coding
domains of enzymes important to retrotransposition, e.g.
Capsid protein (GAG), Aspartic Proteinase (AP), Reverse
Transcriptase (RT), Integrase (IN), and RNase H (RH).
Sometimes Envelope protein (ENV) may occur as well [4].
In the plant kingdom, LTR elements present a significant
fraction of many genomes and even make predominant
components of large genomes [5-7]. The amplification
and deletion of these elements is considered to be an
important mechanism underlying the remarkable
genome size variation in plants [8-11]. Moreover, LTR retrotransposons affect genome organization, gene regulation [12,13], novel gene origination [14,15] and other
genetic functions. In summary, the dynamics of LTR retrotransposons are thought to be an important source of
genome evolution.
Medicago truncatula is a model plant of the Fabaceae, the
third largest angiosperm family. Because of their vital role
in agriculture and environment [16,17], legumes have
provoked great interests. The identification and study of
LTR elements is one of the basic and indispensable step to
understand biology and evolution of this family. The
sequencing of Mt opens an unprecedented opportunity to
carry out a thorough study of it at the molecular level.
Genomic data so far released have made it possible to
explore many important facts of the Mt genome, specifically, the characteristics of LTR elements and their interactions with the host organism.
In comparison with the Gramineae, the knowledge of LTR
retrotransposons in the Fabaceae is relatively limited
[18,19]. To date, a few Mt LTR families, e.g. MEGY and
Ogre have been well documented [20-22] and some families have been deposited in Repbase [23] and TIGR Plant
Repeat Databases [24]. However, little research has been
focused on the comprehensive identification and description of LTR retrotransposons based on high-throughput
Mt genomic sequences.
Here we report the result of the computer-based analysis
of LTR retrotransposons in 233 Mb Mt BAC sequences. At
least 85 LTR families were found. We analyzed their phylogenetic relationship and structural patterns, with emphasis on several important families. We investigated the
amplification-deletion pattern of these LTR elements and
found that the removal of LTR elements in Mt has been
more rapid than in rice, and more than 10 Mb of LTR retrotransposon sequences have been lost. The present work
in about 41% of the whole-genome provides the LTR retrotransposon landscape in Medicago truncatula.

Results and Discussion
Estimation of copy-number of LTR elements
The development of ab initio algorithms [4,25,26] has
greatly promoted the identification and analysis of LTR
elements in large-scale genomic data. With predicted fulllength elements at hand, a widely adopted method to find
their related copies is to perform homology search against
the host genome. However, subregions of full-length elements may be generated through insertion of other TEs,
e.g. nested elements are caused by the insertion of LTR elements one into another [8,9]. In this report, we call these
subregions unrelated sequences. Based only on the recognition of structural characters, ab initio prediction is not
capable to provide information on such sequences. If an
element contains unrelated sequences derived from
highly abundant TEs, taking the direct matches as its copies will greatly overestimate its copy-number and exaggerate its contribution to the host genome. Therefore, we
developed an algorithm (see Methods) to discriminate
unrelated sequences and discard the matches generated by
them (pseudo-copies). Using this method we obtained a
more accurate estimation of the number of Mt LTR copies.
Overview of LTR retrotransposons
This survey identified 526 full-length LTR elements in
232996 Kb Mt BAC sequences [see Additional file 1]. The
following validation process detected more than 16000
copies, corresponding to 22470 Kb sequences, about
9.6% of all the sequences scanned. If this value is kept in
the unreleased genomic sequences, the percentage of the
LTR retrotransposons in Mt is lower than that in rice
(17%–22%) [7,27], yet still remarkably higher than that
in Arabidopsis thaliana (1–2%) [28]. The length of the fulllength elements is within the ranges of 364 bp to 18.7 Kb
and that of the LTRs is 126 bp to 3.5 Kb [see Additional
file 2]. Most of the elements showed canonical TG-CA
boxes and 4–6 bp TSDs.

In this report, We define the LTR family by DNA sequence
similarity, following the suggestion of Wicker et al. [3]:
two elements belong to the same family if they share 80%
(or more) sequence identity in at least 80% of their coding
region or internal domain, or within their LTR, or in both.
A novel family is discovered when the following standards
are met: 1) None of the members in the family belong to
the same family with known legume LTR retrotransposons. 2) Besides a full-length member, the family has at
least one strong hit (also called strong-hit copies. See
Methods).
The 526 full-length elements and their related copies thus
were classified into 85 families, of which 64 were identified for the first time. The information of these families is
listed in Table 1. LTR families are denoted as MtrXX (XX
are digits) and the last two columns of Table 1 list the

number of full-length and strong-hit copies because these
two values provide multi-copy supports for a family. The
following sections sometimes mention the total copynumber of a family and the length of its sequences. Such
values, however, are estimated by all copies of that family,
including full-length, strong-hit and other truncated ones.
Phylogenetic analysis classified 74 families as Copia or
Gypsy superfamily (Figure 1) and the rest 11, though
quite abundant in genome, could not be categorized as
either superfamily by their protein-coding domain organization or sequence similarity. We found that half of the
11 families had long ORFs in their internal domain and
some ORFs showed a certain degree of homology with
known TE proteins. These families were categorized into
TRIMs or LARDs group (TRIMs-LARDs) by their length
[3].
Protein domain organization and phylogenetic
relationships within LTR families
We analyzed protein-domain organization of the 85 families (see Methods) and found 9 patterns (Table 2 and [see
Additional file 3]). HMMER detected the canonical Copia
and Gypsy domain structures, i.e. 5'-GAG-IN-RT-3' and 5'GAG-RT-IN-3', in 35 and 14 families, respectively.
Although it failed to detect the GAG proteins in 21 families, they could still be categorized by the order of their RT
and IN in the POL. Mtr3, Mtr5 and Mtr62 had RT but not
IN, and they were assigned to either superfamilies by
sequence similarity of RT domain (The reason of this

assignment is explained in next paragraph): Mtr3 and
Mtr5 were categorized as Copia superfamily while Mtr62
as Gypsy superfamily. At last, we obtained 56 Copia-like
and 18 Gypsy-like families. Using a RT of Bel-Pao element
(BEL-1-I_NVp from Repbase) as outgroup, we constructed
the NJ phylogenetic tree of the 74 families based on their
RT similarity (Figure 1). The tree branched into two clades
and this split was well supported (bootstrap value:
100%). In the tree, the superfamily label of each external
node was given according to the order of domains. It is
worth noting that the two clades consist of neither more
nor less than members of two superfamilies, respectively.
In other words, the categorization of superfamily based
on RT similarity concurs with that based on domain
organization. This means that RT similarity is enough to
categorize LTR elements at the level of superfamily. In Figure 1, Mtr3, Mtr5, and Mtr62 are also drawn with others,
but the tree topology do not change if they are deleted.
These results support their earlier categorization by RT
similarity.
To reveal the phylogenetic relationships within the superfamilies, we collected from literatures RT domains of 158
reference elements representing known Eukaryotic LTR
lineages [21,29-31] and combined these data with our 74
families to construct trees [see Additional file 4]. We
found that the Copia-like families belonged to 10 clades.
MTC-1, a new lineage composed of Mtr5, Mtr49 and
Mtr55, was recognized with middle support (Bootstrap

RT phylogenetic tree of 74 LTR families
RT phylogenetic tree of 74 LTR families. A Bel-Pao type RT (BEL-1-I_NVp from Repbase) is used as outgroup. The 74
families are grouped into Copia or Gypsy superfamily. In the tree, each family is described by its name and a superfamily label.
The superfamily label is given according to the order of domains in the POL. RT similarity and domain organization give consistent categorization. Mtr3, Mtr5 and Mtr62 lack other domains except RT, so they are categorized directly though RT similarity and are marked by the lowercase initials of the superfamilies. The 14 clades, to which the 74 families belong, are shown
in the figure. The placement of Mtr3 and Mtr39 is unresolved and they are marked by grey dots [see Additional file 4].
value: 62%). The Gypsy-like families belonged to 4 well
defined lineages (Figure 1).
PBS pattern of LTR elements
We investigated TSD, PPT and PBS patterns of LTR elements. Although the TSDs and PPTs did not show significant sequence preference, we found clear tRNA usage bias
through the PBS strings. The validation of a PBS sequence
was to find the string which was located immediately
downstream of the 5' LTR and a reverse complement to
the 3' ends of a tRNA [32]. By the criterion of matching at
least 14 bp, the PBSs were detected in 80 families, includ-

ing all members in Copia and Gypsy superfamilies and 6
other families. We found that tRNAs corresponding to
His, Phe, Tyr, Ser and Cys were never used as primer of
reverse transcription and the majority of the rest 15 actually detected tRNA types occurred with low frequency. By
contrast, the most-detected 4 types were used by nearly 3/
4 families. Moreover, tRNAMet occurred in about 60% of
the 80 families and was the most frequently used type in
both superfamilies and TRIMs-LARDs. tRNAArg was the
second important primer in Gypsy superfamily and was
only used by this group (Table 3 and [see Additional file
3]).

significant match to this ORF, it showed quite high conservation among the family members (Figure 2b). Moreover, we found that a 258 bp subregion in this ORF
matched the putative ENV protein of the Glycine max putative endogenous retrovirus SIRE1-8 with low significance
(similarity: 22%, e-value: 0.003). These results indicated
that this ORF probably encoded a protein related to putative plant ENV.

Copia superfamily
The present research discovered 64 novel families, including 38 Copia-like, 15 Gypsy-like and 11 other ones. We
describe each group in the following three sections, with
emphasis on some important families.

The total copy-number of the 56 Copia-like families
reached 4816 and their sequences had a total length of
7164 Kb, about 3% of all genomic sequences investigated.
Full-length elements varied in length from 3 to 12.7 Kb,
with an average of 5.9 Kb. The longest family Mtr2/
COPIA4, which had more than 130 copies, was one of the
most abundant Copia-like families. We detected 3 long
ORFs in its internal domain. From 5' to 3', the first two
ORFs encoded canonical GAG-POL proteins. The third
ORF, located less than 1 Kb downstream of the POL
region, encoded a protein longer than 790AA. Although
the homology search against Uniprot [33] did not return

Besides Mtr2, there were 6 Copia-like families longer than
10 Kb and all of them had the GAG, IN and RT domains.
Mtr1 was the most abundant Copia-like family and the
second largest in all the 85 families. It had 69 full-length
members, more than 800 copies and its sequences
reached more than 2.5 Mb in length, about 36% of the
total length of the Copia-like copies. The percentage was
6.6 times as high as that of the second largest Copia-like
family Mtr2, whose sequences were 392 Kb in length. The
PBS of Mtr1 bounded tRNAMet and the length of its fulllength members and LTRs were about 12 and 1.3 Kb,
respectively. Outside Mt, the best match of its RT domain
in Uniprot was from V. vinifera (Accession: A5BWH6).
Similar to Mtr2, a third long ORF was also detected in its
internal domain (Figure 2a). However, this ORF, matching a putative uncharacterized Mt protein (Q2HU06), was
less conservative among the family members. The length
of the LTRs of Copia-like families fell within the range of
126 bp to 2 Kb, with an average of 506 bp. LTRs could be
roughly categorized into 4 zones: 100–500 bp, 600–850
bp, 1.2–1.45 Kb and >1.5 Kb. The number of families in
these zones was 39, 8, 6 and 3, respectively [see Additional file 2]. We found that long elements tended to have
long LTRs. In fact, almost all LTRs longer than 1 Kb were
from elements longer than 10 Kb. Mtr3 and Mtr18 were
exceptions. The length of the LTR of Mtr3 reached 1.28 Kb
yet that of the full length was only 6 Kb. As one of the
most abundant Copia-like retrotransposon, Mtr3 had 292
Kb sequences in the genome, It was a typical non-autonomous family since no >500 bp ORF could be detected in
its internal domain and its RT degenerated to a fragment
of 40AA.
There were 11 Copia-like families whose LTRs and fulllength sequences were shorter than 200 bp and 5 Kb,
respectively. 6 of them have been deposited in Repbase.
Mtr30/MTCOPIA2 and Mtr32/COP3 were quite active in
the genome and their copies corresponded to more than
200 and 109 Kb sequences, respectively. Despite short
LTRs, we detected 5'-IN-RT-3' domains in all of them and
GAG proteins in 7.
Gypsy superfamily
The 18 Gypsy-like families corresponded to 11652 Kb
sequences and constituted 5% of all genomic data. This
group had a full length of 5.1 to 18.7 Kb, with an average

chains and their orientation is indicated by the arrows above the ORF labels. Sudden collapse of similarity (e.g. 1.8–2 Kb of
Mtr8 and 2–3.5 Kb of Mtr10) is caused by the insertion or deletion events in one or two family members.

of 9.8 Kb. Their LTRs were from 313 to 3.5 Kb in length,
with an average of 1.5 Kb. Compared with Copia-like LTR
retrotransposons, Gypsy-like elements were longer in general: the great majority of Gypsy-like families had a full
length > 6 Kb and LTR >500 bp, while the full length and
the LTR of most Copia-like families were < 6 Kb and
500bp, respectively [see Additional file 2]. The total copynumber in this superfamily was 7434, about 1.5 times
more than Copia superfamily (4816). Despite fewer
members, Gypsy superfamily contributed more to the Mt
genome than Copia superfamily because of longer length
and more active amplification in the past.

clade were putative plant endogenous retroviruses, thus
the possibility that the extra ORFs in Mtr60 and Mtr64
encoded the putative ENVs was strong, although they did
not share significant similarity with the putative ENVs of
known Athila elements.

Mtr57 and Mtr59 were Ogre families [20,22] and Mtr57/
Ogre1 was the largest in all the 85 families. Our survey
detected its 114 full-length members and more than 1000
copies in total. The length of its sequences reached 4.2
Mb. Mtr70 was closely related to Mtr57 in the phylogenetic tree, and was the second longest in all the families
(The longest one is Mtr57/Ogre1). These two families
used tRNAArg as primer and their internal domain
encoded 5'-GAG-RT-RH-IN-3' proteins. We detected an
ORF of 1527 bp located upstream of the GAG and an
intron in the POL. Such phylogenetic and structural features well support that Mtr70 is a novel Ogre family.
Mtr58 was the second largest family in the Gypsy group
and the third largest in all the families. It had more than
600 copies in total and corresponded to 1.4 Mb
sequences, about 1/3 of Mtr57/Ogre1. Its full length were
about 8.8 Kb and the LTRs were 2.1 Kb in length. Its internal domain encoded 5'-GAG-PRO-RT-RH-IN-3' proteins
(Figure 2f) and its PBS matched tRNAMet well. Phylogenetically, this family belonged to the Tekay clade.

TRIMs and LARDs
Because their internal domain lacked strong homology to
any known TE proteins, the 11 families were required to
have at least 5 strong hits in the genome. The total
sequences of them were 3654 Kb in length, about 1.6% of
all data. According to the suggestion of [3], the 5 families
that had a length less than 4 Kb were classified as TRIMs
and the other 6 as LARDs.

Mtr67, Mtr60 and Mtr64 were the other 3 families longer
than >10 Kb. Similar to Copia superfamily, it was found
that, when the full-length of an element was >10 Kb, the
LTR was correspondingly >1 Kb. The only exceptional
family Mtr67 had a LTR of 720 bp. Besides normal 5'GAG-RT-RH-IN-3' domains, this family had 5 additional
>500 bp ORFs downstream of the POL. They were all
located in the complementary chain and had no match in
Uniport. However, these ORFs were quite conservative
among the family members (Figure 2g). We estimated
that these ORFs were derived from other sources and later
captured by Mtr67. The short LTR reflected short original
length of this family. Mtr60 belonged to the Athila clade
(Figure 1). Its PBS bound tRNAAsp and its protein-coding
domains organized as 5'-GAG-RT-IN-3'. Downstream of
the POL, there were two >500 bp ORFs encoding uncharacterized proteins (best match in Uniprot: A2Q2P5 and
A2Q2P6). Mtr64, the sister branch of Mtr60, also had an
extra ORF downstream of the POL. Its best match in Uniprot was from Garden asparagus (Q2AA44) and it shared
weak similarity with the first extra ORF in Mtr60 (Similarity: 24%, e-value: 2e-06). Known elements of the Athila

Mtr65 and Mtr74 were from the CRM clade, while Mtr72/
GYPSHAN and Mtr73 were from Renia. Families of these
two clades were relatively inactive in Mt: each had a copynumber <50 and corresponded to <80 Kb sequences. Even
so, they all showed multiple domains in their internal
domain [see Additional file 3].

We detected ORFs longer than 700 bp in 4 families: Mtr80
had 2 such ORFs. One shared weak similarity with a GAG
protein in rice (Q7XRT, 35%, 4 × 10-92) and the other with
a putative transposon protein in A. thaliana (Q9XH30,
27%, 2 × 10-8). Although HMMER failed to detect (evalue: 10-6) RT and IN domains in 4 of the 5 full-length
members, previous analyses suggested that Mtr80/MEGY
belonged to a distinct clade called env-class [21]. Mtr78,
Mtr82 and Mtr76 each had only one ORF >700 bp. The
best Uniprot match of the ORF in Mtr78 was again
Q9XH30 (24%, 2 × 10-9), while that of the ORF in Mtr82
was an uncharacterized protein from grape (AB5PC1,
46%, 3 × 10-57). The ORF in Mtr76 was highly similar to
that in Mtr82 (80.1%) and a subregion in this ORF was
reported as a GAG by HMMER (Figure 2h).
Mtr81 is the longest family in the 11. Although its internal
domain was long, most members in this family rarely contained long ORFs. Searching the internal domain against
Uniprot with BLASTX retrieved a 438 bp region homologous to some RT proteins and the best well-studied match
was from the maize (Zea mays) Opie element (Q8H7T1,
60%, 1 × 10-48). The high similarity with Opie strongly
supported that this ORF did encode a RT domain. However, it could not be detected by HMMER and this indicated that this RT might be not built in current RT profiles.
Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that it belonged to
neither Copia nor Gypsy superfamily but was close to the
outgroup [see Additional file 5]. Further investigation is
needed to fully resolve its position.
The last family that shared homology with known TE proteins was Mtr85. It had a ~321 bp ORF encoding a fragment of RH (A4PUT7, similarity: 91%, e-value: 1 × 10-49).

Each of the other 5 families had more than 10 strong hits
and quite large copy-number in the genome. Mtr75 was
the shortest family, of which the full-length members and
the LTRs were only 364 and 130 bp in length, respectively.
Instead of typical 5'-TG-3', 5' ends of its LTRs were 5'-TA3'. Despite highly degenerated internal domain, this family had 9 full-length members and 74 strong hits. Mtr77,
Mtr83 and Mtr84 were LARDs. Similar to Mtr75, Mtr77
was an abundant non-autonomous family with highly
degenerated internal domain (about 200 bp).
Structure of LTR retrotransposons in Mt
We studied the structure of the LTR families and Figure 2
displays the structures of 8 highly abundant ones, five of
which have been described above. The structure of Ogre
elements is not shown because it has been reported previously [22]. Here we just point out that the LTR regions of
most families tend to be less conservative among the family members in comparison with TE proteins, as well as
many long ORFs. This result well supports that LTRs are
the most rapidly evolving regions in LTR retrotransposons
[3,34].
Insertion-deletion of LTR retrotransposons in Mt
Mtr1, Mtr2, Mtr6, Mtr10, Mtr57-59 and Mtr76 each had
more than 10 full-length members. The total number of
these full-length copies was 296, making up 56.3% of all
the full-length elements identified. Their total copies constituted 45.3% of the LTR retrotransposon sequences.

Paleontology analysis on the 296 elements revealed that
they were quite young: all were inserted within the last 2
MY and 90% within 0.4 MY. Compared with others, the
active period of Mtr6 (10 full-length copies) and Mtr76
(17 full-length copies) was relatively long [see Additional
file 6]. Recent researches have argued that truncated LTR
elements were mainly caused by unequal homologous or
illegitimate recombination within genome and the result
of recombination was the deletion of genomic sequences
[27,32,35,36]. We estimated the deletion of LTR copies in
Mt genome from two aspects: 1) the deletion of fulllength structure and 2) the number of DNA loss. The deletion of a full-length structure means that mutation and
recombination remove so many structural characters of a
full-length element that it can not be recognized any
more. Assuming that repetitive sequences are removed at
a constant rate, the survival time of full-length structure
obeys an exponential distribution and therefore the halflife is an index to estimate the speed of removal. With this
method, [32] estimated that the half-life of the full-length
elements in rice was about 0.79 MY.
We calculated the insertion date of all the 526 full-length
elements and found that 90% of them inserted within the
last 0.52 MY (Figure 3a). Fitting of the distribution to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/382

exponential function obtained α = -2.71, which corresponded to a half-life τ = 0.26 MY (Figure 3b). The bootstrap revealed that the half-life varied between 0.24 to 0.3
MY. To compare the speed of removal in legume and
grass, we calculated the half-life for 705 full-length elements in the two sequenced rice genomes (Oryza sativa
indica ssp. and japonica ssp.). Elements in rice and Mt were
predicted under the same parameters (Hao Wang, unpublished data). As can be seen from Figure 3c and 3d, our
data supported that the half-life of full-length structure in
rice was ~0.4 MY, a lesser value than the estimation of [32]
but still greater than that in Mt. Furthermore, statistical
testing revealed that the insertion dates in the two species
were from different distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, P-Value: 3.4 × 10-14). If the mean substitution rates of
LTR elements in Mt and grass are approximately the same
[37], the above results support that the full-length structures have been deleted more rapid in Mt than in rice. If
the deletions have been occurred randomly in genome,
the results further indicate that the removal of LTR elements in Mt has been more rapid than in rice.
The total number of the strong hits was only 6% of all
detected copies, but their size reached 42%. This indicated
that LTR elements in Mt were highly fragmented and these
truncated copies, great in number, might be generated by
the removal of genomic DNA. If the truncated LTR copies
were real vestiges of paralogous copies of families and if
they had similar lengthes to the representative copies at
the time of insertion, the difference of the length of truncated and representative copies provided the amount of
deleted DNA since their insertion [36]. The estimation of
the upper and lower limits of DNA loss could be as follows: we used the copies of Rset (see Methods) to estimate
the lower limit. The data revealed that 5.5 Mb sequences
have been deleted. Since Rset only consisted of not-soseverely truncated copies, it caused an underestimate of
DNA loss. In contrast, we used all the truncated copies to
estimate the upper limit and this gave more than 46 Mb
of DNA has been removed. Since only 40% of the genome
was analyzed here, we estimated that more than 10 Mb of
LTR retrotransposon sequences have been deleted from
the Mt genome.

Conclusion
We have systematically identified and described LTR retrotransposons in nearly half of the Medicago truncatula
genome, investigated their classification, structure, evolutionary dynamics and impact on the evolution of the host
genome. The present work has provided a LTR retrotransposon landscape for this model legume. The sequencing
of other species such as Lotus japonicus and Glycine max
will provide great opportunity to study comparatively the
evolutionary dynamics of LTR families in two or more leg-

developed ab initio tool for the prediction of full-length
LTR retrotransposons [25].

Methods

Mining LTR retrotransposons in Medicago truncatula
genome
We first identified candidates of full-length element with
LTR_FINDER, then annotated other copies related to
them in the genome by homology search and the elimination of pseudo-copies. At last, only the candidates that
had multiple copies were kept as LTR retrotransposons for
further analysis.

Genomic sequences, LTR element databases and tRNA
database
The Mt genomic data were composed of 1826 BACs,
about 233 Mb in length. The data were downloaded from
Medicago truncatula Sequencing Resources website (Version 1.0. Released on July, 2006) [38].

A database of known legume LTR retrotransposons was
constructed by extracting legume elements from literatures [21,29-31], Repbase [23] and TIGR Plant Repeat
Databases [24]. This database was used to discriminate
previously reported families from novel ones discovered
in this research. A Mt tRNA database was also built by
scanning the genome with tRNAscan-SE [39]. It was used
to detect PBS of LTR elements by LTR_FINDER, our newly

The initial LTR_FINDER scan retrieved more than 600
candidates. They were then subjected to the following
steps to validate copies.
1. Selected reliable LTR copies of candidates (Rset). The
Mt genome was searched against each LTR candidate and
all the matches longer than 100 bp were taken as the basic
Page 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:382

set of copies related to that candidate. This basic set were
partitioned into two sets: Part I and Part II. Part I (called
Rset) consisted of matches that covered both the LTR
region and internal domain to a certain length (Figure 4),
which, obviously, was a subset of all copies because it
excluded severely truncated ones. Part II consisted of other
matches. Since this set might contain pseudo-copies generated by unrelated sequences, it is processed by the following two steps to eliminate pseudo-copies.
2. Detected unrelated sequences derived from other LTR
elements and eliminated their pseudo-copies. The internal domain of each candidate was searched against all the
candidates to find whether it contained other LTR retrotransposons. The subregions derived from other candidates were recorded as unrelated sequences. Accordingly,
the matches generated by such subregions were eliminated from Part II.
3. Detected unrelated sequences derived from other TEs
and eliminated their pseudo-copies. When an unrelated
sequence was derived from an abundant TE, it would have
many matches in the genome. Therefore, if the subregions
of the internal domain had significantly high number of
matches, the possibility that they were unrelated
sequences was high (Figure 4). We used a sliding window
to find such subregions:

Figure 4
Homologous matches of an candidate
Homologous matches of an candidate. The lines represent matches generated by whole-genome homology search
of a reference candidate. Some matches are made of several
pieces (segments on the same horizontal line). All the
matches are categorized into Part I and Part II. Part I (Rset)
consists of the matches that cover both the LTR region and
the internal domain. They are reliable copies of the reference
candidate. Part II is further classified into pseudo-copies and
"copies in part II". Pseudo-copies are the matches that correspond to unrelated sequences. Unrelated sequences (dark
grey regions) are the subregions that have significantly high
matches (grey stripes) or that match some LTR elements
well (not showing here). At last, "copies in part II" and Rset
are combined to obtain the total copies of the candidate.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/382

(a) A window of size w (say 100 bp) moved from 5' to 3'
along the internal domain and stopped at the first position that at least k (say 20) hits were found in it. Here a hit
was a member of Part II that covered at least 80% of the
window.
(b) The window extended 1 bp and was checked if it still
had k (or more) hits. The extension continued until less
than k hits were in the window, then the current window
was marked and this completed a search cycle. the next
cycle started from the next position to the 3' end of the
window. The search continued until the window reached
the 3' end of the internal domain.
(c) All of the marked windows were checked to filter those
that obviously overlapped with TE proteins. Subsequently, the remaining windows were connected if the
distances between them were less than a threshold (say 10
bp). At last, the regions covered by such windows were
taken as unrelated sequences and their corresponding
matches were eliminated from Part II (Figure 4).
Although this simple greedy algorithm might fail to deal
with a few complicated situations, it identified most of the
pseudo-copies efficiently.
4. Obtained copies of candidates. Rset and the remaining
copies in Part II were combined to obtain the copies of the
candidates. If one locus in the genome matched several
candidates, it was assigned to the best matched one. At
last, a full-length candidate was taken as a LTR element if
it had several hits covering at least 80% of it. Such hits are
called strong hits or strong-hit copies. After the above validation, a total of 526 full-length elements and their
16565 related copies were selected. To be reliable, the
above validation excluded the matches that were shorter
than 100 bp. This might skip some severely truncated copies and thus brought some underestimation of DNA loss
and the contribution of LTR retrotransposons to the
genome.
Subsequently, full-length elements were categorized into
families by their sequence similarity [3], and the copies of
each family were obtained by combining all the copies of
its full-length members. The annotation process identified
unrelated TE sequences in elements and discarded
pseudo-copies, thus estimated the contribution of LTR
elements to the genome more accurately.
TE domain identification
LTR_FINDER tried to detect ORFs of RT, IN and RH in the
full-length elements by calling PS_SCAN [25,40]. Besides
this, we scanned them (e-value: 10-6) with the hmmsearch
program in the HMMER package [41] to locate positions
of important domains. The profiles were downloaded

directly from Pfam (V22.0) [42]. According to the suggestion of [26], TE domains were represented by the following profiles: RT by PF00078, PF07727 and PF05380; IN by
PF00665, PF00552 and PF02022; PRO by PF00026 and
PF00077; RH by PF00075; GAG by PF03732 and
PF00098; and ENV by PF03078. We note that the scan
process may skip some domains if they are highly divergent among different retrotransposon families or not built
in Pfam profiles.
Phylogenetic and statistical analysis
The phylogenetic tree and multiple alignments were constructed by CLUSTALW [43]. The tree was edited with
MEGA4 [44]. Statistical analyses were performed by R
[45]. Following the suggestion of [37], 1.3 × 10-8/site/yr
was used as the average substitution rate of Mt LTR elements to obtain the insertion date of elements.

Authors' contributions
HW designed and carried out the LTR retrotransposon
studies, participated in the design of LTR retrotransposon
mining program and drafted the manuscript. J-SL participated in the design of the program of LTR copy validation.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
