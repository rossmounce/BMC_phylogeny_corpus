Abstract
Background: Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) are essential immuno-surveillance
molecules. They are expressed on natural killer and T cells, and interact with human leukocyte
antigens. KIR genes are highly polymorphic and contribute vital variability to our immune system.
Numerous KIR genes, belonging to five distinct lineages, have been identified in all primates
examined thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving. Since few KIR remain orthologous between
species, with only one of them, KIR2DL4, shown to be common to human, apes and monkeys, the
evolution of the KIR gene family in primates remains unclear.
Results: Using comparative analyses, we have identified the ancestral KIR lineage (provisionally
named KIR3DL0) in primates. We show KIR3DL0 to be highly conserved with the identification of
orthologues in human (Homo sapiens), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla),
rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). We predict KIR3DL0
to encode a functional molecule in all primates by demonstrating expression in human, chimpanzee
and rhesus monkey. Using the rhesus monkey as a model, we further show the expression profile
to be typical of KIR by quantitative measurement of KIR3DL0 from an enriched population of
natural killer cells.
Conclusion: One reason why KIR3DL0 may have escaped discovery for so long is that, in human,
it maps in between two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor clusters outside the
known KIR gene cluster on Chromosome 19. Based on genomic, cDNA, expression and
phylogenetic data, we report a novel lineage of immunoglobulin receptors belonging to the KIR
family, which is highly conserved throughout 50 million years of primate evolution.

Background
The Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) gene family encodes Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
class I specific receptors that are expressed on Natural
Killer (NK) and T cells [1,2]. In humans, these are
encoded within the Leukocyte Receptor Complex (LRC)
[3] on Chromosome 19q13.4, which like the MHC on
Chromosome 6p21.3, is a region characteristic of
immune loci: highly plastic, polygenic, polymorphic, rapidly evolving, and associated with disease [4]. As a result,
KIR diversity contributes vital variability to our immune
system with direct implications for health and disease
[5,6]. KIR working in concert with its Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) ligands has been shown to influence
directly the resolution of viral infections such as Hepatitis
C Virus [7].
Numerous KIR genes, both in their activating and inhibitory forms, have been identified in all primates examined
thus far and shown to be rapidly evolving [8-11]. Inhibitory KIR have longer cytoplasmic tails in comparison to
activating KIR, and typically contain two immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) which are
responsible for repressing the immunoreactivity of NK
cells. The emergence of primate activating KIRs can be
accounted by two processes: the alteration in the length
and sequence of the cytoplasmic tail in an ancestral longtailed KIR to eliminate the ITIMs, accompanied by nucleotide changes in the transmembrane (TM) domain to
introduce a charged residue [12]. Another distinguishing
feature of KIR molecules is the number of extracellular
immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, numbered D0, D1 and
D2. Although KIR2DL4 is conserved in all primates studied to date [11], it is unlikely to represent the ancestral KIR
gene. Structurally, KIR2DL4 has a D0+D2 organisation
and has arisen by exon loss from a three Ig-containing
progenitor. The ITIMs present in the cytoplasmic tail are
also not conserved between all primates: monkeys have
two, apes have only one, and in some cases, the motif has
diverged from the consensus (gorilla) [13]. KIR2DL4 has
a charged amino acid in the TM region, and in this respect,
could act as an activating KIR [8]. It binds the non-polymorphic HLA-G molecule, and this may explain why this
gene has remained relatively unchanged since the last
common ancestor. Here we report a novel lineage (provisionally named KIR3DL0) and show it to be divergent to
the previously identified lineages and conserved throughout 50 million years of primate evolution. Characteristics
that would be expected to be present in the common
ancestral primate KIR, such as three Ig domains, a long
cytoplasmic tail, and two ITIMs providing an inhibitory
function, are all present in the KIR3DL0 lineage. For the
purpose of this report, we define 'ancestral' as the phylogenetically most diverged gene. In support of this discov-

ery, we present genomic, cDNA, expression and
phylogenetic data.

Results and discussion
Identification of the KIR3DL0 locus
Although still located within the LRC [3,14], the human
KIR3DL0 locus maps approximately 180 kb centromeric
to the known KIR cluster (Figure 1A). This location in
between the two related leukocyte immunoglobulin-like
receptor (LILR) clusters may explain why this gene has
escaped discovery for so long. Despite its location outside
of the KIR cluster, KIR3DL0 is clearly more related phylogenetically to KIR genes than to any other Ig-containing
gene within the LRC (Figure 1B).

All KIR family members share a comparable gene structure; discrete exons encode the signal peptide, either two
or three extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a stem,
transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. As we
show below, the genomic sequence for KIR3DL0 is characteristic of KIR and highly conserved in all primates (Figure 2), but, in human, a single deletion of seven
nucleotides at the end of the third immunoglobulin
domain (IgD2) in exon 5 leads to a frameshift, preventing
it from being expressed on the cell surface. Because of the
deletion, it uses alternative reading frames for the end of
exon 5 and exons 6/7, resulting in a potentially secreted
form of KIR3DL0 with no TM and cytoplasmic domains.
The only possibility of the KIR3DL0 receptor remaining
membrane-bound would be an association with the adaptor molecule DAP12 mediated by a charged amino acid in
the TM. DAP12 is able to stimulate cytotoxic activity as it
contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
motif and is the mode in which activating KIRs have an
effect. Although the frameshift has resulted in the presence of a charged amino acid (K) in the terminal exon
(exon 7), the deduced amino acid sequence does not correspond to a TM or core hydrophobic region, which
makes the association with DAP12 less likely in this case.
Human KIR3DL0 is based on a full-length cDNA isolated
from a human NK cell line (NK-92), and is further supported by a partial cDNA sequence [GenBank:BC033195]
from the mammalian gene collection (MGC), isolated
from a different human NK cell line (NIH_MGC_106). In
order to check for polymorphism, 86 unrelated healthy
individuals were sequenced across the deleted region and
the same frameshift causing deletion was present in all
individuals.
The relatedness of KIR3DL0 to the KIR gene family is further confirmed by gene structure analyses. Using FINEX, a
method that identifies gene families based on the conservation of gene structure (intron/exon phases) rather than
sequence similarity [15], the closest relative of KIR3DL0 is
the prototypical human KIR gene KIR3DL1 with a signifi-

(A) Location of KIR3DL0 in the human LRC on chromosome 19q13.4. The LRC comprises a number of diverse genes
and gene clusters including leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs), killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs), LRC-encoded novel genes
(LENGs) and leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptors (LAIRs). Human KIR haplotypes differ in gene content; only the prototypical haplotype A is shown. (B) Phylogenetic analysis using complete protein sequences of KIR3DL0 and other Ig-domain containing receptors in the human LRC.

cant z-score of +10.88 (data not shown). Furthermore,
using VISTA [16], a global genomic comparison tool, significant conservation in both coding and non-coding
sequences is present between all primate KIR3DL0
sequences and KIR3DL1 [see Additional file 1].
Conservation of KIR3DL0 in primates
We show KIR3DL0 to be highly conserved in primates
with the identification of orthologues in the common
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and common marmoset
(Callithrix jacchus). The two copies in marmoset are
arranged in a head-to-head orientation and are likely to be
the result of a species-specific duplication event. These
non-human primates diverged from humans approximately 5, 7, 25 and 50 million years ago, respectively. In
all cases, KIR3DL0 maps to the syntenic region between
LAIR2 and LILRA2. Details of the genomic LRC organization in these primates will be described elsewhere.

The primate KIR3DL0 sequences share the same exonintron configuration and are predicted to encode functional proteins (Figure 2). In addition to the human
cDNA, full length cDNA sequences were isolated from
chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. Variations between the
genomic and cDNA sequences may indicate KIR3DL0 to
be polymorphic. Although only two sequences could be
compared per species, we identified five non-synonymous
substitutions in chimpanzee and one synonymous substitution in human. The conservation of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, present in the
cytoplasmic tail of the predicted KIR3DL0 protein
sequences from all species studied, indicates an inhibitory
function for these receptors. These motifs are present in
only one copy in marmoset, which has the complete nineexon gene structure. The short form is missing the last
three exons encoding the TM and cytoplasmic domains,
resulting in a potentially secreted form, which is similar,
but not identical, to the KIR3DL0 cDNA in human (Figure

KIR3DL02protein sequences in primates
KIR3DL0 protein sequences in primates. The multiple sequence alignment includes human (hs), common chimpanzee (pt),
gorilla (gg), rhesus monkey (mm) and common marmoset (cj). The suffixes 'c' and 'g' denote cDNA-derived or predicted from
genomic sequence, respectively. Sequences are split according to their exonic boundaries. The frameshift causing deletion of
seven bases in IgD2 of the human gene has been manually corrected by insertion of three Xs (boxed) to bring the sequence
back into frame. The human cDNA sequence is shown in italics after the frameshift as it is not part of the multiple sequence
alignment. Dots (.) indicate identity with human KIR3DL0g and dashes (-) indicate insertions/deletions of amino acids. Inversely
labeled amino acids designate polymorphic positions where one allele is identical to hsKIR3DL0g and another as indicated.
Inhibitory motifs (ITIM) are highlighted in grey. Asterisks (*) indicate cysteine residues that are likely to form disulfide bridges.
N-linked glycosylation signals (NXS/T) are shown by hashes (#) when conserved between the majority of primate sequences
and plus signs (+) when present in only marmoset. Putative beta-bulges containing the WSXS/PS or L/VSAPS motifs are delineated by double bars (=) while single bars (-) mark partially conserved motifs. Two adjacent copies of KIR3DL0 are present in
marmoset with one of them (cjKIR3DL0g2) missing the last three exons.

Expression profiles
We confirmed expression of KIR3DL0 by cDNA cloning in
human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey. The human
cDNA was cloned from an NK cell line (NK-92), and preliminary analysis shows expression in five other NK cell
lines but not in Jurkat cells (T cells) (data not shown). To
evaluate the pattern of expression in more detail, we chose
the rhesus monkey. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were obtained and NKp46+ cells, previously
shown to be enriched for NK cytolytic activity [18], were
isolated by immunoaffinity methods. Firstly, using RTPCR, a 1.4 kb cDNA was identified that encodes a protein
with 458 amino acids, and verifies the in-silico structure of
primate KIR3DL0. A second fragment was also observed
and represents an alternative splice form missing exon 5;
this variant has only two Ig domains. Secondly, levels of
KIR3DL0 mRNA in these cell populations were quantified

Phylogenetic analysis
The KIR genes identified to date have been divided into
five distinct lineages [8,9,11,13]: lineage I comprises
genes with specific domain configurations (IgD0 and
IgD2 domains), lineage II is defined by ligand specificity
(HLA-A and HLA-B), lineage III contains a mixture of KIR
genes with two or three Ig domains, lineage IV genes are
only found in rhesus monkeys, and lineage V encompasses KIR genes lacking the stem. Having established that
KIR3DL0 is conserved across species at the gene and protein levels (e.g. 33–41% similarity to human KIR3DL1
[see Additional file 2], we used phylogenetic analysis to
determine whether or not the new KIR3DL0 genes also
represent a novel KIR lineage. Using the deduced fulllength protein sequences of known primate KIR genes, the
tree shown in Figure 3 was constructed. The novel
KIR3DL0 sequences all cluster separately and with high
bootstrap confidence at the base of the tree, demonstrating that KIR3DL0 represents not only a novel but also the
ancestral lineage of primate KIR genes. In order to confirm
this finding and to assess whether, because of its location,
KIR3DL0 arose by non-homologous recombination
between KIR and LILR sequences, separate trees were also
constructed for each of the KIR3DL0 domains and the corresponding domains of KIR and LILR. Under the conditions used here (see Materials and Methods for details), all
KIR3DL0 domains clustered at the base of the KIR clade,
separated from the LILR domains [see Additional file 3].
The IgD1 domain of KIR3DL0 is more closely related to
the IgD0 domains of the KIR gene family (including the
IgD0 of KIR3DL0) in comparison to all other domains
used in the analysis.

ticular, the extra glycosylation site increases the potential
level of glycosylation. High levels of glycosylation have
been shown to be essential for secretion of some immunoglobulins [17].

by a real time RT-PCR assay. In view of data indicating that
IL-2 can increase expression of KIRs, rhesus NKp46+ cells
were also cultured in the presence of recombinant human
IL-2 for one week, and tested for KIR3DL0 mRNA expression at the end of this period. As shown in Figure 4, levels
of KIR3DL0 message were modestly enriched in NKp46+
cells compared to unfractionated PBMC for the three rhesus monkeys tested, although the relatively low number of
copies per NKp46+ cell suggests that the receptor may be
expressed by only a subset of NKp46+ cells. Culture in the
presence of IL-2 resulted in substantial upregulation of
expression of KIR3DL0 in cells from all three animals.

Conclusion
Based on comparative sequence analysis, we have identified a new lineage of immunoglobulin receptors and
show them to be part of the KIR receptor family, supported by four independent lines of evidence. (I)
Sequence similarity: Using the BLAST algorithm, the similarity on both the DNA and protein level is highest to

two murine Kirl1 and Kirl2 genes [21] lack the characteristic activating/inhibitory motifs of KIRs and map to the X
chromosome outside the otherwise conserved LRC. Likewise, the single KIR-like sequence in rat (Kir3dl1) [19]
lacks the stem region and has an elongated TM region. The
sequence has, however, the same overall (3DL) structure
as KIR3DL0 and maps to the syntenic region in the rat LRC
and, in this respect, represents the closest non-primate relative to KIR3DL0.

family. (III) Phylogenetics: Full length and domain-bydomain phylogenetic analysis cluster the new sequences
with high confidence at the base of the KIR clade. (IV)
Expression: cDNA cloning and quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrate an expression profile typical of KIR.
While the data presented here suggest 3DL0 to be the
ancestral KIR gene in primates, we cannot rule out the
possibility of selection to have caused the observed divergence. The situation in non-primates remains unclear.
Based on our own and previously reported phylogenetic
evidence [12], the primordial non-primate KIR gene
would be predicted to be a three-Ig inhibitory receptor,
most similar to KIR3DL0. Yet, we were unable to find any
significant matches to KIR3DL0 in non-primates, except
to previously reported sequences [19-23] that have higher
similarity to more recent KIRs. Recently, a cluster of CHIR
genes has been identified in chicken, but these resemble
the organisation of two-domain KIRs [24]. A possible
explanation for these observations is that KIR3DL0 has
been lost from non-primate genomes. Polyphyletic loss of
multiple human genes from non-primate vertebrate
genomes has been observed before and has led to the suggestion that such events are more frequent than previously
thought [25]. Both rapid and convergent evolution have
probably contributed to or even driven this process. In
rodents, for instance, multiple Ly49 genes, which encode
C-type lectins, carry out the KIR analogous function. The

Mapping and sequencing
BAC contigs covering the KIR region were generated and
sequenced as described previously [11]. KIR3DL0
genomic sequences were obtained as follows: for human,
using ENSEMBL [26] assembly NCBI-35; for chimpanzee,
using ENSEMBL assembly CHIMP-1; for gorilla, by BAC
sequencing [EMBL:CR759947 and EMBL:CR759950];
and
for
marmoset,
by
BAC
sequencing
[EMBL:CR925829]. The single sequence gap that covers
the transmembrane region in the CHIMP-1 assembly was
amplified and sequenced using forward (5'-caccaacattctttggagcaagtt-3') and reverse (5'-aggctgaggtggaagaatggc-3')
primers. The frameshift region in the human KIR3DL0
gene was sequenced in 86 healthy individuals (81 Caucasian, 3 African American, 1 Asian, 1 unknown ethnicity)
using forward (5'-ttccaggccaacttttctgtgg-3'), and reverse
(5'-tctgtgatccagtgggcacca-3') primers. KIR3DL0 cDNA
sequences were obtained by reverse transcription of total
RNA using Superscript (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). The macaque and chimpanzee KIR3DL0 cDNAs [GenBank:DQ224422 and
GenBank:DQ157756] were cloned by two rounds of PCR
from peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA. The first round
of PCR was performed with primers KIR3DL0-F2, 5'-ctgtgtcctgcccaatagaag-3', and KIR3DL0-R2, 5'-cctcctaggaatagatccagg-3'. For the second round, we used primers
KIR3DL0-F2 and KIR3DL0-R1, 5'-aggaatagatccaggtccttg3'. The human KIR3DL0 cDNA [GenBank:DQ224421]
was cloned by one round of PCR using the KIR3DL0-F2
and KIR3DL0-R1 primers.
Sequence analysis
Genomic sequences were analyzed using ARTEMIS [27],
ACT [28], and BLAST [29]. Multiple sequence alignments
were carried out in ClustalX [30], and edited manually to
maximize the alignment. Trees were constructed using the
Neighbour Joining method [31] in MEGA version 2.1
[32], using human KIR3DL0 derived from genomic
sequence, with the frameshift in IgD2 manually corrected
to bring the sequence back into frame. Trees were rooted
at midpoint, using a complete deletion (Figure 1B) or
pairwise deletion (Figure 3), the Poisson correction
option, and 500 bootstrap replicates. Global genomic
comparisons were made using VISTA [16]. FINEX [15] was

used in conjunction with its corresponding gene structure
database derived from EMBL version 181 (eukaryotes
only).
Expression analysis
Isolation and culture of rhesus macaque PBMC and NKp46+
lymphocytes
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from
rhesus macaque as described previously [18]. To isolate an
enriched NK cell population, PBMC were first incubated
with a PE-conjugated anti-human NKp46+ mAb (clone
BAB281, Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL), washed once,
incubated with PE-selection beads (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA)
and passed over a positive selection column for enrichment of PBMC expressing the NKp46 surface marker. Successful enrichment was verified by flow cytometric
analysis using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA); selected cells were
≥85% NKp46+. To assess induction of KIR3DL0 expression following in vitro culture with IL-2, NKp46+ cells were
cultured in RPMI-10% FBS with 100U/ml recombinant
human IL-2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 7 days. Cells
were counted, transferred into 1.5 ml RNAse-free polypropylene tubes, spun down, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Nucleic acid extraction and quantitative PCR/RT-PCR analysis
Cellular nucleic acids for qPCR and qRT-PCR were prepared with modifications to methods typically applied to
the isolation of RNA from plasma associated simian
immunodeficiency virus [33]. The disruption and suspension of cell pellets in lysis buffer was facilitated by sonication using a Branson Model S-450D sonifier equipped
with a high intensity cup horn (Branson Ultrasonics,
Corp., Danbury, CT). The final nucleic acid containing
pellet was dissolved in 60 μl 1X Turbo DNase Buffer
(Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and divided into two equal
aliquots. To one aliquot, 2 units of Turbo DNase
(Ambion, Inc., Austin TX) were added and the aliquot
incubated at 37°C. After 30 minutes, 120 μl ~5.7 M
GuSCN, 50 mM TrisCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA was added
and the sample mixed thoroughly, followed by 150 μl isopropanol to precipitate and recover nucleic acid. This
sample was dissolved in 30 μl nuclease free water supplemented to contain 1 mM DTT and 1 U/ml RNASeOUT
(Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and assayed by quantitative RT-PCR methods following the conditions and protocols described in Cline et al. [33] with the following
modifications to accommodate the increased level of cellular RNA and to specifically amplify the target KIR3DL0
mRNA sequence: in the reverse transcription step, 1.5 μg
random primers and 100 Units reverse transcriptase per
reaction were employed and the 85°C heat-kill step was
increased to 25 minutes; in the PCR step, the primers and
probe used were KIR3DLO-FOR02, 5'-tgggagcaaatccctgaa-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/209

gat-3', KIR3DLO -REV02, 5'-agcttgggtgcgctgagat-3', and
KIR3DLO -PR02, 5'-FAM-tcgtcacaggcttgtttaccaaaccctcBlackHole™ Quencher 1 (Biosearch Technologies,
Novato, CA). The remaining aliquot of nucleic acids was
heated to 100°C for 5 min, quenched on ice, and then
assayed to determine the number of cell genome equivalents represented in the original sample by quantifying
copies of a gene sequence for the chemokine receptor
CCR5 (MP, unpublished data).
