Abstract
Background: Plant hybrid proline-rich proteins (HyPRPs) are putative cell wall proteins
consisting, usually, of a repetitive proline-rich (PR) N-terminal domain and a conserved eightcysteine motif (8 CM) C-terminal domain. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HyPRPs
might provide not only insight into their so far elusive function, but also a model for other large
protein families in plants.
Results: We have performed a phylogenetic analysis of HyPRPs from seven plant species, including
representatives of gymnosperms and both monocot and dicot angiosperms. Every species studied
possesses a large family of 14–52 HyPRPs. Angiosperm HyPRPs exhibit signs of recent major
diversification involving, at least in Arabidopsis and rice, several independent tandem gene
multiplications. A distinct subfamily of relatively well-conserved C-type HyPRPs, often with long
hydrophobic PR domains, has been identified. In most of gymnosperm (pine) HyPRPs, diversity
appears within the C-type group while angiosperms have only a few of well-conserved C-type
representatives. Atypical (glycine-rich or extremely short) N-terminal domains apparently evolved
independently in multiple lineages of the HyPRP family, possibly via inversion or loss of sequences
encoding proline-rich domains. Expression profiles of potato and Arabidopsis HyPRP genes exhibit
instances of both overlapping and complementary organ distribution. The diversified non-C-type
HyPRP genes from recently amplified chromosomal clusters in Arabidopsis often share their
specialized expression profiles. C-type genes have broader expression patterns in both species
(potato and Arabidopsis), although orthologous genes exhibit some differences.
Conclusion: HyPRPs represent a dynamically evolving protein family apparently unique to seed
plants. We suggest that ancestral HyPRPs with long proline-rich domains produced the current
diversity through ongoing gene duplications accompanied by shortening, modification or loss of the
proline-rich domains. Most of the diversity in gymnosperms and angiosperms originates from
different branches of the HyPRP family. Rapid sequence diversification is consistent with only
limited requirements for structure conservation and, together with high variability of gene
expression patterns, limits the interpretation of any functional study focused on a single HyPRP gene
or a couple of HYPRP genes in single plant species.

Background
Hybrid proline-rich proteins (HyPRPs) represent a typical
example of a protein family characterized by well-defined
sequence features but little functional knowledge besides
a loosely defined role in the development or function of
the plant cell wall. Since a large part of the cellular molecular machinery is conserved across multiple kingdoms,
characterization of truly lineage-specific gene families
involved in lineage-specific biological processes or structures may provide clues for grasping the fundamentals of
the current diversity of organisms. Moreover, understanding molecular mechanisms of plant cell wall evolution,
ontogeny, and function, is of more than purely theoretical
interest. This is because cell wall properties substantially
contribute to the physical properties of plant tissues,
which are of central importance in almost all areas of
human activity concerned with plant materials (such as
food or fiber processing).
HyPRPs are characterized by the presence of two different
domains: a proline-rich N-terminal repetitive domain and
a hydrophobic C-terminal domain. Based on the prolinerich domain and a secretory signal, HyPRPs belong to the
group of secreted structural cell wall proline-rich proteins
[1]. The repetitive character and high proline content of
N-terminal domains resemble other proline-rich proteins,
though the repeated amino acid motifs vary [2]. The
hydrophobic C-terminal domain classifies HyPRPs into
the group of proteins containing the 8 CM domain [3],
together with lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), amylase
inhibitors, 2S albumins and some other subgroups. The
characteristic 8 CM domain usually consists of less than
100 amino acid residues and contains eight cysteine residues in a specific order [3]. Tertiary structure formed by
four hydrophobic helices stabilized by the conserved
cysteines has been determined for several proteins of the
family since the first reports on crystallographic analysis
of the soybean (Glycine max) hydrophobic seed protein
[4]) and NMR analysis of wheat LTP in solution [5].
Although no structural data are available for proteins of
the HyPRP subgroup, which has been, so far, analyzed
only on the sequence level, we can assume that the tertiary
structure of their C-terminal domains resembles other 8
CM proteins. However, the conserved structure does not
allow any functional predictions. It apparently serves only
as a scaffold carrying specific functional elements in various subgroups of the 8 CM family [2].
Multiple reports indicated variable patterns of HyPRP
gene expression, but the studies mostly focused on a single or a few genes. In alfalfa (Medicago sativa), expression
of MsPRP2 was induced by water deficit in salt-tolerant
plants [6], while MsACIC was transcribed in cold-tolerant
plants [7]. BNPRP from Brassica napus was also highly
expressed at low temperature. However, low levels of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/412

BNPRP transcript were also detected at standard growth
conditions [8]. Expression of SbPRP from soybean was
modulated by ABA, internal circadian rhythm and some
stress factors. The expression was induced in response to
viral infection or by salicylic acid treatment [9]. The transcript of CrHyPRP was detected in subapical stem segments of Cuscuta reflexa that were sensitive to the
induction of haustoria formation by cytokinins [10].
Gene DC 2.15 from carrot (Daucus carota) was down regulated by auxin and its expression was detected in vascular
bundles, leaves and flower discs [11]. The FaHyPRP gene
from strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) was specifically
induced in mature fruits [12]. MtPPRD1 from barrel
medic (Medicago truncatula) was specifically expressed in
the axial part of the embryo during germination and constitutively expressed in roots [13]. Maize (Zea mays)
ZmHYPRP1 transcript accumulated in parenchyma cells
of the embryo, but was undetectable in other adult plant
organs except the ovary prior to pollination [14]. The transcript of the CELP gene family of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) was specifically accumulated in flower organs [15].
The expression of HyPRP genes can vary even between
highly similar proteins in closely related species. The gene
encoding tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) TPRP-F1 was
expressed almost exclusively in immature fruits [16].
However, expression of the closely related StPRP from
potato (Solanum tuberosum) was not detected in the potato
berry, whereas a high transcript level was detected in roots
[17].
Together, these data show that expression of HyPRP genes
is highly variable. Transcripts of different genes were
detected in various stages of plant development and under
diverse conditions. Although the HyPRP genes have never
been proven to play a specific role in any biological process, the genes were found in numerous screens, probably
due to high absolute transcript levels under certain inductive conditions or at specific developmental stages.
In this paper, we present a comparative study of the
HyPRP families of potato and Arabidopsis thaliana. We
have compared experimentally determined expression
patterns of 14 potato HyPRP genes with publicly available
expression data for their orthologs and paralogs from the
Arabidopsis Genevestigator database [18]. In order to gain
a better understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of
the plant HyPRP gene family, we have performed a
detailed phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of
all available HyPRP genes sequences from additional five
seed plant species. This analysis included representatives
of both closely related (dicot) and less closely related
(monocot and gymnosperm) groups.

Results
Inventory and expression patterns of potato HyPRP genes
We initially found sequences of fourteen potato cDNAs
encoding HyPRPs (further referred to as St1 to St14) in the
public SOL Genomics Network (SGN) database (see
Methods). These were used to design specific primers for
semiquantitative RT-PCR estimation of transcript levels in
plant tissues. Subsequently, we identified two additional
genes (a partial sequence denoted St15, and St16) in the
database and included them in the bioinformatic and
phylogenetic study, although they have not been followed
experimentally (see Table 1 for a list of genes and primer
sequences).

All identified potato HyPRPs, except St15 (which is apparently N-terminally truncated), possess an unambiguous
N-terminal secretion signal. The following N-terminal
domains are predominantly repetitive, with alkaline character (isoelectric point around 8.5–10) resulting mainly
from higher content of lysine and histidine. Otherwise,
the N-terminal domains are highly variable with respect
to size, amino acid composition and repetitive sequence
motifs (Table 2). However, the 8 CM C-terminal domains

are conserved enough to allow multiple alignment construction and phylogenetic analyses. Due to small size of
these domains, only a few branches with reasonably high
bootstrap values have been identified in trees constructed
on the basis of protein sequences. The tree topology varied depending upon the method used (see Additional file
1). However, support for several clades improved dramatically when corresponding nucleotide (cDNA) sequences
were taken into account and all the stable clades from the
protein sequence-based tree were recovered (Figure 1).
Remarkably, the sequences St1 and St2 shared not only a
significant degree of similarity, but also some features of
their N-terminal domains, which are very long (over 125
residues), with a complex repetitive structure and a high
content of aliphatic amino acids (alanine, valine, leucine,
and isoleucine). We shall further refer to St1 and St2 (and
their relatives from other species – see below) as "C-type"
(conserved) HyPRPs. The majority of remaining HyPRPs
have N-terminal domains with a very low content of
aliphatic residues, usually in the context of short (0–39
residues) proline-rich domains containing di- or tripeptide repeats (consensus pattern P-X or P-S-X). Some similarities could also be identified for several other

subgroups of HyPRPs (see Table 2 and Figure 1). In particular, the N-terminal domains of St4, St7, St9, St11 and
St16, which cluster together in the C-terminal domainbased tree, have a high content of lysine, usually present
in the repetitive motif P-K. The sequences of St3, St5 and
St6 also form a stable branch in the tree and all of them
have N-terminal domains with a relatively high content of
serine and threonine.
Fourteen originally identified potato HyPRP genes were
analyzed with respect to their expression in vegetative
organs of in vitro grown potato plants – young apical
leaves, mature leaves, petioles, growing apical stems, basal
stems and roots (Figure 1). In every organ studied, each
major subgroup of HyPRPs was represented by at least
one expressed gene. While some genes were expressed
more or less exclusively in certain organs (e.g. St7 in
roots), others exhibited high expression levels in many (or
all) organs tested (e.g. St3 or St12). Divergent and, sometimes, complementary patterns of expression of closely
related genes have been observed (in particular for the
St3/St5, St1/St2, and St11/St9 pairs). For instance, St1
expression is absent in mature leaves, where St2 is
expressed, while the opposite holds for basal stems.

Comparison of the potato and Arabidopsis HyPRP gene
families
Since the potato genome is only partially sequenced, our
inventory of HyPRP genes is probably incomplete,
although highly expressed genes are likely to be included.
However, the Arabidopsis genome has been completely
sequenced and extensively annotated. A large set of transcriptome data is available for this model organism, providing information about at least one full set of
dicotyledonous plant HyPRPs.

Our BLAST searches of Arabidopsis genome sequences
revealed the presence of 28 HyPRP-encoding loci (Figure
2). This included all 23 genes reported previously by JoséEstanyol and colleagues [2], who also already noticed that
the majority of Arabidopsis HyPRPs are encoded by genes
residing in clusters of tandem duplications. We could
identify five such sets of immediately or nearly immediately adjacent HyPRP loci: two pairs on chromosome 1
(referred to as clusters 1a and 1b), two clusters on chromosome 4 (cluster 4a, consisting of 9 genes and cluster 4b
with 6 genes) and a pair on chromosome 5 (cluster 5b).
Remaining genes are located on chromosome 2 (2 loci), 3
(2 loci relatively close to each other) and 4 (2 isolated loci
and one gene close to cluster 4b). A common phylogenetic analysis of Arabidopsis and potato sequences encoding the conserved C-terminal domain grouped together a

sequences encoding the conserved C-terminal domains of HyPRPs from potato and Arabidopsis thaliana, constructed by the ML
method (see Materials and Methods). Bootstrap values above 50 % (from 500 replicates) are shown above the individual
branches, numbers below branches denote bootstrap values of a NJ tree from the same input data. The ML and NJ trees
agreed in all clades with bootstrap support over 50 % with exception of (i) swapping St1 and At1g62500 and (ii) swapping
At4g15160 and At4g15160, in both cases with NJ bootstrap values below 76 %. Arabidopsis loci are denoted by standard AGI
locus identifiers. Gene names are color-coded and typographically marked according to the composition of the N-terminal
domains of the encoded proteins as in Figure 1; in addition, proline- and glycine-rich N-terminal domains (not fitting into the
categories of proline- or glycine-rich, but containing more than 10 % of each of these amino acids) are shown in blue. Arabidopsis genes with reliable potato orthologues are denoted by black filled squares, chromosomal clusters and tandem duplications
are marked by chromosome cluster numbers to the right of the tree (see Additional file 2). Right: expression profiles of
selected Arabidopsis HyPRP genes according to the publicly available expression data: top – orthologues of potato genes (with
potato expression patterns from Figure 1 for comparison; apical stems shown in the "shoot apex" position), bottom – genes

majority of Arabidopsis sequences from chromosomal
cluster 4a with each other and cluster 4b with each other,
as well as the pair from chromosome 5 (cluster 5). This
suggests relatively recent gene duplication events. However, the immediately neighboring sequences from pairs
1a and 1b appear to be substantially divergent, indicating
either ancient gene duplication or gene conversion, i.e.
exchange of a closely related gene for its distant relative.
As in potato, we found several groups of genes with high
bootstrap values. Most notably, this was a branch of
HyPRPs sharing not only mutually related C-terminal
domains, but also long and complex N-terminal domains
rich in hydrophobic amino acid sequences. This branch
also contains both potato C-type HyPRPs (St1 and St2),
indicating that these proteins indeed deserve to be considered a specific HyPRP type. As in the case of potato, we
could recognize similarities in amino acid composition or
common sequence motifs in the N-terminal domains of
proteins located in several branches of the tree, although
the N-termini are apparently less conserved than the corresponding C-terminal domains.
To our surprise, we were barely able to find clearly defined
Arabidopsis orthologues of most of the potato genes.
Besides the two C-type genes (St1 and St2), only St10 had
a close relative with a significant bootstrap support. Moreover, 8 of the 16 potato HyPRP genes clustered into three
independent branches devoid of Arabidopsis sequences (a
branch containing St7, St8, and St16; a branch containing
St9 and St11; and a branch containing St3, St5 and St6).
This indicates that major diversification of the HyPRP
gene family took place after separation of the lineages
leading towards Solanaceae and Brassicaceae.

representatives of monocotyledonous plants, rice (Oryza
sativa), and maize (Zea mays) and a gymnosperm, loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda). We could not find any bona fide HyPRP
sequences in non-seed plants (algae, mosses and ferns; for
criteria see Materials and Methods). However, in all
angiospermous and gymnospermous species studied,
HyPRPs form large families. Our database searches
revealed 19 complete or nearly complete HyPRP cDNA
sequences from tomato, 14 from medic, 52 from maize
and 21 from pine. Thirty-one well-defined HyPRP-encoding loci (containing a putative secretory signal and a C-terminally located 8 CM domain that could be well aligned
to the potato and Arabidopsis sequences) were found in the
fully sequenced rice genome. Several other genes that
lacked parts of the conserved 8 CM domain were excluded
from further analyses (the total number of rice genes carrying some variant of the 8 CM domain exceeds sixty).
Most notably, some of the rice HyPRP genes occurred in
pairs or clusters of closely adjacent loci (pairs on chromosomes 2 and 4, triplets on chromosomes 3, 4 and 10 and
a cluster of 9 genes on chromosome 10). This shows that
rapid and recent amplification of HyPRP genes is obviously not restricted to Arabidopsis (see Figure 3).

This hypothesis is also supported by analyses of the available expression data, which revealed no clear relationship
between expression patterns of orthologous Arabidopsis
and potato genes. In contrast, paralogous genes from the
Arabidopsis chromosomal clusters (especially 4a and 4b)
shared specialized expression patterns (Figure 2), which is
also consistent with their recent origin. Apparently, C-type
genes are predominantly transcribed in almost all analyzed organs in both Arabidopsis and potato, while expression of most of the remaining genes is limited to one or a
few organs.

Our subsequent phylogenetic study was based on a collection of 181 sequences (see Additional file 2). As in the
cases of potato and Arabidopsis, N-terminal domains of
HyPRPs from other species are also highly variable. A
multiple alignment of conserved C-terminal domains
(Figure 4, Additional file 3), which was used to calculate a
phylogenetic tree (Figure 3), revealed that only relatively
few amino acid residues are absolutely conserved (i.e.,
invariant among all sequences sampled). Surprisingly,
even one or two of the eight cysteines characteristic for the
8 CM domain have been replaced by other residues (usually tryptophan) in 16 HyPRPs; 10 of these were from
maize. These substitutions most frequently affected
cysteines 2 and 5 of the 8 CM motif (see Figure 4); however, nearly every one of the conserved cysteines was
replaced by another amino acid at least in one of the
sequences. Chemical properties of multiple amino acids
were conserved, although we could not identify any specific positions or regions within the domain that would be
unique or characteristic for proteins from statistically
well-supported major branches of the tree.

Phylogenetic analysis of aminoacid sequences of HyPRP
genes from seven plant species
The above-described analysis of the 16 potato and 28 Arabidopsis HyPRP genes revealed unexpected differences
between the two species. We therefore decided to compare
these results with data from two additional dicotyledonous species, barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) and
tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), another member of
Solanaceae family. We also carried out a comparison with

The overall topology of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) is
similar to that obtained for potato and Arabidopsis
sequences (Figure 2). Most notably, a clade containing all
C-type sequences of potato and Arabidopsis, together
with additional HyPRPs from all other species studied,
remains marginally statistically supported, at least in the
NJ tree. Since many C-type sequences also share the characteristic long N-terminal domains and expression patterns between potato and Arabidopsis, we believe that,

Phylogeny of plant HyPRPs
Phylogeny of plant HyPRPs. An unrooted phylogenetic tree, constructed by the NJ method using Treecon (see Materials
and Methods) from amino acid sequences of C-terminal domains of HyPRPs from seven plant species (At – Arabidopsis thaliana,
Le – Lycopersicum esculentum, Mt – Medicago truncatula, Os – Oryza sativa, Pt – Pinus taeda, St – Solanum tuberosum, Zm – Zea
mays). Arabidopsis loci are denoted by standard AGI locus identifiers, rice loci by a shortened version of the TIGR Rice genome
annotation identifiers (i.e. Os02g44310 stands for LOC_Os02g44310 etc.). Symbols at branches denote bootstrap values (out
of 500 replicates), red symbols denote branches which had bootstrap support over 50 % also in a ML tree from the same input
data. The NJ and ML trees agreed in all clades with bootstrap support over 50 % with exception of the ML tree (i) swapping
Pt2 and Pt13, (ii) clustering together Zm25 and Zm40, (iii) clustering together Mt11 an Mt5, (iv) clustering Zm 19 with the
Zm33/Zm45 pair, and (v) locating Os04g46830 into the cluster containing Zm47. Sequences are color-coded as in Figures 1
and 2: "Standard" proline-rich N-terminal domains are shown in black (long ones in bold), glycine-rich N-terminal domains in
green, proline- and glycine-rich N-terminal domains in blue, N-terminal domains shorter than 10 amino acid residues are in
red, truncated N-termini are denoted by an asterisk; chromosomal clusters and tandem duplications in Arabidopsis (squares)
and rice (circles) are marked to the right of the tree. Chromosomal clusters are numbered according to their chromosomal
positions (i.e. 10a and 10b means the two clusters on rice chromosome 10).

The conserved C-terminal 8 CM domains of selected plant HyPRPs. Top: multiple alignment of the conserved C-terminal domain sequences from representative HyPRPs of all major phylogenetic branches (see Figure 3). At – Arabidopsis thaliana, Le – Lycopersicon esculentum, Mt – Medicago truncatula, Os – Oryza sativa, Pt – Pinus taeda, St – Solanum tuberosum, Zm –
Zea mays. Residues conserved between at least 75 % of the depicted sequences are shown on black background, positions with
conserved amino acid properties on gray background. Conserved cysteines are shown in red and denoted by numbers,
selected substitutions at the conserved cysteine positions are highlighted in blue. Bottom: consensus sequence expressed as a
PROSITE – style pattern that detects most Arabidopsis HyPRPs and no false positives.

despite poor support in the ML analysis, this group may
be biologically relevant. Also, the bootstrap support for
the C-type clade dramatically improved (to over 70 % by
both NJ and ML methods) after removal of several outlier
sequences, indicating that these sequences were obviously
responsible for most of the uncertainty (see Additional
file 4).
Remarkably, only one HyPRP from Pinus taeda (Pt15)
clustered outside the C-type clade. Within this clade, a
branch containing nearly all remaining Pinus taeda
sequences (except Pt1), but no angiosperm sequences,
could be distinguished. The overall topology of the C-type
branch suggests a possible presence of two groups of putative orthologues of St1 and St2 genes. Both groups contain
sequences from all angiosperm species studied, although
only one of them (the St2 group) has significant bootstrap
support, at least in the NJ analysis.

To clarify the relationship of the relatively compact group
of C-type sequences to the rest of the HyPRP family, we
repeated the phylogenetic analysis on a representative
subset of sequences from nearly all major branches. This
included the Arabidopsis thaliana lipid transfer protein,
AtLTP2 (At2g38530, [GenBank: NP_181387]), as an outgroup for rooting the tree (Additional file 4). The root of
the resulting tree is located in the vicinity of the rice
sequence Os03g26800, within a poorly resolved cluster of
long branches outside the C-type group. This may indicate
that current C-type sequences resulted either from relatively late duplications of genes encoding HyPRPs with
long N-terminal domains, or from a strong selection pressure preventing diversification of these proteins. We prefer
the latter explanation because of the presence of both
angiosperm and gymnosperm HyPRPs within the C-type
clade. All sequences with long N-terminal extensions outside the C-type cluster are highly diverged. This results in
substantial erosion of the phylogenetic signal and their

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/412

position remains unclear. A massive increase of bootstrap
support for the C-type clade after omission of these
sequences (Additional file 4) suggests that they may even
be C-type HyPRPs outliers.
No statistically supported branches, including genes from
all angiosperm species, were found among the remaining
HyPRPs. However, several branches contain both rice and
maize sequences, but only one well-supported branch
harbors sequences from all dicotyledonous species (putative St10 orthologues). The majority of statistically supported branches outside C-type consist of related proteins
from either a single species, or two species from the same
family (either Solanaceae or Poaceae). While closely
related potato and tomato HyPRPs form predominantly
pairs of orthologues, the corresponding gene families in
maize and rice vary substantially.
All angiosperm C-type proteins possess long proline-rich
domains with high content of aliphatic amino acids, but
only Pt1 and Pt11 from Pinus taeda have N-terminal
domains of the same character. Remaining Pinus taeda
proteins clustering in the C-type branch are shorter and
rich in both proline and glycine together (formally classified as either glycine or proline-glycine rich in Figure 3).
N-terminal domains of proteins outside the C-type clade
are generally more variable. To our surprise, proteins with
either a very short, or no N-terminal domain at all and
proteins with a glycine-rich domain (instead of prolinerich one) do not form separate branches of the tree, but
are more or less randomly distributed.
Analysis of nucleotide sequences encoding the highly variable N-terminal domains of several HyPRPs provides an

insight into a possible mechanism of their diversification.
Translation of cDNA sequences encoding the glycine-rich
domains gives, in a reverse-reading frame, polypeptides
rich in proline as a result of partial complementarity of
codons for these two amino acids (Pro – CCX, Gly –
GGX). Interestingly, cDNA sequence of Le11 translated in
a reverse reading frame encodes an amino-acid motif (PC-P-P-P-P), which can be found in proline-rich domains
of some "classical" tomato HyPRPs (Figure 5). This suggests that sequences encoding the glycine-rich regions
might have arisen by inversion of the corresponding part
of the gene.

Discussion
Diversification of HyPRPs in seed plant evolution
Hybrid proline-rich proteins (HyPRPs) represent a group
of secreted cell wall proteins specific to seed plants. We
could find bona fide homologues of HyPRP genes only in
database sequences derived from angio- and gymnosperm
plants, while no representatives of this family were identified in non-seed plant species. In contrast, putative members of the lipid transfer protein (LTP) family, which share
the conserved 8 CM domain with HyPRPs, were found
even in a green alga (Chlamydomonas) and in the moss
Physcomitrella patens (LD and LF, unpublished). We thus
hypothesize that the first HyPRP gene may have been a
LTP derivative that acquired a sequence encoding prolinerich N-terminal domain either by means of gene fusion or
by introduction of an in-frame repetitive element. This
event may have represented one of the evolutionary innovations of seed plants. This view is consistent with the previously described high flexibility and adaptability of the
plant 8 CM domains (including LTPs and HyPRPs) to

Glycine-rich N-terminal domains may have arisen by coding sequence inversion
Glycine-rich N-terminal domains may have arisen by coding sequence inversion. An alignment of a part of the DNA
sequences encoding glycine-rich N-terminal domains of several angiosperm HyPRPs (constructed manually with the aid of
BioEdit) suggests a possible mechanism of independent acquisition of Gly-rich N-termini by inversion of a region encoding a
part of a conventional Pro-rich domain. Triplets encoding glycine (when read left to right) are shown in red letters, while those
encoding proline on the opposite strand are highlighted in gray (dark and bright shades used to distinguish individual triplets).
Nucleotides conserved in at least two thirds of the sequences are shown in bold and marked by dots, absolutely conserved
positions are marked by asterisks. Note the generally low degree of sequence conservation.

diverse functional requirements and sequence contexts
[2].
HyPRPs exhibit high sequence diversity due to extremely
variable N-terminal domains (see below) and, also, diversification of the C-terminal 8 CM domains. For instance,
the C-terminal domains of two most divergent HyPRPs
from potato (StHyPRP1 and StHyPRP14) share as little as
31 % of identical residues. Although frequent amino acid
substitutions within the 8 CM domain often preserve the
general properties of the residues at specific positions,
there is apparently little, if any, selection pressure on the
presence of a specific amino acid at a specific position.
This results in low overall sequence conservation. Surprisingly, several HyPRPs even lacked some of the conserved
eight cysteines characteristic for the 8 CM domain [2],
which is believed to be stabilized by disulphide bridges
formed between these cysteines [4]. However, it remains
unclear whether these proteins keep the conserved spatial
structure and the resulting functional characteristics of the
8 CM domain. Nevertheless, all these "mutant" HyPRPs
have been found based on cDNA sequences, indicating, at
least, their active transcription in vivo.
In spite of this variability, C-terminal domains are conserved enough to allow reliable alignment. This is a prerequisite for phylogenetic analysis (see Figure 4 and Figure
3), although the analysis is limited by the small domain
size (approximately 100 residues) and poor sequence
conservation. Comparison of all available HyPRPs
sequences from several plant species from phylogenetically distant groups of seed plants provides insight into
their evolutionary history. We have identified a specific
group of HyPRPs, referred to as C-type (conserved), that
contains both gymnosperm and angiosperm proteins.
These proteins often share some characteristics of their Nterminal domains, namely in terms of length and amino
acid composition. C-type HyPRPs exhibit less divergence
than the rest of the family, suggesting that their evolution
is more constrained by selection. This may be related to
the ubiquitous (housekeeping) expression pattern
observed at least in two dicot species. Diversification of
HyPRPs evidently followed different paths in gymnosperms and angiosperms. In angiosperms, the present-day
variability lies predominantly outside the C-type group,
while only limited gene duplications occurred among Ctype HyPRPs. However, the only gymnosperm species
analyzed (Pinus taeda) possesses a large family of C-type
proteins (the majority of them even without the long Nterminal domains), but only one HyPRP outside this
group.
Orthologues

distant
angiosperms (monocots and dicots) could be identified
only among C-type HyPRPs. The generally weak statistical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/412

support and presence of both long and very short
branches in the rest of the tree suggests an ongoing rapid
diversification. Moreover, weak selection pressure apparently resulted in the accumulation of mutational changes
preventing identification of ancient orthologues. The relatively recent origin of most of HyPRP diversity is also
suggested by the finding that significant branches outside
the C-type clade predominantly consist of multiple genes
from a single species or a single family (Solanaceae or
Poaceae).
HyPRP genes are found in clusters in both monocot (rice)
and dicot (Arabidopsis) genomes. They are often relatively
well conserved within the clusters in terms of sequence
and, in case of Arabidopsis, even conservation of expression patterns has been observed (Figure 2). However,
there is no clear relationship between genes multiplied in
rice and in Arabidopsis, indicating that the gene clusters
originated independently in the two species after their
divergence. Similar evolutionary behavior has been
described for the related LTP gene family, which also
exhibits significant diversity, although no substitutions of
the conserved cysteines were detected in these proteins
[19]. Interestingly, at least one additional gene family
containing proteins with repetitive N-terminal prolinerich domains, namely the formins (FH2 proteins), exhibits similar recent gene multiplication in Arabidopsis [20].
This raises the possibility that presence of repetitive
sequences containing the C-C-X nucleotide motif (i.e. the
proline codon) per se might make such genes prone to tandem duplication (although this is obviously not the only
cause, as documented by the evolutionary dynamics of
the LTPs).
Multiple origins of HyPRPs with atypical N-terminal
domains
BLAST searches for individual members of the HyPRP
family yielded not only proteins with proline-rich N-terminal domains, but also some proteins with N-terminal
domains rich in glycine (or proline and glycine). In addition, proteins consisting only of a C-terminal domain
attached directly to the signal sequence, as reported previously by José-Estanyol and colleagues [2], were also
found. Although the domain composition of the latter
resembles non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs; [21]),
the C-terminal domains of these proteins cluster reliably
together with the C-terminal domains of typical HyPRPs
in a combined phylogenetic tree constructed from potato
LTPs and C-terminal domains of HyPRPs (LD and LF,
unpublished results; see also Additional file 4).

We have attempted to map the considerable diversity of
the N-terminal domains onto the phylogenetic tree based
on the conserved 8 CM domain. Both N-terminal and Cterminal domains of C-type proteins appear to be rela-

tively less diversified, compared to the rest of the family.
All angiosperm C-type HyPRPs, as well as two Pinus taeda
proteins (Pt1 and Pt11), possess very long proline-rich
domains rich in hydrophobic and aliphatic amino acids.
This suggests that the ancestor of C-type proteins had long
proline-rich domains that subsequently became shorter
and were occasionally replaced by glycine-rich domains.
This trend is clearly visible in Pinus taeda, where Pt11 with
a long proline-rich domain is located at the base of the
cluster of proteins, which otherwise possess shorter N-terminal domains rich in both glycine and proline (Figure
3).
In angiosperms, most of the N-terminal domain variability was detected outside the C-type clade. Glycine-rich
proteins or proteins with no, or very short, N-terminal
domains are more or less randomly distributed across different branches of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). This is
in contrast to the previously published phylogeny of
HyPRPs, where proteins with no, or very short, N-terminal
domains were located in the central part of an unrooted
phylogenetic tree calculated from whole protein
sequences including the variable N-terminal domains [2].
In that study, proteins with long and short proline-rich
domains formed independent branches and glycine-rich
proteins defined a separate cluster within the short proline-rich domain branch. Based on these results, the
authors suggested a model of HyPRP evolution involving
repeat amplification or insertion of repetitive proline-rich
regions into an ancestral protein lacking an N-terminal
domain [2]. However, use of whole-sequence alignment
for tree construction may generate artifacts in cases
including significant amounts of deletions, insertions and
domain rearrangements. Single-domain phylogenies are
generally believed to be more reliable [22]. Based on our
C-terminal domain analysis, we can deduce that HyPRPs
with very short or no proline-rich domain (as well as
those with glycine-rich domains) may have diverged
rather recently from those with longer proline-rich
domains. Since these atypical HyPRP representatives
often share closely related C-terminal domains with typical HyPRPs, we believe that the loss of the proline-rich Nterminal domain or its replacement by a glycine-rich one
occurred both repeatedly and independently in ancestors
of different species. Thus, these "anomalous" N-terminal
domains appear to be of polyphyletic origin.
High variability of N-terminal domains may be associated
with their repetitive character, which is typically susceptible to rearrangements. Obvious duplication of a part of a
proline-rich domain was previously documented for two
putative orthologues from closely related species Solanum
brevidens and S. tuberosum [17]. Even glycine-rich domains
could, due to partial complementarity of codons for proline and glycine (Figure 5), have resulted from a rear-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/412

rangement (inversion) of a sequence encoding a prolinerich domain. Since repetitive glycine- and proline- or
hydroxyproline-rich proteins form the majority of cellwall proteinaceous mass [23], this finding might have a
more general evolutionary significance.
Variability of HyPRP expression patterns suggests
functional redundancy
For members of multigene families, analysis of gene
expression patterns often provides useful clues for determining gene function. However, we could find little obvious organ specificity in the expression of the whole HyPRP
gene family either in potato or in Arabidopsis. Notably,
Arabidopsis proteins with undisputable potato orthologs
(in particular those from the better-conserved C-type
clade) exhibited broader organ specificity than at least
some of their more divergent counterparts. This suggests
that "housekeeping" HyPRPs may be subjected to more
rigorous evolutionary constraints (see Figure 2). The
expression patterns of individual genes were complementary, overlapping or even identical (in case of several
recently amplified Arabidopsis genes). This suggests that
expression data for a single or a few HyPRP genes provide
little, if any, useful information on possible biological
role of these proteins. Unfortunately, so far, there are practically no other "functional" data concerning the HyPRP
family (reviewed in Introduction), so we can only speculate on possible functional differences on the basis of
HyPRP sequence analyses.

Simultaneous expression of genes encoding HyPRPs with
markedly different proline-rich domains might provide
multiple modes of interactions between these proteins
and the cell wall matrix. Lys-Pro motifs may interact with
acidic components of the cell wall, such as pectins [24].
Serine and threonine residues, which are often present in
sequences of proline-rich domains of HyPRPs, might
allow hydrogen bond formation via their hydroxyl
groups. Proline-rich domains rich in hydrophobic and
aliphatic amino acids might participate in formation of
hydrophobic interactions. Many HyPRP genes are
expressed in both growing and mature organs. This suggests a possible involvement not only in the primary cell
wall synthesis, but also in cell wall rearrangements in cells
of mature organs, where a wide spectrum of interactions
with other wall components might contribute to "fine
tuning" of cell wall modifications.
However, if the observed HyPRP variability resulted from
functional specialization for hypothetical interactions
with other cell wall components, one would expect a relatively strong selection pressure supporting sequence conservation. This, in turn, would lead to a more robust
phylogeny in respect to both the C-terminal domain tree
and the distribution of variant N-terminal domains. How-

ever, this is not the case – the only stable feature of our
phylogenetic tree is the presence of the apparently old
group of "housekeeping" C-type HyPRPs, containing representatives of all analyzed species. While the rest of the
family represents a diverse collection of highly variable
sequences, C-type HyPRPs are characterized by a higher
degree of sequence conservation, as well as presence of
long and relatively hydrophobic N-terminal domains in
all angiosperm and in two gymnosperm representatives.
Interestingly, while most of the diversification of
angiosperm HyPRPs (including evolution of variant, i.e.
non-proline-rich, N-terminal domains) occurred outside
the C-type clade, the opposite may have happened in
gymnosperms, at least as far as we can judge on the basis
of a single representative genome (the loblolly pine).
Sequence variability, similar to that observed for HyPRPs,
was documented also for the related family of LTPs, where
only the eight cysteines of the 8 CM motif were absolutely
conserved [19]. Using in vitro assays, only loose substratebinding specificity was found among different LTP family
members; LTPs analyzed in detail bound a wide spectrum
of lipidic ligands, from C10 to C18 [25,26]. Therefore, we
assume that, similar to the LTPs, high variability of both
C- and N- terminal domains of HyPRPs is rather a consequence of low selection pressure, possible functional
redundancy, limited degree of functional specialization
and high flexibility of the 8 CM domain.

Conclusion
Hybrid proline-rich proteins (HyPRPs) could be viewed as
a prototype of a dynamically evolving plant protein family constrained by rather limited structural requirements
without specific demands for e.g. enzyme activity. This is
consistent with the presumed role of these proteins as predominantly structural components of the plant cell walls.
We have performed a detailed analysis of the HyPRP gene
family, including both bioinformatic studies and experimental characterization of gene expression patterns, in
potato (Solanum tuberosum). The results were compared
with available data for the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and several other representatives of diverse lineages
of vascular plants, including two monocot species and a
representative gymnosperm. We have demonstrated that
the expression patterns of several genes encoding potato
HyPRPs do not correlate with those of their Arabidopsis
orthologues, pointing out the limits of extrapolation of
knowledge gained by experiments in model plants
towards target crop species.
Our bioinformatic study of data from seven plant species
revealed that HyPRPs exhibit extraordinary variability
with respect to both the sequence of their conserved 8 CM
domain and overall domain structure (in particular, the
length and composition of their N-terminal domains).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/412

However, we were able to reconstruct a possible evolutionary scenario that may have led to the current HyPRP
diversity. We suggest that ancestral HyPRPs evolved from
a lipid transfer protein (LTP) relative that had acquired a
proline-rich N-terminal domain. In angiosperms, HyPRPs
with long and relatively hydrophobic N-terminal
domains retained (or acquired) a housekeeping expression pattern and remained relatively well conserved. We
suggest terming this "conserved" clade "C-type HyPRPs".
In parallel, the rest of the angiosperm HyPRP gene family
has been undergoing continuous diversification by means
of gene duplications (including tandem duplications),
point mutations and rearrangements of the N-terminal
domain. This resulted in repeated generation of variant
(non-Pro-rich) HyPRPs with diverse expression patterns.
However, the evolutionary dynamics may have been different in the gymnosperms, where diversification took
place within the clade of C-type proteins. This raises the
interesting possibility that in each species, the co-existence of "dynamic" and "conserved" HyPRPs might provide an evolutionary advantage. It is tempting to speculate
that such a selective advantage might be related to the participation of HyPRPs in the construction of the interface
between the plant cell and its environment.

Methods
Database searches and protein sequence analyses
HyPRP encoding sequences (including genomic, cDNA,
unique transcript assemblies and unigenes) from seven
plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicum esculentum, Medicago truncatula, Pinus taeda, Oryza sativa, Solanum
tuberosum and Zea mays) were identified in public speciesspecific sequence databases: the SOL Genomics Network
[27,28] for tomato and potato; TAIR version 7 [29,30] for
Arabidopsis thaliana; TIGR rice assembly version 5 [31,32]
for rice; and the plant section of GenBank and PlantGDB
[33,34] for the remaining species. Searches were performed using either TBLASTN or BLASTP [35] with default
parameters and the C-terminal domain sequence of
SbrPRP from Solanum brevidens [GenBank: U30304.2]
[36] as a query. Sequences with E-values below 10-4,
which shared the general domain organization of HyPRPs
and which could be unambiguously aligned along the
whole C-terminal domain without gaps inside the conserved 8 CM domain core, were considered true positives.

Utilities from the Sequence Manipulation Suite [37] were
used for routine sequence handling. RADAR [38] at the
European Bioinformatic Institute server [39] has been
used for repeat detection and SignalP [40] for prediction
of signal peptides.
Expression profiles of the Arabidopsis genes, including
graphic representation, were obtained from the Genevestigator database [18,41].

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
The C-terminal (non-repetitive) parts of predicted HyPRP
protein sequences were aligned with the aid of ClustalX
[42]. Minor manual adjustments were performed in
BioEdit [43] in order to minimize the occurrence of short
blocks and gaps (introduced by the sequential alignment
algorithm). This also increased aligned amino acid similarity, as visually judged with the aid of a BLOSUM62derived color code and consensus shading. Non-aligned
N-ends were trimmed, leaving the master alignment presented in Figure 4 and Additional file 3. A consensus
HyPRP pattern was developed on the basis of this alignment and verified by MyHits pattern search of the Arabidopsis GenBank proteins at the MyHits website [44,45],
where it retrieved the majority of the previously known
HyPRP genes. For the closely mutually related Arabidopsis
and potato HyPRPs, where nearly identical amino acid
sequences provided relatively little phylogenetic signal,
portions of the cDNA sequence corresponding to the
aligned protein sequences have been retrieved with the
aid of the Sequence Manipulation Suite [37]. The alignment was then re-created manually with the aid of
BioEdit's translation toggle function, using the protein
sequences as a guide. The corresponding nucleotide
sequence alignment was used for further analyses.

Phylogenetic trees were calculated from protein alignments after removal of all portions of the alignment
where more than one sequence contained gaps longer
than one residue. For nucleotide alignments, all columns
containing gaps were excluded from further analysis. For
tree reconstruction on the basis of protein sequences, we
used either the neighbor-joining (NJ) method as implemented in the Treecon software [46] with at least 500
bootstrap samples, with Poisson correction for distance
calculation, or the heuristic approximation of the maximum likelihood (ML) method [47] provided by PHYML
[48] in combination with the Seqboot and Consense tools
from the PHYLIP package [49,50]. In ML analyses, the JTT
substitution model for amino acids or the HKY (default)
model for nucleotide substitutions was used. In all cases
involving either nucleotide sequences or maximum likelihood calculations, consensus NJ trees from 500 bootstrap
samples were computed for comparison using PHYLIP
(using the default substitution matrices, i.e. JTT for amino
acids and F84 for nucleotides).
Semiquantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated according to Stiekema and colleagues [51] from vegetative organs of potato cv. Désirée
plants grown under standard in vitro conditions (LS
medium [52], 16/8 light/dark cycle, 4 weeks). 2 μg of total
RNA were used for reverse transcription with oligo-T23
primer and RevertAid™ M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Fermentas), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/412

Two μl of the reverse transcription reaction were used as a
template for the subsequent PCR in a 50 μl reaction mixture containing 2.5 u of recombinant Taq DNA Polymerase (Fermentas), 1× PCR buffer with 20 mM (NH4)2SO4
(Fermentas), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 μM specific primers
designed to match the part of sequence encoding the Cterminal domain (Table 1), and 0.2 mM dNTPs. The PCR
was performed in a MJ Research PTC-200 cycler under the
following conditions: initial denaturation (3 min, 94°C),
followed by 23 cycles of denaturation (30 sec, 94°C),
annealing (45 sec, 60°C) and synthesis (20 sec 72°C). As
the internal standard, the transcript for the elongation factor ef1α [GenBank: AB061263] was used [53], with primers (EF1F: TAC TGC ACT GTG ATT GAT GCC; EF1R: A
GCA AAT CAT TTG CTT GAC ACC; in 5' – 3'direction)
newly designed to match the conserved regions of all three
potato isoforms of this gene [SGN: SGN-U277726, SGNU277730, SGN-U277731]. All samples, except those from
petioles (where the amount of material was limited), were
processed in parallel, starting from independent RNA isolation. As a rule, results appeared to be reproducible, both
between parallels and upon repetition of the PCR step. In
the rare cases, where some differences in the levels of the
HyPRP transcript between the two parallel samples were
observed, these were reproducible upon repeated PCR,
even when the internal standard signal appeared constant.
We believe that these differences between the two parallels were caused by variability of the starting plant material rather than by irregularities of the method (see also
Results). PCR products were separated on an agarose gel
in the presence of ethidium bromide and photographed
in transmitted UV light using an Olympus C-4040 digital
camera.
For visual comparison with the Arabidopsis data from the
Genevestigator database in Figure 2, potato RT-PCR
results were represented by a rectangular cutout from the
central portion of the corresponding bands, with colors
inverted using the appropriate Corel Photopaint command in order to achieve consistency with the color
scheme of the Genevestigator output.
