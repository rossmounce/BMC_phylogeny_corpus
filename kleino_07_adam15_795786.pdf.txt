Abstract
Background: ADAM15 is a metalloprotease-disintegrin implicated in ectodomain shedding and
cell adhesion. Aberrant ADAM15 expression has been associated with human cancer and other
disorders. We have previously shown that the alternative splicing of ADAM15 transcripts is misregulated in cancer cells. To gain a better understanding of ADAM15 regulation, its genomic
organization and regulatory elements as well as the alternative exon use in human tissues were
characterized.
Results: Human ADAM15, flanked by the FLJ32785/DCST1 and ephrin-A4 genes, spans 11.4 kb from
the translation initiation codon to the polyadenylation signal, being the shortest multiple-exon
ADAM gene. The gene contains 23 exons varying from 63 to 316 bp and 22 introns from 79 to 1283
bp. The gene appeared to have several transcription start sites and their location suggested the
promoter location within a CpG island proximal to the translation start. Reporter expression
experiments confirmed the location of functional GC-rich, TATAless and CAATless promoter,
with the most critical transcription-supporting elements located -266 to -23 bp relative to the
translation start. Normal human tissues showed different complex patterns of at least 13 different
ADAM15 splice variants arising from the alternative use of the cytosolic-encoding exons 19, 20a/b,
and 21a/b. The deduced ADAM15 protein isoforms have different combinations of cytosolic
regulatory protein interaction motifs.
Conclusion: Characterization of human ADAM15 gene and identification of elements involved in
the regulation of transcription and alternative splicing provide important clues for elucidation of
physiological and pathological roles of ADAM15. The present results also show that the alternative
exon use is a physiological post-transcriptional mechanism regulating ADAM15 expression in human
tissues.

Background
ADAM15 is a widely expressed member of the ADAM
(adisintegrin and metalloprotease) gene family encoding
transmembrane metalloproteinase-disintegrins [1]. The
characteristic domain structure of ADAM proteins consists

of N-terminal signal sequence and prodomain, which typically are proteolytically excised during biosynthetic maturation, followed by metalloproteinase, disintegrin, and
cysteine-rich domains, a transmembrane segment, and a
cytosolic tail. Despite the presence of the conserved metPage 1 of 20

alloproteinase domain, not all ADAMs are active proteinases; roughly half of the over 30 ADAM members do not
contain all catalytically critical residues. Human ADAM15
is an active metalloproteinase and can bind to several
integrins [2].
ADAMs have been implicated in numerous physiological
and pathological processes through their proteolytic or
adhesive activities, including ectodomain shedding and
cell-cell interactions [2-5]. ADAM15 has been implicated
in activation of growth factors through ectodomain shedding and in cell-cell interactions, but specific physiological roles are not known. ADAM15 gene knockout in mice
did not result in obvious developmental or pathological
phenotype [6,7]. However, strongly decreased angiogenesis in the retinopathy of prematurity model in adam15-/mice indicated a critical role in pathological neovascularization [6], corroborated by the studies implicating
ADAM15 in regulation of vasculogenesis [8-11].
Altered ADAM15 expression has been associated with
human diseases, including cancers, cardiac disease,
atherosclerosis, and arthritis [9,12-18]. In cancers,
ADAM15 has been implicated in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis [6,8,18]. In addition to the transcriptional regulation of ADAM15 expression, alternative
splicing of ADAM15 transcripts has been shown to be misregulated in human cancer cells [19]. Although ADAM15
splice-variants have been found from mouse and human
cell lines [19-22], no information has been available
about the alternative ADAM15 splicing in normal tissues.
To gain better understanding of ADAM15 regulation, the
present study provides a detailed structural and functional
characterization of human ADAM15 gene as well as its
expression and alternative exon use in normal human tissues.

Results
Human ADAM15 gene structure
PAC-clone 240C8 containing the human ADAM15 gene
was previously identified and shown to hybridize with a
single chromosomal locus at 1q21.3 [23]. Sequencing verified that 240C8 includes the entire ADAM15 gene (Fig.
1A). The annotated gene sequence was submitted to GenBank [GenBank: AF314227].

ADAM15 gene is flanked by the FLJ32785/DCST1 and
ephrin-A4 (EFNA4) genes. FLJ32785 (NCBI Entrez GeneID
149095) polyadenylation signal is located 477 bp
upstream from ADAM15 translation start codon, and
ephrin-A4 (GeneID 1945) translation start 1069 bp downstream from ADAM15 polyadenylation signal. In this
report, if not mentioned otherwise, the nucleotide num-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/90

bering is relative to the adenine of the ADAM15 translation start codon.
Human ADAM15 gene spans 11367 bp from the translation start to the polyadenylation signal, contains 23 exons
varying from 63 to 316 bp, and 22 introns varying from
79 to 1283 bp. (Fig. 1A). ADAM15 is the shortest multiple-exon ADAM gene (comparison data not shown). The
exons 19–21 are used alternatively in human tissues (Fig.
1A).
All ADAM15 introns conform the GT-AG splicing rule
(Additional file 1). While the ADAM15 introns in general
contain good putative branch sites, the branch sites in the
introns 3, 6, 10, and 19 scored lower than average branch
sites in the human genome. Although the Branch-Site
Anlyzer failed to predict the branch site for intron 1, a
good consensus sequence was found at appropriate location. The putative branch site sequences are shown in
Additional file 1.
The intron/exon structure of the human, mouse, and rat
ADAM15 genes is almost identical. The human exon 2,
the mouse exon 6, and the rat exon 20 show an internal 3
bp deletion respective to the others. Another difference is
that the 3'-splice site (3'ss) of the human intron 6 is
located three nucleotides downstream from that of the
rodent genes, causing the human exon 7 to be 3 bp
shorter. The ag corresponding to the 3'ss of the rodent
intron 6 is also present in the human sequence (Additional file 1) and hence the human intron 6 acceptor contains a tagtag-sequence constituting a candidate NAGNAG
tandem acceptor [24] which could enable 3 bp variation
at the exon start. Use of the proximal acceptor would lead
to an inframe stop codon (TAG) at the exon 7 start. However, transcripts with the exon 7 stop form have not been
detected.
The exons 20 and 21 have alternative 5'- or 3'-ends,
respectively (Additional file 1). The exon 20 forms, the
shorter referred as 20a and the longer as 20b, are a consequence of a NAGNAG tandem acceptor (Additional file
1). The alternative exon 21 forms share the 5' splice site
(5'ss) and the longer referred as 21b has a 3' splice site
(3'ss) 142 bp further downstream from that of 21a (Additional file 1).
The ADAM15 gene contains four separate CpG-islands.
The longest CpG-island extends from the last FLJ32785
intron to the first ADAM15 intron (Fig. 1C). Two shorter
islands are located within ADAM15 intron 1, and the
fourth island encompass region from ADAM15 exon 22
past the polyadenylation site (Fig. 1C).

Figure ADAM15 gene structure, phylogenetic footprinting, promoter and transcription start site analysis
Human 1
Human ADAM15 gene structure, phylogenetic footprinting, promoter and transcription start site analysis. The panels (A), (B),
(C), and the left part of the panel (D) are in register respective to the nucleotide numbering shown under the panel (C). The
symbol key for the panels (A) – (C) is shown at bottom right. (A) ADAM15 exon-intron structure is depicted with black and
grey boxes representing the constitutively and alternatively used exons, respectively. Exon numbering is indicated under the
boxes. The alternative exon 20a/b and 21a/b 5'- and 3'-ends are indicated with pale grey. The green boxes represent the last
two exons (exons 15 and 16) of the upstream gene FLJ32785. The spaces separating the exons are proportional to the intron
lengths. The solid lines connecting the ADAM15 exons represent the most frequently observed splice pattern corresponding to
the ADAM15 mRNA variant 2. The dashed lines connecting the exons 18–22 represent the alternative splicing producing the
ADAM15 variant with the longest open reading frame (variant 6). The dashed line between the FLJ32785 exon 16 and the
ADAM15 exon 2 depicts the observed fusion splicing between the two genes. The panel (B) shows the repetitive element locations. Conservation of repetitive elements between human and mouse is indicated by the letter c. (C) The upper part shows
the sequence-similarity between the mouse and human genes, indicated by the identity percentage on the vertical axis; the
mVista sequence-identity plot is shown with pink shading in the intronic regions and with blue or green shading in the exonic
regions. The PiP-maker identity blocks are shown with black horizontal lines. CpG islands are indicated with white and grey
boxes (see the symbol key). The lower part of the panel C shows the locations of predicted transcription factor binding
sequences with the relative strength of prediction on the vertical axis; the Match-program was used to predict the conventional binding motifs (solid orange squares) and the Consite for phylogenetically conserved binding motifs (open circles); predictions with scores ranging from 0.90 to 1.00 are shown for Match and from 5 to 15 for Consite. The location relative to the
ADAM15 translation start ATG is indicated by the nucleotide numbering under the panel. (D) ADAM15 promoter analysis with
luciferase-reporter expression. The left side of the panel D shows the ADAM15 upstream regions examined in the luciferase
reporter experiments. The light blue shading indicates the conserved regions outside of the repetitive elements. The nucleotide location relative to ADAM15 translation start ATG, in register with the panel (C), is shown under the panel. The right
side of the panel (D) shows the relative promoter activity of the reporter constructs in comparison to the pGL2-Basic control
plasmid and to the SV40 promoter. The black and grey bars indicate the promoter activity measured in SK-BR-3 and HCC1954 cells, respectively. (E) The transcription start site analysis using RT-PCR described in the Materials and Methods. The
position of the upstream primer relative to ADAM15 translation start ATG in each PCR is indicated under the electrophoresis
lanes. The upper gel shows the products of 30 PCR cycles and the lower gel those of 35 PCR-cycles.

Human ADAM15 gene contains several transcription start
sites and a TATAless promoter
Evidence for several transcription start sites
5'RACE experiments indicated the presence of several 5'ends upstream of ADAM15 exon 2, differing in length and
sequence (data not shown). However, an impractical

number of 5'RACE products would have had to be cloned
and sequenced for unambiguous results, due to alternative sequence in similar-sized 5'-ends. For the same reason, primer extension from exon 2 would have produced
equivocal results. Therefore the PCR approach described

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:90

in the Methods was used to analyse the 5' end of ADAM15
transcripts.
The gradual decrease of product levels in consecutive
PCRs of 5'-UTR indicated that human ADAM15 transcription starts at several sites at different levels (Fig. 1E). While
most ADAM15 transcriptions started at around 110 bp
upstream from the translation start, transcripts starting
from up to -159 bp were detected with 30 PCR cycles (Fig.
1E).
The 5'RACE results also indicated fusion transcription,
joining the upstream-neighbour FLJ32785 and ADAM15.
This was confirmed using the PCR approach. Transcripts
were amplified with a common downstream primer at
ADAM15 exon 2 and various upstream primers at
FLJ32785 exons 15 and 10. This indicated that fusion
transcripts start at least within FLJ32785 exon 10, possibly
containing FLJ32785 fused to ADAM15. However, the
fusion transcripts were detected only after 35 PCR cycles,
indicating their scarcity in the studied cells (Fig. 1E).
5'RACE product and GenBank EST sequences indicate that
both GTs flanking the FLJ32785 polyadenylation signal
were used as donors in splicing to ADAM15 exon 2 (Fig.
2).
The upstream primers at the FLJ32785 intron 15 failed to
amplify PCR-products, suggesting that the intron 15 is
excluded normally from fusion transcripts. ADAM15 transcripts with FLJ32785 intron 15 sequence at 5' end were
not detected, indicating that no alternative ADAM15 transcription start sites are present in the FLJ32785 intron 15.
Hence, the transcripts encoding ADAM15 protein start at
-159 through -110 region. Given this and the location
within a CpG island, this region was examined for promoter activity.
ADAM15 promoter induced expression in luciferase reporter assay
Reporter expression analysis confirmed that the candidate
promoter region contained a functional promoter. The
region -266 through -23 increased the reporter activity to
1.2- and 1.9-fold in SK-BR-3 and HCC-1954 cells, respectively, as compared to the control SV40-promoter (Fig.
1D).

Deletion of the nucleotides -171 to -122 resulted in the
reduction of the promoter activity to a third of the original
(Fig. 1D). This weakened mutant promoter lacked five of
the six Sp1 recognition motifs and the Pax-4 site, containing only an En-1, a HoxA3, and a composite Sp1/MyoD
recognition motif (Fig. 2).
The upstream segment -415 to -267 showed a weak
repressive effect, since its addition to the -266 through -23
construct reduced the promoter activity (Fig. 1D). How-

ever, the corresponding sequence is largely absent from
the mouse and rat adam15 genes (Fig. 2), and the only
high score vertebrate transcription factor (TF) binding
motif within this region is for HOXA3 (Fig. 2). While the
reporter construct extension to the base pair 1178 did not
alter the reduced promoting efficiency, the further extension to 1582 restored the reported expression to the original level (Fig. 1D). This suggests positive regulatory
activity for the region 1582 to 1179. Extension of the
reporter construct beyond 3000 did not significantly
affect the promoter activity. The effect of the FLJ32785
intron 15 to ADAM15 promoter activity was minimal at
most, consistent with the lack of conservation in the
region. Altogether, the most critical ADAM15 transcription-supporting elements are located within the region
266 to 23.
Transcription factor binding motifs in the core promoter
The several transcription start sites 159 to 110 bp
upstream from ADAM15 translation start indicated the
location of a core promoter (Fig. 1C). The presence of several conserved TF recognition motifs in the region is consistent with the transcription start sites corroborating the
core promoter location. The promoter region showed
some conservation in automated sequence alignment
(Fig. 1C). However, manual optimization increased the
conservation significantly (Fig. 2).

The high-score vertebrate TF binding motifs found in
human ADAM15 promoter sequence and in the corresponding mouse and rat sequences are shown in Figure 2.
The putative adam15 promoter lacks the TATA and CAAT
boxes also in rodents, and contains conserved binding
sequences for five Sp1/GC-box recognition sites in all
three species. In addition, the human sequence contains a
sixth Sp1 motif, a Pax-4 motif, and a composite Sp1/
MyoD element. The human and rat genes contain a binding sequence for Engrailed 1 (En-1) at a separate but close
location upstream of the Sp1/GC boxes. The nearby
upstream region contains also a HOXA3 binding
sequence in human and an Aml-1 and C/EBP binding
sequences in mouse (Fig. 2).
Potential regulatory regions outside the core promoter
The human, mouse, and rat ADAM15 genes were subjected to phylogenetic footprinting in order to localize
potential cis-regulatory elements outside the core promoter. Sequence conservation analysis (Fig. 1C, upper
panel, and data not shown) was complemented with a
search for clusters of conserved TF recognition motifs,
which would indicate locations of potential extra-core
promoter regulatory elements (Fig. 1C, lower panel).

In all three species, the FLJ32785 intron 15 consists
mostly of repetitive sequence with only short conserved

Comparative transcription factor binding site analysis of ADAM15 promoter
Figure 2
Comparative transcription factor binding site analysis of ADAM15 promoter. The human ADAM15 promoter and the first exon
nucleotide sequences were aligned with corresponding mouse and rat sequences (hsA15, mmA15, and rnA15, respectively).
The numbering above the sequences indicates position respective to the adenine in the translation start codon. The amino acid
translation is shown for the first exon of human ADAM15. The predicted high-score transcription factor recognition motifs are
indicated above the sequence (solid line, human; dotted line, mouse; dashed line, rat). The three conserved 22 bp repeated elements, the translation start ATG, and the polyadenylation signal of the upstream gene FLJ32785 are boxed. The boxed GTs
indicate the detected splice donor sites in the last FLJ32785 exon used in splicing of human FLJ32785 to ADAM15. The thick
line below the aligned sequences indicates the region containing the detected transcription start sites of the human ADAM15
gene.

elements lacking TF binding motif clusters in between
(Fig. 1B, C). Consistently, reporter experiments showed
that FLJ32785 intron 15 does not contain strong ADAM15
promoter activity-regulating elements.
The most prominent conserved non-coding ADAM15
regions were found in introns 1 and 2. Intron 1 region
3684 to 4228 and intron 2 region 4803 to 5244 are conserved across all three species and contain several conserved TF recognition motifs which are more tightly
clustered in the intron 2 region (Fig. 1C). The conserved
regions do not contain long open reading frames nor were
corresponding transcribed sequences found from the
GenBank, suggesting that the intronic conservation is not
due to transcription of another gene.
Also the introns flanking the alternatively used exons contain obvious conserved regions. The low number of
Match- and Consite-predicted TF binding sites suggests
other potential role for these sequences from transcription
regulation of ADAM15 or the downstream EFNA4. These
regions might be conserved due their possible role in
ADAM15 splicing or in the regulation of alternative splicing. Conservation in the introns flanking alternatively
used exons has been reported also for other genes [25].
The human and mouse introns 3, 6, 10, 15, and 16 contain repetitive elements at corresponding locations, but
only four of these 20 elements show conservation also in
the type and sequence (Fig. 1B, mouse repeats not
shown). Sine or Mir repetitive elements were not detected
in the introns with long conserved regions or introns containing CpG-islands, as if their insertion would not have
been tolerated.
Three ADAM15 exons are used differentially in human
tissues
In addition to the previously reported human ADAM15
transcripts, nine novel mRNA variants were identified
after the cloning and sequencing of over 100 reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) products. The variants result
from alternative use of the exons 19, 20, and 21 (Additional file 1, Figs. 1A, 3, 4). Two of these exons are alternatively spliced at one end, giving rise to the exon variants
20a/20b and 21a/21b (Figs. 1 and 4, Additional file 1).
The exons 1–18, 22, and 23 were found in all examined
ADAM15 transcripts, indicating that they are constitutively used. The variant 9 (Fig. 3) was not confirmed by
sequencing but was indicated by the consistent appearance of the predicted size fluorescence PCR (fPCR) product and by RT-PCR amplification with a primer specific for
the exon-exon junction 18/21 (data not shown). The
sequences were submitted to GenBank [GenBank:
AF314227, GenBank: AY560593–560601, GenBank:
560617].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/90

ADAM15 mRNA variant profile in human tissues
Tissue distribution of ADAM15 mRNA variants was examined with fPCR of a cDNA panel representing 16 human
tissues. Tissues showed distinctive ADAM15 variant patterns with 9 to 13 different variants at various levels (Fig.
3B). The average relative ADAM15 variant levels varied
from less than 1% (variants 3b, 7a/b, 8) to 59% of the variant 2 (Fig. 3). Placenta showed the simplest and spleen
and peripheral leukocytes the most complex ADAM15
variant profiles (Fig. 3B).

The exon 20a/20b usage ratio in human tissues, calculated
from variants 6a/b, was on average 0.58 varying from 0.22
in skeletal muscle to 1.10 in spleen. This indicated nonconstant ratio use for acceptors and that neither of the
acceptor sites in the intron 19 NAGNAG was exclusively
used in any examined tissue.
The ADAM15 mRNA levels in human tissues were investigated using two methods: by summing-up the mRNA variant levels determined in fPCR experiments and by the
real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification of a fragment within the constantly expressed ectodomain-coding
region. The tissue expression results paralleled each other
(Pearson coefficient 0.902), corroborating the reliability
of the ADAM15 mRNA variant profiling assay and indicating that the amplified fPCR fragments are parts of fulllength ADAM15 transcripts. This also suggests that, in
addition to the comparability of individual ADAM15 variant levels within given tissue, the variant levels could be
comparable also between different tissues. An exception
to this is the testicular expression for which no reliable
housekeeping marker gene was available for normalization [26].
Alternative splice-regulatory elements in the ADAM15
gene
Conservation of the alternative use of the ADAM15 exons
19 to 21 in man and mouse motivated the comparative
examination of the human, mouse, and rat ADAM15 gene
sequences for the identification of the sequence elements
associated with the regulation of alternative splicing.
Splice and branch sites in the alternative introns
Roughly half of the information for splicing has been estimated to reside in splice and branch site sequences
[27,28]. The 5'ss sequences in the introns 18 (AGgtatga),
20 (AGgtaaat), and 21a (AGgtaacg) deviate from the consensus donor sequence (AGgtragt) at +4/+6, +5, and +5
positions, respectively. Also, the calculated binding energies of U1 snRNA base-pairing with these 5'ss (-4.90, 6.20, and -5.10 kcal/mol introns 18, 20, and 21, respectively) are weaker than in average human 5'ss (-6.53 kcal/
mol). However, all the 5'ss-scores in the introns flanking
the alternative exons are in normal range (data not

The alternative ADAM15 exon use in human tissues. (A) Schematic representation of the identified human ADAM15 mRNA
variants. For clarity, only the cytosolic-encoding region containing the alternatively used exons is shown. The solid connecting
lines indicate splicing of the constitutive exons and the dashed connecting lines indicated splicing of the alternatively used
exons. The exons are shown as black boxes, with gray shading indicating the alternative 5'- and 3'-ends of the a/b variants of
the exons 20 and 21, respectively. (B) ADAM15 mRNA variant profiles in normal human tissues, detected with fluorescencePCR/capillary electrophoresis. The relative abundance of the mRNA variants (columns) within given tissue (rows) is indicated
with the color coding. Black indicates relative abundance below 0.2% and colors from blue through yellow to bright red show
the relative abundances from 0.2 to 88% (see the color key bar). The bottom row shows the average of the relative abundances in all examined tissues. (C) Real-time PCR (LightCycler) quantitation (solid bars) of ADAM15 expression level and that
defined with fPCR/capillary electrophoresis as the combined peak area of all detected ADAM15 cDNA variants within given
samples (open bars). The vertical axis shows the TBP-normalized expression levels relative to thymus (the lowest tissue
expression, value set to 1.0). The similarity of the tissue distribution (Pearson correlation 0.902) determined with the two
methods indicates that significant amounts of possible additional mRNA variants were not missed with the fPCR/capillary electrophoresis detection.

Splice-regulatory motifs in the alternatively spliced ADAM15 region
Splice-regulatory motifs in the alternatively spliced ADAM15 region. Predicted alternative splicing-regulatory protein recognition motifs within and flanking the alternatively used ADAM15 exons. The exon-intron structure of the human alternatively
spliced ADAM15 region is shown at the top. The exons are shown as black boxes. The exon 21b-unique 3'-region is indicated
with grey. The open boxes indicate the location of the putative cryptic exons eC-19 and -20. The dashed lines indicate the possible splicings of the alternatively used exons 19–21 and solid lines indicate the constitutive splicing. For simplicity, the lines do
not depict the alternative use of exon-20 5'-splice sites (differing by only three nucleotides). The alternative splicing-associated
sequence motifs are indicated by the symbols explained in the key shown below the figure. The different motif classes are
shown separately in the sectors indicated on the right and explained in the key. The locations of putative branch sites are indicated with the small arrows on top of the pyrimidine tracts (green bars) under the splice-regulatory motif sectors. The humanmouse sequence-conservation is visualised with mVista and PiP/BlastZ under the splice-regulatory motif panel. For easier distinction, the exonic regions are shaded in the splice-regulatory motif and sequence identity panels. Also the nucleotide numbering relative to the translation start is shown under the panels

shown). Intron 18 3'ss (tcatgcatagGGCAG) ASD-workbench score (3.62) and intron 19 branch site score (2.65)
are low while the other 3'ss scores (7.08–9.18) and
branch/pyrimidine tract scores (3.35–3.85) in the alternatively used introns are normal.
The second half of the information for splicing regulation
is located outside of the splice and branch sites, in the
exon and intron sequences. Figure 4 shows the distribution of the potential splice-regulatory factor target motifs
in the alternatively spliced region of human ADAM15
gene.
Exonic splice enhancer and silencer (ESE, ESS) sequences in
alternatively used ADAM15 exons
Constitutive human exons typically contain three to seven
Rescue-ESE clusters (average 5.2) [27]. The alternatively
used human ADAM15 exons 19, 20a/b and 21a contain
one/zero, one/zero, and three/six ESEs/putative exonic
splice enhancers (PESE) found with the Rescue-ESE [27]/
PESX [29] predictions, respectively. All ESEs and PESEs in
exon 21a are in two clusters (Fig. 4). The number of ESEfinder-predicted SR-protein binding motifs in the alternative ADAM15 exons is one third lower than the average in
the constitutive ADAM15 exons (data not shown). Furthermore, only three SR-protein binding motifs were
localized to alternative exons (Fig. 4). Hence, the alternative ADAM15 exon splicing might be less enhanced by
ESEs than the constitutive exons.

The alternative ADAM15 exons 19, 20a/b, and 21a lack
ESSs/PESSs and binding motifs for heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) altogether and contain
lower than average number of exonic splice-regulatory
sequences (ESRs). While 12.9 ESRs were localized to
ADAM15 exons on average, the alternatively used exons
19, 20a/b, and 21a contain seven, eight, and two ESRs,
respectively. Despite the low usage in ADAM15 transcripts, the unique 3' part of the exon 21b contains several
ESE, PESE, ESS, and ESR motifs as well as SR-protein and
hnRNP binding motifs (Fig. 4).
ESE and ESS sequences in two cryptic ADAM15 exons
The GenBank EST sequences indicate locations for two
rarely used cryptic exons within introns 19 and 20,
referred to as eC-19 and eC-20 (for cryptic exon) (Fig. 4).
Both cryptic exons contain several exonic splicing
enhancer and silencer motifs (ESEs/PESEs and ESSs/
PESSs). Transcripts containing these exons were not
detected with exon specific primers in RT-PCR or fPCR,
suggesting that they are not functional exons.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/90

ESSs, ESEs, hnRNP and SR-protein target motifs, and introninc splice
enhancers (ISE) in the alternative ADAM15 introns
In contrast to the alternative exons, the introns flanking
them were rich in ESEs and ESSs as well as in hnRNP and
SR-protein binding motifs (Fig. 4). The intron 19 contains
several hnRNP H/F binding motifs and the intron 20 especially many conserved SRp20, SRp30b, SRp40, hnRNP F/
H, and hnRNP B/D/E binding motifs. Conserved hnRNP
H/F binding motifs are present near the intron 21a ends.
Furthermore, several G- and C-rich ISEs were scattered
throughout the alternative introns. The number of the Gand C-rich ISEs parallel the high guanine and or cytosine
content, respectively, in the introns 18–21.
Alternative splice regulation-associated motifs in the alternatively
spliced ADAM15 region
The four most significantly alternative splicing-associated
upstream sequence motifs (AUGCAU, CUGCUA,
GCAUGC, and UGCAUG) predicted in Brudno et al. [30]
were found in ADAM15 alternative introns (Fig. 4). Of the
predicted motifs, GCAUGC and UGCAUG contain a recognition sequence (GCAUG) for Fox-family alternative
splicing regulator proteins [31]. The intron 18 contains an
AUGCAU and CUGCUA motifs close to the 3'- and 5'ss,
respectively. 2/2, 2/2, and 0/1 GCAUGC/UGCAUG motifs
are in central location in the introns 19, 20, and 21,
respectively. In addition to the human ADAM15, six of the
eleven corresponding motifs are present also in at least
either one of the rodents.

Binding motifs for the neuronal splice-enhancer Nova-1/
2 were located in the introns 18, 19, and 20 (four, one,
and four, respectively). Five out of nine Nova-binding
motifs were found in the corresponding location also in
both rodents (Fig. 4). The exon 19 contains one and the
intron 19 three binding motifs for the CELF/BrunoL family proteins. Corresponding intronic motifs were found
also from mouse and/or rat. Muscleblind-like protein 1
(MBNL1) binding motifs were found in the exon 20 and
in the introns 20 and 21. The exonic MBNL1 binding
sequence is conserved in human, rat and mouse. Exon
skipping-associated C-rich or G-rich motifs [32] were
located in the introns 18, 19, and 21 (Fig. 4). The intron
18 G-rich motif is present also in both rodents and the
first motif in the intron 21 is present also in mouse. Altogether 62% of the alternative splicing associated elements
in the human ADAM15 exon 18 to intron 21 region were
found also at the corresponding positions in mouse or rat,
34% being present in all three species.
Deduced cytosolic ADAM15 isoform tails contain different
sets of potential SH3-interaction motifs

only at their cytosolic-encoding region. Variants encoding

isoforms without the transmembrane part were not
detected. Depending on the presence of the first alternative exon 19, ADAM15 mRNA variants are translated
along either of the two alternative reading frames in the
cytosolic-encoding region, downstream of exon 18 (Fig. 5,
Additional file 1).
The variants 2, 4a/b, 5, 6a/b, 7a/b, and 8 with exon 19
(Fig. 3A) are translated along the first reading frame after
exon 19 (Fig. 5). Since the first reading frame is open and
the lengths of the alternative exons 20a, 20b, or 21a (72
nt, 75 nt, and 72 nt, respectively) are divisible by three,
their inclusion does not change the reading frame and
their alternative use changes the ADAM15 cytosolic tail in
modular fashion. Therefore the deduced protein isoforms
either contain or lack the segments encoded by these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/90

exons while the carboxyl end is invariable. The first reading frame contains an inframe stop codon in the exon 21b
and thus the ADAM15 variants 7a/b and 8 (Fig. 3B)
encode truncated tail isoforms (Fig. 5). The variants with
the exon 19, translated along the first reading frame, contain up to seven PxxP-type Src-homology-3 (SH3)-binding motifs in five separate proline clusters in their
cytosolic tails (Fig. 5). The proline clusters are encoded by
the exons 19, 20a/b, 21a and the 22/23 junction (Fig. 5).
The ADAM15 variants lacking the exon 19 (1, 3a/b, and 9)
are translated along the second reading frame downstream of the exon 18. Along this frame, exons 20a/b (variants 3a/b, Fig. 3B) encode also a proline cluster with SH3binding motif (Fig. 5); ADAM15 isoforms (3a/b) containing this motif appear to show different SH3 protein inter-

translations are shown separated by a slash. The transmembrane sequence is boxed. The putative SH3 domain-binding motifs

actions from those of isoforms translated along the first
reading frame (our unpublished results). The variants 1
and 9 do not encode known SH3 interaction motifs.
The ADAM15 variants 7a/b, 8, and 9 are predisposed to
nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway since
they contain an inframe stop codon further than 55 nt
upstream of exon-exon junctions 21b-22 and/or 22–23.
This suggests that proteins encoded by these ADAM15 variants would not likely be produced at high level, consistent with their low mRNA levels (Fig. 3). The variants 1, 3a,
and 3b contain an inframe stop codon at exon 22 only 16
nucleotides upstream of the last exon-exon junction and
are thus not likely to be targeted to NMD.
ADAM15 comprises a subgroup with ADAMs 8, 9, 12, 19,
and 28
The ADAM15 exon-intron organization and protein
sequence were compared to other human and mouse
ADAMs and nematode ADAM14. Based on genomic and
protein sequence similarities, ADAMs fell into 13 subfamilies. The ADAM exon-intron structures and a phylogenetic tree depicting the amino acid sequence similarities
of the deduced ADAM proteins are shown in Figure 6.

The overall ADAM15 exon-intron structure is most similar
to ADAMs 8, 9, 12, 19, and 28. The intron/exon structure
of the extracellular (ectodomain) and transmembrane
encoding regions in ADAM15 is highly similar to that in
12 ADAM gene family members (Fig. 6A). In contrast to
the ectodomain, the structure of cytosolic-encoding gene
region varies greatly between different ADAMs, and only
five ADAMs show intron phases and locations partially
conserved with ADAM15 in cytosolic-encoding region.
The ADAMs 8, 9, 12, 19, and 28 share 3, 3, 4, 3, and 3
introns with conserved phase and location, respectively.
Also at the protein sequence level, ADAM15 is most similar to ADAMs 8, 12, 13, 19, and 28. ADAM9 shows similarity with ADAM15 at cytosolic tail sequence (data not
shown) as well as in the gene structure encoding it.
ADAM15 differs from other ADAM genes by three notable
features. First, human and mouse ADAM15 lack an intron
present in almost all other multiple-exon ADAM-genes
(intron 14 of other ADAMs, Fig 6A). Another difference is
the absence of a part of the exon 17 (Fig. 6A) which
encodes a conserved membrane-proximal ADAM-specific
protein motif, present in the majority of ADAMs from C.
elegans to humans. This exon segment is absent also from
ADAMs -7, -8, -28, -10, and -17. Third, ADAM15 is the
only ADAM, in addition to ADAM22 [33], with conserved
alternative splicing in cytosolic-encoding exons. In other
ADAMs alternative use of cytosolic-encoding exons is
restricted to either mouse or man (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
This report describes characterization of the human
ADAM15 gene and promoter, comparative analysis of
potential transcriptional and alternative splicing-regulatory elements in human and rodent ADAM15 genes, and
the first demonstration of complex differential alternative
ADAM15 splicing in human tissues.
ADAM15, or its chromosomal neighborhood, appears to
have been under selection pressure towards shorter
length. ADAM15 gene is one third of the average human
gene length [34,35] and the shortest of multiple-exon
ADAM genes (some ADAM genes contain only one uninterrupted open reading frame). Although the number of
ADAM15 exons is two and half times the human average
and the exons are of normal size, the average ADAM15
intron length is less than one tenth of the human average
[36]. The length of some ADAM15 introns is close to the
theoretical minimum [37]. Moreover, ADAM15 appears
to have lost an intron which is present in other ADAM
genes.
The present results indicate several transcription start sites
for human ADAM15, in contrast to the single start site
reported for the mouse gene [20]. Their location suggested
the promoter position within a CpG island proximal to
the translation start, which was confirmed by the reporter
expression experiments. The wide tissue distribution of
ADAM15 expression is consistent with the CpG-rich promoter type [38]. Consistent with the presence of multiple
transcription starts, the promoter lacks CAAT and TATA
boxes, and contains a cluster of conserved Sp1/GC-box
motifs.
While significant extra-promoter transcriptional regulatory elements were not found upstream of the ADAM15
promoter, the introns 1 and 2 contain highly conserved
regions with clusters of conserved regulatory motifs. These
could contribute to the transcriptional regulation since
genomic sequence conservation is considered to indicate
purifying selection and thus functional importance
[39,40]. Alternatively, these regions could play a role in
the splicing of the exons 2 or 3. Since the intronic spliceregulatory elements typically lie within 200 bp from
exons [41], the central location of the conserved region in
the intron 1 argues against a role in splicing whereas the
conserved intron 2 region adjacent to exon 3 could be
associated with its splicing. A third alternative explanation, that these regions were regulatory or coding parts of
a gene in the complementary strand, is unlikely since no
evidence was found for a complementary gene. The possible role of these conserved regions remains elusive.
The expression of ADAM15 appears to be remarkably regulated at the post-transcriptional level. For the first time,

the present results demonstrate that normal human tissues display different complex patterns of at least 13
ADAM15 variants. Yamamoto and coworkers have earlier
demonstrated the presence of ADAM15 mRNA variants
corresponding to human v5 and v6 in mouse cell lines
and some tissues [20,21]. The shortest ADAM15 variant
(v1) has also been reported from cultured human cells
[22]. Here, the fPCR method enabled identification of several novel variants as well as more precise and quantitative
examination of the variant profiles. Otherwise the studies
so far have considered the ADAM15 variant 2 as "the"
ADAM15 and potential contribution of other variants has
not been addressed.
All permutations of the alternative ADAM15 exons were
not detected, suggesting that certain exon combinations
are not generated or that they are unstable. The low levels
of some variants might at least partially be due to their
potential susceptibility to NMD, since their translation
stop codon is located further than 55 nt upstream from an
exon-exon junction [42]. Consistently, the variants 7a/b,
8, and 9, containing a potential NMD-targeting stop
codon in the exon 21, were detected at very low levels.
Variants lacking the exon 19 and containing the 21b,
which would also contain a potential NMD-targeting stop
codon, were not detected. In contrast, the stop codon in
variants 1 and 3 is located only 16 nt upstream of the exon
22/23 junction and thus these variants should not be targeted to NMD. Correspondingly, the variant 1 was
detected in several tissues at relatively high levels. The low
level of variants 3a/b suggests that transcripts containing
the exon 20a/b as the only alternatively used exon might
not be efficiently generated.
Chance skipping of exons with weak splice signals could
as such lead to complex splice patterns. However, the distinct ADAM15 splice variant patterns in cell lines and tissues indicate stringent regulation by specific factors.
Alternative use of the corresponding exons in humans and
rodents indicates at least some conservation of regulatory
mechanisms, which should appear as conserved elements
in the gene sequence. Hence, the human and rodent
ADAM15 genes were comparatively examined for conserved alternative splicing-associated sequence motifs.
Splicing is primarily regulated through modulation of
splice and branch site recognition and subsequent spliceosome assembly [43-45]. The binding strength of U1,
U2AFs, and U2 snRNPs to their complementary
sequences determines how easily the splice and branch
sites will be skipped. This is further controlled by regulatory proteins which either facilitate or suppress the splice
site selection depending on the type of the binding protein and the location of the binding site. The regulatory
motifs are classified into exonic and intronic splice

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/90

enhancers (ESE, ISE) and silencers (ESS, ISS) [46]. However, this nomenclature is not unambiguous; e.g., an ESS
can enhance the splice site recognition if located within an
intron [47]. Also the relative location within an exon or
intron can influence the mode (enhancement/suppression) or potency of some regulatory elements [48].
The alternatively used ADAM15 exons appear to lack
strong exon definition. Weak splice donor and branch
sites, atypical 5'ss sequences, in particular a non-consensus nucleotide at +5 position, and low ESE numbers have
been associated with alternative exon use [27,30,49-51].
Thus the weak 5' splice and branch sites, substitution of
the +5 g in the 5'ss, and the scarcity of ESEs indicate that
the alternative ADAM15 exons might be predisposed to
skipping due to little exonic splice enhancement and inefficient splice site recognition. On the other hand, they are
almost devoid of exonic suppression elements, i.e. ESS
and hnRNP binding motifs. Hence, the alternative
ADAM15 splicing is likely not controlled through exonic
but rather through intronic motifs, consistently with the
abundance of splice enhancer and repressor motifs in the
flanking introns.
The available data do not allow prediction of the exact regulatory role of individual motifs but some suggestions can
be made based on their location, type, and conservation.
The hnRNPs have been shown to regulate alternative
splicing through competitive pre-mRNA binding
[44,45,52,53]. The conserved hnRNP I binding motifs in
the intron-18 pyrimidine tract close to the U2AF site and
the hnRNP H/F and B/D/A0 binding motifs close to the
5'ss in introns 21a and 21b, respectively, are potential
splice-regulatory sites for which the hnRNP might compete. The hnRNPs have also been suggested to regulate
alternative splicing through RNA loop-out mechanisms,
in which homotypic interaction of pre-mRNA-bound
hnRNPs enhances the use of splice sites by bringing them
into proximity [54]. On the other hand, the model posits
that if the looped-out RNA segment includes splice site(s),
the corresponding exon would be skipped. The number
and location of hnRNP H/F binding motifs in introns 19,
20, and 21 suggest that a looping-out mechanism may
regulate splicing of the alternative ADAM15 exons 20 and
21.
The introns flanking the alternatively used ADAM15
exons contain several ESEs, SR-protein binding motifs,
and ESSs possibly regulating the splice site use. The ESEs
and SR-protein binding to motifs near the branch sites in
the introns 19 and 20 may affect the downstream exon
splicing via regulating branch site and 3'ss complex formation [44,55]. The SR-binding motifs just downstream
of the exons 18, 19, and 21 could enhance their splicing
by facilitating U2, U2AF, and U1 binding [56]. ESEs and

Page 13 of 20
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:90

SR-binding motifs in the unique region of exon 21b might
enhance the distal 5'ss use. However, the ESSs in this
region might enhance the selection of weak intron 21a
5'ss over the downstream 21b 5'ss. This could suppress
the exon 21b use, as suggested by a recent study of the
general role of intronic ESS motifs [47].
Fox-family proteins [57] are obvious candidate regulators
of alternative ADAM15 splicing, suggested by the conserved Fox-binding motifs in the introns 19, 20, and 21.
The Fox proteins have been shown to specifically affect the
alternative splicing of their targets in several tissues
[31,58-65]. Fox-binding elements have been shown to
function as downstream splice enhancers or upstream
silencers in mammals [65], and it remains to be elucidated which Fox-intron interactions might regulate the
alternative splicing of individual ADAM15 exons.
The CUGCUA and AUGCAU motifs have also been associated with alternative splicing [30] although their cognate regulatory proteins have not been identified. Their
location close to the 5'- and 3'ss in ADAM15 intron 18,
and conservation of the CUGCUA between human and
rat, suggest that these motifs might contribute to the regulation of alternative use of ADAM15 exon 19.
Other potential intronic regulatory elements in the alternatively spliced ADAM15 region are the conserved recognition motifs for splice factors of Nova, CELF, and MBNL
families. These proteins regulate alternative splicing
mostly as intronic upstream splice silencers and downstream enhancers [66-69]. However, their competitive
binding with any splice factors could have an effect independently of the relative exon position. The uneven distribution of motif types in ADAM15 introns suggests that
each of these splice factor families could affect the splicing
of ADAM15 exons differently.
Alternative exon use might provide a novel physiological
mechanism for functional ADAM15 regulation. Differential splicing of the three cytosolic-encoding exons in
human tissues indicates differential regulation of
ADAM15 variant production. This regulation appears to
be disturbed in cancer cells which show aberrant ADAM15
variant patterns [19]. However, it remains to be investigated whether the ADAM15 mRNA variants are translated
into protein isoforms in human tissues. Endogenous production of a longer ADAM15 protein isoform has been
demonstrated in cultured mouse cells [20]. Although the
molecular function of ADAM15 is poorly understood it
has been associated with e.g. cell migration. In one cell
type ADAM15 enhanced cell migration [70] whereas it
inhibited motility in another [71], suggesting different
function in different cells. It is intriguing to speculate that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/90

the differential splicing of ADAM15 transcripts could be a
regulatory mechanism for such differences.
An obvious consequence of alternative ADAM15 splicing
is the differential propensity of ADAM15 protein isoforms
to regulatory cytosolic interactions. Thus alternative splicing could affect the cytosolic regulation of ADAM15 function or subcellular targeting. The cytosolic region of the
deduced ADAM15 isoforms contains different sets of recognition motifs for signaling and adaptor protein interaction domains such as SH3. Several cytosolic protein
tyrosine kinases, mitotic control factors, and cytoskeletal
adaptors have been shown to interact with "the" ADAM15
(i.e., isoform-2) [3,72-74]. Yamamoto and coworkers
have demonstrated that mouse ADAM15 isoform corresponding to human isoform-6 bound more strongly to Src
family proteins than the "normal" form (isoform-2) and
this interaction was enhanced by a phorbol ester in mouse
cells, a treatment known to activate ADAM metalloproteases [20,21]. Our unpublished results indicate differential SH3-interactions for human ADAM-15 isoforms in
vitro.
The intron/exon structure and deduced protein sequences
indicate that ADAM15 comprises a subfamily with
ADAMs 8, 9, 12, 19, and 28. The similarity suggests that
the subfamily members may share functional and/or regulatory characteristics. ADAM15 is the only subfamily
member for which the alternative use of the corresponding exons in the cytosolic-encoding region is conserved in
between humans and mice. Another difference is the
apparently lost intron from the ectodomain-encoding
part of human and mouse ADAM15 genes. Its presence in
almost all other ADAM genes indicates that this intron
was deleted from an ancestral gene before the divergence
of human and rodent lineages. The possible functional
parallels with other subgroup members provide clues for
further elucidation of the physiological and pathological
roles and regulation of ADAM15.

Conclusion
The human ADAM15 gene sequence, genomic structure,
and promoter were characterized. For the first time, differential alternative ADAM15 splicing was demonstrated in
normal human tissues, indicating that alternative exon
use is a physiological post-transcriptional mechanism regulating ADAM15 expression. The genomic exon-intron
structure is identical between human and rodent genes,
and the considerable sequence-similarity of the human
ADAM15 promoter with the corresponding region in
mouse and rat, including several conserved transcription
factor recognition motifs, suggests similarities in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Also, the alternative
use of the same ADAM15 introns in human and mouse

indicates conservation of at least some mechanisms regulating alternative splicing.

[76,77]. The ADAM15 gene sequence was submitted to
the GenBank [GenBank: AF314227].

The present results provide important clues for further
studies. Knowledge of the ADAM15 gene structure and
transcriptional control elements are important prerequisites for better understanding of its mis-regulation in cancers and other diseases as well as for the elucidation of its
physiological role. As alternative splicing is emerging as
an important mechanism increasing the functional diversity of gene expression, characterization of the regulation
mechanisms of alternative ADAM15 exon use will also
provide novel information of alternative splicing in general. ADAM15 is particularly useful for monitoring
changes in splice-regulation because the variant profiles
arising from the alternative use of the three tandemly
located exons can be readily examined with the straightforward and sensitive fPCR assay.

ADAM15 transcription start site determination
A successive PCR strategy was used for the transcription
start site determination. Briefly, one downstream primer
at a fixed position along the ADAM15 cDNA was used in
PCR reactions against upstream primers, at successive
positions upstream along the genomic sequence. Genespecific cDNA template was reverse-transcribed with
ADAM15 exon 5 antisense primer CCTGGTAGCAGCAGTTCTCC from 5 µg HCC-1954 and SK-BR-3 cell line
total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). ADAM15 5'-target fragments were amplified with a common exon 2 antisense
primer CTTCTCTGACTCTGCCTGCTGC paired with a
series of sense primers (successively further up along the
genomic sequence) that covered the putative ADAM15
promoter region and upstream region containing the last
exons of the upstream-neighbour gene FLJ32785, at both
transcribed and intronic positions. The upstream primers,
with the genomic locations relative to the ADAM15 translation start ATG were as follows: (FLJe10/-5447) CTTCTGCCAGATCGATGACC, (FLJe15/-3338) GCGGATCCTG
TTCCTCTACA, (FLJi15/-1419) AGCTCTCAGGGAGGGC
TAAA, (FLJe16/-638) GTGTACTGCTGGTCGTGCTG, (FL
Je16/-473) AAATGCCCTGTACGCTTCAC, (-355) GGA
GGCCGCGAAGCTACTA, (-170) CTTTGCCGGGGGCGGAGCT, (e1/-159) GCGGAGCTTGGCTTGGGGC, (e1/149) GCTTGGGGCCGGGTGGGA, (e1/-130) GGGGCGGGCCGGGGCGGGGC, (e1/-114) GGGCCTGGTGGCC
GCGCG, (e1/-100) CGCGGCGCTGCTGGGTTCT, (e1/86) GTTCTCCGAGGCGACCTG, and (e1/-1) CATGCGGCTGGCGCTGCTCT; (i and e indicate intronic and
exonic hybridization sites of the primers, respectively).

Methods
Cell lines
Human cell lines HCC-1954 (ATCC CRL-2338), MDA361 (ATCC HTB-27), HCC-202 (ATCC CRL2316), and
SK-BR-3 (ATCC HTB-30) were provided by the IMT Cancer Biology Laboratory (Institute of Medical Technology,
University of Tampere) and cultured according to American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) recommendations
[75].
ADAM15 gene sequencing
PAC clone containing the ADAM15 gene sequence was
identified from an arrayed human genomic PAC-library as
described in [23]. PAC-DNA was purified with Qiagen
Miniprep reagents (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and used
as the template for PCR amplification of overlapping
ADAM15 gene regions. Sequencing confirmed that the
PAC-clone 240C8 contains the whole ADAM15 gene
region. Over 100 PCR and sequencing primers were
designed based on sequence information of human
ADAM15 cDNA (GenBank accessions U46005 and
U41767) and the unfinished human genomic sequence
up- and downstream of the ADAM15 coding sequence
(GenBank accession AL451085.6).

Amplified cDNA and gene fragments were gel-purified
with MinElute gel extraction reagents (Qiagen) and
directly sequenced or cloned. Sequencing was done with
BigDye sequencing reagents according to the manufacturer's cycle sequencing protocol (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). Sequencing reactions were analysed
with ABI Prism 310 and 3100 sequencers, and ABI data
collection software, version 1.0.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Genomic ADAM15 sequence contig was assembled and
manually aligned with ADAM15 cDNA and EST
sequences using the Genedoc sequence editor program

PCR reactions were carried out for 30 and 35 cycles, in the
presence of 8% DMSO, and the amplified DNAs were analysed with agarose gel electrophoresis. The products
clearly detectable after 30 cycles of PCR were considered
as normal ADAM15 expression, and the products that
appeared only after 35 PCR cycles were judged as minor
forms.
ADAM15 cDNA variant cloning and luciferase reporter
plasmid construction
Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cells using Trizol reagent with standard protocol (Invitrogen). 2 µg of
total RNA from SK-BR-3, HCC-1954, MDA-361, and ZR75-1 cells was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II
reverse transcriptase and T24V-primer (V denotes any
deoxynucleotide except T). The full-length ADAM15
cDNA was PCR-amplified using the primer pair GTTCTCCGAGGCGACCTG (sense e1/-86)/CGCAGAGTGTTGCTTGACAG (antisense e23/2598). Most of the cytosolic

tail-encoding ADAM15 cDNAs were cloned as partial
ADAM15 cDNAs with the upstream primers GGGCACAG
GAATGTCGAAG (e15/1958) or GATGCTTGGTGCCAGC
TACT (e18/2127) and the downstream primer CGCAGAGTGTTGCTTGACAG priming within the common 3'untranslated region of the ADAM15 cDNA variants (e23/
2598). The PCR products were gel purified and TA-cloned
into topoisomerase-coupled pCRII or pCR2.1 plasmid
vectors (Invitrogen). Over 100 clones containing cytosolic
tail-encoding cDNA variants were sequenced.
For the promoter analysis constructs, six different sized
ADAM15 upstream regions were inserted in forward orientation to the upstream cloning site of the enhancerless
luciferase-reporter plasmid pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, ADAM15 upstream region -3231 to
-23 was amplified from the 240C8-PAC DNA with a common BamHI-overhang antisense primer AGTCGGGATCCCGAGGGCAGCAAGTGCGGAACAG and sense primers
AGCAGAAGGCTCCGGTAAGT (-3231), XhoI-overhang
CTGCCGCTCGAGCTGCAGGAACATGCTGGGATTCCTTGAC (-1582), and XhoI-overhang GAACCGCTCGAGCGGACTCCGCACAGTTGCGGGGAA (-266). The BamHIand XhoI-primer restriction sites and the native sites XhoI,
ApaI, and PstI were used in double digestion to produce
cohesive ends for -3108/-23, -1582/-23, -266/-23, -1178/
-23, and -415/-23 fragments. The restriction enzymes were
purchased from Fermentas (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The sixth ADAM15 construct (pGL2--266/-170+121/-23) was a coincidental PCR-deletion-form found
during the screen for -266/-23 promoter clones. All pGL2ADAM15 constructs were sequenced to verify their insert
sequences.
Luciferase reporter assay
For each pGL2-ADAM15-construct, pGL2-Basic (control
plasmid, luciferase without ADAM15 insert), and pGL2Promoter (SV40 promoter), two triplicate sets of transfections were done with both SK-BR-3 and HCC-1954 cell
lines. The cells were transfected with 4 µg pGL2-plasmid
for each 3.2 cm well together with Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). The luciferase activity was measured
with Promega luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 1254
Luminova luminometer (Bio-Orbit, Turku, Finland) or
Luminoskan Ascent multi-plate luminometer (Thermo/
Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland). The measured luciferase
activities were normalized to the total protein determined
with Detergent Compatible Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and Multiskan EX spectrometer (Thermo/
Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland).

Analysis of ADAM15 expression and mRNA variant
profiles in human tissues
ADAM15 expression and alternative ADAM15 exon use in
normal human tissues were studied with real-time qPCR
and fPCR, respectively. The human tissue cDNAs (MTC
multiple tissue panels I and II) were purchased from
Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA).
Real-time qPCR
The ADAM15-primer pair GAGAAAGCCCTCCTGGATG
(forward/exon 10) and GGGCAGAATTCAGGCAAGT
(reverse/exon 14) and the TBP (TATA box-binding protein)-primer pair GAATATAATCCCAAGCGGTTTG (forward) and ACTTCACATCACAGCTCCCC (reverse) were
used in real-time qPCRs to examine the TBP-normalized
ADAM15 expression level in the tissue samples. The reactions were done with QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR reagents (Qiagen) using LightCycler thermal cycler (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany).
Fluorescence-PCR and fragment analysis
ADAM15 mRNA variants were detected from the human
tissue cDNAs using PCR with the 5'-6-carboxyfluorescein
(FAM)-labeled forward primer CTCAGCTCAAAGCAACCAGCTG (exon 17–18) and the reverse primer GGTCTGGAGGGTACCACTAGG (exon 22–23). Amplified DNAs
and ROX-1000 DNA size standard (Applied Biosystems)
were diluted into HiDi formamide (Applied Biosystems),
and resolved with capillary electrophoresis and detected
using ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). This sensitive and quantitative method will be
described in more detail elsewhere (Ortiz RM, Kleino I,
Isola J, Huovila A-PJ: Aberrant ADAM15 alternative exon
use in human breast cancer, submitted). The fragment
lengths and volumes were analyzed with Applied Biosystems Genoprofiler software.
ADAM15 gene sequence analysis
Mouse and rat genomic and cDNA sequences corresponding to the human ADAM15 genomic region (-3231 to
11799) sequence were acquired from the GenBank using
nucleotide BlastN search of the non-redundant and HTGS
databases [78], and mega-BlastN for assembled genomes.
The acquired mouse adam15 gene sequence was used in
the overall phylogenetic footprinting analyses, and rat
adam15 gene region sequence in the promoter and splice
regulatory motif analyses as well as for guiding the
genomic mouse/human alignment in ambiguous regions.

The genomic regions were examined for repetitive
sequences with the RepeatMasker program [79] and the
CpG islands were detected with the CpGPlot program
[80,81].

The matrix searches for transcription factor binding sites
were done with the public version of Match [82] using the
vertebrate TF binding site matrices of Transfac 6.0 database [83]. The cut-offs were set for the matrix similarity to
0.9 and for the core similarity to 0.9. Putative composite
elements [84,85] within the promoter region were
searched with the Compel Pattern Search 1.0 program
[86].
Phylogenetically conserved TF binding sites in the
genomic sequences were searched using the Consite [87]
with following settings: only vertebrate transcription factors with minimum specificity of 9 bits and transcription
factor score threshold 84% were searched, conservation
cut-off 50, window size 50. The ADAM15 ORF was
excluded from the analysis
The alignment for the sequence identity visualization tool
mVista [88] was done with the MAVID [89] and for the
visualization tool PiP-maker [90] with the BlastZ. The
alignment used in the Consite analysis was assembled
manually from the initial alignment of the human,
mouse, and rat genomic and cDNA sequences made with
the ClustalW program [91]. The alignment was manually
modified in the Genedoc program to correspond to the
colinear blocks found with the Blast2 program [92]. The
visual comparison of all genomic and cDNA sequences
was used to guide optimal alignment of the poorly
aligned regions. This alignment was later found to be very
close to alignment produced with BlastZ which uses similar but fully automated alignment algorithm based on
blast-program [93]. The manual alignment was used in
the Consite analysis because some regions, e.g. the promoter region containing simple repeats, didn't align optimally with any of the tested automated alignment
programs. The MAVID alignment was used in the mVista
and rVista analyses and BlastZ alignment in the PiP-maker
because these programs required the use of the accompanying alignment programs.

the articles were searched for, but only those that were
found in ADAM15 gene sequence are shown in Figure 4.
ADAM family comparison
For comparison of ADAM15 to other ADAM family members, the genomic and protein sequences of human,
mouse, and C. elegans (ADAM14) ADAMs were retrieved
from the GenBank. The protein sequences were aligned
according to sequence-similarity. The correspondence of
the intron locations and phases to the protein sequences
was determined with the Wise 2 program [116] and
checked manually. ADAMs were divided into subgroups
based on the similarity of the genomic structure and protein sequence. A phylogenetic tree depicting the amino
acid sequence-similarities of the ADAM proteins was built
in the Clustal X and visualized with the Unrooted (Fig.
6C).

Authors' contributions
IK carried out the cloning, sequencing, reporter expression, and PCR experiments, the sequence analyses, and
initial drafting of the manuscript. RO participated in the
set-up of the fPCR/capillary electrophoresis experiments,
data analysis, and contributed to the manuscript. AH participated in the planning of the study and finalization of
the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final
manuscript.

The branch sites were located and scored with Branch-Site
Anlyzer program implementing the algorithm described
in Kol et al. [51] and with ASD-workbench [94]. The 5'and 3'-splice site binding energies and consensus scores
were determined with the Splice-Site-Analyzer developed
by the Ast lab [95] and with the ASD-workbench [94]. The
consensus sequences used for the branch, 5'-, and 3'-splice
sites were from [95,96].
Exonic splicing enhancer/silencer motifs were searched
for with the Rescue-ESE server (ESEs) [27], the PESXserver (PESEs/PESSs) [29], the ESE-finder [97], and the
ESR-search (ESRs and ESSs) [47,48]. The searched spliceregulatory motifs were collected from the literature: C-rich
and G-rich ISEs [96]; GT-rich (alternative ISEs) [98];
