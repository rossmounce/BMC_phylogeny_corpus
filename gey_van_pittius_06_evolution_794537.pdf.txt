Abstract
Background: The PE and PPE multigene families of Mycobacterium tuberculosis comprise about 10% of the
coding potential of the genome. The function of the proteins encoded by these large gene families remains
unknown, although they have been proposed to be involved in antigenic variation and disease pathogenesis.
Interestingly, some members of the PE and PPE families are associated with the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster
regions, which are regions of immunopathogenic importance, and encode a system dedicated to the
secretion of members of the potent T-cell antigen ESAT-6 family. This study investigates the duplication
characteristics of the PE and PPE gene families and their association with the ESAT-6 gene clusters, using
a combination of phylogenetic analyses, DNA hybridization, and comparative genomics, in order to gain
insight into their evolutionary history and distribution in the genus Mycobacterium.
Results: The results showed that the expansion of the PE and PPE gene families is linked to the
duplications of the ESAT-6 gene clusters, and that members situated in and associated with the clusters
represent the most ancestral copies of the two gene families. Furthermore, the emergence of the repeat
protein PGRS and MPTR subfamilies is a recent evolutionary event, occurring at defined branching points
in the evolution of the genus Mycobacterium. These gene subfamilies are thus present in multiple copies
only in the members of the M. tuberculosis complex and close relatives. The study provides a complete
analysis of all the PE and PPE genes found in the sequenced genomes of members of the genus
Mycobacterium such as M. smegmatis, M. avium paratuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans, and M. tuberculosis.
Conclusion: This work provides insight into the evolutionary history for the PE and PPE gene families of
the mycobacteria, linking the expansion of these families to the duplications of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene
cluster regions, and showing that they are composed of subgroups with distinct evolutionary (and possibly
functional) differences.

Background
The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains five
copies of the immunopathologically-important ESAT-6
(esx) gene clusters [1]. Each gene cluster encodes proteins
involved in energy provision for active transport, membrane pore formation and protease processing, which
assembles to form a dedicated biosynthesis, transport and
processing system for the secretion of the potent T-cell
antigens belonging to the ESAT-6 protein family [1-9].
Although other, chromosomally unlinked, but homologous, genes seem to play a role in this novel secretory system [10,11], there are two families of genes present within
the clusters which have no apparent function in the secretion system, namely the PE and PPE gene families (Figure
1A).
The PE and PPE gene families of M. tuberculosis encode
large multi-protein families (99 and 69 members, respectively) of unknown function [12,13]. These protein families comprise about 10% of the coding potential of the
genome of M. tuberculosis [12]. The PE family is characterized by the presence of a proline-glutamic acid (PE) motif
at positions 8 and 9 in a very conserved N-terminal
domain of approximately 110 amino acids [14]. Similarly, the PPE family also contains a highly conserved, but
unique, N-terminal domain of approximately 180 amino
acids, with a proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) motif at
positions 7–9 (Figure 2A) [12]. Although the N-terminal
domains are conserved within each family, there is very
little N-terminal homology between the two different
families. The C-terminal domains of both of these protein
families are of variable size and sequence and frequently
contain repeat sequences of different copy numbers [14].
Both the PE and PPE protein families can be divided into
subfamilies according to the homology and presence of
characteristic motifs in their C-terminal domains [14].
The polymorphic GC-rich-repetitive sequence (PGRS)
[15] subfamily of the PE family is the largest subfamily
(65 members) and contains proteins with multiple tandem repeats of a glycine-glycine-alanine (Gly-Gly-Ala) or
a glycine-glycine-asparagine (Gly-Gly-Asn) motif in the Cterminal domain [14]. The other PE subfamily (34 members) consists of proteins with C-terminal domains of low
homology [14]. The PPE family can be broadly divided
into four subfamilies [14,16] of which the PPE-SVP subfamily is the largest (24 members). The proteins of this
subfamily are characterized by the motif Gly-X-X-Ser-ValPro-X-X-Trp between position 300 and 350 in the amino
acid sequence (Figure 2B). The major polymorphic tandem repeat (MPTR) PPE subfamily is the second largest
(23 members) and contains multiple C-terminal repeats
of the motif Asn-X-Gly-X-Gly-Asn-X-Gly, encoded by a
consensus repeat sequence GCCGGTGTTG, separated by
5 bp spacers [17,18]. The third subfamily (10 members),

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

recently identified by Adindla and Guruprasad [16], is
characterized by a conserved 44 amino acid residue region
in the C-terminus comprising of highly conserved GlyPhe-X-Gly-Thr and Pro-X-X-Pro-X-X-Trp sequence motifs
(Figure 2C, named the "PPE-PPW" subfamily for the purpose of this study). The last PPE subfamily (12 members)
consists of proteins with a low percentage of homology at
the C-terminus [14].
An early paper by Doran and coworkers [19] suggested
that the members of the PPE-MPTR family were likely to
be cell wall associated. Association of a PPE protein with
the mycobacterial cell wall was first demonstrated experimentally for the PPE-MPTR protein Rv1917c (PPE34),
which was also demonstrated to be at least partly exposed
on the cell surface [20]. It has subsequently been shown
that certain PE_PGRS proteins are cell-surface constituents
[21-23] which influence the cellular architecture and colony morphology [23] as well as the interactions of the
organism with other cells [21]. More recently, it has been
demonstrated that the PPE proteins Rv2108 (PPE36) and
Rv3873 (PPE68) are also both cell-wall associated
[24,25]. Furthermore, Pajon and coworkers [26] have
identified at least one outer membrane anchoring domain
with the potential to form a beta-barrel outer-membrane
protein-like structure in 40 different PE and PPE proteins.
It has yet to be shown whether all PE and PPE proteins
localize to the cell wall, and secretion into the extracellular environment has not been ruled out.
Although the function of the 168 members of the PE and
PPE protein families has not been established, various
hypotheses have been advanced. The fact that these genes
encode about 4% of the total protein species in the organism (if all genes are expressed), suggests that they most
probably fulfill an important function or functions in the
organism. The most widely-supported theory suggests the
involvement of these proteins in antigenic variation due
to the highly polymorphic nature of their C-terminal
domains [12,14,27]. In agreement with this, sequence
variation has been observed between the orthologues of
the PE and PPE protein families in in silico analyses of the
sequenced genomes of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis CDC1551 and M. bovis [28-30]. Extensive variation of
a subset of PPE genes in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis
has also been observed (S. Sampson, unpublished results)
and a recent study by Talarico et al. [31] found sequence
variation for PE_PGRS33 (Rv1818c) in 68% of clinical
isolates spanning all three M. tuberculosis principal genetic
groups [32]. Additionally, Srivastava et al. [33] showed in
an analysis of more than 300 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis that the MPTR domain of the PPE gene Rv0355c
(PPE8) displayed several polymorphisms. There is also
ample evidence available for differential expression of
members of the PE/PE_PGRS family between different

strains of M. tuberculosis [34] as well as under different
environmental and experimental conditions. [35-38].
However, the observed sequence variation and differential expression has yet to be related to antigenic variation.
An alternative way in which the PE and PPE proteins may
interact with the host immune system is by the inhibition
of antigen processing [12]. Some support for this hypothesis is provided by a report that a DNA vaccine construct
based on the conserved N-terminal PE region of the
PE_PGRS protein Rv1818c (PE_PGRS33) is able to elicit a
cellular immune response, whereas a construct containing
the whole PE_PGRS region is unable to do so [39], suggesting that the PGRS repeats are in some way able to
influence antigen processing and presentation. This is
supported by a recent follow-up study, in which Dheenadhayalan and coworkers [40] demonstrated that expression
of the complete PE_PGRS33 protein in the non-pathogenic fast-growing M. smegmatis, causes the strain to survive better in infected macrophage cultures and mice than
a parental strain or a strain expressing only the PE domain
of the protein. Work done by Delogu et al. [23] proved
that the PE domain of PE_PGRS33 is necessary for subcellular localization, while the PGRS domain, but not PE,
affects the bacterial shape and colony morphology. It was
also shown previously that an M. bovis BCG strain containing a transposon insertion in PE_PGRS33 could not
infect (and survive in) macrophages and showed dispersed growth in liquid media [21]. Complementation of
this mutant restored infectivity of macrophages as well as
aggregative growth (clumping) in liquid media [21].
Other diverse clues to the potential functions of the members of these families exist. For example, Rodriguez and
colleagues [41,42] have found that the PPE gene Rv2123
(PPE37) is upregulated under low iron conditions, leading to the hypothesis that this gene may encode a
siderophore involved in iron uptake. One member of the
PE_PGRS family, Rv1759c (wag22), has been characterized as a fibronectin binding protein [43,44]. Interestingly, the orthologue of this gene in the closely-related
genome of M. bovis is a pseudogene, the absence of which
could potentially play a role in influencing host or tissue
tropism [30]. It was also shown that two M. marinum
orthologues of the PE_PGRS subfamily are essential for
replication in macrophages as well as persistence in granulomas [45]. More recently, an M. avium PPE protein
(Rv1787/PPE25 orthologue), expressed only in macrophages, has been shown to influence macrophage vacuole
acidification, phagosome-lysosome fusion and replication in macrophages; and to be associated with virulence
in mice [36]. Additional data supports the notion that
members of the PPE gene family may be involved in disease pathogenesis, as a transposon mutant of the PPE gene
Rv3018c (PPE46) was attenuated for growth in macro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

phages [46]. Sassetti et al. [47], confirmed the importance
of Rv3018c and identified a further 5 PPE genes (Rv0286/
PPE4, Rv0755c/PPE12, Rv1753c/PPE24, Rv3135/PPE50
and Rv3343c/PPE54) and 3 PE genes (Rv0285/PE5,
Rv0335c/PE6 and Rv1169c/PE11) as essential for in vitro
growth in a transposon-mutagenesis-based screen,
although a follow-up study by the same group [48]
showed that only two PPE's (Rv1807/PPE31 and Rv3873/
PPE68) and one PE (Rv3872/PE35) are specifically
required for mycobacterial growth in vivo during infection
of mice. The authors speculated that the fact that such a
small fraction were detected in their system suggests either
that most of these genes are able to functionally complement each other, or that they are required under conditions that were not tested. Interestingly, Rv3872 (PE35)
and Rv3873 (PPE68), required for in vivo growth, are both
situated within the ESAT-6 gene cluster region 1 [1],
which has been previously shown to be involved in pathogenicity of the organism [4,6,8,49-51], while Rv0285
(PE5) and Rv0286 (PPE4), required for in vitro growth, are
both situated within the ESAT-6 gene cluster region 3 [1].
Recently, Jain and coworkers [52] identified three
PE_PGRS
genes
(Rv0977/PE_PGRS16,
Rv0978c/
PE_PGRS17 and Rv0980c/PE_PGRS18) and two PPE
genes (Rv1801/PPE29 and Rv3021c/PPE47) to be up-regulated by at least 8-fold in human brain microvascular
endothelial-cell-associated M. tuberculosis and showed
that at least Rv0980c and Rv1801 are potentially required
for endothelial-cell invasion and/or intracellular survival.
This confirmed data by Talaat at al. [53] which identified
the same PE_PGRS genes Rv0977, Rv0978c and Rv0980c
to form part of a so-called in vivo-expressed genomic
island that was highly expressed only in vivo and not in
vitro.
The evolution and distribution of the members of the PE
and PPE gene families in the genus Mycobacterium, as well
as their association with the ESAT-6 gene cluster regions
within these organisms are unknown. The only attempt to
obtain some insight into the relationships among members of specifically the large PE_PGRS gene family was
done in an analysis by Espitia et al. [44], in order to identify the closest relatives of a PE_PGRS sequence involved
in fibronectin-binding. This resulted in an uninformative
unrooted tree only suggesting a complex evolutionary history for this gene family.
Sequencing of the complete genomes of organisms has
provided a wealth of information concerning phenotype
and evolution. The information obtained from these
sequencing projects can be used to trace the evolution of
genes and gene families using comparative genomics. This
study investigates the evolutionary history of the mycobacterial PE and PPE gene families using in silico sequence
analyses, phylogenetic analyses, DNA hybridization and

comparative genomics of a selected set of mycobacterial
genome sequences. We attempt to answer the question of
why and how these PE and PPE genes were duplicated, as
well as provide insight into the relationship between these
genes and the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters. We envisage that
this data will provide a better understanding of the factors
involved in the considerable expansion of the PE and PPE
families, their evolutionary and functional relationship to
the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions, and the evolution of
the mycobacterial genome.

Results and Discussion
Identification of the most ancestral PE and PPE genes
The PE and PPE gene families are not present outside the genus
Mycobacterium
In order to be able to construct a robust evolutionary history of the PE and PPE gene families through phylogenetic
analysis, it is of critical importance to first identify the
most ancestral representatives of both these families.
These ancestral genes are used as the root for the construction of the relationship tree, and represents the origin of
the family. Comparative genomics, during which the
genomes of different species are compared to look for differences and similarities, is the tool of choice for the identification of orthologues of genes in these species. To date,
31 mycobacterial genome sequencing projects are in various stages of completion (see Table 1), representing a valuable resource for comparative genomics analyses within
the genus Mycobacterium. A detailed examination of the
sequenced genomes of species belonging to closelyrelated genera to the mycobacteria (e.g. Corynebacteria,
Nocardia etc.) have shown that the PE and PPE genes are
not found outside of the genus Mycobacterium (data not
shown). This is in agreement with the published genome
analyses of these organisms [54-60]. Where repetitive proteins with some homology to the PE and PPE gene families have been identified previously (e.g. nfa8180 in
Nocardia farcinica and SAV5103, SAV6636, SAV6731,
SAV7299 in Streptomyces avermitilis – see Ishikawa et al.
[59]), this is merely due to unspecific alignment of the
repetitive regions and these proteins do not contain the
conserved N-terminal PE and PPE domains or the conserved PE and PPE motifs. The answer to the evolution
and expansion of these multigene PE and PPE families
thus lies within the genus Mycobacterium.
Generation of a mycobacterial phylogenetic tree
A phylogenetic tree was generated using the 16S rRNA
gene sequence of 83 species of the genus Mycobacterium,
with the sequence of the species Gordonia aichiensis as the
outgroup (Figure 3). This was done in order to determine
the evolutionary history of the genus Mycobacterium and
to identify the sequenced species closest to the origin/last
common ancestor of the genus. This species would provide the most valuable data with regards to the presence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

and origin of the ancestral PE and PPE genes. The taxonomical relationships between members of the genus
Mycobacterium based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence
information in this tree is comparable to data published
previously by Pitulle et al. [61], Shinnick and Good [62]
and Springer et al. [63]. The phylogenetic positions of all
the sequenced mycobacterial species are indicated in yellow in Figure 3. From this analysis it is apparent that the
non-pathogenic, fast-growing mycobacterium M. smegmatis is the sequenced species closest to the last common
ancestor (the genome sequences of M. abscessus and M.
chelonae have not been released publicly) and the genome
sequence of this species thus represents the ancestral reference point for the investigation of the evolution of these
gene families within the mycobacteria.

Analysis of the genome sequence of M. smegmatis revealed
only two pairs of the PE and PPE gene families. None of
the other members of the PE or PPE gene families, including any of the PE_PGRS or PPE-MPTR genes, could be
detected within the M. smegmatis genome. The first pair
corresponds to the Rv3872/3 orthologues (MSMEG0062
and MSMEG0063) from ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region
1 (70% and 55% similarity to the M. tuberculosis H37Rv
proteins, respectively), while the second pair corresponds
to the Rv0285/6 orthologues (MSMEG0608 and
MSMEG0609) from ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 3
(87% and 64% similarity to the M. tuberculosis H37Rv
proteins, respectively). These two gene pairs have been
shown to be required for in vivo, and in vitro growth,
respectively, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv [47,48]. Thus, the
only PE and PPE genes present within the M. smegmatis
genome are found within two ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster
regions.
The PE and PPE genes from ESAT-6 region 1 are the most ancestral
genes of the two gene families
PE/PPE gene pairs are frequently associated with the
ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters in M. tuberculosis [1,64]. The
duplication order of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters within
the genome of M. tuberculosis was previously predicted by
systematic phylogenetic analyses of the constituent genes
[1]. This duplication order was shown to extend from the
ancestral region named region 4 (Rv3444c-Rv3450c) to
region 1 (Rv3866-Rv3883c), 3 (Rv0282-Rv0292), 2
(Rv3884c-Rv3895c), and lastly to region 5 (Rv1782Rv1798) (Figure 1A). The absence of a pair of PE and PPE
genes within the most ancestral ESAT-6 region, region 4 (a
region which is also present in species outside of the
genus Mycobacterium)[1], indicates that these genes may
have been integrated into the first duplicate of this region
(region 1), and have subsequently been co-duplicated

together with the rest of the genes within the subsequent
four regions (Figure 1).
The genome of M. smegmatis only contains three of the
five ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions (regions 4, 1, and 3),
with regions 2 and 5 being absent [1]. Although it is possible that regions 2 and 5 may have been deleted from the
genome of this organism, it is more likely that they only
evolved after the divergence of M. smegmatis, as these
regions were determined to be the last two duplicates of
the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster evolution [1]. This is supported by comparative genomics analyses of the genomes
of closely-related fast-growing mycobacteria M. flavenscens, M. vanbaalenii, M. sp MCS and M. sp JLS in which
ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions 2 and 5 were also found
to be absent, as well as M. sp KMS in which ESAT-6 (esx)
gene cluster region 2 was present, but region 5 was absent
(results not shown). This is further supported by the fact
that the genome of M. smegmatis is approximately 1.7
times larger than that of M. tuberculosis [65], and thus does
not display the same reductive properties to that observed
in the genome of, for example, M. leprae (which was confirmed to have lost ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 2 and
4 by deletion, [66]). As the only copies of the PE and PPE
gene families found in the genome of M. smegmatis were
present in ESAT-6 (esx) regions 1 and 3, and as the PE and
PPE genes are not found outside of the genus Mycobacterium, it is clear that the members of the PE and PPE genes
found within the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions 1 and
3 are the most ancestral representatives of these two gene
families. Furthermore, as ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region
1 is the first duplicate of the ESAT-6 gene cluster regions,
the PE and PPE gene copies from region 1 are probably the
progenitors of all other PE and PPE genes. This is further
supported by the observation that, although these two
genes do contain the conserved N-terminal PE and PPE
regions, respectively, they do not contain any long and
complex C-termini as found in other representatives of
the families, and thus represent a pre-C-terminal elongation and repeat-region formation stage.
Phylogeny of the PE and PPE protein families in M.
tuberculosis H37Rv
Phylogenetic analysis of the ancestral PE and PPE genes situated
within the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters in M. tuberculosis H37Rv
To confirm that the PE and PPE genes found within the
ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions in M. tuberculosis shared
an evolutionary history with the other genes within the
clusters (indicating co-duplication/evolution), we constructed separate phylogenetic trees based on the results of
the independent analyses of the members of the PE and
PPE families present in the 4 PE/PPE-containing ESAT-6
(esx) gene cluster regions (regions 1, 3, 2 and 5). The
resulting phylogenetic trees (Figure 4) showed topologies
congruent to those of phylogenetic trees obtained for all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

the other gene families situated in the ESAT-6 (esx) gene
clusters [1]. From this we concluded that the PE and PPE
genes were duplicated together with the ESAT-6 (esx) gene
clusters after their initial insertion (into region 1), rather
than being inserted during multiple separate subsequent
events. These results also confirm the previously determined duplication order of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters
[1].
Phylogenetic analysis of all the PE and PPE genes present in M.
tuberculosis H37Rv
To obtain a global picture of the evolutionary relationships of all PE and PPE genes within M. tuberculosis and
not only those situated within the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters, we constructed independent phylogenetic trees based
on the results of the multiple sequence alignments of all
proteins encoded by members of the two gene families.
The phylogenetic tree constructed from the ninety-six chosen PE protein family N-terminal sequences (see Methods) was rooted to the ancestral PE outgroup from ESAT6 (esx) gene cluster region 1, namely Rv3872 (PE35, Figure 5). Similarly, the PPE protein from ESAT-6 (esx) gene
cluster region 1, namely Rv3873 (PPE68), was chosen as
the outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree constructed
independently from the sixty-four PPE sequences (Figure
6). Both trees (from the PE and PPE families, respectively)
showed a similar topology, which was conserved when
the complete protein sequences were used for analysis
instead of only the conserved N-termini (data not
shown). Each tree was characterized by five distinct (but
corresponding) sublineages (indicated by Roman numerals in Figure 5 and 6). Four of these sublineages match the
PE_PGRS, PPE-PPW, PPE-SVP and PPE-MPTR subfamilies, respectively, and these results are thus in accordance with the subgroupings of the PE and PPE families
proposed previously [12,14,16].

Since the tree topologies correspond to each other, it also
suggests a co-evolutionary history for the two gene families. Interestingly, this evolutionary scenario is also congruent with the evolutionary history determined for the
five ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters, with duplication events of
PE and PPE genes contained and associated with these
regions expanding sequentially from region 1 to 3, 2 and
lastly region 5. The topology of the phylogenetic trees suggests that the PE_PGRS and the PPE-MPTR subfamilies are
the result of the most recent evolutionary events and have
evolved from the sublineage that include the ESAT-6 (esx)
gene cluster region 5 PE and PPE genes (Figure 5 and 6,
sublineage IV). This is supported by the finding that some
members (Rv1361c/PPE19, Rv3135/PPE50 and Rv3136/
PPE51) of the PPE sublineage IV (PPE-SVP subfamily)
contain isolated MPTR-like repeats, suggesting the existence of a common progenitor gene from which the PPEMPTR subfamily expanded (data not shown). The pro-

resulted in the initial subsequent expansion of the PGRS
and MPTR subfamilies, although inherent properties of
the PGRS and MPTR repeats themselves certainly also contributed to this phenomenon.

The genes from ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 5 seem to
be highly prone to duplication, as region 5 is the only one
of the five ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters which contains multiple copies of the PE and PPE genes situated inside the
cluster (Figure 1). Furthermore, ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster
region 5 is also the parent of a number of secondary duplications containing only the genes for PE, PPE, ESAT-6
(esx) and CFP-10 (a member of the esx family) (see Figure
1B and 1C) [1]. It appears that this region plays an important role in the propagation of both the ESAT-6/CFP-10
and the PE/PPE genes. It is thus tempting to speculate that
the duplication propensity of the region 5 genes may have

Closer inspection of the relative positions of the PE and
PPE genes in the M. tuberculosis genome sequence revealed
that in a number of cases a copy of each of these families
was found situated adjacent to each other (Table 2, see
also Tundup et al. [64] and Strong et al. [67]). By examining the relative positions of the PE and PPE genes from
each pair on the separate PE and PPE phylogenetic trees,
it was found that these pairs of genes are always situated
in the same sublineage on the trees, indicating that they
were likely to be co-duplicated. Furthermore, the order of
their positions is always conserved, with the PE gene
found situated upstream of the PPE gene. These paired

genes are found in all the sublineages except in the highly
polymorphic PGRS and MPTR subfamilies (sublineage V).
In this sublineage, member genes were found situated on
their own within a specific genomic location. Thus, it is
clear that the expansion of the PGRS and MPTR subfamilies was associated with a change in their duplication
characteristics, and although the cause and significance of
this is unknown, it may point to a corresponding change
in function. In support of this, in a computational identification of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins of M.
tuberculosis, Pajon et al. [26] identified 40 PE and PPE proteins from a total of 114 predicted beta-barrel structures.
Closer inspection of the identified proteins indicate that
they all form part of sublineage V, the PE_PGRS and PPEMPTR subfamilies (23 and 17 members, respectively),
indicating a shared function between the members of
these two subfamilies.
The reason for the maintenance of the gene pairing of the
ancestral PE and PPE genes is still unclear, although these
genes may be functionally related and co-transcribed.
There is some early evidence for the latter from gene
expression data obtained during adaptation to nutrient
starvation (the gene pairs Rv0285/86 (PE5/PPE4),
Rv1195/96 (PE13/PPE18), Rv1386/87 (PE15/PPE20)
and Rv2431c/30c (PE25/PPE41) are downregulated and
the pair Rv1169c/68c (PE11/PPE17) is upregulated [68]).

Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that the genes
from at least one of these PE-PPE gene pairs, Rv2430c/
31c, are co-transcribed and that the gene products interact
with each other to form a hetero-tetramer [64]. This finding was expanded upon by Strong et al. [67], who determined the structure of the Rv2430c/31c protein
interaction, and demonstrated that the PE/PPE protein
pair forms a 1:1 complex. Intriguingly, this is similar to
the situation observed for the proteins transcribed by the
CFP-10 and ESAT-6 genes (adjacently situated to many of
the PE-PPE gene pairs – see Figure 1A and 1B), which also
forms a tight 1:1 complex [69-72] and is secreted by the
ESAT-6 transport system [4-6,8]. There is evidence that the
PPE protein encoded by Rv3873 (PPE68 from ESAT-6
(esx) gene cluster region 1) interacts with CFP-10, ESAT-6
and at least one other esx family member (Rv0288) [73].
It is thus tempting to speculate that the PE/PPE and esx
genes are not only intricately linked phylogenetically, but
also functionally, and that the PE/PPE complex may also
be secreted by the ESAT-6 transport system. In support of
this, Fortune et al. [10] have shown that the PE gene situated in ESAT-6 gene cluster region 1 (PE35 or Rv3872) are
present (together with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 from ESAT-6
gene cluster region 1) in culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis.
Although a previous study by Espitia and colleagues
aimed to address PE gene phylogeny, the authors had

excluded 19 PE sequences from their phylogenetic calculations [44]. The absence of these sequences, which
included the PE proteins belonging to the ESAT-6 (esx)
gene cluster regions 1 (Rv3872/PE35), 2 (Rv3893c/PE36)
and 3 (Rv0285/PE5), left a major gap in the study of the
evolutionary expansion of this family. Our results differ
from this study because we included these sequences,
which have been shown in the current study to be the
most ancestral representatives of the family, and thus
form the roots from which the rest of the family
expanded. We were thus able to root the tree and explain
the evolutionary history of this gene family on the basis
thereof.
Comparative genomics analyses to verify the PE and PPE
evolutionary history
In order to support the hypothesized evolutionary history
deduced from the topologies of the PE and PPE phylogenetic trees generated in this study, we performed comparative genomics analyses of the sequenced genomes of M.
avium paratuberculosis, M. avium, M. leprae, M. ulcerans and
M. marinum, chosen as representative sequenced mycobacterial species phylogenetically situated between M.
smegmatis and M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Figure 3).
M. tuberculosis H37Rv vs. M. avium and M. avium
paratuberculosis
The results from the analysis between the genomes of M.
tuberculosis H37Rv and M. avium paratuberculosis is summarized in Table 3. We found a total of 10 "ancestraltype" PE genes in the genome of M. avium paratuberculosis
(compared to the 34 "ancestral-type" PE's in M. tuberculosis), of which one is M. avium paratuberculosis-specific. We
could not find any genes belonging to the PE_PGRS subfamily, consistent with the observation by Li et al. [74].
We also identified 37 PPE genes in the genome of M.
avium paratuberculosis (compared to the 69 in M. tuberculosis), of which only one (NT03MA4150, an orthologue of
Rv0442c/PPE10) belongs to the PPE-MPTR subfamily,
and 18 are M. avium paratuberculosis-specific. When these
results were superimposed on the phylogenetic trees generated for the PE and PPE gene families in M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (Figures 7 and 8, respectively, M. avium paratuberculosis-specific genes were omitted), they showed clearly
that all the members of the PE and PPE gene families that
are present in the genome of M. avium paratuberculosis
form part of the "ancestral-type" genes, except for the
orthologue of Rv0442c. This supports the notion that
these "ancestral-type" genes represent the earliest members of the PE and PPE gene families, and shows that the
PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR subfamilies have evolved only
after the divergence of M. avium paratuberculosis. These
results were compared with that obtained with the unfinished genome sequence database of M. avium 104, which
were found to correspond to what is observed in the M.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

paratuberculosis subspecies (data not shown). This also
confirmed previously published hybridization analyses
which showed the absence of PGRS sequences in the
genome of M. avium [15,75].
One of the most interesting results from the M. avium
paratuberculosis analysis was the identification of
NT03MA4150, an orthologue of the MPTR subfamily
gene Rv0442c, the only MPTR orthologue identified in the
genome of M. avium paratuberculosis. Closer inspection
of the sequence of this and surrounding genes showed
that this gene is a true orthologue of the M. tuberculosis
MPTR gene Rv0442c (i.e. situated between the orthologues of Rv0441c and Rv0443, with the highest level of
homology to Rv0442c). However, this gene in M. avium
paratuberculosis does not contain the polymorphic MPTR
C-terminal region characteristic of the MPTR subfamily
and found in Rv0442c in M. tuberculosis. To confirm the
result, a complete sequence alignment was done with the
protein sequences of the orthologues of this gene from the
genomes of all available mycobacterial species (Figure 9).
From this analysis it was clear that members of the M.
avium complex (M. avium paratuberculosis and M. avium
104) do not contain the MPTR region in this gene, while
members of species closer to M. tuberculosis (M. marinum, M. ulcerans, M. bovis and M. microti) do contain
the repeat region. The homology between the orthologues
of the M. avium complex and that of the other species end
at exactly amino acid 180 (the consensus end for the conserved N-terminal region of the members of the PPE family). Furthermore, the tail region could not have been
omitted from the annotation of the genome of M. avium
paratuberculosis, as the 3' flanking gene (orthologue of
Rv0441c) follows 27 bp after the stopcodon of
NT03MA4150 (the intergenic region is 26 bp in M. tuberculosis, see Figure 9). This suggests that Rv0442c represents the first member of the MPTR subfamily to have
been duplicated, before the acquisition of the MPTR
repeat region. It is perhaps possible that M. avium and M.
avium paratuberculosis could have lost all the genes
belonging to the PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR subfamilies,
however, this is highly unlikely, as we could find no evidence of residues of genes or the presence of pseudogenes
which could indicate a loss of function and degeneration.
M. tuberculosis H37Rv vs. M. leprae
To gain insight into the events taking place in the phylogenetic gap between the M. tuberculosis complex and the
M. avium complex, we performed a comparative genomics
analysis between the completed genome sequences of M.
tuberculosis H37Rv and M. leprae. The genome sequence of
M. leprae is known to have undergone extensive loss of
synteny, inversion and genome downsizing [66], which
may have resulted from recombination between dispersed
copies of repetitive elements [76]. This has caused the loss

PPE genes

*The genes NT03MA3679 and NT03MA4076 was annotated as PE_PGRS family proteins in the TIGR annotation, but they are in fact not. NT03MA3679 is an orthologue
of Rv3390 (lpqD), while NT03MA4076 is a gene which is absent in M. tuberculosis (situated between Rv0358 and Rv0357c). Although it is slightly homologous to the
PE_PGRS Rv0754, this homology is only to bp 280 – 520 of the 584 bp PE_PGRS sequence (this region of homology is also highly homologous to lpqD and consists of a
biphosphatase and phosphoglycerate mutase signature). It also does not contain the conserved PE N-terminus and is thus highly unlikely to be a PE_PGRS member.

of hundreds of genes, resulting in a genome littered with
pseudogenes in various stages of decay and elimination.
Our primary aim was thus not to identify the reason for
the absence of members of the PE and PPE gene families
(which could either be due to the fact that they were never
present/duplicated, or that they were deleted), but rather
to identify whether members were present (in an intact
form), and if not, whether there were any residues left of
members (pseudogenes) which may have been lost in the
process of genome downsizing. Table 4 provides a summary of the members of the PE and PPE gene families
present in the genome of M. leprae. We identified 14 genes
from the "ancestral-type" PE family, of which 9 were pseudogenes and 5 were M. leprae-specific. In addition, 8
members of the PGRS subfamily could be identified in M.
leprae (of which 7 were pseudogenes and 4 were M. lepraespecific), indicating that the expansion of the PGRS subfamily must have started before the divergence of this
organism (Figure 7 – M. leprae-specific genes were omitted). It is interesting to note that, although there were 8
detectable PGRS members, 7 of them were pseudogenes
and only one intact PGRS gene could be identified in this
species, consistent with previously published hybridization studies which showed a general absence of PGRS
sequences in the genome of M. leprae [15]. Analysis of the
PPE subfamily led to the identification of 26 members of
the "ancestral-type" (of which 19 were pseudogenes and
13 were M. leprae-specific), with no MPTR subfamily
members present, except for ML2369c, the orthologue of
Rv0442c/PPE10 (which is also the only representative
present in the genomes of M. avium and M. avium paratuberculosis). In Figure 8, members of the PPE family identified in this study were superimposed on the phylogenetic
tree generated for the PPE gene family in M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (M. leprae-specific genes were omitted). With the
exception of the orthologue of Rv0442c (ML2369c), no
residues or pseudogenes of any of the other MPTR subfamily genes present in M. tuberculosis H37Rv could be
identified in the genome of M. leprae (including the M.
leprae-specific genes). This suggests that the MPTR subfamily was not duplicated in the genome of this organism,
and that the expansion of the MPTR subfamily thus
occurred after the divergence of M. leprae. Although it is
possible that the extensive genome downsizing in M. leprae could have caused the loss of all the members of this
gene subfamily, it is highly unlikely, and no evidence for
this was observed (no pseudogenes or residues of genes
were found as in the case of the PGRS subfamily).
To confirm the absence of MPTR genes in this species, we
analyzed the sequence of ML2369c (the Rv0442c orthologue) to determine whether it contains the C-terminal
MPTR region which is present in Rv0442c in M. tuberculosis, but absent in the Rv0442c orthologues of M. avium
and M. avium paratuberculosis. Although the gene is a pseu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

dogene and has undergone extensive degradation at the
C-terminus, complicating the sequence alignment, it is
clear that there are no MPTR repeats present in this region,
even when the C-terminal region is translated into any of
the three potential open reading frames (data not shown).
This suggests that M. leprae diverged after the start of the
expansion of the PGRS subfamily, but before that of the
MPTR's.
M. tuberculosis H37Rv vs. M. ulcerans and M. marinum
M. ulcerans and M. marinum are phylogenetically closelyrelated and are also phylogenetically close relatives of the
members of the M. tuberculosis complex (see Figure 3). The
genomes of both of these organisms have been
sequenced, with the M. ulcerans Agy99 genome annotation completed and the M. marinum M genome sequence
in the process of being annotated (Table 1). These genome
sequences thus provide an excellent resource to determine
the status of the expansion of the MPTR subfamily of the
PPE gene family in two species situated immediately outside of the M. tuberculosis complex.

An analysis of the genome of M. ulcerans was carried out
to determine the presence and absence of orthologues of
the members of the PE and PPE gene families of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in this organism. The results from the analysis between M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. ulcerans are
summarized in Additional file 1. We identified 21 genes
from the "ancestral-type" PE family in the genome of M.
ulcerans (compared to the 34 in M. tuberculosis), of which
6 were pseudogenes and 8 were M. ulcerans-specific. Of
the 6 pseudogenes, 4 were M. ulcerans-specific. In addition, 121 members of the PE_PGRS subfamily could be
identified in M. ulcerans (compared to the 65 in M. tuberculosis), of which 66 were pseudogenes and 104 were M.
ulcerans-specific. Of the 66 pseudogenes, 59 were M. ulcerans-specific. Analysis of the PPE subfamily led to the identification of 81 members (compared to the 69 in M.
tuberculosis) of which 34 were pseudogenes and 55 were
M. ulcerans-specific. Of the 34 pseudogenes, 25 were M.
ulcerans-specific. Six orthologues of members of the M.
tuberculosis PPE-MPTR subfamily were present in the
genome of M. ulcerans, including the orthologue of
Rv0442c/PPE10 (MUL_1395), in this case containing an
MPTR repeat region (see also Figure 9). Interestingly, 5 of
these 6 PPE-MPTR orthologues were pseudogenes, with
the only intact subfamily member being the orthologue of
Rv0442c, although 9 intact M. ulcerans-specific PPE-MPTR
subfamily members were also detected (MUL_0782,
MUL_0890, MUL_0893, MUL_0902, MUL_0964,
MUL_0965, MUL_2586, MUL_0098 and MUL_3169).
These results are superimposed on the phylogenetic trees
generated for the PE and PPE gene families in M. tuberculosis H37Rv in Figures 7 and 8 (M. ulcerans-specific genes
are omitted). This suggests that the acquisition of the

MPTR repeat region in the C-terminus of Rv0442c and the
expansion of the MPTR subfamily took place before the
divergence of M. ulcerans. M. ulcerans also had a vast specific expansion of the PE and PPE families, resulting in 55
more genes belonging to these two gene families than in
M. tuberculosis H37Rv, although a large number of them
have become pseudogenes, resulting in a lesser number of
functional genes in M. ulcerans (117 genes) compared to
M. tuberculosis H37Rv (168 genes). It is interesting to note
that the majority of the pseudogenes from these two gene
families in the genome of M. ulcerans are M. ulcerans-specific copies (88 out of 106 pseudogenes), and may thus
represent "unsuccessful evolutionary experiments".
An analysis of the genome of M. marinum was carried out
to determine the presence and absence of orthologues of
the members of the PE and PPE gene families of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in this organism, in order to confirm the
observations of the M. ulcerans genome. As the genome
sequence of M. marinum is still in the annotation phase,
no gene names or numbers are available, but the results of
the analyses are superimposed on the phylogenetic trees
generated for the PE and PPE gene families in M. tuberculosis H37Rv in Figure 7 and 8 (M. marinum-specific genes
are omitted). The results are analogous to what was
observed in M. ulcerans (confirming their relatedness),
and shows the presence of multiple copies of both the
PGRS and MPTR subfamilies. This confirms the previously published hybridization data which indicated the
presence of multiple copies of the PGRS sequence in the
genome of M. marinum [15]. There are, analogous to M.
ulcerans, also 6 orthologues of members of the M. tuberculosis PPE-MPTR subfamily present in the genome of M.
marinum, one of which is the orthologue of Rv0442c, in
this case also containing an MPTR repeat region (see Figure 9). This supports the observation of the M. ulcerans
genome sequence and confirms that the acquisition of the
MPTR repeat region in the C-terminus of Rv0442c and the
expansion of the MPTR subfamily took place before the
divergence of M. marinum and M. ulcerans.
Comparative genomics for extent of sequence variation
To further examine the relationships between, and evolutionary history of, the members of the subfamilies of the
PE and PPE protein families, to identify subfamily-specific
characteristics, and to determine the extent of PE and PPE
sequence similarity and variation, orthologues in the fully
sequenced and annotated genomes of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv and CDC1551 were analyzed by comparative
genomics. During this analysis, a complete investigation
of the presence and absence of genes, gene sizes,
frameshifts, insertions and deletions (indels), alternative
start sites, protein mismatches and conservative substitutions was performed. Although other strains of M. tuberculosis are also being sequenced (including strains 210, A1,

Ekat-4, K, F11, C, Haarlem, Peruvian1, Peruvian2 and W148 – see Table 1), these sequences are not completed and
verified and thus not useful for an analysis where, for
example, single nucleotide polymorphisms are investigated. Additional file 2 provides an overview of the reasons for size differences between annotated genes from
the two genome databases. This analysis shows that the
"ancestral-type" members of both the PE and PPE families, and specifically the members present within the
ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions, have remained conserved between the two different strains (with the only
reason for a difference in size being artificial, due to the
use of an alternative start site during genome annotation).
This is in contrast to the members of the PGRS and MPTR
subfamilies, which show considerable variation in size
due to frameshifts, insertions and deletions. Additional
file 3 shows a summary of the extent of sequence variation
on a protein level between the orthologues of these gene
families in the two M. tuberculosis strains and from this it
is clear that the "ancestral-type" PE and PPE genes are
highly conserved between strains, while the MPTR and
especially the PGRS subfamilies are more prone to
sequence variation (the only exception to this is PPE60
which is not an MPTR but shows a high level of variation
between the strains). These variations mostly occur in the
C-terminal polymorphic domain (after the conserved Nterminal domain of approximately 110 amino acids for
the PE members, and 180 amino acids for the PPE members), clearly demonstrating the importance of the conservation of the N-terminal domain. The results from this
study are in agreement with previously-published results
by Garnier and coworkers [30], who found blocks of
sequence variation in genes encoding 29 different
PE_PGRS and 28 PPE proteins (most of which belong to
the PPE_MPTR subfamily) resulting from frameshifts,
insertions and deletions in a comparison between the
annotated genes from the completed genomes of M. bovis
AF2122/97 and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The authors speculate that this indicates that these families can support
extensive sequence polymorphism and could thus provide a potential source of antigenic variation. It is thus
possible that the members of the PGRS and MPTR subfamilies have evolved to function as a source of antigenic
variation; a function which probably differs from the original function still performed by the members of the
"ancestral-type" subgroup (including the members
present within and associated with the ESAT-6 (esx) gene
cluster regions). The genome sequencing of other members of the M. tuberculosis complex which are currently
being performed (M. microti, M. africanum, and M. canettii) will undoubtedly shed more light on the variation
observed between the orthologues of these two large polymorphic subfamilies.

Presence of the PPE-MPTR's in members of the genus
Mycobacterium
In order to confirm the exclusive expansion of the PPEMPTR subfamily in the genomes of members of the M.
tuberculosis complex and species closely-related to it, we
performed Southern blot analyses of different mycobacterial species using two selected PPE-MPTR gene probes
(Table 5), and compared this to previously published data
on the distribution of the MPTR repeat sequence. A probe
for the mycosin gene mycP5 (Rv1796), was also selected to
be used as a marker for the presence or absence of ESAT-6
(esx) gene cluster region 5 within the genomes of these different species. The mycosins are a family of subtilisin-like
serine proteases found within the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster regions (Figure 1) [1,77,78] and represent the most
conserved genes within the ESAT-6 (esx) cluster regions
when orthologues of different species are compared (data
not shown). The Southern blot analysis was done with
genomic DNA of species of both the fast- and slow-growing mycobacterial groups (see Figure 3 and Table 6) and
the results are summarized in Figure 10.

The first analysis was done using the probe for mycP5, the
mycosin present in ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 5.
This probe gave an indication of the distribution of the
ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 5 within the genomes of
other mycobacterial species, as region 5 was hypothesized
in this study to be the origin of both the SVP and MPTR
subfamilies of the PPE gene family. The results showed
that the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 5 was only
present within the genomes of the slow-growing mycobacterial species tested. The only exception for this is the
slow-growing species M. nonchromogenicum, which
might have undergone a deletion of this region. No
hybridization was found with any members of the fastgrowing group except for M. chitae, indicating either that
the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 5 is absent from the
genomes of these species, or that the species are evolutionarily so far removed from the slow-growers that the gene
homology was insufficient to allow hybridization under
the stringent conditions used in the analysis. Given the
absence of region 5 in the genomes of M. smegmatis, M.
flavescens, M. vanbaalenii, M. sp. KMS, M. sp. MCS and

Southern hybridization analyses of the genomic DNA of 37 different species of the genus Mycobacterium

M. sp. JLS, it is highly likely that this region is absent from
all fast-growing species and that these species have
diverged before the duplication of region 5.
In order to obtain insight into the expansion and distribution of the PPE-MPTR subfamily within the slow-growing
mycobacterial species, we used the two genes Rv1917c
(PPE34) and Rv1753c (PPE24) as representatives of the
PPE-MPTR sublineage (V) for Southern hybridization
analysis. The hybridization signals were specific and
appeared to be restricted to specific members of the slow
growing mycobacterial group within and surrounding the
M. tuberculosis complex, namely M. gordonae, M. asiaticum,
M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. africanum (in the case of
Rv1917c) and M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. africanum in
the case of Rv1753c (Figure 10). The fact that both
Rv1917c and Rv1753c did not hybridize to M. marinum
and M. ulcerans is in agreement with the genome sequencing data which indicated the absence of both of these
genes within the genomes of these species. The results also
confirms the absence of these genes in the genomes of the
members of the M. avium complex. Furthermore, the
results compared favorably to previously published data
(see Column 4, Figure 10) in which the MPTR repeat
region probe was used for hybridization, and in which
only species situated in the M. tuberculosis complex, or
closely-related to the complex, were identified [17].
Previously published hybridization data on the PGRS
repeat sequence [15,75] also confirms the broader distribution and earlier expansion of this subfamily in comparison to the PPE-MPTR subfamily within the slow-growing
members of the genus Mycobacterium (see Column 5, Figure 10). This data supports the evolutionary history proposed in this study with the expansion of the PGRS
subfamily (after the divergence of the M. avium complex)
preceding that of the MPTR subfamily.
In summary, the hybridization results support the proposed phylogenetic relationships of the gene families, and
are likely to reflect evolutionary divergence/branch points
of different mycobacterial species, interspersed by periods
of PE/PPE/ESAT-6 duplication and expansion.

Conclusion
Phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of
the PE and PPE gene families suggests that the first pair of
these genes were initially inserted into the ESAT-6 (esx)
gene cluster region 1, and have subsequently been duplicated along with the regions (Figure 11). After each main
duplication event involving a complete ESAT-6 (esx) gene
cluster region, a number of secondary subduplications of
the PE and PPE genes (in some cases associated with a
copy of the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 genes, [1]) occurred from
the newly duplicated ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/95

This phenomenon is predicted to have culminated in the
duplication of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 5, from
which a large number of PE and PPE genes (the so-called
SVP subfamily of the PPE gene family) were duplicated
separately to the rest of the genome. Furthermore, the evolutionary history predicted by the phylogenetic trees suggests that the highly duplicated PE_PGRS subfamily and
subsequently the PPE-MPTR subfamily have originated
from a duplication from ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region
5. It thus seems as if the PE and PPE genes present within
region 5 have an enhanced propensity for duplication,
their mobility driving the expansion of these genes into
the highly polymorphic PGRS and MPTR subfamilies,
respectively.
The data presented in the study suggests that the PE_PGRS
subfamily expansion preceded the emergence of the PPEMPTR subfamily. A possible explanation for this observation comes from the fact that there are some resemblance
between the MPTR repeat sequence (GCCGGTGTTG) and
the complementary sequence of the core region of two
PGRS
repeat
elements
arranged
in
tandem
(TTGCCGCCGTTGCCGCCG) [15,17]. This may indicate
a potential role for the C-terminal PGRS repeat of the PE
gene family in the emergence of the C-terminal MPTR element of the PPE gene family, and may point to an evolutionary event through insertion/recombination between
the two gene families and subsequent expansion in the
MPTR subfamily. In support of this, Adindla and Guruprasad [16] have identified three PPE-MPTR proteins
(Rv1800/PPE28, Rv3539/PPE63 and Rv2608/PPE42)
which showed sequence similarity to five PE proteins
(Rv1430/PE16, Rv0151/PE1, Rv0152/PE2, Rv0159/PE3
and Rv0160/PE4) corresponding to a 225 amino acid Cterminal region, which they named the "PE-PPE domain".
Although not identified as true PGRS-containing PE
genes, all five these genes form part of sublineage V (the
PGRS-containing sublineage) and may therefore represent
precursors to the PE_PGRS sequences. There are thus
some genes from the PE and MPTR subfamilies which
share levels of homology in their C-termini. This is further
supported by the data from Pajon et al. [26] which
showed that a large proportion of the members from the
PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR subfamilies share beta-barrel
outer-membrane protein structures, and that one of these
outer-membrane anchoring domains consists of the proposed conserved "PE-PPE domain" identified by Adindla
and Guruprasad [16].
A number of recent studies using diverse approaches have
shown that the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters encode a novel
secretory apparatus [1-5,50] Most recently, the demonstration by Okkels et al. [24] that Rv3873 (PPE68), the
PPE gene present in the RD1 region, is a potent T-cell antigen, lead these authors to speculate that the ESAT-6 (esx)

Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the PE and PPE gene families of the genus Mycobacterium
Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the PE and PPE gene families of the genus Mycobacterium. Schematic representation of the suggested evolutionary history of the PE and PPE gene families. The results of this study indicated
that these genes were initially inserted into the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region 1 after the duplication of the cluster, and have
subsequently been duplicated along with the ESAT-6 regions. The expansion of the PE and PPE gene families have occurred in
unison with the expansion of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene family, throughout the evolution of the genus. Members of the genus Mycobacterium investigated in this study, have diverged at the positions indicated. After each main duplication event involving a complete ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region, a number of secondary subduplications of the PE and PPE genes (in some cases
associated with a copy of the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 genes, occurred from the newly duplicated ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster region.
The highly duplicated PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR subfamilies originated after the divergence of the M. avium complex and M. leprae, respectively. Both families were present before the divergence of M. marinum/M. ulcerans and the M. tuberculosis complex.

gene cluster promotes the presentation of key antigens,
including members of the PE and PPE protein families, to
the host immune system. It is tempting to speculate that
the ESAT-6/CFP-10 loci together with their associated PE/
PPE genes represent what might be thought of as an
"immunogenicity island". Further studies are under way
to determine whether the ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster
regions are able to secrete members of the PE and PPE protein families, whether this secretion is specific for members of the "ancestral-type" group found in the cluster
regions, and whether the recently-evolved PGRS/MPTR
types can also use this secretion system.
The large number of genes within the PE and PPE gene
families has confounded past attempts to choose representative members of the families for further analysis. This
study provides a logical starting point by defining the evolutionary history of the gene families, and elucidating the
relationships and specific features of the different subgroups. An informed choice concerning candidate genes
for further study can now be made, based on position of
the member on the evolutionary tree, association or not
with the ESAT-6 gene clusters, and subgroup-specific features. In this way, studies based upon a random choice of
members, which may be biased in not being representative of the whole spectrum of different members within
these families, could be avoided. It also provides the
opportunity to study subgroups instead of individual
members, to determine what functional differences, if
any, exists between these different subgroups.
In conclusion, we aimed to investigate the evolutionary
history of the PE and PPE gene families in relation to their
observed association with four of the five ESAT-6 (esx)
gene cluster regions. We have demonstrated that the
expansion of the PE and PPE families is linked to the
duplications of the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters. We have
also shown that this association has led to the absence of
multiple duplications of the PE and PPE families, including the total absence of the multigene PE_PGRS and PPEMPTR subfamilies, in the fast-growing mycobacteria,
including M. smegmatis. We have shown that the expansion of the PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR subfamilies took
place after the divergence of the M. avium complex, and
that the PGRS and the MPTR expansions started before the
divergence of M. leprae and M. marinum, respectively. This
study contributes to the understanding of the PE and PPE
gene families, in terms of stability, absence/presence of
the PE and PPE genes within the genomes of various
mycobacteria, and their association with the ESAT-6 (esx)
gene clusters. The results of this study also provides for a
logical starting point for the selection of candidates for
further study of these large multigene families.

Methods
Genome sequence data and comparative genomics
analyses
Annotations, descriptions, gene and protein sequences of
individual genes belonging to the PE and PPE families
were obtained from the publicly available finished and
unfinished genome sequence databases of the organisms
listed in Table 1. For comparative genomics, the genome
sequence databases were compared to that of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, in order to identify orthologous genes. BLAST
similarity searches [79] using the respective M. tuberculosis
H37Rv protein sequences and the tblastn algorithm were
performed using the WU-BLAST version 2.0 (Gish, W.
1996–2005 – [80]) server in the database search services
of the TIGR [81], Sanger Centre [82] and Genolist (Pasteur
Institute) [83] websites. To confirm the identity of the
resulting sequences, open reading frames adjacent to the
identified genes were examined to determine if they
matched the genes surrounding the corresponding M.
tuberculosis PE and PPE genes, thereby confirming the
identity of the orthologue. The unfinished genome
sequences were examined in a similar manner, but were
not analyzed in detail as sequencing is still incomplete.
Phylogenetic tree of all the members of the genus
Mycobacterium
The 16S rRNA gene sequences of 83 species of the genus
Mycobacterium, as well as the species Gordonia aichiensis,
was used to generate a phylogenetic tree of the genus
Mycobacterium. All species were selected from the Ribosomal Database Project-II Release 9 [84] to be type strains
containing only near-full-length 16S rRNA sequences
(>1200 bases, no short partials), except for the species M.
chelonae, M. spagni, M. abscessus, M. confluentis, M.
genavense, M. interjectum, M. intermedium, M. marinum, M.
ulcerans, M. haemophilum, M. acapulcensis, M. lentiflavum,
M. pulveris, M. manitobense, M. monacense, M. brumae, and
M. moriokaense, which did not have any type strains with
a near-full-length sequence of longer than 1200 bases
available in the database. For some of these species (M.
abscessus, M. confluentis, M. marinum), sequences from
type strains from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSM) [85] were available and
could thus be used. For the rest, representatives with
sequences of longer than 1200 bases were chosen according to correct alignment with type strains. The following
strains were chosen for all species (type strain indicated by
the letter T in brackets after the name):M. abscessus (T);

BioEdit version 5.0.9. [88]. The final tree was taken as the

aichiensis as the outgroup.

tion by comparative analyses. The first two datasets
included the protein sequences of all the members of the
PE and PPE protein families, respectively, that are present
within the four ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters in the genome
of M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

Clean-up and generation of PE and PPE datasets
The phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships of the members of the PE and PPE protein families of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was done by analyses of four
separate datasets. Clean-up of sample sets involved preliminary alignment to check for sequence instability or
misalignments, as well as confirmation of gene annota-

Multiple sequence alignments
Due to the highly polymorphic nature of the C-terminal
region of the PE and PPE proteins, the conserved N-terminal domains of 100 aa and 180 aa for the PE and PPE proteins, respectively, were initially used to construct the
multiple sequence alignments. Multiple sequence alignments of the protein sequences of the ninety-six PE and

The third dataset comprised the protein sequences of the
sixty-nine members of the PPE family in the M. tuberculosis
H37Rv database. Eleven of the predicted PPE proteins did
not contain the characteristic N-terminal PPE motif. However, in six of these (Rv0305c/PPE6, Rv3425/PPE57,
Rv3426/PPE58, Rv3429/PPE59, Rv3539/PPE63 and
Rv3892c/PPE69) this was only due to a substitution in
one of the two proline residues in the conserved motif.
These six protein sequences could thus be reliably aligned
to the rest of the family members due to a high percentage
of sequence homology and were included in the dataset.
The other five proteins (Rv0304c/PPE5, Rv0354c/PPE7,
Rv2353c/PPE39, Rv3021c/PPE47 and Rv3738c/PPE66)
were excluded from the analysis as it was found that their
upstream regions were disrupted by either IS6110 insertion or apparent frameshift mutations, and they could
thus not be aligned for phylogenetic analyses.
The fourth dataset contained the protein sequences of the
ninety-nine members of the PE family in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv database. One of the members of the predicted
PE family (Rv3020c) was found [1] to have been annotated incorrectly as a PE by Cole et al. [12], while two other
members (Rv3018A/PE27A and Rv2126c/PE_PGRS37)
could not be reliably aligned due to a loss of the N-terminal conserved region, and all three were thus excluded
from further analyses. Six members (Rv0833/PE_PGRS13,
Rv1089/PE10,
Rv2098c/PE_PGRS36,
Rv3344c/
PE_PGRS49,
Rv3512/PE_PGRS56,
and
Rv3653PE_PGRS61), which also did not have conserved
N-termini, were shown to be situated adjacent to a gene
encoding for the N-terminus (Rv0832/PE_PGRS12,
Rv1088/PE9, Rv2099c/PE21, Rv3345c/PE_PGRS50,
Rv3511/PE_PGRS55, and Rv3652/PE_PGRS60, respectively). Closer inspection of this organization suggested
that each of these gene pairs in fact represented one gene
that was split by stopcodon formation during frameshifting. Thus, each pair of proteins from this group were combined and included as one protein sequence in the
analyses. Stopcodons were left out of these combined
sequences.

sixty-four PPE proteins were done using ClustalW 1.8 on
the WWW server at the European Bioinformatics Institute
website [86,87]. The alignments were manually checked
for errors and refined where appropriate. Subsequent
alignments using the complete sequences (containing
both conserved N- and polymorphic C-terminal regions)
were done to confirm results obtained with only conserved N-termini.
Phylogenetic trees
Phylogenetic analyses were done using the neighbor-joining algorithm in the program PAUP 4.0b10 [89], and
1000 subsets were generated for Bootstrapping resampling of the data. Confidence intervals for the internal
topology of the trees were obtained from the resampling
analyses and only nodes occurring in over 50% of the
trees were assumed to be significant [90]. All branches
with a zero branch length were collapsed. Based on the
evolutionary order defined for the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters [1] and the results from the analysis of the genome
sequence of M. smegmatis, we have used the ancestral PE
and PPE genes present within ESAT-6 (esx) gene cluster
region 1 (Rv3872/PE35 and Rv3873/PPE68, respectively)
as the outgroups to assign as roots. The consensus trees of
the above were calculated using the majority rule formula
and were drawn using the program Treeview 1.5 [91].
Comparative genomics for extent of sequence variation
To determine the extent of PE and PPE sequence variation
and elucidate the differences between orthologues of subfamilies of these gene families in the genomes of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and CDC1551, a complete comparative
analysis of the presence and absence of genes, gene sizes,
frameshifts, insertions and deletions (indels), alternative
start sites, protein mismatches and conservative substitutions was done.
Primers and probes
The primers used to generate probes for Southern hybridization to genomic DNA are listed in Table 5. PPE-MPTR
and mycP probes were generated using the selected primers to individually PCR amplify regions from the PPEMPTR genes Rv1917c (PPE34) and Rv1753c (PPE24), as
well as from the mycosin gene mycP5 (Rv1796).
Southern hybridization
Genomic DNA was isolated from different mycobacterial
species (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), see Table 6) as previously described [92].
Genomic DNA was digested with AluI or BstEII, electrophoretically fractionated, Southern transferred and
hybridized as previously described [93]. Probing of
Southern blots was done using selected ECL-labeled
probes as listed in Table 5.
