Abstract
Background: Microarrays have recently emerged as a novel procedure to evaluate the genetic
content of bacterial species. So far, microarrays have mostly covered single or few strains from the
same species. However, with cheaper high-throughput sequencing techniques emerging, multiple
strains of the same species are rapidly becoming available, allowing for the definition and
characterization of a whole species as a population of genomes - the 'pan-genome'.
Results: Using 32 Escherichia coli and Shigella genome sequences we estimate the pan- and core
genome of the species. We designed a high-density microarray in order to provide a tool for
characterization of the E. coli pan-genome. Technical performance of this pan-genome microarray
based on control strain samples (E. coli K-12 and O157:H7) demonstrated a high sensitivity and
relatively low false positive rate. A single-channel analysis approach is robust while allowing the
possibility for deriving presence/absence predictions for any gene included on our pan-genome
microarray. Moreover, the array was highly sufficient to investigate the gene content of nonpathogenic isolates, despite the strong bias towards pathogenic E. coli strains that have been
sequenced so far.
Conclusion: This high-density microarray provides an excellent tool for characterizing the genetic
makeup of unknown E. coli strains and can also deliver insights into phylogenetic relationships. Its
design poses a considerably larger challenge and involves different considerations than the design
of single strain microarrays. Here, lessons learned and future directions will be discussed in order
to optimize design of microarrays targeting entire pan-genomes.

Background

Bacterial isolates are traditionally classified into species by
bacteriological methods, and subtyped within the species by
phenotypic or genotypic characterization. For the identification and subtyping of Escherichia coli isolates, a wide variety
of typing methods have been developed. A recent addition to
this spectrum is array comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) [1]. Thus, microarray hybridization is becoming a
standard procedure to evaluate the genetic content of a bacterial species. For E. coli, a microarray covering the gene
content of seven strains was recently developed for the characterization of emerging pathogens [2]. However, since then,
many additional E. coli strains and plasmids have been
sequenced, and the total number of genes potentially present
in E. coli strains, the so-called 'pan-genome' [3,4], increases
with each new E. coli genome sequenced. A microarray chip
approximating the complete pan-genome of E. coli would
provide optimal sensitivity to characterize isolates. Here, we
present a novel design of a microarray covering the complete
currently known genome content of 32 sequenced genomes.
Such a pan-genome microarray can be used for more precise
characterization of novel strains, including emerging pathogens, and can also deliver insights into phylogenetic
relationships.
Phylogenetic relationships are commonly determined by bacterial subtyping. Due to the complex sexual behavior of bacteria, phylogenetic trees obtained with individual genes often
do not correspond to each other. Although multilocus
sequence typing is now regarded by many as a good standard
to determine phylogenetic relationships between and within
bacterial species, it does not always reflect the true genetic
diversity of members of a species; trees based on multilocus
sequence typing may, therefore, differ significantly from a
tree based on whole gene content [3]. A pan-genome microarray may offer a suitable alternative to complete genome
sequencing for extracting the necessary gene content to construct a realistic phylogenetic tree based on conserved gene
content. The recent technological development in sequencing
and the consequent price drop have led to an explosion of
available genome sequences and perhaps within a few years
will lead to sequencing being a faster and cost effective alternative to CGH microarray analysis. However, at the moment,
sequencing is still more costly and less time efficient than
hybridization experiments, while hybridization experiments
potentially also can provide information regarding gene
expression.
Here, we determine an approximate E. coli pan-genome,
based on 24 E. coli and 8 Shigella genomes available at the
time of analysis (November 2006). The inclusion of Shigella
genomes was justified as the genus division between Shigella
and Escherichia is historical but taxonomically incorrect
[5,6]. For simplicity, the Shigella and E. coli genomes are collectively referred to as E. coli. From these genomes we construct an E. coli pan-genome microarray. The technical

performance of this pan-genome microarray is assessed by
the correct identification of present and absent genes from
the completely sequenced genome of the MG1655 isolate of E.
coli strain K-12 (hereafter referred to as MG1655) and strain
O157:H7 EDL933 (EDL933 for short), collectively referred to
as the control strains. Pathogenic E. coli isolates are highly
overrepresented in the available genome sequences and,
hence, on our pan-genome chip. We assessed whether this
chip could nevertheless be useful for characterization of nonpathogenic isolates by hybridizing four probiotic E. coli isolates to the chip. These isolates are part of a commercially
available product (Symbioflor2) marketed for human use as
an enhancer of the immune system. The product contains viable bacteria comprising at least four genotypes of commensal
E. coli. By characterizing their gene content, we investigated
the phylogenetic relationship of these isolates to other E. coli
strains.

Results
Defining the E. coli core-genome and pan-genome
For each of the considered genome and plasmid sequences
listed in Table 1, genes were predicted by EasyGene [7,8] and
translated into proteins. These were considered conserved
(belonging to the same protein gene group) if they showed a
sequence similarity of 50% or higher along at least 50% of the
full length of the protein sequence according to the similarity
criteria defined in [3] (see Materials and methods for details).
The core genome, that is, the number of conserved genes
present in all genomes, was estimated by fitting an exponential decay function by non-linear least squares (Figure 1). In
short, for each number of genomes (n), the gene content was
compared for multiple random combinations of n genomes
after which a best fit decay curve was fitted. Two slightly different decay functions were used: the originally suggested
decay function based on [3] (Figure 1, green line) did not fit
the data as well as a slightly modified exponential decay function (Figure 1, red line) (see Materials and methods for details
on the applied modifications). Based on the best-fitting
extrapolation, we estimate the size of the core genome to
approach approximately 1,563 genes for an infinite (or very
large) number of E. coli genomes.
We next estimated how many additional 'strain-specific'
genes would be added to the core genome with each genome
being sequenced. In this case the decay function defined by
[3] was found to be appropriate, as shown in Figure 2. By fitting the data to the number of sequenced genomes approaching infinity, we predict that additional genomes will continue
to add approximately 79 genes to the E. coli pan-genome, on
average. Exploiting the fitted parameters for the data set, the
size of the current E. coli core genome conserved within the
32 strains included in this study was estimated to contain
2,241 common genes. The estimated size of the current pangenome was estimated to contain 9,433 different genes. The
number of E. coli strains used for these estimates is approxi-

Figure 1
Two-dimensional density plot of 'core genes' for the E. coli pan-genome. The plot illustrates the number of E. coli core genes for n = 2,...,32 genomes based
on a maximum of 3,200 random combinations of genomes for each n. The density colors reflect the count of combinations giving rise to a certain number
of core genes; that is, for n = 3, genome number 3 is compared to genomes 1 and 2, and the number of core genes is the number of genome 3 genes
conserved in genomes 1 and 2. The green line is the fit to the exponential decay function by [3], and the red line is our proposed fit to a slightly modified
decay function as explained in the Materials and methods.

mately the same as the number of strains present in the
human gut [9,10]; thus, the number of E. coli genes in the
human gut is roughly a third of the number of human genes.
In designing the E. coli pan-genome microarray, genes were
grouped based on their nucleotide sequences since the probes
are based on DNA oligonucleotides. Moreover, the parameters to group genes for similarity were adapted compared to
the parameters used for protein similarity to define the core
and pan-genome in order to improve differentiation between
the nucleotide sequences of similar E. coli genes found in different strains. For this purposes the '50% sequence similarity
of 50% of the sequence' conservation criteria [3] was found to
be sub-optimal. Instead, genes were grouped into gene
groups with a slightly different and somewhat stricter homology criteria (see Materials and methods for details), producing a higher number of groupings. This resulted in a total of
11,872 gene groups present in all 32 genomes, compared to
the smaller pan-genome of 9,433 gene groups resulting from
comparison at the protein sequence level. Of the 11,872 gene
groups, 2,041 consisted of genes found in all 32 strains. Thus,
the stricter grouping criteria applied here produced a lower

number than the currently estimated core genome size of
2,241 protein gene groups for 32 E. coli genomes.
In the presented design strategy, the inclusion of 32 E. coli
strains in the microarray design necessitated the employment
of a common standardized gene prediction strategy since
some of the genomic sequences had poor or non-existing gene
annotations. One option is to either include as many open
reading frames as possible as potential genes (in a 'more is
better' strategy) or, alternatively, to use EasyGene, a well performing and conservative gene predictor. One can argue that
a 'more is better' strategy is preferred to the conservative gene
prediction so that fewer genes would be missed. However,
including spurious hypothetical genes in the design would
potentially obstruct the probe design phase both in the grouping of gene families and in excluding otherwise perfect probes
due to cross-hybridization to these false genes. Furthermore,
in case of prediction of gene content in control and novel
strains by hybridizing genomic DNA to the array, such false
positives are just as unwelcome as false negatives. Nonetheless, absence of too many important E. coli genes is not desirable either. We therefore compared the genes predicted by

of combinations giving rise to a certain number of specific genes (y-axis) in one genome compared to n - 1 other genomes; that is, for n = 2, genome
number 2 is compared to genome number 1 and, on average, approximately 650 genes are found to be specific to strain 2. The blue line is the fit to the
originally suggested exponential decay function [3].

EasyGene with the high-quality annotation of the K-12
MG1655 strain (version U00096.3). This revealed that of the
238 protein encoding genes not predicted by EasyGene, 206
were hypothetical genes, leader peptides, frameshifts, gene
fragments or pseudogenes. Of the remaining 32 genes, 12
were present in at least one other E. coli strain considered in
the design. Consequently, only 20 genes of potential interest
were missed by EasyGene. Since this is less than half a percent of the genome (20/4,331 = 0.46%), we considered that
the advantages of conservative standardized gene finding
outweighed the disadvantages of missing a small minority of
genes.

Benchmarking the chip design
A pan-genomic approach represents a challenge in evaluating
and defining the trade-off in group inclusion stringency: a
similarity cut-off chosen too high will result in too many
groups, while a low similarity cut-off results in too much
sequence variability within a group (producing low conservation scores). Consequently, too much sequence variability
within groups will result in group-specific probes producing
too low a signal for that group in particular strains. On the

other hand, dividing the groups further to limit this undesired
inter-group variability causes another problem: some probes
may no longer be group specific, leading to undesired crosshybridization, while other probes might still provide a signal
specific for such a group. In the attempt to circumvent these
problems, an additional filter step was introduced in the
probe design strategy, where probes were removed from further analysis if they were not specific enough to one group and
if they did not share a sequence overlap above a certain
threshold with the sequences in the group it was designed for
(for details refer to Materials and methods). Figure 3a gives
an example of how such probes may result in misleading signals, while the signal improves remarkably following
exclusion of such probes from the analysis by a filtering step
(Figure 3b).
The chip design was assessed by analyzing and comparing the
hybridization data from the two sequenced control strains,
EDL933 and MG1655. Both log2 intensities and log2 ratios
were considered. These results are visualized in a hybridization atlas (Figure 4). Here, the median log2 intensity and log2
ratios of both control strains are illustrated for MG1655

Density plots of probe intensities before and after a filtering step. The density distributions are illustrated for MG1655 probes and non-MG1655 probes
separately. Log2 intensity data are from a representative MG1655 control sample. (a) Before filtering, all probes are divided into MG1655 probes (green
lines) and non-MG1655 probes (red lines). It is clear that many probes initially designed for groups containing MG1655 genes do not hybridize well to
these, resulting in low intensity (green arrow). Conversely, probes initially designed for groups without MG1655 genes cross-hybridize as if present in
MG1655 (red arrow). (b) After filtering probes, the remaining probes have the expected hybridization profile.

probes, as well as probe coverage for this strain and the
sequence similarity at the DNA level of EDL933 genes to
MG1655 genes based on BLAST scores. The similarity of the
MG1655 probe hybridization pattern for EDL933 to the
sequence similarity based on BLAST scores confirms that the
probes reflect true biology. The same information is illustrated in the ratio circle (fourth outermost circle), where
MG1655 regions absent in the EDL933 genome are clearly
visible and correspond to the regions missing in the EDL933
sample (first and second outermost circle). On the contrary,
the MG1655 hybridization pattern (third outermost circle)
corresponds very well to the probe coverage pattern (innermost circle).
For further analysis, the probes were mapped to each gene
group according to the design, and a position-dependent segmentation algorithm was employed to partition data points
into present and absent sequence segments [11]. Segmentation was followed by merging the output with MergeLevels
[12]. Since the distribution of log2 intensities is bimodal - that
is, composed of two density distributions (Figure 5a) - it is
likely that the best separation of present and absent probes
can be found at the local minimum between the two distributions. Consequently, following noise reduction by segmentation and merging, the cutoff for log2 intensities was found at
the merged value between these two distribution maxima
with the least segments assigned to it. All segments with

merged values above this cutoff were predicted as present. On
the other hand, the distribution of log2 ratios is largely unimodal (although two extra, weaker modals occur) (Figure 5b).
Since ratios are only calculated for genes present in the control sample, and given the likely high similarity between a test
sample and control sample of the same species, most genes
are assumed present. Consequently, here the present level
was estimated as the merged level to which most segments
had been assigned.
Following the filtering step, several gene groups were left with
only few probes targeting them, and we found it necessary to
remove groups that were targeted by three or fewer probes
from further analysis. This reduced the average number of
false positives from 267 to 87 (for MG1655) and from 638 to
405 when analyzing all control samples with regard to genes
found to be present from analysis of log2 hybridization signals
compared to genes predicted present from the genome
sequence. On the other hand, gene groups represented by few
probes were not as likely to result in false negatives since
removal of these groups did not change the average number
of false negatives significantly (data not shown).
Table 2 lists the resulting sensitivity and false discovery rate
(FDR) for all control samples. A very high sensitivity was
obtained for both strains, but false positives were suspiciously
high for EDL933 (Table 2). For both control strains, a large

proportion of the false positive gene groups were consistently
identified in replicate samples (a total of 62 and 360 in
MG1655 and EDL933, respectively). For MG1655, genes
annotated as hypothetical were highly overrepresented
among the false positive genes (P value approximately 0.002,
Fischer's exact test), indicating a significant enrichment in
hypothetical genes among false positives. In the majority of
cases, the corresponding consensus sequences aligned very

well to the genome sequence (with >50% of the sequence
length and >91% identity). Consequently, these false positives
are not a result of cross-hybridizations but rather a result of
genes not predicted by the EasyGene gene finder. Since most
of these are seemingly hypothetical and, therefore, are likely
not to be real genes, the consequences in terms of strain characterization are considered to be minor.

Genome Biology 2007,

In contrast to the MG1655 control strain, we did not observe
enrichment in hypothetical genes among false positives for
EDL933. In this case we suspect that the 'false positives'
were actually true genes mistakenly missed by EasyGene. In
support of this, EasyGene did actually predict only 4,664
genes for the EDL933 main chromosome compared to the
5,349 annotated in GenBank, possibly due to a number of
unknown nucleotides still present in the published genome
sequence [13]. Gene expression profiling of these genes
would confirm if these are in fact true genes that are
expressed and thus incorrectly missed by EasyGene. Preliminary data from a gene expression study run in parallel with
this work demonstrated that the gene expression profile of
these genes indeed resembled that of other genes present in
the EDL933 genome (Sekse C, Friis C, Wasteson Y, Ussery
DW and Willenbrock H, unpublished results). This observation supports our interpretation that they are actually not
false positives generated by bad chip manufacturing,
hybridization artifacts or poor analysis approaches, but a
consequence of an ambiguous DNA sequence that any gene
predictor would have ignored. Ideally, they should have
been categorized as true positives. Consequently, the low
FDR obtained from the other control strain, MG1655, is a
better indicator of our pan-genome chip performance.
Table 3 compares the performance obtained by analyzing
log2 ratios of control sample co-hybridizations with the performance based on log2 intensities. In both cases, the sensitivity is quite high, while FDR is low, in particular for
MG1655. The higher FDR for EDL933 may be assigned to a
low accuracy for the gene predictor on this particular
genome, as discussed above. While the sensitivity is slightly
higher when analyzing log2 ratios, FDR is marginally lower
when analyzing log2 intensities. Consequently, the single
channel log2 intensity analysis approach offers an acceptable
performance compared to the comparative dual channel
approach, at a limited risk of increased false negatives but
with the added advantage of being able to identify the presence and absence of any gene on the microarray and not only
genes present in the control strain.

Analysis of probiotic E. coli strains
The chip design was next tested for suitability to characterize isolates of non-pathogenic E. coli strains. Four probiotic
isolates were co-hybridized with MG1655 and EDL933
according to the combinations listed in Table 4; their
hybridization pattern to MG1655 probes is illustrated in a
hybridization atlas (Figure 4). Here, larger regions absent
from the probiotic isolates in comparison to MG1655 are visible. It is also evident that each isolate is different from the
next, since each isolate has a distinct hybridization pattern.
The gene content of each probiotic isolate was predicted by
the single-channel approach as found to be appropriate for
this type of analysis. Thereby, the presence of all genes
included on the pan-genome array could be assessed for all
four test isolates. First, we compared the findings between
the isolates used for hybridization. The number of identified
genes was highest for G1/2 and lowest for G4/9 (Table 5).
Two graphical representations further illustrate the results.
Figure 6 shows a cluster analysis based on all probes considered in this paper. The four probiotic isolates cluster
individually and form a super-cluster with MG1655 samples,
separated from EDL933. Indeed, each isolate shared more
of their predicted genes with MG1665 than with EDL933
(Table 5). Moreover, strain-specific genes were more frequently different to EDL933 than to MG1655. This is not
surprising since the probiotic isolates are likely to be more
related to the non-pathogenic commensal K-12 than to
enterohemorrhagic EDL933. Each strain had more than 100
genes that were neither found in MG1655 nor EDL933
(Table 5). Moreover, a significant enrichment was observed
in hypothetical genes among the gene groups only found in
a single Symbioflor2 isolate. However, this is expected, since
E. coli core genes are generally better characterized than
genes found in only few E. coli strains. Figure 7 compares
the numbers of genes found to be either unique or shared
between one or more probiotic isolates in a Venn diagram. A
total of 3,093 genes were found consistently in all four isolates. Figure 6 and Figure 7 both identify isolate G1/2 as the
most distantly related to the other isolates.

The sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) were compared for data analysis based on log2 intensities and log2 ratios for the detection of genes in
the two control strains for which gene presence is known from gene finding based on the known genome sequence. Thus, only known control gene
groups were considered. Consequently, true positives make up the control genes correctly found to be present in all MG1655 or EDL933 samples,
respectively. False positives are genes not found in the control strain, but predicted as present from the genome sequence.

Next, genes detected in the probiotic isolates were compared
to the genes present (by gene prediction based on their
genome sequence) in each E. coli strain represented by the
chip. All four probiotic isolates shared the most genes with E.
coli H10407, closely followed by the two K-12 strains for three
of the isolates and the VR50 strain for G1/2 (refer to Table S1
in Additional data file 1 for a ranked list of the number of
shared genes with the strains considered for chip design).
While E. coli VR50 is an asymptomatic inhabitant of the urinary tract [14], E. coli H10407 is an enterotoxigenic strain.
However, its virulence is mostly encoded by plasmids that
have not yet been sequenced and, therefore, were not considered in this comparison. Nonetheless, by gene prediction
based on the genomic sequence of the H10407 main chromosome, we identified the presence of genes encoding
hemolysin (hlyCABD). These genes were present in probiotic
isolate G1/2 as well, in accordance with its weak hemolytic
phenotype (described as alpha hemolysis type II; L Beutin
and K Zimmermann, unpublished results). Presence of this
gene cluster is, however, not sufficient to characterize an

isolate as pathogenic [15-17]. Also, the main chromosome of
the H10407 strain has previously been found to be highly
homologous to E. coli K-12 in contrast to other E. coli pathogenic strains [18]. This indicates that in spite of the many
genes shared with a pathogenic E. coli strain, the probiotic
isolates are likely to share only the non-virulent parts.
Besides, the probiotic isolate shares only marginally more
genes with the H10407 strain than with the two K-12 strains
(16-57 genes). This is not significant, especially since novel
strains are much more likely to share more genes with the
large H10407 genome than with the smaller K-12 genomes
without actually resembling it more, simply because the
H10407 genome encodes 20% more genes. Supporting this, a
cluster analysis considering the presence and absence of all
gene groups analyzed from our pan-genome array (Figure 8)
clearly shows that the gene content of the probiotic isolates is,
in fact, more closely related to the gene content of other nonpathogenic strains. In this analysis, all probiotic isolates cluster together with the two K-12 strains while forming a supercluster with all the other non-pathogenic strains considered

in the analysis. This super-cluster contains only a few pathogenic strains for which the sequences of their virulence plasmids were not included in the analysis (strains 101-1,
E24377A, and H10407). Furthermore, the validity of the clustering is confirmed by the placement of the control strain
MG1655 closest to the two K-12 design strains, and EDL933
closest to the O157:H7 design strains.
Apart from the hemolysin genes and a gene annotated as
'putative iron-regulated outer membrane viruence gene', no
other virulence genes were detected in the probiotic isolates.
The observed genetic relatedness of probiotic strains to a virulent strain illustrates that both pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli strains use common strategies for adaptation to
their niche. Of the genes found to be present in the probiotic
isolates but not in a non-pathogenic E. coli strain (MG1655),
many were bacteriophage-derived. Nevertheless, complete
prophages were not present and variation between and within
phage gene content between the four probiotic isolates suggested these bacteriophages have been introduced in independent events. Transposases and other insertion sequencerelated genes provided further evidence of the influence of
mobile DNA on introducing genetic variation in a bacterial
population. Of interest were genes present in the probiotic
isolates but absent in MG1655 that were annotated as having
general metabolic functions. A closer analysis of these findings would be necessary to assess if such genes provide
improved fitness for colonization of the human gut, and so
could explain the probiotic nature of the isolates. Also, one

should keep in mind that the K-12 isolates represent a
reduced E. coli genome, and some essential metabolic genes
are known to be missing in these isolates. Complete lists of
annotated genes found in each of the four Symbioflor2 isolates but not in the MG1655 control strain is provided as

Discussion

The design of a microarray covering more than 30 genomes
proved to be a considerable challenge. Multiple aspects had to
be considered but the greatest difficulty was to filter out false
positives, at the risk of introducing additional false negatives.
The level of similarity between gene sequences should justify
conserved annotation, but the borders of significance are
diffuse and poorly defined. This is a consequence of biological
processes that undergo gradual genetic changes. On one
hand, probes should cover all versions of the same gene, but
at the same time they should be able to distinguish between
different genes and even, when relevant, distinct versions of
the same gene in different strains. In light of this, conventional microarray design strategies, such as inclusion of mismatch probes for background estimation, will not work when
dealing with multiple genomes. One can never ensure that a
perfect match is absent for such probes in novel strains.
Moreover, because the array should be able to interrogate for
the presence of genes at the DNA level (as presented in this
paper), the number of probes per gene should be allowed to
vary. A higher number of probes is required for a sufficient
coverage of long genes, whereas low quality probes would
result if attempting to design the same number of probes for
very short genes. Consequently, the challenge is to define, in
a sensible way, such goals and to search for the best possible
solution. Our pan-genome approach proved to be a suitable
solution.
Recently, the idea of an 'open pan-genome' was introduced,
where each newly sequenced strain would continue to add
novel genes to the pan-genome of the species. It was suggested that Streptococcus agalactiae would have an open
pan-genome, with the consequence that despite sequencing
hundreds of strains, novel genes would still be discovered [3].
E. coli is likely to also have an open pan-genome since it colonizes multiple environments, complex microflora biotopes,
and, therefore, has multiple ways and sources for exchanging
and obtaining genetic material [4]. In line with this expectation, Chen and co-workers [19] predicted that each new E. coli
genome would add 441 genes to the E. coli pan-genome pool.
However, this prediction of 'new genes' is possibly too high,
since it was based on seven very diverse E. coli genomes only.
Genome size differs considerably within the species, from the
relatively small K-12 strains to the larger pathogenic O157:H7
strains. Therefore, we believe that our estimate of the E. coli
pan-genome and the core genome is closer to what might be
expected in the 'real world', since it is based on a much larger
number and variety of strains. Thus, the number of added

new genes per genome has dropped to about 79 genes when
including data from 32 different strains, and may decrease
further with improved genome annotations. This smaller
estimate is in the same order of magnitude as predicted for
other pan-genomes, such as Streptococcus (27 per genome
for group A and 33 for group B) [3]. Still, our estimate for E.
coli may be too conservative if the true diversity of E. coli is
still insufficiently covered by the current genome sequences,
that is, environmental and non-mammalian strains are

under-represented, and the addition of these may initially
add a significant number of novel genes to the E. coli pangenome.
Furthermore, we were able to come up with a more accurate
prediction of the E. coli core genome. Previously, the size of
the E. coli core genome was assessed, based on seven different
E. coli strains, to consist of between 2,865 and 3,475 genes
[2,19]. Based on the 32 genomes included in this study, we

predict that the size of the core genome will approach approximately 1,560 essential genes, about half that of the previous
estimates. We believe the current estimate to be more accurate, as it is based on a much larger number of genomes. However, in the present study, several unfinished genome
sequences were included. Improving these both in terms of
sequencing and assembly and in gene annotation quality,
may result in an increased core genome size if the current
partly finished genome sequences are missing core genes.

Willenbrock et al. R267.13

To assess the performance of the chip as well as to identify the
best way of analyzing data from it, control sample hybridizations were analyzed. Comparative hybridizations on dual
channel microarrays have the advantage of reduced noise due
to limited variations of probe hybridization efficiencies. However, a dual channel analysis is limited to probes covering the
control sample so that noise reduction applies only to probes
hybridizing to genes present in the control sample. Although
the false positive rate was slightly higher for the single-channel analysis approach, we demonstrate that sensitivity is only
marginally lower than for the dual channel approach while
information can also be extracted regarding genes not present
in the control sample. Consequently, this analysis approach
offers a favorable possibility for deriving predictions for any
gene present on the pan-genome microarray.
Pathogenic E. coli genomes are highly overrepresented on
this pan-genome chip because the majority of the E. coli
genomes sequenced to date are from pathogenic strains, and
few originate from environmental sources or are commensal
strains. Nonetheless, we found that the chip was widely useful
for characterizing the gene content of non-pathogenic E. coli
isolates and for investigating the non-pathogenic nature of
these E. coli isolates.
Lessons learned from this microarray can be used to design
better arrays in the future. Although we considered all
designed probes for the chip, including probes with low specificity to all strains in a given gene group, based on our analysis of experimental results, we have found that a filtering
step is necessary to remove less specific probes. Moreover,
gene groups for which only few probes could be designed
(above the probe score cutoff) were not as reliable as gene
groups represented by a larger number of probes. While this
is not surprising, it nonetheless makes it a difficult task to
accurately probe for these genes.

Based on 32 E. coli and Shigella genome sequences, we have
developed an E. coli pan-genome microarray representing the
current pan-genome of E. coli. Although any individual E. coli
genome contains between 4,000 and 5,000 genes, we find
about twice as many distinct gene groups in the total gene
pool examined. High-density pan-genome microarrays can
be quite useful for characterizing either DNA content or gene
expression from unknown E. coli strains. Thus, we found the
technique highly sufficient to investigate gene content of four
non-pathogenic E. coli isolates despite the strong bias for
pathogenic strains represented on the pan-genome array. The
four analyzed probiotic E. coli isolates share a gene pool very
similar to the E. coli K-12 strains, and additional strain-specific genes were often phage genes, transposases, insertion
elements and metabolic genes. It remains to be seen to what
degree these genes contribute to the probiotic nature of the
isolates. Generally, we conclude that our high-density pan-

genome array provides an excellent tool for characterizing the
genetic makeup of unknown E. coli strains and can also
deliver insights into phylogenetic relationships.

Materials and methods

Twenty-four E. coli chromosome sequences that were publicly available at the time of analysis (as one or multiple contigs) and nine plasmid sequences belonging to seven of the
sequenced strains were included in this study. In addition,
eight Shigella chromosomes were included (two S. sonnei,
three S. flexneri, two S. dysenteriae and one S. boydii) with
their three corresponding plasmids (Table 1).

Probe and microarray design
All considered genome and plasmid sequences (Table 1) were
searched for genes using EasyGene version 1.0 or 1.2 [7,8] in
order to standardize gene finding. Genes were screened for
homology using BLAST [20] in order to prevent redundancy
of the probes. Genes were placed in a group when homologous by the following criteria: E-value <10-5, bitscore >55,
and alignment constituting 50% or more of the longer of the
two aligned sequences. Genes with no homology were represented as 'singles'. Groups of genes ('multiples') were aligned
using ClustalW with default settings [21] and a consensus
sequence was derived using the most frequent nucleotide at
each position, weighted by its background frequency in all
genes. The probe design strategy employed by OligoWiz [22]
was used for probe selection. Two additional scores were
introduced as parameters for the probe design software dealing with consensus sequences: a weighted conservation score
and a gap score. The weighted conservation score uses Shannon's information measure [23] for conservation at each
nucleotide position in a probe. According to [24], the influence of a mismatch on measured hybridization intensities
varies with its position, with positions towards either end
having less influence. Therefore, each position was weighted
according to a second order polynomial function. The probe's
weighted conservation score is the product of the weighted
position scores for mismatch basepairs. The gap score was
used to identify probes that targeted gaps in the alignment of
multiples. This score was used to design probes that specifically identified conserved regions of all genes in each group
(thus attempting to avoid gaps).
All probes were designed as 55-60 mers, with variable length
and sequence to optimize for the same melting temperature.
Only standard nucleotides (GATC) were considered in the
probe design. In total, 305,285 probes covering 11,768 gene

the microarray design may be found in Additional data file 3.

Filtering of probes
Probes were aligned against all predicted gene sequences
included using NCBI-BLAST blastn version 2.2.11 [25] and
the identity of each probe with each gene sequence was determined in base pairs. Sequences were extracted for which the
ratio [bp identity/probe length] was >0.8. Probes that either
matched more than one single group or failed to match all
genes in the design group were excluded from further analysis. Furthermore, groups for which three or less probes
remained after filtering were removed from the subsequent
analysis due to their increased risk of generating false
positives (see Results). This resulted in a reduction to
224,805 probes covering 9,252 gene groups and singles.
Consequently, the number of probes targeting each gene
ranged from 4 to 29 with a median coverage of 27 probes per
gene.

Annotation of gene groups
Each gene group in the probe design was annotated according
to the results from hits against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
release 52.5 and UniProtKB/TrEMBL release 35.5 protein
database [26] using NCBI-BLAST Blastp version 2.2.11 [25].
Only alignments covering >50% of the gene lengths and having 50% or better identity within the alignment were
included. Among all the sequences within each group, the hit
producing the highest percent identity was chosen. In this
way, 5,348 of our 11,872 gene groups could be annotated
against Swiss-Prot and 9,320 of our 11,872 gene groups could
be annotated against TrEMBL. Thus, while Swiss-Prot generally produces more reliable annotations, the number of annotations produced was quite low. Consequently, when
available, genes were assigned the more reliable Swiss-Prot
annotation, otherwise it was assigned the TrEMBL annotation if one was available. Gene groups that could not be
assigned an annotation were assigned hypothetical proteins.

Pan-genomics
The pan-genome was estimated as suggested by Tettelin et al.
[3], with modifications to reduce computational load for our
large dataset. Briefly, protein sequences were compared by
Blastp version 2.2.11 [25]. Proteins with at least 50%
sequence identity over at least 50% of their length were identified as the same. For each n additional genome, genome n
was compared to any combinations of n - 1 genomes, and the
number of identical 'core genes' and 'strain-specific genes'
(specific for strain n) were counted for each n. According to
the approach suggested, when all genomes are compared to n
other genomes (n = 1,..,N), this would result in 32!/[(n 1)!·(32 - n)!] possible combinations (for each n) of drawing n
genomes out of the pool of 32 genomes. Consequently, for 16
or 17 genomes (n = 17,18 in above formula), a total of 9.62 billion possible combinations exists. To reduce computational
time, we lowered the number of combinations by randomly
selecting 3,200 different combinations (or the maximum
number of combinations; 3,200 is dividable by 32, which
ensures that all genomes are used an equal number of times

as blast template for each n) with an equal distribution among
query genome. This was repeated ten times and an exponential decay function was fitted to each of these repeats. The
decay function suggested by Tettelin et al [3] was first
applied:

F (n ) = κ ⋅ e (

−n

τ)

+g

where g equals the number of 'core genes' or 'specific genes',
while κ and τ are free parameters for amplitude of exponential
decay. The speed at which F(n) converges was found to fit the
data for 'strain-specific genes' satisfactorily, while a modified
decay function with the double square root of n was found to
fit the 'core genes' data better (lower sum of squared errors):

F (n ) = κ ⋅ e

( − sqrt ( sqrt ( n )) τ )

Strain selection, DNA preparation and hybridization
Control strain K-12 MG1655 was kindly provided by Flemming G Hansen (CBS, BioCentrum-DTU, The Technical University of Denmark) and genomic DNA from control strain
O157:H7 EDL933 was kindly provided by Camilla Sekse (Norwegian Veterinary school, Oslo). As test strains, Kurt Zimmermann from Symbiopharm (Herborn, Germany) supplied
four probiotic E. coli isolates, designated G1/2, G3/10, G4/9
and G5, from their commercially available Symbioflor2 product. G1/2 has previously been serotyped as O rough:K-:Hand O rough:H-, G3/10 as O 35,129:K-:H-, G4/9 as O
rough:K-:H-, and G5 as O rough:K-:H-.
All test strains were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB)
broth with continuous agitation [27], and DNA was isolated
as described previously [28]. The genomic DNA was labeled
with cy3 or cy5 and hybridized to NimbleGen custom arrays
according to NimbleGen standard protocols for CGH (prepared and hybridized by NimbleGen (Madison, Wisconsin
USA)). The raw data are available from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database [29] with series accession number
GSE8595.

Analysis methods
The probes were mapped to each gene group including position according to the design and analyzed as described previously [2] with minor modifications. Briefly, a positiondependent segmentation algorithm was employed to partition data points into present and absent sequence segments
constituting any given gene. For this, we used circular binary
segmentation [11] with default settings as implemented in
DNAcopy developmental version 1.2.1 written for the R statistical language [30]. As recommended by the authors, the data
were first smoothed and subsequently segmented. Segmentation was followed by merging the output with MergeLevels
[12] with a fixed threshold at the standard deviation between
segmented log2 intensities and observed log2 intensities, or
the standard deviation of segmented log2 ratios.

Volume 8, Issue 12, Article R267

Willenbrock et al. R267.15

Consequently, following noise reduction by segmentation and
merging, the cutoff for log2 intensities was found at the
merged value between these two distribution maxima with
the least segments assigned to it. All segments with merged
values above this cutoff were predicted as present. Since
ratios are calculated only for genes present in the control
sample, and given the likely high similarity between a test
sample and control sample of the same species, most genes
are assumed present. Consequently, here the present level
was estimated as the merged level to which most segments
had been assigned. Moreover, for a gene to be called present,
at least 90% of its probes should be found to be present.
Accordingly, the samples were both analyzed individually as
log2 intensities and combined with the appropriate control
experiment, as log2 ratios.
Atlases were created using the GeneWiz software [31]. The
blast atlases were constructed as described previously [32].
