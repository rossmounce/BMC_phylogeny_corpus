Fusarium graminearum by comparing four
Fusarium genomes

Abstract
Background: Fusarium graminearum (Fg), a major fungal pathogen of cultivated cereals, is responsible for billions
of dollars in agriculture losses. There is a growing interest in understanding the transcriptional regulation of this
organism, especially the regulation of genes underlying its pathogenicity. The generation of whole genome
sequence assemblies for Fg and three closely related Fusarium species provides a unique opportunity for such a
study.
Results: Applying comparative genomics approaches, we developed a computational pipeline to systematically
discover evolutionarily conserved regulatory motifs in the promoter, downstream and the intronic regions of Fg
genes, based on the multiple alignments of sequenced Fusarium genomes. Using this method, we discovered 73
candidate regulatory motifs in the promoter regions. Nearly 30% of these motifs are highly enriched in promoter
regions of Fg genes that are associated with a specific functional category. Through comparison to Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Sc) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp), we observed conservation of transcription factors (TFs), their
binding sites and the target genes regulated by these TFs related to pathways known to respond to stress
conditions or phosphate metabolism. In addition, this study revealed 69 and 39 conserved motifs in the
downstream regions and the intronic regions, respectively, of Fg genes. The top intronic motif is the splice donor
site. For the downstream regions, we noticed an intriguing absence of the mammalian and Sc poly-adenylation
signals among the list of conserved motifs.
Conclusion: This study provides the first comprehensive list of candidate regulatory motifs in Fg, and underscores
the power of comparative genomics in revealing functional elements among related genomes. The conservation of
regulatory pathways among the Fusarium genomes and the two yeast species reveals their functional significance,
and provides new insights in their evolutionary importance among Ascomycete fungi.

Background
Collectively, fungal species within the genus Fusarium
are among the most important group of plant pathogens, causing disease in nearly every agriculturally cultivated plant [1]. Mycotoxins produced by Fusarium
species also pose a significant hazard to food safety and
human health [2,3]. The economic and scientific importance of these fungi has led to whole genome sequencing and functional studies of multiple economically
important and phylogenetically related Fusarium species

including, F. graminearum (Fg), F. verticillioides (Fv),
F. oxysporum (Fo), and F. solani [4-8]. Such rich genomic resources enable the discovery of many biological
features related to the genetic mechanisms of organism
adaptation and pathogenicity for these species [9-11].
As functional elements, transcription factor binding
sites often evolve at a much slower rate than neutral
sequences, and therefore they often stand out from the
surrounding sequences by virtue of their greater levels
of conservation. This property enables the recognition
of these conserved elements through comparative genomics. Previous work has demonstrated the power of
comparative genomics for discovering novel regulatory
motifs in yeasts [12], Plasmodium [13], flies [14],

mosquitoes [15] and mammals [16-18]. Even though
there is growing body of knowledge about pathogenicity
related gene regulation in the Fg genome, including
spore germination [10] and adaptation to the host environment [11], very little is known about the transcription
factors involved in the process and the regulatory
elements targeted by these transcription factors. Comparative Fusarium genomics enables the generation of
large-scale unambiguous alignments [8] among the four
sequenced Fusarium genomes. The total divergence
among these four genomes, measured by the total
branch length of the tree connecting the four species is
0.35 (i.e. 0.35 substitutions per base, roughly the distance between human and dog). This distance is similar
to that used successfully for identifying regulatory elements in other species [12,18].
Here we describe a comparative genomics approach to
systematically discover potential regulatory elements
based on the sequence conservation of the non-coding
regions among four sequenced Fusarium genomes
(Figure 1). The results were supported by several lines
of evidence, including: 1) co-regulation of subsets of
genes that share the common regulatory elements in the
promoter regions based on microarray expression data;
2) conservation of some of the potential transcription
factor (TF) binding sites, the TFs themselves and the
target genes regulated by these TFs compared to transcriptional regulatory networks described in the two
model systems, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and

Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp); and 3) identification
of a splice donor site as the top intronic motif. As the
first systematic survey of potential regulatory elements
in Fusarium species, our study revealed that the most
conserved regulatory elements from both upstream and
intronic regions span distantly related fungal species,
indicating that these elements are under strong functional constraint by negative selection and confirming
that many discovered motifs likely have an essential biological function.

Results
Motif discovery by comparing four Fusarium genomes
Alignment

The whole-genome alignments of the four Fusarium species were generated using PatternHunter (see Methods)
and further divided into three functionally distinct genomic regions - promoters, downstream, and introns. The
gene annotation of Fg, the first sequenced [5] and betterannotated [6]Fusarium genome, was used as a reference.
Because most of the Fg genes are computationally predicted and thus do not have well-defined transcriptional
start or stop sites, we defined the promoter region to be
up to 600 bp upstream of the translation start site (ATG)
and not overlapping its neighboring gene. We chose 600
bp based on the mean intergenic distance of ~1200 bp in
Fg. Similarly, we defined the downstream region of a
gene to be up to 600 bp downstream of the stop codon
without overlapping any other genes or potential promoter regions. Based on this definition, the downstream
regions could be enriched for 3’UTR sequences, for
which little is known in Fusarium genomes. To avoid
redundancy, we further post-processed the promoter and
downstream datasets to make sure that each genomic
region is represented only once. Overall, the promoter
data set contains 3.4 million aligned bases, whereas the
intronic and downstream sets contain 1.3 and 2.3 million
aligned bases respectively. Some segments could not be
aligned in all four species, primarily because they represent new sequences recently inserted into the Fg genome,
ancestral sequences deleted in one of the other species,
or missing sequences in one of the draft genomes.
Motif discovery

Figure 1 Overview of the computational pipeline used for
motif discovery.

A score metric called Motif Conservation Score (MCS)
[18] was used to evaluate the conservation properties of
all 7-mer motifs within each of these three datasets (see
Methods and Additional file 1). We focused our initial
efforts on 7-mers because most regulatory motifs are in
the range of 6-10 bps, with 6-mers tending to give too
many random matches, whereas 8 or higher-mers too
few (Note also that 7-mers are only used for initial
screening; the exact lengths of the motifs are actually
determined later when we introduce degeneracy to
motifs). For each dataset, we exhaustively searched for

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/208

the presence of 7-mers and obtained two values for each
of them (i) the total occurrences in the reference genome Fg (N), and (ii) the number of occurrences that are
conserved among all four genomes in the aligned
regions (k). We called a motif occurrence conserved if
the identical heptamer in the aligned regions occurs
within a window of -5 bp to +5 bp compared to the
reference position. The 5 bp extension at each side was
introduced to account for potential errors in local
sequence alignments. We next evaluated the MCS value
for each heptamer, which essentially represents the difference in conservation of a heptamer from the expected
conservation of a random heptamer (see Methods). For
instance, the 7-mer CACGTGA occurred N = 264 times
in the Fg genome of the promoter dataset. Among the
264 sites in Fg, k = 151 are also conserved in the corresponding orthologous regions of the three other species,
corresponding to a conservation rate (C.R.) of 57%. By
contrast the conservation rate for a random 7-mer in
the promoter dataset is only p0 = 3%, which indicates
that the CACGTGA motif shows a 19 fold enrichment
in conservation rate, corresponding to an MCS = (kNp0)/sqrt(Np0(1-p0)) = 51 s.d.
The distribution of the MCS values in each region is
biased towards positive values (Figure 2 and Additional
file 1, Figure S1), indicating that many heptamers are
more conserved than would be expected from a completely random case. The lowest MCS value of a heptamer
is -4.4, -4.1 and -2.4 in the promoters, downstream
regions and introns respectively. We selected the absolute value of the lowest score in the promoters as the
threshold to select over-conserved and thus potential
regulatory motifs in all regions. If the sequences in the
alignment evolved neutrally, the MCS scores would be
symmetric and centered at zero. Thus, we would expect
to see no heptamers with MCS values higher than the
selected threshold for each region. In contrast, the selection step yielded 688 heptamers in the promoter region,
326 heptamers in the downstream region and 234 heptamers in the intronic region, corresponding to 4%, 2%
and 1.4% of all heptamers in three regions respectively.
We noticed that the heptamers identified from each
region are largely non-overlapping with only 50 heptamers shared by all three regions (Additional file 1, Figure S2), suggesting that the identified motifs are mostly
region-specific. The 50 shared heptamers likely result
from partial overlap of functional regions due to incorrect annotation of a subset of genes, true signals shared
by all three regions, or simply random matches.
Adding Degeneracy

Regulatory motifs typically contain certain variations
without greatly affecting the overall binding affinity, as
many of the selected heptamers are slight variations of
each other. Therefore, we sought to identify the true

Page 3 of 13

motifs associated with the discovered heptamers by
introducing degeneracy into certain positions of the
heptamers. If the motif, after introducing the degeneracy, is a closer representation of a regulatory element,
the MCS score of the modified motif should be higher.
Therefore, we developed a greedy algorithm to systematically search for the pattern of degeneracy that can lead
to an increase in the MCS score of the modified motifs
(see methods and Additional file 1). Briefly, the program
randomly selected a base position in the heptamer and
added a degenerate character that is consistent with the
nucleotide at that position. If this change increased the
MCS in the updated motif, we repeated this process for
one more base position. As this greedy approach is susceptible to local maxima, we repeated it ten times and
selected the degenerate motif with the highest MCS
from all the trials. We used this approach on the heptamers in the decreasing order of their MCS values and
ignored a heptamer if it could be specified by one of the
degenerate motif derived from earlier heptamers. This
step finally gave 326 motifs in the promoter regions, 206
in the downstream and 114 in the intronic regions.
Some of the heptamers were able to increase their score
by as much as 300%. ACGCGTC in promoters, for
example, increased its MCS from an original value of
14.3 to 40.6 as it degenerated into nCGCGnC (‘n’ represents any nucleotide). The complete list of degenerate
motifs is available from our project website http://www.
broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/
SupplementalMaterials.html.
The MCS score measures the conservation across all
sites of a motif; therefore it should not be very sensitive
to the specific definition of promoters we used as long
as the distribution of the motif in the promoters is not
biased toward long distances. To illustrate this, we generated two additional promoter datasets using the distance of 400 bp and 1000 bp respectively for the motif
discovery. For the 400 bp dataset, we discovered 288
motifs (prior to clustering), of which 286 are present in
the 326 motifs discovered in the 600 bp dataset. For the
1000 bp dataset, we discovered 394 motifs, which
include all of the 326 motifs discovered in the 600 bp
dataset. For these 394 motifs, more than 80% of all the
sites are located within 600 bp from gene starts with the
highest density located at 70 bp from gene starts (Additional file 1, Figure S3). This suggests that the 600 bp is
a reasonable choice for the definition of promoter
regions, although we note that distant motifs preferentially located far away from gene start sites are likely to
be missed with this definition.
Clustering

The degenerate motifs, thus derived, were still redundant. Our next approach to more accurately predict
potential regulatory elements was to further cluster

degenerate motifs using the Pearson correlation as a
similarity measure for each pair of motifs (see Additional file 1). The Pearson correlation computes the
sequence similarity between the equivalent position
weight matrices [19] and quantifies it with a score from
-1 to +1; with +1 for identical motifs. We grouped
motifs in the same cluster if they were at least 0.75 correlated with the highest MCS motif in the cluster. From
this final stage of our computational pipeline, we

identified 73 clusters in promoters, 69 in the downstream and 39 clusters in the intronic region. Each cluster is represented by the highest scoring motif within
that cluster. The list of candidate motifs from each cluster is shown in Table 1 and Additional file 1, Table S1.
Association with functional gene clusters

Since very little is known about the constituents of regulatory pathways in Fusarium species, we searched for

Each motif shown here is the representative motif (i.e. the one with highest MCS score) from each cluster. N and k respectively represent the number of total
occurrences in F.g. and the number of occurrences conserved in all four Fusarium genomes. C.R. is the conservation rate of the motif (= k/N) and MCS is the
motif conservation score. * The promoter enrichment statistics is for the motif with the highest enrichment score (10th column) within each cluster shown in the
1st column. The names of the functional categories are derived from the GO annotation of F. g. The number associated with each category represents the cluster
as identified by the k-means clustering on the expression data within each category. Enrichment score is in the unit of -log10(p-value).

potential associations of promoter motifs with specific
gene functions using a combination of Gene Ontology
(GO) annotation [20] and expression profiles [10]. For
each motif, we searched for the set of genes that contain
the motif or its reverse pair in its promoter region. Each
gene set associated with particular promoter motif is
divided into GO category group per their cellular functions. Genes within each GO category group were
further sub-grouped into clusters of genes with similar
expression profiles using K-means clustering of previously published expression data for conidial germination [10]. Gene expression was measured in fresh
conidia (0 h) and at three other developmental

milestones: spore swelling (2 h), germ tube emergence
and elongation (8 h) and hyphal branching (24 h).
The GO cellular annotation provides a total 21 functional categories over 13332 Fg genes. Each category
was further divided into 2 to 5 clusters within each GO
category through K-means analysis and resulted in a
total of 68 sub-clusters (Called FunGroup). A functional
survey for each cluster was carried out using MIPS FunCat (5, 6). Gene lists, expression profiles and functional
analysis for each cluster can be found on our project
website shown above.
Even though, only limited expression data was used
for this analysis, the resulting clusters reflect the

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/208

functional association expected during spore germination. For example, cytoskeleton cluster 1 is enriched for
genes involved in budding, cell polarity and filament formation (MIPS category 43.01.03.05; P = 5.85E-21), such
as actin and microtubule cytoskeleton genes necessary
for polarized growth in filamentous fungi [21]. As
expected, genes belonging to this cluster are up-regulated between 2 h and 8 h, following the switch to polar
growth and germ tube emergence. Even though the
FunGroups resulting from this analysis only capture
part of the transcriptome, their significant association
confirmed the potential functionality of the promoter
motifs discovered by our computational pipeline. The
significance of enrichment for motif containing genes
within each FunGroup was quantified using the hypergeometric distribution (see methods). Even though the
promoter motifs are clustered based on sequence similarity, we tested each motif individually within all the 68
genes subgroups to increase specificity, knowing that a
single base difference may produce slightly different target gene set. At P-value < 10-3, 40 motif clusters had at
least one motif that is significantly enriched. At P-value
< 10-5, 22 motif clusters (30%) showed strong enrichment (Figure 3). Notable examples include the palindrome motif M2 (CACGTG), strongly enriched in the
second expression cluster of the Cellular Ribosome GO
category, and the M29 motif (CCTCGGY), highly
enriched in the second expression cluster of the Cellular
Peroxisome category. Some motifs, like M1, M19 and
M21, are enriched in multiple functional categories, suggesting their essential roles in gene regulation.
We further tested the significance of the enrichment
between the promoter motifs and FunGroups through a
control experiment, in which we generated a set of control motifs by randomly permuting the bases within
each discovered promoter motif. The enrichment analysis on the control motifs resulted in only two enriched
clusters (2%) (P-value < 10-5), much less than 22 as for
the discovered motifs (30%). This test may suggest that
the false discovery rate is below 9%, (P value < 10 -5 ),
and the enrichment of the motif containing genes within
FunGroups are likely due to biologically bona fide
associations.
Association with known transcriptional pathways

Furthermore, we are interested in understanding specific
functions and potential regulatory pathways associated
with the identified promoter motifs in Fg by comparing
the motif and motif containing genes to known TF binding sites and their target genes. We have focused such
comparison with two yeast systems Sc and Sp, and
extended this to other known ascomycete fungal TFs.
Based on the motif comparison [22] (see Additional file
1), we found 16 (21%) discovered motifs at E-value < 10-7

Page 6 of 13

Figure 3 Enrichment of promoter motifs in functional gene
clusters. Many of the discovered motifs are enriched in the
upstream regions of genes grouped on the basis of GO annotation
and expression profiles. This enrichment is quantified by a P-value
derived using hyper-geometric distribution (see methods). The

(Figure 4) or about half of the motifs at, E-value < 10-5
share sequence similarity to the binding sites reported in
S. cerevisiae (Sc) [23]. If the sequence conservation truly
reflects the functional association of these motifs, we
were interested in determining whether these motifs are
regulated by orthologous TFs and whether the target
genes also are conserved in these distantly related fungal
species.
Phosphate metabolism

The most significant match between Fg motifs and the
Sc TF binding site is the motif M2 (CACGTG), which
has the second highest MSC score in our list and
matches the Pho4 motif in Sc. Pho4 is a basic helixloop-helix (bHLH) TF that functions during phosphate

(Pi) starvation [24]. In high phosphate growth conditions Pho4 is phosphorylated and present only in the
cytoplasm. Under phosphate starvation, dephosphorylated Pho4 enters the nucleus and activates pho genes
involved in response to phosphate starvation [25].
There is a Pho4 ortholog in each Fusarium genome
(FGSG_00545, FOXG_00510, JGI_32105, and
FVEG_01003). More than 60% of the Pho4 interacting
genes in Sc [26] have a homologous gene in Fg (BLAST
1e-5) and the potential binding site M2 is significantly
enriched among this set of genes (Figure 5). As demonstrated for both Neurospora crassa (Nuc1) [27] and
Aspergillus nidulans (PalcA) [28], our study confirms
that the Pho4 orthologs regulate the PHO system in filamentous fungi through the same TF and TF binding
site, strongly suggesting the biological importance of
this particular pathway.
Interestingly, through the GO category enrichment
test, motif M2 (CACGTG) is highly enriched in the
upstream promoter regions of genes in ribosome cluster
2 (Figure 3). Within this cluster, 44 out of 47 genes are
predicted ribosomal proteins. Remarkably, we observed

Page 8 of 13

the expression profile for genes contained in ribosome
cluster 2 peaking sharply at 2 and 8 h, periods of spore
activation and germ tube emergence where a high level
of ribosome biogenesis would be required to cope with
an increased demand for nascent proteins. Even though,
the components of the ribosome have not been identified as targets of Pho4 in yeast [24], more than 30% of
the 155 proteins interacting with Pho4 TF [26] are classified as ribosome function related according to SlimGO
annotation. In N. crassa, 7 ribosomal proteins are regulated by Nuc-1, and 4 of them contain CACGTG in
their promoter regions [29]. The CACGTG motif is also
enriched in the upstream promoter regions of genes in
cytoskeleton cluster 1,4 and cortex cluster 3. Therefore
we hypothesize that in addition to Pi metabolism, Pho4
TF also regulates genes belonging to diverse functional
categories including protein biosynthesis and the cell
cycle.
Stress response

The other top scoring motif M3, ACGTCA, matches the
binding site of Sko1 in Sc and Atf1 in Sp, both of which

genes (19%) with orthologous pairs in Sc by BLAST program (1e-5). Similarly, we found 2378 Fg genes (18%) with orthologous pair in Sp. We
checked the presence of our motifs enrichment in the functional sets of genes identified through previous studies (references in the last
column) or by their sequence similarity to transcription factors (Figure 4). * indicates that the corresponding motif is also the most significantly

stress [30,31]. Even though both Sko1 and Atf1 are
known to use the same TF binding sites (ACGTCA),
their roles in stress defense and the set of genes they
regulate have significantly diverged. Sko1p in Sc regulates a small set of genes in response to osmotic shock
[30], while its ortholog Atf1 in fission yeast Sp regulates
a larger gene set induced by environmental stress under
diverse conditions that define Atf1 as a core environmental stress response (CESR) regulator [32]. There is a
Sko1/Atf1 ortholog in each Fusarium genome
(FGSG_10142, FVEG_02866, FOXG_05265 and
JGI_69482), although the Fusarium genes are more
similar to Atf1 (1e-32 between FGSG_10142 and Atf1,
4.5e-9 between FGSG_10142 and Sko1). About 20 Sko1
target genes were identified in Sc [30], 9 of which are
conserved in Fg. The binding site, M3, is conserved in 8
of them. Similar conservation and motif enrichment
result is also observed among the 314 Sp induced CESR
gene set (Figure 5). It is likely that the Sko1/Atf1 homolog in Fg regulates both CESR as in Sp and the osmotic
defense response as reported in Sc. Consistent with this
hypothesis, Sp is reported to be sensitive to osmotic
stress, while both Fg and Sc are resistant to osmotic
stress [33], which may indicate that the osmotic regulation through the Sko1 pathway may have either evolved
after the split of the Sp lineage, or lost in Sp. The smaller genome size and number of genes in the two yeast
systems implies that the yeasts are streamlined derivatives of a common ascomycete ancestor.
In Sc, the CESR is regulated through a different pathway using the duplicated TF gene pair MSN2/4 which
bind to a sequence that differs from the Sko1/Atf1 binding site. A single MSN homologous gene is present in
each Fusarium genome (FGSG_06871, FVEG_05115,
FOXG_01955, and JGI_102564). The Fg genes homologous to the Sc CESR pathway genes are also enriched,
but for a slightly different motif than the MSN2/4 binding sites (Figure 5). Based on all these observations, we
infer that, in response to environmental stresses, the
filamentous fungus Fg employs the combined regulatory
pathways used in both yeast systems.
Large sets of genes are also repressed under environmental stress in Sc and Sp respectively [31,32] and the
same TF binding site was reported in both systems.
About 60% and 33% of the repressed genes, from Sc
and Sp respectively, share homologous genes in Fg.
Two very similar motifs M19 and M21 are significantly
enriched in two homologous sets accordingly (Figure
5). Clearly similar regulatory mechanisms are operating
among these diverse fungal genomes, while there are
more genes involved the regulation in the filamentous
fungus Fg comparing to the rather streamlined yeast
regulatory systems. The functional association study
also revealed that these two motifs (M19 and M21) are

Page 9 of 13

enriched in the Cellular Ribosome GO category, cluster 2 (Figure 3). In rapidly growing yeast cells, about
60% of total transcription is devoted to ribosomal
RNA, and 50% of RNA polymerase II transcription is
devoted to ribosomal proteins (RPs) [34]. Therefore
repression of the genes encoding ribosomal proteins
may ensure the economic use of resources under
stressed conditions.
As one of the initial efforts to study whole genome
regulation in filamentous fungi, it is perhaps not surprising to see many of the motifs discovered from our study
have no matches in S. cerevisiae, including the top-scoring motif M1 (GCGGG). However, comparing these
motifs to known TF binding sites from other filamentous fungi identified the M1 motif as highly similar to
the binding site of transcription factor CreA (G/
CPyGGGG), a well known repressor responsible for carbon catabolite repression in Aspergillus nidulans [35].
By searching for other known Aspergillus transcription
factor binding sites within the list of discovered Fusarium promoter motifs, we found two additional matches,
including motifs M5 (GCCARG) and M26 (YGATAAG),
which show high similarity to the PacC and the AreA
DNA-binding sites respectively. PacC plays an important
role in mediating the response to ambient pH, while
AreA belongs to the GATA family of DNA-binding proteins that binds to HGATAR and mediates nitrogen
metabolism repression [36].
Discovered motifs in downstream and intronic regions

In addition to the promoter motifs, our analysis also
yielded a number of motifs showing significant conservation in the downstream and intronic regions (Additional file 1, Table S1), although the overall number is
smaller and the motifs are less conserved when compared to the promoter region (Additional file 1, Figure
S4). The most conserved intronic motif (GTNAGT,
Additional file 1, Table S1), corresponding to a splice
donor motif, is both abundant (6648 instances) and
well conserved with C.R. (conservation rate) equal to
37%. However, among the downstream conserved
motifs we didn’t find the mammalian polyadenylation
signal (AATAAA). The polyadenylation hexamer,
though abundant, is rarely conserved in the Fusarium
genome. Among the downstream regions, we found a
total of 1138 occurrences, only 11 of which are conserved (C.R.: 0.9% and MCS = -3.69), which is even
lower than the rate for a random hexamer (C.R.: 2.7%).
The known polyadenylation signals in Sc, TATATA
and TTAAGAAC [37,38], also have a low MCS value
of -1.8 (6 conserved from a total of 409 instances) and
-0.3 (0 conserved from a total of 9 instances) respectively, suggesting that a different polyadenylation signal
may be used in the Fusarium genomes.

Kumar et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:208
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/208

The discovered downstream motifs and the splice signals in the introns show a strong directional bias, while
the promoter motifs have similar conservation rate in
both the forward and reverse strands (Additional file 1,
Figure S5). This directional specificity is consistent with
the function of the downstream motifs and the splice
signals in post-transcriptional processes, in contrast with
the promoter motifs that act at the level of DNA, as
binding sites during transcription.

Discussion
There is limited knowledge about transcriptional regulation among filamentous fungi. This study is the first
attempt to systematically characterize sequence signatures that are conserved through evolution and may
have the potential to function as regulatory elements
among several Fusarium species, a group of agricultural
important filamentous fungi. The study results in a total
of 73 conserved elements in promoter regions. These
promoter motifs are enriched in the upstream region of
the genes involved in specific cellular functions, indicating their potential functional association with specific
biological processes and validating the biological significance of our discovery. Interestingly, we observed the
conservation among Fusarium species and two yeast
model systems, Sc and Sp for some TFs, their binding
sites and target genes regulated by these TFs for some
important pathways, including phosphate metabolism
and stress response. Both computational and experimental approaches were used to define modularity of regulatory network [39]. The conservation of potential
regulatory elements accompanying certain conserved
modules was also reported [39,40].
Constantly exposed to a wide range of environmental
changes, including hostile conditions, environmental
stress response is essential for the survival of fungi. In
that sense, it is not surprising to observe a significant
conservation among both induced and repressed gene
sets in response to environmental stresses across divergent lineages. Our study suggests that the core environmental stress response (CESR) is a highly conserved
physiological mechanism that protects cells and organisms from stressful changes in their environment. The
conservation between Sc osmotic stress response pathway and the Fg gene sets suggests that this regulatory
pathway may have evolved after the split of Schizosaccharomyces, or was lost in this Ascomycete basal lineage. The more complete list of genes that are repressed
under ESR in Fg also suggests that both yeast systems
have independently reduced portions of the pathway
through evolution.
The focus of this study is on short regulatory motifs
with size around 7 bp. Therefore translation-related
motifs, which are typically longer, are likely missed by

Page 10 of 13

our method. In addition, the translation-related motifs
such as internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and upstream
ORFs (uORFs) typically observe different conservation
characteristics than the transcription-related motifs, since
what is preserved for IRES is its secondary structure and
what is preserved for uORFs is their short ORF structure.
Detecting these translation-related motifs likely will
require a new conservation measure that can take these
specific characteristics into account. It is interesting to
note that a motif containing ATG (ATGACGN with the
MCS >30), which could encode the start codon of
uORFs, is detected in the upstream regions.

Conclusions
We developed a computational pipeline to systematically
discover regulatory motifs in Fg by comparing its genome to three other closely related Fusarium genomes.
Our analysis yielded 73 candidate motifs in promoter
regions, 69 in the downstream regions, and 39 in the
intronic regions. Out of the 73 motifs discovered in the
promoter regions, 22 showed strong enrichment in
functionally related gene clusters, and 16 showed strong
sequence similarity to known motifs in Sc, altogether
corresponding to 41% of the discovered motifs, suggesting that many of the motifs are likely true functional
elements. Comparison of these motifs with known yeast
TF binding sites revealed a significant conservation for
signals involved in phosphate metabolism and ESR pathways, providing the first look into the regulation of
these biological processes in Fg. Such conservation
across millions of years of evolution since the divergence
of yeast and Fg indicates the functional importance of
these regulatory pathways. The analysis presented here
demonstrates the power of comparative genomics for
discovering functional elements in the Fusarium genome. As more genomes and better annotation of genes
become available, the list of regulatory motifs presented
here can be further refined.
Methods
Genome alignments and annotation

Local-alignment anchors were detected using PatternHunter (1e-10) [41]. Contiguous sets of anchors with
conserved order and orientation were chained together
within a 10 kb distance. The multiple alignments for all
the syntenic regions that cover a common segment on
the reference genome Fg were conducted using Mlogan
[42] We used the annotation of Fg [5,6] as a reference
to define the coding sequence versus intergenic (600 bp
upstream of the start codon and 600 bases downstream
of the stop codon) and intronic regions in the aligned
regions. For the intronic regions, we extended sequences
by 2 bp both upstream and downstream in order to
include the intron splice sites.

Motif Conservation Score

The motif conservation score (MCS) for the ith heptamer Hi is computed using the following function:
MCS i 

K i  N i Po
N i Po(1 Po )

where Ki is the number of conserved occurrences and
N i is the number of total occurrences of H i in the
aligned genome of Fg with Fo, Fv and Fs. Po is the fraction of total conserved occurrences among the total
occurrences of all heptamers. The same function is used
to compute the MCS for degenerate motifs. However,
the P o is calculated differently. Since P o denotes the
average conservation rate of a motif m, we scan 5000
random heptamers in the genome and calculate its conservation as per the degeneracy profile of m. This conservation score is then used to compute the average
conservation rate for a motif whose degeneracy profile
is the same as m (See Additional file 1 for details).
Degeneracy

We used consensus sequences to represent regulatory
motifs. The sequences are spread over 11 alphabets,
consisting of four nucleotides A, C, G, T, the six twofold degenerate characters S = [C or G], W = [A or T],
Y = [C or T], R = [A or G], M = [A or C], K = [G or
T], and the four-fold degenerate character N = [A, C, G,
or T]. A motif m occurs in the Fg genome when each
nucleotide in the genome satisfies the corresponding
degenerate character in the consensus sequence of m.
We used a greedy approach to discover motifs with
higher MCS values by adding degeneracy as described
in the main text and Additional file 1.
Clustering

We clustered the degenerate motifs as per their
sequence similarity. We quantify the similarity between
two motifs by the Pearson correlation of their equivalent
position weight matrices. The weight matrices represent
the frequencies of different nucleotides at each base. For
example, if the base is W = (A or T), its corresponding
column in the matrix will be represented as [0.5, 0, 0,
0.5] in the order of A, C, G and T. We computed the
Pearson correlation coefficient between two positional
weight matrices as described in Xie et al [18].

genes that are shared by F and M, the P-value of
enrichment of motif m in the set F is computed as:
min( F , M)

P  value 


iK

 F  N  F 
 

 i  M i 
N
 
 M

Since this value is usually very close to zero, we have
used -log10(P-value) to denote the enrichment. For the
later analysis of overlap between the set of genes derived
as homologs from other eukaryotic species namely Sp
and Sc, the N variable is limited to the number of genes
in that species that have clear orthologs in Fg. Similarly,
F and M are also reduced to only include genes with
clear orthologs in Fg. Since only about a quarter of
genes have orthologs in Fg, this reduction allows us to
compute the effective enrichment without biasing the
function towards the genes that are present in set but
have no orthologs in Fg.
Determining one-to-one orthologous genes

We derived orthologous genes from Sc and Sp to the genes
in Fg for our gene set enrichment analysis based on a oneto-one map from yeast genes to the gene in Fg according
to the highest similarity score of Blastp (E ≤ 10-5).
Strains and materials

The sequenced strain of F. graminearum (PH-1; [5]) was
used for expression analysis. Gene expression levels were
determined using a custom Fusarium graminearum Affymetrix microarray (Fusariuma520094; [11]). Data from a
spore germination time-course were used to create
expression clusters [10] and raw data are available as
experiment FG7 at the database PLEXdb [43]. K-means
clustering was performed in the Analyst module of
Expressionist version 5.1 (Genedata) using raw data
imported and normalized according to [10]. The silhouette score was used to determine the optimum number
of clusters for genes in each GO category using a specified range of 2-5. Default settings were used for distance,
centroid calculation and maximum iterations fields.

file contains a more detailed description of the methods used in motif
discovery.

Enrichment

The enrichment, or overlap, between two sets of genes
is computed by assuming an underlying hyper-geometric
model. Given the total number of N genes in Fg, with F
number of genes in a functional category set, M number
of genes that contains a motif m, and K number of
