Abstract
Background: Hydrogenosomes are organelles that produce molecular hydrogen and ATP. The broad phylogenetic
distribution of their hosts suggests that the hydrogenosomes of these organisms evolved several times independently
from the mitochondria of aerobic progenitors. Morphology and 18S rRNA phylogeny suggest that the microaerophilic
amoeboflagellate Psalteriomonas lanterna, which possesses hydrogenosomes and elusive "modified mitochondria", belongs
to the Heterolobosea, a taxon that consists predominantly of aerobic, mitochondriate organisms. This taxon is rather
unrelated to taxa with hitherto studied hydrogenosomes.
Results: Electron microscopy of P. lanterna flagellates reveals a large globule in the centre of the cell that is build up from
stacks of some 20 individual hydrogenosomes. The individual hydrogenosomes are surrounded by a double membrane
that encloses a homogeneous, dark staining matrix lacking cristae. The "modified mitochondria" are found in the
cytoplasm of the cell and are surrounded by 1-2 cisterns of rough endoplasmatic reticulum, just as the mitochondria of
certain related aerobic Heterolobosea. The ultrastructure of the "modified mitochondria" and hydrogenosomes is very
similar, and they have the same size distribution as the hydrogenosomes that form the central stack.
The phylogenetic analysis of selected EST sequences (Hsp60, Propionyl-CoA carboxylase) supports the phylogenetic
position of P. lanterna close to aerobic Heterolobosea (Naegleria gruberi). Moreover, this analysis also confirms the
identity of several mitochondrial or hydrogenosomal key-genes encoding proteins such as a Hsp60, a pyruvate:ferredoxin
oxidoreductase, a putative ADP/ATP carrier, a mitochondrial complex I subunit (51 KDa), and a [FeFe] hydrogenase.
Conclusion: Comparison of the ultrastructure of the "modified mitochondria" and hydrogenosomes strongly suggests
that both organelles are just two morphs of the same organelle. The EST studies suggest that the hydrogenosomes of P.
lanterna are physiologically similar to the hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis and Trimastix pyriformis. Phylogenetic
analysis of the ESTs confirms the relationship of P. lanterna with its aerobic relative, the heterolobosean amoeboflagellate
Naegleria gruberi, corroborating the evolution of hydrogenosomes from a common, mitochondriate ancestor.

Background
Aerobic eukaryotes possess classical mitochondria, but
anaerobic eukaryotes can host very diverse organelles that
belong to a broad spectrum of double-membrane
bounded, mitochondria-related compartments. These
organelles range from full-fledged, but anaerobic mitochondria to tiny "mitosomes" with a minimal protein
content. Examples of these anaerobic functioning
organelles are the "mitochondria-like" organelles of Blastocystis [1], the "mitochondrial remnant" of Cryptosporidium [2], the "hydrogenosomes" of Trichomonas [3] and the
"mitosomes" of Giardia, Entamoeba, and Trachipleistophora
[4-6]. Anaerobic mitochondria, mitochondria-like
organelles and hydrogenosomes produce ATP, albeit with
either different electron transport chains than in aerobic
mitochondria, or without an electron transport chain
altogether. Mitosomes do not produce ATP - they seem to
host only enzymes engaged in Fe-S cluster biogenesis [7].
The presence of these proteins appears to be the only
property that is shared between all members of the mitochondrial family, perhaps with the exception of the mitosomes of Entamoeba histolytica and Mastigamoeba balamuthi
where the corresponding proteins are likely to be localized in the cytoplasm [8-10]. Hydrogenosomes produce
molecular hydrogen with the aid of one or several hydrogenases. They are double-membrane bounded organelles
sized approximately 0.5 - 2 μm. They are found in a broad
spectrum of unicellular, anaerobic (or microaerophilic)
protists such as parabasalid flagellates (Trichomonas vaginalis, Tritrichomonas foetus, Histomonas meleagridis), excavate, preaxostylid flagellates (Trimastix pyriformis),
heterolobosean amoeboflagellates (Psalteriomonas lanterna), anaerobic ciliates (e.g. Nyctotherus ovalis, Metopus
palaeformis, Trimyema compressum, Caenomorpha uniserialis,
Dasytricha ruminantium), and anaerobic chytridiomycete
fungi (Neocallimastix sp., Piromyces sp.). The broad phylogenetic distribution of their hosts suggests that the
hydrogenosomes of these organisms evolved several times
independently. Accordingly, hydrogenosomes are not the
same, they differ structurally and metabolically [11-14].
However, it is likely that all these various hydrogenosomes produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation.
Besides ATP and hydrogen, most of them produce CO2
and acetate as end products of their carbohydrate metabolism. Nyctotherus ovalis produces succinate in addition,
and the ciliate Trimyema compressum as well as the anaerobic chytrids Neocallimastix sp. and Piromyces sp. produce
formate as one of their metabolic end products
[11,12,15,16]. The major substrate of the carbohydrate
catabolism of hydrogenosomes is pyruvate that is metabolized by either pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
(PFO) as in Trichomonas or pyruvate:formate lyase (PFL)
as in Neocallimastix and Piromyces [15,17]. Notably, Nyctotherus ovalis uses pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) as aer-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/287

obic mitochondria do [16]. For their major redoxreactions, hydrogenosomes use ferredoxins or components of a mitochondrial or bacterial complex I. [18,19].
Evidence from morphology and 18S rRNA phylogeny suggests that the microaerophilic amoeboflagellate Psalteriomonas lanterna belongs to the Heterolobosea, a taxon
that consists predominantly of aerobic, mitochondriate
organisms [20-23]. Only three related anaerobic organisms, the amoebae Vahlkampfia anaerobica, Monopylocystis
visvesvarai and Sawyeria marylandensis have been
described. While the lack of molecular data does not allow
a closer determination of the phylogenetic position of
Vahlkampfia anaerobica, 18S rRNA data clearly reveal that
the latter two amoebae are close relatives of Psalteriomonas
lanterna [22-24]. The flagellate stage of Psalteriomonas lanterna hosts a large globular hydrogenosomal complex that
is associated with numerous endosymbiotic methanogens
[20]. Remarkably, it also hosts 0.6 - 3.0 μm sized cytoplasmic organelles that were interpreted as "modified mitochondria" [20,25]. If this interpretation is true, it would
make Psalteriomonas unique in having both mitochondria
and hydrogenosomes which are normally mutually exclusive. The large, globular organelles were identified as
hydrogenosomes using a cytochemical reaction (BSTP
staining, c.f. [26]) to detect hydrogenase activity and the
organelle's reaction with a heterologous antibody against
hydrogenase [25]. The "modified mitochondria" reacted
only weakly with the antibody and were not analyzed in
more detail. Physiological studies were not performed
since P. lanterna cannot be cultured axenically. Molecular
information is restricted to the DNA sequence of a ferredoxin and the 18S rRNA gene; the latter allowed the determination of the phylogenetic position of P. lanterna as
belonging to the Percolozoa (Heterolobosea) with a sistergroup relationship to the Vahlkamphidae [21-23,27].
Here we present a combined electron microscopic and
molecular study that aims to unravel the structure and
function of the hydrogenosomes and the presumed
"modified mitochondria" of Psalteriomonas lanterna. We
describe the ultrastructure of the "modified mitochondria" and hydrogenosomes in detail and provide evidence
that both organelles are actually two morphs of the same
organelle and not two different organelles. Moreover, we
provide molecular information from preliminary EST
studies on the phylogenetic position with respect to the
aerobic relatives and the potential function of the hydrogenosomes. These studies suggest that the hydrogenosomes of P. lanterna are physiologically similar to the
hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis and Trimastix
pyriformis [17,28]. Phylogenetic analysis of the ESTs confirms the relationship of P. lanterna with its aerobic relative, the heterolobosean amoeboflagellate Naegleria

amoeboflagellate and closely related to the pathogenic
Naegleria fowleri that can cause severe amoebic meningitis.

Results and discussion
Electron microscopy
Light microscopy of Psalteriomonas lanterna flagellates
reveals a large globule in the centre of the cell (Fig. 1a).
This globule had been identified as a hydrogenosome by
its reaction with an antiserum against hydrogenase and
activity staining for hydrogenase with the aid of the BSTP
reaction [25]. Also in the amoeba stage this globule is
present but less prominently shaped (Fig. 1b). DAPI - and
ethidium bromide staining of the globule for nucleic acids
were negative (not shown).

When the hydrogenosomes of Psalteriomonas lanterna
were described for the first time at the electron microscopy level, they were seen to form globules consisting of
closely packed "microbodies" intermingled with symbiotic methanogenic archaea [20]. In some cases the
hydrogenosomes (microbodies) were penetrated by
methanogens [25]. Notably, the analysis of symbiont-free
cells revealed that the hydrogenosomes also assembled
into globules in the absence of methanogenic archaea.
After more than 20 years of cultivation, all Psalteriomonas
lanterna cells became free of methanogens as judged by
the absence of methane production and the specific F420
autofluorescence [29] (data not shown). Electron microscopical analysis confirms the absence of methanogens
and reveals that the central globule is a large complex
built up from stacks of more than 20 individual hydrogenosomes, which are predominantly sausage- and dumbbell-shaped (Fig. 2c, d). Individual hydrogenosomes are
surrounded by a double membrane that encloses a homogeneous, dark staining matrix (Fig. 2d). In a few cells, up

the stacks consist of 5-6 individual hydrogenosomes (Fig.

Broers [20] described "modified mitochondria" in the
periphery of the Psalteriomonas lanterna cells, odd
organelles that were surrounded by a cistern of rough
endoplasmatic reticulum (rough ER). In our study, these
"modified mitochondria" look very similar to the individual hydrogenosomes of the hydrogenosomal complex of
the globule (Fig. 2b, e, f). The matrix is homogeneous, but
less densely stained as in the stacked hydrogenosomes;
there is no evidence for the presence of (mitochondrial)

cristae. All these organelles are surrounded by 1-2 cisterns
of rough ER - like the mitochondria of aerobic Heterolobosea, e.g. Tetramitus rostratus, Paratetramitus jugosus, Vahlkampfia aberdonica, Vahlkampfia avara and Vahlkampfia
ustiana [30,31]. Similarly to the hydrogenosomes in the
stack, they are bounded by a double membrane. Most
organelles are dumb-bell-shaped (Fig. 2b, f), some are
sausage-shaped (Fig. 2e), and a few are cup-shaped and
similar in appearance to the mitochondria of certain aerobic Heterolobosea, e.g. Vahlkampfia ustiana [31]. Certain
dumb-bell- and cup-shaped organelles are rather slim in
the middle, suggesting that these organelles might be fission stages similar to the fission stages of Trichomonas vaginalis hydrogenosomes [32]. A biometric analysis of the
electron microscopic pictures of the stacked hydrogenosomes and the cytoplasmatic organelles revealed no differences in the length-distribution (Fig. 3). The diameter
of the hydrogenosomes and the modified mitochondria
show a modal distribution around 0.3 μm (range 0.1-0.9,
N = 111; data not shown). Given the identical distribution
of lengths and diameters and the very similar morphology, we conclude that the cytoplasmatic organelles are
hydrogenosomes, potentially in young, dividing stages.
Absence of staining of the cytoplasmatic organelles in the
BSTP reaction at the light microscopic level can be
explained either by a lack of hydrogenase activity in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/287

"young" organelles or by an insufficient sensitivity of the
BSTP reaction. On the other hand, pictures published by
Broers [25] suggest a faint reaction with the hydrogenase
antibody. Moreover, both types of organelles stain with
Rhodamine-123 as normal mitochondria and hydrogenosomes [16,25]. Therefore, it is likely that both the stacked
hydrogenosomes and the cytoplasmatic organelles
("modified mitochondria") are morphs (or developmental stages) of the same organelle. It is highly unlikely that
hydrogenosomes and mitochondria occur in the same
cell, because hydrogenosomes have been identified as a
special kind of hydrogen-producing mitochondria
[14,16,18]. On the other hand, different morphs of mitochondria have been described in the ciliate Euplotes minuta
[33,34]. The most spectacular example of the presence of
different mitochondria in the same organism is the
"nebenkern" formation during spermatogenesis in Drosophila where mitochondria aggregate and fuse to form a
globule of the same size as the nucleus [35].
ESTs
About 480 randomly chosen clones were sequenced and
analyzed using the BLAST X tool [36]. The clones were single reads of varying length. The genes discussed here
(except 51 kDa) were extended by RT-PCR.

Although the cDNA library was created using poly-d(T)
primers, several sequences of bacterial origin were identified that matched with species present in the non-axenic
culture. However, bona-fide Psalteriomonas sequences
were easily identified by their high A+T content (67-72%).
In addition, a codon usage analysis was performed using
the Cusp program from the EMBOSS package [37] and a
principal component analysis. These analyses confirmed
the homogeneity of the putative Psalteriomonas sequences.
The protein sequences were selected for phylogenetic
analysis either because of their usefulness for establishing
the phylogenetic position of Psalteriomonas lanterna: Elongation Factor 1 alpha, Hsp60, or for their potential role in
the hydrogenosomal metabolism: putative ADP/ATP carrier, [FeFe] hydrogenase, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCB),
Complex I - 51 kDa subunit and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).

Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha)
During the translation of a mRNA chain in the ribosome,
two GTPases play an important role in the elongation
cycle: the Elongation factor 2 (EF-2 or EF-G in Prokaryotes) and the Elongation Factor 1 alpha. The EF-1 alpha
(EF-Tu in Prokaryotes) is responsible for carrying and promoting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A-site of
the ribosomal small subunit [38].

Since Elongation Factor 1 alpha is present in the three
domains of life, i.e., Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, it
should be a good phylogenetic marker that might be useful for inferring the phylogenetic position of Psalteriomonas within the eukaryotic tree of life. However, the
species distribution within the tree calculated here is not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/287

in complete agreement with the eukaryotic tree of life
since several species exhibit conspicuous artefactual relationships, particularly the polyphyly of the ciliates and
Amoebozoa (Fig 4). Notwithstanding, Psalteriomonas lanterna clusters with Trichomonas vaginalis as seen in several
of our phylogenies.

Heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60/cpn 60)
Hsp60 (GroEL/cpn60) is an ATP-dependent, highly conserved protein, involved in protein folding, maturation,
renaturation and assembly of complexes, as well as in
intracellular cross-membrane shuttling of precursor-protein molecules [39]. In nearly all eukaryotes it is located in
the mitochondria, hydrogenosomes or mitosomes.

Its structure resembles a cylindrical barrel, which binds
and encloses the folding of proteins in its core [40]. It is
an essential and highly conserved protein present in virtually all organisms, shows no evidence of horizontal gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/287

transfer, and is frequently used as a mitochondrial marker
[41].
The Hsp60 phylogeny shows the expected eukaryotic
branching, and a solid bootstrap supported outgroup of
prokaryotic sequences (Fig. 5). Psalteriomonas lanterna and
Naegleria gruberi branch together corroborating a close
relationship between the mitochondrion of Naegleria gruberi and the hydrogenosomes of Psalteriomonas lanterna.
This clustering with N. gruberi is consistent with the previously published 18S rRNA phylogeny which groups both
organisms [21-23]. Furthermore, the clustering of the Het-

erolobosea with the Euglenozoa seen in this tree is consistent with previously published eukaryotic phylogenies
[42].
Mitochondrial Solute Carrier (putative ADP/ATP Carrier
(AAC))
The ADP/ATP translocator is a member of the Mitochondrial Carrier Family (MCF), which catalyses the transmembrane exchange of ATP produced in the
mitochondria (or hydrogenosomes) for cytosolic ADP. All
members of this protein family exhibit a tripartite structure which consists of three consecutive sequence repeats
of about 100 residues each representing the 3 transmembrane domains [43]. This protein family is exclusively
present in Eukaryotes.

All bona-fide mitochondria, but also the hydrogenosomes of Nyctotherus ovalis and Neocallimastix/Piromyces,
possess members of the mitochondrial-type ADP/ATP
translocator subfamily. The hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis and the mitosomes of Entamoeba histolytica and Antonospora locustae do not possess a
mitochondrial-type ADP/ATP translocator. Instead they
evolved alternative ADP/ATP carriers, which, of course,
belong to the mitochondrial carrier family [44]. In addition, the three members of the mitochondrial carrier family of Trimastix pyriformis do not belong to the cluster of
genuine mitochondrial-type AACs; their function has not
yet been established [28]. While the AAC of Naegleria gruberi clusters within the bona-fide mitochondrial carriers,
the mitochondrial carrier protein of Psalteriomonas lanterna assumes an intermediate position between the genuine mitochondrial AACs and the alternative transporters
of Trichomonas, Entamoeba and Antonospora (Fig. 6). The
phylogenetic position of the mitochondrial carrier protein
of Psalteriomonas lanterna argues that this mitochondrial
carrier might also be an alternative ADP/ATP carrier. Nevertheless, the alternative possibility, that the mitochondrial carrier protein of Psalteriomonas lanterna is derived
from bona-fide AACs cannot be excluded.
[FeFe] Hydrogenase
Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze the
reversible reaction that produces dihydrogen using two
electrons and two protons. These enzymes are classified in
three distinct classes according to the metallic composition of their prosthetic groups: the [Fe]-hydrogenases,
only present in methanogenic Archaea; the [NiFe]-hydrogenases, widespread within prokaryotic organisms; and
finally, the oxygen sensitive [FeFe]-hydrogenases [45].

[FeFe]-hydrogenases are rather common in anaerobic Bacteria and Archaea, but in eukaryotes its presence is limited
to a few species of anaerobic protists, anaerobic chytrid
fungi and some green algae. In general, the hydrogenase is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/287

located in membrane-bounded organelles, i.e. plastids or
hydrogenosomes. In Giardia and Entamoeba the enzyme is
located in the cytoplasm [46]. [FeFe]-hydrogenases are
generally monomeric and exhibit a multi-domain structure, with a very well conserved active site of ca. 350 residues - the H-cluster - and a variably sized N-terminal
domain containing up to four Fe-S clusters [47]. This phylogeny was computed using the H-cluster portion of the
protein, due to the modular structure of the hydrogenases,
and it positions Psalteriomonas lanterna as a sister group of
the algal and fungal hydrogenases (Fig.7).
Pyruvate:Ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO)
Pyruvate is of central importance for the energy metabolism of cells. Its oxidative decarboxylation leads to the formation of acetyl-CoA and CO2. Aerobic species possess a
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex,
which catalyzes this reaction and specifically reduces
NAD+. Anaerobic species in general use another set of
specialized enzymes, which reduce low-potential electron
carrier proteins, e.g. ferredoxin or flavodoxin, instead of
pyridine nucleotides like NAD [48,49]. One of these
enzymes is the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO),
which is present in many eubacteria and archaea, but also
in a restricted number of anaerobic eukaryotes, like Trichomonas vaginalis [17], Trimastix pyriformis [28], Giardia
lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica [50]. PFO seems not to
be present in the aerobic amoeboflagellate Naegleria gruberi. It is regarded as a hallmark protein for hydrogenosomes or organisms with mitosomes [50], although PFO
or the related PNO have also been detected in a few organisms with mitochondria, e.g. Euglena and Chlamydomonas.
The PFO of Psalteriomonas lanterna branches with the
enzymes of Trichomonas vaginalis and Blastocystis, but here
is still some discussion regarding the intrinsic function of
PFO [51] (Fig. 8). In Blastocystis, which belongs to the
Straminopila and which possesses a hydrogenosome-like
organelle, two EST clusters encoding a PFO and a PNO
(pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase) were identified. Biochemical studies have so far provided only evidence for
PNO activity [51].
Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCB)
Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is a biotin dependent enzyme
that catalyses the ATP dependent carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA. It is involved in the
metabolism of odd-chained fatty-acids, cholesterol and
the essential amino acids threonine, methionine, valine
and isoleucine [52].

The PCC structure consists of two heterologous subunits,
alpha and beta, encoded by PCCA and PCCB genes,
respectively. The dodecamer enzyme complex is arranged
in an alpha6beta6 conformation [53].

PCC is involved in metazoan ubiquitous pathways; it has
a patchy distribution among other Eukaryotes, suggesting
multiple gene loss events [54,55] and it was included in
our analysis, because of its location in the mitochondrial
matrix and its pivotal metabolic role. The phylogenetic

analysis shows a 100% bootstrap value for the clustering
between Psalteriomonas lanterna and Naegleria gruberi (Fig.
9), which is consistent with the results obtained with
Hsp60 and points to a close relationship between Naegleria's mitochondrion and Psalteriomonas's hydrogenosome.

NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase 51 kDa subunit
(Complex I -ndufv1/NuoF)
NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, commonly known as
mitochondrial Complex I, is the largest of the five
OXPHOS complexes present in the mitochondrial membrane of aerobic organisms, comprising 45 proteins in
human [56]. This protein complex can be divided into 3
functional modules: the dehydrogenase module which is
responsible for the oxidation of NADH, the hydrogenase
module that shuttles the released electrons, and finally,
the transporter module, which pumps protons across the
mitochondrial membrane [57]. The 51 kDa subunit,
encoded by the ndufv1/nuoF nuclear gene, is an essential
part of the dehydrogenase module because it carries the
NADH binding site. Also it binds two co-factors: flavin
mononucleotide (FMN) which is an electron carrier molecule that acts as a hydrogen acceptor and one 4Fe-4S cluster, which captures the electrons released from the NADH
oxidation [58]. Despite its role in mitochondrial Complex
I, this protein has been found in the absence of most of

the remaining proteins of this complex in at least two
organisms: Trichomonas vaginalis [59] and Schizosaccharomyces pombe [56], where it is believed to bind and oxidize
NADH, potentially functioning as a diaphorase for the
hydrogenase. Once again, the link between Psalteriomonas
and Trichomonas is present in this phylogeny, showing
also that the 51 kDa of Psalteriomonas belongs to the cluster of mitochondrial and alpha-proteobacterial enzymes
(Fig. 10).
Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a mitochondrial
enzyme widely distributed in the three domains of life. It
catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate and ammonia, using either NAD
or NADP as a co-factor. This enzyme is classified in three
basic types, according to its co-factor specificity: the NAD
specific, the NADP specific and the dual enzyme which
accepts either of these. These enzymes are homopolymeres, commonly composed by two to six subunits [60].

While multicellular eukaryotes present only the dual
enzyme, fungi have both co-factor specific enzymes and
protists possess any combination of dual and specific
GDHs [61]. The phylogenetic analysis clusters Psalteriomonas within the Ciona, Spironucleus and Giardia branch
(Fig. 11). The position of N. gruberi relative to that of Psalteriomonas is at odds with their relation observed in the
PCCB and the Hsp60 phylogeny. Glutamate dehydrogenases show evidence of frequent lateral gene transfer [61],
providing an explanation for this inconsistency.

Conclusion
The hydrogenosomes of Psalteriomonas lanterna are morphologically similar to the mitochondria of its relatives,
the aerobic Heterolobosea, if one ignores the absence of
cristae in Psalteriomonas lanterna. This becomes evident
from their shape, the double membrane, which bounds
both types of hydrogenosomes of Psalteriomonas lanterna,
and the cisterns of rough ER that surround the cytoplasmic forms of the hydrogenosomes. This is characteristic
for the mitochondria of the aerobic Heterolobosea,

which, in contrast to the hydrogenosomes of Psalteriomonas lanterna, possess full-fledged cristae. However,
there are no reports that the mitochondria of the aerobic
Heterolobosea can form stacks like the hydrogenosomes
of P. lanterna.
The molecular data, which are summarized in Table 1,
also support the similarity between the hydrogenosomes
of P. lanterna and the mitochondria of the aerobic Heterolobosea since the mitochondrial proteins Hsp60 and
Propionyl-CoA Carboxylase B of Psalteriomonas lanterna
are closely related to their homologues of Naegleria gruberi. The close phylogenetic relationship between Psalteriomonas lanterna and Naegleria gruberi had also been shown
by the analysis of the 18S rRNA [21].
The presence of a PFO, a [FeFe]hydrogenase, a putative
alternative ADP/ATP translocator and the 51 kD subunit
of mitochondrial complex I are characteristic hallmarks of
a hydrogenosomal metabolism resembling that of Trichomonas vaginalis and Trimastix pyriformis [17,28]. How-

ever, this is the first report of a PFO in a hydrogenosome
that is clearly derived from an aerobic mitochondrion.
This allows the development of a rudimentary metabolic
scheme (Fig. 12). The decarboxylation of pyruvate by PFO
yields electrons, which, analogous to the situation in Trichomonas [17], requires a ferredoxin like protein similar to
the one described earlier [27]. However, Blast analysis of
the published ferredoxin sequence fails to reveal homologies with well-characterized ferredoxins. Moreover, the AT
content of the gene is dramatically lower than that of
other genes analysed in this study. Finally, an analysis of
the codon usage with the aid of a principal component
analysis clearly excludes the published ferredoxin
sequence from the cluster of Psalteriomonas genes (not
shown). Therefore, it is very unlikely that the published
sequence is a Psalteriomonas ferredoxin, and, consequently, a genuine ferredoxin of P. lanterna still awaits
detection.
Consequently, the transfer of the electrons from the PFO
to the hydrogenase in our scheme (Fig. 12) remains
unclear. It is possible that the 51 KDa protein might be
involved since it can function as a diaphorase [17,59,62].
In conclusion, both the morphology of the hydrogenosomes and the molecular data strongly support the inter-

pretation that the hydrogenosomes of Psalteriomonas
lanterna and the mitochondria of the aerobic Heterolobosea share a common ancestor. The hydrogenosomes of
Trichomonas are metabolically similar, but morphologically distinct, and they represent a peculiar type of hydrogenosome that lacks related mitochondrial relatives. Also
the hydrogenosomes of ciliates and chytridiomycete fungi
are different. And since the hydrogenosomes of the ciliate
Nyctotherus ovalis share a common ancestry with ciliate
mitochondria, while the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic chytrids Neocallimastix and Piromyces share an ancestry
with fungal mitochondria, our study provides a new
example of the evolution of a hydrogenosome from an
aerobic relative [14], and the first example of a Trichomonas-like hydrogenosome from an aerobic mitochondrion.

Methods
Cultivation of Psalteriomonas lanterna
Psalteriomonas lanterna was isolated from anoxic sediment
from a sedimentation pond of a waste water treatment
plant near Nijmegen about 20 years ago and cultured
since then as a polyxenic culture. Bottles of 100 ml, 250
ml, 500 ml and 1000 ml were filled to 40% with 5 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.1 mM cysteine-HCl, 1 ml/l
Pfennigs metal solution, 0.025% proteose pepton and

Resazurine (50 pM w/v). The bottles were stoppered with
butyl-rubber stoppers, evacuated, flushed with N2 and
filled with this gas until a final pressure of 1.5 Bar. These
bottles were sterilized and inoculated with Psalteriomonas
lanterna cells. Oxygen was added until a final concentration of 1%. Twice a week bottles were checked; if they
were completely anaerobic, oxygen was added up to 1%.
The bottles were stored at 22°C and exposed to light every
day for several hours.
Generation of the EST library
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature in 50 ml glass tubes in a Hettich centrifuge for 5 minutes at 2000 r.p.m.. The supernatant was removed and the
cell pellet was immediately dissolved in 8 M guanidin-

iumchloride (final concentration 6M). RNA was isolated
and cleaned with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was
created with the "SMART"- technology (BD Biosciences).
The produced cDNA was amplified. Then the cDNA was
restricted with Sfi I and size fractionated (fraction 1-2.5 kb
and >2.5 kb). The DNA fragments were cloned sitedirected. For the transformation we used competent E. coli
DH10B cells. The library was generated by Genterprise,
Mainz, Germany. About 480 randomly chosen clones
were sequenced and analyzed using the BLAST X tool [36].
The A+T content was calculated, and clones with an A+T
content of approximately 67-72% were regarded as
derived from Psalteriomonas lanterna. The EST sequences
varied largely in length and, in general, were incomplete.

Branches show the bootstrap support values.

Generation of full-length cDNA
The sequence of the [FeFe] hydrogenase was nearly completed to the N- and C-terminal ends starting from the Hcluster (that was sequenced earlier [63]). Total RNA was
isolated from Psalteriomonas cells using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's manual and
subsequently, cDNA was generated using SuperScript
(Invitrogen) and an anchored oligo-d(T) primer. Alternatively, SMART RNA amplification (Clontech) was used to
generate (near) full-length cDNA sequences from all genes
discussed here except 51 kDa.
Electron microscopy
The electron microscopic preparations followed a modified Karnovsky procedure (4% paraformaldehyde and 5%
glutardialdehyde in phosphate buffer pH 7.2). For post-

fixation, the OsO4/K3Fe(CN)6 method of Hepler [64] was
applied. En block staining was performed with 2% uranyl
acetate. After embedding in Epon 812 [65], sections were
made on a Reichert Om U2 ultramicrotome, stained with
lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined in a Zeiss
109 T electron microscope.
Sequence data retrieval and alignment
The longest ORF from the conceptual translation (universal genetic code) of the ESTs of Psalteriomonas was
obtained for each gene using Expasy's Translate tool http:/
/www.expasy.org/tools/dna.html. The genes received the
following GenBank accession
numbers:

major Eukaryotic branches, were selected to integrate the
phylogenetic study. In order to facilitate this selection, a
preliminary analysis of the complete dataset was carried
out by inspecting the global topology of 1000 times bootstrapped Neighbour-Joining trees, computed with ClustalW [66]. When possible, a small outgroup of prokaryotic
sequences was included to root the trees. After the careful
selection of the final dataset, we pursued to select the bestfit model of amino acid replacement, according to the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as implemented in
the ProtTest (version 2.2) software [67]. Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenies were computed with PhyML (version 2.4.4) [68], using the model previously chosen. (For
the detailed description of the model and parameters used
for each phylogenetic inference, including the matrix of aa
substitution; number of Gamma discrete rate-categories
(+G); proportion of invariable sites (+I) and observed
amino acid frequencies (+F), see figure captions). A bootstrap analysis was conducted with 100 samples for each
protein.
Codon Usage and Principle Component Analysis
In order to rule out the presence of contaminants in the
EST set, we performed a codon usage analysis using the
Cusp program from the EMBOSS package (version 6.0.1)
[37]. We also included in our analysis the ferredoxin
sequence previously published by Brul et al. [27] to analyse whether it is of Psalteriomonas origin or not. A principle component analysis was conducted using the prcomp
function of the R package (R Development Core Team,
2008).
