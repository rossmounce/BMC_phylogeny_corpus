Highly conserved motifs in non-coding regions of
Sirevirus retrotransposons: the key for their
pattern of distribution within and across plants?

Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons are key players in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. Moreover, it is now known
that some retrotransposon classes, like the abundant and plant-specific Sireviruses, have intriguingly distinctive host
preferences. Yet, it is largely unknown if this bias is supported by different genome structures.
Results: We performed sensitive comparative analysis of the genomes of a large set of Ty1/copia retrotransposons.
We discovered that Sireviruses are unique among Pseudoviridae in that they constitute an ancient genus
characterized by vastly divergent members, which however contain highly conserved motifs in key non-coding
regions: multiple polypurine tract (PPT) copies cluster upstream of the 3’ long terminal repeat (3’LTR), of which the
terminal PPT tethers to a distinctive attachment site and is flanked by a precisely positioned inverted repeat. Their
LTRs possess a novel type of repeated motif (RM) defined by its exceptionally high copy number, symmetry and
core CGG-CCG signature. These RM boxes form CpG islands and lie a short distance upstream of a conserved
promoter region thus hinting towards regulatory functions. Intriguingly, in the envelope-containing Sireviruses
additional boxes cluster at the 5’ vicinity of the envelope. The 5’LTR/internal domain junction and a polyC-rich
integrase signal are also highly conserved domains of the Sirevirus genome.
Conclusions: Our comparative analysis of retrotransposon genomes using advanced in silico methods highlighted
the unique genome organization of Sireviruses. Their structure may dictate a life cycle with different regulation and
transmission strategy compared to other Pseudoviridae, which may contribute towards their pattern of distribution
within and across plants.

Background
Retrotransposons and retroviruses (collectively referred
as retroelements) can replicate their genomes via an
RNA intermediate and insert the copies into new chromosomal locations of the host organism [1,2]. This
‘copy and paste’ process has the potential to greatly
amplify their abundance, even over short evolutionary
timescales, enabling them to become a major component of genomes [3-5]. Unlike retrotransposons, retroviruses have additional coding capacity in the form of
an envelope (ENV) gene that allows them to enter the
extracellular space and infect other individuals. Retrotransposons lack the ENV gene and cannot escape the
cell, however they are free to reinfect their host genome.

Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons form the
most abundant transposable element type in plants, largely accounting for the vast differences in genome sizes
[6]. Small genome plants like Arabidopsis (121 Mbp)
and rice (389 Mbp) are sparsely populated by LTR retrotransposons, 5.6% [7] and 17% [8] respectively. In contrast, the LTR retrotransposon-derived fraction of
medium/large genomes may reach up to 75% in maize
(2.300 Mbp) [9,10] and 70% in barley (5439 Mbp) [11].
The two main superfamilies of LTR retrotransposons
are the Ty1/copia (Pseudoviridae) and Ty3/gypsy (Metaviridae) [12], which differ in the order they package
their genes in the coding domains. Both typically contain the gag gene and the pol gene region. gag encodes a
capsid protein that forms the virus-like particle (VLP),
which houses one or two RNA genomes and the
enzymes for the cytoplasmic step of reverse

transcription. pol encodes the enzymatic proteins
required for the production of the DNA copy from the
RNA template and the insertion of the new copy in the
host genome: an aspartic protease (AP), integrase (INT),
reverse transcriptase (RT) and RNaseH (RH) [13]. LTRs
flank the retrotransposon genome and contain the cisacting transcriptional regulators, the promoter and termination transcription points. The cis-acting boxes are
often recognition sites of stress-related DNA binding
factors (DBFs) and may be organized as arrays of two or
three repeated motifs (RM) in tandem [14,15]. A 5’
untranslated region (5’UTR) serves as the tether domain
between the 5’LTR and gag, while the linker domain
connects pol and the 3’LTR. At the junctions of the 5’
and 3’LTR with the internal retrotransposon genome
reside the primer binding site (PBS) and the polypurine
tract (PPT), respectively, that prime cDNA synthesis
during reverse transcription [16].
The International Committee on the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) has classified Sireviruses into the Pseudoviridae family [17] together with the Pseudovirus
and Hemivirus genera. It is the most recently described
genus named after the SIRE1 element from soybean,
and as they have colonized only plant species, they
were originally named Agroviruses [13]. Sireviruses
have putative retroviral properties, since many elements contain an ENV-like gene in their linker domain
[18], which differentiates them from the other Ty1/
copia genera (herein referred as ‘classic’ Ty1/copia elements, following the analysis of Havecker et al. 2005).
Sireviruses have successfully proliferated within plant
genomes, comprising a large proportion of the available Ty1/copia populations [19]. Examples of such elements are OPIE-2 and PREM-2 with more than
127,000 (fragmented) copies each in the maize genome, of which 3,530 and 4,093 are full length elements
respectively [9], and Osr8 that is the second most
abundant element in rice [8]. Phylogenetic analysis
based on the RT domain revealed that Sireviruses are
less diverse than classic Ty1/copia retrotransposons,
indicating a possible recent evolutionary origin and
colonization of their host genomes [20].
Sireviruses differ in the sequence and genomic organization compared to other elements. Whereas the vast
majority of plant retrotransposons encode gag and pol
as a single open reading frame (ORF), Sireviruses exhibit
variation in respect to their organization. Besides the
consensus, many elements have pol in two unusual +1
frameshifts relative to gag, of which the one suggests
novel ways of translational recoding for pol expression,
involving internal ribosomal entry or a bypass strategy
[20]. For the bypass mechanism a highly conserved
inverted repeat (IR) at the gag/pol boundary may provide a favorable secondary structure at the RNA level.

Sireviruses also have a much larger gag gene compared
to classic retrotransposons, which is characterized by a
central RNA-binding CCHC zinc knuckle and a downstream predicted coiled-coil domain [13,18]. The larger
capsid protein interacts with the plant Light Chain 8
protein family, which can bind to cargo like cellular proteins and aid their transportation, suggesting it may
facilitate VLP assembly or movement towards the
nucleus. So far, the evolutionary history of Sireviruses,
their life cycle and why they are so successful in invading plant genomes remains unclear.
In this study, the in depth comparative analysis of
Pseudoviridae genomes enabled the identification of several short but highly conserved sequence motifs in the
otherwise diverse Sirevirus genome. The motifs are
found in key regions of the non-coding genome, regions
which are necessary for the activation, reverse transcription and integration of the element, or even its virulence
capacity through the expression of the ENV gene. Interestingly, one of the motifs is semi-conserved in classic
retrotransposons, implying a global fundamental role of
its function. Our results suggest that Sireviruses are an
ancient retrotransposon lineage that maintains core
domains with absolute or high similarity. These domains
appear to attribute novel features to the Sirevirus life
cycle and may partially explain their distribution within
and across plants.

Results
Sireviruses represent an ancient Ty1/copia genus

In order to establish a representative dataset for the
comparative sequence analysis of Pseudoviridae, 21 Sireviruses were collected from various monocot and
eudicot species including (Table S1 in Additional file
1): the five elements in the ICTV Sirevirus database
(OPIE-2, PREM-2, SIRE1-1, ToRTL1, Endovir1-1); retrotransposons previously identified as Sireviruses, such
as Osr7, Osr8, Osr9, Osr10 from rice [8], HOPIE from
maize [21], Lotus2 from lotus, and one element each
from sorghum, medicago and citrus [18,22]; plus Tnd1 from tobacco [23], one Vitis vinifera retrotransposon
and the Maximus lineage recently reported by Wicker
and Keller (2007) that are re-classified as Sireviruses
during this work. The classic Ty1/copia retrotransposon population consisted of 30 elements (25 from
plants and five from other organisms), representing the
other two genera that make up the Pseudoviridae
family: 26 Pseudoviruses and four Hemiviruses (Table
S1 in Additional file 1). Phylogenetic analysis based on
the RT segment, which includes the 5th to 7th RT conserved domains [24] and continues through RH to the
end of pol, separates the Sireviruses in a distinct clade
with 100% bootstrap support (Figure S1 in Additional
file 2). The relative shorter branch lengths of the

Bousios et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:89

Sirevirus clade compared to the other retrotransposons
are in broad agreement with previous RT phylogenetic
analyses [20], suggesting the recent colonization of
their host genomes.
Intriguingly, despite the closer evolutionary relationship than classic elements, the sequence organization of
the Sirevirus genome appears to be highly divergent, as
much as (or even more than) the genome of classic retrotransposons (Figure 1). In fact, excluding the coding
domain, the non-coding regions are more diverse in Sireviruses (Table 1), which suggests that the mutation
rates of genome change are similar or even higher in
the Sirevirus genus compared to other Pseudoviridae
retrotransposons. Consequently, the RT/RH-derived
recent evolutionary origin of Sireviruses may be plasmatic and the genus may in reality represent an ancient
lineage. Overall, the average pairwise identity of the fulllength genome of Sireviruses and classic elements is
equally low (17% and 13% respectively), whilst the Sirevirus linker domain and LTRs are extremely diverse
(Table 1). Thus, the highly conserved motifs discussed
herein are most likely not the result of general sequence
similarity within the Sirevirus genome.

Multiple identical PPTs is a unique feature of the
Sirevirus linker domain

Unsupervised discovery of sequence motifs with the use of
the TEIRESIAS pattern discovery algorithm [25] primarily
identified the downstream 3’ end of the internal domain as
the most conserved area of the Sirevirus genome, which
corresponds to the region where the PPT is located. Postdiscovery analysis, however, differentiated the area into
two discrete sub-regions, the PPT and an IR, that have different characteristics. The first motif is the 8 bp 5’AGGGGGAG-3’ sequence, which is found precisely 10 bp
upstream of the 3’LTR of all elements. TEIRESIAS
detected many identical PPT copies in the linker of every
Sirevirus, irrespective of the length of the domain or the
presence of the ENV-gene (Figure 2b and Table 2). On
average, four PPTs are found in each linker, preferentially
clustered near the 3’LTR junction (83% within 0.5 kb from
the 3’LTR). The biased multiple PPT topology is exemplified in the ENV-containing Sireviruses, where the vast
majority of upstream PPTs (56/63, 89%) reside after the
ENV-gene (Table 2). The presence of the PPTs in the linker domain is not coincidental, as the octamer is rarely
found in the rest of the Sirevirus genome (0.3/element).

classic retrotransposons. All elements have a single
terminal PPT with a wide range of sequence variation,
which does however often resemble the Sirevirus PPT
(Figure 2c and Figure 3). Three elements share the Sirevirus octamer, while 17 differ only in one nucleotide.
The most common substitutions are the conversions of
the G of the 3 rd position to a T and the A of the 7 th
position to a C.

† Classic Ty1/copia with linker domain smaller than 25 bp are not included in
the respective analysis.

We searched for variants of the 8 bp motif with no significant results, which suggests that sequence integrity is
essential and under selection. ToRTL1 and Tnd-1 are the
only two Sireviruses that show variation in their PPT
nucleotide composition compared to the consensus octamer. Nevertheless, both elements have the terminal G
replaced by an A in all their PPTs, which also points
towards strong selective pressure instead of random substitutions within the motif.
Conversely to Sireviruses, TEIRESIAS did not discover
any conserved motifs in the linker domain and 3’LTR of

The attachment site consists of a short sequence, usually a
di- or trinucleotide, between the PPT and the 3’LTR, and
the first few bases, especially the universal dinucleotide
TG, of the start of the 3’LTR. It is recognized and processed by INT during the successful insertion of the new
copy into the host genome [26]. TEIRESIAS led us to
observe that in the Sirevirus 3’LTR junction the conserved
motif includes not only the PPT octamer, but also the following four bases. In 20 elements the terminal PPT is followed by the intervening dinucleotide AT, whilst the
universal TG indicates the beginning of the 3’LTR, thus
generating the Sirevirus 5’-AT/TG-3’ attachment site (Figure 2b). The overall nucleotide identity of the combined
twelvemer is 95.7%. Interestingly, the sequence following

the upstream PPTs is highly variable, as only four octamers (out of 63) employ an AT dinucleotide, of which
none is linked with the TG motif that would create a putative functional attachment site. In contrast, classic retrotransposons have a highly variable attachment site, with
some elements lacking intervening bases between the
terminal PPT and the 3’LTR (Figure 2c and Figure 3).
A precisely positioned inverted repeat surrounds the
PPT/3’LTR junction of Sireviruses and some classic
retrotransposons

As previously mentioned, TEIRESIAS included bases
immediately upstream of the terminal PPT within the
most conserved motif of the Sirevirus genome.

Subsequent analysis revealed that this upstream region
constitutes the 3’ section of a sequence (left IR arm),
which is found inverted within the 3’LTR (right IR arm).
The IR is present in all but three elements (Osr8, Endovir1-1 and ATCopia43) and shares high nucleotide identity even between Sireviruses that colonize evolutionary
distant monocot and eudicot plant species (Figure 2b).
The main characteristic of the motif is the precise position of the left arm, which always borders the PPT octamer. The intervening ‘loop’ sequence is short in length
and consists in a 5’ to 3’ direction of the terminal PPT,
the 5’-AT/TG-3’ attachment site and the beginning of
the 3’LTR, which is diverse with large parts often
deleted. The right arm starts on average 28 bp inside

average 18 bp inside the 3’LTR. Characteristically, in elements with very short (RIRE1, Tpv2, Mosqcopia) or absent
(Art1) linker the left arm resides partially or completely in
the coding domain (nucleotides in bold, Figure 2c).

the 3’LTR. Each element contains highly similar arms
(on average 89% identity, 28 bp length), however the
sequence conservation is higher in the region surrounding the loop and decreases rapidly towards the periphery
of the motif (Figure S2 in Additional file 2). The
upstream PPTs lack an IR structure, which suggests that
any putative function of the motif is available only
through the natural PPT/3’LTR junction.
We discovered that the IR also occurs in almost half
classic retrotransposons (Figure 2c), indicating that this
structure may serve a fundamental role in the life cycle of
the Pseudoviridae. In all cases the left arm extends downstream till the beginning of the predicted PPT, which
occupies the 5’ border of the loop sequence (Figure 3).
This precise arrangement offers great support to the proposed PPT for classic retrotransposons. The IR length
within each element is considerably smaller compared to

We identified in Sireviruses a highly repeated motif with
distinctive characteristics in two key areas of the genome
of LTR retrotransposons [2], which may indicate its involvement in the regulation of Sirevirus activity. The RM is
found in 13 elements and is a Sirevirus specific feature, as
it is absent from the genome of classic retrotransposons
(Table 3). Besides being abundant in the LTRs, the existence of the ENV-gene in nine elements is intriguingly
concomitant to the presence of additional RM copies in
the linker domain (Table 3, Figure 4b and Figure S4 in
Additional file 2). In fact, the distribution of these copies
contradicts the multiple PPT topology as the vast majority
(77/79, 97%) are preferentially located upstream of the
ENV-gene (Table 2 and 3). It appears, therefore, that for
these copies the ENV-gene is the determining factor.
Moreover, in Osr10 and HOPIE there are extra copies at
the beginning of the ENV-gene, near the junction with the
linker domain. In contrast, the four Sireviruses without
the ENV-gene are simultaneously devoid of linker-based
copies. The distribution of the RMs in the Sirevirus 3’LTR
is also non-random. Most of the copies (117/127, 92%)
cluster within the upper half of each LTR, as they start
200-400 bp after the PPT/3’LTR junction and extend to
the following 300-500 bp. As much as 32 units can occur
in one element, while all Sireviruses contain at least eight
copies of their RM. The overall nucleotide conservation
within most elements is remarkable, commonly displaying
more than 85% identity (Table 3).
The sequence of all RMs is palindromic with dyad
symmetry structure (Table 3), which often characterizes
retrotransposon cis-acting transcriptional activators [14].
Besides Tnd-1, the RMs of the other Sireviruses contain
a CGG-CCG signature that forms their core structure
and generates the palindromy (Figure 4a). The highly
conserved signature comprises the absolute base of
homology, irrespective of the presence of intervening
nucleotides between the two symmetrical subunits, or
the additional sequence that participates in the symmetry. As an example, Osr10, Osr8, Vitis and Inga share
nearly identical RMs, although they have very low
sequence homology and reside in evolutionary distant
monocot and eudicot species. When we compared the
RMs against known plant cis-acting regulatory
sequences using the PLACE database [27], we mainly
recovered stress-related transcription factor recognition

sites (Table S2 in Additional file 3). Possibly then,
stress-related stimuli may regulate the Sirevirus activation, although experimental confirmation like RM:promoter:GUS fusion analysis is required to correlate the
RMs to any regulatory function.
Clusters of RMs in the LTRs and upstream of the ENVgene define the borders of predicted CpG islands

CpG islands are known to be strongly associated with
genes, as they typically occur within or close to their 5’
terminus near the transcription start site and have been
found both in vertebrates [28] and plants [29]. Their
unmethylated status has been involved with the regulation of gene expression [30]. The Sirevirus genome

seems to contain CpG islands, which are preferentially
found in the LTRs and the region upstream of or within
the 5’ domain of the ENV-gene. Of the 21 elements,
Tnd-1, Sorghum and ToRTL1 lack CpG islands, while
only twice (in pol of Osr9 and Osr8) does a predicted
island occur in a region other than the LTRs or the
ENV. Among the RM-containing Sireviruses, the RM
clusters of HOPIE, OPIE-2, PREM-2, Vitis, Barbara,
Inga and Usier are the only CpG islands in their genome, whilst one or two additional islands are present in
Osr10, Osr9, Citrus and Osr8 (Figure 4b and Figure S4
in Additional file 2). Presumably, the conserved and
high copy number CGG-CCG signature is the key motif
of the islands. In most occasions the first and last units

that they may have a role in the Sirevirus regulatory network. Excluding one very long island in the ENV region
of Usier that continues far beyond the last RM, the average 400 bp Sirevirus CpG island starts and finishes
approximately 45 bp upstream and downstream of a
RM unit, respectively. In contrast to the positional stability of the Sirevirus CpG islands that imply their functionality, most classic elements do not contain a similar
pattern (not shown). Only seven have LTR-derived
islands, whilst nine lack such a domain and 14 have
irregular conformations where CpG islands are present
in varied non-LTR locations.
A conserved TATA box lies shortly after the CpG island in
the diverse Sirevirus LTR

Another feature that differentiates Sireviruses from classic retrotransposon genomes is the presence of a conserved TATA box motif in the Sirevirus LTRs. The
promoter element 5’-cTATAA/TAT/AAg-3’, where
lower case letters represent less critical bases [31], resides
in all but two elements (Tnd-1 and ATCOPIA43) (Figure
5a) and is approximately located in the middle of each
LTR (average nucleotide identity 76%). Intriguingly, in
the RM-containing Sireviruses the TATA box occurs on
average 37 bp after the CpG island, which suggests that
the motif corresponds to an authentic promoter and the
proximal RM units may regulate its activation (Figure 4b
and Figure S4 in Additional file 2).
Conservation of the Sirevirus 5’LTR/internal domain
junction

The second most popular sequence motif of the Sirevirus genome according to TEIRESIAS is the 5’LTR/
internal domain junction that accommodates the PBS.
The highly conserved upstream junction is divided in
three subdomains that in the 5’ to 3’ direction consists

Page 8 of 14

of the universal CA end of the 5’LTR, the intervening
sequence and the PBS (Figure 5b). The Sirevirus PBS is
only 9 bp (5’-TATCAGAGC-3’), complements the 3’
end of the met tRNA, which is therefore the first primer
during reverse transcription. The sharp decrease in
sequence conservation after the ninemer implies that
Sireviruses paradoxically use only a short segment of the
tRNA molecule to prime cDNA synthesis. The intervening sequence is unusually long (5’-ATTGG-3’) and in
six elements a G replaces the T at the second position.
Consequently, the Sirevirus upstream attachment site is
the heptamer 5’-CA/ATTGG-3’, whilst over the whole
length of the 16 bp region the genus maintains 92.7%
identity. In contrast, classic elements contain a more
variable 5’LTR/PBS junction, although and due to the
common met tRNA-derived PBS in many LTR retrotransposons [32], TEIRESIAS discovered a semi-conserved
sequence motif in some elements (data not shown).
A polyC-rich integrase singal is located at the 3’ end of
the Sirevirus LTRs

The successful integration of a new retrotransposon
copy in the host genome is highly dependent on the
interactions between INT and the attachment sites of
the element [26]. However, research on retroviruses has
shown that binding specificity of INT to the viral DNA
is achieved through additional interactions that extend
at least 25 bp inwards at the 3’ end of the LTR in a
domain that is called the ‘integrase signal’ [12,33]. TEIRESIAS identified a conserved motif in this location in 17
Sireviruses. The putative Sirevirus integrase signal is
approximately 19 bp long (nucleotide identity 88.2%)
and contains a distinctive C-rich region in the central
domain that varies in size (Figure 5c). The average distance between the signal and the LTR end is 21 bp. To
our knowledge this is the first time such a motif, which
also characterizes a whole genus, is reported in the genome of LTR retrotransposons.

Sireviruses are the ‘obese’ members of the Pseudoviridae
family

A comparative analysis of the size between Sireviruses
and classic elements revealed that Sireviruses share an
exceptionally large genome that clearly differentiates
them from other Ty1/copia retrotransposons (Table 2).
So far few publications have commented on the length
of single Sirevirus elements, the most recent reporting
on the large genome of the Maximus lineage [34], ignoring however that Maximus belongs to the Sirevirus
genus. The average Sirevirus length (10.55 kb) is twice
as long as that of classic Ty1/copia elements (5.6 kb).
The difference derives from the large LTRs (1.28 kb
compared to 0.56 kb), linker domain (1.5 kb to 78 bp),
expanded gag (660 to 330 amino acids) and ENV (1.8 kb
when present). The sum of the extended regions equals
to 5.5 kb and hence matches the size difference.

Discussion
The novel in silico analysis of the Sirevirus genome and
the comparison to a group of representative classic elements provided what we believe are major insights into
the structure of LTR retrotransposons. Our data show
that Sireviruses form an ancient lineage, at least as old

Page 9 of 14

as those of other classic Ty1/copia elements. The main
characteristic of their genome is the high sequence
divergence of their large non-coding domains, which are
however full of highly conserved microdomains in key
regions (Figure 6) that indicate participation in every
step of the retrotransposon life cycle, from activation to
reverse transcription to integration in the new locus.
The position and organization of the motifs do not
seem coincidental: i) the novel RMs define CpG islands
at the ENV 5’ terminus and in the LTRs adjacent to the
TATA box, ii) the junctions contain highly conserved
PBS, PPT and attachment sites, whilst an IR accurately
surrounds the terminal PPT, iii) multiple identical PPTs
cluster next to the 3’LTR and iv) the integrase signal
occurs at the predicted domain at the 3’ end of the
LTRs. These features may be among the underlying factors that contribute towards the Sirevirus distribution in
plants.
The high conservation of the Sirevirus LTR junctions
indicates strict sequence requirements towards reverse
transcription and integration

The PPT and the pairing of the tRNA molecule to the PBS
are used as primers during reverse transcription to initiate

Figure 6 The organization of the highly conserved microdomains in the Sirevirus genome. The coloring follows the pattern of previous
figures. The conserved 16 mer of the 5’LTR/PBS junction is shown in orange, whilst the integrase signal at the 3’ terminus of the LTRs in light
blue. The size difference of Sireviruses and classic retrotransposons is approximately drawn to scale (see also Table 2).

plus and minus strand cDNA synthesis, respectively. Both
steps are followed by template switching events (or jumps)
that transfer the partial DNA fragments to the other side
of the template, so as to resume and complete cDNA
synthesis [16]. During the jumps the intervening nucleotides inbetween the 5’LTR-PBS and PPT-3’LTR junctions
are ordinarily added to the outer sides of the linear cDNA
intermediate, hence generating the attachment sites. In the
first step of integration in the new genomic location,
namely the 3’ end processing, INT recognizes and cleaves
the intervening nucleotides from the 3’ ends of the linear
cDNA, thereby preparing the new copy for nucleophilic
attack [26].
According to the TEIRESIAS algorithm the two most
conserved motifs of the Sirevirus genome are the PPT/
3’LTR and 5’LTR/PBS junctions. The extreme sequence
conservation of the two domains, which appear to be
very important for reverse transcription and integration
[2], reflects the strict sequence requirements of the Sirevirus replication strategy. Also, the presence of the integrase signal is unique among LTR retrotransposons and
suggests the tight cooperation of INT with the Sirevirus
LTRs. In contrast, the respective regions of classic elements show extensive sequence variation, although a
large proportion maintains a common PPT structure
that relates to the Sirevirus PPT octamer. We propose
that the primer for plus strand cDNA synthesis in the
majority of Pseudoviridae consists of eight bases, which
may tolerate some variability in classic elements, but is
strictly conserved in Sireviruses.
Which is the role of the multiple PPTs?

The presence of multiple PPTs within retroelements is
not unprecedented, however their role in plus strand
cDNA synthesis is unclear. One extra PPT is present in
the linkers of the ENV-containing Ty3-gypsy elements
Athila4 and Calypso [35], whilst one functional PPT has
been reported in the coding domains of Ty1 and HIV1
[36]. PPT-primed cDNA synthesis is a rapid event and
when extra PPTs occur in the coding domain, synthesis
initiates simultaneously with the natural PPT [37]. Yet,
the upstream-primed cDNA must synthesize several
kilobases of sequence and as a result it is outcompeted
by the natural PPT-primed cDNA due to kinetic competition [36]. In Sireviruses kinetic competition is unlikely
to prevent strand transfer, since the distance between
the PPTs is small. The critical parameter might be the
availability of the tRNA primer at the 3’ end of the
minus DNA strand that is utilized during the second
strand transfer to provide complementarity to the PBS
sequence at the 5’ end of the minus DNA strand. Rapid
RH degradation of the tRNA after it is copied in the
natural PPT-primed cDNA may prohibit strand transfer
from internally initiated cDNAs [36].

Page 10 of 14

The upstream PPTs also lack the correct attachment site
and the IR motif, which further obscures their functionality. The transposition ability of the retroelement is dependant on the attachment site [26]. If the PPT is not
followed by the correct signal for INT processing, the
cDNA intermediate will be unable to insert in the new
genomic location. On the other hand, the strict nucleotide
integrity of the upstream PPTs, their high copy number
and preferential clustering next to the 3’LTR point
towards selection. They may facilitate genetic recombination between the two RNA genomes in the VLP [38], or
offer a relative replication advantage to the genus [39]. In
any way, based on the fact that retrotransposons with
ENV genes contain near their 3’LTR repeats that show
similarity to PPTs, Havecker et al. (2004) proposed their
involvement in reverse transcription.
The IR can act as facilitator for the correct PPT primer
formation

Research in Ty1 has shown that the PPT sequence by
itself is not sufficient to promote correct RH processing.
Additional recognition signals in the form of secondary
structures near the PPT domain may be needed to affect
the overall conformation of the region and attract the
RH for PPT formation and subsequent DNA elongation
[37]. A highly conserved IR that forms a stem loop secondary structure, of which the 8 bp PPT retains its outmost left side, seems as the most suitable candidate for
such a recognition signal. Presumably, this configuration
preferentially ‘exposes’ the terminal PPT and renders it
accessible to RH for precise cleavage, which will automatically generate the highly conserved attachment site.
Many classic Ty1/copia elements also contain the IR,
which suggests that this motif may have a universal role
in retrotransposon life cycle.
Are the RM boxes involved in the regulation of Sirevirus
activity?

Sireviruses share highly similar versions of a novel RM,
which in conjunction to the exceptional high copy number
and flanking sequence divergence, make the conservation
remarkable. Symmetry is a frequent feature of regulatory
sequences, including box I of Tnt1 [14], an activator in the
5’UTR of Copia element [40] and the Pal elements in the
b-glucokinase promoter of neuroendocrine pancreatic, gut
and brain cells in humans and mice [41]. The position of
the boxes in the LTRs and upstream of the ENV-gene
does not seem random and they also form CpG islands
that are by default found at the 5’ side of genes regulating
their expression [29]. Interestingly, Sireviruses lacking the
boxes may have similar repeated structures, as large sections of their LTRs and upstream of the ENV are particularly CG-rich and generate CpG islands (data not shown).
Despite these unique characteristics, we could not identify

Bousios et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:89
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/89

a common binding site targeted by a single DBF. It
appears that minor variation, notably the presence of one
intervening base or a substitution in the symmetrical
motif, may confer different binding properties that may
enable interactions with different nuclear factors. Future
promoter analysis experiments could elucidate the role, if
any, of the RMs in the Sirevirus activation network.
Clues into the functionality of the envelope gene

The function of the ENV-gene in plant retroelements
has not been experimentally proven and due to the
plant cell wall its role remains highly controversial [42].
So far it has been known that ENV-containing plant retroelements express their ENV either through a spliced
ENV-like mRNA, for example splice acceptor sites have
been predicted for the Ty3-gypsy BAGY2 and Athila elements [35,43], or through stop codon suppression in
SIRE1 [44]. However, SIRE1 is an atypical Sirevirus, as
pol and ENV are separated only by a stop codon. The
sequence of the Sirevirus ENV-gene is highly variable
[18]. Peterson-Burch and Voytas (2002) hypothesized
that the Sirevirus ENV may be expressed from an internal promoter, although they were not able to identify
promoters or transcription factors-binding sites
upstream of the ENV. Our work indicates that specific
motifs, which are also the epicentre of CpG islands, may
have a regulatory role in the 5’ vicinity of ENV, which
offers support to the internal promoter hypothesis for
ENV expression, although we were not able to conclusively identify one. Intriguingly, CpG islands are predicted in the same domain for six ENV-containing
Sireviruses that lack the RM boxes, even in the pol/ENV
junction of SIRE1-1. Collectively, we believe our observations to be the first set of evidence concerning the
Sirevirus ENV expression and their potential capacity to
become virulent during their life cycle.
Are Sireviruses capable of horizontal transmission?

Sireviruses are abundant and widely dispersed in plants
[19]. Moreover, it is the only Pseudoviridae genus to
contain an ENV gene, which is hypothesized as being
funtional. Has horizontal transmission, which is a sporadic incident, aided their proliferation? Possibly as plant
viruses do, Sireviruses accumulate in the cytoplasm
within their envelope and wait for a feeding invertebrate
to ingest and transfer them to another plant [35]. If horizontal transmission has occurred at high rates, then one
would expect to frequently encounter elements with
high nucleotide similarity in diverse plant phyla, which
does not seem to be the case. However, this observation
does not rule out the possibility that horizontal transfer
can rarely happen, but when it does occur, Sireviruses
quickly colonize the new host assisted by their unique
genomic organization. Alternatively, the Sirevirus

Page 11 of 14

envelope or gag capsid may act as a retrovirus movement protein and enable VLP transport outside the cell
to infect different tissues of the same host, including
meristem or germ cells, thereby enhancing the vertical
transmission rate [45,46].
The distinctive relationship of the maize Sireviruses OPIE2 and PREM-2

The conservation of the motifs is exemplified in the closely related OPIE-2 and PREM-2 maize elements. The
alignment of their LTRs provides striking results, as the
microdomains are the only highly similar segments
amidst diverse sequences (Figure S5 in Additional file
2), often even higher than regions of pol and particularly
gag. These contradict the sequence differentiation that
has been reported for the Tnt1 superfamily and to the
best of our knowledge this is the first time such a pattern of sequence conservation is shown. The Tnt1
superfamily consists of retrotransposons with surprisingly homologous genomes that colonize species of the
Solanaceae family [47,48]. The only region that exemplifies high genomic variability is the LTR domain that
harbors the cis-acting motifs [49,50]. The sequence
divergence and evolution of the motifs has equipped the
Tnt1 superfamily with high adaptive regulatory capacity
that allowed subgroups to evolve differently and colonize new Solanaceae genomes [51,52]. It appears, therefore, that the OPIE-2/PREM-2 conservation pattern
contradicts those of the Tnt1 superfamily and implies
that the two elements may respond to the same stimuli
and have the same transmission strategy.

Conclusions
Aided by the novel computational analysis which was
orchestrated by the TEIRESIAS pattern discovery algorithm, we identified a plethora of highly conserved
motifs in specific non-coding regions of the Sirevirus
genome (Figure 6) and we hypothesized that these may
be among the factors that underlie the extensive propagation of the genus in plant species. The motifs may be
involved in the activation of the element and the ENVgene, but also influence the folding of the RNA and
DNA strands, suggesting their interaction with gag and
the pol enzymes during VLP assembly, reverse transcription and integration. Based on the extreme sequence
divergence outside the coding domain, we proposed that
Sireviruses form an ancient lineage, which challenges
previous research that argued in favour of the young
evolutionary origin of the genus. Amidst their diverse
non-coding genome, strict functional pressures apparently act on the motifs to maintain their sequence integrity. The degree of conservation is astonishing, as the
Sirevirus elements of our dataset reside in plant species
that diverged 140-150 Mya (monocots/dicots) [53].

Bousios et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:89
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/89

As vast sequence data become available from wholegenome sequencing projects, the findings of this work
should enable the detailed analysis of how Sireviruses
interact with their plant hosts and shape their genomes,
towards which the fact that Sireviruses inhabit only
plants may have important implications. While our
knowledge on the evolutionary depth, distribution and
genomic organization of Sireviruses will expand, more
informed functional analysis of the herein introduced
motifs will elucidate how and why the Sirevirus life
cycle differs from other retrotransposons. In light of
such knowledge, in the modern era of large-scale transcriptome analysis, and in possession of new evidence
for the major influence of retrotransposon acticity on
the cell transcriptional output (alternative promoters,
noncoding RNAs, bidirectional transcription) [54,55], we
should be able to move closer to elucidating the role of
Sireviruses in the epigenetic regulation of plant genes
[56]. Finally, based on recent models that propose transposable elements as being major suppliers of cis-regulatory elements to host genomes [57], Sireviruses with
their novel type of RM may have been involved in the
evolution of plant gene regulatory networks.

Methods
Ty1/copia datasets

The Sirevirus and classic retrotransposon datasets were
constructed by retrieving sequences from various
sources. The information for each element, including
the source, host species and Pseudoviridae genus is provided (Table S1 in Additional file 1). The Pseudoviridae
classification according to the ICTV database can be
found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/
00.097.htm. The raw sequence data (where all the conserved motifs are highlighted) of our Sirevirus database
is available at http://bat.ina.certh.gr/downloads/Sirevirus_sequence_data.doc.
Sequence analysis tools

Multiple alignments were carried out using ClustalW at
default parameters [58] and the Jalview multiple alignment editor [59] from the EBI website http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/. MEGA4 [60] was used to construct the phylogenetic tree using the neighbor-joining distance method
[61]. Bootstrap test of phylogeny was calculated based
on 1000 replicate trees and the evolutionary distances
were computed using the Poisson correction model [62].
The RT-RH peptide alignment used for the analysis is
provided (Additional file 4). Identification of the RM
boxes and the IR were aided by the Tandem Repeat Finder [63] and Inverted Repeat Finder algorithms [64],
respectively, available at the Laboratory for Biocomputing and Informatics http://tandem.bu.edu/tools.html.
The RMs were compared against known plant cis-acting

Page 12 of 14

regulatory sequences in the PLACE database [27,65], in
order to identify target sites of DBFs. Finally, CpG
islands were predicted using the CpGplot package [66]
from the EBI website.
TEIRESIAS pattern discovery algorithm

Discovery of sequence motifs was performed with the
use of the TEIRESIAS algorithm [25]. Importantly,
TEIRESIAS is guaranteed to report all maximal patterns
(i.e. patterns that cannot be made more specific and still
keep on appearing at the exact same positions within
the input sequences, or else non-redundant patterns)
meeting the structural restrictions set by the user
through parameters. In other words, no heuristics are
employed in the discovery process. The complete set of
parameters of TEIRESIAS used in this analysis is as follows: nucleotides in the pattern (-l), number of overlapping characters in the convolved pattern (-c), maximum
length of an elementary pattern (-w), minimum number
of appearances of the pattern (-k), flag for the support k
to be the minimum number of sequences in which a
pattern should appear (compared to the minimum number of instances of the pattern) (-v). Several sets of
values for l, w, and k were used to obtain a comprehensive picture of the conservation of motifs in the input
and this information was used critically and in context
to produce the final observations.
