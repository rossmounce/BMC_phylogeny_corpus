Abstract
Background: From 2001-2003 monodon slow growth syndrome (MSGS) caused severe economic losses for Thai
shrimp farmers who cultivated the native, giant tiger shrimp, and this led them to adopt exotic stocks of the
domesticated whiteleg shrimp as the species of cultivation choice, despite the higher value of giant tiger shrimp.
In 2008, newly discovered Laem-Singh virus (LSNV) was proposed as a necessary but insufficient cause of MSGS,
and this stimulated the search for the additional component cause(s) of MSGS in the hope that discovery would
lead to preventative measures that could revive cultivation of the higher value native shrimp species.
Results: Using a universal shotgun cloning protocol, a novel RNA, integrase-containing element (ICE) was found in
giant tiger shrimp from MSGS ponds (GenBank accession number FJ498866). In situ hybridization probes and RTPCR tests revealed that ICE and Laem-Singh virus (LSNV) occurred together in lymphoid organs (LO) of shrimp
from MSGS ponds but not in shrimp from normal ponds. Tissue homogenates of shrimp from MSGS ponds yielded
a fraction that gave positive RT-PCR reactions for both ICE and LSNV and showed viral-like particles by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Bioassays of this fraction with juvenile giant tiger shrimp resulted in retarded growth
with gross signs of MSGS, and in situ hybridization assays revealed ICE and LSNV together in LO, eyes and gills.
Viral-like particles similar to those seen in tissue extracts from natural infections were also seen by TEM.
Conclusions: ICE and LSNV were found together only in shrimp from MSGS ponds and only in shrimp showing
gross signs of MSGS after injection with a preparation containing ICE and LSNV. ICE was never found in the
absence of LSNV although LSNV was sometimes found in normal shrimp in the absence of ICE. The results suggest
that ICE and LSNV may act together as component causes of MSGS, but this cannot be proven conclusively
without single and combined bioassays using purified preparations of both ICE and LSNV. Despite this ambiguity, it
is recommended in the interim that ICE be added to the agents such as LSNV already listed for exclusion from
domesticated stocks of the black tiger shrimp.

Background
The term of monodon slow growth syndrome (MSGS)
has been used by Thai shrimp farmers to refer to
unusual retarded growth that has occurred in cultivated
P. monodon since 2002. It has been suggested that an
infectious agent may be the cause [1]. This contention
was supported by the rapid spread of the problem and
preliminary laboratory challenge tests showing that

membrane-filtered (i.e., bacteria-free) tissue extracts
from MSGS shrimp were able to cause MSGS when
injected into P. monodon but not when injected into
P. vannamei [2]. Thai researchers adopted a case definition to distinguish ponds exhibiting MSGS from ponds
exhibiting slow growth caused by other problems [1].
According to this case definition, an MSGS pond must
show a coefficient of size variation ≥35% together with
freedom from hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV) (also
called Penaeus monodon densovirus [3]) or any other
severe hepatopancreas infection, plus any 3 of the following 5 characters: 1) unusually dark color, 2) average

daily weight gain of less than 0.1 g/day at 4 months, 3)
unusually bright yellow markings, 4) “bamboo-shaped”
abdominal segments, and 5) brittle antennae. These features distinguish MSGS from stunted growth caused by
monodon baculovirus (MBV) (also called Penaeus
monodon polyhedrovirus [4]) or HPV [5,6].
An earlier survey revealed no correlation between the
presence of several known shrimp pathogens [including
infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus
(IHHNV), also called Penaeus stylirostris densovirus [3]]
and the problem of MSGS ponds [7]. The results suggested that a new pathogen might be the cause of
MSGS. Separation of the purported agent from shrimp
tissue homogenates has been difficult because of the
presence of one or more known viruses and because
bioassays require long incubation times of up to 1
month or more before results can be assessed. Therefore, we adopted a general “shot-gun” strategy to screen
MSGS cases for the presence of unknown pathogens [1].
Briefly, it consisted of obtaining shrimp from MSGS
case ponds followed by preparation of “viral” extracts
for fractionation by gradient centrifugation. The resulting bands were removed and used for total nucleic acid
extraction before shotgun cloning of cDNA prepared
using random hexamer primers. Since total nucleic acid
was used as the template, both RNA and DNA were
amplified. Clones that hybridized with labelled, total
DNA from normal P. monodon were eliminated and
negative hybridization clones were sent for sequencing.
Clones identified by Blast analysis to contain sequences
of shrimp or previously screened pathogens were discarded, and remaining clones were used for in situ
hybridization assays with shrimp from MSGS ponds and
from normal growth ponds.
Using this strategy, one new RNA virus (LSNV) was
identified [1] but its presence in shrimp was not
initially correlated with the occurrence of MSGS
ponds. However, subsequent work revealed that
stunted shrimp from MSGS ponds gave strong in situ
hybridization reactions for LSNV in retinal lesions that
were not present in large shrimp from MSGS ponds or
in shrimp from normal growth ponds that gave positive RT-PCR reactions for the presence of LSNV [8].
This led to the conclusion that LSNV was a necessary
but not sufficient cause of MSGS and suggested that
another factor(s) must be combined with LSNV to
cause MSGS. One possibility for the additional factor
was another pathogen(s). To examine this possibility,
the shotgun strategy was used for further screening of
shrimp from MSGS ponds. As a result, a unique clone
was discovered that contained an integrase domain and
that appeared to arise from RNA of viral-like particles
present in tissue homogenates of shrimp from MSGS
ponds.

Results
Density gradient separations from tissue homogenates

Based on previous work suggesting that the causative
agent(s) of MSGS were viral in nature [2], the gills of
shrimp from MSGS ponds were subjected to homogenization and sucrose density gradient centrifugation that
yielded several bands in the range of 10-50% (w/w)
sucrose (not shown). Each band was collected separately
and subjected to a second step of purification using
10-40% (w/w) CsCl gradients. Fractions of the single
bands obtained from CsCl gradients were placed on
coated grids and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) at pH 7.4 for transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). This process revealed that a band at
20-25% (w/w) CsCl gave presumptive viral-like particles.
A third round of gradient separation yielded a distinct
band at 21% CsCl (buoyant density 1.1843 g cm -3 )[9]
(Figure 1A). TEM of negatively-stained samples from
this band revealed the presence of viral-like particles in
two diameters of approximately 25 nm and 15 nm and
with rounded to angular shapes indicating possible icosahedral morphology (Figure 1B). These were similar in
size and shape to those seen by TEM in tissue sections
of stunted shrimp from MSGS ponds (Figure 2).
Shotgun cloning and screening for unknown,
non-shrimp clones

From a total of 180 clones obtained from shotgun cloning of the nucleic acid extract from the 21% CsCl density gradient band, 31 did not hybridize with labeled
DNA from normal shrimp in dot-blot hybridization
assays, and these were selected for nucleic acid sequencing. Partial sequencing from both ends revealed that 10
clones contained shrimp sequences and 4 bacterial
sequences. These clones were not studied further.

approximately 25 nm diameter (arrow 1) and 15 nm in diameter
(arrow 2).

Of the 17 remaining clones, CLUSTAL W analysis of
insert end-sequences revealed that all contained common sequence regions. Thus, 2 of the largest inserts of
approximately 2.2 kb called B004 (2250 bp) and C010
(2223 bp) were subjected to single-pass sequencing.
This revealed that the sequence of C010 fell completely
within the sequence of B004. Primers were designed
based on the consensus sequence for C010/B004 to produce amplicons of 397 bp from the 5’ end (Probe 1),
642 bp from the middle (Probe 2) and 399 bp from the
3’ end (Probe 3) (Table 1) of the sequence using PCR
and RT-PCR amplification with DNase-treated and
RNase-treated total nucleic acid extracts from the 21%
CsCl band. The expected amplicons were obtained only

Page 3 of 15

by RT-PCR from the DNase-treated RNA extract
(Figure 3A). An additional RT-PCR reaction was carried
out using the forward primer of Probe 1 and the reverse
primer of Probe 3 to obtain a predicted amplicon of
1958 bp (Figure 3B) that was cloned and sequenced
from both strands. All the data was combined to obtain
the final consensus sequence of 2233 bp shown in
Figure 4 (GenBank accession number FJ498866). This
was subjected to a Blastn search that revealed no significant identity to known nucleic acid sequences except
for 100% identity in 46 bases near the 3’ end of the
sequence with thrombospondin of Penaeus (Marsupenaeus) japonicas (GenBank AB121211). A frame +1
translation of the 2233 bp sequence yielded a single
uninterrupted sequence of 744 deduced amino acids
that had no known homology to any protein or translated protein sequence at GenBank except for an integrase protein of bacteriophage SH046 of Acinetobacter
johnsonii (E value 1 × e-4) near the 3’ end, but at low
identity (29%). The deduced amino acids at positions
1894-2025 (44 amino acids) in the C-terminal portion of
the sequence had homology to a conserved domain for
phage integrases and DNA breaking enzymes in the
DNA_BRE_C family, as outlined in grey in Figure 4 and
shown in alignment with similar sequences in Figure 5.
Thus, for convenience, the sequence in Figure 4 was
called an integrase containing element (ICE). The acronym ICE as used herein should not be confused with
that used for “integrating and conjugative elements
(ICEs)” in bacteria [10]. Our several attempts to extend
the ICE sequence by either 3’ or 5’ RACE failed.
LSNV also in the 21% CsCl gradient band

Total nucleic acid extracts from the 21% CsCl gradient
band also gave positive RT-PCR reactions for LSNV.
Attempts to remove LSNV reactivity by further density
gradient centrifugation failed. Therefore, it is important

tests consisted of a mixture of at least LSNV and ICE.
In addition to LSNV, the extract was tested and found
negative for IHHNV by PCR.

shrimp from MSGS ponds resulted in positive results
for both LSNV and ICE (Figure 6).

Northern blot of RNA from the 21% CsCl gradient band

When parallel tissue samples from shrimp showing
positive hybridization with ICE probes were subjected to
examination by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), non-enveloped, icosahedral viral-like particles
approximately 25 nm and 15 nm diameter were seen,
similar to those previously shown for samples from
MSGS ponds (Figure 2).

When RNA extracted from the 21% CsCl gradient band
was subjected to northern blot analysis using ICE probe
3, a positive hybridization signal at approximately 3.0 kb
was obtained for ICE, while no signal was detected in
the RNA extracted from SPF shrimp (Additional file 1).
PCR screening for ICE and LSNV in shrimp
from MSGS ponds

When one-step RT-PCR protocols for ICE Probe 3 and
for LSNV were used with template RNA extracted from
gills of shrimp from ponds that fit the MSGS case
definition, it was revealed that most of the shrimp tested
gave positive reactions for both LSNV and ICE
(Table 2). By contrast, domesticated P. monodon specimens in families with no history of association with
MSGS and shrimp from normal growth ponds were
always negative for ICE even though some were positive
for LSNV (not shown).

In an attempt to fulfil Koch’s postulates as modified by
Rivers (1937), two challenge tests were carried out. In
the first challenge, primary inoculum was prepared from
the original 21% CsCl gradient band and injected into
juvenile P. monodon that were maintained for 60 days
before analysis and also for preparation of inoculum
(using the same protocol used to prepare the primary
inoculum) for a second challenge test. In the second
challenge test, the secondary inoculum was injected into
a second set of test shrimp, also maintained for 60 days
before analysis. The size of the domesticated shrimp
used for the first challenge was 5.132 ± 0.767 g while
that for the second was 5.633 ± 0.798 g. Some of the
stock shrimp were positive for LSNV by RT-PCR (i.e.,
15% of the first challenge stock and 20% of the second
challenge stock).

At the end of 60 days in the first challenge experiment, there was no significant difference in survival
between the test (61.4%) and control (64.3%) groups.
One-step or nested RT-PCR (Table 3) revealed that all
test and many control shrimp (50%) were positive for
LSNV by nested RT-PCR, although the overall LSNV
reactions tended to be more prevalent (100% vs 50-60%)
and stronger (i.e., more 1-step PCR positive) than those
from the control shrimp when using the same amount
of total RNA template. By contrast, only the test shrimp
were positive for ICE by either one-step or nested RTPCR. With respect to other parameters, there were no
significant differences (p > 0.05) in mean length, weight
or survival between the test and control shrimp

although the means for weight and length in the test
group were lower than those in the control groups
(Additional file 2) and the statistics software package
advised caution in interpreting the negative t-test results
because the power for the tests was low (i.e., 0.05 to
0.01 compared to the desired value of 0.8). In addition,
the test group showed a greater tendency for abnormally
dark coloration and brittle antennae than did the
control group.
At the end of 60 days in the second challenge
experiment, there was again no significant difference in
survival between the test (75.0%) and control (78.6%)
groups. As with the first test, there was a tendency for
abnormally dark coloration and brittle antennae in the
test but not the control group (Figure 7). Also, one-step
or nested RT-PCR (Table 3) revealed that all of the test
shrimp and many of the control shrimp were positive
for LSNV by nested RT-PCR, while only the test shrimp
were positive for ICE by either one-step or nested RTPCR (as in the first challenge experiment). However, in
the second challenge experiment, the test group had significantly lower mean weight (p = 0.001), weight gain (p
= 0.032), length (p = 0.001) and length gain (p = 0.001)
than the control group (Table 4).
In situ hybridization tests with experimentally
challenged shrimp

An arbitrary selection of 5 shrimp each from the control
and test groups from the second challenge experiment
was subjected to in situ hybridization assays for ICE and
LSNV. Because of the previously described link between
LSNV retinopathy and MSGS, the assays focused on tissues of the eyes and eyestalks in addition to the LO and
gills. Results for the LO and gills showed that control
shrimp positive for LSNV by RT-PCR gave positive
hybridization results in the cell cytoplasm for LSNV
only (not shown), while those negative by RT-PCR gave
negative hybridization results for both ICE and LSNV
(Additional file 3). By contrast, the test shrimp gave
positive hybridization results in the cell cytoplasm of LO
cells for both ICE and LSNV (Figure 8 and Additional
file 4). The fluorescence for both probes was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, did not completely overlap
and was most intense in normal LO tubules, as opposed
to LO spheroids. The eyes of both test and control
shrimp showed no retinopathy, but those of the control
shrimp that tested either negative or positive for LSNV
were negative for both LSNV and ICE (Additional file 5)
while test shrimp showed positive in situ hybridization
reactions for both ICE and LSNV (Figure 9). These
results supported the previously described link between
retinopathy and LSNV [8]. In addition to the LO and
eyes, gills of the test shrimp only were also positive for
both ICE and LSNV (Figure 10).

Discussion
The nature of ICE

Here we have shown the presence of an integrase containing element (ICE) that is located together with
Laem-Singh virus (LSNV) in the cytoplasm of cells of
the lymphoid organ (LO), gills and the sub-retinal, fasciculated zone of the eyes of black tiger shrimp exhibiting
gross signs of disease referred to as monodon slow
growth syndrome (MSGS). Since ICE was isolated from
a density gradient band derived from gill tissue homogenates of shrimp from an MSGS pond and since the

gradient band contained two sizes of viral-like particles
(approximately 25 and 15 nm diameter) it is possible
that ICE originated from these particles. Since the
extracts containing ICE also contained genomic material
from LSNV, and since the diameter of unenveloped
LSNV particles has been estimated at approximately 27
nm from thin tissue sections [1], it is reasonable to suggest that ICE may have originated from the particles 15
nm in diameter. If so, the positive RT-PCR reactions
indicated that the particles contained the ICE fragment
in the form of RNA. Although this is reminiscent of

extra small virus (XSV) that has been described from
the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii
[11] as a possible satellite virus [12,13], the ICE
sequence shared no significant identity to the XSV genome sequence or any other known satellite virus
sequence. Nor does the XSV genome or other known
satellite genomes contain integrase genes [14]. Similarly,
the ICE sequence showed no significant homology to
the genomes of unenveloped RNA viruses with integrase
genes that can be found in the families Pseudoviridae
[15] and Metaviridae [16] that are related to enveloped
viruses in the family Retroviridae [17]. In the Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae viral-like particles are sometimes
produced in insect hosts, but the ones reported are
much larger than 15 nm. In addition, phylogenetic comparisons among the reverse-transcribing viruses are
usually based on their reverse transcriptase (RT)
sequences and the lack of an RT sequence from ICE
made such a comparison impossible. ICE also contained
no group-specific antigen-like (gag-like) sequence for
structural proteins, another common feature of viral-like
members of the families Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae.
If the problem of unsuccessful 3’ and 5’ RACE reactions
could be resolved with ICE, RT and gag sequences
might be revealed and allow standard phylogenetic comparisons. On the other hand, the northern blot result
indicated that the full size of the RNA fragment containing the ICE target sequence was not a great deal larger than the ICE clone raising the question as to
whether it would be sufficiently large to contain RT and
gag sequences. Although ICE clearly contained an integrase domain with a conserved catalytic triad H-R-H

clearly visible in the combined image d). Negative control images from a normal shrimp specimen are shown in Additional file 3.

and a conserved tyrosine (Y) in a binding region that
may be involved in host genome insertion [18,19], the
44 amino-acid integrase domain showed homology only
to integrases or recombinases of bacteria and bacteriophages and not viral-like members of the families Pseudoviridae and Metaviridae. This is also problematic.
One might ask whether the ICE sequence arose from
bacteria in the shrimp homogenates. We believe this to
be unlikely since inspection by light microscopy and
TEM revealed no bacteria in the parallel tissue sections

that were positive for ICE by in situ hybridization. Thus,
the nature of ICE and its phylogenetic relationship to
other viral-like entities known to occur in invertebrates
is an enigma.
Association of ICE with LSNV and MSGS

Despite the uncertainty regarding the nature and phylogenetic relationships of ICE, we have shown that there
is a strong tendency for it to be associated with LSNV
in shrimp samples from MSGS ponds, and in shrimp

challenged with inoculum from a density gradient band
derived from tissue homogenates of shrimp from MSGS
ponds. Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis
revealed that ICE and LSNV occur together in LO and
eyestalk tissues previously shown to give positive reactions for LSNV in stunted shrimp from MSGS ponds
(Pratoomthai et al., 2008). In no case were shrimp
found that were positive for ICE in the absence of
LSNV. Since LSNV was proposed to be a necessary but
insufficient cause of MSGS based on its association with
retinal lesions only in small shrimp from MSGS ponds,
the co-association of ICE with LSNV in such lesions
suggests that it may also be causally linked to MSGS.

Although the inability to clearly separate ICE from
LSNV for laboratory challenge tests makes it difficult to
prove this causal relationship, our results using inoculum positive for ICE and LSNV to challenge shrimp
already positive for LSNV did support the argument
that they may be co-causes of MSGS. This is because
the control shrimp already infected with LSNV did not
show retarded growth, darkening or in situ positive retinal tissues that were seen in the challenged shrimp,
even though the LO of the control shrimp were positive
for LSNV. It is true that the ICE and LSNV positive
reactions in the test shrimp were not associated with
retinal lesions in our challenge tests, but this may have

been due to the age of the shrimp at the time of challenge or other experimental parameters that differed
from those in shrimp ponds. In addition, it cannot be
ruled out that the inoculum contained yet another virallike agent(s) that was not identified but moved together
with LSNV and ICE. Thus, final proof that LSNV and
ICE are causally associated with MSGS will probably
have to await the advent of infectious clones of ICE and
LSNV so that perfectly controlled single and dual challenge tests can be carried out. Unfortunately, complete
sequences of neither ICE nor LSNV are yet available.

Conclusions
An ICE clone was derived from a process of differential
centrifugation that would have eliminated bacteria from
the final CsCl gradient, and the gradient band contained
no bacterial cells. The nucleic acid clone derived from
that band had no sequence identity to any known bacterium, and PCR and RT-PCR tests with that nucleic
acid revealed that the clone arose from RNA, not DNA.
Further, an in situ hybridization probe derived from that
sequence gave positive hybridization results in the cytoplasm of cells of the lymphoid organ and eyes of shrimp
where no bacterial cells were seen by either light microscopy or by electron microscopy, but where viral-like
particles were seen by electron microscopy. Finally, the
inoculum for the challenge trials was prepared with
ultrafiltration steps that would have removed bacterial
cells. Altogether, we may conclude that the ICE element
is not from a bacterium, but that its nature remains elusive. Despite this ambiguity, we found that ICE occurred
together with LSNV only in shrimp from MSGS ponds
and only in shrimp showing gross signs of MSGS after
injection with a preparation containing ICE and LSNV.
ICE was never found in the absence of LSNV although
LSNV was sometimes found in normal shrimp in the
absence of ICE. This association between ICE and
LSNV suggests that they may act together as component
causes of MSGS. However, conclusive proof that they
cause MSGS is not possible without single and combined bioassays using purified preparations of both ICE
and LSNV.
Since the discovery of LSNV in 2006, it has been
added to the list of viruses to be excluded from domesticated, specific pathogen free (SPF) stocks of Penaeus
monodon in Thailand and it has been recommended
that shrimp farmers avoid stocking post larvae RT-PCR
positive for LSNV to avoid MSGS. In the same way, we
recommend that ICE be added to the list of excludable
agents in development of SPF stocks, since it is not
highly prevalent in wild stocks of P. monodon that
might be sourced as founders for such stocks. In addition, the availability of RT-PCR methods makes it possible to carry out continual monitoring in research

Page 12 of 15

programs to determine whether there is a positive
correlation between MSGS and simultaneous presence
of LSNV and ICE in cultivated P. monodon.

Methods
Natural and experimental shrimp for viral isolation and
histology

Live shrimp from a shrimp pond that fit the MSGS case
definition were obtained from Laem-Singh district
Chanthaburi province, on the eastern coast of Thailand
on 20 th August 2004. The mean shrimp weight was
approximately 13 g (i.e., 77 shrimp per kg) and the CV
was 46% CV at 120 days cultivation (average daily
weight gain of 0.1 g/day). A total of 5 kg were collected.
Most of the gills were removed from the living shrimp
for immediate homogenization and gradient centrifugation, but some were fixed, together with the remaining
body for normal histological examination by light
microscopy [20]. Other, small samples were fixed for
transmission electron microscopy [1].
Transmission electron microscopy

Natural or experimental shrimp were stunned in ice
water, dried with a towel and surface sterilized using
70% ethanol before aseptic dissection and removal of
tissues for cutting into small pieces and washing with
0.15 M Millonig’s phosphate buffer (40 mM NaH2PO4,
100 mM Na2HPO4, 170 mM NaCl, 15 mM sucrose, pH
7.4). The pieces were prefixed with 4% glutaraldehyde in
0.15 M Millonig’s buffer at 4°C overnight, and then
post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in the same buffer at 4°C for 1 h
prior to being processed routinely for conventional
embedding in Spurr’s resin. Ultrathin sections were
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before
viewing with a Hitachi H-500 transmission electron
microscope at 75 kV.
Inoculum stock preparation

Pooled gills were collected from natural or experimental
living shrimp and stored in separate cryotubes under
liquid nitrogen. Following rapid thawing, gill samples
were homogenized in TN buffer (0.02 M Tris-HCl, 0.4
M NaCl, pH 7.4) using a glass homogenizer. The resulting suspension was clarified 3 times by first-round centrifugation at 600 g for 10 min at 4°C. The first pellet
obtained was resuspended in TN buffer, re-homogenized, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,500 g. The
second pellet was re-homogenized and centrifuged for
30 min at 16,000 g. The 3 resulting supernatants were
pooled and the whole was ultracentrifuged at 220,000 g
for 2 h. The pellet obtained was resuspended after overnight incubation in TN buffer and layered on a 10 to
50% (w/w), sucrose gradient for centrifugation at
200,000 g for 6 h.

Panphut et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:18
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/7/18

Each fraction containing presumptive viral particles
was diluted in TN buffer and re-centrifuged at 300,000
g for 2 h before the pellet was re-suspended again after
overnight incubation in TN buffer. The final purification
was performed by layering the pellet fraction onto a 10
to 40% (w/w) CsCl gradient and centrifuging at 200,000
g for 18 h. The bands obtained (presumptive viruses)
were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 g for 2 h
and pellets were dissolved in TN buffer for further tests.
Viral nucleic acid extraction and amplification for shotgun cloning

Total nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) was extracted from
each band collected from the initial sucrose gradient
separation using a High Pure viral nucleic acid kit
(Roche, USA). For RNA extraction, samples were homogenized in Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA from
the suspension was then purified using a Perfect RNA
kit (Eppendorf, Germany). The first and second strand
cDNA synthesis was carried out using the total nucleic
acid extract as template and following the recommended
protocol of a Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (BD
Biosciences, Clontech Inc. USA).
Target templates (containing cDNA plus DNA from
the original extract) were amplified by touch-down PCR
with an Advantage 2 Polymerase mix that included
TaqStart Antibody for hot start PCR combined with
Marathon kit primers that included an adaptor sequence
for later cloning, as described in the system Advantage®2
PCR enzyme user manual (Clontech).
Cloning and screening by blot hybridization

Direct cloning was achieved using either a TOPO T/A
cloning kit (Invitrogen, USA) or a pGEM-T Easy
(Promega, USA) cloning kit as directed by the manufacturer. Selected clones were screened by colony blots and
dot-blot hybridization as previously described [1] using
DIG-labelled total DNA extracted from healthy shrimp.
Briefly, detection was performed with an alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche) at
dilution of 1: 5000. Promising candidate clones (i.e., negative hybridization with the shrimp probe) were selected
based on comparison to a negative control derived from
plasmid DNA that produced a colorless dot.
In situ hybridization

Tissues of specimens originating from MSGS ponds or
experimental challenge tests and embedded in paraffin
blocks were sectioned (5 μm) and subjected to in situ
hybridization assays using candidate fluorescein-labelled
probes selected for negative hybridization with shrimp
DNA and lack of significant sequence identity with
shrimp sequences or known pathogen sequences at
GenBank. Random primed DNA labeling for LSNV was

Page 13 of 15

achieved following the protocol of a PCR fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) Fluorescein-High prime labelling
kit (Roche, Germany) using a plasmid containing a 600
bp sequence of LSNV (Table 1). Candidate clones were
labelled with a second chromophore rhodamine (tetrametyl rhodamine 5’dUTP)(Roche, Germany) in a similar
manner. Specimens tested were those transferred from
Davidson’s fixative after 24-48 h of fixation to avoid
degradation of RNA (Hasson et al 1997). In situ hybridization reactions were carried out as previously described
(Sritunyalucksana et al., 2006). Briefly, the 2 oligo fluorescein labeled probes were mixed and applied to the
specimens and incubated overnight at 42°C. The negative control comprised fluorescein without a labeled
probe. After incubation, the specimens were washed and
viewed with a confocal microscope.
Sequence analysis

The clones were sequenced on both strands by Macrogen Inc. (South Korea). Fragments larger than 500 bp
were sequenced from both ends, after which new primers were sequenced from the preliminary leads to fill
gaps for both strands. Multiple alignments were performed using the programs DNA Baser (Heracle BioSoft
S.R.L., Romania) and CLUSTAL W [21] to identify
portions with 100% overlap so that contiguous sequence
reads could be united into a single consensus sequence.
Final sequences were subjected to BLAST 2.0 analysis of
nucleic acid sequences and deduced amino acid
sequences for 6 frames [22], using programs available
online. These included nucleic acid and protein searches
using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/)
and protein domain searches using InterPro 17.0 [23]
and EMBL-EBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk).
DNase and RNase treatments

RNase A (Fermentas) and RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to determine whether the template nucleic acid for
clones of interest was DNA or RNA. The nuclease digestions were performed in 10 μl volumes using 250 ng total
nucleic acid from shrimp incubated for 30 min at 37°C.
The nucleic acid from each treatment was extracted and
purified using High Pure viral nucleic acid kits (Roche,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s direction. Nucleic
acid templates were eluted from the columns using
DEPC-treated water and used as for RT-PCR and PCR
assays with the primers shown in Table 1.
Northern blot analysis

RNA was extracted from the 21% CsCl gradient band
and subjected to 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis before blotting onto a Biodyne nylon membrane (Pall Corporation). RNA extracted from SPF

Panphut et al. BMC Veterinary Research 2011, 7:18

shrimp gills was also run in a parallel lane. The membrane
was hybridized with DIG-labelled DNA probe prepared
from ICE Probe 3. After incubation with anti-DIG
antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, hybridized
signals were detected with NBT/BCIP substrate (Roche,
Germany) according to the supplier’s protocol.

Shrimp bioassays

Penaeus monodon (5.132 ± 0.767 g, and 5.633 ± 0.798 g)
obtained from the quarantine facility of the Shrimp
Genetic Improvement Center at Chaiya in Surathani province were used for bioassays with inoculum derived
from gradient centrifugation fractions of the tissue
homogenates described above. These stocks had a history
of freedom from HPV, MBV, yellow head virus (YHV)
and WSSV for more than 6 generations. Using pleopod
samples, they were tested again and found negative for
the same viruses before challenge tests using standard
PCR detection kits (i.e., IQ2000, GeneReach, Taiwan for
YHV and WSSV and Easygene, Shrimp Biotechnology
Business Unit, National Center for Genetic Engineering
and Biotechnology, Thailand for HPV and MBV).
Although tests for HPV and MBV are often carried out
using DNA from hepatopancreatic tissues, our experience has shown that they can also be detected in DNA
extracts of pleopod samples from infected shrimp. In
addition, subsequent tissue sections prepared in parallel
with those for our in situ hybridization reactions were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin and showed no histopathology characteristic MBV or HPV in the hepatopancreas. The collected shrimp were acclimatized in the
laboratory for 5 days in 65 L aquaria containing continuously aerated artificial seawater at 15 ppt and 30 to 35°C.
There were 7 shrimp in each aquarium and 4 aquaria in
each of the challenge and control groups (i.e., a total of
28 shrimp in each group). The control shrimp were each
injected with 100 μl TN buffer only. The test shrimp
were each injected with 100 μl of a 10-6 dilution of a centrifuge fraction (21% CsCl w/w) that had been confirmed
by one step RT-PCR to be positive for ICE using the
primer set described in Table 1. The shrimp were subsequently reared for 60 days during which mortality,
appearance and size were recorded. Shrimp collected at
the moribund state were counted as dead. At 2 months
post challenge, the gills of the injected shrimp were
pooled and subjected to identical homogenization and
gradient centrifugation as previously described. The 21%
CsCl fraction was used for a repeated bioassay as
described above. At the same time, the living shrimp
from which gills had been removed were fixed as appropriate for analysis by light microscopy and TEM. Statistical analysis of shrimp weight, length and survival results
were carried out using a simple Student t-test with SigmaStat 3.5 software (copyright Systat Software 2006).
