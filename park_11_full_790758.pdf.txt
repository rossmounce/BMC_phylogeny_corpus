Abstract
Background: Many of researchers have focused on the emerging pathogen, Norovirus, since its first identification
as the causing agent of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis in humans. One of the virulence factors of norovirus, the
great genetic diversity attributed to point mutations and recombinations, has brought forth the result of significant
changes in the circulating norovirus genotype patterns.
Findings: In recognition of the necessity for tracking and monitoring of genetic diversity, a norovirus variant
among the most prevalent genotype GII-4, Norovirus Hu/GII-4/CUK-3/2008/KR (CUK-3), was isolated from stool
samples and analyzed on the level of whole genome sequence. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed three
ORF composites of the whole genome, ORF1 (5100 bp), ORF2 (1623 bp), and ORF3 (807 bp). Each genetic
relationship of CUK-3 variant analysis located the ORF1 (5,100 bp) in Cluster I, ORF2 (1623 bp) in Cluster I (2006b),
ORF3 (807 bp) in Cluster I, and the whole genome sequence (about 5.1 kb) in Cluster I in the phylogenetic tree.
And the phylogenetic analyses showed the same location of CUK-3 strain with the GII-4/2006b cluster in the
phylogenetic tree.
Conclusions: In This study, a first concerning the full-length sequence of a NoV variant in South Korea is
meaningful in that it can be used not only as a full-length NoV variant sequence standard for future comparison
studies, but also as useful material for the public health field by enabling the diagnosis, vaccine development, and
prediction of new emerging variants.

Findings
Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most important viruses that
cause nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis in humans. In
addition to increased susceptibility, the elderly are at
increased risk for more severe disease and death, as are
the very young and the immunocompromised [1,2].
They are small, and non-enveloped viruses which and
belong to the family Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus.
Noroviruses have a single positive-strand NoV RNA
genome of about 7.6 kb in size. Three open reading

frames (ORFs) have been identified in the NoV genomes. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into
six non-structural (NS) proteins, which carry amino acid
sequence motifs conserved in NTPase, protease and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [3,4]. ORF2
encodes a major structural protein, Viral Protein (VP1),
which consist of two domains-the shell domain (S) and
the protruding arm (P) that is again divided into two
subdomains, P1 and P2. The S domain is highly conserved while the P domain is variable. P2 of the P
domain is hypervariable and carries immune and cellular
recognition sites [5-7]. ORF3 encodes minor capsid protein, VP2, which is rich in basic amino acids and is proposed to have a role in viral stability [8,9]
Recently, NoVs were recognized as novel emergent
pathogens. The main route of transmission is suspected
to be person-to-person, but food and water-borne

transmission is also important [1,10,11]. According to
nucleotide sequence analysis of the capsid regions, noroviruses are classified into five genogroups, GI to GV,
each of which can be further divided into several clusters or genotypes [12]. Among the five genogroups,
three genogroups (GI, GII and GIV) are known to cause
clinical illness in humans, and genotype GII-4 has been
the predominant circulating strain to the present [13].
The error-prone RNA replication and recombination
between viruses is what drives noroviruses to its the
great diversity. Furthermore, the accumulated mutations
of the hypervariable P2 domain of the VP1 protein produced different GII-4 NoVs [14]. The most representative of the resulting variant GII-4 strain, GII-4/2006b,
with 3 nucleotide insertions in the P2 domain at position 6265, emerged in the summer of 2002 which lead
to a major gastroenteritis outbreak as well as an epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide in the winter of 2002/
2003 [15,16]. In South Korea, gastroenteritis outbreaks
by GII-4/2006b variants have been reported from September of 2007 to July of 2008 had been reported [17].
In this paper, the whole genome sequence of another
isolated variant of the emerging strain type, the GII-4
variant, was analyzed and compared with other variants
to reveal the genetic relationship and to predict the tendency of GII-4 variants in South Korea.
NoV positive-stool sample was isolated from patients
with acute gastroenteritis in Daejeon, South Korea in
November 2008. The sample was obtained from the
Waterborne Virus Bank (Seoul, Korea). The stool sample
was stored at -70°. The viral genomic RNA was extracted
from 140 μl of 10% fecal suspension with the QIAamp®
Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
For the detection of NoV, reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) was performed with the One Step RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with primers based on
the sequence of the norovirus capsid region (Table 1).
To analyze the whole genome sequence of the
detected norovirus strain, reverse transcription PCR
(RT-PCR) was performed with the One Step RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 10 pairs of newly
designed primer sets (Table 1). Ten fragments were
amplified; eight fragments for ORF1, one fragment for
ORF2, and one fragment for ORF3. The PCR products
were then analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose
gel and ethidium bromide staining. The amplified fragments were purified with HiYield™ Gel/PCR DNA
Extraction kit (RBC, Taipei, Taiwan) from the gel. Then,
the products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega, USA) and were sequenced by Genotech (Daejeon, South Korea).
Sequence data analysis of the composite sequence of
ten plasmids aligned with Clustal W method using the

DNAStar software (DNAStar Inc.) revealed that the
whole genome was composed of three ORFs, 5100 bp
(ORF1), 1623 bp (ORF2), and 807 bp (ORF3).
The dendrograms were constructed with the neighborjoining method. The nucleotide sequence data reported
in this study have been deposited into GenBank (accession number; FJ514242).
A comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid
sequences of the entire ORF2 with reference strains
showed that CUK-3 strain had the highest sequence
similarity to the NoV GII-4 reference strain X76717.
The nucleotide similarity with CUK-3 was 60.1 - 88.0%
with the reference strains. A protein database search
(BLASTX) for the product of ORF2 yielded 59.3 - 92.0%
similarity. However, the cut-off value for amino acid
similarity between the CUK-3 variant and the GII-4
reference strains showed low identity (92.0%) for the
genomic sequences (Table 2).
To analyze the genetic relationship between the CUK3 variant and the other variants reported worldwide, the
sequences of ORF sequences and the whole genome
were processed with multiple sequence alignment. Each
analysis of CUK-3 located the ORF1 (5,100 bp) in Cluster I, ORF2 (1623 bp) in Cluster I (2006b), and ORF3
(807 bp) in Cluster I as well as the whole genome
sequence (about 5.1 kb) in Cluster I (Figure 1).
As shown on the case analysis of ORF1, Cluster I contains Hiroshoma1, Kumamoto1, Saga1, Hokkaodo1,
Aomori4, Miayagi5, Akita1, Aichi3 and showed the
highest similarity range (98.0~98.9%) (Figure 1A).
As shown on the case analysis of ORF2, Cluster I
(2006b) contains emerged the GII-4 varints in Japan and
showed the highest similarity range (97.7 - 99.0%),
whereas Cluster II (2006a) showed low similarity range
(91.7 - 92.3%) (Figure 1B).
As shown on the case analysis of ORF3, Cluster I
showed the highest similarity range (97.9 - 99.3%). Interestingly, 02/03 group contains emerged the GII-4
vaiants in Europe showed more higher similarity range
(93.1 - 93.6%) than Cluster II contains emerged the GII4 variants in Japan (Figure 1C).
As shown on the case analysis of full length, the CUK3 strain showed the highest similarity (98.3%) with the
2006 epidemic strain, Aichi3/2006/JP strain, whereas
Ehime/5-30/2005/JP strain and Lordsdale/1993/UK
strain showed the lowest similarity (89.2%) (Figure 1D).
The CUK-3 strain can be placed on the same branch
of the phylogenetic tree as the GII-4/2006b cluster,
based on the nucleotide sequence of the RdRp region
and the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein (data
not shown). Also, the analysis of the GDD motif
(AANNTG) of the RdRp region of the GII-4 variants
reported worldwide indicated that the GDD motif of
CUK-3 strain was similar to that of the GII-4 variants of

the epidemic strains in 2006. These strains were common in Hong Kong, Japan, and other regions of North
East Asia during the same period [12,18]. Such similarities in analyses between CUK-3 and GII-4/2006b strain
are evidence of the reemergence of GII-4 variant.
In Europe and Asia, most norovirus outbreaks that
occurred after 2002 have been caused by GII-4 variant
strains (Figure 2). In addition, biennial emergences of
pandemic NoV GII-4 variants have been reported in
2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 [12,18,19]. These GII-4 variants have also been identified in South Korea and are
rapidly spreading worldwide.
Amino acid sequences of the capsid region encoded by
ORF2 was compared with a total of 39 GII-4 variants
reported from various countries including US, UK, Japan,
China, Germany etc. Date of 540 amino acid analyses
showed the pattern of changes of two amino acid in first
P1 domain, aa238 (S GII-4- >2002 ® T GII-4- <2002), aa250 (Y
GII-4- >2002 ® F GII-4- <2002 ). The P2 domain showed
five substitutions of amino acids, aa280 (A GII-4- >2002 ®
P GII-4- <2002), aa346 (A GII-4- >2002 ® P GII-4- <2002), aa367
(F GII-4- >1995 ® Y GII-4- >2002 ® F GII-4- <2002 ), aa376
(Q GII-4- >2002 ® E GII-4- <2002), and aa394 (G or S GII-4>2006® TGII-4- <2006). In addition, the second P1 domain

also showed two amino acid substitutions, aa459 (L GII-4>1995 ® Q GII-4- >2002) and aa504 (P GII-4- >2002 ® Q GII-4<2002). These analytic data showed that there had already
been numerous mutations, which lead to the production
of a wide range of variants, already before 2002 and produced various variants. And as shown on the case of aa394
of P2 domain which inserted novel amino acid, G or S,
and then substituted to T after 2006 (data not shown).
Although previous studies have indicated that the
sequence for the NoV capsid region is useful for the diagnosis of NoV variants, no studies have analyzed the RdRp
region of the South Korean NoV GII-4 variant. This is the
first report that describes the full-length sequence of a
NoV GII-4 variant that was isolated from clinical samples
in South Korea. We suggest that this sequence can be
used as a standard for the comparison of full-length NoV
GII-4 variant sequence with other strains.
The information acquired from whole genome
sequencing in this study can be useful not only for a
more accurate diagnoses of NoVs but also for the basic
research for the elucidation genetic functions. Furthermore, it will be helpful for the prediction of newly
appearing pandemic variants through comparison with
GII-4 variants in neighboring countries, fundamental
research for vaccine development, and eventually , for
the field of public health through with the provision of
new emerging strains of NoV.
