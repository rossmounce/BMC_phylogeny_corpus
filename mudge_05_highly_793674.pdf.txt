Abstract
Background: Recent genome sequencing enables mega-base scale comparisons between related
genomes. Comparisons between animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria demonstrate extensive synteny
tempered by rearrangements. Within the legume plant family, glimpses of synteny have also been
observed. Characterizing syntenic relationships in legumes is important in transferring knowledge
from model legumes to crops that are important sources of protein, fixed nitrogen, and healthpromoting compounds.
Results: We have uncovered two large soybean regions exhibiting synteny with M. truncatula and
with a network of segmentally duplicated regions in Arabidopsis. In all, syntenic regions comprise
over 500 predicted genes spanning 3 Mb. Up to 75% of soybean genes are colinear with M.
truncatula, including one region in which 33 of 35 soybean predicted genes with database support
are colinear to M. truncatula. In some regions, 60% of soybean genes share colinearity with a
network of A. thaliana duplications. One region is especially interesting because this 500 kbp
segment of soybean is syntenic to two paralogous regions in M. truncatula on different
chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis of individual genes within these regions demonstrates that one
is orthologous to the soybean region, with which it also shows substantially denser synteny and
significantly lower levels of synonymous nucleotide substitutions. The other M. truncatula region is
inferred to be paralogous, presumably resulting from a duplication event preceding speciation.
Conclusion: The presence of well-defined M. truncatula segments showing orthologous and
paralogous relationships with soybean allows us to explore the evolution of contiguous genomic
regions in the context of ancient genome duplication and speciation events.

phylogenetic footprinting. Recent sequenced-based studies in a variety of organisms have described high levels of
synteny (conservation of gene content and order between
species) within kingdoms and between families, but have
also highlighted frequent synteny loss and degradation
due to gene duplication, deletion, and rearrangement. In
some cases, observed synteny has been extensive. In vertebrates, over 90% of the mouse and human genomes (separated by 91 million years; My) lie in syntenic blocks
[1,2], some exceeding 40 Mb [2,3]. At a greater evolutionary distance (310 My), the human and chicken genomes
show large synteny blocks, including at least 70 Mb of
highly conserved sequence [2,4]. Regions syntenic to 1.8
Mb of human DNA were identified in twelve different species including fish, which separated from humans 450
Mya [2,5].
High levels of synteny have also been found in plant families. Molecular marker analysis has allowed chromosome-by-chromosome alignments of several genera
within the Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae [6-8]. Generally, syntenic relationships are complicated by microand macro-rearrangements as well as duplications [9].
Complete genome sequences of rice and A. thaliana, models representing the two major clades of flowering plants,
allows comparisons across a greater evolutionary distance. Separated by 200 My, rice and Arabidopsis thaliana
nonetheless retain substantial conserved syntenic blocks,
including one region spanning 119 A. thaliana genes [10].
Though genomic relationships within legumes are less
well characterized, a growing number of studies have
begun to reveal extensive synteny between the members
of this important plant family. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), substantial genome
conservation was discovered among Phasoloid species,
including mungbean (Vigna radiata) and cowpea (V.
unguiculata), extending as long as entire chromosomes
[11]. Comparable levels of synteny were later demonstrated between Vigna and the common bean, Phaseolus
vulgaris [12]. Synteny with the more distant soybean, Glycine max, was more limited, typically on the order of 10 –
20 cM. Later, Lee et al. [13] observed higher levels of conservation between bean, mungbean, and soybean, where
A. thaliana also showed conservation to some conserved
legume regions and even helped to elucidate duplicated
regions in soybean. Choi et al. [6] described genome-wide
macrosynteny among legumes using a large set of crossspecies genetic markers. Though genomic correspondence
was reduced by chromosomal rearrangements increasing
with phylogenetic distance, they could align chromosomes from a variety of Papilionoid species, including
Medicago truncatula and soybean.

M. truncatula and Lotus japonicus are two model legumes
that are now targets of large-scale genome sequencing.
With more than 100 Mb of genome sequence publicly
available in both, genome-scale comparisons at both the
macro- and micro-syntenic level are possible. Young et al
[14] compared all finished and anchored sequence
between these two genomes (111 Mb) and concluded that
more than 75% of both genomes reside in conserved, syntenic segments. At a microsyntenic scale, Choi et al. [6]
analyzed ten BAC/TAC clone pairs and found 80% of
genes were conserved and colinear. Soybean has also been
compared to M. truncatula because of its economic importance. With few sequences 100 kbp or more in length
available, however, comparisons of soybean with reference legumes have been limited to low resolution surveys
and short contiguous segments. Nevertheless, conserved
synteny is widespread between M. truncatula and soybean.
Yan et al. [15] analyzed three homologous BAC contig
groups in detail by comparative physical mapping and
cross-hybridization and found six of eight genome
regions exhibited conserved synteny, including three that
were extensively conserved. In genome-wide survey of
synteny, slightly more than half of 50 RFLP-based soybean BAC-contigs, each approximately 200 kbp in size,
exhibited conserved synteny with M. truncatula [16] and
nearly 75% of these cases were extensive.
In the course of our genome sequencing work in M. truncatula [14], two regions were observed to be significantly
conserved with previously sequenced regions of soybean.
These soybean regions contain two important soybean
cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines) resistance loci,
rhg1 and Rhg4, which have been studied extensively
reviewed in Concibido, et al. [17]. In previous work, our
lab and others localized the genetic positions of these
genes and characterized their role in resistance [18-24].
We saturated the regions with genetic markers, developed
high throughput molecular markers, created physical
maps, and characterized homoeologous and surrounding
genome regions [23,25-30]. As a result of the extensive
information available and the importance of SCN resistance, these genome regions were eventually sequenced
[31,32], including the tentative cloning of rhg1 and Rhg4
(gene 29 in Figure 1 and gene 21 in Figure 2, respectively).
A preliminary examination of the soybean rhg1 region
described in the present study concluded that nearly 70%
of genes were conserved and colinear between soybean
and M. truncatula [6]. Previously, Foster-Hartnett et al.
[29] had used survey sequences along a 1 Mb stretch that
included and extended beyond the region described here
to examine syntenic relationships with A. thaliana. Based
on survey (primarily BAC-end) sequence that included
both genic and non-genic regions, 35% of soybean
sequences were conserved in one or more syntenic A.

thaliana regions. The soybean region formed a network of
synteny with six different A. thaliana regions. The longest
syntenic segment in A. thaliana was more than 2 Mb in
length, highlighting the existence of long stretches of conserved sequence between distantly related genomes [29].
In the present study, we describe the gene content in two
soybean regions totaling approximately 1 Mb in size with
more than 150 genes [32] that exhibit extensive synteny to
M. truncatula and A. thaliana. The two soybean regions

reside on different chromosomes but are functionally
linked – each contains a receptor-like kinase gene (rhg1 or
Rhg4) tentatively identified as a resistance gene to SCN
(Heterodera glycines). Up to 75% of soybean genes in this
region are colinear with M. truncatula, including one 300
kbp segment with 33 of 35 soybean genes colinear to M.
truncatula. Nearly 60% of the genes in this same soybean
region exhibit colinearity with one or more A. thaliana
regions. These highly syntenic blocks are discussed in the

context of phylogenetic data revealing patterns of evolution and orthologous and paralogous relationships.

Results
Identifying and mapping homologous contigs
We used the Genbank soybean sequences surrounding
SCN resistance loci as a basis for searching all available M.
truncatula BAC sequences and the A. thaliana proteome for
syntenic regions (Table 1). Homologous regions were
then used to create corresponding sequence assemblies
for all three genera (Figures 1, 2). Where possible, we also
merged sequence M. truncatula assemblies by identifying
end-sequenced BACs that spanned gaps between nonoverlapping BACs. Most of the M. truncatula BACs could
be anchored to the M. truncatula genetic map (Table 1)
[33].

There is a gap in all three species between synteny blocks
1a and 1b which we were unable to span. In soybean,
these two sequence assemblies are genetically linked and
located 2 cM apart on LG-G. In addition, synteny block 1b
contained two gaps in M. truncatula (Figure 1), one a 90
kbp gap toward the bottom M. truncatula sequence assembly. This gap and its surrounding M. truncatula sequence
(totaling about 175 kbp) correspond to an insertion/deletion in soybean just 25 kbp in size and containing two
gene models without hits to Genbank's nonredundant
(nr) database along with one repetitive sequence. There is
also a gap of unknown size between the top and bottom
sequence assemblies in synteny block 1b that could not be
spanned with end sequenced BACs. In M. truncatula, the
top sequence assembly maps to M. truncatula chromosome 4, while the bottom maps to chromosome 3 (Table
1). These two M. truncatula assemblies therefore appear to
be unlinked, even though they show substantial synteny
and are apparently both orthologous (see below) to a contiguous region in soybean.
M. truncatula sequences in synteny block 2 also map to
chromosomes 3 and 4. One of the M. truncatula homoeologs in synteny block 2, Mt_2ii, maps 5–8 cM below the
M. truncatula bottom sequence assembly in synteny block
1b (Figure 1, 2, Table 1). The other M. truncatula duplicate
in synteny block 2, Mt_2i, maps to chromosome 4, more
than 25 cM from the top sequence assembly in synteny
block 1b (Figure 1, 2, Table 1).
Synteny
Soybean/Medicago truncatula synteny within synteny block 1
The soybean and M. truncatula regions in synteny block 1b
are highly syntenic, with nearly complete conservation of
orientation and order of conserved genes (Table 2, Figure
1). Seventy-five percent of soybean genes in this region
(33 of 44) have M. truncatula homologs and 59% of M.
truncatula genes (33 of 56) have soybean homologs.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/15

When this comparison is revised to include only genes
with significant matches to Genbank's nr database
(thereby eliminating potentially poor gene calls) even
more extensive levels of synteny emerge: 33 of 35 soybean
genes with nr hits (94%) have M. truncatula homologs
conserved in order and orientation. The two soybean
genes without M. truncatula homologs include the rhg1
resistance locus itself, as well as one hypothetical protein.
Both of these genes along with a soybean gene that
extends beyond available M. truncatula sequence data all
show synteny to A. thaliana. Therefore, all 36 confirmed
soybean genes in this 336 kbp region have homologs in
syntenic regions either of M. truncatula or A. thaliana.
Synteny block 1a shows lower, yet still impressive synteny. Nearly half of the genes in synteny block 1a are conserved in order and orientation. Indeed, 44% of M.
truncatula genes are conserved in order and orientation in
soybean in block 1a, increasing to 50% when only genes
with database support are considered. Of soybean genes,
37% are conserved in M. truncatula, increasing to 43% of
genes with database support.
Soybean/Medicago truncatula synteny in synteny block 2
Like block 1, extensive synteny is also evident throughout
synteny block 2 (Figure 2, Table 2). In synteny block 2,
there are two duplicated regions of M. truncatula syntenic
to soybean, Mt_2i and Mt_2ii, which flank the soybean
segment in Figure 2. The Mt_2i homoeolog and soybean
share 60% (28 of 47) of their genes. With two exceptions,
orientation is conserved between Mt_2i and soybean, and
remarkably, a run of 13 out of 13 confirmed soybean
genes are perfectly conserved in Mt_2i in the bottom portion of block 2. The corresponding soybean region
extends nearly 110 kbp (Figure 2).

The other M. truncatula homoeolog, Mt_2ii, shows synteny with soybean extending more than 300 kbp (Figure
2, Table 2). In this region, soybean shares 32% (12 of 38)
of genes and M. truncatula homoeolog Mt_2ii, 24% (12 of
50) in this syntenic region. One gene, with similarity to a
rapid alkalinization factor in Solanum chacoense, shows
synteny between soybean and Mt_2ii but appears to have
been lost from Mt_2i (Figure 2, Gm gene 34, Mt_2ii gene
18). The middle portion of synteny block 2 exhibits multiple rearrangements and duplications between soybean
and Mt_2ii (Figure 2). While much of the corresponding
Mt_2i region has not yet been sequenced, it is less than
half the size of the rearranged region in Mt_2ii/soybean
on the basis of BAC-end sequenced clones that span the
Mt_2i region.
The Mt_2i and Mt_2ii homoeologs themselves share nine
genes, only one of which is absent from soybean (Figure
2). The gene absent from soybean encodes a putative

from first to last syntenic gene in region
the last syntenic pair is removed, 10 of 35 genes are syntenic (29%)

AMP-binding protein (Figure 2, Mt_2i gene 14, Mt_2ii
genes 9–10) present in one copy in Mt_2i and two adjacent copies in Mt_2ii. By contrast, Mt_2i and soybean
share three times as many homologous pairs as the two M.
truncatula duplicates themselves, including 19 homologous pairs that are absent from Mt_2ii. These observations
help to illuminate the orthologous and paralogous relationships of these genome regions, which are described in
further detail below.
Comparisons with A. thaliana
High levels of synteny are also maintained between the
two legume species and networks of duplicated A. thaliana
regions, each with a unique pattern of gene loss (Table 2).
For example, nearly 62% (28 of 45) soybean genes and
half of M. truncatula genes in synteny block 1b have a
homolog within a syntenic network of four A. thaliana
duplicated regions (Figure 1). With any one A. thaliana
region, much lower levels of conserved synteny are

observed (between 23% and 34% of soybean genes; 17%
and 27% of M. truncatula genes). These results are consistent with the model of large-scale genome duplication followed by gene loss in Arabidopsis [34] and mirror the
results of Foster-Hartnett et al. [29] in their low resolution
synteny analysis of the soybean rhg1 region. By contrast,
we found only one region in A. thaliana syntenic to block
1a (Figure 1, Table 2) with 20% (4 of 20) of soybean genes
and 29% (5 of 17) of M. truncatula genes. In synteny block
2, levels of synteny between the legume species and individual A. thaliana regions were comparable to those in
synteny blocks 1a and 1b, but composite syntenies were
much lower (Table 2). For instance, just 29% of soybean
genes were conserved in At4_2i and 17% in At3_2ii, with
only 31% conserved in the network of both A. thaliana
regions.

Perspectives on cyst nematode resistance genes
Despite the absence of an rhg1 homolog in the syntenic
M. truncatula region examined here (synteny block 1b, Mt,
top sequence assembly in Figure 1), it is clear that there is
an rhg1 homolog elsewhere in M. truncatula. Though not
present in any of the full-length BAC sequences that currently comprise >40% of M. truncatula's genespace [33], a
homolog does exist on a M. truncatula BAC-end sequence
(mth2-60m7), showing 78% amino acid identity to rhg1
over 279 amino acids (e-value = e-118). This percent identity is higher than that of the syntenic M. truncatula
homologs compared to soybean's Rhg4 locus in synteny
block 2 (~70%). BAC mth2-60m7 and the next three BACend hits all belong to the same region of M. truncatula FPC
contig 949 [33], which tentatively maps to chromosome
5. This indicates that either the M. truncatula rhg1
homolog was translocated out of the remainder of the
syntenic region on chromosome 4 or that contig 949 represents a paralogous region with the rhg1 homolog lost
from the orthologous region that we examined here.
Given the extensive synteny that exists in the region surrounding rhg1, it is surprising that the M. truncatula
homolog of this gene, in particular, has undergone such
rearrangement and/or loss. Notably, a homolog to rhg1
does exist among the network of A. thaliana duplicates
(Figure 1, Synteny block 1b, At3_1iii, gene 5).

On the other hand, homologs of Rhg4 were found in the
corresponding regions of M. truncatula and A. thaliana,
including both M. truncatula homoeologs (Figure 2, Mt_2i
gene 8, Mt_2ii gene 7, and At3_2ii gene 11). The M. truncatula Rhg4 homologs both show approximately 70%
identity with Rhg4 and the surrounding region is greatly
conserved as well. Mt_2i shares 75% and Mt_2ii 47%, of
confirmed genes with soybean in the region immediately
surrounding the Rhg4 homologs. Mt_2i even shows conservation of 100% of confirmed genes in a region over
300 kbp away. The high conservation of genome context
surrounding Rhg4 indicates that, had the M. truncatula
sequence been available before Rhg4 was cloned, it would
have greatly facilitated cross genomic chromosome walking and cloning of the Rhg4 gene.
Tandem duplications
Genes have undergone tandem duplication in all species
(soybean: 7 genes, M. truncatula: 9 genes, A. thaliana: 6
genes). In four cases, homologous soybean/M. truncatula
genes are both duplicated. In no cases are homologous A.
thaliana/legume genes both duplicated.

Tandemly duplicated genes with the highest copy numbers occur in a highly rearranged region in the middle of
synteny block 2 (Figure 2). The rearranged region in soybean contains 11 copies of chalcone synthase genes in
three separate groups of four, four, and three genes (genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/15

39–42, 50–51, 53–54, 57–59 in Figure 2). The latter
group appears to have originated from a 25 kbp segmental
duplication of the top CHS group and surrounding genes.
While soybean has 11 copies of the CHS gene in this
region, including CHS1, CHS2, CHS3, CHS4, and CHS5,
the Mt_2ii region has only one CHS cluster with two
genes, CHS1A and CHS1B (genes 52–53 in Figure 2). In
addition, Mt_2ii contains a group of 10 genes with similarity to A. thaliana auxin-induced proteins 6B and X10A
that are absent in soybean (genes 24–33 in Figure 2). It
was not possible to analyze the corresponding region in
Mt_2i, as this genome segment has not yet been
sequenced.
Tandem duplications occur in other regions as well (Figures 1, 2). There are examples of tandemly duplicated
genes whose homolog(s) are not duplicated, as well as
cases in which two or more homologs have duplicated.
For example, soybean and both M. truncatula duplicates in
synteny block 2 have three copies of a glucosyltransferase
(Mt_2i genes 2–4, Gm genes 18–20, and Mt_2ii genes 4–
6 in Figure 2). Cases of differential tandem duplication
may have resulted from duplication in only one species or
loss of duplicates from one species.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees were successfully generated for 21 gene
families with members in synteny block 1 and for 23 in
synteny block 2, many of which included homologs from
both M. truncatula duplicates (Figures 1, 2) [see Additional Files 1, 2]. These phylogenies were examined to
determine whether soybean and M. truncatula homologs
within synteny blocks were more closely related to each
other than to homologs elsewhere in the genomes, as represented by expressed sequences. For all 16 phylogenies in
synteny block 1b, M. truncatula/soybean homologs were
more closely related to each other than to homologs in
other genomic regions, strongly suggesting orthology
(Figure 1) [see Additional File 1]. Synteny block 1a contained a mix of tentative orthologs (two comparisons)
and paralogs (three comparisons) (Figure 1) [see Additional File 1]. In synteny block 2, soybean genes showed
orthologous relationships with their homologs in M. truncatula block Mt_2i every time (20 of 20 comparisons) and
paralogous relationships in M. truncatula homoeolog
Mt_2ii (11 of 11 comparisons) (Figure 2) [see Additional
File 2].

Nucleotide substitution levels were determined to measure the evolutionary distance between soybean and M.
truncatula (synonymous substitution levels) and to identify differences, if any, in selection pressure (nonsynonymous substitution levels). In synteny block 1, estimates of
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution levels
were obtained for 34 sets of M. truncatula and soybean

Page 8 of 16

BMC Plant Biology 2005, 5:15

homologs (Figure 3a), six in synteny block 1a and 28 in
synteny block 1b. In comparing these two blocks, we
observed no difference in the number of synonymous
substitutions per site (Table 3; 1a: 0.71, 1b: 0.71, p =
0.96), suggesting similar times of divergence between soybean and M. truncatula in both regions. This result is
somewhat surprising given the fact that block 1a is composed of a mixture of apparent orthologous and paralogous relationships, while block 1b exhibits exclusively
orthologous relationships.
In synteny block 2, the two M. truncatula homoeologs
shared the same eight genes with soybean. We therefore
focused on paired comparisons using these eight genes.
The extent of synonymous substitutions between soybean
and Mt_2i (0.87), an orthologous relationship based on
phylogenetic tree analysis, was significantly lower than
the extent between soybean and Mt_2ii (1.21), a paralogous relationship (p = 0.008) (Table 3; Figure 3b). All
eight paired comparisons show higher levels of synonymous substitutions in the paralogous comparison. Not
surprisingly, therefore, the paralogous region has evolved
farther from soybean in evolutionary time than the
orthologous region, implying that a duplication spanning
the entire synteny block 2 preceded speciation between M.
truncatula and soybean. The number of nonsynonymous
substitution levels per site were comparable between the
orthologous and paralogous M. truncatula/soybean relationships, with no significant difference (p = 0.69) (Table
3).
Comparisons of the distance between the two M. truncatula homoeologs in synteny block 2 revealed levels of
synonymous substitutions (0.82) comparable to those of
the orthologous Mt_2i/soybean comparison in the same
block (0.87) (Table 3; Figure 3b; p = 0.85), suggesting that
the duplication may have occurred close in time with speciation. It is surprising that the synonymous distance
between M. truncatula homoeologs (0.82) is not closer to
that of the paralogous M. truncatula/soybean comparison
(1.21), which should be comparable given a duplication
event followed by speciation. However, the difference
between them was not significant (p = 0.22). There were
no significant differences when comparing homoeologs
between synteny blocks (data not shown) for either synonymous or nonsynonymous substitution levels. No differences were observed between tandemly duplicated and
single copy genes for nonsynonymous or synonymous
substitution levels (data not shown).
Estimates of synonymous substitution distance between
orthologous soybean and M. truncatula regions allowed us
to estimate the time of the Medicago/Glycine speciation
event, as did the synonymous distance between the two
M. truncatula duplicates in synteny block 2 in timing the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/15

underlying genome duplication. Orthologous regions
between soybean and M. truncatula in both synteny blocks
1b (Mt/Gm) and 2 (Mt_2i/Gm) (Figures 1, 2) give similar
estimates of divergence since speciation. Synteny block 1b
has a median synonymous substitution level of 0.61 per
site (Table 3), suggesting 50 My since the divergence
through speciation, using an estimate of 6.1 × 10-9 substitutions per synonymous site per year [35]. Synteny block
2 has a median synonymous substitution level of 0.59 per
site (Table 3) when comparing all orthologs, suggesting
48 Mya since speciation. By contrast, the duplication
event in M. truncatula evident in synteny block 2 (Figure
2) appears to have predated speciation, with a median of
0.79 synonymous substitutions per site and an inferred
divergence between duplicates of 64 Mya.

Discussion
Synteny
Soybean and M. truncatula synteny
We examined two regions that are highly syntenic
between soybean, M. truncatula, and A. thaliana. These
two regions comprise approximately 0.5 Mb each
surrounding the rhg1 and Rhg4 SCN resistance loci of soybean and their corresponding regions in M. truncatula and
A. thaliana. In the process, we discovered remarkably high
levels of colinearity between soybean and M. truncatula,
including cases of near perfect conservation of gene order
and orientation. For example, we observed one case where
33 of 35 genes and a second where 13 out of 13 genes
were perfectly conserved and colinear. Because M. truncatula and soybean are estimated to have diverged approximately 50 Mya, these examples of conserved synteny are
truly remarkable. Overall, soybean synteny to M. truncatula in orthologous relationships averages 79% and
reaches 94% when only genes with Genbank's
nonredundant database support are considered. Moreover, synteny between the legume species and a network of
A. thaliana segmental duplications exceeds 60%.

Levels of synteny are clearly not this high genome-wide,
though macrosynteny exists over much of the genome [6].
Yan et al. [16] estimated that synteny between soybean
and M. truncatula exists in only about half of soybean
genomic regions anchored by RFLPs, and of these cases,
just 75% exhibit extensive synteny. In other genome
regions not described in here, we have found much lower
levels of synteny. In a targeted search for syntenic relationships between soybean and M. truncatula in genome
regions surrounding the soybean disease resistance gene,
rpg1, Cannon et al. [36] discovered much lower levels of
synteny. The best syntenic candidate regions that could be
identified showed significant differential gene expansion,
multiple rearrangements, indels, and translocations. In
this case, the rpg1 soybean region on linkage group F of
approximately 300 kbp corresponded to an M. truncatula

region of more than 500 kbp. Of 30 soybean genes and 45
M. truncatula genes confirmed by hits to the Uniref database [37] at BLASTP, e ≤ -4, just nine (20%) were syntenic.
Why the regions that we examined in the current study
should have remained so highly conserved is unknown.
Several explanations for differential conservation of synteny have been proposed. Regions with disease resistance
genes often evolve rapidly and show frequent rearrangements [38-40]. Nevertheless, the soybean regions in this
study were characterized because they contain important
disease resistance genes – though not members of the
more widespread NBS-LRR gene family most frequently
associated with rearrangements [38]. Often, regions near
centromeres tend to be more conserved than telomeric
regions [41]. But the soybean region in synteny block 1 is
known to be located at the very end of the chromosome,
while still retaining high levels of synteny with M. truncatula and A. thaliana. Of the mapped M. truncatula
sequence assemblies, only the top sequence assembly in
synteny block 1b is close to the centromere (R. Geurts et
al., personal communication). In some organisms,
regions of housekeeping genes are clustered and thought
to be more conserved [42-44]. Though housekeeping
genes are certainly present in the regions of this study, the
regions do not represent clusters of housekeeping genes
[see Additional File 3]. Finally, the presence of transposons and other repetitive sequence may decrease stability in a region [45-47]. In the regions described here, just
12 of 356 predicted gene models in soybean and M. truncatula are transposons or retrotransposons. On a base pair
level, this translates to 2.2% of M. truncatula and 1.7% of
soybean genomic sequence. These levels of transposons
and retrotransposons are not unusual. Cannon et al. (personal communication) estimated that transposons of this
type occupy ~3% of the M. truncatula genome when
examining over 100 Mb of sequence. In soybean, Graham
et al. [48] found that more than 10% of a soybean BAC
containing multiple NBS-LRR sequences was composed of

retrotransposons. Although we cannot identify hallmarks
of the sequences examined that would cause them to be
more conserved than usual, they do appear to be highly
conserved and care should be taken in drawing general
conclusions from this comparison.
Legume and A. thaliana synteny
The relationship between legumes and A. thaliana in synteny block 1b, described in detail here, seem to follow a
pattern of post-speciation duplication followed by gene
loss [34]. Several syntenic regions exist that vary slightly in
overall degree of synteny, while gene loss/insertion has
occurred in every case. A composite of all the partially syntenic regions come together to form a network that
together recapitulates substantial genome conservation.
The retention of soybean and M. truncatula genes in A.
thaliana is impressive, given the roughly 90 My thought to
separate A. thaliana from legumes [49]. For example, synteny block 1b has 60% of its genes occurring in at least
one of four syntenic A. thaliana regions, though individually, the most conserved of these regions contains just half
that level.

Though synteny between legumes and A. thaliana in this
region is impressive, previous results suggest it extends
beyond the region analyzed here. Foster-Hartnett et al
[29] described conserved synteny involving the genome
region around rhg1 twice the size examined in the present
study, though at low sequence resolution primarily using
BAC-end sequences [29]. Simillion, et al. [50] also found
conservation among the A. thaliana regions syntenic to
synteny block 1b extending up to 182 kbp in length.
Exceptions to synteny
There were also some consistent exceptions to synteny. A
total of 13 transposons, including retrotransposons, were
found among the three species. Just one was found in syntenic positions, where an M. truncatula retroelement in
synteny block 1b was located in a comparable position to

Page 11 of 16

BMC Plant Biology 2005, 5:15

an element in soybean. However, the soybean (a copiatype polyprotein) and M. truncatula (an RNA-directed
DNA polymerase) genes do not share sequence
homology.
Additionally, genes predicted by FGENESH but without
database support were much less likely to have homologs
than those with database confirmation (9% of soybean
predicted genes without database support versus 62% of
those with database support have homologs). Still, a
small number – roughly 10% – of nearly 60 unconfirmed
genes (no hits in nr) in either soybean or M. truncatula did
show synteny. Conserved legume genes without
homologs in the database may be the most interesting
genes of all, since they are likely to be novel or highly
diverged from known proteins and may play a role in
important plant or legume-specific processes.
Gene density
Although soybean's genome size is more than double that
of M. truncatula [51], gene density is comparable in these
regions (Synteny block 1: M. truncatula = 1 gene/7.2 kb,
soybean: 1 gene/6.7 kb; Synteny block 2: M. truncatula = 1
gene/6.2 kb, soybean: 1 gene/5.8 kb). These values are not
far from those of A. thaliana overall (1 gene/5 kb) [52]. In
this region, A. thaliana gene density is approximately half
to two-thirds that of the legumes (Synteny block 1: A. thaliana = 1 gene/3.4 kb; Synteny block 2: A. thaliana = 1 gene/
4.1 kb), although soybean and M. truncatula genome sizes
are 7X and 3X that of A. thaliana, respectively [51]. Higher
than expected gene densities in soybean and M. truncatula
suggest the possibility of gene clustering. Indeed, gene
clustering has identified in M. truncatula [53] and forms
the basis of targeting M. truncatula sequencing to the generich regions of the genome [14].
Genome duplication and speciation
The networks of synteny we have identified reflect duplication and gene loss between species, including M. truncatula regions with both orthologous and paralogous
relationships to soybean. In synteny block 2, for example,
there are clear-cut examples of regions with orthologous
and paralogous relationships. Mt_2i shows only orthologous relationships with soybean, while Mt_2ii shows only
paralogous relationships (Figures 1, 2). M. truncatula
regions in synteny block 1b also unambiguously display
orthology to soybean.

M. truncatula duplications in synteny block 2 allowed us
to systematically examine corresponding orthologous and
paralogous relationships to soybean. The percentage of
conserved genes between soybean and Mt_2i (orthologous region) was twice as high as with Mt_2ii (paralogous
region) (Figure 2, Table 2). Given that orthology indicates
the most closely related regions evolutionarily (reflected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/15

in the phylogenetic trees) [see Additional File 2], it is not
surprising that fewer genes have been deleted/inserted or
experienced substitutions in orthologous comparisons.
The fact that all the M. truncatula genes in the orthologous
region (Mt_2i) are more closely related to soybean as
evidenced by phylogenetic trees, synonymous substitution levels, percent identity, and extent of synteny, than
either is to the M. truncatula genes in the paralogous
region (Mt_2ii) suggests that the duplication seen in M.
truncatula occurred before the speciation event splitting
Medicago and Glycine lineages. Presumably, soybean also
has (or had) a duplicate region as well, a possibility with
some phylogenetic support [see Additional File 2].
We date the duplication event, possibly as a part of a
genome duplication, in M. truncatula at 64 Mya, preceding
a speciation event approximately 48–50 Mya. Indeed, the
possibility of a genome duplication event predating the
split between M. truncatula and soybean has been suggested previously [16,54,55]. Median synonymous substitution levels between the two M. truncatula duplicates in
synteny block 2 (0.79 synonymous substitutions per site)
fall within [55] or near [54] synonymous distance peaks,
which were interpreted by the authors as a genome duplication event in M. truncatula. Schleuter et al. [55] estimates that this event occurred 58 million years ago, while
Blanc and Wolfe [54] inferred a more recent event based
on a substantially different molecular clock [56]. Likewise, we estimate the speciation event between Medicago
and Glycine at 48 – 50 Mya, while Blanc and Wolfe [54]
inferred a much more recent date of 13.3–15 million years
ago, though again, the differences are primarily due to the
use of differing molecular clocks [56].
Comparatively long (~500 kbp) and contiguous sets of
homologous segments from different species with known
phylogenetic relationships and nucleotide substitution
levels bring power to the study of molecular evolution.
Though median synonymous substitution levels of duplication and speciation events correspond well to published
values [54,55] (see above), the extent of synonymous substitutions varies significantly between neighboring genes
despite a common genomic context (Figure 3). Estimates
comparing the two M. truncatula segments created by a
duplication event range from 0.62–1.12 while those comparing soybean and M. truncatula orthologs (speciation
event) range from 0.42–2.68. Since the duplicates in each
one of these cases presumably diverged at the same
moment, one must postulate different evolutionary trajectories for the different gene lineages. Knowing that all the
genes on a contiguous genomic block duplicated (and
later speciated) together removes an important unknown
from evolution analyses in contrast to comparable ESTbased studies [54,55].

Conclusion
We analyzed genome regions of soybean, M. truncatula,
and A. thaliana with remarkable levels of conservation of
gene content and order. Such high levels of colinearity
within the legumes and with the model plant A. thaliana
bode well for leveraging information from model
genomes to crop plants like soybean. Further, we
described substantial blocks of genes with the same
evolutionary (duplication) history, allowing us to study
and compare the individual evolution of genes within a
common genomic context. These blocks include two
duplicates in M. truncatula, one orthologous and the other
paralogous with soybean. This duplication may be part of
a larger genome duplication event in the common ancestor of soybean and M. truncatula. If so, the analysis
described here is just the first step in understanding the
evolution of legume genomes and a useful addition to our
knowledge about genomic reorganization that occurs at a
the scale of megabase or less.

Methods
Sequences
Glycine max sequences [GenBank:AX196294.1, GenBank:AX196295.1, GenBank:AX196297.1, and GenBank:AX197417.1] [32] were obtained from Genbank. All
soybean sequences were derived from cultivar 'A3244'.
[GenBank:AX196295.1] (Figure 1, gene 29) includes the
susceptible allele of soybean rhg1 gene on molecular linkage group G. [GenBank:AX197297] (Figure 2, gene 21)
includes the susceptible allele of soybean Rhg4 gene on
molecular linkage group A2.

M. truncatula BACs were sequenced as part of an international effort to sequence the genespace of this model legume [14]. Two additional M. truncatula BACs were
sequenced and examined before the international
genome sequencing had begun [57]. Putative homologs
of soybean sequences in M. truncatula and A. thaliana were
identified by searching the soybean sequences against all
sequenced M. truncatula BACs and the A. thaliana proteome using BLAST [58] (The Institute for Genomic
Research, Arabidopsis Proteome version 5). After identifying genes (see below), protein/protein comparisons
(BLASTP) were performed in order to confirm that BACs
were syntenic and to identify syntenic genes (see below).
Genbank accessions for soybean and M. truncatula
sequences, A. thaliana gene numbers, and mapping information are shown in Table 1.
Sequence assemblies
Sequences were aligned and merged in regions of
sequence overlap on the basis of 99% identity or better.
End-sequenced BAC clones that tentatively spanned gaps
in the sequence were identified based on strong hits (evalue = 0, ≥99% identity) to sequenced BACs on either

side. Gap sizes were estimated by removing overlap from
the estimated size of end-sequenced BAC(s).
Nomenclature
Throughout the manuscript, the following nomenclature
is used. Regions surrounding and syntenic to the SCN
resistance rhg1 locus are collectively referred to as synteny
block 1 (Figure 1). Regions surrounding and syntenic to
SCN Rhg4 gene are collectively referred to as synteny block
2 (Figure 2). Synteny block 1 is divided into blocks 1a and
1b, which are separated by gaps in all three species (Figure
1). Within each synteny block, species are labeled as Gm
(soybean), Mt (M. truncatula), or At (A. thaliana). The
chromosome number follows the "At" abbreviation for A.
thaliana. If more than one homoeolog is present, the species abbreviation is appended with an underscore followed by the synteny block and lower case roman
numerals (i.e. Mt_2i, Mt_2ii, At4_2i, and At3_2ii in Figure
2) (Figures 1, 2). Sequence assemblies separated by physical gaps are labeled as sequence assemblies "top" and
"bottom" in arbitrary order (Figure 1).
Gene prediction and identification of synteny
Genes were predicted in G. max and M. truncatula
genomic sequences using the dicot (Arabidopsis) matrix of
FGENESH [59,60]http://www.softberry.com. BLASTP was
used to compare predicted proteins between databases
containing these G. max or M. truncatula predicted genes
and all A. thaliana proteins with an e-value cutoff of e-8
and percent identity cutoff of 40% for the top high scoring
segment pair for soybean and M. truncatula comparisons
and an e-value cutoff of e-8 for comparisons to A. thaliana
[58]. These cutoff values generally identified homologs in
syntenic positions while rejecting related genes in nonsyntenic positions.

In this study, we defined synteny to include both conservation of gene content and order between species. In estimating syntenic density (the percentage of genes
conserved between two species), repetitive sequences
(genes with similarity to transposable elements, including
retroelements) were not included and tandemly duplicated genes were counted as one. Synteny between two
species was estimated from the first to the last pair of conserved genes in the available sequence for both species.
Phylogenetic analysis
To distinguish between orthologous and paralogous
regions, we constructed phylogenetic trees as follows.
BLASTP or TBLASTN, as appropriate, were used to compare all G. max genes with the following sequences: all G.
max and M. truncatula proteins in the corresponding
genomic regions of this analysis; the nonredundant A.
thaliana proteome; soybean and M. truncatula EST unigene sets [61] (GMGI v.11 and MTGI v.7; The Institute for

amino acids with e-values ≤ e-10 were included in the
analysis. Tandem duplications and highly related genes in
the same gene family were grouped for analysis.

and writing of the manuscript. NDY participated in the
design, analysis, and interpretation of the data as well as
in the writing of the manuscript. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.

Initial alignments were calculated using T-COFFEE [62]
with manual evaluations and edits in Jalview [63] for
poorly aligning sequences. For subsequent phylogenetic
analysis, an HMM calculated for each alignment using
hmmer [64] was used to realign sequences and to identify
and remove indel regions and sequences with fewer than
60% matches to the model. Parameters for hmmbuild
were: archpri = 0.7, gapmax = 0.3.

Parsimony trees were calculated using the protpars of
Phylip [65], with maximum likelihood branch lengths
calculated using TREE-PUZZLE [66]. Parameters for protpars were: randomize input order; use ordinary parsimony; search for best tree; select one best tree for further
analysis in TreePuzzle. Parameters for TreePuzzle were:
user defined tree (from parsimony search); approximate
parameter estimates; Whelan-Goldman substitution
model [67] estimate amino acid frequencies from data set;
allow rate heterogeneity with eight gamma-distributed
rates.
Nucleotide substitutions
Codon-aligned nucleic acid sequences were created with
TranslateAlign.pl (courtesy Dan Kortschak, University of
Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia). Nucleotide substitutions
levels were calculated using these alignments with SNAP
(Synonymous/Non-synonymous Analysis Program)
[68,69]. In this program, the levels of synonymous and
nonsynonymous substitutions per site are approximated
using methods developed by Nei and Gojobori [70],
incorporating Ota and Nei's statistic [71]. Median synonymous substitution levels were converted into estimates
of time since divergence using an estimate of 6.1 × 10-9
substitutions per synonymous site per year [35].
