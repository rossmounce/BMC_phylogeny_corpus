Abstract
Background: Ghrelin (GRLN) is now known to be an appetite-stimulating and growth hormone
(GH)-releasing peptide that is predominantly synthesized and secreted from the stomachs of
various vertebrate species from fish to mammals. Here, we report a GRLN-like peptide (GRLNLP) in a cartilaginous fish, the red stingray, Dasyatis akajei.
Results: The purified peptide contains 16 amino acids (GVSFHPQPRS10TSKPSA), and the serine
residue at position 3 is modified by n-octanoic acid. The modification is the characteristic of GRLN.
The six N-terminal amino acid residues (GVSFHP) were identical to another elasmobranch shark
GRLN-LP that was recently identified although it had low identity with other GRLN peptides.
Therefore, we designated this peptide stingray GRLN-LP. Uniquely, stingray GRLN-LP was Oglycosylated with mucin-type glycan chains [N-acetyl hexosamine (HexNAc)3 hexose(Hex)2] at
threonine at position 11 (Thr-11) or both serine at position 10 (Ser-10) and Thr-11. Removal of
the glycan structure by O-glycanase made the in vitro activity of stingray GRLN-LP decreased when
it was evaluated by the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations using a rat GHS-R1a-expressing
cell line, suggesting that the glycan structure plays an important role for maintaining the activity of
stingray GRLN-LP.
Conclusions: This study reveals the structural diversity of GRLN and GRLN-LP in vertebrates.

Background
Ghrelin (GRLN), which generally consists of 28 amino
acids, was first identified in the stomachs of rats and
humans as an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone
secretagogue-receptor 1a (GHS-R1a)[1]. The serine residue at position 3 of this peptide (Ser-3) contains a unique

octanoyl modification, and the acylation is necessary for
the peptide to bind and activate GHS-R1a [1,2]. In mammals, GRLN is an important hormone involves in various
physiological events such as pituitary, cardiovascular, steroidogenic, and developmental functions and energy
homeostasis [3-6].

In non-mammals, GRLN has been identified in species
from fish to birds (reviewed by [7-11]). Very recently,
endogenous GRLN form was determined in a bony fish,
goldfish [12]. Non-mammalian mature GRLNs are composed of 17 to 28 amino acids, and are known to involve
in regulating pituitary functions in teleosts [6], amphibians [13] and birds [14], and feeding in teleosts [15-19]
and birds [7,20-23]. An inhibitory effect of GRLN on
drinking in birds (chicken) was also recently reported
[24].
We identified a GRLN-like peptide (GRLN-LP) in the
stomach of primitive vertebrates, cartilaginous fish, the
hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) and blacktip reef
shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) [25]. The GRLN-like
peptide from both sharks consisted of 25 amino acids,
and only three amino acids differed between the two species. Like other vertebrate GRLN, Ser-3 of GRLN-LP from
sharks had been modified by n-octanoic or n-decanoic
acid. However, the first seven N-terminal residues, which
are generally highly conservative region of GRLN including the active core, had low identity between sharks (GVSFHPR) and those of other species (GSSFLSP, GTSFLSP and
GSTFLSP). This difference is one of the reasons why this
peptide was designated GRLN-LP though there is Ser-3
acylation. In addition to this, the C-terminal end of the
shark GRLN-LP has not been amidated, which is a specific
feature of teleost GRLN. However, we have proposed that
shark GRLN-LP exhibits ancestral features of GRLN molecule that are present in higher vertebrate.
Here we report the structure of GRLN-LP from the stomachs of another elasmobranch, the red stingray, Dasyatis
akajei, and identification of the cDNA that encodes the
precursor protein. Interestingly, we revealed that the stingray GRLN-LP is not only octanoylated at Ser-3 but also
possesses a mucin-type glycan structure at threonine
(Thr)-11 or both Ser-10 and Thr-11.

Methods
Purification of GRLN-LP from stingray stomachs
Stingrays, Dasyatis akajei, were collected at Toyama bay
(Toyama, Japan). Frozen stomachs (approximately 40 g)
were used as the starting material. All animal experiments
were conducted in accordance with Guidelines for the
Care and Use of Animals of the University of Toyama and
of National Cardiovascular Center (ref. no. 8053). GRLN
was purified as previously described [26] with slight modifications. During the purification process, GRLN activity
was monitored by measuring changes in the intracellular
calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations in a cell line that stably
expressing rat GHS-R1a (CHO-GHSR62).

Stomach tissues were boiled in five volumes of Milli-Q
level water, minced, acidified with concentrated acetic

acid (AcOH) to 1 M, and homogenized. The supernatant
was obtained by centrifugation. Next, cold acetone was
added to the AcOH-extracts at a final concentration of
66%, after which the mixture was stirred over night and
then centrifuged. The resulting supernatant was evaporated and purified with a Sep-Pak Vac 35 cc C18 cartridge
(Waters, Milford, MA) to enrich the peptide components.
The cartridge was successively eluted with 25% acetonitlile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 60%
acetonitlile containing 0.1% TFA. The lyophilized Sep-Pak
fraction that was eluted with 60% acetonitlile containing
0.1% TFA was dissolved in 1 M AcOH, and then subjected
to cation-exchange chromatography using a SP-Sephadex
C-25 (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England). Successive elution with 1 M AcOH, 2 M pyridine
and 2 M pyridine-AcOH (pH 5.0) yielded three fractions:
SP-I, SP-II and SP-III, respectively.
The basic peptide-enriched SP-III fraction was subjected to
carboxymethyl (CM)-ion exchange HPLC (TSKgel CM2SW, 4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) at a flow rate
of 1 ml/min. A two-step gradient was made from solvent
A (10 mM ammonium formate (pH 4.8) in 10% acetonitlile) to 25% solvent B (1 M ammonium formate (pH 4.8)
in 10% acetonitlile) for 10 min and then to 55% solvent
B for 90 min. The eluate was collected in 1-ml fractions
from the start of the gradient program. Based on the assay
results, GRLN activities were eluted in clusters. Thus, we
performed secondary CM-HPLC on the active fractions
with a more shallower two-step gradient profile from solvent A to 15% solvent B for 10 min and then to 35% solvent B for 80 min. The eluate was collected in 1-ml
fractions every 1 min, 20 min after injection into the
HPLC system.
Active CM-HPLC fractions were desalted by Sep-Pak treatment, lyophilized, and then subjected to an anti-rat
GRLN1-11 immunoglobulin G (IgG) immuno-affinity
column to purify GRLN-immuno-cross reactive substances [26]. This immuno-affinity column effectively
absorbed the shark GRLN-LP [25]. The adsorbed substances were eluted with 60% acetonitlile containing
0.1% TFA and then separated by two different reversephase (RP)-HPLC methods. The samples were first
applied to a preparative RP-HPLC with a Symmetry C18
column (3.9 × 150 mm, Waters) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min
under a linear gradient from 10% to 60% acetonitlile containing 0.1% TFA for 40 min. Active fractions were further
purified on a Symmetry C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm,
Waters) or a diphenyl column (2.1 × 150 mm,
219TP5215, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/
min under a gradient from 10% to 60% acetonitlile containing 0.1% TFA for 40 min. The eluate that corresponded to each absorbance peak was collected. For
peptide sequencing, approximately 5 pmol of the purified

peptide, which was estimated based on the absorbance
peak height, was subjected to protein sequencing (model
494, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Mass spectrometry
The molecular weights of the purified peptides were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight-time of flight (MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometry (4700 proteomics analyzer, Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) with α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
(CHCA) (Sigma-Aldrich Chem. Corp., WI) as a matrix.
Prediction of O-glycosylation sites
The detected peptide mass and its profile indicated that
the peptide was possibly glycosylated. The NetOGlyc program, which is available at the Center for Biological
Sequences CBS Prediction Server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk,
was used to predict the potential O-glycosylation sites.
Cloning of stingray GRLN-LP cDNA
The nucleotide sequence of stingray GRLN-LP cDNA was
determined using the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends
(RACE) PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA (2
μg) was extracted from a stingray stomach and then
reverse-transcribed using Omniscript RT (QIAGEN
GmbH, Hilden, Germany). For 3'-RACE PCR, four degenerate primers were designed based on the sequence of the
seven N-terminal amino acids in stingray GRLN-LP
(G1VSFHPQ7) that was identified by protein sequencing.
Among these primers, the rayGRL-s2 primer (5'-GGN
GTN AGY TTY CAY CCN CA-3') effectively amplified
expected cDNA fragment. PCR was performed using 50
pmol/reaction of rayGRL-s2, an adaptor primer supplied
in the kit, ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan)
under the following amplification conditions: 94°C for 1
min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 53°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 1 min; followed by a final extension for 3 min at
72°C. The amplified products were purified by the Wizard
PCR Preps (Promega, Madison, WI). Second-round
nested PCR was performed on the purified cDNA with
four degenerate sense primers (50 pmol/reaction) that
were based on the amino acid sequence of stingray GRLNLP (F4HPQPRS10). Among these primers, two primers,
rayGRL-s6 (5'-TTY CAY CCN CAR CCN CGN AG-3') and
rayGRL-s8 (5'-TTY CAY CCN CAR CCN AGR AG-3') effectively amplified expected cDNA fragment under the following conditions: 94°C for 1 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for
30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final
extension for 3 min at 72°C. The approximately 400-bp
amplified products were subcloned into the pCRII-TOPO
vector (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence of the insert
was determined by a DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100
Genetic analyzer, Applied Biosystems), according to the
BigDye® Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit protocol
(Applied Biosystems) using the M13 forward or reverse
primer.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/10/30

For 5'-RACE PCR, two gene-specific primers were
designed based on the partial sequence of the stingray
GRLN-LP cDNA that was obtained by 3'-RACE PCR: rayGRL-as1, 5'-GGA CGA TGC ATT GAT CTG CGG-3' and ray
GRL-as2, 5'-CCC GTT CAG GTC GGA CGA TGC-3'. Primary PCR was performed using rayGRL-as1, an anchor
primer supplied in the 5'-RACE Kit, and ExTaq DNA
polymerase under the following reaction conditions:
94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 56°C for 30
sec, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension for 3 min
at 72°C. The second-round nested PCR was performed
with 5 pmol/reaction of the rayGRL-as2, an abridged universal amplification primer (AUAP) supplied in the 5'RACE Kit, and ExTaq DNA polymerase under the same
conditions described above. The rayGRL-as2 primer was
designed inside the rayGRL-as1 primer, but nine nucleotides on the 3'-side of the rayGRL-as2 were identical to
the primer sequence of rayGRL-as1. Thus, the target cDNA
could be amplified effectively by the second-round nested
PCR. The amplified products, which were approximately
480 bp, were subcloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector and
sequenced.
Amplification of the full-length stingray GRLN-LP cDNA
To confirm the precise nucleotide sequence of the fulllength stingray GRLN-LP cDNA, we performed PCR using
a proofreading, Pyrobest DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The
template cDNA for the 3'-RACE PCR was used because the
Tm of the antisense primer for the 3'end of the stingray
GRLN-LP cDNA was too low to amplify the full-length
cDNA. Thus, PCR was conducted using a sense primer
from the 5'end of the stingray GRLN-LP cDNA (5'-ACG
ACC ACA GAT CCA ACT CGA-3') and AUAP under the
following conditions: 98°C for 30 sec, 30 cycles at 98°C
for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min. For TA
cloning, an additional 10-min cycle at 72°C was performed using ExTaq DNA polymerase (overhang reaction). The amplified product was subcloned into the
pCRII-TOPO vector and sequenced.

The putative stingray GRLN-LP sequence was analyzed by
BLAST against the NCBI database, and amino acid
sequence alignment and identity analysis were performed
by multiple comparison and maximum matching program using GENETYX-Mac ver. 15.0.1 (gap penalty, insert:
-1; extend: -1 for multiple comparison, and default condition for maximum matching). Phylogenetic tree was
made using Mega 4 software http://www.megasoft
ware.net/.
Deglycosylation with O-glycanase
Stingray GRLN-LP was O-glycosylated with mucin-type
sugar chains. To examine the role of this sugar chain modification in the GRLN-like activity of stingray GRLN-LP, a
high-yield preparation of purified stingray GRLN-LP
(peak 2, Table 1) was treated with the O-glycanase, end-αPage 3 of 15

N-acetylgalactosaminidase (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the unsubstituted Galβ1,3GalNAc core dissaccharide attached to a
Ser or Thr of glycopeptides to generate free oligosaccharides. Approximately 5 pmol of native stingray GRLN-LP
(peak 2), synthesized stingray des-acyl GRLN-LP, and
octanoylated stingray GRLN-LP were incubated separately
with 1.25 mU O-glycanase in 100 μl 50 mM sodium phosphate (NaH2PO3) buffer (pH 5.0) for 16 h at 37°C, followed by an incubation for 15 min at 70°C to inactivate
the enzyme. The reaction mixture was subjected to RPHPLC on a Symmetry C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm,
Waters) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min under a linear gradient from 10% to 60% acetonitlile containing 0.1% TFA
for 40 min. The absorbance peaks that corresponded to
each catalyzed peptide were collected. Two peaks
appeared from this reaction: one was stingray GRLN-LP
without sugar chains, and the other was the original
native peptide. We did not observe any changes in the elution pattern of synthetic stingray des-acyl GRLN-LP and
octanoylated GRLN-LP after the catalytic treatment.
Quantitative real-time PCR of stingray GRLN-LP in
stingray tissues
We performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to
examine the GRLN-LP cDNA expression levels in various
stingray tissues. Total RNA was extracted from 21 tissues
from two separate stingrays to examine the variation in
expression levels. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized
from 1 μg of DNase-I- (Invitrogen) treated total RNA
using the QuantiTect RT Kit (QIAGEN GmbH) and an
oligo-dT12-18 primer. PCR amplification was performed
using the LightCycler system (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) and the QuantiFast SYBR Green
PCR Kit (QIAGEN GmbH). To generate a standard curve,
full-length stingray GRLN-LP cDNA or partial stingray βactin cDNA fragment in the pCRII-TOPO vector was linearized by Xba-I digestion. The linearized plasmid was serially diluted from 5 × 106 to 5 × 103 molecules to generate
a standard curve that was used to determine the cDNA
copy number. All qPCR amplifications were performed in
duplicate. All specific quantities were normalized as the
copy number relative to the total RNA [27] and to stingray

β-actin. For the GRLN-LP analysis, sense (5'-TCC CTC
ACC CTC AAG GCA GAG-3') and antisense primers (5'TCAT CTC CCA CTG GCA ACT GG-3') were designed to
amplify a 170-bp product. For the β-actin analysis, sense
(5'-GAT CTG TAT GCC AAC AAC GTC-3') and antisense
primers (5'-CAG AGA TGC CAG AAT AGA GCC-3') were
designed to amplify a 194-bp product. The PCR reaction
mixture (20 μl) contained 100 ng of cDNA, 1× QuantiFast
SYBR Green PCR mix, and 5 pmol of each primer was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR
conditions were 95°C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 95°C for 10
sec, 60°C for 30 sec. Amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel to determine the product
size and quantity.

Results
Purification of stingray GRLN-like peptide
The SP-III fraction from the SP-Sephadex C-25 cationexchange chromatography contained GRLN-like activity.
Next, we subjected the basic peptide-enriched SP-III fraction to CM-HPLC (pH 4.8) with a gradient program.
However, the GRLN-like activities are present in positions
where a large number of peptides eluted (fractions 17-29,
data not shown). To reduce the peptide content, active
fractions were subjected again to CM-HPLC with a much
shallower two-step gradient profile. As a result, the GRLNlike activity was divided into four groups from A to D (Fig.
1A). Each group was purified by anti-rat GRLN1-11 IgG
immuno-affinity column chromatography, followed by
RP-HPLC until a single peak was isolated. Figs. 1B and 1C
show representative preparative RP-HPLC and final RPHPLC profiles after immuno-affinity chromatography of
group B (Fig. 1A).

The estimated peptide yield from each peak height is summarized in Table 1. Overall, seven species of peptides were
isolated. The amino acid sequences of peptides in high
yield peaks 2 and 4 were analyzed. The amino acid
sequences of 16 residues were determined: GVXFHPQPRXXSKPSA for peak 2 and GVXFHPQPRSXSKPSA for
peak 4 (X, unidentified). The amino acid at position 3 was
not detected, probably due to the characteristic acyl modification at this position of GRLN. However, the reason
why amino acid at positions 10 and 11 could not be identified was uncertain.
Cloning of cDNA encoding the stingray peptide precursor
To determine the complete amino acid sequence of the
stingray peptide, we isolated cDNA encoding the peptide
precursor from stingray stomach mRNA based on the
identified amino acid sequence. The identified nucleotide
sequence of the stingray peptide was 527 bp in length,
which consisted of a 90-bp 5' untranslated region (UTR),
a 297-bp coding region, and a 140-bp 3'UTR (accession
number AB480033, Fig. 2A). A polyadenylation signal

was present in the 3'UTR (positions 506-511). The
deduced amino acid sequence showed that the stingray
peptide precursor consisted of 98 amino acids. The unidentified amino acids at positions 3, 10 and 11 were identified as Ser-3, Ser-10 and Thr-11, respectively. Therefore,
this newly identified stingray peptide contains 16 amino
acids, GVSFHPQPRSTSKPSA. A typical dibasic processing
signal (arginine-arginine, RR) followed the peptide, and
processing at this site generated a peptide that was identical to the purified peptide. In addition, we identified
another dibasic processing signal 14-amino acids downstream of the first processing sequence (Fig. 2A). Based on
this motif, it is expected that a 31-amino acid peptide
could be generated. However, this 31-amino acid peptide
was not identified during this purification process.
Deduced stingray peptide precursor showed relatively
high sequence identities compared with shark GRLN-LP
precursors (Fig. 2B, Table 2). Multiple comparisons of the
precursor protein revealed that the identity of the stingray
peptide was low compared to GRLNs from teleosts to
mammals (Fig. 3, Table 2). Fig. 4 shows a phylogenetic
tree of GRLN, and the stingray peptide was categorized in
the same clade as shark GRLN-LP.
Mass spectrometric analyses of the purified stingray
peptide
The protein sequencing results strongly indicated that Ser3 was acylated. The theoretical mono-isotopic mass of a
16-residue peptide with n-octanoic acid modification is
1808.87 [M+H]+. During the analysis, we observed two
types of mass peak profiles; one profile showed a single
peak, while the other exhibited two peaks that had a constant mass difference of 162.1 (Fig. 5). The pattern of this

spectrum is characteristic of glycosylated proteins or peptides, and the mass difference corresponded to the mass of
hexose (Hex). The mass values measured for the peptides
were greater from 795.3 to 957.3 than the predicted mass
for an octanoylated 16-amino acid peptide (Table 1).
Therefore, we assumed that all purified peptides were glycosylated.
We analyzed the potential glycosylation sites in the identified peptide sequence using the NetOGlyc program, and
found that Thr-11 is a potential O-glycosylation site (Gscore 0.728, I-score 0.521). Interestingly, Thr-11 corresponded to one of the unidentified amino acids in the
protein sequencing. The most common type of O-glycosidic linkage is an attachment through the N-acetyl hexosamine (HexNAc) to the side chain of Ser or Thr. Thus,
we analyzed peak 3 (parent masses of m/z 2580.26 and
2742.33) using MALDI-TOF MS/MS spectrometry. As a
result, we were able to assign a mass to the octanoylated
stingray peptide (1808.8 [M+H]+) from each parent mass
(data not shown), indicating that the peak 3 stingray peptide is octanoylated. In addition, glycoside and glycochain-specific masses, Hex (162), HexNAc (203) and
HexNAc-Hex (365) were assigned based on an MS/MS
analysis of the parent mass of m/z 2580.26, and
HexNAc3-Hex1 (771) and HexNAc3-Hex2 (933) were
identified from an MS/MS analysis of the parent mass of
m/z 2742.33 (data not shown). Since one unit of
HexNAc-Hex was assigned, it was predicted that this glycochain might have a mucin-type core-1 or core-2 structure. Based on this information, we next attempted to
identify the composition of the mucin-type glycan chains
using a purified peptide from peak 5 (parent mass of m/z
2766.20). The fragment masses that were estimated based
on the expected glycan chains are shown in Table 3. In this
analysis, the peak observed at m/z 1832.8 was m/z 24
greater than the mass of octanoylated 16-amino acid peptide. We could not be identified what is the origin of m/z
24. Fig. 6 shows the fragment mass spectra obtained from
an MS/MS analysis of the parent mass. Each fragment
mass shown in Table 3 was assigned as shown in Figs. 6A
to 6E. Finally, the structure of the mucin-type glycan
chains was predicted as shown in Fig. 6F. Representative
predicted primary structures of the stingray peptide are
shown in Fig. 7. A mass difference of 162.1 is considered
to occur when one Hex is deleted from the glycan chain,
suggesting that the mass-2 shown in Table 1 is the molecular mass of the original form. Table 4 summarizes the
predicted compositions of the glycan chains in the isolated stingray peptide. The mass spectrometric analysis
showed that all purified peptides would be modified by noctanoic acid. Based on the high identity with shark
GRLN-LP and the octanoyl modification of this peptide,
we named this peptide stingray GRLN-LP.

Tissue expression of GRLN-LP mRNA in stingray
Stingray GRLN-LP mRNA is expressed in almost of all of
the examined tissues. The highest expression levels were
in the stomach, with moderate levels in the pituitary,
esophagus and duodenum (Fig. 8, top). Expression level
of the β-actin gene varied among tissues (Fig. 8, middle):
muscle tissues highly express the β-actin gene compared
to soft tissues such as brain. Ratio of GRLN-LP mRNA to
the β-actin gene was the highest in the stomach, followed
by the rectal gland (Fig. 8, bottom).
Biological activity of stingray GRLN-LP
The unglycosylated synthetic stingray GRLN-LP dosedependently increased intracellular Ca2+ levels in CHOGHSR62 cells stably expressing rat GHS-R1a (Fig. 9A).
Compared to the homologous ligand, rat GRLN, the doseresponse curve for the stingray peptide was shifted to the
right, suggesting that the stingray peptide has a lower

affinity for rat GHS-R1a than rat GRLN. Catalysis of the Oglycosylation of the native (glycosylated) stingray GHRLLP reduced this activity (Fig. 9B, bottom).

Discussion
In the present study, we identified a 16-amino acid peptide that exhibits GRLN-like activity in the stomach of an
elasmobranch, the red stingray. Only a few peptide hormones have been identified in the stingray, notably calcitonin [28], relaxin-like molecule [29], pituitary adenylate
cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) [30] and proopiomelanocortin [31]. The result of the present study would
become one of valuable information on peptide that
exists in stingray.
GRLN is characterized by the modification of Ser-3 with
fatty acids such as n-octanoic or n-decanoic acid in both
mammals and non-mammals [3,8]. This acylation is

isolated stingray peptides are similar to shark GRLN-LP
[25], and the isolated peptides were octanoylated. These
data strongly suggest that the identified peptides are stingray GRLN or GRLN-LP.

essential for GRLN to bind to GHS-R1a and elicit GRLN
activity [2]. Isolated stingray peptides activated a rat GHSR1a-expressing cell line, suggesting that all peptides have
GRLN-like structures, and the amino acid at position 3
may be acylated. In fact, peptide sequence and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that amino acid sequences of

We have identified GRLN-LP in another elasmobranch
shark [25]. The peptide was named GRLN-LP because it
had the following characteristics: (1) rat GHS-R1a activation properties, (2) presence of acyl-modifications at Ser3, (3) predominant mRNA expression in the stomach and
(4) similar gene organization compared to the GRLN
gene. The newly identified stingray peptide satisfies three
of these four structural features with an exception (4). Furthermore, the six N-terminal amino acids (GVSFHP) are
identical between shark and stingray. In a phylogenetic
analysis of the precursor protein, the stingray peptide and
shark GRLN-LPs belong to the same clade. Although it is
necessary to confirm that the stingray peptide possesses
the characteristic GRLN activities such as stimulation of
GH release and hyperphagia using a stingray or rodent
model, we designate this peptide stingray GRLN-LP.
Strictly, all structures, including glycosylation as mentioned below, are present in stingray GRLN-LP. It is interesting to note that mechanisms governing the acylation of
Ser-3 are conserved from elasmobranches to mammals.
Recently an acyltransferase, namely ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT), was identified [32,33], although the
detailed mechanisms of acylation are still unknown
[34,35].
Stingray GRLN-LP possessed O-glycosylation at Ser-10
and Thr-11, in addition to the acyl-modification at Ser-3.
This glycosylation has not been seen in other GRLN/
GRLN-LP so far. To date, little is known about the presence of O-glycosylated peptide hormones other than glycoproteins or peptides such as gonadotropins,

prohormone, and vespulakinins (a wasp venom) [36-39].
These glycosylation positions of stingray GRLN-LP were
found by using the NetOGlyc program http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk, suggesting a glycosylation motif may be
present. Mass spectrometric analyses of purified peptides
revealed that stingray GRLN-LP possesses an elongated
glycan structure based on a type-2 core (Figs. 6F and 7).
For the formation of this glycan, β-1,3-galactose transferase and β-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine-transferase would
be involved in the elongation. Glycosylation, as well as
acylation by GOAT [32,33], is a post-translational modification. Further studies are required to determine if these
transferases and GOAT co-localize in GRLN-LP-producing
cells in the stingray stomach.
The functions of carbohydrates that are attached to proteins range from effects on protein folding to the formation of antigen-recognition sites. The functional
significance of the glycosylation of stingray GRLN-LP is
still unknown. This modification is likely involved in
maintaining the biological activity of GRLN-LP because
the native stingray GRLN-LP deglycosylating by O-glyca-

nase resulted in a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in rat GHS-R1a-expressing cells (Fig. 8B). However,
the glycosylation was not necessary to exhibit GRLN-like
activity because unglycosylated synthetic stingray GRLNLP could activate a rat GHS-R1a-expressing cell line (Fig.
8A). Furthermore, the C-terminal portion of GRLN, except
the seven N-terminal amino acids, is important to maintain GRLN activity in the circulation. Consistent with
these findings, truncated GRLN molecules with portions
of the C-terminus deleted, do not stimulate GH release in
rats in vivo [40]. The C-terminal portion of GRLN is rich in
basic amino acid residues such as arginine (Arg), lysine
(Lys) and histidine, e.g., eight residues in human GRLN828 and five in eel GRLN8-21. On the other hand, stingray
GRLN-LP has only two basic amino acids, Arg-9 and Lys13. It is speculated that the mucin-type glycan chains may
regulate the physicochemical features of this peptide and
act as polar molecules that stabilize GRLN-LP in the circulation of the stingray. Further studies are required to
understand the functional relevance of glycosylation of
stingray GRLN-LP, such as determining the feeding-stimulatory or GH-releasing activity of glycosylated or deglyc-

Predicted primary structures of stingray GRLN-LP
Predicted primary structures of stingray GRLN-LP. Stingray GRLN-LP is modified by n-octanoic acid at Ser-3, and
mucin-type sugar chains at Thr-11 or both Ser-10 and Thr-11. These structures were predicted based on protein sequencing
and MALDI-TOF MS/MS of peak 4 (mass-2, m/z 2742.33) and peak 2 (mass-2, m/z 3513.74) that are indicated in Table 1. The

osylated GRLN-LP after injection into the stingray
circulation in vivo.
GRLN-LP mRNA was predominantly expressed in the
stomach. This expression pattern is consistent with that of
GRLN in other vertebrates. GLRN has multiple physiological functions such as regulation of GH release, appetite
regulation, cardiovascular function, gastrointestinal
motility, pancreatic function and reproductive function
from fish to mammals as endocrine/paracrine factors [36,8]. GRLN-LP could play some roles in homeostatic regulation in the stingray. However, physiological functions
of GRLN-LP in the stingray have been still undetermined
at present. It is interesting to note that Caminos et al. [41]
reported that GRLN has a role in cartilage metabolism in
humans, mice and rats. This could be a dominant effect in
cartilaginous fish such as stingray. Further research is necessary to clarify physiological roles of GRLN-LP in the
stingray.
Elasmobranchii is a species that have primitive characteristics of vertebrates. It is interesting to note that the GRLNLP of the red stingray has more complicated post-translational modifications. We have determined GRLN-LP in
two elasmobranch sharks, hammerhead shark and blacktip reef shark [25], and their GRLN-LPs do not have the
glycosyl modification. Which is more primitive form of
GRLN-LP? Chondrichthyes include two subclasses, the

Elasmobranchii and the Holocephali [42]. Stingrays and
sharks belong to the formers, and it is divided roughly as
superorders, Batoidea and Selachimorpha, respectively.
Hammerhead and blacktip reef shark, and stingray belong
to the order Carcharhiniformes and Rajiformes, respectively. It has been considered that Rajiformes evolved later
than Carcharhiniformes [43,44]. The modification of Oglycosylation seems to be specific to the red stingray for
two reasons: (a) both the Ser-10 and Thr-11 are not evolutionarily conserved; and (b) the more ancient GRLN-LP
in shark has no O-glycosylation. Based on this division,
shark GRLN-LP might exhibit a more primitive structure,
and the stingray GRLN-LP structure may be an advanced
form.
Lastly, it has been reported that a novel appetite-inhibiting hormone, obestatin, is present in the C-terminal peptide of the GRLN precursor in mammals [45]. In this
study, the potential processing signals that would release
obestatin were not found in the stingray GRLN-LP precursor as well as in sharks [25], suggesting that obestatin-like
peptide does not exist in the stingray from the structural
view point.

Conclusions
We characterized both the structure and tissue expression
of GRLN-LP in a primitive vertebrate (cartilaginous fish),
the red stingray. The structure of stingray GRLN-LP is very

this peptide is GRLN because the characteristic biological
properties of GRLN peptides, such as GH-releasing activity or appetite-stimulating activity, have not been confirmed for this peptide. Since the unglycosylated synthetic
stingray GRLN-LP activated rat GHS-R1a-expressing cells
in an in vitro assay system, further studies are necessary to
elucidate the physiological functions of GRLN-LP in the
stingray as well as determining the functional importance
of the glycosylation of this peptide.
