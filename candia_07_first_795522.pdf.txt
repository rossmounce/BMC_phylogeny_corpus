Abstract
Background: We present a picture of the biodiversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Paraguay,
an inland South American country harboring 5 million inhabitants with a tuberculosis notification
rate of 38/100,000.
Results: A total of 220 strains collected throughout the country in 2003 were classified by
spoligotyping into 79 different patterns. Spoligopatterns of 173 strains matched 51 shared
international types (SITs) already present in an updated version of SpolDB4, the global spoligotype
database at Pasteur Institute, Guadeloupe. Our study contributed to the database 13 new SITs and
15 orphan spoligopatterns. Frequencies of major M. tuberculosis spoligotype lineages in our sample
were as follows: Latin-American & Mediterranean (LAM) 52.3%, Haarlem 18.2%, S clade 9.5%, T
superfamily 8.6%, X clade 0.9% and Beijing clade 0.5%. Concordant clustering by IS6110 restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and spoligotyping identified transmission in specific settings
such as the Tacumbu jail in Asuncion and aboriginal communities in the Chaco. LAM genotypes
were ubiquitous and predominated among both RFLP clusters and new patterns, suggesting
ongoing transmission and adaptative evolution in Paraguay. We describe a new and successfully
evolving clone of the Haarlem 3 sub-lineage, SIT2643, which is thus far restricted to Paraguay. We
confirmed its clonality by RFLP and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU) typing; we
named it "Tacumbu" after the jail where it was found to be spreading. One-fifth of the
spoligopatterns in our study are rarely or never seen outside Paraguay and one-tenth do not fit
within any of the major phylogenetic clades in SpolDB4.
Conclusion: Lineages currently thriving in Paraguay may reflect local host-pathogen adaptation of
strains introduced during past migrations from Europe.

Background
In spite of the wide availability of cost effective interventions for its control, tuberculosis (TB) is still a major global health problem and the leading cause of death from a
curable infectious disease [1]. An increasing amount of
evidence indicates that Mycobacterium tuberculosis' ability
to spread varies from strain to strain and that different
strains have different geographical and/or host specificities [2,3].
Since the discovery of DNA polymorphisms in M. tuberculosis, molecular typing of strains has become invaluable
for the study of epidemiology of TB [4]. Restriction fragment length polymorphism typing using the insertion element IS6110 as a probe has been applied since the early
1990s and still is the most reliable method for M. tuberculosis strain differentiation [5,6]. The use of additional M.
tuberculosis genotyping approaches further allows investigators not only to document outbreaks and track epidemics locally, but also to gain an insight into the global
migration and expansion of strains [7,2]. Several polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques have been proposed for M. tuberculosis strain typing. The most widely
used is spoligotyping, which detects presence or absence
of 43 short variable spacer sequences interspersed with
direct repeats in the Direct Repeat (DR) region of the chromosome [8]. A more recent approach consists of the analysis of polymorphisms in 12 to 24 loci containing variable
number of tandem repeats of Mycobacterial Interspersed
Repetitive Units (MIRU) [9]. These two PCR-based methods have been adapted for high-throughput genotyping
and combined provide the basis for research on evolutionary genetics of M. tuberculosis [10]. The information
on M. tuberculosis population diversity gathered so far in
global databases provides a robust platform for research
on phylogeny and virulence [11]. Ultimately, this knowledge is contributing to the design of rational measures for
the control of TB.
Paraguay is an inland South American country with 5.2
million inhabitants and an area of 400,000 km2; it shares
borders with Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina [12]. Politically, the country consists of 17 departments, in addition
to Asuncion, the capital city. The Paraguay River runs from
North to South dividing the territory in two distinct geographical regions with a remarkable difference in population density. The fertile Oriental Region has 160,000 km2
and as many as 31.5 inhabitants per km2. To the northwest is the Chaco, an arid region with a surface of 247,000
km2 and only one inhabitant per km2; its people are
mainly settled in sparse aboriginal communities. A total
of 2,116 TB cases were reported countrywide in 2003,
yielding a case notification rate of 37.8 cases per 100,000
inhabitants. In absolute numbers, most cases occur in
Asuncion and the Central Department, its contiguous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/75

densely populated area; both are located in the Oriental
Region. In the Oriental Region the incidence mirrors the
national rate whereas in the Chaco the rate is 3 to 5 times
higher. There is considerable under-reporting of TB in Paraguay; the World Health Organization estimates the true
incidence in the country as 50–99 cases per 100,000 [13].
In 2002 the National TB Program implemented a project
on anti-TB drug resistance surveillance sponsored by
WHO/USAID. At that time, mycobacterial culture was seldom performed in the country and case finding was
mainly based on acid fast bacilli smear examination of
symptomatic patients. The availability of isolates from
this project permitted this first-ever strain typing study in
Paraguay. This investigation was undertaken to provide
both a nationwide view of the M. tuberculosis population
structure and a preliminary assessment of the feasibility
and usefulness of genotyping for epidemiological purposes in this limited-resource and endemic TB setting.

Results
Population characteristics
Of the 220 strains included in the study, 156 (71%) were
isolated from male patients. One hundred forty-six
patients (66%) were 20 to 50 years old (mean ± SD: 38.5
± 15.7, range 10–78). Two hundred and sixteen patients
(98%) were native-born; one patient was an immigrant
from South Korea; the place of birth was not registered for
the remaining three patients, but their demographic data
suggested Brazilian origin.

Sixty-seven strains (30%) were isolated from patients
diagnosed in either Asuncion or the Central Department
(hereafter referred to jointly as the metropolitan area);
114 (52%) originated from other areas in the Oriental
Region and 39 (18%) were obtained from the sparsely
populated Chaco. One hundred and eighty-four strains
(84%) were isolated from newly diagnosed patients and
the remaining 36 (16%) from patients previously treated
for TB. Thirty-three strains were drug resistant, six of
which were multidrug resistant (i.e. resistant at least to
rifampicin and isoniazid).
Lineage assignment according to spoligotyping
The 220 strains were classified into 79 different spoligopatterns that could be assorted in three groups. The first
group included 173 strains matching 51 shared international types (SITs, patterns shared by two or more isolates) already present in an updated version of the
SpolDB4 database [14]. For these previously described
SITs, Table 1 presents the frequencies found in our study
as compared to frequencies in the international database
at the time of this analysis, as well as their clade denomination. The second group consisted of 32 strains distributed within 13 newly created SITs, as shown in Figure 1.

Five of these new SITs, (2643, 2645, 2647, 2650 and
2654) contained strains only identified in this study. Each
of the remaining eight newly created SITs involved a single strain in this study matching with a previously orphan
strain in SpolDB4. The third group included the remaining 15 strains that did not match with any other spoligopattern in this study nor in SpolDB4 (Table 2).
The frequencies of major M. tuberculosis spoligotype families as defined in the SpolDB4 database [14] ranked in
the following order: Latin-American & Mediterranean
(LAM) 52.3% (115/220), Haarlem 18.2% (40/220), S
clade 9.5% (21/220), an ill-defined T superfamily (not a
clade sensu stricto as it is defined by default) 8.6% (19/
220), X clade 0.9% (2/220) and Beijing clade 0.5% (1/
220). The sole Beijing strain in the study was pansusceptible and had been obtained from a 47 year-old female
South Korean immigrant living in Asuncion. Twenty-two
(10.0 %) strains showed patterns that did not fit within
any of the major clades described in SpolDB4.
IS6110 RFLP analysis and epidemiological clustering
Patterns of the 165 isolates analyzed by IS6110 RFLP contained between four and 19 bands (mean ± SD: 11 ± 3).
The sole strain showing an RFLP pattern with four bands
belonged to the X lineage (the other strain of the X lineage
in the study was not available for RFLP). One hundred
and nineteen distinct RFLP patterns were observed. When
only IS6110 RFLP was considered for clustering analysis,
65 isolates were grouped in 19 clusters of 2, 3, 5, 9 and 10
strains. When both RFLP and spoligotype were analyzed
together, four RFLP clusters were further split off and five
strains were classified as orphan (see Table 3).

Concordant RFLP and spoligotype clustering involved 15/
30 (50%), 20/54 (37%) and 25/81 (31%) strains from the
Chaco, the metropolitan area and the Oriental Region,
respectively. No association was found between clustering
and gender (45/122 among males vs. 16/43 among
females, p = 0.88), age (42/99 < 50 yrs vs. 20/66 ≥ 50 yrs,
p = 1.16), treatment history (10/29 previously treated vs.
47/136 never treated, p = 0.70) or drug resistance (7/29
with any drug resistance vs. 54/136 with no resistance, p
= 0.17). Demographic evidence was consistent with transmission in particular settings such as the Tacumbu jail in
Asuncion, indigenous communities in the Chaco, and a
single household in the metropolitan area.
Strains harboring the SIT34 of the S clade grouped in the
RFLP cluster C together with two other strains harboring
rare spoligotypes: an orphan strain (Py87) and a strain of
the new SIT 2653 (Py51). These two novel spoligopatterns
could be visually considered to be derived from the SIT 34
associated to this RFLP cluster (Figure 1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/75

Similarly, identical or closely-related RFLP patterns were
exhibited by strains classified within each of five new
shared spoligotypes identified exclusively in Paraguay.
These are SITs 2643 (cluster A), 2647 (cluster O), 2650
(cluster P), 2645 and 2654 (Figure 1). In cluster A, IS6110
RFLP grouped strains of the SIT2643 together with one
strain harboring an orphan spoligotype different from but
closely related to SIT 2643. Most strains in this cluster
(cluster A) had been isolated from inmates in the
Tacumbu jail. Apart from these two orphan strains
grouped by RFLP in clusters A and C, the remaining 13
strains with orphan spoligotypes did not match with any
of approximately 2000 RFLP patterns contained in the
database at the Malbran Institute, which gathers patterns
from strains isolated in Argentina and other South American countries.
MIRU-VNTR analysis of new spoligopatterns
Results of MIRU analysis of 30 selected strains with either
new SITs or orphan spoligotypes are summarized in Table
2 and Figure 1. MIRU typing confirmed the clonal nature
of two of the five newly described SITs restricted so far to
Paraguay: SIT 2650-MIT 427 of the LAM lineage and SIT
2643-MIT 182 of the Haarlem lineage. This latter clone is
hereafter named "Tacumbu" after the men's correctional
facility in Asuncion where it was most frequently found; it
included another strain in the same RFLP cluster with an
orphan but related spoligopattern (Py95) isolated from
another inmate in the same jail (Figure 1).

Discussion
We present herein a first insight into the biodiversity of
the M. tuberculosis epidemic in Paraguay. At the same time,
we provide evidence of the suitability of IS6110 RFLP as a
genotyping tool for epidemiological studies in the country, either as a stand-alone tool or, still better, in combination with spoligotyping.
Even though the characteristics of the study sample
favored phylogenetic rather than epidemiological analysis, RFLP analysis by itself produced a concise picture of
TB transmission patterns in Paraguay. In particular, it
served to identify transmission in specific settings such as
indigenous communities in the Chaco and the Tacumbu
jail in Asuncion. The percentage of clustering in different
regions was congruent with the respective regional incidence rates, i.e. highest in the Chaco, intermediate in the
densely populated metropolitan area, and lowest in the
rest of the Oriental Region.
We did not find correlation of clustering with previous TB
treatment or drug resistance, suggesting that in Paraguay
most patients develop drug resistant TB individually
through selective pressure imposed by poorly constructed
or inadequately supervised treatment regimens rather

than through transmission of resistant strains. The age
and gender composition of patients in our sample reflects
the predominance of TB among young male people in
Paraguay. This disease distribution is common to many
low income settings worldwide and could be attributed to
socioeconomic and cultural barriers in the access to health
care [15]. In the present study, however, we failed to find
association of clustering with gender or age, probably due
to the small size of the sample and the short sampling
period. In this sense, we are aware of the fact that genotype clustering analysis underestimates transmission and

that this bias is inversely proportional to length of time
and size of the sample [16].
The relative frequencies of major M. tuberculosis spoligotype families were roughly in range with the overall frequencies described for countries in the South American
region [14,17-20]. The largely predominant LAM lineage,
identified in more than half of the strains in our study,
was ubiquitous in the country. Both its high degree of dissemination and its preponderance among the new
(shared as well as orphan) patterns are manifestations of
the current adaptative evolution of the LAM lineage in

Paraguay. Second in frequency, the Haarlem clade was
found mainly in the metropolitan area. Third in frequency, the S clade was found predominantly in the Oriental Region. The strains classified within the ill-defined T
family were widely distributed within the country. The
IS6110 low-banding pattern X genotype family was rather
unusual and the Beijing genotype was absent in the native
population of our study. The sole Beijing strain identified
in the study was isolated from an East Asian immigrant
who most probably acquired her infection prior to arriving in Paraguay.
An example of congruence between phylogenenetic and
epidemiological findings is the fact that the four most
prevalent SITs in our study accounted for two thirds of the

RFLP/spoligotyping clustered cases, including cases with
epidemiological links (e.g., inmates in Tacumbu jail, cases
in aboriginal communities, household contacts). These
were SIT42 of the LAM9 clade, SIT391 of the LAM4 clade,
SIT34 of the S clade and the newly-created SIT2643 of the
Haarlem clade. As shown by their active ongoing transmission, these SITs could be regarded as highly successful
M. tuberculosis genotypes in Paraguay. Interestingly, two of
these M. tuberculosis sub-lineages seem to have a restricted
geographical distribution: SIT391 has been so far found
only in Brazil (n = 2) and Paraguay (n = 21) and the newly
created SIT2643 (n = 13) is restricted to Paraguay alone.
IS6110 RFLP and MIRU typing confirmed the clonality of
this latter phylogeographically specific genotype, which is
hereby designated as "Tacumbu" genotype. Indeed, this

clone is completely new as it created not only a new SIT
(SIT2643) but also matched a rare MIT (MIT182) in the
database within the Haarlem clade.
Although different mutation mechanisms may converge
into identical spoligopatterns, the main force driving variation in the DR region appears to be deletion of single or
contiguous direct variable repeat sequences [21]. Our data
supports this kind of evolution for some actively trasmitting clones, which may represent emerging genotypes in
Paraguay. For example, the main chain of transmission in
Tacumbu jail included an orphan strain that shared identical MIT and RFLP with other strains in the cluster and
harbored a spoligotype that could well have evolved from
the same Tacumbu SIT through deletion of two contiguous spacers. Likewise, SIT391, endemic in Paraguay
(n:21), has probably evolved to the new SIT2650 (n = 2)
by the loss of one spacer. Similar deletions in the DR
region could have also occurred in two rare strains harboring MIT218 and fitting within the largest RFLP cluster
together with 8 strains of the S clade.
In addition to rapid evolution of some predominant
strains, spoligotyping revealed the geographical specificity
of a number of M. tuberculosis strains in our study. Similar
to findings reported in Venezuela, Brazil and Suriname
[17,18,22] a number of spoligopatterns in our study were
unique among more than 45,000 strains recorded in the
SpolDB4. Most of these strains proved further their singularity when tested by RFLP and/or MIRUs. Moreover,
almost one in ten strains did not fit into any of the major
M. tuberculosis phylogenetic clades described in the
updated database and one in five spoligopatterns in the
study were rarely or never described outside Paraguay.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/75

differ from those lost to genotyping with respect to drug
susceptibility, geographical origin and patient characteristics. Data concerning patient gender, age, geographic origin, date of diagnosis and previous history of TB were
collected from the survey questionnaire. Culture was performed on Löwenstein-Jensen slants in five laboratories of
the national TB network. Species identification and susceptibility testing to first line anti-TB drugs were performed at the Central Public Health Laboratory of the
Ministry of Health using conventional biochemical tests
and the standard proportion method on LöwensteinJensen slants [24].
Genotyping
Chromosomal DNA was prepared by the cetyl-trimethyl
ammonium bromide method from heat inactivated
bacilli suspensions [25]. Spoligotyping was performed on
all 220 isolates by reverse hybridization as described previously [8]. IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was performed according to the standard
protocol [26] on the 165 specimens that yielded a sufficient amount of unbroken DNA to successfully perform
the protocol. Probe labeling, in the case of RFLP, and
detection of hybridizing DNA, in both RFLP and spoligotyping, was done by enhanced chemiluminiscence (ECL
kit, Amersham, Little Chalfont, England) followed by
exposure to X-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham).

Methods

The number of repeats of 12 MIRUs (MIRU No. 2, 4, 10,
16, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 31, 39 and 40) was investigated on
selected isolates by amplification and visual assessment of
amplicon size as previously described [27]. PCR mixtures
consisted of 0.5 µM (each) dNTP (Qbiogene), 2 mM
MgCl2 (Amersham), 10% DMSO, 1 × recombinant Taq
buffer mix (Amersham), 0.5 U rTaq (Amersham), 0.3 µM
each primer and 1 µl DNA. The final volume of each reaction was 30 µl. Samples were amplified in a GeneAmp
PCR system 9600 (Perkin Elmer-Applied BiosystemsBasel, Switzerland) by using an amplification profile of 10
min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 60s at 60°C and 2
min at 72°C. DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel (Invitrogen) and the
number of MIRU copies corresponding to the respective
bands sizes was then calculated. The tables used for
MIRU-VNTR allele scoring are available at [28].

Clinical isolates
The 220 M. tuberculosis strains examined in this cross-sectional study were isolated from the same number of
patients with pulmonary TB and positive acid fast bacilli
smear examination recruited consecutively during the
national survey of drug resistance carried out in Paraguay
during 2003. These strains represented 77% of the 286
strains composing the drug resistance survey, which was
designed applying the cluster sampling procedure. The
220 strains of the survey available for genotyping did not

Computer analysis
Digitalized images of autoradiographs were submitted to
computer analysis using the software Bionumerics version
4.0 (Applied Math, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium), as
described previously [29]. RFLP intra- and inter-experiment normalization was performed using strain Mt14323
DNA as an external marker. Similarity among banding
patterns was calculated using the Dice coefficient with 1%
tolerance and 1% optimization. Clustering analysis was

Conclusion
Paraguay's current TB epidemic seems to consist of a wide
diversity of sublineages among which a few LAM, Haarlem and S genotypes prevail and are evolving actively. The
lineages of tubercle bacilli currently thriving in this rather
secluded South American niche may reflect the local hostpathogen adaptation of strains introduced into the country during past migrations from European countries [23].

infected with M. tuberculosis strains showing identical
RFLP and spoligopatterns.
