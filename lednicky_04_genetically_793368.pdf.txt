Abstract
Background: Mortality rates have differed during distemper outbreaks among free-ranging raccoons (Procyon
lotor) living around a large Chicago-area zoo, and appeared higher in year 2001 than in 1998 and 2000. We
hypothesized that a more lethal variant of the local Canine distemper virus (CDV) lineage had emerged in 2001, and
sought the genetic basis that led to increased virulence. However, a more complex model surfaced during
preliminary analyses of CDV genomic sequences in infected tissues and of virus isolated in vitro from the raccoons.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses of subgenomic CDV fusion (F) -, phosphoprotein (P) -, and complete hemagglutinin
(H) – gene sequences indicated that distinct American CDV lineages caused the distemper epizootics. The 1998
outbreak was caused by viruses that are likely from an old CDV lineage that includes CDV Snyder Hill and Lederle,
which are CDV strains from the early 1950's. The 2000 and 2001 viruses appear to stem from the lineage of CDV
A75/17, which was isolated in the mid 1970's. Only the 2001 viruses formed large syncytia in brain and/or lung
tissue, and during primary isolation in-vitro in Vero cells, demonstrating at least one phenotypic property by which
they differed from the other viruses.
Conclusions: Two different American CDV lineages caused the raccoon distemper outbreaks. The 1998 viruses
are genetically distant to the 2000/2001 viruses. Since CDV does not cause persistent infections, the cycling of
different CDV lineages within the same locale suggests multiple reintroductions of the virus to area raccoons.
Our findings establish a precedent for determining whether the perceived differences in mortality rates are actual
and attributable in part to inherent differences between CDV strains arising from different CDV lineages.

Background
Canine distemper virus (CDV) (family Paramyxoviridae,
genus Morbillivirus) is a single-stranded (negative-sense)
enveloped RNA virus that is highly contagious and transmitted predominantly by aerosols [1]. Long known to
cause potentially lethal disease among members of the
Canidae, Mustelidae, and Procyonidae, CDV has recently
been detected as a cause of morbidity and mortality in
large felids [2], fresh-water seals (Phoca sibirica) [3], and
various other animals. CDV killed more than 10,000 Caspian seals (Phoca caspica) in year 2000 [4], and decimated
an African wild dog (an endangered species) breeding
pack [5], demonstrating that CDV epidemics can be catastrophic. It also killed 1/3 of the Serengeti lions (Panthera
leo) in 1994, whereas mortality due to CDV had not been
previously described in large felids [6]. However, CDV is
not uniformly lethal in related species; unlike the situation with lions, house cats (Felis sylvestris catus) can be
infected by CDV wherein pathogenesis is unclear [7,8].
The increased importance of emerging pathogens has
been most commonly attributed to changes in interactions between species or other ecological parameters [9],
though changes in the pathogens or host susceptibility
could also play a role. Closely related genomic variants of
a particular RNA virus can arise within a host, forming a
population of viruses referred to as quasispecies [10,11].
Viral quasispeciation can generate new disease patterns
and broaden host ranges [10-12]. It is possible that CDV
quasispeciation may account for the increasing number of
clinically typical distemper cases in dogs [including those
vaccinated against CDV). This implies the emergence of
CDVs with different antigenic properties from the vaccine
strains [5,13-15,23].
Serological tests of various captive carnivores in 1997
indicated seroconversion to CDV occurred among 28% of
large felids after they were housed in outdoor exhibits at a
large zoo located near Chicago (Illinois, USA) (T. Meehan
and L. Hungerford, unpublished). The animals were CDV
seronegative prior to outdoor display, and had not been
vaccinated against CDV. Seroconversion did not occur
among large felids kept indoors. It was thus apparent that
the large felids acquired CDV infections during outdoor
display. Distemper epizootics occur sporadically among
area raccoons (Procyon lotor), and free-ranging raccoons
were implicated as the source of CDV to the susceptible
animals of the zoo, as large numbers of raccoons from
adjoining forest preserves forage on the zoo grounds. The
raccoons potentially transmit CDV to zoo animals indirectly through droplet infection and perhaps also through
contact infection of nasal and oropharyngeal mucosa,
since they are sometimes caught and consumed by zoo
carnivores. Although CDV can cause high mortality in raccoons [16,17], it can also circulate widely in a population

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/2

with many survivors, as documented by seroprevalence
studies [18]. This suggests not only a substantial disease
reservoir, but also the possibility of CDV strains with different levels of virulence. The latter notion cannot be readily resolved by current serology approaches, especially
considering that CDV is presently considered monotypic
by serology. For zoos where free-ranging raccoons can regularly be found, there is concern that CDV carried by raccoons might pose a health risk to susceptible collection
species for two reasons: (a) CDV is highly infectious and
an acknowledged lethal pathogen of many carnivores,
and (b) CDV might mutate into a variant capable of
broad-spectrum lethality. Wild raccoons were previously
incriminated as the source of epizootics in captive carnivores in zoological collections and conservation parks
[2,19]. Also, clinically apparent CDV infections occur in
some omnivores such as Japanese snow monkeys (Macaca
fuscata) [20] and collared peccaries (Tayassu tajacu) [21],
raising the possibility that CDV might also cause lethal
epidemics among non-carnivores.
Live raccoons are trapped on zoo grounds. Those with
clinical neurologic signs are euthanized, necropsied, and
examined for evidence of distemper or other infections.
Dead raccoons found on-site are similarly evaluated
whenever possible [22]. These procedures are routinely
conducted as part of disease surveillance initiatives of the
zoo and local and state agencies, especially because rabies
is a major concern, and neurological signs that occur in
distemper sometimes mimic rabies [22].
Distemper was detected in raccoons on zoo grounds in
years 1998, 2000, and 2001 but not in 1999, 2002, and
2003. A total of 9/25 (36%) of the animals submitted for
necropsy in 1998 and 1/14 (7%) in 2000 had lesions consistent with CDV infection. The number of animals submitted in 2001 was higher (n = 49) than for years 1998
and 2000, as was the percentage positive for CDV: 26/49
(45%). Precise data about the number of animals living
within the forest preserve was not available. It was also
not known whether significantly different numbers of animals utilized the zoo during the time line of this study
(1998–2002). Nevertheless, there appeared to be a surge in
distemper mortality in 2001, and comprehensive
necropsy evaluations (performed by the same pathologist) revealed that the CDV lesions of the 2001 animals
differed somewhat from those seen in the 1998 and 2000
animals. Since phylogenetic analyses suggest that wildtype CDVs differ according to geographical distribution
rather than to host species [6,23], we asked whether a
local CDV strain had mutated into a more virulent variant
in 2001, causing the perceived rise in mortality and differences in histological presentation.

We first sought to identify the local lineage of CDV
through direct sequence analysis of viral RNA (vRNA) in
infected raccoon tissues and also attempted virus isolation
from the specimens. Virus isolation was important not
only to confirm direct sequence analyses but also: (a)
because it was possible that direct sequence analyses
might not work for various technical reasons, and (b) for
future vaccine development in the event that unusual viral
variants were detected for which current vaccines were
ineffective. Following the example of previous investigators, we tried to obtain the identity of the circulating local
CDV by determining the sequence of a subsection of the
CDV phosphoprotein (P) gene, since the P-gene tends to
remain conserved within clades of a given CDV lineage
[24], and is useful for phylogenetic analysis [5,24,25]. To
reduce the risk of bias arising from analysis of only one
section of the CDV genome, we also examined a subsection of the CDV fusion (F) gene sequence that encodes a
protein cleavage site [subtilisin-like endoprotease motif (R-X-K/R-R-)] and the fusion domain [26]. The F-protein is
the most conserved among morbilliviruses [27], and the
F-gene sequence can be used to determine phylogenetic
relationships between different morbillivirus species,
such as the relationship between CDV and the closely
related morbillivirus of salt-water seals called Phocine distemper virus-1 (PDV-1) [28]. F-gene analysis would thus
help establish whether the virus was authentic CDV and
not a related raccoon morbillivirus. Finally, the entire
CDV receptorbinding hemagglutinin (H) gene was analyzed, since the H protein is the major determinant of tropism and cytopathogenicity [29], and is useful for
phylogenetic analyses [6,23].
Whereas all the viruses were related to American CDV
strains, the 1998 and 2001 viruses were clearly resolved by
phylogenetic analyses into two genetically distant CDV
clusters (lineages). The 2000 virus apparently stems from
a sublineage related to the 2001 viruses.

Results
Pathology evaluation
In general, the results obtained from gross and histologic
examinations of the animals were typical for CDVinduced distemper. Major findings included non-suppurative encephalitis and necrotizing bronchointerstitial
pneumonia of variable severity (Table 1). As expected for
wild raccoons of this area, multicentric parasitism was
common, but additional underlying diseases were generally not noted. The presence of Encephalomyocarditis virus
(EMCV) in animals 01-2641 and 01-2690, however, was
unexpected.

Histologic differences in the CDV lesions were apparent.
While lymphoid depletion and characteristic eosinophilic
intracytoplasmic inclusions in various epithelial tissues

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/2

were observed in all years, inclusion bodies were more
plentiful in the brain and lung tissues of raccoons examined in year 2001 than those of years 1998 and 2000. Of
note, small and large (multinucleated) syncytia were
present in the central nervous system and (Fig. 1A) and
lung (Fig. 1B) of some raccoons from year 2001 but not in
animals from 1998 and 2000 (Table 1).
Isolation of virus from infected tissues
Virus was isolated from the tissues of 11/11 animals
(Table 2) [22]. Viral cytopathic effects (CPE) in Vero cells
consisted of the formation of granular-appearing cytoplasm with vacuolization (small vacuoles), followed by
rounding of the cells and detachment, and rare formation
of small stellate syncytia (consisting of 2–3 cells fused
together) for viruses isolated from year 1998 and 2000
specimens or frequent larger rounded syncytia typically
containing >8 nuclei in viruses from year 2001 [22]. Thus,
the 2001 viruses appeared to form large syncytia in vivo
(Table 1) and in vitro [22].
RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analyses
Where direct comparisons were possible, viral genomic
sequence analyses indicated that the subgenomic viral Fand P- and full-genomic H-gene sequences did not change
during primary isolation in three different cell lines
(MDCK, MV1 Lu, and Vero [22]. Thus, for viruses from
animals 98-2645, 98-2646, and 98-2655, for which direct
RT-PCR from infected tissues failed (Table 2), it was likely
that the sequences obtained were authentic.

The subgenomic F- and P- gene of this study were previously reported [22] and deposited at GenBank (Table 3).
The full-genomic H-gene sequences are available at GenBank (Table 3); since the H-gene sequences are relatively
long (1,824 bp), only the deduced aa sequences are
shown (Fig. 2). As for the P-gene, virus CDV 98-2666 had
two slightly different H-gene sequences that were detected
in vRNA in infected tissues; the same H-gene sequences
were detected in corresponding virus isolates. The dominant H-gene sequence determined directly from infected
tissues is labelled 98-2666 (Fig. 2, and H-gene sequence
98-2666 in Table 3), and is identical to the sequence of
variant 98-2666-1 (Fig. 2, and H-gene sequence 98-26661 in Table 3), whereas the H-gene sequence of the second
variant is labelled 98-2666-2. An example of RT-PCR for
the CDV H-gene of a primary virus isolate in Vero cells is
shown in figure 3.
Phylogenetic analyses
The 70% majority-rule consensus parsimony (Fig. 4) and
neighbor-joining (not shown) cladograms for the P-gene
sequences are almost identical. Both analyses grouped the
1998 sequences together in a single clade with CDV-Lederle and -Snyder Hill with high bootstrap support. These

viruses have P-gene sequences similar to those of CDVs
Onderstepoort and Rockport, from S. Africa and Sweden,
respectively. The cluster of the 2001 sequences (01-2663,
-2676, -2689, -2690) was also the same in both cladograms. However, while parsimony joined the 01-2641
sequence from an offsite raccoon to the base, the distance
based tree grouped this sequence with CDV A75/17. The
2000 virus was also not resolved by either method of analysis. Of the 390 bases, 34 were informative. Derivatives of
the 1998 cluster form a distantly related lineage to that of
2001 cluster that is nevertheless rooted in the CDV group
when compared to PDV-1 as an outgroup. CDV Lederle
appears to be more derived than A9224/14b (detected in
1992 in a California (USA) raccoon [6]).

There were a total of 335 nucleotides in the F-gene and 32
of these were parsimony informative. Both parsimony
(Fig. 5) and distance based (not shown) analyses
produced the same topology. The off-site raccoon 012641 failed to group with any other sequences, joining at
the base. The 1998 sequences formed a single cluster
within a clade that included Lederle, Snyder Hill, and vaccine strains Onderstepoort and Bul. 170 (originally isolated from a Bulgarian dog) [30]. This clade also included
the 00-2601 sequence. The remaining 2001 viruses
formed a single clade with high bootstrap support.
The H-gene parsimony (Fig. 6) and neighbor-joining (not
shown) topologies were identical with respect to the
clades that include the raccoon viruses from this study.

Out of 1,824 nucleotides, 420 of these were parsimony
informative. As with the previous genes, the 1998 isolates
and the 2000/2001 viruses formed separate clusters. The
1998 sequences joined the tree at a basal position in both
analyses. The 2000 and off-site raccoon 01-2641
sequences grouped with the large felids from another zoo
in Illinois.
Noteworthy, P-, F- and H- gene analyses indicate that the
CDV sequences segregate according to geography and not
to species. Since the H gene had the largest number of
nucleotides, pairwise genetic distances were calculated.
The 1998 isolates were most similar to the Onderstepoort
and Snyder Hill (D = 4% and 1% respectively) while the
2001 isolates were most distant (D = 9% and 10% respectively). Distances within 1998 viruses were low (D ≤
0.2%); within 2001, distances were slightly higher (D =
1%); and comparing years 1998 with 2000 and 2001, distances were highest (D = 7% to 9% respectively).
When the P-, F- and H- genes were combined into a single
linear sequence and analyzed using parsimony and neighbor-joining algorithms with only PDV-1 as an outgroup,
two independent clades are formed, the 1998 clade and
the 2000/2001 clade (data not shown). In the later group,
both methods join the 2000 sequence (00-2601) at a
basal position to the 01-2641 off-site raccoon followed by
the 2001 isolates.

Discussion
This report shows that different CDV sublineages stemming from at least two genetically distant CDV lineages
recently circulated through the local raccoon population.
Our conclusion is based on numerous observations:
differences in the lesions observed in animal tissues, possible dissimilarities of virulence between the viruses, variation in one viral phenotype in tissue culture (formation
of large syncytia by the 2001 viruses), and from the results
of nucleotide sequence and phylogenetic analyses. CDV is
not maintained in hosts that recover from distemper, and
persistent CDV infections do not occur. However, CDV
infects a wide range of genera, and though each individual
population may be small, the number of alternative host
species may be substantial [1]. Forest preserves around the
zoo contain many species susceptible to CDV, and it
appears by inference there are separate reservoirs of different CDV lineages within the area of this study.
Since past studies indicated that wild-type CDVs differed
according to geographical distribution [6,23], we initially
surmised that the local CDV occasionally formed clades of
highly virulent CDV variants, resulting in periodic high
mortality distemper outbreaks. We also speculated that
over time, highly virulent viruses would undergo extinction, and ensuing epizootics would arise from less virulent CDV variants that could affect most of the hosts
without killing them. Thus, there would be an apparent

oscillation (periodicity) of the mortality rates. The situation is not as straightforward, however. As shown in figures 4,5,6, at least two different CDV lineages circulated in
the raccoons from 1998 – 2001. Our findings thus suggest
that the outcomes of distemper might also be influenced
by properties unique to different CDV lineages and their
genetic variants ("strains").
The viruses from year 2001 formed syncytia in vivo and in
vitro. Previously, an inverse relationship between the proficiency of syncytium formation and the level of CDV virulence was reported: the more attenuated a strain is, the
higher its fusogenicity, and fusogenicity was attributed to
the viral H-protein [31-34]. Therefore, the findings of this
study may appear antidogmatic because increased mortality was associated with the 2001 viruses, which formed
large syncytia in vivo and in vitro. However, past notions
concerning the inverse relationship between fusogenicity
and virulence may be imprecise. Indeed, virulent wildtype CDVs that formed syncytia in Vero cells were recently

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/2

reported; the same study demonstrated that genetic
changes within the H-gene were not required for CDV
growth in Vero cells [35], as was found in this and our previous study [22]. Also, newer studies indicate that syncytium formation by CDV requires the concerted activities
of both the H- and F- proteins [36-38], and that CDV virulence is the combined affect of various proteins including
the F- and H- proteins [39]. Thus, whereas animal studies
were not performed with the virus isolates of this study to
directly test whether they differ in virulence, the formation of large syncytia does not rule out the possibility that
the 2001 viruses are highly virulent. Noteworthy, the
2001 viruses were detected in the hippocampus and alveoli of the raccoons. Both sites were considered unusual
targets of a CDV variant that was lethal to Serengeti lions,
whereas CDV in dogs was said to most frequently target
the brain stem and bronchi [40,41]. It is possible that tissue localization, especially with regard to the hippocampus, correlates with virus strain. In our experience, CDV in
raccoons does not preferentially target the brain stem but
rather infects all portions of the brain, with the possible
exception of the hippocampus. We will be able to address
the question whether specific CDV strains localize in the
hippocampus of raccoons as we accumulate additional
data from future outbreak, and after we conduct animal
tests with the viruses we isolated. In contrast, CDV targets
epithelial cells, and the presence of CDV in the alveoli of
raccoons with distemper is common.
H-gene phylogenetic analyses (figure 6) suggest that a
viral lineage that includes CDV A75/17 (isolated in 1975)
[32] and the 2000 and 2001 viruses had infected various
species including large felids [Fig. 6 and reference 6] for at
least 28 years on both coasts and a midwestern state (and
thus presumably throughout the continental USA). The
seemingly widespread distribution suggests that viruses
stemming from this lineage may be the dominant "American" CDV currently in circulation in the continental USA.
The F -, H-, and P-gene sequence analyses (figures 4,5,6)
indicate that the 1998 viruses stem from a different CDV
lineage that includes American CDV strains Lederle and
Snyder Hill. A recent phylogenetic analysis of the P-gene
by an independent laboratory that utilized some of our Pgene data generated similar results [42]. Because they were
isolated before CDV Lederle and Snyder Hill were
acquired from the ATCC for this study and have distinguishable F- and H-gene sequences [22], it is certain that
the 1998 CDV isolates are not due to laboratory contamination. Yet, phylogenetic analyses indicate that the CDV
Lederle and Snyder Hill sequences are distant to, and in
the case of the H-gene, ancestral to, those of the 2000 and
2001 viruses, which are as genetically distant from the
1998 viruses as they are from Snyder Hill. The source of
the 1998 viruses is thus intriguing. Prior to 1997, some
area raccoons were trapped, vaccinated against CDV, then

NJ), though, was made with CDV Onderstepoort, which is
easily distinguished from the 1998 viruses by F-, H-, and
P-gene analyses. However, we still could not rule out the
possibility that the 1998 viruses are vaccine escape viruses
from a dog vaccinated with CDV Lederle. Dogs and raccoons often frequent the same feeding sites (such as refuse
disposal zones) in urban areas. The possibility of reversion to virulence of attenuated CDV exists [43], and a vaccine escape virus was proposed as a cause of distemper in
a dog in Belfast, Northern Ireland [3]. We could not find
a current manufacturer of anti-CDV vaccine in the USA
that uses CDV Lederle. However, such vaccines were in
distribution overseas around 1998 [22], and the Chicago
area undergoes constant population flux, including translocation of inhabitants (and their pets) from outside of
the continental USA. Related to this, the live attenuated
CDV vaccine (Galaxy-D) used by the zoo up to 1997
caused vaccine-mediated distemper in different species at
the zoo that had been vaccinated. For this reason, use of
that particular vaccine was discontinued; instead,
Purevax™, a recombinant CDV-canary pox virus vaccine
(Merial, Duluth, GA) is used; the CDV insert in the canary
pox virus genome is incomplete and cannot be infectious.
CDV-Lederle was isolated in 1951 from a dog with
encephalitis (information provided by ATCC). An alternative interpretation of our findings is that the CDV lineage
that gave rise to CDV Lederle has stabilized in the local
animals and is still actively circulating; more studies are
needed to resolve this matter.
EMCV has been isolated or detected in raccoons before
[44,45]. However, pathogenesis was uncertain, and it was
thought that raccoons are a dead-end host for this virus
[45]. It is known that mortality during an active case of
distemper is increased in the presence of polymicrobial
disease [46]. For example, a lethal outcome occurs in dogs
co-infected with CDV, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Toxoplasma gondii. It is possible that the increased mortality in
2001 was due to secondary infections with EMCV; however, no lesions attributable to EMCV were observed in
pathology exams of the animals of this study, and EMCV
was not isolated from all of the 2001 specimens. The significance of isolating EMCV from the brain tissue of animal 01-2641 is thus uncertain.
Our findings are especially useful for the molecular epidemiology of CDV in local wildlife, as they provide a molecular basis for CDV surveillance in area wildlife. Whereas it
is considered difficult to obtain field isolates of CDV, we
succeeded and can now obtain complete viral genomic
sequence data (it would be difficult to do so relying solely
on the limited amount of archived CDV-infected tissues
from the animals of this work). Taken together, we can
now monitor viral genetic drift during a long-term study
of CDV in local raccoons, and will be able to conduct ani-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/1/1/2

mal studies with the newly isolated viruses. We can also
clone relevant CDV virulence genes, and express and study
the biochemical properties of their specific products in
vitro. The baseline genetic values established here will be
helpful toward the development of a contemporary fieldbased model (since the animals are free-ranging) for studies on the emergence, evolution, maintenance, and transmission of morbilliviruses, and the efficacy of vaccines
against changing viruses.

Conclusions
The 1998 and 2001 distemper outbreaks were caused by
two genetically distant American CDV lineages. Since
CDV does not cause persistent infections, the cycling of
different CDV lineages within the same locale suggests
multiple reservoirs were responsible for the reintroduction of the virus to area raccoons. Whereas different susceptible species of the forest preserves and perhaps also
some caged animals of the zoo are the most likely reservoirs, our study raises the possibility that vaccines might
also be a source of CDV. The perceived differences in
mortality rates that occur during intermittent distemper
epizootics may be attributed in part to inherent differences between CDV strains.

each collected in year 2001) (Table 2).
Virus isolation
Detailed virus isolation procedures were described previously [22]. Briefly, CDV was isolated in vitro in MDCK,
MV1-Lu, and Vero cells, eliminating the need for virus isolation in specific pathogen-free animals or in primary
macrophages or other suitable cells derived thereof [29].
RNA purification and RT-PCR
RNA purification and RT-PCR methods were previously
detailed [22]. Briefly, vRNA was extracted directly from
infected tissues when possible, as well as from CDVinfected tissue culture cells or from liberated CDV virions
in spent cell growth media, using dedicated commercial
kits (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). For the American CDV
strains of this work, many RT-PCR primers based on the
sequence of American CDV isolate A75/17 (GenBank No.
AF164967) were more effective than primers described for
foreign CDV strains [22].

Nucleic acid sequencing
Methods used for nucleic acid sequencing were previously
described [22]. Briefly, all sequences were determined at
least twice, starting from the purification of new RNA
samples from each specimen, and both strands of each
PCR amplicon were sequenced. Slab-gel sequencing utilizing dye-terminator chemistries (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE)
was used at the inception of the project, then replaced by
capillary sequencing using ABI-PRISM technology
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The CDV gene
sequences in infected tissues were exactly like those in
matched primary viral isolates [22]. The GenBank accession numbers for all the virus sequences of this work are
given in Table 3.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic trees of the P-, F-, and H-gene sequences
were constructed using the maximum-parsimony and
neighbor-joining algorithms in Phylogeny Analysis Using
Parsimony (PAUP) Beta Version 4.0B10 for Macintosh
[47]. Heuristic searches were conducted with "simple"
addition and the tree-bisection-reconnection method of
branch swapping. Distance-based analyses using the minimum-evolution criterion were also conducted within
PAUP using Kimura's-two-parameter model [48]. Phylogenetic tree reliability was estimated with 1000 bootstrap
replications [49,50]. The appropriate Phocine distemper
virus sequence (PDV-1) was included for outgroup
rooting.

P-gene phylogenetic analyses were performed after an
alignment of 25 P-gene sequences. Each P-gene sequence
consisted of 390 ungapped positions (nucleotides 2154 to
2543 of CDV reference strain Onderstepoort) within the
P-gene PCR amplicon. Only the internal 390 bp section of
the P-gene PCR amplicon (432 bp) was analyzed because
many relevant GenBank entries did not include the entire
sequence amplified by the P-gene primers of this study.
An additional P-gene sequence for raccoon A9224/14b
was obtained from published data currently not deposited
at GenBank [6]. Similarly, 24 ungapped F-gene sequences
corresponding to nt 5399–5733 (335 bp) of CDV Onderstepoort were analyzed. Unlike the P- and F-genes, the
entire H-gene was analyzed since many complete H-gene
sequences were available at GenBank. Phocine distemper
virus 1 (PDV1) sequences were included in the analyses
for outgroup rooting.
