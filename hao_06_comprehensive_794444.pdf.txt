Abstract
Background: The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes ten proteins that share sequence similarity with
the Hedgehog signaling molecule through their C-terminal autoprocessing Hint/Hog domain. These
proteins contain novel N-terminal domains, and C. elegans encodes dozens of additional proteins
containing only these N-terminal domains. These gene families are called warthog, groundhog, ground-like
and quahog, collectively called hedgehog (hh)-related genes. Previously, the expression pattern of seventeen
genes was examined, which showed that they are primarily expressed in the ectoderm.
Results: With the completion of the C. elegans genome sequence in November 2002, we reexamined and
identified 61 hh-related ORFs. Further, we identified 49 hh-related ORFs in C. briggsae. ORF analysis
revealed that 30% of the genes still had errors in their predictions and we improved these predictions here.
We performed a comprehensive expression analysis using GFP fusions of the putative intergenic
regulatory sequence with one or two transgenic lines for most genes. The hh-related genes are expressed
in one or a few of the following tissues: hypodermis, seam cells, excretory duct and pore cells, vulval
epithelial cells, rectal epithelial cells, pharyngeal muscle or marginal cells, arcade cells, support cells of
sensory organs, and neuronal cells. Using time-lapse recordings, we discovered that some hh-related genes
are expressed in a cyclical fashion in phase with molting during larval development. We also generated
several translational GFP fusions, but they did not show any subcellular localization. In addition, we also
studied the expression patterns of two genes with similarity to Drosophila frizzled, T23D8.1 and
F27E11.3A, and the ortholog of the Drosophila gene dally-like, gpn-1, which is a heparan sulfate
proteoglycan. The two frizzled homologs are expressed in a few neurons in the head, and gpn-1 is
expressed in the pharynx. Finally, we compare the efficacy of our GFP expression effort with EST, OST
and SAGE data.
Conclusion: No bona-fide Hh signaling pathway is present in C. elegans. Given that the hh-related gene
products have a predicted signal peptide for secretion, it is possible that they constitute components of
the extracellular matrix (ECM). They might be associated with the cuticle or be present in soluble form in
the body cavity. They might interact with the Patched or the Patched-related proteins in a manner similar
to the interaction of Hedgehog with its receptor Patched.

Background
The Hh signaling pathway is important for the development of animals from flies to vertebrates. It is an intercellular signaling pathway that regulates cell fate
specification, cell proliferation and cell survival of different target cells [1]. In brief, the signaling cell produces a
Hh precursor that is composed of the N-terminal domain
(Hh-N), which is responsible for signaling, and the C-terminal Hint/Hog domain, where the proteolytic activity
resides. Hh undergoes autocatalytic cleavage through its
Hint domain and simultaneously anchors a cholesterol to
the C terminus of Hh-N [2]. By further modification
through addition of a palmitate at its N terminus, the
mature signaling molecule Hh-N is generated. It is targeted to the cell membrane and tethered to it by lipid moieties. With the help of Dispatched the tethered Hh-N is
released to the extracellular environment, where it can
move several cell diameters to target cells. Molecules in
the ECM, such as Dally-like, regulate the spread of Hh-N.
In this way, Hh-N morphogens are distributed in a gradient that precisely patterns tissues. On the membrane of
the target cell, the direct receptor Patched constitutively
inhibits the activity of Smoothened (Smo). Upon binding
to Hh-N, the inhibition of Smo is relieved and the signal
transduces downstream through PKA and the Fu/SuFu/
Costal-2 complex to the effector, Ci, a transcription factor
[3].
In C. elegans there is no complete Hh signaling pathway,
since it lacks a bona fide Hh, Smo and Fu/SuFu/Costal-2
complex. However, Dispatched, Patched and Ci are conserved [4]. One of the two Dispatched proteins, CHE-14,
is involved in exocytosis [5]. The patched (ptc) and
patched-related genes (ptr) have undergone substantial
expansion in C. elegans; there are two patched genes, one
ptc pseudogene, two dispatched (che-14, ptd-2), and 24
patched-related (ptr) genes [6]. ptc-1 is expressed in oocytes
and involved in cytokinesis [6], and ptr-7 (daf-6) has been
assigned a function in endocytosis during tubulogenesis
[7]. tra-1, the ortholog of Ci, is involved in regulating sex
determination [8]. Using RNA interference (RNAi),
Zugasti et al. (2005) found that disruption of several hhrelated genes as well as many ptc and ptr genes leads to
molting defective phenotypes, suggesting that both hhrelated genes and ptc and ptr genes might be involved in a
common developmental pathway [9].
C. elegans has a hypodermis that ensheaths the entire
body. During embryogenesis, the ectoderm is composed
of six rows of cells that fuse with each other to form a few
syncytia. In larvae, hyp1 to hyp6 envelope the head, the
largest syncytium hyp7 constitutes the main body hypodermis, and hyp8 to hyp11 compose the tail. On the sides
of the body there are two lateral hypodermal syncytia, the
seam cells. All of these hypodermal cells secrete ECM

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/280

components that form the cuticle, which forms the
worm's exoskeleton. The cuticle, the hypodermis, and the
underlying muscle and its basement membrane are
anchored together by fibrous organelles to form a structure necessary for efficient locomotion of the worm. The
openings of the worm, including the buccal cavity, sensory organs, excretory duct and pore, vulva and anus are
formed by cells with epithelial properties that connect to
the hypodermal syncytium. They are also covered by cuticle that connects to the body cuticle.
Hh is the only protein known to be modified by cholesterol through autocleavage mediated by its own Hint/Hog
domain. However, although there is no bona fide Hh, the
C. elegans genome encodes ten genes each with a conserved C-terminal Hint/Hog domain [10,11]. These proteins contain different types of N-terminal domains, and
C. elegans encodes dozens of additional proteins containing only these N-terminal domains [4,11]. Based on the
different N-terminal domains, these genes can be classified into four gene families – warthog (wrt), groundhog
(grd), ground-like (grl), and quahog (qua). These four gene
families are conserved in nematodes, but not in other
phyla, and their gene products have predicted signal peptides for secretion [11]. Because a hh gene has recently
been identified in cnidarians, the most parsimonious
explanation for these nematode specific gene families is
that they are evolutionarily derived from a hh gene in early
nematode evolution [12], and that the loss of the Hog
domain in many of the genes is a secondary event, as earlier postulated [11].
One of the Hint/Hog-containing peptides, WRT-1, has
been shown to be autocleaved in vitro [13]. Previously,
the gene expression patterns of eight wrt genes, eight grd
genes and qua-1 were analyzed [11,14,15]. These genes
were found to be mainly expressed in the hypodermis,
seam cells, the excretory duct and pore, support cells of
sensory organs, and some neuronal cells [11]. As a first
step to gain insights into the function of the unstudied hhrelated genes, we made a comprehensive analysis of the
expression patterns of these genes using transcriptional
GFP fusions.

Results
C. elegans contains 61 hh-related open reading frames
(ORFs) and C. briggsae 49
In November 2002, the C. elegans genome sequence was
completely finished, with no gaps remaining. To determine the final complement of hh-related genes we performed comprehensive tblastn, blastp and PSI-blast
searches of the C. elegans genome with all previously
known hh-related genes [11]. Likewise, we searched the
genome of C. briggsae for homologs. The previously
unnamed ground-like genes were given the official designa-

tion grl and numbered. In our searches we identified four
additional genes in C. elegans (grl-24, grl-25, grl-26, grl-27)
(Table 1), yielding a total of 61 hh-related ORFs. 49 hhrelated genes were retrieved from C. briggsae [see Additional file 1]. Three of the C. elegans hh-related ORFs are
pseudogenes, two contain frame shifts (grd-17p and grl30p) and one (grl-32p) is a duplication of only the last two
exons of another grl gene. This was corroborated by consultation with the Genome Sequencing Consortium to
verify that these aberrations are not sequencing errors.

have one to one corresponding orthologs between C. elegans and C. briggsae. However, in C. elegans we find one grl
gene cluster that has expanded from a single gene into six
ORFs, two of which are pseudogenes (Fig. 2). This locus
has other hallmarks of recent gene duplication activity,
such as a 5 kb large inverted repeat, which duplicated the
last two exons of grl-27 to give rise to grl-32p (Fig. 2). Contained within the big repeat is a smaller duplicated segment, which could have transposed regulatory elements
from F40C5.1 to T24A6.17 (both not hh-related genes).

In the course of this analysis we also checked the ORF predictions. We compared orthologous genes between C. elegans and C. briggsae as well as similarity between closely
homologous C. elegans genes (see Methods). Furthermore, we verified N-terminal sequences using the SignalP
server to determine, whether a signal sequence for protein
export was present. Despite the fact that a previous publication [11] was available defining the features of these
genes, we found that 30% of the genes in Wormbase in
2003 still had errors in their ORF predictions. In many
instances this was in the N-terminal exons (Table 1). After
correcting the ORFs, we found that all genes except a gene
that we named hog-1 encoded a good signal sequence for
protein export according to SignalP. hog-1 encodes only
the C-terminal autocatalytic domain and no trace of an
upstream N-terminal domain could be identified, even by
comparison with the orthologous genomic region of C.
briggsae. The evolutionary conservation of hog-1 suggests
that this gene is not simply a pseudogene that lost the Nterminal region. Our improved predictions were submitted to Wormbase and the new nomenclature can be found
in WS release 153 and later releases. Since we made these
predictions, additional EST data has become available –
primarily from a recent batch of ESTs from the Exelixis
Caenorhabditis elegans EST project – and ten of our ORF
predictions have now been independently verified. C. elegans has 12 hh-related ORFs more than C. briggsae. This is
entirely due to C. elegans specific gene duplications. C.
briggsae has one wrt gene less. C. elegans wrt-7 and wrt-8 are
very similar and lie next to each other on the chromosome, indicating a tandem duplication event, and only a
single co-ortholog exists in C. briggsae. For the grd and grl
genes we performed phylogenetic analysis to verify
orthology (Fig. 1). Three grd genes, grd-1, grd-2, and grd-11
each encode four Ground domains, and there is only a
single corresponding co-ortholog in C. briggsae. Of the
three C. elegans genes, grd-1 is the most conserved, while
grd-2 and grd-11 are more divergent. A small cluster of
three grd genes (grd-13, grd-3, grd-10, and grd-14, grd-4,
grd-5) is duplicated in C. elegans [11], and only one corresponding cluster is present in C. briggsae. C. elegans grd-5
and C. briggsae grd-5 have separated from their respective
clusters, however. The C. elegans pseudogene grd-17p is a
recent duplicate of grd-3. In the case of the grl genes, most

hh-related genes are expressed in the hypodermis or
epithelial derived cells
Previously, the expression patterns of eight wrt genes (wrt1 to wrt-8) and eight grd genes (grd-1 to grd-3 and grd-5 to
grd-9) [11,14], and the single copy gene qua-1 have been
investigated [15]. Here, we used GFP fusions to examine
the expression patterns of the two remaining genes in the
wrt family, all 16 genes in the grd family, and 30 genes in
the grl gene family, and hog-1. Our newly generated ORF
predictions served to determine the proper start codon.
Most promoter::GFP fusions were generated using PCR
stitching with the putative intergenic regulatory region,
and generating one or two transgenic lines for each construct (see Methods). Such constructs might miss some
regulatory elements, for example those in introns, and
other limitations of the methodology have been pointed
out by McKay et al. [16]. However, in our case a distinct
advantage of the promoter-GFP constructs was that the
signal peptides for secretion were avoided and therefore
the expressing cells could be identified more easily. Three
predicted genes proved to be pseudogenes (grd-17p, grl30p and grl-32p) and were omitted in the present study
(Table 1). For two genes (grd-3 and grl-22) we failed to
obtain GFP reporter constructs. All in all, we obtained
GFP expression constructs for 47 hh-related genes that
were analyzed in 79 corresponding transgenic worm
strains [see Additional file 2]. Observation of these transgenic worms revealed that out of 47 genes, ten did not
show any detectable expression by the approach we used.
These genes were grd-1, grd-2, grd-4, grd-9, grd-11, grl-3, grl16, grl-20, grl-23 and grl-24 (Table 1). grd-1 has been
found to be expressed previously [11], and all ten genes
have corresponding EST and/or OST (open-reading-frame
sequence tag) clones, and/or have been detected in SAGE
analysis (Table 1), so it is likely that they are expressed in
vivo, but not detected by our approach.

Here, we summarize the expression patterns of the 37 hhrelated genes that showed expression. We find that these
genes are expressed in one or a few of the following tissues: the hypodermis (Fig. 3A, A'), seam cells (Fig. 3D,
D'), vulval epithelial cells (Fig. 3F), rectal epithelial cells
(Fig. 3G), arcade cells (Fig. 3H), excretory duct and pore
cells (Fig. 3C, C'), support cells of the sensilla (Fig. 3I and

Phylogenetic tree of C. elegans and C. briggsae Ground and Ground-like domains. Multiple sequence alignment of
Ground and Ground-like domains were generated using MAFFT [see Additional file 3]. For grd-1, grd-2 and grd-11 the four
Ground domains were extracted manually prior to alignment; the R1 to R4 postscripts indicate which repeat it is. Neighbor
joining was performed on the aligned sequences using the default parameters of Clustal_X. Results of 100 bootstrap trials are
shown. In addition to the C. elegans and C. briggsae sequences, some Brugia malayi (Bm) sequences from previous work were
also included [4].

different types of neurons (Fig. 3B, B', K and 3L).
The temporal expression of hh-related genes in the
hypodermis, seam cells and rectal epithelial cells
Out of the 37 hh-related genes showing expression, nine
genes (wrt-9, wrt-10, grd-14, grl-4, grl-5, grl-7, grl-15, grl-17
and grl-21) are expressed in the hypodermis (Fig. 3A, A'
and 4A), 12 genes (wrt-10, grd-5, grd-7, grd-10, grd-13, grd14, grd-16, grl-4, grl-7, grl-10, grl-15 and grl-27) in the seam
cells (Fig. 3D, D' and 4B), and 12 genes (wrt-10, grd-5, grd12, grd-13, grd-14, grl-4, grl-5, grl-8, grl-10, grl-17, grl-29
and hog-1) in the rectal epithelial cells (Fig. 3G and 4C).
By observing worms at different developmental stages we
determined the temporal expression and the relative
intensity of the GFP signal. In the hypodermis, there are
two hh-related genes (grl-5 and grl-15), which are mainly
expressed in the embryo, three genes (grd-14, grl-4 and grl21) only expressed in larval and adult stages, and four
genes (wrt-9, wrt-10, grl-7 and grl-17) expressed from
embryo stage through adulthood (Fig. 4A). The temporal
expression of hh-related genes in seam cells is more variable (Fig. 4B). Four genes (wrt-10, grd-10, grd-16 and grl10) start expression in the embryonic stage, but end at different postembryonic stages. Seven genes (wrt-10, grd-5,
grd-13, grd-14, grl-4, grl-7 and grl-27) start expression at
different stages, but all maintain expression throughout
adulthood. One gene (grl-15) is only expressed in larval
stages, and expression of another gene (grl-27) was found
to decrease in old adults. In rectal epithelial cells, grl-5 is
expressed only in the first larval stage (L1) and grd-5 only
in the fourth larval stage (L4) (Fig. 4C). All other genes

start their expression at L1 and maintain it through adulthood. The expression levels of three genes (wrt-10, grd-12
and grl-17) are higher than other genes in the rectal epithelial cells (Fig. 4C).
The spatial expression of hh-related genes in vulval
epithelial cells, pharyngeal muscle cells, arcade cells and
neuronal support cells
The expression of hh-related genes shows spatial differences, i.e. they are expressed in different organs and/or tissues. Within a single organ, e.g., the vulva, we observed
expression in different vulval cell types. Seven hh-related
genes are expressed in the vulval epithelial cells (a representative image is shown in Fig. 3F). There are three genes
(grl-4, grl-10 and grl-25) expressed in VulA, four (grd-5, grl4, grl-10 and grl-15) in VulB, two (grd-12 and grl-15) in
VulC, two (grd-5 and grl-15) in VulD, one (grl-15) in VulE,
and one (grl-31) in vulF (Table 2).

Four genes are expressed in the pharyngeal muscle or marginal cells (a representative image is shown in Fig. 3E, E').
One gene (grd-13) is expressed in the pro- and metacorpus
and isthmus, and three genes (grl-9, grl-11 and grl-17) in
the terminal bulb of the pharynx (Table 3). Six genes are
expressed in the arcade cells (a representative image is
shown in Fig. 3H). Three of these (wrt-10, grl-26 and grl27) are expressed in both anterior and posterior arcade
cells, and three (grd-5, grl-4 and grl-14) only in anterior
arcade cells (Table 4).
Twelve genes (grd-8, grd-16, grl-1, grl-2, grl-6, grl-8, grl-12,
grl-13, grl-17, grl-18, grl-28 and grl-29) are expressed in

cells whose bodies are located around the anterior bulb of
the pharynx and which have processes extending anteriorly (Fig. 3I and 3J). Most of the socket and sheath cell
bodies of the amphids, IL, OL, and the cephalic sensilla
are located around the metacorpus. We did not precisely
identify which support cells express each gene, but judged
by the position of the cell bodies and their processes, we
expect them to be support cells – in most cases socket cells
of IL, OL, cephalic and/or amphid sensilla (Table 5).
Expression of hh-related genes in other cell types
Four genes (wrt-10, grd-2, grd-6 and grl-19) are expressed
in the excretory duct and pore cells (Fig. 3C, C'). Some hhrelated genes have been found to be expressed in different
types of neurons. grd-8 is strongly expressed in OLLL and
OLLR neurons (Fig. 3K). grd-5 is expressed in a pharyngeal
neuron in the metacorpus extending a neurite anteriorly
and an axon posteriorly (Fig. 3B, B'). grl-6 is expressed in
the PVT cell (Fig. 3L). Some genes (e.g., grl-1) are
expressed in neurons of the lumbar ganglion, but the specific neurons were not identified (data not shown). We
also found that some genes (e.g., grd-16 and grl-19)
showed expression in the intestine, usually stronger in the
cells at the terminal regions (data not shown).
Cyclical changes of expression levels of some hh-related
genes
Because of the large syncytium of the hypodermis and
strong GFP signals, it was possible to observe the gene
expression levels of several genes dynamically using timelapse recording of single live transgenic GFP expressing
worms under a dissecting fluorescent microscope. Seven
out of nine hh-related genes expressed in the hypodermis,
show expression in larvae and adult stages. But only five

of these have strong enough GFP signals that allowed
time-lapse recordings. The expression level of the Pgrl4::GFP transgene is constant from larvae to adults (Fig.
5A). However, four hh-related genes display cyclical
changes in expression levels during larval development.
Using wrt-9 as an example, we observed that the expression level of Pwrt-9::GFP reached its peak around four
hours before each molt, lowered during molting and
reached the lowest level around five hours after molting.
This cycle repeated again in the next larval stage (Fig. 5B,
B' and data not shown). The expression of two other transgenes (Pgrd-14::GFP and Pgrl-7::GFP) showed similar patterns (data not shown). The expression level of wrt-10 also
displays cyclical changes, but the timing is shifted by
about two hours, i.e. the time for maximal and minimal
expression is two hours earlier than that of the other three
genes (Fig. 5C).
Localization of WRT-10, WRT-9 and GRL-4 revealed by
translational GFP fusions
The oscillatory expression levels of some hh-related genes
prompted us to test whether some of these proteins are
associated with the cuticle like QUA-1; we have previously
shown that QUA-1 is associated with the cuticle and that
QUA-1::GFP can be seen in the shed cuticle during molting [15]. We made translational GFP fusions to the fulllength coding sequences of wrt-10 and grl-4, and only the
signal peptide region of wrt-9, driven by their own promoter. The transgenic worms carrying Pwrt-10::wrt10::GFP did not show any GFP signal. The two transgenic
lines for wrt-9 and grl-4 exhibited GFP signal only in the
hypodermis (Fig. 6A, A' and 6C, C'). We observed the
molting process of live transgenic wrt-9 and grl-4 lines, but
were not able to detect WRT-9::GFP or GRL-4::GFP protein outside the hypodermis or associated with the
detached cuticle (Fig. 6B, B' and 6D, D'). Further, neither
of these GFP fusions seemed to be associated with any
obvious structure in the ECM. These fusion proteins might
be secreted to the body cavity like WRT-5 [14], where we
may have missed weak, diffuse GFP signals, or they might
be very soluble and not stay attached to the ECM.

gans genome encodes four genes with homology to
frizzled. Alignment of these frizzled homologous genes
with the frizzled gene sequences from other phyla showed
that none of the C. elegans frizzled genes can be identified
as being orthologous to smo (data not shown). Since two
out of four C. elegans frizzled genes had already been characterized [17,18], we determined the expression pattern of
the two remaining frizzled homologs, T23D8.1 and
F27E11.3A, which now have been named mom-5 and cfz2, respectively [19-21]. As shown in Fig. 7, T23D8.1 is
expressed in a few cells in the nerve ring, putatively identified as neurons (Fig. 7A, A'). In addition, there is also
expression in the intestine (Fig. 7B, B'), in one cell on the
ventral side of the terminal pharyngeal bulb (Fig. 7C, C')
and two cells around the anus (Fig. 7D, D'). F27E11.3A is
expressed in three cells around the nerve ring, possibly
neurons, in two cells in the posterior bulb of the pharynx,
and in the pharyngeal marginal or muscle cells (Fig. 7E,
E'). This observation is consistent with the report about
cfz-2 [21]. However, we failed to see the expression in
embryos, probably because of the low expression levels.
Hh requires heparan-sulfate modified proteoglycans for
efficient movement through the ECM from the producing
cells to the target cells. In C. elegans, gpn-1 encodes a
homolog of Drosophila Dally-like, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is orthologous to mammalian glypicans

found that it is exclusively expressed in the pharyngeal

stage to adults (Fig. 7F and 7G, G').

Discussion
hh-related gene expression data
In this study we have updated the list of hh-related genes
in C. elegans and also identified the corresponding
orthologs in C. briggsae. This revealed that there has been
gene amplification as well as pseudogene generation in C.
elegans. Analysis of the ORFs revealed that 30% of the hhrelated genes in C. elegans had prediction errors, mainly in
the N-terminus, although in C. elegans relatively good
gene predictions can be achieved, because of the small
genome size, mostly small introns, and well-conserved
splice sites. We noticed that in 10 ORFs with errors, no
corresponding OSTs are available, and the errors in prediction may be directly responsible for the failure to
obtain OSTs. This highlights the need for better knowledge of domain and gene structure, which can be combined with experimental methods, to refine and improve
ORF predictions. This is of particular importance for other
organisms that have much larger genes and introns, such
as mammals. Many of our predictions have now been validated by new ESTs, indicating that careful bioinformatics
analysis which takes into account multiple independent
features (cross-species conservation, signal peptide,
sequence motifs, consistent gene structure within a gene
family), can indeed lead to improved predictions.

Our high-throughput reporter::GFP analysis is subject to
the standard caveats that apply to transcriptional GFP
reporter constructs in general [16]. In particular, the intergenic fragment containing the putative promoter may not
contain all regulatory elements; for example, some may
reside in introns. Further, GFP reporters are usually not
expressed in the germ line. Generating primarily methionine fusions as we did has an important advantage:
because there is no signal peptide for secretion, the GFP
will remain in the cell where it is produced, and cells can
be identified. Secreted GFP may be difficult to visualize
and may diffuse to other cells, for example the coelomocytes, as we observed in the case of wrt-5 [14].

Time-lapse recordings of the expression level of hh-related genes. (A) One transgenic larva carrying Pgrl-4::GFP was
recorded starting from late L2 to late L3. There is no apparent change in the expression level before and after molt. (B, B')
One transgenic larva carrying Pwrt-9::GFP was recorded starting from middle L1 to late L2. The GFP signal is high 3–4 hr
before the L1 molt and then goes down and reaches a valley 3–4 hr after the L1 molt and then increases again. A graph representing the intensity change was generated from the raw image data as described in Methods. (C) One transgenic larva carrying
Pwrt-10::GFP is recorded starting from mid-L2 to mid-L3. The GFP signal is high 5–6 hr before the L2 molt. It decreases and
reaches its lowest level around 2 hr after the L2 molt and then increases again. In all the three panels, the time interval
between images is 1 hr.

Keeping in mind these caveats, this study, together with
our previous work [11,14,15], provides a comprehensive
analysis of the expression patterns of the hh-related genes.
Out of the 61 ORFs, three pseudogenes and grd-3 and grl22 were not included. For a further ten, no expression was
observed. We have compiled EST, OST and SAGE data for
all the hh-related ORFs to obtain independent verification
about gene expression, in particular for those cases where
we saw no GFP (Table 1), and the results are summarized
in a Venn diagram (Fig. 8).
Of the 58 presumed functional ORFs, 42 ORFs are supported by at least three independent methods. 21 (36%)
genes have no corresponding EST, and for 11 genes no
lacZ or GFP expression was observed in this and previous
studies. However, for four genes that have neither EST nor

OST support we obtained GFP expression data, and one of
these, grl-29, has no SAGE support either.
Four genes, for which we failed to observe GFP expression,
are represented in the EST set, indicating that the transcripts are not rare. Particularly noteworthy are grl-16 and
grl-20, since they both have many EST clones. The first
exon of grl-20 is small and the first intron is over 1 kb in
length. Therefore, essential regulatory elements could
reside in this intron. A few reporter constructs, such as for
grd-1 and grd-4, may fail to express, because they may be
in an operon with upstream genes, and the intergenic fragments would not suffice. Reporter constructs and ESTs are
perhaps the most reliable indicator of gene expression.
The combined data show that only for seven genes out of
58 neither GFP/lacZ nor EST data is available. Five genes

Expression of the frizzled homolog T23D8.1 monitored using GFP. PT23D8.1::GFP is expressed in a few cells of the nerve ring (A,
A'). Further, it is expressed in the intestine (B, B'), one cell on the ventral side of the terminal bulb of the pharynx (arrow in C,
C') and two cells around the anus (D, D'). (E, E') PF27E11.3A::GFP is expressed in three cells around the nerve ring, two cells in
the terminal bulb of the pharynx, and also weakly in the pharynx. (F) Pgpn-1::GFP is expressed in the pharyngeal primordium in
embryos (F, merger of the DIC and fluorescent images). (G, G') Pgpn-1::GFP is also expressed in the pharynx in larvae and
adults, L1 stage shown. A'-E' and G' are DIC images corresponding to the fluorescent images in A-E and G, respectively.

green circle, EST data in the red circle, OST data in the blue circle, and SAGE data in the black outline.

(wrt-7, grd-4, grd-11, grl-22, grl-23) are found both in OSTs
and SAGE, suggesting that they are expressed, but possibly
at low levels. grd-9 and grl-3 are only supported by SAGE
data, grd-9 with multiple hits in multiple samples, but grl3 with only a few hits. Two of the pseudogenes, grd-17p
and grl-30p, are indicated to be transcribed, one by SAGE,
and one through OSTs. Since these are recently duplicated
genes, some promoter activity may still be remaining. In

fact all duplicated grl genes in the cluster (grl-27 to grl-31)
are expressed, but their expression patterns have diverged.
Our comprehensive analysis of all the expression patterns
shows that the vast majority of these genes are expressed
in the hypodermis or in cells with epithelial properties.
Noticeably, these cells are located on the outer surface of
the worm body or line the openings of the animal. Many
of these cells are involved in secreting cuticle components

that line their surface, which is in direct contact with the
environment. Understanding the function of these genes
may not be trivial, since the overlapping of expression patterns suggests that there may be functional redundancy.
The products of the hh-related genes might be
components of or function in the ECM
During C. elegans embryonic development, the embryo
elongates from an oval cell bundle to a four-fold vermiform shape. To maintain the shape the hypodermis
secretes the cuticle that forms the worm's exoskeleton.
During post-embryonic development, C. elegans renews
its cuticle four times – one at each molt. The cuticle is
composed of major structural components, i.e. cuticlins
and collagens. All the cuticular components are secreted
by the underlying hypodermal cells. Along the two lateral
sides of the worm there are two special protruding structures, called alae, some components of which are secreted
by the underlying seam cells. Fourteen hh-related genes
are expressed in the hypodermis and 14 genes in the seam
cells ([11] and Fig. 3 and 4). Since all of the hh-related
genes have a predicted signal peptide for secretion, except
hog-1, it is likely that their gene products are secreted. In
addition, all of these proteins have multiple conserved
cysteine residues that can often be found in secreted molecules and are expected to form disulfide bonds. Indeed,
we have discovered that one of the hh-related genes, qua1, is expressed in the hypodermis, and QUA-1 is secreted
and associated with the cuticle [15]. Another example is
WRT-5, which is expressed in seam cells during embryogenesis and is also secreted. However, in this case the protein was not localized to the cell surface, but diffused
inside the embryonic egg shell and in larvae it was
secreted into the pharyngeal lumen [14]. Despite the lack
of localization of WRT-5 protein to the ECM, wrt-5
mutants display aberrant cell junctions, indicating that
WRT-5 functions in the ECM [14].

The cycling expression pattern of some hh-related genes
implies that their proteins play roles during larval development, particularly molting. Not only the main body,
but also all the major openings of C. elegans, including the
buccal cavity, pharyngeal lumen, vulva, rectum, excretory
duct and pore, and openings of sensory organs are lined
by cuticles. These cuticles are secreted by the underlying
cells that are generally of epithelial nature. Anterior to the
buccal cavity, the lip cuticle is secreted by three specialized
rings of hypodermal cells hyp1–3. The buccal cuticle is
secreted by the pharyngeal epithelium, and the arcade
cells secrete the bridging cuticle that connects the lip and
the buccal cuticles. The cuticle lining the pharynx is
secreted by the pharyngeal muscle or marginal cells. Our
discovery that there are six hh-related genes expressed in
arcade cells (Fig. 3H and Table 4), four in pharyngeal
muscle and marginal cells (Fig. 3E and Table 3) suggests

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/280

that these gene products might also be secreted to the
pharynx cuticle or lumen as is WRT-5 [14].
The cuticles at the openings of the vulva, rectum and
excretory duct and pore are secreted by the underlying vulval epithelial cells, rectal epithelial cells and excretory duct
and pore cells. Our results show that there are eight hhrelated genes expressed in vulval epithelial cells, 11 in rectal epithelial cells and three in the excretory duct and pore
cells. The products of these genes are also secreted and
may be associated with the cuticle as well.
C. elegans has two major sensory organs, two amphids in
the head and two phasmids in the tail. In addition, there
are six IL, six OL and four cephalic sensory organs in the
head. All these sensory organs open to the environment so
that the sensory neurons can detect stimuli. The openings
of these sensory organs are also lined with cuticles that are
secreted by socket and sheath support cells. Eleven hhrelated genes are expressed in support cells suggesting that
these genes products might also be components of the
cuticle lining the openings of these sensory organs.
In summary, most of the hh-related genes are expressed in
one or a few cell types that secrete cuticle. Conversely, all
cells that secrete cuticle express at least some hh-related
genes (Fig. 3 and 4, Table 2, 3, 4, 5). The Hh-related proteins have signal peptides and are therefore predicted to
be secreted [11]. For two genes, WRT-5 and QUA-1, this
has been confirmed [14,15]. Therefore, we propose that
all other Hh-related proteins are secreted to the ECM, in
particular the cuticular ECM, although some proteins, perhaps those that lack a Hog domain, can diffuse relatively
freely and may not be retained within the ECM.
Possible functions of hh-related genes
The hh-related genes encode distinct N-terminal conserved domains besides the Hog domain, and these
domains only exist in nematodes so far. The structure of
these domains has not been resolved and their molecular
function is still unknown. However, the presumed location of the Hh-related proteins in the cuticle or the body
cavity provides a chance to surmise possible functions.
Considering the structure and function of the cuticle, one
possibility is that the Hh-related proteins function as
structural components similar to collagens. The major
protein components of the C. elegans cuticle are small collagen-like polypeptides that are encoded by a multi-gene
family with 175 members [22]. They form the basal, fiber,
medial strut and internal cortical layers of the C. elegans
cuticle, accounting for approximately 80% of the cuticle.
Lipids, glycoproteins and insoluble proteins are also
major components of the cuticle [23]. Disruption of collagens or the enzymes required for their biosynthesis
leads to changes in the body morphology, such as Blister

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:280

(Bli), Roller (Rol), Squat (Sqt), Dumpy (Dpy) and Long
(Lon) phenotypes [22,24-27]. RNAi knocking-down of
hh-related gene expression did not reveal strong phenotypes, although some disruptions of alae [9,14,15] and
some low penetrance Rol were observed [14]. The RNAi
defects in alae are often found in those hh-related genes
expressed in the hypodermis or seam cells [9]. The most
severe phenotype is molting defective (Mlt) [9,14,15].
However, the molting phenotype did not always correlate
with our expression data, but some of our GFP reporters
may not express in all tissues. Some of the RNAi Mlt phenotypes might also be the indirect consequence of partial
gene inactivation, for example, in wrt-5 deletion mutants
we observed primarily embryonic lethality but rarely Mlt
[14]. In the case of the grl genes the large-scale RNAi
screens resulted in mostly wt phenotypes.
Altogether, the functional data suggest that hh-related
genes might not act as structural components in the cuticle or in the biosynthesis of collagens. However, there are
three proteases, nas-36, nas-37 and cpl-1, located in the
cuticle and involved in the process of molting [28-30].
These proteases are enriched in conserved cysteine residues. Their expression shows oscillation and their mutant
phenotypes are Mlt [28-30]. The hh-related genes products
also have conserved domains containing multiple
cysteines, a few show cycling expression, and many have
Mlt phenotypes when mutated or knocked-down by RNAi
(Fig. 5 and [9,11,15]). Therefore, it is possible that the
Hh-related proteins function in the same pathway as the
proteases.
Another possibility is that the Hh-related proteins function as signaling molecules like Hh. Smo is a necessary
component for transduction of the Hh signal. The expression analysis (Fig. 5) and the functional analysis [19-21]
of the two frizzled genes T23D8.1 and F27E11.3A reveal
that they are unlikely substitutes for Smo. Because of the
lack of other pathway components between Patched and
Ci, there is little doubt that there is no bona fide Hh signaling pathway in C. elegans [4]. However, this does not
exclude the possibility that a portion of the pathway or
some specific mechanism is conserved. Some of the Hhrelated proteins might interact with Ptc or Ptr, since particularly the latter gene family is expanded extensively. At
least some of them are involved in the same developmental processes such as molting, as shown by RNAi experiments [9]. In addition, one of the Dispatched orthologs,
che-14, has been found to have an expression profile similar to that of some hh-related genes [5].
The expression data we present here suggest that many of
the hh-related genes function in the ECM of cells in contact with the outer environment of the worm, particularly
the cuticle. However, we do note that some expression is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/280

seen also in other tissues, for example neurons. Further,
wrt-5, while it is expressed in seam cells, exerts its function
already in the embryonic seam cells and mutations in wrt5 lead to arrested embryonic development; this is before
the cuticle is synthesized. Therefore, some of the Hhrelated proteins may also be involved in other functions,
perhaps to ensure the proper extracellular environment
for neurite outgrowth and function, or membrane structure and fusion.

Conclusion
We have compiled the definitive list of hh-related genes in
C. elegans and C. briggsae and refined their ORF predictions. Further, we made a comprehensive survey of expression patterns for the hh-related genes and found that all of
these genes are expressed in one or a few of the following
cell types: hypodermis, seam cells, excretory duct and pore
cells, vulval epithelial cells, rectal epithelial cells, arcade
cells, pharyngeal muscle or marginal cells, support cells of
sensory organs and neuronal cells. Almost all of these cells
secret cuticle components. The expression levels of some
hh-related genes can cycle in phase with the molting cycle.
We propose that a number of these proteins might be
components of the ECM and that they contribute to the
proper function of the ECM.

Methods
Bioinformatics
Tblastn and blastp [31] searches of C. elegans and C.
briggsae were performed at the Sanger Center ([32,33]. The
genomic C. briggsae sequence data were produced by the
Sanger Institute and the Genome Sequencing Center at
Washington University Medical School [34]. As queries
the previously known members of the wrt, qua, grd and grl
families were used [11]. In addition, PSI-blast searches
were performed at NCBI [35] in an attempt to identify
additional divergent ORFs. ORFs and associated relevant
information were retrieved and stored in a local database
(Filemaker Pro 6, Filemaker, Inc.). Multiple sequence
alignment for the different gene families was performed at
the protein sequence level using ClustalX [36] and MAFFT
[37,38]. Problematic regions in ORFs were identified by
breaks and truncations in conserved motifs, or divergences in ORF structure between C. elegans and C. briggsae
and between paralogs within gene families. In grd and grl
genes the conserved domain usually lies at the C-terminus, and upstream there can be a region of variable length
with repetitive amino acids (see overview in [4]). A major
guide in correct identification of the N-terminus was the
presence of a signal peptide for secretion. Analysis of signal sequences for protein secretion were performed at the
SignalP web server [39]. If prediction errors were suspected, the genomic sequences of putative C. elegans and
C. briggsae orthologs, or even closely related paralogs
within C. elegans were compared using the dotmatrix pro-

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:280

gram PPCMatrix [40]. PPCMatrix also allows comparison
of a protein sequence against a genomic sequence translated in three-frames to identify conserved exons that
might have been missed in automatic ORF predictions.
ORFs were subsequently corrected manually. The correctness of the N-terminal exon predictions was corroborated
using the SignalP server on the N-terminal sequences for
each ORF. Putative cleavage sites for the signal peptide are
given [see Additional file 1]. For multiple sequence alignment of the Ground and Ground-like domains MAFFT
was used [see Additional file 3]; in case of GRD-1, GRD-2,
and GRD-11 the four domains were extracted by hand
and added to the alignment labeled with R1 to R4. Phylogenetic analysis of the alignment was done using Neighbor joining as implemented in ClustalX [36]. Bootstrap
values for 100 trials are shown.
Worm culture, microscopy and image processing
All the worms were cultured at 20°C as described [41].
Microscopy and image handling were performed as
described [15]. For each strain, the embryos and all stages
of larvae and adults were mounted on 2% agarose and
paralyzed by NaN3 for observation. Live GFP time-lapse:
for each worm strain eight transgenic larval worms were
singled on NGM plates with food. The worms were
observed at 1 hr intervals [15]. Each recording lasted for at
least 13 hrs to observe at least two molts. To produce the
intensity graph we calculated the average pixel intensity
(using the histogram function in Adobe® Photoshop® on
the raw image data) over the area of the worm (selected by
magic wand and lasso), and subtracted the average pixel
intensity of a background rectangle adjacent to the worm.
This was done for each image frame to yield the points
plotted in the graph.
Generation of constructs and transgenic worms
The constructs of the putative promoter regions fused
with GFP were made by two methods. One was to amplify
the promoter-containing region of a gene by PCR using
genomic DNA as template and cloning it into the promoter-less vector pPD95.67. This method was applied to
wrt-9, wrt-10 and the two frizzled homologs. For each construct, two or three transgenic worm lines were generated.
The translational GFP fusions of three genes wrt-9, wrt-10
and grl-4 were also made in a similar way. Both the promoter and the coding sequence without stop codon were
amplified by PCR and inserted into pPD95.67. All these
constructs were injected into N2 worms together with the
marker rol-6 (pRF4).

For the high-throughput transcriptional fusions, the following, second method was used. Upstream promoter
containing regions were amplified by PCR followed by
fusion PCRs to a GFP-encoding cassette derived from
pPD95.67 [16,42]. These PCR products (10 ng/µl) in TE

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/280

buffer were co-injected into dpy-5(e907) with pCeh361
(carrying wild-type dpy-5 for rescuing the Dpy phenotype)
as a marker. The putative promoter-containing region was
chosen to be the 3 kb region upstream from the start ATG.
If it was shorter than 3 kb, because of another upstream
gene, then the entire intergenic sequence was taken. For
each PCR construct we generated at least one and in many
instances two transgenic lines. In some cases, when no
GFP signal was observed, either a new construct or a new
transgenic line was generated to attempt to get a GFP
expressing line. A list of the primers used to PCR the
upstream promoter-containing regions and of the respective sizes of the regions is given in a separate table [see
Additional file 2].
