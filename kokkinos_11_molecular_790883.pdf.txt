Abstract
Background: Urban sewage virological analysis may produce important information about the strains that cause
clinical and subclinical infections in the population, thus supporting epidemiological studies.
Methods: In the present study, a twenty one-month survey (November 2007 to July 2009) was conducted in order
to evaluate the presence of human adenoviruses (hAdV), hepatitis A viruses (HAV), hepatitis E viruses (HEV),
Noroviruses (NoV), and human Polyomaviruses (hPyV) in untreated sewage samples collected from the inlet of
Patras’ municipal biological wastewater treatment plant, located in southwestern Greece. Nucleic acid amplification
techniques were applied for viral nucleic acid detection. Positive samples were confirmed by sequencing and
comparative phylogenetic analysis was performed on the isolated viral strains.
Results: In total, viruses were detected in 87.5% (42/48) of sewage samples. AdVs, PyVs, HAV, and NoVs were
detected in 45.8% (22/48), 68.8% (33/48), 8.3% (4/48), and 6.3% (3/48) of the samples collected from the plant’s
inlet, while HEV was not detected at all. Adenovirus types 8 (Ad8), 40 (Ad40) and 41 (Ad41) were recognized, while
JC and BK polyomaviruses were recorded. Noroviruses were identified as GII.4. HAV was typed as genotype IA.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the advantages of environmental surveillance as a tool to elucidate the
molecular epidemiology of community circulating viruses. We underline the need of environmental surveillance
programs in countries such as Greece with inadequate and problematic epidemiological surveillance system and
no environmental surveillance system currently in action.

Background
Wastewater presents a timely dynamic collection point
where many physical, chemical, and biological substances of our society are brought to a central location.
Any type of infection within a community is likely to
lead to pathogen excretion in bodily fluids/substances
and therefore, transported into the community sewage
system. A wide variety of pathogenic organisms pass
through municipal wastewater treatment systems,
including viruses [1].
The enteric viruses found in human stool and urine
belong to more than 140 types of which adenovirus
(AdV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), norovirus (NoV) genotype I and II, rotavirus (RV), enterovirus (EV), and polyomavirus (PyV) are those most often detected in the
environment [2-7]. HAdVs are associated with sporadic

cases and occasional outbreaks of gastroenteritis [7].
Hepatitis A represents worldwide around 50% of the
total hepatitis cases and hepatitis A virus has been
linked to several waterborne outbreaks. Hepatitis E is
less frequent than hepatitis A, and in industrialised
countries is thought to be spread zoonotically, principally from swine [8]. NoVs are an important cause of
epidemic acute gastroenteritis, and waterborne outbreaks of NoV associated gastroenteritis are well documented [9]. The human polyomaviruses have been
shown to be present in high concentrations in the sewage, and their specificity as human viruses may be useful
as a marker for faecal pollution of anthropogenic origin
[10].
Bibliography has been enriched the last few years by
several studies which have demonstrated the advantage
of environmental surveillance as an additional tool to
determine the epidemiology of different viruses circulating in a given community [8,11-16]. The availability of
improved detection techniques, combined with an

increased awareness of gastroenteritis-causing viral
pathogens, has also led to the establishment of surveillance systems in various countries, since other enteric
viruses responsible for gastroenteritis and hepatitis have
replaced enteroviruses as the main target for detection
[8,17]. Environmental surveillance can provide valuable
supplementary information, particularly in urban populations with absent or questionable surveillance, when
persistent virus circulation is suspected or frequent virus
re-introduction is perceived [18]. In Greece, there is no
specific national surveillance system for gastroenteric
viruses, and this explains the limited available data on
enteropathogenic viruses.
In the present study, a twenty one-month survey
(November 2007-July 2009) was conducted in order to
evaluate the presence of human adenoviruses (hAdV),
hepatitis A viruses (HAV), hepatitis E viruses (HEV),
Noroviruses (NoV), and human Polyomaviruses (hPyV)
in sewage samples collected from the inlet of a municipal biological wastewater treatment plant, located in
southwestern Greece. The study aimed to enrich the
poor data on environmental virological studies in
Greece, to demonstrate the benefit of environmental
surveillance as a tool, to determine the epidemiology of
viruses circulating in a given community, and to underline the need for the design and support of similar longterm studies in our country.

Methods
Wastewater treatment plant and sampling

The municipal wastewater treatment plant of the present study receives urban sewage from the city of Patras.
The municipality has 171.616 inhabitants (census of
2001) and is located in south western Greece. The plant
is officially registered as a secondary treatment plant
with anaerobic digestion of the sludge. It treats 38.000
m3 of urban sewage per day. The wastewater effluents
are discharged into the Patraikos Gulf. From November
2007 to July 2009, forty eight (48) samples of untreated
sewage were collected from the municipal sewage treatment plant. Samples were collected early in the morning, the first day of each sampling week. The samples
were transferred to the laboratory into a cool box and
they were immediately subjected to virological analysis
for the detection of human AdVs, NoVs, HEV, HAV,
and hPyVs.
Sample concentration, viral extraction and biomolecular
analysis

Sewage samples were processed as described elsewhere
[7,19,20]. Viral nucleic acids were extracted from concentrated samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

Page 2 of 7

(RT-PCR) and nested PCR techniques have been used
for the detection of human AdVs, HAV, HEV, NoVs,
human PyVs, according to previously published protocols [19-21].
Sequence analysis

Positive PCR products were purified using the QIAquick
PCR purification kit (Qiagen, USA) and confirmed by
sequencing (Sequencing unit, School of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Greece). The obtained nucleotide
sequences were analyzed by BLAST program at the NIH
website (NCBI, National Centre for Technology Control,
NIH, USA), and were compared with each other and
with other published sequences. Multiple alignments
were performed with the Clustal X program. The neighbour-joining method has been applied for the phylogenetic tree analysis, the reliability of which was assessed
by bootstrap resampling (1,000 pseudoreplicates), using
MEGA 4.0.2 program.

Results
Virus Detection and Phylogenetic Analysis

In total, viruses were detected in 87.5% (42/48) of
sewage samples. AdVs, PyVs, HAV, and NoVs were
detected in 45.8% (22/48), 68.8% (33/48), 8.3% (4/48),
and 6.3% (3/48) of the samples collected from the
plant’s inlet, while HEV was not detected at any sample.
The phylogenetic analyses performed are summarized
in Figures 1,2,3,4,5. Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic tree
which was constructed to represent phylogenetic relationships among hAdV strains. Adenovirus types 8
(Ad8), 40 (Ad40) and 41 (Ad41) were recognized. Ten
out of eleven hAdV strains isolated during the present
study from Patras’ sewage samples (abbreviated as PAT)
cluster with reference strains types 40 and 41, while
strain PAT76 clusters with the reference strain type 8
(AB448768). Simian AdV type 22 (AY530876) was used
as an out-group for the analysis and forms a distinct
clade to all human strains, as expected.
Figure 2 shows the NJ phylogenetic tree of the three
Norovirus strains isolated during the present study
along with seven NoV reference strains. Patras’ NoV
strains cluster with six clinical and one environmental
NoV strain, all of genotype GII.4. The environmental
reference NoV strain included to the analysis derived
from Tunisia and was isolated from treated sewage.
Norovirus strain (EU794874) of genotype GI forms a
distinct clade to all other GII.4 strains of the study.
The phylogenetic relationships among four HAV
strains isolated from Patras’ sewage treatment plant and
thirteen reference strains are presented in Figure 3. All
Patras’ HAV strains cluster with HAV reference strains
of genotype IA. Simian HAV strain (D00924 genotype
V) was used as an out-group for the analysis and forms

eighteen hAdV strains. Eleven strains (abbreviated as PAT73, PAT105, PAT274, PAT1413, PAT87, PAT86, PAT316, PAT486, PAT209, PAT689, PAT76)
were isolated from Patras’ sewage samples. Seven reference strains the sequences of which were retrieved from GenBank database were
included to the analysis. Reference strains belong to hAdV genotype 8, 40, and 41. Simian AdV 22 strain [GenBank: AY530876] was used as an
out-group. The bootstrap confidence levels were obtained for 1,000 replicates.

strains, as expected.
Regarding the hPyVs, JC and BK polyomaviruses were
recorded (Figures 4 &5). Phylogenetic trees depicting
the relationship between the environmental BK and JC
PyV strains of the present study compared with publicly
available environmental BK and JC sequences are shown
in figures 4 and 5, respectively. BK reference isolates

were isolated from raw sewage and environmental water
contaminated with sewage. The five Patras’ JC PyV
strains form a cluster with reference strains DHR4a, and
LS1.

Discussion
Monitoring of human pathogens in sewage is possible
because they may be excreted in a range of bodily fluids,

skin, and hair during active infection. The analysis of
centralized wastewater allows detection of intentional,
natural, or accidental contamination events. A person
with an enteric viral infection may excrete as many as
10 14 viral particles per day and over 1015 during the
course of an infection [1]. During the last years, more
attention has been focused on the sewage virological
quality, the risk of virus-associated waterborne illness,
the need for routine monitoring viral contamination and
the environmental surveillance through the analysis of
sewage [3,22,23].
To enrich the poor existing virological data, a twenty
one-month survey (November 2007-July 2009) was conducted to examine the HAV, hAdVs, HEV, NoVs, and
hPyVs presence in sewage samples collected from a biological wastewater treatment plant, located at the city of
Patras.
Limited data on enteropathogenic viruses are available
in Greece, because there is no specific surveillance system
for viral gastroenteritis. The role of enteric viruses as a
cause of gastroenteritis in Northwestern Greece was
investigated by a 6-year study of stool samples from children hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. Rotaviruses,
noroviruses, adenoviruses and astroviruses were detected
in 21.35%, 4%, 3.5% and 2.35%, respectively. Although
enteric adenovirus types 40 and 41 predominated, nonenteric subgenera (A and C) were also causally implicated
[24]. In the present study, the analysis of sewage samples
mainly revealed adenoviruses types 40, and 41 and in one

case a strain type 8 was identified (Figure 1). All NoV
strains were typified as NoV GII.4 (Figure 2). GII.4 is the
predominant genotype worldwide [25].
Hepatitis A virus appears in the stool of infected individuals 2-3 weeks before clinical illness [1]. According
to the latest national cross-sectional seroprevalence survey of hepatitis A among Greek children, hepatitis A is
intermediate endemic in Greece, and the National Advisory Committee for Immunization has included the
hepatitis A vaccine in the GNIP from January 2008 [26].
In the present study, HAV was detected in four sewage
samples and typified as genotype IA (Figure 3). In a previous study, one of five sewage samples from Patras
tested positive for HAV [27]. Moreover, in one of our
recent studies to characterize hepatitis A virus isolates
from environmental and clinical samples in Greece, a
100% prevalence of subgenotype IA was recorded [28].
HEV is considered an emerging pathogen in industrialized countries. In the last years, some HEV strains associated with sporadic acute hepatitis have been isolated
from human serum samples in European countries (i.e.,
Italy, Greece, Spain, and the United Kingdom) [27]. In a
study to investigate the level of infection in regions
where HEV is considered nonendemic by analyzing the
excreted virus in the urban sewage of diverse geographic
areas, HEV RNA was not detected in any of the four
samples from Patras, Greece [27]. A molecular HEV
screening performed on raw sewage samples from different wastewater treatment plants yielded positives at 16%,

Kokkinos et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:195

evenly distributed throughout Italy [29]. A study aimed
to determine the prevalence of anti-HEV among haemodialysis patients of a semi-rural region in central Greece
showed that the prevalence of anti-HEV was greater
than in healthy blood donors [30]. In the present study,
none of the analyzed sewage samples was found positive
for HEV.
JCV and BKV Polyomaviruses are excreted in the
urine and are spread in high concentrations in sewage.
In addition to the potential use of polyomaviruses as a
useful marker for pollution of anthropogenic origin,
being able to detect and study these viruses in sewage
provides an opportunity to evaluate and monitor those
strains that are prevalent in specific geographical areas
[10]. Polyomavirus BK infection in Greek renal transplant recipients has been reported by Zavos [31]. To
test the involvement of BK virus (BKV), and JC virus
(JCV), in prostate tumorigenesis, the prevalence of these
viruses was tested in a series of human prostatic malignancies. The overall prevalence of polyomaviruses was
19% in the prostate cancer cases, and sequencing analysis revealed the presence of BKV in all samples [32]. In
another study, to detect JC virus in a series of colon
neoplasms from Greek patients, JCV sequence was
detected in 61% of colon adenocarcinomas and in 60%
of adenomas, at a viral load of 9 × 103 up to 20 × 103
copies/μg DNA [33]. The detection of JC virus DNA
sequences and the expression of the viral regulatory protein T-antigen in tumors of the central nervous system
from patients from Greece, USA and UK were described
by Del Valle [34]. The characteristics of JCV excreted in
the environment have been studied by analyzing sewage
samples from divergent geographical areas. The phylogenetic analysis of JCV strains detected in the sewage of
Barcelona (Spain), Umeå (Sweden), Nancy (France), Pretoria (South Africa), Patras (Greece), Cairo (Egypt),
Washington, D.C. (USA), and diverse areas of Northern
India showed their relationships with JCV strains previously described in urine or clinical samples in these
geographic areas [35]. In our study, PyVs (JC and BK)
have been detected in 68.8% of the analyzed samples.
Phylogenetic trees depicting the relationship between
the environmental BK and JC PyV strains of the present
study compared with publicly available environmental
(sewage or water contaminated by sewage) BK and JC
sequences are presented in figures 4 and 5, respectively.
Sewage surveillance system has been shown to be
more sensitive than reporting of clinical cases of serious
illness in a community [1]. Data from the occurrence of
viruses in raw sewage may provide an overview of the
epidemiology of virus infections circulating in the community, and at the same time, reveal the occurrence of
asymptomatic infections [8,27].

Our study enriches the poor available data on sewage
virological quality, and demonstrates the advantages of
environmental surveillance as a tool to elucidate the
molecular epidemiology of community circulating
viruses. We underline the need of environmental surveillance programs in countries such us Greece with
limited epidemiological surveillance systems for viral
gastroenteritis and no environmental surveillance system
currently in action and we propose that similar longterm studies might be useful and offer a valuable and
complementary tool to epidemiological surveillance
systems.
