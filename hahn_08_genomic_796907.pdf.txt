Abstract
Background: The jumonji C (JmjC) domain containing gene 6 (Jmjd6, previously known as
phosphatidylserine receptor) has misleadingly been annotated to encode a transmembrane
receptor for the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Given the importance of JmjC domain containing
proteins in controlling a wide range of diverse biological functions, we undertook a comparative
genomic analysis to gain further insights in Jmjd6 gene organisation, evolution, and protein function.
Results: We describe here a semiautomated computational pipeline to identify and annotate JmjC
domain containing proteins. Using a sequence segment N-terminal of the Jmjd6 JmjC domain as
query for a reciprocal BLAST search, we identified homologous sequences in 62 species across all
major phyla. Retrieved Jmjd6 sequences were used to phylogenetically analyse corresponding loci
and their genomic neighbourhood. This analysis let to the identification and characterisation of a
bi-directional transcriptional unit compromising the Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik genes and to the
recognition of a new, before overseen Jmjd6 exon in mammals. Using expression studies, two novel
Jmjd6 splice variants were identified and validated in vivo. Analysis of the Jmjd6 neighbouring gene
1110005A03Rik revealed an incident deletion of this gene in two out of three earlier reported Jmjd6
knockout mice, which might affect previously described conflicting phenotypes. To determine
potentially important residues for Jmjd6 function a structural model of the Jmjd6 protein was
calculated based on sequence conservation. This approach identified a conserved double-stranded
β-helix (DSBH) fold and a HxDxnH facial triad as structural motifs. Moreover, our systematic
annotation in nine species identified 313 DSBH fold-containing proteins that split into 25 highly
conserved subgroups.
Conclusion: We give further evidence that Jmjd6 most likely has a function as a nonheme-Fe(II)2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase as previously suggested. Further, we provide novel insights
into the evolution of Jmjd6 and other related members of the superfamily of JmjC domain
containing proteins. Finally, we discuss possibilities of the involvement of Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik
in an antagonistic biochemical pathway.

Background
The jumonji C (JmjC)-domain containing proteins are an
extending family of redox enzymes that catalyse a wide
range of oxidation reactions. These proteins are found in
all living organisms and are characterised by sharing the
highly conserved JmjC domain. This domain was first
described by Takeuchi and colleagues, who isolated a gene
in the mouse which they called jumonji (meaning cruciform in Japanese), in regard to an abnormal phenotype
visible in mutant embryos during neural plate development [1]. Since then, the JmjC domain has found its entry
into public domain databases and many other proteins
containing this domain have been annotated or identified
subsequently [2-5]. Currently, more then 11,000
sequence entries of JmjC domain containing proteins are
present in Uniprot, PFAM, Interpro and SMART, thus
demonstrating the tremendous expansion of members in
this protein superfamily. Structural studies showed that
the JmjC domain has a very characteristic topology. It
forms a double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold, also known
as jelly-roll motif, that normally consists of eight antiparallel β-strands [6]. This DSBH topology is characteristic for
the cupin metalloenzymes [7] and for the JmjC domain
containing proteins [3]. Cupin metalloenzymes constitute
a large and diverse superfamily of proteins with enzymatically active and non-active members. They contain at
least one DSBH or jelly-roll motive. Secondary structure
elements that surround the DSBH are used further to
define different subfamilies (for review see [6]). The
DSBH fold in JmjC domain containing proteins can form
an enzymatically active pocket by coordinating di-iron
(Fe(II)) and the co-substrate 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). In
almost all cases, the two-electron oxidation of the "prime"
substrate is coupled to the conversion of 2OG into succinate and CO2 [8]. Therefore, this class of enzymes is also
known as nonheme-Fe(II)-2-oxoglutarate-dependent
dioxygenases.
Oxidative reactions catalysed by 2OG-dependent dioxygenase are critical steps in the biosynthesis of metabolites, or
post translational modification of interacting target proteins involving hydroxylation or demethylation and
DNA/RNA repair of N-methylated nucleic acids [6,9]. As
such, 2OG-dependent dioxygenases are of immanent biological importance. A number of JmjC domain containing
proteins are involved in regulating key developmental
processes during mammalian embryogenesis by acting as
transcription factors. An example of this subgroup of JmjC
domain containing proteins is jumonji itself (now called
Jarid2), which can act as a transcriptional repressor. Jarid2
inhibits cyclin D1 transcription during heart and brain
development and thereby controls cellular proliferation
and differentiation in these organs during morphogenesis
[10-12]. Other examples of JmjC-domain proteins that
function as transcriptional repressors are the retinoblast-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

oma-binding protein 2 (Jarid1a, also known as RBP2),
which is required for the differentiation of various cell
types including muscle, bone and myeloid cells [13] and
hairless, a nuclear co-repressor of multiple nuclear hormone receptors such as the vitamin D receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor and the retinoic acid-receptorrelated orphan receptor α [14-16]. Mutations in hairless
result in humans and mice in alopecia, a form of hereditary hair loss due to defects in the regeneration of hair follicle cells [17-19]. More recently, JmjC-domain
containing proteins have gained emerging importance in
histone modification and chromatin regulation. The JmjC
domain containing histone demethylases (JHDMs) can
catalyse lysine demethylation of histones through an oxidative reaction that requires iron Fe(II) and 2OG. Histone
methylation marks have important roles in regulating
gene expression and are central to the control of epigenetic information that regulates cell fate and identity [20].
Until now, JHDMs have been reported to be capable to
reverse H3K36 (JHDM1/FBXL11, [21], JMJD2A, [22,23],
Rph1, [24,25], Jhd2, [25], Gis1, [25], Jhd1, [25]), H3K9
(JHDM2A/JMJD1A, [26]), and both H3K9 and H3K36
methylation (JHDM3A to JHDM3D/JMJD2A to JMJD2D,
[23,27-30]). In addition, the JARID subfamily of JmjCdomain containing proteins have been shown to possess
H3K4 demethylase activity in different species (JARID1A/
RBP2, [31,32], JARID1C/SMCX, [31,33], JARID1D/
SMCY,
[34],
JARID1B/PLU-1/Yjr119Cp/Jhdp2,
[31,35,36], Lid, [26,37-39], and JMJ2 [40]). Most recently,
the JmjC-domain containing proteins UTX and JMJD3
have been shown to function as H3K27 specific demethylases and demonstrated to play an important role in animal body patterning and regulation of inflammatory
responses [41-44]. Through this activity the JHDMs have
been postulated to regulate diverse cellular processes
including control of cell proliferation, heterochromatin
assembly and gene expression [26,28,30,34,45,46]. However, for most of the newly discovered JHDMs gene ablation studies in vivo have as yet not been carried out leaving
the possibility open that in addition to histones other substrates might be targets of these proteins.
Many of the different classes of JmjC domain containing
proteins possess complex domain architectures by having
at least one additional protein domain besides the JmjC
domain. Here, the JHDMs and Jarid proteins are good
examples. In addition to the JmjC domain they have
PHD, Tudor, Bright/Arid and zinc finger domains, which
have recently been shown to interact with methylated histone tails and are required for their catalytic function
[33,38,47]. In contrast, other members in this protein
superfamily have no other recognisable protein domain
apart from the JmjC domain. Important members of this
subgroup of JmjC domain only proteins are the 2OGdependent dioxygenase factor inhibiting HIF (Hif1an,

Page 2 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:293

also known as FIH) and the PHD hydroxylases, which are
involved in the maintenance of oxygen homeostasis.
Hif1an was the first structurally resolved mammalian
JmjC domain containing protein [48,49] and was shown
to function as an asparagine hydroxylase for the hypoxia
inducible factor α (HIF1α), a transcription factor that is
central to oxygen homeostasis in both physiological and
pathophysiological processes (for review see [50]). The
PHD hydroxylases PHD1 to PHD3 also target HIF1α by
hydroxylating proline residues. Under normal oxygen
conditions the hydroxylation reactions carried out by
PHDs induce the proteasomal degradation of the HIF1α
subunit, whereas under hypoxia HIF1α is not hydroxylated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
where it activates transcription of genes needed for adaptation to low oxygen levels. AlkB is another member of the
JmjC domain only proteins. As a 2OG-dependent oxygenase AlkB can repair DNA that is methylated at 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine by oxidation of the methyl
group [51,52]. AlkB and related proteins define a subfamily of small 2OG-dependent oxygenases that are
involved in DNA and RNA repair [53].
In the past, we have analysed the function of the phosphatidylserine receptor (Ptdsr or also known as PSR or PtdSerR),
a gene that also encodes a JmjC domain only protein
[54,55]. First described as a cell surface receptor for the
recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells [56], recent
studies have raised serious doubts about its involvement
in apoptotic cell clearance. Five groups independently
reported a nuclear localisation of Ptdsr, which clearly contradicts the hypothesis that the protein might function as
a transmembrane receptor [57-61]. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis carried out by us in Ptdsr-knockout
mice demonstrated no impairment in the removal of
apoptotic cells in Ptdsr-deficient embryos and macrophages ([54] for Ptdsrtm1Gbf) thereby contradicting two previous studies that reported defects in apoptotic cell
clearance in two other Ptdsr-knockout mice ([62] for
Ptdsrtm1Flv, and [63] for Ptdsrtm1Ysfk). All studies involving
Ptdsr-knockout mice conclusively demonstrated that the
gene is essential for normal development. Ptdsr-deficient
mice are dying at birth and display severe differentiation
defects in many tissues such as brain, eyes, lung, kidney,
liver and intestine at different stages of embryogenesis
[54,62,63]. Furthermore, Ptdsr plays an important role
during heart development and ablation of Ptdsr function
is associated with complex cardio-pulmonary malformations that resemble the human congenital heart syndrome
Tetralogy of Fallot [55].
Although Ptdsr is clearly an important differentiation-promoting gene during embryogenesis its molecular function
is still unknown. Based on a bioinformatic analysis of the
cloned Hydra homologue PSR, Cikala and colleagues were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

the first to suggest that the protein might function as a
2OG-dependent dioxygenase that is capable of modifying
unknown nuclear targets [57]. In recognition of the still
unknown function of the "phosphatidylserine receptor
gene" the International Committee for Standardized
Genetic Nomenclature in Mice (ICSGNM) has most
recently revised its name. Ptdsr has been renamed into
jumonji domain containing gene 6 (Jmjd6). We will obey the
guidelines of the ICSGNM and use this name and the gene
symbol Jmjd6 throughout the remainder of this article.
To gain more insights into possible Jmjd6 functions using
sequence homology approaches, we developed a semiautomated process to extract all available Jmjd6 homologous protein and nucleic acid sequences from public
databases. This comprehensive data set was used to identify proteins with sequence homology to Jmjd6 in 62 species across all major living phyla. In addition, this allowed
us to identify new Jmjd6/JMJD6 splice variants in mice and
humans and to analyse the genomic neighbourhood of
the gene in vertebrates. Immediately downstream of Jmjd6
we found the gene 1110005A03Rik, which is predicted to
encode a putative methyltransferase, which is as yet not
further biochemically characterised. Interestingly, we
found 1110005A03Rik to be affected by deletions in two
previously reported Jmjd6 knockout mice. To predict possible structure-function relationships of Jmjd6, we
employed a comparative modelling approach of the
three-dimensional structure of the protein and annotated
probable functional residues based on sequence conservation. To integrate Jmjd6 into the superfamily of JmjCdomain containing proteins, we assembled a non-redundant set of 313 DSBH-domain containing proteins by
using our semiautomatic retrieval script and grouped
these according to phylogenetic relationships. Taken
together, our results further support a conserved enzymatic function of Jmjd6 most likely as a classical nonheme, Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent dioxygenase. It also
shows that Jmjd6 is closely related to Jmjd4 and JFP6, and
constitutes together with these two proteins a subgroup of
JmjC domain containing proteins. Moreover, we identified in protista, fungi and plants proteins with sequence
homology to Jmjd6 that diverge from the classical "JmjConly domain" structure. Some of these proteins have in
comparison to the animalia Jmjd6 extended C-terminal
regions that contain additional domains that might have
been lost during evolution.
With these approaches we establish here an overall framework of information that will facilitate not only further
research regarding the functional characterisation of
Jmjd6 but also of other members within the DSBHdomain containing superfamily of proteins.

Results
Retrieval and analysis of a comprehensive set of Jmjd6
orthologs and other JmjC domain containing proteins
We developed a semiautomatic process to extract all available Jmjd6 homologous protein and nucleic acid
sequences from public databases. The computational
pipeline consists of three parallel procedures based on
"DNA", "protein", and "protein domain" searches (Figure
1). With this approach, we generated a candidate list of
11.376 sequence entries including all putative Jmjd6
orthologs and all JmjC/DSBH domain containing proteins present in Genbank, Ensembl, Uniprot, PFAM, Interpro, and SMART, independent of their annotation. The
goal of our semiautomated computational pipeline was
then to identify and systematically analyse all orthologous
Jmjd6 loci, all transcripts encoded by the murine and
human Jmjd6/JMJD6 loci, the degree and distribution of
sequence conservations in Jmjd6 proteins, and their phylogenetic relationship to other JmjC/DSBH domain containing proteins. In the end, the combination of these
analysis approaches enabled us to identify 62 proteins
with significant sequence homology to Jmjd6 and to
establish a set of 313 non-redundant DSBH domain containing proteins in human and eight model organisms.

We started the "DNA" sequence based retrieval and analysis approach (depicted in yellow in Figure 1) by identification of all mouse Jmjd6 homologous sequences
available in Ensembl (release 44). This candidate loci list
contained homologous Jmjd6 loci in fully annotated
genomes as well as Jmjd6 sequence fragments from ongoing sequencing projects. To identify conserved coding and
non-coding sequences within these genomic regions we
undertook a PipMaker analysis of retrieved sequences that
showed a similar genomic organisation in comparison to
the murine Jmjd6 locus. Next, we mapped all available
murine and human ESTs in dbEST to the murine and
human Jmjd6/JMJD6 loci, respectively, using the program
e2g. Extensive validations of each EST employing Sim4
with our own perlscript for data retrieval, handling, examination and sorting of the results led to a comprehensive
analysis of the murine and human Jmjd6/JMJD6 loci and
a detailed annotation of all encoded transcripts.
To identify all Jmjd6 orthologs, we employed a blastp
search against Ensembl and nr databases using a unique
N-terminal sequence of the murine Jmjd6 protein as a
template ("protein" based search and analysis, depicted in
Figure 1 in green). The candidate matches were individually verified in a Mus musculus restricted blastp database
search using the reciprocal best BLAST hit criterion and a
perlscript for automatic data processing. These led to the
identification of Jmjd6 proteins in other species that are
closely related to and might be orthologs of the murine
Jmjd6 protein. A full length ClustalW alignment of pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

teins with significant homology to Jmjd6 was processed
using a TeXshade based conservation analysis and also as
input for a 3D structure prediction of the catalytic core
domain. By combining these results, we developed a
novel way of predicting residues that are most likely essential for the catalytic activity of the protein based on their
degree of conservation.
To analyse the phylogenetic evolution of the Jmjd6 JmjC
domain, we developed SMART-parser. SMART and
SMART-parser were used to analyse the domain composition and extract the sequence information from a set of
sequences that was derived from the Ensembl, Interpro,
Uniprot and SMART databases ("DSBH-domain" routine,
depicted in Figure 1 in blue). This set comprises all JmjC, Pfam-JmjC, Blast-JmjC-, P4Hc-, Pfam-2OG-FeII-Oxyand Pfam-PhyH-domain containing sequences from
human, mouse, zebrafish, pufferfish, nematode, fruit fly,
and yeast. These different domain names have been used
in the past to annotate the JmjC domain in DSBH fold
containing proteins. The SMART-parser verified sequences
were used as an input for a global ClustalW alignment. A
PHYLIP processing of all ClustalW alignments allowed
the analysis of the Jmjd6 phylogeny in relationship to all
other identified DSBH domain containing proteins.
Comparative analysis of Jmjd6 homologous loci in
vertebrates
In the mouse, Jmjd6 is localised in a gene dense region on
distal chromosome 11. Using different gene targeting
strategies three loss-of-function alleles of Jmjd6 have been
generated that display conflicting phenotypes [54,62,63].
To analyse the immediate genomic neighbourhood of
Jmjd6 and to identify all transcripts encoded by the locus,
we undertook a comparative sequence analysis of this
gene region in different species. In Ensembl, the mouse
Jmjd6 gene is annotated to consist of six exons compromising 6 kb (Ensembl release 44). Immediately downstream of Jmjd6 two genes are located, 1110005A03Rik, an
expressed sequence tag (EST) encoding a putative arginine
protein methyltransferase [64], and Sfrs2, encoding the
splicing factor SC 35 [65]. To analyse the genomic region
encompassing Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik in more detail,
we performed a comprehensive database screen. First, we
searched all fully sequenced genomes present in Ensembl
build release 44 for an annotated Jmjd6 gene. We identified Jmjd6 homologous genes or genomic Jmjd6 fragments
in 17 mammalian, 1 avian, 1 amphibian, 5 fish, 2 urochordata, and 4 invertebrate genomes (Table 1). The identified putative Jmjd6 orthologous loci were then searched
for the presence of the 1110005A03Rik gene. In 22 out of
the 30 analysed genomes we found both genes located
close together. Remarkably, in all analysed invertebrate
species Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik were not found to colocalise despite the presence of both genes at other chro-

mosomal locations in the examined genomes. Next, we
extracted 50 to 100 kb of genomic sequence encompassing the Jmjd6 locus and adjacent loci of these 22 species
and used these for an initial PipMaker sequence analysis
(data not shown). To carry this out, the mouse sequence
was first analysed for repetitive sequence elements using
RepeatMasker and secondly, the positions of all coding
sequences/exons in Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik, and Sfrs2 were
identified and annotated using the BLAST algorithm. The
masked and annotated mouse sequence was then finally
used for interspecies pairwise alignment with the human,
bovine, armadillo, opossum, zebrafish, chicken, western
clawed frog, and puffer fish sequences using the program
PipMaker [66]. These species were selected for the analysis
either based on their large phylogenetic distance to the
mouse or on the availability of high quality, full-coverage
sequence information in the extracted regions. The resulting alignments of similar regions in the genomic
sequences were summarised as "percent identity plot"
(pip) displaying sequence identity in combination with
the annotated repeats and transcriptional units (Figure 2).
The pip shows a high degree of sequence conservation in

the coding regions of the three genes and confirms the
accuracy of the initial exon assignments annotated by
Ensembl. However, a detailed inspection of the Jmjd6
locus identified further high-level conserved sequences (=
90%) in between the annotated exons 4 and 5 (red overlay in Figure 2). This sequence conservation suggested the
presence of an up to now overseen additional exon, at
least in the mammalian species. In addition, the pip confirms the close association of the Jmjd6 and
1110005A03Rik genes in all analysed organisms. Jmjd6
and 1110005A03Rik are arranged in a head-to-head transcriptional orientation with a short intergenic distance of
65 bp between both genes. This suggests that these two
genes build a conserved transcriptional unit that possibly
shares a bi-directional promoter region. This is further
supported by the presence of a conserved short non-coding sequence in between the translational start sites of
these two genes (orange overlay in Figure 2). Interestingly,
we observed not only a conserved association of the Jmjd6
and 1110005A03Rik genes in this genomic region, but
also of Sfrs2, which is present in this region in all species
with the exception of the puffer fish (Figure 2). In the

distal to 1110005A03Rik (Figure 2).
To further test the hypothesis that an additional exon in
Jmjd6 might generate alternative transcripts of this gene,
we investigated all available mouse Jmjd6 EST data currently present in dbEST. Using e2g, a web-based server
that allows an efficient mapping of large EST and cDNA
datasets to genomic regions [67], all Jmjd6 ESTs were
mapped to the mouse locus and adjacent regions. The
resulting EST hits represent the entire putative Jmjd6 coding region including the transcribed and untranslated
regions (UTRs). These cDNA sequences were then
extracted and individually aligned with the mouse Jmjd6
genomic sequence using Sim4, a computer program that
allows an efficient assignment of cDNAs to large genomic
regions by accounting for the position of introns [68]. The
Sim4 validated EST sequences were then manually curated
and all predicted Jmjd6 transcripts were assembled and
annotated to the genomic locus. As a result of this analysis, we identified a new variant of exon 4 in Jmjd6 and
found an additional, before overseen exon in the con-

served region between exons 4 and 5. This allowed us,
solely based on the EST data, to predict the presence of
two novel Jmjd6 splice variants in addition to the main
transcript of 1.4 kb currently annotated in Ensembl (Figure 3A). To validate in vivo the existence of the predicted
splice variants, we performed RT-PCR expression analysis.
Various major organs from adult mice as well as whole
embryos at different developmental stages (E) were used
for the analysis. RT-PCR amplification yielded three DNA
fragments indicative for the predicted transcripts in all
analysed samples at varying levels (Figure 3B). Taken
together, this confirmed the computational prediction of
two new Jmjd6 splice variants encoded by the mouse locus
and demonstrated that Jmjd6 consists of seven exons, with
exon 4 occurring in two different variants 4a and 4b,
respectively. At the protein level both new detected splice
variants (transcripts 2 and 3 in Figure 3A) affect the C-terminal part of the Jmjd6 protein. In comparison to the
main transcript annotated in Ensembl (transcript 1 in Figure 3A), either a stretch of 9 amino acids starting at position 302 is exchanged against 31 other residues (transcript
Mm3 in Figure 3C) or a premature stop codon is intro-

Identification and characterisation of new splice variants of Jmjd6
Figure 3
Identification and characterisation of new splice variants of Jmjd6. (A) Two additional putative exons (green boxes)
were identified in addition to the transcript annotated in Ensembl (variant 1) by screening all public EST databases. Alternative
splicing using these two exons results in the generation of two additional transcripts of Jmjd6 (variants 2 and 3, respectively).
Half arrows and orange lines in the schematic presentation of the transcripts highlight the combination of exons detected by
RT-PCR. Numbering of Jmjd6 exons includes the additional identified exon variants 4b and 5. (B) Expression analysis of alternative Jmjd6 transcripts in adult mouse organs and embryonic stages (E) using RT-PCR confirmed the presence of all three transcripts at different mRNA expression levels in the analysed samples. Half arrows in (A) indicate the position of the PCR
primers used for the amplification. Blue numbers and arrows in (B) point to PCR fragments amplified from splice variants 1 to
3. Amplification of the housekeeping β-actin gene was used as a loading control. (C) The effects of the different splicing events
on the C-termini are shown in the gapped alignment from amino acid 300 onwards. The full length human JMJD6 and murine
Jmjd6 proteins are represented in the upper part of the figure. Nearly all novel splice variants identified in the mouse (Mm 2)
and in humans (Hs 2–3) are truncated at the C-terminus in comparison to splice variant 1 (Mm 1 and Hs 1) and are predicted
to contain no poly-serine stretch ([Ser]n). In contrast, the JmjC domain is not affected (green box). Predicted AT-hook domain,
sumoylation recognition site (Sumo), and nuclear export signals (NES) are annotated as depicted at the bottom.

duced resulting in a truncated protein of 314 amino acids
(transcript Mm2 in Figure 3C). Using the CBS-prediction
service, we identified in this region of the protein a putative sumoylation site (probability score 92%) and a
nuclear export signal (probability score 96%) using
NetNES. Furthermore, this region contains the previously
described putative AT-hook domain [57] and the poly-serine stretch domain ([69,70] Figure 3C). All these potential
interaction sites are not present in the protein encoded by

transcript Mm2. Transcript Mm3 differs in comparison
with the main transcript (Mm1) in a stretch of 31 amino
replacing the putative AT-hook containing region (Figure
3C).
Based on the identification of the highly conserved
sequence coding for the new exon 5 in all mammalian
species (Figure 2 and data not shown), we performed a
similar e2g and Sim4 analysis using the human JMJD6

locus and human EST database entries. This analysis confirmed the presence of exon 5 containing JMJD6 transcripts in humans and also the presence of two different
variants of exon 4 in the human genome. Using again RTPCR, we validated the expression of these transcripts in
vivo. Similar to the mouse we found expression of the
three transcripts in 10 human tissues [see Additional file
1]. These, as well as the mouse alternative transcripts, were
further validated and confirmed by sequencing (Accession
numbers EF527404 for Mm2 and EF527405 for Mm3 for
mouse Jmjd6 and EF527406 for Hs2 and EF527407 for
Hs3 for human JMJD6 transcript variants, respectively). In
comparison to the new identified mouse transcript variants, both human transcript variants are predicted to generate truncated proteins. Neither of these predicted
proteins appear to encode a nuclear export signal,
sumoylation site, AT hook domain or poly-serine stretch
at the C-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 3C). As an insertion of premature translation termination codons might
result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the corresponding mRNA [71], we analysed if the mouse transcript
variant 2 and human splicing variants 2 and 3 might be
subjected to degradation by the NMD pathway. Using RTPCR assays for each of these variants we found that this is
not the case. Primers located in the new introduced exons
and at the 3'-end of each transcript yielded products of the
expected size, indicating that these variants are indeed
expressed and most likely functional [see Additional file
2]. The human and mouse splice variants seem to be
expressed at different mRNA levels depending on the tissue analyzed (see Figure 3 and [see Additional file 2]),
with mouse splice variant Mm1 expressed in higher
amounts in the developing embryo (Figure 3). Interestingly, an e2g and Sim4 analysis performed in non-mammalian species did not result in the recognition of mouse
and human related Jmjd6 splice variants in these organisms (data not shown).
To analyse the conserved, putative bi-directional promoter element in between Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik, we
tried to identify potential regulatory motifs in the
genomic sequence encompassing the intergenic region,
the 5'-UTRs and the first exons of both genes. We isolated
a 840 bp fragment covering the genomic region between
Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik (Figure 4A) that contained several predicted transcription factor binding sites based on a
MatInspector analysis (data not shown). This fragment
was further analysed using a promoter-less luciferase
reporter gene assay. In comparison to controls, the
selected genomic fragment clearly possesses transcriptional promoter activity when transfected into primary
mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) and various cell
lines (Figure 4B and data not shown). Moreover, this transcription activating activity was found to be orientation
dependent. In the forward strand orientation (which con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

trols in vivo 1110005A03Rik expression according to the
genomic annotation in Ensembl) the fragment showed
only half of the activity as compared to the reverse strand
orientation (Figure 4B), which controls expression of
Jmjd6 in vivo. This demonstrated that the short intergenic
region between Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik is capable to
control basal expression of both genes, although this bidirectional transcriptional unit seems to activate both
genes at different levels.
We then went on to investigate the consequences on
Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik and Sfrs2 expression of the different gene targeting strategies used to generate the three
Jmjd6 mouse knockout alleles. In all three Jmjd6 mutant
mice (Jmjd6tm1Flv, generated by the Flavell laboratory;
Jmjd6tm1Ysfk, generated by the Fukui laboratory; and
Jmjd6tm1Gbf, generated in our laboratory) the first two or
three exons of the gene have been deleted. However, an
alignment of restriction enzyme sites used to construct the
different gene targeting vectors reveals that in Jmjd6tm1Flv
and Jmjd6tm1Ysfk mice, in contrast to the Jmjd6tm1Gbf mouse
line, exon 1 of 1110005A03Rik was deleted in addition
[see Figure A in Additional file 3]. This was confirmed
when we analysed the expression of all three genes in
homozygous embryos harvested from the three mutant
mouse lines. Jmjd6tm1Flv-/- and Jmjd6tm1Ysfk-/- animals show
no expression of 1110005A03Rik and Jmjd6, while the
expression of Sfrs2 remains unaffected by the gene targeting. In Jmjd6tm1Gbf homozygous embryos 1110005A03Rik,
and Sfrs2 are expressed comparable to wild type levels [see
Figure B in Additional file 3] and as previously shown
[54], only the expression of Jmjd6 is ablated in this mouse
mutant line. This was further supported by semiquantitative expression analysis of 1110005A03Rik in Jmjd6tm1Gbf-/
- embryos and primary fetal liver-derived macrophage cultures. RT-PCR analysis of serial diluted cDNA shows equal
expression of 1110005A03Rik in Jmjd6tm1Gbf animals in
comparison to wildtype controls in all analysed samples
[see Figure C in Additional file 3]. Thus, the Jmjd6tm1Flv and
Jmjd6tm1Ysfkalleles represent double knockouts of the Jmjd6
and 1110005A03Rik genes, while the Jmjd6tm1Gbf allele
ablates only Jmjd6 gene expression.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Jmjd6 protein
Following the identification of Jmjd6 orthologues in 30 of
the 34 species annotated in Ensembl (Table 1), which
implied a broad distribution of Jmjd6 during evolution,
we continued to search for additional homologous proteins in other species. To identify further candidate proteins, we performed a comprehensive database (nr) search
using the blastp algorithm and the N-terminal part
encompassing amino acids 53 to 152 of the mouse Jmjd6
protein. For the search strategy, we explicitly excluded the
highly conserved JmjC domain to reduce the number of
false positive hits representing Jmjd6-unrelated JmjC

Identification of the Jmjd6 – 1110005A03Rik bi-directional transcriptional unit. (A) Schematic overview of the
65 bp non-coding and non-overlapping intergenic region
between the murine Jmjd6 and 1110005A03Rik (Rik) genes.
The conserved sequence element identified using PipMaker
in Figure 2 is shown in orange. 5'-untranslated regions
(UTRs) are indicated in grey, and first exon coding sequences
of the Jmjd6 gene in green and of the 1110005A03Rik gene in
blue, respectively. The region indicated by two half arrows
was used for promoter activity assays presented in (B). It was
amplified and cloned to yield an 840 bp test fragment (B)
This putative bi-directional promoter fragment was used in a
luciferase reporter gene assay to measure transcriptional
activity. Basal promoter activity was found for both transcriptional orientations compared to a promoterless control
(pGL3) vector. The 5'-3' orientation of the fragment
(1110005A03Rik orientation, Rik) yielded only half of the
transcriptional activity as it was measured for the 3'-5' orientation (Jmjd6 orientation, Jmjd6). The values reported for the
transfection experiments are means ± standard deviation of

domain containing proteins. To ascertain that we select
for the subsequent analysis in each species the sequence
with the highest homology to Jmjd6, we used the "recip-

rocal best BLAST hit" criterion [72]. The obtained fulllength database entries were used for a Mus musculusrestricted blastp-search of the nr database and for each
species only those sequences matching Jmjd6 as the best
BLAST hit criterion were retained for the analysis. As some
sequences are only available from early stage annotation
projects (low-sequence coverage genomes, [73]), we
selected 54 out of 62 sequences due to quality measures as
a working package for the calculation of a multiple
sequence alignment by employing ClustalW. Following
five iterations of re-alignment of the protein sequences the
multiple sequence alignment was shaded with respect to
amino acid identity/similarity and a protein sequence
logo was generated and adjusted to the background frequency of each amino acid in the alignment. In addition,
predicted secondary structure elements and SMART
domains of the mouse Jmjd6 protein were added (Figure
5). The retrieved reciprocal best BLAST hits from the different species and the quality of the multiple sequence
alignment allowed us to confirm the high homology of
these 54 proteins to the murine Jmjd6 protein (Figure 5).
Many of those are with no doubt true orthologous proteins of the mouse Jmjd6. These are found in the mammalia, aves, amphibia, actinopterygii, urchordata,
echinodermata, insecta, nematoda, platyhelminthes, and
cnideria and demonstrate the remarkable conservation of
the Jmjd6 gene during evolution (Figure 5 and [see Additional file 4]) as previously also noted by others ([56,57]).
However, some proteins identified in plants, protista,
fungi differ from the "JmjC only" domain structure characteristic for the Jmjd6 proteins of animalia. For example,
some of them contain nearly five times more amino acids
or have in addition to the JmjC-domain single F-box
domains [see Additional files 4 and 9]. Nevertheless, they
are the closest relatives to the mouse Jmjd6 as defined by
the best reciprocal BLAST hit criterion. Thus, it is difficult
to decide if these proteins might be true orthologs of the
animalia Jmjd6 proteins. If they are, it could mean that
additional protein domains have been lost from an
ancient Jmjd6 protein during evolution in the animalia
lineage.
To explore potentially important residues for Jmjd6 function we compared the degree of sequence conservation
across the aligned sequences and included in the alignment predicted tertiary structure elements of the protein.
First, our analysis showed the presence of a 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad (HxDxnH), as a common structural
motif among non-heme iron(II) enzymes, present in all
identified Jmjd6 proteins (Figure 5), suggesting an evolutionary conserved enzymatic function of Jmjd6. We could
identify within the predicted JmjC domain eight β-strands
(I-VIII) that have been shown to form the characteristic
jelly-roll topology in other structurally resolved JmjC
domain containing proteins [6]. The amino acids encom-

Figure sequence alignment of homologous Jmjd6 proteins
Multiple5
Multiple sequence alignment of homologous Jmjd6 proteins. The sequences of 54 homologous Jmjd6 proteins were
used for the calculation of a multiple sequence alignment (ClustalW). The numbering of the residues is according to the mouse
protein sequence. Identical residues were shaded in blue and similar residues in magenta. Green shading indicates the predicted
catalytic residues of the HxDxnH facial. Sequence insertions in individual species outside of the conserved core regions of the
mouse Jmjd6 protein were masked out and the maximum numbers of amino acids in these insertions are indicated [n]. Based
on the sequence conservation, a frequency corrected sequence logo was calculated (shown above the alignment) and the
mouse sequence conservation was highlighted in colour dots according to their degree of conservation (shown as colour code
in percent identity below the alignment). The JmjC domain (light blue bar) and additional identified secondary structure elements (red cylinders: α-helices; yellow and green arrows: β-strands) were annotated to the sequence as indicated at the bottom and the β-strands forming the jelly-roll of the JmjC domain were numbered (I-VIII). Green arrows represent the β-sheet
that extends the major sheet outside of the jelly-roll.

passing these β-strands are highly conserved in all proteins. 50% of all β-strands forming amino acids are
identical in at least 85% of the analysed species suggesting
the spatial and functional conservation of the JmjCdomain in all analysed proteins. The only exception we
found is in between β-strands IV and V. At this position we
found an insertion of sequences of variable amino acid
conservation among species and of varying length as it has
been previously described for other JmjC domain containing proteins [6,22,53]. Second, within the C-terminal

region of the Jmjd6 protein preceding the last β-strands of
the recognised jelly-roll the degree of sequence conservation is decreased. In contrast to the metazoan species
showing a high degree of sequence identity, all other species display a significantly reduced similarity in this
region. Furthermore, only the metazoan species have a
poly-serine stretch in the C-terminal region of the Jmjd6
protein (Figure 5 and [70]). We could not identify any
comparable sequence motif in the other species but looking for chemical properties of amino acids present at this

position in proteins of non-metazoan species we found an
enrichment of polar amino acids in this part of the protein
(data not shown). This suggests at least a conservation and
fortification of physico-chemical properties in this region
during evolution. Third, the part N-terminal of the JmjC
domain shows in comparison to the C-terminus a higher
degree of conservation. We found that 20% of the amino
acids 59–140 are identical in at least 90% of the analysed
proteins (Figure 5). In addition, we identified one highly
conserved and three less conserved β-strands in this
region. These findings suggest the presence of an important structural element of the Jmjd6 protein in close vicinity to the predicted JmjC domain (see below).
Comparative modelling and analysis of the conserved
putative catalytic core domain of Jmjd6
Due to the fact that up to now no crystal structure of
Jmjd6 is available, we decided to perform a homology/
comparative modelling of the three-dimensional structure
of the protein. The multiple sequence alignment of Jmjd6
homologous proteins (amino acids 44–329; Figure 5) was
used for pairwise comparison of profile hidden Markov
models (HMMs). This generated an alignment of the protein sequence that can be modelled with known related
structures. This first step showed a significant probability
(= 95%) of structural similarity of Jmjd6 to the three structurally resolved 2OG- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases
Hif1an (PDB entry 1h2k), putative asparaginyl hydroxylase – 2636534 from Bacillus subtilis (PDB entry 1vrb) and
Jmjd2a (PDB entry 2gp5), respectively. The alignment
generated by HHpred [74] was finally prepared to create a
structural model and MODELLER [75] calculated this
comparative model of the Jmjd6 protein based on the
identified similarities containing all non-hydrogen atoms
(Figure 6). The comparative modelling of Jmjd6 predicted
that the Jmjd6 fold is a mixed alpha-beta structure composed of a major and a minor β-sheet surrounded by several α-helices. The structure showed the presence of the
2OG- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase typical doublestranded β-helix (DSBH) motif as the protein core. It consists of two anti-parallel β-sheets composed of eight βstrands. The major sheet is defined by β-strands I, VIII, III,
the minor sheet by β-strands VI and II, VII, IV, and V (Figure 6 and [see Additional file 7]), which form a jelly-roll
topology. In addition, we recognised in the model three βstrands extending the core DSBH, resulting in a sevenstranded major β-sheet (green arrows in Figure 5 and
orange arrows in Figure 6A). Interestingly, these additional strands were found to be paired anti-parallel to
each other and to the major β-sheet.

Following iterative backbone annealing based on the
structure of Hif1an (PDB entry 1h2k), 2OG and Fe(II)
were added to the 3D model of Jmjd6. After energy minimisation utilising the SwissPDB Viewer, the predicted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

active site of the Jmjd6-Fe(II)-2OG complex was analysed
in detail. Here, we found the proper positioning of the 2His-1-carboxylate facial triad chelating the iron atom in a
manner similar to other 2OG- and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases (Figure 6B). The HxD motif (His 187 and Asp
189) is predicted to be located just after the sequence of
DSBH β-strand II and the second Fe(II)-binding histidine
(His 273) is located on DSBH β-strand VII. The observation of Fe(II) coordination by these three residues confirms their initially suggested assignment based on the
primary sequence analysis of the multiple sequence alignment of Jmjd6 proteins (Figure 5). In addition, we could
identify in the model several residues within the putative
active core of Jmjd6 capable of positioning the co-substrate 2OG in the cavity formed by the interior of the
DSBH. The proper positioning of 2OG relative to the
Fe(II) seems to be achieved by an interaction of several
residues of the active core that are close enough to the
hydrogen-bond with the 2OG. Among these residues we
predict Asn197 and Trp174 to interact with the 1-carboxylate oxygen of 2OG that is not ligated to the Fe(II).
Asn197 and Trp174 are stabilised by Thr285. Interestingly, in Jmjd6, like in Hif1an and Jmjd2a, a lysine
(Lys204, from DSBH β-strand IV) could be important for
the binding of the C5'-carboxylate of 2OG. Most of the
other structurally resolved 2OG- and Fe(II)-dependent
dioxygenases have instead of the threonine 285 an
arginine at this position, which is part of a RXS motif
within the DSBH β-strand VIII [76,77]. Thus, Jmjd6 has in
contrast to other 2OG-dependent dioxygenases no tripeptide RXS motif (Figure 5). In addition to these major 2OG
interacting residues in Jmjd6, we could recognise additional residues (Phe133 and Val275) for putative hydrophobic interactions in the active core of the protein.
Beside the high probability of the Jmjd6 structure
deduced from the comparative modelling approach, we
searched for an additional, independent validation of this
prediction. To achieve this, we decided to combine phylogenetic sequence analysis data and our comparative
modelling data to proof the reliability of the Jmjd6 protein structure prediction. Accordingly, the amino acid
identity across all 54 analysed species was translated into
an indicative colour code ranging from dark red, representing amino acid identity across all species, to dark blue
for highly variable/non-conserved residues (Figure 5).
This colour code was applied to the calculated Jmjd6
structure and the individual amino acids were coloured
according to their conservation (Figure 7). This computational approach demonstrated a strong conservation of
the predicted Jmjd6 catalytic triad during evolution with
100% sequence identity of the HxD motif in all analysed
54 species (Figure 7A). In addition, residues that are predicted to bind 2-OG (Asn197, Thr285, Trp174, Lys204,
and Thr187) are also highly conserved (Figure 7B),

strongly suggesting that Jmjd6 is indeed possessing a
2OG-dependent dioxygenase function. Furthermore, a
surface model of the protein with annotated sequence
conservation shows that the putative active centre is
located in a deep and narrow pocket [see Additional file
5]. Interestingly, the surface protein model also shows
conservation of an exposed N-terminal region between βstrands 2 and 3 of the major β-sheet that is extending the
DSBH core indicating that these residues might be important for interaction with other proteins [see Additional file
5]. In contrast to the sequence conservation observed in
the predicted catalytic core and the exposed N-terminal
major β-sheet, other regions of the protein have been
much less conserved during evolution. Thus, the major
selective pressure seems to have been on the catalytic
function of the protein, while other areas of the protein
retained flexibility in their functional design.
Integration of Jmjd6 into the JmjC domain containing
protein family
By using the computational pipeline described in Figure
1, we extracted a non-redundant set of 313 JmjC/DSBH
domain-containing proteins from the Ensembl, Interpro,
Uniprot and SMART databases. We selected these proteins
from human and eight model organisms (mouse,
zebrafish, pufferfish, tetraodon, nematode, fruitfly and
yeast) based on the sequence homology of their JmjC
domain to the mouse Jmjd6 and on the quality of the
available sequence. Because genome-sequencing projects
of many species are still ongoing, we had to exclude JmjC
domain encoding genes from some species with lowsequence coverage genomes that did not match our quality criteria. Nevertheless, our comprehensive catalogue
included 61 JmjC/DSBH-domain containing proteins
from Homo sapiens, 57 from Mus musculus, 49 from Danio
rerio, 53 from Tetraodon (T. nigroviridis and T. rubripes), 45
from Drosophila melanogaster, 27 from Caenorhabditis elegans, 6 from Saccharomyces cerevisae, and 10 from
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [see Additional file 8]. The catalogue contains all classes of JmjC domain containing
proteins that have been described so far, including "JmjC
domain only" proteins. To classify these proteins into evolutionary subgroups and to investigate their evolutionary
relationship we analysed the selected sequences. A multiple sequence alignment and subsequent bootstrapping
analysis was carried out using ClustalW (1000 bootstrap
trials, 111 seeds) and PHYLIP. Based on the similarity of
the JmjC domain, the phylogenetic analysis revealed 25
evolutionary conserved subgroups [see Additional file 6].
These subgroups are in general accordance to previous
studies, which reported the classification of 44 JmjC
domain containing proteins into 4 related clusters [5] and
of 98 JmjC domain containing proteins into 7 subfamilies
[4]. Although, our analysis shows that especially the previously classified subgroup of "JmjC domain only family"

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

[4] splits into 8 further subgroups based on the sequence
divergence of their JmjC domain (1110034B05Rik family,
Hif1an, Hspbap1, Pla2g4b, Jmjd5, Jmjd4, Jmjd6, JFP6like, and No66/Mina53 subgroups). As previously
described [4,5], these proteins have beside their JmjC
domain no other recognisable protein domain but they
are clearly functionally distinct from each other regarding
reported protein interaction partners, cellular localisation
and physiological functions. For example, Hif1an is an
asparagine protein hydroxylase for the HIF1α transcription factor, Hspbap1 is a cytosolic protein that associates
with heat shock protein 27 kD, and Jmjd6, Mina53, No66
are distinct nuclear proteins with as yet unknown molecular functions. In addition to these groups, we included in
our analysis the AlkB, PH4/Phy-3, Ogfod2, Ogfod1/Tpa1,
Plod 1–3, Lepre1/Leprel 1–2, 1110031I02Rik, and Egln1–
3/Egl-9/Hph subgroups that were not analysed before
together with the recently identified JmjC domain containing histone demethylase proteins [4]. Interestingly,
we found that all subgroups could be classified independent of additional domain architectural features of the analysed proteins. As previously reported [4,5], the domain
compositions of individual proteins classified into a given
subgroup varied, indicating that neither their enzymatic
specificity nor their functional relationships can be predicted solely based on the analysis of primary protein
sequences. This is further supported by the identification
of certain members within subgroups that obviously can
not possess enzymatic functions as 2OG-dependent dioxygenases due to sequence changes within their predicted
Fe(II) and/or 2OG-binding sites. For example, the Hairless protein within the Jmjd1/Hairless subgroup, the Epe1
protein in the Jhd1 subgroup and the whole Jarid2 protein
subfamily contain substitutions in these binding sites
indicating that these proteins are unlikely to be functional
enzymes ([4] and Figure 8).
Interestingly, in some subgroups we observed a huge
expansion in the number of family members. The P4H/
Phy-3 family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases contained 22 proteins from Drosophila melanogaster. The P4H/Phy-3 subgroup compromises prolyl-4-hydroxylases involved in
collagen biosynthesis or hypoxia sensing. Currently, it is
unknown why especially the fly has so many members in
this protein family. Another example is the AlkB subfamily of DNA and RNA demethylating enzymes. This
group contains 45 proteins that split into the Alkbh1 to
Alkbh8 protein family members. Apart from Alkbh1 to
Alkbh3 that are known to be DNA/RNA repair enzymes
[52,78,79] the exact biochemical activity of most of the
other subfamily members has still to be determined.
Following phylogenetic analysis and tree generation a
subtree encompassing the Jmjd6 protein was extracted for
further analysis (Figure 8). By combining the information

from the phylogenomic analysis with the annotation of

related to Jmjd6 regarding sequence similarity. The JmjC
domain of both proteins shows the highest sequence sim-

ilarity among all 313 classified members (32% sequence
identity and 50% sequence similarity). This indicates that
Jmjd4 is the closest paralogue of Jmjd6.

Moreover, a detailed sequence analysis of JmjC domain
containing protein subfamilies that are related to the
Jmjd6 and Jmjd4 subgroups revealed further insights into
Fe (II) and 2OG coordinating mechanisms (Figure 8). The
JFP6 subgroup has a HxHxH motif instead of the Hx(D/
E)xnH motif that is commonly used by all other JmjC
domain containing proteins for the coordination of Fe(II)
(Figure 8, orange box). If this motif is compatible with an
oxygenase activity, as one would expect, has to be investigated in the future. Furthermore, the Jmjd5 homologue of
Tetraodon nigroviridis, all Phf2 proteins, and Epe1 have
only a Hx(D/E) motif (red box in Figure 8) and therefore
lack the second histidine, which is known to be important
for iron binding. Moreover, the T. nigroviridis Phf2 homologue lacks in addition the lysine that stabilises the C5'caboxylate of 2OG. Next to this motif, Tuskada et al.
described residues in positions -3, +6–8 and +13–15, in
respect to the HxD motif to be important for the catalytic
function of histone demethylases [21]. In the -3 position,
the 11100034B05Rik, JFP6 and No66/Mina subgroups
have a nonpolar side chain present in contrast to the polar
side chains of serine/threonine residues in other subgroups. In the +6–8 position, members of the Pla2g4b,
FBXL10/FBXL11, Phf2/Phf8, and individual members of
the JFP6 and Jhd1 subgroup have a conserved tyrosine. In
Epe1, this tyrosine has been shown to be important for
heterochromatin destabilisation, which is independent of
an Epe1 histone demethylation activity [21,46]. Another
interesting feature is the predicted presence of an
extended major β-sheet in most of the JmjC domain only
protein families encompassing the subtree (Figure 8).

Discussion
Here we report a systematic annotation and comparison
of Jmjd6 homologous proteins across diverse phyla. With
the recent description of the JmjC domain as a novel
demethylase signature motif [21] and the discovery that
many proteins containing JmjC domains are involved in
reversing histone methylation marks [4,80], this protein
superfamily has attracted central interest in many different fields of biology. It has become quite clear that these
enzymes have not only important functions in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin modification states but also
in diverse other physiological contexts ranging from oxygen sensing to fatty acid metabolism and DNA repair [81].
However, for most of these proteins it has remained difficult to unravel their molecular function or to predict their
enzymatic targets solely based on sequence comparisons
and analysis of their JmjC domains. In the past, we have
been interested in the "phosphatidylserine receptor"
(now renamed into jumonji domain containing 6), a
JmjC domain containing protein, which was initially
described to function as a type II transmembrane receptor
for the engulfment of apoptotic cells [56]. To compare the
JmjC domain of Jmjd6 to the DSBH/JmjC domains of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

other members within this protein superfamily we
designed a semiautomated sequence retrieval and analysis
routine that allowed us to establish a catalogue of 313
DSBH/JmjC domain containing proteins in nine selected
species. In addition, we analysed the Jmjd6 and neighbouring loci in vertebrates and investigated their modes of
expression.
Comparative analysis of the vertebrate Jmjd6 locus and
immediate neighbouring loci
With the ongoing genome sequencing projects in many
different species and integrated efforts to annotate the
functional content of fully sequenced genomes there is a
need to complement existing automated genome annotations with a focused bioinformatics analysis of individual
genes and gene families to make fully use of publicly
available databases and resources. Such approaches might
help to correct mistakes in automated annotation procedures and might add additional information to gene sets.
This will finally lead to a more comprehensive and accurate annotation of gene functions.

We used the PipMaker alignment tool to analyse the patterns of sequence conservation across the mouse Jmjd6
and the neighbouring loci 1110005A03Rik and Sfrs2. To
identify all protein coding exons as well as highly conserved non-coding sequence elements in this region we
analysed genomic sequences of 22 different vertebrate
species. This led to the identification of an up to now overseen additional Jmjd6 exon in mammals and to the detection of a conserved putative bi-directional promoter
element in between the closely spaced Jmjd6 and
1110005A03Rik genes. The re-annotated genomic region
encompassing the Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik and Sfrs2 loci
was then the basis for a comparison of gene-targeting
strategies that have been used to generate three different
loss-of-function alleles of Jmjd6 in the mouse [54,62,63].
By aligning a map of restriction enzyme sites used for the
construction of the different targeting vectors with the
genomic region encompassing the three genes, we could
show that in the Jmjd6tm1Flv allele and in the Jmjd6tm1Ysfk
allele exon 1 of the 111005A03Rik gene as well as the conserved intergenic region in between Jmjd6 and
111005A03Rik was deleted upon homologous recombination in ES cells. An expression analysis of Jmjd6,
111005A03Rik and Sfsr2 in the three different mouse alleles confirmed that Jmjd6tm1Flv and Jmjd6tm1Ysfk mutant mice
are double knockouts of the Jmjd6 and 111005A03Rik
genes. In contrast, the Jmjd6tm1Gbf allele ablates only the
expression of Jmjd6. Although all three independently
generated knockout mice show to some degree overlapping phenotypes regarding defects during embryogenesis
(e.g. disturbed eye development, brain malformations
and defects in haematopoiesis) other controversial observations concerning the description of specific phenotypes

Page 17 of 26

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:293

have been reported [54,62,63]. Foremost, the capabilities
of the mutant mouse lines to engulf apoptotic cells have
been described differently. While Kunisaki et al. [63] and
Li et al. [62] reported that their knockout mice showed
impairment in the clearance of apoptotic cells during
embryogenesis and defects in apoptotic cell phagocytosis
assays, no such differences in phagocytosis competence
could be detected in Jmjd6tm1Gbf mutant mice [54]. It has
been suggested that differences in genetic backgrounds
might account for these reported phenotypic variations
[82-84]. However, in the light of the described results with
Jmjd6tm1Flv and Jmjd6tm1Ysfk mutant mice being double
knockouts of Jmjd6 and 111005A03Rik the situation
might be far more complex. It could well be that loss-of
111005A03Rik function in Jmjd6tm1Flv and Jmjd6tm1Ysfk
knockout mice might contribute in addition to the Jmjd6deficiency to the phenotypic discrepancies observed.
Future studies involving the generation and analysis of
111005A03Rik knockout mice will address this possibility.
Interestingly, the as yet functionally uncharacterised
111005A03Rik gene contains a predicted arginine protein
methyltransferase domain. We demonstrate here, that the
conserved sequence element in the short intergenic region
between Jmjd6 and 111005A03Rik possess bi-directional
promoter activities for both genes. Of note, the forward
orientation of the fragment, which controls
111005A03Rik expression in vivo showed only half of the
transcriptional activity as compared to the reverse orientation, which controls Jmjd6 expression in vivo. This indicates that both genes might compose a bi-directional
transcriptional unit with opposing transcriptional and
regulatory activities. This gives room for speculations. If
111005A03Rik has a function as a methyltransferase and
the Jmjd6 protein possess demethylation activity as many
other JmjC domain containing proteins are doing, both
proteins might be involved in a common biochemical
pathway targeting possibly a shared substrate. Interestingly, such counterbalancing principles of methylation
and demethylation activity have been already suggested
for other JmjC domain containing proteins [53]. For
example, the Alkbh8 protein contains an amino-terminal
JmjC domain, which might possess DNA demethylase
activity that is fused to a predicted C-terminal methylase
domain. This domain architecture is conserved in the
homologous Alkbh8 proteins in Drosophila (CG17807)
and C. elegans (C14B1.10) suggesting the selection of a
controlled methylation/demethylation regulatory mechanism during the evolution of these proteins.
If Jmjd6 and 111005A03Rik also establish such counteracting functions needs to be addressed in the future. To proof
such a hypothesis, the molecular function of both genes
need first to be characterised. Nevertheless, the additional

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

deletion of the 111005A03Rik gene in two of the three
described Jmjd6 knockout mice might well explain differences reported for their apoptotic cell engulfment phenotypes. If 111005A03Rik is functioning as a
methyltransferase in the control of transcriptional regulation, it is possible that the expression of other genes targeted or regulated by 111005A03Rik and/or Jmjd6 might
influence phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. In such a scenario the described engulfment defects might be related to
secondary effects caused by deregulation of genes
involved in processes of phagocytosis or cellular differentiation of phagocytes.
Using PipMaker analysis based on sequence conservation
we identified a before overseen exon in Jmjd6 loci of
mammalian species. A subsequently undertaken e2g
annotation of all available EST sequences to the Jmjd6/
JMJD6 genomic regions lead to the discovery of two new
alternative transcripts in mice and humans. At the protein
level the most distal C-terminal part of the Jmjd6 protein
(last 100 amino acids) is affected in all new identified
transcripts. Either truncated polypeptides are generated
that miss the poly-serine stretch, the putative AT-hook
domain, and the predicted sumoylation and nuclear
export signal (NES) or a stretch of eight amino acid is
exchanged with 31 other residues. In this second splice
variant identified in mice (Mm3) the predicted sumoylation site, the NES and the poly-serine stretch are retained
but the putative AT-hook domain is missing (Figure 3C).
Our 3D structural model of the Jmjd6 protein indicates
that the sumoylation site, the NES and the AT-hook motif
might be accessible for interacting proteins. The AT-hook
domain is known to mediate binding to DNA in highmobility group proteins [85]. Jmjd6 is a nuclear protein,
which has been shown to contain five independently
active nuclear localisation signals [58]. The NES might
allow a shuttling of the protein from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. Likewise, the sumoylation site might be used
for the regulation of interactions with other proteins.
A comparison of the Jmjd6 sequence with the resolved
protein structure of the Hif1an/HIF1α C-terminal transactivation domain co-complex indicates that interactions
with other proteins might occur in the Jmjd6 C-terminal
region [49]. Alternatively, at this site homo-di- or homomultimerization of Jmjd6 polypeptides might take place.
For many JmjC/DSBH domain containing enzymes it is
known that they can exist in various oligomeric forms. For
example, Hif1an is a dimer in solution, germin forms a
hexamer and HPPE a tetramer (for review see [6]). Indeed,
very recently it could be demonstrated that Jmjd6 forms
covalent multimers through homomeric polymerisation
of the 50 kD protein [61]. Nuclear aggregated Jmjd6 products with masses of 100, 150, 200 and 250 kD were
detected after immunoprecipitation indicating that

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:293

assembly of homomultimers might be important for the
protein function [61]. Thus, the new alternative transcripts encoded by the Jmjd6 locus might possess a regulatory role by suppressing multimer formation or
interactions with other proteins. Such possibilities need to
be experimentally investigated in the future.
Structural model of the Jmjd6 protein and evolutionary
relationship to other JmjC/DSBH-domain containing
proteins
Recent crystallographic studies have helped to provide
important insights in the structure and functions of JmjC
domain containing proteins. More than ten structures of
different members of this large oxygenase family have
been solved demonstrating that the JmjC domain forms a
characteristic DSBH structural fold composed of eight βstrands that build two β-sheets each containing four antiparallel β-strands [6]. The catalytic core of these metalloenzymes consists of a highly conserved Hx(E/D)xnH signature motif that supplies three chelating positions for the
Fe(II) iron and two additional chelating positions are contributed by the substrate co-factor 2OG. Very often the
binding sites for 2OG in the DSBH core are as well conserved among the members of this protein family. Due to
high sequence similarity of Jmjd6 to other JmjC domain
containing proteins [57], we have embarked on the modelling of the Jmjd6 3D-structure to gain further insights
into possible protein functions. Our analysis shows that
Jmjd6 is indeed most likely a DSBH-fold containing 2OGdependent dioxygenase enzyme, as previously first suggested by Cikala and colleagues [57]. All residues needed
for Fe(II) coordination, 2OG co-substrate binding and
oxidative catalysis were found to be located within the
predicted DSBH domain of the protein model and are
evolutionary preserved in all analysed Jmjd6 homologous
proteins probably including those of non-metazoan species. We identified in all orthologous Jmjd6 proteins from
metazoan species the characteristic HxDx[n]H catalytical
triad and our model predicts five conserved residues
(Trp174, Thr184, Asn197, Lys204, and Thr285) as being
important for interaction with a 2OG co-substrate. In
addition, the extreme conservation of residues forming
the eight β-strands of the DSBH domain suggests a spatial
and functional conservation of the Jmjd6 JmjC domain
during evolution. This makes it highly likely that all Jmjd6
proteins in the different animal kingdoms are indeed
active 2OG-dependent dioxygenase enzymes. This might
not be true for other members of the JmjC/DSBH fold
superfamily of proteins. For example, the subfamily of
JFP6-like proteins has a substitution in the Fe(II) coordinating residues changing the Fe(II) binding motif. Furthermore, hairless and Jarid2 proteins are most likely
enzymatically inactive due to the missing HxD motifs in
their DSBH protein cores [4]. This suggests that JmjC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

domains might possess additional functions that are independent of any enzymatic activity.
2OG-dependent dioxygenases are known to catalyse two
types of posttranslational protein modifications.
Described have been hydroxylation of the amino acid side
chains of proline, asparagines, aspartic acid and tryptophan, and secondly demethylation reactions on lysine
residues (for review see [6,81]). It has been proposed that
also methylated arginines might be targets of JmjC
domain containing proteins. In fact, most recently it has
been suggested that Jmjd6 might possess an enzymatic
activity as an arginine histone demethylase. It was
reported that Jmjd6 is capable to catalyse the removal of
di-methyl groups on histone H3 at arginine 2 (H3R2) and
on histone 4 at arginine 3 (H4R3) [86]. Asymmetric dimethylation of H3R2 has been associated with repression
of transcriptional activity through its enrichment in heterochromatic loci and inactive euchromatic genes [87,88].
Thus, Jmjd6 might have a function in gene activation by
erasing repressive chromatin marks. But it is also not
unlikely that additional, non-histone substrates are targeted by Jmjd6.
All types of posttranslational modifications catalysed by
2OG-dependent dioxygenases involve a common type of
hydroxylation reaction. During the catalytic reaction, the
splitting of molecular oxygen is coupled to the hydroxylation of the target substrate and the oxidative decarboxylation of 2OG to give succinate and CO2. In the case of
demethylation, hydroxylation of a methyl group is followed immediately by deformylation producing formaldehyde as an additional reaction product. As noted before
by others, it is impossible to predict the prime substrate of
2OG-dependent dioxygenase based on a primary
sequence analysis of the JmjC domain [80,81]. Even JmjC
domain containing enzymes of the same subfamily such
as the JHDM1A and the JHDM2A histone demethylases
that both recognise H3K36 methylation have very limited
primary or secondary structure similarity [22]. This suggests a requirement for an extended substrate recognition
mechanism that probably involves protein-protein interactions in larger protein complexes or for a necessity of
very defined interaction sites in the catalytic core that are
important for determining substrate selectivity [89]. This
is further supported by a number of recent studies that
implicated other methyl-dependent protein domains like
Tudor, MBT, PHD fingers and chromo domains as reader
domains in the recognition of the histone code [90-94].
Jmjd6 contains a single JmjC domain and beside the predicted recognition sequences for nuclear in- and export,
sumoylation and the AT-hook DNA-binding motif no
other recognisable domain is present in the protein. Thus,
the substrate specificity of Jmjd6 must be regulated by
interaction with other proteins.

What is quite clear is that the putative enzymatic function
of Jmjd6 as a 2OG-dependent dioxygenase is linked to its
important role in development and morphogenesis, at
least in vertebrates. All mouse mutants conclusively point
to an essential role of Jmjd6 during embryogenesis were
the gene is involved in the differentiation of multiple tissues and organs. Also in zebrafish, the morpholino knockdown of the jmjd6 orthologue resulted in severe defects in
somite, brain, heart and notochord development [95].
This may or may not involve secondary effects on apoptosis induction and cell corpse clearance. Unlikely is a direct
involvement of jmjd6 in apoptotic cell recognition or
engulfment. Given that many 2OG-dependent dioxygenases have been implicated in the regulation of multiple
pathways, global effects on gene expression and metabolism are not surprising when their enzymatic functions get
perturbed or ablated.
The function of Jmjd6 during development seems to be
different in vertebrates and invertebrates. Inactivation of
the orthologous genes in Drosophila and C. elegans were
surprisingly not associated with embryonic lethality and
no major developmental defects have been reported for
the loss-of-function mutants [59,96]. Interestingly,
mutant flies that lack dPSR show inappropriate apoptosis
during eye development [59]. Major phenotypes were
observed in gain-of-function experiments in which the
dPSR gene was overexpressed during development. Male
transgenic flies that expressed dPSR under ubiquitous promoters developed a genital rotation phenotype. dPSR
overexpression in the wing resulted in various wing blade
fusion phenotypes and driving gene expression in the eye
induced a small rough eye phenotype. Further genetic
analysis pointed to an involvement of dPSR in the head
involution defective (hid) and c-Jun-NH2 terminal kinase
pathways. These suggested that loss of dPSR enhances
apoptosis in the developing eye, while overexpression of
dPSR protects from apoptosis. Of note, the analysis of
mutant flies did not reveal a role for dPSR in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells during development. Altogether,
these observations support a function of dPSR in cell survival and differentiation that might have parallels in the
vertebrate system [59].
When we compared the protein sequences of vertebrate
and invertebrate orthologous Jmjd6 proteins we found
divergence in the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Interestingly, the C-terminal poly-serine stretch is
either shorter or missing in the invertebrate species. Moreover, we could not identify an additional exon in the
invertebrate orthologous Jmjd6 genes that would generate
alternative transcripts with effects on the C-terminal part
of the protein. Therefore, it could well be that differences
in this region of the protein are linked in vertebrates with
different physiological functions of Jmjd6 protein, possi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

bly through interactions with other proteins. This is also
supported by identification of proteins in plants, fungi
and protista that show partial sequence homology to the
animalia Jmjd6 protein (Figure 5 and [see Additional file
4]). These were identified through sequence search routines focussing on a conserved N-terminal sequence
stretch outside of the highly conserved JmjC domain.
Consequently, these proteins show in their N-terminal
parts significant sequence homology to the mouse Jmjd6
protein, but are diverse to Jmjd6 in their C-terminal
regions. Moreover, many of these proteins are longer then
the animalia Jmjd6 proteins (up to 2.000 aa instead of
around 400 aa for animalia Jmjd6 proteins) and contain
often in addition to the JmjC domain a single F-box
domain.
Thus, it is very likely that they possess different or additional functions than the animalia Jmjd6 proteins and a
possible homology of these proteins to Jmjd6 should be
treated with caution. As the reciprocal high similarity suggests a relation to Jmjd6, it might be possible to postulate
an ancestral "Jmjd6" gene that encoded a larger protein
with additional domains (like F-box domains), which
then have been lost during evolution of Jmd6 genes in animalia. Alternatively, the evolution of Jmjd6 genes in animalia could have been an independent event and these
genes are not related in any way to the proteins we identified in plants, fungi and protista. In the future it might be
possible to consolidate on one hypothesis, given that
more functional data about these hypothetical proteins
are being gathered and higher quality sequence information becomes available for phylogenetic analysis.

Conclusion
Taken together, our integrated bioinformatic analysis provided new insights into possible structure-function relationships of Jmjd6 proteins and on the evolution of the
whole superfamily of DSBH/JmjC domain containing
proteins. Of note, the observations made on the protein
model are not experimentally proven at the current state
and await confirmation when the crystallographic structure of Jmjd6 has been obtained. In addition, we provide
first evidence for a counteracting transcriptional regulative
mechanism involving the co-localised Jmjd6 and
1110005A03Rik genes.

Methods
Bioinformatic approaches
To investigate the splice variants of Jmjd6, the genomic
sequence of Jmjd6 and adjacent genes on either side was
extracted to perform an unrestricted e2g-based annotation
of mouse ESTs with a seed-length of 18 and a minimum
identity of 95% [67]. The resulting list of ESTs that overlap
with the known Jmjd6 coding-region was passed on to a
self-developed script that automatically retrieves the

Page 20 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:293

sequences of all matches and performs an in-depth verification of each EST using Sim4 [68]. The script sorts
matches in different groups, according to the match quality. All matches with unidirectional splice sites, without
internal gaps in the mRNA, and a <95% identity score to
the corresponding genomic regions leaving aside the polyA tail were used for manual annotation.
PipMaker sequence analysis [66] was done by extracting
genomic sequences of 50 to 100 kb encompassing the
Jmjd6 locus and neighbouring loci of mouse, human,
bovine, armadillo, opossum, zebrafish, chicken, western
clawed frog and puffer fish. Sequences were analysed by
RepeatMasker [97] and positions of all coding sequences/
exons in Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik, and Sfrs2 were identified
and annotated using the BLAST algorithm. The masked
and annotated mouse sequence were then finally used for
interspecies pairwise alignment with the sequences from
the different species mentioned above using the program
PipMaker [66].
To identify Jmjd6 orthologous sequences, a standard NCBI
blastp-search against the nr database using amino acids
52–152 of the murine Jmjd6 protein was performed [98].
Identified sequences were validated using the "reciprocal
best BLAST hit" criterion in a Mus musculus-restricted
blastp-search against the nr database [72].
SMART-parser, a Perl-script for batch queries against
SMART [99], data retrieval and processing was developed
to identify proteins with similar domains as Jmjd6.
SMART and SMART-parser were used to automatically
identify, extract and annotate the sequences of all JmjC-,
Pfam-JmjC, Blast-JmjC-, P4Hc-, Pfam-2OG-FeII-Oxy- and
Pfam-PhyH-domains for later processing. These domain
names have been used in the different public databases to
indicate the presence of the JmjC domain containing
DSBH fold proteins.
Multiple sequence alignments were generated employing
ClustalW with a default setup and five iterations of realignment. Visualisation, calculation of a background frequency corrected sequence logo, and calculation of amino
acid conservation was done using LaTeX and TEXshade
[100]. A ClustalW alignment of all Jmjd6 orthologues
(amino acids 44–329) identified in the prior approaches
was used to generate a 3D-structure of Jmjd6 using the
pipeline from the MPI Toolkit [101]. To add 2OG and
Fe(II) to the predicted structure and the predicted active
site of Jmjd6, an iterative backbone annealing of the
Hif1an structure (1h2k) on top of the Jmjd6 model was
performed using the SwissPDB Viewer [102]. Afterwards,
the coordinates of 2OG and Fe(II) were added to the
Jmjd6 model and energies were minimised using Deep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/293

View. 3D representations of molecules were rendered
using PyMOL [103].
For a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of Jmjd6
orthologues, we employed the PHYLIP toolbox [104]. A
ClustalW alignment of all proteins with significant
homology to Jmjd6 was used as an input for ProML, using
the Jones-Taylor-Thornton algorithm with an estimated
constant rate of mutations, global rearrangements and the
more accurate iterated branch lengths option. The primary protein sequences of Jmjd6/JMJD6 were analysed
for sumoylation sites using a SUMOplot prediction with a
cutt-off of 90% probability [105]. Nuclear export signals
(NES) were identified using the NetNES 1.1 server using a
cut-off of 95% identity to the NES Hidden Markow Model
in the database [106]. Secondary structure predictions
were generated using the Jpred web service [107].
Identification of Jmjd6 splice variants
RNA was isolated from different cells (HEK 293-T, A549,
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and reverse transcribed. Murine splice variants were amplified using the
forward primer 5'-GGTGGTGCCTCTTCCCAACAAA-3'
and the reverse primers 5'-TCCAGGTCAGGGTTGGGACAC-3' and 5'-AGCTAGAAGAGTCGCTGGAGCTGTC-3'. The amplicons of the primer pairs had a product
size of 363 bp (Mm3), 407 bp (Mm2), and 432 bp
(Mm1), respectively. All fragments were analysed by
sequencing and the sequences were submitted to GenBank (Acc. No. EF527404 and EF527405). Human cDNAs
(C1244142, C1244152, C1244171-10, C1244035-10,
C1244149, C1244264-10, C1244183, C1244246-10,
C1244122-10, C1244260-10) were obtained from the
BioChain Institute (Hayward, USA) and amplified according to the manufactures instructions using the forward
primer
5'-GGGAACTCATCAAAGTGACCCGAGACG-3'
and the reverse primers 5'-ACTGCCGCTGCCCGTGCTGTATC-3' and 5'-CGAGTCTGCGAGGACTGCCAACTCG-3'.
The amplicons had a product size of 320 bp (Hs2), 344 bp
(Hs1) and 438 bp (Hs3), respectively. All fragments were
analysed by sequencing and the sequences were submitted to GenBank (Acc. No. EF527406 and EF527407).
Expression analysis of Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik and Sfrs2
RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed. Expression of
Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik, Sfrs2 in embryos or cells were analysed using the primers 5'-GTT CCA GCT CGT CAG ACT

Jmjd6, 5'-GCC ACC ACA AGA CAT CAT TCT TG-3' and 5'TCA GAT AAT TCA GCT TTA TGC CAG G-3' for

Analysis of the bidirectional transcriptional unit
An 841 bp and an 840 bp fragment was amplified from
mouse C57BL/6J genomic DNA using the forward 5'-CTCGAGCTCTCGTAGTAGTTGTGCCGGGT-3' and reverse 5'GCTAGCACTGTCCCTAAATGTGTCACTGGAGC-3'
primer as well as the forward 3'-GCTAGCTCTCGTAGTAGTTGTGCCGGGT-5' and reverse 5'-CTCGAGACTGTCCCTAAATGTGTCACTGGAGC-3' primer, respectively.
These fragments were integrated into a promoter-less luciferase expression vector (pGL3, Promega, Madison, USA)
and these constructs were introduced into HEK 293-T
cells, A549 cells or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
using Nanofection (PAA, Pasching, Austria). After 24h of
cultivation at 37°C and 5% CO2, cell extracts were generated to measure the luciferase-activity using the DualLuciferase-Reporter-Assay System (Promega) according to
the manufactures instructions. The obtained results were
normalized to pGL4.74 (Promega) luciferase-activity. The
measurements were performed in triplicate and repeated
at least three times.

Authors' contributions
PH and JB designed the computational pipeline flow
together. The domain based multiple sequence alignment
analysis of all protein sequences, the phylogeny prediction there from and the PipMaker sequence analysis as
well as the analysis of the different mouse mutant Jmjd6
alleles was carried out by JB. PH contributed the fulllength Jmjd6 analysis, 3D structure prediction and developed the new method for conservation based residue
shading. Furthermore, PH identified and validated new
splice variants of Jmjd6, characterised the bi-directional
Jmjd6 transcriptional unit and developed SMART-parser
as well as additional Perl scripts for automated data
processing. SE carried out parts of the Jmjd6 expression
analysis. AL coordinated the study and wrote the paper.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Absence of nonsense-mediated decay in Jmjd6 splice variants. Two additional putative exons (green boxes) were identified (A). Alternative splicing using these two exons results in the generation of two additional
transcripts of Jmjd6 (variants 2 and 3, respectively). Half arrows and
orange lines in the schematic presentation of the transcripts highlight the
combination of exons detected by RT-PCR in (B) and (C). Primers were
designed to bind to the respective exons shown. (B) Experimental validation of the two new predicted alternative Jmjd6 transcripts using RT-PCR
and agarose gel electrophoresis. Expression analyses confirmed that both
splice variants are not subject to nonsense-mediated decay in adult mouse
organs and (C) human tissues. Amplification of the housekeeping β-actin
gene was used as a RNA loading control.

Comparison of strategies used to inactivate the Jmjd6 gene in mouse EScells. Schematic representation of the mouse locus according to the
Ensembl annotation of the Jmjd6 gene and its neighbouring genes (A).
Arrows indicate transcriptional orientation of the genes along chromosome
11, from centromer to telomer. Jmjd6 exons are shown in green, exons of
1110005A03Rik in blue, and of Sfrs2 in yellow. Individual exons are
numbered. The strategies used to generate the different targeted knock out
alleles are shown. Red boxes indicate gene regions deleted by homologous
recombination. The Jmjd6tm1Flv allele was generated by replacing an
AatII/SpeI fragment by a neomycin resistance cassette. In the
Jmjd6tm1Ysfk allele the EcoRI fragment and in the Jmjd6tm1Gbf allele the
AatII/RsrII fragment were replaced respectively. Based on these chosen
fragments, targeted inactivation of Jmjd6 seems to affect in two of the
three alleles the neighbouring 1110005A03Rik locus. (B) RT-PCR analysis of the expression of the Jmjd6, 1110005A03Rik (Rik) and Sfrs2
genes in Jmjd6 wild type and Jmjd6 homozygous mutant embryos. The
expression of 1110005A03Rik is not detectable in the Jmjd6tm1Flv allele
and in the Jmjd6tm1Ysfk allele, whereas expression of Sfrs2 is unaltered in
all three mouse lines investigated (C) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis
of 1110005A03Rik expression in Jmjd6tm1Gbf wild type and homozygous
mutant embryos (embryonic stage E13.5) and in fetal-liver derived macrophages shows that the level of expression is not altered due to the targeted inactivation of the Jmjd6 gene in this mouse line. RT-PCR
expression analysis was performed in differential dilution steps of cDNA
material (1, 1:10, 1:100). In all RT-PCR expression experiments amplification of the housekeeping gene β-actin severed as loading control.

Phylogenetic relationship of Jmjd6 to the superfamily of JmjC-domain
containing proteins. In total 313 sequences of DSBH/JmjC domain containing proteins from humans and model organisms (mouse, zebrafish,
pufferfish, nematode, fruit fly, and yeast) were analysed for their relationship to different subgroups of JmjC domain containing proteins. JmjC
domain sequences of the proteins were analysed by multiple sequence
alignment and subsequent bootstrap analysis using ClustalW (1000 bootstrap trials, 111 seeds) and PHYLIP (ProML). The resulting unrouted
tree based on sequence similarity within the JmjC domain revealed 25 evolutionary conserved protein subgroups. These are highlighted in different
colours according to the colour code on the left side. Five proteins that
could not be grouped into subgroups are indicated in red letters. H.s. =
