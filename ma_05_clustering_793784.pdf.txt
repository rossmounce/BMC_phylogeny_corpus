Abstract
Background: The sequencing of the human genome has enabled us to access a comprehensive list
of genes (both experimental and predicted) for further analysis. While a majority of the
approximately 30000 known and predicted human coding genes are characterized and have been
assigned at least one function, there remains a fair number of genes (about 12000) for which no
annotation has been made. The recent sequencing of other genomes has provided us with a huge
amount of auxiliary sequence data which could help in the characterization of the human genes.
Clustering these sequences into families is one of the first steps to perform comparative studies
across several genomes.
Results: Here we report a novel clustering algorithm (CLUGEN) that has been used to cluster
sequences of experimentally verified and predicted proteins from all sequenced genomes using a
novel distance metric which is a neural network score between a pair of protein sequences. This
distance metric is based on the pairwise sequence similarity score and the similarity between their
domain structures. The distance metric is the probability that a pair of protein sequences are of
the same Interpro family/domain, which facilitates the modelling of transitive homology closure to
detect remote homologues. The hierarchical average clustering method is applied with the new
distance metric.
Conclusion: Benchmarking studies of our algorithm versus those reported in the literature shows
that our algorithm provides clustering results with lower false positive and false negative rates. The
clustering algorithm is applied to cluster several eukaryotic genomes and several dozens of
prokaryotic genomes.

Background
Clustering of protein sequences from different organisms
has been used to identify orthologous and paralogous
protein sequences, to find protein sequences unique to an

organism, and to derive the phylogenetic profile for a cluster of protein sequences. These are some of the essential
components of a comparative genomics study of protein
sequences across several genomes.

Figure 1
The schematic view of family-based clustering
The schematic view of family-based clustering. Figure 1 illustrates a typical example of the clustering of three protein
families denoted by the three oval outlines. Family I consists of protein sequences 1 and 2. Family II consists of protein
sequences 3, 4, and 5. Family III consists of protein sequence 6 and 7. Domain A is common to families 1 and 2 while Domain B
is common to families 2 and 3.

The methods of clustering protein sequences can be either
domain-based or family-based. All the clustering methods
start with an all-against-all pairwise protein sequence similarity search. The domain-based clustering methods
organize the protein sequence universe into domain clusters where domains are the structural units of proteins,
e.g., COG [1], ProDom [2], and Picasso [3] (Figure 1). A
multidomain protein may belong to multiple domain
clusters.
Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) find triangles of
mutually consistent genome-specific best hits from distant organisms without specifying a fixed similarity cutoff, thus accommodating both fast evolving and slow

evolving genes. It then merges triangles which share a
common edge. Each COG cluster is further analyzed manually to eliminate false positives caused by multidomain
proteins so that each COG cluster represents a domain.
ProDom is based on the assumption that short protein
sequences are single domain proteins. It first sorts all the
protein sequences according to their lengths. It then
undergoes a repetitive process: during each iteration, ProDom chooses as the query sequence the current shortest
protein sequence or its internal repeat unit if it has internal repeats, searches the whole protein sequence set with
PSI-BLAST [4], builds the sequence profile, and masks segments covered by the sequence profile for multidomain

proteins or removes the single domain proteins completely covered by the sequence profile. The process iterates until there is no sequence left in the protein sequence
set.
Picasso merges pairwise sequence alignments from the
initial all-against-all pairwise sequence similarity searches
into multiple sequence alignments of closer homologs,
and later hierarchically merges these multiple sequence
alignments into representative sequence profiles of
remote homologs by profile-profile comparisons. The
representative sequence profiles may contain sequences of
different domain structures, but share at least one
domain. Picasso then cuts domains within the representative sequence profiles into individual domain clusters
based on the concept of overlapping maximal clusters
proposed in SYSTERS [5]. Maximal clusters are clusters
not fully contained in any other clusters. Two maximal
clusters may have not only the overlapping set of neighbour members but also the unique set of neighbour members to these two maximal clusters. Thus these two
overlapping maximal clusters must be of different domain
structures sharing at least one domain which corresponds
to the overlapping set of neighbour members. Then these
two overlapping maximal clusters must undergo domaincutting to be split into individual domains corresponding
to closed neighbours, where no member has any neighbour outside of the cluster, from multiple alignments.
However, since it is still a challenging problem to precisely pinpoint the structure domain border based on primary sequence information [6,7], the performance of the
clustering algorithm will be determined by the accuracy of
domain demarcations.
Family-based clustering methods group protein sequences
into families, which contain a group of evolutionarily
related proteins that share similar domain architecture
(see Figure 1), e.g., CluSTr [8], SYSTERS, ProClust[9,10],
PROTONET [11]/ProtoMap [12], and MCL[13]. CluSTr
clusters protein sequence with the single linkage algorithm using the Z-score as the metric.
SYSTERS uses each protein sequence in the dataset as a
seed sequence and applies the single linkage algorithm
with a stringent threshold. Thus, each seed sequence has a
cluster associated with it. It then merges all the clusters to
maximal clusters. The maximal clusters could be either
separate maximal clusters corresponding to single domain
protein clusters or overlapping maximal clusters representing clusters having multiple domains, but sharing at
least one domain.
ProClust uses a different metric to detect whether the
aligned two proteins have similar domain structures. The
metric value, which scales from 0 to 1, is the ratio of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/242

raw score of the sequence alignments to the raw score of
one of those two sequences aligned to itself. Thus the metric value between two sequences is directional. It assumes
that the metric is symmetric if two aligned sequences have
similar domain structure and non-symmetric otherwise. It
then represents each sequence as a vertex and represents
the metric value above the threshold as a directional edge
in a directed graph. Each strongly connected component
corresponds to a cluster [9]. It was later improved by
building Profile-HMMs for all clusters having more than
20 sequences and merging two clusters A and B into a cluster corresponding to a SCOP superfamily if the average Evalue from searching all the sequences in the cluster A
against the profile-HMM of the cluster B is below the
threshold[10].
PROTONET applies the hierarchical clustering of protein
sequences based on the their pairwise similarity E-values,
but adopts different rules for merging clusters: arithmetic
mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean. However,
different families may have different levels of sequence
conservation. It is not appropriate to choose one E-value
threshold. And at the level of higher E-value, it may merge
two clusters of different domain structures, but sharing
one domain. However, different families may have different levels of sequence conservation. It is not appropriate
to choose one E-value threshold. And at the level of higher
E-value, it may merge two clusters of different domain
structures, but sharing one domain.
Transitive homology detection methods have been proposed in the Intermediate Sequence Search, ISS [14,15],
and [16]. It works by searching the query sequence against
the database with a conservative threshold to find the
closely homologous sequences and using these homologous sequences as seeds to search the database to find
remotely homologous sequences with a less conservative
threshold. The method has been shown to be close to the
profile based methods and better than a direct pairwise
homology search [17]. But, it is a challenge to quantify the
indirect, transitive homology as opposed to using the Evalue for quantifying direct pairwise sequence homology.
The Markov cluster (MCL) [13] algorithm has been successfully applied to clustering protein sequences. MCL
represents protein sequences as nodes on a graph where
similar proteins are connected by edges weighted according to their BLASP E-Value. The MCL algorithm works
through a series of iterative random walks across the
graph and inflations of the edge weights that gradually
strengthens the connections between very similar nodes
and weakens the connections between less similar nodes.
MCL makes no explicit use of protein domain architecture
but does leverage transitive homologies in the random
walk phase of the algorithm.

shows the distribution of InterPro family size. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the InterPro families used in the benchmarking dataset based upon the number of members in each family. There are 102 singleton InterPro families, and the largest
InterPro family in the benchmarking dataset is Rhodopsin-like GPCR superfamily which has 1058 protein sequences in the
benchmarking dataset.

Compared to the hierarchical clustering family based clustering method, e.g., PROTONET [11], our method can
take advantage of the transitive homologue closure by the
third intermediate sequence to detect remote homologues
at the superfamily level. Compared to single linkage based
methods, e.g., CluSTr [8], our method avoids the problem
of merging two unrelated multi-domain cluster sharing a
common domain. Compared to the iterative clustering
method, e.g., SYSTERS [5], our method generates clusters
where each sequence belongs to only one cluster.

Results and discussion
Benchmarking
In order to test the performance of CLUGEN, we selected
all Swissprot [18] sequences with an InterPro [19] annotation, which resulted in 41480 sequences from 1598
InterPro families. The criteria we used to select sequences
are that more than one member database from the InterPro annotation have the same superfamily or domain
assignment and that the aligned region of the Swissprot
sequence with respect to either Profile or hidden Markov

model is longer than 30 amino acids. The benchmarking
dataset is available on request. Figure 2 shows the InterPro
superfamily/domain size distribution in the benchmarking dataset. There are 102 singleton families, that is families that consist of only one sequence. The largest family is
IPR000276, the Rhodopsin-like G-Protein Coupled
Receptor (GPCR) family which comprised of 1058 protein sequences.
Performance measure
We measure CLUGEN's performance by sensitivity, specificity, and goodness. A protein sequence is a false positive
(FP) if it is misclassified to a certain InterPro superfamily/
domain and a true positive (TP) otherwise. A protein
sequence in a certain InterPro superfamily/domain is a
false negative (FN) if it is not classified to that InterPro
superfamily/domain (Figure 3). Let Nfp and Ntp denote the
number of false positives and the number of true positives
with respect to a cluster. Let N fn denote the number of
false negatives with respect to a InterPro superfamily/
domain.

Definition of various clustering parameters
Definition of various clustering parameters. Figure 3 illustrates the mapping of three generated clusters denoted by oval
outlines differentiated by different colors into a InterPro family denoted by a rectangle. The cluster can be mapped to an InterPro family only if more than 50% cluster members belong to that InterPro family; and is declared as a orphan cluster otherwise.
Protein sequences outside the rectangle are false positives. Protein sequences within both the oval outline and the rectangle
are true positives. Protein sequences wholly within the grey rectangle are false negatives.

Specificity: The specificity of a cluster is defined as Ntp /
(Ntp + Nfp).
Sensitivity: The sensitivity of an InterPro superfamily/
domain is defined as Ntp / (Ntp + Nfn ).
Goodness: The goodness of an InterPro superfamily/
domain is a measure of how well a cluster corresponds to
the mapped InterPro superfamily/domain and is defined
below (Equation 1) where N denotes the number of generated clusters associated with that InterPro superfamily/
domain. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) has been
shown to be a better evaluation measure than accuracy
within the context of binary classification, where the negative dataset is clearly defined. However, we cluster protein
sequences
into
1598
interpro
families
simultaneously. As a result, using the AUC as a measure of
performance is not the appropriate metric here. Instead,

we adopt as the "goodness " the set relative measure as
defined in [12]. In order to decrease the goodness value
when a large number of clusters is associated with an
InterPro superfamily/domain, a penalty of (N-1) is
applied in the numerator of the equation.
Ideally specificity, sensitivity, and goodness should be 100%.

Specificity, sensitivity, and goodness on the benchmarking
Specificity, sensitivity, and goodness on the benchmarking dataset. Sensitivity and specificity for CLUGEN
and MCL at various specificities. At higher specificities, the
sensitivity of both methods increases, whereas the goodness
of both methods decreases. This is expected because higher
specificities are achieved via stricter parameter thresholds
that more clusters overall and fewer large clusters. Performance for both methods is comparable in this range with CLUGEN performing better at lower specificities and MCL
performing better at higher specificities.

Overall performance
We evaluated CLUGEN at several threshold values. Table
1 lists shows the specificity, sensitivity, and goodness as
well as the number of generated clusters and the number
of orphan clusters as a function of the different threshold

values respectively. A cluster can be mapped to an InterPro
family only if more than 50% of the cluster members
belong to that InterPro family; and is declared as an
orphan cluster otherwise. At one extreme of the spectrum,
each cluster is a singleton cluster consisting of only one
protein sequence. Thus both specificity and sensitivity are
100%. But the goodness value is very low, the reciprocal
of the size of the family. Clustering based on more stringent threshold values, e.g. 0.5, generates a larger number
of smaller clusters causing a smaller number of false positives, also resulting in a low goodness value. As the
threshold values become less stringent, small clusters
merge at different levels into larger clusters, therefore a
smaller number of larger clusters are generated. At the
threshold of 0.2, there are 1706 clusters resulting in a specificity of 97.1%, sensitivity 98.6%, goodness value of
78.2%, and the number of orphan clusters is 201. As can
be seen from table 1, the threshold value is a compromise
of sensitivity, specificity, goodness and the number of
orphan clusters. Ideally, we would like the clustering
results to produce as many clusters as there should be and
as few orphan clusters as possible.
For a basis of comparison we also applied the MCL [13]
algorithm to the same test dataset with various inflation
values. Results are depicted in Figures 4 and 5. At higher
specificities, the sensitivity of both methods increases.
This is expected because higher specificities are achieved
via stricter thresholds that result in more clusters overall
and fewer large clusters. In the extreme case one could
place each test sequence in its own cluster of size 1 and
achieve 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity but with a
low goodness score. This trade-off between sensitivity,
specificity, and goodness is clearly evident in Figure 4; as
specificity increases, sensitivity increases whereas goodness decreases.
In Figure 5 we see additional tradeoffs between specificity
and overall performance. As specificity increases the
number of orphan clusters decreases. This improvement
in performance comes with an increase in the total

cific InterPro families, some clusters which have false positives, and some which have false negatives.
As previously outlined, 41480 sequences with Interpro
superfamily annotation (1598 clusters) were clustered
using our algorithm. This results in a total of 1972 clusters. Overall, there are 1199 clusters that have been correctly mapped with one-to-one correspondence to 1199
out of 1598 InterPro superfamilies /domains. There are 79
orphan clusters. Some correctly clustered large protein
superfamily/domain examples are: 507 Cytochrome P450
proteins are correctly clustered into family IPR001128
without false positives and false negatives; 398 large chain
ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase proteins are correctly
clustered into family IPR000685 without false positives
and false negatives; 290 short-chain dehydrogenase/
reductase SDR proteins are clustered into family
IPR002198 without false positives and false negatives.

number of clusters. Once again the extreme case of one
sequence per cluster guarantees no orphan clusters at the
cost of many non-informative clusters. Ideally one wishes
to strike a balance reducing the number of orphan clusters
while not drastically increasing the total number of
clusters.
The overall performances of MCL and CLUGEN are fairly
similar, with CLUGEN demonstrating a clear advantage at
specificities below 0.98. CLUGEN's sensitivity and
goodness are better at specificities below 0.98, whereas
MCL's goodness is slightly better at specificities greater
than 0.98. The number of total clusters and orphan clusters generated by both methods are comparable at specificities below 0.98. CLUGEN tends toward fewer orphan
clusters at the cost of more total clusters at higher
specificities.
Analysis of some CLUGEN generated clusters
In this section, we will give examples of some successfully
generated clusters with one-to-one correspondence to spe-

We also conducted a detailed analysis of clusters that had
false negatives/false positives in order to understand the
areas in which the clustering algorithm could be further
improved. The following is a description of errors encountered in clustering algorithms with specific reference to the
data from our method.
Errors from low-complexity and coiled-coil regions
The first type of error is due to the presence of low complexity sequences with repetitive sequence patterns or
sequences with coiled-coil structures, since we mask the
low complexity regions and coiled-coil regions before the
all-against-all pairwise similarity searches. As an example,
the InterPro family IPR000533, Tropomyosins, which regulate muscle contraction, are alpha-helical proteins that
form a coiled-coil. There are 25 tropomyosin sequences in
the benchmarking dataset, among which 24 tropomyosin
sequences are false negative sequences and appear in the
following cluster along with members of IPR002699 ATP
synthase subunit D.
Errors from short sequences or from an abundance of certain amino
acid type in the sequences
Short sequences with less than 70 amino acids could also
cause false positives in the clustering results. Cluster 1259
which is mapped to InterPro family 003019, the metallothionein superfamily, consists of 125 short protein
sequences with 68 amino acids on average in length
among which 34 false positive protein sequences are from
InterPro family IPR001762, Disintegrin, and 34 false positive protein sequences are from InterPro family
IPR000877, Bowman-Birk serine protease inhibitor. The
reason these families cluster together is that

Page 7 of 13

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:242

metallothioneins are small proteins with high content of
cysteine residues, while disintegrins and Bowman-Birk
serine protease inhibitors are also short cysteine-rich protein sequences. This suggests that a more stringent threshold should be applied to cluster short protein sequences
which are rich in a particular amino acid.
Similar domain structures in different superfamilies
Sequences that belong to different superfamilies but share
similar domain structures may also cluster incorrectly in
some cases. For example, 1039 out of 1058 sequences correctly cluster into the IPR000276 Rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptors family. But 17 out of 19 sequences
from the IPR000276 Rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled
receptors which have Cysteine-rich N-terminal regions are
mistakenly clustered into the InterPro 000372 which is
annotated as a cysteine-rich flanking region N-terminal.
Similarly, members of the IPR001878 CCHC Zinc finger
domain have been incorrectly clustered into the cluster
1008 which is mapped to the InterPro family 000981
Neurohypophysical hormone because they share the two
cysteine residues and other surrounding weak motifs.

Conclusion
This paper describes a novel method for the clustering of
protein sequences based on a new metric derived from
prediction using neural networks and further utilizing the
metric to model the transitive sequence homologue to
detect the remote homologue. Good performance with
respect to the InterPro protein sequence database has
been achieved on the benchmarking dataset.
Clustering of sequences has many applications in target
discovery and gene functionalization. One can identify in
silico, antimicrobial drug targets by examining clusters
without any eukaryotic member sequence in it. These proteins could be potentially selective targets for infectious
diseases due to the absence of any appreciable homolog in
the human proteome. Such computationally derived targets need to be further validated using experimental data
derived from gene expression profiling and proteomics
experiments [20]. Another application is to predict the
function for prokaryotic proteins of unknown function by
phylogenetic profiling [21], where the phylogenetic profile for a cluster is a vector of binary values, with 1 meaning the presence of a genome in that cluster and 0
otherwise. The assumption here is that genes with the
same phylogenetic profile could have the same function.

Method
Feature extraction
After we mask the low complexity regions and the coiledcoil regions and carry out the all-against-all pairwise
sequence similarity searches, we extract four sets of features to represent the homology between any given pair of

sequences. The first two sets of input features detect the
homology of two aligned sequences, the last two sets of
input features test whether two aligned sequences have
similar domain structures. We use neural networks to map
input features to a new metric, a probability value which
scales from 0 to 1 and is interpreted as the likelihood that
two sequences are of the same homologous superfamily.
The first input feature is the log scale of the pairwise Evalue.
The raw score, from which the E-value of the two aligned
sequences is derived, is calculated by summing up the log
score of each position in the alignment, which assumes
that each position is independent of the other. However,
in practice, it has been shown that two consecutive
positions in the alignments are quite correlated [22]. To
model the correlation between two consecutive positions
in the alignment, we adopt the concept of the 2-gram
encoding method [23]. Ideally, hydrophobic regions of
one sequence should align with the hydrophobic regions
of the other sequence, and hydrophilic regions should
align with each other as well. Each position in the
alignment could fall into one of four categories: residue
identity denoted by A1, hydrophobic similarity denoted
by A2, hydrophilic similarity denoted by A3, and everything else denoted by A4. Let Lena denote the total length
of the alignment and Occuri,j denote the number of occurrences of i and j, where i is immediately followed by j, with
i and j denoting any one of A1, A2, A3, or A4 respectively.
Let freqi,j denote frequency of i,j, which is equal to Occuri,j/
(Lena-1). Thus the second set of input features consists of
freqi,j values of the alignment positions, which consists of
16 input feature values for a pair of aligned sequences

since each of the two consecutive positions could be one
of four possible values.
Each of the two aligned sequences is separated into three
segments, the unaligned N-terminal region, the aligned
region, and the unaligned C-terminal region, by the
beginning position of the alignment, denoted by begini,
and the end position of the alignment, denoted by endi
with respect to sequencei (Figure 6). Let Leni denote the
length of sequencei. Then lengths of three segments of
sequencei are begini -1, endi - begini +1, and Leni - endi, respectively. If we normalize the length of each of three segments within an aligned sequencei by dividing the length
of each segment by Leni, we get a vector of three values,
Segi1 = (begini-1)/Leni, Segi2 = (endi - begini +1)/Leni, and
Segi3 = (Leni - endi)/Leni. Intuitively, if the two aligned
sequences have similar domain structures, the alignment
will divide the two aligned sequences i and j in a similar
proportion, and the linear correlation coefficient, LCC1
defined by Equation 2, between these two vectors tend to
be close to 1. So the third set of input features include
LCC1, Segi1, Segi2, Segi3, Segj1, Segj2, and Segj3.

Figure 7
The architecture of the neural network
The architecture of the neural network. Figure 7 demonstrates the architecture of the neural network. The neural
network is actually fully connected, but not shown in the figure for simplicity, and has three layers. The first layer is the
input layer consisting of 25 input features. The hidden layer
in the middle has 4 nodes. The output layer has one output
node.

have, the more similar neighbor sets they will have, and
the closer to 1 the linear correlation coefficient will be.
Equation 3:

∑ (Seg jk − 3)2
3 k =1

The fourth and final input feature is to measure the overlap between two neighbor sets of aligned sequences,
where the neighbor set, Seti of sequencei, is defined as the
set of protein sequences that sequencei hits when sequencei
is used as the query sequence. One straightforward
method to measure the overlap is to use the ratio of the
cardinality of the intersection of two neighbor sets to the
cardinality of the union of two neighbor sets.
Here we propose another method to measure the overlap.
Specifically, if we represent the neighbor set of sequencei as
Vectori, the value of the kth element of Vectori is the log Evalue, Logik between sequencei and its kth neighbor in Seti.
However, Vectori and Vectorj for two aligned sequences,
sequencei and sequencej, may be of different dimensions
since the cardinalities of Seti and Setj may be different. We
make these two vectors have the same dimension by adding the log E-value threshold to Vectori whenever the
sequencei has no corresponding neighbor in the neighbor
set, Setj of the other aligned sequencej. Thus the last input
feature is the linear correlation coefficient LCC2 between
Vectori and Vectorj defined by Equation 3. Intuitively, the
more similar the domain structure two aligned sequences

LCC2 =

1 N
∑ (Logik − Logi )(Log jk − Log j )
N k =1
1 N
∑ (Logik − Logi )2
N k =1

1 N
∑ (Log jk − Log j )2
N k =1

where N is the dimension of Vectori and Vectorj and Logi
and Logj are the mean values and are defined by

Logi =

1 N
1 N
∑ Logik , and Log j = N ∑ Log jk .
N k =1
k =1

To summarize, the first input feature is the log scale of the
pairwise E-value. The second input feature consists of 16
feature values, which are frequency values of the alignment positions and the third input feature includes 7 values, which relate to the details of the alignments. And
finally, the fourth input feature includes 1 feature value
which measures the overlap of the neighbour sets to make
a total of 25 input features which will be used to train the
neural network as described below.
Neural networks
After we represent the sequence homology between a pair
of sequences by the set of 25 input features, we train the

neural network using the training data. Each homologous
pair of sequences is labeled as 1 if they belong to the same
InterPro superfamily or the same domain if they are single
domain proteins, and 0 otherwise. We selected as large a
number of sequences as possible to train the neural
networks to avoid overfitting the data. In all, we selected
27844 homologous sequence pairs as the positive training
set and 29999 non-homologous sequence pairs as the
negative training set.
The neural network we use is a fully connected feed-forward back propagation neural network and has one hidden layer with sigmoid activation functions (see Figure 7).
The output layer of the neural network has one output
unit. The output value is bounded between 0 and 1. The
network is trained with the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm [24] implemented in MATLAB [25].
Given the large amount of training data relative to the
number of the weights in the neural network, the neural
network is unlikely to overfit. It may however underfit if
there are not a sufficient number of weights. If the training

data are smaller relative to the number of weights in the
neural network, measures should be taken to avoid the
overfitting problem and the cross-validation method
should be used to choose the best model. Clearly in this
study, such is not the case.
We used a split-sample approach in which the validation
set is not used during training, but is used to select the best
model. After the neural network is trained, it is validated
on the validation dataset containing 250597 homologous
pairs of sequences and 30000 non-homologous pairs.
Different numbers of hidden layer nodes have been
tested. The ultimate goal is not to determine if any two
proteins sequences belong to the same Interpro family,
but to cluster all sequences in Interpro families as accurately as possible. We selected the model with the smallest
number of weights and smallest error on the validation
set. Thus, we chose 4 hidden layer nodes such that the
neural network has the least number of hidden units and
the best performance on the validation dataset with a specificity of 94.18% and a sensitivity of 91.81%.

Modeling the transitive homology
The neural network is then used to calculate the metric
value for any pair of protein sequences that hit to each
other below the E-value that was used as a cutoff. The metric value, P(A,B), for protein sequences A and B is
interpreted as the likelihood that these two protein
sequences belong to the same InterPro superfamily or
have the same single domain. The value P(A,B) is replaced
by P(A,C)P(C,B) if there exists a sequence C such that
P(A,C)P(C,B) is larger than the current value of P(A,B).
This transformation takes advantage of the transitive
homology of sequences A and B through the intermediate
sequence C, assuming that protein sequences A and C and
protein sequences B and C are independently homologous. Figure 8 illustrates the transitive homology between
sequence a and sequence b through the third sequence c.
The E-values between sequence a and sequence c,
sequence c and sequence b, as well as sequence a and
sequence b are 0.01, 0.005, 20 respectively. P(a,c), P(c,b),
and P(a,b) are 0.8, 0.9, and 0.2 respectively. The homology between sequence a and sequence b cannot be
detected with their direct E-value. However, the value of
P(a,b) is assigned to 0.72 because of the transitive
sequence homology.
Hierarchical average linkage clustering
Once the metric value for every pair of protein sequences
is calculated, the hierarchical average linkage clustering
method is applied to cluster the protein sequences in the
new metric space using the geometric mean as the merging rule.

Hierarchical average linkages uses the Unweighted PairGroup Average (UPGA) [26] to measure the distance
between clusters. Let Di, i = 1,2, ... n. denote the protein
sequences contained in Cluster D and let Ej, j = 1,2, ..., m
denote the protein sequence contained in Cluster E. The
geometric mean distance G between Cluster D and Cluster
E is defined as Equation 4:

The hierarchical average linkage clustering works in an
iterative process: it begins with each protein sequence as a
singleton cluster; during each iteration, it finds two clusters with the lowest metric value, then joins these two
clusters into a new cluster, and updates the metric value
between this new cluster and all others. This process
iterates until the current lowest metric value exceeds the
threshold.
