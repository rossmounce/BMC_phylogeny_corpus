Discovery and identification of a male-killing
agent in the Japanese ladybird Propylea japonica
(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)
Tamsin MO Majerus1*, Michael EN Majerus2

Abstract
Background: Endosymbionts that manipulate the reproduction of their hosts have been reported widely in
invertebrates. One such group of endosymbionts is the male-killers. To date all male-killers reported are bacterial in
nature, but comprise a diverse group. Ladybirds have been described as a model system for the study of malekilling, which has been reported in multiple species from widespread geographic locations. Whilst criteria of low
egg hatch-rate and female-biased progenic sex ratio have been used to identify female hosts of male-killers,
variation in vertical transmission efficiency and host genetic factors may result in variation in these phenotypic
indicators of male-killer presence. Molecular identification of bacteria and screening for bacterial presence provide
us with a more accurate method than breeding data alone to link the presence of the bacteria to the male-killing
phenotype. In addition, by identifying the bacteria responsible we may find evidence for horizontal transfer
between endosymbiont hosts and can gain insight into the evolutionary origins of male-killing. Phylogenetic
placement of male-killing bacteria will allow us to address the question of whether male-killing is a potential
strategy for only some, or all, maternally inherited bacteria. Together, phenotypic and molecular characterisation of
male-killers will allow a deeper insight into the interactions between host and endosymbiont, which ultimately
may lead to an understanding of how male-killers identify and kill male-hosts.
Results: A male-killer was detected in the Japanese coccinellid, Propylea japonica (Thunberg) a species not
previously known to harbour male-killers. Families produced by female P. japonica showed significantly femalebiased sex ratios. One female produced only daughters. This male-killer trait was maternally inherited and antibiotic
treatment produced a full, heritable cure. Molecular analysis identified Rickettsia to be associated with the trait in
this species of ladybird.
Conclusion: We conclude that P. japonica is host to a bacterial male-killer that is vertically inherited with variable
transmission efficiency. Rickettsia presence correlates with the male-killing trait, but there is some variation in the
phenotypic expression of the trait due to interaction with host factors. Phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA
and 17 kDa antigen genes suggests there may have been horizontal transfer of Rickettsial male-killers between
different ladybird hosts.

Background
Invertebrate reproductive systems are frequently
manipulated by inherited symbionts. In insects, three
forms of manipulation, cytoplasmic incompatibility, feminisation of genetic males, and induction of parthenogenesis, are largely the province of a single genus of
bacteria, the Wolbachia. However, a fourth

manipulation, the biasing of secondary host sex ratios in
favour of females by killing males, has been shown to
have evolved in six different clades of bacteria: Group II
Spiroplasma from Drosophila species, first identified in

Flavobacterium from Colemegilla maculatus [10], Adonia variegata [11] and Coccinula sinensis [7] and Wolbachia from A. bipunctata, several species of Acraea
butterfly, first reported in Acraea encedon [12], another
butterfly, Hypolimnas bolina [13] and two Drosophila
species, D. bifasciata [14] and D. innubila [15]. The
diversity of male-killers identified to date raises the
question as to whether male-killing is a potential property of a few, many or almost all maternally inherited
bacteria. To address this question, more bacteria associated with the male-killing phenotype need to be characterised and placed phylogenetically.
In addition, the vertical transmission efficiency of different male-killing bacteria varies from almost perfect
(> 99% for Spiroplasmas in A. bipunctata and H. axyridis and one strain of Wolbachia in A. bipunctata) to
less than 72% for Rickettsia in some samples of A.
bipunctata [16-18]. The vertical transmission efficiency
is a critical parameter in the dynamics of male-killer
invasion and spread [19]. Assessments of the vertical
transmission efficiencies of newly discovered male-killers
are thus valuable to allow assessment of whether levels
of vertical transmission are consistent within bacterial
clades, or vary case by case as a result of interactions
between each symbiont and its host.
The aphidophagous coccinellid beetles are a ‘hot-spot’
for invasion by male-killers [20]. Aspects of the ecology
and certain life-history traits of these beetles mean that
female progeny of infected females gain an advantage
over those of uninfected females as a result of the death
of male siblings, through the reallocation of resources
from the dead males. Aphidophagous coccinellids lay
eggs in batches, indulge in sibling egg cannibalism/consumption and suffer high neonate larval mortality due
to starvation if they fail to catch and subdue aphid prey
within a short period after dispersing from their egg
clutch. Consequently, the daughters of females infected
with a male-killer will benefit from the consumption of
the soma of their dead (male-killed) brothers. The additional nutrients thus gained, which will be denied to
daughters of uninfected females, reduce the starvation
likelihood of daughters of infected females, for they have
a longer time to search before starving to death.
Furthermore, they are larger, so that they may be able
to catch and subdue a greater size range of aphids [20].
Female-biased sex ratios, shown or assumed to result
from male-killing have been reported in three species of
Japanese coccinellid, Harmonia axyridis [17,21], Cheilomenes (= Menochilus) sexmaculatus [22] and Coccinula
sinensis [23]. We here report the detection and identification of a male-killer in a fourth Japanese coccinellid,
Propylea japonica (Thunberg). We show that the malekiller involved belongs to a bacterial clade known to be
associated with male-killing, but not previously reported

Page 2 of 10

from Japan. Finally, we assess the male-killer’s vertical
transmission efficiency and compare this level with
male-killers of the same clade from other coccinellid
hosts.

Results
Detection of the male-killing trait

The sex ratio (proportion male) in a sample of P. japonica from Fuchu was 0.426 (26 male: 35 female). This
does not differ significantly from 1:1 (Binomial exact
test, p > 0.24).
The egg hatch rates of 13 P. japonica families (derived
from the Fuchu sample above), all of which produced
both male and female progeny, varied from 0.34 to 0.92
(Table 1). Ten matrilines, in which egg hatch rates were
greater than 0.5 and progenic sex ratios were not significantly different from 1:1, were designated normal (N).
Three families (PF2, PF3, PF5), with hatch rates below
0.5 produced significantly female biased sex ratios, but
with some males, and were designated female biased
(FB).
One matriline (PF12) produced 49 female progeny and
no males. The egg hatch rate from this female was
0.462. This low hatch rate is consistent with male-killing, and in conjunction with the total absence of males
leads to the conclusion that line PF12 bears a male-killing element, designated sex ratio (SR).
Egg hatch rates of the SR and three FB lines were all
below 0.462, while those of the N lines all exceeded
0.528. The difference between the two groups was significant (c2 = 155.954, d.f. = 1, p < 0.001). The relationship between egg hatch rate and progenic sex ratio is
illustrated in Figure 1. The prevalence of the trait in this
sample depends crucially upon the true infection status
of the three FB lines. Additional phenotypic and

molecular analysis was carried out on these lines and is
discussed below.
Inheritance and vertical transmission of the male-killing
trait
SR Line

In crosses designed to examine the inheritance of the
male-killing trait in the SR line PF12, two of the pairs
(PF12.1, PF12.9) failed to produce sufficient adult progeny for analysis. Results from the remaining eight pairings are given in Table 2. All the progeny of these eight
pairs produced over this period were female (n = 109),
with the egg hatch rates being less than 0.5 for each
pair. The SR status in these lines is maternally inherited.

after treatment with tetracycline. Further, there was no
evidence of a female biased sex ratio in the F2 of any of
the N families tested.
It was found that the FB lines all had high hatch rates
and produced roughly equal numbers of male and
female progeny (data available on request), suggesting
that the female bias in these lines may not be due to the
presence of a male-killer. This result was assessed
further by molecular analysis.
It is concluded that the female bias in PF12 is the
result of distortion of the secondary sex ratio by a malekiller. Furthermore, the SR trait in PF12 is maternally
inherited with a very high vertical transmission rate.

FB and N Lines

Assessment of vertical transmission efficiency

Crosses involving N F1 females all had high hatch rates
(>0.6) and produced progenic sex ratios that did not differ significantly from 1:1 (n > 16 in all cases), irrespective of whether males were drawn from N families, FB
families, or from F 2 progeny of the SR family, PF12,

The vertical transmission efficiency of the SR trait from
mother to adult daughter, calculated as 1 - (the number
of males produced divided by the number of females
produced) [24], assessed from PF12, PF12.2-4, PF12.7,
PF12.8, PF12.10 and the ten additional PF12 F1 pairs
was 0.998 (2 males in 878 progeny).

Sensitivity to tetracycline

The results of experiments to assess the effect of tetracycline treatment are given in Table 3. (Table 2 shows
the egg hatch rates and progenic sex ratios for these
pairs prior to these treatments.) The egg hatch rates and
progenic sex ratios for the pairs administered tetracycline increased following this treatment, indicating that
the antibiotic produces alleviation of the effects of the
male-killer, as would be expected if it is bacterial. There
was no significant change in either trait in the four control pairs.

Does tetracycline treatment produce a heritable cure of
the SR trait?

As there was no effect of the control treatments on
PF12.3, PF12.4, PF12.8 and PF12.10, it is not surprising
that all eight pairs from these lines retained their
SR status (egg hatch rates < 0.5 and only female progeny) in the next generation. Conversely, all four
females from the two tetracycline treated lines produced
increased egg hatch rates and progenic sex ratios that
did not differ significantly from 1:1 (Table 4).
It is concluded that treatment with tetracycline produces a full heritable cure of the SR trait, with an
increase in egg hatch rate and concomitant production
of male-progeny. The effect of tetracycline treatment
occurred within four days of the commencement of
treatment. These factors strongly suggest that the malekiller is bacterial in nature.
Identification of the agent associated with male-killing

To determine the identity of the causal agent of malekilling in PF12, on the assumption that the male-killer
was a bacterium, the 16S rRNA gene was characterised
from two F1 females from PF12.

Results of breeding from female progeny of tetracycline treated lines.

BLAST database comparison of the 16S rDNA
sequence isolated from two PF12 F1 females listed Rickettsia bellii as the closest match (99% identity) [EMBL:
FN550103]. It is concluded that the SR trait in P. japonica is caused by a male-killing a-proteobacterium of
the genus Rickettsia.
Correlation between the SR trait and Rickettsia presence

In order to ascertain whether Rickettsia presence correlates with the male-killing phenotype a larger number of
individuals were tested. Females from the parental, F 1
and F 2 generations of the SR line, PF12, individuals
from each of the three FB lines, along with one female
and one male from each of seven of the N lines, three
female progeny from PF12.8 after golden syrup treatment and two male and two female progeny from each
of PF12.5 and PF12.6 produced after tetracycline treatment, were screened via a Rickettsia-specific PCR from
the 17 kDa antigen gene. In addition, the parental
female of one line (PF11) and an F1 female of another
(PF6) that had failed to produce enough progeny for
analysis, were tested in the same way.
None of the individuals from N lines gave a positive
result with Rickettsia-specific primers, confirming that
absence of the bacteria coincides with absence of the
male-killing trait. Conversely, all the individuals from
the PF12 matriline, gave a positive 17 kDa antigen gene
PCR result [EMBL:FN550104], with the exception of
one female, produced in the control line PF12.8 from
the antibiotic sensitivity experiment. All the other individuals from the antibiotic sensitivity experiment (posttreatment) tested positive for Rickettsia. This confirms
that the bacteria in line PF12 are vertically inherited
with very high transmission efficiency. Furthermore, it
suggests that where alleviation of the symptoms of
male-killing has occurred following antibiotic treatment,
bacteria (or bacterial DNA) may still be present.
The situation in the FB individuals is less clear cut.
For PF3, six F1 females were tested, one of which was
positive. For PF5, seven F1 females were tested, three of
which were positive. Although larger numbers of individuals would be required to be confident that this was an
accurate indicator, these results suggest very low vertical
transmission efficiency in these two lines. This could be
due to a very low bacterial density in the parental
female, meaning that only a small proportion of her
eggs inherited the infection. Alternatively, there may be
some host interaction with the bacteria that reduces
their transmission to the eggs. For PF2, the parental
female tested negative, suggesting that the female bias in
this line may have another cause and can be considered
to represent a type one error.
The two female individuals (PF6 and PF11) lacking
breeding data that were tested did produce a PCR

product band. This indicates that they were infected
with Rickettsia and it may be suggested that if they had
produced sufficient progeny for analysis they would
have exhibited the phenotypic indicators of male-killing.
Combining the phenotypic data with the molecular
identification of Rickettsia infection in the two incompletely ascertained lines brings the prevalence of the
male-killing trait in this sample of P. japonica to 0.3125
(5 out of 16).
It is concluded that where it has been possible to test,
Rickettsia presence correlates with the SR trait, but that
there is some variation in the phenotypic expression of
the trait, either due to interaction with host factor(s),
low bacterial density or variable bacterial vertical transmission efficiency.

Phylogenetic analysis

To assess the phylogenetic position of the Rickettsia
male-killer from P. japonica two phylogenetic trees were
produced. Sequences chosen for comparison comprised
those most similar as identified by a BLAST search [25]
and other relevant related bacteria, with known reproductive phenotypic effects. Where possible the same
species were included in both trees to allow comparisons between the two to be made, however data were
not always available to allow this.
The 16s rDNA sequence from the P. japonica malekiller was aligned with those from 18 other Rickettsias
and two outgroups (Wolbachia and Erlichia) (Figure 2).
This tree is not particularly informative. The P. japonica
male-killer appears most closely related to R.

Majerus and Majerus BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:37

canadensis, followed by R. bellii and, interestingly, a
secondary endosymbiont of A. pisum. However, the
bootstrap values on this tree, with the exception of that
separating the outgroups from the rest, are all fairly
low. Also full 16S rDNA sequences for the A. bipunctata and A. decempunctata male-killers were not available meaning this tree can not be used for phylogenetic
comparison with other ladybird male-killers. Hence, a
second tree was produced, aligning the 17 kDa antigen
gene sequences from the P. japonica male-killer and
those from 21 other Rickettsia species, including the
male-killers from A. bipunctata and A. decempunctata
(Figure 3).
This tree is broadly consistent with the 16S tree,
although again many of the bootstrap values are low.
The ladybird male-killers form a clade distinct from the
other Rickettsias. The P. japonica male-killer is most
closely related to that from A. bipunctata from the U.K.,
whereas the male-killer from A. bipunctata from Denmark clusters with that from A. decempunctata. This is
suggestive of horizontal transfer between ladybird species (see below for further discussion).

Discussion
The results of these studies have revealed sex ratio distortion in a single matriline of P. japonica, leading to
severely female biased sex ratios in this line over three
generations. The trait is maternally inherited, is sensitive

Page 6 of 10

to tetracycline treatment and shows a strong correlation
with presence of a Rickettsia. In addition, the same bacteria appear to produce a much weaker male-killing
phenotype in two other matrilines, leading to less
strongly, but still significantly, female-biased sex ratios
in these lines.
The phylogenetic analysis of this Rickettsia male-killer
confirms that it is closely related to the other male-killers in the analysis. Further, the 17 kDa antigen tree provides some evidence of horizontal transfer between
ladybird hosts, as the male-killers in the two populations
of A. bipunctata are more closely related to those in P.
japonica and A. decempunctata, than they are to each
other. Whilst there has been no demonstration of how
ladybirds might acquire male-killers in the wild, it is
tantalizing to note that the aphid prey species A. pisum
contains bacteria phylogenetically related to those causing male-killing in the three ladybird species. Further
molecular investigation of these bacteria, involving more
rapidly evolving regions of the genome may allow
further insight into possible origins of bacterial malekillers.
As similar members of bacterial clades are found to
cause male-killing in related hosts, such as a single
family of beetles, comparisons of the vertical transmission efficiencies of the male-killers can be made both
within and between bacterial clades. In this study, the
third instance of male-killing within the Coccinellidae

has been found for Rickettsia. Flavobacteria and Spiroplasma have been identified in 3 and 2 instances respectively (see Table 5). In addition, it has previously been
established that male-killing is caused by two different
strains of Wolbachia in a single species of coccinellid, A.
bipunctata [16].
Examination of the vertical transmission efficiencies of
the bacterial male-killers in each of these four clades
(Table 5) shows transmission efficiencies to be highly variable both between clades and in most cases within clades.
Variation in vertical transmission is most clearly demonstrated by the Rickettsial male-killers. For some lines of P.
japonica the vertical transmission efficiency appeared to
be very low (< 50%), based on assessment of male-killer
status via molecular analysis, whilst in PF12 it appeared to
be close to 100%. The A. decempunctata male-killer exhibits vertical transmission efficiency greater than 90%, at
least for some lines, whereas Rickettsia infected lines of A.
bipunctata consistently have lower vertical transmission
efficiencies of between 72% and 87%. Again there is evidence of inter-individual variation in different matrilines
of A. bipunctata, with lines exhibiting vertical transmission
efficiencies as low as 54% [18].
The male-killing Flavobacterium in C. maculata shows
highly variable vertical transmission, both between
families and within the lifetime of single females that
exhibit a progressive sex ratio trait. This differs from the
vertical transmission efficiency of the A. variegata malekiller, which is generally high, but can exhibit progressive sex ratio (Majerus, M. pers. comm.) and that of the
C. sinensis male-killer which is high, with few males
being produced by infected females.
Whilst caution must be exercised when considering
single lines, particularly when the number of individuals
may be small, it is pertinent to note that variation in
either the host or endosymbiont genotype is likely to play
a part in these differences. Although it is not possible to
rule out environmental factors affecting the phenotypic

expression of the male-killer, it is unlikely that these can
be the main causes of the differences seen here. This is
due to the fact that the breeding experiments for all six
of these host species were carried out in the same laboratory under fairly constant conditions.
The correlation between Rickettsia presence and the
SR trait in this matriline, ascertained using the 17 kDa
gene was exact, apart from in progeny of tetracycline
treated females. Here, females ‘cured’ of the SR trait and
their male siblings gave positive results when assayed
for Rickettsia. There are two possible explanations of
the apparent presence of Rickettsia in non-killed males
and ‘cured’ females, despite the evidence that tetracycline produces a full heritable cure of the trait. First,
bacteria may be present in very low numbers in the progeny of treated individuals. If the pathogenicity of the
Rickettsia towards males is density dependent, as has
been suggested e.g. for the Rickettsia male-killer of Adalia decempunctata [9], there will be alleviation of malekilling expression, despite continued bacterial presence.
Tetracycline is bacteriostatic, hence time is required for
the bacteria to be eliminated by the host. Some bacteria
may pass into the egg and hence into the progeny,
despite having their growth inhibited by the antibiotic.
As PCR is a very sensitive test, a very small number of
target molecules in the DNA input would be enough to
generate a visible product. Second, the apparent presence of Rickettsia, may be the result of PCR amplification of DNA from dead bacteria. Bacteria may pass into
the egg before death and DNA from dead bacteria may
be amplified. The alleviation of male-killing symptoms
would then be due to a lack of viable bacteria and not
necessarily dependent on bacterial density.
A model in which a threshold bacterial density is
required to cause male-killing can similarly explain the
situation in the 2 FB lines for which a proportion of the
female progeny tested positive for Rickettsia presence,
but which were part of sibships where males survived. If

it is assumed that the maternal bacterial levels were low,
survival of male embryos and hence non-SR phenotypic
status would follow. However, it could be argued that in
this instance increase in bacterial numbers should lead
either to late male-killing or progressive sex ratio once
enough time has elapsed and potentially that once a
high enough bacterial density had been established in
the parental female, high vertical transmission (as
shown by PF12) would be exhibited by all infected
females. In this sample of P. japonica, however, virtually
none of the unhatched eggs were grey. This suggests
that, at least during egg development, male-killing
occurs very early and there is no further male-death
later in development after bacterial multiplication. This
supports the suggestion that host factors are affecting
the actions of the male-killer; however, it would fit
equally well with a model in which the endosymbiont
either kills early or not at all. Interestingly, male-killing
Wolbachia in D. innubila show variation in transmission
and expression, and this variation is correlated with the
density of Wolbachia within host flies [26] and has been
shown not to be related to host genetic factors [27]. It
would be worthwhile investigating both male-specific
effects on egg hatch-rate and progenic sex ratio, as well
as screening larger numbers of males and females for
Rickettsia presence and testing for variation in bacterial
density in FB and SR families of this species.

matrilines. Eggs laid by these females were collected and
counted over a two-week period. Once eggs had hatched
and larvae had dispersed from egg clutches, egg hatch
rates were assessed, egg remnants being classed as clear
(hatched normally), grey (fertile but inviable for unknown
reason including possibly male-killed) or yellow (infertile
or male-killed) [18]. Larvae were fed daily on A. pisum
and allowed to pupate and eclose in the dishes. Progenic
sex ratios were recorded.
Nomenclature

The matrilines from the original sample were designated
PF (Propylea from Fuchu) and then a number (1-14).
Subsequent generations show the parental name followed by a ‘.’ to indicate a new generation, and then a
number e.g. PF12.3 is the third cross generated from F1
female progeny of PF12 and PF12.5.i is the first cross
generated from an F2 female, progeny of PF12.5.
Inheritance and vertical transmission of the male-killing
trait
SR Line

Ten virgin females from the SR matriline, PF12, were
mated with males from N matrilines. Eggs were collected over a one week period and progeny reared as for
the initial matrilines. Egg hatch rates and progenic sex
ratios were recorded.
FB and N Lines

Conclusion
Propylea japonica is host to a Rickettsia male-killer that
is closely related to Rickettsia male-killers in two other
ladybird host species. Phylogenetic analysis indicates
that there may have been horizontal transmission of
Rickettsia within the clade of ladybird male-killers.
There is wide variation in vertical transmission efficiency of the Rickettsia male-killers, both within and
between the different host species, indicating that host
genetic variation may be influencing the phenotypic
expression of these male-killers.

The three FB lines and four N lines were further analysed to look at the inheritance of the trait. Four virgin
females from each of the FB families PF2, PF3 and PF5,
and one from each of four N families were mated with
males from N matrilines. One virgin male from each of
the FB families was mated to a virgin female from N
families. Further, two F2 males from F1 families (PF12.5,
PF12.6) from the SR matriline which produced male
progeny only subsequent to treatment with tetracycline
(see below) were mated to unrelated females from N
lines. Again, these families were treated as before, egg
hatch rates and progenic sex ratios being recorded.

Methods
Detection of the male-killing trait

Assessment of vertical transmission efficiency

A sample of 61 P. japonica was collected by eye from the
campus of Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan, between 25th August 1998 and
2nd September 1998 as part of a survey of 30 coccinellid
species for male-killers [7]. The sample was kept in a
domestic refrigerator until 4th September 1998, when it
was transported to Cambridge, England. In Cambridge
the beetles were transferred to Petri dishes, kept at 21°C
and fed on Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris). The sample
was sexed, by examination of the posterior abdominal
sturnites, under CO2 anaesthetic. Fourteen mating pairs
were removed from stock dishes to establish individual

The vertical transmission efficiency of the SR trait was
assessed on the basis of the proportion of male progeny
in the PF12 matriline. To increase the stringency of
assessment of this vertical transmission estimate, ten F1
females from the SR line were mated to unrelated N
males. Progeny were reared as before and the progenic
sex ratios were recorded.
Sensitivity to tetracycline

To determine the nature of the male-killing element, six
of the PF12 F1 pairs that had produced all female progeny were selected for tests to determine whether the

Majerus and Majerus BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:37
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/37

sex ratio trait was affected by antibiotic treatment. Two
of these females (PF12.5, PF12.6) were fed a 10% solution of tetracycline in golden syrup daily for an hour.
Two further females (PF12.4, PF12.8) were offered just
golden syrup daily for an hour. The final two females
(PF12.3, PF12.10) were not fed anything other than their
normal A. pisum diet. Assessment of egg hatch rates
and progenic sex ratios continued subsequent to these
treatments.
Does tetracycline treatment produce a heritable cure of
the SR trait?

Two female progeny of each of the two lines treated
with tetracycline, from eggs laid 12 days after commencement with treatment were mated to males from
N families. Eggs were collected, progeny reared and egg
hatch rates and progenic sex ratios recorded as previously. Two female progeny from each of the four control lines were treated in the same way.
Identification of the agent associated with male-killing

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole ladybirds killed
in liquid nitrogen and ground up. Samples were incubated
in 250 μl of DNA extraction buffer (80 mM EDTA, 1%
SDS, 160 mM sucrose, 100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0), containing 20 μg proteinase K, at 37°C, overnight. An equal
volume of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol was
added, the tubes shaken thoroughly and then spun at
13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The aqueous layer was
removed to a new tube and the previous step repeated with
an equal volume of 24:1 chloroform: isoamyl alcohol. The
DNA was precipitated using 1/2 volume of 7.5 M NH4-AC
and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol
and resuspended in 100 μl of sterile distilled water.
Each DNA sample was assayed for the presence of
bacteria by PCR using general bacterial 16S rDNA primers described by [28]. Primers 27f (5’ - GAGAGTTT
GATCCTGGCTCAG - 3’) and 1495r (5’ - CTACGGC
TACCTTGTTACGA - 3’) were used in 25 μl reactions
containing 1 μl of the genomic ladybird DNA preparation; 2.5 μl NH 4 buffer; 2.5 μl dNTPs (2 mM with
respect to each dNTP); 1.25 μl MgCl2 (50 mM); 0.25 μl
each primer (50 pmol/μl); 0.25 μl Taq polymerase and
sterile distilled water to give a final volume of 25 μl.
Amplification controls were run for the PCR cocktail
and for an A. bipunctata female known to be infected
with a male-killing Rickettsia. Cycle conditions on a
Hybaid omnigene PCR machine were: 1 cycle of 2 min
94°C; 35 cycles of 15 s 94°C, 30 s 55°C, 3 min 72°C; 1
cycle 20 min 72°C. PCR products were visualised using
UV light following electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide.
To determine the identity of the agent in those samples producing a positive 16S PCR result, the product

Page 9 of 10

band was purified from the agarose gel using Prep-aGene (Biorad) and directly sequenced using dye-labelled
terminators in a cycle-sequencing reaction, the products
being visualised on an ABI 373 automated sequencer.
Both strands of the whole unit were sequenced using
internal primers.
Control tests, with primers which amplify the COI gene
from insect mtDNA [29], were performed on samples
which failed to yield a product with the general bacterial
16S rDNA PCR, to check that the DNA preparation did
not contain factor(s) inhibiting the PCR reaction.
Correlation between the SR trait and Rickettsia presence

The 17 kDa antigen gene (primers R1, 5’ GCTCTTGCAACTTCTATGTT - 3’ and R2, 5’ CATTGTTCGTCAGGTTGGCG - 3’, [30]) was used to
screen specifically for Rickettsia. Cycle conditions on a
Hybaid omnigene PCR machine were: 1 cycle of 2 min
94°C; 35 cycles of 15 s 94°C, 1 min 60°C, 1.5 min 72°C;
1 cycle 10 min 72°C. For some individuals, the 17 kDa
antigen gene PCR product obtained was sequenced for
phylogenetic analysis (see below).
Phylogenetic analysis

Sequences were aligned using the programme CLUSTALW [31]. Data sets were characterised by calculating
the number and percentage of nucleotide differences
between pairwise compared sequences. Fifty-six different
substitution models were considered using the programme Modeltest (version 3.06) and the simplest
model, for which the log likelihood could not be significantly improved by choosing a more complex alternative, was selected. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using an iterative search strategy, following Schulenburg
et al. [32] using the program PAUP* version 4.0b8 [33].
An initial tree topology was obtained using unweighted
maximum parsimony (MP) and a heuristic tree search
via branch-swapping by tree bisection and reconnection.
This served to obtain maximum likelihood (ML) estimates required for the selected substitution model (ts/tv
ratio, values for the rates of six different types of substitutions, four distinct gamma rate heterogeneity categories and fraction of invariable sites). These parameters
were then used for ML tree estimation. Here, the MP
topology served as a starting tree for a heuristic search
by nearest neighbour interchange. The robustness of the
inferred tree topology was determined by non-parametric bootstrapping [34], with 100 replicates.
