Abstract
Background: A long term research goal of venomics, of applied importance for improving current antivenom
therapy, but also for drug discovery, is to understand the pharmacological potential of venoms. Individually or
combined, proteomic and transcriptomic studies have demonstrated their feasibility to explore in depth the
molecular diversity of venoms. In the absence of genome sequence, transcriptomes represent also valuable
searchable databases for proteomic projects.
Results: The venom gland transcriptomes of 8 Costa Rican taxa from 5 genera (Crotalus, Bothrops, Atropoides,
Cerrophidion, and Bothriechis) of pitvipers were investigated using high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing. 100,394
out of 330,010 masked reads produced significant hits in the available databases. 5.165,220 nucleotides (8.27%)
were masked by RepeatMasker, the vast majority of which corresponding to class I (retroelements) and class II
(DNA transposons) mobile elements. BLAST hits included 79,991 matches to entries of the taxonomic suborder
Serpentes, of which 62,433 displayed similarity to documented venom proteins. Strong discrepancies between the
transcriptome-computed and the proteome-gathered toxin compositions were obvious at first sight. Although the
reasons underlaying this discrepancy are elusive, since no clear trend within or between species is apparent, the
data indicate that individual mRNA species may be translationally controlled in a species-dependent manner. The
minimum number of genes from each toxin family transcribed into the venom gland transcriptome of each
species was calculated from multiple alignments of reads matched to a full-length reference sequence of each
toxin family. Reads encoding ORF regions of Kazal-type inhibitor-like proteins were uniquely found in Bothriechis
schlegelii and B. lateralis transcriptomes, suggesting a genus-specific recruitment event during the early-Middle
Miocene. A transcriptome-based cladogram supports the large divergence between A. mexicanus and A. picadoi,
and a closer kinship between A. mexicanus and C. godmani.
Conclusions: Our comparative next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis reveals taxon-specific trends governing
the formulation of the venom arsenal. Knowledge of the venom proteome provides hints on the translation
efficiency of toxin-coding transcripts, contributing thereby to a more accurate interpretation of the transcriptome.
The application of NGS to the analysis of snake venom transcriptomes, may represent the tool for opening the
door to systems venomics.

Background
Venomous snakes of the families Viperidae and Elapidae
possess paired specialized venom glands located in the
upper jaw ventral and posterior to the eyes [1] that produce an arsenal of toxins [2,3], which they inject into
prey tissues through high-pressure delivery fangs [4].
Within the reptile clade Toxicofera, venom was a single
ancient innovation [5]. Snake venom toxins are the
result of recruitment events by which ordinary genes
were duplicated, and the new genes selectively expressed
in the venom gland and amplified to multigene families
with extensive neofunctionalization throughout ~100
million years of evolution [5,6]. Given the central role
that diet has played in the adaptive radiation of snakes
[7], venom thus represents a key adaptation that has
played an important role in the diversification of snakes.
Envenoming by snakebites constitutes a highly relevant, though neglected, public health issue on a global
basis [8], as there are venomous organisms in every continent and almost every country. However, venomous
animals are particularly abundant in tropical regions,
the kitchen of evolution. Arthropod stings constitute the
most common cause of envenoming by animals,
although around 80% of the more than 150.000 yearly
deaths by envenomings worldwide are caused by snakebites, followed by scorpion stings, which cause 15%
[9,10]. The venoms of extant snakes comprise complex
cocktails of proteins tailored by Natural Selection to act
on vital systems of the prey [11]. Medical uses of
venoms are well documented in folk remedies and in
Western and Chinese traditional medicine [12]. However, despite their remarkable potency and high degree
of target specificity, only in the last decades have toxins
been increasingly used as pharmacological tools, and it
has been realized that venoms represent a vast and
essentially untapped resource of preoptimized lead
molecules for the medicinal chemist [12-17].
Adequate treatment of snakebites is critically dependent on the ability of antivenoms to neutralize the lethal
and tissue-damaging toxins, reversing thereby the signs
of envenoming [18,19]. A long term research goal of
venomics, of applied importance for improving current
antivenom therapy, but also for drug discovery, is to
understand the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary
forces that underlie the enormous pharmacological
potential of venoms [12]. Individually or combined, proteomic and transcriptomic studies have demonstrated
their feasibility to explore in depth the molecular diversity of venoms [[20-28], and references therein]. In the
absence of genome sequence, transcriptomes represent
also valuable searchable databases for proteomic projects.
Since the pioneer report by Ho and co-workers in
1995 [29], snake venom transcriptomic studies have

Page 2 of 16

relied on sequencing DNA clones randomly picked from
a cDNA library constructed by reverse transcription of
the RNA molecules expressed in the venom gland [25].
The partial cDNA sequences derived from expressed
genes, also known as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs)
[30], cluster into groups of contiguous sequences (contigs), which eventually cover the entire extension of the
original RNA molecule. In addition, the number of ESTs
clustered into a contig is proportional to the transcriptional level of the parent RNA in the venom gland [25].
However, in the few instances in which transcriptomics
and proteomics databases have been compared
[26,27,31,32], a low degree of concordance has been
reported. The occurrence of non-venom-secreted toxin
transcripts might indicate that these messengers exhibit
an individual or a temporal expression pattern over the
life time of the snake [33], or may encode very lowabundance venom proteins. On the other hand, the presence in the venom of toxins not represented in the
transcriptome clearly indicates that construction of the
cDNA library was biased, i.e. due to the necessary fractionating steps to avoid interfering substances like short,
partial length 3’-end cDNAs and adapter sequences [34].
A second bias of cDNA libraries is the potential of the
mRNA transcript in plasmids to be partially expressed
in their bacterial cells with lethal effects [35]. Moreover,
smaller cDNA fragments are over represented compared
to larger ones, due to the higher transformation efficiency of smaller plasmids [35].
The high demand for low-cost sequencing has driven
the development of high-throughput next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies such as 454 Roche, Illumina’s Solexa, and Applied Biosystems’ SOLiD, and and
most recently released Helicos HeliScope platforms as
alternatives to the classical chain-termination Sanger
method of DNA sequencing for the qualitative and
quantitative analyses of transcriptomes [36,37]. NGS
technologies are revolutionizing the field of transcriptomics by rapidly reducing the time and cost per base
sequenced [38]. For example, snake venom gland transcriptomes reported are typically arranged from few
hundreds to few thousands ESTs [25]. The largest transcriptome database was assembled from 8696 ESTs
(mean read length of 398 bp) from Deinagkistrodon acutus venom gland [39]. Only very recently Rokyta and
colleagues [40] reported a high-throughput venom gland
transcriptome of the Eastern Diamond Rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) using Roche 454 sequencing technology. 82,621 reads were singletons, and the remaining
552,863 reads were assembled into 24,773 contigs of
average length 513 nucleotides [40]. NGS technologies
applied to the transcriptomic analysis of non-model species has the advantage of providing a genome-wide,

Durban et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:259
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/259

unbiased insight into the transcriptome [41]. However,
NGS techniques applied to non-model species, which
like snakes lack a suitable reference genome sequence,
are not devoid of limitations. NGS technologies provide
shorter and more error-prone reads than Sanger
sequencing, making transcript assembly a challenging
bioinformatic task, which frequently yields a large set of
contigs but a fragmented transcriptome [38,41]. Here,
we report the application of the 454 platform to infer
the venom gland transcriptomes of Costa Rican snakes,
Bothrops asper (from Caribbean (car) and Pacific (pac)
populations), Bothriechis lateralis, Bothriechis schlegelii,
Atropoides picadoi, Atropoides mexicanus, Crotalus
simus, and Cerrophidion godmani, with special emphasis
on the strategy used to assemble and analyze the gathered DNA sequences. Although the average length of
singletons (174 bp) and contigs (208.2 bp), and the low
coverage of reads per contig (6), prevented the generation of definitive and reliable full-length gene sequences,
our results provide a deep comparison of the transcriptional activity of the venom glands of these medically
relevant species in Central America [42,43].

Results and Discussion
454 sequencing statistics and annotation of transcripts

The eight venom gland single-strand cDNA libraries
were sequenced using a multiplex strategy. To this end,
each cDNA library was barcoded with a unique 10-base
sequence (MID, Multiplex IDentifier) that is recognized
by the sequencing analysis software, allowing for automated sorting of MID-containing reads. A total of
334,540 reads (amounting ~ 62 Mb of 8 snake venom
gland transcriptomes) were simultaneously sequenced in
two runs of the Genome Sequencer FLX System. Raw
sequencing data are archived under accession number
SRP003780 in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra) [44]. Accession
codes by species are SRS117169.3 (B. asper (car));
SRS117211.3 (B. asper (pac)); SRS117214.2 (C. simus);
SRS117215.1 (A. picadoi); SRS117216.1 (A. mexicanus);
SRS117217.1 (C. godmani); SRS117218.1 (B. lateralis);
and SRS117219.2 (B. schlegelii). The first run included
only cDNA from B. asper from the Caribbean versant of
Costa Rica, and was performed as a test run. The second run was done using cDNA from all the species
investigated. The average length per read was 186.6
bases (max. 645 bp, and only 3.27% of reads < 50 bp),
and this figure is in keeping with other 454 transcriptomic reports conducted in non-model species [45].
4530 reads could not be assigned due to sequencing
errors in the 3’ 10-mer label. This figure corresponds to
a sequencing error rate of 1.35%, which is higher than
that (~ 0.04%) reported in other studies35,44. In addition,
5,165,220 nucleotides (8.27%) were masked with N’s

Page 3 of 16

characters by RepeatMasker. The vast majority of
sequence elements masked are class I (retroelements)
and class II (DNA transposons) mobile elements
[46-48]. Retroelements may have a profound impact on
the plasticity of the host genomes [49], i.e. modulating
transcription of immediately downstream host genes
[50,51]. The bulk (64%) of mobile elements identified in
the snake venom gland transcriptomes investigated here
are retrotransposons (Additional file 1: Table S1). Retrotransposable elements have been previously reported in
the transcriptomes of Bothrops insularis (4.1% of ESTs)
[52], Lachesis muta (0.3%) [53], and Philodryas olfersii
(4.1%) [54], and in PLA2 genes from the venom gland
of Vipera ammodytes [55,56] and Protobothrops flavoviridis [57]. In the context of multigene toxins, which like
the snake venom PLA2s are evolving under strong positive adaptive selection [58-60], it is worth mentioning
that transposable elements are overrepresented in the
mRNAs of rapidly evolving genes [61], suggesting that
they have played a role in the diversification and expansion of these gene families [61,62].
The 454 sequencing run yielded a total of 330,010
masked reads, which were distributed among the 8
venom gland transcriptomes as displayed in Additional
file 1: Table S2. In the absence of any reference genome
to guide the assembly, the sets of reads of each species
were separately processed with program Newbler, the de
novo assembler tool of the 454 Sequencing platform.
However, only 58.4% of all reads clustered into 31,025
contigs (average length of the contigs was 208.2 bp;
average number of reads per contig = 6), of which 43%
comprised only 2 reads. The program also returned
103,357 singletons (mean length, 174.4 bp). Employing
other assembler programs, such as MIRA (http://www.
chevreux.org/projects_mira.html) or Velvet [63], and
using different settings (i.e. Velvet: hash-length 21 or 31;
MIRA: job normal or accurate), did not improve the
assembly performance. The transcriptome assembly problem has been documented [64,65], particularly for
organisms without a reference genome database.
Because of the low data compression gained in the
assembly step and the small difference between contigs
and reads mean length, bioinformatic processing of the
454 sequence data was performed on whole sets of
unassembled reads. The set of 330,010 reads was
searched against non-redundant GenBank databases
using BLASTX and BLASTN algorithms to identify
similar sequences with an e-value cutoff <10-3. 100,394
(30.4%) produced significant hits (Additional file 1:
Table S2). The high percentage of reads without significant similarity to any known sequence is in line with
previous transcriptomic studies. Hence, the 8696 high
quality ESTs from a non-normalized cDNA library of
D. acutus were assembled into 2855 clusters, of which

Durban et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:259
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/259

Page 4 of 16

only 45.60% matched known sequences and 54.40% had
no match to any known sequence in Genbank [39,66].
BLAST hits included 79,991 matches to entries of the
taxonomic suborder Serpentes, of which 62,433 (62% of
BLAST hits) displayed similarity to documented venom
proteins (Additional file 1: Table S2). The set of reads
lacking similarity to Serpentes entries was searched for
the presence of cysteine-rich domains (eg. stretches of
50-100 amino acids containing ≥10% cysteine residues),
as this feature is commonly shared by many toxin
sequences [67]. The survey proved fruitless. Further
attempts to enlarge the toxin dataset by searching specific databases, such as the Animal Toxin Database [68]
or MEROPS [69], were also unsuccessful. The venom
protein families identified, and their relative abundance,
in the whole 454 read sequence dataset are listed in
Table 1. The relative distribution of these venom protein families among the eight taxa investigated is shown
in Table 2.
Among the proteins listed in Table 1, glutaminyl
cyclase (GC) belongs to the group of venom proteins
without demonstrated toxic activity. Glutaminyl cyclase
has been been identified in the venom proteomes of

B. jararaca, C. atrox, and C. durissus terrificus [70-72].
N-terminal pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (pyroglutamate,
pGlu) formation from its glutaminyl (or glutamyl) precursor is required in the maturation of numerous bioactive peptides. Snake venom GC is likely involved in the
biosynthesis of pyroglutamyl peptides such as hypotensive BPPs [73,74], and endogenous inhibitors of
metalloproteinases, pEQW, pENW, and pEKW [75,76].
Accumulation of peptide inhibitors in venoms provides
a basis for attenuating the proteolytic activity of venom
gland-stored SVMPs, preventing thereby autodigestion
[77]. Mature PIII-SVMPs secreted into the venom proteome usually contain an N-terminal pyroglutaminyl
residue (unpublished results), suggesting the action of
the glutaminyl cyclase downstream of the proteolytic
processing of the metalloproteinase precursor. However,
the structural/functional consequences of N-terminal
cyclation are unknown.
To estimate the number of toxin transcript sequences
expressed in each transcriptome, multiple alignments of
all reads clustered in the same protein family were generated, using the most similar full-length reference
sequence as template. It was then realized that a large
number of “Serpentes venom protein” reads did not
align with translated ORFs. Instead, these reads
appeared to represent 5’UTR, 3’UTR, and microsatellite
loci. Particularly, all reads matching “cobra venom factor”, “crotamine”, “crotasin”, and “sarafotoxin” entries
corresponded to non-translated, mostly (87-100%)
microsatellite DNA. In addition, 2397 out of 2412 reads
for ohanin, and 840/845 3FTx reads aligned with microsatellite DNA. Microsatellite sequences accounted also
for 66% GF, 49% SP, 36% PLA2, 27% CRISP, 15% LAO,
and 8% CTL, but represented less than 5% of the reads
of the rest of venom protein classes listed in Table 2
and Additional file 1: Table S3. On the other hand, the
bulk (> 99%) of non-microsatellite untranslated
sequences corresponded to 3’ UTRs. Additional file 1:
Table S3 summarizes the number of reads aligned to
translated regions of reference snake venom toxin
sequences. The occurrence of a large number of microsatellites in the venomous snake Agkistrodon contortrix
has been recently reported by Castoe and colleagues
[78], who used the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX nextgeneration sequencing platform to sample randomly
~27 Mbp (128,773 reads) of the genome of this species.
These authors identified microsatellite loci in 11.3% of
all reads obtained, with 14612 microsatellite loci identified in total.
The presence of mRNA coding for 3’-untranslated
regions of toxins points to a) a bias due to the first-strand
synthesis method used, which produced cDNA libraries
enriched in 3’-end-transcripts, b) incompletely sequenced
transcripts or c) to transcription of nonfunctional gene

Fry and colleagues [79] have shown that the venom system is a basal characteristic of the advanced snakes, and
have investigated the timing of toxin recruitment events
and patterns of toxin diversification across the full range
of the ~100 million-year-old advanced snake clade
[2,3,5,6,79]. These studies revealed single early recruitment events for each toxin type, including those identified here (Table 1), indicating that the venomous
function arose once in squamate reptile evolution, at
about 200 Myr ago. Structural and functional diversification of the venom system is best described by the birthand-death model of protein evolution [80,81]. Pseudogenes in Costa Rican pitviper venom transcriptomes may
thus represent relics of the evolution of their venom
arsenal.
The 37,961 reads comprising non-venom-protein
BLAST hits were classified based on the presumed biological process to which they may contribute (Figure
1A) and on their putative molecular function (Figure
1B), according to the Gene Ontology database [48].
Their relative abundance, biological processes (general

metabolism, response to external stimuli, cell differentiation, proliferation, and communication, cell cycle...), and
molecular functions (transcription and translation, protein binding, catalysis, etc.) identified in this work generally agree with the broad categories reported for other
viperid transcriptomes [27,32,52,53,82-84], and will not
be described here in detail again. The most abundant
transcripts are related to DNA transcription, mRNA
translation, and post-translational processing of proteins,
reflecting the high specialization of this tissue for
expressing and secreting toxins to the lumen of the
venom gland. Furthermore, many venom toxins bear a
high number of cysteinyl residues, which are engaged in
extensive intra- and intermolecular disulphide crosslinking [20]. Venom proteins such as disintegrins, C-type
lectin-like proteins, serine proteinases, PLA2 s, 3FTxs,
and SVMPs occur in different oligomerization states
[85-88]. The large structural impact at low energy cost
of engineering disulphide bonds represents an opportunity for structural (and functional) diversification of proteins during evolution. Not surprisingly, protein
disulphide isomerase (PDI), an enzyme and chaperone
involved in disulphide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum [89,90], represents a highly expressed
gene transcript (1859 reads; 5.1% of non-venom-protein
reads) in all venom gland transcriptomes, ranging from
2.3% in C. simus to 6.9% in B. lateralis.

Figure 1 Gene Ontology annotation of the non-toxin Serpentes reads according to their presumed biological process (panel A) and
molecular function (panel B). The figure represents the combination of the reads from all eight species. However, each species transcriptome
exhibited similar relative expression levels of GO-annotated non-toxin transcript classes.

It is also worth mentioning the finding of reads for
ribosomal 12S and 16S RNAs. This finding suggests that
either internal mRNA A-rich tracts may have acted as
priming sites in the cDNA synthesis, or that these messengers contained poly(A) tails. The possibility that
rRNAs represent some residual contamination in the
mRNA preparation should also be taken into account.
Although polyadenylation is a distinctive feature of
mRNA, polyadenylation of rRNA has been reported to
occur in mammals and several unicellular organisms
(Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Leishmania braziliensis and L. donovani), and it may have a
quality control role in rRNA degradation [91-94]. Polyadenylated ribosomal RNA has been also reported in the
venom gland transcriptome of the Desert Massasauga
Rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii) [95].

short average length of singletons and contigs (174-208
bp), and the low coverage of reads per contig (6), prevented the generation of full-length gene sequences,
each line of the alignment corresponds to one or more
synthetic gene. We considered two contigs as different if
their nucleotide sequences depart in more number of
positions than expected from a sequencing error rate of
1.35%, and the same mutated residues were found in at
least two other reads. For each toxin family from each
venom gland transcriptome a representation of the
“number of reads per contig” vs. “number of contigs”
was plotted, and only contigs accounting for ~95% of all
assembled reads were considered. The rationale for

Calculation of the minimum number of gene copies from
each toxin family

An estimation of the minimum number of genes from
each toxin family transcribed into the venom gland transcriptome of each species was calculated from the multiple alignments of reads matched to a full-length
reference sequence of each toxin family (Figure 2). To
this end, the nucleotide sequences of the ORF-coding
reads of each venom protein family were assembled into
contigs using MIRA and an iterative multiple-pass reference-guided protocol. MIRA is recommended for analysis of a normalized dataset or a filtered set of reads that
did not have extreme coverage [64]. Each line of the
multiple alignment (Figure 2) contained a distinct set of
contigs spanning the maximum possible number of
nucleotide positions of the reference sequence. Since the

Multiple alignment of the top six SVMP transcripts of B. asper (Car)

similar database-annotated toxin sequence as template. Each line of
the multiple sequence alignment displays a distinct set of contig(s),
comprised by a unique set of reads indicated in parentheses (see
also Additional file 1: Table S5). Since the short average length of
the reads and the low coverage of reads per contig prevented the
assemblage of reliable gene sequences, each line of the alignment
corresponds to at least a distinct gene of the SVMP multigene
family translated into the venom gland transcriptome of B. asper
(car).

concordance with a recent high-throughput venom
pland transcriptomic analysis for the Eastern Diamond
Rattlesnake (C. adamanteus), which identified 40 unique
toxin transcript [40]. The most diverse and highly
expressed toxin classes were the SVMPs (11 isoforms),
serine proteinases and C-type lectin-like proteins (9 different protein species each).
The insight provided by our present transcriptomic
data, supported by previous proteomic studies, indicate
that the venoms of the Costa Rican snakes investigated
are comprised by toxins belonging to a few major protein families. In addition, our data suggest that different
genes of a multigene family are subjected to very distinct transcription (and translation) yields, i.e. as the
result of distinct stability and translational rates of the
messengers.

introducing this quality trimming is because in this way
only contigs in which the observed sequence differences
were validated in a significant number of reads were
taken into account, eliminating thus potential false positives due to sequencing errors, which generate “orphan”
reads. The number of topologically equivalent homologous multiply-aligned reads corresponds thus to the
minimum number of genes from a given toxin family
transcribed into the venom gland transcriptome (Figure
2). The outcome of this analysis is displayed in Table 3.
The estimated number of toxin-coding genes is in line
with the number of different proteins identified in the
respective venom proteomes: C. simus (27 reverse-phase
HPLC fractions, ~20 proteins) [52]; B.asper (Car) (31
HPLC fractions, ~30 proteins) [51]; B. asper (Pac)
(30 HPLC fractions, ~27 proteins) [51]; A. mexicanus
(41 HPLC fractions) and A. picadoi (30 HPLC fractions),
each containing bradykinin-potentiating peptides and
around 25-27 proteins [50]; and B. schlegelii (34 HPLC
fractions) and B. lateralis (34 HPLC fractions) matched
to ~29 and 27 proteins, respectively [49]. Moreover, in
most cases the overwhelming majority of reads of the
large multigene toxin families (i.e., SVMP, PLA 2 , and
SP) cluster into a small subset of contigs (Additional file
1: Tables S5, S6 and S7). The uneven distribution of
SVMPs of B. asper (Car) (Figure 3) clearly illustrates
this point: 3590 out of 6746 reads clustered into a single
contig, and only 6 other contigs were assembled from
449-173 reads. The remaining 22 transcripts comprised
each 95-12 reads. The low number of venom proteins
inferred from our 454 transcriptomic analysis is also in

Comparison of transcriptomes and proteomes

The relative abundance of the different toxin families in
each transcriptome was calculated as the percentage of
toxin family-specific reads relative to all BLAST hits
(Table 2) or to the set of reads aligned to translated
(ORF) regions of a reference sequences (Additional file
1: Table S3). To estimate the relative contribution of
each toxin family, the total number of nucleotides of the
ORF-coding reads was normalized for the full-length
nucleotide sequence of a canonical member of the protein family. When available, the obtained figures were
compared with the percentages of toxin families
reported for the venom proteome of the same species.
The outcome of this comparative analysis is compiled in

Figure 3 Cartesian graph and corresponding chart pie
displaying the uneven distribution of the number of reads per
contig among the 29 SVMP genes identified in the venom
gland transcriptome of B. asper (car).

Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4. Strong discrepancies
between the transcriptome-computed and the proteome-gathered toxin compositions are obvious at first
sight. The best, although still far from perfect, agreement between proteomic and transcriptomic data
occured when the relative abundance of transcripts was
computed using all the reads (ORFs + UTRs) belonging
only to toxin classes detected in the venom proteome
(Figure 4). This would support the view that the majority of reads matching UTRs may indeed form part of
parent translatable mRNAs. However, particularly
B. asper (Car) (Figure 4A), B. schlegelii (Figure 4B),
A. mexicanus (Figure 4C), and C. simus (Figure 4D)
strongly depart from this picture. The reasons underlying this discrepancy are elusive, since no clear trend
within or between species is apparent, but both intrinsic
(methodological) and extrinsic (biological) factors may
be involved. Hence, besides the difficulty of deciding
between bias due to cDNA libraries enriched in 3’-endtranscripts, and the presence of transcripts of pseudogenes in the transcriptome, we hypothesize that the distinct stability and translational rates of the messengers
might also contribute to the observed differences
between transcriptome and proteome. Thus, a high
abundant messenger subjected to a higher degradation
rate may produce the same concentration as a low
abundance but more stable mRNA or exhibiting a
higher translational rate. The observation that B. asper
(Car) and B. asper (Pac), as well as A. mexicanus and
A. picadoi, exhibit highly similar transcriptomes but

Page 8 of 16

strongly depart in the relative toxin composition of their
venom proteomes (Figure 4), indicates that individual
mRNA species are translationally controlled in a species-dependent manner. The same conclusion can be
drawn by comparing the proteome and transcriptome of
C. simus (Figure 4D). In this respect, mounting evidences in yeast, indicate that the loading of ribosomes
onto individual mRNA species varies broadly across a
cellular transcriptome, and this finding is consistent
with each transcript having a uniquely defined efficiency
of translation [96-99].
A rough comparison of the transcriptomes (Table 2)
shows that some toxin families are relatively constantly
expressed among snakes while others exhibit greater
variability. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
revealed that the abscissa (PC1) and the ordinate (PC2)
each explained 32% of the observed variability (Figure
5A). PCA discriminated the eight transcriptomes into
four groups (Figure 5B). Referring to the average value
of the toxin family, the transcriptomes of A. picadoi and
B. lateralis contain higher content (⇑) of SVMP reads
and lower number (⇓) of PLA2 and SP reads; the two B.
asper taxa express ⇑SVMPs and PLA2s and ⇓ SPs; A.
mexicanus and C. godmani contain ⇑SVMPs, ⇑SPs, and
slightly ⇓PLA2s; and B. schlegelii and C. simus contain
⇓SVMPs, ⇑SPs, and average number (⇔) of PLA2 reads.
These data point to convergent and divergent evolutionary trends among pitvipers. PCA of the venom proteomes listed in Additional file 1: Table S4 revealed
different clustering of taxa (Figure 5, panels C and D),
and unequal contributions of PC1 (48%) and PC2 (22%)
to venom variability. These results illustrate the versatility of snake venoms as a system to achieve the purpose
of subduing prey through different strategies [100]. On
the other hand, the lack of any apparent correlation
between the PCA score plots for transcriptome (Figure
5B) and proteome (Figure 5D) data, further highlights
the existence of variable translational patterns across
species. Clearly, our results emphasize the relevance of
combining detailed proteomic and transcriptomic studies for a thorough characterization of the venom toxin
repertoire and the factors regulating transcription and
translation.
In a previous proteomic study, we identified two RPHPLC fractions of B. schlegelii venom as Kazal-type proteinase inhibitor-like proteins (family PD000417 in the
ProDom database, http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php) [49]. Kazal-type inhibitor-like proteins (KAZ) have not been found in any other snake
venom reported to date, casting doubts on their venom
gland origin, on the one hand, or pointing to a recruitment event of these proteins along the speciation of the
Neotropical pitviper clade [49]. Now we report the finding of 9 and 12 reads encoding ORF regions of KAZ in

B. schlegelii and B. lateralis transcriptomes, respectively
(Table 2 and Additional file 1: Table S4). In each species, all KAZ reads assembled into a single transcript
(Table 3), suggesting a monogenic origin. The occurrence of Kazal-type inhibitor-like proteins only in the
venom gland transcriptomes of the two Bothriechis taxa
(Additional file 1: Tables S4 and S5) supports the view
of a genus-specific recruitment event during the earlyMiddle Miocene ~14 Mya, the estimated divergence
time for Bothriechis in a model of Middle American
highland speciation [101]. On the other hand, the presence of Kazal-type proteins in the venom proteome of
B. schlegelii, the basal species of the Bothriechis clade
[102], suggests a species-specific expression of this class
of protein. Though a number of Kazal-like domains harbor serine proteinase inhibitor activity, these protein
scaffolds are also present in the extracellular part of a
number of proteins, which are not known to be

proteinase inhibitors. Clearly, further investigations are
needed to assess the biological activity of the Kazal-type
proteins, and the role that these proteins may have
played in the early adaptive radiation of the Bothriechis
clade.
Transcriptome-based cladistic analysis of the Costa Rican
snake venom gland transcriptomes

To assess structural relationships between the transcriptomes, consensus sequences were constructed for those
major toxin families shared by all snake venom gland
transcriptomes, i.e. BPP, LAO, PLA2, SVMP, and SP. To
assess the degree of kinship between the Costa Rican
snake venom gland transcriptomes, species-specific synthetic sequences were generated by the concatenation of
the 5 toxin-family consensus sequences (in the order
described above), and using these synthetic sequences as
input, a cladogram was built using the suite of web-

6). Mutation is the driving force of evolution, but inferring evolutionary distances from multiple sequence
alignments can yield misleading results if the mutation
rates of the genes being compared are unequal across
species. Given knowledge of the degree of mutation rate
heterogeneity, appropriate algorithms can be applied to
correct unbiasness and inaccuracy of the phylogenetic
reconstruction [103-105]. Globally, translated assembled

sequences displayed mean variability levels between 0
and 7.4% (computed as number of variable residues
divided by sequence length), being the SVMPs and SPs
the toxin families which accumulate more amino acid
substitutions. Although the cladogram depicted in
Figure 6 should not be regarded as an evolutionary
hypothesis, the divergence of the Atropoides taxa, and
the clustering of A. mexicanus and C. godmani deserves
discussion.

sequences for SVMP, SP, BPP, LAO and PLA2 gathered from analysis of their venom gland transcriptomes. Numbers at branching points
indicate the degree of sequence divergence (0.1 = 10% sequence divergence).

Despite the efforts of numerous authors, phylogenetic
relationships within the subfamily Crotalinae remain
controversial, particularly at the intergeneric level
[100,105]. In particular, several analyses, even from the
same research group, support different phylogenetic
models. Thus, Bayesian Markov chain Monte-Carlo
results suggested the monophyly of the three genera of
the Porthidium group (Atropoides, Cerrophidion, and
Porthidium) and indicated that Cerrophidion and Porthidium form a clade that is the sister taxon to Atropoides
[106]. On the other hand, genus Atropoides has been
also inferred through Bayesian phylogenetic methods to
be paraphyletic with respect to Cerrophidion and Porthidium, due to Atropoides picadoi being distantly related
to other Atropoides species [107,108]. Although resolving the phylogenetic relationships among the Neotropical pitvipers of the Porthidium group requires a detailed
genomic study of species occupying geographically close
ecological niches, i.e., Porthidium nasutum, Porthidium
ophryomegas, Porthidium volcanicum, and Cerrophidion
godmani, both a previous proteomic study by Angulo
and co-workers [50], who estimated that the similarity
of venom proteins between the two Atropoides taxa
may be around 14-16%, and the present transcriptomic
analysis, support a large divergence between A. mexicanus and A. picadoi, and the closer kinship between A.
mexicanus and C. godmani.

remain elusive, gene duplication events, followed by the
accelerated evolution of some copies and degradation of
others to pseudogenes, underlay the emergence of venom
gland multigene toxin families. Comparative analysis of
complete genome sequences of squamate reptiles would
be extremely valuable for tracking the evolution of the
venom system in lizards and snakes [5,6]. On the other
hand, a deep understanding of the toxin gene expression
pattern revealed by high-throughput transcriptomic may
reveal taxon-specific adaptations and the underlying biological processes governing the formulation of the venom
arsenal. In this respect, invoking a reverse venomics
approach, knowledge of the end product of transcriptome
translation, the venom proteome, may provide hints on
the translation efficiency of toxin-coding transcripts. The
high-throughput capability of next-generation sequencing
technologies offer the opportunity to generate large transcriptome databases relatively rapidly, which may help to
speed up the tedious, often de novo [20], assignment of
proteomic-gathered data. Furthermore, analysis of the
venom gland transcriptome enhances the comprehensibility of the venom proteome, and this in turn contributes to
a more accurate interpretation of the transcriptome. The
application of NGS to the analysis of snake venom transcriptomes, may represent the tool for opening the door
to systems venomics.

Methods
Conclusions
The snake venom gland is a highly specialized and sophisticated organ, which harbors the cellular machinery that
transformed throughout > 200 million years of evolution
genes coding for ordinary proteins of disparate scaffolds,
diverse ancestral bioactivities, and recruited from a wide
range of tissues, into lethal toxins [2]. Although the details

Snake venom gland cDNA synthesis and sequencing

Venom glands were removed 3 days after venom milking, when transcription is maximal [109], from anesthetized snakes using fine forceps and immediately placed
in RNAlater™ solution (Qiagen). 30 mg of tissue were
disrupted and homogenized by a rotor-stator homogenizer, and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen), quantified in a spectrophotometer, and

Durban et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:259

quality-checked on an agarose gel discerning the 28S
and 18S bands of ribosomal RNA. First strand cDNA
was synthesized using RevertAid™ H Minus First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas), which selectively transcribes full-length polyadenylated mRNA. The
manufacturer’s recommendations were followed except
where specified. Approximately 5 μg of total RNA was
used as starting material. In order to avoid polymerase
slippage, a modified 3’ 54-mer adaptor (5’ GAGCTAGTTCTGGAG(T) 16 VN), which includes a type IIs
enzyme (GsuI) site (underlined), was used for firststrand synthesis. This modified oligonucleotide effectively converts the long run of adenosine residues at the
polyA tail into a sequence that causes fewer problems
for dideoxy sequencing chemistry, and thus the resulting
cDNA libraries were enriched in 3’-end-transcripts. To
avoid internal cuts, the cDNA was hemimethylated by
adding 5-methyl-dCTP to the dNTPs mix. The first
strand cDNA was used as template for second strand
synthesis by E. coli DNA Polymerase I and RNase H.
Double strand (ds) cDNA was precipitated with ethanol
and the pellet was resuspended in 70 μL of nucleasefree water and subjected to enzymatic digestion with
GsuI for 4 hours at 30°C. The enzyme was then inactivated at 65°C for 20 minutes and the digested cDNA
was stored at -20°C. For 454 pyrosequencing, the GS
FLX General Library Preparation Method Manual workflow (Roche Diagnostics) was followed. To this end, 3
μg of final non-normalized cDNA library were sheared
by nebulization into small fragments. The fragment ends
were polished and short A/B adaptors were ligated onto
both ends, providing priming regions to support both
emulsion amplification and the pyrosequencing process.
A biotin tag on the B adaptor allowed immobilization of
the dscDNA library fragments onto streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads and the subsequent isolation of
the library of single strand cDNA sequencing templates.
Each of the eight cDNA libraries was tagged with a
unique 10-base sequence (MID, Multiplex IDentifier)
that is recognized by the sequencing analysis software,
allowing for automated sorting of MID-containing reads.
Barcoded libraries were simultaneously sequenced in a
Genome sequencing FLX System (Roche Applied
Science) at Life Sequencing S.L. (Parc Científic Universitat de Valencia, Paterna, Valencia, Spain; http://www.

databases, and elaborate a reference-guide estimation of
transcripts, which included available NGS algorithms
and in-house scripts. To this end, interspersed repeats
and low complexity DNA sequences were masked from
the transcript reads using RepeatMasker (version 3.2.7)
[111]. RepeatMasker is available from the Institute for
Systems Biology (http://www.systemsbiology.org) addressing http://repeatmasker.org. The program makes use of
Repbase, which is a service of the Genetic Information
Research Institute (http://www.girinst.org). Repbase is a
comprehensive database of repetitive element consensus
sequences (update of 20 January 2009). Data and computational resources for the Pre-Masked Genomes page
is provided courtesy of the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics group (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Masked reads
were then searched against the non-redundant NCBI
database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, release of March
2009) and the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Toxin Annotation
Program database (http://us.expasy.org/sprot/tox-prot),
using BlastX and BlastN [112] algorithms, specifying a
cut-off value of e-03 and BLOSUM62 as scoring matrix.
Snake venom gland-specific transcripts were selected
from best BLAST-hit descriptions identifying GenBank
entries belonging to the taxonomic suborder Serpentes.
This taxonomic group is represented by 37,070 records
comprising entries from 357 different genera. The subset of reads exhibiting similarity to Serpentes sequences
were further filtered using a list of keywords (including
the acronyms of all known toxin protein families
described so far [20,25]) to distinguish putative snake
venom toxins from non-toxin (ribosomal, mitochondrial,
nuclear, etc.), ordinary proteins. In a second round of
filtering, non-matched sequences were searched for
structural features (eg. high cysteine content) expected
for a putative toxin molecule. Non-toxin-assigned transcripts were functionally annotated using the Blast2GO
software [113] and classified using GO-terms [114]. The
relative expression of a given toxin protein family (mol
%) was calculated as the number of reads assigned to
this protein family (R i ) normalized by the length (in
nucleotides) of the reference transcript sequence
(ntREF) and expressed as the % of total reads in the
snake transcriptome (∑Reads): mol% toxin family “i” =
%[(R i /ntREF)/∑Reads). The relationship between the
expression levels of the different protein families in the
different species sampled was analyzed by Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). When possible, toxin transcriptome profiles were compared with available proteomic-based venom toxin profiles [115-118].
Assessing molecular diversity within toxin families and
cladistic analysis

To assess the molecular diversity within each toxin
family, the phylogenetically nearest top-hit sequence was

Durban et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:259
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/259

designated as the reference sequence for aligning all the
toxin family-specific reads. To this end, each toxin
family read was translated into the 6 possible reading
frames and blasted against the reference protein
sequence using tBlastN. Matched frames exhibiting evalue thresholds better than e-03 were aligned onto
the reference sequence to create a multiple alignment
using COBALT [119]. The multiple alignment was
then parsed to create an assembled (consensus) toxin
sequence in which each amino acid position is supported by at least four reads, representing at least 30%
of the total number of reads at that position. Nonsequenced positions or those that did not meet the
minimum coverage condition, are depicted in lower
case in the assembled sequences. Positions where two
or more amino-acids fulfilled the selection criteria
were annotated as variable residues suggesting the
occurrence of different alleles (isoforms) of the protein.
Multiple sequence alignments based on transcriptomic
data were computed with program MUSCLE [120]
(version 3.52) using species-specific synthetic
sequences constructed by the concatenation of the
consensus sequences of the major toxin families shared
by all snake venom gland transcriptomes, i.e. BPP,
LAO, PLA2, SVMP, and SP, in this order. Phylogenetic
tree reconstruction was done using the suite of webtools Phylemon (http://phylemon.bioinfo.cipf.es/cgibin/tools.cgi) using the MUSCLE, ProtDist and Neighbor options of Phylip (version 3.65).
