Novel intron markers to study the phylogeny of
closely related mammalian species
Javier Igea1, Javier Juste2, Jose Castresana1*

Abstract
Background: Multilocus phylogenies can be used to infer the species tree of a group of closely related species. In
species trees, the nodes represent the actual separation between species, thus providing essential information
about their evolutionary history. In addition, multilocus phylogenies can help in analyses of species delimitation,
gene flow and genetic differentiation within species. However, few adequate markers are available for such studies.
Results: In order to develop nuclear markers that can be useful in multilocus studies of mammals, we analyzed the
mammalian genomes of human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog and cow. Rodents were excluded due to their
unusual genomic features. Introns were extracted from the mammalian genomes because of their greater genetic
variability and ease of amplification from the flanking exons. To an initial set of more than 10,000 one-to-one
orthologous introns we applied several filters to select introns that belong to single-copy genes, show neutral
evolutionary rates and have an adequate length for their amplification. This analysis led to a final list of 224 intron
markers randomly distributed along the genome. To experimentally test their validity, we amplified twelve of these
introns in a panel of six mammalian species. The result was that seven of these introns gave rise to a PCR band of
the expected size in all species. In addition, we sequenced these bands and analyzed the accumulation of
substitutions in these introns in five pairs of closely related species. The results showed that the estimated genetic
distances in the five species pairs was quite variable among introns and that this divergence cannot be directly
predicted from the overall intron divergence in mammals.
Conclusions: We have designed a new set of 224 nuclear introns with optimal features for the phylogeny of
closely related mammalian species. A large proportion of the introns tested experimentally showed a perfect
amplification and enough variability in most species, indicating that this marker set can be very helpful in
multilocus phylogenetics of mammals. Due to the lower variability and stronger stochasticity of nuclear markers
with respect to mitochondrial genes, studies should be designed to make use of several markers like the ones
designed here.

Background
Phylogenetic analyses of closely related species are
affected by specific problems that are different from
those present in phylogenies of more distant species [1].
The first and most obvious difficulty is that nucleotide
sequences must have enough variability within
and among the studied species to obtain an adequate
resolution of the phylogenetic tree. For this reason,
mitochondrial genes, which show a high rate of nucleotide substitution, have been the main choice for the

reconstruction of phylogenetic trees at the genus and
family levels in all animals [2,3]. Another distinctive feature of the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related
species is that gene coalescence and the stochasticity
associated with population genetic processes must be
taken into account. For example, incomplete lineage
sorting may cause the gene tree to have a different
topology than the species tree [4-6]. This leads to the
necessity of using multiple, unlinked genes, together
with the integration of coalescent-based techniques, in
the reconstruction of the species tree [7-10]. Phylogenies
based on a broad representation of the genome can also
help in species delimitation or analyses of genetic variability. Therefore, in these approaches it is essential to

make use of the nuclear genome, where there are plenty
of unlinked genes. However, nuclear genes in animals
usually have much lower evolutionary rates than mitochondrial genes and, sometimes, they are not informative enough for assessing the variability within species
or for phylogenetic reconstruction. In addition, due to
the larger population size of nuclear genes with respect
to mitochondrial genes, the former are more affected by
coalescent stochasticity, so the necessity of using multiple genes is stronger [11,12]. Thus, the progress of multilocus phylogenetics requires, as a first step, an
important effort of developing unlinked nuclear markers
able to provide enough differences within and among
species [13].
Systematic efforts to find novel markers for phylogenetic studies have been performed in different groups of
organisms [14-21]. Markers selected include exons,
introns and intergenic regions. Exons show very little
variability for the phylogenies of closely related species,
whereas intergenic regions present difficulties for the
design of primers of wide-specificity. On the other hand,
introns are a part of the genome with large nucleotide
variability and, at the same time, they can be easily
amplified with primers placed in the adjacent exons
[20,22,23]. Thus, they are ideal candidates for multilocus
phylogenies of closely related species. However, not all
introns are equally valid for this task. Some introns are
highly conserved due to their involvement in certain
functions and they may not show enough differences
between closely related species [24,25]. In fact, introns
show a wide range of evolutionary rates. For example, a
comparison of human and mouse introns showed
genetic distances that ranged between 0.2 and 1.7 substitutions/site [26]. In addition, some introns show disparate rates of evolution in some lineages but not in
others [27], indicating an imperfect molecular clock that
may affect the measurement of genetic diversity in some
species. Different processes, such as a change in chromosome position of the gene or the development of a
new isoform by alternative splicing in certain lineages
[28], may cause such variations in the evolutionary
dynamics and thus in the molecular clock of the introns.
In mammals, introns have been mainly used to resolve
deep groupings but also to study more recent phylogenies [29-33]. However, no attempt has been made so far
to systematically select an optimal set of introns for
mammals. In this work, we have devised a protocol to
extract the best introns from the complete mammalian
genomes of five species: human, chimpanzee, macaque,
dog and cow [34-39]. We deliberately did not use the
available genomes of rodents (mouse and rat) because
they have genomic features that would have made the
comparisons of all mammals problematic. For example,
rodents have very attenuated isochors and show very

fast evolutionary rates when compared to other mammals [40,41]. This is also true for introns, as previously
shown [27]. The high evolutionary rates of rodent
introns can complicate the alignments, phylogenetic
reconstructions and measurement of genetic distances.
To avoid the same problems we also decided not to
include marsupials and monotremes. Thus, in this work
we concentrated on the analysis of non-rodent eutherian
genomes. From these genomes we obtained one-to-one
orthologues, constructed alignments and trees from
each individual intron and filtered out introns with
inadequate features for shallow phylogenies. In addition,
introns were selected to come from single-copy genes in
order to avoid multiple bands in PCR reactions, to have
an adequate length for PCR amplification, and to be surrounded by exons with enough space for primer design.
From the resulting introns, we selected a small set that
we used to experimentally verify that they work according to the expected features of ease of amplification and
high evolutionary rate. Finally, we studied the variability
of intron divergence in different species pairs.

Results and Discussion
Intron set acquisition

We extracted all introns smaller than 50,000 nucleotides
from the genomes of human, chimpanzee, macaque,
cow and dog, which comprise three mammalian orders
(Primates, Carnivora and Cetartiodactyla). The total
number of extracted introns per genome ranged
between 153,659 in the cow and 173,320 in the dog.
Using information from the ENSEMBL database, we
arrived at an initial set of 11,835 one-to-one orthologous
introns in the five mammalian species (Figure 1).
Most of these introns had an inadequate length for
their amplification and were therefore discarded in our
initial filtering processes. First, we restricted the intron
length in Homo sapiens to a minimum of 200 and a
maximum of 1600 nucleotides. Second, we controlled
for intron length conservation among the five species
used in this study, taking human as a referent and relaxing the constraints as the phylogenetic distance between
the compared species increased. After the application of
these size filters, 2750 introns remained. In addition, the
introns flanked by small exons (<40 nucleotides) were
discarded because the design of PCR primers could be
difficult in them. This filter affected 5.2% of the introns
available in the previous step.
Mammalian genomes have a large number of duplicated genes due to different gene or genome duplication
processes [42]. These genes constitute a severe problem
because primers could hybridize in a large number of
genomic places, giving rise to multiple PCR products.
Thus, a crucial step was to check for the duplication of
the introns using BLAST over the different genomes. In

particular lineages such as a change of function, a
change to a chromosome position with different evolutionary dynamics, alternative splicing, etc). That is, we
selected introns whose rates of evolution were similar to
the global genomic rate and therefore with a largely
neutral molecular clock in mammals. Furthermore, trees
with large branches in particular lineages may correspond to hidden paralogues that may have remained
undetected up to this point. These paralogues are very
problematic for estimations of evolutionary rates and
other parameters necessary for their use in phylogenetic
analyses. To detect this type of introns, we first constructed a global genomic tree from the concatenation
of all introns available at this step (Figure 2). This tree
was then used as a reference to assess if the phylogenetic tree of each individual intron had a rate of evolution similar to the global one in every lineage. This
calculation was performed with the K tree score measured by the Ktreedist software, which reflects the topological and relative differences in branch length between
a given tree and a reference tree [27]. That is, a high K
tree score is indicative of a tree that has some highly
accelerated or decelerated branches with respect to the
reference tree regardless of the overall tree divergence.
This score is also influenced by wrong topologies when
the affected branches are large. By setting an arbitrary K
tree score limit of 0.1 we removed approximately 34% of

fact, we performed the BLAST searches using the flanking exons instead of the introns because the exonic
sequences are easier to detect by BLAST, even in divergent genes [43]. Only those introns that had both flanking exons present just once in the five genomes were
considered to be single-copy. This step ruled out
approximately half of the remaining introns. At this
point, there were 1344 introns with a preliminary
orthology filter that can be used to study different evolutionary processes. However, for these introns to be
most useful in phylogenetic studies of closely related
species we applied several additional filters.
Next, we eliminated introns that were too accelerated
or decelerated in some lineages (and that could have
been affected by changes in evolutionary processes in

the introns that were most different in shape from the
global genomic tree.
The next step was designed to eliminate the most
conserved introns, which could be involved in some
function and are therefore not variable enough for the
phylogeny of closely related species. To do this, we
employed two different measures of divergence. First,
we calculated with the Ktreedist software the scaling
factor from each intronic phylogenetic tree to the global
genomic tree. This measure allowed us to discard the
introns that showed the slowest overall evolutionary
rates. Second, we calculated another measure of divergence, the primates total branch length, by using the
corresponding alignments and trees with only the three
primate species (human, chimpanzee and macaque).
This measure is more accurate and less affected by
alignment imperfections possibly generated when comparing sequences that are too divergent. We then
selected the introns that had a scaling factor lower than
1.15 and a primates total branch length higher than
0.075 substitutions per position. This rendered a dataset
of 225 introns that excluded the most conserved ones.
Finally, a visual inspection step was performed to
detect any poorly aligned sequences caused by wrong
annotations or clearly incorrect orthology assignments.
Only one intron had to be eliminated in this step. The
resulting final set was thus composed of 224 new phylogenetic markers (Figure 1). In the additional file 1 we
show all relevant information for each marker. This
includes the alignments of both the intron and the
flanking exons, the phylogenetic tree of the five mammals constructed with the intron sequences, and the
genomic location and function of the gene to which the
intron belongs. The examination of this information
allows the selection of optimal markers for specific purposes and the design of exon primers with different
degrees of specificity. Interestingly, one of the introns in
our final set turned out to be intron 1 of transthyretin
(TTR-1), which is one of the most widely used introns
in mammalian phylogenetics [44-48]. To our knowledge,
no other markers in our dataset have been used so far.
Analysis of genomic features of the new set of introns

The genomic location in Homo sapiens of each new
marker is represented in Figure 3. All the human chromosomes carry at least one intron in our set, except
chromosomes 21 and Y. The latter chromosome was
expected to be missing from our set because no
sequence for this chromosome was present in the available genome sequences of macaque, cow and dog.
Regarding the X chromosome, only one intron was present in the final set. The rest of X-linked introns were
discarded in the different filtering process, mainly in the
single-copy test and divergence filters steps.

Repetitive sequences present in the intron set were
analyzed with the RepeatMasker software. Of the 224
introns, 163 were found to contain repetitive elements.
The most frequent elements were SINEs, which were
present in 70% of the introns that bore any kind of element, followed by LINEs, which were found in 26% of
them. Introns with repeats had, on average, 18% of their
sequence corresponding to repetitive elements. These
types of repetitive sequences normally evolve in a neutral way, mostly by point mutations, and therefore their
presence is not a problem for sequence-based analysis
methods that assume a normal nucleotide substitution
model. If all species in the alignment have the repeat
(which is the normal situation in closely related species)
this fragment can be used normally as any other
sequence. When only some species have the repetitive
element (as it happened often in our set of five mammalian species), we observed that alignment programs do
not have problems dealing with these repetitive elements, and therefore the alignments can also be used
for further sequence or phylogenetic analyses.
More problematic are microsatellites (defined here as
two or more contiguous, approximate copies of a pattern of 1 to 6 nucleotides [49]). Since microsatellites
evolve by a slippage mechanism instead of by point
mutations [50], they cannot be used with phylogenetic
or coalescence methods that assume a normal point
substitution model. We checked for the presence of
microsatellites with the Tandem Repeats Finder program and found that 43 of the 224 introns had at least
one microsatellite in some species. Microsatellites are, in
general, specific for particular lineages, and their

presence in one species does not mean that the intron
cannot be used in other taxa. Therefore, introns with
some microsatellites were not eliminated from the data
set. However, when these sequences are found within
the introns in a species to be studied it may be better
not to use this intron and rather select a new one from
the set designed here. Alternatively, the positions
belonging to the microsatellites can be eliminated from
the alignment for further processing with sequence analysis programs that assume a point mutation mechanism
of evolution.

In order to test the degree of variability of the 224 final
introns with respect to the initial data sets, we estimated
the genetic distance between human and chimpanzee
for each intron. To do this, we constructed the alignments of the primate species (human, chimpanzee and
macaque), which could be used without further cleaning.
Then, we estimated the corresponding maximum-likelihood trees and measured the patristic distances between
human and chimpanzee. We then compared the distances obtained for the final set of 224 introns with the
sets corresponding to the different filtering processes
(Figure 4). The mean divergence between human and
chimpanzee was around 0.011 substitutions/position in
the three initial data sets: the size-constrained introns
set, the single-copy gene introns set, and the set
obtained after the application of the neutral evolution
test. As expected, after the application of the divergence
filter this distance increased, but only up to 0.014 substitutions/position. Thus, the overall gain in genetic distance in the final set was small. However, the main
effect of the divergence filters was the elimination of
highly conserved introns (as reflected in the relative
decrease of the first bar of the histograms in Figure 4d),
which could be involved in some important function
and would be practically useless for studies of closely
related species. Similarly, the analysis of human single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the introns of our
final set revealed that they had 4.35 SNPs on average. In
comparison, the set of 2750 size-constrained orthologous introns (see Figure 1) contained 3.19 SNPs on
average. When scaling these results by the length of
each intron to obtain the SNP density, the difference
between the means was still maintained: 0.0055 SNPs
per nucleotide for the final set of introns versus 0.0043
for the initial set. Thus, human SNPs also showed a
slight increase in the genetic variability of the introns in
the final set.
To compare the mean intronic genetic distance with
the divergence of cytochrome b, which is the most popular marker for mammalian phylogenetics [51], we

obtained the cytochrome b distance between human and
chimpanzee. To do this, we measured the patristic distance in a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree similarly reconstructed with human, chimpanzee and
macaque cytochrome b sequences obtained from GenBank [52]. The resulting distance was 0.169 substitutions/position, which implies that the final set of 224
introns has, on average, 12.1 times less divergence than
the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Furthermore,
alignments containing the exons flanking the 224
introns were constructed for the three primates, maximum likelihood trees were built as above, and the
resulting trees were used to calculate the distance
between Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes for both the
upstream and downstream exons of each intron. The
resulting mean genetic divergence was 0.006 substitutions/position, which implies that the 224 selected
introns have, on average, 2.3 more divergence than their
corresponding flanking exons.
Experimental validation of the newly developed
phylogenetic markers: Primer design and PCR
amplification

The intron filtering processes carried out above were
designed to select a set of optimal introns for the phylogeny of closely related mammalian species. However,
many unidentified factors may affect the amplification of
these introns in different species. To experimentally test
the real performance of these introns and the validity of
the designed bioinformatic analysis we randomly
selected twelve introns among the largest ones in the
final data set for sequencing in different mammals.
In order to design primers of wide spectrum, the
flanking exonic sequences already gathered (human,
chimpanzee, macaque, cow and dog) were complemented by (whenever possible) a few others from the
ENSEMBL database: horse (Equus caballus), Sumatran
orangutan (Pongo abelii), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus),
domestic cat (Felis catus), Northern tree shrew
(Tupaia belangeri), gray mouse lemur (Microcebus
murinus), African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana),
lesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi), ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and common shrew (Sorex araneus). These genomes mostly
corresponded to low-coverage genome projects but
many of them were valid for certain exons. Exonic
alignments, containing between 11 and 15 different
species, were constructed. These alignments allowed
us to design the 3â end of every primer in the most
conserved part of the exonic alignment. Degenerate
bases (up to a limit of 48 per primer) were used to
make the primers suitable for as many different mammalian species as possible.

Page 6 of 13

To test these primers, we used genomic DNA
extracted from six mammalian species: Iberian mousebat (Myotis escalerai), Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), snow leopard (Uncia uncia), tiger (Panthera
tigris), least weasel (Mustela nivalis), and European
polecat (Mustela putorius). This set included several closely related species in order to analyze their intronic
divergence. Table 1 shows the primers used and the
amplification results for this panel of species. Five out of
the 12 introns failed to produce a single, clean PCR
band of the expected size in one or more of the six analyzed species. This was due to several reasons, the main
one being PCR misamplification in the form of gel
smear. Some other problems were the excessive length
of the amplified band in some species or the generation
of double bands in the PCR reaction, which can reflect
the existence of gene duplications in a particular lineage
(Table 1). Some optimizations with different primers or
hybridization temperatures did not solve the problems
in these introns. The seven remaining introns did produce a clear single PCR band of the expected size in the
six chosen species. It should be noted that, even for the
successful primers, the annealing temperature had to be
optimized for different species. Moreover, there were a
few cases, namely SLC38A7-8 for Panthera tigris and
CARHSP-1 and PNPO-3 for Myotis escalerai, where
more specific primers had to be designed to improve
the PCR band. The PCR bands of these introns were
subsequently sequenced, and the sequences were compared to the known introns, which confirmed their correct amplification. In addition to the sequence of the
PCR band, the exact sequence of one allele for each specimen was obtained by cloning the sequenced PCR product in a plasmid vector.
We can conclude that a large part of the markers
tested were valid, with a minimum optimization, for a
wide variety of mammals. Of course, the success rate
will vary depending on the taxa of choice, but, to
increase the chances that a primer works, it is important
to take into account that this optimization may be
necessary in all pilot studies and may include the adjustment of the hybridization temperature or the modification of the primer specificity with a different degree of
degeneracy. In our experimental test of selected introns,
we designed primers of broad specificity so that they
could be used in a wide range of mammalian groups,
but primers intended for specific taxa need not be based
on such a variety of species and can have less degenerate bases. In addition to the species tested here, selected
to include pairs of closely related species, we have successfully amplified other intron markers from our data
set in other mammals, mainly belonging to Erinaceomorpha and Soricomorpha, as part of ongoing studies.
They also produced the expected PCR band and the

corresponding sequence, indicating again the usefulness
of this set of introns.
Use of the selected introns as markers for the phylogeny
of closely related species

The sequenced introns were added to the introns
already downloaded for human, chimpanzee, macaque,
dog and cow, and this set was complemented by three
additional genomes that had information for the seven
successful introns: the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), the horse (Equus caballus) and the little brown bat
(Myotis lucifugus). This extended species set allowed us
to assess the variability of our introns in five pairs of
closely related mammalian species, which comprised
four different mammalian families: Mustelidae, which
included Mustela nivalis and M. putorius, with an estimated divergence time of 2.8 million years [53]; Felidae,
with Panthera tigris and Uncia uncia, which diverged
2.9 million years ago [54]; Hominidae, which included
two pairs, namely, Pongo pygmaeus and P. abelii, with
3.8 million years of estimated divergence [55], and
Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes, with 6 million years
of estimated divergence [56]; and Vespertilionidae, with
Myotis lucifugus and M. escalerai, which diverged 12.2
million years ago [57].
All of the sequenced alleles for the seven introns were
different in both members of every pair of closely
related species, except, surprisingly, the PNPO-3
sequence obtained for Pongo pygmaeus, which was identical to the one downloaded from ENSEMBL for P. abelii. This can be due to several reasons such as a recent
introgression, the existence of a constraint in the evolution of this particular marker in the orangutan lineage
or the fact that, by mere chance, no mutations have
accumulated in any of the two species since their recent
divergence. All other intron pairs showed one or several

substitutions between the species pairs selected,
thus providing useful information for phylogenetic
reconstruction.
Alignments and the corresponding maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for each of
the seven intronic markers (Figure 5). The phylogenies
obtained were largely congruent with the known taxonomy of the species, particularly within each order, showing that these introns have normal evolutionary
dynamics, not only in the five species used for filtering
the introns, but also in other mammals. In addition, it is
interesting to note that we have four representative
orders (Carnivora, Chiroptera, Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla) within laurasiatherians that could help
resolve the phylogeny of this group. However, the relationships among them were different in each tree, and
the bootstrap values for the different clades were very
low (results not shown), indicating that individual
introns may not have enough information for inter-ordinal mammalian phylogenies [58-62]. It is also important
to observe that the trees estimated with the different
markers show very apparent differences in their overall
divergence. As can be seen from the scale of the trees,
the most extreme examples were GAD2-1 and OSTA-5,
which were the slowest introns, and JMJD5-2, which
was the intron with the fastest rate of evolution.
To analyze the differences in divergence among
introns in more detail, we constructed new alignments
for each pair of closely related species to avoid possible
problems associated with the alignments of more divergent taxa. We then estimated the intron genetic distance
between species pairs from the corresponding intron
pairwise alignment. Figure 6 compares the divergences
between species pairs for the different introns. As
expected, species pairs separated for longer times such
as the two Myotis species accumulate an overall higher

number of substitutions than the closest species such as
Panthera tigris and Uncia uncia. It can also be deduced
from this figure that there are important differences in
intron divergence in different species pairs, indicating
that it is not possible to predict that one intron with a
high number of variable positions in one lineage will be
equally variable in other lineages. For example, the most
informative introns for H. sapiens and P. troglodytes
would be CARHSP1-1 and OSTA-5 whereas for Mustela the best ones would be SLC38A7-8 and COPS7A-4.
Furthermore, the intron JMJD5-2, despite being the fastest one according to the overall divergence in mammals
(Figure 5), was not always the most variable between
sister species. Therefore, the most variable introns are
different for every lineage. This can be due to the stochasticity of mutations, which can specially affect to
short branches, and to differences in population size
and ancestral polymorphisms, which may constitute a
large part of the divergence among genes in closely
related species [13,63]. Thus, given the range of intron
variability of our data set (with all introns being quite
variable) it may not be worthwhile favoring introns with
high overall rates in mammals. Rather, it may be better
to use several unlinked introns to overcome different
stochastic processes in any phylogenetic study of closely
related species.

Conclusions
The development of multilocus phylogenetics requires
the availability of a large number of adequate markers
for different taxa. In this study, we have designed 224
intronic markers with optimal conditions for the phylogeny of closely related mammalian species (excluding
rodents, marsupials and monotremes). Among the
important criteria used to select these markers were that
they belonged to single-copy genes, were not highly
conserved, and did not show disparate rates of evolution
in different lineages. The experimental validation of
these introns showed that, after some optimizations,
they could be amplified in different mammalian species,

yielding a single PCR band. In addition, an analysis of
the genetic distances estimated in several pairs of closely
related mammalian species revealed that introns may
show different degrees of divergence in different pairs,
and that it is not possible to predict which introns will
be more variable in each group. In any case, it may be
necessary to carry out initial pilot studies with several
introns to decide which ones perform best for each species or group of closely related species. In addition, the
use of several introns will reduce the stochasticity associated to mutational and coalescence processes, which is
particularly large for nuclear sequences. The availability
of a large set of introns like the one provided here will
greatly facilitate this work.

Methods
Databases and filters

The following mammalian genomes were downloaded
from the ENSEMBL database [64] in GenBank format:
human (Homo sapiens) version NCBI 36 [36,39], chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) version Pan_troglodytes-2.1
[35], rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) version
Mmul_1 [38], dog (Canis familiaris) version CanFam2.0
[37] and cow (Bos taurus) version Btau_3.1 [34]. These
genomes are sequenced with high coverage and thoroughly annotated. There were also several low-coverage
genomes available, but their lack of many annotated features made their use in studies like the present one very
inconvenient [64,65]. The genome of the marsupial
Monodelphis domestica [66] was also available and well
annotated at the time this study was performed but we
decided not to include it to avoid problems with alignments and phylogenetic reconstruction due to its large
distance from the other mammalian species used. In
addition, the mouse and rat genomes, which are also
very divergent due to their peculiar genomic features
[40,41], were also excluded from this study.
We developed a pipeline of Perl scripts to extract all
the introns and exons of each mammalian genome
(Figure 1). At the same time, features like the gene

Igea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/369

description and the genomic location and length of
every intron and exon were stored. In this initial step,
introns of more than 50,000 nucleotides were discarded.
The ENSEMBL database includes orthology information obtained from a phylogenetic analysis, which makes
the determination of the orthology relationships more
accurate [64]. Therefore, we used this information to
determine preliminary one-to-one orthologous genes
between human, chimpanzee, macaque, dog and cow.
To achieve this, we downloaded orthology tables containing the whole list of one-to-one orthologous genes
between pairs of species. By crossing the information of
the human-chimpanzee and human-macaque pairs we
obtained a set of one-to-one orthologous genes for primates. From the table of dog and cow we obtained the
corresponding set of orthologues for laurasiatherians.
Finally, we crossed these two tables to obtain a set of
putative one-to-one orthologous genes for the five considered species. The corresponding lists of introns were
then assembled from this table. In addition, only those
introns belonging to genes with equal numbers of
introns and whose relative position inside the corresponding gene was conserved in every compared species
were considered to be true one-to-one orthologues.
The size variation of each intron across the studied
species was also controlled. To do this, the maximum
difference in length allowed between human and chimpanzee, human and macaque, human and cow, human
and dog, and cow and dog was established at 10%, 20%,
100%, 100% and 50%, respectively.
Multiple alignments of the orthologous intronic
sequences were built using MAFFT version 5.8 [67].
Gblocks version 0.91 [68] was used with relaxed parameters [69] to discard poorly aligned positions. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed
using PhyML version 2.4.4, with the GTR model of evolution and four substitution rate categories [70].
To detect duplicated genes, BLAST searches [71] of
the pair of flanking exons were performed for every
intron. For each species, the exons were used as query
against its own genome. The e-value limit was set at
10-4. We selected only the introns with exons that produced a single hit (itself) against one region of the genome. Since each genome is subdivided into large
fragments, normally chromosomes, we checked that
every single hit was also composed of a single subalignment and therefore corresponded to a single exon.
A reference tree reflecting the global genomic evolution was constructed using all single-copy introns. To
do so, the 1344 intron alignments that passed the
BLAST filter were concatenated to generate an alignment of 768,745 positions. This alignment was used to
build a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree using
RaxML version 2.4.4, which can handle big alignments

Page 10 of 13

[72]. Phylogenetic trees of every individual intron were
compared to this reference tree using the K tree score
implemented in the Ktreedist program [27].
Repetitive sequences present in the final set of introns
were analyzed with the program RepeatMasker version
3.2.8 using the corresponding library for each species
[73]. The intron sequences were also scanned for microsatellites with Tandem Repeats Finder version 4.04 [49]
using the following program parameters: 2 7 7 80 10 50
6. Moreover, the presence of human SNPs in these
introns was analyzed using information obtained from
the ENSEMBL database. To do this, the whole list of
annotated intronic SNPs of the NCBI 36 version of the
Homo sapiens genome was downloaded using the Biomart platform [74], and the corresponding SNPs were
mapped in our set of introns.
Samples and laboratory procedures

Samples of six mammalian species spanning different orders
were obtained. The chosen species were the Iberian mousebat (Myotis escalerai); the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), obtained from the INPRIMAT Consortium and the
Biomedical Primate Research Centre in Rijswijk; the snow
leopard (Uncia uncia) and the tiger (Panthera tigris),
obtained from the Animal Tissue Bank of Catalunya; and
the least weasel (Mustela nivalis) and the European polecat
(Mustela putorius), obtained from Collection of Tissues and
DNA of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales.
DNA extractions were performed using the DNEasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGen), following manufacturerâs instructions. PCR reactions were carried out in
25 Î¼l of final reaction volume, containing 50 - 100 ng of
template DNA, 0.5 - 1 Î¼M of each primer, and 0.75
units of Promega GoTaq. Amplification conditions were
as follows: initial denaturation at 95Â°C for 5 minutes,
followed by 28 to 35 cycles comprising 30 seconds of
denaturation at 95Â°C, 30 seconds of annealing at 52-65Â°
C (this temperature turned out to be highly variable
among different species and introns and had to be
adjusted for each particular case) and extension at 72Â°C
for 30-60 seconds. The resulting PCR products were
loaded in 1% agarose gels stained with SYBR Safe DNA
Gel Stain (Invitrogen). Bands were manually excised
from the gel and subsequently purified using Illustra
GFX PCR and DNA Gel Band Purification Kit
(GE Healthcare). The resulting products were then
sequenced using different sequencing services. Both heterozygous point mutations and indels that caused difficulties in assigning a clear sequence to each allele of the
individuals were observed in several sequences. Therefore, we cloned each PCR product into the pstBlue-1
vector (Invitrogen) to be able to isolate one of the
alleles. The plasmid containing one of the alleles was
isolated from the bacterial cultures, purified using the

Igea et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/369

GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma Aldrich), and
subsequently sequenced. Resulting sequences were analyzed using Geneious version 4.5.5 [75]. To correct the
errors induced by the polymerase and evidenced in the
cloning process, both the PCR product and its corresponding cloned sequence were assembled. Intron
sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers HM147892-HM147933.
Phylogenetic analyses of the new markers

For each successfully amplified and sequenced intron, a
new multiple sequence alignment was created containing
the six newly obtained sequences plus further sequences
from ENSEMBL. As above, MAFFT was used to build
these alignments, which were then cleaned using Gblocks
with the same parameters as above. We constructed the
phylogenetic trees using PhyML with the GTR model of
evolution and four substitution rate categories. In addition, for each of these introns we analyzed the divergence
for five pairs of closely related species. To do this, we
constructed new pairwise intronic alignments for each
species pair using MAFFT as above, but without applying
Gblocks, and estimated maximum-likelihood distance
using PAUP [76] with the GTR substitution model.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Final set of 224 introns selected for the phylogeny
of closely related mammalian species. The first page of each intron
lists the following information: description (function of the gene to
which the intron belongs), gene name according to the HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (in parenthesis), intron number, chromosome
where it is located in Homo sapiens, intron start (the location of the first
base of the intron in the corresponding human chromosome), human
intron length, intron alignment length (size of the alignment of the five
species: human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, dog and cow), flanking
exons length (the size of both the upstream and the downstream exons
that flank this intron in Homo sapiens), SNP density (the number of single
nucleotide polymorphisms described for human in this intron divided by
its length), K tree score (a calculation that reflects topological and rate
divergence of the intronic tree with respect to the genomic reference
tree), scaling factor (the value that shows the global divergence of the
intronic tree with respect to the genomic reference tree), humanchimpanzee distance in substitutions per position (the maximumlikelihood distance between the introns of Homo sapiens and Pan
troglodytes measured in the primates phylogenetic tree), and total
primate branch length in substitutions per position (the sum of all the
branches of the corresponding phylogenetic tree built using only the
three available primate species). For the representation of the exon and
intron alignments, a few wrong definitions of intron ends and starts that
we found were manually corrected. The five-species alignments of both
upstream and downstream exons are represented, but only the 160
bases closest to the intron are displayed. To help assess sequence
conservation, positions with more than 50% identities are highlighted.
The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the intron for the five
species is also shown. The root was placed at 7% of the branch
separating primates and laurasiatherians (coinciding with the midpoint of
the global genomic tree). The second page of each intron shows the
five-species alignment of the intron. Introns are ordered in this
document by total primate branch length.
