eastern Himalayas

Abstract
Background: Pleistocene climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity observed in many
extant species. In montane habitats, species’ ranges may have expanded and contracted along an altitudinal
gradient in response to environmental fluctuations leading to alternating periods of genetic isolation and
connectivity. Because species’ responses to climate change are influenced by interactions between species-specific
characteristics and local topography, diversification pattern differs between species and locations. The eastern
Himalayas is one of the world’s most prominent mountain ranges. Its complex topography and environmental
heterogeneity present an ideal system in which to study how climatic changes during Pleistocene have influenced
species distributions, genetic diversification, and demography. The Elliot’s laughing thrush (Garrulax elliotii) is largely
restricted to high-elevation shrublands in eastern Himalayas. We used mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites to
investigate how genetic diversity in this species was affected by Pleistocene glaciations.
Results: Mitochondrial data detected two partially sympatric north-eastern and southern lineages. Microsatellite
data, however, identified three distinct lineages congruent with the geographically separated southern, northern
and eastern eco-subregions of the eastern Himalayas. Geographic breaks occur in steep mountains and deep
valleys of the Kangding-Muli-Baoxin Divide. Divergence time estimates and coalescent simulations indicate that
lineage diversification occurred on two different geographic and temporal scales; recent divergence, associated
with geographic isolation into individual subregions, and historical divergence, associated with displacement into
multiple refugia. Despite long-term isolation, genetic admixture among these subregional populations was
observed, indicating historic periods of connectivity. The demographic history of Garrulax elliotii shows continuous
population growth since late Pleistocene (about 0.125 mya).
Conclusion: While altitude-associated isolation is typical of many species in other montane regions, our results
suggest that eco-subregions in the eastern Himalayas exhibiting island-like characteristics appear to have
determined the diversification of Garrulax elliotii. During the Pleistocene, these populations became isolated on
subregions during interglacial periods but were connected when these expanded to low altitude during cooler
periods. The resultant genetic admixture of lineages might obscure pattern of genetic variation. Our results provide
new insights into sky island diversification in a previously unstudied region, and further demonstrate that
Pleistocene climatic changes can have profound effects on lineage diversification and demography in montane
species.

Background
Climatic oscillations over the past few million years have
had profound effects on the demography of, and patterns and levels of genetic diversity in, many extant species [1-4]. Temperate taxa inhabiting alpine habitats
often shift their ranges along an altitudinal gradient in
response to climatic changes. Therefore, populations on
different mountains may experience alternating periods
of isolation and connectivity [2-5]. Periods of isolation
may result in genetic divergence among populations,
whereas periods of connectivity allow for dispersal and
gene flow [1,2]. Because species’ responses to climate
change are influenced by interactive factors including
ecology, demography and local topography, the pattern
and tempo of diversification may differ between taxa
and from place to place [1-4]. For example, the amount
of time that populations are isolated and their effective
population size will determine whether they sort into
independent evolutionary lineages, whereas the level of
divergence and ecological characteristics of the species
often influence whether they remain distinct or merge
back into a common gene pool upon secondary contact
[2,6]. Studies of genetic diversification in alpine regions
are currently limited to a few areas [7-14]. Additional
research in other alpine regions is therefore required to
confirm the generality of existing hypotheses on how
Pleistocene climatic change affected species diversification and demography.
The eastern Himalayan mountain range, which has perhaps the most complex topography on Earth, offers an
unusual opportunity to study interactions among geography, climatic changes and diversification. These mountains rose rapidly with the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau
during the past three million years [15-18]. Mountains
are characterized as a series of parallel alpine ranges
climbing to altitudes over 5 000 m above sea level (m.a.s.
l.) with the differences in altitude from valley to mountaintops often exceeding 2 000 m.a.s.l. This broadly altitudinal range has created dramatic ecological
stratification and resulted in geographic isolation for
many taxa [19-21]. Tremendous variations in altitude, climate and vegetation may have created an archipelago of
high elevation sky islands [22,23]. The Elliot’s laughing
thrush (Garrulax elliotii) is endemic to the eastern Himalayan region [23-26], where it generally occupies shrubland habitats at altitudes from 2 000 to 4 000 m.a.s.l.
Since the montane habitat in this region is divided by
deep valleys into distinct eco-subregions or clusters of
mountains [19,20], it is plausible that these geographic
barriers restrict gene flow between G. elliotii populations
thus contributing to genetic diversity in this bird.
High altitude parts of the eastern Himalayas were subject to repeated glaciations during the Pleistocene [27].
These glacial cycles and accompanying climate changes

probably had a large influence on species’ distribution
and demography [28,29]. The range of G. elliotii is predicted to have expanded and contracted along an altitudinal gradient resulting in historic periods of
connectivity and isolation. Given the potential for
repeated contacts between populations on different
mountains, it is possible that populations merged into a
single gene pool during historic periods of connectivity
[1,2,6]. However, many studies in other montane regions
suggest that gene flow among populations remained
restricted during the Pleistocene, leading to each population remaining a distinct evolutionary lineage [8-14].
We used mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites to
address the effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on
genetic diversification in the eastern Himalayas. We first
evaluate whether Elliot’s laughing thrush from each ecosubregion or cluster of mountains comprises a distinct
evolutionary lineage. Second, we investigate the contribution of geographic and environmental barriers to G.
elliotii’s distribution. Third, we test whether the timing
of diversification within G. elliotii is consistent with climatic shifts induced by Pleistocene glacial cycles.
Fourth, we use coalescent simulations to test whether
populations from different mountains have descended
from a single ancestor (single refugium), or, alternatively, remained isolated on individual mountains during
down-slope expansions (multiple refugia). Finally, given
that the range of G. elliotii is predicted to have
expanded and contracted in response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, we also examine historical demography of this species.

Materials and methods
Study area and sampling sites

The eastern Himalayan mountain region occupies western and north-western Yunnan, western Sichuan,
south-eastern Tibet, southern Qinghai and south-western Gansu. Steep mountain ranges and major rivers in
deep valleys divide this region into several distinct ecosubregions [19,20] (see Figure 1). Tang [24] and Zhang
[30] described diverse floristic constitution of these subregions. The northern subregion, which is comprised a
part of the Tibetan plateau, is dominated by a plateau
cold and dry climatic condition [24-27,30]. The vegetation type is characterized by alpine meadows and grasslands. This northern subregion is considered as ‘Plateau
avifauna’ with the endemic avian species as Pseudopodoces humilis, Montifringilla adamsi, Pyrgilauda ruficollis, Urocynchramus pylzowi and Kozlowia roborowskii
[24,31,32]. The southern subregion, on the other hand,
is influenced by much warmer and wetter climatic condition, and the vegetation is characterized by tropical, or
subtropical, broadleaved forests with a mixture of evergreen and deciduous species. This subregion is

represented by Himalaya-Hengduanshan Mountain avifauna with many endemics babbles (Timallinae) and
pheasants [24-26]. The eastern subregion consists of a
cluster of mountains including of Qinling, Min, Mang
and Daba mountains. The vegetation is dominated by
temperate evergreen coniferous and broadleaved mixed
forests. Endemic avian species include Chrysolophus pictus, Spizixos semitorques, Garrulax sukatschewi, G.
davidi, Yuhina diademata, Paradoxornis przewalskii, P.
paradoxus and Parus davidi [24-26,31-33]. Subregionspecific species have also been observed for other taxa,
such as plants [34], ants [35], fishes [36], reptiles [37]
and mammals [38].
These three subregions are further divided into thirteen biogeographic sectors corresponding to clusters of
mountains [20]. The sites from which samples of G.
elliotii were obtained are shown in Figure 1 and Table
1. These sample sites were distributed across the range
of the species, and grouped into ten populations

according to the biogeographic sectors described in Li
[20].
Mitochondrial DNA amplification and sequencing

DNA was extracted from tissue samples using the
DNeasy Tissue kit (QIAGEN). The cytochrome b (cytb), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and II (COI and
COII), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and 6 (ND2 and
ND 6 ), ATP synthetase subunit 8 (ATP 8 ) and control
region (CR) genes were amplified via the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) [39-44]. The same primers were
used for amplification and sequencing reactions. Methods of purification and sequencing were as described in
Qu et al. [45]. All sequences are accessible at GenBank
(Accession nos: HM601543-602022).
Microsatellite genotyping

PCR amplifications were achieved in a 10 ul reaction
volume containing 10-30 ng DNA, 0.5 U Taq DNA

polymerase, 0.2 nmol dNTPs, 1-3 nmol MgCl 2 and 5
pmol primers. These loci were originally developed for
the following passerine species: Hirundo rustica (HrU5A) [46], Loxia scotica (LOX1) [47], Catharus ustulatus
(Cum02, Cum10, Cum28 and Cum32) [48], Poecile atricapillus (Pat43) [49], Phylloscopus occipitalis (Pocc6 and
Pocc8) [50] and Dendroica petechia (Dpu16) [51]. Original PCR conditions were optimized with variable MgCl2,
template DNA concentrations and annealing temperatures. Microsatellites were amplified with fluorescently
labelled forward primers (FAM and HEX dyes). Fragment lengths were analyzed with the internal size marker GENESCAN-500 ROX (Applied Biosystems), and
scored with GENEMARKER 3.7 (SoftGenetics).
Genetic polymorphism

For mitochondrial data, we calculated the number of
segregating sites, haplotype diversity and nucleotide
diversity for each population and all populations combined using DnaSP 4.0 [52]. McDonald & Kreitman’s
[53] test was used to examine the selective neutrality of
the mitochondrial DNA protein-coding fragments. Two
additional neutrality tests, Fu’s F S [54] and Fu & Li’s
[55]D were used to detect departures from the mutation-drift equilibrium that would be indicative of
changes in historical demography and natural selection.
All three tests were implemented in DnaSP.
For microsatellite data, parameters such as the number of alleles per locus (N A ), average allelic richness
(A R ), observed heterozygosity (H O ), heterozygosity
expected from the Hardy-Weinberg assumption (H E )
and exact tests of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between
pairs of loci for each population were calculated with
ARLEQUIN 3.5 [56] and FSTAT 2.9.4 [57].
Phylogeography and population structure

The maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in
PHYML 2.4.4 [58] was used to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships among mitochondrial haplotypes. Based on

the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [59], we used
the model GTR+I+G as suggested by Modeltest 3.7 [60].
We set the proportion of invariant sites and the shape
of Gamma distribution as 0.43 and 1.048, respectively
(estimated by Modeltest). The base frequency and ratio
of transition/transversion were optimized by the maximum-likelihood criterion in PHYML. Outgroups were
the black-faced laughing thrush (G. affinis), exquisite
laughing thrush (G. formosus) and streaked laughing
thrush (G. lineatus), which are considered closely related
to G. elliotii [61].
We used two methods to identify genetically distinct
groups among microsatellite genotypes. First, genetic
relationships between individual samples were quantified
using Nei’s standard genetic distance in GENETIX 4.05
[62]. The resultant matrix was then converted into a
dendrogram using the Neighbour-Joining algorithm [63]
provided with PHYLIP 3.5 [64] and graphically displayed
with TREEVIEW 1.6 [65]. Second, we used STRUCTURE 2.3.2 [66] with a burn-in of 5 × 107 and 5 × 108
iterations without prior population information and following the admixture model. We conducted ten replicate runs for each value of K (most likely number of
populations) from 1 to 10. The most likely K was identified using the maximal values of Pr(X/K), typically used
for STRUCTURE analysis [66] and ΔK based on the
rate of change in the posterior probability of data
between successive K-values [67].
Landscape genetics and environmental variables
correlation analyses

Suitable habitats for G. elliotii were identified in order
to investigate whether intraspecific lineages were separated by areas of unsuitable environmental conditions.
The habitat-mapping model was developed in ARCGIS
9.0 (Environmental Systems Research Institute) using
vegetation, topographic layers and the known distribution range of G. elliotii. Shrublands were identified as
suitable vegetation types [24-26]. We consider an area

Qu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/174

suitable if these vegetation types are intersected by suitable altitude distribution (2 000 to 4 000 m.a.s.l.).
These constructed areas were then projected onto the
current distribution of G. elliotii to generate a map of
suitable habitats. Gaps between patches of suitable habitat were considered habitat gaps. GENELAND 1.0.5
[68], a computer program in the R-PACKAGE [69], was
implemented to verify our definition of G. elliotii populations and locate areas of genetic discontinuity. GENELAND used microsatellite genotype data together with
geographic information (the locations from which individuals were sampled) to estimate population structure.
Areas of genetic discontinuity were detected as geographic areas with low posterior probability of membership. Following the approach of Coulon et al. [70], we
allowed K to vary (from 1 to 10) and inferred the most
probable K using five replicate runs with 5 × 105 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. For these
analyses the maximum rate of the Poisson process was
fixed at 100 with no uncertainty in the spatial coordinates, and the maximum number of nuclei in the Poisson-Voronoi tessellation was fixed at 300. The Dirichlet
model was used to estimate allele frequencies.
Additionally, a distance-based redundancy analysis
[71,72] was used to examine whether environmental factors might explain genetic diversification among populations. In the case of mitochondrial data, we used ten
locations as spatial units and the uncorrected p distance
and pairwise FST as the measures of genetic differentiation. In the case of microsatellite data, genetic distance
was measured as the FST and Nei’s Ds. An array of predictor variables was grouped into six sets: (i) coordinate
(latitude and longitude); (ii) vegetation (alpine steppe;
Tibet alpine meadow & shrublands; subalpine grassland
& shrublands; temperate grasslands & shrublands and
subtropical shrublands); (iii) subregion (southern; northern and eastern); (iv) elevation; (v) temperature (mean
annual temperature; mean January temperature and
mean July temperature); (vi) mean annual rainfall. All
predictor variables except vegetation and subregion were
continuous, therefore these were treated as categorical
variables with two states; 1 if a sample was located in a
given vegetation type or subregion, and 0 if it was
located in another vegetation type or subregion. Thus,
each vegetation type or subregion was regarded as a vector corresponding to five vegetation types and three
subregions, respectively. Vegetation or subregion was
analyzed as a set, i.e. these variables were combined in a
single test.
Environmental variables were taken from the WWF
Terrestrial Ecoregion and WorldClimate (http://www.
worldclimate.com) databases. Subregions were defined
according to Li [20]. In order to identify variables correlated with genetic distance, individual sets of predictor

Page 5 of 17

variables were analyzed with the marginal test in
DISTLM 5.0 [73]. The P values in these analyses were
obtained using 9 999 simultaneous permutations of the
rows and columns of the distance matrix. To examine
which subset of predictor variables provided the best
model explaining genetic differentiations among G. elliotii populations, the forward selection procedure in the
program DISTLM forward [74] was performed on all
sets of variables. The forward selection procedure consists of sequential tests, fitting each set of variables one
at a time, conditional on the variables already included
in the model. To examine whether the tested variables
were correlated, output files also included information
on the correlations among all pairs of explanatory variables. This provided a further check on potential multicollinearity issue. As in the previous analysis, P values
were obtained using 9 999 permutations of the rows
and columns of the multivariate residual matrix under
the reduced model.
Divergence time estimate

In order to overcome the limitations of conventional
estimates of divergence time based on FST values (e.g.
estimation of divergence time assuming isolation without gene flow) [75-77], we employed a coalescent-based
MCMC simulation to estimate the divergence times for
the main mitochondrial lineages in the program IM
[78,79]. As recommended by Hey & Nielsen [78] we
first performed multiple runs, with an increasing number of steps and using wide priors and heating schemes
to ensure that the complete posterior distribution could
be obtained. We finally performed four independent
runs of 5 × 10 8 steps with a burn-in of 5 × 107 steps
and a linear heating scheme (g1 = 0.05). IM was run
under the HKY substitution model (estimated by Modeltest 3.7). Convergence on stationary distributions was
assessed by monitoring the similarity of posterior distributions from independent runs and by assessing the
autocorrelation parameter values over these runs [80].
The peaks of the resulting posterior distributions were
taken as estimates of parameters [81]. Credibility intervals were recorded as the 90% highest posterior density
(HPD). Because no fossil data were available to calibrate
the mutation rate, we assumed a conventional molecular
clock for the avian mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b
gene (1 × 10-8 per site per year) [82,83]. The mutation
rate was modulated by multiplying the ratio of the average distance for the combined sequences versus that for
cyt b alone to deduce the mutation rate for all fragments combined. We used this modified mutation rate
to convert the divergence time estimate into calendar
years.
For microsatellite data, timing of population splits was
estimated using the IMa2 [81] with burn-ins of 5 × 107

Qu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/174

and 5 × 108 iterations under the SSM model with initial
short runs to provide prior estimates. A geometric heating scheme was employed and the program run four
times with different random seed numbers to ensure
convergence of parameter estimates. The IMa2 output
included mean values of the parameters for two sets
after the burn-in period, representing the first and second half of the total generations of the post burn-in
run. We ran our analyses until the peak location set
values were equal for both sets. This, along with the
high effective sample size and low autocorrelation estimate, suggested the Markov chains reached convergence
after a sufficiently long burn-in period and were
sampled from the appropriate likelihood space. A generation time of 1 year [26] and a mutation rate of 10-5
to 10-4 per generation for birds [84-89] were used to
convert divergence time into calendar years. Given the
uncertainty in mutation rates, the resultant estimates
should be interpreted with caution.
Historical biogeography

To determine whether populations remained isolated in
individual habitats (multiple refugia), or merged into a
single gene pool (single refugium) during down-slope
dispersal, we used coalescent simulations in MESQUITE
2.5 [90] to test three phylogeographic models of diversification. The first hypothesis posited that all populations
derive from a single source population (single-refugium
hypothesis). The second hypothesis postulated that
populations were isolated into southern and north-eastern refugia (two-refugia hypothesis). The geographic
structure was inferred from mitochondrial data. A third,
three-refugia hypothesis, which was consistent with
three-subregion division and inferred from microsatellite
data (see RESULTS), predicted that populations derive
from three independent refugia.
For coalescent simulations, we first estimated Ne for
individual populations of G. elliotii using values for θ
calculated in MIGRATE 2.3.2 [91] under the following
parameters: 10 short chains (500 trees used out of 10
000 sampled) and three long chains (5 000 trees used
out of 100 000 sampled) with four adaptive heating
chains (1, 3, 5 and 7). Maximum-likelihood estimates
(MLE) were calculated under a stepping-stone model
four times to ensure convergence upon similar values
for θ. We converted θ to N e using the equation for
maternally inherited mitochondrial data θ = 2 N e μ,
using same mutation rate in divergence time estimate.
The estimates of Ne for all populations were summed to
calculate Total Ne and scaled the branch widths of our
hypothesized population trees using the proportion of
Total Ne that each population comprised. The Ne of the
refugial population was constrained to a size proportional to the relative Ne of the population sampled from

Page 6 of 17

the sites of the putative refugia. Thus, if samples from
the site of the putative refugium had an effective population size of one-third that of the Total Ne, we would
constrain the population size in the simulation prior to
population expansion to one-third the total Ne. During
coalescent simulations, both Total N e and lower and
upper bounds of the 95% CI for Ne were used as model
parameters in order to encompass a wide range of
potential Ne values The divergence time specified for
each model corresponded to the approximate age estimated using IM and IMa2 as follows: 0.1 mya for the
southern and north-eastern populations (two-refugia
model), 0.015 mya for northern and eastern populations
(three-refugia model). In the single refugium model, we
specified divergence time as 0, which assumed a panmixia population derived from a single refugium. For
converting coalescent time (in generations) to absolute
time, we assumed a generation length of 1 year [26].
The amount of discordance between a gene tree and
population model was measured by S, the minimum
number of sorting events required to produce the genealogy within a given model of divergence [92]. The S
value is a measure of the number of parsimony steps in
characters for a reconstructed gene tree, such that more
discordance between the population model and gene
tree leads to a higher S value. To obtain a distribution
of S values, 10 000 gene trees were simulated, constrained within each model of population divergence
under a neutral coalescent process, and the amount of
discordance between the simulated genealogy and population model was determined. Overall, this produced a
null distribution of 10 000 S values based on reconstructed genealogy for each model of population divergence. The S value for observed genealogy was
calculated and compared to the distributions of S values
from coalescent simulations to determine whether the
observed genealogy could have been generated under a
given model.
We also examined the ancestral area distributions for
deeper nodes of the mitochondrial haplotype phylogeny
with an event-based method in DIVA 1.1 [93]. Each
individual in the phylogeographic analysis was coded to
one of the ten biogeographic sectors. We used an equal
likelihood for the rate of change among sectors for estimating ancestral areas because we had no information
on the dispersal rate among sectors.
Historical demography

The past population dynamics of mitochondrial lineages
of G. elliotii were estimated using the Bayesian skyline
plot method implemented in BEAST 1.4.6 [94]. This
approach incorporates uncertainty in the genealogy
using MCMC integration under a coalescent model, in
which the timing of dates provides information about

Qu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/174

effective population sizes through time. Chains were run
for 100 million generations, and the first 10% of which
were discarded as ‘burn-in’. The substitution model was
selected according the result of Modeltest 3.7. We
applied 10 grouped coalescent intervals and constant
growth rate for the skyline model. The same mutation
rate in divergence time estimate was used. Pilot analyses
showed that the ucld.stdev parameters were close to
zero, thus a strict clock model was employed. Demographic history through time was reconstructed using
Tracer 1.4 [95].
The exponential growth rate (g) was also estimated for
each mitochondrial lineage by FLUCTUATE 1.4 [96].
FLUCTUATE was initiated with a Watterson [97] estimate of theta (θ) and a random topology, performing 10
short chains, sampled every 20 genealogies for 200
steps, and two long chains, sampled every 20 genealogies for 20 000 steps. FLUCTUATE analyses were
repeated five times and the mean and standard deviation
of g calculated from the results of these separate runs.
Because this genealogical method yields estimates of g
with an upward bias [96], we corrected g values following the conservative approach of Lessa et al. [98] and
only considered the g value indicative of population
growth when g > 3 SD (g).

Results
Genetic polymorphism

A total of 4 029 bp of mitochondrial DNA was obtained,
which contained 170 polymorphic sites, 125 of which
were parsimony informative. These polymorphic sites
defined 67 unique haplotypes, 58 of which occurred
only once. Seven haplotypes were shared among individuals within the same population and two were shared
between neighbouring populations. Within sampling
locations, haplotype diversity values were nearly maximal, from 0.905 to 1, and nucleotide diversity ranged
from 0.0028 to 0.005 (Table 1). None of the coding
regions sequenced deviated significantly from neutrality
(McDonald & Kreitman’s test, P > 0.05, Table 2). The

results of Fu’s FS test and Fu & Li’s D test indicated an
over-abundance of singleton mutations and rare alleles
for most fragments (negative D or FS values with P <
0.02, Table 2). Contradictory results between two neutrality tests and the McDonald & Kreitman’s test suggest
that intraspecific polymorphism of these sequences may
have been mainly influenced by historical demography
rather than selection.
For microsatellite data, there were 1 to 9 alleles per
locus across all populations, and observed (H O ) and
expected heterozygosity (HE) ranged from 0.01 to 0.909
and 0.091 to 0.905, respectively. There was no evidence
of linkage disequilibrium after adjusting the significance
level for multiple comparisons (P < 0.001). Five locuspopulation combinations showed significant deviation
from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation after Bonferroni
correction, which involved four populations and all due
to heterozygosity deficiency (Table 3).
Phylogeography and population structure

A reconstructed maximum-likelihood tree of mitochondrial haplotypes suggested that G. elliotii was composed
of two major clades with support rates of 82% and 71%,
respectively (1000 replicates). The geographic distributions of the two clades appeared uneven, with the
majority of first clade’s haplotypes found mainly in
populations in the northern and eastern subregions
(north-eastern clade), whereas haplotypes of second
clade were most common in southern subregion (southern clade) (Figure 2). Time to most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA) for both clades fell within the late
Pleistocene glacial period (Marine Isotope Stage, MIS6):
0.139 (95% HPD, 0.093-0.194) and 0.149 (95% HPD,
0.097-0.205) mya for north-eastern and southern clades,
respectively.
Both Neighbour-Joining and STRUCTURE analyses
detected similar population structures in the microsatellite data. Samples from the southern, northern and eastern subregions separated into three distinct clusters.
The first cluster (southern lineage) was comprised of

two populations from the southern subregion (DL and
ZD), the second cluster (eastern lineage) consisted of
the five eastern populations (WX, QL, HB, BC and YA),
and the third cluster (northern lineage) included the
three northern populations (CD, MK and RT) (Figure 3
and 4). Yet, STRUCTURE indicated that populations
from the eastern subregion showed minor admixture
with samples from the northern subregion (Figure 4).
To assess the genetic admixture, we carried out an
exclusion method implemented in the program GENECLASS 2.0 to identify potential admixture individuals.
Using the previously determined three genetic clusters
and geographic sampling locations as prior population
information, GENECLASS identified a considerable proportion of admixture individuals (25%), most of which
were assigned to the geographically intermediate populations MK, YA and BC (method and result see Additional file 1, Table S1).
Landscape genetics and environmental variables
correlation analyses

When geo-referenced microsatellite genotypes were analysed using GENELAND, we found that three Bayesian
population clusters received the highest probable

support (55% of estimated K-values from GENELAND)
(Figure 5). Additionally, GENELAND revealed that a
three-subregion structure was the most probable subdivision of G. elliotii, which verified the population structure inferred by STRUCTURE and the NJ tree. Each
identified cluster was spatially contiguous and areas of
steep turnover in posterior probability of population
membership were presumed to reflect barriers to gene
flow. Geographic information system (GIS) revealed that
the three clusters are separated from adjacent clusters
by areas where environmental conditions are unsuitable
for G. elliotii. Comparing genetic divergence with spatial
landscape pattern shows that gene flow barriers coincide
with the spatial distribution of habitat gaps (Figure 5a).
The marginal tests revealed that three sets of environmental variables, subregion, vegetation and coordinate,
were significantly correlated with genetic distance of
both mitochondrial and microsatellite data. The forward
selection procedure that classified variables according to
the proportion of explained variation also recognized
these variables sets as important variables in the multiple regression models. A combination of the three sets
explained 77 to 97% of the genetic variation between
locations (Table 4).

migration parameters estimated by IM (m1 and m2),
which represented the number of migrants per mutation
(m = m/μ), were converted to population migration
rates (M = 2 Nm = θm/2). The migration rate per generation was estimated to be 0.43 (0.09-0.65) from the
southern to north-eastern lineage, and 0.37 (0.07-0.63)
from the north-eastern to southern lineage.
For microsatellite data, the posterior probability of

southern and north-eastern lineages, and at 0.15
(0.045-0.315) for the northern and eastern lineages.
When converted to a scale of years, the divergence
time between the southern and north-eastern lineages
was estimated from 0.097 (0.018-0.232) to 0.01 (0.0020.023) mya. For the northern and eastern lineages,
divergence time was estimated between 0.015 (0.0040.032) and 0.0015 (0.0005-0.003 2) mya. The migration
rate per generation (2 Nm) was estimated at 0.83 (90%
HPD, 0.48-1.8) from the north-eastern to southern
lineage, and 1.01 (0.38-2.2) from the southern to
north-eastern lineage. From the eastern to northern
lineage, the migration value was estimated to be 1.34
(0.56-1.8), and 0.33 (0.02-1.14) from the northern to
eastern lineage.

Divergence time estimate

As the four runs of IM and IMa2 gave similar results,
we report below the estimates from the run with the

(the parameter with the lowest ESS value in every run).
For mitochondrial data, posterior probability for divergence time peaked at time t = 3.415 (90% HPD, 2.7654.3345). When converted to a scale of years, the divergence time between north-eastern and southern lineages

40, SD = 4.5, P = 0.3) in three Ne values.
Reconstruction of ancestral areas indicates that the
north-eastern clade might have originated from YA and
MK, while the southern clade probably derived from ZD
and BC (Figure 6). Relatively high probabilities for multiple areas being the ancestral areas at the deeper nodes in
the tree supported results from the coalescent simulation
that suggest diversification occurred via multiple refugia.

trend since the late Pleistocene glaciations (Figure 7).
Past population dynamics of two mitochondrial lineages
coherently indicate continuous population growth over
the last 0.125 mya. Log transformed theta values were
around 0.02 near the end of the MIS6, after which
populations began to increase rapidly until they reached
their current sizes (theta around 3.5). Recent population
growth is also supported by maximum-likelihood estimates of positive growth rates (corrected g: southern
clade: 1604; north-eastern clade: 3226).

Discussion
Pattern of distribution and biogeography

Geographic complexity and environmental heterogeneity
are likely to have shaped the genetic structure among G.
elliotii populations. Such a landscape effect is evident in
the eastern Himalayan region. Although G. elliotii has a
rather restricted geographic distribution, mitochondrial
data support the separation of a southern and a northeastern lineage with incomplete gene sorting, while
microsatellites indicate a clear subdivision into three

Page 12 of 17

lineages, a southern, a northern and an eastern. Despite
intermixing of mitochondrial haplotypes, none of the
haplotypes are geographically widespread. All shared
haplotypes occur within the same subregional population. In this case, the steep mountains and deep valleys
of the Kangding-Muli-Baoxin Divide, recognized as a
geographic barrier by Zhang et al. [19] and Li [20],
appear to effectively have prevented gene flow among
subregional populations. Across the entire sampling
area, the correlation between phylogeographic pattern
and subregion division is strong. Furthermore, our
regression model reveals that the general pattern of subdivision could be attributed to geographic and environmental differentiations, e.g. subregion and vegetation.
Mountains, like sky islands, and are separated by areas
of unsuitable habitats that act as barriers to gene flow
[14,15]. Species restricted to sky islands commonly have
high levels of interpopulation genetic divergence [8-15].
In the eastern Himalayas, G. elliotii is restricted to
shrublands in the three subregions separated by deep
valleys. The habitat-mapping model shows that these
subregions or lineages are separated by areas where the
environmental conditions are unsuitable for G. elliotii.
Consistent with the expectation that these valleys prevent or restrict gene flow, each subregional population
represents an evolutionary lineage. Thus, the contrast in
environmental conditions at high and low elevations in
the eastern Himalayas may have created a “sky island
situation” for G. elliotii.
Although many sky island species in other regions
show high levels of isolation in clusters of mountains
[7-14], our data indicate that diversification of G. elliotii
has occurred on a broader geographic scale, eco-subregions. G. elliotii is an alpine bird found between 2 000
and 4 000 m.a.s.l. [24-26]. This broad altitudinal range
implies large ecological plasticity. Considering that most
previously studied sky island species belong to less
mobile groups such as beetles and plants, this difference
in scale probably reflects the fact that historical processes of isolation are more easily reconstructed in species with less dispersal capability than in highly mobile
species [1-4].
While our study may demonstrate newly discovered
sky island diversification in a previously unstudied
region, sky islands also have the extra connotation that
mountain ranges are equivalent ecologically and they
share the same biogeographic history. Since three ecosubregions in the eastern Himalayas present different
ecological systems, our result should be considered cautiously. Whether the eastern Himalayan region is a sky
island situation ultimately depends on the ecology of the
organisms under study. Further research on more
organisms inhabiting this region, especial the same ecoclimatic subregions is required to clarify this.

while the dashed lines delineate the 95% HPD limits. Blue represents the north-eastern lineage and green the southern lineage. The abbreviation
MIS refers to marine isotope stage.

Effects of Pleistocene glaciations on population
divergence

The Pleistocene glacial cycles have been considered to
induce environmental shifts in the eastern Himalayas
resulting in the isolation of G. elliotii populations on different subregions. Congruent with this, our divergence
time estimates indicate that lineage diversification
occurred during the late Pleistocene interglacial period
(MIS5). Climatic fluctuations during the late Pleistocene
resulted in several glacial-interglacial cycles in the eastern Himalayas [27,28,99-101]. Glaciations were
restricted to relatively high altitudes and did not affect
the lower slopes or valleys [27]. Palaeoclimatic and palynological studies from this region reveal a vegetational
shift over the Pleistocene glacial cycles [102,103]; during
the glacial periods, cool-temperate vegetations, such as
shrublands, expanded to lower elevations, and contracted to high elevations during warmer and wetter
interglacial periods [104,105]. Because alpine birds are
often strongly associated with their preferred habitat,
range expansion and contraction of shrublands probably
mirrored that of G. elliotii. It is plausible therefore that
the glacial and interglacial cycles would allow G. elliotii
to disperse among subregions during glacial periods, but
isolate population in different subregions during the
interglacial periods.
Given the potential for repeated contacts of populations from subregions during glacial expansions, it is

possible that subregional populations merged into a
common gene pool. However, our analyses of diversification pattern in G. elliotii appear to reflect historical
differentiation in multiple refugia. Coalescent simulations and reconstruction ancestral areas of the mtDNA
phylogeny suggested a divergence model involving the
multiple refugia, while microsatellite data identify a distinct genetic structure concordant with the geographically separated southern, northern and eastern
subregions. These results suggested that subregional
populations of G. elliotii were isolated into separated
refugia during down-slope expansions, although we
could not distinguish between the two-refugia and
three-refugia model. Furthermore, while coalescent
simulation assumes that the discordance between the
reconstructed gene tree and multi-refugia population
trees reflects the retention of ancestral variation, the discordance could also result from migration among subregional populations (see below).
Genetic admixture among intraspecific lineages

In contrast to the deep phylogeographic partitions found
in other sky island species [8-14], we only found a shallow phylogeographic division in G. elliotii. This is consistent with genetic admixture among lineages occurring
during glacial periods. The two partially sympatric mitochondrial lineages show shared ancestry, and microsatellite data indicate gene flow among the three subregional

Qu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:174
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/174

populations. Furthermore, GENECLASS identified a
considerable proportion of admixed individuals, most of
which were assigned to the geographically intermediate
populations MK, YA and BC. Interestingly, despite the
relatively high degree of genetic admixture, these locations were also identified as the potential refugia that
most likely defined the boundary of each genetic lineage.
Based on these observations, it is probable that isolated populations of G. elliotii periodically expanded to
lower elevation where they mixed. Thus, the three
intraspecific lineages likely established a contact zone
along their boundaries. Because these lineages are geographically relatively close and are likely to have experienced repeated glacial cycles, this has resulted in
multiple episodes of genetic admixture. Over time, this
could have defined a centre of gene flow, such as populations YA, MK and BC. This process might cause the
mixing of genetic lineages thereby obscuring the pattern
of genetic variation [42].
Nevertheless, the rather large degree of genetic separation among lineages indicates that these have been isolated from each other for a relatively long period.
Although the southern and north-eastern mitochondrial
lineages are intermixed, no haplotypes are shared
between them. This lack of sharing suggests that the two
lineages are at an intermediate stage of divergence along
the continuum from complete panmixia to paraphyly and
ultimately to reciprocal monophyly [106,107]. In contrast,
differences in microsatellite allele frequencies among the
three lineages are more distinct. The discrepancy
between these two markers may indicate that admixture
among these lineages is relatively ancient, and hence, that
the mixing signature is relatively weak.
Historical demography

Climatic changes that resulted in population expansion
and contraction are also expected to lead to demographic changes over time between lineages confined to
different subregions. Congruent with this, the Bayesian
skyline plot revealed an increasing population size in
each genealogical lineage since 0.125 mya, i.e. during
the warmer interglacial MIS5 period. During the Quaternary, the eastern Himalayas were uplifted to 4 000 4 500 m.a.s.l. Climatic conditions responsible for high
rainfall moved away from the centre of mountains and
mountain glaciers shrank [27,99]. The maximum extent
of glacial development in this region occurred during
MIS6 and MIS4, with ice being restricted during the
global Late Glacial Maximum, LGM (MIS2) [27-29].
Palynological research has indicated that a series of prolonged, mild interglacials supported vegetation similar
to the present-day flora of East Asia during MIS5 (0.11
to 0.071 mya) [42,108,109]. It is likely that Pleistocene
climatic stability might have allowed the persistence of

Page 14 of 17

vegetation similar to that observed today in the eastern
Himalayas, especially at moderate or low altitudes [109].
Therefore, our results, combined with the palaeoclimatic
and palynological data, suggest that G. elliotii experienced population growth during the warmer MIS5
period.
Contrary to the expectation that profound ecological
upheavals during cooler periods would have reduced the
population size of G. elliotii, the Bayesian skyline plot
revealed a stable population during the cooler MIS4 and
MIS2 periods. Maintenance of a rather stable population
size can probably be attributed to the frequency and
location of glaciations in this region. Unlike high latitude regions of Europe and North America that were
covered by heavy ice during much of Pleistocene, glaciations in the eastern Himalayas were restricted to relatively high altitudes and did not affect the lower slopes
or valleys [26]. It is likely that this relatively milder climate was less stressful for cold-tolerant alpine birds
than the extremes experienced by both European and
North American birds. Although temperatures might
have been lower elsewhere during the MIS4 and MIS2,
it has been inferred that the climate of the eastern
Himalayas, particularly at low altitudes, was warmer
[42,107-109]. Therefore, the resultant stable niches
might have provided suitable habitats for G. elliotii even
during periods of climatic change, making it possible for
this species to maintain a stable population size during
the cooler MIS4 and MIS2.

Conclusion
The genetic structure observed in G. elliotii indicates
that lineages have been isolated on individual subregions
since the late Pleistocene interglacial period (MIS 5).
Despite being isolated in multiple refugia during glacial
advance, gene flow periodically occurred when populations expanded their ranges to lower altitudes. The
resultant genetic admixture might have caused the mixing of genetic lineages thereby obscuring the pattern of
genetic variation. The Bayesian skyline plot shows a gradual increase in population size in each mitochondrial
lineage since the late Pleistocene interglacial period
(MIS 5). Our results provide new evidence that climatic
changes during the Pleistocene glaciations had profound
effects on lineage diversification and demography in a
bird species in a previously unstudied montane region the eastern Himalayas.
