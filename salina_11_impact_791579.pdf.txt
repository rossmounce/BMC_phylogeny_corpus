Abstract
Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are a rapidly evolving fraction of the eukaryotic genomes and the main
contributors to genome plasticity and divergence. Recently, occupation of the A- and D-genomes of allopolyploid
wheat by specific TE families was demonstrated. Here, we investigated the impact of the well-represented family of
gypsy LTR-retrotransposons, Fatima, on B-genome divergence of allopolyploid wheat using the fluorescent in situ
hybridisation (FISH) method and phylogenetic analysis.
Results: FISH analysis of a BAC clone (BAC_2383A24) initially screened with Spelt1 repeats demonstrated its
predominant localisation to chromosomes of the B-genome and its putative diploid progenitor Aegilops speltoides
in hexaploid (genomic formula, BBAADD) and tetraploid (genomic formula, BBAA) wheats as well as their diploid
progenitors. Analysis of the complete BAC_2383A24 nucleotide sequence (113 605 bp) demonstrated that it
contains 55.6% TEs, 0.9% subtelomeric tandem repeats (Spelt1), and five genes. LTR retrotransposons are
predominant, representing 50.7% of the total nucleotide sequence. Three elements of the gypsy LTR
retrotransposon family Fatima make up 47.2% of all the LTR retrotransposons in this BAC. In situ hybridisation of
the Fatima_2383A24-3 subclone suggests that individual representatives of the Fatima family contribute to the
majority of the B-genome specific FISH pattern for BAC_2383A24. Phylogenetic analysis of various Fatima elements
available from databases in combination with the data on their insertion dates demonstrated that the Fatima
elements fall into several groups. One of these groups, containing Fatima_2383A24-3, is more specific to the Bgenome and proliferated around 0.5-2.5 MYA, prior to allopolyploid wheat formation.
Conclusion: The B-genome specificity of the gypsy-like Fatima, as determined by FISH, is explained to a great
degree by the appearance of a genome-specific element within this family for Ae. speltoides. Moreover, its
proliferation mainly occurred in this diploid species before it entered into allopolyploidy.
Most likely, this scenario of emergence and proliferation of the genome-specific variants of retroelements, mainly in
the diploid species, is characteristic of the evolution of all three genomes of hexaploid wheat.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) of various degrees of
reiteration and conservation constitute a considerable
part of wheat genomes (80%). TEs are a rapidly evolving
fraction of eukaryotic genomes and the main contributors to genome plasticity and divergence [1,2]. Class I
TEs (retrotransposons) are the most abundant among

the plant mobile elements, constituting 19% of the rice
genome and at least 60% of the genome in plants with a
larger genome size, such as wheat and maize [3-6]. In
wheat, the majority of class I TEs are LTR (long terminal direct repeats) retrotransposons [7,8]. The internal
region of LTR retrotransposons contains gag gene,
encoding a structural protein, and polyprotein (pol)
gene, encoding aspartic proteinase (AP), reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H (RH), and integrase (INT),
which are essential to the retrotransposon life cycle
[9,10]. Because of their copy-and-paste transposition

mechanism, retrotransposons can significantly contribute to an increase in genome size and, along with polyploidy, are considered major players in genome size
variation observed in flowering plants [11-13].
Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) provides evidence for TEs involvement in the divergence between
genomes. GISH, a method utilising the entire genomic
DNA as a probe, makes it possible to distinguish an
individual chromosome from a whole constituent subgenome in a hybrid or an allopolyploid genome. Numerous examples of successful GISH applications in the
analysis of hybrid genomes have been published, including in allopolyploids, lines with foreign substituted chromosomes, and translocation lines [14-17]. It is evident
that the TEs distinctively proliferating in the genomes of
closely related species are the main contributors to the
observed differences detectable by GISH.
GISH identification of chromosomes in an allopolyploid genome depends on the features specific during
the evolution of diploid progenitor genomes to the formation of allopolyploid genomes and further within the
allopolyploid genomes. Three events can be considered
in the evolutionary history of hexaploid wheats. The
first event led to the divergence of the diploid progenitors of the A, B and D genomes from their common
ancestors more than 2.5 million years ago (MYA). The
next event was the formation of the allotetraploid wheat
(2n = 4x = 28, BBAA) less than 0.5-0.6 MYA. Hexaploid
wheat (2n = 6x = 42, BBAADD) formed 7,000 to 12,000
years ago [18-21]. It is considered that Triticum urartu
was the donor of the A genome; Aegilops tauschii was
donor of the D genome; and the closest known relative
to the donor of the B genome is Aegilops speltoides.
GISH using total Ae. tauschii DNA as a probe has
demonstrated that the chromosomes of the D genome,
which was the last one to join the allopolyploid genome,
are easily identifiable, and the hybridisation signal uniformly covers the entire set of D-genome chromosomes
[22]. Hybridisation of total T. urartu DNA to Triticum
dicoccoides (genomic formula, BBAA) metaphase chromosomes distinctly identifies all A-genome chromosomes [23]. All these facts suggest the presence of Aand D-genome specific retroelements. Construction of
BAC libraries for the diploid species with AA (Triticum
monococcum) and DD (Ae. tauschii) genomes allowed
these elements to be identified. Fluorescent in situ
hybridisation (FISH) of BAC clones made it possible to
select the clones giving the strongest hybridisation signal
that was uniformly distributed over all chromosomes of
the A or D genomes of hexaploid wheat [24]. Subcloning and hybridisation have demonstrated that the TEs
present in these BAC clones may determine the
observed specific patterns. It has been also shown that
A-genome-specific sequences have high homology to

Page 2 of 14

the LTRs of the gypsy-like retrotransposons Sukkula and
Erika from T. monococcum. The D-genome-specific
sequence displays a high homology to the LTR of the
gypsy-like retrotransposon Romani [24].
The GISH pattern of the B-genome chromosomes is
considerably more intricate. The total Ae. speltoides
DNA used as a probe allowed the B-genome chromosomes to be identified in the tetraploid wheat T. dicoccoides; however, the observed hybridisation signal was
discrete, i.e., it did not uniformly cover all of the chromosomes but rather was concentrated in individual
regions [22,23]. Such a discrete hybridisation signal
suggests the presence of genome-specific tandem
repeated DNA sequences. It has been shown that a
characteristic of the B genome is the presence of GAA
satellites [25] and several other tandem repeats [26],
which are either absent or present in a considerably
smaller amount in the A- and D-genomes. A more
intensive hybridisation to individual regions of B-genome chromosomes as compared with the A genome
was also demonstrated for the probe for Ty1-copia retroelements [27]. The existence of B-genome specific
retrotransposons analogous in their chromosomal localisation to those detected for the A and D genomes
can be only hypothesised.
Another intriguing issue is the time period when TEs
most actively proliferated in the wheat genomes. An
increase in the number of determined DNA sequences
from the wheat A and B genomes gave the possibility to
date the insertion of TEs in these two genomes. The
majority of TEs differential proliferation in the wheat A
and B genomes (83 and 87%, respectively) took place
before the allopolyploidisation event that brought them
together in T. turgidum and T. aestivum. Allopolyploidisation is likely to have neither positive nor negative
effects on the proliferation of retrotransposons [6].
The data on TEs insertions in orthologous genomic
regions are not contradictory to the above results on
TEs proliferation in diploid progenitors that occurred
before allopolyploidisation. A comparison of orthologous
genomic regions demonstrates the absence of conserved
TEs insertions in T. urartu, Ae. speltoides, and Ae.
tauschii, which are putative diploid donors to hexaploid
wheat [21,28-31]. On the contrary, a comparison of
orthologous regions in the diploid genomes and the corresponding subgenomes of polyploid wheat species suggests the presence of conserved TEs insertions
[29,30,32]. However, note that the intergenic space,
composed mainly of TEs, may be subject to an extremely high rate of TEs turnover [33]. In particular, analysis of the intergenic space in the orthologous VRN2 loci
of T. monococcum and the A genome of tetraploid
wheat has demonstrated that 69% of this space has been
replaced over the last 1.1 million years [34]. All this

Salina et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/99

suggests intensive processes of TEs proliferation and
turnover in the diploid progenitors of allopolyploid
wheat.
Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the B genome
contains specified retrotransposons dispersed over all
constituent chromosomes that proliferated as early as in
the diploid progenitor of this genome.
We have previously analysed nine BAC clones of T.
aestivum (genomic formula, BBAADD) cv. Renan and
identified BAC clone 2383A24 as hybridising to a number of chromosomes [35] in a dispersed manner. In this
work, we have shown a predominant localisation of
BAC_2383A24 to the B-genome chromosomes of common wheat and comprehensively analysed its sequence,
which gives the background for clarifying the reasons
underlying its B-genome specificity. The contribution of
the LTR retrotransposon Fatima, the most abundant
element in this clone, to the B-genome specificity of
polyploid wheat and the divergence of common wheat
diploid progenitors were studied.

Results
BAC-FISH with the chromosomes of Triticum
allopolyploids and their diploid relatives

BAC-FISH was performed with the allopolyploid
wheats T. durum (genomic formula, BBAA) and T.
aestivum (genomic formula, BBAADD) as well as their
diploid progenitors, including the donor of the A-genome, T. urartu, donor of the D-genome, Ae. tauschii,
and the putative donor of the B-genome, Ae. speltoides.
The chromosomal localisation of BAC_2383A24 in the
allopolyploid species was determined by simultaneous
in situ hybridisation using the probe combinations
pSc119.2 + BAC and pAs1 + BAC. The pSc119.2 and
pAs1 are tandem repeats that are used as probes for
wheat chromosome identification [36]. Figure 1A
shows the hybridisation pattern for T. aestivum (cv.
Chinese Spring) with the probes pSc119.2 and
BAC_2383A24. The strongest hybridisation signals for
BAC_2383A24 were on the 14 chromosomes of the T.
aestivum B-genome. Analogous results were obtained
for the remaining two analysed common wheat cultivars, Renan and Saratovskaya 29 (data not shown). In
addition, using BAC_2383A24 as a probe, we succeeded in visualising the translocation of the 7B shortarm to the long-arm of the 4A chromosome (Figure
1A), which took place during the evolution of Emmer
allopolyploid wheat [37,38]. The BAC-FISH experiments showed preferential BAC_2383A24 hybridisation
to the B-genome chromosomes in the tetraploid species T. durum (genomic formula, BBAA, data not
shown). Thus, the BAC_2383A24 probe can efficiently
identify chromosomes from the B-genome of tetraploid
and hexaploid wheat.

We also showed that the three genomes of common
wheat (T. aestivum) can be identified using simultaneous in situ hybridisation with BAC_2383A24 and
labelled genomic DNA of Ae. tauschii. In these experiments, the B-genome intensively hybridised with
BAC_2383A24 (green color), the D-genome intensively
hybridised with Ae. tauschii DNA (red color), and the
A-genome displayed weak or no hybridisation with
both probes (Figure 1C). The genome of Ae. speltoides
is easily distinguishable by in situ hybridisation with
BAC_2383A24 in the slide containing the metaphase
chromosomes of both Ae. speltoides and T. urartu
(Figure 1D). More contrasting distinctions are
observed when BAC_2383A24 and Ae. tauschii DNA
are simultaneously hybridised to the slides containing
mixtures of the genomes of Ae. speltoides and Ae.
tauschii (Figure 1E).
Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the B-genomespecific BAC clone 2383A24

To precisely determine the range of sequences that
could possibly contribute to the B-genome specificity of
the BAC_2383A24 FISH pattern, this BAC clone was
sequenced and annotated (the corresponding data were
deposited in GenBank under the accession number
[GenBank: GU817319]).
Transposable elements constitute 55.6% of
BAC_2383A24 (Table 1), and retrotransposons (class I)
are the most abundant, constituting 51.6% of
BAC_2383A24. LTR retrotransposons were also nestinserted in each other (Figure 2). The most abundant
family in the LTR retrotransposons for this BAC clone
contains the gypsy-like Fatima elements (Table 1).
BAC_2383A24 contains three copies, namely, Fatima_2383A24-1p (p indicates the elements with truncated ends), Fatima_2383A24-2, and Fatima_2383A243, which account for 47.2% of all LTR retrotransposons
in this clone.
The class II DNA transposons are represented by a
single copy of the Caspar_2383A24-1p element, constituting only 3.3% of BAC-2383A24. Note that Caspar_2383A24-1p has a 95% identity over the entire
sequence length to the Caspar_2050O8-1 element,
which, according to our data, is characteristic of wheat
subtelomeric regions [35,39]. Caspar_2383A24-1p is
truncated at the 3â-end and contains the sequence that
codes for transposase. The five hypothetical genes
identified in BAC_2383A24 account for 4.3% of the
entire BAC sequence (Table 2, Figure 2). Two
hypothetical genes (2383A24.1 and 2383A24.3) contain
transferase domains (Pfam PF02458), and their
hypothetical protein products display an 88% identity
to each other. Gene 2383A24.2 is located between the
two transferase-coding genes and is very similar (80%

the remaining two hypothetical genes, 2383A24.4 and
2383A24.5, have not yet been identified. However, they
display significant similarity (>57% identity over >83%
of their lengths) to hypothetical rice protein and display high similarity to one another (over 80% identity)
in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences (Table
2). Thus, the five genes form a gene island of 23,670
bp located 9,737 bp from the 5â- end (Figure 2). The

intergenic regions contain four MITE insertions and a
3 kb region similar to T. aestivum chloroplast DNA.
Note that the 5â-end of this gene island contains a
direct duplication of genes 2383A24.1 and 2383A24.3,
which are similar to gene Os04g0194400, located on
rice chromosome 4. However, the 3â-end carries an
inverted duplication of genes 2383A24.4 and
2383A24.5, which are similar to gene Os01g0121600,
localised to a distal region (1.22 Mb from the end) on
the short arm of rice chromosome 1.

BLAST alignments of the BAC_2383A24 sequence
and the contigs containing mapped wheat ESTs
(expressed sequence tags) from GrainGenes database
[http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/blast.shtml] none identified any homology to BAC_2383A24 sequence.
BAC_2383A24 contains an array of six tandem subtelomeric Spelt1 repeats (five copies are each 177 bp long,
and one copy is truncated to 125 bp). They constitute
0.9% of the clone length (Table 1, Figure 2). The presence of the Spelt1 tandem repeat and a Caspar element
homologous to Caspar_2050O8-1 suggests the

genomic region marked by Spelt1 subtelomeric repeats. The
genomic region contains B-genome specific Fatima sequences (p at
the ends of the names of transposable elements indicates that the
corresponding elements are truncated).

BAC_2383A24 clone likely originated from a subtelomeric chromosomal region [35].
We used Insertion Site-Based Polymorphism (ISBP)
for developing a BAC_2383A24 specific TE-based molecular marker [40]. ISBP exploits knowledge of the
sequence flanking a TE to PCR amplify a fragment
spanning the junction between the TE and the flanking
sequence. We selected one primer pair for the junction
between the elements Barbara_2383A24-1p and Fatima_2383A24-2 (BarbL and BarbR). The primers BarbL/
BarbR were used for localising BAC_2383A24 to the
chromosomes of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. PCR
analysis using nullitetrasomic lines has demonstrated
that the BarbL/BarbR fragment with a length of 1008 bp
corresponding to BAC_2383A24 is characteristic of the
3B chromosome (see Additional File 1). The data on the
homology between the DNA and amino acid sequences
of 2383A24.4 and 2383A24.5 to the distal region of the
rice 1S chromosome, which is syntenic to the short arm
of wheat homoeologous group 3 chromosomes [41], also
confirm this localisation (Table 2).
Note that characteristic of BAC_2383A24 is a higher
gene density (one gene per 23 kb) relative to an average
level of one gene per 100 kb, typical of wheat genome,
and a lower TE content (55.6%) as compared with the
mean TE level (about 80%) [6-8]. Analysis of the contigs
along the 3B chromosome has demonstrated an increase

in the gene density towards the distal chromosomal
regions as well as a decrease in the TE content in these
regions [8]. The contig ctg0011 on the distal region of
the 3B short arm [8], whereto according to our data
BAC_2383A24 is localized, displayed the most pronounced contrast with the average gene density values
and TE contents of the wheat genome.
The gypsy-like Fatima retrotransposon sequences are
responsible for specific hybridisation to the B-genome

To detect the specific sequences that account for the
major contribution to B-genome specific hybridisation,
we subcloned BAC_2383A24. We subsequently screened
subclones that gave a strong hybridisation signal with
Ae. speltoides genomic DNA and selected several for
further characterisation. Using the 435-bp subclone
(referred to as 2383A24/15) as a probe for in situ hybridisation (Figure 3), we obtained B-genome specific signal distributions on the T. aestivum chromosomes
similar to the initial BAC_2383A24 clone (Figure 1B).
Sequence analysis of subclone 2383A24/15 shows that it
corresponds to a region of the Fatima_2383A24-3 coding sequence and displays 85% sequence identity to the
Fatima_2383A24-2 element; it has no matches with the
Fatima_2383A24-1p element.
We failed to obtain B-genome specific hybridisation
with different subclones corresponding to either other
TEs or sequences in BAC_2383A24. Overall, our analysis suggests that the gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon
Fatima_2383A24-3 is responsible for the B-genome specificity of BAC_2383A24 FISH.
Phylogenetic analysis of the gypsy-like LTR
retrotransposon Fatima

We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the gypsy LTR
retrotransposons Fatima present in BAC_2383A24 and
available in the public databases. All of the Fatima

elements contained in the TREP database [42] fall into
two groups, autonomous and nonautonomous. The
âautonomousâ variant presented TREP3189 by consensus nucleotide sequence and had two open reading
frames corresponding to hypothetical proteins
PTREP233 (polyprotein) and PTREP234. The ânonautonomousâ variant presented TREP3198 by consensus
nucleotide sequence and had open reading frames corresponding to hypothetical proteins PTREP231 (polyprotein) and PTREP232 (Figure 3). Using a BLASTP search
[43] against the Pfam database [44], we demonstrated
that PTREP231 contains gag and AP domains, while

light grey shading and the percent of homology is defined.
Likewise the relative position of probe BAC2383A24/15 in reference
to âautonomousâ Fatima variant is marked with light grey; in
ânonautonomousâ variant, the sequence corresponding to
BAC2383A24/15 is absent.

PTREP233 consists of RT, RH, INT, and AP domains
and displays weak similarity to the gag domain.
BLASTN alignments demonstrate that autonomous and
nonautonomous elements have high similarity in the
LTR region (91% identity over the entire length) and
moderate similarity (65% over a 356-bp region) in the
region corresponding to the aspartic proteinase domain.
Sequence similarity between the remaining regions of
autonomous and nonautonomous elements was undetectable. BAC_2383A24 contains representatives of both
subfamilies; Fatima_2383A24- 2 and Fatima_2383A24-3
belong to the autonomous elements, and Fatima_2383A24-1p belongs to the nonautonomous elements. In the phylogenetic study, we analysed the
autonomous and nonautonomous subfamilies separately
because the internal regions of these elements are rather
dissimilar in their sequences.
Using the consensus sequences TREP3189 (autonomous) and TREP3198 (nonautonomous) as reference
sequences, we screened the NCBI nucleotide sequence
database [45], including the high throughput genomic
sequences division (HTGS) (for which sequencing is in
progress) in the case of TREP3189. The genomic
sequences belonging to T. aestivum, T. durum, T.
urartu, T. monococcum, and Ae. tauschii showed significant BLAST hits (>75% identity over a region of >500
bp) to the reference sequences. The data on the analysed Fatima elements are consolidated in Additional
File 2. From the HTG Sequences, we took only those
ascribed to one of the common wheat genomes or genomes of its diploid relatives.
The regions homologous to the coding reference
sequences were used in ClustalW multiple alignments
[46] (see Methods). Multiple alignments were constructed individually for each conserved coding domain
(AP, RT, RH, and INT for autonomous elements and
GAG for nonautonomous elements). In total, we
extracted 116 autonomous and 165 nonautonomous
Fatima sequences from the public databases. We attributed Fatima sequences to particular genomes of allopolyploid wheat (where such data were available), as
shown in Additional File 2 and Figure 4 (for autonomous elements). The insertion timing was estimated for
each Fatima copy containing both LTR sequences (see
Methods and Additional File 2).
For autonomous Fatima elements, we constructed the
phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences
coding for the conserved AP, RT, RH, or INT domains.
All of the constructed phylogenetic trees for the autonomous elements had very similar topologies. The phylogenetic tree for the RH sequences (Figure 4) is shown as
an example. In general, three main groups form the distinct branches on the trees. We designated the most
abundant group as B-genome specific (or B-group)

Page 7 of 14

because it contains practically all of the Fatima elements
from the B-genome chromosomes, except a subgroup of
5 elements from the A-genome. The element Fatima_2383A24-3, containing B-genome specific clone
2383A24/15, also falls into B-group. The insertion timing range for the elements of this branch is 0.5-2.5
MYA. The members of this group cluster separately
from the elements originating from the elements of Ae.
tauschii (D-genome specific group). The insertion timing for the elements of the D-genome specific group
was determined for annotated sequences (1.2-2.2 MYA),
as this group almost exclusively contains the elements
found in unannotated HTG sequences. The group,
referred to as a mixed group, forms a distinct cluster of
the A-, B-, and D-genome specific subgroups (0.5-3.2
MYA). Fatima_2383A24-2 is a member of the B-genome specific subgroup.
Phylogenetic analysis of the nonautonomous group did
not show any genome-specific clustering (data not
shown). The insertion timing for the nonautonomous
elements varies from 0.5 to 2.9 MYA; thus, the nonautonomous elements amplified approximately at the same
time as the autonomous elements (see Additional File 2).

Discussion
BAC_2383A24 probes provide a means of identifying the
chromosomes of the allopolyploid wheat B-genome and
Ae. speltoides with various backgrounds

The genus Triticum comprises diploid, tetraploid, and
hexaploid species with a basic chromosome number
multiple of seven (x = 7). One of the approaches to
studying plant genomes with a common origin is in situ
hybridisation using total genomic DNA as a probe, or
GISH [47-49]. This method makes it possible to concurrently estimate the similarity of repeated sequences and
chromosomal rearrangement (translocations) during
evolution, detect interspecific and even intraspecific
(interpopulation) polymorphisms, and identify foreign
chromosomes and their segments in a particular genetic
background. The difficulties encountered in discriminating between the genomes of allopolyploid species using
GISH result from the following two issues:
(1) âfittingâ of the genomes that composed the allopolyploid nucleus during the evolution of the allopolyploid species, which involved homogenization of
repeated sequences and redistribution of mobile elements, and
(2) the genomes of diploid progenitors for an allopolyploid species are rather close to one another, with
few divergent representations of repeated sequences.
GISH analysis of Nicotiana allopolyploids provided
direct evidence for a decrease in the divergence between

Figure 4 The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of autonomous Fatima elements originating from different Triticeae genomes. The
phylogenetic tree was constructed using a CLUSTALW multiple alignment for the Fatima nucleotide sequences coding for RNase H. Bootstrap
support over 50% is shown for the corresponding branches. Designations in sequence names: Ta, T. aestivum; Td, T. durum; Tt, T. turgidum; Tu, T.

predominantly contains the elements belonging to the B genome; and D, the elements belonging to the D genome. The âmixedâ group
contains the Fatima elements from different Triticeae genomes.

Salina et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/99

the parental genomes during the evolution via exchange
and homogenisation of repeats [49]. It has been demonstrated that GISH is able to distinguish between the
constituent genomes in the first generation of synthetic
Nicotiana allopolyploids. The parental genomes of an
allopolyploid formed as long ago as 0.2 MYA are similarly easy to distinguish; however, the parental genomes
in this case display numerous translocations. The efficiency of GISH considerably decreases when analysing
the Nicotiana allopolyploids formed about 1 MYA,
thereby suggesting a considerable exchange of repeats
between parental chromosome sets [49].
It has been suggested that close affinities among the
diploid donor species T. urartu, Ae. speltoides, and Ae.
tauschii interfere with a GISH-based discrimination
between different genomes in hexaploid wheat [16]. Our
results from simultaneous in situ hybridisation of
BAC_2383A24 and Ae. tauschii genomic DNA to the
slide containing both Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii cells
demonstrate a clear discrimination between the chromosomes of these diploid species (Figure 1E). The differences between the genomes are also detectable when
hybridising BAC_2383A24 with the metaphase chromosomes of Ae. speltoides and T. urartu (Figure 1D). Similar
to Nicotiana allopolyploids, the efficiency of genome discrimination decreases in the cases of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, likely due to increased cross-hybridisation of
the BAC_2383A24 (B-genome) repeats and Ae. tauschii
genomic DNA with chromosomes from homoeologous
genomes. The formation of Emmer wheat dates back to
0.5 MYA; judging from the dating for rearrangements in
Nicotiana allopolyploids, this is a sufficient time period
for considerable rearrangements in the TE fraction
between the parental chromosome sets.
Simultaneous hybridisation using BAC_2383A24 (Bgenome) and the probes that provide for identification
of common wheat chromosomes demonstrated that
BAC_2383A24 is able to detect translocations involving
the B-genome that occurred during the evolution of the
allopolyploid emmer wheat (Figure 1A).
In situ hybridisation demonstrated a dispersed localisation for the majority of BAC clones on wheat chromosomes (as in the case of BAC_2383A24), which can be
explained by the fact that BAC clones contain various
TEs with disperse genomic localisations [50]. Analysis of
the complete BAC_2383A24 nucleotide sequence (totaling 113 605 bp) demonstrated that mobile elements
constitute 55.6% of the sequence, the most abundant
being LTR retrotransposons (51.6% of the clone). Most
predominant among the retrotransposons is the gypsy
LTR retrotransposon family Fatima, constituting up to
47.2% of all LTR retrotransposons. The results of BAC
subcloning and subsequent in situ hybridisation of subclone 2383A24/15 (Figure 1B) suggest that the Fatima

Page 9 of 14

family elements significantly contribute to the
BAC_2383A24 B-genome specific FISH pattern.
Several reasons can explain a genome-specific BACFISH pattern, namely, (1) the presence of specific TE
families and (2) differences in proliferation of the same
TEs in different genomes.
Estimating the contribution of Fatima to the divergence
and differentiation of the B-genome

In assessing TE contribution to the differentiation of the
genomes in hexaploid wheat, it is reasonable to turn to
earlier works estimating the content of repeated DNA
sequences and heterochromatin in wheat and their progenitors. In particular, all three genomes that form hexaploid wheat considerably differ in the content of their
repeated DNA fraction involved in formation of the heterochromatic chromosomal regions. C-banding demonstrates that the B-genome is the richest in
heterochromatin, the A-genome is the poorest, and the
D-genome occupies the intermediate position [51]. A
high heterochromatin content in the B-genome correlates with the size of this genome, which amounts to 7
pg and exceeds the sizes of the diploid wheat species
[11]. It was later demonstrated that the satellite GAA
was one of the main components of the B-genome heterochromatin, and the families of tandem repeats
pSc119.2 and pAs1 were detected. Notably, their localisation partially coincides with the localisation of heterochromatic blocks in common wheat [36]. The 120-bp
tandem repeat pSc119.2 predominantly clusters on the
B-genome chromosomes and individual D-genome chromosomes, whereas the pAs1 (or Afa family) clusters on
the D-genome chromosomes and individual A- and Bgenome chromosomes. The distinct localisation of these
repeats in certain chromosomal regions allows their use
as probes for chromosome identification [36]. As has
been demonstrated, the diploid progenitors of the corresponding polyploid wheat genomes also differ in the
content of these repeats.
In 1980, Flavell studied the repeated sequences of T.
monococcum, Ae. speltoides, and Ae. tauschii and
demonstrated that each species contains a certain fraction of species-specific repeats. This fraction is the largest in Ae. speltoides, constituting 2% of the total
genomic DNA. As for the diploid with the A-genome,
the content of species-specific repeats is lower than in
the species that donated the B- and D-genomes. Part of
the Ae. speltoides species-specific repeats can be
explained by the presence of the high copy number subtelomeric tandem repeat family Spelt1 [26]. Evidently,
the genome-specific variants of the pSc119.2 family can
contribute to this fraction.
Thus, previous results suggest that the B-genome differs from the other genomes of hexaploid wheat with a

Salina et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/99

higher content of distinct tandem repeat families, some
of which are B-genome specific.
TEs also impact B-genome specificity. The advent of
wheat BAC clones and their sequencing makes it possible to consider in more detail the differentiation of the
parental genomes in hexaploid wheat and the involvement of repeated DNA sequences in this process,
namely TEs, as their most represented portion. In a
recent study analysing TE representation in 1.98 Mb of
B genomic sequences and 3.63 Mb of A genomic
sequences, we showed that TEs of the Gypsy superfamily
have proliferated more in the B-genome, whereas those
of the Copia superfamily have proliferated more in the
A-genome [6]. In addition, this comparison demonstrated that the Fatima family is more abundant in the
B-genome among the gypsy-like elements and that the
Angela family is more abundant in the A-genome
among the copia-like elements [6]. When analysing
BAC_2383A24, which we localised to the 3B chromosome, we also demonstrated that gypsy elements are
more abundant than copia elements and that Fatima
constitutes 85.8% of all gypsy elements annotated in this
clone (Table 1, Figure 2). A comparison of 11 Mb of
random BAC end sequences from the B-genome with
2.9 Mb of random sequences from the D-genome of Ae.
tauschii demonstrated that the athila-like Sabrina
together with Fatima elements, are the most abundant
TE families in the D-genome [7].
A study of the distribution of gypsy-like Fatima elements in the common wheat genome by in situ hybridisation with the probes 2383A24/15 (a Fatima element)
and BAC_2383A24 (where Fatima elements constitute
23.9% of its length) has revealed a B-genome specific
FISH pattern (Figure 1). Most likely, the observed hybridisation patterns of Fatima elements with the common
wheat chromosomes is determined by higher proliferation of Fatima sequences in the B-genome and/or the
presence of the B-genome specific variants of Fatima
sequences.
Analysis of the wheat DNA sequences available in
databases demonstrated that Fatima elements are present in all the three genomes (A, B, and D) of common
wheat. Phylogenetic analysis confirms that the autonomous Fatima elements fall into B-genome-, D-genomeand A-genome-specific groups and subgroups (Figure
4). The Fatima_2383A24-3 element (2383A24/15)
belongs to the B-genome-specific group. Fatima
2383A24-2 belongs to the B-genome subgroup, which
together with A-genome and D-genome subgroups form
a mixed group. Insertion of the Fatima elements that
form the B-genome-, A-genome- and D-genome-specific
groups and subgroups took place in the time interval
0.5-3.2 MYA (Figure 4). This time corresponds to the
period between formation of the diploid species and

Page 10 of 14

their hybridisation, which led to the wild Emmer tetraploid wheat T. dicoccoides [20,21,30]. The insertion time
of Fatima_2383A24-3, predominantly localised to the Bgenome (Figure 1), is 1.6 MYA, which matches the proliferation of the B-genome-specific groups in the diploid
progenitor.
Therefore, B-genome specificity of the gypsy-like
Fatima as determined by FISH is, to a great degree,
explained by the appearance of a genome-specific element within this family from Ae. speltoides, the diploid
progenitor of the B-genome. Likely, its proliferation
mainly occurred in this diploid species before it entered
into allopolyploidy, as suggested by both the BAC FISH
data (Figure 1) and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 4).
Most likely, this scenario of emergence and proliferation
of the genome-specific variants of retroelements in the
diploid species is characteristic of the evolution of all
three genomes in hexaploid wheat. The fact that over
80% of the TEs in the A- and B-genomes proliferated
before the formation of allopolyploid wheat also confirms this hypothesis [6]. Note that the B-genome-specific elements are not only present in the Ty3-gypsy
Fatima family. In particular, in situ hybridisation of the
RT fragment from Ae. speltoides Ty1-copia retroelements (RT probe) to the T. diccocoides chromosomes
distinguished between the A- and B-genome chromosomes. The RT probe displayed the most intensive
hybridisation to B-genome chromosomes [27].
Note also the observed decrease in the efficiency of
BAC FISH identification of the B-genome in allopolyploid wheat (Figure 1) compared with the diploid progenitors. This suggests that the transpositions of the
gypsy LTR retrotransposon family Fatima and possibly
other genome-specific TEs occurred after the formation
of allopolyploids.

Conclusions
In this work, we performed a detailed analysis of the T.
aestivum clone BAC-2383A24 and the Ty3-gypsy group
LTR retrotransposons Fatima. BAC_2383A24, marked
by a subtelomeric Spelt1 repeat, was localized in a distal
region on the short arm of 3B chromosome using ISBP
marker and the data on a synteny of wheat and rice
chromosomes. Interestingly, characteristic of
BAC_2383A24 is a higher gene density (one gene per 23
kb) and a lower TE content (55.6%) relative to the mean
values currently determined for the wheat genome,
which is in general characteristic of the distal region of
the short arm of 3B chromosome [8]. Further physical
mapping and sequencing of individual wheat chromosomes will clarify whether a high gene density and a
lower TE content are specific features of this chromosome region only or this is also characteristic of other
distal chromosome regions.

The gypsy LTR retrotransposon Fatima is the most
abundant in BAC_2383A24 and, similar to the overall
clone, is predominantly localized to the B-genome chromosomes of polyploid and diploid wheat species. Given
the data from FISH and the phylogenetic analysis of the
Fatima elements taken from public databases, we concluded that the observed hybridisation pattern of Fatima
elements to the common wheat chromosomes was due
to higher proliferation of Fatima sequences in the Bgenome and the presence of B-genome specific variants
of Fatima sequences. According to our estimates, proliferation of B-genome specific variants of elements took
place in the time interval 0.5-2.5 MYA, which corresponds to the time period between when the diploid Bgenome progenitor species Ae. speltoides formed and
before the hybridisation event that led to formation of
the wild Emmer tetraploid wheat T. dicoccoides. Most
likely, this scenario of emergence and proliferation of
genome-specific variants of retroelements, mainly in the
diploid species, is characteristic of the evolution of all
three genomes in hexaploid wheat.

PCR analysis

The following specific primer pairs designed for the
junctions of LTR retroelements were used: Barbara_2383A24-1p/Fatima_2383A24-2 (BarbL, 5â-ccagataccc-attca-ccaac-3â and BarbR, 5â-ccgag-gagca-caaccttac-3â). The PCR mixture contained 100 ng of Triticum

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)

Fluorescent in situ hybridisation experiments were done
as described in detail by [26]. Probes were labeled with
biotin and digoxigenin and then detected with avidinFITC (green) and an anti-digoxigenin-rhodamine Fab
fragment (red). BAC_2383A24 was hybridized to a set of
slides containing the metaphase chromosomes for the
polyploid species (1) T. aestivum and (2) T. durum as
well as two diploid species simultaneously, namely, (3)
T. urartu and Ae. speltoides, (4) Ae. tauschii and Ae.
speltoides. Subclone 2383A24/15 was hybridized to T.
aestivum. To distinguish between the B- and D-genome
chromosomes, we co-hybridized the probes under study
with clones pSc119.2 and pAs1, respectively [52]. Total
Ae. tauschii DNA was used as a probe for the D-genome chromosomes.
BAC subcloning and colony hybridisation

To extract DNA fragments from BAC_2383A24 that
hybridize specifically to the B-genome, we performed
BAC subcloning and subsequent hybridisation with a32
P-labeled Ae. speltoides genomic DNA. Initially, we
obtained a set of 250 Sau3AI fragments ranging in size
from 100 to 1000 bp cloned in the BamHI-digested
pUC18 (Promega, USA). The colonies were then transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane [53] and hybridized
with the probe labeled by the random hexamer method
using a-32P-dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK)
and a Klenow fragment [54]. The hybridisation mixture
also contained competitive T. urartu and Ae. tauschii
genomic DNA in the same quantities as the Ae. speltoides genomic probe (100 ng each per 20 ml of hybridisation mixture). Filters were first moistened by floating
on 2 Ã SSC. Prehybridisation was performed at 65Â°C for
4 h in 6 Ã SSC, 5 Ã Denhardtâs solution, 0.5% SDS, and
denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 Î¼g/ml). Hybridisation was performed in the same solution with denatured, labeled probe and competitive DNA for 16 h.
After hybridisation, filters were washed at room temperature for 15 min in each of the following solutions: 2
Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS; 0.5 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS; and 0.1 Ã SSC,
0.1% SDS. The membranes were exposed with Kodak Xray film for 3 days at -70Â°C.
Analysis of the BAC_2383A24 nucleotide sequence

The sequences were determined using the random shotgun method at the National Center of Sequencing (Evry,
France) as described by Chantret et al. [28]. Briefly, the
BAC clone was sequenced using Sanger technology at
20 X final coverage. After sequence assembly, finishing
of gaps were performed by sequencing of PCR products
with primers designed on sequencing flanking the gaps,
until one single contig was built. Lastly sequence assembly was verified by long-range (10 kb) PCR covering the

Salina et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/99

BAC clone. The resulting sequence of 113 605 bp was
annotated according to Charles et al. [6] and the Guidelines for Annotating Wheat Genomic Sequences from
International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium
[http://www.wheatgenome.org/Tools-and-Resources/
Bioinformatics-Board/Annotation-Guidelines]. The DNA
sequences that were not assigned to transposable elements or genes were regarded as unassigned DNA. The
BAC_2383A24 nucleotide sequence determined in this
work was deposited in GenBank under the accession
number [GenBank: GU817319].
Database screening for Fatima elements

For phylogenetic analysis of the Fatima family elements,
we compiled a dataset containing the autonomous and
nonautonomous LTR retrotransposon Fatima sequences
currently available in the TREP [42] and NCBI Nucleotide Sequence Databases [45] (Additional File 2). The
Fatima elements were searched for using the BLASTn
algorithm [43] and the consensus sequences TREP3189
and TREP3198 as reference sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis of Fatima sequences coding for
conserved domains

Phylogenetic analysis was performed separately for
autonomous and nonautonomous elements. In the case
of autonomous elements, phylogenetic analysis was
based on the nucleotide sequences corresponding to
conserved functional domains AP, RT, RH, and INT.
The nucleotide sequences coding for individual
domains were determined using BLASTX-2. The consensus amino acid sequences of the functional domains
AP, RT, RH, and INT for autonomous Fatima elements were determined by a BLASTP comparison
hypothetical polyprotein PTREP233 consensus
sequence and the sequences of functional domains and
proteins in the Pfam and NCBI databases. In the case
of nonautonomous elements, phylogenetic analysis was
performed using the sequences corresponding to the
functional domains GAG and AP. The nucleotide
sequences encoding these functional domains were
determined similar to the domains for autonomous
elements; the consensus hypothetical protein
PTREP231 was used for obtaining the consensus
amino acid sequences for the GAG and AP domains.
The nucleotide sequences of analyzed elements corresponding to the same functional domains were multiply aligned using the ClustalW program with the
MEGA4 software package [46,55]. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed by the neighbor-joining method with
the help of MEGA4 software and a maximum likelihood model with 500 bootstrap replicates and pairwise
nucleotide deletion options.

Dating the LTR retrotransposon insertion

For dating the insertion events of the autonomous and
nonautonomous Fatima elements, we analyzed the
nucleotide divergence rate between two LTRs in the
case when both LTRs were present in the elementsâ
structure. To determine the LTR boundaries, each element was compared with itself using Blast2seq [http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi]. In addition, the presence of the characteristic motifs, 5â-TG-3â
and 5â-CA-3â, at the beginning and end of each LTR,
respectively, was taken into account. Each pair of LTRs
was aligned using the ClustalW algorithm with the
MEGA4 program. The degree of divergence (with standard error, SE) was calculated using the Kimura twoparameter method [56] and complete deletion option.
To convert this term into the insertion date, we used
the following equation: T = D/2r, where T is the time
elapsed since the insertion; D, the estimated LTR divergence; and r, the substitution rate per site per year [57].
We applied a substitution rate of 1.3 Ã 10-8 mutations
per site per year for the plant LTR retrotransposons
[58].
