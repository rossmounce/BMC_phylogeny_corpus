Abstract
Background: The main prediction of life-history theory is that optimal energy allocated among
the traits is related to the growth, maintenance and survival. It is hypothesized that the optimal
resource allocated to immune function, which generates resistance towards parasites and reduce
the fitness losses caused by parasitism, is depending on other requirements for energetic resource
and the benefits associated with them. The aims of this study are to investigate in a comparative
way (1) how parasitism is related to fish life history traits (fecundity, longevity, mortality), (2)
whether there is a trade-off between reproduction and immune investments in fish females (i.e.
energetic hypothesis) and in males (i.e. immunohandicap hypothesis), (3) whether parasitism
influences host immunity (spleen size) and reproduction (gonad size) in females and males.
Results: Data on metazoan parasites of 23 cyprinid fish species from Central Europe were used
for the analyses as well as new data collected from a field study. Ectoparasite species richness was
negatively correlated with the fish mortality estimated by the k-value and positively correlated with
fish body size, suggesting that parasite diversity increases with fish longevity. A negative relationship
between spleen size and gonad size, controlling for fish body size, was found in females but not in
males. Moreover, parasite abundance was positively correlated with fish spleen size and negatively
with fish gonad size in females.
Conclusion: The comparative analyses using cyprinid fish species demonstrated that natural
mortality could be considered as a factor contributing to the variability of parasite species richness
and moreover, parasite species benefit from long-lived fish. The results obtained from the analyses
investigating the potential trade-off between reproduction and immunity could be interpreted as
an energetic trade-off between female reproduction and immune function. The lack of negative
relationship between gonad size and spleen size in males did not support our prediction based on
the immunohandicap hypothesis.

Background
Parasites negatively influence host fitness, and subsequently hosts develop their anti-parasite defence, i.e. a
performing immune system, in order to reduce fitness cost
induced by parasitism [1]. However, an increased investment in immune defence should give rise to a trade-off
with life-history traits such as growth, survival and reproduction [2]. Several studies supporting this prediction
have been performed, predominantly in birds [3-5]. Fewer
studies have been conducted in fish [6,7], which differ
from birds and mammals in several aspects of their life
history traits [8,9].
Investment in immune defence is commonly measured by
spleen size, density of blood cells or as T-cell mediated
immune response [3,4,7,10-14]. Several comparative
studies use the relative spleen size as a potential measure
of immune investment in birds against parasites
[4,11,15,16], in which it was predicted that host species
encountering more parasites possess larger spleens
because they have more invested in immune defence [16].
Moreover, the use of spleen size is also recommended in
ecotoxicological studies as a standard measure of immunocompetence [17]. Spleen plays a highly important role
in hemopoiesis and immune reactivity of teleost fish producing antibodies and participating in clearance of pathogens and foreign particles from the blood stream [18].
Spleen size is widely applied as an estimator of immunocompetence in recent published studies on fish and used
as a measure of investment in immunity in intra-specific
analyses [7,19-22].
The impacts of parasites on host survival, reproduction
and mating success are well documented in fish [23-28].
Fish males and females invest differently in reproduction
with females investing more in gamete production, and
males investing more in mate attraction through the display of sexual ornamentation, which are exacerbated during the spawning period [6,7].
Two hypotheses were formulated for explaining the differential investment in reproduction and immune response
in link with parasite pressure. The first hypothesis postulates the existence of an energetic trade-off between the
investment in reproduction and the investment in
immune responses [1], with the assumption that immune
response is costly and reduces the energy for other tasks
such as reproduction. If this energetic hypothesis is correct, a trade-off between gonad development and spleen
size in females should be observed.
The second one, the immunohandicap hypothesis [6,2932] emphasizes the potential role of immunosuppression
induced by steroid sexual hormones (mainly testosterone). These hormones and some of their precursors

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/29

directly affect the production of immune cells in fish
[33,34]. The increasing level of steroid hormones at the
very beginning of reproduction stimulates the expression
of sexual ornamentation, but negatively influences the
immune function ability (i.e. immunosuppression). As a
consequence, a negative effect of testosterone on the relative spleen weight is observed in fish [14]. The immunosuppression by steroid hormones could result in higher
parasites intensities in breeding individuals or in individuals with high expression of sexual ornamentation
[20,29]. As a consequence, a trade-off between gonad
development and spleen size in males was predicted and
observed [4]. From this point of view, the immunohandicap hypothesis could be also seen as a part of larger concept of energetic trade-offs between investment in
reproduction and immune defence in males. In addition,
a relationship between parasites and well-developed
ornamentation was predicted [35,36]. This has been
observed or partially confirmed in fish males [6,32,37].
The aims of this study are to investigate in a comparative
way:
- how parasitism is related to fish life history traits,
- whether there is a trade-off between reproduction and
immune investments in fish females (i.e. energetic
hypothesis) and in males (i.e. immunohandicap hypothesis),
- whether parasitism influences host immunity (spleen
size) and reproduction (gonad size) in females and males.

Results
Fish life history traits: allometry and trade-off
K-value, a parameter of the von Bertalanffy growth function, considered as a good predictor of natural mortality
was not correlated with fish body size, whilst female
fecundity was positively correlated with maximal fish size
(N = 19, b = 2.41, R2 = 0.75, p < 0.0001). Maximal fish
longevity was also positively correlated with maximal fish
size (N = 19, b = 0.66, R2 = 0.65, p < 0.0001). A negative
relationship between female fecundity and maximal longevity was found after correcting both variables for maximal fish body size (N = 19, b = -0.25, R2 = 0.51, p =
0.0004). We used residuals of fecundity and longevity
obtained from these regressions for the next analyses.
Parasitism and fish life history traits
Data from the literature that were used are given in Table
1. Life history traits (k-value, female fecundity and maximal longevity) were tested as potential determinants of
parasite species richness.

First, we found that:

- Total parasite species richness was positively correlated
with host sample size (b = 0.54, p < 0.0001) and fish body
size (b = 0.46, p = 0.0185) using multiple regression (N =
19, R2 = 0.79, p = 0.0001).
- Ectoparasite species richness was positively correlated
with host sample size (b = 0.44, p < 0.0001) and fish body
size (b = 0.37, p = 0.0214) using multiple regression (N =
19, R2 = 0.78, p < 0.0001).
- Endoparasite species richness was positively correlated
with host sample size (b = 0.53, p < 0.0001) and fish body
size (b = 0.39, p = 0.0353) using multiple regression (N =
19; R2 = 0.78, p < 0.0001).
Total parasite species richness, ecto- and endoparasite species richness were corrected for both host sample size and
fish body size using residuals obtained from these multiple regression.
We used the residuals of parasite species richness (total,
ecto- and endoparasites) of these regressions for the next
analyses.
Second, we tested the existence of correlation between fish
life traits and parasitism. Multiple regression revealed a
negative relationship between mortality estimated by kvalue and residuals of ectoparasite species richness (p <

0.01, see Figure 1). This result is still significant using Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). A negative but not significant relationship was also found between mortality and
residuals of total parasite species richness (p = 0.073). No

2, p < 0.001) but not in males (p > 0.05).

Parasitism, immunity and reproduction: intra-specific
analysis
We performed a variance component analysis on the
spleen weight (in log) of males of 4 fish species (Barbus
barbus, Leuciscus cephalus, Pseudorasbora parva, Rutilus
rutilus) and found that 82% of the variance is due to fish
species. The variance component analysis of the gonad
weight (in log) on males of 4 fish species showed that
only 71% of the variance is due to fish species.

We found the same results when fish species with less
than 3 individuals were removed. Moreover, the results
using raw data were similar to those obtained using the
independent contrasts analyses, i.e. a negative relationship was found between spleen weight and gonad weight
(p < 0.05) in females but not in males (p > 0.05).

The ANOVA performed on males of 4 fish species (Barbus
barbus, Leuciscus cephalus, Pseudorasbora parva, Rutilus
rutilus) showed a significant effect of parasite abundance,
fish weight and fish species on the gonad weight (Table
2). A marginal effect of individual parasite species richness on the gonad weight was also observed (Table 3). No
effects of parasite abundance or parasite species richness
were detected on spleen weight in males (all p > 0.1).
Parasitism, reproduction and immunity: inter-specific
analyses
Data from the field study are shown in Table 4. KruskalWallis (KW) test revealed significant inter-specific differences for gonad weight, spleen weight, parasite abundance and parasite species richness for both males and
females using raw data (for all variables p < 0.01).

Using independent contrasts, we found;
- positive relationships between spleen weight and fish
body weight for both females (N = 15, b = 1.15, R2 = 0.76,
p < 0.0001) and males (N = 18, b = 1.00, R2 = 0.75, p <
0.0001);
- positive relationships between gonad weight and fish
body weight for both females (N = 15, b = 0.85, R2 = 0.50,
p = 0.0022) and males (N = 18, b = 0.50, R2 = 0.24, p =
0.034).
Residuals of spleen weight (corrected for fish body
weight) was negatively correlated with residuals of gonad

Fish males
Parasite abundance was positively correlated with fish
body weight (N = 18, b = 0.86, R2 = 0.30, p = 0.0147) in
males. However, no relationship was found between
residuals of parasite abundance and residuals of spleen
weight or residuals of gonad weight (all p > 0.05). The
same results were observed when excluding fish species
with less than 3 individuals. The same results were
obtained using raw data (p > 0.05) excluding or not fish
species with less than 3 individuals.
Fish females
Total parasite abundance was positively correlated with
fish body weight (Figure 3a, p < 0.01) in females. A positive relationship was observed between residuals of total
parasite abundance and residuals of spleen weight (Figure
3b, p < 0.05), whereas a negative relationship was found
between residuals of total parasite abundance and residuals of gonad weight (Figure 3c, p < 0.01).

A positive significant relationship was found between
residuals of ectoparasite abundance and residuals of
spleen weight (N = 15, b = 1.464, R2 = 0.34, p = 0.017),
whereas a negative relationship was found between residuals of ectoparasite abundance and residuals of gonad
weight (N = 15, b = -0.97, R2 = 0.25, p = 0.047).
No relationship was observed for endoparasites (all p >
0.05) and for average parasite species richness (p > 0.05).
The comparative analyses were also performed using only
fish species with at least 3 individuals, and revealed a positive trend although not significant between total parasite
abundance and spleen weight (p = 0.17) and a negative
trend between parasite abundance and gonad weight (p =

(p = 0.11) and a negative relationship between ectoparasite abundance and gonad weight corrected for fish body

Finally, the same results were obtained using raw data
without correcting for phylogeny, with positive relationships between residuals of spleen weight and residuals of
total parasite abundance (N = 17, b = 0.81, R2 = 0.29, p =
0.025) or residuals of ectoparasite abundance (N = 17, b

were observed, although not significant (0.1 < p < 0.5),
when excluding fish species with low sample size.

ment in reproductive cells, and it will be useful to obtain
the fecundity in relation to average egg size for future
comparative studies. K-value from the Von Bertalanffy
growth model is considered as a good predictor of mortality [38]. Following Reznick et al. [9] the extrinsic mortality
(i.e. mortality attributable to external features of the environment such as disease or predation) is generally considered to be the most important factor shaping the
evolution of senescence.

Discussion
Evolution of life-history traits is predicted to be a consequence of how resources are allocated to competing functions such as reproduction, growth and maintenance.
Therefore, the potential relationships between different
fish life traits investigated in the present study, taking into
account the potential influence of parasitism should be
discussed in terms of trade-off. For instance high investment in reproduction might decrease energy for investment in immune functions, facilitating parasite infection
[1].
Fish life traits
In the present study we have shown several relationships
among fish life-history traits previously predicted by
Reznick et al. [9]. Allometric relationships with fish body
size were found for maximal longevity and female fecundity. The negative relationship found between female
fecundity and longevity supports the hypothesis that
cyprinid fish pay for an increased investment in reproduction in term of adult survival [9]. This study represents the
first comparative analysis demonstrating this pattern in
cyprinid fish species.

Because of the lack of significant relationship between
fecundity and k-value, it seems that fish with high growth
rate do not invest in high output reproduction (i.e. high
fecundity). However, the fecundity used in our comparative study represents an average number of eggs per female
in one breeding season, and only such evaluation of
fecundity data are available for cyprinids. The measure of
fecundity is not an absolute measure of the fish invest-

Fish life traits and parasitism
The impact of parasitism is predicted to increase with the
diversity of parasites to which a given host must face, and
therefore parasite species richness may be considered as a
good predictor for evaluating how the evolution of host
life history traits is shaped by parasitism [39-41]. Host
natural mortality, estimated by k-value of the Von Bertalanffy growth model, was recognized as a factor contributing to the variability of parasite species richness.
Moreover, parasite species benefit from long-lived fish as
showed by previous studies (see [39,41] and references
therein).
Parasitism, immunity and reproduction: intra-specific
analyses
Trade-off between investment in immune function and
cost of parasites during fish spawning has been predominantly investigated following Hamilton and Zuk's [35]
hypothesis [6,36,42-44]. In the case of the Arctic charr,
Salvelinus alpinus (L.) [7], the cost due to parasitism was
predominantly confirmed in fish males. Spawning males
(i.e. reproductive) were more susceptible to parasite infection than resting males (i.e. non-reproductive) [7]. This
finding is in accordance with the immunohandicap
hypothesis [29].

In the present study, the relative investment between
immune function and reproduction has been investigated
mainly on fish males at intra-specific level. Here, we
found a significant effect of parasitism on gonad weight in
the males of four fish species, but no effect on spleen
weight. At the intra-specific level Taskinen and Kortet [44]
did not find any relationship between immunocompetence (measured by spleen size) and sexual ornamentation in roach, Rutilus rutilus, but found that host resistance
against the most prevalent and abundant parasite species
(and measured by the proportion of dead parasites) was
positively correlated with ornamentation in males. The
observed relationship between level of steroid hormones
and sexual ornamentation in roach is consistent with the
predictions of the immunohandicap hypothesis [37].
However, studies comparing levels of steroid hormones
and immune variables are still scarce [13]. Nevertheless, a
lack of association between spleen size and either sexual
ornamentation (breeding tubercles in common bream) or

parasite infection did not seem to support the immunohandicap hypothesis [20]. The relative spleen size in fish
is recently used as an organ reflecting an immune investment against parasites or pathogens [7,20]. The negative
relationship between spleen size (as a measure of immunocompetence) and condition factor was recorded and
interpreted as a trade-off between investment in immune
response and somatic condition [20]. This observation
suggests that the spleen size is a reliable measure of investment in immune response [20]. Skarstein et al. [7] suggested that a large spleen in fish can be interpreted either
as an improving ability to respond to parasite exposure or
an indication of high immunological activity from already
established infection.
Parasitism, immunity and reproduction: inter-specific
analyses in males
Our results based on inter-specific comparative analyses
are not in accordance with the immunohandicap hypothesis [29]. Our field investigation was performed only on
reproductive males during the breeding period. If we consider that the expression of secondary sexual traits initiated by the production of testosterone is related to higher
investment in gonad size, then high parasite infection
should stimulate immune function related with decreased
investment in gonad size. A trade-off between investment
in reproduction and immune defence should be more evidenced in breeding period with increasing effort in reproduction. However, our results showed a lack of
relationship between gonad size and spleen size in fish
males, which does not seem to be biased by sampling size
as the same results were obtained including the whole fish
sample or excluding fish with low sampling size. Moreover, we should note that several comparative analyses
using spleen size measurements in birds gave consistent
results even if based on low sample size. For instance, half
of the bird species in the recent study of Møller et al. [11]
are represented by only 1 or 2 individuals.

However, until now no study has provided good evidence
that spleen size is related to humoral immune function in
fish. Future comparative studies are needed including
other immune variables such as plasma IgM concentration, cell-mediated immune response, migratory and
phagocytotic activity of head kidney granulocytes representing their functional activity, which have been applied
in the recent intra-specific studies of fish immunocompetence [13,19,45].
A relationship between parasitism and sexual dichromatism was observed in fish at the inter-family level, but
cyprinid species seem to deviate from this pattern [42].
This should by explained by the fact that many cyprinid
species did not express secondary sexual characters, i.e. in
our study only a few cyprinid species show measurable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/29

sexual traits that could be evaluated at the inter-specific
level, and with one exception there is no parental care in
the sampled cyprinid species.
Parasitism, immunity and reproduction: inter-specific
analyses in females
We found a negative relationship between spleen weight
and gonad weight in females during the breeding period
using comparative analyses, supporting the energetic
trade-off hypothesis, i.e. a cost in reproduction associated
with an investment in immune function. As this result was
confirmed from all analyses, i.e. also from the analysis
excluding the effect of low sample size and from both
phylogenetically corrected or non-corrected analyses, we
suggest that this could reflect the evolutionary life-history
allocation of energetic resources in cyprinid females.
However, the relationship between parasite abundance
and spleen weight could suggest that the increasing in
spleen weight, i.e. high investment in immune function,
represents a response to high exposition of ectoparasites
(corresponding to the higher intensity of infection by
monogenean parasites of the Dactylogyrus and Gyrodactylus
genera). This suggests that highly parasitized females
develop larger spleen as a higher investment in immune
defence.

Brown and Brown [10] investigated in birds whether
larger spleens reflect the evolution of greater immune
investment as life-history strategy or whether represent a
proximal response to current exposure to parasites. We
observed that parasite abundance or parasite species richness obtained from field data are correlated with data on
parasite species richness (Spearman correlation coefficient, p < 0.05) obtained from the regional data analysis
of Šimková et al. [46]. It means that parasite abundance
could be considered as a reliable measure of parasite pressure, integrating the information on both species richness
(diversity) and number of individuals per species. Moreover, such an integrative variable based on a composite
sampling, here abundances of several parasite species, is
more statistically effective when variance is greater than
the mean in each variable, which is the case as fish parasites are over-dispersed (fitting negative binomial distribution). Therefore, our results suggest that spleen weight
is not a simple reflection of a current parasite level, i.e. a
proximal effect. Moreover, there was a trend of difference
in spleen weight corrected for fish weight (KW test, p =
0.07) when comparing females and males with the males
having the larger spleen. The similar observation was
demonstrated in roach, Rutilus rutilus [13].

Conclusion
We interpret our results in the context of life-history theory, with host species encountering more parasites should
invest more extensively in immune defence, i.e. ultimate

or evolutionary effect, as it was already found in birds and
their ectoparasites [2] or endoparasites [4]. Our study
shows for the first time that this kind of relationship could
occur in cyprinid female fish, but not in cyprinid fish
males. Moreover, we show a parasite impact on female
reproductive potential suggesting fitness costs due to parasitism. This effect was previously demonstrated in several
studies on birds [47,48] and represents a traditional explanation for negative fitness consequences of parasitism. On
the other hand, our prediction related to the immunohandicap hypothesis was not confirmed for fish males.

Methods
Data from literature
Data on 23 cyprinid fish species from Central Europe were
used. Data on the following life-history traits were
obtained: maximal fish size, female fecundity and maximal longevity [46,49,50]. In those study the estimation of
the values of different life history traits are based on published records across Central Europe. Values of k, one
parameter of the von Bertalanffy growth function, were
obtained from FishBase [38] (Table 1). The k value is
related to longevity and is considered as a good predictor
of natural mortality [38].

Data on species richness of ectoparasites (including
Monogenea, Mollusca, Hirudinea, Copepoda) and
endoparasites (including Digenea, Cestoda, Acanthocephala and Nematoda) were obtained from Šimková
et al. [46] (Table 1).
Data from fish sampling
Among 23 fish species, a total of 21 fish species were
investigated in a field study conducted in the two last
weeks of May 2002, from the Morava river basin (Czech
Republic). We limited the sampling period in order to
eliminate the confounding effect of water temperature
changes. The collection of fish species was also attempted
to include the fish in breeding period or near their breeding period. Therefore, our sampling was time-limited in
order to collect fish in the period with no fluctuations in
water temperature, as the changes in water temperature
could affect spleen size, gonad size and the composition
of parasite communities [19]. All fish were collected by
electrofishing. Fish individuals were separated by sex. The
mean total body weight, gonad weight and spleen weight
(with their standard deviations) were measured for each
individual (data are given in Table 4). Non-breeding individuals were excluded from the analyses and only the
individuals at the same gonad maturation stage were
retained for analyses. Thus, information was restricted to
49 females of 17 fish species and 79 males of 20 species.

The complete dissection of fish was performed using the
method of Ergens and Lom [51]. Fish were examined for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/29

all metazoan parasites. Therefore, external organs (fish
skin, fins, gills, eyes) and internal organs (intestine, hepatopancreas, spleen, protonephros, heart, swim bladder)
were examined for the following groups: ectoparasites
(Monogenea, Crustacea, Mollusca and Hirudinea) and
endoparasites (Digenea, Nematoda, Cestoda and Acanthocephala). All parasites were counted under dissecting
microscope.
We used two measures of parasite impact:
- average parasite species richness, i.e. the average species
richness per individual host for a given species, which
could be split in endo- and ectoparasites. This measure
represents the parasite diversity a given fish species;
- mean total parasite abundance, which is the mean of the
sum of all parasite individuals of all parasite species in a
given fish species. This composite variable is statistically
appropriate when variance is greater than the mean for
each variable, which are the cases as fish parasite distribution follows the negative binomial distribution. Total parasite abundance represents an overall measure of parasite
pressure.
Those data are given in Table 4.
Data obtained from published resources were not adequate for analysing the potential trade-off between gonad
size (measure of reproductive investment) and spleen size
(measure of immune function) as they do not provide
information in relation to fish sex. Therefore, we used
data on parasites directly obtained from the field study
separating females and males.
Intra-specific analyses
We conducted intra-specific analyses on the males of four
fish species, for which enough individuals were collected:
Barbus barbus, Leuciscus cephalus, Pseudorasbora parva and
Rutilus rutilus.

First, we conducted a composite variance analysis on the
males in order to estimate the percentages of variance in
spleen weight and gonad weight due to fish species.
Second, we performed ANOVA on GLM to test the influence of average parasite species richness, mean total parasite abundance, body weight on (1) gonad weight and (2)
spleen weight. The variables were log transformed prior
analyses.
Comparative analyses
The phylogenetic independent contrasts method was used
[52] with the CAIC program for Macintosh [53]. The phylogeny of cyprinid fish species was obtained from the

molecular analyses of the combined sequences of cytochrome b, 16S and control region of mtDNA [54]. All continuous variables were log-transformed before analysis to
achieve homogeneity of variance [55]. We controlled for
the non-violation of assumptions of the independent contrasts method [53,56].

We tested (1) the respective importance of fish life history
traits in determining total parasite species richness,
ectoparasite species richness and endoparasite species
richness, (2) the influence of parasite abundance and species richness on spleen and gonad weights by performing
a stepwise regression forced through the origin [57] on all
independent variables.
Because of the allometric relationship with maximal fish
size; female fecundity and maximal longevity were corrected for maximal fish size using residuals of log-transformed life trait versus log-transformed maximal fish size.
