Abstract
Background: Circulating memory T cells can be divided into tissue-specific subsets, which traffic
through distinct tissue compartments during physiologic immune surveillance, based on their
expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. We reasoned that a bias (either
enrichment or depletion) of CSF T cell expression of known organ-specific trafficking determinants
might suggest that homing of T cells to the subarachnoid space could be governed by a CNS-specific
adhesion molecule or chemokine receptor.
Results: The expression of cutaneous leukocyte antigen (CLA) and CC-chemokine receptor 4
(CCR4; associated with skin-homing) as well as the expression of integrin α4β7 and CCR9
(associated with gut-homing) was analyzed on CD4+ memory T cells in CSF from individuals with
non-inflammatory neurological diseases using flow cytometry. CSF contained similar proportions
of CD4+ memory T cells expressing CLA, CCR4, integrin α4β7 and CCR9 as paired blood samples.
Conclusion: The results extend our previous findings that antigen-experienced CD4+ memory T
cells traffic through the CSF in proportion to their abundance in the peripheral circulation.
Furthermore, the ready access of skin- and gut-homing CD4+ memory T cells to the CNS
compartment via CSF has implications for the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutic
strategies, such as oral tolerance or therapeutic immunization, where immunogens are
administered using an oral or subcutaneous route.

Background
The differentiation of naïve T cells into an activated memory phenotype is characterized by an extensive change in
the expression of trafficking determinants, resulting in the

acquisition of homing receptors that enable the cells to
migrate from the circulation into peripheral tissues. This
change in T cell homing potential is affected by the microenvironment where initial antigen recognition occurred,

as memory T cells preferentially return to regions of the
body similar to those where the initial antigen was
encountered [1]. For instance, studies in mice have demonstrated that CD4+ T cells activated in cutaneous lymph
nodes upregulate trafficking determinants specific for the
skin, such as P-selectin ligand, while T cells responding to
antigen in intestinal lymph nodes express high levels the
gut-associated adhesion molecule integrin α4β7 and
acquire responsiveness to the intestinal CC-chemokine
ligand CCL25 [2]. The specific profile of adhesion molecules and chemoattractant receptors expressed by individual T cells allows the cells to interact with the vascular
endothelium at anatomical sites where the cognate ligands are selectively expressed, targeting the cells to specific
tissues [3,4]. The relevance of such interactions has been
amply demonstrated in humans, where postcapillary
venules in the inflamed skin selectively express E-selectin
and CCL17, while lamina propria of the small intestines
displays the mucosal addressin MAdCAM-1 and CCL25
[5-7]. Interestingly, T cells isolated from the small intestines and the skin are almost completely dichotomous in
their expression of trafficking determinants; T cells from
the skin express cutaneous leukocyte antigen (CLA) and
CCR4, but lack integrin α4β7, while T cells from the small
intestines are positive for α4β7, but not CLA or CCR4
[6,8-10]. Consequently, circulating T cells can be divided
into tissue specific subsets, each of which have the ability
to traffic through certain tissue compartments, but which
are excluded from others.
While trafficking of T cells to the skin and gut is well characterized, less is known about the mechanisms governing
homing of T cells across the choroid plexus into the CSF
during immune surveillance of the healthy brain [11].
Although it has been hypothesized that such CSF-specific
trafficking determinants exist, their molecular specificity
has been evasive. Some progress has been made in defining trafficking determinants for inflamed CNS microvessels: CD8+ T cells activated in cervical lymph nodes
draining intracerebral tumors in the mouse acquire a phenotype characterized by high expression of the two
integrins α4 and α1 as well as a modest increase in the
expression of P-selectin ligand [12]. Functional data supports a role for P-selectin/E-selectin and their ligands
(including CLA) as well as integrin α4β1 (VLA-4) in
extravasation of lymphocytes in the CNS during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), but the
relevance of these findings for trafficking of T cells across
non-inflamed vessels during immune surveillance of the
healthy brain remains unclear [13-16]. T cells in the CSF
of healthy individuals or patients with non-inflammatory
neurological diseases (NIND) are characterized by high
expression of integrin αLβ2 (LFA-1), α4β1, CCR5 and
CXCR3 [17,18], a phenotype they share with activated T
cells isolated from a wide range of other organs [19-22].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/14

Therapeutic α4-integrin blockade suppressed access of
several cell types (CD4>CD8 T cells; CD19+ B cells;
CD138+ plasma cells) into CSF [23], identifying the first
functional CSF entry determinant for human lymphocytes.
In this study we addressed the expression of trafficking
determinants known to be involved in organ-specific trafficking to the skin (CLA and CCR4) and the small intestines (integrin α4β7 and CCR9) on CSF T cells from
patients with NIND. We reasoned that any bias in CD4+
T cell expression of these known organ-specific trafficking
determinants in the CSF might aid in identifying CNSspecific adhesion molecules or chemokine receptors. By
contrast, equal presence of tissue-committed T cells in the
blood and CSF would indicate that memory T cells enter
CSF according to their activation or differentiation state
but possibly not by specific homing molecules. We
observed comparable frequencies of CD4+ memory T
cells displaying CLA and CCR4 as well as integrin α4β7
and CCR9 in paired blood and CSF samples. The results
demonstrated that, in contrast to most other tissues, skinand gut-homing T cells are not excluded from the CSF,
suggesting that the recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the CNS
is more related to previous antigen exposure and activation than to the expression of an organ-specific adhesion
molecule or chemokine receptor. Although negative with
regard to roles for CCR9/α4β7 or CCR4/CLA, for CSF
homing, the results carry implications for the use of novel
immunotherapeutic strategies to treat neurological diseases. In particular, several new techniques for treating
diverse neurological disorders require the generation of
neuroantigen-specific T cells by peripheral administration
of antigen either subcutaneously or to the gastrointestinal
mucosa. Our current results indicate that skin- and guthoming memory T cells readily access the CNS compartment, providing a rationale for the feasibility of such strategies.

Results

CD4+ memory T cells expressing CLA and integrin α4β7
are present in the CSF
Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of
CLA and integrin α4β7, two adhesion molecules involved
in the selective recruitment of T cells to the skin and gut,
respectively (reviewed by [1]), on T cells in paired blood
and CSF samples from four NIND patients. Since many
trafficking determinants are differentially expressed on
naïve and memory T cells and CSF contains predominantly CD4+ T cells, of which almost all display a phenotype consistent with previously activated memory cells
[18], we compared the expression of CLA and integrin
α4β7 on CD4+/CD45RA- cells (excluding both CD45RAhi
and CD45RAintermediate cells). The majority of CD4+/
CD45RA- T cells in the CSF did not express either CLA or

to technical reasons, we used the presence of CD45RO to
determine the population of memory CD4+ T cells for all
CCR4 stainings (Figure 2). CCR4 was expressed by 41.7 ±
8.2% of CD4+/CD45RO+ memory T cells in the CSF from
patients with NIND (Table 1). Consistent with a shared
homing profile to the skin, a majority of CLA+ memory T
cells in the CSF co-expressed CCR4, but some CCR4 staining could be detected also on CLA- memory T cells (Figure
2). Numbers of CCR4+/CD4+/CD45RO+ T cells in the
CSF were slightly lower than in paired blood samples
(59.8 ± 10.8%), but this difference was not statistically
significant (n = 5; p = 0.09).

CLA (7.2 ± 3.0%) or integrin α4β7 (17.4 ± 3.5%) were,
however, detected in the CSF. Interestingly, the pattern of
CLA and integrin α4β7 expression on CD4+/CD45RAmemory T cells in the CSF was strikingly similar to peripheral blood (Figure 1), demonstrating that skin- and guthoming T cells are not excluded from the CNS compartment.
Expression of CCR4 on CSF T cells
Next, we assessed CSF expression of CCR4, a chemokine
receptor highly expressed by skin-homing T cells [5]. Due

Since CCR4 has been associated with a Th2 phenotype
[24,25], CSF levels of CCR4 were analyzed in six patients
with multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease associated with
Th1 responses in the CNS [26]. MS patients had slightly
lower numbers of CCR4+/CD4+/CD45RO+ T cells in the
CSF compared to paired blood samples (Table 1; p <
0.01), but CCR4 was still expressed by approximately
50% of all CD4+/CD45RO+ T cells in the CSF. By carefully analyzing the profile of chemokine receptors on Th1
and Th2 cells, it has been demonstrated that Th2 cells predominantly are CCR4+/CXCR3-, while the population of
CCR4+/CXCR3+ memory T cells not is enriched for Th2
cells [27]. We observed that a majority of CCR4+ memory
T cells in the CSF co-expressed CXCR3 and that the numbers of CCR4+/CXCR3- "true" Th2 cells in the CSF were
low (Figure 2).
The expression of CCR4 on CSF T cells was assessed using
two different anti-CCR4 mAbs, clones 328B and 1G1. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that clone 328B
resulted in a distinct staining of CSF T cells as described
above, whereas clone 1G1 failed to detect any CCR4+ T
cells in the CSF (data not shown). To confirm the expression of CCR4 on CSF T cells, RNA was isolated from CSF
cells obtained from one patient with mononuclear pleiocytosis during the follow-up after postinfectious myelitis.
Using real-time rt-PCR, we were able to verify that CSF
mononuclear cells expressed CCR4 mRNA at slightly

Multi-color flow cytometry was used to analyze the co-expression of CCR4 with CLA or CXCR3 on memory T cells in paired
blood and CSF samples from an individual patient with a non-inflammatory neurological disease (A-D) or MS (E-F). The expression of trafficking determinants was analyzed on CD4+/CD45RO+ memory T cells to account for the different percentages of
naïve and memory CD4+ cells in blood (A) and CSF (B). As expected, there was an association between the expression of
CCR4 and CLA on CD4+/CD45RO+ T cells in peripheral blood (C). A majority of CLA+ memory T cells co-expressed CCR4
also in the CSF, but some CCR4 staining could be detected on CLA- memory T cells (D). While a large population of CCR4+/
CXCR3- cells, which have been demonstrated to be enriched for Th2 cells [27], were present in peripheral blood (E), such
cells were rare in the CSF (F).

higher levels compared to PBMCs from the same individual (data not shown).
Preliminary stainings showed that CCR10, another chemokine receptor expressed by skin-homing T cells [28], was
only expressed by a negligible percentage of CD4+ memory T cells both in blood and CSF and was thus not investigated closer (data not shown).
CCR9 expression on CSF T cells
Finally, the expression of CCR9, associated with homing
of T cells to the intestines [6,7], was examined in the CSF.
CCR9 was expressed by 5.1 ± 4.3% of CD4+/CD45RAmemory T cells in the CSF from patients with NIND, a frequency that was almost identical to peripheral blood (8.0
± 2.8%; p = 0.1; Table 1). As expected, CCR9 expression
was predominantly detected on CD4+/CD45RA- T cells
co-expressing integrin β7 both in blood and CSF (Figure
3). Since the β7 subunit can dimerize not only with α4
(forming the α4β7 heterodimer, which is associated with
gut-homing) but also with integrin αE (CD103), we
stained CSF cells using an antibody against αE to exclude
that CCR9 was associated with integrin αEβ7 in the CSF.
Virtually no CD4+/CD45RA- T cells in the CSF were, however, positive for αE (data not shown), confirming that
gut-homing CCR9/α4β7 double positive memory T cells
are present in the CSF.

Discussion
This study demonstrated that CD4+ memory T cells in the
CSF exhibit a distinctly different expression pattern of
adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors compared
to most tissue-infiltrating T cell populations. It is well
established that T cells isolated from the small intestines

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/14

and the skin are nearly homogenously positive for mutually exclusive pairs of trafficking determinants; almost all
T cells from the skin express CLA and CCR4, but lack
integrin α4β7 or CCR9, while T cells from the small intestines are positive for integrin α4β7 and CCR9, but not
CLA or CCR4 [5,6,8,10]. This highly polarized pattern is
believed to result from selective recruitment of T cells
expressing the appropriate trafficking determinants from
a pool of tissue-committed and non-committed T cells in
the systemic circulation. It is plausible that additional tissue-committed T cell populations exist, since T cells from
most other tissue compartments, including bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and liver, do not express CLA,
integrin α4β7, CCR4 or CCR9, suggesting that hitherto
unknown combinations of adhesion molecules and
chemokine receptors mediate organ-specific homing to
these organs [9,10,29]. CSF from NIND patients contained, on the contrary, comparable numbers of CD4+
memory T cells expressing trafficking determinants specific for the skin (CLA and CCR4) and the small intestines
(integrin α4β7 and CCR9) as paired samples from peripheral blood. Even though percentages of CD4+ memory T
cells expressing CCR4 and integrin α4β7 were slightly
lower in CSF compared to blood, the results demonstrate
that skin- and gut-homing T cells access the CSF. These
findings argue that T cell homing to the CSF is characterized by recruitment of a wide spectrum of tissue-specific T
cell subpopulations. Aside from the established role of
α4-integrin [23], the trafficking determinants involved in
CSF trafficking remain to be defined.
These results address a key question regarding the feasibility of several experimental therapies for neurological conditions utilizing antigenic stimulation in the periphery
(such as the skin or the gut) to produce a population of T
cells, which are intended to act in the CNS. Such therapies
include peripheral immunization against A-beta for
Alzheimer's disease [30,31], sensitization with self antigens to generate myelin-reactive T cells for the amelioration of spinal contusion and neurodegeneration [32,33],
as well as injection of altered peptide ligands [34,35] and
oral administration of myelin to induce tolerance for the
treatment of MS [34]. In recent years, such innovative
approaches have been assessed in experimental animal
models and in clinical trials, with provocative results [35].
To our knowledge, the only other tissue compartment
besides CSF, which contains tissue-committed T cells specific for a different compartment is synovial fluid. Analogous to the present observations, synovial fluid from
patients with arthritis contained comparable numbers of
CD4+ memory T cells expressing CLA, integrin α4β7 and
CCR4 as peripheral blood [10]. Both CSF and synovial
fluid are sterile tissue fluids and the pathways for immune
surveillance of such fluids may be different from the

parenchyma itself. It has generally been assumed that cells
in the CSF are derived from the brain parenchyma and
reflect processes ongoing in the tissue compartment.
Recent intravital microscopy studies have, however, demonstrated that leukocyte migration through the bloodbrain barrier surrounding deep parenchymal vessels of the
brain is an uncommon event in the non-inflamed murine
brain [16], while fluorescently labeled splenocytes readily
were detected in the meninges and choroid plexus within
two hours after adoptive transfer [14]. Vasculature in the
choroid plexus and meninges, but not in the noninflamed human brain, express adhesion molecules supporting interactions with circulating leukocytes, suggesting that activated memory T cells may enter the CSF
directly from the systemic circulation as part of immune
surveillance of the CNS [36]. It is conceivable that in addition to the well characterized pathways of organ-specific
homing to tissues in direct contact with the outside environment such as skin and gut, there may be distinct mechanisms controlling homing of antigen-experienced
lymphocytes to sterile tissue fluids. The majority of CNS
infections are derived from pathogens, which initially
entered the body through mucosal sites or the skin, rendering it likely that memory T cells primed in these locations may mount the appropriate intrathecal immune
response. In contrast, pathogens causing infections in the
skin or the intestines are predominantly locally derived
and a compartmentalized immune response may under
these circumstances be phylogenetically beneficial.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that CLA+/CCR4+ and α4β7+/
CCR9+ memory T cells are present in the CSF during
immune surveillance of the CNS. Homing of T cells to the
CSF during immune surveillance may be more tuned to
distinguish between naïve and antigen-experienced T cells
than among various tissue-specialized memory T cell populations. The ready access of skin- and gut-homing CD4+
T cells to the CNS compartment via CSF provide a rationale for the use of immunotherapeutic strategies, such as
oral tolerance or therapeutic immunization, where immunogens are administered using an oral or subcutaneous
route.

Methods
CSF samples
Blood and CSF were obtained from a total of 29 patients
(20 women). The majority of the patients were referred for
diagnostic lumbar puncture. In addition, three patients
with known MS being evaluated for intrathecal baclofen
treatment for intractable spasticity were included. The collection of blood and CSF samples was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) and written consent was obtained from all
subjects. Because of limited cell numbers, the analysis of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/7/14

cell phenotypes in each sample was restricted to one or
two trafficking determinants, along with cell lineage
markers. The age of the patients ranged between 18–80
years (mean 43 years). When reviewing the charts, it
turned out that 22 patients had non-inflammatory neurological diseases {NIND; headaches (6 patients), paresthesias (5), CSF circulation disturbances (3), chronic pain
(3), vertigo (2), polyneuropathy (2), and mitochondrial
cytopathy (1)}, six patients had clinically definite MS in
remission [37], and one patient presented with pleiocytosis during follow-up after postinfectious myelitis. Three of
the MS patients were treated with immunomodulatory
drugs at the time of sampling (glatiramer-acetate or interferon-β1b). The CSF leukocyte count of the NIND patients
ranged between 0–2 cells/µl (mean 0.8 cell/µl), while the
CSF leukocyte count of the MS patients ranged between
2–41 cells/µl (mean 9.3 cells/µl). RNA was isolated from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CSF
cells from the patient with postinfectious myelitis (CSF
leukocyte count 13 cells/µl).

Flow cytometry
Immunostainings for flow cytometry were performed as
previously described [18]. Paired blood (5 ml) and CSF
(10 ml) samples were collected and stained within 20 min
of sampling. Staining was performed at room temperature
for 15 min (CCR9, αE, β7) or on ice for 45 min (CCR4,
CLA, α4β7). Titrations were performed for each mAb in
blood samples to define the concentration that resulted in
saturating conditions and an optimal signal to noise ratio.
Identical concentrations of mAbs were used for blood and
CSF samples, as numbers of CSF cells per staining never
exceeded the number of cells in peripheral blood. Erythrocytes were lysed after staining whole blood using FACS
lysing solution (BD Biosciences).

Cells were acquired on an LSR (BD Immunocytometry
Systems, San Jose, CA) or a MoFlo flow cytometer (Cytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO) and analyzed using WinList software (Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, ME).

Cells were gated according to forward- and side light-scattering properties, and were positively selected for the presence of CD4 in combination with high expression of
CD45RO (for all stainings containing CCR4) or the
absence of CD45RA (for all other stainings) to identify
CD4+ memory T cells. Isotype matched control mAbs
were used to define background fluorescence.
