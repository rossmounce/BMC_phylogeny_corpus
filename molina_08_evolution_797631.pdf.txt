Abstract
Background: Across all sequenced bacterial genomes, the number of domains nc in different
functional categories c scales as a power-law in the total number of domains n, i.e. n c ∝ n a c , with
exponents αc that vary across functional categories. Here we investigate the implications of these
scaling laws for the evolution of domain-content in bacterial genomes and derive the simplest
evolutionary model consistent with these scaling laws.
Results: We show that, using only an assumption of time invariance, the scaling laws uniquely
determine the relative rates of domain additions and deletions across all functional categories and
evolutionary lineages. In particular, the model predicts that the rate of additions and deletions of
domains of category c is proportional to the number of domains nc currently in the genome and we
discuss the implications of this observation for the role of horizontal transfer in genome evolution.
Second, in addition to being proportional to nc, the rate of additions and deletions of domains of
category c is proportional to a category-dependent constant ρc, which is the same for all
evolutionary lineages. This 'evolutionary potential' ρc represents the relative probability for
additions/deletions of domains of category c to be fixed in the population by selection and is
predicted to equal the scaling exponent αc. By comparing the domain content of 93 pairs of closelyrelated genomes from all over the phylogenetic tree of bacteria, we demonstrate that the model's
predictions are supported by available genome-sequence data.
Conclusion: Our results establish a direct quantitative connection between the scaling of domain
numbers with genome size, and the rate of addition and deletions of domains during short
evolutionary time intervals.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Eugene V. Koonin, Martijn A. Huynen, and Sergei Maslov.

Background
When the first gene sequences became available in the
1960s some striking and unexpected patterns were
observed. For example, comparison of the fossil record
with the number of amino acid substitutions separating
orthologous proteins in mammals [1] suggested a con-

stant rate of amino acid substitutions. In addition, the
inferred rate of amino acid substitutions was so high that
it was hard to imagine how all of these substitutions could
have been fixed by the action of natural selection [2]. This
famously lead Kimura to propose the neutral theory of
molecular evolution [3]. Neutral evolution became the de

facto null model of sequence evolution and the availability of such a null model was crucial for the development
of rigorous methods for reconstructing evolutionary phylogenies (e.g. [4]) and methods for detecting selection acting on gene sequences (e.g. [5,6]).

the scaling laws are time invariant, we derive a 'null
model' for genome evolution that accounts for the
observed scaling laws. In this model the exponents of the
scaling laws are identified as universal constants of the
evolutionary process.

Evolution of course also takes place at higher levels of
organization than substitutions within protein-coding
genes. In particular, large genomic segments containing
one or more genes can be duplicated or deleted, and segments can be 'horizontally transfered', i.e. taken from one
organism's genome and inserted into another organism's
genome. Through such events organisms can vary the
gene content of their genomes, acquiring genes with new
functions, sub-functionalizing existing functions, or deleting genes whose functions are no longer required. Now
that the sequences of several hundred of whole microbial
genomes have become available over the last decade it has
become possible to investigate variation in gene-content
across genomes in a quantitative manner.

We collected 93 pairs of closely-related bacterial genomes
and tested the model's predictions by analyzing the protein-domain content of these genomes and estimating, for
each pair, the rates at which additions and deletions of
domains from different categories have occurred since
their common ancestor. We show that essentially all of the
model's predictions are supported by the available
genome data. Finally, we also discuss the important implications of our results for the role of horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution.

Studies of gene content have uncovered several striking
quantitative 'laws'. First of all, it was noticed [7-9] that a
number of key genomic quantities show power-law distributions. In particular, the distribution of gene family sizes
is a power-law in each genome, whose exponent appears
to depend mostly on the size of the genome. Several theoretical models have been put forward for explaining
these power-law distributions, which all include gene
duplications and deletions as key ingredients. Another
striking observation [10] is that the numbers of genes in
different functional categories scale as power-laws in the
total number of genes in the genome. For example,
whereas the numbers of genes involved in different types
of metabolism scale approximately linear with genome
size, the number of genes involved with regulatory processes such as transcription regulation and signal transduction scales roughly quadratically with genome size, and
the number of genes involved with basic processes such as
DNA replication or cell division scales with an exponent
less than 1. Such scaling laws are observed for the large
majority of high-level functional categories of genes and
appear to apply to all bacterial genomes.
As we have argued previously [10,11], these scaling laws
have important implications for the evolutionary dynamics of gene duplications and deletions and we will here
investigate these implications in detail. The organization
of the paper is as follows. We study genome evolution at
the level of protein domains and we start by demonstrating that scaling laws are also observed at the level of the
number of protein-domains.
We re-estimate the scaling exponents αc using all 630 currently available genomes. Next, using the assumption that

Results and Discussion
Scaling laws in protein domain occurrences
Although genes are natural units in genome analysis there
are some disadvantages to using genes as the central units
in the analysis of the evolution of genome content. For
example, apart from being able to mutate, duplicate, and
be deleted, it is well-known that, not infrequently, two
genes can fuse into one, single genes can split into two
[12], and genes can evolve de novo from non-coding
sequence. Such events significantly complicate the analysis of the evolution of gene content.

Protein domains form more natural units for the study of
the evolution of gene-content for several reasons. It can be
argued that protein domains act like 'evolutionary atoms'
to a certain extent [9]; Protein domains form functional
units [13] that cannot be split into smaller units, and a
single protein domain can, in general, not be constructed
by fusing multiple occurrences of other protein domains.
Therefore, we can safely assume that almost all changes in
the number of occurrences in the genome of a given protein domain are due to deletions, duplications, or the horizontal transfer of a domain from another organism's
genome. We thus decided to study the evolution of functional gene content in terms of the number of occurrences
of different protein domains. Among databases of protein
domains Pfam [14] is attractive because the Pfam domain
families are disjoint, i.e. at the default settings it is guaranteed that any given DNA sequence segment will be classified to belong to at most one domain family. We thus
used Pfam domains as our evolutionary 'atoms'.
We counted the number of occurrences of each Pfam
domain in each fully sequenced bacterial genome (Methods). Using a mapping from Pfam to Gene Ontology categories [15] we determined, for each genome g, the total
number of domains n(g) that can be associated with any

GO category and, for each GO category c, the number of
domains nc(g) occurring in the genome.
Figure 1 shows, for 3 example categories, the number of
domains in that category as a function of the total number
of domains in the genome (that can be mapped to a GO
category). As the figure shows, for all three categories the
number of genes in the category nc scales as a power-law
in the total number of domains in the genome n, i.e.
bc ac

nc = e n ,

(1)

with both the pre-factors βc and the exponents αc varying
between categories. These power-laws are observed for the
large majority of high-level functional categories. For each
GO category we fitted a power-law of the form (1) using a
Bayesian procedure which in particular provides a posterior probability distribution for the exponent αc (Methods). We selected 156 GO categories that occur in at least
95% of all genomes and that show good power-law fits

(Methods). The inferred exponents match what we found
previously based on the gene-number analysis of a much
smaller number of genomes [10,11], i.e. for basic processes such as translation and DNA repair exponents are
low, whereas exponents for regulatory functions such a
regulation of transcription and signal transduction are
largest. The inferred exponents for all 156 selected categories are listed in Additional file 1.
Evolutionary Model
We want to investigate the implications of the scaling laws
(1) for evolutionary dynamics. That is, we want to infer
what the scaling laws imply for the behavior of the
domain number counts nc(t) as a function of time t. It is
important to define precisely what we mean by nc(t). A
sequenced genome g represents a particular bacterial
strain and can idealistically be thought of as representing
the genome of a single bacterial organism living today
with domain counts nc(g). Since bacteria reproduce clonally we can imagine tracing this individual back through

time, back to its mother cell, its grandmother, and eventually all the way back until the common ancestor of all currently sequenced genomes. We denote by nc(g, t) the
number of domains of category c that were present in the
ancestor organism of genome g that was living at time t.
Let tnow denote today and let xc(g, t) denote the logarithm
of the domain-number, i.e. xc(g, t) = log[nc(g, t)], and similarly x(g, t) = log[n(g, t)]. In these variables the scaling
laws are just straight lines, i.e all genomes g (approximately) obey the linear relation
xc(g, ttoday) = αcx(g, ttoday) + βc ∀g.

(2)

We will now derive how these scaling laws constrain the
changes in domain-numbers that have occurred throughout time. Let t = 0 denote the time at which the last common ancestor of all sequenced bacterial genomes was
alive. Note that, since the GO categories that we consider
occur in almost all genomes, it is reasonable to assume
that they all had nonzero count in the last common ancestor. We let xc(0) denote the log-domain counts in this
common ancestor and x(0) the logarithm of the total
domain count. Further, we denote by dxc(g, t) the change
in the log domain-count for category c, that occurred in a
small interval of time centered around time t in the evolutionary history of genome g. The log domain-counts xc(g,
t) and x(g, t) are then by definition given by the integrals

x c ( g , t now ) = x c (0) +

x( g , t now ) = x(0) +

and

Comparing equations (3) and (4) with equation (2) the
scaling laws thus imply that we have

(5)

Since (5) must hold for all genomes g, this equation first
of all implies a relation between the offsets βc and the
domain counts in the last common ancestor:

βc = xc(0) - αcx(0).

(6)

For short time intervals in which the changes in nc are
small relative to nc itself, the changes in xc are related to the
changes in nc through

(10)

Equation (10) summarizes the implications for domaincount dynamics implied by the scaling laws. It states that,
independent of which evolutionary history we take, the
ratio of the integrals of dnc/nc and dn/n over all evolutionary time must match the scaling exponent αc. This is illustrated on the left-hand side of figure 2, i.e. equation (10)
implies that the ratio of integrals is the same for each of
the evolutionary histories indicated as colored lines.
Time Invariance
The equations (10) reflect the constraints on domaincount dynamics implied by the scaling laws but they don't
uniquely determine an evolutionary model. To derive a
unique evolutionary null model we will assume time invariance of the scaling laws. We assume that, if we had collected genomes of bacteria living several tens or even
hundreds of million years ago, as opposed to the bacteria
living today, we would have observed the same scaling
laws as we observe today. That is, we assume that there is
nothing particularly special about our current time, and
that the same scaling laws have held since the last common ancestor, or at least since the origin of the clades
from which our current genome sequences derive. We feel
that this is by far the simplest assumption that can be
made about the evolutionary dynamics and will here analyze its implications.

Given that the scaling laws are invariant in time, we
immediately obtain that (10) should hold for each short
time interval, i.e. we have that

dn c ( g ,t )
dn( g ,t )
= ac
∀g , t ,
n c ( g ,t )
n( g ,t )

More importantly, we find that all genomes must obey

Evolutionary histories and time invariance

assumption of time invariance now implies relations between the domain-count changes during short time intervals which can
be tested by comparing domain-counts in closely-related genomes (right panel).

(12)

That is, the assumption of time invariance implies that,
for each genome g, and for each short time interval in its
evolution, the ratio between the change dnc(g, t) in the
domain-count of category c and the total change dn(g, t)
in domain-count is given by the product of the exponent
αc and the fraction nc(g, t)/n(g, t) of all domains that are of
category c. In particular, equation (12) will apply to the
domain-count changes that occurred since the common
ancestors of pairs of closely-related species, as illustrated
on the right-hand side of Fig. 2. Therefore, we can test the
validity of the null model by comparing the domaincounts in the genomes of closely-related bacteria.
Implications for closely-related pairs of genomes
We now discuss how the prediction (12) can be tested
with data from closely-related genomes. Note that, strictly
speaking, (12) holds only in the limit of infinitesimally
small dn(g, t) and that we have so far implicitly assumed
that the nc(g, t) are continuous variables, whereas in reality the smallest possible change is dn(g, t) = 1. For the integer-valued quantities nc(g, t) equation (12) can be
interpreted as follows: whenever a single domain is added
to the genome, i.e. dn = 1, then the probability that this
domain is of category c is given by αcnc/n. Similarly, whenever a single domain is removed, i.e. dn = -1, then the
probability that this domain is of category c is also given
by αcnc/n.

Since this interpretation is of key conceptual importance
we briefly expand on its meaning.
Mathematically, equation (10) makes a statement about
the total overall changes in domain counts that happen
over some finite time interval. In particular, the total
change dnc that occurs over some time interval is the difference between the number of additions and deletions that
occurred during that time interval. From a mathematical
point of view, equation (11) is a differential equation that
makes a statement about the relative rates at which
changes in domain-count number occur, i.e. including
both additions and deletions. To put it differently, the
assumption of time invariance allows us to make statements about time intervals so short that at most one
'event' can occur during such intervals, so that there is
roughly speaking no room left for additions and deletions
to cancel each other out, i.e. the relation (11) must hold
for both of them. The clearest interpretation is in terms of
a model where the key quantities are the rates, i.e. probability of an event per unit time, at which domain-count
changes (either additions or deletions) take place. That is,
if r denotes the overall rate at which additions or deletions
occur, and rc the rate at which additions/deletions of
domains of category c occur, then the model predicts

from a common ancestor is generally very small compared to the total number of domains. Therefore, the fractions nc/n have generally changed little during the time

scales and the straight lines show least-squares linear fits

since the two genomes diverged from their ancestor and
we will make the assumption that the fraction nc/n can be

The left panel of Fig. 3 demonstrates two points. First,
comparing the three categories with each other, we see
that most domain-count changes occur in the most abundant category and least domain-count changes occur in
the least abundant category, with the fraction of domain-

considered constant. Under this approximation equation
(13) predicts that, if during the time interval since the
pair's common ancestor, a total of Δn domain-count
changes occurred, i.e. the sum of all additions and deletions, then the expected number of domain-count
changes Δnc in category c (which is again the sum of all
additions and deletions in this category) should equal
n
a c nc Δn

We collected 93 pairs of fully-sequenced genomes that are
evolutionary relatively closely related, using the tree of life
that was inferred by Ciccarelli et al. [16] as a guide (Methods). For each pair of genomes i we counted the numbers
of domain occurrences for each Pfam family and used
these (Methods) to estimate the number of domain-count
changes

i
Δn c

for each category c and the total number of

i
domain-count changes Δni. Again, we stress that the Δn c

are the estimated total number of changes, adding additions and deletions together. For example, if we denote by
i
dn c the difference in the number of domains in category c

occurring in the two genomes of the pair, then we typii
i
cally find that the estimated Δn c is larger than dn c (see
i
Additional file 1). Apart from estimating Δn c we estii
mated, for each genome pair i, the fractions n c / n i by

averaging the domain counts over the two genomes in the
pair (Methods). Our model thus predicts that, for each
i
pair i, the ratio Δn c / Δn i should be proportional both to
i
the fraction n c / n i and to scaling law exponent αc.

The fraction of domain-count changes is proportional to
the number of existing domains
Equation (13) puts very strong constraints on the dynamics of domain-counts which we will check in three steps.
First, we check that, for each category c, the estimated frac-

tions Δnc/Δn of domain-count changes grow linearly with
the fractions nc/n. The left panel of figure 3 shows scatter
i
i
plots of Δn c / Δn i as a function of n c / n i for three

selected categories. The axes are shown on logarithmic

i
i
of the form log[Δn c / Δn i ] = g c log[n c / n i ] + d c .

i
count changes Δn c / Δn i indeed scaling roughly linearly
i
with n c / n i (compare with the dotted guide lines show-

ing linear scaling). Beyond that, if we compare the numbers of domain-count changes across the different
genomes within each category we see that, in those
genomes where the domains of the category are most
abundant domain-count changes in that category are also
most abundant. That is, although the data is quite noisy,
it is clear that all three clouds of points show a close to lini
i
ear increase of Δn c / Δn i with n c / n i .

The estimated slopes γc for all selected GO categories are
shown in the right panel of Fig. 3 (and listed in Additional
file 1). The estimated γc are very roughly symmetrically
distributed around 1 with a median γc of 1.16. For almost
75% of the categories a slope of γc = 1 is within the 99%
posterior probability interval.
This thus supports the prediction of our evolutionary null
model that the fraction of all domain-count changes that
involve domains of category c is proportional to the fraction nc/n of all domains in the genome that belong to category c.
For about 25% of the categories we infer slopes significantly deviating from 1. It should be noted, however, that
the least-squares fitting assumes simple Gaussian noise in
log[Δnc/Δn], whereas in reality the size of the noise in
log[Δnc/Δn] increases as Δn decreases. Moreover, whereas
the fitting assumes that the numbers of domain-count
changes are given, in reality these are estimated (see Methods) and thus themselves subject to uncertainty. We therefore are significantly underestimating the uncertainty in
the fitted slope for many categories, and it is reasonable to
conclude that for most if not all categories the data is consistent with the predicted linear dependence of Δnc/Δn on
nc/n.
Evolutionary Potentials
The results of the previous section support that the rate rc

of domain-count changes involving domains of category c
is proportional to the number of domains nc currently

Using this equation we estimated ρc for each selected category c. Equation (13) predicts that the evolutionary
potentials ρc equal the scaling exponents αc. Figure 5
shows a scatter plot of αc against the estimated ρc.
Note that, since the evolutionary potential ρc is a measure
of the relative frequency of domain-count changes
between closely-related species, and αc is a measure of the
scaling of the number of domains with genome size, there
is a priori no reason why these two quantities should be
strongly correlated. However, as predicted by our evolutionary null model, there is clear evidence of a linear
dependency between the exponents αc and the evolutionary potentials ρc.
Rather than a simple relation ρc = αc we find that ρc varies
over a somewhat smaller range, i.e. the 99% posterior
probability interval for the slope of the correlation runs
from 0.65 to 0.79. One possible explanation is that,
because the estimation of the numbers of domain-count
changes Δnc is the same for all categories, we might under-

estimate the numbers of domain-count changes more for
categories with large ρc than for categories with low ρc.
Implications for the rates of horizontal transfer
In general, the rate at which additions/deletions occur is
the product of two independent factors. First, the rate at
which domain additions and deletions are introduced into
individuals of the population, and second the fraction of
the time that such mutations are being fixed into the population. There are likely three main mechanisms through
which domain additions or deletions are introduced:
duplications, deletions, and horizontal transfers. To a first
approximation, the rates at which duplications, deletions,
and horizontal transfers are being introduced into individuals will be determined by the biases inherent in the
mechanisms underlying these processes and not by selection. In contrast, the fraction of the time that such mutations are fixed in evolution will strongly depend on
selection.

It is clear that, for duplications and deletions, the rate at
which such mutations are introduced is naturally propor-

tional to the number of existing domains nc. That is, when
the number of domains nc doubles, the total rate at which
duplications and deletions are introduced within this category also doubles. Moreover, since selection is not
involved, the rate of introduction of duplications and
deletions can be expected to be the same for all functional
categories c (except of course for transposable elements
which are duplicated through a separate mechanism).
Therefore, as the rate of introduction is proportional to nc,
with the same proportionality constant for each category,
and the total rate must be proportional to ρcnc, this
implies that the relative rate of fixation through selection
must be proportional to the evolutionary potential ρc.
Thus, the evolutionary potentials ρc (and the scaling exponents αc) have a particularly simple interpretation: they
give the average relative rate with which additions and
deletions of domains in category c are fixed by selection.
Evidence has accumulated over recent years that horizontal transfers occur in essentially all evolutionary lineages
and gene families, see e.g. [17-22] and the extensive discussion in the recent review [23]. There is less consensus
in the literature, however, regarding the precise amount
that horizontal transfer contributes to gene-content evolution. Discussion of the reasons for this lack of consensus
are beyond the scope of this article but it is clear that the
apparent disparity between the conclusions reached by
different authors is a combination of: the fact that different authors ask different questions, i.e. asking what fraction of gene families are affected by horizontal transfer at
least once in evolutionary history [24] is very different
from asking, for example, the relative rates of gene loss to
horizontal transfer [25,26]. The fact that very different
types of evidence are used, such as presence/absence of
members of a gene family across leafs of the species tree
[19,20,26], comparison of gene trees with species trees
[21,27], or the presence of genes without known
homologs [28]. And finally, the fact that there are technical issues (like the way gene families are build and tree
topologies are inferred) which may affect the results quantitatively if not qualitatively.
To the present authors the evidence currently in the literature does suggest that horizontal gene transfer accounts
for a non-negligible and maybe even a large fraction of
changes in gene content, at least among closely-related
genomes. For example, it was found in [20] that up to
20% of the gene-content of proteo-γ bacteria consists of
genes that have no homology with any of the other genes
among all currently sequenced proteo-γ bacteria, but that
do have homology with genes found outside of the proteo-γ clade. It is hard to see how this statistic could result
from any process other than a high rate of horizontal
transfer. It is thus worthwhile to investigate the implica-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/51

tions of our current findings under the assumption that
many of the domain additions are due to horizontal transfer.
Although we have no direct evidence, it is attractive to
assume that the probability that a domain addition will
be fixed in the population does not depend on the mechanism by which it was introduced. That is, the relative rate
of fixation of domain additions in category c should be
proportional to ρc for both duplicated domains as well as
horizontally transfered domains. If this is indeed the case,
it follows immediately from the fact that the overall rate
should be proportional to ρcnc, that the rate at which horizontal transfers are introduced must be proportional to
the number of domains nc present in the genome. However, whereas this is naturally the case for gene duplications, it is not clear at all why this should also hold for
horizontal transfers. Therefore, our results put rather
strong constraints on the rate of horizontal transfer.
One possibility is that horizontal transfer is negligible and
that domain additions are dominated by duplications.
However, as we have just discussed, this assumption,
which we have made in previous work [10,11], appears at
odds with recent work. It should be noted, however, that
some studies that investigate evolution of gene content
over long time scales find that horizontal transfer is only
responsible for a minor fraction of all events on a long
time scale, i.e. [21]. One hypothesis that might be worthwhile to entertain is that most horizontal transfers are
only transient. It is conceivable that horizontally transfered genes consist mostly of 'accessory' genes that are
involved with adaptations to the local environment that
are easily taken up by genomes moving into a certain environment, but which are also easily lost again when the
environment changes, so that the horizontal transfers of
these accessory genes contributes relatively little to the
gene-content dynamics on long time scales. However, at
least to these authors this hypothesis does not seem particularly plausible a priori.
Alternatively, there are several hypotheses that could
explain why the rate at which horizontal transfers of
domains of category c are introduced is proportional to
the number of domains nc already in the genome. First, it
is possible that horizontal transfer is highly biased to
occur predominantly between genomes that are closelyrelated phylogenetically. One mechanism of horizontal
gene transfer, conjugation, does indeed occur preferentially between related organisms. Since closely-related
species are likely to have highly correlated domain counts,
it is likely that the fraction nc/n of category c domains in
the donor genome is close to the fraction of domains of
category c in the receiver genome. However, many of the

Page 10 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:51

horizontal transfers detected through sequence analysis
involve transfers between distally related species.
Another possible explanation is that bacterial habitats
naturally separate into different genome-size classes. That
is, it is conceivable that bacteria tend to be surrounded
mostly by other bacteria of roughly the same genome size.
Because the scaling laws apply to all genomes, the fractions nc/n are similar for similarly sized genomes and one
would naturally have that the rate at which horizontal
transfers of domains of category c occur is proportional to
nc. As far as these authors are aware, currently there seems
to be no evidence suggesting that there is a characteristic
genome size for each bacterial habitat, but it appears that
this hypothesis should in principle be testable using
metagenomics data.
Finally, it is possible that, even though a given bacterium
would generally be surrounded by other bacteria of very
different sizes, that horizontal transfer is highly biased to
occur predominantly between organisms that have
genomes with similar sizes. In fact, there is some evidence
in the literature that bacteria can recognize and silence
horizontally transfered genes that have an AT-content
which is significantly higher than the AT-content of the
genome itself [29]. In addition, there is a good correlation
between genome size and GC-content [30]. It is therefore
conceivable that horizontal transfers between genomes of
similar size are much more common than horizontal
transfers between genomes of significantly different sizes.
In any case, whatever the underlying mechanism, if horizontal transfers account for a significant fraction of
domain additions through evolution, then something
must ensure that the rate of introduction of such horizontal transfers is proportional to the number of existing
domains nc in the receiving genome.

Conclusion
We have shown that, across all bacteria and for most highlevel GO categories c, the number of domain occurrences
nc scales as a power-law in the total number of domains n,
with scaling exponents αc varying from close to zero to a
bit larger than 2. We have derived what we believe is the
simplest evolutionary model that can account for the
observed scaling laws. This 'null model' assumes that,
across all evolutionary lineages and all evolutionary
times, the relative rate rc/r at which additions and deletions of domains of category c are fixed in evolution is
proportional to the current fraction nc/n of domains in
category c and a characteristic evolutionary potential ρc
which equals the scaling exponent αc.
By comparing genome-wide domain-counts nf for each
Pfam family f across 93 pairs of closely-related species we

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/51

have estimated the rates at which domain additions and
deletions occur across GO categories and across different
evolutionary lineages. The results of this analysis support
the predictions made by the evolutionary null model.
First, we have shown that, for most categories c, the relative rate rc/r of domain additions and deletions is proportional to the fraction of domains nc/n already occurring in
the genome.
Second, we estimated the relative rates rci / r i of domain
additions and deletions independently for different evolutionary lineages i and used these to estimate lineagei
dependent evolutionary potentials r c . We found that,
i
whereas the evolutionary potentials r c clearly vary

between categories c, the data support the null model's
i
prediction that for a given category c the potentials r c are

the same across all evolutionary lineages i. Finally, by
combining data from all lineages we estimated average
evolutionary potentials ρc and found that, as predicted by
the model, there is a good correlation between these evolutionary potentials and the scaling law exponents αc.
Importantly, this result establishes that there is a direct
relation between the scaling of domain-counts with
genome size and the rates with which domains are added
and removed during short evolutionary time intervals.
This reinforces our proposal that the evolutionary potentials ρc are fundamental constants of the evolutionary
process.
An interesting question is if our simple null model can
also explain the observed power-law distribution [7-9] of
genome-family sizes in each genome. In previous work [7]
one of us has suggested that the simplest explanation for
the power-law distribution of gene family sizes is a multiplicative noise process. Although we will defer a detailed
analysis of the gene-family size distributions implied by
our null model to future work, it is clear that the basic
ingredients for such a multiplicative noise process are
already present. Since the model only constrains the relative rates of domains in different functional categories, the
overall rate of genome growth/shrinkage can fluctuate
randomly, and the rates of different families within a
functional category can also fluctuate around a common
mean. It is interesting to note that our null model implies
that categories with large exponents, such as transcription
factors, should show larger fluctuations in gene family
sizes than categories with small exponents. Since the categories with large exponents are more abundant in larger
genomes this in turn implies that the exponent of the
gene-family size distribution should increase (i.e. be less

Page 11 of 17

Biology Direct 2008, 3:51

negative) for larger genomes. This is indeed what is
observed [7].
If, as recent work suggests, horizontal transfer is an important force in shaping the gene-content of genomes, then
our results put strong constraints on the rates rc at which
horizontal transfers of domains of different functional
categories c can occur. In particular, we find that the rate
at which domains of category c are horizontally transfered
into a genome must be proportional to the number of
domains nc already existing in the receiving genome. An
important avenue for future research is to clarify the
underlying mechanism that is responsible for this surprising fact.
As our results have made plausible that the evolutionary
potentials ρc (and the corresponding scaling exponents
αc) are fundamental constants of the evolutionary process
that apply across all time and all evolutionary lineages,
the major challenge is now to elucidate what determines
these numbers. In this respect it is important to note that
the functional categories c that we consider are taken
directly from the human-defined Gene Ontology hierarchy and are thus rather subjective. A first challenge for
future work is therefore to identify a procedure that
divides domain families into functional groups in a more
objective manner. Although difficult with the current
amount of available data, one possible approach is to estimate evolutionary potentials ρf for individual domain
families and to investigate if these fall into a small
number of natural classes. That is, it is conceivable that on
some more fundamental level there are only a small
number of distinct exponents, for example α = 0, α = 1,
and α = 2, and that the observed scaling laws with more
complex exponents are different mixtures of these more
fundamental scaling laws. Finally, we believe that the
exponents αc reflect fundamental design principles of bacterial life, maybe similar to the way geometry and architectural design principles demand that the number of
windows in a building scales as the 2/3 power of the
building's volume. Seen from this point of view the exponents αc encode crucial information about the basic
design that is shared by all bacterial life.

Methods
Domain counts
We obtained all 630 currently available bacterial genomes
from the NCBI database [31]. To count the number of
occurrences of each Pfam domain in each fully sequenced
bacterial genome we ran HMMer [32] using all Pfam models on all proteins encoded in each genome, as annotated
in the NCBI reference file. We thus assume that there are
no significant fluctuations in the quality of gene prediction across the genomes. A hit was considered a valid
domain if its score was equal or bigger than the so-called

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/51

gathering score of the model provided by the Pfam web
site, and it did not overlap with any other hit of lower Evalue. There were 4,732 Pfam domain families with at
least one occurrence across the 630 bacterial genomes. To
count the number of domain occurrences per functional
category we used a mapping from Pfam domains to Gene
Ontolology terms [15] which is available at http://
www.geneontology.org/. If a domain-family f maps to category c it will be associated with c and all parent categories
of c in the Gene Ontology hierarchy.
Bayesian fitting of exponents
We used a Bayesian model to fit a power-law of the form

n c = e b c n a c for each category c. We discard all genomes
with zero counts, i.e. nc(g) = 0, for each category c and logtransform the remaining domain-counts, i.e. (xg, yg) =
(log[nc(g)], log[n(g)]). We assume that the pairs (xg, yg)
derive from a line yg = αxg + β plus noise of unknown size
in both x- and y-direction. In addition we assume a rotationally invariant prior for the slope α. Under these
assumptions the posterior probability density for the
slope α given the data D is given by

P(a | D)da ∝

(a 2 +1)(G − 3) / 2
da ,
(s yy +s xxa 2 − 2as xy )(G −1) / 2
(20)

where G is the number of genomes, σxx is the variance of x
values, σyy the variance of y values, and σxy the covariance
of x and y values. Note that the optimal line in this procedure corresponds roughly, i.e. up to the effects of the rotationally-invariant prior, to the line that minimizes the
sum of the squared orthogonal distances of the data
points to the line. The latter also corresponds to the first
principal component of the data.
We selected all GO categories that have nonzero count in
at least 95% of the genomes (600 out of 630), where the
fraction of the variance explained by the fit is at least
0.9375 (this corresponds to the average distance to the
data-points from the fitted line being 0.25 or less of the
average distance of the data-points to the center of mass of
the scatter), and where the average number of domains
(averaged over all genomes) is at least 5. This led to 156
categories listed in Additional file 1.
To estimate the exponents γc we make use of the additional information that the noise in the fraction fc is
almost certainly much smaller than the noise in dnc/dn.
Therefore, to estimate γc we use a model in which all noise
is assumed to occur in the vertical component, i.e. as is

Extracting closely-related pairs of bacteria
We extracted the phylogenetic tree of bacteria from the
tree of life that was produced by Ciccarelli et al. [16] based
on the concatenated protein sequences of 31 protein families. As shown previously [33], even strains that are so
close that they traditionally would be considered the same
species, i.e. more than 94% nucleotide identity between
orthologous genes, can have substantial differences in
their gene content. In selecting 'close' pairs of organisms
we want, on the one hand, to be able to estimate relative
rates, for which we need a large enough number of
domain additions and deletions to have taken place. On
the other hand, the further apart the organisms, the harder
it is to accurately estimate the total number of addition
and deletion events that have taken place (see below). We
decided to select all pairs of species for which the average
identity at the amino acid level of orthologous proteins
was at least 0.75, i.e. distance less than 0.25. With this definition one of the most distant pairs considered was
Escherichia coli and Vibrio Cholerae. To avoid redundancy
and pairs with too few events, we clustered all genomes
whose distances were 0.01 or less and took a single representative genome from each cluster. With these cutoffs we
obtained 93 pairs of bacterial genomes which are listed in
Additional file 1.
Estimating domain-count changes Δnc

We estimate the number of domain-count changes Δn and
Δnc by comparing domain counts for each Pfam family
separately. Let n1 and n 2 denote the number of occurf

rences of domains from family f in the first and second
genome of the pair. We will assume that, during the time
from the common ancestor of the two genomes, the rates
at which domains were added and deleted for each family
f is an unknown constant. In principle there are 4

and

We denote by af the number of additions in genome 1 plus
deletions in genome 2, and by df the number of additions
in genome 2 plus deletions in genome 1. Since the rates of
additions and deletions are assumed constant during the
time interval since the common ancestor of the two
genomes, both af and df are Poisson distributed

We originally performed this procedure including all
Pfam domains. However, doing this we found that the
number of extra moves ef estimated for categories associated with transposons and bacteriophages was many
times larger than for all other families. This is of course to
be expected as both transposons and phages actively multiply their domains. However, in equations (33) and (34)
all domain families are treated equally, and therefore the
high rates of additions and deletions for transposon and
phage related categories significantly increase the estimated total rates for all families. Therefore, recognizing
that the mechanisms of domain additions in transposon
and phage related families are different from all other
domain families, we excluded those Pfams associated
with transposons and bacteriophages. In particular, we
excluded all 22 Pfam families that map to the GO categories transposition (GO:0032196) or viral reproduction
(GO:0016032).

Reviewers' comments
Eugene V. Koonin
This is an important and welcome development of Van
Nimwegen's 2003 classic on the scaling laws for different
functional categories of genes in prokaryotic genomes.
That classic study established that different functional
classes of genes all scale according to power laws but with
different, function-specific exponents that are (at least,
approximately) the same in all prokaryotic lineages and,
supposedly, the same throughout the course of prokaryotic evolution. This paper underpins the scaling laws with
the (apparently) simplest conceivable evolutionary
model. Under this model, the dynamics of protein
domains in each functional category depends on just two
variables, the number (fraction) of domains of the given
category that are already present in the genome and the
intrinsic evolutionary potential of the category. It is
shown that the observations on the actual counts of
domains in genomes are well explained if the evolutionary potentials are category-specific but invariant across
bacterial lineages. All of the above had to be done in order
to obtain a concrete evolutionary mechanism yielding the
observed scaling laws but the above results are not at all
unexpected. As I see it, the interesting things start coming
up when one starts considering mechanism of domain
gain in specific terms. For the model to work it is necessary
that the rate at which horizontally transferred genes are
acquired by a prokaryotes is proportional to the number
of domains of the given category that are already present
in the genome. Why that would be the case remains
unclear. I believe the possibility that horizontal gene
transfer is negligible compared to duplication as the
source of new genes (domains) can be dismissed with
confidence. In all, likelihood, in prokaryotes, horizontal
gene transfer is actually a more important source of new
genes than duplication. It is hard to think of a way for the
domain content in the recipient organism could directly
affect the rate of horizontal transfer. So the explanation
should be indirect, that is, should include a connection
between the domain composition of the donor genome
with that of the recipient. Molina and Van Nimwegen

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/51

consider three possibilities, and to me, the one that horizontal gene transfer predominantly occurs between
genomes with similar AT-content (horizontally transferred genes coming from organisms with substantially
different AT-content being rapidly destroyed or silenced)
is highly attractive considering the strong correlation
between AT-content and genome size. These hypotheses
are testable by comparative-genomic methods although
the analysis will not be easy. Of course, in the face of the
rather counter-intuitive finding that the rate of horizontal
gene transfer should depend on the fraction of domains of
the given category already present, one has to consider the
possibility that the proposed evolutionary model is too
simple to be true. As far as I can see, more specifically, that
would imply that the evolutionary potentials are not
time-invariant and/or lineage-independent. The results of
the present paper do not seem to point in this direction
but I suspect that this is not the last word on the subject,
more detailed analyses are necessary. On the whole, this is
an enormously interesting subject, and the present paper
is a useful stepping stone toward understanding the scaling laws. I am particularly intrigued by the final proposition that there could be only three fundamental
exponents, the intermediate values currently observed
depending on mixing of genes from the three classes in
different proportions. Philosophically, this seems to
smack of essentialism but... should there be a mechanistic
explanation(s) of the 0, 1, and 2 scaling (and I can think
of some), this would be a real step ahead in our understanding of how genomes evolve.

The manuscript by Molina and van Nimwegen is the culmination of an observation that was originally made by
Erik van Nimwegen and on which there has been follow
op from several corners: that the variation in the number
of proteins in a specific functional class across species
scales as a power-law with the total number of proteins
encoded in the species, and that the exponent of that
power-law varies between the various classes.
Molina and van Nimwegen analyse their model further to
show that the number of additions and losses within each
category is proportional to the number of genes of that
category already in the genome. They show that this prediction is borne out by comparing the number of genes in
closely related genomes. Questions: In work of this referee
and van Nimwegen we showed that the frequency distribution of gene family sizes in complete genomes follows
a power-law, and we argued that this was only possible
under a model in which the variations in the number of
genes per gene family was proportional to the gene family
size. Do I understand correctly that the model and observations in the Molina and van Nimwegen manuscript are

consistent with this model, and more importantly, that
these two observations about gene family size distributions 1) the size distribution of one family over genomes
and 2) the size distribution of all families within one
genome, can now be explained by one single model?

(domains) in a given functional category. This statement
is in principle separate and independent from the scaling
law itself since it counts the SUM of the rates of domain
additions and deletions and not the DIFFERENCE
between them.

The authors argue for domains as the evolutionary unit.
This may well be, but such a lower resolution does run the
risk of mixing functional categories for domains that function in multiple categories. How many domains did map
to multiple categories? And how did that affect the results?

Unfortunately, when this quantity (Δnc proportional to
[rate of additions+rate of deletions]c) is first introduced
on page 7, readers could easily confuse it with just the net
change in nc (denoted dnc and proportional to [rate of
additions-rate of deletions]c). As a result they would miss
one of the central points of the manuscript. I recommend
that authors spend some extra time upfront explaining the
differences between Δnc and dnc and emphasizing that, a
priory, these two quantities are not at all close to each
other. To quantify this difference authors might quote the
average value of – [rate of additions-rate of deletions]c–/
[rate of additions+rate of deletions]c for their 93 pairs of
genomes.

With respect to Horizontal gene transfer the authors do
not analyze this process per se, but rather argue that if it is
frequent it should also be proportional to gene family
size. I do not want to get into a whole HGT debate here,
but, although over the complete history of life, along all
evolutionary branches, few gene families appear to escape
HGT, or at least escape evidence for HGT, compared to
processes like gene duplication and gene loss, the quantitative contribution from any generation to the next
appears to be small (Snel Bork and Huynen Genome Res
2002). There are other references (BG Mirkin, TI Fenner,
MY Galperin, EV Koonin 2004) that do give higher estimates however. In any case it would be worthwhile to
mention that relative to gene duplication and gene loss
the amount of HGT that actually happens is not necessarily as large as is sometimes implicitly suggested.
With respect to the HGT mainly occurring between closely
related species: there is evidence for that (e.g. by conjugation).
With respect to the closely related genomes: can the
authors check whether the protein prediction in a pair of
genomes was done with the same programs? or did they
run the HMMs directly against the DNA? This is a bit nitpicking I know, but comparisons of closely related species
have been confounded by inconsistent genome annotations in the past.

The manuscript presents an interesting study of evolutionary implications of previously reported scaling laws in the
functional content of bacterial genomes. While it does not
answer the ultimate question of why this scaling exists in
the first place, it methodically explores all its logical consequences reflected in genomes' evolutionary history.
An important result of this study is that the overall rate of
gene (or domain as used in this manuscript) additions
AND deletions scales linearly with the number of genes

My other comment concerns the proposed "superuniversality" of evolutionary potentials (ρc) of a individual functional categories. In general this study indicates that ρc
remains nearly the same for all species and at all timescales of evolution. I have previously observed (S. Maslov,
unpublished) that in a group of VERY CLOSELY related
genomes (28 fully sequences E. coli and Salmonella
strains) the number of transcription factors violates the N2
scaling in spite of a considerable range of genome sizes
(from 4300 to 5800 genes). The best fit to the scaling
exponent gives 0.3 instead of 2. This might indicate that
evolutionary dynamics might in fact be rather different on
very short timescale. This does not contradict the results of
this study since (as explained in the Methods) authors
have grouped together all very closely related species (AA
substitution rate below 1%). However, I believe this
observation deserves future scrutiny since it may shed an
additional light on elementary evolutionary steps shaping
functional contents of bacterial genomes.
Finally, I would like to offer another possibility of how the
results of this study could be reconciled with the evidence
of widespread Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) among
bacteria (see section 2.9). One way to explain the linear
correlation between the rate of fixed horizontal gene
transfers and the number of genes in host's genome, is to
assume that a SUCCESSFUL group of HGT-acquired genes
needs to be functionally integrated with the rest of the
genome. An example would be a HGT-transferred metabolic pathway that in order to contribute to the biomass
production needs to be connected with the rest of the metabolic network of its host. Genomes with larger number
of genes n have more places where a HGT-transferred

pathway could be successfully connected and hence
would be characterized by a proportionally larger ΔnHGT .
In fact, my collaborators and I (S. Maslov, S. Krishna, K.
Sneppen (2008) under review) have recently proposed a
model of such pathway-by-pathway evolution to explain
the quadratic scaling of the number of transcription factors with genome size.
