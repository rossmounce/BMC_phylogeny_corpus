Abstract
Background: The ever-increasing number of sequenced and annotated genomes has made
management of their annotations a significant undertaking, especially for large eukaryotic genomes
containing many thousands of genes. Typically, changes in gene and transcript numbers are used to
summarize changes from release to release, but these measures say nothing about changes to
individual annotations, nor do they provide any means to identify annotations in need of manual
review.
Results: In response, we have developed a suite of quantitative measures to better characterize
changes to a genome's annotations between releases, and to prioritize problematic annotations for
manual review. We have applied these measures to the annotations of five eukaryotic genomes
over multiple releases – H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, and C. elegans.
Conclusion: Our results provide the first detailed, historical overview of how these genomes'
annotations have changed over the years, and demonstrate the usefulness of these measures for
genome annotation management.

Background
The number of sequenced and annotated genomes is rapidly increasing. There are currently 925 published
genomes and 3185 genome sequencing projects underway [1]. Of those underway, over 900 are eukaryotic,
genomes whose large size and intron-containing genes
complicate annotation. Even assuming as few as 10,000
genes/genome, these new eukaryotic genomes alone will
add more than nine million annotations to GenBank.
Tools to manage and analyze these gene annotations are
badly needed. Consider too that next-generation sequencing technologies will soon make it possible for individual
labs to sequence and annotate genomes, thus the number

of gene annotations could well exceed one billion in a few
years time.
Gene annotations are not static entities, and how to best
mange them is a complex and challenging problem. Gene
annotations must be tracked from release to release, and
problematic annotations identified, reviewed and modified. By nature this is a comparative process. Standardization of formats and database schemas has helped matters
greatly. The Sequence Ontology [2] and GMOD projects
[3], for example, provide tools and standards that promote database interoperability. This in turn has made
possible common formats for data exchange such as

CHADO XML [4] and gff3 [5]. The result has been an everproliferating number of groups annotating and redistributing their own annotations, independent of the annotation pipelines used by GenBank. Examples include not
only model organism databases such as C. elegans, and D.
melanogaster but also emerging model organisms such as
the planarian S. mediterranea [6]. The growing numbers of
annotation providers – and users – is creating a pressing
need for tools and techniques for gene annotation management and analysis.
Today, most annotation management and comparison at
the whole-genome scale is restricted to analyses of basic
traits – for example differences between releases are usually evaluated in terms of gene and transcript numbers [7].
Though indisputably useful, these simple statistics only
tell part of the story. Comparisons of different genomes'
annotations also suffer from a paucity of measures, with
most studies restricted to analyses of protein alignments
[8-10]. Here too, new measures of comparison are
needed, measures that move beyond the amino acid
sequences and take into account other aspects of the
annotations such as similarities in intron-exon structures
and patterns of alternative splicing.
Some previous work has been done in this area. The
Sequence Ontology project [2], for example, has created a
categorization system for alternative splicing that can
identify problematic annotations for later manual review.
The DEBD [11] and ASTRA [12] projects have also proposed genome-wide categorizations of alternative splicing
using graph-based approaches. In principle these classification systems could be used for whole-genome annotation management, but to our knowledge they have not yet
been applied for this purpose. Furthermore, useful as
qualitative classification systems are, quantitative metrics
are also needed – measures akin to the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy metrics used by the gene-prediction
community to evaluate gene-finder performance [13].
These measures have seen wide use [14-16]. However,
they also have recognized shortcomings. Indeed, the
recent eGASP contest concluded with a call for new performance measures for alternative splicing and UTR prediction [16]. Moreover, these measures are designed for
evaluating gene-prediction algorithms. The problems
faced in annotation management are similar in spirit, but
distinct enough to require different measures and software. In response to these issues, we have formulated a set
of metrics for annotation comparison.
We introduce two new measures to evaluate changes to
annotations across releases: Annotation Turnover, and
Annotation Edit Distance. Annotation Turnover tracks the
addition and deletion of gene annotations from release to
release. We show that tracking annotations in this manner

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/67

supplements traditional gene and transcript counts,
allowing the detection of 'resurrection events' – cases
where an annotation is created in one release, later
deleted, and then after a lapse of one or more releases a
new annotation is created at the old genomic location,
with no reference to the previous annotation.
We use a second, complementary, measure, called Annotation Edit Distance (AED) to quantify the changes to
individual annotations from release to release. AED is
similar to performance measures employed by the geneprediction community, but takes into account aspects of
annotations not well addressed by conventional sensitivity/specificity measures [13] such as alternative splicing.
AED complements Annotation Turnover and gene and
transcript numbers in that it measures structural changes
to an annotation. Two releases can differ dramatically
from one another, with every annotation's intron-exon
structure having been revised, yet still have identical gene
and transcript numbers and no Annotation Turnover;
AED provides a means to distinguish between a new
release with no changes, and one wherein the intron-exon
coordinates alone have been altered. Moreover, it provides a means to quantify the extent of these changes.
We also introduce a new measure for quantifying the complexity of alternative splicing, which we call Splice Complexity. Those in the field of gene annotation often speak
of one gene as having a more complex pattern of alternative spicing than another. For example, a gene with 20
transcripts, each with different combinations of exons, is
said to be more complex than a gene producing two transcripts that differ from one another by only a few nucleotides at their 5' ends. Splice Complexity provides a
means to quantify transcriptional complexity; moreover,
because it is independent of sequence homology, Splice
Complexity can be used to compare any alternatively
spliced gene to any other. This makes possible novel, global comparisons of alternate splicing across genomes. We
have used Splice Complexity in conjunction with a classification scheme for alternatively spliced genes developed
by the Sequence Ontology project [2] in order to obtain a
global perspective on alternative splicing in different
genomes. These novel analyses suggest that the complexity and mode of alternative splicing varies considerably
amongst the different genomes in our collection.
In total we have analyzed over 500,000 annotations in
this study. To our knowledge this is the largest meta-analysis of gene annotations ever undertaken. Our results
reveal both global differences among the annotations of
different genomes and unexpected similarities – demonstrating the utility of these new measures for wholegenome annotation management and for comparative
genomics studies.

Results
Our analyses fall into two classes – intra-genome comparisons of annotations that track and summarize genomewide changes in annotations from release to release, and
inter-genome comparisons that compare and contrast the
annotations of different genomes to one another. We
chose five annotated genomes for these analyses: Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles
gambiae, and Caenorhabditis elegans. For D. melanogaster
and C. elegans we used gff3 [5] releases from FlyBase [17]
and WormBase [18] respectively. For H. sapiens, Mus. musculus and A. gambiae we used GenBank releases [19]. We
also took practical issues into account when choosing
which releases to analyze, such as completeness, and usability. The early gff3 releases of FlyBase and WormBase,
for example, were alpha releases designed to troubleshoot
the release process; in some cases this precluded effective
analyses of some aspects of their contents. In total we analyzed six human GenBank releases (33–36.2), five M. musculus GenBank releases (30–36.1), four D. melanogaster
FlyBase releases (3.2.2-5.1), and five C. elegans WormBase
releases (WS100-WS176). We also included an A. gambiae
release (08/2007) from GenBank in some of our analyses.
See Additional File 1 for details of the dataset.
Annotation Edit Distance
We used a measure we term Annotation Edit Distance
(AED) to quantify the amount of change to individual
annotations between releases (see Methods for details;
and Figure 1 for examples). In order to measure rates of
annotation revision independently of changes to the
underlying assembly, we excluded from these calculations
any annotation version-pair with changes to the underly-

ing genomic sequence (see Methods, section entitled
Assembly-induced changes). Figure 2 summarizes the
total amount of annotation revision between releases for
four of the genomes in our dataset. D. melanogaster is by
far the most stable genome. Though small numbers of
new gene annotations have been added incrementally
since release 3.2 (10/2004), the vast majority of its annotations have remained unchanged at the level of their transcript coordinates (Figure 2). Overall, 94% the genes in
the current release (5.1) have remained unaltered since
2004, and only 0.3% have been altered more than once
(TABLES 1 &2). The C. elegans genome, by comparison
has undergone significant revision with each release.
Although gene and transcript numbers have changed by
less than 3% since 2003 (WS100) (Additional File 1),
58% of annotations in the current release have been modified since 2003, 32% more than once (TABLES 1 &2). It
is also worth noting that although far fewer D. melanogaster annotations than C. elegans annotations were
revised from release to release, the changes to D. melanogaster annotations tended to be of greater in magnitude
(TABLE 3); the average AED/modified transcript for D.
melanogaster was 0.092 compared to 0.058 for C. elegans.
H. sapiens and M. musculus annotations are also undergoing considerable revision from release to release. 55%
of current human annotations (release 36.2) have been
modified at least once since 2003, with an average AED/
revised transcript of 0.086. Substantial numbers of mouse
annotations have also undergone revision. 29% of annotations in the release 36.1 (current at time of writing) have
been modified at least once since their creation. Finally as
Figure 2 makes clear, mouse release 36.1 is somewhat

corresponding Annotation Edit Distance (AED) and Splice Complexity (SC) values. The left column shows the AED values
between the three releases. The right column, SC values for each version. In release 1, the annotation consists of a single transcript with three exons. In release 2, 3' UTR has been added, increasing the AED, but leaving SC unchanged. In release 3, a second, alternatively-spliced transcript has been added, increasing AED and SC. The black portions of each transcript denote its
translated portion. See Methods section for the details of the calculation.

atypical in that no transcript coordinates were altered,
though the CDS coordinates of 51 transcripts were
changed. In addition, release 36.1 saw the deletion of 487
genes and 501 transcripts (Additional File 1).
These results show how AED naturally supplements gene
and transcript numbers. Consideration of gene and transcript numbers alone, for example, would lead one to
believe that the C. elegans and D. melanogaster annotations
are both relatively static, when in fact the C. elegans annotations are evolving rapidly compared to those of D. melanogaster. Considering AED in conjunction with gene and
transcript counts also makes it clear that the dynamics of
the two invertebrate annotation sets differ markedly from
the vertebrate ones, which are characterized by large fluctuations in both gene and transcript numbers – and AED.
Annotation Turnover
We also measured annotation turnover – the addition and
deletion of gene annotations from release to release (see
Methods for details). Figure 3 summarizes annotation
turnover from two perspectives: the red line shows the
fraction of annotated genes in the current release that were
present in prior releases; the blue line, the fraction of
annotations in the first release still present in subsequent

releases. For example, 92% of the annotations in the latest
D. melanogaster release were present in release 3.2.2 (10/
2004); likewise 99% of annotations present in release 3.2
still exist. These facts together with the low annotation
edit distances characteristic of this genome show that
since the omnibus release 3 [7,20,21], changes have
largely been due to the addition of modest numbers of
new genes. The situation is similar for the C. elegans
genome. It's annotations have undergone a low and balanced rate of annotation turnover: 95% of the WS100
(05/2003) annotations still remained in one form or
another as of the WS176 release (06/2007), and 91% of
the current annotations were present as long ago as
WS100 (05/2003) (Figure 3).
The H. sapiens and M. musculus genomes have undergone
higher rates of annotation turnover than either of the two
invertebrate genomes (Figure 3). Less than 60% of annotations present in human release 33 and mouse release 30
were still in existence by the next release, e.g. human
release 34.1 and mouse release 32.1. Most of the turnover
was due to annotation deletion: between April and October 2003, human gene counts fell by 28% (Additional File
1), and between February and October 2003 mouse gene
numbers fell 20%. Since this early clean up, mouse and
human gene numbers have risen by 10%. Interestingly,
about 1 in 3 (30%) of the new mouse genes are resurrections of release 30 annotations deleted from release 32;
this is the underlying cause of the upward trend in blue
line since release 32.1 in Figure 3.
We also measured Annotation turnover for the human
and mouse Refseq NM and NR annotations [22]. These
are shown as dotted lines in the human and mouse panels
in Figure 3. Turnover rates for these curated annotations
are much lower. For both genomes, over 95% of Refseq
NM and NRs present in the first releases in our collection
(2003) were still present in last (2006). Likewise, more
than 90% of 2006 human and mouse Refseq NM and NRs
were present as long ago as 2003. Thus, the NMs and NRs
paint a very different picture of annotation turnover, one
that closely resembles the C. elegans and D. melanogaster
turnover data (Figure 3), making it clear that most of the
turnover in human and mouse genomes has been due to

addition and deletion of automatically generated annotations for which there is little experimental support.
Alternative splicing
Alternatively spliced genes pose special challenges for
annotation efforts. Because they are not predicted by most
gene finders, and predicted with poor accuracy by those
that do [23], alternatively-spliced transcripts are generally
the product of manual annotation efforts. As such, they
provide an important indication of the extent and completeness of active curation efforts. 15% of human genes
(release 36.2), 7% of mouse (release 36.1), 24% of D. melanogaster, 9% of mosquito, and 19% of C. elegans genes
have more than one annotated transcript (Additional File
1).

There has been a strong trend towards ever increasing
numbers of alternatively spliced annotations from release
to release for every genome in our collection (Additional
File 1). Although this trend illustrates the growing focus
on the annotation of alternatively spliced genes, it says
nothing about how the contents of alternatively spliced
annotations have evolved from release to release and how
they differ between genomes. We have undertaken two
analyses to address these points. First, we classified alternatively spliced annotations using a scheme developed by
the Sequence Ontology. We also used a measure we term
Splice Complexity (see Methods) to quantify the complexity of each alternatively spliced annotation.
SO-based classifications
We used a classification system developed by the
Sequence Ontology group [2] to characterize the alternatively spliced annotations in our collection of annotated
genomes; this is the first application of this classification
system to multiple genomes and releases. These data are
summarized in Figure 4B. The Sequence Ontology's classification system categorizes an alternatively spliced gene
into one of seven modes based upon shared and unique
exons among its transcripts [2] (see Figure 4A for details).
Some classes of alternative splicing are especially indicative of errors in annotation. Class N:0:0 genes, for example, have multiple transcripts that share no exon sequence
in common. Thus N:0:0 annotations are likely to be multiple genes, incorrectly merged into a single annotation.
When considering N:0:0 annotations it is important to
understand that even though when viewed in a genome
browser these appear to be separate genes, they are –
within the host database – a single gene. Thus queries to
the database to determine gene numbers, the number of
alternatively spliced transcripts, etc are distorted by these
mis-annotations. Also suspect are 0:N:0 genes. None of
these genes' transcripts share any exon coordinates precisely in common; hence, each transcript encodes a
slightly different peptide. Though a formal possibility, Eilbeck et al [2] suggest that 0:N:0 annotations should be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/67

subjected to manual review in order to make sure that
their unusual patterns of alternative splicing are confirmed by EST evidence.
Previous work on the D. melanogaster genome [2] has
shown that the vast majority of its alternatively spliced
genes belong to the 0:0:N class. We find that this trend
also holds true for every genome in our collection (Figure
4B). However, the M. musculus and A. gambiae genomes
are enriched for problematic annotations: 33% of A. gambiae and 15% of M. musculus alternatively spliced genes,
for example, consist of transcripts lacking any exon borders in common (c.f. 0:N:0 class in Figure 4A Error! Reference source not found.). The high percentage of such
genes in the Mus and Anopheles genomes indicates that
these annotations are in need of review, as many of them
may be mis-annotated. Conventional release statistics
such as gene and transcript numbers or percentages of altspliced genes can never reveal trends such as these. Thus,
these results highlight the usefulness of the SO classification scheme for annotation management.
Splice complexity
To further characterize alternatively spliced genes, we
developed a new measure that we term Splice Complexity.
Splice Complexity provides a means to quantify (rather
than classify) the complexity of a genome's alternatively
spliced annotations; it thus naturally complements existing classification systems such as the Sequence Ontology's
[2] and graph-based splicing schemes [11,12]. The Methods Section describes in detail how Splice Complexity is
calculated.

The top panel of Figure 5 shows the distribution of Splice
Complexities for the current release of each genome in our
study. In order to better characterize these distributions,
we also broke each genome's alternatively spliced annotations into 4 bins based upon their Splice Complexities
and then categorized their contents using the SO classification system (Figure 5, bottom panel). Regardless of
genome, annotations with low splice complexities per
transcript-pair tend to fall disproportionately into the
0:0:N class, and as Splice Complexity increases there is a
concomitant enrichment for problematic annotations
that belong to the N:0:0, and 0:N:0 classes. For, example,
overall 8% of genes with Splice Complexities between
0.00 and 0.25 fall into the 0:N:0 class, whereas 31% of
genes with Splice Complexities greater than 0.75 fall into
the 0:N:0 class. Thus, alternatively spliced genes with high
Splice Complexities tend to fall into classes that should be
prioritized for manual review according to the Sequence
Ontology classification system [2].
Interestingly, the H. sapiens, D. melanogaster and C. elegans
alternatively spliced annotations all have very similar distributions of Splice Complexity, whereas the M. musculus

Figure 4 Ontology-based classification of alternative spliced annotations in five annotated genomes
Sequence
Sequence Ontology-based classification of alternative spliced annotations in five annotated genomes. The
Sequence Ontology schema classifies alternatively-transcribed and alternatively-spliced genes into seven different classes; this is
done by first grouping their transcript-pairs into three classes: (1) pairs of transcripts that share no sequence in common, (2)
transcript-pairs with sequence in common, but which share no exon-boundaries precisely in common, and (3) transcript-pairs
that share one or more exons in common. This process results in seven classes of gene; N:0:0 genes for example encode only
transcripts that do not overlap. Panel A provides a key for each of the seven classes, consisting of an alternatively spliced gene
exhibiting a representative pattern of alternative splicing and its associated classification, e.g. CLASS N:0:0 (Top left). Panel B
shows the percentage of genes in each genome falling into each class.

shows the frequency distribution of Splice Complexities per transcript-pair. The x-axis: Splice Complexity; the y-axis: relative

pictorial summary of the typical splicing patterns associated with these SO classes). The numbers associated with each pie
chart represent the total number of annotations in that bin. Pie charts shown in the top-half of the lower panel give the combined breakdown for H. sapiens, D. melanogaster and C. elegans annotations; the bottom-half shows data for the combined M.
musculus and A. gambiae annotations.

and A. gambiae genomes are biased towards higher frequencies of splice- complex annotations (Figure 5, upper
panel). The SO based classifications shown in the lower
panel of Figure 5 suggest an explanation for these differences. Relative to the other three genomes, M. musculus

and A. gambiae annotations tend to have higher Splice
Complexities because they contain more annotations that
belong to problematic SO classes. Moreover, the enrichment of these problematic classes grows steadily more
pronounced as their Splice Complexity increases (Figure

5, lower panel). These results once again illustrate the utility of our measures for annotation management and
meta-analysis and how they complement the SO schema
– providing a global overview of an entire genome's altspliced genes and allowing the direct comparisons
between genomes to reveal an excess of problematic –
likely incorrect – annotations in mouse and mosquito
genomes that should be subjected to manual review.
Table 4 lists the most Splice Complex annotations from
each genome. As might be expected DSCAM [24] has the
highest Splice Complexity of any annotation in the D.
melanogaster genome. This gene is predicted to produce
over 32,000 different transcripts, 59 of which are annotated to date. Note however, that even though the Splice
complexity of the DSCAM gene is high (149), its average
Splice Complexity per transcript pair (0.084) is the lowest
of any of the genes in TABLE 4. This indicates that even
though DSCAM has many annotated transcripts, on average they are quite similar to one another. Note too that the
M. musculus and C. elegans genes both belong to SO classes
indicative of problematic annotations. These results suggest that splice complexity per transcript-pair could be
used to help distinguish likely mis-annotated genes from
correctly annotated genes, which are simply very complex.
Prioritization schemes employing all three measures –
total Splice Complexity, Splice Complexity/transcript-pair
and SO classification – would likely prove most effective,
with genes having high Splice Complexities/transcriptpair and classified into SO class other than 0:0:N heading
the list for manual review. Additional File 2 provides a list
of such genes compiled from the releases included in our
analyses.
Conservation of Alternative Splicing
We also investigated how often alternative splicing was a
trait shared among orthologous loci. EST-based analyses
have shown that alternative splicing tends to be conserved
even over relatively large phylogenetic distances [25]. We
examined to what extent the current crop of annotations
capture this fact. We found that alternatively spliced
orthologous pairs occur more frequently than would be
expected by chance alone. The Human-mouse ODDS

orthologous pairs. The Spearman correlation coefficient

0.36; P < 0.001. It was 0.16; P < 0.001 for melanogastergambiae alternatively-spliced orthologous pairs. TABLE 5
gives human-mouse, and melanogaster-gambiae pairs (as
judged by reciprocal best hits) with the greatest differences in Splice Complexity. These facts suggest that the
current crop of annotations has only begun to capture the
repertory of alternatively spliced transcripts in each
genome. The ability to identify pairs of orthologous genes
with very different Splice Complexities provides a means
to follow up on this hypothesis – further analysis of the
member of the pair with the lower Splice Complexity may
reveal additional transcripts, not yet annotated, or in cases
where there are no missing transcripts, functional differences between the two orthologs.

Discussion
We have used a variety of new approaches to investigate
the annotations of five large eukaryotic genomes, four of
them across multiple releases. Our meta-analyses provide
novel, global perspectives on the contents of more than
500,000 annotations and their evolution over a period of
several years. These analyses have brought to light previously unknown differences and unexpected similarities
between their annotations, and allowed us to tease apart
differences due in annotation practice from underlying
biology. We have also shown how analyses combining
Splice Complexity and the Sequence Ontology's classification system can be used to identify and prioritize likely
mis-annotated genes for manual review.
Our analyses of Annotation Turnover show that the H.
sapiens and M. musculus annotations are characterized by
very high rates of turnover. The major cause of turnover in
both genomes appears to be due to incremental changes
in the NCBI's annotation protocols, especially as regards
pseudogene identification [27]. Since 2003, far fewer
annotations have been deleted from either vertebrate
genome; and gene addition has been the dominant trend,
some of these being resurrected from the earlier releases.
This is especially true for mouse, wherein gene numbers
rose by 17% between releases 34 and 35. Once again the
cause appears to be changing annotation methodologies.

Orthologous genes were identified using reciprocal best hit BLASTP searches.

Between these two releases the NCBI's gene prediction
program, Gnomon, was altered to use a new repeat masking program and to incorporate protein alignments to the
genome. This resulted in an increase in gene models in
Build 35 compared to Build 34. [27]. For both vertebrate
genomes, turnover of Refseq [22] NM and NR annotations has been much lower (Figure 3); these form a stable
core amid a continuous flux of more ephemeral annotations.
The high turnover rates characteristic of the human and
mouse genomes stand in stark contrast to the more static
D. melanogaster and C. elegans genomes. Almost 99% of D.
melanogaster annotations present in the omnibus 3.2
release [7], are still present in some form today. C. elegans
gene numbers are also quite stable, with rates of gene
addition and deletion almost balanced – 90% of annotations present in 2003 were still present in 2007 (WS176)
and vice versa. The stability of gene numbers in both
organisms is certainly not due to neglect. Genome-wide
searches for new protein coding genes followed by PCRverification have been undertaken in both animals
[28,29].
We used Annotation Edit Distance (Figure 2) to measure
active curation independently of annotation turnover.
Whereas the D. melanogaster annotations are undergoing
little revision, the C. elegans, H. sapiens and Mus musculus
annotations have undergone significant revision with
each release. 58% of C elegans annotations and 55% of
human annotations for example, have been altered since
2003; by comparison only 6% of D. melanogaster annotations have been altered during this time. These results
show how Annotation Edit Distance can be used to assess
the intensity of annotation curation efforts among different databases.
Our analyses of alternatively spliced genes indicate that
these are incompletely annotated in every genome in our
collection. Despite the fact that alternate splicing is a trait
frequently shared among orthologous genes [25,30-32],
this trend is poorly captured by the current crop of annotations. For example, estimates based on EST data suggest
that around 50% of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae alter-

native exons are conserved [25]. At time of writing, however, only 6.4% of melanogaster-gambiae orthologous
genes are alternatively spliced in both genomes. Likewise,
only 2.6% of orthologous human-mouse annotations are
alternatively spliced in both genomes, considerably less
than the published estimate of 40% based upon EST analyses [30,31]. We did, however, detect a weak but statistically significant tendency for human-mouse and
melanogaster-gambiae orthologs to both be alternatively
spliced when either member is. There is also a statistically
significant correlation in their Splice Complexities. These
facts suggest that the current crop of annotations have
begun to capture the conserved aspects of alternative
splicing, but that much progress remains possible. Certainly, a rigorous review of alternative splicing patterns
among orthologous genes could do much to improve the
annotation of all four genomes.
Our analyses using the Sequence Ontology classification
system revealed genome specific differences in the frequencies of different modes of alternative splicing. M.
musculus and A. gambiae, for example, are highly enriched
for genes whose transcripts share no exon borders in common. Our Splice Complexity based analyses complement
these findings: Unexpectedly, the human, C. elegans and
D. melanogaster distributions are all very similar to one
another despite the vast evolutionary distances separating
these genomes (Figure 5, top panel). This may indicate
that common selective forces govern the transcriptional
complexity of alternative spliced genes. Inconsistent with
this hypothesis, however, the M. musculus and A. gambiae
Splice Complexity distributions are skewed towards
higher values due to enrichment for genes with unusual
modes of alternative splicing. We believe that annotation
quality, rather than biology is the likely cause of the skew
towards higher Splice Complexities in these two genomes.
If this explanation is correct, the mouse and mosquito distributions should converge upon those of the other three
genomes as their annotations mature. But whatever the
cause – mis-annotation or fundamental differences in
biology – their in-silico identification is the first step
toward review and experimental investigation of these
unusual annotations.

Conclusion
Although the information encoded in genomic DNA provides a foundation for modern medicine, genome
sequences in themselves are not very useful. Their value is
dependant upon identifying and annotating the genes
they contain. Incomplete and incorrect annotations poison every experiment that employs them. In light of these
considerations, accurate and complete genome annotation seems a laudable and achievable goal, especially for
model organisms. Because the datasets are so large and
complex, in silico methods for annotation management
must necessarily play a major role in this process. In
response, we have formulated three new measures for
annotation management – Annotation Turnover, Annotation Edit Distance and Splice Complexity – and used them
to investigate the annotations of five genomes. Our results
show how these measures can be used to better monitor
changes to a genome's annotations from release to release;
to compare the magnitude of curation efforts among different genome databases; and to identify and prioritize
problematic annotations for manual review.

Methods
Tracking annotations from release to release
Reciprocal best hits are commonly used to identify orthologous genes, even over large evolutionary distances
[10,33]. This approach is also effective for tracking annotations from assembly to assembly, as intra-genome differences are meager in comparison to cross-genome
differences. In order to determine the accuracy of this procedure, we used two complementary approaches. First, we
searched the first and last release from each genome
against themselves. We found that on average, 98.7% of
genes were their own reciprocal best hits; this percentage
demonstrates that paralogs, repeats and low complexity
sequence have little impact on the accuracy of the reciprocal best hits procedure. We used a second procedure to
assess the impact of greater release distance on accuracy.
To do so, we identified reciprocal best hits between each
release and its closest two temporal neighbors, and used
these data to populate a graph of reciprocal best hits from
release to release for each genome. We then compared the
correspondence between reciprocal best hits obtained by
traversing this graph from start to end to those obtained
from searching the most current release against the earliest
release. The trace-based approach recovered a subset
(91%) of the reciprocal best hits obtained by the first
approach. For D. melanogaster and C. elegans the percentage was 100% and 98%, respectively. For H. sapiens and
M. musculus it was 85% and 79%. Resurrection of previously deleted genes lowered percentages in the two vertebrate genomes. For these reasons we conclude that simply
blasting releases against one another is the preferred
means of tracking annotations across releases. All searches
were preformed with the following WU-BLAST command:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/67

blastn <db> <query> -filter = seg -cpus = 1 -W = 30 -N = 10 -mformat = 2 -B = 1 E = 1e-6 -gspmax = 5 T = 1000 wink = 30.
Assembly-induced Changes
Changes to the underlying assembly complicate analyses
of annotation change. We therefore sought to segregate
changes to annotations resulting solely from curation,
from those resulting from changes to the underlying
assembly. To do so, we first identified versions of the same
annotation in sequential pairs of releases using a reciprocal best hits approach. We then compared the underlying
genomic sequences (including a flanking region of 500
bp) for each gene version-pair. If there was any change to
the underlying genomic sequence, these annotations were
flagged as altered due to assembly change. We found that
the impact of assembly changes on existing annotations
varied widely from genome to genome and from release
to release (Additional File 3). The D. melanogaster and C.
elegans assemblies were the most static; on average only
0.42% of D. melanogaster and 0.30% of C. elegans genes
experienced changes to their underlying DNA sequences
from release to release. The H. sapiens and M. musculus
assemblies were more labile. On average 3% of H. sapiens
and 18% of M. musculus annotations underwent assembly
induced coordinate changes from release to release. For
both vertebrate genomes the vast majority of these
occurred between early releases. In M. musculus, for example, the underlying genomic sequences of 30% of release
30 (02/2003) annotations had been altered by 32.1 (10/
2003), whereas the percentage fell to 15% between
releases 34.1 (05/2005) and 35.1 (09/2005) and to only
0.05% between releases 35.1 (09/2005) and 36.1 (05/
2006). H. sapiens followed a similar trend (averaging
around 3% release), with the exception of release 35.1,
which had a higher percentage (5%).
Calculating Annotation Edit Distance
Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy [13] are commonly
used to measure gene-finder performance relative to some
standard, usually a reference annotation that is well supported by experimental evidence. Sensitivity (SN) is the
fraction of the reference feature predicted, whereas Specificity (SP) is the fraction of the prediction overlapping the
reference feature. Both measures can be calculated for any
feature class, e.g. transcripts, exons or introns; and the calculations can be preformed at the nucleotide level, or, if
greater stringency is desired, the fraction of the features
predicted exactly [23]. SN and SP are often combined into
a single measure called Accuracy (AC). Several formulations of accuracy are in use (see [13]). Some of these take
true negatives into account; others do not. In practice, it
can be difficult to determine the scope of true negatives
for genome annotations, as these can be considered as
limited to some flanking region around the gene in ques-

Page 11 of 15

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:67

tion, the entire intergenic region or even the rest of the
genome. Including true negatives in the accuracy calculation also complicates inter-genome comparisons. For
example, gene-prediction accuracy will tend to be higher
for those genomes with large introns and intergenic
regions. For these reasons we have used a simple average,
(SN +SP)/2, to measure accuracy.
Although SN, SP and AC are normally thought of as measures of agreement between a prediction and a reference
annotation, there is no inherent requirement for a reference annotation. The measures can also be used to compare two annotations to one another. Reformulating SN
in terms of sets makes this clear (see Figure 6). SN for
example is usually given as SN = tp/(tp + fn), where tp is
number of true positives and fn false negatives. But SN can
also be thought of as the fraction of annotation i overlapping annotation j. Substituting tp and fn for their set-theoretic equivalents (Figure 6), SN = |i∩j|/(|i∩j| + |j\i|),
where |i∩j| is the number of overlapping nucleotides (tp),
and |j\i| the number of nucleotides in j not annotated in
i, or fn. Since, by definition |j| = |i∩j| + |j\i|, SN = |i∩j|/|j|,
or the fraction of j overlapping i. Likewise, SP can be
thought of as the fraction of i overlapping j, and Accuracy
(AC) as the average of these two fractional overlaps – a bidirectional measure of Congruency between two annotations that we denote as C. The incongruence or distance, D,
between annotation versions i and j then becomes D = 1C.
So long as both versions of the annotation contain only a
single annotated transcript, AED, is easily calculated.
Alternative splicing, however, complicates matters somewhat. The problem lies in how best to pair the transcripts
of one version of the annotation with those of another.
Several different procedures can be envisioned; we have
chosen one that will always give the minimal distance.

|j\i|: nucleotides in j, not in i; |i\j|: nucleotides in i, not in j.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/67

The procedure is shown in Figure 7. First, pairwise incongruencies, or 1-C, between each possible pairing of annotation i's transcripts with those of j are calculated. Each
transcript is then paired with its closest partner from the
other annotation. In cases where a transcript has multiple
equidistant partners, one of these is chosen randomly. In
cases where the two annotations have different numbers
of transcripts, two transcripts from one version can share
the same partner in the other annotation. The pairwise
distances are then summed (Figure 7, panel D). The result
is a (minimum) measure of distance between two versions of the gene, which we term Annotation Edit Distance, or AED. This value can also normalized by the
number of transcript-pairs to give the average AED/transcript-pair, a number useful for analyses of alternatively
spliced annotations. AED is a general measure, not
restricted to transcripts. This makes it possible to compute
multiple, feature-specific AEDs for purposes of better
annotation management. For example, changes to UTRs
between releases can be analyzed independently of
changes to other features. Moreover, AED is genome independent; this means that the magnitude of release-torelease revisions can be compared across different
genomes as we have done in Figure 2.
Splice Complexity
Annotators often speak of a gene as having simple or complex pattern of alternative splicing, but to date complexity
has been a term without a precise meaning. In response,
we have developed a quantitative measure of annotation
complexity that we term Splice Complexity. Splice Com-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/67

plexity is closely related to AED, and is calculated as follows (see Figure 8). First the incongruence, 1-C, is
calculated for every pairwise combination of an annotation's transcripts. Next, these values are summed. We term
the result the gene's Splice Complexity. Splice Complexity
can also be normalized by the number of transcript-pairs
to give an average complexity per transcript-pair. Splice
Complexity is thus quite similar to AED, but whereas AED
is used to measure the distance between two versions of the
same annotation, Splice Complexity can be thought of as
an intra-annotation measure of its complexity. Importantly, Splice Complexity provides a measure of annotation complexity that is independent of sequence
similarity. This means that the genome-wide complexity
of alternative splicing in different genomes can be compared to one another as we have done in Figure 5. Though
we have restricted the analyses reported here to transcriptlevel comparisons, Splice Complexity can also be used for
comparisons of orthologous and paralogous genes – and
provides a means to identify pairs of such annotations
that have widely differing complexities (TABLE 5). These
characteristics make it a useful measure for both annotation quality control and comparative genomics.
Annotation Turnover
From release to release annotations are added, deleted,
split and merged. Because gene numbers only tally the
ratio of additions to deletions they give little insight into
the process of annotation turnover. An obvious approach
to investigating annotation turnover would be to follow
gene IDs from release to release, but in practice this
proved problematic for some of the earlier releases.
Instead, we used a reciprocal best-hits approach to investigate the process of annotation turnover, as this provides
a general method not dependent upon ID history data,
which is not always available. For each genome's collection of releases we searched the transcripts from the most
recent release in our collection against the earlier releases
and vice versa. If one or more of a gene's alternative transcripts had a reciprocal best hit to a transcript in an earlier
release, that gene was considered present in that release,
but only so long as all its transcripts' reciprocal best hits
were to the same target gene and vice versa. We used
exactly the same procedure to track annotations in the
other direction as well, i.e. from the first release for each
genome forward through subsequent releases.

between transcripts of an annotation (A) are shown in (B).
Minimum distances between each transcript-pair can be

study for H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and

records tagged as a gene in either the GenBank or GFF3 files for that
organism and release. For the GFF3 files this is limited to protein-coding
genes, as variability in early GFF3 formats precluded the inclusion of noncoding RNA genes. The number in parenthesis is the number of genes used
in our analyses. There are a variety of reasons for the differences between
the raw gene count and the number of genes that we analyzed. In general
if there were annotations to support, or if we could infer, a valid gene
model from the contents of the gff3 or GenBank file, with at least one
transcript and exon then we analyzed the record. GenBank records for
human and mouse annotate some pseudogenes with transcripts (but not
all) and we have included those genes with transcripts in our analyses.
Finally, there are some records for which – due to incomplete or corrupt
annotations – a valid gene model cannot be inferred. We have excluded
them from our analyses. The numbers in the 'Transcripts' column represent a count of records in GenBank files that have a transcript_id tag, and
in fly and worm GFF3 files, records that have a type field with mRNA.
The values in the 'Alt. Spliced Genes' column represent the number of
genes included in our analyses which had more than one transcript associated with them.
