Abstract
Background: Tuberculosis remains a major world-wide health threat which demands the
discovery and characterisation of new drug targets in order to develop future antimycobacterials.
The regeneration of methionine consumed during polyamine biosynthesis is an important pathway
present in many microorganisms. The final step of this pathway, the conversion of
ketomethiobutyrate to methionine, can be performed by aspartate, tyrosine, or branched-chain
amino acid aminotransferases depending on the particular species examined.
Results: The gene encoding for branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Rv has been cloned, expressed, and characterised. The enzyme was found to be a
member of the aminotransferase IIIa subfamily, and closely related to the corresponding
aminotransferase in Bacillus subtilis, but not to that found in B. anthracis or B. cereus. The amino
donor preference for the formation of methionine from ketomethiobutyrate was for isoleucine,
leucine, valine, glutamate, and phenylalanine. The enzyme catalysed branched-chain amino acid and
ketomethiobutyrate transamination with a Km of 1.77 – 7.44 mM and a Vmax of 2.17 – 5.70 µmol/
min/mg protein, and transamination of ketoglutarate with a Km of 5.79 – 6.95 mM and a Vmax of
11.82 – 14.35 µmol/min/mg protein. Aminooxy compounds were examined as potential enzyme
inhibitors, with O-benzylhydroxylamine, O-t-butylhydroxylamine, carboxymethoxylamine, and Oallylhydroxylamine yielding mixed-type inhibition with Ki values of 8.20 – 21.61 µM. These same
compounds were examined as antimycobacterial agents against M. tuberculosis and a lower
biohazard M. marinum model system, and were found to completely prevent cell growth. OAllylhydroxylamine was the most effective growth inhibitor with an MIC of 78 µM against M.
marinum and one of 156 µM against M. tuberculosis.
Conclusion: Methionine formation from ketomethiobutyrate is catalysed by a branched-chain
amino acid aminotransferase in M. tuberculosis. This enzyme can be inhibited by selected aminooxy
compounds, which also have effectiveness in preventing cell growth in culture. These compounds
represent a starting point for the synthesis of branched-chain aminotransferase inhibitors with
higher activity and lower toxicity.

Background
Tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of worldwide mortality and morbidity, infecting an estimated 8
million people annually with approximately 2 million
deaths [1]. The situation regarding the control of tuberculosis has significantly worsened over the last decades, with
the spread of multidrug resistant strains. In the absence of
an effective vaccine for tuberculosis, there is an urgent
need for the development of novel antimycobacterial
agents. The study of mycobacterial biochemistry assists
this development through the identification and characterization of cellular enzymes amenable to therapeutic
inhibition.
Polyamine synthesis and its associated methionine (Met)
regeneration pathway (Figure 1) are known to be potential drug targets in a variety of microorganisms [2-4]. The
synthesis of polyamines is essential during periods of
DNA replication, although the exact physiological role of
these compounds remains unclear [3]. The production of
spermidine from putrescine, or spermine from spermidine, consumes the amino acid Met in a 1:1 stoichiometry
yielding methylthioadenosine (MTA) as a byproduct. As
Met biosynthesis is energetically expensive, and many
organisms lack the ability to synthesize the amino acid, a
unique pathway exists which recycles Met from MTA. To
date, the entire pathway has only been fully characterised
in the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae [511] and the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis [1214] Selected individual enzymes active in the pathway
have been studied in a wide variety of eukaryotic and
prokaryotic organisms [7,15-20]. For Mycobacterium spp.,
only methionine adenosyltransferase has been cloned,
expressed, and fully characterised [21].
The final step in Met regeneration is the transamination of
ketomethiobutyrate (KMTB) by an aminotransferase. The
specific aminotransferase responsible for the reaction has
been identified and characterised in a number of microorganisms, including malaria, African trypanosomes, K.
pneumoniae, B. subtilis, and B. anthracis [7,16,17]. In the
lower eukaryotes Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei brucei, Giardia intestinalis, and Crithidia fasciculata, this
reaction is catalysed by the subfamily Ia enzyme aspartate
aminotransferase [17]. In K. pneumoniae, however, the
reaction was performed by the close homologue tyrosine
aminotransferase, which is also a member of subfamily Ia
[7]. Gram-positive bacteria and archaea appear to lack any
subfamily Ia homologues in their genomes, and B. subtilis,
B. cereus, and B. anthracis were recently found to catalyse
Met regeneration via a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) [16]. This enzyme is a member of
family III, along with D-amino acid aminotransferase
(DAAT), and is unrelated structurally to family I enzymes
[22]. Intriguingly, B. subtilis and B. cereus/B. anthracis uti-

lised BCAT enzymes from separate subfamilies (IIIa vs.
IIIb respectively). As Mycobacterium spp. also appear to
have no subfamily Ia aminotransferase sequences ([16],
and data not shown), it would be expected that M. tuberculosis also catalyses the conversion of KMTB to Met via a
BCAT. In this paper, we report the identification, cloning,
and functional expression of a single BCAT from M. tuberculosis. In addition, this enzyme has been demonstrated to
actively catalyse Met formation and is subject to inhibition by a variety of aminooxy compounds.

Results
Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase in M.
tuberculosis
The complete, published genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv
was found to contain a single gene with a very high
sequence homology to either B. subtilis YbgE or YwaA,
which are both known to be subfamily IIIa BCATs
[16,23]. In contrast, the tuberculosis genome did not contain a homologue to B. subtilis YheM, B. cereus BCAT, or B.
anthracis BCAT, which are all subfamily IIIb aminotransferases [16]. This relationship can be clearly seen in Figure
2A, where selected family III aminotransferases have been
aligned and an unrooted tree constructed. The putative M.
tuberculosis BCAT gene, Rv2210c, has not been previously
cloned, expressed, or characterised. It is interesting to note
that the M. tuberculosis genome contains a single BCAT
homologue and no obvious DAAT homologue.

Examination of complete and incomplete genome
projects for Mycobacterium spp. uncovered a single gene in
M. leprae, M. bovis, M. marinum, M. ulcerans, M. avium, and
M. smegmatis with an extremely high identity to Rv2110c.
Together, with other subfamily IIIa aminotransferases, the
putative mycobacterial sequences were aligned and a
cladogram constructed (Figure 2B). The M. tuberculosis
and M. bovis sequences were identical, as were the M. marinum and M. ulcerans sequences. Aside from M. bovis, all
the mycobacterial BCAT sequences were found to be 85 –
88% identical to the M. tuberculosis sequence. However,
the tuberculosis sequence was 57% identical to the putative BCAT from Streptomyces coelicolor and 45% identical to
B. subtilis YbgE. Figure 2B highlights the fact that the
mycobacterial BCAT sequences are more closely related to
eukaryotic enzymes than to most other bacterial homologues. There was little sequence conservation with
enzymes found in subfamily IIIb, with only 27% identity
to the E. coli BCAT, 18% to the B. anthracis BCAT, and 15%
to B. subtilis YheM.
The low level of sequence conservation outside of the
genus can be seen in the alignment of selected BCAT
sequences shown in Figure 3. Only 19 residues are completely conserved across even this small sequence sampling. Interestingly, of the residues found by X-ray

Relationship of M. tuberculosis BCAT to other family III aminotransferases
Relationship of M. tuberculosis BCAT to other family III aminotransferases. In (A) selected subfamily IIIa and IIIb aminotransferases were aligned and a tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method [49] in order to define the subfamily membership of the M. tuberculosis BCAT (in blue). In (B) subfamily IIIa BCATs were aligned and a cladogram constructed by the
neighbor-joining method. The numbers represent the bootstrap values (in percentage) for each branch point.

crystallography to be important in substrate binding to
the E. coli BCAT [24], only K228(K159) and T339(T257)
were conserved across the 13 sequences in Figure 3. The
residues in parentheses represent the corresponding position in the E. coli BCAT. Of these two residues,
K228(K159) is the PLP binding site and would be
expected to be invariant. If one excludes the only DAAT in
Figure 3, then Y91(Y31), F96(36), Y233(164), and
A340(A258) can be added to this conserved list of residues important for substrate binding in the E. coli BCAT.
Clearly, sequence conservation is very low across family
III.
Expression and characterization of the branched-chain
amino acid aminotransferase
The putative M. tuberculosis BCAT was cloned as a decahistidine fusion protein for expression in E. coli. To prevent complete inclusion of the recombinant protein, it
was necessary to induce expression with a relatively low

concentration of IPTG (0.1 mM) at 20°C for 20 hr. Under
these conditions, sufficient soluble material was produced
and purified over Ni2+ affinity columns (Figure 4). Assay
of the eluted material with 2 mM each of ADEFGHIKLNQRSTVWY and 1 mM KMTB resulted in appreciable Met
production (data not shown), demonstrating that the
enzyme was active and catalysed Met formation.
The purified enzyme was screened against 2 mM of each
individual amino acid and 1 mM KMTB to determine the
amino donor range for Met regeneration. Isoleucine, leucine, and valine were found to be the most effective substrates (Figure 5), while glutamate and phenylalanine
were also active as amino donors. Tyrosine and tryptophan were found to have a much lesser ability to
transaminate KMTB and all other amino acids were inactive. The five most active amino donors were more closely
examined in order to determine their kinetic parameters
(Table 1). The Km for Leu, Ile, and Val ranged from 1.77

and prepared as described in the Materials and Methods section. The cell lysate was separated by centrifugation into pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions. The supernatant was
loaded onto an Ni2+-charged metal ion affinity column and
flow through (F), 80 mM imidazole (W), and 800 mM imidazole (E) fractions were collected. Aliquots of each fraction
were analysed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing
conditions. Lane (M) contains molecular mass markers (units

– 2.85 mM, while that for Glu was 9.53 mM and Phe 7.44
mM. The Vmax for all five amino acids was similar at 2.17
– 5.70 µmol/min/mg protein. KMTB was found to have a
Km of 4.20 mM. The enzyme was also examined for
branched-chain amino acid and KG aminotransfer in
order characterise the "classic" reactions associated with a
BCAT (Table 1). The Km of the substrates was found to be
similar, while the Vmax ranged from 11.82 – 14.35 µmol/
min/mg protein. Therefore, the tuberculosis BCAT catalyses aminotransfer of KG about 3 times more readily than
KMTB. This result is similar to that seen with the B. subtilis
BCAT, which also transaminates KG at a higher rate than
KMTB [16].
Inhibition studies
Thirteen aminooxy compounds were assayed for inhibitory effects on the tuberculosis BCAT. The enzyme was
incubated with 2.0 mM leucine, 1.0 mM KMTB and 0.1 or
1.0 mM inhibitor to assay for the effect on Met regeneration (Figure 6). With the exception of O-trimethylsilylhydroxylamine, all of the compounds inhibited Met
formation to some extent. The four most active com-

pounds at 0.1 mM were O-allylhydroxylamine, carboxymethoxylamine, O-benzylhydroxylamine, and O-tbutylhydroxylamine, and these inhibitors were further
examined in order to determine Ki values (Table 2). For all
four compounds, the inhibition data was not consistent
with a simple competitive or uncompetitive model, but fit
very well with a model of mixed mode inhibition [25].
The competitive component of inhibition yielded a Kic of
8.20 – 21.61 µM, while the uncompetitive component
gave a Kiu of 84.08 – 386 µM. Therefore, the inhibition of
the tuberculosis BCAT by these four aminooxy compounds is primarily competitive.
These four inhibitors and canaline, an aminooxy analogue of ornithine that has been demonstrated to be an
effective aminotransferase inhibitor in other systems
[16,17,26-28], were screened against M. tuberculosis and
M. marinum in vitro to determine potential antimicrobial
activity. M. marinum is a close relative of M. tuberculosis
that causes a similar disease in fish, grows faster than M.
tuberculosis in culture, and does not cause serious infections in humans [29]. As such, it is an excellent surrogate
for the initial screening of antimycobacterial agents, and
we wished to validate its use for aminooxy compounds.
All the inhibitors were found to have some degree of
antimycobacterial activity (Table 3), with MIC values
ranging from 78 µM – 10 mM and IC50 values of 8.49 µM
– 467 µM. The best inhibitor was found to be O-allylhydroxylamine. While O-t-butylhydroxylamine and O-benzylhydroxylamine appeared to be the best enzyme
inhibitors, they were significantly less effective than Oallylhydroxylamine as growth inhibitors. Unlike other
organisms examined to date [27,30], canaline was not a
particularly good inhibitor of both enzyme activity and
cell growth. The inhibition results for M. tuberculosis and
M. marinum were very similar, with MIC results being
identical or within 1 dilution. In addition, M. tuberculosis
was found to have an MIC of 2 µg/ml for streptomycin
while M. marinum had one of 8 µg/ml.

Discussion
The specific aminotransferase involved in the formation
of Met from KMTB has been examined in a number of
eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms [7,16,17]. However, within the low-GC content Gram-positive bacteria,
only B. subtilis, B. cereus, and B. anthracis have been studied [16]. In all of these Bacillus spp., a BCAT has been
found to be responsible for catalysing the reaction, with B.
subtilis and B. cereus/B. anthracis utilising enzymes from
different aminotransferase subfamilies. No member of the
high-GC content Gram-positive bacteria has been previously examined. Like B. subtilis, M. tuberculosis has been
found to catalyse Met regeneration using a subfamily IIIa
aminotransferase. In fact, the kinetic parameters for the
two aminotransferases were almost identical. The M.

tuberculosis BCAT had Km values of 1.77 – 2.85 mM and
Vmax values of 2.58 – 4.28 µmol/min/mg protein for
branched-chain amino acids and KMTB, while the B. subtilis YbgE had the corresponding values of 2.36 – 3.20 mM
and 1.84 – 2.03 µmol/min/mg protein [16]. For
branched-chain amino acids and KG, the values were 5.79
– 6.16 mM and 11.82 – 14.35 µmol/min/mg protein for
the M. tuberculosis BCAT, and 2.82 – 3.99 mM and 13.93
– 16.61 µmol/min/mg protein for B. subtilis YbgE [16].
Therefore, a 45% sequence identity between the two
enzymes is sufficient to conserve both the substrate range
and kinetic properties of the BCATs. Structural information is only available for the E. coli BCAT (IlvE) and the
human mitochondrial BCAT [24,24,31], but the key resi-

dues involved in substrate specificity appear to be conserved in the M. tuberculosis BCAT. However, while the
human mitochondrial BCAT is also a family IIIa aminotransferase, there are some clear differences when
compared to the M. tuberculosis enzyme. The human
enzyme will not accept aromatic amino acids, whereas the
tuberculosis BCAT would use phenylalanine as an amino
donor. In addition, the human enzyme contains the
redox-active motif CXXC at positions 311–314 (positions
341–344 in Figure 3) which is essential for maintaining
activity, while the tuberculosis BCAT lacks these residues.
Structural analysis of the M. tuberculosis and/or B. subtilis
enzymes would clarify these issues.

The M. tuberculosis BCAT was also screened with a variety
of aminooxy compounds as potential inhibitors. These
compounds are known aminotransferase inhibitors and
act by forming a stable Schiff-base with the PLP cofactor
[32]. Unlike previous studies [7,16,17,33], canaline was
not found to be one of the better inhibitors of aminotransferase activity. Instead, O-benzylhydroxylamine,

O-t-butylhydroxylamine, carboxymethoxylamine, and Oallylhydroxylamine were the most efficient inhibitors of
Met formation from KMTB. In addition, these compounds
demonstrated mixed type inhibition with a lower Ki for
the competitive component. This result contrasts with
that previously found for canaline with the Bacillus spp.
enzymes, where inhibition was uncompetitive [16]. It

may be possible that this difference may be due to the
structure of the inhibitors, as canaline is a γ-substituted
amino acid analogue, while the present inhibitors are αsubstituted or non-amino acid analogues. Essentially, the
inhibitors examined in this study do not present an αamino group suitable for participation in the transamination reaction whereas canaline does.
Further screening of the inhibitors against M. tuberculosis
and M. marinum in vitro demonstrated that the compounds can act as effective antimycobacterial agents. The
close correspondence of the MIC values for M. tuberculosis
and M. marinum validates the use of the latter organism as
a more rapid and safe initial screen of the
antimycobacterial properties of aminooxy compounds.
The MIC values found for streptomycin against these two
organisms was also found to be consistent with previously
published values [34]. M. marinum can thus be used to
quickly test a larger number of potential inhibitors, with
M. tuberculosis used as a follow up for more promising
candidates.
Interestingly, there was no direct correlation between the
Ki of the compounds against recombinant M. tuberculosis
BCAT and the MIC/IC50 against cell growth. It is possible
that there may be differences in the uptake rate of the various compounds into viable cells. Alternatively, the most
effective growth inhibitors act by inhibiting other PLPdependent enzymes in addition to BCAT. In any case, Oallylhydroxylamine was the most effective antimycobacterial agent with an MIC of 78 µM against M. marinum and
156 µM against M. tuberculosis. Unfortunately, the compound is corrosive, and is thus unsuitable for further in
vivo study. However, the structure of the compound
might provide the basis for the design of less toxic, more
active structural analogues. In future studies, it will be necessary to examine the effect of potential inhibitors on

human BCAT, in order to better assess the potential for
host toxicity. Any further development of aminooxy compounds as antimycobacterial agents will depend on discovering a selective inhibitor for the microbial enzyme.
Several older studies have been conducted on the antimicrobial effect of aminooxy compounds, with M. tuberculosis included amongst the organisms tested [35-39]. From
these papers, the only compound in common with the
present study was carboxymethoxylamine, which was
found to have an MIC of 313 µM (present data), 910 µM
[35], 170 – 686 µM [36], or 170 µM [37]. Given the variety of media used in these studies for determining the MIC
value, the results are quite consistent. The variety of noncommercially available aminooxy compounds synthesized and tested in these older studies included aminooxy
acids, aminooxy amides, aminooxy hydroxamic acids,
aminooxy hydrazides, aminooxy alkanes, and aminooxy
guanidines. Several of these compounds were very effective growth inhibitors in vitro, with MIC values as low as
0.30 µM against M. tuberculosis. One of the compounds
has been administered to mice, with favourable, albeit
sparsely detailed, results with regard to toxicity and in vivo
antitubercular effect [38]. While it is unclear what effect
these inhibitors would have against the M. tuberculosis
BCAT, it would appear to be possible to design more effective, less toxic aminooxy compounds for use against M.
tuberculosis.
Several interesting findings arose during the course of this
investigation. First, while M. tuberculosis has only the one
branched-chain aminotransferase, it does contain a coding sequence (Rv0858c) with a high similarity to the B.
subtilis ykrV gene product. YkrV was found to be a subfamily If aminotransferase and could also catalyse the
conversion of KMTB to Met using glutamine as the only
effective amino donor [16]. Therefore, it is possible that

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2004, 4:39

the Rv0858c gene product might be capable of KMTB
transamination. It should be stressed that while the
recombinant B. subtilis YkrV could transaminate KMTB
with glutamine, B. subtilis cell homogenates did not produce Met from KMTB when supplemented with glutamine
[16]. Similarly, cell homogenates of M. smegmatis grown
in Middlebrook 7H9 incomplete medium were only able
to produce Met from KMTB when supplemented with
valine, isoleucine, leucine, glutamate, or phenylalanine,
as was seen for the recombinant M. tuberculosis BCAT in
figure 5 (data not shown).
M. tuberculosis was found to contain no putative gene
product with significant homology to a DAAT. In fact, the
organism appeared to contain no subfamily IIIb aminotransferases. The physiological significance of a lack of
a DAAT is unclear, but many organisms do not contain a
homologue of this enzyme. With DAAT, there might be a
diminished capacity to catabolise D-amino acids for
energy, although the same reactions could be performed
by a D-amino acid oxidase. M. tuberculosis is known to be
reliant on carbohydrate catabolism during the active
growth phase and lipid metabolism during the chronic,
dormant phase [40]. Therefore, the lack of a DAAT might
be reflective of a lifestyle where protein and peptide catabolism is relatively unimportant.
Similarly, M. tuberculosis was found to lack clearly identifiable homologues of several enzymes in the Met regeneration pathway. The most glaring omission is the lack of an
S-adenosylmethionine
decarboxylase
(SAMdc)
homologue (see Figure 1). M. tuberculosis contains the preceding enzyme, methionine adenosyltransferase [21], and
has an easily identifiable homologue for the succeeding
enzyme, spermidine synthase [23]. Therefore, M.
tuberculosis must catalyse SAMdc activity via another
enzyme in order to be able to synthesize polyamines. A
previous study has demonstrated SAMdc activity in M.
bovis homogenates, but has not identified the enzyme
responsible [41]. Resolution of this issue is critical for a
more complete understanding of polyamine biosynthesis
in tuberculosis, and may yield a novel enzyme as an additional drug target. The M. tuberculosis genome also appears
to be missing homologues of the enzymes converting
methylthioribose to KMTB (see Figure 1). However, outside of K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, these enzymes have
not been well studied, and, between these two organisms,
there are key differences in the enzymes catalyzing several
steps [12,20]. In silico analyses have suggested that Pseduomonas aeruginosa, Xylella fastidiosa, Leptospira interrogans,
and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis have readily identifiable, complete Met regeneration pathways [42]. However,
the presence or absence of the pathway in a variety of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms remains to be determined by functional analysis. Therefore, there is much left

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/39

to examine before concluding that M. tuberculosis contains
neither homologues nor analogues to these Met recycling
enzymes. However, even in the absence of a complete Met
salvage pathway, M. tuberculosis, as an intracellular pathogen, might utilise exogenous KMTB as a Met source.

Conclusions
Branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase has been
cloned and characterised from M. tuberculosis. This
enzyme was found to be responsible for the formation of
methionine from ketomethiobutyrate, and could be
inhibited in vitro by a series of aminooxy compounds.
Several of these compounds were found to be effective
inhibitors of M. tuberculosis or M. marinum growth in culture, with MIC values as low as 156 µM and 78 µM respectively. These studies demonstrate the importance
branched-chain amino acid and methionine metabolism
to the survival of mycobacteria, and open up the potential
for the development of more potent and less toxic aminooxy inhibitors of the branched-chain aminotransferase.

Methods
Cells and reagents
M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. marinum Aronson
(ATCC927) were cultured in liquid Middlebrook 7H9
complete medium or on Middlebrook 7H10 plates at
37°C for M. tuberculosis or 30°C for M. marinum. All substrates and inhibitors were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Oakville, ON, Canada).
Cloning and functional expression
Genomic DNA was isolated from M. tuberculosis by vortexing packed cells in a minimal volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0/10 mM EDTA/100 mM NaCl containing 500 µm
acid washed glass beads (Sigma). After allowing the glass
beads to settle, the supernatant was added to an equal
volume of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0/100 mM NaCl/25 mM
EDTA/0.5% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate/0.1 mg/ml
proteinase K and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with
occasional gentle mixing. The mixture was then subjected
to extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1), and the DNA ethanol precipitated.

The sequence of the putative M. tuberculosis BCAT gene
was discovered by a BLAST search of the complete M.
tuberculosis H37Rv genome using the B. subtilis YbgE,
YwaA, or YheM gene products as the query proteins
[16,23,43]. The single resulting putative BCAT gene was
used to construct oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification. The 5' primer was TCGAGGCGGCCGCAAATGACCAGCGGCTCCCTTCA and incorporated a NotI
restriction site and an in-frame start codon. The 3' primer
was ATCGAGCTCGAGTTACCCCAGCCGCGCCATCCAG
and incorporated a XhoI restriction site and an in-frame
stop codon. The BCAT gene was then amplified using a

5:1 mixture of Taq:Pfu polymerases (Promega; Madison,
WI, USA) and the following program: 1 cycle of 95°C for
1.5 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1 min, and
72°C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72°C for 10 min. The
resulting PCR product was excised from a 1% agarose gel
and recovered using the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen; Mississauga,
ON, Canada). The purified product was digested with
NotI and XhoI and ligated into a similarly digested pET 19
m (a modification by us of pET19b (Novagen; Madison,
WI, USA) to incorporate extra restriction sites in the multiple cloning site) using a Rapid Ligation kit (Fermentas;
Burlington, ON, Canada). The recombinant plasmid was
then transformed into Escherichia coli XL10 cells
(Stratagene; La Jolla, CA, USA) and was subsequently
recovered using the Qiaspin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Positive clones were determined by digesting the plasmid with
NotI and XhoI to confirm the presence of the insert on a
1% agarose gel. The sequence of the insert was confirmed
by using the Big-Dye cycle sequencing kit (ABI; Foster
City, CA, USA) and an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyser.
The plasmid from positive clones was transformed into E.
coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL cells (Stratagene) for functional expression. Cells were grown in liquid LB medium
containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin and 50 µg/ml chloramphenicol at 37°C and 250 rpm until the culture reached
an A600 nm of 0.6–0.8. The culture was then cooled to 20°C
for 30 min at 250 rpm before the addition of 0.1 mM isopropylthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and an additional 20
hr of incubation at 20°C and 250 rpm.
The culture was centrifuged at 3500 × g for 20 min at 4°C,
and the cell pellet resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH
7.4)/750 mM NaCl and frozen at -20°C. The resuspended
cells were then thawed, sonicated on ice, centrifuged at
3000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant loaded
onto a 1.6 × 9.5 Chelating-Sepharose-FF column (Amersham Biosciences; Baie d'Urfe, QC, Canada) charged with
NiSO4. The column was washed with 50 mM HEPES (pH
7.4)/750 mM NaCl and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)/750 mM
NaCl/80 mM imidazole, before elution with 50 mM
HEPES (pH 7.4)/750 mM NaCl/800 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled
and concentrated to less than 3.0 ml using a 30 kDa
molecular mass cut-off filter (Pall Filtron; Mississauga,
ON, Canada). The concentrated enzyme was then dialysed against 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)/1 mM dithiothreitol/1 mM EDTA/trace pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)
overnight at 4°C. The concentrated enzymes were stored
at 4°C for several days, or with 20% v/v glycerol at -20°C
for several weeks, without appreciable loss of activity.
Recombinant protein samples were examined by electrophoresis on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels followed by
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. Protein

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/39

concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad reagent
(Bio-Rad; Mississauga, ON, Canada).
Enzyme assays and inhibition studies
Aminotransferase activities were assayed by an HPLC
method [17]. 5 or 10 µl of recombinant enzyme was
added to 100 µl of substrate mix (100 mM PO4 (pH 7.4)/
50 µM PLP/various concentrations of amino acid/various
concentrations of keto acid) and incubated for 30 min at
37°C. The samples were then stored at -20°C until analysis by HPLC. All samples were analysed by pre-column
derivatisation and reverse-phase HPLC. 10 µl of sample
was mixed with 50 µl of 400 mM borate pH 10.5 and then
with 10 µl of 10 mg/ml o-phthalaldehyde/12 µl/ml mercaptopropionate/400 mM borate pH 10.5 prior to the
injection of 7.0 µl onto a 2.1 × 200 mm ODS-AA column
(Agilent; Mississauga, ON, Canada). The column was
eluted using 2.72 mg/ml sodium acetate pH 7.2/0.018%
v/v triethylamine/0.3% v/v tetrahydrofuran as Buffer A
and 2.72 mg/ml sodium acetate pH 7.2/40% v/v methanol/40% v/v acetonitrile as Buffer B with a linear gradient
of 0 – 17% B over 16 min followed by a linear gradient of
17–100% B over 1 min and 6.0 min at 100% B. The flow
rate was 0.45 ml/min from 0 – 16 min and 0.80 ml/min
from 17–30 min. The elution of derivatised amino acids
was monitored at 338 nm and fluorometrically with an
excitation of 338 nm and an emission of 450 nm. All separations were performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC
equipped with an autosampler, variable wavelength ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometric detector, fluorescence
detector, and Chemstation operating system.

The amino donor range for Met regeneration was determined by incubating 2 mM of each individual amino acid
and 1 mM KMTB, followed by HPLC for Met quantification. Amino acids which were effective amino donors
were further studied at 0.1 – 10 mM amino acid and 10
mM KMTB to determine the kinetic constants. Similar
assays were performed with 0.1 – 10 mM KMTB and 10
mM Leu. Replacement of KMTB with ketoglutarate (KG)
in these experiments and subsequent HPLC analysis of
Glu formation allowed for the determination of BCAT
activity. The apparent Km and Vmax values for each substrate were assessed by non-linear curve fitting using the
Scientist software programmed with the Michaelis-Menton equation (Micromath; Salt Lake City, UT, USA).
Initial inhibition studies screened 13 aminooxy compounds against M. tuberculosis BCAT using 2.0 mM Leu/
1.0 mM KMTB/0.1 or 1.0 mM inhibitor in the enzyme
incubation. Inhibitors which demonstrated better than
50% reduction of activity at the 0.1 mM concentration
were further studied for the determination of Ki values.
These reactions involved 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mM Leu and
1.0 mM KMTB in the reaction mixture together with 0, 25,

50, 75, 100, 150, 200 µM of inhibitor. The Ki values were
determined by non-linear curve fitting with the Scientist
software programmed with competitive, uncompetitive,
and mixed inhibition equations [25].
In vitro growth inhibition studies were performed on M.
tuberculosis and M. marinum using the most effective
enzyme inhibitors. Cultures at mid-log growth in Middlebrook 7H9 complete medium was diluted to 2 × 105 cfu/
ml and 100 µl added to 96 well microtitre plates containing 100 µl of doubling dilutions of each inhibitor. The
final inhibitor concentration ranged from 10 mM – 298
pM. Positive and negative controls consisted of 100 µl
Middlebrook 7H9 medium replacing the inhibitor or cells
respectively. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 8 days
(M. marinum) or 37°C for 14 days (M. tuberculosis) with
no agitation before measurement of growth at A650 nm
using a Molecular Devices 96-well spectrophotometer
(Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The MIC was determined as the
lowest dilution that completely prevented microbial
growth and the IC50 was determined by non-linear curve
fitting with the Scientist software programmed with the
Chou equation [44].

Phylogenetic analysis
Additional BCAT and DAAT sequences were obtained
from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
query.fcgi?db=Protein[38]. Mycobacterium spp. BCAT
sequences from preliminary genome projects were made
available from The Institute for Genomic Research http://
www.tigr.org for M. smegmatis and M. avium, from The
Sanger Centre http://www.sanger.ac.uk for M. marinum,
and from The Institut Pasteur http://www.pasteur.fr for
M. ulcerans. These sequences were aligned using the Clustal algorithm and the BLOSUM sequence substitution
table in the ClustalX program [46]. Aligned sequences
were viewed using the Bioedit program [47] and were
then used with the ProtDist component of the PHYLIP
[48] to construct a distance matrix that was the basis for
tree construction using the neighbour-joining method
[49]. All trees were visualised using Treeview [50].
