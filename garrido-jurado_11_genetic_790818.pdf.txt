Abstract
Background: The entomopathogenic anamorphic fungus Beauveria bassiana is currently used as a biocontrol
agent (BCA) of insects. Fifty-seven Beauveria bassiana isolates -53 from Spain- were characterized, integrating group
I intron insertion patterns at the 3’-end of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal gene (LSU rDNA) and elongation
factor 1-alpha (EF1-a) phylogenetic information, in order to assess the genetic structure and diversity of this
Spanish collection of B. bassiana.
Results: Group I intron genotype analysis was based on the four highly conserved insertion sites of the LSU
(Ec2653, Ec2449, Ec2066, Ec1921). Of the 16 possible combinations/genotypes, only four were detected, two of
which were predominant, containing 44 and 9 members out of 57 isolates, respectively. Interestingly, the members
of the latter two genotypes showed unique differences in their growth temperatures. In follow, EF1-a phylogeny
served to classify most of the strains in the B. bassiana s.s. (sensu stricto) group and separate them into 5 molecular
subgroups, all of which contained a group I intron belonging to the IC1 subtype at the Ec1921 position. A number
of parameters such as thermal growth or origin (host, geographic location and climatic conditions) were also
examined but in general no association could be found.
Conclusion: Most Spanish B. bassiana isolates (77.2%) are grouped into a major phylogenetic subgroup with wordwide distribution. However, high phylogenetic diversity was also detected among Spanish isolates from close
geographic zones with low climatic variation. In general, no correlation was observed between the molecular
distribution and geographic origin or climatic characteristics where the Spanish B. bassiana isolates were sampled.

Background
The anamorphic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill.
(teleomorph: Cordyceps bassiana) is the most widely
used mycopesticide for the biological control of insect
pests [1,2], formulations based on this fungus being
available for commercial use [3]. However, there are still
many unresolved questions in our understanding of the
life of fungal entomopathogens, including their population characteristics and relationships between genotypes
and habitats or host-pathogen interactions [4]. For

predictable and successful application of biological control agents (BCAs) to control diseases and pests in natural environments, their biology and ecology must be
well understood [5-7].
The morphological features of conidia are common
tools for identification in Beauveria. Morphological and
molecular studies have shown that the broad patterns of
diversity in Beauveria have been accurately predicted in
previous morphological studies. However, they have also
shown that these approaches are insufficient to investigate species such as B. bassiana [8]. Molecular data
applied to taxonomic investigations have demonstrated
that B. bassiana is a species complex with several cryptic species and have corroborated their link to Cordyceps

teleomorphs [8-12]. In this sense, phylogenetic studies
based on nuclear ITS and elongation factor 1-alpha
(EF1-a) sequences have demonstrated the monophyly of
Beauveria and the existence of at least two lineages
within B. bassiana s.l. (sensu lato), and also that EF1-a
sequences provide adequate information for the inference of relationships in this genus [8]. Studies on the
genetic variability of BCAs such as B. bassiana are crucial for the development of molecular tools for their
monitoring in the natural environment [6].
Minisatellite loci [13], random amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) [14], universally primed (UP) PCR
[15], amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
[16], isoenzyme analyses [17], or combinations of these
methods [18] have provided useful polymorphisms to
access genetic diversity among B. bassiana isolates.
Although some molecular studies have correlated B.
bassiana genetic groups and host affiliation [9,19], more
recent evidence indicates that this is not the case since
B. bassiana contains generalist enthomopathogens with
no particular phylogenetic association with their insect
host [7,18], environmental factors being the prime selective forces for genotypic evolution in B. bassiana [7]. In
this sense, several studies have demonstrated the association between B. bassiana genetic groups and Canadian [20], Brazilian [18] and world-wide [21] climatic
zones.
Entomopathogenic species displayed a high degree of
variability-mainly attributed to the presence of group I
introns- at specific sites of the coding regions of small
and large subunits of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes
(SSU rDNA and LSU rDNA). Group I introns in entomopathogenic fungi were initially reported in Beauveria
brongniartii LSU genes [22]. Work addressing the presence and usefulness of these non-coding elements has
been reported for Beauveria. For example, Neuvéglise et
al. [23] found 14 form variants of introns, differing in
size and restriction patterns, at four different LSU positions from among a panel of 47 isolates of B. brongniartii, two of B. bassiana, and one of Metarhizium
anisopliae from several geographic origins. Coates et al.
[24] found 12 intron forms in the SSU from 35 Beauveria isolates. Wang et al. [25] analyzed the presence of
group I introns in the four LSU insertion positions,
designated Bb1 (also known as Ec2563), Bb2 (Ec2449),
Bb3 (Ec2066) and Bb4 (Ec1921), and distributed a collection of 125 B. bassiana isolates in 13 different genotypes. In that study, their sequence analyses confirmed
that the introns were invariably inserted in specific target sequences, and a strong correlation between specific
insertion sites and intron subgroups was also observed.
In addition, the features and behaviour of these group I
intron were also detected in related genera such as Cordyceps [26] and Metarhizium [27].

The present study was undertaken to investigate the
genetic variability existing in a collection of 53 Spanish
isolates of B. bassiana, obtained from different substrates
or insect hosts, and 4 isolates from other European countries. The insertion patterns of group I introns at the 3’end of the LSU rDNA genes and EF1-a phylogenetic distribution were integrated in order to explore any possible
correlation between genetic groups and geographical/climate origin, and habitat or insect host.

Results
Analysis of group I introns in 3’ LSU rDNA

The 3’-end of the nuclear LSU rDNA genes of the 57 B.
bassiana isolates (Table 1) was amplified with primers
I29 and M1 and four different sizes of PCR products
were observed on agarose gels, ranging from 0.79 to
1.77 kb. The sizes were as follows: about 1650 bp for 44
isolates; 1770 bp for one isolate; 1280 bp for 9 isolates,
and 790 bp for 3 isolates. All amplicons were purified
and sequenced in order to determine whether the insertion of multiple sequences, a feature described for members of this and other entomopathogenic genera, was
responsible for the diversity of their lengths.
After sequencing analysis (Table 2), we observed that
the smallest PCR products were detected in 3 out of the
57 isolates studied-coded Bb19, Bb50 and Bb57- indicating that these isolates had no introns, and the intronless
sequence size was 790 bp; identical in composition to a
homologous fragment of B. bassiana s.l. [25] described
previously. The other 54 isolates exhibited introns
inserted at one or more of the four possible conserved
positions. Among these 54 intron-containing isolates,
the insertion was as follows: 44 showed inserted
sequences at positions 1 (Ec2563) and 4 (Ec1921); one
isolate, Bb51, with a sequence size of 1770 bp, contained
two introns at positions 2 (Ec2449) and 4 (Ec1921), and
nine isolates contained only one intron at position 4.
The presence/absence of introns at the 3’-end of the
nuclear LSU rDNA of the 57 isolates analyzed allowed
their distribution in the following genotypes: A1B2B3A4,
B1A2B3A4, B1B2B3A4 and B1B2B3B4 (A = presence, B
= absence; according to Wang et al. [25]). Insertion sites
are numbered from 1 to 4, also following Wang’s terminology [25]: Ec2563 (position 1), Ec2449 (position 2),
Ec2066 (position 3) and Ec1921 (position 4). These genotypes and their distribution frequencies are shown in
Table 2. Three out of the 57 isolates had no introns;
nine contained one, and forty-five had two introns.
Fifty-four of 57 isolates showed an inserted intron at
position 4, and 44 isolates at position 1, whereas only
one isolate had an inserted intron at position 2. None of
the 57 isolates had introns at the 3 insertion site.
There was a significant correlation between belonging
to an intron genotype and the mean of the optimal

values of 24.3 and 33.9°C, respectively, than those
obtained for A1B2B3A4, with T opt of 26.7 and T max
35.6°C (data not shown).
Two different intron sequence sizes, 427 or 443 bp in
length, were detected at position 4 within the 54 Beauveria isolates that bore an insertion at this site, allowing
the distribution of the isolates into two sub-genotypes
(Table 2). Three of these 54 isolates had a sequence of
427 bp, showing 100% identity with the 4-position
intron sequence reported for B. bassiana Bb232 [25]. In
51 of the B. bassiana isolates, the inserted sequence
length at this position was 443 bp, and four variants
with few nucleotide differences were observed after
alignment of these sequences, showing identity values of
98 to 100% with another sequence detected at the same
position in B. bassiana Bb726 [24].
The intron sequence inserted at position 2 was only
detected for Bb51, an isolate obtained in Santander
(North Spain), and was 502 bp long. This intron shared
99 and 98% identity with two sequences previously
detected at the same position in the LSU of B. bassiana

isolates 178 and 1121 [24,25]. A 387-bp intron was identified in 44 isolates at position 1. Alignment of these
sequences revealed that the 387-bp sequence was conserved in the 44 B. bassiana isolates, where this intron
was observed, and this sequence had identity values of
98% with the previously described sequence of B. bassiana ECBL16 [24].
The seven different B. bassiana intron sequences
exhibited the typical characteristics of group I and no
ORFs were detected. These intron sequences from B.
bassiana were compared with other fungal intron
sequences available in databases for their placement in
previously reported subgroups [28]. The introns inserted
at positions 2 and 4 were placed in the IC1 subgroup
(one of the 15 subgroups, based on their secondary
structure, described within the group I introns), and
that inserted at position 1 was placed in the IE subgroup. As previously observed in group I introns
[25-27], those inserted at the same site all belonged to
the same subgroup. The intron sequences obtained in
this work were compared with other B. bassiana intron
sequences representing different subgroups to examine
their polymorphisms (data not shown). Intron size and
nucleotide identity differences were observed but P, Q,

R and S motif elements, which are needed for the formation of the secondary structure of group I introns
[29], were highly conserved among the introns inserted
at the same site, particularly for position 1. The highest
polymorphism was observed in introns inserted at 2, the
P1-P3 helices being the source of this variation, and at
4, in the P5, P6 and P8 helices.
The MP tree obtained after an alignment of the 7 different intron sequence types identified from 57 B. bassiana isolates and another 24 GenBank-deposited
sequences, which represent intron sequences from M.
anisopliae, B. bassiana and Cordyceps profilica, together
with the subsequent phylogenetic analysis are shown in
Figure 1. The tree reveals the separation of four independent groups, supported by high bootstrap values,
corresponding to the four positions reported previously
[25]: Ec1921 (position 4), Ec2066 (position 3), Ec2449
(position 2) and Ec2563 (position 1), where intron insertions occurred. The tree shows that the sequence group
located at position 4 is closer to those at position 2 and
both contain IC1 subgroup introns. Similarly, position 3
sequences are closer to position 1 sequences, and both
groups have IE subgroup introns. Within position 4,
Cordyceps and Metarhizium were separated from Beauveria sequences and formed an independent group, supported by a bootstrap value of 100%. In addition, the
five different Beauveria sequences obtained here were
separated into two of the four observed groups at this
position, supported by bootstrap values of 94% and 60%.
This separation was in accordance with the two
sequence sizes detected: 443 and 427-bp in length.
However, the four different sequence types detected for
443-bp-sized introns were not separated after phylogenetic analysis.
EF1-a gene analysis

With the exception of isolate Bb49, where no amplification was observed, all isolates afforded PCR products of
1.1 kb for the EF1-a gene with the primers tef1fw and
1750-R. Eleven different EF1-a gene sequences were
identified among the 56 isolates. The alignment and
comparison of these 11 sequences and another 18 GenBank-deposited sequences, representing different
lineages from B. bassiana s.s. (sensu stricto), B. brongniartii and B. bassiana clade C [7,8,12], produced 1757
aligned positions, with 1542 constant characters and 114
parsimony-informative characters. The MP tree is
shown in Figure 2. Of the 56 isolates analyzed, 94.6%
(53 isolates) were located in the B. bassiana s.s. clade,
and 5.4% (3 isolates) in clade C, which includes B. cf.
(uncertain taxonomy) bassiana isolates. Within B. bassiana s.s., the 53 isolates analyzed in this study were separated in five subgroups (Eu-7, Eu-8 and Eu-9 with
isolates from Spain and Portugal; Eu-3 from Spain,

Page 5 of 11

France and Denmark; and Wd-2 with world-wide distribution), supported by bootstrap values higher than 50%.
Integration of intron insertion patterns and EF1-a
phylogenetic distribution

In order to assess the phylogenic distribution of the different intron configuration types, they were mapped on
the EF1-a tree (Figure 2). All 53 B. bassiana s.s. isolates
showed an intron IC1 inserted at position 4. However,
the IE intron inserted at position 1 was only present in
the 10 isolates from subgroup Eu-7 and 33 out of 39
isolates from subgroup Wd-2. In particular, this subgroup included most of the Spanish isolates of B. bassiana forming an EF1-a phylogenetic group with isolates
681 from Romania and 792 from the USA [8] but displaying two different intron insertion models. Bb51
showed a unique intron insertion pattern, with an IC1
intron at position 2, and located separately in the Eu-9
subgroup. No introns were detected at any position in
the three B. cf. bassiana isolates from clade C.
No correlation between EF1-a phylogenetic groups
and insect host was observed. Although Eu-7 subgroup
did not included isolates of insect origin, the Wd-2 subgroup grouped isolates collected from Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera. Moreover, Wd-2
isolates from Orthoptera displayed different intron
insertion models (i.e., Bb37, Bb39 and Bb40, and Bb42).
Forty-nine Spanish and one Portuguese isolates of B.
bassiana s.s. were collected from subtropical Mediterranean climate zones and were distributed in the Eu-7,
Eu-3, Wd-2 and Eu-8 subgroups. Two Spanish isolates,
Bb52 and Bb53, were collected from continental climate
locations and were placed within subgroups Eu-7 and
Wd-2, respectively. The only B. bassiana s.s. isolate
from a humid oceanic climate included in this work,
Bb51 from Santander, displayed a characteristic intron
insertion model and formed the EF1-a subgroup Eu-9.
In addition, Bb51 produced smaller conidia than the
rest of B. bassiana isolates, this morphological feature
being statistically significant (data not shown). Nevertheless, other isolate from the same climatic zone, Bb50,
was grouped with other European isolates in B. cf. bassiana clade C.

Discussion
In the present study, we have identified different B.
bassiana genotypes and phylogenetic subgroups in a
collection of 57 isolates of this fungus, based on intron
insertion patterns and EF1-a phylogenies, respectively.
The variability in group I introns from rDNA genes
has been used as a molecular tool for the identification
of polymorphisms in entomopathogenic fungi [23,30,31].
Our study of B. bassiana LSU rDNA identified 99
introns among the 57 isolates analyzed. Four specific

generated by parsimony analysis after heuristic searches (TBR option). A bootstrap full heuristic analysis, with bootstrap intervals from 1000
replications and nodes supported in >50% of bootstrap replicates, was generated using the PAUP 4.0 program. Branch lengths are proportional
to the number of changes. Seven different intron sequence types (bolded) identified from 57 B. bassiana isolates were aligned with 24
representative intron sequences from Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma), Beauveria bassiana (Bb) and Cordyceps profilica (Csp), and an intron sequence
from Naegleria sp. (Nsp) was used as outgroup. The four group I intron insertion positions are shown as Ec1921 (position 4), Ec2066 (position 3),
Ec2449 (position 2) and Ec2563 (position 1).

Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis based on EF1-a sequences from Beauveria bassiana. The MP tree was generated by parsimony analysis
after heuristic searches (TBR option). A bootstrap full heuristic analysis, with bootstrap intervals from 1000 replications and nodes supported in
>50% of bootstrap replicates, was generated using the PAUP 4.0 program. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of changes. Eleven
sequence types identified from 56 B. bassiana isolates, of which 52 were sampled in Spain (bolded), were aligned with 18 GenBank B. bassiana s.
s., B. brongniartii and B. cf. bassiana (clade C) sequences, indicated by accession numbers as in previous works [7,8]. B. bassiana s.s. EF1-a
sequences representing European subgroups [7] are marked with an asterisk. Reference isolates from countries different to Spain, are referred to
as: Eu-1 (KVL0376 from Denmark and ARSEF1628 from Hungary), Eu-3 (KVL0373 from Denmark and ARSEF1185 from France), Eu-4 (KVL03114
from Denmark and ARSEF1848 from Belgium), Eu-5 (KVL0392 and KVL03112 from Denmark), Eu-6 (KVL0384 from Denmark and 815 from France),
Eu-7 (Bb45 from Portugal), Wd-1 (296 and 344 from USA), Wd-2 (681 from Romania, 792 from USA, Bb55 from Georgia and Bb56 from Greece),
C1 (4933 from France and Bb57 from Poland), C2 (812 from France) and B. brogniartii (KVL0392 from Denmark and 4384 from China). Cordyceps
cf. scarabaeicola (EFCC 2533) was the outgroup. Identifiers of EF1-a subgroups and intron configuration patterns are indicated.

sites of intron insertion have been described previously
in Beauveria species [23,25], but in our collection
introns were only detected at positions 1, 2 or 4.
Particularly, our study shows that 100% of B. bassiana
s.s. isolates had an intron inserted at position 4. This
position was also preferential for intron insertion
(84.4%) in a population of 125 B. bassiana isolates [25].
The number of introns found in the 57 isolates was in
agreement with the 199 introns detected in 125 B. bassiana isolates by Wang et al. [25]; the 44 introns detected
in 26 M. anisopliae isolates by Márquez et al. [31], and
the 69 introns found in 28 representative members of

the genus Cordyceps by Nikoh and Fukatsu [26]. However, only four intron insertion patterns were present in
our B. bassiana collection while greater variability was
found in other studies: 13, 7 and 9 insertion patterns
within 125 B. bassiana [25], 26 M. anisopliae [31] and
47 B. brongniartii [23] isolates, respectively.
The MP tree based on intron sequences shows that
they were distributed in four large groups, with bootstrap
values of 100%, corresponding to four insertion positions
(Figure 1). As could be expected [25,28], the introns
inserted at the same site always belonged to the same
subgroup: IC1 at positions 2 and 4, and IE at position 1.

Garrido-Jurado et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:84

Although the origin and transmission mechanisms of
group I introns have generated controversy [26], this distribution of sequences is in agreement with previously
reported observations [25] and means that introns
inserted at the same position have a monophyletic origin
and are transmitted vertically. In subsequent events
intron speciation and diversification take place as occurs
at position 4, where B. bassiana introns are separated
from Metarhizium and Cordyceps introns, and two B.
bassiana IC1 sequence sizes were located in two different
sub-clades, supported by high bootstrap values.
Rehner and Buckley’s study [8] based on EF1-a and
ITS phylogenies has revealed that i) six clades can be
resolved within Beauveria (A-F) and, excepting those
corresponding to B. bassiana (A and C), they are closely
to species previously described on the basis of their
morphology, and ii) B. bassiana s.s. (A) was determined
almost entirely from nucleotide variation at EF1-a.
Further phylogenetic studies carried out with nuclear
and/or mitochondrial DNA regions of B. bassiana from
all continents have served to resolve lineage diversity
within this species [7,12,18,21]. Since phylogenetic species by continent and in the order of their discovery
have been designated previously [7], we followed this
nomenclature to refer the new phylogenetic subgroups
identified among the Spanish B. bassiana s.s. isolates as
Eu-7, Eu-8 and Eu-9. The results obtained from MP
analyses (Figure 2), using a 1.1 kb fragment of the EF1a gene from 56 isolates from our collection, confirmed
that 53 isolates were B. bassiana s.s. (A), and three isolates grouped in three different phylogenetic subgroups
within B. cf. bassiana (C). As in a previous study [7],
the collection of Spanish isolates of B. bassiana s.s. was
separated in five phylogenetic subgroups. However, only
isolate Bb38, sampled from insects, was grouped with
one (Eu-3) of the five phylogenetic species proposed by
those authors working with a Danish collection of B.
bassiana s.s. [7], including insect isolates only. Interestingly, three phylogenetic subgroups (Eu-7, Eu-8 and Eu9) were only formed by isolates from Spanish and Portuguese isolates. However, most of the isolates in our collection (39 out of 56) were grouped with isolates from
Romania and the USA in the world-wide phylogenetic
subgroup Wd-2, which includes isolates from Europe,
Africa and North America [8].
When the different intron insertion patterns were
mapped on the B. bassiana EF1-a phylogeny (Figure 2),
the existence of a same intron genotype in a given phylogenetic subgroup could be indicative of its clonal origin as it is the case of Eu-7 and Eu-8. Previous studies
have shown that Eu-3, where Bb38 is located, is a clonal
group [7]. Isolate Bb51 was the only member of Eu-9
and the separated phylogenetic grouping of this isolate
is supported by a characteristic intron insertion pattern

Page 8 of 11

and the production of statistically significant smaller
conidia than those from any other intron genotype (data
not shown). The two different intron genotypes
observed among the isolates from the complex phylogenetic subgroup Wd-2, may indicate that homologous
recombination is involved in the IE intron loss at position 1. Previous studies have shown frequent intron
losses of group I introns in the nuclear rDNAs of Cordyceps [26]. Recently, a low frequency of sexual reproduction was observed in Eu-1 [7]; this could also be the
case of Wd-2 where the absence of an IE intron at position 1 was only observed in 6 out of 39 isolates of this
phylogenetic subgroup.
The genetic diversity of Spanish B. bassiana s.s. isolates was compared in relation to their hosts and geographical provenance and according to the latter view
[21], no general correlation can be observed between
the molecular variability among isolates and host and/or
geographical origin. Although most of the isolates in
our study were collected from soil, 8 out of 9 isolates
from insects were grouped together in the subgroup
Wd-2 although they derived from different insect orders.
Phylogenetic subgroups only indicated a tenuous dependence upon geographic origin (i.e., Bb2-5 located in Eu7 or Bb23-26 and Bb29-31 located in Wd-2). A recent
phylogeographic report [18] has provided evidence that
the genetic distance of Brazilian B. bassiana isolates correlates with geographical distance, suggesting that
according to Rehner’s study [12] allopatry plays an
important role in the phylogenetic diversification of B.
bassiana. The authors of another recent study [7] concluded that multiple phylogenetic species of B. bassiana
s.s. co-exist in sympatry within the limited natural habitat of a bordering hedgerow. We observed that isolates
sampled in close locations were placed in different phylogenetic subgroups (i.e., Bb35 and Bb36, from Cádiz,
belong to Eu-7 and Wd-2, respectively; and Bb38, and
Bb39-40 and Bb42, from Badajoz, group within Eu-3
and Wd-2, respectively, Bb39-40 and Bb42 having different intron genotypes). According to Meyling’s study [7],
the high phylogenetic diversity of the Spanish isolates of
B. bassiana s.s. could be explained by the untilled habitats where most of them were sampled (i.e., olive, oak,
pine, meadow or scrubland).
Previous studies have suggested that the saprophytic
phase of entomopathogenic fungi exerts evolutionary
pressure on the genotype and that adaptation to a habitat type is associated with their environmental preferences [20]. Recent studies have also pointed out the
importance of climatic conditions in the prevalence and
distribution of B. bassiana genotypes [21]. Our study
was carried out on 51 isolates from subtropical Mediterranean climate locations that were distributed within the
phylogenetic subgroups Eu-3, Eu-7, Eu-8, Wd-2 and

Garrido-Jurado et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:84
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/84

clade C; 4 isolates were from continental climate sites
and grouped in Eu-7, Wd-2 and clade C; and 2 isolates
came from a humid oceanic climate zone, being located
in Eu-9 and clade C. Interestingly, the only B. bassiana
s.s. from a humid oceanic climate was the singular isolate Bb51. The fact that isolates from Mediterranean or
continental climates overlapped in different phylogenetic
subgroups, could be due to lower differences among the
abiotic conditions existing in Spain, a country covering
far smaller geographical surface and with much less
variability than that considered in other Canadian, Brazilian or world-wide studies where phylogenetic species
showed a better correlation with climate characteristics
[21], biogeographic distribution [18] and habitat [20]. In
a thermal growth study [20] it was described that B.
bassiana genetic groups from three different habitats in
Canada were associated with temperature preferences.
When we explored the thermal preferences within a set
of Spanish B. bassiana s.s. isolates belonging to the two
main intron genotypes (A1B2B3A4 and B1B2B3A4) and
four phylogenetic EF1-a subgroups (data not shown), a
correlation between intron genotypes and the mean
optimal and maximum temperatures for growth was
observed, both growth temperatures being significantly
lower in the B1B2B3A4 genotype with respect to
A1B2B3A4. However, no correlation was observed
between thermal preferences and the climatic origin of
the Spanish B. bassiana isolates.

Conclusion
Four intron genotypes, and five and three phylogenetic
subgroups within B. bassiana s.s. and B. cf. bassiana
(clade C) have been identified, respectively, in a collection of 57 B. bassiana isolates -53 from Spain. The highest polymorphism was observed in introns inserted at
positions 2 and 4. All B. bassiana s.s. displayed an IC1
intron inserted at position 4. Integration of intron insertion patterns and EF1-a phylogenetic distribution served
to demonstrate the monophyletic origin and vertical
transmission of introns inserted at the same site. In subsequent events intron speciation and diversification take
place as occurs at site 4, where B. bassiana introns are
separated from Metarhizium and Cordyceps introns. No
general correlation was observed between the molecular
data and insect host, but a tenuous correlation was
detected with the geographic origins. The high phylogenetic diversity of the Spanish isolates of B. bassiana s.s.
could be due to the untilled habitats where most of
them were sampled.
Methods
Fungal isolates and morphological studies

The 57 isolates of B. bassiana used in this study were
selected from a Spanish collection of 960 records at the

Page 9 of 11

CRAF (Ciencias y Recursos Agrícolas y Forestales)
Department of the University of Cordoba (Córdoba,
Spain), representing different geographic origins, habitats/hosts and climates. Fifty-three Spanish isolates were
studied, 51 of them being collected from subtropical
Mediterranean climate zones -characterized by warm to
hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters- and 2
from a humid oceanic climate. Forty-five out of these 53
isolates were from soil, most of them from poorly tilled
or untilled fields (i.e., olive, oak, pine or scrubland) and
8 were isolated from insects. Information about these
isolates is provided in Table 1. All fungal isolates were
derived from single conidial spores grown on Malt
Extract Agar plates (MEA, Difco Becton Dickinson,
Sparks, MD).
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing

Mycelia for DNA extraction were obtained as previously
described [31]. Total DNA was extracted using the
method previously described [32].
Two nuclear gene regions, LSU rDNA and EF1-a,
were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. The 3’-end of
the nuclear LSU rDNA cluster was also amplified with
primers I29 (5’-CTGCCCAGTGCTCTGAATGTC-3’)
[25] and M1 (5’-GGTAAAACTAACCTGTCTCACG-3’)
[31] for the 57 isolates of Beauveria included in the
study. The distribution of putative introns was investigated using the following combinations of previously
described primers: I29-I38, I31-I32, I21-I22 and E23-M1
[25,31]. A 1100 bp fragment spanning the 3’ 2/3 of the
EF1-a gene was amplified with primers tef1fw (5’GTGAGCGTGGTATCACCA-3’) [33] and 1750-R (5’GACGCATGTCACGGACGGC-3’) for all isolates,
except Bb49. The oligonucleotide 1750-R was designed
at the 3’-end of an alignment of Beauveria EF1-a genes
obtained from databases. PCR was performed in a total
volume of 50 μl containing 25 ng of genomic DNA and
0.20 μM concentrations of each of the above primers,
using the Taq polymerase system (Biotools B&M Labs,
Madrid, Spain) and following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The amplification program included an
initial denaturing cycle of 1 min at 94°C, followed by 35
cycles of 1 min 30 s at 94°C, 2 min (for EF1-a) or 2 min
30 sec for (LSU rDNA) at 55 (for EF1-a) or 57°C (for
LSU rDNA) and 3 min at 72°C, and a final extension
step of 7 min at 72°C in a PCR System 9700 Genetic
Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose
gels buffered with 1 × TAE [34] and stained with ethidium bromide. A 100-bp ladder molecular weight standard (Roche Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) was also
used.
The PCR products were purified from agarose gels
using the Geneclean II kit ® system (Q-Biogene,

Garrido-Jurado et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:84
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/84

Carlsbad, CA), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
DNA sequences were obtained using an automated ABI
377 Prism Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) with fluorescent terminators at the Department of
Microbiology and Genetics of the University of Salamanca. All PCR products were sequenced in both directions, using amplification primers and internal primers
when necessary.
The intron and EF1-a sequences obtained in this
study were deposited in the GenBank database. Intron
and EF1-a sequence accession numbers are available in
Table 2 and additional file 1 respectively.
Molecular analyses

The presence or absence of introns at the 3’-end of the
nuclear LSU rDNA of each isolate was determined by
detecting previously described target sequences [25]. In
order to compare the results obtained in this study with
the B. bassiana genotypes based on previously reported
intron insertion patterns in the LSU rDNA gene,
Wang’s terminology was used [25]. The intron
sequences detected in each insertion point were aligned
with representative Beauveria sequences to examine
their polymorphisms and to identify conserved motifs.
Intron subgroups were determined by comparison with
representative secondary structures from previous studies [25-27,30].
Intron and EF1-a sequences were analyzed separately.
Published sequences for isolates included within the genera Beauveria, Metarhizium and Cordyceps were retrieved
from GenBank and included in the alignments. Alignments were generated using the MegAlign (DNASTAR
package, 1989-92, London, UK) and the CLUSTALX 1.81
program [35]. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out with
the PAUP* version 4.0 b10 program. Gaps, encoded as
missing data, and uninformative characters were excluded
from the analyses. Most-parsimonious (MP) trees were
obtained for intron and EF1-a data from heuristic
searches using TBR branch-swapping [36], and all MP
trees were summarized in a single tree in which all branch
lengths equal to zero were collapsed by polytomies. An
intron sequence of Naegleria sp. (AM167886) and the
EF1-a gene of Cordyceps cf. scarabaeicola (AY531967)
were used as outgroups in the analysis of intron and EF1a sequences, respectively. A bootstrap full heuristic analysis consisting of 1000 replicates was performed, and a 50%
majority rule tree was produced.
