Abstract
This article is a response to Klütsch and Crapon de Caprona
See correspondence article http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/119 and our original research article http://
www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/16.
Background
The origin of domestic dogs has been a source of controversy for the past two decades [1-4]. In our recent
study [5], we provided evidence for an event that likely
occurred early in the history of domestic dogs. We
found that the Middle East is the geographic origin of
all small domestic dogs. However, Klütsch and Crapon
de Caprona question the conclusion from our study [5],
on the basis of concerns about sample size, sampling
locations, nucleotide diversity estimates and ascertainment biased single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
data. The authors argue that these issues preclude identification of East Asia (or any other region) as the geographic origin for small domestic dogs. As discussed
below, we remain confident in the findings of our study.
Moreover, our results are independently supported by
the archaeological record [6,7] and a recent study by
vonHoldt et al. [8]. (Note that all figures, tables and
additional files referred to throughout are those from
the original paper.)
Nucleotide diversity
Klütsch and Crapon de Caprona critique our use of
nucleotide diversity estimates. They suggest this is the
main support for our conclusion and that it is based on
limited sequence data and samples derived from a limited region. However, we provided diverse sources of
evidence for our conclusion of a Middle Eastern origin
of small domestic dogs: (1) their close relationship on a
principal component analysis (PCA) plot of dog-derived
SNPs, (2) high levels of nucleotide diversity in insulinlike growth factor 1 gene (IGF1) intron 2 of Middle
Eastern wolves, (3) a small number of SNP differences

between haplotypes of Middle Eastern wolves and small
dogs, and (4) phylogenetic proximity of the major small
dog haplotype and haplotypes of Middle Eastern wolves.
Although strong conclusions cannot be drawn from any
single analysis, the combined results consistently point
to the Middle East as the most likely origin of small
domestic dogs.
We recognise that our nucleotide diversity estimates
do have overlapping standard deviations, however, we
do not claim that the populations are significantly different nor is this the most reliable method for determining
geographic ancestry [8,9]. For more precise measures of
nucleotide diversity, we refer the reader to vonHoldt et
al. [8], which shows, on the basis of 48,000 SNPs, that
Middle Eastern wolves are the dominant source of genomic variation of modern domestic dogs.

Dog-derived SNPs
Klütsch and Crapon de Caprona argue that the dogderived SNP dataset contains ascertainment bias that can
confound our results. We acknowledged that the SNP
dataset may be affected by ascertainment bias (p. 2), but
we see no reason why such bias would favour high diversity in Middle Eastern over East Asian wolves since the
ascertainment panel included only dogs and these were
of European origin. Nonetheless, the possibility of ascertainment bias in part motivated our additional sequencing analysis. It should also be noted that the SNPs in
this dataset surround IGF1 intron 2 with only a few SNPs
in common with the sequenced region. Thus, the
sequenced region is a detailed view of the area containing
the diagnostic mutations for small body size.
Sampling
Klütsch and Crapon de Caprona assert that our sample
size was sparse. In our initial full-length sequencing

effort, we included one to two samples from all major
geographical regions (6331 bp; Figure 1, [5]) and in our
secondary sequencing effort additional samples and
regions were included (4811 bp) to verify sampling did
not bias our results.
Furthermore, two Chinese, two Spanish, one Italian
and one Indian grey wolf samples were used across all
datasets. Specifically, one of the Spanish grey wolf
samples used in the sequencing effort was observed to
be heterozygous for two haplotypes found to be most
similar to the small dog 20 SNP haplotype (Hap 50
and Hap 29; Additional file 2). Unfortunately, the
Israel grey wolf samples used in the dog-derived SNP
dataset were not available for sequencing. Thus, different samples from the same region were used. However,
the consistency of the phylogenetic grouping of these
haplotypes across sequencing experiments argues that
this would not affect the outcome of our analysis.
Lastly, extending the sequenced region would introduce further recombination points confounding the
signal for the geographic origin of the diagnostic mutations for body size.

South-East Asia or Spain versus a Middle Eastern
origin
Overall, Klütsch and Crapon de Caprona assert that our
sampling was biased in such a way as to exclude SouthEast Asia or Spain as an origin for small dogs. Based on
mtDNA, South-East Asia has been suggested as the possible origin of dogs [1,2], but see Balloux [9], Boyko et
al. [10], and Pang et al. [1] for a discussion of the limitations of mtDNA sampling. However, none of the phylogenetic analyses in our study shows a close
relationship of Chinese or Spanish wolf haplotypes to
the small dog haplotypes (both minor and major haplotypes). The exception is for trees constructed from the
sequence data 5’ of the recombination point, which
show association with the minor small dog haplotype,
but this region does not include the diagnostic mutations for small size. In the 6331 bp data set, all Israeli
wolves fall ancestral to large dog haplotypes and cluster
with the major small dog haplotype while the Chinese
and Spanish wolf haplotypes cluster with the large dog
haplotypes. These data also show that haplotypes from
Israeli not Chinese or Spanish grey wolves have the least
number of SNP differences from the small dog haplotype (3 versus 8 or 10 and 14 SNP differences, respectively). In the 4811-bp data set, all but two (out of eight
haplotypes; n = 8) of the Israeli wolf haplotypes clusters
with the major small dog haplotype, while the two (out
of two haplotypes; n = 2) Chinese wolf haplotypes and
the two (out of two haplotypes; n = 2) Spanish wolf
haplotypes cluster with the large dog haplotypes. Moreover, although it is true that the Chinese wolf haplotype

Page 2 of 3

(Hap 4) has only three SNP differences from the minor
small dog haplotype (Hap 3) in the 6331 bp dataset,
these differences are found 3’ of the recombination
point which contain the diagnostic small dog alleles and
is identical to the major small dog haplotype (Hap 5).
This suggests the similarity is due to a recombination
event and not ancestry with small dogs.
The authors suggest that oversampling of the Israeli
wolf and undersampling of the Chinese and Spanish
wolves also contributed to the exclusion of these regions
as a potential source population. However, any two randomly chosen Israel samples would produce the same
pattern because only one of the Israeli wolf samples was
observed to be heterozygous for two haplotypes (Hap 16
and Hap 5) that both clustered with the large dogs,
while both of the Chinese and Spanish wolf haplotypes
clustered with large dog haplotypes. We also had similar
sample sizes as China from Iran and India, which show
a pattern consistent with the Israeli wolf samples and
further support the Middle East as the origin of small
dogs. Moreover, Hap 20 is in high frequency across
Israel (4 out of 16; 0.25), Iran (1 out of 2; 0.5) and India
(3 out of 4; 0.75), which clusters with the small dog haplotype. Thus if South-East Asia or any other region were
the origin for the small haplotype we would expect at
least one of these haplotypes to cluster with the small
dog haplotype, and we find none.

Conclusions
In conclusion, Klütsch and Crapon de Caprona critique our study by suggesting an inadequacy of sample
size and location, lack of significant differences
between nucleotide diversity estimates and biased
results from dog-derived SNP data that all preclude
identification of East Asia or any other region as a
possible origin for small domestic dogs. First, we
acknowledge a lack of significant differences in
nucleotide diversity between populations but feel this
is a minor point in light of all the other analyses in
our study that support a Middle Eastern origin. Second, ascertainment bias cannot explain our results.
Lastly, extensive haplotype and phylogenetic analyses
and consistent patterns across samples from the Middle East all point to an origin for small dogs there.
Additionally, the results of our study are independently supported by the archaeological record [6,7]
and a recent study by vonHoldt et al. [8].
