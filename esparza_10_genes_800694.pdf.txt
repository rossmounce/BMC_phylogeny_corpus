Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Carbon fixation in
A. ferrooxidans

Abstract
Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is chemolithoautotrophic g-proteobacterium that thrives at extremely
low pH (pH 1-2). Although a substantial amount of information is available regarding CO2 uptake and fixation in a
variety of facultative autotrophs, less is known about the processes in obligate autotrophs, especially those living in
extremely acidic conditions, prompting the present study.
Results: Four gene clusters (termed cbb1-4) in the A. ferrooxidans genome are predicted to encode enzymes and
structural proteins involved in carbon assimilation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle including form I of
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO, EC 4.1.1.39) and the CO2-concentrating carboxysomes.
RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that each gene cluster is a single transcriptional unit and thus is an operon.
Operon cbb1 is divergently transcribed from a gene, cbbR, encoding the LysR-type transcriptional regulator CbbR
that has been shown in many organisms to regulate the expression of RubisCO genes. Sigma70-like -10 and -35
promoter boxes and potential CbbR-binding sites (T-N11-A/TNA-N7TNA) were predicted in the upstream regions of
the four operons. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed that purified CbbR is able to bind to the
upstream regions of the cbb1, cbb2 and cbb3 operons, demonstrating that the predicted CbbR-binding sites are
functional in vitro. However, CbbR failed to bind the upstream region of the cbb4 operon that contains cbbP,
encoding phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19). Thus, other factors not present in the assay may be required for
binding or the region lacks a functional CbbR-binding site. The cbb3 operon contains genes predicted to encode
anthranilate synthase components I and II, catalyzing the formation of anthranilate and pyruvate from chorismate.
This suggests a novel regulatory connection between CO2 fixation and tryptophan biosynthesis. The presence of a
form II RubisCO could promote the ability of A. ferrooxidans to fix CO2 at different concentrations of CO2.
Conclusions: A. ferrooxidans has features of cbb gene organization for CO2-assimilating functions that are
characteristic of obligate chemolithoautotrophs and distinguish this group from facultative autotrophs. The most
conspicuous difference is a separate operon for the cbbP gene. It is hypothesized that this organization may
provide greater flexibility in the regulation of expression of genes involved in inorganic carbon assimilation.

as low as pH 1 has been reported [2]. The microorganism is a key player in the solubilization of copper in
industrial bioleaching operations and makes an important contribution to the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and metals in pristine and manmade acidic

equilibrium with the atmosphere and not in the bicarbonate form typically found at circum-neutral pHs [3].
A. ferrooxidans has previously been shown [4,5] to
have candidate genes (cbbL and cbbS) for the large and
small subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/
oxygenase (RubisCO, EC 4.1.1.39) that catalyses CO 2
fixation by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle in
many organisms [6]. cbbL and cbbS are linked to genes
predicted to encode carboxysome shell proteins [7] and
a divergently transcribed gene encoding the LysR-type
transcription regulator CbbR [4]. The intergenic region
between cbbR and cbbL is predicted to harbor binding
sites for CbbR [4]. In addition, microarray transcript
profiling experiments have detected differential expression of several genes in A. ferrooxidans potentially
involved in the CBB cycle depending on the growth substrate used [8].
These observations taken together, suggest that, in
A. ferrooxidans, CbbR can regulate the expression of
RubisCO and the carboxysome genes and therefore is
likely to be involved in the regulation of carbon fixation
as has been observed in other autotrophic bacteria
including: Xanthobacter flavus [9], Ralstonia eutropha
H16 [10], Chromatium vinosum [11], Nitrobacter vulgaris [12], Halothiobacillus neapolitanus [13], Thiobacillus denitrificans [14], Rhodobacter sphaeroides [15],
Rhodobacter capsulatus [16], Rhodospirillum rubrum
[17], Hydrogenovibrio marinus [18], Nitrosomonas europaea [19] and Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2 [20].
However, no coherent model has been developed for
A. ferrooxidans to explain all the data and little experimental evidence has been provided to support several of
the aforementioned observations, prompting the current
investigation.

H2SO4) containing 5 g/l elemental sulfur at 30°C under
aerobic conditions on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm as
described previously [21]. Escherichia coli harboring
plasmids was grown at 37°C in LB broth with ampicillin
(Amp: 100 μg/ml).
General DNA techniques and sequencing of DNA

A. ferrooxidans cultures were centrifuged at 800 × g to
remove solid sulfur precipitates prior to cell harvest.
Unattached cells were pelleted at 8000 × g for 10 min.
The cell pellet was resuspended in 9 K salt solution for
washing and washed cells were collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min as described previously [21].
Standard procedures [22] were employed to isolate
genomic and plasmid DNA from bacteria, to transform
plasmid DNA into E. coli, and for general DNA handling. Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying
enzymes were used as recommended by the manufacturers. Plasmid DNA was prepared by means of the
QIAprep Spin Mini Kit (Qiagen). Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) products were amplified with Taq DNA
polymerase (Fermentas) and purified from agarose gels
using the QiaEx DNA Purification Kit (Qiagen). Each
PCR reaction contained in a volume of 25 μl 1 ng of
template DNA, 0.5 μM of required primers and 0.2 mM
of each deoxyribonucleotide in 1× PCR buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Fermentas). PCR conditions were as
follows: initial denaturing step at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 amplification cycles (denaturation at 95°C
for 30 s, annealing at the appropriate temperature
depending on the specific primer pairs for 20 s, elongation at 72°C) and a final elongation step at 72°C for 10
min. DNA sequencing of pBAD-cbbR was carried out by
the Göttingen Genomics Laboratory (Göttingen,
Germany).

preparation was treated with DNase I (Fermentas)
before proceeding with the cDNA synthesis step. One
microgram of total cellular RNA was used for each reaction. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed on purified RNA using the One-Step RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen). The sequences of the RT and PCR primers
used are provided in Table 2. As controls, reactions
were carried out that included RNA but lacked reverse
transcriptase to assess genomic DNA contamination and
that lacked RNA but contained 1 ng of genomic DNA.
Cloning and expression of cbbR

A DNA fragment corresponding to the coding region of
cbbR of A. ferrooxidans was amplified by PCR using primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) cbbRfw and
cbbRrev (Table 2). The amplified product was cloned
into the expression vector pBAD-TOPO (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The resulting plasmid pBAD-cbbR was introduced by electroporation into E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) competent cells
[22]. E. coli was grown at 37°C in 10 ml LB containing
100 μg/ml ampicillin to an OD600 of 0.8. Overproduction of the recombinant His6-tagged CbbR protein was
initiated by adding arabinose to a final concentration of
0.1% (w/v) with continued shaking at 200 rpm for 12 h.
Purification of CbbR

Cells from 1.5 l of induced culture were harvested by
centrifugation (8,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C) and at
-20°C. After thawing the cell pellet was resuspended in
40 ml denaturing buffer containing 6 M guanidine-HCl,
100 mM NaH2PO4 and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and
incubated at room temperature with continuous stirring
for about 30 min until inclusion body proteins were
solubilized. Any remaining insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g and 7°C for
20 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered through
a 0.45-μm membrane and the recombinant protein subsequently purified by affinity chromatography on a 2.5ml Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column under amalgam conditions (denaturing conditions-native conditions). Initially the protein was adsorbed to the matrix under
denaturing conditions at room temperature after equilibration with binding denaturing buffer (BDB) containing
8 M urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4 and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0. The column was first washed with BDB and then
with washing denaturing buffer (WDB) containing 8 M
urea, 100 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.0. The
elution of CbbR was carried out under native conditions
at 4°C after equilibrating the column with native buffer
(20 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2 PO4 ,
pH 8.0). His6-CbbR was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min with eluting native buffer (250 mM imidazole,
300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0). The eluted

fractions were monitored at 280 nm. Fractions with the
highest protein content were pooled, dialysed twice
against 50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.8 containing
200 mM KCl, 10 m MgCl2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 50% (w/v)
glycerol. The final protein concentration was 4 mg/ml.
Protein preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide
slab gels under reducing conditions in the presence of
100 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein contents were determined using the method of Bradford [24], with bovine
serum albumin as a standard. CbbR was stored at -20°C.
Production of antisera to CbbR

Multiple intradermal injections were applied to immunize a female Californian giant rabbit (3.0 kg) as
described by [25]. A fresh CbbR preparation (0.5 ml; 1
mg/ml) was emulsified in one volume of complete
Freund adjuvant (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories,
Melbourne, Australia). The emulsion was prepared
under aseptic conditions and 1.0 ml was initially injected
into four sites on the back of the animal. Booster injections were given in the same way 75 days after the primary immunization, except that incomplete Freund
adjuvant was used. The immune response was monitored by Western Blotting assays with serum separated
from test blood samples (1.0 to 2.0 ml) that were
obtained from an ear vein every 15 to 20 days after each
immunization.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)

DNA fragments containing the four potential cbb
operon promoter regions were amplified by PCR and
simultaneously biotinylated using the biotin 5’-labelled
primers (Table 2). DNA-binding assays were performed
at 30°C in a final volume of 17 μl containing 12 mM
HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM
EDTA, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 μg/μl of bovine serum albumin and 2 μg/μl of
poly(dI-dC). The indicated amount of CbbR protein
(~290 μM) was incubated with the biotin end-labeled
target DNA (20 pmol) for 15 min. A 50-fold excess of
unlabeled DNA probe was used to challenge the labeled
probe. In supershift experiments, a 1:500 dilution of
CbbR-specific antiserum was added to the reaction after
DNA binding of CbbR and incubated for an additional
15 min. After the binding reactions, samples were
loaded onto a low-ionic strength nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (4.8% [w/v], which had been prerun at a
constant current of 200 mA for more than 90 min, and
electrophoresed at 150 mA for about 60 min in 0.5×
TBE buffer (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid and 2
mM EDTA). The separated CbbR-DNA complexes were

electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto a nylon
membrane in semi-dry blotting apparatus (Biometra,
Göttingen). CbbR-DNA binding was detected using a
streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a
chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) followed by
autoradiography.
Bioinformatic analyses

Metabolic pathways involved in CO2 assimilation were
retrieved from KEGG http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/.
Protein sequences derived from known genes involved
in CO 2 assimilation were used as query sequences to
search the genome sequence of A. ferrooxidans ATCC
23270, using TBlastN and BlastP, respectively, with
default parameters. When a prospective candidate gene
was identified, its predicted protein sequence was then
used to formulate a BlastP http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
search of the nonredundant database at NCBI. Only
bidirectional best hits were accepted as evidence for
putative orthologs. Candidate genes and their translated proteins were further characterized employing
the following bioinformatic tools: ClustalW [26] for
primary structure similarity relations, PSI-PRED [27]
for secondary structure predictions, Prosite [28] for
motif predictions, ProDom [29] and Pfam [30] for
domain predictions. Information regarding the organization of genes in A. ferrooxidans was obtained from
[2]. Logos were generated using the web-based application available at http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi.
The height of each letter in bits corresponds to its
relative abundance at each position. Promoters of the
s 70 -type and rho-independent transcriptional stops
were predicted for operons cbb1-4 using the programs
BPROM http://www.softberry.com and Transterm [31],
respectively.
The organization of gene clusters in facultative and
obligate autotrophs involved in the CBB cycle was
derived from information available in IMG-JGI http://
www.jgi.doe.gov/ and MicrobesOnline http://www.
microbesonline.org/, with additional information added
for H. marinus [18] and A. ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus
caldus and Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (this study). The
phylogenetic cladogram of these bacteria was constructed
from 16 S rRNA sequences obtained from KEGG Orthology K01977 http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html and
from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ for A. caldus (GI454888), A. thiooxidans (GI454888) and H. marinus (GI3882094). 16 S rRNA alignments were carried out
using ClustalW and the cladogram was constructed by
the NJ method using the program MEGA 4.0 [32]. The
robustness of the tree was evaluated by bootstrapping
using 1000 replicas. The tree was rooted using the 16 S
rRNA of the ε-proteobacterium Helicobacter pylori.

Results, Discussion and Conclusions
The genome of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 encodes
CbbR, a LysR-type transcription factor

A gene cbbR was predicted in the genome of A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 (type strain) that potentially encodes
a protein with significant amino acid sequence similarity
and domain structure to other well-documented CbbRs
of the LysR family of transcription factors (Additional
file 1). cbbR is divergently transcribed from cbbL1, a
gene predicted to encode the large subunit of form I
RubisCO. The genetic linkage between cbbR and cbbL1
is known to be conserved in a number of autotrophic
bacteria that fix CO2 via the CBB cycle such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Fe1 [4], Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus [33], Nitrosomonas europaea [19],
Rhodobacter sphaeroides [34], Rhodobacter capsulatus
[35], R. eutropha H16 [36], Rhodospirillum rubrum [17],
Thiobacillus denitrificans [14] and Xanthobacter flavus
[9]. We here extend this list to include: Alkalilimnicola
ehrlichii, Halorhodospira halophila, Methylibium petroleiphilum, Nitrobacter winogradskyi, Nitrosococcus
oceani, Nitrosospira multiformis, Thiomicrospira crunogena and Xanthobacter autotrophicus (Additional file 2).
The cbbR-cbbL1 intergenic region of A. ferrooxidans
strain Fe1 has been shown to contain divergent s70-type
promoters and to exhibit two CbbR binding sites that
partially overlap these promoters ([4], Figure 1A). The
binding sites conform to the pseudo-palindromic motif
TNA-N 7 -TNA [13] that is a subset of the consensus
LysR-type transcription factor binding site T-N11-A [37].
Logos were derived from a multigenome comparison of
the cbbR-cbbL1 intergenic region of a number of bacteria (Additional file 3) and were aligned with the CbbR
sites of A. ferrooxidans strain Fe1, allowing the prediction of the CbbR binding sites of A. ferrooxidans ATCC
27230 (Figure 1B and 1C).
Organization and expression of gene clusters predicted
to be involved in CO2 fixation and associated pathways
of central carbon metabolism

A cluster of 16 genes, termed cbb1, was predicted to be
involved CO 2 fixation. RT-PCR experiments showed
that cbb1 is transcribed as a single unit and thus can be
considered to be an operon (Figure 2A). Operon cbb1
consists of cbbL1 and cbbS1, potentially encoding the
large and small subunits of form IAc RubisCO, seven
cso genes predicted to be involved in a-carboxysome
formation, two genes (cbbQ1 and cbbO1) presumed to
be involved in RubisCO activation and cbbA, potentially
encoding a fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. Gene
descriptions are provided in Table 3.
Three additional gene clusters termed cbb2 (four
genes), cbb3 (twelve genes) and cbb4 (five genes) were

identified that are predicted to encode functions related
to CO2 fixation and central carbon metabolism (Table
3). RT-PCR experiments revealed that gene clusters
cbb2, cbb3 and cbb4 are transcribed as single units,
respectively, and thus constitute operons (Figure 2B-D).
cbb2 contains genes (cbbL2 and cbbS2) encoding additional copies of the large and small subunit of form IAq
RubisCO and associated RubisCO activation genes
(cbbQ2 and cbbO2) (Figure 2B). The deduced amino
acid sequences of these genes are similar but not identical to the corresponding proteins encoded in the cbb1
operon; CbbL1 and CbbL2 exhibit 84% amino acid
sequence identity, whereas CbbS1 and CbbS2 share 56%
identity and CbbQ1 and CbbO1 have 84% and 59%
identity with CbbQ2 and CbbO2, respectively.
Genes predicted to be encoded by operons cbb3 and
cbb4 are listed in Table 3 and their organization within
these operons is shown in Figure 2.
The two enzymes that are unique to the CBB cycle are
RubisCO (encoded by operons cbb1 and cbb2) and
phosphoribulokinase (encoded by operon cbb4).
RuBisCO catalyzes the first step of the cycle, the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) with CO2.
Phosphoribulokinase catalyzes the last step of the cycle
which is the regeneration of the CO2 acceptor molecule,
RuBP, by phosphorylation of ribulose 5-phosphate with
ATP. Other steps of the cycle, encoded in operon cbb3,
are catalyzed by enzymes common to glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways in central carbon metabolism
[8,36].
Promoters of the s70-type and rho-independent transcriptional stops were predicted for operons cbb1-4

(Figure 2). In addition, potential CbbR-binding sites
were identified in the four operons based on the detection of conserved TNA-N7 -TNA and T-N 11 -A motifs
described above for operon cbb1 (Figure 2).
CbbR binds in vitro to the predicted s70-like promoter
regions of operons cbb1-4

Binding of CbbR to DNA fragments containing the predicted promoters of the four operons cbb1-4 was evaluated in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSAs). For this purpose the cbbR gene was cloned
and expressed in E. coli. Purified CbbR was used to prepare antisera (anti-CbbR antibodies) whose activity was
checked by Western blotting against purified CbbR
(data not shown). Biotin-labeled promoter DNA for the
EMSA assays was prepared by PCR using primers specified in Table 2 and whose locations within the four
operons are shown in Figure. 2.
Results show that CbbR was able to retard the promoter regions of the cbb1, cbb2 and cbb3 operons but not
the cbb4 operon (Figure 3). When a 50-fold molar
excess of unlabelled fragment was included in the binding assay retardation of the labelled fragments was abolished. Furthermore, the addition of anti-CbbR
antibodies to the reaction produced a supershift in
migration, indicating that the shift was caused specifically by the binding of CbbR.
Binding of CbbR to the predicted promoter regions of
operons cbb1-3 suggests that it is involved in their regulation. The reason for the failure of CbbR to retard the
DNA fragment containing the predicted promoter of the
cbb4 operon is not known. Perhaps this fragment

requires the presence of additional factors for CbbR
binding that are not present in the in vitro cocktail used
for the EMSA analysis. Alternatively, the predicted
CbbR binding site is not functional.
Gene organization of the cbb operons

The cbb3 operon includes not only genes involved in
carbon assimilation but also harbors genes with similarity to trpE and trpG that are predicted to encode the
components I and II of anthranilate synthase, the first
enzyme of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. Anthranilate synthase catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to

anthranilate with the concomitant release of pyruvate
[38,39]. In some cases, this conversion can be accomplished by TrpE alone [40].
In order to determine if the association between trpEG
and the cbb genes is restricted to A. ferrooxidans, an
examination of gene organization was carried out in all
sequenced genomes of facultative and obligate autotrophic proteobacteria. Twenty-six proteobacterial
organisms (11 a-, 7 b- and 8 g-) were analyzed, including 10 obligate autotrophs. Linkage between trpE/G
and cbbE and/or cbbZ was found in all sequenced obligate autotrophs, all of which belong to the b- or

g-proteobacteria divisions (Figure 4, Table 4), whereas
only 4 out of 14 facultative heterotrophs were detected
with this clustering. These four exceptions are found
only in the b- or g-proteobacteria and none in the aproteobacterial division (Figure 4, Table 4). This suggests a previously unreported linkage between genes
encoding CBB cycle associated enzymes and trpEG or
trpE that is most conserved in obligate autotrophs of
the b- and g-proteobacteria.
We hypothesize that in A. ferrooxidans production of
pyruvate via anthranilate synthase activity provides a
novel network connection between the CBB cycle on the
one hand and general central carbon metabolism including the incomplete ("horseshoe"-like) TCA [2] on the
other hand. Consistent with this idea is the presence of a
predicted pykA upstream of trpEG in the cbb3 operon.
PykA is predicted to encode pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to
pyruvate. In addition to supplying pyruvate, PykA could
also reduce the level of intracellular PEP. PEP has been
shown to be a ligand of CbbR in Ralstonia eutropha H16,
promoting its binding to target DNA sites and consequently effecting the regulation of cbb genes [40]. If PEP
carries out a similar function in A. ferrooxidans, the
depletion of PEP via PykA activity could provide a means
for feedback control of operons that are regulated by
CbbR, including the auto-regulation of operon cbb3.
The organization of cbb genes in A. ferrooxidans exhibits
similarities with obligate autotrophs that distinguish this
group from facultative autotrophs. For example, A. ferrooxidans, contains three or more gene clusters dedicated to
carbon assimilation. This is similar to other obligate autotrophic g-proteobacteria including A. caldus, A. thiooxidans, Hydrogenovibrio marinus, Nitrosococcus oceani and
Thiomicrospira crunogena, and obligate autotrophic b-proteobacteria such as Nitrosomonas europaea, Nitrosomonas
eutropha, and Nitrosospira multiformis and Thiobacillus
denitrificans. This contrasts with facultative autotrophs
that contain only one or two cbb clusters (Figure 4, Table
4), with some exceptions, e.g. the a-proteobacteria Bradyrhizobium sp., N. hamburgensis, N. winogradski. R. sphaeroides and R. palustris and the b-proteobacterium R.
eutropha, which contain unique, but duplicated, cbb clusters). Multiple cbb clusters could provide obligate autotrophs with a greater flexibility in regulating CO2 fixation
compared to facultative autotrophs. For example, this flexibility may be necessary to adjust carbon assimilation in
response to changing environmental concentrations of
CO2 [18], whereas facultative autotrophs might be able to
circumvent this need by exploiting organic carbon sources
in times of low CO2 concentrations.
Another characteristic of cbb gene organization in
A. ferrooxidans is the lack of linkage of the phosphoribulokinsae gene, cbbP, with other cbb genes (Figure 4, Table 4)

Page 10 of 15

as has previously been reported for the deep-sea vent obligate chemolithoautotroph T. crunogena XCL-2 and for
several other obligate autotrophs [20,41]; we now extend
this list to include A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 and
ATCC 53993, A. caldus, A. thiooxidans H. marinus, N.
europaea and Thiomicrospira crunogena (Figure 4, Table
4). In contrast, in all sequenced facultative autotrophs
cbbP is associated with other cbb genes (Figure 4, Table 4).
In obligate autotrophs, the contextual disconnection of
cbbP from cbbLS could provide greater flexibility for CO2
fixation by allowing RubisCO to be differentially expressed
according to environmental and/or metabolic requirements without simultaneously expressing the remaining
CBB cycle genes, many of which carry out functions in
addition to carbon fixation. This is in sharp contrast to the
organization found in most facultative autotrophs, where
cbbP is usually juxtaposed to cbbLS and other genes of the
CBB cycle facilitating their coordinate repression during
heterotrophic growth [13,20,34,36,41].
Model for predicted enzymes and pathways involved in
CO2 fixation

A model is proposed for C i fixation in A. ferrooxidans
based on the predicted roles of the genes encoded in the
cbb operons (Figure 5). In contrast to most facultative
autotrophs, the main focus of regulation of the CBB cycle
in A. ferrooxidans may be the CO2 fixation reaction itself
catalyzed by RubisCO, rather than at the level of the other
CBB cycle enzymes. This hypothesis is supported by the
observation that the genes encoding RubisCO and RubisCo
accessory proteins, are clustered in operons that do not
contain cbbP nor cbb that encode the main CBB enzymes.
cbbP is also separated from the rest of the cbb genes in the
cbb4 operon, with an apparent absence of CbbR binding to
its promoter. We suggest that the promoters for the cbb1,
cbb2 and cbb3 operons have different affinities for CbbR
and may thus exhibit different regulation patterns, possibly
associated with the environmental availability of CO2. The
cbb1 operon, containing cbbLS-cso, is predicted to serve at
low CO2 concentrations because carboxysomes have been
shown to improve RubisCO catalytic efficiency by concentrating CO2 [6,13]. In contrast, the cbb2 operon, containing
cbbLSQO, is predicted to be used when higher concentrations of CO2 are available since carboxysome synthesis is
energetically and materially expensive [18].
The cbb3 operon, containing genes for most CBB
cycle enzymes and pyruvate kinase, is proposed to be
responsible for connecting CO2 fixation with the rest of
central carbon metabolism. Except for cbbG and cbbK
encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
type I and phosphoglycerate kinase respectively, genes
of the cbb3 operon have duplicated copies in the genome (data not shown), potentially allowing regulation of
the CBB cycle independently of the remaining pathways

detected in A. ferrooxidans (43). 1Two copies of cbbR and two cbb gene clusters are present on two plasmids; 2two highly similar operons present in the genome;

in these organisms, trpE gene is neighbor to cbbP but not cbbE. 4 R. eutropha H16 posesses a duplicated cbb operon, with similar copies in the chromosome and

of central carbon metabolism. For example, some CBB
cycle intermediates also form part of gluconeogenesis
and glycolysis resulting in the production of pyruvate
that is channeled, via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, into the incomplete TCA “horseshoe” where the
flux of intermediates serves for amino acid biosynthesis
(e.g. glutamate). The pyruvate dehydrogenase also provides acetyl-CoA used in fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, the presence of cbbZ in the cbb3 operon is
associated with phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity,
responsible for removal of phosphoglycolate, an undesirable product of the oxygenase activity of RubisCO, that
must be detoxified preferentially by rechanneling to
3-phosphoglycerate [13,36].

The co-transcriptional connection between the cbb,
pykA and trpEG genes in the cbb3 operon may reflect the
substrate requirement of anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase for an activated pentose (5-phosphoribosyl 1pyrophosphate) in order to proceed to the next step of
tryptophan biosynthesis [42]. The production of the activated pentose would be stimulated by the activity of the
operon. An alternate hypothesis is that the co-transcriptional connection represents a means for pyruvate regeneration since both pykA and trpE/G produce pyruvate.
In addition to the four cbb operons described herein, a
fifth gene cluster has recently been detected in A. ferrooxidans that includes genes cbbM, cbbQ3 and cbbO3
predicted to encode form II of RubisCO and its

contains another putative cbbR divergently transcribed
from cbbMQO. Future work will evaluate the role of
this cluster in CO2 fixation.

including the operator, the operon promoter (pcbbL) and the promoter
cbbR (pcbbR). The CbbR regulator bind to region R (recognition site) and
the region A (activation site) of the cbb operator. The nucleotides
conserved (TNA-N7/8-TNA, T-N11-A) for to bind CbbR are located in
intergenic regions RI-1, RI-2 and RI-3. The prediction of the promoter and
the sites for to bind s70 are in the columns (sequences -35 and -10).
