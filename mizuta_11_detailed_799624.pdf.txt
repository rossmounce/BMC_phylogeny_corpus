Abstract
Background: Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) causes various acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of HPIV1 is a major antigen. However, the molecular epidemiology
and genetic characteristics of such ARI are not exactly known. Recent studies suggested that a phylogenetic
analysis tool, namely the maximum likelihood (ML) method, may be applied to estimate the evolutionary time
scale of various viruses. Thus, we conducted detailed genetic analyses including homology analysis, phylogenetic
analysis (using both the neighbor joining (NJ) and ML methods), and analysis of the pairwise distances of HN gene
in HPIV1 isolated from patients with ARI in Yamagata prefecture, Japan.
Results: A few substitutions of nucleotides in the second binding site of HN gene were observed among the
present isolates. The strains were classified into two major clusters in the phylogenetic tree by the NJ method.
Another phylogenetic tree constructed by the ML method showed that the strains diversified in the late 1980s. No
positively selected sites were found in the present strains. Moreover, the pairwise distance among the present
isolates was relatively short.
Conclusions: The evolution of HN gene in the present HPIV1 isolates was relatively slow. The ML method may be
a useful phylogenetic method to estimate the evolutionary time scale of HPIV and other viruses.

Background
Human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) of the genus
Respirovirus and family Paramyxoviridae causes various
acute respiratory infections (ARI) including the common
cold, croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [1]. Epidemiological data suggest that HPIV types 1-4 mainly infect
younger children at least once, although reinfections
may occur in adults [2,3]. Indeed, serological surveys
indicate that at least 75% of children have been infected

with HPIV1 by 5 years of age [4,5]. HPIV1 and 3 show
high prevalence and are associated with up to 12% of
acute lower respiratory tract infections in adults [6].
Thus, HPIVs, including HPIV1, may be major agents of
ARI throughout the world [7-9].
HPIV possess two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein and fusion
protein (F protein) [1]. HN glycoprotein shows multiple
biological functions that include hemagglutinin and
enzymatic activities as neuraminidase [3,10]. As a result,
this molecule regulates viral adsorption and entry, and
regulates the release of progeny virions from the
infected cell surface [3]. In addition, it is suggested that

HN glycoprotein is a major antigen [1]. The detailed
molecular characteristics of HN glycoprotein have been
confirmed in HPIV3, while those in HPIV1 remain
unclear [11]. In addition, the genetic characteristics of
HPIV1 are poorly understood. Thus, it is important to
analyze the HN coding region in HPIV1.
The neighbor joining (NJ) method is frequently used
in phylogenetic analysis to examine the molecular epidemiology of various viral genomes [12,13]. This method
is based on a cluster classification algorithm, enabling
the analysis of clusters and of the rate of viral evolution.
Furthermore, the maximum likelihood (ML) method
enables an estimation of the evolutionary time scale
[14]. Using these methods, we conducted a detailed
genetic analysis of the HN coding region in HPIV1 isolates from patients with ARI in Yamagata prefecture,
Japan.

Methods
Patients and isolation of HPIV1

A total of 182 throat and nasal swab specimens were
collected from patients attending pediatric clinics in
Yamagata prefecture from May 2002 to November 2009.
Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all
subjects for the donation of samples used in this study.
All patients were aged from 0 to 43 years (4.1 ± 5.0
years; mean ± SD). Patients were mainly diagnosed with
upper respiratory illness (URI) and wheezy bronchiolitis
(Additional file 1: Table S1). URI is also known as the
common cold and typically affects the upper airways,
including the nose (sinusitis), throat (pharyngitis), and
larynx (laryngitis) [15]. Wheezy bronchiolitis was
defined as the presence of wheezing alone or chest
retractions in association with URI [16].
Cell culture and virus isolation

In this study, human embryonic lung fibroblast (HEF),
human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2), African green
monkey kidney (Vero E6), Madin Darby canine kidney
(MDCK), rhabdomyosarcoma (RD-18S), green monkey
kidney (GMK), and human melanoma (HMV-II) cell
lines were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium (Nissui No.3; Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) containing 5-10% fetal bovine serum or
calf serum at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 [17]. Each cell line was prepared in 96-well tissue
culture plates (Greiner Bio-One, GmbH, Frickenhausen,
Germany). We inoculated the throat and nasal swabs
from patients onto the plates and incubated them at 33°
C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The cytopathic effects (CPEs) in the cells were observed 2-3
times per week. We harvested the culture supernatant
when a suspected HPIV CPE was observed or a

Page 2 of 9

hemadsorption (HAD) test with 0.8% guinea pig erythrocytes was positive, and stored it at -80°C until
analysis.
RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing

Viral RNA of HPIV1 isolates was extracted from 200 μL
of the viral culture fluid by using ISOGEN (Nippon
Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and was then transcribed into
cDNA with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Nippon
Gene) and a random primer (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu,
Japan). Reverse transcription was carried out at 30°C for
10 min, followed by incubation at 37°C for 45 min, and
then incubation at 95°C for 5 min. To amplify the HN
coding region in HPIV1 gene (nucleotide position 72458477, 1233 nt) by RT-PCR, we designed new primer sets
using Primer Express (R) version 1.5 software (Applied
Biosystems LLC, Foster City, CA) [18]. Primer
sequences were as follows: first primer pair, 5’- CAG
AAT TAA TCA GAC AAG AAG TRA TAT CAA G -3’
(primer HPIV-1USF, position 7165-7195), and 5’- TGA
TAC GRA TTA AGA CAT TGA CAA CTT G -3’ (primer HPIV-1USR, position 8034-8061); and second primer pair, 5’- CRA GTS RAG GWA TAG RAG AYT
TAG TAT TTG -3’(primer HPIV-1DSF, position 77507779) and 5’- GGT TRA TTT CAA CAA TRT GGA
AGC AGT A -3’ (primer HPIV-1DSR, position 85298556). Nucleotide position was based on the sequence
of HN glycoprotein genome in HPIV1 (Mil-48/91, GenBank accession no. U70936). Using cDNA solution, a
DNA fragment of 1392 bp was amplified by PCR. Forty
amplification cycles were performed at 94°C for 30 s, at
55°C for 30 s, at 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. We analyzed the nucleotide sequences (1233b; located at 398-1633 within the
HN gene) of the HN coding region. Briefly, the DNA
fragment was purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), submitted to a cycle
sequence with a Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) using
the two primer sets stated above, and purified with a
spin column (AutoSeq G-50, Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ). The nucleotide sequence was determined with an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM
3130 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA).
Phylogenetic analysis and calculation of pairwise
distances by the NJ method

Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the
HN coding region of HPIV1 was conducted with the
CLUSTAL W program available from the DNA Data
Bank of Japan http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-j.html,
and Tree Explorer version 2.12 [19].

Mizuta et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:533
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/533

Evolutionary distances were estimated according to
Kimura’s 2-parameter method, and the phylogenetic tree
was constructed with the NJ method. The reliability of
the tree was estimated with 1000 bootstrap replications.
We used reference strains in this study to construct the
phylogenetic tree. In addition, we calculated the pairwise
distances for all strains, including the present isolates
and reference strains to assess the frequency distribution
among all HPIV1 strains and that of each intercluster of
HPIV1, as previously described [20]. The GenBank
accession numbers of the nucleotide sequences obtained
in the present study are AB641132 to AB641313.
To evaluate the action of selective pressure on the HN
coding regions among all HPIV1 strains, we estimated
the rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous
(dN) changes at amino acid sites by conservative single
likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) and the fixed
effects likelihood (FEL) method using ML available on
the Datamonkey webserver http://www.datamonkey.org/
[21]. The SLAC method is suitable for fast likelihoodbased “counting methods” that employ either a single
most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighted across all
possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from
ancestral reconstructions. The FEL method directly estimates dN and dS substitution rates at each site. These
methods were performed to examine the dN and dS
rates, incorporating the General Time Reversible (GTR)
model of nucleotide substitution and the phylogenetic
tree inferred using the NJ method. Positive (dN > dS)
and negative (dN < dS) selections were predicted using
these models. The p-value was used to classify a site as
positively or negatively selected by these methods.
Phylogenetic analysis and estimation of time scale by the
ML method

To construct the phylogenetic tree by the ML method,
which is the best nucleotide substitution model, the
GTR with gamma distributed rates across sites (GTR +
Γ) [22,23] was selected by the KAKUSAN4 program version 4.0. Supplementary materials related to this program can be found online at doi:10.1111/j.17550998.2011.03021.x. In this study, we used three phylogenetic models of sequence evolution. One is the different
rate (DR) model [14], the most general, which assumes
each branch of the unrooted phylogenetic tree has a different substitution rate [24]. The DR model is used as
suitable general model against which to test the assumption of constant rates of the fit of the single rate (SR)
and the single rate dated tips (SRDT) models [25]. Phylogenetic analysis of ML based on the DR model was
constructed with RAxML BlackBox webserver http://
phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/index.php. All the present strains with more than 99.5% sequence similarity to
any other strain were excluded from analysis. The

Page 3 of 9

reliability of the phylogenetic hypothesis was assessed
using bootstrap analysis of 100 ML iterations. The SR
model assumes the same rate of evolution in all
branches (i.e., a molecular clock), and the SRDT model
is an SR model that relaxes the assumption of contemporaneous sequences and uses the date of isolation of
each sequence to estimate the substitution rate [24]. To
estimate the rate of molecular evolution (and hence a
time scale) for a phylogeny consisting of date tips, phylogenetic analyses by ML based on the SR and SRDT
models were performed using the TipDate webserver
http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py?#forms::tipdate
[24]. The likelihood of the SR and SRDT models (with
likelihood L0) were compared to that of the DR model
(with likelihood L1) in a likelihood ratio test (LRT) [14]
of the fit of the model. The test statistic is the difference
in the log likelihood (Δ) between the SR or SRDT model
and the DR model. In the LRT statistic, twice the ratio
of log likelihoods (L1/L0) (2Δ*) is expected to be c2 distributed with degrees of freedom equal to their models.
The DR model has 2n-3 free parameters, the SR model
has n-1, and the SRDT model has n-2 (a tree of n tips).
In the LRT of the fit of the SR and SRDT models compared with the DR, if the SR model is rejected in favor
of the DR model but the SRDT model is not, the SRDT
model can be accepted as no worse a description of the
evolution date than the DR model. A P value of ≥0.05
was considered statistically significant for the phylogenetic models. The resulting phylogenetic trees were
described using TreeExplorer version 2.12. The rates of
nucleotide substitution, the date estimating the root of
the tree and the corresponding upper and lower 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated under the
SRDT model using the TipDate webserver.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the
HN coding region in HPIV1 by the NJ method

The partial nucleotide sequences (1233 nt) of HN glycoprotein gene in a total of 182 isolates and 3 reference
strains were analyzed. The phylogenetic tree based on
the nucleotide sequences by the NJ method is shown in
Figure 1. The enlarged cluster shows the HPIV1 strains.
The phylogenetic tree containing the isolated and reference strains was classified into two unique clusters with
the exception of three Yamagata strains (HPIVi/Yamagata/2002/1433, HPIVi/Yamagata/2002/1565, and
HPIVi/Yamagata/2003/1122), clusters 1 and 2, and these
strains were classified into different clusters from the
reference strains. The number of detected strains in
each cluster on the phylogenetic tree was as follows:
cluster 1, 84 strains including strains isolated during
2004-2009; and cluster 2, 95 strains from 2003 to 2005,
and 2007 to 2009.

Likelihood ratio test (LRT) of the fit of the models and
timescale evolution of the HN coding region in HPIV1 by
the ML method

Based on the SRDT model [24,26], we constructed
another phylogenetic tree consisting of dated tips by
using the nucleotide sequences of the HPIV1 HN coding
region of 43 isolated strains from patients in Yamagata
prefecture and 3 reference strains by using the ML
method. As a result, the SR model was rejected as an
adequate description of the evolution of the HPIV1 HN
coding region (p < 0.05). Therefore, the SRDT model
was not significantly worse than the DR model, indicating that this model adequately describes the substitution
process (p = 0.06). Through these processes, we
obtained a phylogenetic tree by the ML method. The
year of the first major division in the present tree was
estimated at 1950 (Figure 2; 95% CIs of 1935 to 1955).
In addition, the ancestral strains of the present strains
subdivided around 1987. Further division occurred
around 1989, resulting in the formation of two major
clusters (clusters 1 and 2). Furthermore, we estimated
the rate of molecular evolution from the tree as 7.68 ×
10-4 substitutions per site per year (95% CIs of 4.80 ×
10-4 to 1.07 × 10-3).
Analysis of pairwise distances, substitutions of the second
binding site, and selective pressure of the HN coding
region in HPIV1

The nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities
among all 182 isolates were high at 92.6-100% and 96.0100%, respectively. In addition, we calculated the intercluster distances of HPIV1 from the distribution of the
pairwise distances. Based on the nucleotide sequences,
the pairwise distance was 0.018 ± 0.013 [mean ± SD,
Figure 3a] for the 182 present and 3 reference strains.
The pairwise intercluster distances were as follows: cluster 1, 0.003 ± 0.002 (Figure 3b); and cluster 2, 0.008 ±
0.005 (Figure 3c). Cluster 2 showed a large pairwise
intercluster distance, whereas that for cluster 1 was
small. However, irregular peaks of pairwise distance are
seen in Figure 3, and we were not able to genotyping
the present strains based on the pairwise distance value.
Next, amino acid substitutions in the analyzed HN coding region in the present strains were found at 31sites
(detailed substitution data not shown). Among these
was an essential substitution of the second binding site,
N523S. This substitution (N523S) was seen in seven of
the present strains (HPIVi/Yamagata/2007/1577, HPIVi/
Yamagata/2007/1599, HPIVi/Yamagata/2007/2211,
HPIVi/Yamagata/2007/2072, HPIVi/Yamagata/2007/
2354, HPIVi/Yamagata/2007/2274, and HPIVi/Yamagata/2008/413). These strains belonged in cluster 2 (Figure 1).

Selection pressure analysis was performed in the present strains, and the results showed a low mean dN/dS
ratio (0.17) (95% likelihood profile-based CIs, CI = 0.130.23) by the SLAC method. Thus, the nucleotide substitutions predicted were largely synonymous. The dN/dS
ratios of the individual sites in the HN coding region
were calculated by the SLAC and FEL methods significant at the p < 0.1 level. However, neither method
detected a positively selected site.

Discussion
In this study, we performed a detailed genetic analysis of
HN glycoprotein gene in HPIV1 isolates from patients
with ARI during 2002-2009 in Yamagata prefecture,
Japan. The phylogenetic tree constructed by the NJ
method showed that the present HPIV1 isolates were
divisible into two major genetic clusters (Figure 1). The
other tree constructed by the ML method showed that
the year of the first major division was estimated at
1950, and the ancestral strains further subdivided at
around 1987, resulting in three clusters (one minor and
two major, Figure 2). The strains belonging to the two
major clusters subdivided into many clusters after 2000.
The present HPIV1 isolates showed an overall high level
of nucleotide sequence identity (92.6-100%) of the HN
coding region. Pairwise distance values based on the
nucleotide sequences among the present strains were
relatively low (less than 0.06). In addition, there were no
positively selected sites found. These results suggest that
several lineages of highly conserved HN gene in HPIV1
were prevalent in Yamagata prefecture. The present
strains could not be provisionally type assigned from the
pairwise distance values. Thus, the accumulation of
large amounts of data may be needed to genotype
HPIV1 based on pairwise distance.
Homology and phylogenetic analysis by the NJ
method is frequently used in molecular epidemiological
studies of various viruses. Homology analysis based on
nucleotide sequences mainly shows the similarities of
the analyzed genes among the strains. Phylogenetic analysis by the NJ method can give an estimation of the
viral evolution rate and cluster classification. Furthermore, the ML method can enable analysis of the time
scale of the evolution of viral genes. In the present
study, we were able to estimate the viral evolution rate
of HPIV1, cluster classification, and the evolutionary
time scale of the present isolates by applying the NJ and
ML methods to the detailed phylogenetic analysis of the
HN coding region in HPIV1. There is currently little
information available regarding the molecular evolution
of the HN coding region in HPIV (HPIV1 to 4).
Furthermore, the rate of molecular evolution is very low
(7.68 × 10 -4 substitutions/site/year) in the present

strains. Previous reports suggest that the rate of another
gene of respiratory viruses belonging to Paramyxoviridae, such as respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, is higher
(1.8 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year) than that of the present data [27]. The reason for the difference is unknown
at present. However, it is possible that genome properties other than size, such as polarity or structure, may
be associated with substitutions of the viral genome
[27]. Further studies on the detailed mechanisms of viral
genome substitution may be needed. Additional
sequence data and further structural analysis are
required to demonstrate the mechanisms of the molecular evolution of HPIV1.
HPIV is classified into four serotypes (HPIV1 to 4), all of
which can cause various ARI in humans, such as URI,
croup, bronchitis, and pneumonia [1]. Previous reports
suggest that HPIV1 and 3 are the dominant viruses in children with ARI [28]. In addition, HPIV is a major causative
agent of virus-induced asthma [29]. Thus, HPIV1 is a

major agent of ARI, along with other viruses, such as adenovirus, RS virus, human metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus [30]. However, the molecular epidemiology of HPIVs
is poorly understood, and only a few reports on the molecular epidemiology of HPIV1 are available. For example,
Henrickson and Savatski analyzed the longitudinal evolution of the HN coding region in 13 strains of HPIV1 isolated in the United States [31]. The results showed that
the antigenic and genetic subgroups are very stable.
Another report suggested that two distinct genotypes of
HPIV were detected during the 1991 Milwaukee epidemic
[32]. In the present study, we used HPIV1 isolates from
patients with ARI and studied the evolution of HN protein, based on phylogenetic analyses using both the ML
and NJ methods and the rate of the substitutions of
nucleotides. The results showed that HN protein is highly
conserved. In addition, no positively selected sites were
detected. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of
these findings in HPIV1.

The distribution of amino acids affects the structure of
the HN coding region in HPIV1, and previous reports
show that substitutions of amino acids in HN glycoprotein reveal second receptor binding sites [33,34]. For
example, substitutions at Asn173 and Asn523 are critical
for the formation of a second binding site. In particular,
these substitutions affect, for example, the inhibitor in
hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and infection of
culture cells. However, the second receptor binding site
did not significantly affect the growth or fusion activity
of HPIV1. Substitutions at N523S were found in seven
of the present strains, but there were no substitutions at
Asn173. Thus, we thought that N523S may not be significantly associated with infectivity or pathogenicity.
Furthermore, we then examined selective pressure by
counting and the ML method. Analysis of selection
pressure in the present strains showed that dS substitutions predominated over dN substitutions, and no positively selected sites (substitution) were found in HN
protein in the present HPIV1 strains. The evolution of
the present strains may be largely driven by purifying
selection. Compared with HPIV3, little is known about
the detailed biological properties of HN glycoprotein in
HPIV1. As an essential molecule of these viruses, further
analysis of the biological properties of HN glycoprotein
in HPIV1 is required [35].
Although detailed data of the antigenic and catalytic
sites of HN molecules in HPIV3 is relatively clear [36],
such information regarding HPIV1 is not yet known.
Moreover, the epidemiology and molecular epidemiology of HPIV is not exactly known. Thus, further and
larger epidemiological/molecular epidemiological studies
are required to give better understanding of the etiology
of HPIVs, including HPIV1.

Conclusions
Our study suggested that several prevalent lineages of
HN gene are highly conserved and evolution occurred
from the late 1980s in HPIV1 in Yamagata prefecture.
Viral evolution was estimated by detailed phylogenetic
analyses using the NJ and ML methods. These methods
offer a new understanding of the genetic evolution of
HN gene.
