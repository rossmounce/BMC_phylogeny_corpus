Abstract
Background: Normalization is a prerequisite for accurate real time PCR (qPCR) expression
analysis and for the validation of microarray profiling data in microbial systems. The choice and use
of reference genes that are stably expressed across samples, experimental conditions and designs
is a key consideration for the accurate interpretation of gene expression data.
Results: Here, we evaluate a carefully selected set of reference genes derived from previous
microarray-based transcriptional profiling experiments performed on Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
and identify a set of genes with minimal variability under five different experimental conditions that
are frequently used in Acidithiobacilli research. Suitability of these and other previously reported
reference genes to monitor the expression of four selected target genes from A. ferrooxidans grown
with different energy sources was investigated. Utilization of reference genes map, rpoC, alaS and
era results in improved interpretation of gene expression profiles in A. ferrooxidans.
Conclusion: This investigation provides a validated set of reference genes for studying A.
ferrooxidans gene expression under typical biological conditions and an initial point of departure for
exploring new experimental setups in this microorganism and eventually in other closely related
Acidithiobacilli. The information could also be of value for future transcriptomic experiments in
other bacterial systems.

Background
Gene expression interrogation, both at single-gene (classical gene expression analysis) and genome-wide (global
transcriptome analysis) levels, are prominent fields of
study. By providing quantitative measures of mRNA
changes, it has the extraordinary potential of identifying

the functional consequences of genetic variability and
environmental influence. Accurate quantification of gene
expression is providing great insight into the physiology
and metabolic complexity of microbes and their consortia
and is thus contributing to our understanding of both
fundamental and applied issues of major interest.

Microarray transcript profiling is the most widely used
technique to evaluate global gene expression in microbial
systems. However, due to methodological uncertainties
inherent to the technique, it is imperative to validate the
expression of key genes by an alternative procedure and
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become the
method of choice. qPCR is accurate, exhibits a broad
dynamic range, and is sensitive and reproducible [1-6].
However, when performing qPCR, several parameters
need to be controlled in order to obtain accurate and reliable expression measurements; these include variations in
the amounts of starting material between samples, RNA
extraction efficiency, RNA integrity/quality, efficiency of
cDNA synthesis, and differences in the overall transcriptional activity of the cells analyzed [7].
The most frequently used strategy to control for such variations is relative normalization, where the expression of
a target gene is measured with respect to total RNA, rRNA
or a stably expressed internal reference gene. The use of
rRNA or other reference gene has the advantage that their
expression permits normalization against the cumulative
errors of the entire process [8]. Ideally, the reference gene
should be universally valid, expressed stably and at a similar level across all samples, cells, experimental treatments, and designs. Unfortunately, no such reference
gene has been identified [9-12] and even widely used control genes have proven unsuitable in certain situations
[6,13,14].
Housekeeping genes are usually chosen as reference genes
both in eukaryotes [15] and prokaryotes [16] because they
are assumed: a) to be essential, b) to be ubiquitous, c) not
to be regulated or influenced by the experimental procedure and d) to be expressed at similar levels in different
types of cells. However, it is becoming increasingly clear
that some commonly chosen housekeeping genes vary
considerably across cell types, with time, or due to experimental treatment [13]. This may be explained partially by
the fact that some housekeeping proteins participate in
other functions as well as in basal cell metabolism [1719].
Therefore, for an accurate comparison of mRNA transcription in different samples, either validated reference genes
are required for normalization or new ones should be
determined empirically for each experimental system and
condition studied [20,21]. Here, we evaluate a carefully
selected set of reference genes for improving the interpretation of gene expression profiles in a model microorganism, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The implementation of
high-throughput microarray analyses of A. ferrooxidans
[22,23] and PCR techniques for expression profiling [2437], have greatly enhanced our understanding of the
genetic and physiological potential of this bioleaching

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/63

bacterium. However, suitable reference genes to evaluate
gene expression have not previously been identified in A.
ferrooxidans.
In order to address this lacuna, we screened high-density
oligonucleotide array-based expression profiles available
for A. ferrooxidans and identified a set of nine genes with
minimal variability under different experimental setups.
Quantitative real-time PCR was then used to determine
the mRNA levels of these genes, comparing their transcription in five different experimental conditions.
Finally, we evaluated the suitability of these and other previously reported reference genes to monitor the expression of four selected target genes from A. ferrooxidans
grown with different energy sources. This study defines
reference genes for normalization of gene expression for
future research, sparing other researchers in this and
related fields from cumbersome and time-consuming
screenings for an ideal reference gene, provided that they
verify the stability of these candidates under their conditions of study.

Results & Discussion
Selection of candidate reference genes
The most useful reference genes for standards in gene
expression studies should be stably expressed over a range
of experimental conditions and should be of wide phylogenetic distribution. Taking these requirements into
account, a combined computational and experimental
approach was devised to identify reference genes in the
Acidithiobacilli (Figure 1). The strategy involves the following steps:
1) A genome-wide bioinformatic identification of candidate reference
genes
An initial set of candidate reference genes was compiled from
a gene list that includes "housekeeping genes" of wide phylogenetic distribution [38]. This set was used to textmine the
A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ
accession number CP001219) [39]. Due to difference in
ontological descriptions of gene function, not all genes could
be recovered by textmining and additional candidates were
identified in the A. ferrooxidans genome by BLASTP and
TBLASTX searches using the housekeeping genes as queries.
The combined set of candidate reference genes was then used
to formulate bidirectional BLASTP and TBLASTX searches of
the genomes of A. thiooxidans and A. caldus. This search for
well conserved orthologs across Acidithiobacilli was performed in order to better define the set of essential genes for
this bacterial genus. Such an approach will promote the ability to carry out future comparative gene expression studies
within the Acidithiobacilli. Only genes present in all three
genomes were accepted and provided the initial bioinformatic compilation of candidate reference genes (Additional
File 1).

2) The selection of stably expressed candidate reference genes for A.
ferrooxidans
The expression profiles for the set of candidate reference
genes was then evaluated in three different growth conditions of A. ferrooxidans (iron, pH 1.6 vs. sulfur, pH 3.5,
iron-sulfur mixture, pH 1.6 vs. sulfur, pH 1.6 and high
iron, pH 1.6 vs. low iron, pH 1.6; see Methods for more
details). Candidate reference genes that exhibited non-differential expression (log ratio expression |M| < 1.5) and
had the most similar level of expression (log ratio expression M~0) between every pair of conditions in all three
experiments were further selected (Additional file 2).
3) Removal of redundant candidate reference genes
The genetic context of these candidate reference genes in
the genome of A. ferrooxidans was evaluated using the
DNA sequence viewer and annotation tool Artemis v.10
[40]. In the case where more than one candidate gene
belonged to the same operon or gene cluster, only one
gene was selected for further experimental validation.
Also, only one candidate was chosen from genes belonging to the same functional category as defined by
TIGRfams [41]. This reduced redundancy in the set.

4) Evaluation of the expression profiles of the candidate reference
genes by real time PCR
The expression of these selected candidate reference genes
was analyzed by quantitative PCR in order to evaluate if
the stability of expression observed in microarray experiments was supported by more sensitive and rigorous evaluation methods. Transcriptional levels were compared by
assessing Ct values of each gene for two of the former
experimental conditions (iron pH 1.6 and sulfur pH 3.5)
and three new ones (sulfur pH 2.5, sulfur pH 4.5 and thiosulfate pH 4.5, see Methods for further detail). These
conditions are frequently used in the laboratory to study
the biology of Acidthiobacilli because they simulate environmental conditions. Expression values (Ct) of the
selected reference genes and their dispersion are plotted in
Additional file 3.

The combined bioinformatics and experimental strategy
identified nine candidate reference genes (coaE, era, gmk,
gyrA, map, nth, rplI, rpoC, trpS).
Expression stability of candidate reference genes

described above by the methods of Vandesompele and
Andersen as implemented in the Visual Basic Application
geNorm [11] and Visual Basic Application NormFinder
[7], respectively (Table 1). According to geNorm (which
determines a gene expression stability value M to produce
a rank where the best genes are those with the lowest M
value) map, rpoC, era and gmk showed the least variability
in expression in all conditions evaluated (range of expression of 1.029, 1.040, 1.046 and 1.067 fold respectively).
The NormFinder approach (which enables identification
of the single best genes in a ranking) showed era to be the
most stable gene and rpoC and gmk to rank within the four
most stably expressed genes. Slight differences observed
between the two techniques are to be expected and can be
explained by the way in which both methods analyze the
data. geNorm selects the gene with the most stable expression independent of the expression of the other genes
under analysis. NormFinder instead focuses on the genes
with least intra- and inter-group expression variation, thus
the selection of the best reference gene is affected by the
other genes being analyzed. Similar differences between
the results of geNorm and NormFinder have been
reported in other studies [42,43]. Taking into account the
results from both geNorm and NormFinder, we can conclude that rpoC and era are the most suitable reference
genes for studies with the Acidithiobacilli.
Expression stability of reference genes previously used in
studies of A. ferrooxidans
Three genes, recA, alaS and rrs (16S rRNA) have been used
in prior studies as internal controls for experimental
investigations in A. ferrooxidans [28,30,44,45], but there

has been no formal report showing that they are reliable
references. Conversely, there is evidence showing differential expression of recA and rrs under cellular stress [46]
and starvation [45,47]. In addition, use of rrs as a reference gene has been challenged because it is a very abundant species of RNA present at concentrations outside
most calibration ranges [16].
The expression of recA, alaS and rrs was analyzed under
the same experimental conditions and their expression
values were ranked with respect to the new reference genes
derived above using geNorm [11] and NormFinder [7]
(Table 2). The variability in expression of rrs and alaS in
five different experimental setups shows them to perform
well although slightly poorer than rpoC, era and map (Figure 2). Both geNorm and NormFinder identified rrs and
alaS among the six more stable genes. On the contrary,
recA ranks further down, indicating less stable expression,
independently of the ranking method used (Table 2). In
addition, the expression of recA varies more than two fold,
and together with coaE and trpS exhibits the least suitable
expression profile of the genes assessed in this study (Figure 2).
It can be concluded that, among the previously used reference genes in A. ferrooxidans, only alaS is suitable and can
be used with confidence as a normalizer. Given the variability observed in the present study, use of recA as a normalizer is not recommended as it would introduce noise
to the analysis and eventually produce misleading results.
In addition, use of rrs as a reference gene is not recommended despite its stable expression in the five conditions

analyzed because its abundance prejudices the analysis of
lowly abundant transcripts.
Use of multiple reference genes for improved
normalization
Normalizing gene expression based upon the expression
levels of a carefully selected set of reference genes, usually
referred to as a normalization factor, performs better than
normalizing against any single gene alone [11]. This raises
the question as to whether a compromise could be discovered in which a pool of genes, fewer than nine but more
than one, would provide greater confidence for use as a
reference group in A. ferrooxidans. For this purpose, several
normalization factors (NF) were calculated following the
criteria defined by Vandesompele et al. [11]. A NF represents the geometric mean of n genes, and the pairwise variation between sequential normalization factors (NFn and
NFn+1) gives an idea of how well each of these perform.
Geometric means for seven of most stable genes, showing
less than 1.5 fold variation in all experimental conditions
(map, rpoC, alaS, era, gyrA and nth) were obtained and
pairwise variations between any two subsequent values
was calculated. As shown in Figure 3, addition of a fourth
gene leads to a non-significant change in the average of

the gene variance estimates. According to geNorm ranking, it is concluded that the NF derived from the pool of
the three genes map, rpoC and alaS (NF1) is suitable for
reliable normalization of gene expression of target genes.
In spite of this we posit that era, which ranked first accord-

ing to the Normfinder method, could also be included in
the selected reference gene set.
Use of selected reference genes to normalize expression of
differentially expressed genes in Fe-S cells
To assess the value of our study, the relative expression
levels of selected target genes was analyzed using the following normalization strategies: a) the three best reference genes selected by geNorm and Normfinder rpoC, era
and alaS were used individually, b) a NF derived from the
combination of the three genes selected by geNorm, rpoC,
map and alaS (NF1), c) a NF derived from the combination
of the top ranking genes selected by geNorm and
Normfinder method rpoC, map and era (NF2) or d) the frequently cited reference genes rrs and recA. For this purpose, four target genes were selected that are known to be
differentially expressed in A. ferrooxidans cultures: a) sdrAI
(AFE0007) is 95 fold induced in iron [34], b) cyoB
(AFE2407) is 12 fold induced in sulfur [22], c) cbbOIa
(AFE1408) is 3 fold induced in iron [23] and d) mntH
(AFE2920) is 24 fold induced in sulfur (unpublished
results).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/63

Expression of the four genes of interest in iron versus sulfur grown cells was evaluated using the relative expression
analysis software qBase v1.3.5 [48]. Figure 4 shows a significant increase in the expression of the sdrA1 and cbbOIa
genes in cells grown in ferrous iron and of the cyoB and
mntH genes in cells grown in sulfur. In all cases, normalization by individual reference genes outlined here (rpoC,
era or alaS), by the geNorm derived NF1 (rpoC plus map
plus alaS), by the combined NF2 (rpoC plus map plus era)
and by rrs gave similar results. For example, sdrA1 was upregulated 60–100 fold depending on whether the normalization strategy was a single stable reference gene or the
normalization factors. Conversely, normalization by the
recA gene dramatically altered the relative expression ratio
of the target gene, revealing an up-regulation of less than
50.
These results demonstrate how the interpretation of bacterial gene expression levels can be affected by the choice
of the reference genes in quantitative real-time RT-PCR
analysis. If a single gene is to be used, e.g. in studies where
only one or a few target genes are being evaluated, the reference gene should be one of the three validated stable ref-

erence genes rpoC, era or alaS. In investigations where a
larger number of target genes are to be evaluated or a
higher degree of confidence is desired, use of the NF
derived from the pool of the genes rpoC, map and alaS or
era is advisable.

Conclusion
Normalization is a prerequisite for accurate real time PCR
expression profiling. Significant random fluctuations or,
even worse, directional changes in the expression of chosen reference genes between samples, can lead to the lack
of detection of small differences between genes of interest
or to erroneous results. Therefore, it is extremely important to find appropriate reference genes with minimal variability. This cumbersome task is often avoided and
frequently priorly used reference genes are assumed to be
good normalizers without further evaluation in unexplored experimental setups.
The geometric mean of few carefully selected genes, rpoC,
map, alaS and/or era, is demonstrated to be the best normalizer for A. ferrooxidans in the diverse experimental conditions used in this study. Use of a single gene for
normalization, instead, may result in relatively large variations in target gene expression and significant errors
depending on the gene in question and the experimental
setup, as showed to be the case when using the recA gene.
Conversely, it is suggested that rpoC, era or alaS could be
used as normalizers if only one reference gene is strictly
necessary. Since ribosomal RNA is much more abundant
than most target mRNA transcripts and its quantification
falls outside most calibration ranges, the use of rrs is not
recommended especially for the measurements of low
abundance transcripts.
Whatever strategy is used to normalize for differences in
quality and quantity of input RNA it must be validated for
a particular experimental model on an individual basis.
This investigation provides a validated set of reference
genes for those studying A. ferrooxidans gene expression
under typical biological conditions and an initial point of
departure for those exploring new experimental setups in
this microorganism or other closely related Acidithiobacilli or possibly also in other bacterial models.

Methods
Bioinformatic selection of candidate reference genes

from a gene list that includes "housekeeping genes" of
wide phylogenetic distribution [38]. This set was used to
textmine the A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome (GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number CP001219) [39].
Additional candidates were identified in the A. ferrooxidans genome by BLASTP and TBLASTX searches. The com-

bined set of candidate genes was then used to formulate
bidirectional BLASTP and TBLASTX searches of the
genomes of A. thiooxidans and A. caldus. Genomic context
for genes present in all three genomes was analyzed using
the DNA sequence viewer and annotation tool Artemis
v.10 [40]. Candidate genes belonging to the same predicted operon or gene cluster were excluded from further
analysis. Reference genes were classified by function using
TIGRfams [41] and one gene per functional category was
selected. These last two steps were included to reduce
redundancy in the gene set.
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Gene expression was evaluated under the following experimental conditions: sulfur at pH 2.5, pH 3.5 and pH 4.5;
thiosulfate at pH 4.5 and ferrous iron 200 mM pH 1.6. A.
ferrooxidans strain ATCC 23270 was grown in modified 9
K basal salt media (0.7 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mM K2HPO4,
1.6 mM MgSO4.7H2O) containing iron (9 K + Fe: 200 mM
FeSO4; adjusted to pH 1.6 with H2SO4) or sulfur (9 K + S:
1% ethanol-sterilized powdered sulfur, adjusted to pH
2.5; 3.5 and 4.5 with H2SO4). DSMZ71 medium was used
for thiosulfate growth (20 mM Na2S2O3.5H2O, 22 mM
KH2PO4, 2 mM MgSO4.7H2O, 22 mM (NH4)2SO4 and 1.7
mM CaCl2.2H2O). All cultures were incubated at 30°C
under aerobic conditions on a rotary shaker at 150 r.p.m.
Cell collection
A. ferrooxidans cultures to be used for nucleic acid purification were harvested at 8000 r.p.m. for 10 min. The cell
pellet was washed in 9 K basal salt solution (adjusted at
the corresponding pH). Washed cells were collected by
centrifugation at 12000 r.p.m. for 10 min.
DNA isolation
A. ferrooxidans cultures were grown for 72 h until stationary phase. DNA isolation was carried out by phenol-chloroform extraction. Briefly, cells were collected and
resuspended in buffer TE (25:10) pH 8.0 with 5 mg/ml
lysozyme, and incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, followed by another hour of incubation at the same temperature with 1% SDS and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. Cell lysis
was completed by alternate shifting of the suspension
from 80°C to -80°C. DNA extraction was performed twice
with a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamylic alcohol
(25:24:1). Removal of the residual phenol was accomplished by one treatment with a mixture of chloroform:isoamylic alcohol (24:1). The DNA contained in the
final aqueous phase was precipitated overnight at -20°C
with absolute ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and
finally resuspended in sterilized water. Genomic DNA
quality and integrity were assessed by 1% (w/v) agarose
gel electrophoresis and standard PCR, and concentration
was determined by absorbance at 260 nm.

Total RNA isolation
RNA was isolated from A. ferrooxidans mid-logarithmic
cultures grown in modified 9 K basal salt medium in the
presence of iron 200 mM, sulfur (1%, pH 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5)
or 0.5% thiosulfate. Briefly, cells were collected and resuspended in ice-cold buffer TE (25:10) pH 8.0 with 1×
Extraction Buffer (per liter: 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.0, and 2 mM EDTA). Cell lysis was accomplished by
incubation at 100°C for 5 minutes. The suspension was
treated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and the recovered aqueous phase was treated with chloroform followed by two
extractions with acid phenol and chloroform. RNA was
precipitated with absolute ethanol overnight at -20°C,
washed with 70% ethanol, and finally resuspended in
sterilized water. Samples were treated with DNase and
purified with the Roche High Pure RNA Isolation Kit, following the manufacturer's recommendations and checked
for DNA contamination by standard PCR, including a
genomic DNA positive control. RNA quality was evaluated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis and its concentration was measured by absorbance at 260 nm.
Reverse transcription
cDNA was prepared from 1 mg total RNA using random
hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions. The resulting
cDNA was diluted 1:10 in distilled water and stored in
aliquots at -20°C until further use.
Real-time PCR
Primers for real-time PCR assays and amplification efficiencies (E) are shown in Table 3. The real-time PCR reactions were performed in the Mx3000P QPCR System
(Stratagene) using the SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix
Universal Kit (Invitrogen). The 20 ml PCR reactions contained 2 ml of a 1:100 diluted cDNA sample; 200 nM of
each primer and 1× SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix Universal (Invitrogen). The reference dye ROX was included
at a final concentration of 5 nM. The cycling protocol was
as follows: initial denaturation for 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 15 s at 52°C; 30 s at
72°C. Fluorescence was measured after the extension
phase at 72°C. The PCR products were subjected to a
melting curve analysis, that commenced at 52°C and
increased at 0.5°C s-1 up to 95°C, with a continuous fluorescent measurement. Specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in the melting curve. For each
experimental condition total RNA was extracted from two
independent A. ferrooxidans cultures. Each RNA sample
was retro-transcribed and the expression of all genes was
assessed on the same cDNA sample. The reactions for each
target gene were performed in triplicate and in the same
PCR run. Thus, data sets consist of 6 values per gene per
experimental set-up generated under standardized PCR
cycling conditions. Stationary phase genomic DNA 10-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/63

fold dilutions (ranging from 10 ng to 1 pg) were used to
generate a 5-point standard curve for every gene by using
the Cycle Threshold (Ct) value versus the logarithm of
each dilution factor. Reaction efficiency (E = [10(-1/
slope)]-1) for every gene was derived from the slope of the
corresponding standard curves. Transcript quantities were
calculated from the standard curve by the software accompanying the MxPro3000P QPCR System (Stratagene) set
with default parameters. Each experiment included a no
template control.
Stability of gene expression and relative quantification
The stability of gene expression was evaluated using the
Excel-based applications geNorm [11] and Normfinder
[7] and the relative expression was calculated with qBase
1.3.5 [48]. Briefly, the geNorm method is based on a pairwise comparison approach and depends on the calculation of an M value, defined as the average pairwise
variation of a particular gene with all others. The
NormFinder method is based on a different mathematic
model that considers the intra- and inter-treatment variation in expression for gene ranking. The normalization
factors were calculated following the criteria defined by
Vandesompele [11]. These include: a) to use the geometric mean (n numbers are multiplied and then the nth root
of the resulting product is taken) as this controls better for
possible outliers and abundance differences between
genes and b) to define the minimum number of reference
genes needed for a reliable calculation by evaluating the
pairwise variation between sequential normalization factors including three, four, five or more stable reference
genes (NFn/NFn+1).
Evaluation of reference gene expression by microarray
transcript profiling
A. ferrooxidans gene expression was evaluated under three
experimental conditions: (1) cells were grown in 9 K
medium containing 62 mM FeSO4 at pH 1.6 versus cells
grown in 9 K medium 1% elemental sulfur at pH 3.5 containing; (2) cells were grown in 9 K medium containing
62 mM FeSO4 plus 1% elemental sulfur at pH 1.6 versus
cells grown in 9 K medium containing 1% elemental sulfur at pH 1.6 and (3) cells were grown in 9 K medium containing 200 mM FeSO4 at pH 1.6 versus cells grown in 9 K
medium containing 62 mM FeSO4 at pH 1.6. Construction, experimental and data analysis protocols for A. ferrooxidans type strain specific oligonucleotide microarrays
have been previously described [22] and deposited in the
ArrayExpress database under the following accession
numbers (A-MEXP-1478, A-MEXP-1479).
