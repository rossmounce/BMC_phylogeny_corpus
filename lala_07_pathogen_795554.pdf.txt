Abstract
Background: NOD2, an intracellular pathogen recognition sensor, modulates innate defences to
muropeptides derived from various bacterial species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB).
Experimentally, NOD2 attenuates two key putative mycobactericidal mechanisms. TNF-α
synthesis is markedly reduced in MTB-antigen stimulated-mononuclear cells expressing mutant
NOD2 proteins. NOD2 agonists also induce resistance to apoptosis, and may thus facilitate the
survival of MTB in infected macrophages. To further define a role for NOD2 in disease
pathogenesis, we analysed NOD2 transcriptional responses in pulmonary leucocytes and
mononuclear cells harvested from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
Methods: We analysed NOD2 mRNA expression by real-time polymerase chain-reaction in
alveolar lavage cells obtained from 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and their matched
controls. We compared NOD2 transcriptional responses, in peripheral leucocytes, before and
after anti-tuberculous treatment in 10 patients. In vitro, we measured NOD2 mRNA levels in MTBantigen stimulated-mononuclear cells.
Results: No significant differences in NOD2 transcriptional responses were detected in patients
and controls. In some patients, however, NOD2 expression was markedly increased and
correlated with toll-like-receptor 2 and 4 expression. In whole blood, NOD2 mRNA levels
increased significantly after completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment. NOD2 expression levels did
not change significantly in mononuclear cells stimulated with mycobacterial antigens in vitro.
Conclusion: There are no characteristic NOD2 transcriptional responses in PTB. Nonetheless,
the increased levels of NOD2 expression in some patients with severe tuberculosis, and the
increases in expression levels within peripheral leucocytes following treatment merit further
studies in selected patient and control populations.

Background
The innate immune system is postulated to play a crucial
role in the elimination or control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), which causes infectious tuberculosis [1,2].
These innate immune responses are triggered when MTBderived molecules are sensed by toll-like receptors (TLRs),
a family of membrane proteins, as well as by nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2; also known
as CARD15), an intracellular pathogen recognition sensor. Activation of TLRs by MTB-antigens appears to be an
important event in the control of infection. For example,
mice that lack the toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) are more
susceptible to pneumonia following aerogenic infection
with MTB [3].
The nature of these innate responses, however, appears
complex and is not fully elucidated. For example, experimental studies show that MTB-induced TLR signalling
effects both cellular activation [4] and apoptosis [5]. Similarly, the innate responses mediated by NOD2, in
response to MTB-derived antigens, vary in different experimental systems.
NOD2 senses muramyl dipeptide (MDP) [6,7] a component of peptigoglycan that is found in mycobacterial cell
walls. A recent in vitro study suggests that NOD2 is an
essential recognition molecule for MTB [8], and pronounced cellular activation is noted in NOD2-transfected
cells that are stimulated with MDP or heat-killed MTB
preparations. Furthermore, cytokine production is inhibited in MTB-stimulated peritoneal macrophages obtained
from NOD2-deficient mice and in human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that express truncated
NOD2 proteins [8]. On the other hand, MDP stimulation
protects macrophages from apoptosis, which suggests that
activation of NOD2 induces apoptosis resistance which
facilitates the survival of MTB in macrophages [5].
The role of NOD2 in the pathogenesis of human MTBinfection is unknown. In vitro, human PBMCs that express
truncated NOD2 proteins synthesise significantly less
cytokines after stimulation with MTB-derived antigens.
Truncated NOD2 proteins are encoded by mutations in
the NOD2 gene that predispose individuals to Crohn's
disease, a granulomatous inflammatory bowel disease
[9,10]. The prevalence of these Crohn's disease-associated
mutations has not been fully described in all population
groups where tuberculosis is endemic although these
mutations are rare in African patients with tuberculosis
[11].
To further define a role for NOD2 in disease pathogenesis,
we analysed NOD2 mRNA transcriptional responses in
pulmonary leucocytes and PBMCs harvested from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/96

patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and healthy
controls. We determined whether changes in NOD2 transcription, if present, are characteristic for patients with
tuberculosis: increased transcriptional responses may suggest that MTB-infected macrophages are resistant to apoptosis whereas decreased transcriptional responses may
suggest that cellular activation is diminished in infected
macrophages. As various pathogen associated-molecular
patterns (PAMPs) specifically alter host transcriptional
responses [12], we analysed and correlated the transcriptional responses of other TLRs with NOD2 in patients
with PTB.

Methods
Patients and samples
Fifteen HIV-negative patients with culture proven pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), who donated blood and lung
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, were recruited in
London, United Kingdom. All patients with PTB had pansensitive isolates, received standard short course chemotherapy (6 to 9 months) and demonstrated clinical and
radiological response to anti-TB treatment. Control
donors (n = 15) were healthy volunteers matched to the
TB patients for age (within 4 years), sex and ethnicity.
They were asymptomatic, had no risk factors for HIV
infection (but were not formally tested), had normal chest
radiographs and were assumed, based on antigen-specific
(ESAT-6 and CFP-10) peripheral mononuclear cell IFN-γ
responses, not to be latently infected (T SPOT TB, Oxford
Immunotec, England) [13]. Control BAL samples were
obtained from six control donors.

Whole blood (20 mL) was taken, after informed consent,
within the first 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment (baseline).
2.5 mL whole blood was immediately transferred into
PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (Qiagen) for isolation and
purification of intracellular RNA. The remaining blood,
where relevant, was used for further experiments. Ten
donors with PTB were bled again within 4 weeks of stopping chemotherapy. Approval was obtained from the
Royal Free and UCLH hospital ethics committees.
BAL and Radiographic scoring
BAL fluid, obtained from a radiologically affected lung
segment, was concentrated ~10 fold before analysis whilst
cell pellets were immediately fixed in RNA stabilisation
buffer. In control donors the right middle lobe was lavaged. When possible, lymphocyte counts in BAL were confirmed by flow cytometry (104 gated events) after staining
~7.5 × 105 cells with anti CD4-FITC, anti CD8-PE and anti
CD3-PercP antibodies (BD Biosciences, UK). To determine the extent of pre-treatment radiological disease, two
radiologists, blinded to patient details, scored chest radiographs for air space shadowing, reticular opacities and
cavitation.

Enzyme-linked-immunospot (ELISPOT) assays
Peripheral T-cell IFN-γ ELISPOT responses to ESAT-6 and
CFP-10 peptide pools were determined to exclude latent
TB infection (T SPOT TB, Oxford Immunotec, England),
as previously described [14,13,15].
Culture and infection of PBMCs with M. tuberculosis
PBMCs from five healthy control donors were separated
from heparinized blood (50 ml) by Ficoll density gradient
centrifugation, and cells were reconstituted at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. To evaluate NOD2 gene regulation PBMCs were cultured for 66 hours in the presence
of live H37RV M. tuberculosis, a clinical isolate (Beijing
strain), live environmental mycobacterium (M. vaccae
NCTC 11659) and medium alone. Cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated
human AB serum and 1% L-glutamine without antibiotics
at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a category 3 laboratory and harvested at 18, 24, 48, and 66 h post-treatment. All strains
were grown in Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco) containing 10% v/v oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase supplement (BD Biosciences) in the category 3 laboratory.
Mycobacteria were disaggregated by vigorous vortexing
with glass beads and counted using a Neubauer hemocytometer as previously described [16]. A direct microscopic
count was performed to determine mycobacterial concentration. PBMCs were infected with living mycobacteria at
a dose of 1 organism per macrophage (10% monocytes in
PBMC). The viability of mycobacteria was assessed by culturing the diluted bacteria on Middlebrook 7H10 agar.

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR
RNA was isolated from whole blood and from lavage cell
pellets or cells using the Paxgene® and RNeasy® Kit, respectively. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR, to quantify mRNA encoding for NOD2 and NOD1, IL-4 and its
splice variant IL-4δ2, IFN-γ, TLRs and several proteins
involved in apoptosis (FLIP, FLICE, Bcl-2, Bax, Fas, FasL
and Bfl-1), were performed on samples, as previously
described, after quality control of RNA templates [17].
mRNA values were normalised to a validated housekeeping gene, human-acidic-ribosomal-protein (HuPO)
[18,19]. Primer and probe sequences, excluding those
which have been previously published [16,17], are shown
in table 2.
Data analysis
Data was analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon matched pairs test, Spearman rank-sum correlation
and linear regression on logged data.

Results
Demographic characteristics
Demographic details of matched TB patients (n = 15) and
controls, shown in Table 1, indicate that there were no differences in baseline characteristics between these groups.
All control patients had normal chest radiographs and
had no laboratory evidence of latent TB infection with M.
tuberculosis, as assessed by the antigen specific IFN-γ assay
(T SPOT TB).

Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid analyses in patients
with PTB and controls
BAL fluid recovered from patients with PTB were more cellular than controls, contained predominantly alveolar
macrophages, and contained a significantly greater
number of leucocytes and lymphocytes (Table 1). In PTBaffected patients, IFN-γ mRNA levels and the Th1/Th2
(IFN-γ/IL-4) ratio were significantly elevated compared to
control subjects (Table 1).
Pulmonary leucocytes express NOD2 mRNA
NOD2 is most prominently expressed in circulating
monocytes [10] and small intestinal Paneth cells [20].
Expression profiles in human pulmonary leucocytes have
not previously been studied. We initially determined
whether alveolar macrophages express NOD2 and measured NOD2 mRNA levels in pulmonary leucocytes
present in BAL fluid [21]. We show that NOD2 mRNA
expression levels are prominent in pulmonary leucocytes
although expression levels did not differ between patients
and controls (Figure 1). We also compared the expression
levels of NOD1 mRNA (also known as CARD4), in pulmonary leucocytes obtained from patients and controls
(Figure 1). NOD1 is an intracellular protein that is closely
related to NOD2 but does not appear to play a role in the
detection of mycobacterial antigens [8].

Although there are no characteristic NOD2 transcriptional
responses in patients with PTB, NOD2 mRNA was highly
expressed in two patients. Both patients, who were of
Somalian origin, and had severe tuberculosis: one patient
had extensive pulmonary cavitatory disease and the other
disseminated tuberculosis. We could not, however, identify more specific clinical variables to account for the high
levels of NOD2 expression in these patients. Patients with
cavitatory disease tended to have higher levels of NOD2
mRNA expression than those without pulmonary cavitation but these differences were not significant (Figure 2).
There was no correlation between NOD2 mRNA levels
and radiographic disease scores.
NOD2, and TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression correlate in
pulmonary leucocytes obtained from patients with PTB
NOD2 regulates cellular responses to peptidoglycanmediated activation of TLR2 [22]. Furthermore, mycobacterial TLR2 and NOD2 agonists synergistically induce
cytokine release in PBMCs obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with Crohn's disease [8]. In pulmonary
leucocytes obtained from patients with tuberculosis,
NOD2 mRNA expression correlated with TLR2 (p = 0.02;
figure 3A) and TLR4 (p = 0.01; figure 3B) but not with
TLR6 mRNA expression (p = 0.17). These correlations
were mainly due to the high levels of mRNA expression in
the two previously mentioned patients. In healthy controls, there was no correlation between NOD2 and TLR2

NOD1 mRNA expression did not correlate with TLR2 or
TLR4 mRNA expression in pulmonary leucocytes

NOD2 expression increases in whole blood following antituberculous therapy
In whole blood, both NOD2 and NOD1 mRNA expression increased following treatment, although only
increases in NOD2 mRNA expression were significant
(Figure 4).
Signalling pathways activated by NOD2
Following activation by MDP, NOD2 triggers downstream cellular responses mediated through NF-κB and
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation [23].
This results in the production of various cytokines, such as
TNFα and IL-4, which are important in regulating
immune responses to MTB [1,17]. We therefore compared
NOD2 mRNA with the transcriptional responses of
selected cytokines in BAL-derived cells obtained from
patients with PTB (n = 15) and controls (n = 6). Although
there were clear differences in the expression of some

IL-4δ2) in patients with TB and controls, there was no correlation between expression of these cytokines and
NOD2. There was also no correlation between NOD2 and
TNFα transcriptional responses in patients and controls.
In addition, NOD2 mRNA expression did not correlate
with expression of mRNA encoding several proteins
involved in apoptosis (FLIP, FLICE, Bcl-2, Bax, Fas, FasL
and Bfl-1) although high levels of mRNA encoding the
anti-apoptotic protein FLICE were measured in BALderived cells obtained from the two patients with elevated
NOD2 mRNA levels.
NOD2 mRNA expression is not regulated in PMBC freshly
inoculated with live strains of mycobacteria
We exposed PBMCs from five healthy volunteers, who did
not have laboratory evidence of tuberculosis infection (as
established by antigen-specific IFN-γ assays [14,13,15]),
to pathogenic strains of live mycobacteria (H37RV and
Beijing strain) and an environmental mycobacterium (M.
vaccae NCTC 11659), to determine if NOD2 mRNA
expression levels are regulated by. In general, mycobacteria induced modest, but non-significant changes, in
NOD2 mRNA expression (Figure 5A). Mycobacteria
induced marked increases in NOD2 mRNA expression in
one volunteer (Figure 5B) although mycobacterial stimulation did not regulate NOD2 mRNA expression significantly in PBMC extracted from the other volunteers

Discussion
NOD2, a member of the phylogenetically conserved NLR
(NACHT-leucine-rich repeat) family, is an essential pattern recognition sensor for MTB-derived antigens. Mycobacterial antigens fail to induce an appropriate increase in
TNF-α synthesis in human PBMC that express mutant
NOD2 proteins and in murine macrophages lacking
NOD2 [8]. The gene mutations that encode mutant
NOD2 proteins, however, appear to be rare in patients
with tuberculosis. NOD2 agonists may also modulate
innate responses to MTB by inducing resistance to apoptosis that facilitates the survival of MTB in infected macro-

two key putative mycobactericidal pathways. To further
define a role for NOD2 in disease pathogenesis, we analysed NOD2 transcriptional responses in pulmonary leucocytes and mononuclear cells harvested from patients

Our gene expression studies revealed that there are no

sion in peripheral leucocytes following treatment, suggest
further study in a larger group of patients to confirm a role
for NOD2 in PTB. In the present study, we only measured
total leucocyte and lymphocyte counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. As NOD2 is most prominently expressed
in monocytes, with very little expression in neutrophils
and lymphocytes, it is most likely that monocytes account
for the overwhelming majority of NOD2 expression [24].
We did not quantify the number of epithelial cells present
in broncho-alveolar fluid and we cannot determine the
effect of mycobacterial infection on NOD2 expression in
respiratory epithelial cells. Baseline NOD2 expression levels in primary respiratory epithelial cells is low [25]
although NOD2 mRNA expression is enhanced in immortalised human bronchial epithelial cells that are infected

with Streptococcus pneumoniae[25]. It would therefore be
important to determine the relative contribution of respiratory epithelial cells and monocytes to the increases in
NOD2 expression seen in some patients.
In the present study, NOD2 mRNA expression levels were
similar in patients (who often have active disease for
many weeks prior to diagnosis) and controls. This does
not exclude a role for NOD2 during the early stages of
MTB infection, when M. tuberculosis encounters the alveolar macrophage and innate immune pathways are first
activated. It is also possible, however, that the absolute
levels of NOD2 expression may not play a role in determining susceptibility to MTB infection. Rather, structural
variants of NOD2 proteins may modulate host immune
responses as suggested by in vitro studies [8]. Thus, studies

are required to confirm whether individuals with gene
mutations encoding for mutant NOD2 proteins are predisposed to MTB-infection. The lack of an association
between Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 gene mutations and tuberculosis in African patients [11] does not
exclude a role for NOD2 in MTB-infection because NOD2
gene mutations are probably rare in African populations
[10]. It would be instructive, therefore, to determine
whether NOD2 gene mutations are associated with MTBinfection in Caucasian populations, where these mutations occur with much greater frequency.
We were surprised to find significantly higher levels of
NOD2 mRNA expression in peripheral leucocytes
obtained from patients who completed anti-tuberculosis
therapy. Firstly, we hypothesise that this could have been
due to translocation of antigen-specific leucocytes predominantly to the site of disease (lungs) with few NOD2
expressing leucocytes in the peripheral compartment, and
reversal of this profile after treatment. However, the lack
of preferential NOD2 upregulation in the lung makes this
unlikely. Secondly, we speculate that MTB infection may
subvert protective innate responses by downregulating
NOD2 expression, whose levels therefore increase after
successful chemotherapy. We might expect this to occur in
parallel with TNF-α as this cytokine up-regulates NOD2
mRNA expression in various cell lineages including PBMC
[26,27]. However, in keeping with the observations of
other investigators [28,29], we did not observe increased
TNF-α mRNA expression after treatment completion. We
did not investigate the relationship between NOD2 and
soluble TNF-α receptors, which may modulate TNF-α levels. Thirdly, it is intriguing to speculate that increased levels of NOD2 mRNA, which occur with completion of TB
treatment, is a correlate of protective immunity. Similar
longitudinal changes may occur with IFN-γ [17,29,30]
and the Th1-like splice variant IL-4δ2 [17], which both
increase significantly with anti-TB treatment. In keeping
with these observations IL-4δ2 mRNA levels are also
increased in healthy subjects with latent MTB infection
who contain the disease [31,32]. Longitudinal studies in
TB infected patients, however, would be required to
address the role of NOD2 in this context. Interestingly,
preliminary data indicate that mycobacterial antigens regulate the expression of NOD2 splice variants [33] and further studies are required to clarify their role in
tuberculosis.
A significant limitation of this study is that we did not
study MTB-specific responses in subjects with known
NOD2 gene mutations. However, we found these patients
difficult to recruit in our clinical setting. We also acknowledge that real time PCR measures steady state mRNA levels only and not the activity of NOD2 protein, which is
physiologically active at concentrations too low to detect

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/96

by immunoassay. This study was powered to detect a 0.5
log change in NOD2 mRNA levels although smaller
changes may be biologically meaningful. However,
mRNA levels in patients and controls were similar and we
found no trends suggesting that inter-group difference
might be present.

Conclusion
Overall, our findings show that there are no characteristic
NOD2 transcriptional responses in pulmonary leucocytes
obtained from patients with PTB. Nonetheless, the
increased levels of NOD2 mRNA expression in peripheral
leucocytes obtained from patients completing treatment
and correlation between NOD2 and TLR2 and TLR4
mRNA expression in pulmonary leucocytes obtained from
some patients with severe tuberculosis does not exclude a
role for NOD2 in disease pathogenesis. The role of mutant
NOD2 proteins in MTB-infection in different ethnic
groups needs to be defined.
