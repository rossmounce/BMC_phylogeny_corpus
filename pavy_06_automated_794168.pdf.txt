Abstract
Background: High-throughput genotyping technologies represent a highly efficient way to
accelerate genetic mapping and enable association studies. As a first step toward this goal, we aimed
to develop a resource of candidate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in white spruce (Picea
glauca [Moench] Voss), a softwood tree of major economic importance.
Results: A white spruce SNP resource encompassing 12,264 SNPs was constructed from a set of
6,459 contigs derived from Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) and by using the bayesian-based
statistical software PolyBayes. Several parameters influencing the SNP prediction were analysed
including the a priori expected polymorphism, the probability score (PSNP), and the contig depth and
length. SNP detection in 3' and 5' reads from the same clones revealed a level of inconsistency
between overlapping sequences as low as 1%. A subset of 245 predicted SNPs were verified
through the independent resequencing of genomic DNA of a genotype also used to prepare cDNA
libraries. The validation rate reached a maximum of 85% for SNPs predicted with either PSNP ≥ 0.95
or ≥ 0.99. A total of 9,310 SNPs were detected by using PSNP ≥ 0.95 as a criterion. The SNPs were
distributed among 3,590 contigs encompassing an array of broad functional categories, with an
overall frequency of 1 SNP per 700 nucleotide sites. Experimental and statistical approaches were
used to evaluate the proportion of paralogous SNPs, with estimates in the range of 8 to 12%. The
3,789 coding SNPs identified through coding region annotation and ORF prediction, were
distributed into 39% nonsynonymous and 61% synonymous substitutions. Overall, there were 0.9
SNP per 1,000 nonsynonymous sites and 5.2 SNPs per 1,000 synonymous sites, for a genome-wide
nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (Ka/Ks) of 0.17.
Conclusion: We integrated the SNP data in the ForestTreeDB database along with functional
annotations to provide a tool facilitating the choice of candidate genes for mapping purposes or
association studies.

Background
Large-scale sequencing projects offer a possibility for low
cost SNP discovery since sequence variants can be found
computationally by analysing the redundancy in
sequence databases. For example, this approach has facilitated SNP-based genetic mapping in human [1,2], Arabidopsis [3-5], and rice [6,7]. Following the development of
pipelines to handle data derived from sequencing platforms, computational tools have been developed to predict SNPs in overlapping fragments of genomic sequences
or in expressed sequences such as ESTs [8,9].
The first-generation SNP detection software was derived
from tools used to help processing sequence data. After
the clustering and alignment of ESTs with Phrap, false positives were avoided by applying several filters to remove
low quality sequences [10]. Such approaches were applied
to public EST databases to identify candidate SNPs, which
were verified experimentally in human populations [10].
A major improvement of this approach was the detection
and filtering of putative paralogous sequences misassembled into the same cluster. Such filtering was conducted
using phylogenetic analysis [11] or sequence similarity
searches [12]. Indeed, one difficulty in searching for
intraspecific orthologous SNPs in sequence databases is to
distinguish true polymorphisms from artifacts due to
transcription/sequencing errors or misassembly of paralogous sequences. Without sequence trace data, a confidence score can be deduced from the redundancy at the
SNP locus and from its co-segregation with other surrounding SNPs in the alignment [9,13]. Other methods
use sequence quality information derived from the raw
trace data. Bayesian statistics were applied to incorporate
background information into the specification of a tested
model for data analysis [14]. They were implemented in
the software PolyBayes to determine a confidence score for
each SNP detected in a cluster of ESTs [15]. PolyBayes uses
a priori information about the average pairwise difference
between paralogous sequences to calculate a posteriori, the
probability that a sequence is native by comparison to a
reference sequence from the EST cluster. Thus, sequences
classified as paralogous in one EST cluster are excluded
from the SNP detection procedure. Then, based on the
alignment of the ESTs within the cluster, another Bayesian
calculation generates the probability that a variant at a
given location of a multiple alignment represents a true
polymorphism as opposed to a sequencing error. This calculation takes into account the alignment depth, the base
calls in each of the sequences, the associated base quality
values, the base composition in the region, and the
expected a priori rate of polymorphism of the species
under investigation. This approach was shown to be adequate for SNP prediction in human [15], sugarcane [16],
soybean [17], and pine [18].

The development of SNP markers in plant species will
contribute to the understanding of crop evolutionary history, to the positional cloning of QTLs, and to markerassisted breeding (reviewed in [19]). Especially in conifers, candidate gene approaches are favored to dissect
complex traits since linkage desequilibrium is low or
declines rapidly within the length of an average-sized gene
[20,21]. In these species, the development of high density
gene maps based on intraspecific SNPs should result in
better marker-aided selection systems by enabling the efficient co-localization of genes and quantitative/qualitative
trait loci to further facilitate association studies. These
high-density gene maps will also be helpful to delineate
homologous chromosomal regions among taxa and to
study how gene regions are structured and have evolved
(e.g. [22]). To accelerate mapping projects in conifers, we
plan to use high-throughput genotyping technologies. A
first step toward this goal is the development of a resource
of candidate SNPs. Such resources can be obtained computationally since several EST collections are being developed in pines [23-26] and in spruces [27,28].
As part of our research integrating functional and structural genomics analyses in white spruce (Picea glauca)
[29], we have generated diverse cDNA libraries from 12
genotypes and carried large-scale EST sequencing [30].
Here, we present the in silico detection of SNPs in the EST
alignments using the PolyBayes software and describe the
factors that affect the automated SNP detection. The quality of the in silico approach was further assessed by the
independent sequencing of a subset of genomic DNA fragments. We demonstrate how this analysis was used to
define a set of highly reliable predicted SNPs according to
their probability scores. Contigs may also contain paralogous sequences which may cause the detection of non
allelic SNPs. Parameters for limiting this bias can be set in
the prediction software PolyBayes, but methods for a posteriori assessment of this source of variation remain to be
defined. We took advantage of our SNP dataset to evaluate
the proportion of paralogous SNPs in our white spruce
gene index using statistical and experimental approaches.
Two general approaches were also applied to delineate
translated regions and distinguish synonymous from
nonsynonymous SNPs. To facilitate the choice of candidate genes to be mapped, this white spruce SNP resource
was integrated into a publicly available database ForestTreeDB, which also includes functional annotations of the
gene index.

Results and discussion
We estimated SNP diversity and distribution parameters
in 6,459 contigs each derived from sequences of at least
two cDNA clones with the PolyBayes software. Predicted
SNP analyses have frequently been conducted based on a
number of aligned sequence reads. We have conducted

large-scale EST sequencing with both 3' and 5' reads from
the same cDNA clones and obtained a large number of
cDNAs with of overlapping reads in the same contig [30].
We thus considered the contigs for inclusion in our analysis based upon the number of clones represented rather
than the number of reads.
Experimental error rate within EST assemblies
We exploited the fact that sequence reads in opposite
directions from the same clone overlapped in 4,395 contigs, in order to verify whether SNPs were detected in these
redundant sequences. Indeed, differences detected within
same-clone overlaps would not represent real SNPs but
experimental errors from reverse transcription or sequencing. The total available alignment length of these overlapping sequences was 4,755,154 nucleotides. In total, there
were only 288 positions (1 per 16,511 nucleotide sites)
where reads from the same clone conflicted, and 74% of
these positions were uncalled or ambiguous bases.
Among the remaining 75 putative false substitutions, we
observed a few cases where the discrepancy in one clone
was repeated in another clone at the same site in the contig. After removing these repeated discrepancies, we
detected 69 sites that conflicted between overlapping
reads from the same clone, out of the overall 7,555 SNPs
detected with probability score PSNP ≥ 0.10. The overlapping sequences represented an error rate or false prediction rate of less than 1%. The low level of false prediction
indicates that the sequences were generated with a high
accuracy and that the initial filtering using a Phred score of
20 appears to be sufficiently stringent to eliminate the
majority of experimental errors.

HB-3, NAM, rpl13A, rpl15) [21,31]. It is also in the range
of that observed for Pinus taeda (0.016) [32] and for Pinus
pinaster (0.0097) [18]. With p-prior = 0.01, we detected,
9,310 SNPs among 3,590 contigs (PSNP ≥ 0.95; Figure 1),
resulting in a polymorphism rate of 1 SNP per 700
nucleotide sites. In Pinus pinaster, LeDantec et al. (2004)
reported a SNP rate of 1 per 660 nucleotide sites by using
p-prior = 0.01 and PSNP ≥ 0.99, and analysing contigs containing 4 reads or more [18]. The rate that we estimated in
P. glauca became 1 SNP per 689 nucleotide sites, somewhat closer to that reported for P. pinaster, when using the
same probability levels and considering only contigs of 4
clones or more. Our rate rate further increased to 1 SNP
per 492 nucleotide sites when considering SNPs with PSNP
≥ 0.95 (p-prior of 0.01, contigs with 4 clones). Our analyses also showed that 55.6% to 61.5% the contigs included
at least one SNP predicted when varying PSNP from ≥ 0.95
to ≥ 0.10 (with a constant p-prior = 0.01: Figure 1).
In our dataset, the 6,459 contigs gave a total of 6,521,041
aligned sites, and 12,264 SNPs were detected in silico using
PolyBayes (minimum PSNP = 0). The majority of in silico
detected SNPs (55.4 %) were detected at PSNP ≥ 0.99, and
most of the remaining SNPs were detected by decreasing
the detection stringency to 0.80 (Figure 2, dash line). Further decreasing PSNP from 0.80 to 0 added a rather small
number of SNPs.

In silico detected SNPs according to the expected SNP
frequency and PolyBayes probability scores
The probability that a position represents a SNP (PSNP)
depends on the a priori expected SNP frequency (termed
p-prior in the formula generating PSNP) [15]. The p-prior
impacts upon the number of SNPs found a posteriori;
therefore, we tested its influence on the frequency of predicted SNPs (Figure 1). There were fewer predicted SNPs
with the lower p-prior values and the impact of the p-prior
was greater at higher PSNP values. For example, the number
of SNPs predicted with PSNP ≥ 0.10 varied from 12,497 to
10,860 when the p-prior was changed from 0.02 to 0.001,
whereas the number of SNPs detected with PSNP ≥ 0.95
went from 10,173 to 6,085, for p-prior varying from 0.02
to 0.001.

Experimental estimation of the rate of false positives
according to PSNP
The collection of in silico detected SNPs was built for genotyping purposes. To extract the most reliable SNPs, we
could have chosen the ones detected with the highest
scores (PSNP ≥ 0.99). Indeed, several SNP resources were
developed by using PolyBayes to detect SNPs and only SNP
detected with score PSNP ≥ 0.99 were considered [17,18].
However, the stringent cutoff of PSNP ≥ 0.99 would eliminate 44.6% of the in silico detected SNPs from our data
set.(Figure 2). Useche et al. (2001) [33] used PolyBayes to
detect SNPs in maize ESTs. They determined that the PSNP
score as an important parameter and chose to display all
the SNPs in their database, irrespective of their PSNP scores,
to avoid discarding too many SNPs. However, the validity
of the various polymorphisms was not assessed experimentally. We felt it was important to strike a balance
between the cost of genotyping and the desire to achieve
a high SNP discovery rated, thus, we experimentally tested
the in silico detected SNPs for various levels of PSNP scores.

In this report, we used a p-prior of 0.01 corresponding to
a mean frequency of one SNP per 100 nucleotides, as in a
previous study on Pinus pinaster [18]. A very similar SNP
frequency was experimentally determined at 0.012 in
Picea glauca, based upon a total of 9,253 nucleotide sites
sampled for eight nuclear genes (KN1, KN2, KN3, KN4,

For the purpose of validation, fragments of spruce
genomic DNA were amplified and sequenced from the
same source material as the previously conducted EST
sequencing [30]. We carried out the analyses using a subset of the dataset, corresponding to the sequences
obtained from the single genotype PG653. Working with

a single genotype reduced the number of sequencing reactions required for this validation, since detected SNPs represented biallelic positions. Hence, putative SNP sites
would correspond to double peaks in the sequence chromatograms derived from PG653 (Figure 2). A set of 156
contigs encompassing 325 SNPs detected in silico with a
range of PSNP values were selected to amplify the genomic
sequences. We were able to specifically amplify the single
expected sequence for 112 contigs, encompassing 245 in
silico detected SNPs. A total of 43,286 nucleotides corresponding to these 112 genes were sequenced and were visually inspected by aligning the trace files [see Additional
file1] for details about the targeted contigs and SNPs). We
obtained a true positive rate of 74%, represented by the in
silico detected SNPs that were also detected in the genomic
DNA sequence analysis (Figure 2). Nearly identical validation rates of 85.1% and 84.9% were observed when considering only the SNPs detected with higher stringency
criteria of PSNP ≥ 0.95 or ≥ 0.99. Based on this observation,
we considered SNPs detected with values of PSNP ≥ 0.95 for

the remained of our study. However, the subset of SNPs
detected with a PSNP ≥ 0.99 were used in specific analyses
to enable comparisons with published reports [17,18].
Similarly to our results, Le Dantec et al. (2004) reported a
validation rate of 83% for SNPs detected with a PSNP ≥
0.99 in pine [18]. By using a cut-off of PSNP ≥ 0.95 rather
than of PSNP ≥ 0.99, we increased the number of SNPs by
2,514 out of a total of 12,264 SNPs detected in silico using
PolyBayes.
Such experimental validations of SNPs detected by PolyBayes or other computational prediction methods have
been conducted only sparingly, and for a few other
genomes. PolyBayes was used to predict SNPs in human
ESTs; a subset of 36 SNPs detected with a PSNP score ≥ 0.40
was experimentally verified by screening four populations, leading to a confirmation rate of 56% [15]. On a
larger scale, 1,200 SNPs from dbSNP which were detected
in silico in the human genome by data-mining procedures
were experimentally analysed by a pooled DNA sequenc-

experimental validation of in silico SNP detection in
genomes that are incompletely sequenced, before the
information is used for more advanced genetic analyses.
In the following section, we examine two methods to estimate the proportion of paralogous SNPs among in silico
detected SNPs and show that most of the SNPs falsely predicted by PolyBayes represent differences between paralogous sequences.

was verified by the independant resequencing of fragments
amplified from the genomic DNA extracted from the PG653
genotype. The sequence traces were manually inspected to

whereas the ones that were not verified were called "false
positives" (in yellow on the figure).

ing approach, showing that 80% of the detected SNPs
were found polymorphic in three ethnic groups [34]. In
another validation study, the confirmation rate reached
88%, but the SNPs were detected in silico using several
approaches and it was not possible to attribute a performance level to PolyBayes specifically [35].
We obtained an experimental validation rate 85% (137
out of 161) for SNPs detected in our white spruce contigs
at PSNP ≥ 0.95. The validation rate increased to 92% when
only considering contigs derived from 2 or 3 clones. The
SNPs falsely predicted by PolyBayes represent either experimental errors in the ESTs or differences between paralogous sequences erroneously assembled into a single
contig. The experimental error rate was previously shown
to be very low, from the analysis of overlapping sequence
reads in opposite directions from the same clone. On the
other hand, the higher confirmation rate observed with
contigs containing fewer clones would indicate that putative paralogs are indeed present in the contigs, especially
in those comprised of several cDNA clones, in spite of the
stringency of the parameters used in the contig assembly.
When the complete genome is available to help delineate
orthologs and paralogs, the confirmation rate of in silico
detected SNPs tends to be higher than that observed in
our study. For example, in a SNP detection project conducted in Arabidopsis, the confirmation rate was 96% for
in silico detected SNPs [5]. Analysing SNPs in a completely
sequenced genome can be much more powerful because
most of the paralogs may be excluded from the contigs
used to detect SNPs. Our results confirm the need for

Estimating the proportion of paralogous SNPs
A number of contigs were likely to contain paralogous
sequences, so we were interested in evaluating the proportion of paralogous versus orthologous SNPs in the dataset.
We use the term 'paralogous SNPs' to refer to non allelic
SNPs which likely result from the misassembly of paralogous, and 'orthologous SNPs' for allelic differences occurring between reads truly derived from the same gene. The
paralogous SNPs are to a great extent undesirable for population or association genetics studies and in genetic mapping. To estimate the proportion of paralogous SNPs, we
followed two approaches.

We first used the previous validation experiment of in silico detected SNPs where a set of 112 contigs was resequenced from genomic DNA of the single genotype
PG653. The same set of contigs was re-sequenced from
genomic DNA of a haploid white spruce megagametophyte, with 43,286 nucleotides determined and visually
inspected by aligning the trace files. The presence of superimposed peaks in sequences from haploid DNA indicates
the presence of 'paralogous SNPs' We found 19 SNPs (out
161) that corresponded to multiple peaks in the
sequences obtained from haploid megagametophyte
DNA, among the in silico detected SNPs used for validation, with genomic DNA of PG653 (see above), which
represents a proportion of paralogous SNPs of 12%. If we
only consider the SNPs detected in silico with PSNP ≥ 0.95,
the proportion of paralogous SNPs decreases slightly to
10.5%.
The second method used is based on population genetics
theory and relies entirely on estimates of in silico SNP frequencies, as described in Methods. It relies on a comparison of the frequency of SNPs in contig sequences derived
only from the single genotype PG653, and the frequency
of SNPs in the total population sampled. When paralogous sequences are intermixed with orthologous
sequences, the proportion of segregating sites k is biased
upward by a quantity corresponding to ε. ε is a constant
independent of the number of genotypes analysed, while
k will increase with the number of haploid genomes analysed, thus resulting in a reduction of ε relative to k. This
principle can be used to estimate ε. For this purpose, only
SNPs with PSNP ≥ 0.95 and contigs containing 10 clones or
more were considered, in order to sample as many distinct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/174

haploid genomes as possible while sampling a reasonable
number of contigs and SNPs. When sequences corresponding to contigs obtained from PG653 only were considered, 43 SNPs were detected from a cumulative length
of 36,191 nucleotide sites, for a k value of 1/842 or
0.00119. When sequences from all genotypes were considered for the same contigs, 1,532 SNPs were detected
from a cumulative length of 507,528 nucleotide sites, and
k was higher with a value of 1/331 or 0.00302. Then, the
estimated proportion of «paralogous SNPs» in the dataset,
ε, was obtained by solving the set of equations (4) and (5)
in Methods and for two sampling scenarios delineated
therein. The ε values obtained were 0.000238 and
0.000517, respectively, corresponding to proportions of
paralogous SNPs of 8% and 17% in the entire dataset. As
explained in Methods, the second scenario, which
assumes a sampling size of 24 haploid genomes, is less
likely than the first scenario of sampling 10 distinct haploid genomes per contig, given that very few contigs
would be characterized by a number of distinct clones
approaching 24, the maximum number of haploid
genomes corresponding to the 12 distinct genotypes used
to obtain EST sequences. Thus, the value of 8% should be
more realistic than the value of 17%.

However, this procedure may not be suitable when the
reference genotype has been genetically manipulated.
SNP frequency according to contig depth and length
Several studies reported SNP frequencies from automated
detection methods, though SNP frequencies can vary
according to several sampling parameters. In the next
analysis, we considered the effects of contig depth, contig
length, and alignment length on the estimates of SNP frequency from in silico detection with PolyBayes (Table 1,
Figure 3). The number of contigs with or without SNPs
was counted according to the number of clones within
each contig, which defines the contig depth. The proportion of contigs that contained at least one SNP (PSNP ≥
0.95) increased from 37.5 % to 93%, for contigs derived
from 2 and 10 clones respectively. (Figure 3). The relative
frequency of SNPs also increased asymptotically according to the contig depth (Table 1), as was reported for Pinus
pinaster [18]. The larger number of SNPs detected resulted
from the increase of both the depth of the contigs and the
length of the alignments (Figure 3, Table 1).

To evaluate SNP frequencies, two methods were used
(Table 1). First, the number of in silico detected SNPs was
divided by the cumulative length of the contigs, resulting
in a number of SNPs per nucleotide site (PSNP ≥ 0.95). The
SNP frequency ranged from one per 1,184 nucleotide to
one per 361 nucleotide sites in contigs from two to 10 or
more clones, respectively (Table 1). On average, one SNP
was detected per 700 nucleotide sites. Second, we generated a less biased measure of the SNP frequency by computing the number of SNPs (PSNP ≥ 0.95) per redundant
nucleotide site. A redundant site is one where information
for more than one sequence is available in the contig. We
thus developed a Perl script to only count the number of
redundant nucleotide sites involved in the SNP detection
within each contig, thus excluding non redundant nucleotide sites, which were only represented by one sequence in
the contig alignment. With this approach, the SNP fre-

These ε estimates agree well with the proportion of paralogous SNPs obtained from experimental validation using
haploid megagametophyte DNA (rate of 10 to 12%).
These estimates indicate that most of the false positives
predicted by PolyBayes were not experimental errors, but
that the criteria used to assemble the ESTs and run PolyBayes were stringent enough to avoid a wide occurrence of
paralogous SNPs. To our knowledge, these are the first
experimental and statistical estimates of proportions of
paralogous SNPs in SNP datasets derived from EST contigs. The statistical procedure outlined above offers a simple way to estimate the proportion of paralogous SNPs for
a given set of contig assembly parameters, as long as EST
sequences from a single genotype can be traced back.

redundant nucleotide sites are excluded. The difference in
mean alignment length per contig can be seen on Figure 3
and Table 1, when excluding or including non redundant
nucleotide sites. As contigs contain more clones, the relative impact of this factor diminishes (Figure 3). The proportion of paralogous SNPs estimated in the previous
section was also based on SNP rates per redundant
nucleotide site.
Detection of putative coding regions by sequence
similarity searches and ORF prediction
To determine which SNPs lay outside or inside putative
coding regions, two methods were used to predict open
reading frames (ORFs). The first one was based on similarities with protein sequences in public databases and the
second one was based on ab initio predictions of open
reading frames.

In the first approach the blastx program was used to compare translations of the spruce contigs with protein
sequences from the Uniref100 database and the Arabidopsis TAIR database. The alignments with homologous
sequences at the protein level enabled us to localize conserved coding regions and to determine the frame of the
coding sequences within boundaries defined by sequence
conservation. If a SNP site lay within the boundaries of
the alignment, then it was considered as belonging to a
coding region conserved across species. If the SNP lay outside of these boundaries, we could not characterize the
nature of the SNP. Out of the 3,590 contigs containing
SNPs (PSNP ≥ 0.95), 3,160 contigs had a match with an
Arabidopsis protein or a protein from Uniref100 with blastx
(e-value < 1e-10; Table 2). The remaining 430 orphan
contigs containing SNPs did not have strong enough
alignments to draw conclusions.
A second method based on ORF prediction was used to
pursue two objectives. It enabled us to identify putative
ORFs among the 430 orphan contigs and to classify the
SNPs as coding or not coding without any assumptions
regarding sequence similarity. ORFs were predicted by
using the Diogenes software which was trained with ORFs

on a combination of two methods (in bold), and based on data found by both methods (in italics). The total number of snp'ed contigs

from several species, thus generating multiple matrices to
detect ORFs in plant sequence datasets [36]. We analysed
the results generated by two matrices, one derived from
the "Brassicaceae" and one from the "Pinaceae" training
sets, using a p-value < 1e-08 in each case (Table 2). Diogenes detected ORFs with a in 214 out of the 430 orphan
contigs (p-value < 1e-08). with only 9 detected by Diogenes trained with Pinaceae sequences only. We combined
the ORFs detected by blastx and Diogenes and we were able
to localize an ORF for a total of 3,374 out of the 3,590
snp'ed contigs. An ORF was assigned to 88% of the contigs
based on blastx matches alone, whereas the combination
of both blast and Diogenes increased the assignments to
94%. The assignments were distributed as follows: i)
3,160 ORFs with a blastx hit in Uniref100 (including 20
sequences with a match in the Arabidopsis proteome but
not in UniRef100); ii) 225 ORFs predicted by DiogenesBrassiceae; and iii) 9 ORFs specifically predicted by Diogenes-Pinaceae.
Estimating the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous
SNPs
In order to classify synonymous and nonsynonymous
SNPs, we used the boundaries of the ORFs predicted by
Diogenes wherever possible using, in preference over the
boundaries of the conserved regions detected by blastx.
Boundaries of coding regions delineated by similarity
searches (blastx) were avoided because they could have
introduced an estimation bias related to conserved
regions. We compared the blastx and the Diogenes results
to annotate the coding regions based on ORF predictions
and developed and improved dataset to classify nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs and estimate their frequencies. The improved dataset was still comprised of
3,374 ORFs but distributed as follows: i) 2,823 ORFs predicted by Diogenes-Brassiceae ii) 9 ORFs specifically predicted by Diogenes-Pinaceae, iii) 533 regions similar to
known proteins identified by blastx searches against

2065

Uniref100 but without any ORF predicted by Diogenes,
and iv) 9 regions similar to Arabidopsis proteins identified
with blastx but without any ORF predicted with Diogenes.
We thus classified 3,789 coding SNPs, distributed into
39.8% nonsynonymous and 60.2% synonymous substitutions (Table 3). Whatever the method used to delineate
the ORFs (blastx or Diogenes), the ratio of synonymous to
nonsynonymous substitutions was about 1.5:1. This ratio
is lower than the ratio of 2:1 found in Arabidopsis by
Schmid et al. (2003) [5], based on the sampling of 5,289
contigs. However, these numbers should not be compared
directly because they are not standardized by the numbers
of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites sampled. To
estimate the overall rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs per nucleotide site, the numbers of synonymous (Ls) and nonsynonymous sites (La) [37] were
determined based on the ORFs predicted as described
above. Based on these 3,374 ORFs, the overall rate of synonymous substitutions was 5.18 SNPs per 1,000 sites and
the overall rate of nonsynonymous substitutions was 0.89
SNP per 1,000 sites (Table 3). Compared to direct count
estimates, the difference between the two classes of SNPs
was increased because there exists far fewer synonymous
sites than nonsynonymous sites. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNP rates per site (Ka/Ks) was 0.17.
Such a ratio far below 1 indicates that, on average, white
spruce ORFs are under strong purifying selection. Using
the ORFs delineated by the blastx search or predicted by
Diogenes had no effect on the estimation of SNP frequencies, indicating that there was no bias associated with the
delineation of coding regions using blastx. Similar Ka/Ks
ratios based on smaller numbers of genes have been estimated in Arabidopsis. The white spruce "genome-wide"
Ka/Ks ratio (0.17) is identical to the mean Ka/Ks of 0.17
estimated from 23 nuclear genes in Arabidopsis [38], and it
is similar to the mean Ka/Ks ratio of 0.207 obtained from
242 genes in A. thaliana [39]. Several studies have found a

large gene-to-gene variance in Ka/Ks values. Similar variation was also found in the present study (data not shown).
By combining several approaches to delineate ORFs we
were able to increase the number of coding SNPs by 13%.
With Diogenes, we classify 221 SNPs (among the 430) contigs with no match in Uniref100. In this subset of 221
SNPs, the rate of synonymous substitutions was 6.18
SNPs per 1,000 sites and that of nonsynonymous substitutions was 1.10 SNP per 1,000 sites, which are slightly
higher rates than the overall dataset., but the overall Ka/Ks
ratio remained about the same at 0.18. This result was
expected, as the discovery of additional SNPs by in silico
methods should not affect the overall balance between
nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs.
Integration of the SNP resource in ForestTreeDB
To facilitate the retrieval of snp'ed contigs according to
their functional annotations, the white spruce SNP data
was uploaded into ForestTreeDB, a database unifying EST
data and sequence annotations. ForestTreeDB includes
tables containing data related to 12,264 white spruce
SNPs detected in silico. These public query pages are available to mine the data at http://ccgb.umn.edu:8088/
ForestTreeDB/nimbus/project.do?project=ForestTreeDB.
Each SNP is described by its location on the contig
sequence, including the appropriate strand. The possible
bases of the SNP are represented by the IUPAC nucleotide
ambiguity code. An "evidence code" indicates the SNP status as "predicted", "validated," or "not validated". The
number of distinct clones that support each SNP location
is retained, as well as the analytical parameters used for
the prediction, including the p_prior value and the confidence level of the in silico detection (PSNP). Several computational approaches were used to explore the putative
functions of the sequences recovered in the snp'ed contig
dataset the results were incorporated in the ForestTreeDB
database. The analyses included sequence similarity
searches against several databases and Hidden Markov
Models searches with the models available in the PFAM
protein families database, as described previously [30].
Approximately 87% of the contigs containing at least one
SNP had a blastx hit in UniRef100 (e-value < 1e-10; Table
2). We assigned putative GO terms to the subset of snp'ed
contigs through the sequence similarity searches against
UniRef100 and the Arabidopsis TAIR database providing a
link to molecular function terms in the Gene Ontology
(GO). Among the diverse molecular function categories,
1,943 annotations (belonging to 94 functional classes)
were associated to 1,388 snp'ed contigs (one contig may
be associated to more than one GO term). The wide diversity of predicted functions among the snp'ed contigs. indicates that dataset could be useful in diverse association
studies drawing upon genes from diverse protein functions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/174

Among other applications, ForestTreeDB is particularly
useful in the context of candidate gene approaches, as it
provides a priori information on predicted gene polymorphisms along with predicted protein functions. ForestTreeDB interfaces enable researchers to visualize and
retrieve sequences, contig compositions, sequence similarity search results and prediction by PolyBayes in a parsed
format. Figure 4 provides an example based on the
Contig4486: it is similar to a sequence belonging to the
auxin-responsive IAA family, is classified in the "transcriptional regulation" Gene Ontology category and encompasses four SNPs. Such integration of SNP data into
ForestTreeDB will facilitate the selection of the most
promising SNPs to be incorporated in genetic analyses
either based on their reliability (probability score, depth
of the EST alignment) or based on the functional annotation of the sequences.

Methods
Plant material and EST collection
A total of 17 Picea glauca cDNA libraries were prepared
from a diverse tissues sampled to maximize the diversity
of the isolated genes. Details about the sampled tissues are
available on the Arborea web site [29]. Nine libraries were
prepared from the genotype PG653, and the remaining
eight libraries were prepared from 11 different accessions
of Picea glauca to incorporate more genotype diversity.
Details of the preparation of cDNA libraries and EST
sequencing methods previously presented elsewhere [30].

All of the clones were randomly chosen and sequenced
from the 3' end [30]. A subset of clones selected among 10
libraries were also sequenced from the 5' end. As the 3'
and 5' reads from the same clone may overlap in the same
contig, all SNP diversity and distribution parameters were
estimated by considering the number of clones analysed
instead of the number of reads. Thus, we directed our
search for SNPs to the 6,459 contigs derived from at least
2 clones and which had mean length 1,009 nucleotides of
Phred score above 20. The majority of contigs, namely
73.4%, were derived from both 3' and 5' reads; they had
an average length of 1,078 nucleotide and represented
completely sequenced inserts. A total 20.4% of the contigs
were derived from the 3' reads and only 6.2% were from
the 5' reads alone. The 5' and 3'contigs were slightly
shorter, with mean lengths 803 and 823 nucleotides,
respectively. The EST sequences were deposited in the
dbEST section of the GenBank database. The contig
sequences, the contig composition, blast reports, and
some statistics about the sequence dataset are available at
our web site [28].

Experimental validation of the in silico detected SNPs by
resequencing of genomic DNA
Experimental validation of the in silico detected SNPs
involved PCR amplification and sequencing of genomic
DNA corresponding to EST contigs. To minimize the risk
of amplifying multiple members of the same multigenic
family when amplifying genomic DNA corresponding to
EST contigs, we chose contigs with a small number of hits
against the more extensively sequenced pine transcriptome (Pinus Gene Index Release 4)[26]. We assumed that
these contigs would be part of small gene families and
would also be less represented in the spruce genome. We
also extrapolated the ATG and/or the STOP positions on
the spruce contigs based on the assumption that spruce
proteins would be of similar size than the complete Arabidopsis proteins against which they had a match. We thus
anchored one of the two primers (or both) upstream of
the ATG or downstream of the STOP codons to target the
less conserved untranslated regions. For the contigs in
which ATG or STOP codons could not be predicted, we
selected sequence regions that were not conserved with
known sequences to anchor at least one of the two PCR
primers. Primers for PCR amplification and sequencing
were designed by using the Primer3 software [40] installed
locally. The primer sequences were compared with blast
[41] against the spruce and the pine transcript datasets to
exclude primers with possible hits in multiple transcripts.
PCR reactions were performed in 30 μl containing 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 1.5–2.0 mM MgCl2, 200
μM of each dNTP, 200 μM of both 5' and 3' primers and
1.0 unit of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California). About 5–20 ng of genomic DNA
was used as template. A peltier Thermal Cycler (DNA
Engine, DYAD™, MJ Research, Walthman, Massachusetts)
was used, with the following thermal cycling program : 4
min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s
at annealing temperature optimized between 54 and
60°C for each pair of primers, and 1 min at 72°C, followed by 10 min at 72°C. Each PCR product was directly
sequenced in both directions with a Perkin-Elmer ABI
3700 XL DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
California), using BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit
(version 3.1). Contigs were constructed with the seqmerge
program in the GCG package (Wisconsin Package Version
10.3, Accelrys Inc., San Diego, California).
EST sequence processing and SNP automated detection
EST sequences were processed with locally-developed system at the Center for Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics, University of Minnesota, for contig quality
control, as was previously described in detail [30].
Sequence trace files from the spruce ESTs were processed
to yield raw sequences with the Phred base calling software
version 0.020425.c [42]. Phred quality values less than 20
were considered to be ambiguous in this experiment and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/174

were assigned base N. Quality trimming and vector filtering (with polyA/polyT removal, as appropriate) were
done using the software gstVF4 [43]. Processed EST
sequences were then assembled using Phrap (version
0.990319) [44]. Phrap contigs were evaluated for chimeric
sequences, and reassembled so as to minimize chimeric
tendencies. Final assembly threshold for phrap were -minmatch 50 -minscore 100. This procedure produced better
quality contigs prior to running PolyBayes. For the SNP
prediction, the PolyBayes software version 3.0 [15] was run
with the following parameters: -inputFormat ace -aceIn
spruce.fasta.screen.ace.1 -phdFilePathIn../phd_dir -reportOut../polybayes.out -p_prior (0.001 0.00125 0.0025
0.005 0.01 0.02) -thresholdSnp 0. The candidate SNPs
were filtered by using the probability PSNP provided by
PolyBayes with several cutoffs for PSNP. PolyBayes outputs
were analysed with in-house scripts written in Perl.
Statistical estimation of the proportion of paralogous
SNPs
The following procedure was used to estimate the proportion of paralogous versus orthologous SNPs in the SNP
dataset. In the absence of paralogous SNPs, it can be
shown that

k = aθ

(1)

where k is the proportion of segregating sites, those harboring a SNP, and θ = 4Neμ, Ne being the effective population size and μ, the mutation rate per site per generation,
and
a = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(n-1)

(2)

where n is the number of sequences sampled per gene (eq.
9.8, [45]). When paralogous sequences are inter-mixed
with orthologous sequences, k is biased upward by a
quantity corresponding to ε, such that
k = aθ + ε

(3)

Thus, ε could be estimated by solving the following set of
equations:
kPG653 = θ + ε
kpop = aθ + ε

(4)
(5)

where kPG653 and kpop correspond to the number of segregating sites in sequences from the single genotype PG653
and from the population sample of 12 genotypes, respectively. In both cases, the number of sites sampled corresponded to the cumulative length of sequences of
redundant nucleotide sites, those represented in at least
two clones, and we used only SNPs with PSNP ≥ 0.95.

Page 12 of 14

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:174

Because contigs with a small number of clones are biased
downward in terms of sampling SNP diversity (Figure 3),
we limited our analysis to contigs containing 10 clones or
more when considering sequences from PG653 only as
well as when considering sequences from all 12 genotypes. In the case of PG653 and equation (4), we assumed
that all contigs with 10 clones and more contained
sequences from both haploid complements, thus the sampling size n corresponded to 2 and thus, a = 1 was used
when transforming equation (1) to (4). When considering
all 12 genotypes and equation (5), lower and higher
bound scenarios were considered. A first scenario
assumed a sampling size of 10, given that contigs with 10
or more sequences were analysed, thus corresponding to
an a value of 3.733 in equation (5). We also tested a second scenario, by assuming a sampling size of 24 corresponding to the number of haploid complements used to
obtain EST sequences, with corresponding a value of
2.929 in equation (5). This scenario is less likely, given
that very few contigs had a number of sequences in excess
of 30. Then, the proportion of paralogous SNPs in the
entire dataset could simply be obtained by the ratio of ε
over kpop.
ORF annotation
Phrap contigs were analysed by blastx comparisons [41]
against several databases, including a non-redundant peptide set (UniRef100) provided by the UniProt consortium
[46], Arabidopsis protein dataset retrieved from the TAIR
web site [3], and the Pine Gene Index (PGI4) retrieved
from TIGR [26]. We extrapolated the Gene Ontology
(GO) terms [47,48] associated with sequences in
UniRef100 and the TAIR databases to the contigs using
sequence similarity criteria. The Diogenes software [36],
which was trained with sequences from multiple species
to predict open reading frames, was used with two parameter sets derived respectively from Brassicaceae and
Pinaceae species. Only those predicted coding regions
with p < 1e-08 were retained. A Perl script was written to
standardize the blastx output and the Diogenes output
(frames were converted into phases, and the start/end of
the ORFs were recalculated to comply with the blast HSP
start/end). To sort the SNPs into coding and non coding
classes, a Perl program was developed to extract from the
contig sequence the coding regions, to split them into triplets based on the frame information and then to deduce
the codons based on the strand information. To determine whether the SNP induced an amino acid change, the
CodonTable from Bioperl was incorporated into the main
script.
