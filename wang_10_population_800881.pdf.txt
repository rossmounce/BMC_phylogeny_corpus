Abstract
Background: Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), one of the most ancient domesticated crops, is becoming
a model system for studying biofuel crops and comparative genomics in the grasses. However, knowledge on the
level of genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) is very limited in this crop and its wild ancestor, green
foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv.). Such information would help us to understand the domestication process of
cultivated species and will allow further research in these species, including association mapping and identification
of agricultural significant genes involved in domestication.
Results: In this study, we surveyed DNA sequence for nine loci across 50 accessions of cultivated foxtail millet and 34
of its wild progenitor. We found a low level of genetic diversity in wild green foxtail (θ = 0.0059), θ means
Watterson’s estimator of θ. Despite of a 55% loss of its wild diversity, foxtail millet still harbored a considerable level
of diversity (θ = 0.0027) when compared to rice and sorghum (θ = 0.0024 and 0.0034, respectively). The level of LD in
the domesticated foxtail millet extends to 1 kb, while it decayed rapidly to a negligible level within 150 bp in wild
green foxtail. Using coalescent simulation, we estimated the bottleneck severity at k = 0.6095 when r/θ = 1. These
results indicated that the domestication bottleneck of foxtail millet was more severe than that of maize but slightly
less pronounced than that of rice.
Conclusions: The results in this study establish a general framework for the domestication history of foxtail millet.
The low level of genetic diversity and the increased level of LD in foxtail millet are mainly caused by a population
bottleneck, although gene flow from foxtail millet to green foxtail is another factor that may have shaped the
pattern of genetic diversity of these two related gene pools. The knowledge provided in this study will benefit
future population based studies in foxtail millet.

Background
Plant domestication, which began approximately 10,000
years ago, is the most crucial development in human
history [1]. Domesticated crops provide most of our
food today, and provide the foundation for human civilization. Yet, only a small fraction of flowering plants
were actually domesticated. It will be of great benefit for
future crop breeding and improvement if we have a better understanding of the domestication process.

The evolutionary footprints left by domestication at
the population level are dispersed throughout the genome. Due to population bottlenecks, a large proportion
of genetic diversity is typically lost during the domestication process, as seen by a 25% reduction of diversity
in maize and an 80% reduction in rice [2,3]. In some
species like rice and sunflower, the transition of mating
system from outcrossing to self-fertilization can further
reduce the levels of genetic diversity [4,5]. Furthermore,
some selected loci exhibit a more dramatic loss in
genetic diversity [6]. In maize, the reduction in genetic
diversity is less than 20% for presumably neutral loci
like hm1, hm2, glb1, and sh1, but up to 80% for selected
loci like c1, ae1 and tb1 [7-11]. Elevated levels of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) are also observed in the genome of
domesticated plants [3,6,12]. This is caused by either the

domestication bottleneck and/or reduction of effective
recombination rate due to self-fertilization [5]. Additionally, selection can have a similar effect on LD in the target region [13]. Studies that focus on the level and
organization of genetic variation in these major crops
are essential for our understanding of the process of
domestication and are instructive for crop improvement
or other research that is based on these population
parameters, such as association mapping [2,12,14].
To study the patterns of genetic diversity within and
between populations, as well as to trace the demographic history of crops and their wild relatives, multilocus surveys of population sequence data have been
widely used in recent years [3,6,12,15]. Since selection
acts on some but not all genes in genome, a multilocus
sample increases the probability that both loci that are
under selection and those that are neutrally-evolving
will be sampled. Multi-locus sampling is also necessary
to understand the demographic history of populations,
and enables targets of natural or artificial selection to be
more reliably identified. Many studies have been carried
out to investigate nucleotide diversity in plants, yet only
a few have been focused on their demographic history.
Understanding the demographic history of populations
will also help in interpretation of population genetic
neutrality tests, which are based on the comparison of
observed and expected polymorphism patterns under
the neutral equilibrium model (NE) [16,17]. This model
assumes random outcrossing and a large stable population size, assumptions which may not be valid in many
domesticated crops [16]. Without a reliable knowledge
of the demographic history, it is hard to interpret the
statistical results of neutrality tests.
Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv) has been a
very important cereal since ancient times in Eurasia and
has contributed greatly to human civilization both in
Asia and Europe [18]. The most recent archaeological
evidence demonstrates that foxtail millet is one of the
most ancient crops as its domestication in China dates
back to 8,700 years ago [19]. With the rapid development of maize and other modern crops, foxtail millet
has gradually become a minor crop in the last 80 years,
but is nonetheless still widely cultivated in Asia, Europe,
North America, Australia and North Africa as grain
food or forage [20]. Green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.)
Beauv.), a weed distributed worldwide, is the presumed
wild progenitor of domesticated foxtail millet, based on
cytological evidence and RAPD, AFLP, and other markers [21,22]. But the number of domestication centers
and the age of domestication of foxtail millet remains
controversial [23]. As revealed by earlier studies, genetic
diversity is low in foxtail millet [24], yet these analyses
were based on genetic markers that only represent a
subset of the possible information that can be gained

regarding genomic polymorphism [16]. However,
research at the sequence level is very limited in foxtail
millet and its close relatives. although sequencing of the
foxtail millet genome is now nearly completed [25]. This
will provide another cereal model system for comparative and functional genomics and model for studying
other biofuel crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), and napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum). Studies
on domestication or other agricultural related characteristics are ongoing[26-28]. In this study, we conduct a
multilocus analysis of nucleotide variation in foxtail
millet and green foxtail to reveal the pattern of genetic
diversity within and between these two species and to
establish a population genetic framework for further
analysis of the effects of domestication in foxtail millet.

Results
Nucleotide diversity and neutrality test

We collected 50 cultivated foxtail millets and 34 wild
green foxtails to represent the broad diversity of these
two species (Table 1). Nine loci randomly selected from
the genome were used to survey genetic diversity from
both sspecies (Table 2& Additional file 1, Fig s1). The
alignment length of each locus after excluding gaps and
missing data varied from 431 bp to 996 bp. All nine loci
contained both coding and noncoding sequences. However, ninety percent of the final alignments were noncoding sequence because the primers were designed to
amplify a large proportion of intron fragments. A total
of 160 SNPs were found in the nine loci across the 84
accessions, with an average density of 52 bp/SNP. The
wild progenitor had more SNPs (147 SNPs with a density of 43 bp/SNP) compared to the cultivars (75 SNPs
with a density of 87 bp/SNP). Indel polymorphisms
were infrequent across loci and most had a small size of
1 to 3 basepairs. Three large indels were present in
ADTY (143 bp), UPL (112 bp) and TIFIIF (43) bp.
These indel polymorphisms were excluded from the
subsequent analysis.
The nucleotide diversity of the nine loci for each species is summarized in Table 3. For both θ and π, the
values for each locus were slightly lower than values for
silent sites, presumably due to strong functional constraint in coding regions. Considering individual loci,
the most variable gene was MDEH with a mean of 0.01
for θsil across all accessions. Compared to MDEH, PP2C
was the least variable site with a value of only 0.0016 for
θsil. At the taxon level, the diversity of wild green foxtail
(mean θsil 0.0059) was much higher than the domesticated foxtail millet (mean θsil 0.0027). On average, the
cultivars lost 55% of the diversity harbored by the wild
progenitor during the domestication process. Some loci
in cultivars, such as ADTY and PP2C, lost more than
86% and 75% of their diversity in the wild progenitor.

Under the assumption of a neutral equilibrium model,
the population silent diversity (θ sil ) and population
divergence (Ks) should be correlated with each other
across the loci. We calculated the Pearson correlation
between them to test if both species were under neutral
evolution. The correlation for wild species is high and
significant (pearson cor = 0.93, p value = 0.0001),
whereas it is not significant for the cultivar (pearson cor
= 0.32, p = 0.19). When excluding the most diverged
locus ADTY, significant positive correlations were found
in both wild (pearson cor = 0.89, p = 0.002) and cultivars species (pearson cor = 0.69, p = 0.03). The significant correlations suggested that most of loci were under
neutral evolution in both species, except for ADTY in

cultivars. This locus may be under directional selection
or influenced by a selective sweep on neighboring loci.
We used a series of neutrality tests to determine the fit
of our data to a neutral equilibrium model. Tajima’s D
and Fu and Li’s D* and F* were used to examine the allele
frequency spectrum in polymorphism data for each locus.
In the wild population, all the loci showed a negative
value for D, D* and F*. Two loci, SIGT and MDEH, had a
significant negative value for both tests. However, loci in
the cultivars exhibited positive values or less negative
values than the wild species for both tests except for
DACP and ADTY. The results were unsurprising since
we expected D to be higher when the species had experienced a recent population bottleneck[29]. The loss of low

frequency alleles during the bottleneck process will
increase the D for cultivars. On the other hand, a significant negative D value means the locus has an excess of
low frequency variants due to population size expansion
and/or purifying or directional selection. We also used a

multilocus HKA test to determine whether the level of
polymorphism and divergence were correlated across the
loci. A significant result was found when we used all nine

cultivars. The domesticated foxtail millet shared almost
75% of its polymorphism with green foxtail on average,
whereas the proportion for green foxtail was 36%. Unique
polymorphisms were present in both species, but the
number was much less in cultivars compared to the wild
species. Due to the nature of the domestication process,
we expected that the cultivars had lost much of their
diversity compared to its wild progenitor (55%). The
unique polymorphisms in the cultivars suggested that
new mutations occurred after domestication or that the
wild gene pool was insufficiently sampled.

deviation. Further analysis by removing ADTY showed
that no significant result was found across the loci
(X^2 = 6.92, p < 0.21).
Population divergence

The level of population differentiation of the two related
species was examined by the values of Fst and shared,
fixed and unique polymorphisms in the two species, as
well as the phylogenetic relationship of these accessions.
Fst varied from locus to locus with a mean of 0.1536
(Table 4). Although some loci, such as ADTY and UPL,
had Fst values over 0.40, the remaining loci were differentiated at a very low level with Fst values between
0.0254-0.1546. No fixed differences were detected
between the cultivars and their wild relatives. This was
consistent with a low divergence level due to the short
history of domestication. However, a high proportion of
shared polymorphisms were observed, particularly for the

The level of linkage disequilibrium measured as squared
allele-frequency correlations were plotted against the distance between pairwise SNPs (Figure 2). The regression
curves show that the decay of linkage disequilibrium
along the distance for the cultivars was much slower than
for the wild. The expected value of for wild green foxtail
dropped rapidly to 0.1 within 150 bp, whereas a much
higher level (> 0.1) extended to 1000 bp in foxtail millet.
Comparison of the population recombination rate, r, in
the two species implied that recombination was more frequent in the wild species (mean = 0.1497) than that in
the domesticated species (mean = 0.0329). Together with
the data of haplotype number and haplotype diversity
(table 3), the cultivar foxtail millet showed increased linkage disequilibrium level compared to the wild progenitor.

intervals 0-0.03 and 0-0.15. Using rejection algorithm, we
obtained 1000 samples from simulations. The posterior
distribution of θ, r and r/θ are shown in Figure 3. Compared with the mean values calculated from the sequence
data, values estimated by simulations were quite similar
for θ in both domesticated (0.0022) and wild species
(0.0053). However, the maximum posterior estimates of
r were not as large as observed data (r = 0.001, r/θ =
0.43 for the domesticated and r = 0.005 and r/θ = 0.836
for the wild). Since the sequence used in this study were
short, recombination that could be detected in such a
short distance would be rare. The method used for calculating recombination rates here may not give correct
values. We also found variations among loci for the
values of r (0-1.1713 for the cultivated and 0-0.2204 for
the wild). This method may over-estimate r for some
loci. We used a grid of values 0, 1, 2, 5, 10 for r/θ in the
later analysis, since previous studies showed that the level
of recombination had influence on posterior estimation
of parameters [30].
Bayesian inference of bottleneck process

Domestication process can be modeled by coalescent
simulation using a simple bottleneck model. The model
has been described in Maize, Rice, Wheat and other
crops, although for species such as Asian rice the
domestication scenario may be more complex[2,3,6,15].
In the bottleneck model, it was assumed that the
domesticated species experienced a reduction in population size in the initial of domestication state and then
the population size increased after the domesticated species were wildly distributed. We can use this model to
infer the domestication process based on population
structure and other known information. Upon the
assumption of the domestication model, a series of coalescent simulations were done to infer the parameters of
the bottleneck model. The parameters that need to be

Page 7 of 13

estimated were drawn from a uniform distribution with
a specific interval (t2 = 5000-15000, d = 100-3000, k =
0.1-10, m12 = 0-100, m21 = 0-100) (table 3). We did
simulations for r/θ = 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, respectively. As the
acceptance rates for simulations of r/θ > = 2 were very
low, we used a larger interval (60%) for the rejection
algorithm in these simulations. For each simulation, we
collected 10,000 samples using the rejection algorithm
with summary statistics of the wild species. Then the
samples were used to fit with summary statistics of the
cultivated species. The number of fitted samples used
for posterior prediction varied from 702 for r/θ = 1 to
2571 for r/θ = 2. The posterior distribution of t2, d,
M12 and M21 showed no large peak. However, the posterior distribution of the bottleneck intensity k did show
a clear peak and depended on the ratio of r/θ (Figure
4). The domestication bottleneck was more severe when
r/θ changed to large values. Since the ratio of r/θ estimated by Bayesian estimation in this study was 0.836,
the severity of the bottleneck for foxtail millet should be
similar to that of r/θ = 1 (0.6095). If the ratio of r/θ
was underestimated, the domestication process would
be much more intense. To further estimate the rate of
migration between the two species, we employed a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method as implemented in
MIMAR [31]. We ran 1.1e7 steps with 1e6 burnin steps
and considered convergence was reached when the posterior distribution of two independent chains were similar (Figure 5). The maximum estimated migration from
cultivar to wild is 0.3174, whereas the reverse process
was 0.1712.

Discussion
Sequence diversity

Previous studies based on isozymes and DNA markers
showed a high level of genetic diversity in foxtail millet
[32,33]. However, diversity at the DNA sequence level of

foxtail millet was not well documented and comparisons
with other crops, especially cereals, was absent. In this
study, nine loci were surveyed to investigate the genetic
diversity in foxtail millet and its wild progenitor green
foxtail at the DNA sequence level. We found a low level
of nucleotide variation in both foxtail millet and green
foxtail as compared with other domesticated crops and

their wild relatives, such as sunflower, barley, maize and
rice [3,6,12,34]. The silent nucleotide variation for green
foxtail estimated here was 0.0059, which was lower than
most of these wild crop relatives but higher than wild
soybean. Compared to other species, nucleotide variation indicated by θsil was higher in wild maize Zea mays
ssp. parviglumis (0.0247), wild sunflower Helianthus
annuus (0.0234), etc [3,6,12,34]. An exception was
found in wild soybean Glycine soja, which had a θsil as
low as 0.00235 [35]. Further investigation of these wild
relatives showed that most wild species with a higher
nucleotide variation have an outcrossing mating system,
while nucleotide variation was lower for inbreeding species, such as wild barley and wild soybean [34,36,37].
Green foxtail, as well as foxtail millet, are self-pollinated
plant that have a 0.3% to 4% outcrossing rate in natural
conditions [38,39]. Lower levels of nucleotide variation
in these wild species is expected by their mating system,
although the samples collected in this study may also
influence the estimation. This is because some wild
accessions may not represent a local original wild species but a weedy form that derived from the gene flow
between the cultivars and their wild relatives. However,
the underestimation influenced by sampling may have
been very limited because several accessions were collected in the areas where a weedy form was recognized.
The low level of genetic diversity of wild green foxtail
might be caused mainly by its high inbreeding rate and/
or other demographic factors, particularly changes in
population size. Consistent with its wild relatives, foxtail
millet also showed a lower level of silent nucleotide variation (0.0027). It was much lower than that of maize
(0.0149) or sunflower (0.0072), but similar to that of rice
(0.0024) and sorghum (0.0034) [3,6,12,40]. The domestication of maize, barley, soybean, and foxtail millet did
not involve changes in mating systems. However, the
mating system was changed from outcrossing to
inbreeding in rice and sunflower [3,12]. Based on this
information, we can conclude that the level of genetic
diversity of foxtail millet, which maintained 45% of its
wild diversity, was mainly a result of its change in population size during domestication process, followed by
mutation accumulated after divergence. To further
explore the impact of domestication on genetic diversity,
we used Tajima’s D test to detect the change of SNP
frequency in the species after domestication. As indicated by Tajima’ test, D values of most loci in domesticated species were higher than those of the wild species,
but only two of them had a positive D value. The
increase of D values in the domesticated species is likely
because low frequency alleles were preferentially lost
during the domestication bottleneck. Detailed site frequency spectra are shown in Figure 6. We detected an
excess in both low and high frequency alleles in the

rate, the LD level declined rapidly within 100-200 bp. In
contrast, LD in domesticated foxtail millet extended to
1000 bp. Based on the fact that the mating system did
not change after domestication of foxtail millet, and that
the influences of directional selection was likely focused
on a small proportion of local genomic regions, we suggest that the increased level of LD in the cultivated foxtail millet was mainly due to the change of population
size during the domestication process.
Gene flow between the domesticated and the wild

domesticated species compared to the wild one. The
excess of high frequency variants in the domesticated
species was also found in domesticated Asian rice [41].
Taking into account the higher level of LD in the
domesticated species, this may mean that artificial selection active during the domestication process may have
extended over a long distance. This phenomenon has
been observed for tb1 in maize and waxy in rice, that
the influence of directional selection on certain loci had
a large effect on regions around them [8,42].
Linkage disequilibrium

Several studies that focus on the domestication of crops
indicated that there was an increased level of linkage
disequilibrium in domesticated species as compared to
their wild relatives [3,12,43]. With the bottleneck effect
of domestication, the genome-wide level of nonrandom
association tends to increase. In some loci that were targeted by artificial selection, LD could extend to a long
distance up to 100 kb, such as tb1 in maize and waxy in
rice [8,42]. In addition to the influence of population
size and direction selection, mating system was also
shown to affect LD level [16]. In selfing Arabidopsis
thaliana, LD can persist for 250 kb. However, in outcrossing maize, LD declined to a very low level of less
than 1 kb [43,44]. Using the same set of sequences, it
was shown that the LD level in O. nivara was slightly
higher than that in O. rufipogon, which displayed a
higher rate of outcrossing compared to O. nivara [3]. In
this study, the higher level of LD observed in foxtail
millet compared with green foxtail was similar to what
has been observed in rice and sunflower [3,12]. In wild
species, which were shown to have a higher outcrossing

As indicated previously, foxtail millet maintained 45% of
its wild diversity. The proportion was similar with that of
sorghum (60-70%) and sunflower (40-59%) [12,40]. However diversity retention was higher in maize (80%) and
very low in rice (10-20%) [3,16]. The retention of wild
diversity is a reflection of the bottleneck intensity (such as
in rice) or the mating system (such as in maize). We used
coalescent simulation to infer the bottleneck severity during the domestication process. The Bayesian estimate of
bottleneck severity k was 0.6095 if we set r/θ = 1, which is
near the maximum estimate of r/θ. Compared with the
bottleneck severity that modeled in maize (2.45) and in
rice (0.2 for japonica and 0.5 for indica) [3,45], the severity
estimated here was compatible with the loss of diversity
from its wild relatives. We also incorporated gene flow
into a simulation model. The results suggested that there
were low levels of gene flow from the cultivated species to
wild species, but the reverse process was even smaller. As
foxtail millet and green foxtail can have low levels of
cross-pollination and the hybridization between them are
compatible [46], we expected that gene flow between the
two species would be frequent. By intensive human selection, alleles from wild relatives to cultivated foxtail millet
were mostly eliminated. But genes introgressed into the
wild species might be retained at a higher level, as evidenced by many weedy types morphologically similar to
foxtail millet in and around millet fields. This has became
a serious problem for field management. Taken together,
the population bottleneck and gene flow both contributed
to the present pattern of nucleotide diversity of these two
species.
Loci under selection in the domestication

Another factor in the domestication process is human
selection [16]. We intended to select nearly neutral loci
in order to make inferences about the domestication
process in this study. However, ADTY had a significant
negative D value in the domesticated species. This
observation, taken together with an 86% loss of diversity
compared to the wild type and a large deviation in the
HKA test, suggested that this locus was likely under
directional selection during domestication. We used the
estimated parameter of bottleneck severity to infer

Wang et al. BMC Genetics 2010, 11:90
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/11/90

whether this locus was under selection. Two loci were
detected to be under selection in this model, ADTY and
PP2C (p-value = 0.014 and 0.008). Except for a loss of
75% of its wild diversity, other statistical tests did not
show any signal of selection for PP2C, indicating that
the simulation may have given a false positive result for
this locus due to low diversity in both cultivated and
wild species. Furthermore, the model used to detect
selection may not be robust enough to give a result with
only a few false positive genes. The locus ADTY may be
a target gene of human selection or located in a selected
region. However, excluding this locus did not affect the
calculated parameters and the results of the simulation.
The whole genome sequence of foxtail millet will be
released very soon; and further work that focuses on
whole genome analysis of genes involved in domestication will likely indicate to what extent human selection
has acted in the domestication process.

Conclusions
We found a 55% loss of diversity in foxtail millet and an
increased level of LD that can be extended to 1 kb. This
phenomenon is likely to be caused by the small effective
population size due to a population bottleneck during
domestication. Low levels of gene flow from foxtail
millet to green foxtail may have been another factor
that influenced the genetic diversity of these two species.

of the genome. All EST sequences of Setaria italica
were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site http://ftp.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov. The EST set was used to search rice gene
models and only those with a single hit were retained
for further studies http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/. We
checked if the homologous region covers an intron in
the rice genome and designed primers to amplify the
intron.
The nine loci were amplified in the two species using
a modified PCR reaction system: 50 ng genomic DNA,
0.2 μmol/l of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1 U ExTaq
DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), 2 μl PCR mix buffer and
dH2O to a final volume of 20 μl. After amplification, the
products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2%
agarose gel. DNA bands were excised, purified, and
directly sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA
Sequencer. For individual with heterozygous alleles, It is
impossible to choose a true allele if it contains more
than one heterozygous polymorphism. By directly
sequencing the PCR product, the haplotype that was
chosen randomly may not be a true haplotype. However
both foxtail millet and green foxtail have a low outcross
rate, we expected that the influence of heterozygous
polymorphism on haplotype inference is very limit. Single base pair changes were further confirmed by PCR
and DNA sequencing.
Sequence analysis

Methods
Plant materials and DNA sequencing

We collected 84 accessions to survey DNA sequence
variation in this study, including 50 cultivated foxtail
millets and 34 wild green foxtails (Table 1). Accession
numbers started with PI or Ames were obtained from
the National Germplasm Resources Laboratory, Beltsville, Maryland, USA; others samples were from the
Chinese National Germplasm Bank in the Institute of
Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The cultivated materials were sampled to
represent a broad diversity of foxtail millet, in which all
Chinese accessions are landraces. The wild samples
were collected throughout the Eurasian continent
to cover the distribution range of green foxtail where
foxtail millet was claimed to have been domesticated
[23,24]. All the sample seeds were planted in autoclaved
soil and fresh leaves were collected to extract genomic
DNA using a modified CTAB protocol.
Genomic fragments between 500 and 1500 bp were
amplified and sequenced from nine unlinked loci (Table
2 and Additional file 1: figure S1). Based on the high
colinearity between the genetic map of foxtail millet and
rice [47], we used the rice genome sequence as a reference when selecting the loci so as to have wide coverage

The raw sequence trace files were collected and
assembled by Phred/Phrap [48,49]. Alleles of each locus
were aligned by ClustalW 1.81 with further manual
check [50]. All the alleles containing singletons were subject to a check process, in which we amplified and
sequenced the product again to confirm the sequence
quality and update the alignment. The alignment files
were imported to DnaSP 4.5 with coding regions assigned
according to the rice gene annotation [51]. For each locus
and species, we calculated the number of segregating
sites (S), the population recombination rate (r), minimum number of recombination events (Rm), number of
haplotypes (Hap), haplotype diversity (Hdiv), average
number of nucleotide difference per site between two
sequences (π), and the watterson estimator of population
mutation rate (θ). To test for neutrality, we calculated
Tajima’s D [52], and D* and F* of Fu and Li [53] test
without outgroup. To access the level of species divergence, we calculated shared, fixed, species-specific S and
Fst for the two species. Multilocus HKA test was done by
HKA http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~heylab/ for the nine loci
and the results was parsed to R for further analysis [54].
The decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with physical
distance was described using a nonlinear regression analysis. The expected value of squared allele-frequency

correlations (r2 ) at drift-recombination equilibrium is,
E(r 2
) = 1/(1 + r) where r is 4Nc and N is the effective
population size, c is the recombination rate in Morgans
between the 2 markers. Under the assumption of a low
mutation rate and finite sample size, the expectation
becomes

where n is the sample size of sequences [55]. To introduce the distance between pairs of SNP sites (d) into the
formula, we use rho*d to replace r, in which rho is the
recombination rate per basepair. r 2 between pairs of
polymorphism was estimated using DnaSP 4.5 for each
locus and species. r2 and d were pooled across the loci
for each species. The nonlinear regression analysis was
performed with the NLS function in the R statistical
package http://www.r-project.org.
Coalescent simulation

Coalescent simulation was used to model the process of
domestication, as well as to estimate the population
mutation rate θ and population recombination rate r for
each species. The simulations were done using Hudson’s
ms [56]. In each simulation, we used an rejection-based
approximate Bayesian computation approach to obtain a
posterior distribution for parameters of interest [57,58].
Briefly, the initial values of parameters were drawn from
a user-specified prior distribution, and, starting with
these parameters, the simulation was run under a
defined model; For each simulated datasets, several summary statistics were calculated and compared with the
observed values. The data was accepted if it was within
a defined interval of observed data; and then the parameter set that generated acceptable data were used to
obtain a posterior distribution for each parameter. In
this study, we used a multilocus approach to assess the
acceptability of the data. Summary statistics were calculated for each locus and summarized by mean and/or
variance across the loci. The values of mean and/or variance of each summary statistics were compared
between simulated and observed data using. The
accepted datasets were used for Baysian inference of selceted parameters. Doing this incorporates the variation
among the loci into the simulations.
Approximate Bayesian estimate of θ and r/θ

To estimate θ and r, the simulations were run under the
standard neutral model for the wild and domesticated species separately. The means for each four summary statistics (S, π, Hap, Hdiv) were used to access the acceptable of

the simulated data. The data was accepted if three of them
were within 20% of the observed data [59].
Approximate Bayesian inference of bottleneck parameters

The model used to investigate the bottleneck process
was similar as described for maize and rice [3,6,45]: Na
is the effective population size of the ancestor of the
two species.μis the mutation rate for the ancestor. The
values of μ were based on the synonymous substitution
rate or calculated by θ = 4Nμ. The recombination rate r
together with Na and μ defined the ancestor population.
At time t2 generations ago, a new population was
derived from the ancestor with a population size of Nb
and expanded to a population with a size of N p at t1
generations ago. Then, the ancestor population and the
newly derived population evolved with constant population size until present. To incorporate gene flow in this
model, we defined M12 to be migration rate from wild
to cultivar and M21 for the rate for the reverse rate. In
this model, the parameters for the wild and domesticated species were calculated by the sequence or estimated using an approximate Bayesian estimate. We
defined k to be the ratio of Nb and d, d being the duration of the bottleneck in generations (d = t2-t1). Previous studies suggested that Nb is positively correlated
with d; k is a good indicator for the stringency of the
bottleneck [3,6].
Under this model, we used the mean and variance for
each four summary statistics (S, π, Hap, Hdiv) to assess
the acceptability of simulated wild species data. The
simulation was accepted if both the mean and variance
fell within 30% of the observed data. To fit the cultivated data, we use the mean of S, r, Hap, and Hdiv to
assess the fitness of the simulated data, but we accepted
if three of the four fell within 30% of the observed data.
