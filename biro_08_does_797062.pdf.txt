Abstract
Background: There is a 3-fold redundancy in the Genetic Code; most amino acids are encoded
by more than one codon. These synonymous codons are not used equally; there is a Codon Usage
Bias (CUB). This article will provide novel information about the origin and evolution of this bias.
Results: Codon Usage Bias (CUB, defined here as deviation from equal usage of synonymous
codons) was studied in 113 species. The average CUB was 29.3 ± 1.1% (S.E.M, n = 113) of the
theoretical maximum and declined progressively with evolution and increasing genome complexity.
A Pan-Genomic Codon Usage Frequency (CUF) Table was constructed to describe genome-wide
relationships among codons. Significant correlations were found between the number of
synonymous codons and (i) the frequency of the respective amino acids (ii) the size of CUB.
Numerous, statistically highly significant, internal correlations were found among codons and the
nucleic acids they comprise. These strong correlations made it possible to predict missing
synonymous codons (wobble bases) reliably from the remaining codons or codon residues.
Conclusion: The results put the concept of "codon bias" into a novel perspective. The internal
connectivity of codons indicates that all synonymous codons might be integrated parts of the
Genetic Code with equal importance in maintaining its functional integrity.

Background
The genetic code is redundant: 20 amino acids plus start
and stop signals are coded by 64 codons. This redundancy
increases the resistance of genes to mutation: the third
codon letters (wobble bases) can often be interchanged
without affecting the primary sequence of the protein
product. Nevertheless, wobble base usage is highly conserved in mRNA sequences (there is no or very little individual or intra-species variation) and, interestingly, some
wobble mutations (though they are called silent mutations) are known to cause genetic disease with no change
in the amino acid sequences [1].
However, the wobble bases are not randomly selected, as
they might be if interchangeability were unrestricted.

There is codon bias, i.e. codon usage is not equally distributed between the possible synonyms; some redundant
codons are preferentially used. This bias is described in
Codon Usage Frequency (CUF) Tables [2].
Many studies confirm the existence of codon bias and significant correlations have been found between codon bias
and various biological parameters such as gene expression
level [3-6] gene length [7-9], gene translation initiation
signal [10], protein amino acid composition [11], protein
structure [12,13], tRNA abundance [14-17], mutation frequency and pattern, [18,19] and GC composition [20-23].
These observations may not be universally valid because
some statistically significant observations in one species

are not reproduced in another. However, there is a strong
expectation that codon bias, which is obviously well conserved in different species, reflects a general biological
function because of the universal nature of the Genetic
Code and the structure and function of nucleic acids and
proteins.
The aim of this study is to investigate the possible origin
of so-called "codon bias", measure it quantitatively and
compare it among many species.

Materials and methods
Codon Usage Frequency (CUF) Tables were obtained for
113 different organisms from the Codon Usage Database
(NCBI-GenBank, update: November 16, 2006 [24]). The
organisms were selected from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes, [25]) and represented a wide variety of species from different evolutionary lines [Additional file 1].

CUBij =| CUFij − rCUFij |

and

64

CUB =

∑| CUF

ij

− rCUFij | (%)

i =1

More simply, CUB is the absolute number of fractional
frequencies minus the number expected if usage of synonymous codons was uniform.
CUB may be used in some cases with its +/- orientation
indicated. In these cases, positive values indicate over-utilization of a codon (e.g. dominant codons) while negative
values indicate under-utilization (suppression).
CUBmin = 0 if CUFij = rCUFij and the Calculated Maximal
Possible CUBmax is 2416.7%. This is the value when only
one of all the possible synonymous codons is used (100%
frequency) for every amino acid and for the stop signal.

To calculate Codon Usage Bias (CUB) numerically, I
assumed that statistically equal usage of all available synonymous codons is the neutral "starting point" for the
development of species-specific codon usages, and the
CUB is the sum of the deviations from such random,
equal usage.

Further explanation of the CUB calculation is given in
[Additional file 2], together with an example. CUFij (%) is
not to be confused with a "regular" codon frequency
(CUFi), which indicates the frequency of a codon in the
entire genome (all 21 fractions) and is usually given in the
CUF Tables in #/1000 units.

The codons (i, 64) were divided into 21 subgroups (j, corresponding to the 20 amino acids and 1 stop signal). The
number of occurrences of a codon was normalized and
the frequencies of the codons (CUFij) in each fraction
were calculated. The sum of CUFif in a fraction was always
treated as 100% so the sum of all fractions was 2100%. ni
is the number of synonymous codons in the jth fraction
and nj = 64

The definition of CUB in this article is not directly comparable to other widely used definitions such as CUI.

i =1

CUFij = 100 (%)

j=1

CUFij is the frequency (%) of the ith codon in the jth fraction encoded by ni synonymous codons.
These fractional frequencies were compared to the random fractional frequencies (rCUFij), defined as the fractional frequency that a codon would have if all alternative
codons were used randomly and equally.
rCUF(1j) = rCUF(2j) = rCUF(n)j = rCUF(ij) = 100/ni (%)
The sum of rCUF in a fraction is also 100% and in each
fraction altogether is 2100%.

Results
Quantitative evaluation of codon bias
CUB = 0% when all available synonymous codons are
equally used. The maximal calculated bias, CUBmax =
100%, indicates that only one codon is used for each
amino acid (and for the stop signal), while the remaining
43 codons are not used at all. I calculated CUB in 113 species and found that the average value is 29.3 +/- 1.1%
(S.E.M, n = 113). There seems to be a modest but significant decrease in the bias during evolution: bacteria and
archeoata have the highest bias while vertebrates have the
lowest. Eukaryotes have significantly lower CUB than
prokaryotes. Humans have the lowest value (18.9%) (Figure 1).

There is a slight negative correlation between the size of
the codon- and gene-pool of an organism and its CUB (p
< 0.01, n = 113, not shown). The size and complexity of
both genome and proteome increase with evolution,
while the CUB decreases. A larger codon pool seems to
utilize more codon variation, which leads to lower differences between the usage frequencies of synonymous
codons.

CUB is defined as the absolute difference between CUF
and rCUF:-

Qualitative evaluation of CUB
Detailed analysis of different species reveals wide variations in CUB (Figure 2). There is a seemingly random variation in CUB between amino acids and different groups of
organisms. However, a comparison of closely-related species with large codon pools shows very similar patterns.
For example, all mammals have very similar CUB patterns.
Pan-genomic codon usage
I accumulated the CUF data from the 113 species into a
single CUF Table (Table 1). This Table is intended to give
a virtual representation of all organisms (Pan-Genome)
and a numerical representation of the "universal" translation machinery. As many as 288 × E10 codons are represented in this collection. The distribution of CUB values
in the Pan-Genomic CUF Table is illustrated in Figure 3.
The transition from maximum-positive to maximum-negative values is smooth and there is no obvious or unambiguous border between the so-called dominant and
prohibited codons. All possible codons are used.

There is a significant positive correlation between the
number of synonymous codons (ni, #/amino acid) and
the propensity of amino acids in the proteome (#/1000
amino acid residues). A similar correlation exists between

synonymous codon frequency and CUB (Figure 4). These
important correlations were discovered by analyzing the
Pan-Genomic CUF Table (64 values) and were confirmed
using individual data from all species (113 × 21 values).
Another possible way to evaluate the possible phylogenetic relationships among CUBs in different species is to
use the Pan-Genomic CUB Table as a common reference.
I performed correlation analyses and compared the lists of
species-specific CUB values to the list of mean CUB values
in the Pan-Genomic CUB Table (64 × 113 comparisons),
then used the significance of correlations as an indicator
of CUB distances [Additional file 3].
I found that the CUB of vertebrates is most similar (least
distant) to the average CUB, while bacteria and viruses are
most distant from it. This correlation analysis involves all
codons and gives no information about the development
of individual CUBs. I therefore compared the codon-specific CUB values in the 113 species to obtain a rough estimate of the stability of (commitment to) a CUB through
evolution. The mean/SD of the 113 amino acid-specific
CUB values gives a good estimate how this stability
(Figure 5).

means that codon usage changes in a subgroup of the 64
codons will be accompanied by changes in the opposite
direction in the remaining codons.
I sorted the CUB values (64 × 113 = 7,232 listed in total)
in the Pan-Genomic CUB Table according to their sizes
and +/- directions [Additional file 4]. This sorting divided
the 64 codons (c) into two subgroups (Ac and Bc) and the
113 species (s) into two additional groups (As and Bs).
The Ac-As and Bc-Bs subgroups contained predominantly
over-represented (positive CUB) codons and are located
in the opposite diagonal corners of the Table. The Ac-Bs
and Bc-As fields contained predominantly under-represented (negative CUB) codons and are located in the other
opposite diagonal corners of the Table.
There is an internal inverse relationship between codons,
which is valid and the same for all species. This inverse
relationship is shown in a compressed and simplified
form in Figure 6a, b.

Figure 5
Estimation of Codon Commitment
Estimation of Codon Commitment. The mean ± SD values of CUB were calculated for the 64 codons (n = 113). The
mean/SD*100 values were regarded as the measure of a codon's commitment to a given CUB through evolution. Very low (-)
values indicate strong negative CUB (under-utilization of that codon) while the meaning of high (+) values is the opposite. The
codon commitment value reflects the propensity towards over-utilized codons (positive CUB). A: individual values, B: correlation analyses.

Negative correlations were expected between some subgroups of CUBs and others in the same species. Surprisingly, however, all codons and all species belong to only
2 clusters with highly correlated, opposite dynamics.

Internal relationship among codon bases in codon usage tables
Codons are defined by 3 nucleotides. Therefore, CUF
Tables can be further analyzed as Nucleotide Usage Frequency (NUF) Tables.

The above figures indicate that there is a close internal and
inverse correlation between the CUBs of different codons.
The magnitude and orientation of a CUB shows wide variation between species. Our collection of 113 species is
too limited for any conclusion about the phylogenetic
rules of development of CUB to be drawn, but the first
impression is an absence of phylogenetic rules:

The 113 CUF Tables in our material are based on 288 million codons and 690 K CDS. The number of codons in this
collection is enough to provide reliable information
about the general rules, if any, that determine nucleotide
ratios and correlations in genomes.

- about half the species under-utilize about half the
codons, while the other half show the opposite behavior
in respect of the remaining codons.
- It is difficult to find a correlation between CUB and
taxon boundaries. All mammals (in the table) show a
homogenous CUB pattern, while other taxa are much
more diverse.
- Most codons show a wide pangenomic variation in CUB,
but some vary much less than others (Figure 5). Some
codons (TAG, GGG, CGA, CTA) are under-utilized by
more than 80% of the 113 species listed, i.e. these synonymous codons have become committed to a given CUB
orientation while others have not. There is a significant
negative correlation between the proportion of codons
committed to a given CUB orientation and the extent to
which CUB varies (also apparent in Figure 5).

There are some highly significant correlations among
codon bases. The fractional frequency of each nucleotide
base in every codon position correlates positively with its
complementary codon (Table 2).
The sum of both complementary codon pairs (A+T and
G+C) in every codon position is positively correlated to
the sum of the same codon pair in the other two codon
positions (Table 3). These correlations are valid for every
species.
This strong positional correlation between codon bases
suggests that it is possible to predict the frequency of
usage of a nucleotide in the codon usage table from the
frequencies of other nucleotides. Predictions regarding
the third nucleotides in codons are especially interesting,
because these are wobble bases for most amino acid
codons.

ther strong support for the view that the genetic code is the
result of development and not at all a "frozen accident".
Correlation between individual codons
The detection of a strong internal pangenomic relationship among codons in the CUF Tables and the positional
correlation among the base residues of these codons led to
an even deeper correlation analysis. The correlations
between every single codon frequency and every other
codon frequency (64 × 64/2 = 2,048) were calculated
using linear regression analysis [Additional file 5].

Further detailed analysis of the internal positional correlations between codons and codon bases revealed significant correlations between different codons, which are
generally valid for every species in our collection.
I noticed that there is a pattern of positive/negative correlations in these tables corresponding to the codon letters
and their positions in the codon. The general rules of this
pattern are summarized in Figure 8.

Figure 6
Species Dependent Internal Correlation between CUBs
Species Dependent Internal Correlation between
CUBs. Codon usage biases (CUBs) from 113 species were
sorted as described in the text and divided into 11 consecutive subgroups. Each symbol represents the mean of CUB
values from 10 different species. The values were sorted for
species subgroups (A) and for codons (B). Only some representative samples are included (4 codons of total 64 and 3
groups of different species of total 11).

I used the correlation between the sum of complementary
codon pairs in the 1st and 2nd codon positions to predict
the wobble bases using the frequencies for 113 different
species (Table 4, Figure 7). This is of course a prediction of
the frequencies of the four wobble bases in all 64 possible
codons and has no predictive value for individual wobble
bases belonging to individual amino acids. All these correlation were of course carefully compared to corresponding random controls. Care was taken to ensure that the
randomized control samples had the same size and distribution as the test samples. The sum of randomized fractions was kept equal to 1, as in the test samples. There
were no correlations between the corresponding nucleotides in the control samples.
This simple but highly significant and species-independent positional relationship between NUFs provides fur-

There is a simple rule regarding codon correlations in the
pangenome: there are positive correlations between complementary nucleotides and negative correlations
between non-complementary nucleotides. This pattern of
correlations is statistically significant in most combinations of nucleotide positions in codons. The correlations
are statistically most significant between nucleotides in
the 3rd codon positions.
Prediction of individual wobble bases
I used these correlations to predict individual wobble
bases (all 64) from the 1st and 2nd letters of the codons (all
64). The possible correlations between a codon and the
16 possible permutations of the 4 1st and 2nd codon letters
(64 × 4 × 4 = 1024) are listed in [Additional file 6].
Accuracy of codon predictions
I used the strongest correlations [Supplementary File 6] to
predict codon frequencies, and the mean of several predictions was used as the averaged predicted value (p). Four
different approaches were used to evaluate the predictions
quantitatively.

The correlation between real (r) and predicted (p) values
belonging to the same codons was significant (p < 0.05)
in 54 cases but not the other 10 (Figure 9a).
The correlation between real (r) and predicted (p) values
belonging to the same species was significant (p < 0.05) in
all 113 cases and The p value was below 10E-07 in all but
2 species (Figure 9b).
The average accuracy of individual CUF predictions in 113
species and 87 individual proteins was estimated by comPage 8 of 15

a.) some (few) signs of the evolutionary origin and development of CUB;
b.) unexpectedly large number of highly significant intern
correlations between different codon residues (bases) at
different codon positions (first, central, wobble) as well as
between individual codons.

Discussion
There are basically two approaches to measuring CUB.
First, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values
can be calculated [5]. RSCU is the observed number of
codon occurrences divided by the number expected if synonymous codons were used uniformly. Second, the relative merits of different codons can be assessed from the
viewpoint of translational efficiency. This second
approach led to the development of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI, [6]). The CAI model assigns a parameter,
termed 'relative adaptiveness', to each of the 61 codons
(stop codons excluded). The relative adaptiveness of a
codon is defined as its frequency relative to the most
often-used synonymous codons and is computed from a
set of highly expressed genes. The CAI is widely used even
though the subjectivity involved in selecting the reference
codons is well recognized [26,27].
My way of calculating CUB is very close to the original suggestion
[5] and regards uniform codon usage as the "null hypothesis";
any deviation from this is the bias. This approach made it possible to avoid subjectivity and species limitations in choosing the
reference set of codons, and I can build the concept of CUB on the
massive foundation of statistical laws and the large collection of
sequence data collected in Codon Usage Frequency Tables.
The origin and biological significance of CUB is not well
understood, therefore I tried to find the rules (if any) of its
evolutionary development and gain new insights about its
possible function. I sort my findings into two main categories: I found

Inter-species variation in CUB is about 10%, but it is obvious that prokaryotes have significantly larger CUBs than
eukaryotes. Bacteria may show the greatest bias because
these primitive organisms are rich in highly-expressed
genes and often use only one dominant codon. CUB
decreases progressively with evolution and humans have
the lowest bias (only about 20%). Evolutionary increase
in codon number and genome complexity seems to
reduce the CUB. It is noticeable that the average CUB
(29.3 ± 1.1% (S.E.M.) n = 113) means that synonymous
codon usage frequencies are 29.3% distant from the "all
codons are equally good" hypothesis, and 70.7% distant
from the "one codon is the best 'codon" alternative.
A more detailed qualitative analyzes of CUB is possible
using a pan-genomic CUF Table. The original purpose of
this virtual table was to create a reference for comparison
of CUBs, but it turned out to reveal other codon-related
connections too. The pan-genomic CUF Table is based on
only 113 species, so it might be the first but not the last of
its kind. It makes it possible to detect major, universal
trends in codon usage behind small individual (or even
species-wide) variations.
CUB is often correlated to the intensity of translation and
has even been used to predict highly-expressed genes [6].
It is also known to be related to tRNA copy number, and
co-evolution of tRNA gene composition and codon usage
bias in genomes has been suggested [28]. I found a very
strong correlation between the number of synonymous

codons and the frequency of the amino acids they
encoded, as well as the CUB. More synonymous codons
encode more amino acids of the same kind and cause
greater bias. This (rather logical) connection is not

described in the literature, probably because the definition of CUB is very different from mine.
I tried to define a kind of "phylogenetic tree" of CUBs
using the pan-genomic CUF table as reference. The significance of correlations between species-specific CUF and
pan-genomic CUF gave a qualitative, theoretical measure
of distances between codon usages. However this correlation-based approach did not successfully detect any recognizable, species-related evolutionary pattern.
Estimation of codon commitments through evolution
showed that some codons are clearly over-utilized while
other are avoided in most species. This finding is compatible with the concept of dominant and suppressed codons,
but without stating that this difference is the result of evolution [29].

idues (bases) at any two other codon positions (also first,

The non-randomness of synonymous codon usage is
widely accepted today, and it has been suggested that
independent forces (such as tRNA pool size [30]) have a
role in the reading frame and there are contextual constraints on synonymous codon choice [31-33].

- Correlation between A+T, G+C frequencies at the 1st, 2nd
codon positions and A+T, G+C frequencies at the 3rd

Other lines of evidence suggest that the Genetic Code
itself (the 64 codons in toto as a system) has an inherited,
internal structure [34,35]. Statistical studies on the nucleotide compositions of codons and of different codon
positions support this concept [36-41].

There seems to be a simple rule behind all these statistically significant correlations: the correlation between any two
nucleotides at any two codon positions is positive if the two
nucleotides are complementary to each other and negative if
they are not (illustrated in Figure 8).

I searched for the origin end development of codon bias
and I found an extensive network of internal correlations
between codons of a species and the nucleotides that
define them. The correlations described in this article are:

The large number of statistically highly significant correlations made it possible to predict the frequencies of synonymous codons (in 113 species and 87 individual proteins)
from the general overall frequencies of codons. The reliability of predictions was tested.

- Correlation between the frequency of any single codon
residue (base) at any codon position (first, central, wobble) and the frequency of any other single codon residue

- Correlation between the sum of frequencies of any two
codon residues (bases) at any two codon positions ((first,
central, wobble) and the sum of any two other codon res-

- Correlations between any two codons.

Conclusion
The cumulative Codon Usage Frequency of any codon is
strongly dependent on the cumulative Codon Usage Frequency of other codons belonging to the same species.
The rules of this codon dependency are the same for all
species and reflect WC base pair complementarity. This
internal connectivity of codons indicates that all synonymous codons are integrated parts of the Genetic Code

Calculation of Codon Usage Bias (CUB) – Explanation and Example.
The 64 codons were sorted in to 21 subgroups (fractions) corresponding
to the 20 coded amino acids and the stop signal. The sum of synonymous
codon frequencies were always regarded as 100% i.e. the sum of all codon
frequencies is 2100% (color coded columns). The fractional frequency
(CUFij %) of a synonymous codon is the contribution of that codon to this
100%. The theoretical, natural frequencies of the synonymous codons is
regarded as equal to each other (for example the natural fractional frequency of each synonymous codon of Arg is 100%/6 = 16.7%). The difference between this theoretical (calculated) frequency and the real
(counted) fractional frequency of a codon is the CUBij %. However it is
necessary to use the |CUBij %| value instead to be able to calculate and
compare the total CUB values of entire proteins (i.e. the sum of 64 CUB
values). A theoretical extreme case of codon usage is when only one of all
synonymous codons is used (CUB% 1 max column). The maximal possible CUB of all codons will in this case be 2416.7%, which is regarded as
the CUFmax. In the real case of Homo sapiens the sum of fractional frequencies is 456, which is 18.9% of the theoretical CUBmax.

CUB commitment and variation. The 64 codons in 113 species were
sorted according to the size and +/- orientation of their CUB. Some manual adjustments were made to segregate the data into four approximately
symmetrical subgroups (corresponding to the color codes).

CUF- Pan-Genomic Codon Correlations. Codon frequencies were collected from 113 Codon Usage Frequency Tables and the significances of
correlations (C, 64 × 64) were calculated. (n = 113). The table displays
the -log C values. A – sign was added to the -log C value to indicate negative correlations. Significant positive correlations (values > 2) are indicated by bold numbers and gray background, while significant negative
correlations (values < -2) are indicated by italic numbers and pink background. The collected data are sorted into 4 × 4 × 3 × 3 = 144 different
subgroups corresponding to the 4 × 4 codon letter combinations and the 3
× 3 codon positions (red letters).

Prediction of Wobble Bases. List of correlations between the frequency of
a codon and the frequency of other codons, which contain the 4 × 4 permutations of codons at the 1st and 2nd codon positions. 64 times 16 equations were calculated from these correlations. Only the strongest
correlations, those used in codon predictions, are listed and color coded.
Positive correlations are indicated by bold letter in blue background and
negative correlations are given by italic letters in pink background. F is as
defined in fig. 9.
