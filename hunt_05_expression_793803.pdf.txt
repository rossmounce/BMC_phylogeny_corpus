Abstract
Background: The mosaic sperm protein zonadhesin (ZAN) has been characterized in mammals
and is implicated in species-specific egg-sperm binding interactions. The genomic structure and
testes-specific expression of zonadhesin is known for many mammalian species. All zonadhesin
genes characterized to date consist of meprin A5 antigen receptor tyrosine phosphatase mu
(MAM) domains, mucin tandem repeats, and von Willebrand (VWD) adhesion domains. Here we
investigate the genomic structure and expression of zonadhesin-like genes in three species of fish.
Results: The cDNA and corresponding genomic locus of a zonadhesin-like gene (zlg) in Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar) were sequenced. Zlg is similar in adhesion domain content to mammalian
zonadhesin; however, the domain order is altered. Analysis of puffer fish (Takifugu rubripes) and
zebrafish (Danio rerio) sequence data identified zonadhesin (zan) genes that share the same domain
order, content, and a conserved syntenic relationship with mammalian zonadhesin. A zonadhesinlike gene in D. rerio was also identified. Unlike mammalian zonadhesin, D. rerio zan and S. salar zlg
were expressed in the gut and not in the testes.
Conclusion: We characterized likely orthologs of zonadhesin in both T. rubripes and D. rerio and
uncovered zonadhesin-like genes in S. salar and D. rerio. Each of these genes contains MAM, mucin,
and VWD domains. While these domains are associated with several proteins that show prominent
gut expression, their combination is unique to zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes in vertebrates.
The expression patterns of fish zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes suggest that the reproductive
role of zonadhesin evolved later in the mammalian lineage.

Background
Molecules that are directly involved in reproduction are
often subject to rapid evolutionary change [1]. Zonadhesin (ZAN) is one such molecule that has undergone

domain expansion [2,3] and positive selection [4,5] in
mammals. ZAN is a multi-domain sperm protein that is
implicated in the species-specific binding of egg and
sperm. Porcine (Sus scrofa) ZAN was first described by

Hardy et al. [6] as a protein expressed by developing
sperm that would bind to the zona pellucida of the egg.
Since its initial discovery, zonadhesin has been identified
in several other mammals, including mouse, human [2]
and rabbit [7]. Recent data suggest the processed zonadhesin localizes to the acrosomal matrix and binds the
zona pellucida during the acrosome reaction [8].

est relative to mammalian zonadhesin is FCGBP and this
similarity is mostly seen in the TIL and VWD domains.
FCGBP is expressed in the mucosa of the small and large
intestines, epithelial colon cells and the placenta and is
thought to play a role in the mucosal immune system
through the promotion of multivalent IgG and the trapping of antigen IgG complexes in the mucosa [18-20].

The discrete domains of mosaic proteins are known to be
important in the evolution of new genes. Domain subunits can be rearranged, duplicated or deleted to produce a
variety of proteins with different functions [9]. Zonadhesin structure is unique in its combination of protein
domains. All mammalian zonadhesin genes are predicted
to encode: a signal peptide, a multiple meprin A5 antigen
receptor tyrosine phosphatase mu (MAM) domain, multiple trypsin-like inhibitor (TIL) domains, multiple von
Willebrand D (VWD) cell adhesion domains, multiple
hepta-peptide repeats that form the mucin domain, multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, a single
transmembrane domain and short intracellular domain at
the carboxyl terminus. The domain order is the same for
all mammals studied, with the main difference being the
number of MAM and VWD domains. These individual
domains each have a particular function and are found in
many other mosaic proteins.

The 170 amino acid MAM domain distinguishes zonadhesin from other VWD and mucin repeat containing genes
such as FCGBP. MAM domains have adhesive function
and are found in several proteins including protein-tyrosine phosphatases, neuropilins and meprins. Meprins are
metalloendopeptidases that have been found in the intestinal brush border and renal membranes of mammals
[21]. While their role in the zonadhesin protein is
unknown, MAM domains are important for multimerization [22] and have conserved cysteine residues that are
responsible for covalent interactions [23].

The extracellular VWD domain occurs in a family of
immediate-early genes that are growth regulators and is
thought to have an adhesive function. This modular
domain is found in a variety of mosaic proteins including
von Willebrand factor [10], apolipoprotein B, vitellogenins, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)
[11], and mucins [12]. Biochemical studies of pig zonadhesin have shown that the ZAN precursor is processed and
the MAM domains are removed leaving the VWD domain
to interact with the zona pellucida [13]. While the role of
the VWD in sperm-egg binding has been addressed, the
role of the mucin-repeats and the MAM domains is still
unknown.
The mucin or MUC domain is the primary functional
domain of mucin proteins. Mucins are a diverse group of
heavily glycosylated proteins that are the major component of mucus. Mucins function to lubricate surfaces and
are the first line of defence against pathogens [14]. Most
of the secreted mucins contain a domain with sequence
similarity to VWD and a domain composed of a variable
number of tandem repeats that code for serine-, threonine- and proline-rich repeat peptides that are potential
glycosylation sites [15]. Two mucin-like genes that are
similar to zonadhesin include alpha-tectorin, which is
involved in non-syndromical autosomal dominant hearing impairment [16,17], and Fc fragment of IgG binding
protein (FCGBP). By virtue of sequence identity, the clos-

When this study began, zonadhesin expression had only
been described in the testes. Only zonadhesin was
thought to encode MAM domains, mucin repeats, and
VWD domains and no non-mammalian zonadhesin
orthologs had been reported. For these reasons we were
interested in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) zonadhesinlike ESTs from a gut-derived library that encoded the
MAM, mucin and VWD domains. Here we describe the
cDNA, genomic structure, and expression patterns of this
Atlantic salmon zonadhesin-like gene. We also use comparative genomic and expression analyses to uncover
additional zonadhesin-like genes, as well as orthologs of
zonadhesin, in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and puffer fish
(Takifugu rubripes).

Results and discussion
Characterization of a zonadhesin-like gene in S. salar
A gene similar to mammalian zonadhesin was identified
during an expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of Atlantic salmon. We assembled this zonadhesin-like gene (zlg)
from five overlapping ESTs [24]; the largest of which
[GenBank: CK990464] was sequenced by primer walking
from both directions and assembled to give a 4388 bp
sequence. PCR primers were designed to the 3'-end of the
EST and used to amplify a probe for hybridization to
Atlantic salmon genomic DNA and bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) library filters (Probe 1, Figure 1A).

Probing of 91,776 BAC clones on five Atlantic salmon
genome BAC library filters [25] resulted in one positive
BAC. This BAC (722P12) was subcloned, sequenced, and
assembled into a 138,345 base pair contiguous sequence
[GenBank: AY785950]. The assembly had more than
3000 high quality sequence reads and 10 fold sequence
coverage in most regions. One gap of 500 bp was filled by

Expression of the Atlantic salmon zlg mRNA. A) Expression of the zonadhesin-like gene was analyzed in a variety of tissues. Ten micrograms of total RNA from liver, brain, spleen, kidney, midgut, hindgut, foregut and gonads from male and female
Atlantic salmon was blotted on a positively charged nylon membrane and hybridized with radiolabeled probe 1 representing
the 3'-end of the Atlantic salmon zlg mRNA. B) Analysis of the Atlantic salmon zlg tissue expression pattern by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Zlg primers ('probe 1' primer set) were used to test for the presence of the zlg cDNA. The EST
to which the primers were designed [GenBank: CK990464] and BAC 722P12 were used as positive controls. The genomic
region encompassed by the primers contains two introns of 395 and 441 bp yielding a 1219 bp band upon amplification. C)
Ubiquitin primers were used as a positive control for mRNA presence. zlg (ZAN neg) and ubiquitin (Ubi neg) template-free
negative controls were included.

Alignment of zebrafish BACs to the linkage group 7 of the ZV4 whole genome shotgun assembly
Alignment of zebrafish BACs to the linkage group 7 of the ZV4 whole genome shotgun assembly. Approximately
600 Kb of the zonadhesin locus from the ZV4 assembly is shown on the x-axis. Alignments of this region to zebrafish BACs,
the puffer fish (fugu) zan locus (Scaffold 860) and human 7q22 were performed using MultiPipMaker. Regions of high conservation consisting of gap-free alignments of at least 100 bp and 70 percent nucleotide sequence identity are shown in red and
other locally aligned regions are shown in green. RepeatMasker [45] was used to mask zebrafish repeats before the alignments
were made.

PCR followed by sequencing from both directions. An in
silico restriction digest matched experimental digests. The
zonadhesin-like gene was the only gene found on this
BAC. All other open reading frames were associated with
LINE, SINE and transposon related repetitive elements.
Comparison of 722P12 against itself using Dotter and
PipMaker [26] did not reveal any recent domain expansions or duplications. The Simple Modular Architecture
Research Tool (SMART) [27] was used to identify conserved domains of the predicted protein (Figure 1A). The
SMART algorithm was used to detect three VWD domains
(amino acid positions 31â198, 415â578 and 1277â
1498), a VWC domain at (position 365â425), and two
MAM domains (positions 708â870 and 895â1056). This
tool also located three low complexity regions that corresponded to the mucin domains predicted by the computer program NetOGlyc 3.1 [28]. These mucin domains
occurred at positions 1091â1099 and 1115â1158 with a
smaller low complexity region located between nucleotides 693 and 704. These results were corroborated using
the InterPro domain prediction computer program [29].
The SMART and InterPro domain prediction tools, in
agreement with Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy data, did not
find any transmembrane domains in the salmon Zlg. In
contrast, the SMART tool detected a transmembrane

domain at the expected location for zonadhesins from
other species.
Using two distinct probes (Figure 1A), only one copy of
zlg was found in Atlantic salmon by Southern blot analysis (Figure 1B). However, two bands occurred when the
same probes were used with rainbow trout genomic DNA
(Figure 1B). Probe 1, which contained sequence homologous to the 3'-UTR of zlg (Figure 1), would be expected to
be specific for this gene; however, probe 2 spanned VWD1
and could be expected to hybridize with related zonadhesin-like genes. Both probes gave similar results and only
probe 1 data is shown in Figure 1B. Southern blot analysis
did not reveal any other genes in Atlantic salmon other
than zlg. This suggests that if another zonadhesin-like
gene does exist in Atlantic salmon it is likely quite divergent from zlg.
The 5'-end of the zlg cDNA coding sequence was obtained
by PCR using primers designed to the predicted translation start site on the BAC sequence. The final assembly of
the cDNA was 4,791 bp [GenBank: AY785949]. The total
length of the mRNA found by Northern blot was just over
5 Kb (Figure 2A). The additional length of the mRNA is
likely comprised of the 5'-UTR of zlg. The cDNA aligned
completely to the BAC and the 23 consecutive exons of

Figure structures of representative zonadhesins and related proteins
Domain 4
Domain structures of representative zonadhesins and related proteins. Mouse [GenBank: NP035871.1], pig [GenBank: Q28983], human [GenBank: Q9Y493], puffer fish and zebrafish zonadhesins are shown with the salmon and zebrafish
Zlg. The human MUC2 [GenBank: L21998.1], human prepro von Willebrand factor [GenBank: P04275] and rat (Rattus norvegicus) MUC2 [GenBank: Q62635] and human and chicken FCGBP proteins [GenBank: NP003881.1 and XP422715.1] are also
included. Signal peptide sequences (SP) are drawn as a white box and are found at the N-terminus of all proteins except for
puffer fish and zebrafish Zan. All the zonadhesins have an epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain (in red), a transmembrane
(TM) domain (in yellow) and a cytoplasmic domain (CD) (in green) which are labeled on the mouse Zan protein. The MAM and
mucin domains are indicated and the VWD domains are represented by 'D'. The partial D3 domains of the mouse are represented by D3p1-20. Other partial VWD domains are denoted D0 or D' as found in the current literature. It is important to
note that although this domain representation is consistent with previous representations of zonadhesin and other VWD containing proteins, other domain types such as von Willebrand C (VWC) and trypsin inhibitor-like (TILa) domains have not been
included here.

the zonadhesin-like gene utilized canonical splice sites.
The cDNA has a predicted ORF of 4,518 bases that
encodes a 1,506 amino acid protein. The predicted protein starts with a methionine and has a putative signal
peptide of 18 amino acids. A poly (A) signal of AATAAA
was identified by Genscan [30,31] at 4770 bp from the
start codon of the cDNA, 241 bp downstream of the stop
codon.
Salmo salar zlg expression
Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to
identify tissues expressing the zlg mRNA (Figure 2B).
Liver, brain, kidney, spleen, foregut, midgut, hindgut and
gonads were taken from one male and one female Atlantic
salmon. Male and female salmon showed expression in
the liver, midgut and hindgut. However, expression in the
spleen only occurred in the male and expression in the
foregut only occurred in the female. A weak band was
present in the ovarian sample and expression was not
observed in the testes. This gene does not appear to be
expressed in either male or female brain or kidney.

Northern blot results were similar to the RT-PCR results
and showed a single band in male midgut and hindgut,
and female midgut and foregut (Figure 2A). A weak band
was seen in the Northern blot analysis of liver from both
male and female fish (Figure 2A). Unlike the RT-PCR
results, Northern blot analysis did not detect a transcript
in the male spleen and female hindgut. This discrepancy
could be due to the higher sensitivity of the PCR experiment. The zlg expression pattern differed from the testesspecific expression known for mammalian zonadhesin.
To clarify the relationship between zan and zan-like genes,
we looked for related genes in the genomes of other fish.
Genomic analysis of the zebrafish zan locus
An initial inspection of the ZV4 (September 6th, 2004
release) whole genome shotgun (WGS) assembly of the
D. rerio genome suggested there are two copies of zonadhesin that exist at two distinct loci. One copy is found at
linkage group 7 (scaffold 588) and consists entirely of
whole genome shotgun reads. The second copy is found at
linkage group 24 (scaffold 1965) and resides within a
completely sequenced BAC from the CHORI-211 library
[GenBank: BX649275]. The ZV3 assembly contained only
one copy of zonadhesin that also assembles into linkage
group 7. It is important to note that the ZV3 assembly
consisted entirely of whole genome shotgun reads; the
ZV4 assembly incorporated finished BAC sequence into
the ZV3 assembly; and that both assemblies are considered 'pre-assemblies' that need to be analyzed with caution. The location of zonadhesin at linkage group 7 is
supported by the fact that other genes with significant
similarity to human chromosome 7q22 map to the same
region of the D.rerio genome. These genes include acetyl-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/165

choline esterase, serpine, AP1S1, unnamed product
FLJ39237, unnamed protein product FLJ10925 and
mucin (Figure 3).
The regions surrounding the zan locus at both linkage
groups were inspected for possible segmental duplications. BAC clones (both finished and unfinished) that
aligned to a 600 kb region surrounding the zan locus at
linkage group 7, or a 1 MB region at linkage group 24,
were obtained and aligned to both loci using the BLASTZ
algorithm through the MultiPipMaker web server. Our
analysis showed that the zonadhesin-containing BAC
BX649275 integrated completely into linkage group 7 and
was â 97% identical overall, not including indels. Seven
additional BACs from the DKey library aligned to the scaffold and produced an acceptable tile through the entire
zan locus (Figure 3). In contrast, only a portion of BAC
BX649275 and a portion of BX640466.9 aligned to the
zan locus at linkage group 24. This is suggestive of an
assembly artifact that resulted in the assignment of a second zonadhesin gene to linkage group 24.
The differences between individual BACs, and between
BACs and linkage group 7, can be as high as 3%. This
amount of polymorphism is higher than the 0.5% polymorphism rate expected from the whole genome shotgun
sequence, which came from approximately 1000, 5 day
old embryos [32]. Despite this high rate of polymorphism, the existence of one zonadhesin locus at linkage
group 7 is supported by the large tile of overlapping
clones at linkage group 7, and the rapidly evolving nature
of zonadhesin genes [1].
Prediction of the zebrafish zan transcript and domain
structure
We further analysed the zonadhesin gene found on the
completely sequenced BAC (BX649275). The 4,616
amino acid translation product of the putative zan gene
lacked a signal peptide, but contained the domain structure of: two MAM domains; a mucin domain; nine VWD
domains; and a transmembrane region. This domain
organization is typical of zonadhesin (Figure 4). The
entire zonadhesin gene was also contained within 13
unordered pieces from the clone DKey-3K24 [GenBank:
CR848737.2]. From this clone we obtained a third putative zan transcript that was most similar to the complete
zan sequence from BAC BX649275. The predicted cDNA
from CR848737.2 differs from the cDNA of BX649275 by
0.8%. The putative ZAN protein encoded by BAC
CR848737.2 has a domain structure the same as the one
encoded by the putative zan transcript of BAC BX649275.

Zebrafish zonadhesin has expanded its VWD domains
through recent tandem duplication. The VWD domains 5,
6 and a fragment of 7 are encoded in 17 exons (45â61).

Zebrafish zonadhesin mRNA expression
Zebrafish zonadhesin mRNA expression. A) Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of zebrafish tissues.
Three primer sets were designed against zonadhesin specific sites. The amplicons of the first primer set crossed the mucin
domain stretching from the MAM domains to the first VWD domain (MAM-VWD). The second primer set amplified within the
VWD9 domain (VWD9). Products of the third primer set stretched from the last VWD domain to the cytoplasmic domain
(VWD9-CD). Ubiquitin primers were used as a positive control and a template-free reaction was included as a negative control. B-C) Expression of zebrafish zonadhesin analyzed by Northern blot. B) Expression of zonadhesin was investigated in the
zebrafish testis and gut. Five micrograms of total RNA from each tissue was blotted on a positively charged nylon membrane
and hybridized with a DNA probe encompassing the zebrafish EGF to CD region of zan. C) The same Northern blot membrane was reprobed with zebrafish alpha-tubulin as a positive control.

These exons have identical sizes to the exons (11â27 and
28â44) encoding the first four VWD domains. Furthermore, each group of 17 exons are symmetrical and flanked
by phase '1' introns, which is evidence for recent domain
expansion. Pair-wise alignment of BAC BX649275 against
itself revealed these exons are found in three â 5 kb blocks
that are 85â87% identical. The zan locus at linkage group
7 only contains two of these â 5 kb repeats. It is possible
the third repeat was collapsed in the whole genome shotgun assembly process or the presence of two repetitive
blocks is a true population variant.
Danio rerio zonadhesin expression
To compare the expression pattern and verify the transcript size of the predicted zebrafish zan we extracted gut
and testes RNA and performed RT-PCR and Northern blot
analysis. Three different PCR primer sets were designed
against three regions of the predicted zan cDNA. The first
primer set was designed to amplify the exons encoding the
MAM domains through to the first VWD domain. This
primer set produced a doublet in both male and female

(the larger band in the female was very faint) (Figure 5A).
The female bands were approximately 50 bp larger than
the male bands. The differences between individuals may
be due to a variation in mucin domain length since mucin
domains have been shown to be variable in other genes
[12]. The second primer set flanked the ninth VWD
domain and the third stretched from the epidermal
growth factor domain to the cytoplasmic domain. Each
primer set identified a zonadhesin transcript in the gut,
but not in the testes (Figure 5A). These results were corroborated by Northern blot analysis that found a single
transcript of â 15 Kb in the gut but not in the testes (Figure
5B and 5C). This â 15 kb transcript correlates to the
mRNA length predicted from the genomic sequence and
supports the existence of a single zonadhesin gene in
zebrafish.

hesin gene in the same contig (scaffold 870) as the ache
gene. This syntenic relationship was also found at the
mammalian and zebrafish zan loci (Figure 3). However,
Scaffold 870 has been split in the current Fugu genome
project release (MAYFFOLDS) leaving zonadhesin in a
gap-free region of scaffold 2,670 without ache.
Puffer fish zonadhesin was predicted to contain 47 exons
that coded for a protein of 2,525 amino acids. The predicted zonadhesin protein contained two MAM domains
at the N-terminus, a mucin domain, five VWD domains,
an EGF domain, a transmembrane domain and a short
cytoplasmic domain (Figure 4). This protein has the same
domains in the same order as human zonadhesin. No signal peptide was identified in the puffer fish zonadhesin.
However, this sequence may be incomplete since it was
found at the end of the scaffold sequence.
Expression of T. rubripes zonadhesin
Evidence from the GenBank database suggests that puffer
fish zonadhesin is also expressed in the gut. Sequences can
be found that have been isolated from gut-specific libraries [GenBank: CA591505, CA588342 and CA588225],
but there have been no zonadhesin sequences found with
testes-specific expression.
Structural similarity of D. rerio and T. rubripes to
mammalian zan genes
Although fish and mammals have not shared a common
ancestor for an estimated 450 million years [34], the
domain structure of zonadhesin has been highly conserved (Figure 4). However, domain numbers between
species are variable and this variability appears to have
been influenced by tandem duplication. Tandem duplications have occurred in both mammalian and fish species
and are most prevalent in the VWD domain region (Figure
4). It is this region which, at least in mammals, has been
shown to be important for zona pellucida binding [35].
While multiple VWD domains are found in all characterized zonadhesins, recent expansion of this domain is seen
in the mouse and in the zebrafish. Repeated tandem
duplication in the mouse zonadhesin gene resulted in 20
copies of a two-exon segment encoding a partial VWD3
domain that increased the length of the protein by over
2000 amino acids [2,3]. In zebrafish, the double duplication of two domains homologous to the puffer fish VWD1
and VWD2, as well as a portion of the VWD3 domain
(containing 17 VWD-coding exons), resulted in an additional 34 exons that encoded 4 additional full VWD
domains and two partial VWD domains in the zebrafish
Zan (Figure 4).

The ancestral zonadhesin likely looked similar to the
puffer fish Zan as it is very similar in length and domain
structure to most mammalian zonadhesins (Figure 4).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/165

The puffer fish gene also has slightly higher identity with
the human zonadhesin gene at 52% (indels removed)
compared with the 50% identity between zebrafish and
human whereas the zebrafish and puffer fish genes are
62% identical.
The five VWD domains of the puffer fish also cluster with
the four in human (Figure 6A). The last four VWD
domains of puffer fish Zan seem to be homologous to the
last four human domains; although, the first VWD
domain of puffer fish also has high similarity to the second domain in human. This may be the result of an
ancient duplication of the first two VWD domains in
puffer fish and subsequent loss of the new first domain.
This inheritance is similar to that of the MAM domains.
Puffer fish zonadhesin has two MAM domains, a structure
matching the rabbit and pig proteins [7]. Neighbor-joining tree analysis of individual domains reveals that the
MAM1 domain of puffer fish is most similar to the MAM1
and MAM3 domains of human, while the MAM2 domain
of puffer fish groups with MAM2 of human (Figure 6B).
This pattern of similarity could be explained by a duplication of both MAM domains in the human lineage and
subsequent loss of the fourth domain. This phylogeny, in
combination with the conserved domain order and synteny between fish and mammal zonadhesin loci, supports
the orthologous relationship of these genes.
Genomic and phylogenetic analysis of genes with a domain
content similar to zonadhesin
Until this study, zonadhesin was generally thought to be
unique in its domain content as no other genes were
reported to contain MAM, mucin, TIL and VWD domains.
However, the characterization of the salmon zlg revealed
all of these domains, but in a different order (Figure 4).
The expression of zlg is similar to zebrafish zonadhesin
which, in addition to domain content, established a possible evolutionary link between these genes. Examination
of GenBank sequences also revealed that zonadhesin-like
genes have been found in gut tissues of other species;
however, the automated annotation is based on the similarity of the TIL and VWD domains of FCGBP. For example, there are three human colon ESTs [GenBank:
AI984139, AI983786 and AI983612] that are annotated
as similar to zonadhesin; however, these genes align perfectly to the FCGBP gene at chromosome 19q13.2. Similarly, the only mouse colon EST that is annotated as
similar to zonadhesin aligns to the Fcgbp gene in the
orthologous region at mouse chromosome 7.

We looked for zonadhesin-like genes in puffer fish,
zebrafish and chicken (Gallus gallus) genome projects.
This search uncovered several regions with VWD-containing proteins without any detectable MAM domains, some

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:165

of these possibly related to FCGBP proteins. One interesting exception was a zonadhesin-like gene found on
zebrafish chromosome 2. This putative zebrafish zlg
encodes a 1,308 amino acid protein containing three
MAM domains, the first of which is flanked by short (15
amino acid) mucin-like low complexity regions. The
MAM domains are followed by two VWD domains. This
gene structure is reminiscent of S. salar Zlg and shows that
a zonadhesin ortholog and a zan-like gene exist together
in the zebrafish genome (Figure 4).
The search for zonadhesin-like genes in chicken (Gallus
gallus) did not reveal an obvious zonadhesin ortholog but
rather a prediction of a FCGBP-like protein residing on
chromosome 9 [GenBank: XP422715.1]. We analysed the
corresponding region of the G. gallus genome and utilized
additional EST evidence and in silico predictions to obtain
a putative transcript that encodes a 4,770 amino acid gene
product. This gene product contains three MAM domains
in addition to VWD and mucin-type O-glycosylation sites
after each of the MAM domains. Overall, this MAMmucin-TIL-VWD series of domains is reminiscent of all
zonadhesins and is evidence for a common evolutionary
origin of zonadhesin, the zonadhesin-like genes and the
Fc fragment of IgG binding protein(FCGBP).
We extracted the MAM and VWD domains of representative zonadhesin and zonadhesin-like genes and performed a phylogenetic analysis (see Figures 6A and 6B
respectively). In addition to the clustering of fish and
mammalian zonadhesin, both phylogenetic trees suggest
an evolutionary relationship among the zonadhesin-like
genes. In particular, the zebrafish Zlg MAM1 and MAM2
domains grouped with the salmon Zlg MAMs as well as
two of the chicken FCGBP-like MAM domains (Figure
6B). The grouping of the MAM domains of these proteins
indicates that the zonadhesin-like genes represent a novel
gene family that is distinct from zonadhesin.
Although the phylogeny is more complex with many
nodes not well supported, the evolutionary relationship
between the fish Zlgs and the chicken FCGBP-like gene
was also observed for the VWD domain (Figure 6A). For
example, the VWD1 domains of the fish Zlgs clustered
with the VWD2 and VWD5 domains of the chicken
FCGBP-like gene. A second clade consisting of the VWD2
domains of salmon and zebrafish Zlg, and the VWD3 and
VWD6 domain of the chicken FCGBP-like gene also
formed. The clade containing puffer fish ZAN VWD5,
human ZAN VWD4 and salmon Zlg VWD3 also suggests
that zonadhesin is closely related to the zonadhesin-like
genes. The human FCGBP VWD domains all formed a single clade except for VWD1 which grouped with the
chicken FCGBP-like VWD1 and 4 (data not shown). Overall, the phylogenies of the VWD and MAM domains com-

bined with the expression patterns of: fish zonadhesins,
fish and chicken zonadhesin-like genes, FCGBP, mucin,
and several MAM containing proteins, suggest that these
mosaic genes share a common ancestor.
Zonadhesin in the context of other sperm-egg interacting
proteins
Many mammalian zona pellucida adhesion molecule
candidates appear to have evolved from different physiological processes. Well known examples of sperm proteins
with enzymatic function that have been 'hijacked' into
playing non-enzymatic roles in sperm-egg interactions
include: B4GALT1/GalTase (beta 1,4 galactosyltransferase), SPAM1/PH-20 (hyaluronidase), HK1/ZRK/p95
(hexokinase), and ARSA/SLIP1 (aryl-sulfatase-A; reviewed
by [36]). Evidence for immune-system hijacking events
comes from the discovery of several complement system
proteins in human spermatozoa, seminal plasma and follicular fluid (reviewed by [37]). The partial activation of
the complement system (without engaging the membrane
attack complex) in acrosome-reacted spermatozoa suggests how components of a conserved immune system
pathway could play a new role in sperm-egg recognition
[38]. Although the function of the fish zonadhesin and
zonadhesin-like genes is not known, their expression in
the gut and absence of expression in the testes, combined
with their homology to gut-expressed genes of the
mucosal immune system (i.e. FCGBP and mucin), suggest
that zonadhesin was also 'hijacked' by the mammalian
reproductive system.

Conclusion
We identified zonadhesin genes in zebrafish and puffer
fish that are similar in domain order and content to all
known mammalian orthologs. Unlike all mammalian
zonadhesin genes studied to date, zebrafish zan was
expressed in the gut but not in the testes. In addition to
these orthologs, we characterized zonadhesin-like genes
(zlg) in Atlantic salmon, zebrafish and chicken. While the
Atlantic salmon zlg contained the same domains found in
zonadhesin, the order of these domains was altered and
the expression was found predominantly in the gut and
not in the testes. Overall, this suggests that zonadhesin's
reproductive role evolved later in the mammalian lineage.

Methods
An Atlantic salmon CHORI-214 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was obtained from BACPAC
Resources, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) [25]. Five BAC library filters (13A-17A)
were hybridized with a probe designed from a zonadhesin-like EST [GenBank: CK990464]. These five filters
contained 91,776 BAC clones in a pTARBAC2.1 vector
with an average size of 190 Kb. Each filter was estimated
to represent the salmon genome once. Filter hybridiza-

tions were conducted as described by CHORI [39]. The
PCR product that was used as a probe was generated by
PCR (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol and
the following primer set: 5'-GTGCCCATTGTAGGAAGGAA-3' and 5'-GGGGTTGAGGATTCTGGAG-3'. The
probe was gel purified and end-labeled with Î³32P-ATP
(Amersham). Probed BAC library filters were visualized
using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImaging system.

Southern blot analysis
Liver genomic DNA from male Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout were isolated from 100 mg of tissue using the
Easy-DNA Kit (Invitrogen). Southern blot analysis was
performed as described by Hames and Higgins [48]. DNA
was digested by restriction enzymes EcoR I, Hind III, BamH
I and Bgl II (NEB). The digested DNA was electrophoresed
for 18 h and then transferred to Hybond, positively
charged nylon membrane (Amersham).

BAC DNA was isolated by an alkaline lysis procedure
using Nucleobond columns (Clontech) using the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated 722P12 BAC DNA was
nebulized and the DNA was blunt-ended. The bluntended repaired DNA was size fractioned by electrophoresis and the gel region corresponding to 1200â3000 bp was
excised and gel purified (Qiagen). The fragments were
blunt-end ligated into pUC19 plasmid cut with Hinc II
(NEB) and transformed into electrocompetent DH5Î± E.
coli cells using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser system. Extracted
recombinant plasmid templates were sequenced on an
ABI 3700 DNA sequencer. Bases were called using PHRED
[40,41]. The resulting 3000+ high quality sequence reads
were assembled using PHRAP [42] and then viewed and
edited using Consed [43]. One gap of about 500 bp in the
assembly was filled by designing primers to the contig
ends followed by amplification of this BAC region by PCR
and subsequent cloning and sequencing this fragment.
Restriction digests of the isolated BAC were compared to
in silico digests for assembly confirmation. BAC 722P12
was deposited in GenBank under the accession number
AY785949.

Two probes were prepared to the 5' and 3' ends of the zlg
cDNA sequence. Probe 1 included 206 nucleotides of the
3' end of the zlg ORF and 177 nucleotides of the 3'-UTR
and probe 2 included 233 nucleotides of the VWD1
domain (Figure 1A). Both probes were gel purified and
labeled with a Rediprime II random labeling kit (Amersham) with 50 ÂµCi of Î±32P-labeled-dCTP.

Dotter [44] and PipMaker [26] were used to compare the
BAC sequence to itself and to identify duplicated and
repeated regions. Identification of other repeat elements
was done with RepeatMasker [45] using repeat library
4.01 from Repbase [46]. Low complexity regions that corresponded to the mucin domains were predicted by the
computer program NetOGlyc 3.1 [28]. Genscan was used
to predict novel genes and gene structures [30,31]. Translated and untranslated BLAST searches were performed
using 722P12 BAC as the query.
The Atlantic salmon zlg cDNA was partially sequenced by
first completing a series of primer walks from the 5'- and
3'-ends to complete a 4,388 bp EST clone [GenBank:
CK990464]. Primers were designed to the predicted translation start site on the genomic DNA in order to amplify
fragments spanning the 5' end of the coding region from
gut total cDNA. Sim4 [47] and Dotter [44] were used to
align the cDNA sequence with the genomic DNA to identify exonic and intronic regions. The zlg cDNA was deposited under the GenBank accession number AY785950.

Blots were prehybridized at 68Â°C for 4 h in hybridization
buffer (5Ã SSC, 5Ã Denhardt's solution and 1% SDS) with
100 Âµg/mL denatured human placental DNA (Sigma).
This was followed by replacement with fresh, preheated
(68Â°C) hybridization buffer and the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Hybridization was allowed to proceed
overnight. Following hybridization, the membrane was
washed twice with 20 mL of 2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at room
temperature for 15 min followed by two 15 min washes of
200 mL 0.2Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65Â°C in a shaking bath.
Prehybridization, hybridization and wash conditions
were the same for both probes.
Northern blot analysis
RNA was extracted from Atlantic salmon tissues (liver,
brain, spleen, kidney, midgut, hindgut, foregut and
gonads) and from zebrafish testes and gut using Trizol
(Invitrogen). Total RNA samples were quantified and
checked for quality by spectrophotometric analysis and
agarose gel electrophoresis. Northern blots were prepared
using the NorthernMax-Gly kit (Ambion) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Ten Âµg of Atlantic salmon or
5 Âµg of zebrafish total RNA from each tissue was blotted
on a Hybond positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham). Northern blot analysis of Atlantic salmon tissues
utilized the same probe 1 described for the Southern blot
analysis. The zebrafish zonadhesin probe was amplified
from gut tissue using a primer set spanning from the 3'
end of the epidermal growth factor domain through to the
cytoplasmic domain using primers 5'-GGTTTGAGGGCACAAACTGT-3'and
5'-TAGGGATGCGCTGTCTTTTT-3'. Prehybridization for both Northern blots
proceeded for 2 h at 42Â°C in 15 mL of ULTRAhyb buffer
(Ambion). Hybridization with the Î±32P-dCTP-labeled
probe at a final concentration of 106cpm/mL of hybridization buffer was performed at 42Â°C overnight. The
zebrafish Northern blot was stripped and reprobed with a

probe designed from zebrafish alpha-tubulin that was
expected to produce a doublet of 1485 bp [GenBank:
AY398374] and 1544 bp [GenBank: AF029250].
Semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA from Atlantic salmon and zebrafish tissue
extracted as above was reverse transcribed using Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) and an 18 nucleotide oligo
d(T) primer as described in the manufacturer's protocol
with exception of the production of the cDNA template
for the zebrafish MAM primer set which required a genespecific internal primer for reverse transcription to reach
this region (5'-AGACACTTTCACCCCCAGTG-3'). For
Atlantic salmon, one ÂµL of cDNA was amplified in a 25 ÂµL
reaction volume with either zlg probe 1 primers or ubiquitin primers (5'-ATGTCAAGGCCAAGATCCAG-3' and 5'TAATGCCTCCACGAAGACG-3'). The zlg EST [GenBank:
CK990464] and the 722P12 BAC were included as positive controls and both primer sets were run with templatefree negative controls. For zebrafish, three primer sets
were designed against the genomic zan sequence. The first
primer set flanked the second MAM domain through to
the first VWD domain (5'-TTGCAATTGATAGCGTCTGC3' and 5'-TTCAGTCACAGGGTCACAGG-3'); the second
primer set flanked the ninth VWD domain (5'-GGAGACCGTTACTGCAAACC-3' and 5'-CGAACAGTGATGCCGTACAC-3'); and the third primer set stretched from the
epidermal growth factor domain to the cytoplasmic
domain (see Northern blot probe description). The integrity of each cDNA was confirmed by control PCR reactions
that used an ubiquitin primer set (5'-CCTCGAGGTAGAGCCAAGTG-3'
and
5'-GCAGCACACAAGGTGCAAAGTA-3') and a template-free negative control.
Puffer fish and zebrafish zonadhesin prediction and
analysis
The puffer fish zonadhesin was found by BLASTN search
of the three puffer fish genome assembles available at the
MRC RFCGR Fugu genome database [33] with human
and mouse zan nucleotide sequences. Scaffold 870 from
assembly 2 was found to have similarity to zonadhesin
and was subsequently analyzed by Genscan for coding
sequences and peptide predictions. Puffer fish ESTs were
aligned to scaffold 870 using Sim4.

The zebrafish zonadhesin was found by BLASTP search of
the Ensembl zebrafish peptide database (Ensembl assembly 25.4.1) using a fragment of Atlantic salmon predicted
protein as the query sequence. The Atlantic salmon query
fragment consisted of all the amino acids except those representing the MAM domains. The two genomic regions
identified were analyzed by Genscan to find the putative
coding and protein sequences.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/165

We looked for zonadhesin-like genes in puffer fish,
zebrafish and chicken (Gallus gallus) genome projects
using the ENSEMBL BLAST search tools using both cDNA
and protein sequences from several zonadhesin-like genes
as in silico probes. These included salmon zlg, human,
puffer fish and zebrafish zans and the related human
FCGBP gene. Genomic regions from all significant
matches were extracted and gene prediction analysis was
performed using Genscan.
Domain predictions and phylogenetic analysis
Protein domains were predicted using SMART and InterPro prediction tools and the domains were extracted from
the parent nucleotide and protein sequences. Multiple
sequence alignments of the extracted domains were done
using ClustalX [50] followed by manual inspection. See
additional file 1 and additional file 2 for VWD and MAM
multiple alignments respectively. Neighbor-joining trees
were created using MEGA3. Consensus trees based on
1000 pseudoreplicates are reported with the bootstrap
support values indicated above the respective nodes. Gaps
were removed and we reported phylogenetic data using
the Poisson correction model with uniform rates across all
sites. Neighbor-joining trees were also performed using
the Poisson correction model with unequal rates across
sites using gamma distance parameters 0.65 and 2.25.
While some of the less supported nodes changed, the
clades discussed here did not vary substantially using
these different parameters for either the MAM or the VWD
trees. We also used the equal input model using either
uniform rates across all sites or unequal rates across all
sites using gamma distance parameters 0.65 and 2.25.
Again these parameters did not change the topology of the
clades discussed in the text.
