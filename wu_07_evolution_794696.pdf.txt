Abstract
Background: Nuclear receptors (NRs) are important transcriptional modulators in metazoans
which regulate transcription through binding to the promoter region of their target gene by the
DNA binding domain (DBD) and activation or repression of mRNA synthesis through coregulators bound to the ligand binding domain (LBD). NRs typically have a single DBD with a LBD.
Results: Three nuclear receptors named 2DBD-NRs, were identified from the flatworm
Schistosoma mansoni that each possess a novel set of two DBDs in tandem with a LBD. They
represent a novel NR modular structure: A/B-DBD-DBD-hinge-LBD. The 2DBD-NRs form a new
subfamily of NRs, VII. By database mining, 2DBD-NR genes from other flatworm species (Schmidtea
mediterranea and Dugesia japonica), from Mollusks (Lottia gigantean) and from arthropods (Daphnia
pulex) were also identified. All 2DBD-NRs possess a P-box sequence of CEACKK in the first DBD,
which is unique to 2DBD-NRs, and a P-box sequence of CEGCKG in the second DBD.
Phylogenetic analyses of both DBD and ligand binding domain sequences showed that 2DBD-NR
genes originate from a common two DBD-containing ancestor gene. A single 2DBD-NR
orthologue was found in Arthropoda, Platyhelminths and Mollusca. Subsequent 2DBD-NR gene
evolution in Mollusks and Platyhelminths involved gene duplication. Chromosome localization of S.
mansoni 2DBD-NR genes by Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) suggests that 2DBD-NR genes
duplicated on different chromosomes in the Platyhelminths. Dimerization of Sm2DBDα indicates
that 2DBD-NRs may act as homodimers, suggesting either that two repeats of a half-site are
necessary for each DBD of 2DBD-NRs to bind to its target gene, or that each 2DBD-NR can
recognize multiple sites.
Conclusion: 2DBD-NRs share a common ancestor gene which possessed an extra DBD that likely
resulted from a recombination event. After the split of the Arthropods, Mollusks and
Platyhelminths, 2DBD-NR underwent a recent duplication in a common ancestor of Mollusks, while
two rounds of duplication occurred in a common ancestor of the Platyhelminths. This
demonstrates that certain NR gene underwent recent duplication in Prostostome lineages after the
split of the Prostostomia and Deuterostomia.

Background
Nuclear receptors (NR) regulate homeostasis, differentiation, metamorphosis and reproduction in metazoans.
Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are characterized by a modular structure. Typical NRs contain an Nterminal A/B domain, a C domain (DNA binding domain,
DBD), a D domain (hinge) and an E domain (ligand
binding domain, LBD). The most conserved region in NRs
is the DBD, which contains two zinc finger motifs (CI and
CII). There is a conserved sequence element in the DBD,
called the P-box, which confers target DNA binding specificity. Another moderately conserved region is the LBD
[1-3]. Two highly conserved regions are present within the
LBD. The first region is called the signature sequence of
LBD (Tau, Tτ), from the C-terminus of helix 3 to the middle of helix 4 [1,4]. The second conserved region is helix
12 which contains the activation function core motif
(AF2-AD) that is required for transcriptional activation
and co-regulator recruitment. NRs regulate transcription
through binding to the promoter region of their target
gene by the DBD and activation or repression of mRNA
synthesis through co-regulators bound to the LBD [5].
Recently, we isolated three partial cDNAs of nuclear receptors which contain two DBDs in the flatworm Schistosoma
mansoni [6]. Typical NRs only have a single DBD with a
LBD, unusual nuclear receptors are known only to have
one DBD without a LBD [7-10] or to posses a LBD without a DBD [11,12]. To determine the modular structure of
these novel nuclear receptors (that is, whether they contain a LBD), cDNAs encoding the entire open reading
frame (ORF) of Sm2DBD-NRs were isolated. By data mining, additional 2DBD-NRs were identified in species of
Mollusca, Arthropoda and other species of Platyhelminths. The phylogenetic relationship of 2DBD-NRs
was constructed, the origin of 2DBD-NRs and their role in
understanding metazoan phylogeny is discussed.

Results and Discussion
A novel NR modular structure: A/B-DBD-DBD-hinge-LBD
cDNAs of three S. mansoni 2DBD-NRs (Sm2DBDα, 5144
bp, Sm2DBDβ, 5525 bp and Sm2DBDγ, 6374 bp) were
isolated. Each cDNA encodes a large protein: Sm2DBDα,
1527 amino acids; Sm2DBDβ, 1523 amino acids and
Sm2DBDγ, 1816 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Each protein
exhibits a modular structure characteristic of the nuclear
receptor superfamily with a divergent N terminal A/B
domain, a hinge region and a less well conserved LBD.
Remarkably, each possesses two DBDs in tandem (Fig.
1A). Thus the A/B-DBD-DBD-hinge-LBD organization
represents a novel NR modular structure. All the members
of this novel group have been placed in a new subfamily,
NR VII.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/27

The LBD is conserved in all three proteins from helix 3 to
helix 12. The consensus signature sequence of the LBD
(Tτ), ((F, WY)(A, SI)(K, R, E, G)XXX(F, L)XX(L, V,
IXXX(D, S)(Q, K)XX(L, V)(L, I, F)) [1,4], is conserved in
each of them (Fig. 1B). A putative AF2 activating domain
core (AF2-AD), designated ΦΦXEΦΦ, where Φ represents
a hydrophobic amino acid [13-15], is highly conserved in
Sm2DBDα and Sm2DBDβ, but not in Sm2DBDγ. In
Sm2DBDγ, a glutamine is located in the position which is
normally conserved for a glutamic acid (Fig. 1B).
Sm2DBDα contains a large F domain. The function of the
F domain, which is known to be present in some but not
all nuclear receptors, is not well known (eg. [15-22]). The
hinge region of each protein is unusually large (Fig. 1A).
This trait has been observed in other Schistosoma NRs [1522]. The role of such a large hinge region is yet to be determined.
Identification of 2DBD-NR in other organisms
By an extensive search of whole genomic sequence (WGS)
databases extracted from NCBI, three 2DBD-NRs were
found in the freshwater turbellarian Schmidtea mediterranea, two were found in the mollusk Lottia gigantean (owl
limpet) and one was found in the crustacean Daphnia
pulex (water flea) (Fig. 2 and additional file 1). No 2DBDNR or any sequence encoding a P-box sequence of
CEACKK, which is unique to the first DBD of 2DBD-NR
(see below and Fig. 3), was found in sponge (Reniera sp),
cnidarian (Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis), arthropod insects, sea urchin or vertebrate sequence
data bases. One additional 2DBD-NR was found in the
turbellarian Dugesia japonica in the NCBI EST database
(Fig. 2 and additional file 1).
Sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree construction
Alignment of the deduced DBD sequences showed that all
2DBD-NRs possess a P-box sequence, CEACKK, in the first
DBD, and the P-box sequence, CEGCKG, in the second
DBD (Fig. 2). A blast search against all available databases
showed that the P-Box sequence CEACKK is not present in
any other NR. This unique P-box present in the first DBD
of 2DBD-NRs suggests a novel target DNA specificity may
exist for the first DBD. The P-box sequence of second
DBD, CEGCKG followed by the amino acid sequence
FFRR (CEGCKGFFRR) is identical to that of most members in NR subfamily I (NR I) suggesting that 2DBD-NRs
may have a close functional or evolutionary relationship
with receptors in NR subfamily I.

Both Maximum Likelihood method and Bayesian inference analysis show that the first DBD of 2DBD-NRs
belongs to one monophyletic group and the second DBD
belongs to a separate monophyletic group (Fig. 3). The
results suggest that 2DBD-NRs originated from a common
ancestor gene. Both the first and the second DBD are sister

groups to members of NR subfamily I, suggesting that the
common ancestral gene of 2DBD-NRs was close to a common ancestral gene of NR subfamily I genes and the extra
DBD was gained by a recombination event (Fig. 3).
Another phylogenetic tree was constructed employing
LBD sequences, the same result was obtained (Fig. 4). The
mRNA sequences reported here were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers: Sm2DBDα [GenBank:AY688250], Sm2DBDβ [GenBank:AY688251] and
Sm2DBDγ [GenBank:AY698061]
Protein-protein interaction
NRs can regulate transcription as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with retinoid × receptor (RXR), another nuclear
receptor. To determine whether 2DBD-NRs may form
dimers and to begin to define the quarternary structure of
2DBD-NRs, the interaction of Sm2DBDα, SmRXR1 and
SmRXR2 was evaluated in a yeast two hybrid system.

Yeast transformed with pSV40/p53 (positive control),
pSV40/plamin C (negative control), pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-

F/pACT-SmRXR1, pAS-SmRXR1-C-F/pGAD-Sm2DBDα,
pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-F/pACT-SmRXR2,
pAS-SmRXR2/
pGAD-Sm2DBDα and pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-F/pGADSm2DBDα grew on SD/-trp-leu plate as expected (Fig. 5Aa). If Sm2DBDα interacts with SmRXR1, SmRXR2 or with
itself, the Gal4 binding domain fusion partner bound to
the Gal1 UAS element will interact with the Gal4 activation domain to drive transcription of the reporter gene.
Yeast co-transformed with pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-F/pGADSm2DBDα grew on SD/-trp-his-leu plus 3 mM 3-AT, indicating that Sm2DBDα can act as a homodimer. Yeast cotransformed with pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-F/pACT-SmRXR1,
pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-F/pACT-SmRXR2 or pAS-SmRXR1-CF/pGAD-Sm2DBDα and pAS-SmRXR2/pGAD-Sm2DBDα
did not grow on SD/-trp-his-leu plus 3 mM 3-AT plates,
indicating that Sm2DBDα did not interact with SmRXR1
nor SmRXR2 (Fig. 5A). The positive control plasmids,
pSV40/p53, grew on SD/-trp-his-leu plus 3 mM 3-AT
plates while the negative control plasmids, pSV40/plamin
C did not (Fig. 5A). The results show that Sm2DBDα can
interact as a homodimer, but can not interact with

Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from sequences of DNA binding domains
Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree derived from sequences of DNA binding domains. Amino acid sequences
were aligned with ClustalW. Phylogenetic relationships were examined by the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method under JonesTaylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model with a gamma distribution of rates between sites (eight categories, parameter alpha,
estimated by the program) using PHYML (v2.4.4)). Support values for the tree were obtained by bootstrapping a 100 replicates
and are indicated above each branch. Branches under the threshold value of 27 (this value was set to support subfamily II as a
monophyletic group) were shown as polytomies. The same data set was also tested by Bayesian inference. The trees were
started randomly with four simultaneous Markov chains running for 5 million generations. Bayesian posterior probabilities
(PPs) were calculated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach implemented in MrBAYES v3.1.1, the PPs
values are shown below each branch or after the ML bootstrapping value separated by a slash. Star indicates the node obtained
form by Bayesian inference which was different from that obtained by ML method. The accession number of each sequence
used for the phylogenetic analysis can be found in additional file 2 and 3.

SmRXR1 nor SmRXR2. As a strong dimer interface is
known to be located in the LBD [23,24], GST pull-down
experiments were performed (Fig. 5B). The results verified
that the LBDs of Sm2DBDα can form a homodimer in
vitro.

todes) after the split of Pseudocoelomates and Coelomates (Protostomes and Deuterostomes). As 2DBD-NRs
have not been found in Deuterostomes, they were lost in
the Deuterostome lineage after the split of Protostomes
and Deuterostomes (Fig. 6A).

Nuclear receptors act on target genes by recognizing and
binding to specific DNA core motifs in the promoter
region of target genes via their P-box motif located in the
DBD. The DNA core motif is a typical consensus hexameric sequence AGGTCA called a half-site. When NRs bind
to the half-site as a dimer, two P-boxes and a repeat of
half-site, with different orientations and spacings between
the half sites, are required. 2DBD-NR can interact as a
homodimer indicating that four P-boxes may be involved
in DNA binding, thus a novel mechanism of DNA binding, which requires two independent pairs of half-site
repeats, or four half-site repeats, each with unknown orientations and spacing, are predicted to exist to allow
2DBD-NR to bind to target DNA cis-elements. The protein
of the first DBD, second DBD and the first DBD with second DBD were tested for their ability to bind to a direct
repeat, an everted repeat and palindromes of the half-site
AGGTCA with 1–6 nucleotide spacings by electrphoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSAs). No binding compared to
controls was observed (data not shown). However, as the
flanking sequence of the AGGTCA motif and the spacing
between half sites also determines the protein binding to
the DNA element, further experiments will be performed
using different sets of templates and by determining DNA
binding sites using a PCR/EMSA-based approach.

If the molecular phylogeny hypothesis is correct, there
were two possibilities for 2DBD-NR origin. The 2DBD-NR
might originate in a common ancestor of Protostomes,
since 2DBD-NRs were identified both in Lophotrochozoans (Platyhelminths and Molluscs) and in Ecdysozoans
(Crustaceans) (Fig. 6B). The other possibility is that
2DBD-NR might originate in a common ancestor of the
Bilateria and was lost in the Deuterostome lineage after
the split of Protostomes and Deuterostomes. 2DBD-NR is
absent in nematodes suggesting that this gene was lost
after the split of the nematodes and arthropods. In arthropods, no 2DBD-NR was found in insects suggesting
2DBD-NR was lost after the split of insects and crustaceans (Fig. 6B).

Evolution of 2DBD-NRs
Metazoan phylogeny is still under debate [25-29]. In the
traditional view based on morphological and embryological characteristics, Bilateria comprise Acoelomates (such
as flatworms), Pseudocoelomates (Nematodes) and Coelomates (such as arthropods, mollusks and chordates)
[25,27,29] (Fig. 6A). A second view based on molecular
data (18S and 28S RNA genes, Hox genes, mitochondrial
gene order, concatenated mitochondrial genes and
myosin II heavy chain genes) support the Bilateria as comprising three clades: Deuterostomia, Lophotrochozoa and
Ecdysozoa [26,28,30-33]. In the molecular phylogeny
scheme, nematodes and arthropods are grouped into
Ecdysozoa, while flatworms and mollusks are grouped
into Lophotrochozoa (Fig. 6B). In an attempt to explain
the origin of the ancestor 2DBD-NR, both metazoan phylogenies were considered.

If the traditional phylogenetic scheme is correct, 2DBDNRs originated in a common ancestor of the Bilateria,
because 2DBD-NRs were found in both Acoelomates (flatworms) and Coelomates (mollusks and arthropods) (Fig.
6A). The 2DBD-NR was lost in Pseudocoelomates (nema-

The phylogeny of the Platyhelminths has itself been under
debate (eg. [34-37]). The Platyhelminths have always
played a central role in hypotheses concerning metazoan
phylogeny and evolution. Recently, many platyhelminth
flatworms, previously regarded in the traditional phylogeny as basal bilaterians (Fig. 6A), are now placed within
the lophotrochozoan protostomates (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the Acoelomorpha (Aceola + Nerertoderdermatida)
are no longer considered part of the Platyhelminths but
are still considered basal bilaterians [34-38]. Certainly,
further studies on nuclear receptor evolution in these taxa
can contribute to our understanding of the evolution of
the Metazoa and Bilateria, especially as nuclear receptors
have been identified in sponges [39], a group that is
hypothesized to have given rise to the hypothetical metazoan ancestor [40].
The duplication of 2DBD-NRs was deduced from phylogenetic analysis employing the first and the second DBD
sequences as a unit. Maximum Likelihood method and
Bayesian inference were performed and the same result
was obtained (Fig. 7A). Since the results show that there is
only one Arthropod, Mollusk and Platyhelminth 2DBDNR orthologue, the duplication of the ancient 2DBD-NR
first occurred after the split of Arthropods, Mollusks and
Platyhelminths (Fig. 7B). The absence of a 2DBD-NR in
the insect and nematode lineages supports this hypothesis, since it is likely that there was less of a chance for all
earlier duplicated genes to be lost in all the animals in
which no 2DBD-NR was found. The analysis also showed
that 2DBD-NRs underwent two rounds of duplication in a
common ancestor of the Platyhelminths that eventually
gave rise to three genes. The 2DBD-NRα and 2DBD-NRβ
are considered the most recently duplicated, since the

that the common ancestor gene of 2DBD-NRs underwent duplication after the split of the Arthropods, Molluscs and Platyhelminths. In Mollusks, the orthologue gene (γ) underwent a duplication giving rise to the α/β gene. In Platyhelminths, the
orthologue gene (γ) underwent a duplication giving rise to a new gene, this new gene underwent a recent duplication to give
birth to the two present genes (α and β genes). All three genes are present in the flatworm S. mansoni and the planarian S. mediterranea suggesting that the two rounds of 2DBD-NR duplication occurred in a common ancestor of the Platyhelminths.

tified by blast searching databases of S. mansoni BAC ends
and verified by PCR. Sm2DBDα, Sm2DBDβ and
Sm2DBDγ were localized on chromosomes by FISH using
BAC DNA as the probe (Fig. 8). The results show that
Sm2DBDα localized to chromosome 1. Sm2DBDβ is
located on sex chromosomes Z and W and chromosome 3
indicating that there are two copies of Sm2DBDβ. However, there are other possibilities. It could be a fourth gene.
However, we do not think that it is a fourth gene as we
should have found it in our search of the genome
sequence. It might be a pseudogene or a second copy of
the 2DBDβ gene. We favor a second copy of the genes as
the probe hybridizes to the euchromatic region of the Z
and W. However, we cannot rule out that it is an artifact
due to hybridization of a repetitive sequence in the BAC
clone. Sm2DBDγ is localized on chromosome 4. In figures
9a and 9c a repeat sequence in the BAC clones that commonly hybridizes to the W chromosome is shown as well.
The results suggest that 2DBD-NRs duplicated among different chromosomes in a common ancestor of the Platyhelminths.
Analysis of the NR superfamily, mainly in Drosophila and
vertebrates supports the hypothesis that evolution of
nuclear receptors occurred by two serial rounds of duplication [41-45]. The duplication of 2DBD-NRs suggests
that certain NR genes have undergone recent duplication
in invertebrates after the divergence of various clades
within the Bilateria. Our previous study of S. mansoni NRs
supports this hypothesis [6]. NRs in insects seem to have
undergone extensive gene loss. For example, a recently
identified estrogen receptor in the mollusk Aplysia californica [46] and two thyroid hormone receptors in the Platyhelminth S. mansoni [6,47] are missing in the insect
genera Drosophila and Anopheles. To address the importance of gene duplication in NR evolution, more invertebrates NR complements await to be analyzed.
Developmentally Regulated Expression
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate
mRNA expression of Sm2DBDα, Sm2DBDβ and
Sm2DBDγ. Normalized gene expression (ΔΔCT) [48] was
standardized to the relative quantities of S. mansoni αtubulin. Sm2DBDα was detected in secondary sporocysts,
cercariae, 21-day schistosomules, 28-day schistosomules,
female and male worms. Sm2DBDβ was expressed relatively high in eggs, secondary sporocysts, cercariae and
male stages. Sm2DBDγ was only detected in cercariae and
28-day worms. The results indicate that the three genes are
developmentally regulated and thus have a role in different development stages (Fig. 9). It is of note that
Sm2DBDγ, the putative ancestral gene is only expressed in
2 of the developmental stages studied and that both
Sm2DBDα and Sm2DBDβ show sex-specific gene expression.

Conclusion
A protein modular structure containing an AB domain,
two DNA binding domains in tandem, a hinge region and
a ligand binding domain (A/B-DBD-DBD-hinge-LBD)
represents a novel NR modular structure, and is named
2DBD-NR. 2DBD-NRs were identified from mollusks,
arthropods (crustaceans) and flatworms. 2DBD-NRs may
act as homodimers. 2DBD-NRs share a common ancestor
gene which possessed an extra DBD that likely resulted
from a recombination event. 2DBD-NRs were found in
flatworms, mollusks and arthropods whose phylogeny is
still under debate [30,31,33] (Fig. 6A and 6B). Further
studies of 2DBD-NR gene subfamily may contribute to
our understanding of gene duplication as an evolutionary
force and to the phylogeny of the Metazoa. The conserved
zinc finger motifs in each of the two DBDs are the most
readily recognized features of 2DBD-NRs. The P-box
sequences in the first DBD and the second DBD give
members of the 2DBD-NR their unique feature. This feature makes 2DBD-NRs an interesting gene subfamily for
studies of metazoan phylogeny.

Methods
Isolation of 2DBD-NR cDNAs in the Platyhelminth S.
mansoni
cDNAs encoding the entire open reading frame (ORF) of
three S. mansoni 2DBD-NRs (Sm2DBDα, Sm2DBDβ and
Sm2DBDγ) were isolated by a PCR strategy using a S. mansoni female worm cDNA library (pBluescript SK (+/-)
phagemid) pool as template DNA [6,22]. The PCR primers for one end (either 5' or 3' end) were designed according to a fragment encoding the previously identified DBD
region of these genes [6]. The primer for the other end
(either 5' or 3' end) was a vector universal primer (M13Rev and T3, or M13-For and T7 primers). PCR products
were separated on 1.2% agarose gels, ligated into pCR2.1
TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. After the correct fragments were identified, the cDNA sequence containing the 5' UTR, ORF and 3' UTR were obtained by
PCR. The cDNAs were shown to be related to a single
mRNA species by sequencing the PCR products obtained
from single-stranded cDNA using primers located within
the 5'UTR and 3'UTR of each gene.
Data mining
Whole genomic sequences (WGS) were extracted from the
GenBank public ftp site [49] (up to October 2005) and
imported into StarBlast program (DNASTAR) to build a
local database which was screened by tblastn using the
sequence of the first and second DBD of Sm2DBDα as the
query. Any sequence that contained a zinc finger structure
of the DBD (Cys-X2-Cys-X13-Cys-X2-Cys or Cys-X5-CysX9-Cys-X2-Cys) was retained. Sequence walking was carried out to assemble the contigs. Website databases of

Phylogenetic tree construction
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from deduced
sequences of the DBD and the LBD, respectively.
Sequences were aligned with ClustalW [53]. Phylogenetic
analysis of the data set was carried out using the Maximum Likelihood method under Jones-Taylor-Thornton
(JTT) substitution model [54] with a gamma distribution
of rates between sites (eight categories, parameter alpha,
estimated by the program) using PHYML (v2.4.4)) [55].
Support values for the tree were obtained by bootstrapping a 100 replicates. The same data set was also tested by
Bayesian inference using MrBAYES v3.1.1 with a mixed
amino acid replacement model + invgamma rates
(Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001). The trees were started
randomly; four simultaneous Markov chains were run for
5 million generations for the DBD data set and 3 million
generations for the LBD data set, respectively. The trees
were sampled every 100 generations. Bayesian posterior
probabilities (PPs) were calculated using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach implemented
in MrBAYES v3.1.1, with a burn-in value setting at 12,500

Yeast two-hybrid Assay: cDNA encoding Sm2DBDα was

self-activate as previously determined (data not shown),
cDNA encoding Sm2DBDα C-F domain was inserted into
pGBK-T7 to form pGBK-Sm2DBDα-C-F. Previously constructed SmRXR1, SmRXR1-C-F and SmRXR2 in activation domain vectors (pACT-SmRXR1 and pACTSmRXR2), and in DNA binding domain vectors (pASSmRXR1-CF and pAS-SmRXR2-AF) were employed

GST Pull-down: cDNA encoding Sm2DBDα E-F domain
was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 and pCITE-4a vectors to
form pGEX-Sm2DBDα-E-F and pCITE-Sm2DBDα-E-F,
respectively. E. coli AD 494 (DE3) pLys S competent cells
(Novagen) were transformed with pGEX-Sm2DBDα-E-F
and the GST fusion proteins were purified by passage over
a glutathione-Sepharose column according to standard
protocols. To produce 35S labeled protein, pCITESm2DBDα-E-F was transcribed and translated using the
Single Tube Protein System (Novagen) following the
manufacture's protocol. For pull-down experiments, a 50
μl reaction that contained 2 μl of the in vitro translation
reaction, Sm2DBDα-E-F GST fusion protein or GST protein (as negative control) affixed to glutathione-Sepharose
beads (about 2 μg) and binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.15% Nonidet
P40) was used [58]. The reaction was incubated overnight
at 4°C, washed three times with binding buffer and the
bound proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and
autoradiography.
BAC clone screening and localization of 2DBD-NRs on
chromosomes of S. mansoni
S. mansoni BAC clones containing Sm2DBD-NRs were
identified by screening the S. mansoni CHOR-1 BAC
library with methods previously described [59] or by blast
searching databases of S. mansoni BAC end sequences in
TIGR [60] and verified by PCR. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on S. mansoni sporocyst
metaphase chromosome spreads with BAC DNAs that
each contained one of the three S. mansoni 2DBD-NRs
(Sm2DBDα, Sm2DBDβ and Sm2DBDγ). FISH was performed using techniques previously described [61,62].
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
mRNA expression levels of three Sm2DBD-NRs
(Sm2DBDα, Sm2DBDβ and Sm2DBDγ) were tested in
eggs, daughter sporocysts, cercariae, 21-day, 28-day, adult
female and adult male worms. A Puerto-Rican strain of S.
mansoni was maintained in snails(Biomphalaria glabrata)
and Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Cercariae were released from infected snails and harvested on
ice. Schistosome worms of different ages (21–45 day-old)
were harvested from infected Syrian golden hamsters. Single-sex worms were obtained by separating adult worm
pairs. Parasite eggs were obtained from livers of infected
hamsters. Total RNA was extracted from the above developmental stages using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). All
RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNaseI (RQ1
DNase; Promega) and reverse transcribed using a random
hexamer and SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase II (SSRTaseII; Invitrogen) as previously described [6]. Primers spe(forward:

5'ATGTACTGTTTCATTGCATTCATTTG-3') were designed
using Primer Express Program (Applied Biosystems™).
Primers specific for S. mansoni α-tubulin [GenBank:
M80214] were according to [63]. Reverse-transcribed
cDNA samples were used as templates for PCR amplification using SYBR Green Master Mix® (Invitrogen) and BIORAD IQ™5 Real-Time PCR Detection System. The
efficiency for each primer set is evaluated and recorded
during assay development by iQ5 application (cDNA
diluted to x1, x10, x100 and x1000 folds). Normalized
gene expression (ΔΔCT) [48] of Sm2DBDα, Sm2DBDβ
and Sm2DBDγ were standardized to the relative quantities
of S. mansoni tubulin using BioRad IQ™5 Optical System
software V1.1 with the Normalized Expression calculations implemented in iQ5. For graphical representation of
the expression, the normalized expression was recalculated by dividing the expression level of each stage of the
all gene by the highest expression level.
