Abstract
Background: Microsporidia are a group of parasites related to fungi that infect a wide variety of
animals and have gained recognition from the medical community in the past 20 years due to their
ability to infect immuno-compromised humans. Microsporidian genomes range in size from 2.3 to
19.5 Mbp, but almost all of our knowledge comes from species that have small genomes (primarily
from the human parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi and the locust parasite Antonospora locustae). We
have conducted an EST survey of the mosquito parasite Edhazardia aedis, which has an estimated
genome size several times that of more well-studied species. The only other microsporidian EST
project is from A. locustae, and serves as a basis for comparison with E. aedis.
Results: The spore transcriptomes of A. locustae and E. aedis were compared and the numbers of
unique transcripts that belong to each COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins)
category differ by at most 5%. The transcripts themselves have widely varying start sites and encode
a number of proteins that have not been found in other microsporidia examined to date. However,
E. aedis seems to lack the multi-gene transcripts present in A. locustae and E. cuniculi. We also
present the first documented case of transcription of a transposable element in microsporidia.
Conclusion: Although E. aedis and A. locustae are distantly related, have very disparate life cycles
and contain genomes estimated to be vastly different sizes, their patterns of transcription are
similar. The architecture of the ancestral microsporidian genome is unknown, but the presence of
genes in E. aedis that have not been found in other microsporidia suggests that extreme genome
reduction and compaction is lineage specific and not typical of all microsporidia.

Background
Microsporidia are single-celled eukaryotic intracellular
parasites that are related to fungi. Currently, over 1200
species have been identified, infecting animals from
nearly every phylum, including commercially important
species such as honeybees and fish, as well as humans [1].
Inside host cells, microsporidia proliferate as vegetative
stages (meronts, schizonts) which eventually produce
spores that are released when the host cell lyses. Spores

possess a unique host cell invasion apparatus called the
polar filament, which is forcefully everted upon germination to form a tube and can pierce a nearby host cell [1].
The tube then acts as a conduit allowing the contents of
the spore to be injected into the host cell's cytoplasm,
where the parasite undergoes vegetative replication.
Microsporidia are a diverse group of organisms, and vary
greatly in the complexity of their life cycles. For instance,

Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Antonospora locustae produce
only one type of spore (uninucleate in the former and
binucleate in the latter), and complete their entire life
cycles inside one host individual, while Amblyospora californica requires two host groups (mosquitoes and microcrustacea) and produces three morphologically and
functionally discrete spore types [1].
Microsporida possess some of the smallest primary
nuclear genomes known (as tiny as 2.3 Mbp). The only
microsporidian whose genome has been completely
sequenced is the human parasite, E. cuniculi. At a meager
2.9 Mbp, E. cuniculi's genome is extremely compact, with
only 2000 genes [2]. A small genome sequence survey
(GSS) project has been conducted on A. locustae, a locust
parasite that has been approved as a biological control
agent in the United States [3]. A. locustae's genome is
roughly 5.4 Mbp in size [4], or about twice the size of E.
cuniculi's genome. Despite the genome size difference,
both genomes appear to be structured in much the same
way. Genes are closely packed (nearly one gene per kilobase), are small in size compared to homologues in animals and fungi, and are intron-poor. There is also a much
greater degree of synteny between these two organisms
than would be expected given their phylogenetic relationship, which implies that although microsporidian genes
are fast-evolving, genomic rearrangements occur only
rarely [3] (See Fig. 1).
However, we have very little information on microsporidian genomes of larger sizes. Edhazardia aedis is a microsporidian that infects Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of
the Dengue hemorrhagic and yellow fever viruses. E. aedis
has been intensively studied as a viable biological control
agent for A. aegypti [5] and has a genome estimated to be
to be many times larger than that of E. cuniculi. There are
several possible explanations for this difference: E. aedis
may have more genes that control its complex life cycle.
Genes may also be longer, more widely spaced, and contain more introns than E. cuniculi [2].
Morphological studies conducted on E. aedis have
revealed at least four different types of spores – two uninucleate and two binucleate [6,7]. The two types of uninucleate spore types differ morphologically but possess
similar pyriform shapes. However, the cell division events
from which they arise differ. Spores produced via mitosis
are roughly 8.5 μm in length, whereas spores produced via
meiosis (meiospores) are about 7.5 μm. Small binucleate
spores (~6.5 μm in length) that have short polar filaments
are formed first, followed by the production of larger
binucleate spores (~9 μm in length) that are ovoid in
shape. Meiospore formation is usually abortive and rarely
produces normal spores [6].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/296

E. aedis' life cycle is moderately complex and involves two
generations of the mosquito host. It begins when a uninucleate spore is ingested by a mosquito larva from the environment. Once in the gut, the spore germinates and
begins to multiply in the host tissue. Within 48 hours,
small binucleate spores are formed that are responsible
for spread to other tissues. Orally infected larvae generally
exhibit reduced growth, and may die before reaching
maturity if the parasite load is high, thus releasing more
spores into the environment. However, if the infection
load is sufficiently small, the larva will mature into an
adult mosquito and survive to reproduce [6]. If the adult
mosquito is female, large binucleate spores will develop
in her ovaries and will infect oocytes, thus passing the
infection on to the next generation where the majority of
mortality occurs in larvae. Little is known about the factors that modulate the transition from one phase in the
life cycle to the next, or about the changes in gene expression that occur during these transitions.
It is also possible that the difference in genome size
between E. aedis and E. cuniculi or A. locustae may have less
to do with the number of genes, and more to do with
genome architecture. E. aedis genes could be longer, more
widely spaced, and contain more introns than E. cuniculi
[2]. In an effort to learn more about E. aedis' genome, a
GSS of >200 kbp was conducted [8]. This study concluded
that E. aedis' genome structure is very different from those
of E. cuniculi and A. locustae. A large portion of the genome
is occupied by non-coding DNA and genes are not closely
packed together, although the existence of local areas of
compaction could not be ruled out.
Previous examinations of ESTs from microsporidia have
only been conducted on microsporidia with small
genomes. These transcripts possessed unusual features
that are atypical in eukaryotes. Examinations of ESTs from
A. locustae [9] and transcripts from E. cuniculi revealed
numerous multi-gene transcripts. These transcripts are different from prokaryotic operons, as the proteins encoded
by the transcript do not have related functions and are
often not encoded on the same DNA strand. Many transcripts encode only a portion of one gene, while the other
is present in its entirety [9,10]. The reason for this phenomenon is not known, but it has been suggested that
transcriptional control elements have been lost (or moved
into adjacent genes) during the process of genome compaction [10].
As E. aedis' genome and life cycle are very different from E.
cuniculi and A. locustae, it is reasonable to assume that the
transcript structure and number of genes present may differ as well. In this study, we describe the first survey of
ESTs from a microsporidian with a much larger genome
size and complex life cycle. In sequencing over 1300 tran-

and composition. Surprisingly, the E. aedis uninucleate
spore transcriptome is remarkably similar to that of A.
locustae.

the remaining 78 were represented by two or more. 97 of
the 133 unique genes are present in other microsporidia
(See Table 1), while 10 are present in other (non-microsporidian) organisms (See Table 2), 18 are putatively E.
aedis-specific and 8 have no apparent open reading
frames. Coding sequences contained 43% G+C while 5'
and 3' untranslated regions possessed 27% and 26%,
respectively.
Approximately a quarter of the transcripts analyzed coded
for Hsp70. Almost all of the Hsp70 sequences were most
similar to the "heat shock related 70 kDa protein" found

in E. cuniculi (NP_597563). Single nucleotide variation
exists between sequences, usually as 3rd position synonymous substitutions. Where non-synonymous substitutions exist, they are always a single nucleotide and there
are no indels between sequences. Mitochondrial-type and
DNAK-like Hsp70s were also represented.
Genes were assigned to COG categories to allow for comparison with A. locustae. Figure 2 illustrates the percentages of total E. aedis transcripts that are dedicated to each
COG category. Total A. locustae transcripts are provided
for comparative purposes. As the randomness of the
library is uncertain, it is possible that some transcripts are

artificially overrepresented. It is therefore more informative to examine unique transcripts (ie. counting multiple
transcripts for the same gene only once) rather than total
transcripts. Figure 3 displays the percentages of unique E.
aedis and A. locustae transcripts dedicated to each category.
Surprisingly, the values are similar and sometimes identical (maximum difference between E. aedis and A. locustae
categories is 5%).
Notable transcripts include a retrotransposon that is similar to LTR retrotransposons present in Sorghum bicolor
(AAD27571) and Nosema bombycis (ABE26655). All
belong to the Ty3/Gypsy family of retrotransposons. E.
aedis also possesses a methionine aminopeptidase 2 gene
(MetAP-2), which is present in E. cuniculi. There were several transcripts present that appear homologous to proteins found in various eukaryotes, but are absent in other
microsporidia examined to date. These include hypothetical or unknown proteins found in Oryza, Danio and Plasmodium, as well as genes encoding proteins with identified
functions, such as an adenosine kinase, a lysine-tRNA
ligase and an L-asparaginase (See Table 2). In addition, E.
aedis encodes a putative hydrolase-like protein that is
present in A. locustae, but absent in E. cuniculi.
E. cuniculi and A. locustae both contain a small number of
introns in their genomes and consequently, they have
retained a minimal set of splicing machinery. These two
organisms are not closely related (See Fig. 1), but they do
share a few conserved introns [11]. Therefore, there is reason to suspect that some of these introns may also be
present in E. aedis. Fortunately, seven transcripts of the
gene encoding ribosomal protein L5 (which contains an
intron in E. cuniculi) were recovered from the E. aedis
library. These sequences were used to design primers to
amplify the L5 gene from genomic DNA. It was found that
the E. aedis L5 gene does not contain an intron.

Transcript structure
As E. aedis is an intracellular parasite and therefore cannot
be easily cultured, RNA was limited and the library could
not be constructed in a 5' cap-dependent manner. Therefore, nearly all of the inserts encoding the same gene were
of different lengths, and most were 5' truncated. However,
some of E. aedis' transcripts appear to have very long 5'
untranslated regions (UTRs) of several hundred base
pairs. To further assess transcript structure, cap-dependent
5' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) was conducted on transcripts from a moderately represented gene,
glucosamine fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase. 5'
RACE confirmed that transcript lengths for this gene do
vary, with 5' UTRs ranging from 255 to 348 bp (See Fig.
4).

Contrary to the variable start sites of the transcripts, nearly
all appear to have identical end sites. The notable exceptions are the heat shock related 70 kDa protein transcripts,
which have somewhat variable 3' polyadenylation sites.
There were frequently single nucleotide differences
between sequences in contigs, but these differences were
usually restricted to silent third position substitutions. In
instances where the substitutions are not silent, they are
conservative amino acid substitutions. These differences
could represent different copies of the same gene or different alleles within the population (UTRs were not available
in most cases to determine which).

Discussion
Comparing microsporidian transcriptomes
This is the second microsporidian EST project to be conducted and the first from a microsporidian possessing a
large genome, allowing for a meaningful comparison of
microsporidian spore transcriptomes. Despite the vast differences in genome size and life cycle complexity between
E. aedis and A. locustae, their transcriptomes are highly
similar in their compositions. The proportions of unique

transcripts encoding proteins devoted to the "protein destination" COG category in both E. aedis and A. locustae are
relatively large (19% and 16%, respectively) (See Fig. 3).
It is interesting to note that proteomic work correlates
with these results, as the number of proteins in E. cuniculi

identical (See Fig. 3). The largest differences lie in the categories of cellular organization and biogenesis, cellular
communication and signal transduction and cell rescue,
defense, cell death and aging. One notable difference
between the two spore transcriptomes is that no transposable elements were recovered in the A. locustae ESTs,
whereas E. aedis transcribes a retrotransposon of the Ty3/
gypsy family. Transposable elements have been previously reported to exist in the genomes of Nosema bombycis
[13], Spraguea lophii [14], Brachiola algerae and E. aedis [8]
(See below). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
instance of documented transposable element transcription in microsporidia, and could indicate active transposition.
Nearly 8% of the unique transcripts from E. aedis encode
genes that are present in various eukaryotes, but are
absent from other microsporidia. The existence of these
genes has several possible explanations. Sequence data
from microsporidia is scarce, and the only completely
sequenced genome is that of E. cuniculi. Therefore, it is
currently impossible to assert that these genes are absent
in any microsporidia other than E. cuniculi. The possibility
exists that they were present in the genome of the microsporidian ancestor, and were lost during genome reduction/compaction events in E. cuniculi. These genes could
also have arisen from lateral transfer events or they could
have come to resemble genes in other organisms by
chance or by convergence. Parsimoniously, the first explanation seems most likely, therefore, these data seem to

suggest that the ancestor of microsporidia was not,
indeed, compact to the extent of E. cuniculi.
The MetAP-2 protein is a target for drug therapy in E.
cuniculi [15]. The E. aedis copy of the MetAP-2 gene is very
similar to that present in E. cuniculi, and contains the
amino acid residues that bind the drug fumagillin as well
as those believed to coordinate metals. Like E. cuniculi, E.
aedis lacks a polylysine tract at the N-terminus of the
MetAP-2 protein that is present in animals, other fungi
and plants. This tract plays a role in hindering the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α),
and its absence indicates that the microsporidian proteins
likely lack this function [15].
Although our work indicates that the E. aedis L5 gene does
not contain an intron like its E. cuniculi homologue (see
Results, above), there is reason to believe that there are
introns elsewhere in the genome. There are several transcripts encoding proteins that act in pre-mRNA splicing:
an arginine/serine rich pre-mRNA splicing factor
(NP_597487 in E. cuniculi), a pre-mRNA splicing factor
(NP_586183 in E. cuniculi) and a U5 associated snRNP
(NP_586393 in E. cuniculi). These genes comprise 2.2% of
the total unique genes found.
Hsp70
Roughly 28% of total E. aedis transcripts encoded some
form of Hsp70, a heat shock protein that assists in the
folding of other proteins. Hsp70 helps prevent proteins

sites. ESTs are depicted in green and RACE products in purple. The predicted translational start codon is indicated by the

from becoming insoluble and also plays a role in various
other intracellular processes, such as apoptosis [16]. The
action of Hsp70 allows mutant proteins to continue functioning by being refolded instead of being degraded,
which necessitates the costly synthesis of more protein.
The number of Hsp70 transcripts in the E. aedis ESTs is an
order of magnitude higher than was found in A. locustae
(2%) [17]. We are cautious in this interpretation as we
have not quantitatively assessed the transcription level of
Hsp70 in E. aedis, and it is likely that transcripts of this
protein are somewhat overrepresented in the library.
Although no E. cuniculi ESTs have been published, Brosson et al. [12] investigated the proteins present in spores.
Hsp70 constitutes a moderate amount of all protein
present. Brosson and his colleagues classified all proteins
based on their COG categories, and found that all "protein destination" proteins together comprise 21% of E.
cuniculi's proteome. Intriguingly, Brosson et al.'s [12]
experiments indicate that of the four copies of Hsp70 in E.
cuniculi, the predominately expressed copy of Hsp70 in E.
cuniculi is homologous to the highly represented transcript in E. aedis. In A. locustae, the most highly transcribed
copy was most similar to the abundantly transcribed copy
in E. aedis as well [17]. Therefore, it is likely that microsporidia employ similar primary mechanisms to ensure
proper folding of proteins.

In other parasites and endosymbionts, such as Buchnera
aphidicola, Hsp70 is also highly expressed [18] and may
constitute up to 10% of the protein contained in the cell
at any one time. In species that lead parasitic or endosymbiotic lifestyles, genetic drift and relaxed selection pressure frequently lead to an increased mutation rate. The
need for Hsp70 in order for proteins to fold correctly
seems to increase with both the size and number of mutations in the protein [16]. Although microsporidian
genomes appear to have had little rearrangement, the
nucleotide mutation rate seems to be high in this group of
organisms [19,20]. Microsporidia could, therefore, contain elevated levels of Hsp70 in order to allow folding of
mutant proteins.
Transposable elements
One of the E. aedis ESTs closely matches the integrase
domain of the Ty3/gypsy family of retrotransposons. Several of these elements were identified in a GSS of E. aedis
[8] and a few other microsporidian species, but to the best
of our knowledge, this is the first instance in which transcripts of any microsporidian retrotransposon have been
found. Transcripts could be indicative of active transposition occurring in E. aedis' genome.

Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons exist in many organisms ranging from the microsporidia Spraguea lophii [14], Brachiola
algerae [8], and Nosema bombycis [13] to Saccharomyces,

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:296

Drosophila and Sorghum. Ty3 elements have been well
characterized in budding yeast, and exist in 1–4 copies per
genome, where they are transcribed by RNA polymerase
III. Transcription typically occurs only in haploid cells in
the presence of mating pheromones [21]. The N. bombycis
genome contains at least 8 different retrotransposons in
the Ty3/gypsy family, but unlike yeast, they are not exclusively located upstream of tRNAs [13]. Nearly all N. bombycis retrotransposons encode a polyprotein containing 5
domains, which exist in a defined order: Gag, protease,
reverse transcriptase, RnaseH and integrase. As many of
the sequences in the E. aedis library appear to be 5' truncated, it is possible that the other domains upstream of
the integrase in the polyprotein are also present in
genomic DNA. Indeed, the GSS project revealed
sequences matching the reverse transcriptase domain [8].
Although the microsporidian Vittaforma corneae is also
known to possess at least one transposable element [22],
it belongs to a different family than those present in E.
aedis - the L1 family present in humans.
The only completely sequenced microsporidian genome,
that of E. cuniculi [2], is completely devoid of transposable
elements. The existence of similar transposable elements
(of the Ty3/gypsy family) in the distantly related S. lophii,
N. bombycis, B. algerae and E. aedis (See Fig. 1) implies that
this element may have been present in the genome of the
ancestor of microsporidia. Therefore, the process of
genome compaction that gave rise to the E. cuniculi
genome likely involved purging transposable elements.
It has been suggested that transposable elements may act
to reorganize genes within the genome. Xu et al. [13] compared regions of synteny between N. bombycis and E.
cuniculi chromosomes, as selection appears to be acting to
retain gene synteny among microsporidia, even if they are
only distantly related [3]. In N. bombycis, transposable elements flank these syntenic regions [13]. If E. aedis' large
genome is partially a product of transposable element
proliferation, one would expect much less synteny
between this species and other microsporidia. Perhaps
future research will elucidate other roles that transposable
elements have played in shaping microsporidian
genomes, especially since the minute genome of E.
cuniculi seems to lack them, while they are present in
larger genomes.
The functions that these transposable elements perform in
a given genome are cryptic at best, but evidence is emerging that they may be more than just simply parasitic DNA.
Peaston et al. [23] recently discovered that a class of
mouse retrotransposons appears to regulate gene expression in embryos.

Transcript structure
Transcripts in A. locustae typically contain more than one
gene. These transcripts do not necessarily contain complete open reading frames for all genes and the genes are
frequently in opposite orientations [9]. It is not known
how many proteins are made from each transcript or
whether this situation is typical for microsporidia, but
recent work by Corradi et al. [10] suggests that E. cuniculi
also possesses multi-gene transcripts.

Unlike A. locustae and E. cuniculi, E. aedis appears to transcribe very few multi-gene transcripts, if any at all. This is
not unexpected, given that E. aedis genes appear to be separated by large intergenic spaces [8]. The E. aedis GSS
could not rule out the possibility that local areas of compacted genes might exist [8]. Given the lack of multi-gene
transcripts identified, this seems increasingly unlikely.
Also contrary to what is found in A. locustae, nearly all of
E. aedis' transcripts encode proteins in a positive frame
(<1% are in a negative frame, compared to 17% in A.
locustae) [9]. Although antisense transcripts are used in
many organisms (possibly also A. locustae) to suppress
translation, it appears unlikely that this type of regulation
occurs in E. aedis. Conversely, the large number of antisense transcripts in A. locustae may be due to a lack of transcriptional regulation resulting from genome compaction.
E. aedis' transcripts seem to start at multiple locations
upstream of the start codon (5' UTR length is 180 bp on
average) but terminate at the same position with a relatively short 3' UTR (51 bp on average) (See, for example,
Figure 4). This is more in line with transcription in E.
cuniculi and contrasts with the situation in A. locustae,
where transcripts start directly upstream of the translation
initiation site, but often terminate much farther downstream in the adjacent gene [10]. For comparison, the
yeast S. cerevisiae contains much shorter 5' UTRs than 3'
UTRs (15–75 and ~144 bp, respectively [24,25]), a common trend seen in other fungi, plants and animals. The
reason for this reversal is unknown, since 3' UTRs are
ubiquitously used as translation regulators. It is likely that
E. aedis lacks some of the translational control mechanisms present in other fungi, plants and animals [26].

Conclusion
This is the first examination of ESTs from a microsporidian containing a large genome. The extent of genome
compaction in the microsporidian ancestor is not known,
but the presence of genes in E. aedis that have not been
found in other microsporidia suggests that extreme reduction and compaction occurred only in specific lineages.
Surprisingly, E. aedis has a predicted uninucleate spore
transcriptome that is highly similar to that of the distantly

life cycles and genome sizes.

Methods
Uninucleate E. aedis spores were grown and harvested
from A. aegypti larvae as described previously [27].
E. aedis spores were lysed in Ambion's plant RNA isolation
aid and lysis/binding solution from an Ambion RNAqueous kit using a bead beater operating at 2500 rpm for 6
minutes with glass beads. RNA was extracted from the
resulting supernatant using the RNAqueous kit. A microquantity cDNA library was constructed by Marligen, using
the pExpress-1 vector. 1307 clones with an average insert
size of 1.5 kb were uni-directionally sequenced using an
automated capillary sequencer. Sequences were manually
edited and analyzed using Sequencher 4.2 software. Proteins encoded by the transcripts were identified via
BLASTX [28] searches performed on the NCBI website
(Genbank). Transcripts were identified as encoding a particular protein when BLASTX hits to Genbank proteins
had e-values of 10-4 or lower. Transcripts were scored as
"present in other microsporidia" when the best BLASTX
hit was a gene present in other microsporidia or when the
best hit was a gene that has a microsporidian homologue,
and the homologue was identified in other microsporidia
by BLASTing the E. aedis transcript against available
microsporidian data. Putative E. aedis-specific genes are
transcripts that contain open reading frames at least 100
base pairs in size and do not have any BLASTX hits with evalues lower than 10-3. In order to facilitate access to the
EST sequences, they were uploaded and annotated by the
dbEST website [17].
