Abstract
Background: Decisions to initiate conservation programmes need to account for extant variability, diversity loss and
cultural and economic aspects. Molecular markers were used to investigate if putative Algarvia animals could be
identified for use as progenitors in a breeding programme to recover this nearly extinct breed.
Methods: 46 individuals phenotypically representative of Algarvia cattle were genotyped for 27 microsatellite loci and
compared with 11 Portuguese autochthonous and three imported breeds. Genetic distances and factorial
correspondence analyses (FCA) were performed to investigate the relationship among Algarvia and related breeds.
Assignment tests were done to identify representative individuals of the breed. Y chromosome and mtDNA analyses
were used to further characterize Algarvia animals. Gene- and allelic-based conservation analyses were used to
determine breed contributions to overall genetic diversity.
Results: Genetic distance and FCA results confirmed the close relationship between Algarvia and southern Portuguese
breeds. Assignment tests without breed information classified 17 Algarvia animals in this cluster with a high probability
(q > 0.95). With breed information, 30 cows and three bulls were identified (q > 0.95) that could be used to reconstitute
the Algarvia breed. Molecular and morphological results were concordant. These animals showed intermediate levels
of genetic diversity (MNA = 6.0 ± 1.6, Rt = 5.7 ± 1.4, Ho = 0.63 ± 0.19 and He = 0.69 ± 0.10) relative to other Portuguese
breeds. Evidence of inbreeding was also detected (Fis = 0.083, P < 0.001). The four Algarvia bulls had Y-haplotypes H6Y2
and H11Y2, common in Portuguese cattle. The mtDNA composition showed prevalence of T3 matrilines and presence
of the African-derived T1a haplogroup. This analysis confirmed the genetic proximity of Algarvia and Garvonesa breeds
(Fst = 0.028, P > 0.05). Algarvia cattle provide an intermediate contribution (CB = 6.18, CW = -0.06 and D1 = 0.50) to the
overall gene diversity of Portuguese cattle. Algarvia and seven other autochthonous breeds made no contribution to
the overall allelic diversity.
Conclusions: Molecular analyses complemented previous morphological findings to identify 33 animals that can be
considered remnants of the Algarvia breed. Results of genetic diversity and conservation analyses provide objective
information to establish a management program to reconstitute the Algarvia breed.
Background
Breeding practices designed to alleviate production constraints are prejudicial to the survival of traditional
domestic animal breeds, and tend to lead to impoverishment of the gene pool [1]. The Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations has encouraged a
series of conservation measures designed to help prevent

irreversible loss of diversity of domesticated animal species [2]. A heightened awareness of the cultural, historical
and social heritage represented by traditional breeds has
led to increased interest in their preservation [3]. Despite
its small geographic area, Portugal hosts a wide variety of
domestic breeds [4], with as many as 13 autochthonous
cattle breeds recognized [4,5]. Analysis of genetic diversity of some of these breeds has used blood protein polymorphisms [6], microsatellite variation [7-12],
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [13,14] and Y chromosome sequence variation [15]. These studies have shown

that, among European cattle, the Mirandesa breed is one
of the most important targets for preservation based on
its contribution to diversity [8]. In general, southern
European cattle appear to represent particularly important reservoirs of genetic diversity [16].
Algarvia cattle are native to the Algarve region of
southern Portugal and were first represented in 1868 [17]
and later described with more details [18-23]. Based on
its morphology, the breed has been classified in the
Aquitanian (or Red Convex) group, together with Alentejana, Mertolenga, Garvonesa and Minhota [23,24].
Except for Minhota, these breeds are distributed
throughout the southern river Tagus valley. Algarvia cattle were used predominantly for meat production and/or
draft. Although they were never formally registered as an
independent breed, 25,000 - 29,000 animals were officially catalogued between 1940 and 1970 [25]. Since then,
the population has declined rapidly and the breed was
considered to be effectively extinct by the 1980s [1], an
event that subjected the Regional Agricultural Authorities to criticism for failure to implement proper conservation measures.
The morphology of eight autochthonous Portuguese
cattle breeds has been analyzed by numerical taxonomic
methods [26], and these analyses have been extended
recently to include animals thought to derive from the
Algarvia breed [27]. This study identified a uniform
group of animals that shared many of the phenotypic
characteristics of that breed. These remnants were preserved mainly for cultural reasons by traditional breeders
in different areas of Algarve and southern Alentejo
regions.
In the present study, we have characterized these putative Algarvia animals using nuclear microsatellites, Y
chromosome markers and mtDNA sequences to determine to which extent they can be genetically distinguished from related autochthonous breeds, and to
identify individuals that would represent suitable progenitors for a breeding programme to reconstitute the Algarvia breed.

Methods
Sampling procedure

Forty-six animals (42 females and four males) were chosen from ten independent herds and consisted of individuals thought to derive from the Algarvia cattle on the
basis of phenotypic similarity, as judged by traditional
farmers with experience on the breed characteristics [27].
Additionally, samples from Garvonesa (29) and Preta
(47) breeds were collected because they are present
throughout the southern region of the country and
admixture with Algarvia cannot be excluded. The herds
in which putative Algarvia individuals were located also
had animals from the Alentejana breed. A 9 ml whole

Page 2 of 11

blood sample was collected from each individual by jugular venipuncture in tubes containing EDTA-K3 as anticoagulant. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes
using the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems,
Minneapolis, USA).
Microsatellite genotyping

A set of 27 microsatellite markers (BM1818, BM1824,
BM203, BM2113, BM2613, BRRIBO, CSSM36, CYP21,
ETH10, ETH152, ETH225, ETH3, HEL11, HEL13, HEL9,
ILSTS035, ILSTS065, INRA023, MGTG4B, RM006,
RM067, SPS115, TGLA122, TGLA126, TGLA227,
TGLA345 and TGLA53) was used to genotype each animal. Multiplex PCR were performed using fluorescencelabelled primers, as described by Mateus et al. [12]. PCR
products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on
ABI PRISM® 310 instruments (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) and fragment size analysis was done with
STRand software [28]. Genotypes from nine Portuguese
autochthonous and three imported breeds were obtained
from Mateus et al. [12,29], thus the complete dataset
included, in addition to the above breeds, Alentejana (50
individuals), Arouquesa (50), Barrosã (50), Brava de Lide
(40), Minhota (50), Marinhoa (51), Maronesa (47), Mertolenga (50) and Mirandesa (50), Charolais (45), Friesian
(35) and Limousin (48). Reference samples were included
in all PCR assays to standardize allele sizing across datasets.
Statistical analysis of microsatellite data

Allele frequencies were determined with GENALEX version 6 [30]. The software GENEPOP version 3.4 [31] was
used to perform global and per locus/per population
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) tests, and to test for
genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD). Exact probability
tests were done for loci with four or fewer alleles; otherwise, a Markov chain method was employed [31] with
10,000 dememorization steps, 500 batches and 5,000 iterations. GENETIX version 4.02 [32] was used to estimate
within-population observed (Ho) and unbiased expected
(He) heterozygosities [33], the mean number of alleles
(MNA), and inbreeding coefficients (Fis) [34]. The statistical significance of Fis > 0 was obtained based on 1,000
permutations. Pairwise population Fst values were calculated with FSTAT version 2.9.3 [35] and P-values
obtained based on 1,000 randomizations. This software
was also used to estimate allelic richness (Rt) per locus
and population. To investigate breed relationships, neighbour-joining (N-J) dendrograms [36] were constructed
from DA genetic distances [37] using POPULATIONS
version 1.2.28 [38]. Bootstrap values were obtained with
1,000 replicates over loci. A dendrogram based on allelesharing distances between individuals was also con-

structed using this software. TREEVIEW version 1.6.6
[39] was used to visualize and edit the dendrograms. A
factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) was done with
GENETIX to investigate relationships among individuals.
Assignment tests were performed to identify individuals
most representative of the Algarvia breed and to detect
admixture. STRUCTURE version 2.2 [40] was used to
estimate the most probable number of population clusters (K). The analysis was done without prior information
on populations, assuming correlated allele frequencies
and admixture [41]. Ten independent runs with 100,000
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations and
10,000 burn-in were performed at each K (1 ≤ K ≤ 9) to
calculate ΔK as in Evanno et al. [42]. A longer run
(1,000,000 iterations and 100,000 burn-in) was done for
the most probable K to determine the number of individuals within each cluster. An assignment test with these
settings but including prior breed information was also
performed. The partially Bayesian simulation-exclusion
procedures of GENECLASS version 2.0 [43] were used
for assignment tests with 10,000 Monte Carlo resamplings of individuals [44-46].
The contribution of each population to the overall
genetic diversity was analysed considering the within(CW) and between-breed (CB) diversity components,
and aggregate genetic diversity (D1 = Fst*CB + (1Fst)*CW) as described by Ollivier and Foulley [47].
METAPOP software version 1.0.2. [48] was used to
account for allelic diversity and estimate the contribution
of each population (ci) to a pool of maximal genetic diversity [49]. Equal weights were given to within- and
between-breed coancestries (λ = l). The average molecular coancestry (fm) of each population was also obtained
with this software.
Analysis of Y chromosome markers

The four putative Algarvia males were genotyped for one
SNP (UTY intron 19 AY936543: g.423C > A), one indel
(ZFY intron 10 AF241271: g.697_8indelGT), and five microsatellites (DDX3Y_1, BM861, INRA189, UMN0103 and
UMN0307) located in the male-specific region of the
bovine Y chromosome. Analyses were done as described
by Ginja et al. [15] for a comparison with previously identified patrilines in Portuguese autochthonous breeds.
Analysis of mtDNA sequence variation

A 919 bp PCR fragment containing the complete mtDNA
control region was obtained and sequenced for Algarvia
animals. The analysis was done as described by Ginja et
al. [50] and sequences were aligned with the taurine reference sequence [GenBank: V00654, [51]] using the Multalin
interface
http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin/
multalin.html. Haplotypes were identified with
GENALEX [30] and ARLEQUIN version 2.0 [52] was

Page 3 of 11

used to calculate haplotype diversity (H), nucleotide
diversity (π), and the mean number of pairwise nucleotide differences (MNPD) accounting for heterogeneity
of substitution rates per site [53]. mtDNA sequences of
the southern Portuguese autochthonous breeds and the
imported Limousin were obtained from the GenBank
database [accession numbers: FJ815445-59, FJ815525-40,
FJ815573-88, FJ815620-35 and FJ815880-95] and used in
ARLEQUIN to estimate pairwise-population Fst values
(5% significance level obtained with 10,000 permutations). A Median-Joining (MJ) network of haplotypes was
constructed with NETWORK version 4.5.10 [54] software to investigate breed relationships.

Results
Genetic relationships between Algarvia and other breeds

The genetic distance analysis confirmed that the putative
Algarvia animals were close to the southern Garvonesa
and Alentejana breeds, and distant from northern breeds
such as Mirandesa (Additional file 1 Figure S1). It also
showed that this group of animals was more closely
related to Preta than to Brava de Lide, both of which are
considered to belong to the Black Orthoid breed group.
Relationships among the individuals of Algarvia and of
southern Portuguese breeds that clustered with Algarvia
in Additional file 1 Figure S1 are shown in the N-J dendrogram of allele sharing distances in Figure 1. Limousin
cattle was included in the analysis because they are raised
in the southern region of Portugal and have been used to
upgrade the autochthonous breeds [24]. Thirty-two
Algarvia animals formed two closely related subgroups
each containing a few Alentejana animals. Five Algarvia
individuals clustered with Garvonesa (AG24, AG27,
AG33, AG34 and AG35), four with Preta (AG40, AG41,
AG42 and AG43) and five with Mertolenga (AG12,
AG17, AG23, AG32 and AG37). Results of the FCA
showed that Preta is the most distant breed but that
among southern Portuguese breeds including Algarvia
genetic differentiation was weak (Additional file 2 Figure
S2). The relationships among individuals represented in
the FCA graph were consistent with those shown in Figure 1.
Assignment of Algarvia cattle

STRUCTURE analyses assume that within a population
all loci are in HWE and linkage equilibrium [40].
Although for some breeds a high number of loci showed
significant (P < 0.05) deviations from HWE without correction for multiple testing (Additional file 3 Table S1),
the assignments with STRUCTURE were conducted to
include all loci, because some deviations from HWE are
not expected to affect the performance of the test [55].
The HWE deviations found in Brava de Lide and Preta
breeds are most probably related with a Wahlund effect

these breeds were highly significant [see discussion for
Brava de Lide in [12]]. Within breeds, LD was significant
(P < 0.001) for one pair of loci in the Alentejana breed,

four in the Preta and four in the Brava de Lide, but none
of these corresponded to markers located on the same
chromosome. The assignment tests of STRUCTURE and
GENECLASS were done exclusively for the Algarvia ani-

mals, the related southern breeds (Alentejana, Garvonesa, Mertolenga and Preta) and the Limousin cattle to
determine which Algarvia animals clustered as an independent group, and to detect admixture. The STRUCTURE assignments without prior information on source
breeds showed the highest ΔK at K = 6 (Additional file 4
Figure S3). The estimated genotype membership coefficients (q) obtained for each individual are shown in Figure 2. Algarvia animals clustered with the Alentejana and
Mertolenga breeds at K = 2 and only appeared as an independent cluster at K = 6.
Approximately 54% of all individuals were correctly
allocated to each of the six clusters with q ≥ 0.95 (Table
1). For the Algarvia cluster (K = 6), the average individual
genotype membership proportion (Q) was 0.66 ± 0.40
and this cluster contained 17 individuals (37%) with q ≥
0.95 (AG4, AG5, AG6, AG7, AG8, AG10, AG13, AG14,
AG15, AG16, AG18, AG19, AG22, AG24, AG25, AG27
and AG28). Among the remaining Algarvia animals, one
(~2%) was misclassified with q ≥ 0.95 and 28 (~61%) were
not assigned to this population (q < 0.95). When prior
information on populations was used, ~85% of all individuals were correctly allocated with q ≥ 0.95 (Table 1).
Among the 46 Algarvia animals, 33 (72%) were allocated

Preta

to this cluster with q ≥ 0.95. These included the 17 listed
above plus AG1, AG2, AG2M, AG3M, AG4M, AG9,
AG11, AG20, AG21, AG26, AG29, AG30, AG31, AG40,
AG42 and AG43. Eleven (24%) Algarvia animals were not
assigned to this population (q < 0.80) and admixture was
detected with Garvonesa (AG33, AG34, AG35 and
AG36), Limousin (AG23, AG32, AG37, AG39 and AG41)
and Mertolenga breeds (AG12 and AG17). For the Algarvia population, the average value of Q was 0.85 ± 0.27 and
was the lowest among all breeds.
Results of GENECLASS assignments are summarized
in Additional file 5 Table S2. Animals were correctly
assigned if the genotype probability was higher than the
threshold exclusively in their source population. For
Algarvia animals, ~22 to 50% of the individuals were correctly assigned with accuracies > 0.94 (ratio between the
number of correctly assigned individuals and the sum of
correctly and incorrectly assigned). Depending on the
threshold considered, between 2 and 20% of the Algarvia
animals were excluded (genotype probabilities lower than
the threshold in all populations) and 30 to 76% were
assigned to multiple populations (genotype probabilities
greater than the threshold in at least two populations).

Genetic diversity of Algarvia

The genetic diversity (MNA = 6.0 ± 1.6, Rt = 5.7 ± 1.4, Ho
= 0.63 ± 0.19 and He = 0.69 ± 0.10) of the 33 Algarvia animals identified with STRUCTURE was identical to that
found for the related Alentejana breed, and slightly lower
than the average estimates across all breeds included in
this study (Additional file 3 Table S1, MNA = 6.8 ± 0.6, Rt
= 6.0 ± 1.8, Ho = 0.67 ± 0.05 and He = 0.70 ± 0.03). Ten
population-specific alleles were found in the Algarvia
population but none had a frequency greater than 0.05.
Deviations from HWE were significant (P < 0.05) due to
heterozygote deficit at ten loci (BM203, BM1824,
BM2113, BRRIBO, ETH152, ILSTS035, SPS115, TGLA53,
TGLA122, and TGLA345). Evidence of inbreeding within
the Algarvia group could be inferred from the Fis estimate
(0.083) which was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than
zero. The molecular coancestry of Algarvia animals (fm =
0.322) was slightly higher than the overall value of 0.310.
Pairwise population Fst estimates showed that Algarvia
animals are genetically closer to the Alentejana breed (Fst
= 0.045, P <0.05) than to the other southern breeds
(results not shown).
Y chromosome haplotypes of Algarvia

Among the four Algarvia bulls, two (ALG3M and
ALG4M) had the H11Y2 haplotype which is fixed in the
Alentejana breed but also common in other Portuguese
breeds, whereas the two other animals (ALG1M and
ALG2M) had the H6Y2 haplotype which is fixed in the
Garvonesa breed but also found in other Portuguese
breeds as well as in Charolais and Limousin breeds [15].
mtDNA haplotypes of Algarvia

Complete mtDNA control region sequences (909 bp)
were obtained for the 33 Algarvia animals (four bulls and
29 females) assigned to this group with STRUCTURE

(sequence quality of AG19 was low and thus was discarded). Sequence alignment is shown in Additional file 6
Figure S4 with polymorphic positions represented. A
total of 12 distinct haplotypes was identified [GenBank:
G086285-G086317] based on 21 variable sites, of which
11 were phylogenetically informative, nine were singletons, and one was an indel. The European T3 haplogroup
(T at nt16255) was the most frequent (29 animals) but the
African-derived T1a type (T at nt16050, C at nt16113 and
C at nt16255) was also detected in three Algarvia individuals (AG16, AG40 and AG43). Genetic diversity estimates in the Algarvia population were H = 0.81 ± 0.05, π
= 0.003 ± 0.002 and MNPD = 3.03 ± 1.62. Pairwise Fst values showed that Algarvia is significantly differentiated
from all breeds except from Garvonesa (Fst = 0.028, P >
0.05).
Haplotype relationships represented in the MJ-network
(Figure 3) showed that the most common haplotype in
the Algarvia population (11 animals, including males
AG3M and AG4M) was shared with one Alentejana individual, whereas the second most frequent haplotype (10
animals) was shared with three Garvonesa, two Mertolenga and one Preta individuals. Two Algarvia animals
(AG40 and AG43) and one Garvonesa shared a T1a haplotype. Interestingly, a T1a haplotype found in one Algarvia (AG16) and three Alentejana animals was
substantially different from other haplotypes of this haplogroup. This haplotype has a C and an A at positions
nt16122 and nt16196, respectively (nt330 and nt404 in
Additional file 6 Figure S4), which are characteristic of
the African-derived AA mtDNA lineage described in
Latin American Creole cattle and also found in Iberia
[56]. Although this haplotype lacks the C and T at positions nt16053 and nt16139, respectively (nt261 and nt347
in Additional file 6 Figure S4), that also define AA, it can
represent more ancestral Iberian mtDNA lineages [for a
discussion see [50]].

Conservation analysis

Contributions of each breed to the overall genetic diversity are shown in Table 2. Following the Weitzman
approach, and based on population pairwise DA values,
the between-breed influence on diversity (CB) varied
from 3.90 (Arouquesa) to 10.23 (Brava de Lide). The
within-breed diversity (CW) values varied from -0.62
(Brava de Lide) to 0.43 (Mertolenga). The Fst value estimated across all breeds and used to calculate the aggregate genetic diversity (D1) was 0.089. Among
autochthonous breeds, the lowest value for D1 was found
in the Mirandesa breed (0.23) and the highest for the
Preta breed (0.92). The influence of the Algarvia breed on
the overall genetic diversity was intermediate across all
estimates except for the allelic diversity-based (ci) calculation. Algarvia ranked within the six breeds that contributed most to CB (6.18), and showed a lower contribution
to both CW (-0.06) and D1 (0.50). When the allelic diversity was considered, Algarvia and seven other autochthonous breeds made no contribution to the overall genetic
diversity.

Discussion
Decisions to initiate costly conservation programmes
need to take into account assessment of extant variability
and diversity loss, as well as cultural and economic
aspects [57-59]. Algarvia cattle were adapted to the climatic and geographical conditions of Algarve, a region
that is highly susceptible to suffer from climate change
[60]. In addition to its cultural and historical relevance,
reconstituting this breed could also contribute to reinforce sustainable agriculture, a non negligible component
of the economic activity of the region. The use of molecular data to assess the genetic structure of domestic species in conservation programmes has been described
[59,61-67]. Analysis of morphological and molecular
information provides a more solid basis to define the
characteristics of a breed than the use of morphological

Algarvia is represented by the 33 animals identified with STRUCTURE
CB: Weitzman estimate of between-breed genetic diversity; CW: within-breed genetic diversity; D1: aggregate genetic diversity, 0.089*CB +
0.911*CW; ci: contribution of each breed to a pool of maximal genetic diversity [49]

stituting this breed, we used molecular markers to investigate to which extent these animals could be
distinguished from other Portuguese cattle. In agreement
with their morphological classification [20,23,27,68],
genetic distances and factorial correspondence analyses
showed a close relationship between Algarvia and other
breeds of the Aquitanian (Red Convex) group. Algarvia
and Garvonesa breeds are considered to be descendants
of the Alentejana breed [23], and our study shows that
Algarvia is closely related to these breeds. This genetic
proximity probably also reflects recent admixture,
because most of the Algarvia animals were found in
herds predominantly composed of Alentejana animals.
Genetic erosion due to crossbreeding is expected to have
occurred since the breed began to decline about 35 years
ago.
We used assignment tests to determine whether a cluster of putative Algarvia animals could be distinguished
from the related southern breeds and to identify potential
candidates to reconstitute the breed. STRUCTURE
results confirmed that the most probable partition of the
data agreed with the number of populations tested.
Although the Algarvia group was the last to emerge as an
independent cluster, it was possible to identify 17 cows
that belonged to this group with q values > 0.95 without
using prior information on populations. With prior information on sample origin, 33 animals (30 cows and three
bulls) were classified as Algarvia. The partially Bayesian

method of GENECLASS resulted in relatively low percentages of animals classified in each breed but, because
of the high accuracy, it was useful to confirm reference
animals in each population. Even though GENECLASS
methods are conservative [55], the results were consistent
with those of STRUCTURE with 23 animals assigned to
Algarvia of which only two (AG34 and AG1M) were not
among those selected by STRUCTURE.
Based on their genotypes, three bulls (AG2M, AG3M
and AG4M) identified as Algarvia can be used to reconstitute the breed. The remaining bull (AG1M) was possibly admixed with Alentejana, according to the
STRUCTURE analysis, although with GENECLASS it
was assigned to the source population but with a low
probability. Overall, a certain amount of convergence of
results from independent approaches is noted, since 19 of
these animals (16 cows and three bulls) were also identified as belonging to the core group to reconstitute the
Algarvia breed based on numerical taxonomy analyses of
morphological characters [27]. Admixture was detected
in several Algarvia females, three of which (AG33, AG35
and AG41) did not represent descendants of this breed
because they were misclassified. Based on morphology,
these animals clustered within a group also containing
Alentejana, Garvonesa and Mertolenga animals [27]. The
heterogeneous composition of the putative Algarvia population is reflected by the lower average genotype membership coefficients when compared to those of breeds

Ginja et al. Genetics Selection Evolution 2010, 42:18
http://www.gsejournal.org/content/42/1/18

having herdbook registries. This result was not surprising
given the expected dilution of Algarvia through crossbreeding.
The Y-haplotypes of the putative Algarvia bulls provided additional evidence of the genetic proximity with
Alentejana and Garvonesa breeds, but did not exclude
possible admixture with imported breeds such as Limousin or Charolais. mtDNA analysis corroborated the close
genetic relationship between the core group of 33 Algarvia animals and the Garvonesa breed through their sharing of haplotypes. Common Iberian matrilines (European
T3 and African T1a) were found in the Algarvia population, as well as a distinct haplotype (AG16) possibly
related to the more ancestral African-derived AA haplogroup found in Creole cattle [50]. The use of genotypic
data, together with morphological analysis, facilitated the
definition of a group of animals that could be used to
reconstitute the Algarvia breed. How conservative the
inclusion criteria should be relative to the acceptable
degree of admixture will depend on breeding strategies
yet to be defined.
The genetic diversity of the core set of 33 Algarvia animals was slightly lower than that found across Portuguese
breeds. A significant heterozygote deficit was detected,
possibly due to inbreeding, which is consistent with the
strong genetic erosion. These results were not unexpected considering the extremely reduced number of
extant Algarvia descendants. Another possible explanation for HWE deviations could be the sampling of Algarvia animals from independent herds, which could
generate population subdivision and an increased frequency of homozygotes (e.g. Wahlund effect).
Gene diversity-based estimates indicate that the Algarvia population makes an intermediate contribution to the
overall genetic diversity of Portuguese cattle. In contrast,
the allelic diversity-based estimates suggest that the variation found in Algarvia is represented in the genetic pool
of four other autochthonous breeds. The decision concerning which of these measures should be used in management programs to evaluate breed contributions to
overall genetic diversity is not consensual [61]. In the case
of Portuguese autochthonous breeds that are considered
endangered [4], particularly for the Algarvia breed,
immediate conservation measures should aim at maximizing gene diversity rather than allelic diversity. This
approach would maintain allelic diversity and guarantee a
more effective response to selection while controlling
inbreeding [61,64].

previous morphological findings to identify 33 animals
that can be considered remnants from the Algarvia
breed. For cultural and economic reasons, reconstituting
the Algarvia breed is relevant to maintain the distinct
regional identity of the Algarve. Molecular analyses have
characterized the genetic diversity of the core set of animals which, together with information from conservation
analyses, can be used to establish a management program
to reconstitute the Algarvia breed.

Conclusion
Although nearly three decades have elapsed since the
Algarvia breed was declared effectively extinct, we were
able to identify a small group of cows and bulls with phenotypic characteristics of this breed. Analyses of autosomal, maternal and paternal markers have helped refine
