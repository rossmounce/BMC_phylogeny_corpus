Abstract
Background: The eukaryotic green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, produces H2 under anaerobic
conditions, in a reaction catalysed by a [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase HydA1. For further biochemical and
biophysical studies a suitable expression system of this enzyme should be found to overcome its
weak expression in the host organism. Two heterologous expression systems used up to now have
several advantages. However they are not free from some drawbacks. In this work we use
bacterium Shewanella oneidensis as a new and efficient system for expression and maturation of
HydA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
Results: Based on codon usage bias and hydrogenase maturation ability, the bacterium S.
oneidensis, which possesses putative [Fe-Fe] and [Ni-Fe] hydrogenase operons, was selected as the
best potential host for C. reinhardtii [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase expression. Hydrogen formation by S.
oneidensis strain AS52 (ΔhydAΔhyaB) transformed with a plasmid bearing CrHydA1 and grown in the
presence of six different substrates for anaerobic respiration was determined. A significant increase
in hydrogen evolution was observed for cells grown in the presence of trimethylamine oxide,
dimethylsulfoxide and disodium thiosulfate, showing that the system of S. oneidensis is efficient for
heterologous expression of algal [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase.
Conclusion: In the present work a new efficient system for heterologous expression and
maturation of C. reinhardtii hydrogenase has been developed. HydA1 of C. reinhardtii was purified
and shown to contain 6 Fe atoms/molecule of protein, as expected. Using DMSO, TMAO or
thiosulfate as substrates for anaerobic respiration during the cell growth, 0.4 – 0.5 mg l-1(OD600 =
1) of catalytically active HydA1 was obtained with hydrogen evolution rate of ~700 μmol H2 mg-1
min-1.

Background
Biohydrogen has great potential as a non-polluting, nonfossil fuel which can be produced at the point of end use
without the release of greenhouse gases. The most efficient H2-generating catalysts are the hydrogenases which
are present in several microorganisms including photosynthetic microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that reversibly catalyse the
reaction: H2↔2H++ 2e-. There are three classes of hydrogenases: [Fe-Fe], [Ni-Fe] and [Fe-S]-cluster-free hydrogenases [1,2]. The [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases mainly catalyse the
reduction of protons to yield dihydrogen with high efficiency. They are irreversibly inactivated by oxygen. C. reinhardtii is a eukaryotic green alga which contains two
monomeric [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases: HydA1 and HydA2 [3].
Both proteins are encoded by nuclear genes. The hydA2
gene encodes a protein that is 74% similar and 68% identical to HydA1. HydA1 mediates a light-driven hydrogen
evolution following anaerobic adaptation of the algae [4].
The structure of the HydA1 H-cluster is composed of a
[4Fe-4S]-centre bridged through a cysteine amino acid to
an unusual 2Fe-centre. Unlike many other [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases, HydA1 does not have any 2 [4Fe-4S] electron
transfer domains and is directly reduced by a [2Fe-2S]
ferredoxin [5]. The specific function of HydA2 is not
known. Two maturation proteins, HydEF and HydG, are
required for the assembly of active HydA1 [6]. Homologous expression of HydA1 leads to a low yield of active
enzyme [4]. Heterologous expression of HydA1 has been
previously performed in Clostridium acetobutylicum using
endogenous maturation enzymes [7] and in Escherichia
coli using a heterologously expressed maturation system
[6,8]. The former experiments using C. acetobutylicum
resulted in the purification of 0.1 mg of HydA1 per liter of
culture with hydrogen evolution rates of 760 μmol H2
min-1 mg-1 [7]. The opposite situation appeared with the
E. coli expression system which resulted in a higher
amount of enzyme (0.8 – 1 mg of HydA1 per liter of culture) but with hydrogen evolution rates of 150 μmol H2
min-1 mg-1 [8].
It is known that many organisms show particular preferences for one of the several codons encoding a given
amino acid. A rare codon is defined as used by an organism at a frequency lower than 0.5%. Rare codons are capable of causing qualitative and quantitative expression
difficulties [9,10]. In order to overcome these difficulties,
we decided to search for organisms having not only a Hyd
maturation system, but also low rare codon usage rates for
hydA1. We first analysed the rare codon usage rate of
hydA1 in different organisms carrying demonstrated or
putative homologues of HydA1, HydEF and HydG. The
closest match in codon usage between hydA1 and a possible host organism for expression of the protein was
obtained with the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. S. onei-

densis is a facultative anaerobe that can be easily and rapidly grown, and which possesses a large and diverse set of
metalloproteins. It exhibits extensive respiratory versatility and can use organic, inorganic or metallic substrates
during anaerobic respiration. The whole S. oneidensis
genome has been sequenced [11]. This has shown that S.
oneidensis possesses [Ni-Fe] and [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases,
encoded by hydA ([Fe-Fe]) and hyaB ([Ni-Fe]). Global
transcriptome analysis of S. oneidensis exposed to different
terminal electron acceptors by Beliaev et al. [12] revealed
that the [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase gene (hydA) is expressed
under thiosulfate-respiring conditions and no induction
was observed under Fe(III), nitrate, fumarate, TMAO and
DMSO-respiring conditions. The physiological significance of hydA gene induction in the presence of thiosulfate is not known.
In the present study, hydrogen formation by C. reinhardtii
HydA1 expressed in S. oneidensis strain AS52 (ΔhydAΔhyaB) and grown in anaerobic conditions with six different substrates was measured, showing that S. oneidensis
maturation enzymes are able to mature heterologously
expressed [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase. In contrast to the transcriptome analysis by Beliaev et al. [12], we observed a significant increase of hydrogen formation due to the
presence of the S. oneidensis [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase (HydA)
with three substrates (trimethylamine oxide (TMAO),
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and disodium thiosulfate),
compared to anaerobic conditions in the presence of
other added respiratory substrates. This may be due to
post-transcriptional regulation of S. oneidensis [Fe-Fe]
hydrogenase synthesis.
After purification, 400 – 500 μg of catalytically active
HydA1 were obtained from 1-liter culture (OD600 = 1)
with specific activities of approximately 700 μmol H2 min1 mg-1 under TMAO, thiosulfate or DMSO-respiring conditions. The enzyme contained six atoms of iron per molecule of protein, thus we can conclude that maturation was
homogeneous and complete.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
The S. oneidensis strains used in this study are listed in
Table 1. S. oneidensis MR-1 strain was obtained from Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). Strains AS50, AS51 and AS52
were obtained from Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA,
USA). All strains were grown aerobically at 28°C in M72
medium (casein digest peptone 15 g/L, papaic digest of
soybean meal 5 g/L, sodium chloride 5 g/L, pH 7.8). For
hydrogen formation studies with different substrates for
anaerobic respiration, 100-ml cultures of S. oneidensis
were grown anaerobically overnight in M72 medium containing 20 mM lactate and 20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, together
with one of the following substrates: ferric citrate (10

(20 mM), sodium nitrate (10 mM), or fumarate (20 mM).
Cells were collected anaerobically by centrifugation (15
min, 9800 × g, 4°C).
For HydA1 expression, S. oneidensis AS52A1N strain was
grown overnight at 28°C in gas-tight bottles containing 1
liter of anaerobic M72 medium supplemented with 20
mM lactate, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.9 and one of the following substrates: 20 mM disodium thiosulfate, 10 mM
TMAO or 10 mM DMSO. Kanamycin (50 μg/mL) was
added in both preculture and culture media.
Hydrogen formation assay
Hydrogen formation assay on S. oneidensis cells
After centrifugation (see above) the cells were resuspended in 1 ml breaking buffer (see below) and samples
were diluted in a solution containing 50 mM Tris/HCl pH
6.7, 20 mM Na-dithionite and 5 mM methylviologen as
the electron donor.
Hydrogen formation assay on purified HydA1
After purification (see below) hydrogenase samples were
diluted in a solution containing 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 6.7,
20 mM Na-dithionite and 5 mM methylviologen as the
electron donor.

In both cases hydrogen evolution was measured by
amperometry using a modified Clark-type electrode
(Hansatech, UK). The amplitude of the electrical signal
from the electrode was standardized using an aliquot of
H2-saturated solution as a reference.
Plasmids and cloning procedures
The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. All
the constructions were performed in E. coli (strain XL1Blue [13]) and then used to electrotransform S. oneidensis.

Plasmid pBBR1-MCS2 [14] was used for C. reinhardtii
hydA1 cloning under control of lac promoter. Expression
under this promoter is repressor-independent (lacI-) and
is regulated only by glucose repression-derepression.
To construct pBBR1-MCS2 N-terminal Strep tag II, two
complementary DNA primers, TAGF 5'-CGGAGGACGTT
TATGGCTAGCTGGTCCCACCCGCAGTTCGAAAA GATCGAAGGGCGCA-3'and TAGR 5'-AGCTTGCGCCCTTCGATCTTTTCGAACTGCG GGTGGGACCAGCTAGCCATA
AACGTCCTCCGGTAC-3' were hybridizated, phosphorylated and cloned in KpnI-HindIII sites of pBBR1-MCS2
[14]. TAGF contains a ribosome binding site (RBS), a start
codon, Strep-tag II and factor Xa DNA sequences. To construct pBBR1-MCS2 C-terminal Strep tag II, two complementary DNA primers, TAGFC 5'-TCGACTGGAGCCATCC
GCAATTTGAAAAATAAG-3' and TAGRC 5'-GATCCTTATTTTTCAAATTGCGGATGGCTCCAG-3' were hybridized, phosphorylated and cloned in SalI-BamHI sites of
pBBR1-MCS2 [14]. TAGFC contains a Strep-tag II and a
stop codon sequences.
To construct pBBR-hydA1N, the hydA1 sequence was
amplified by PCR from the plasmid pA139 (from Kazuza
DNA Research Institute, Japan [15]), which carries the
hydA1 gene from C. reinhardtii. The first 165 5'nucleotides
were deleted. The PCR product was cloned in
PCR4BLUNT-TOPO (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France)
and subcloned in HindIII-EcoRI sites of pBBR1-MCS2 Nterminal Strep-tag II. To construct pBBR-hydA1C, the
hydA1 sequence was amplified by PCR from the plasmid
pA139, which carries hydA1 from C. reinhardtii. The first
165 5'nucleotides and the stop codon were deleted. The
PCR product was cloned in PCR4BLUNT-TOPO and subcloned in KpnI-SalI sites of pBBR1-MCS2 C-terminal Streptag II.

Electrotransformation of S. oneidensis was performed as
previously described [16], resulting in the strain AS52A1N
when AS52 was transformed with pBBR-hydA1N and in
the strain AS52A1C when transformed with pBBRhydA1C.
Hydrogenase purification
All the purification steps were carried out under a purified
nitrogen atmosphere, in a glovebox (Jacomex, France)
maintained at < 1 ppm O2. After 17 h of growth, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation (9800 × g, 15 min,
4°C). The pellets were resuspended in breaking buffer
(150 mM Tris/HCl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mM Na-dithionite, 0.3 nM avidin, 1 mM PMSF, 10
μg/ml DNase, 10 μg/ml RNase). Cells were broken using
a French pressure cell (15.2 kPa) and centrifuged (5200 ×
g, 30 min). The supernatant was transferred to a Q-Sepharose FF 2 ml column (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) equilibrated in 25 mM Tris/HCl, 2 mM Nadithionite at pH 8.5. Strep-tagII-HydA1 was eluted with a
NaCl gradient (50–500 mM), and elution of the active
fraction occurred at 250 mM NaCl. The second purification step was affinity chromatography on a 1 ml Gravity
flow Strep-tactin Sepharose column as described by the
manufacturer (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). Streptag II HydA1 was detected after gel electrophoresis and
Western blotting using Strep-tag AP Detection Kit (IBA).
Amido-black and Bradford assays were used to measure
hydrogenase concentration. The assays were performed as
described in references [17] and [18], respectively.

Iron quantitation assay
Iron concentration measurements were performed using a
previously described atomic absorption method [19], and
the colorimetric method of Doeg and Ziegler [20].
Software
A short Perl/Tk script was written to obtain data on rare
codons: upon providing the NCBI gene number and the
Kazusa Codon Usage Database organism name, the script
forwards the queries to the relevant databases, compiles
the rare codons usage information and displays the gene
with rare codons colored differently and a summary of the
rare codons usage. The script is available as open-source
software at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/codons.

Results
Rare codons analysis
HydA1 rare codons were searched for in various organisms using a software that compares genes sequences from
NCBI with the codon usage data from different genomes
of Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Japan). Rare and very
rare codons were defined as used by an organism at a frequency lower than 0.5% and 0.2% respectively (Table 2).

The gene sequence of C. reinhardtii hydA1 (source: NCBI)
was compared with codon usage data from organisms
which possess putative homologues of C. reinhardtii
HydA1, HydEF and HydG and from E. coli, which was previously used to synthesize HydA1 but has no putative
homologues of C. reinhardtii hydA1, hydEF and hydG.

botulinum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, C. tetani, C. thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (thermophilic);
and 3) protozoan:Trichomonas vaginalis (Table 2). It must
be noted that hydA1 presents less rare codons in gram negative than in gram positive bacteria. The best match was
obtained with S. oneidensis (Table 2).
Heterologous expression of CrHydA1
The HydA1 producing strains of S. oneidensis AS52A1N
and AS52A1C were constructed by electrotransforming
the host strain S. oneidensis AS52 (ΔhydAΔhyaB) [21] with
pBBR-hydA1N and pBBR-hydA1C respectively (Table 1).
pBBR-hydA1N is a pBBR1-MCS2 derivative carrying N-terminal Strep tag II hydA1 from C. reinhardtii and pBBRhydA1C is a pBBR1-MCS2 derivate carrying a C-terminal
Strep tag II hydA1 gene from C. reinhardtii. The N-terminal
56 amino acids of HydA1, which act as transit peptide
[22] were truncated. The pBBR1-MCS2 vector is a broad
host range vector which has been tested and found to replicate in 15 Gram negative bacteria [14]. After cell breakage using a French pressure cell and subsequent
centrifugation, N-terminal Strep-tag II-HydA1 was
detected in the cell-free extract, while C-terminal Strep-tag
II-HydA1 was mostly found in the cell-debris pellet (Fig
1). It should be noted that no hydrogenase catalytic activity was detected in the pellet.

In C. acetobutylicum it was reported that after sonication,
the N-terminal Strep-tag II-HydA1 was mostly found in
the postsonication pellet, while the C-terminal Strep-tagIIHydA1 was exclusively detected in the supernatant [7].
Thus, the solubility of the tagged protein is most likely
influenced by the tag position and by the host strain chosen for the expression. The occurrence of insoluble C-terminal Strep-tagII-HydA1 protein could be due to nonspecific interactions between HydA1 and the host bacterium proteins.
Hydrogen evolution from S. oneidensis cells anaerobically
grown in the presence of various respiratory substrates
S. oneidensis uses oxygen as final electron acceptor during
aerobic respiration and various organic, inorganic or
metallic substrates during anaerobic respiration. Optimal
conditions for synthesis of active hydrogenases in S. oneidensis were investigated.

The S. oneidensis strain AS52A1N (Table 1) was grown
anaerobically in the presence of nitrate, thiosulfate, fumarate, TMAO, Fe(III) or DMSO as substrates for anaerobic
respiration. No hydrogenase activity was detected in
extracts of cells grown aerobically (data not shown).

externally added substrates, H2 evolution activity of 0.02
± 0.001 μmole H2 min-1 ml-1 for OD600 = 1 was measured
for strain AS52A1N (Table 3). Hydrogen formation was
approximately the same using fumarate, nitrate or ferric
citrate for the strains AS52A1N, AS50 (ΔhydA) and AS51
(ΔhyaB). We observed a significant increase of hydrogen
evolution for the strains AS52A1N and AS51 grown in
presence of TMAO, thiosulfate and DMSO (Table 3). No
hydrogen was detected after exposing the cells to air for 15
minutes (data not shown). Insignificantly small amounts
of hydrogen were detected from the ΔhydA strain (AS50)
under DMSO-, TMAO- or thiosulfate-respiring conditions
(Table 3), showing that under these conditions, hydrogen
evolution is only due to the presence of the [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases (CrHydA1 or SoHydA). No hydrogen was
detected in experiments using the ΔhydAΔhyaB strain
(AS52) (data not shown). It should also be noted that
strain AS52A1N produces about 2 times more hydrogen
compared to the AS51 (ΔhyaB) strain of S. oneidensis using
DMSO, TMAO or thiosulfate as substrates for anaerobic
respiration (Table 3).

Purification and characterization of CrHydA1
S. oneidensis strain AS52A1N was used for the production
of Strep-tagged HydA1. Three substrates for anaerobic respiration were chosen for cell growth: TMAO, DMSO and
thiosulfate. The purification procedure, which involves
anion exchange and affinity chromatographies, was performed as previously described by Girbal et al. [7], except
that during the stepwise elution from Q-Sepharose, the
algal hydrogenase eluted at 0.25 M NaCl. As shown in Fig.
2 and Table 4, Strep-tagged CrHydA1 was synthesized as
an active enzyme using DMSO, TMAO or thiosulfate for
cell growth. After purification on a Strep-Tactin column,
0.4 – 0.5 mg of pure algal hydrogenase was isolated from
1 liter of culture (OD600 = 1) (Table 4, Fig 2). Hydrogen
evolution rates of about 700 μmol H2 min-1 mg-1 protein,
were measured using a hydrogen electrode in the presence
of reduced methylviologen as the electron donor (Table
4). Iron quantitation of HydA1 anaerobically expressed in
S. oneidensis AS52 (ΔhydAΔhyaB) was done, showing in all
cases the presence of 6 Fe atoms/molecule of protein
(Table 4). Interestingly, the hydrogen formation rate of
purified HydA1 expressed in the wild type strain (MR1) of
S. oneidensis under DMSO-respiring conditions was about
5 times lower (135 ± 12 μmol H2 min-1 mg-1) and only 0.6
± 0.03 atoms of iron were found per molecule of hydrogenase. This result may indicate the preferential maturation
of the host [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase by So hydEFG genes. As a
consequence the proper expression of CrHydA1 in S. oneidensis needs to be performed in the absence of the endogenous [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase.

Discussion
Shewanella oneidensis is a metabolically versatile bacterium
that can use a diversity of organic compounds and metals
to obtain the energy needed for its growth and survival
[23,24]. It is a facultative aerobic Gram-negative bacterium, related to E. coli. The tools and techniques that were
developed over the past 30 years for E. coli are compatible
with S. oneidensis. In addition, the ability of Shewanella to
tolerate oxygen allows easy genetic manipulation in contrast to strict anaerobic organisms.
The results of codon usage analysis of hydA1 are consistent
with an eubacterial origin of this enzyme [25]. Three of
the four best codon usage matches between hydA1 and a
possible host were obtained with eubacteria which are
closely related in phylogenetic trees:D. desulfuricans, E. coli
and S. oneidensis.
It is known that the regulation of bacterial hydrogenase
gene expression is exerted mainly at the transcriptional
level [26] and responds to four major types of signals: H2,
O2, nickel ions, and the electron donors together with
available acceptors. In our work, the synthesis of S. oneidensis [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase or exogenously expressed
HydA1 of C. reinhardtii was observed using DMSO, TMAO
and thiosulfate as respiratory substrates during anaerobic
cultivation. This induction is intriguing since, under such
growth conditions, one could anticipate that cells do not
need an additional respiratory pathway, such as proton
reduction by hydrogenase, in order to drain off excess of
electrons. No hydrogen production was observed during

Using C. acetobutylicum, Girbal et al. [7] isolated about 0.1
mg of algal hydrogenase per liter of culture with hydrogen
evolution rates of 760 μmol H2 min-1 mg-1. Similar
amounts of the protein were obtained for HydA1 isolated
from cultures of C. reinhardtii and Scenedemus obliquus
[4,29]. Heterologous expression of HydA1 in E. coli
resulted in a higher amount of enzyme (0.8 – 1 mg of
algal hydrogenase per liter of culture), but required a heterologously expressed maturation system and yielded a
low rate of hydrogen evolution [8]. In S. oneidensis 0.4 –
0.5 mg of active HydA1 per liter of culture (OD600 = 1) was
obtained under TMAO, thiosulfate or DMSO-respiring
conditions. Heterologous expression in S. oneidensis of
another metalloprotein, cytochrome c3 from D. vulgaris
Miyazaki F, yielded 1 mg of protein per liter of culture,
compared with 0.3 mg per liter obtained by homologous
expression [30]. These results confirm that S. oneidensis is
a user-friendly system for heterologous expression of metalloproteins, including hydrogenase.

Conclusion
aerobic respiration. This fits with the well known observation that enzyme complexes that are sensitive to the presence of oxygen are usually not expressed in an aerobic
environment.
During our studies of hydrogen evolution from S. oneidensis strains grown anaerobically in the presence of various
respiratory substrates, we observed the absence of hydrogenase activity with Fe(III), nitrate and fumarate. In contrast, under TMAO-, thiosulfate- or DMSO-respiring
conditions a significant increase of hydrogen formation
was detected due to the presence of the [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases (CrHydA1 or SoHydA). One may assume that putative [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase operon in S. oneidensis encodes
maturation enzymes which are expressed and active under
TMAO, DMSO and thiosulfate growth conditions, since
mature CrHydA1 or SoHydA is produces under these conditions and not under nitrate, fumarate and Fe(III) conditions. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the
maturation enzymes of S. oneidensis (HydE, HydF and
HydG) are capable of activating CrHydA1 in a cell-free
system from E. coli [27]. The disagreement with the transcriptome studies conducted by Beliaev et al. [12] concerning SoHydA could be due to post-transcriptional
regulation of S. oneidensis [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase synthesis.
It was previously shown that S. oneidensis can be electrotransformed directly by the pUC-type universal vectors for

The present work shows that S. oneidensis heterologous
production system appears more efficient than that of C.
acetobutylicum, for matured [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase expression. The specific activities of purified StrepII-tagged C.
reinhardtii HydA1 expressed in S. oneidensis are higher
than those of CrHydA1 expressed in E. coli (~700 μmol H2
min-1 mg-1 vs. 150 μmol H2 min-1 mg-1 respectively). The
purified HydA1 is fully matured and homogeneous in that
it bears the predicted full complement of iron (six atoms
of iron per molecule of protein). HydA1 isolated from cultures of C. reinhardtii contained 4 Fe atoms/molecule [4],
while no result on this subject was published concerning
HydA1 expressed in C. acetobutylicum [7] or in E. coli [6,8].
Heterologous expression of algal [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase in
S. oneidensis, a bacterium which is easily manipulated
genetically, offers great potential to facilitate enzymatic
studies of the [Fe-Fe] hydrogenases as well as investigations of their maturation processes.
