Removing bias against membrane proteins in
interaction networks
Glauber C Brito* and David W Andrews

Abstract
Background: Cellular interaction networks can be used to analyze the effects on cell signaling and other
functional consequences of perturbations to cellular physiology. Thus, several methods have been used to
reconstitute interaction networks from multiple published datasets. However, the structure and performance of
these networks depends on both the quality and the unbiased nature of the original data. Due to the inherent
bias against membrane proteins in protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, interaction networks can be compromised
particularly if they are to be used in conjunction with drug screening efforts, since most drug-targets are
membrane proteins.
Results: To overcome the experimental bias against PPIs involving membrane-associated proteins we used a
probabilistic approach based on a hypergeometric distribution followed by logistic regression to simultaneously
optimize the weights of different sources of interaction data. The resulting less biased genome-scale network
constructed for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the starvation pathway is a distinct
subnetwork of autophagy and retrieved a more integrated network of unfolded protein response genes. We also
observed that the centrality-lethality rule depends on the content of membrane proteins in networks.
Conclusions: We show here that the bias against membrane proteins can and should be corrected in order to
have a better representation of the interactions and topological properties of protein interaction networks.

Background
Membrane proteins are critical to diverse physiological
functions and are directly implicated in many diseases.
They represent one-third of the genome and 60% of the
known drug targets [1]. Thus, it is important to be able to
examine the cellular context in which membrane proteins
interact with each other and with other cellular components, such as the components of signaling pathways.
Functional gene networks including high quality membrane interactions would be particularly useful to probe
crosstalk between signaling pathways and thereby improve
our understanding of how proteins function synergistically
and antagonistically to control cellular phenotypes. By
providing the context for cellular processes needed to
interpret the results, network modeling is also important
to understand how genes modulate the activity of drugs
and reagents [2] and in high throughput screening projects
using shRNAs, siRNAs, deletion libraries, etc. [3-5].

Networks have been used most successfully to provide
insights into the functions of the proteins encoded by the
yeast genome [6-10], since the most complete and best
annotated publicly available gene interactions are available
for this widely used model organism (BIOGRID database,
version 2.0.57).
In probabilistic network models, statistical associations
established for pairs of genes are used to generate a network in which the genes likely to participate in the same
cellular pathway or process are connected by probabilistic
functions. Each connection in the network is scored with
the likelihood of the linked genes belonging to the same
pathway. This results in a probabilistic view of interacting
genes in which, instead of being defined as ‘interacting’ or
‘non-interacting’, each potentially interacting pair is placed
in a graded spectrum of confidence levels.
Predictions performed using an interaction network are
typically based on the assumption that the experimental
data is non-biased, which is not always the case [8].
Because the assumption is that interactions that are present multiple times are more reliable (given higher weight)

a bias is introduced due to over-representation by popular
methods for PPI identification, such as the yeast twohybrid system (Y2H) [11,12] and affinity capture-mass
spectrometry (affinity capture-MS) [13,14]. The Y2H
method requires that the two proteins localize to the
nucleus; however, integral membrane proteins expressed
in an aqueous nuclear environment may aggregate or misfold [11,12,15], resulting in depletion of these proteins
from the final interaction dataset. Also, the datasets
derived from affinity capture-MS can be biased against
integral membrane proteins, because biochemical purifications require detergents to isolate proteins away from the
lipid bilayer [16]. In addition, it is impossible to optimize
the solubilization conditions for all membrane proteins
and complexes due to the large-scale nature of these projects [17,18]. Furthermore, membrane proteins tend to be
expressed at a lower level compared to soluble proteins
[19], and affinity capture-MS preferentially detects abundant proteins [8,20]. The potential under-representation of
membrane proteins can have important effects on the
computational prediction of the localization and function
of gene products due to underestimation of reliability.
Considering that genomic studies suggest that membrane
proteins make up ~25% to ~33% of the predicted proteins
in an organism [6], network bias may help to explain why
many disagreements occur when predicting the localization of proteins belonging to the secretory pathway [21].
Recently, some approaches have measured interactions
between proteins in their natural cellular context, diminishing the bias against membrane proteins. Tarassov
et al. [16] have performed a systematic binary screen for
PPIs in yeast using protein-fragment complementation
assays (hereafter PF-PCA) based on murine dihydrofolate
reductase. This method provides an alternative approach
to detect PPIs but the PPIs observed show enrichment in
proteins from organelle membranes when compared to
the whole genome [16] suggesting a bias in favor of
membrane proteins. Similarly, Miller et al. [22] used a
modified split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid technique
(hereafter SU-2HY) specifically designed to increase the
representation of integral membrane proteins, and
observed 1,985 putative interactions involving 536 membrane-associated proteins. This screen was specifically
directed at membrane protein interactions and has identified large numbers of interactors for some membrane
proteins that were not seen using other techniques.
Genetic interactions tend to be less biased against
membrane proteins although the interpretation of genetic
interactions in a physical cellular context is a major biological challenge. Nevertheless for any given gene significant correlation between the genetic and physical
interaction degree has been observed [4]. Furthermore,
significant overlap between genetic interactions and PPI
pairs (10 to 20%) was also reported by these authors, thus

justifying the utility of genetic interactions for inferring
functional associations between genes. One additional
advantage of including genetic interactions in a probabilistic network is that PPIs connect relatively fewer bioprocesses than genetic interactions. Thus, physical
interactions are highly informative of local pathway
architecture but provide a less complete picture of functional modules or interconnections between them [4].
Therefore, to optimally contextualize genes, functional
networks should integrate many sources of evidence of
interaction among proteins and genes. In this way, the
transfer of function annotation occurs from one gene to
another via biological relationships that include information such as correlated gene expression [23], correlated
phylogenetic profiles [24], PPIs [25], and phenotyping
experiments [26].
To use gene network neighbors to predict new annotations for genes, such as function and localization, requires
a high-confidence network. In this study a classifier was
trained using Gene Ontology as a gold-standard set of
annotations and validated with an independent dataset of
localization annotations. We provide proof-of-principle
evidence that genes linked in a probabilistic network constructed with increased coverage of membrane proteins
can give rise to important insights in membrane biology.
This approach provides a rational and quantitative foundation to analyze and visualize relationships involving membrane proteins, and results in a different view of the yeast
membrane interactome, particularly as it applies to the
centrality-lethality rule.

Results
The bias against membrane proteins

To evaluate the coverage of interactions involving membrane proteins we performed an analysis with all 160,613
yeast genetic and physical interactions present in the
BIOGRID database (version 2.0.57). We divided the
interactions according to the method used to generate
them, and counted the number of interactions involving
at least one membrane protein (GO:0016020 and its children GO Terms). We observed a wide variation in both
genetic and physical membrane protein interactions
(63%-11%) depending on the method used to generate
the data (Figure 1A). As expected, the affinity captureMS method showed the highest bias against interactions
involving at least one membrane protein. In addition, a
GO enrichment analysis with 1000 interactions randomly
selected from this same dataset showed an under-representation of the GO categories “membrane”, “mitochondrial membrane”, and “plasma membrane”, with p-values,
after Bonferroni’s correction, of 10 -15 , 10 -3 , and 10 -2 ,
respectively. The bias observed with the affinity captureMS method has a significant impact on the total coverage
of membrane proteins, since this method contributes

more than 25% (~40,000 interactions) of the total interactions in the BIOGRID database (Figure 1B), although it
has only ~10% of its interactions involving a membrane
protein (Figure 1A). The method with the highest density
of membrane PPIs was the protein complementation
analysis (PCA), but it represents only about 2% of the
total interactions.
When a global analysis of GO enrichment was performed to identify potential bias in the BIOGRID database,
we observed an under-representation of interactions involving categories related to “mitochondrion” and “membrane” (Table 1), a result due in part to the predominance
of affinity capture-MS data. We interpret the under-representation of mitochondria proteins as a result of the high
fraction of membrane proteins present in this organelle
(42%, 479/1133). In contrast, the analysis of over-represented GO categories revealed that proteins associated
with complexes and proteins located in the nucleus are
over-represented, with 77% and 47% more interactions
involving these sets of proteins than what would be
expected by chance, respectively (see Table 1 for enrichment p-values). These categories are also highly enriched
in the affinity capture-MS dataset (Figure 1C).
The assumption underlying our interpretation of this
data which led to our hypothesis of bias against membrane
proteins is that membrane proteins engage in at least the
same number of true interactions as other protein classes.
This assumption is based in part on the extensive literature suggesting that membrane proteins function in complexes, which are a good proxy for interacting proteins.
Moreover, we investigated this directly by evaluating the
distribution of interaction degree normalized by the total
number of interactions in datasets rich in membrane
interactions (e.g., PF-PCA and SU-2HY, both with more
than 65% membrane interactions) or with a poor coverage
of membrane interactions (e.g., two hybrid (2HY), (29%)
and affinity capture-MS (14%)). We normalized the node
degree in order to make the different datasets more comparable since the average degree is dependent on the number of interactions and nodes identified by the method. By
normalizing by the total number of interactions, we
assume the methods detect the same relative number of
nodes, independently of localization (membrane, nucleus,
cytoplasm, etc). Thus, our results are consistent with the
hypothesis that membrane proteins undergo at least as
many interactions as other proteins, since we observed
that datasets rich in membrane interactions tend to have a
higher normalized degree (Figure 2A) than the datasets
with fewer of these interactions.
In order to exclude potential bias from the interaction
detection method used, we also evaluated the normalized
degree for membrane and non-membrane proteins
within datasets (Figure 2B-D). Again, we observed that
membrane proteins have a higher normalized node

Page 4 of 24

degree than other proteins, suggesting the correctness of
our assumption that membrane proteins have at least the
same number of protein-protein interactions as other
protein classes. For example, 52% of membrane proteins
have a normalized degree higher than 0.005 in the twohybrid dataset, while only 12% of other proteins have a
degree higher than that (Figure 2D).
Naturally, physically interacting proteins must co-occur
spatially and temporally and any network constructed
must consider that the interaction datasets available are
highly biased to specific locations. We consider this location bias as inevitable, and here we apply a new approach
to minimize its adverse effects for membrane network
reconstruction.
The Probabilistic Interaction Network (PIN)

As a consequence of the bias discussed above, a probabilistic network connecting many different types of biological
information between genes and proteins can have as its
main caveat the different properties of the original datasets.
To integrate heterogeneous datasets it is necessary to consider the tradeoff between coverage and prediction performance. The simple union of networks results high
coverage but low prediction performance given the quality
of some datasets. One alternative method is to consider the
intersection among the datasets, which results in good prediction performance, but the coverage is low [27]. To overcome these limitations, we applied a probabilistic approach
to construct a network less biased against membrane proteins. We used a simple and general error model (based on
the hypergeometric distribution) to calculate the probability for each interaction occurring at random, followed by
logistic regression to optimize the network performance
for interactions involving membrane proteins by varying
the weights of each network. In this way the network
weights were simultaneously optimized for best prediction
performance on the training set, and the resulting logistic
regression classifier was evaluated using the test set.
Hypergeometric scoring has proven to be robust across
different settings [8,28-32]. It also penalizes highly connected “promiscuous” interactors, since the probability of
occurrence of an interaction with this type of partner is
high in a random network resulting in a proportionally
low score in the network. Hypergeometric scoring favors
interactions between rare proteins over those between
common proteins, because to be predicted to interact,
common proteins must be virtually always observed as
interacting pairs [28].
Here we combined the hypergeometric scoring with
logistic regression to construct a network with less bias
against membrane interactions. This was achieved by the
following steps:
1) As mentioned earlier, although data from PPIs is
usually biased against membrane proteins, some

B, constructed with BIOGRID data excluding these
two datasets. Network A is highly enriched in interactions involving membrane proteins (corrected p-value =
10-70).
2) We generated 10 networks using different weights of
network A and B, which were combined by a simple logistic regression model with one free parameter (Figure 3)
[31].
3) Then we used the guilt-by-association approach to
select the best network from step 2. Our guilt-by-association approach works by transferring annotation from one
gene to another via gene interactions. Thus, a specific
localization may be assigned to a gene based on the profile

of its neighbors. We generated a functional linkage network with edge weights reflecting the probability that two
genes co-localize (same GO Slim term); for that, we used
the networks from step 2 to assign a score to each combination (candidate gene, GO Slim term) based on the
weights of interactions between the candidate gene and
genes currently assigned to that GO term. For example,
if a gene is connected to several genes located in the membrane, this gene gets a higher score (for membrane localization) than other gene that is not connected to
membrane genes.
4) We applied the guilt-by-association approach to
optimally select one of the 10 networks generated in step

Figure 3 Optimization of the weighting of the two networks in PIN. A) PIN was constructed by the optimized combination of two
networks: A (enriched in membrane interactions) and B (the rest of BIOGRID). The Area Under Curve (AUC) of Precision-Recall plots for the top
5,000 interactions was used for selecting the optimum weight for network B using membrane proteins from GO Slim as an established
benchmark dataset. The AUC was calculated for different weights for network B, and the weight corresponding to highest prediction
performance and higher number of membrane interactions (AUC = 0.62) was chosen (weight of network B = 0.5). The increased coverage of
membrane interactions reflected as the weight of network A (B) in the logistic regression is increased (decreased).

Brito and Andrews BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/169

2. For that, a random set of 2/3 and 1/3 of the genes in
GO Slim were selected as training and test sets, respectively. In the end, we selected the network with the
weights that showed the best crossvalidation performance
using AUC of precision versus recall curve and using
membrane genes as reference.
Thus, we used two measurements for optimality criteria: 1) The area under the precision versus recall curve
for a random set of 2/3 and 1/3 of the membrane genes
in GO Slim selected as training and test sets, respectively
and 2) the increased coverage of membrane interactions
reflected by the weight of network A in the logistic
regression. The weight we chose as optimal for constructing the probabilistic interaction network (PIN) was
0.5 and corresponds to the point at which the area under
the curve reaches a plateau (Figure 3 and Additional
file 1). Beyond this point the variation is very small,
(from 0.62 to 0.63) and unlikely to be significant. We
selected this point as optimal within the plateau as it
resulted in the highest coverage of membrane proteins.
Please, see Methods for more details.
The rapid change in area under the curve observed
around the weights 0.3-0.5 is likely the result of the tradeoff between membrane coverage and prediction performance in our model. This suggests that network A, while
rich in membrane interactions, does not have as much
prediction performance as the other BIOGRID interactions combined. Overall prediction performance follows
the relative weight of the networks A and B and the abrupt
change identifies the point at which adding additional
weight to the interactions in network A begins to decrease
the overall prediction performance unacceptably. We
observed good coverage of network A in PIN (Additional
file 2, Figure S1) with 828 interactions retained from network A in the top 5000 interactions. Thus, by optimizing
the combination of these two networks we obtained a
good representation of membrane interactions while
maintaining a good prediction performance.
The reason we selected the PPI datasets SU-2HY and
PF-PCA as network A was because these datasets showed
high quality and high coverage of membrane interactions.
To demonstrate the value of using selected high quality
datasets we constructed a second network where instead
of using a membrane-rich interaction dataset we used a
PPI network from iREF database as network A’. This iREF
network does not contain data used to construct PIN, has
9,412 interactions and 16.2% of its interactions involve at
least one membrane protein. The membrane network
used to construct PIN (network A) has fewer interactions
but 71.3% of them are membrane interactions. Following
the same approach as we applied to PIN, we plotted the
area under the curve and membrane interaction content
versus the weight of the iREF network (Additional file 2,
Figure S2). As above, the weight selected (0.8) represents

Page 8 of 24

the beginning of the plateau of area under the curve (0.38)
with the highest coverage of membrane interactions (657
interactions). For comparison, the weight selected for network A in PIN (0.5) resulted in a network of 706 membrane interactions and area under the curve of 0.62. Thus,
PIN has ~7% (706/657) more membrane interactions with
63% higher area under the curve (0.62/0.38). These results
suggest that the performance of our approach depends on
the fraction and accuracy of membrane interactions in
datasets used to construct the network. This performance
and coverage of membrane interactions could not be
reached by using the hypergeometric model alone. As
shown below, PIN’s performance was superior to the
hypergeometric model in all of the evaluations we
performed.
To provide additional information on the network properties we used the top 5000 interactions to evaluate the
network density of PIN compared to the hypergeometric
model alone. The network density is the number of connections present out of all possible connections [33]. PIN
produced a network with 2999 nodes (network density =
0.001) in the main network. Using only the hypergeometric model resulted in a network with the similar
density but fewer nodes (2723).
Performance evaluation of PIN

To analyze the performance of our PIN, we used a publicly available subcellular localization dataset generated
from a yeast strain collection expressing full-length proteins tagged at the carboxyl-terminus with green fluorescent protein [34]. While the bias observed in this dataset
is lower than techniques such as mass spectrometry, it is
still present (e.g. tail-anchored membrane proteins are
expected to be under-represented). Nevertheless, interactions involving two genes whose proteins localize in the
same compartment are more likely to be authentic than
interactions between proteins located in different subcellular compartments. Thus, the interactions in the PIN
were ranked in decreasing order of statistical significance
and for each cutoff (window size = 1000 interactions), we
counted the number of interactions involving genes
annotated as located in the same compartment. As
expected, we observed a relative increase in coverage of
membrane proteins when using PIN (Figure 4A). We
also observed a higher fraction of interactions from the
same compartment in comparison with the hypergeometric model for compartments related to membrane
especially the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 4B).
These interactions are likely to be primarily interactions
that represent the traffic of proteins between organelles
[16]. Furthermore, the PIN and the hypergeometric
model performed similarly for nuclear proteins and mitochondria (Figures 4C and 4D), indicating that the PIN is
not biased against these proteins.

Figure 4 PIN increases the proportion of membrane associated interactions in the network compared to a hypergeometric model or
random scoring. Coverage of interactions by PIN in different cell compartments: A) Membranes, All membranes; B) ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
C) Nucleus; D) Mitochondrion.

Nuclear proteins showed an inverted behavior: a
decrease in interaction density both using PIN and the
hypergeometric model. We interpret this last result partially as a consequence of both procedures minimizing

the effects of nuclear contaminants (false positives) that
bind to DNA (transcription factors) or RNA (binding
factors). These contaminants are usually co-purified
with DNA or RNA, thus forming a bridge with other

Brito and Andrews BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/169

proteins. Because they are common contaminants, these
indirect interactions are penalized under both the PIN
and the hypergeometric model [35]. As a result, when
the PIN was divided in quintiles of significance, an analysis of the cellular component of the Gene Ontology
showed a significant enrichment of nuclear proteins
mostly in the 4th-5th quintiles (lowest statistical significance) (Additional file 2, Figure S3-A). Similarly only
low significance interactions showed enrichment in biological processes and molecular functions that typically
involve protein binding to DNA or RNA (Additional
file 2, Figures S3-B and C).
The hypergeometric model performed similarly to PIN,
with an increased number of interactions compared to the
random network scores for both mitochondria (Figure 4D) and cytoplasm proteins (not shown). The reason the
two networks showed an accentuated increase of interactions in mitochondria may be because 42% of mitochondrial proteins are located in the membrane, which
represents a high fraction of the total mitochondria proteins. As expected for a high confidence interaction network and consistent with the PIN removing the bias
against membrane proteins, rather than introducing a bias
towards them, minimal enrichment in Gene Ontology
terms was observed in the 1 st quintile of significance
(Additional file 2, Figure S3 A-C).
In our present study, we removed the bias against
membrane proteins by increasing the relative contribution from a small number of datasets with high quality
membrane protein data. As a result, there would be an
unavoidable increase in false positive interactions for
lower significance scores as discussed above. To examine
this issue further we examined our PIN for over- and
under-representation of GO categories as evidence of
bias. Assuming that these proteins, e.g. proteins from
complexes, have the same average number of interactions
as other protein classes, there should not be any enrichment of these classes in the PIN compared to the whole
genome since the technique would ideally reflect the natural composition of the interactome. Most GO categories
were not highly over-represented in quintiles lower than
4th (Additional file 2, Figure S3 A-C). For example, protein complex only begins to be over-represented in 3rd
quintile. Taken together these results suggest that our
model successfully compensated for the pre-existing bias
against membrane proteins in the network, resulting in a
more representative collection of real interactions that
are not connected to other unrelated GO categories.
We also downloaded from Gene Ontology a list of 48
proteins from membrane complexes in yeast. Then, we
counted the number of interactions involving two proteins
from this list (Additional file 2, Figure S4). As expected,
we observed that PIN showed a higher coverage of interactions for these complexes than the hypergeometric model

or BIOGRID raw data. We also evaluated the coverage of
1223 transport genes (GO: 0006810) using the same
approach. Again, the coverage of interactions involving
transport genes was higher using PIN than the other two
networks.
As another approach to validate PIN, we characterized
network performance using a positive reference set (PRS)
and a random reference set (RRS) for protein interactions
[36,37]. The PRS set contained 9,412 unique interactions
not previously used in our analysis and was downloaded
from iRefIndex database, which consolidates protein interactions from 10 databases [38]. This reference set was generated by selecting those interaction datasets present in
the iRefIndex database but not in the BIOGRID database
used to construct PIN. These datasets were indexed by the
PubMed ID in order to select inedit data as our PRS. For
RRS, 100,000 unique random interactions were generated
with the same node degree distribution in PRS from a list
of all genes present in BIOGRID. Because there is no available gold standard for non-interacting proteins and
because randomly chosen protein pairs are unlikely a
priori to interact, our RRS serves as a reasonable negative
control set [37].
Comparing the performance of PIN with the hypergeometric model or BIOGRID raw data for the detection of
PRS (Figure 5A and 5C) or RRS (Figure 5B and 5D) interactions revealed that more PRS interactions were detected
using PIN than with the other datasets. We also observed
that the increased detection of interactions in PRS pairs by
PIN did not correspond to a high relative number of positive-scoring RRS pairs (false positives) for membrane
interactions (Figure 5B). In contrast, the hypergeometric
model, showed an increased sensitivity at the expense of
selectivity since it detected slightly more membrane interactions using RRS (higher false positive rate) than the
BIOGRID raw data (Figure 5D).
Even though PIN was optimized for the detection of
membrane interactions it showed a higher coverage of
PRS (higher true positive rate) than the hypergeometric
model for all genes (Figure 5C) and even nuclear proteins
(not shown) without increasing coverage of RRS (Figure
5D). It is likely that by increasing the coverage of bona
fide membrane interactions, the other interactions in the
lower quintiles were the higher confidence interactions
from BIOGRID. Thus, decreasing the bias against membrane proteins increased the proportion of true interactions in the high confidence quintiles independently of
their localization.

surrounding nodes - topological properties - can only be
analyzed at the network level, as genes/proteins by themselves cannot provide full information about the robustness of cellular function [39]. Thus, we assessed the
network topologies for the PIN with the aim of uncovering
intrinsic properties that distinguish our network from 1) a
network constructed based on a hypergeometric model

alone and 2) a network constructed by randomizing the
PIN scores. Another goal was also to evaluate the impact
that the bias against membrane proteins would have over
the topological properties of the resulting networks. Thus,
we selected a cut-off resulting in 5,000 interactions for
each network. We denote these sub-networks by adding
the suffix -5K, (e.g., PIN-5K). As expected, PIN-5K showed

Brito and Andrews BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/169

a higher fraction of membrane proteins after considering
the total number of nodes in the network: PIN-5K (21%,
639/2999), PIN with random scores-5K (18.5%, 527/2843),
and the hypergeometric model-5K (19%, 519/2723).
To evaluate the potential to form hubs, we calculated
the probability of a node having a specific number of
interactions as the number of nodes in a given degree
interval divided by the total number of nodes in the network. We observed that PIN-5K showed lower probability to form hubs (arbitrarily defined as nodes that have
more than 10 interactions) than the other two networks.
Only 56 (1.87%) of the PIN-5K nodes were hubs, while
for PIN with random scores-5K and the hypergeometric
model-5K networks 140 (4.92%) and 70 (2.57%) of the
nodes were hubs, respectively. Unlike PIN-5K, the
hypergeometric model-5K network showed enrichment
of hub genes related to RNA processing (p = 6 × 10-7),
macromolecule biosynthetic process (p = 3 × 10-7) and
mRNA polyadenylation (p = 3 × 10-10), all genes associated with false positives (Additional file 3). Consistent
with this interpretation, most functional categories with
a difference in enrichment between these networks are
those related to genes localized in the nucleus, which is
the main cell compartment with over-representation in
BIOGRID. As expected, the enrichment p-values
observed with the hubs in PIN-5K were consistently
higher (lower significance) when compared to what we
observed with hypergeometric model-5K network.
Together these results suggest that the process of
removing bias against membrane proteins resulted in
decreased over-representation of some unrelated gene
categories, as discussed above.
Having detected a different functional composition in
the networks, we next evaluated some network properties that could be affected by removing the bias against
membrane proteins. Thus, for each node we calculated
the clustering coefficient C w , which is defined as the
number of interactions between the neighbours of a single node divided by those that could possibly exist. This
coefficient is related to the existence of functional clusters [40]. We observed that even though PIN-5K contains fewer hubs, it is more clustered (Cw = 0.170) than
either the randomized network (C w = 0.006) or the
hypergeometric model network (C w = 0.165). For the
top 5000 interactions from each network, the lower
number of hubs together with the higher clustering
coefficient, observed for the PIN suggests a process
where the interactions were more equally distributed
among the genes, resulting both in increased clustering
and decreased average degree.
Membrane interactions and the centrality-lethality rule

The centrality-lethality rule (CLR) states that there is a
correlation between degree (number of interactions/

Page 12 of 24

protein) and the essentiality of the corresponding gene
[41]. Thus, proteins and genes highly connected with
other partners tend to be essential and therefore some
of their biological characteristics could be explained by
topological features [42,43]. However, He & Zhang [42]
suggested that the CLR is unrelated to highly connected
genes, but could be explained by the fact that hubs have
large numbers of interactions, and thus they have higher
tendency to engage in essential interactions. Ivanic et al
[44] showed that PPI networks constructed by using
interactions from affinity purification procedures have
good correlation between degree and abundance while
Y2H PPI networks do not. According to the authors, if
there is a degree/abundance correlation, there is also a
degree/essentiality relationship since the correlation
between essentiality and abundance is well established.
However, the relationship between essentiality and hubs
could be artificial due to essential proteins generally
being more abundant [44], and therefore methods
biased toward abundant proteins would be artificially
inflated with interactions involving essential proteins. In
fact, Batada et al [45] reported that the Y2H dataset
from Ito et al [12] has a weak correlation between
degree and essentiality. This same dataset was analyzed
elsewhere, where no difference between degree distributions of essential and nonessential proteins was observed
[44]. As we noted previously, membrane proteins tend
to be expressed at low levels, and thus we hypothesized
that the process of removing bias against membrane
proteins could also affect the relationship between
degree and essentiality, thus affecting the foundations of
the CLR.
To test the hypothesis that the membrane interaction
content of a network affects the CLR, we downloaded
the list of essential genes from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project [46]. Then we visually compared
the degree distributions of essential and nonessential
membrane proteins to determine if the degrees are
drawn from the same underlying population. We
observed different degree distributions of essential and
nonessential genes that varied with method used to generate the data. Interestingly, we also observed that the
membrane associated genes did not support the CLR
(Figure 6A-C).
To evaluate the relationship between membrane content and the CLR, we developed a nonparametric measure, the Index of Degree and Essentiality (Indess). The
Indess(k) of a network is the fraction of the essential
genes with degree greater than k divided by the fraction
of the non-essential genes with degree greater than k. We
applied this measure of association to assess the correlation between degree and essentiality over the networks
obtained from all PPI techniques with more than 300
unique interactions available in BIOGRID. Interestingly,

when we arbitrarily used k = 5, we observed a negative
Spearman correlation (-0.72, p = 0.012) between Indess
(5) and the fraction of membrane proteins interacting in
the network, suggesting a negative correlation of the CLR
and the content of membrane interactions (Figure 7A).
Consistent with this interpretation, the Indess(k) showed
a negative correlation with the membrane content independent of k (Additional file 2, Figure S5).
We also applied another nonparametric measure of
association, the Kendall’s tau rank correlation coefficient
[43], to assess the relationship between degree and essentiality. This analysis also showed a negative correlation
between the CLR and the content of membrane interactions in the network, suggesting that the CLR is valid
mainly for interaction datasets with a lower coverage of
membrane PPIs (Figure 7B). Thus, the most frequently
used PPI technique with the lowest coverage of membrane
interactions, affinity capture-MS, showed a strong correlation between degree and essentiality as measured by the
Kendall’s tau (0.277, p = 9.46E-96) and Indess (1.864),
while PF-PCA and SU-2HY, two datasets enriched in
membrane interactions, showed no significant correlation
between degree and essentiality (Table 2).
The analysis above used the PIN generated using an
optimized weight for the network enriched in membrane
interactions (network A). To further evaluate the impact
of our approach on the CLR we calculated the correlation between the weight of network A, and the Kendall’s
tau and Indess(5). Removal of the bias against membrane proteins showed an impact on the distribution of
node degree between essential and nonessential genes
(Table 3), reflected in a negative Spearman coefficient
between membrane interaction content and the Kendall’s tau (-0.90, p = 0.0002) and Indess(5) (-0.78, p =
0.005). These results show that the correlation between
high node degree proteins and essentiality that resulted
in the CLR is biased due to interaction datasets with an
under-representation of membrane proteins.
Ivanic et al [44] found that all yeast PPI datasets contain
significant enrichments of essential-essential interactions,
suggesting that essential proteins have higher probability
of interacting with each other than non-essential proteins
have of interacting with either essential or non-essential
proteins. If essential proteins have a higher degree than
non-essential proteins, we expect to observe more
mutually interconnected high-degree hubs than would
occur at random, independently of membrane PPI content. To test this, we calculated assortativity coefficients
for the data. As assortativity coefficients reflect the correlation between the degrees of all nodes on two opposite
ends of a link [47], networks with a positive assortativity
coefficient are likely to have mutually interconnected
high-degree hubs. On the other hand, networks with a
negative assortativity coefficient are likely to have widely

distributed high-degree hubs. We observed that most
datasets showed negative assortativity coefficients that
were not correlated with membrane interaction content
(Table 2). Similarly we observed no correlation between
membrane interaction content with density, which is the
mean network degree, or with mean clustering coefficient
(Additional file 2, Table S1). Assuming that essential proteins do have a higher probability of interacting with each
other [44], our results suggest that these proteins are not
hubs, since our results suggest that hubs don’t necessarily
interact with each other.
Analysis of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) using PIN

All of our data suggest that the PIN is a more robust accurate description of the interactions between proteins and
genes in cells than either raw BIOGRID data or BIOGRID
data refined using a hypergeometric model. Therefore, we
have applied the PIN to the analysis of PPI data for proteins involved in the UPR. In eukaryotic cells, most transmembrane proteins fold and mature in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). Thus, proteins enter the ER as unfolded
polypeptide chains where they acquire their final conformational structure during or after synthesis completes. To
manage this process, cells adjust the protein-folding capacity of the ER according to synthetic requirements, thereby
ensuring that the quality of cell-surface and secreted proteins can be maintained. The UPR is a eukaryotic stress
response initiated by detection of unfolded proteins in the
lumen of the ER, and triggers a compensatory response

mediated by a large number of co-regulated genes. As the
protein folding events involved occur in the ER, the cellular response therefore involves mostly biological processes
related to proteins located in the membrane/ER [48].
Thus, we reasoned that our PIN approach should
recover biological processes occurring in the UPR more
accurately than a probabilistic network constructed without reduction of bias against membrane proteins. In order
to verify this hypothesis, we evaluated the fraction of GO
Slim terms interacting with 243 UPR genes downloaded
from Jonikas et al [49] by using three different networks:
1) PIN, 2) a network constructed using BIOGRID data
and the hypergeometric model, which is actually a probabilistic network constructed without removing the bias
against membrane proteins, and 3) a network constructed
with raw data from the BIOGRID.
We observed that our model showed a better performance when compared to the hypergeometric model for
UPR-related GO Slim Terms. This can be visualized in
Figure 8A, where for the least 13 covered GO Slim terms
those more unlikely to be related to UPR were globally
under-represented in our PIN. For example, genes located
in the nucleus or related to processes occurring in the
nucleus (transcription, DNA binding, etc) were underrepresented. On the other hand, some terms relatively
more likely to participate in UPR showed a tendency to be
better represented (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, transporter
activity and vacuole) in the most 13 covered GO Slim
terms. Although other terms that might be involved in

The Kendall’s tau and Indess(5) are both inversely correlated to the content of membrane interactions.

UPR have a slightly increased representation in the network constructed with BIOGRID raw data (e.g. vesiclemediated transport, membrane fraction), it is likely that
this is due to the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. As a result of the low specificity of the raw BIOGRID
data, it ends up selecting more true positives at the
expense of a much higher number of false positives.
Although there are nuclear genes involved in UPR, they
constitute a small fraction of the total UPR related genes
and therefore, nuclear genes could be taken as negative
standard controls. The slightly lower relative prevalence
of interactions involving these categories and UPR genes
in PIN indicates that although our network has a higher
true positive rate (bona fide UPR interactions) compared
to the hypergeometric network, this did not correspond
to a higher false negative rate as represented by the coverage of nuclear GO Slim Terms. Thus, these results suggest globally that for UPR related genes our approach
was powerful in reducing the false positive rate without
unduly sacrificing sensitivity as evidenced by a higher
coverage of interactions with GO Slim terms related to
UPR processes.
The 3 global networks have the same number of interactions, although they have been scored differently. After
selecting the 243 UPR genes and their neighbors in PIN
and in the hypergeometric network in which the bias
against membrane proteins was not removed, we
observed that our model showed more interactions: 2956
interactions (1127 nodes, 2.62 interactions/node) compared to 2359 interactions (1074 nodes, 2.20 interactions/node) from the hypergeometric network. In
comparison, the raw data from the BIOGRID resulted in
a network with 7049 interactions (1352 nodes, 5.21 interactions/node) consistent with this network containing a
very large number of false positives (Figure 8A). The PIN

interactions for the UPR network are available as a
Cytoscape file in Additional file 4.
Our results suggest that the bias against membrane
proteins seems to be an effect derived mainly from physical interactions, since after calculating the correlation
between the fractions of GO Slim terms interacting with
UPR genes through genetic and physical interactions
(the bars in Figure 8A), we observed a low correlation
between the fractions identified by PIN and BIOGRID
raw data (Pearson’s correlation = 0.09). On the other
hand, the correlation was very high (0.88) when using
only genetic interactions. We presume this effect is
because genetic interaction data is not as biased against
membrane proteins.
We also evaluated the distribution of PPIs retrieved by
the 243 UPR gene set in the PIN, hypergeometric model
and BIOGRID networks and observed 47, 26, and 21
interactions in the top 20 K interactions, respectively.
Additionally, we evaluated the predictive power of PIN
by using the positive reference set (PRS) and random
reference set (RRS) described above. In fact, PIN was
superior as it retrieved 9 UPR interactions, while the
hypergeometric model and BIOGRID retrieved 4 and 0
interactions in the PRS, respectively. On the other hand,
the RRS had 2, 16, and 18 interactions retrieved by PIN,
hypergeometric model, and BIOGRID, respectively, confirming the lower rate of false positives of PIN. The PRS
and RRS sets were not used to construct the networks
and therefore, constituted an independent test set.
Analysis of Autophagy using PIN

Autophagy is a fundamental and phylogenetically conserved cellular quality control process by which cytoplasmic constituents including proteins, protein
aggregates, organelles, and invading pathogens can be

Figure 8 Analysis of coverage of genes involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy in PIN compared to
hypergeometric and raw BIOGRID data. For the 13 GO Slim terms with the highest and lowest interactions with UPR or ATG genes in PIN,
the fraction of GO Slim terms was compared for each network. We used the top 20% interactions in each network. A) The distribution of GO
Slim terms suggests that for the UPR network, PIN has many fewer false positives than raw BIOGRID data (e.g. terms related to nucleus). B) The
distribution of GO Slim terms suggests that for the ATG network PIN has many more true positives than the other methods and less false
negatives than the raw BIOGRID data.

delivered to lysosomes for degradation. It is characterized
by the formation of double-layered vesicles (autophagosomes) around intracellular cargo for delivery to lysosomes and proteolytic degradation. This process occurs
as a response to changes in the internal status of the cell
and/or changes in the extracellular environment [50,51].
In addition to its essential role for cell survival under
nutrient-deprived conditions, autophagy is also involved
in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes in eukaryotic organisms [52]. Using the same
approach as for UPR, we observed a similar performance
when we evaluated PIN using bona fide interactions
related to autophagy (Figure 8B), those interactions
involving genes that are probable to be functionally
involved in the UPR process, that is, interactions involving genes in vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum, etc. The
fraction of the GO Slim term interacting with autophagy
genes was calculated using the top 20% interactions.
Thus, the dramatic over-representation in the uncorrected BIOGRID network by GO Slim terms likely due to
the inclusion of false-positives was greatly reduced in the
autophagy PIN. Furthermore, for autophagy related
genes the PIN clearly outperformed the hypergeometric
model in capturing relevant GO Slim terms.
To apply our PIN to overview the network organization
of the autophagy system in yeast it was necessary to
increase the number of genes annotated as related to
autophagy, as only 31 autophagy (ATG) genes have been
reported in yeast so far [52]. Thus, we downloaded the
human autophagy network with 751 interactions (429 proteins) [53]. This physical interaction dataset was generated
by proteomics analysis of mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
data of proteins interacting with 32 human proteins linked
to autophagy or vesicle trafficking. Using this set of 429
proteins, we found in the INPARANOID database [54] a
set of 116 yeast orthologs, which with the addition of 31
yeast genes annotated as ATG-related, was expanded in
our PIN, by including their neighbors. The resulting yeast
autophagy network encompassed 2316 interactions and
982 genes, whose interactions are available as Cytoscape
file in Additional file 4.
To examine the resulting network, we selected the 4
main autophagy-related pathways; starvation-induced
autophagy, the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT)
pathway, pexophagy (an autophagic degradation pathway
for peroxisomes in yeast) and the core machinery for
membrane formation [52]. These pathways are shown in
Figure 9 where the genes that have orthologs in the
human autophagy network are shown in red. As expected,
among the 31 yeast autophagy proteins, the function of
Atg17, Atg29, and Atg31 are required specifically for starvation-induced autophagy and they form a ternary complex (Figure 9, the starvation pathway).

Page 18 of 24

We observed that ATG12 was present in the periphery
of both the CVT and pexophagy pathways but was absent
from the starvation pathway. This result was surprising as
while Atg12 is not essential for growth, it is essential for
autophagy and for maintaining viability during starvation
[55] and it occupies a central role in the core autophagy
network by connecting several other ATG genes (ATG3,
ATG7, ATG5, ATG16, ATG11, and ATG10). Atg12 is
part of two protein conjugation systems, each composed
of two ubiquitin-like proteins (Atg8 and Atg12) and
three enzymes (Atg3, Atg7 and Atg10 shown in Figure 9,
the core pathway) that are required for their conjugation
reactions. Atg12 forms a conjugate with Atg5, whereas
Atg8 is conjugated to phosphatidyl ethanolamine, a
major component of various biological membranes. Both
conjugates localize to autophagy-related membranes,
suggesting their direct involvement in the biogenesis of
these membranes [52].
Interestingly, the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complex proposed
to function as a conductor together with the Atg1-Atg13
complex in organizing the pre-autophagosomal structure
[52], formed a cohort of genes with ATG11 acting as a
hub (Figure 9, the pexophagy pathway). Although we used
the pexophagy-associated genes ATG11, ATG25, ATG28,
ATG30, and ATG26 plus their neighbors to select the
interactions representing pexophagy in our network, we
only retrieved the genes interacting with ATG11 and
ATG26 from PIN. The other 3 genes (ATG25, ATG28,
and ATG30) were not present in our autophagy network.
Consistent with our network analysis, all these 3 genes
showed inconsistent nomenclature when we searched the
SGD database [56].
To better organize the information available in the yeast
autophagy network and to reveal larger interacting functional modules, we applied a recently developed algorithm
based on link communities [57]. This algorithm performs
a hierarchical clustering of interactions, that is, instead of
assuming that a functional module is a set of nodes with
many interactions between them, it considers a module to
be a set of closely interrelated interactions. In contrast to
the existing algorithms, which have entirely focused on
grouping nodes, resulting in modules without overlap, by
performing clustering at the level of interactions instead of
genes this algorithm naturally incorporates imbricate sets
while revealing hierarchical organization in the network.
Interestingly, and consistent with the data in Figure 9, in
this analysis we observed that the starvation pathway is a
distinct set of interactions with low overlap with the other
three autophagy processes examined here (Additional file
2 Figure S6). In fact, it was shown elsewhere that portions
of the endoplasmic reticulum can be selectively packaged
into autophagosomes upon induction of the UPR or during starvation. Under strong UPR-inducing conditions,

ER-phagy depends on Atg proteins. However, when
induced by starvation, ER-phagy is only partly Atg-dependent. This suggests that during starvation, selective uptake
of portions of the ER by autophagosomes may not use the
entire phagophore assembly machinery [58]. This is consistent with our network observations showing that the
starvation pathway constitutes a relatively distinct pathway
among the ATG interactions.

Discussion
By integrating diverse sources of data based on physical
and genetic interactions, we constructed a probabilistic
network that can be used to analyze biological processes

occurring in the membranes of the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. The analysis of interactions involving membrane proteins poses several challenges that are distinct
from those encountered for soluble proteins. For example, the expression level of membrane proteins is lower
compared to soluble proteins [19]. Thus, any network
approach with the goal of good predictive power needs to
be re-assessed for membrane proteins.
Here we applied a statistical model combining hypergeometric distribution and logistic regression to increase
the coverage of membrane proteins, using the BIOGRID
database as a reference. In this combined model, the
hypergeometric distribution model was used to construct

Brito and Andrews BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/169

two networks with the most statistically significant interactions, while logistic regression was used to optimally
combine these two networks to increase the coverage of
membrane proteins without sacrificing prediction performance. Our results reinforce the necessity of considering
coverage and prediction performance together in the process of constructing probabilistic networks, since an
interaction dataset of high coverage is compromised if it
contains many false positives (low prediction performance). The prevalence of false positive interactions is
suggested by the fact that despite numerous analyses
about 41% of yeast PPIs exist in only one database [59].
By increasing the score threshold to identify and to
remove non-specific interactions and by replacing lower
quality interactions with higher quality membrane associated interactions our PIN resulted in a more robust
network for all interactions which can be used to analyze
a variety of biological data. Our approach also allows the
raw estimation of limits for prediction performance and
coverage (see Figures 3 and 4) of membrane interactions,
revealing the biased characteristics of publicly available
interaction data. The effectiveness of this approach was
shown by the increased coverage of membrane proteins
in PIN and by the comparable predictive performance
relative to the hypergeometric model alone.
In a similar approach, Xia et al. [6] integrated genomic
features (genome-wide sequence, function, localization,
abundance, regulation, and phenotype data in yeast) to
predict yeast helical membrane protein interactions using
a logistic regression classifier. Also, Zhang & Ouellette
[60] proposed a method to predict interactions between
membrane proteins using a probabilistic model based on
the topology of protein-protein interaction network and
that of domain-domain interaction network in yeast. Here,
we used a hypergeometric model plus logistic regression
to select interactions in BIOGRID in a manner which
effectively reduced the bias against membrane proteins in
the resulting network. Although these other approaches
also used logistic regression to represent interactions
involving membrane proteins more accurately, their
approach is a prediction algorithm designed to identify a
particular kind of membrane protein interactions using
training sets of interaction data [6,60]. In contrast, we
have constructed a PIN that allows the construction of
less biased networks with the goal of analyzing all membrane proteins.
The PIN we constructed provided new insight into the
applicability of the CLR (centrality-lethality rule) to
membrane proteins, provided a more balanced view of
the UPR (unfolded protein response) and confirmed the
modular nature of the autophagy network while simultaneously expanding the number of PPIs predicted to be
involved in this crucial cellular process in yeast. Our
approach can be adapted to other contexts to increase

Page 20 of 24

the coverage of specific classes of PPIs. For example, a
network could be constructed specifically to model interactions occurring in mitochondria, which is also a category under-represented in BIOGRID (Table 1). However,
for each such network, it is necessary to first choose an
adequate positive gold standard of proteins or interactions in order to optimize parameters and maximize prediction performance and coverage of the specific class of
interactions.
Our analysis suggests that some topological properties
of the yeast interactome can also be biased due to the
over-representation of proteins expressed in higher
levels, which are often essential proteins, and to the parallel low representation of membrane PPIs. Although
not directly related to the lethality-essentiality rule, the
scale-free model of biological networks is often used to
explain the robustness of these networks. However, this
explanation is made by assuming that highly connected
proteins tend to be essential and taking for granted that
proteins have widely different connectivities. We
observed in this study that part of this unequal distribution of degrees can be due to the bias towards abundant
proteins and, by extension, against membrane proteins.
In fact, our findings could help to explain why scale-free
topology of some partial interactome data cannot be
confidently extrapolated to complete interactomes [61].
In addition, it was also noted the discrepancies in
matching existing interactome networks to a scale-free
topology, suggesting that the structure of PPI networks
is better modeled by a geometric random graph than by
a scale-free model [62].

Conclusions
Our results suggest that selection against membrane protein interactions is a key factor determining the prediction performance of PPI networks in yeast and probably
for other organisms. We demonstrate that this bias
affects topological properties of the resulting probabilistic
network. In addition, our findings also suggest that the
validity of the CLR, and other factors associated with PPI
networks, such as coverage of some interactions occurring in membrane-associated compartments, are likely to
be affected by these constraints. Our simple computational approach was effective in decreasing this bias and
allowed the construction of a probabilistic network that
is more representative of the real interactions occurring
in yeast. Our PIN allowed us to make new predictions
about the regulation of UPR and autophagy, two essential
processes associated with subcellular membranes.
Methods
Construction of PIN using the guilty-by-association
approach

PIN was constructed in seven steps:

Brito and Andrews BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/169

1) Calculate the significance of each interaction in BIOGRID using hypergeometric distribution (see below) in
order to construct networks A and B (see paper). This
should be done separately for each network A and B.
2) Sum up the scores for redundant interactions in
each network A and B.
3) Combine networks A and B using logistic regression (see below) with different weights. This step generates 10 networks with weights of network A varying
between 0 and 1.
Training the 10 networks:
4) Divide the GO Slim terms between membrane and
non-membrane annotations. Train the network against
the training set of all genes-GO Slim annotations by
selecting two thirds of the pairs gene-GO Slim annotation.
These pairs will be used for training the network. The rest
is the test set. The training is done by summing up the
scores associated with the pairs gene-GO Slim annotation
used as training set, e.g., if a gene is associated in the network to 3 membrane genes, the scores of these 3 interactions are summed up. These scores are the -log10(p-value)
of the hypergeometric distribution calculated in the step 1,
which evaluates the significance of interactions, that is,
those most significant interactions have a lower p-value
(higher score).
Please note that there are two scores: one for the significance of interactions (from the hypergeometric distribution) and the other for the association with membrane
genes, which is calculated by summing up these scores
(from the hypergeometric distribution) of all membrane
genes associated with that particular gene. Thus, the more
membrane genes a gene is associated with, the higher the
score (for membrane localization) for that gene.
5) Once the network is trained, that is, after each gene
has a score associated to the probability of being membrane, obtain the true labels (membrane or non-membrane) for each gene in test set by using the test set (from
step 4) of GO Slim annotations.
6) Calculate the AUC of precision-recall curves. To do
that, it’s necessary two vectors: one with the binary
values corresponding to true positives and false positives
(1 or 0, respectively) generated in the step 5, the other
vector contains the respective prediction scores.
7) Select one network (out of 10) with the best tradeoff between membrane content and AUC.
Hypergeometric distribution

We applied a probabilistic approach to construct a network with less bias against membrane proteins by using
a simple and general error model based on the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the probability for
each interaction occurring at random [32]. This score
system has proved to be robust across different settings.
It penalizes high-degree “promiscuous” interactors since

Page 21 of 24

the probability of occurrence of an interaction with this
type of partner is high in a random network. In other
words, this model penalizes proteins interacting with
many different partners because these interactions have
a high probability of occurring by random chance, indicating strongly context-dependent interactions. Thus,
such cases receive a proportionally low score in the
network.
Given an interaction dataset, the probability that two
genes A and B interact with each other at random is:
⎛
⎞
min (n,m)

− log P = − log ⎝

p(i|n, m, N)⎠
i=k

Where:

p(i|n, m, N) =

n
i

N−n
m−i
N
m

In this approach, P indicates the probability that genes
A and B will interact by chance. For each interaction:
n and m = number of interactions in which each gene
A and B is involved, respectively
N = total number of interactions observed in the
entire dataset
k = the number of times the interaction between A
and B is observed
We applied this hypergeometric distribution model to
construct two networks: network A, constructed based
on interaction datasets PF-PCA and SU-2HY, and network B, constructed with data from the BIOGRID database (version 2.0.57) without those two datasets.
Network A is enriched in interactions involving membrane proteins.
Logistic regression

To combine the two networks (A and B) in such way
that the coverage of membrane PPIs was increased
while maintaining the prediction performance, we used
a simple logistic regression model with one free parameter to combine the scores of networks A and B by
optimizing a precision versus recall performance curve
[31]. Thus, for a given gene i and a target function j, let
the probability score computed by the networks A and
B be equal to PX(i,j) and PY(i,j), respectively. Then we
can calculate the corresponding combined score P(i,j)
defined as:
log(

py (i, j)
P(i, j)
Px(i, j)
)
) = w. log(
) + (1 − w). log(
1 − P(i, j)
1 − Px(i, j)
1 − Py (i, j)

Logistic regression was applied to combine the networks with the optimal weight parameter w. The factor

Brito and Andrews BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:169
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/5/169

w was optimized over the range from 0 to 1 (window =
0.1) to produce the highest area under the precision versus recall curve using as reference genes annotated as
membrane protein (GO:0016020). This produced 10
networks, each one using different weights for networks
A and B. The best weight (out of 10) was selected based
on the guity-by-association approach using the Precision-Recall curve and membrane interactions as
reference.

Page 22 of 24

f(k) = number of non-essential genes with degree
greater than k in the network
F = total number of non-essential genes in the
network
Thus, an Indess(k) > 1 indicates that essential genes
tend to have a higher degree than non-essential genes,
while an Indess(k) < 1 suggests essential genes tend to
have lower degree, and Indess(k) = 1 that there’s no difference between essential and non-essential genes in
terms of degree.

Analysis of GO enrichment

To analyze the enrichment of GO categories in each
level of significance of the PIN, we ranked the network
in decreasing order of scores and divided the interactions into quintiles. We then randomly sampled 1000
interactions in each quintile and selected the unique set
of ORFs to perform a GO enrichment analysis using
BINGO [63]. Categories with enrichment more significant than p < 0.001 after Bonferroni’s correction were
selected to be plotted.
Validation of the network

To calculate precision and recall, we performed threefold cross-validation to obtain a probability score for
each gene-GO Slim annotation using a guilt-by-association approach, and used these scores to assess performance [31]. Thus, we downloaded GO Slim annotations
and used this dataset by randomly selecting 1/3 of the
pairs gene-annotation to hold out for the testing set.
Therefore, we applied this analysis on one subset (the
training set), and validated on the other independent subset (the testing set).
Network density

To calculate network density (Nden), we applied the formula:
Nden = 2K/(N2 − N);

Where: N is the number of nodes and K is number of
interactions in the network.
Index of Degree and Essentiality (Indess)

We defined the Indess(k) of a network as the fraction of
the essential genes with degree greater than k divided by
the fraction of the non-essential genes with degree
greater than k:
Indess(k) =

e(k)/E
f (k)/F

Where:
e(k) = number of essential genes with degree greater
than k in the network
E = total number of essential genes in the network

Assortativity coefficient

The assortativity is a correlation coefficient for the
degrees of linked nodes. A positive assortativity coefficient indicates that nodes tend to link to other nodes
with the same or similar degree [47].
Link communities

The algorithm based on link communities performs a
hierarchical clustering of interactions and considers a
module to be a set of closely interrelated interactions.
Given the set of node i and its neighbours n+(i), for link
pairs that share a node k, the similarity between links
eik and ejk is S(eik , ejk) = |n+(i) ∩ n+(j)|/|n+(i) U n+(j)|
[57]. We implemented this algorithm in MatLab. Then
we used the GENE-E [64] to perform the average-linkage hierarchical clustering with Kendall’s tau as similarity metric distance.

for the top 5,000 interactions was used for selecting the optimum
weight for network B using membrane proteins from GO Slim as an
established benchmark dataset. The AUC was calculated for different
weights for network B, and the weight corresponding to prediction
performance in the plateau with higher number of membrane
interactions (AUC = 0.38) was chosen as the optimal weight of network
B (0.8). Like PIN the performance of this network increased with
increasing membrane interactions. Figure S3 - The enrichment analysis
