Rapid Leptospira identification by direct
sequencing of the diagnostic PCR products
in New Caledonia
Julie Perez, Cyrille Goarant*

Abstract
Background: Most of the current knowledge of leptospirosis epidemiology originates from serological results
obtained with the reference Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT). However, inconsistencies and weaknesses of
this diagnostic technique are evident. A growing use of PCR has improved the early diagnosis of leptospirosis but
a drawback is that it cannot provide information on the infecting Leptospira strain which provides important
epidemiologic data. Our work is aimed at evaluating if the sequence polymorphism of diagnostic PCR products
could be used to identify the infecting Leptospira strains in the New Caledonian environment.
Results: Both the lfb1 and secY diagnostic PCR products displayed a sequence polymorphism that could prove
useful in presumptively identifying the infecting leptospire. Using both this polymorphism and MLST results with
New Caledonian isolates and clinical samples, we confirmed the epidemiological relevance of the sequence-based
identification of Leptospira strains. Additionally, we identified one cluster of L. interrogans that contained no
reference strain and one cluster of L. borgpetersenii found only in the introduced Rusa deer Cervus timorensis russa
that is its probable reservoir.
Conclusions: The sequence polymorphism of diagnostic PCR products proved useful in presumptively identifying
the infecting Leptospira strains. This could contribute to a better understanding of leptospirosis epidemiology by
providing epidemiological information that cannot be directly attained from the use of PCR as an early diagnostic
test for leptospirosis.

Background
Leptospirosis is recognized as the most widespread zoonosis worldwide [1]. It can be a lethal disease with high
endemicity in the tropics. However, epidemics have also
been described, most frequently associated with particular meteorological events [2,3].
The epidemiology of leptospirosis has classically been
described on the basis of serological data, an indirect biomarker, using the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT),
a technique regarded so far as the “gold standard” for
identifying the infecting serovar from human or animal
sera [1,4]. MAT results have provided epidemiologically
important data allowing the identification of the infection
sources or reservoirs and have largely contributed to the

current knowledge of leptospirosis epidemiology. However, MAT is not without weaknesses and was notably
shown to be a poor predictor of the infection serovar [5].
The taxonomy of the genus Leptospira has now been
clarified from genetics and leptospirosis can now be studied using genetic tools, when isolates are available
[6,7]. Similarly, leptospirosis diagnosis increasingly relies
on PCR results [3], where a single positive sample provides a certainty diagnosis before serological conversion
[4]. This frequently results in the loss of the serologybased identification of the infecting strains, which is epidemiologically important to identify the reservoirs.
Therefore, the increased use of PCR has greatly
improved the early diagnosis of leptospirosis, but paradoxically restricts data available for epidemiological surveillance. Yet, because the genetic tools implemented
provide an insight into the genome of the infecting
strain, epidemiologically relevant information might be

deduced from sequence polymorphisms of the diagnostic PCR products. This approach was notably suggested
and evaluated by Victoria et al. [8] while studying the
phylogeny of the S10-spc-a locus: these authors demonstrated that this locus is highly conserved and a useful
phylogenic target. They additionally suggested a short
245 bp region of secY as a suitable target for diagnosing
leptospirosis by PCR, the sequence of the diagnostic
PCR product then being epidemiologically informative.
Actually, a diagnostic PCR using this target was later
designed, validated according to international guidelines
and confirmed to provide an epidemiologically relevant
phylogeny [9].
New Caledonia is an archipelago of the South-West
Pacific (19-23°S; 164-167°E). Leptospirosis is known to be
endemic with epidemic bursts occurring during hot rainy
periods [3,10-12]. Presumptive serovars in New Caledonia based on MAT on human leptospirosis cases are
Copenhageni, Icterohaemorragiae, Castellonis, Panama,
Pomona, Australis and Pyrogenes [10,11,13,14]. The only
native mammals are bats and flying foxes. Very few
imported mammals are present: 4 rodent species (Rattus
rattus, Rattus norvegicus, Rattus exulans and Mus musculus) and domestic as well as feral dogs, cats, cattle, horses,
goats, sheeps and the Rusa deer Cervus timorensis russa.
The qPCR technique used for leptospirosis diagnosis
in New Caledonia amplifies a 331pb DNA fragment
within the lfb1 gene, which sequence polymorphism
allows the identification of the species of the infecting
Leptospira strain using melting curve analysis [15].
The Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) technique
uses sequence polymorphisms of multiple housekeeping
genes for isolate characterization and to investigate evolutionary relationships among closely-related bacteria. It
is increasingly considered as the gold standard typing
method, at least in species where sufficient sequence
polymorphisms exists in housekeeping genes, because it
relies on sequence data that are exchangeable and independent of the analytical platform [16,17]. This technique, successfully applied to a number of bacterial
pathogens, was notably recently applied to the study of
leptospires: various typing schemes based on the comparison of 2855-3165 bp concatenated sequences of
housekeeping genes were proposed [18-20] and evaluated over Leptospira spp. reference strains and isolates.
Because of the limited mammal diversity in New Caledonia, we hypothesized that a limited diversity of pathogenic
Leptospira strains would be present and aimed at evaluating if the sequence polymorphism of diagnostic PCR products would allow the identification of the infecting
Leptospira. To better investigate this hypothesis and the
epidemiology of leptospirosis in New Caledonia, we also
performed a MLST study on a collection of isolates and
evaluated its direct feasibility using leptospirosis patients’

serum DNA extracts. Additionally, extracts from Leptospira-infected deer kidneys contributed to a better description of the Leptospira strains currently involved in
leptospirosis in New Caledonia.

Methods
Bacterial strains

The strains studied were collected from 1989 to 2000
throughout mainland New-Caledonia. Eighteen were
isolates from patients’ blood received at Institut Pasteur
for diagnosis purpose, and 2 were isolated from deer in
1992, kindly provided by the New Caledonian Reference
Veterinary Laboratory. Previously studied VNTR (Variable Nucleotide Tandem Repeat) profiles and serological
identification of these isolates [13] allowed the selection
of isolates from the 4 different serovars identified in our
collection. The list of the isolates, their serological and
VNTR-based identifications are presented in Table 1.
Clinical specimens

Clinical samples (sera) routinely received at Institut Pasteur in Nouméa, for the diagnosis of leptospirosis were
also included in the study. We studied 88 human PCR
positive sera collected from January 2008 to February
2010. Twelve PCR-positive deer kidney samples collected
in 2010 during a sampling campaign in a slaughterhouse
were also included. The 27 human samples used for
drawing phylogenic trees are summarized in Table 2.
DNA extraction

For human samples, total DNA from serum (200 μl) was
extracted using an automatic method on an EasyMAG
apparatus (Biomerieux). For bacterial cultures and animal
samples, total DNA from a culture pellet, or kidney (ca.
25 mg) was extracted using the QIAamp DNA minikit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR analysis

The real time PCR routinely used for leptospirosis diagnosis targets the lfb1 gene as described by Mérien et al.
[15] and was run on a LightCycler LC 2.0 using the
LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit
(Roche Applied Science, New Zealand).
For the MLST study, we used the typing scheme
described by Thaipadungpanit et al. that uses the
sequence polymorphism of pntA, sucA, pfkB, tpiA,
mreA, glmU and fadD [20]. Amplifications were performed in a 25 μl total volume containing 1-10 ng genomic DNA, 5 pmol of each primer, 200 μM dNTP with
1.25 mM MgCl2. Two different DNA polymerases were
used for DNA amplification: either 1 unit of Red Hot
Taq DNA Polymerase, Thermo Scientific (ABgene) or
1.25 units of FastStart High Fidelity PCR System (Roche
Applied Science), in their corresponding 1× buffer.

GenBank accession numbers of the sequences obtained from these isolates are provided as additional file 1 Table S1.

A GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystem) was
used to perform PCR with an initial denaturation step at
94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 20
seconds, variable annealing temperature for 30 seconds,
72°C for 50 seconds for Red Hot Taq DNA Polymerase
and 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, variable annealing
temperatures for 30 seconds, 72°C for 50 seconds for
FastStart High Fidelity DNA Polymerase, then 72°C for
7 minutes. PCR product size, primer sequences and
annealing temperatures are shown in Table 3.
The secY gene was also amplified using PCR conditions
previously described [9,18] or combinations of forward
and reverse primers of these 2 techniques. The recently
described diagnostic PCR used the cycling conditions
described by the authors [9], except that it was performed
with the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green
I kit on a LightCycler 2.0 apparatus and that the number
of amplification cycles was increased to 50.
Detection of PCR products

The amplification products were directly analyzed using
the LightCycler software and/or visualized by gel electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel stained with GelRed
Nucleic Acid Gel Stain 1× (Biotium).

DNA Sequencing

PCR products were purified using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit or MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified PCR
products were directly sequenced in both forward and
reverse directions using the same primers as for PCR using
the ABI BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems) with the following modifications:
Each 20 μl reaction contained 0.0625× ready reaction premix, 1× BigDye sequencing buffer, 3.2 pmol forward or
reverse primer, 5-10 ng DNA and ddH2O. Cycle sequencing was performed using initial denaturation at 96°C for 1
minute followed by 60 cycles of 10 seconds at 96°C, 5 seconds at 50°C and 4 minutes at 60°C in a GeneAmp PCR
System 9700 (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing products were purified on home-made Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia) columns in Multiscreen filter plates (Millipore) and
sequenced on an ABI 3730 × l automated sequencer.
Assembly, editing and finishing of the sequences using
both the forward and reverse reaction results were made
using the Staden Package [21]. DNA sequences from
reference strains of relevant serovars were retrieved
from http://www.mlst.net[20], from LepBank [22] or
from GenBank.

MLST data analysis

Results

Individual gene or concatenate sequences were aligned
using BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 [23]. Phylogenic analyses were
conducted with PHYLO_WIN version 2 [24], the consensus
tree being drawn based on 1000 bootstrap replicates with
Kimura 2 parameter. L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa
was used as outgroup for all phylogenic analyses.

PCR results on clinical isolates

All 7 PCRs described for the MLST scheme by Thaipadungpanit et al. [20] successfully amplified a product of
the expected size with DNA from all isolates belonging
to the species L. interrogans. However, for some isolates,
the annealing temperature for amplifying mreA had to

be lowered down to 45°C to obtain a successful amplification. For L. borgpetersenii isolates, only pntA and
glmU could successfully be amplified. The secY product
used by Ahmed et al. [18] was successfully amplified
from all isolates, either L. interrogans or L. borgpetersenii. Using the diagnostic PCRs, lfb1 was amplified with
extracts from human sera or deer kidney with leptospires concentration equal to or lower than 50 per ml or
per mg, respectively. The secY diagnostic PCR product
could be amplified from clinical samples containing
down to ca. 60 leptospires/ml on our qPCR platform.
glmU and pntA were successfully amplified from clinical
specimens containing ≥ ca. 200 leptospires per ml using
either DNA polymerase tested.
Diagnostic PCR product-deduced phylogeny

We aimed at evaluating if the direct sequencing of a
diagnostic PCR product could also allow the putative
identification of the infecting strain. Early diagnosis of
human leptospirosis in New Caledonia relies on the lfb1
PCR [15]. Therefore, the lfb1 diagnostic PCR products
of the collection isolates, from patients recruited
between January 2008 and February 2010 and from deer
kidneys sampled in 2010 were directly sequenced. lfb1
sequences of reference strains retrieved from GenBank
were also included and aligned. This allowed the construction of an lfb1-based phylogeny, supported by a
222 bp sequence. This allowed the distinction of 2

clusters among New Caledonian L. borgpeterseniiinfected clinical samples, one including references
sequences of the serovars Sejroe and Castellonis, the
other including the sequence of the reference strain of
Hardjo-bovis respectively.
These results are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2
and 4. Among L. interrogans-infected clinical samples,
five clusters were evidenced: one cluster included the
reference strains of the serovars Icterohaemorragiae,
Copenhageni and Pyrogenes (later named cluster
L. interrogans 1), one cluster included reference strains
of the serovars Lai, Australis and Autumnalis (named
cluster L. interrogans 2), one cluster included the reference strain of the serovar Bataviae (cluster L. interrogans
3), one cluster included reference strains of the serovars
Canicola and Pomona (cluster L. interrogans 4); lastly,
one cluster included no reference sequence of any
known serovar (later named L. interrogans 5).
We also evaluated if the direct sequencing of the secY
diagnostic product [9] could confirm the existence of the
different clusters identified using lfb1 polymorphism (Figure 2). The 202 bp PCR product could successfully be
amplified and sequenced from DNA extracted from all
isolates. Using DNA from clinical specimens, samples
from both lfb1-deduced clusters of L. borgpetersenii were
successfully amplified and sequenced, but only samples
from 3 out of the 5 lfb1-deduced clusters of L. interrogans
could be amplified (clusters L. interrogans 1, 4 and 5).

However, samples from the two remaining clusters (clusters L. interrogans 2 and 3) were scarce (see Table 4) and
had low Leptospira concentrations (see Table 2). secY products using DNA from these clinical specimens could not
be generated, even using combinations of primers used for

the MLST study [18] and for diagnosis [9]. However, the
phylogeny deduced from a 174 bp alignment of the diagnostic secY product confirmed the clusters identified by
both the MLST and lfb1 typing schemes. Strains from
cluster L. interrogans 5 had sequences 100% identical to

MLST-deduced phylogeny

DNA sequences retrieved from databases or sequenced
from products successfully amplified were concatenated
and allowed drawing a phylogeny of the New Caledonian isolates, together with reference strains (Figure 3).
GenBank accession numbers of the sequences generated
and used in this study are provided as additional file 1
Tables S1 and S2. Because the DNA sequences of the
same reference strains were not available, secY
sequences were not concatenated with the 7 genes used
by Thaipadungpanit et al. [20]. The phylogeny was
established independently for L. interrogans strains and
isolates (7 genes providing a concatenate sequence of
3155 bp) and for L. borgpetersenii (2 genes for a total
concatenate sequence of 968 bp). Both phylogenies are
presented in Figure 3a and 3b respectively. These results
evidenced three clusters among the L. interrogans New
Caledonian isolates and two clusters among L. borgpetersenii isolates. Based on sequences of reference isolates
available in databases, these clusters could putatively be
assigned to a few serogroups. Among L. interrogans isolates, one cluster could correspond to serovars Pomona,
Canicola, Pyrogenes or Hebdomadis, another one to the
serovar Icterohaemorragiae or Copenhageni. Lastly, one
L. interrogans cluster did not match to any known reference strain. Among L. borgpetersenii isolates, one clustered with L. borgpetersenii Hardjo-bovis JB197, whereas
four other isolates clustered together, but no publicly
available sequence allowed putatively identifying this
cluster.
Direct MLST from clinical specimens

To further confirm the existence of the 5 L. interrogans
clusters identified with lfb1 polymorphism on clinical
samples, we tried to amplify and sequence glmU and

0%

pntA from these clinical samples, using the MLST primers and PCR conditions. Actually, these 2 genes are
correctly amplified from isolates belonging to both
L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii species and their
polymorphism allows discriminating the same clusters
within New Caledonian L. interrogans isolates as the 7
genes do (data not shown). When using L. interrogansinfected clinical specimens, these two genes were successfully amplified from samples infected with ≥ ca. 200
leptospires per ml.

Discussion
While studying the sequence polymorphism of our diagnostic lfb1 qPCR product [15] in clinical specimens and
a collection of isolates, we identified 2 L. borgpetersenii
clusters and 5 L. interrogans clusters (Figure 1). Interestingly, one L. interrogans cluster (cluster 5) contained
only sequences from human clinical specimens and did
not include any known sequence of a reference strain,
even after extensive searches in public databases.
In order to confirm these presumptive identifications and
to try to identify the cluster 5, we then conducted a MLST
study using a collection of Leptospira isolated in the 19892000 period from human leptospirosis cases in New Caledonia, together with two isolates from deer kindly provided
by the Veterinary Reference Laboratory. This MLST study
similarly evidenced (Figure 3) three clusters of L. interrogans (corresponding to isolates grouped in L. interrogans
clusters 1, 4 and 5). The clustering of isolates was in agreement with the lfb1-derived phylogeny. This result suggests
that in the New Caledonian context, these lfb1-derived L.
interrogans clusters are monophyletic and probably each
correspond to a single serovar. Again, L. interrogans cluster
5 did not contain any sequence of a known reference isolate, suggesting that it might correspond to a serovar not
yet described, or at least not included in public sequence
databases. Though the MLST phylogeny suggests that
strains from this latter cluster could be related to the serovar Australis, seroconversions observed in New Caledonian
patients infected with this strain merely point to Pyrogenes,
a serogroup regarded as serologically related to Australis
(data not shown). Whether this cluster corresponds to a

serovar not yet described or to a serovar described but
which corresponding gene sequences have not been published remains to be studied.
To further identify L. interrogans clusters 2 and 3 and
to evaluate the feasibility of direct MLST from clinical

specimen DNA extracts, we then tried to evaluate the
sequence polymorphism of the MLST targets using
these clinical samples. Unfortunately, though both glmU
and pntA could successfully be amplified and sequenced
from extracts of patients containing ca. 200 leptospires

per serum ml or more, none of the patients identified in
these 2 clusters had leptospiraemia higher than 50 leptospires per ml. Interestingly, none of the isolate of our
collection had lfb1 sequences identical to any of these
two clusters. Because our isolate collection contains
only strains collected until the year 2000, it cannot be
known whether strains from these clusters were present
in New Caledonia before 2001. They most probably
already represented a limited part of the human cases
during this earlier period, as suggested by their low incidence over more than 2 years from 2008-february 2010
(see Table 4). It can also be hypothesized that strains
from these clusters are of limited virulence to humans,
therefore only associated with low leptospiraemia and

Page 9 of 11

would therefore seldom be evidenced, either by cultures
(before 2001) or PCR (after 2001).
Within L. borgpetersenii isolates, only two of the seven
genes used in the MLST study of L. interrogans could
be amplified. Actually, the set of primers used here was
described by Thaipadungpanit et al [20] for use in
L. interrogans isolates and was not supposed to amplify
these genes in isolates from other species. Other MLST
schemes have been used over a wider range of Leptospira species [18,19]. These could have allowed a better
typing of New Caledonian L. borgpetersenii isolates or
clinical specimens. An ongoing program aimed at
sequencing the complete genomes of a very large number of pathogenic Leptospira isolates (Vinetz J., com.
pers.) will allow the selection of the most appropriate
targets and to design primers for MLST studies addressing other Leptospira species. The phylogeny deduced
from the sequence of these 2 genes evidenced two clusters of L. borgpetersenii, one including the fullysequenced L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo-bovis [26],
the other one containing no reference sequence. Again,
these clusters were in agreement with the clusters
derived from the lfb1-based phylogeny. Interestingly,
sequences from the cluster containing the Hardjo-bovis
reference strain were found only in deer and none of
the 88 human clinical samples evidenced this sequence.
This suggests that the introduced deer C. timorensis
russa might be a reservoir for this Leptospira strain.
Other gene phylogenies have been studied, demonstrating that these genes might be sequenced to more
precisely identify Leptospira strains, notably ligB [27],
rpoB [28] and secY [8,9,18]. However, though they
might prove useful in MLST or other phylogeny studies,
most of them can currently only be used when sufficient
amounts of DNA of the infecting strain is available,
because no high-sensitivity diagnostic PCR was validated
using these gene targets. However, a secY-based diagnostic PCR was recently described [9] and the sequence
polymorphism of the gene segment amplified was validated as a relevant phylogenic tool [8,9]. Therefore, we
evaluated if the phylogeny of clinical specimens using
this target would confirm the ones obtained with both
MLST and the lfb1 sequence polymorphism, and notably confirm and provide a more precise identification of
L. interrogans clusters 2 and 3. The secY-derived phylogeny was in agreement with both the MLST and the
lfb1-derived phylogenies and identified the same clusters
(Figure 2). However, L. interrogans clusters 2 and 3 that
were only evidenced by lfb1 polymorphism from clinical
specimens could not be confirmed because no secY PCR
product could be amplified from any of these specimens.
Whether this was due to the low leptospiraemia of the
corresponding patients (see Table 2) and using a different qPCR platform and different PCR reagents from the

ones described by Ahmed et al. [9] or to primer mismatch in the corresponding DNAs remains unknown.
Interestingly, L. interrogans cluster 5 had a secY
sequence identical to L. meyeri serovar Perameles strain
Bandicoot (a strain recently reassigned to the species L.
interrogans [25]) and L. interrogans serovar Hardjo
strain Hardjoprajitno. However, this identity was not
confirmed by MLST or lfb1 sequences.

better decipher the circulation schemes and reservoirs
and adapt prevention measures.

Conclusions
Using a combination of MLST and other sequence polymorphisms, we evidenced 7 different Leptospira genovars
belonging to both L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii.
They would correspond to at least 7 strains currently circulating in New Caledonia, should two or more strains
not be discriminated by this typing scheme. Within these
7 putative strains, one was presumptively identified as
L. borgpetersenii Hardjo-bovis and could be found only in
deer, which might constitute its reservoir. Because deer
hunting is a highly frequent practice in New Caledonia
both for leisure and subsistence and it can be assumed
that hundreds of people are exposed to deer kidneys
weekly (frequently bare foot and with no protective
gloves), this suggests that this strain is either poorly
transmitted, as discussed in light of its genome reduction
[26], or of low virulence to humans. We also identified a
L. interrogans strain (cluster 5) that could not be related
to any known reference strain. Though its secY sequence
suggests that it could be related to known reference
strains (L. interrogans -formerly L. meyeri- sv. Perameles
strain Bandicoot and L. interrogans sv. Hardjo strain
Hardjoprajitno), the more precise MLST sequence polymorphism contradicts this identification. These strains
could therefore correspond to a serovar not yet
described. We directly amplified two genes of the MLST
scheme using extracts from human clinical specimens
with leptospiraemia of 200 leptospires per ml or higher.
It might therefore be possible to conduct MLST studies
directly from clinical specimens if selecting samples with
leptospiraemia equal to or higher than 200/ml. Lastly, we
demonstrated that the polymorphism of our lfb1 diagnostic PCR target is able to provide epidemiologically relevant information, at least in a simple mammal
biodiversity context as in New Caledonia. This approach
was already proposed using another diagnostic PCR target, namely secY [9] that we also evaluated in our study.
Using direct sequencing of leptospirosis diagnostic PCR
products would partly offset the loss of epidemiological
information resulting from the increased use of PCR in
the early diagnosis of leptospirosis. This direct typing is
currently used in New Caledonia, to better identify the
different reservoirs of these Leptospira strains. The major
mammal species are currently being sampled, in order to
