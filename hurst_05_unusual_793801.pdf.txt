Abstract
Background: Prior to the sequencing of the human genome it was typically assumed that, tandem
duplication aside, gene order is for the most part random. Numerous observers, however,
highlighted instances in which a ligand was linked to one of its cognate receptors, with some
authors suggesting that this may be a general and/or functionally important pattern, possibly
associated with recombination modification between epistatically interacting loci. Here we ask
whether ligands are more closely linked to their receptors than expected by chance.
Results: We find no evidence that ligands are linked to their receptors more closely than expected
by chance. However, in the human genome there are approximately twice as many co-occurrences
of ligand and receptor on the same human chromosome as expected by chance. Although a weak
effect, the latter might be consistent with a past history of block duplication. Successful duplication
of some ligands, we hypothesise, is more likely if the cognate receptor is duplicated at the same
time, so ensuring appropriate titres of the two products.
Conclusion: While there is an excess of ligands and their receptors on the same human
chromosome, this cannot be accounted for by classical models of non-random gene order, as the
linkage of ligands/receptors is no closer than expected by chance. Alternative hypotheses for nonrandom gene order are hence worth considering.

Background
One of the most striking discoveries in the post-genomic
age has been the amount of non-random gene positioning
in eukaryotic genomes [1]. In the human genome, for
instance, highly/broadly expressed genes cluster [2-5].
Likewise in yeast co-expressed genes tend to reside
together [6] and such pairs tend also to be retained
together over evolutionary time more than expected,
given the intergene distance between them [7]. Blocks of
broadly expressed mammalian genes also seem to be pre-

served over evolutionary time more than expected [8]. In
Caenorhabditis [9-11], Drosophila [12-14] and Arabidopsis
[15], to name but three, there exists further evidence for
expression clusters of some variety. These results all suggest that eukaryotic genomes are organised in a manner
that permits co-expression or co-ordinate expression. Evidence also suggests linkage of functionally related genes,
although on this issue the evidence is more equivocal, not
least because of an ambiguity as to what "functionally
related" can mean. On the one hand, in numerous eukaryPage 1 of 12

otic genomes, genes from the same metabolic pathway
cluster more than expected by chance [16] (for detailed
case history see [17]). Likewise, linked co-expressed genes
in yeast often fall within the same MIPs (Munich Information Centre For Protein Sequences) category [6] or the
same Gene Ontology (GO) classification [18].
These results are so striking because they so profoundly
overturn the long held assumption that genes are randomly located around eukaryotic genomes. This is not to
say that possible exceptions were not considered prior to
the sequencing of the complete genome. They were, however, typically dismissed as being unrepresentative or
uninteresting either because they were clearly the product
of tandem duplication (hox cluster, globin cluster) or
were associated with weird genetics (imprinted clusters)
or genes that are otherwise exceptional (e.g. clustering of
rRNAs). Not all such suggestive examples could so easily
be dismissed however. Here we concentrate on one class,
linkage of ligands to their cognate receptors. This issue is
worth systematic analysis, not least because in yeast it has
recently been shown that genes whose proteins interact to
form stable complexes are linked more often than
expected by chance [19].
That ligands and their receptors may be linked was
observed independently by several workers. Cooper [20],
noting that the linkage of ligands to receptors may be
common, highlights the examples of transferrin and
transferrin receptor on chromosome 3q, as well as apolipoprotein E and the low density lipoprotein receptor both
on chromosome 19. He also rightly cautions, however,
than one can find numerous cases where ligands and
receptors are not linked. Similarly, Lennard et al. [21] note
the linkage of the three ligands in the interleukin 1 cluster
(IL1 alpha, beta and receptor antagonist) to the two receptors [21]. The linkage of ligands to receptors has even
proven to have some predictive power. Wang et al. [22]
noticed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its MET
receptor were both on 7q. Noting too the presence in
3p21 of both macrophage stimulating factor (MST1, a
member of the same gene family as HGF), and RON (a

member of the MET receptor family), they hypothesised
that RON might be MST1's receptor [22]. This, in turn,
they demonstrated to be the case (RON's alias is now
MST1R) [22]. Popovici et al. note several of the above
examples and also point to a total of 14 incidences of
linked genes involved in the same pathway, not necessarily as ligand-receptor couplings [23].
This evidence prompts two questions. First, is it true that
there is something odd about the linkage patterns of ligands and their cognate receptors? Second, if it is true, why
might this be so? Prior authors have also suggested that
linkage of ligands to receptors might be functionally
important. Haig [24], observing two of the above cases
(interleukin 1 and transferrin), notes that close proximity
could enable linkage disequilibrium between alleles at the
ligands and receptors. This linkage disequilibrium would
potentially enable the spread of rare allele combinations
for which there exist particular epistatic interactions.
These may, Haig suggests, act as selfish maternal effect
lethals, an example of which has been described in mice
[25,26]. This theory may be seen as a special case of a
more general theory for linkage based on preservation of
linkage disequilibrium under epistasis [27-30]. One
might also conjecture that ligands and receptors might at
times need to be co-expressed [see e.g. [31]], so very close
linkage might be beneficial for this reason as well.
If selection does act on the location of ligands and receptors (either to permit co-expression or to maintain linkage
disequilibrium), then we should predict, from the above
models, that when two such genes are on the same chromosome they should also be, on average, physically closer
than would be expected by chance. To this end we ask two
questions. First, is the mean distance between ligands and
their linked receptors shorter than expected by chance? As
this mode of analysis could miss an excess of cases with
very tight linkage, we additionally ask whether the
number of incidences of linkage within a given window
size (1 Mb, 2 Mb etc.) is higher than expected by chance.

by chance. In these simulations we permuted genes only
within the chromosomes within which they are found, so
as to ensure that the number of ligand-receptor pairs were
the same in the randomized sets as in the real data set. As
can be seen (Table 2) in neither data set do we find evidence for anything other than a pattern of random linkage
[see Additional file 4].

Results and discussion
No evidence for close proximity of ligands and receptors
If ligands and their cognate receptors were under selection
to be in close physical proximity, we should find that the
mean distance between them should be smaller than
expected by chance. To test this, we examined ligandreceptor pairs from the DLRP database [32,33]. All analyses were also performed for an augmented dataset, which
additionally contains two 'cherry-picked' cases highlighted by Cooper [20] (see Methods). Contrary to expectations, the mean distance between ligand and receptor in
the non-augmented data set (64.579 Mb) is higher than
that found in randomized genomes (56.344 Mb; P =
0.733). The same pattern is found in the augmented data
set (real = 63.466 Mb, randomized = 56.165 Mb, P =
0.709). Note that a ligand can have many receptors and
that this is factored into the analysis through the randomization protocol.

It may, however, be the case that there exist a number of
ligand-receptor pairs that are much closer to each other
than expected. To examine this we compared the number
of ligand-receptor pairs within some critical distance of
each other and compared this with the number expected

It has been previously established that broadly expressed
genes cluster [3,4]. Might our simulations have produced
misleading results by permitting genes of the ligands and
receptors to reside in any chromosomal location? To
examine this possibility we considered randomizations in
which genes are swapped exclusively with ones of the
same breadth of expression. None of the above results are
qualitatively affected (Table 3). Using a different bin size
to classify breadth of expression appears to have no effect
on the results (Table 3). Likewise, permitting ligands and
receptors to be located in the genome at the locations of
other ligands and receptors does not affect any conclusions [see Additional file 4].
The above results indicate that there is no evidence for
selection for clustering of ligand and receptor. For this reason we reject a model positing epistasis between alleles of
ligand and receptor as a general force acting on genomic
location of these genes. Moreover the lack of tight clustering suggests that we are not witnessing clustering to enable co-regulation (by ensuring that genes are co-localised
in the same chromatin block). The model suggested by
Haig [24] is not, however, necessarily falsified by the
above results, as he postulates selection on disequilibrium
only if the genes might be involved in maternal-foetal
interactions. Such a model is hard to falsify in the absence
of segregation/viability data from appropriate haplotypes.
However, we can note that if we further restrict our data
sets to those in which either the ligand or one of the receptors is placentally expressed, the qualitative patterns
described above are unaltered [see Additional file 4]. We
find, therefore, no evidence for close linkage of ligand and
receptor when involvement in maternal-foetal interactions might be a possibility.

ligand -receptor sets nominated by Cooper [20]. Bin size indicates the span of breadths of expression considered to be the same in the
randomizations. Bin size one implies that only genes of the same breadth were switched with each other. Distances are measured in

An excess of ligand-receptor pairs on the same human
chromosome
Above we asked whether ligands and their receptors are
more closely linked than expected by chance. We can also
ask if ligands and their receptors are more commonly
linked (i.e. on the same chromosome) than expected by
chance? In an unbiased unaugmented human data set (i.e.
without the addition of the two sets highlighted by
Cooper [20], see Methods) we observe 23 such pairings
but expect on average 13.71 (P = 0.015). When we include
the two extra sets the P value, as expected, is reduced: we
observe 25 pairs but expect on average 13.8 (P = 0.005).
These results support the view that in the human genome
linkage of a ligand to at least one of its cognate receptors
is more common than would be expected by chance.
However, the majority (approx 78%) of ligands are not
linked to any of their receptors, so this excess should not
be considered a strong rule (although, as already noted, in
special cases it has had predictive power).
No evidence for an excess of ligands-receptor pairs on the
same chromosome in mouse
To ask whether the patterns observed in the human
genome are also found in the mouse genome we constructed three mouse data sets and applied the three randomization protocols to each. The first two data sets are the
ortholog equivalents of our two human data sets purged
of duplicates by either a) Blasting or b) Blasting and
removal by physical proximity (in the human genome) of
ligands or receptors. That is, if two ligands were in close
proximity in the human genome, even if not identified as
sequence related, we would remove one before considering the location of the mouse orthologs. However, as it is
possible that some ligand clusters might be unique to
mouse, we additionally purged the more stringent of the
above two of any groupings of ligands or receptors seen in
the mouse genome.

As it happens, no matter which data set one employs or
which randomization method is performed, there is not
even a remote hint that ligands and cognate receptors
occur more commonly on the same mouse chromosome
than expected by chance [see Additional file 5]. For example, in the equivalent of the human data set purged of
duplicates by Blast alone, we observe 19 ligand-receptor
pairs on the same chromosome and expect 19.38 (P =
0.56) in a randomization in which the ligands and receptors can assume any genomic position currently associated with a gene. In this analysis the mean distance
between ligand and receptor is 57.3 Mb but is 43.4 in the
randomizations (P = 0.937). At no specified distance do
we find more pairs than expected by chance [see Additional file 5]. Controlling for breadth of expression makes
no difference to this conclusion [see Additional file 6].
The list of linked genes from the data set equivalent to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/62

human set presented in Table 1 is presented in Table 4. In
this set 16 ligand-receptor pairs co-occur on the same
chromosome, with 14.5 expected. Only four ligand-receptor pairs are in common in the two comparable data sets.
Explaining the data: interesting biology or statistical
artefact?
We find no evidence in mouse or man that ligands and
their receptors are more closely linked on average than
expected by chance. However, we do find that there are
more ligand-receptor pairs on the same human chromosome than expected, a feature not found in mouse. From
the above results we are faced with two possible explanations for the human data. First, that it is just a statistical
blip, possibly owing to some subtle bias in the original
data set (note for example, that MST1R was analysed as a
potential receptor because of its linkage to MST [22]). Second, that the excess of ligand-receptor pairs on the same
chromosome is the product of some deterministic force,
that for some reason does not apply, or is not strong
enough, in rodents. This might either be direct selection
favouring the persistence of co-occurrence or a deterministic bias in the creation of co-occurrence.

That the pattern is found in humans rather than mice
argues against a direct selective benefit for co-retention on
the same chromosome. This is owing to the fact that the
effective population size of the human population is most
probably much smaller than that of mice. As such, according to the nearly-neutral theory, the efficacy of selection
should be higher in mice (see also [34,35]). Hence, if the
pattern was owing to selection directly favouring cooccurrence, it is more likely to be observable in mouse
rather than human, all else being equal. Moreover, it is
also hard to see what direct selective benefit might accrue
from co-occurrence in weak linkage. In particular, co-regulation of ligands and receptors (which is not clearly
expected in the first place) would likely require much
tighter linkage than observed here. We also find no evidence for a stronger similarity in the breadth of expression
of the linked ligands and receptors than those on different
chromosomes. We considered the difference in breadth of
expression between ligand and receptor normalised by the
mean of the two. Linked genes are of no more similar
breadth of expression (mean difference for linked genes
0.75 +/- 0.12, for unlinked 0.686 +/- 0.036, t-test, P =
0.58).
Segmental duplication and the balance hypothesis: an
alternative hypothesis for non-random gene order
A notable feature of our data set is that there are numerous
cases in which a ligand-receptor pair in linkage is matched
by at least one other paralogous pair also in linkage. If we
define genes belonging to the same Hovergen [36] family
as paralogs, then we can identify the following linked par-

is linked to FGFR4 and to FGF1 and is sequence related to
FGF8 and FGF17.
It has been argued that co-paralogy of gene pairs involved
in the same pathway (of which ligand-receptor pairs are
but one example) appear to be unusually common [23].
This finding is also in accord with much recent evidence
suggesting that the human genome (and the vertebrate

being claimed to be the result of such duplication events:
FGFR 1, 2, 3 and 4 are in paralog clusters on human chromosomes 8p, 10q, 4p, and 5q respectively [38]; NOTCH
3 and 4 also appear to be in paralog clusters on chromosomes 6 and 19, with NOTCH 1 and NOTCH 2 being two
further duplications of the same block [39]; HGF/MST1
and MET/RON were also previously described as belonging
to
co-paralogous
groups
[23].

Following an earlier hypothesis [19], we would like to
suggest an hypothesis to explain our results that is based
on the occurrence of block duplications [40]. If some ligands and receptors require an appropriate balance in their
titres, then one could expect that a mutation resulting in a
block duplication containing one of the pair (e.g., the ligand) might be more likely to spread through the population if it also duplicates the other (e.g., the receptor). Such
co-duplication is most likely if ligand and receptor happen to be linked, while unlinked ligand-receptor pairs are
less likely to be successfully duplicated. Our hypothesis
may be considered as being a form of the balance hypothesis [41,42], which supposes that proteins involved in
mutual interactions need to have their titres appropriately
balanced. Direct evidence for this proposition has been
described in yeast, in which it is also reported that the
need for balance might explain the lack of duplicability of
the genes involved in complex formation [43].
This hypothesis appears tenable in the current context for
several reasons. It is, for example, suggestive that the paralogous pair sets tend to be more closely linked, although
the statistic is on the edge of significance (Median Test,
ChiSquared = 3.59, P = 0.058, df = 1). This would be
expected if constraints exist on the upper size limit of the
block duplications. It may also be notable that for the
many of the above genes there is evidence for dosage sensitivity, as required by the balance hypothesis (Table 5).
Moreover, as re-arrangements tends to be especially common in mice [44-46], any linked pairs possibly generated
by block duplication are more likely to be split up, making the genome more like random.
The above hypothesis also predicts that ligands and their
linked receptors might be duplicated at the same time.
While this can be approximately established by phylogenetic methods, these do not constitute a perfect test, as
they fail to establish whether the pairs were duplicated in
a block together and furthermore, genes known to be coduplicated are very commonly not identified as such by
phylogenetic methods [47]. Nonetheless, we have surveyed the available data and prior analyses and fail to find
any data that contradicts the hypothesis that when a given
receptor duplicated the relevant ligand did as well [see
Additional file 7]. The ligands FGF1 and FGF18 are, however, probably the result of an ancient duplication that
occurred independent of the receptor [48].
In some of the incidences reported here, a case for coduplication has already been made. The linkage of the
FGFs to their receptors has previously been argued, from
phylogenetic data, to be owing to block or whole genome
duplications [48]. This view is supported by our inspection of the phylogenetic tree of the FGFR family as presented in Hovergen [36], which suggests that at the base

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/62

of the vertebrates there was one receptor which duplicated
to produce the ancestors of FGFR1/2 and FGFR3/4. Duplication of both ancestral sequences then occurred very
shortly after (prior to the divergence of the fish), leaving
FGFR1 and FGFR2 as nearest paralogs, and FRGR3 and
FGFR4 as nearest paralogs. If there was co-duplication of
the receptors, we should expect to see FGF1 and FGF2 as
nearest paralogs and FRF8 and FGF17 as nearest paralogs,
with, in both incidences, duplication occurring near the
base of the vertebrates. The nearest paralog relationships
are indeed upheld [48]. Furthermore, in both instances
the duplication occurred prior to the divergence of fish, as
predicted.

Conclusion
In sum, we have described a novel pattern of co-localisation on the same chromosome of genes whose products
interact, which cannot obviously be accounted for either
by known models for co-ordinate regulation, nor by selection for linkage disequilibrium. The pattern may in part
reflect a past history of block duplication. A version of the
balance hypothesis is worth considering as underpinning
to explain the results.
Tests of this hypothesis should be possible in the future.
We should in principle be able, with fuller knowledge of
gene order in many mammals, to reconstruct the past history of duplication and gene order re-arrangements that
occurred through mammalian history. The model predicts
an excess of block duplications in which both ligand and
cognate receptor are found, as well as excess in which neither are found, but a dearth of those with one, but not the
other. The model also predicts a general weakening of this
initial signal with increasing numbers of inter-chromosomal re-arrangements, as the hypothesis proposes only
an initial filter of block duplications, not ongoing direct
selection to maintain linkage.

Methods
Data set assembly and curation
The table of ligand-receptor partners were extracted from
the DLRP database [32,33]. This specifies for any given
single ligand the corresponding receptor or set of receptors. The genes here are referred to by gene name and Unigene id number, by reference to an old release of Unigene.
These entries we updated to the current release for Homo
sapiens, UniGene Build #175. For each Unigene number
and gene name, the relevant Unigene page was identified
[49]. If the entry remained in the new build all details
were left unchanged, except in three cases where there
exists a gene by the same name as that in the original dataset, at the same genomic location as the given Unigene
entry, but in a separate Unigene class. In these cases the
Unigene entry with matching name was employed. If the
old entry had been retired then a) if only one new entry is

*Note: These five genes are known to be associated with human autosomal dominant disorders. Searching OMIM [70] for mapped genes with
"autosomal dominant" somewhere in the title or the text and not "recessive" in the title, reveals an estimate of 1166 mapped genes which may be
associated with autosomal dominant disorders. Assuming 22470 autosomal genes (as in the NC files) we should then have expected from a random
sample of 17 autosomal genes less than one dominant, significantly less than observed (Chi-squared, P < 0.0001). However, in some cases the
dominance is owing to negative mutations rather than dose per se.

available this was used, b) if multiple entries were found
(i.e. the cluster has split), then the one with the gene name
identical to that of the old entry was used, c) if no entry
had the same name but all entries were at the same
genomic location the entry with the most abundant
sequence data was used, d) if no unambiguous match
could be found the entry was eliminated. If this was the
ligand then the whole entry was deleted. In a few cases
separate ligand receptor blocks are collapsed to the same
Unigene entry in build #175 (e.g. FGFR and FGFRB). In
this instance one of the two sets was eliminated. The original file also contains a number of entries in which the ligand alone is given, with no receptor. In these cases the
entry was deleted.
From this new set of Unigene identities Entrez gene [50]
was searched with the current Unigene id being posted.
From here we recovered a) the Entrez/LocusLink gene
name b) the Entrez/LocusLink id. If the LocusLink/Entrez
gene name was different from the Unigene name then the
pairs were examined at LocusLink to determine that the
names were synonymous. In all cases this proved to be so.
From here we obtained the physical location in the NC
Genbank files for each chromosome. The cDNA source

annotation of each Unigene entry was employed to determine whether the gene was placentally expressed.
The data set does not include the two cases highlighted by
Cooper [20]: transferrin and its receptor and apolipoprotein E and its receptor. We therefore consider a second
data set in which we add these two. This is, however, problematic as we are adding only "cherry picked" data. It is
thus much more likely that we should find close linkage
in the expanded set compared with the original set, owing
to the non-random nature of the addition to the data set.
Nonetheless, should we find an absence of an effect in this
expanded set, this would make for stronger evidence
against the hypothesis of an over-abundance of close linkage of ligands and their receptors.
The set so defined has numerous clusters of sequencerelated ligands and receptors. Such clusters are likely to
have arisen from tandem gene duplications, and thus
individual genes cannot be treated as independently positioned. To eliminate the effects of tandem duplication we
perform an all versus all blast (with E < 0.01) of the coding sequences defined from the RefSeqs for each gene. For
each pair of putative duplicates on the same chromosome

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:62

one of the two was randomly selected to be removed. In a
tandem cluster with more than two duplicates only one
gene was considered. Using E < 0.2 resolves to the same
data
set.
With this approach, however, a few well described duplicate clusters are not identified. For example, there remain
6 ligand-receptor pairs associated with the 2q14 cluster of
three ligands (IL1 alpha, beta and the receptor antagonist)
and their two receptors (IL1R1 and Il1R2) in 2q12. However, while Blast fails to reveal either of these clusters as
duplicate clusters, this contradicts the conventional wisdom, based on close analysis of gene structure, function
and conserved functional parts, that they are both duplicate arrays [51,52]. The problem in this instance is most
probably that interleukins and their receptors tend often
to be fast evolving, hence liable to avoid detection as
duplicates unless they are relatively modern duplicates.
Indeed this inability of Blast to identify orthology/paralogy of fast evolving genes has recently been well demonstrated [53].
To eliminate such problems we additionally remove one
of a pair of ligands within 1 Mb of each other. Likewise we
remove one of a pair of receptors should the receptors
occur within 1 Mb of each other. In nearly all cases the ligands in the cluster also bind the same receptors and vice
versa. One exception is Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2)
and Insulin, which, while sequence related and very
closely linked, bind different receptors. In both cases the
receptors are unlinked. Given the sequence relatedness we
remove one of the two. In effect we are then asking about
a tendency for a ligand cluster to be linked to a receptor
cluster. The final data set specifies 108 ligand-receptor sets
(106 in the non-augmented set) [see Additional file 1].
Note that most ligands have more than one receptor.
When then we refer to ligand receptor "pairs," we refer to
incidence in which a ligand is linked to one of its receptors. We also performed the same analyses as given below
on a data set in which duplicates are defined exclusively
by reference to Blast scores [see Additional file 2]. A list of
linked ligands and receptors in this data are provided [see
Additional file 3]. Using both data sets, in both augmented and non-augmented form (i.e. with or without
the two ligand-receptor pairs highlighted by Copper
(1999)) we obtain qualitatively identical results [see
Additional file 4].
Mouse data
For analysis of the patterns in mice we identified the
orthologs of the human ligands and receptors by reference
to the MGI curated set of mouse-human orthologs [54].
For each human gene, the locus link id was cross referenced to the mouse ortholog. Thirteen genes lacking an
ortholog were removed. Mouse locus link numbers were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/62

employed to access RefSeq numbers, unigene references
and the chromosomal locations. Breadth of expression
was derived from Unigene cDNA source annotations. The
compilation of all mouse genes and their position used in
the randomization was derived from MartView [55] at
Ensembl requesting those with described LocusLink ids.
The positions of the ligands and receptors were found by
cross-referencing their LocusLink ids to this Ensembl data
set. The few that failed to be resolved by this method were
ascribed a position by Blasting their RefSeq against the
complete mouse genome [55]. For the randomizations
only those genes with well resolved genomic locations
were employed (24742 genes).
Randomization and statistics
To ask whether there are more ligand-receptor pairs on the
same chromosome than expected by chance, we calculate
the observed number and compare this with simulants in
which we randomly permute the positions of all ligands
and receptors. It is unclear on a priori grounds, however,
what should be the null model for the randomization. We
consider three possible models.

First we suppose that a ligand or receptor can occur in any
location in the genome currently occupied by a protein
coding gene. In this instance, in the human genome, the
positions permitted in the randomizations correspond to
the annotated positions of the 24,300 protein coding
genes in the NC_0000n files for the human genome (n
from 01–23).
Second, we assume that a ligand or receptor can occur in
any location in the genome currently occupied by a protein coding gene with the same or comparable expression
breadth. For each of the genes in the complete human and
mouse sets we identified the Unigene id by following the
LocusLink page pertinent to each gene and identified the
breadth of expression in the same way as for the ligandreceptor set. Genes were placed in bins of 0–4, 5–9 tissues
etc in which they were expressed. We consider two bin
classification systems. In both, ligands and receptors in
these randomizations were permitted to reside in the
same location as any gene in the same bin from the complete human set.
Third, we suppose that there is something unique about
ligands and receptors, such that each ligand or receptor
can only be relocated to the position of another ligand or
receptor. Breadth of expression is ignored as this too
greatly
constrains
the
randomizations.
For each of the above randomization protocols we determined the number of ligand-receptor pairs on the same
chromosome. Significance (P) was determined from P =
(r+1)/(n+1), where r is the number of simulants with the

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2005, 5:62

same or greater number of ligand-receptor pairs than
observed in the real data and n is the number of simulants
(10,000 in all instances), this being the unbiased estimator [56,57].
To determine whether the ligand-receptor pairs that we
observe on a given chromosome are more closely linked
than expected we perform two analogous sets of simulations. In the first we calculate the mean distance between
these pairs and compare this with the mean of the simulants described above. In the second we ask about the
number of ligand-receptor pairs within a given distance of
each other (e.g., within 1 Mb). We then compare this
number to the mean number found after permuting all
genes within the chromosomes within which they are
found. By permuting on the same chromosome we control for the number of ligand-receptor pairs on the same
chromosome.
All results prove to be insensitive to which of the three
randomization null models is employed. Unless stated
otherwise a result in the text relates to the first model in
the text. All results can be found in attached files, for
humans [see Additional file 4] and for mice [see Additional file 5] [see Additional file 6].

Supplement 4: The results and analysis of randomizations, excluding randomizations controlling for breadth. The results sheet is split in two. The
top half ("all genes") refers to analysis of the augmented ligand receptor
data set, i.e. the one containing the two ligand-receptor pairs nominated
by Cooper. The lower half excludes these two. In each, as detailed in the
methods, two filtering methods were used to eliminate tandem duplicates:
Blast alone (see Additional file 2) and blast plus close proximity of ligands, close proximity of receptors (see Additional file 1). Within each of
these subdivisions two data sets were employed to determine where, in randomizations, a ligand and/or receptor might locate. In one case (lig/rec
genes only), the positions of ligands and receptors were interchanged with
ligands/receptors derived from the test set. In the second method, possible
locations are anywhere in the genome where a gene, of any variety, resides
("all genes in genome"). Randomizations for each of the analysis in turn
was performed either permitting a ligand or receptor to locate anywhere in
the genome ("all genes") or anywhere on the same chromosome ("within
chr"). Analysis was further performed on those ligand receptor sets in
which at least one of the genes in the set was placentally expressed ("placental"). N is the number of genes in the test set, "sameChr", refers to the
number of incidences of ligand receptor pairs on the same chromosome,
"sameChrRand"", is the corresponding number for the randomizations.
P_chr is the P value for the comparisons. <d> is the mean distance
between ligands and receptors on the same chromosome (in kb) and
<dRand> the corresponding number in the randomizations. P_d is the relevant P value. "Count[Nkb]", "countRand, P refer to the number of incidences in the real data set of ligand receptor pairs less than N kb apart,
the number in the randomizations and the P value. This statistic is only
relevant for the cases where randomization is done within chromosomes.
The between chromosome randomization by its nature confounds the
effect of the excess of pairs on the same chromosome as well as their proximity.
