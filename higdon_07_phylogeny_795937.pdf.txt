Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic comparative methods are often improved by complete phylogenies with meaningful branch
lengths (e.g., divergence dates). This study presents a dated molecular supertree for all 34 world pinniped species derived
from a weighted matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) supertree analysis of 50 gene trees, each determined
under a maximum likelihood (ML) framework. Divergence times were determined by mapping the same sequence data
(plus two additional genes) on to the supertree topology and calibrating the ML branch lengths against a range of fossil
calibrations. We assessed the sensitivity of our supertree topology in two ways: 1) a second supertree with all mtDNA
genes combined into a single source tree, and 2) likelihood-based supermatrix analyses. Divergence dates were also
calculated using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock with rate autocorrelation to test the sensitivity of our supertree
results further.
Results: The resulting phylogenies all agreed broadly with recent molecular studies, in particular supporting the
monophyly of Phocidae, Otariidae, and the two phocid subfamilies, as well as an Odobenidae + Otariidae sister
relationship; areas of disagreement were limited to four more poorly supported regions. Neither the supertree nor
supermatrix analyses supported the monophyly of the two traditional otariid subfamilies, supporting suggestions for the
need for taxonomic revision in this group. Phocid relationships were similar to other recent studies and deeper branches
were generally well-resolved. Halichoerus grypus was nested within a paraphyletic Pusa, although relationships within
Phocina tend to be poorly supported. Divergence date estimates for the supertree were in good agreement with other
studies and the available fossil record; however, the Bayesian relaxed molecular clock divergence date estimates were
significantly older.
Conclusion: Our results join other recent studies and highlight the need for a re-evaluation of pinniped taxonomy,
especially as regards the subfamilial classification of otariids and the generic nomenclature of Phocina. Even with the
recent publication of new sequence data, the available genetic sequence information for several species, particularly those
in Arctocephalus, remains very limited, especially for nuclear markers. However, resolution of parts of the tree will
probably remain difficult, even with additional data, due to apparent rapid radiations. Our study addresses the lack of a
recent pinniped phylogeny that includes all species and robust divergence dates for all nodes, and will therefore prove
indispensable to comparative and macroevolutionary studies of this group of carnivores.

Background
The pinnipeds are a monophyletic group of aquatic carnivores most closely related to either mustelids or ursids.
The three monophyletic families – Phocidae (earless or
true seals), Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals), and Odobenidae (one extant species of walrus) last shared a common
ancestor within arctoid carnivores > 25 million years ago
(mya) [1,2]. Some morphological studies [3,4] and virtually all molecular studies [e.g., [5-15]] support a link
between otariids and odobenids (Otarioidea). However,
several morphologists prefer a phocid-odobenid clade
(e.g. [2,16-18]).
There are 34 extant species of pinniped, including Monachus tropicalis (which is widely believed to have gone
extinct recently) and treating Zalophus as being monotypic
(Z. californianus) (Table 1). The family Phocidae contains
19 species in two subfamilies: Monachinae or "southern"
hemisphere seals (nine species comprising Antarctic, elephant, and monk seals) and Phocinae or "northern" hemisphere seals (10 species that inhabit the Arctic and subArctic) [19]. Some authors have questioned the monophyly of Monachinae [20-22], although recent studies
have shown this subfamily to be monophyletic
[4,11,14,15,23,24]. The monophyly of Phocinae has not
been questioned since being established by King [25];
however, there remains considerable debate over intergroup relationships, especially within Phocina (reviewed
by [11,26]). The family Otariidae contains 14 extant species that have been divided traditionally into the subfamilies Arctocephalinae (fur seals) and Otariinae (sea
lions) (e.g. [27,28]). Early suggestions that this subfamilial classification might be incorrect (e.g. [29]) have
received increasing support from recent molecular analyses [12,14,15,30-32]. Taken together with a number of
reports of both interspecific and intergeneric hybrids
within Otariidae (e.g. [19,33,34]), a reassessment of otariid taxonomy based on additional phylogenetic evidence
is needed. Brunner [31] provides an extensive review of
the history of otariid classification. Finally, Odobenidae
today comprises only the single species of walrus, Odobenus rosmarus.
Several recent genetic studies [11,12,14,15,24,26,32] have
advanced our knowledge of relationships within Pinnipedia considerably. Unfortunately, many of these (the
exceptions being [14,24,26]) did not include divergencedate estimates as required for some types of macroevolutionary studies and phylogenetic comparative analyses. In
addition, none included all species. The only study to
include divergence-date estimates for all extant pinnipeds
was that of Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] as a part of a larger
carnivore supertree. This tree has been used extensively in
comparative studies of carnivores in general (e.g., [3542]) and pinnipeds in particular (e.g., [43-47]). However,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/216

it remains that the carnivore supertree is nearly a decade
old and might no longer reflect current phylogenetic
opinion.
Our objective is to address the lack of a recent phylogenetic study that includes all extant pinniped species and to
provide date estimates for all nodes. To accomplish this
task, we used the supertree method matrix representation
with parsimony (MRP, [48,49]) to derive a complete phylogeny of the group from 50 gene trees (with mtDNA
markers analyzed either individually or combined as a
single source tree), with corresponding maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (BI) analyses of the concatenated supermatrix serving as a form of topological
sensitivity analysis in a global congruence framework
[50]. Divergence dates within the supertree topology were
estimated using 52 genes calibrated with eight robust fossil dates using two different methods. Together, the use of
a larger data set focussed exclusively on the pinnipeds
should yield both a more accurate topology and divergence dates than those present in the global carnivore
supertree of Bininda-Emonds et al. [23].

Results and Discussion
General structure of the supertree
Our preferred hypothesis of pinniped evolution is that
derived from the molecular supertree with all genes analyzed individually (Fig. 1; see Methods). It agrees broadly
with other recent studies (e.g., [10-15,23,24,26,32]). In
particular, the monophyly of each of Pinnipedia, Otarioidea, Phocidae, Otariidae, and the two phocid subfamilies
was supported. Many of these nodes are among the most
strongly supported in the supertree. The high level of congruence across numerous studies using different data
sources and methodologies would suggest that higherlevel pinniped relationships are well resolved. However,
many relationships closer to the tips of the tree, particularly those within each of Arctocephalus and Phocina,
remain contentious.

Support values within the supertree (Table 2) were generally much higher than values typically reported for the
supertree-specific support measure rQS (see [51,52]),
with an average rQS value (± SD) across the tree of 0.234
± 0.214. As such, most nodes are directly supported by a
majority of the 50 source trees containing all the relevant
taxa. The only exception is the node comprising Halichoerus grypus, Pusa caspica and Pusa sibirica, which has a
slightly negative rQS value (-0.040). Even so, all more
inclusive nodes possess positive rQS values, indicating
that the conflict has more to do with the exact placement
of Halichoerus within Pusa rather than the placement of it
within this genus per se.

Alternative analyses of the molecular data set (supertree
analysis with all mtDNA forming a single source tree or
ML or BI analyses of the combined supermatrix; Figures 2
and 3, respectively) yield topologies that agree broadly
with that in Figure 1. The rQs support measure across the
supertree (0.18 ± 0.11) again showed that most nodes are
directly supported by a majority of the 12 source trees
containing all the relevant taxa. In all cases, the changes

occur in parts of the tree with noticeably weaker support
and/or branch lengths, indicating general regions of
uncertainty: 1) Neophoca cinerea nests deeper within otariids, either as the sister taxon to Phocarctos hookeri (ML) or
to the clade comprising the genera Arctocephalus, Otaria,
and Phocarctos (BI), or forms the sister taxon to Callorhinus
ursinus (supertree); 2) the formation of a sister-group relationship between Otaria byronia and Arctocephalus pusillus,

which were previously adjacent to one another (all analyses); 3) the clades (Arctocephalus townsendii + A. phillippi)
and (A. gazella + A. tropicalis) trade places (all analyses);
and 4) changes to the internal relationships of Phocina,
either with Halichoerus grypus and Pusa caspica being
pulled basally with respect to the remainder of the group,
with Halichoerus forming the sister group to the remaining
species (ML), or with Pusa hispida and the clade of Histriophoca fasciata and Pagophilus groenlandicus nesting deeper
within the group (BI), or with Pusa hispida moving inside
P. sibirica and with a polytomy at the base of Phocini
(supertree).
In the supertree, nodes 1 and 2 (see Fig. 1) represent the
divergences of the canid and ursid lineages, respectively,
and nodes 3 to 35 represent the various pinniped divergences. The total sample size (molecular and fossil date
estimates) underlying the divergence times for each node
ranged from 0 (node 35 – the split between Monachus
schauinslandi and M. tropicalis, where the date was interpolated using a constant birth model) to 27 (Table 2). Over
half (19) of the pinniped nodes were dated using at least
12 separate estimates. The remaining 14 nodes were dated
by five or fewer estimates. Ten of these 14 nodes relate to
otariid relationships, and seven concern Arctocephalus spe-

cies. Divergences within the Pusa + Halichoerus clade were
also dated by a comparatively small number of estimates.
However, no obvious relationship existed between the
variability in a date estimate (given by the coefficient of
variation, CV) and the number of estimates it was derived
from (R2 = 0.02, P = 0.4849, df = 26).
Our inferred relDate dates for the supertree topology (see
Methods) are also significantly correlated with those for
comparable nodes (which are restricted largely to Phocidae) in the two major studies to estimate divergence times
within pinnipeds, those of Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] (R2
= 0.52, P = 0.004) and Arnason et al. [14] (R2 = 0.958, P <
0.0001) (df = 12 in both cases using ln-transformed values). However, whereas our dates did not differ significantly from those of Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] (paired-t
of ln-transformed values = -1.36, P = 0.197; df = 13), they
were significantly more recent than those of Arnason et al.
[14] (paired-t of ln-transformed values = -9.82, P <
0.0001; df = 13), probably reflecting their use of a only
single and more distant calibration point (the caniformfeliform split at 52 mya) as well as topological differences
between the trees and different methodologies used to
derive the dates.

Node numbers correspond to Figure 1. Dates and 95% confidence intervals are in millions of years ago, with the latter applying to the input dates
only. Fossil dates correspond to those listed in Table 5 and act as constraints on the minimum divergence time for the node in question. The date for
node 35 was interpolated according to a constant birth model (see Methods). Support values for each node, as measured by rQS [51, 52] are also
provided.

Both sets of multidivtime divergence dates (Table 3) are
significantly different from the relDate divergence dates
(paired-t of ln-transformed values = -11.39, P < 0.0001; df
= 32, for relDate versus multidivtime all genes; paired-t of
ln-transformed values = -4.53, P < 0.0001; df = 32, for relDate versus multidivtime mtDNA only). The supertree
(relDate) divergence dates underestimate the multidivtime dates from all genes and mtDNA genes by 88% and
51% on average, respectively. With respect to confidence
intervals (CIs), only 9 and 7 (of 33) of the relDate dates
fall into the range provided by the multidivtime CIs for
mtDNA or all genes, respectively. Conversely, only 3 and
4 (of 33) dates for all genes and mtDNA only, respectively,

fall within the CIs of the relDate dates. However, it is
important to note that the two sets of multidivtime dates
themselves are also significantly different from one
another (paired-t of ln-transformed values = 2.36, P =
0.02; df = 32). In the following sections, we compare both
sets of divergence dates (i.e., the relDate and multidivtime
dates) with those from the fossil record and other studies.
Origins of major pinniped groups
The split between ursids and pinnipeds is estimated to be
35.7 ± 2.63 (= mean ± SE) mya (relDate, Table 2; the
multidivtime dates for this node were similar (Table 3)),
although this should not be taken to imply that ursids are

the closest living relatives of pinnipeds among arctoid carnivores. Early pinnipeds (pinnipedimorphs) are held to
have originated in the North Pacific during the late Oligocene (34-24 mya) ([2,22,45,53], but see [14], who speculate on an origin on the southern shores of North
America), which is consistent with our estimate. Thereafter, a substantial lag is apparent, with the basal pinniped
split between Phocidae and Otarioidea occurring some 12
million years later at 23.0 ± 1.36 mya (Table 2) (ca. 26
mya with multidivtime, Table 3). Both values are more
recent than the 28.1 mya and 33.0 mya estimates
obtained by Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] and Arnason et al.
[14], respectively.
Odobenidae includes a single extant species and at least
20 fossil species in 14 genera [2], with the most basal taxa
known from the late early Miocene (ca. 21-16 mya).
Deméré et al. [2] suggest that odobenoids first evolved in
the North Pacific region sometime before 18 mya (late
early Miocene), and our data indicate the upper bound to

be 20.8 mya. The multidivtime dates were similar at ca. 21
mya. Both values are substantially older than the 14.2
mya estimate obtained by Bininda-Emonds et al. [23], but
younger than the 26.0 mya estimate of Arnason et al. [14].
Modern fur seals and sea lions are thought to have
evolved from the ancestral family Enaliarctidae ca. 11 mya
[54-56], with our data showing that the diversification of
the crown group occurred shortly thereafter at 8.2 ± 2.09
mya (the dates estimated using multidivtime were again
older, ca. 11 mya). Arnason et al. [14] consider the late
Oligocene Enaliarctinae [57] to be the oldest otarioid lineage so far described (25–27 mya; [58]). However,
Deméré et al. [2] consider this group to be early pinnipedimorphs that originated before the evolution of the modern crown-group pinnipeds.
The first phocid fossils date from the middle Miocene (ca.
16-14 mya) (but see [59,60]) in the North Atlantic [61],

over a North Pacific origin. Koretsky and Sanders [59,60]
recently described the "Oligocene seal" from the late Oligocene (ca. 28 mya) in South Carolina as the oldest
known true seal, a fossil that predates our estimate for the
basal-most split in all pinnipeds. However, because this
new description was based on a very small sample (two
partial femora), and because Deméré et al. [2] noted that
its stratigraphic provenience may be in question, we
instead used 23 mya as a conservative fossil calibration
point for the split between Phocidae and Otarioidea.
Obviously, acceptance of the "Oligocene seal" as the oldest known phocid (and therefore crown-group pinniped)
would cause all divergence times within the pinnipeds to
be older than the ones that we report.

Otariidae
Phylogeny
The supertree resolved Callorhinus ursinus as sister to all
remaining otariids (as is now generally accepted [1214,23,32]), with neither the sea lions nor Arctocephalus
forming clades. The five sea lion genera were generally
positioned basally to the various Arctocephalus species.
The exception was Phocarctos (and possibly Otaria in the
supermatrix analyses), which nested within Arctocephalus.
Wynen et al. [32] also reconstructed Neophoca as being the
next otariid species to diverge (contra the supermatrix
results) and found Zalophus + Eumetopias to form the sister
clade to the remaining forms (Arctocephalus, Otaria and
Phocarctos). These results add to the already large body of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:216

evidence, both molecular and morphological, that subfamilial descriptions in Otariidae, traditionally based on the
single character of presence or absence of underfur, are
incorrect [7,12,14,15,30-32,53,63]. However, resolution
of most of the more inclusive otariid clades remains problematic [14,15,32], especially the relationships among the
various Arctocephalus species, and the placements of the A.
australis + A. forsteri + A. galapagoensis and A. philippii + A.
townsendi clades in particular. The likelihood-based supermatrix analyses reinforce the generally weak or conflicting
phylogenetic signal in the data set for otariids, with both
suggesting what is to our knowledge a novel, more nested
position for Neophoca (although the inferred location differs between the analyses).
The supertree resolved A. forsteri as the sister to A. australis
+ A. galapagoensis, with all three as sister to an A. gazella +
A. tropicalis clade, an arrangement with relatively moderate support (Table 2). Wynen et al. [32] found a similar
result, placing A. gazella as sister to the A. australis + A. forsteri + A. galapagoensis clade, but placed A. tropicalis as sister to A. pusillus on a more basal branch separate from
other arctocephaline species. Our results also support a
polyphyletic Arctocephalus, but with A. pusillus as the separate lineage. The separation of A. pusillus from other Arctocephalus species (and possible pairing with Otaria as found
in both the supermatrix analyses and the combined
mtDNA supertree) is perhaps not unexpected in hindsight, given that this species has long been considered as
having an 'enigmatic taxonomic position' due to its similarity to sea lions in size, skull morphology, and behaviour [64-66].
Several authors [31,32] have recently questioned the status of A. philippii and A. townsendi as separate species (also
see [67,68]). Brunner [31] went so far as to suggest that
both taxa be removed from Arctocephalus to form subspecies in the previously described genus Arctophoca (Arctophoca philippii philippii and A. p. townsendi [69]). Our
results are equivocal on this latter issue, given that these
two taxa do form part of the main clade of Arctocephalus,
but as sister to the remaining species. The two taxa, however, are indicated to have diverged from one another earlier (0.3 mya; relDate date) than other another pair of
undisputed Arctocephalus species (namely A. gazella and A.
tropicalis at 0.1 mya), a potential argument in favour of
them retaining separate species status (regardless of the
generic appellation).
The close genetic relationship we found between A. australis, A. forsteri and A. galapagoensis (also [32]) is also congruent with the morphometric results of Brunner [31],
who suggested that A. galapagoensis be considered a subspecies of A. australis (as per [66,67]). Again, the relatively

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/216

long divergence time between these two taxa (0.7 mya;
relDate date) could argue against this arrangement.
Ultimately, relationships within Arctocephalus remain
poorly resolved with little agreement between different
studies or, as shown in this study, even different analyses
of the same base data set. This situation will likely remain
at least until additional genes for these taxa are sequenced.
We would note that the relationships and divergence
times within Arctocephalus presented here are based on the
only genetic marker available at the time data were
extracted from GenBank (MT-CYB sequences [32]). Additional genetic sequences for these species are desperately
required (but see [14,15]).
Divergence dates
The only recent studies to estimate divergence dates for
otariids are those of Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] and Arnason et al. [14]. Here, we compare our estimates to those
two studies and the available fossil record, which is unfortunately limited. Our relDate estimate of 8.2 ± 2.09 mya
for the root of the otariid crown-group is younger than
other recent estimates [14,23]. The multidivtime dates
(ca. 11–12 mya) agree well with Bininda-Emonds et al.
[23], but are still younger than that estimated by Arnason
et al. [14]. Thereafter, a series of rapid divergences are
inferred to have occurred. The origin of Neophoca was estimated at 6.1 mya based on MT-CYB only (ca. 10 mya
using multidivtime), followed by the initial radiation of
the remaining species at 5.2 ± 1.09 mya (ca. 9 mya using
multidivtime), and the origins of Otaria at 4.5 ± 0.21 mya
and Arctocephalus pusillus at 4.3 mya (the latter, again,
based only on MT-CYB; both divergences ca. 7 mya in the
multidivtime analyses). The oldest known record for the
southern hemisphere otariids is established by Hydrarctos
lomasiensis from the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene (<
3.4 mya, [70,71]). Fossils from California and Japan suggest that sea lions did not diversify until ca. 3 mya
[55,56,72]; however, only the late Pleistocene occurrences
(< 0.8 mya) of Otaria bryonia [73] and Neophoca palatine
[74] are considered reliable at present [2]. Our date for the
origin of the lineage leading to Otaria as a whole is naturally much older than this and almost three times older
than that in Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] (which places
Otaria in a very different position). Arnason et al. [14]
estimated an older divergence time, but also based on a
different phylogeny. We infer Phocarctos to have split from
the remaining Arctocephalus species 3.4 ± 0.34 mya.
Finally, the divergence between Eumetopias and Zalophus
was dated as 4.5 ± 0.37 mya, which is considerably older
that the earliest known fossils (Pleistocene, 1.64-0.79 mya
[56]), but younger than the 8 mya estimate of Arnason et
al. [14] (which is still older than the multidivtime estimate of ca. 6 mya).

Our results similarly indicate a rapid radiation within Arctocephalus, with many species originating within the past 1
million years (both dating methods, Tables 2, 3). Overall,
the date estimates showed reasonable levels of variation
(relDate median CV of 27.5), although some were highly
variable. For example, the split between the clades A.
gazella + A. tropicalis and A. australis + A. forsteri + A. galapagoensis had a final date estimate of 3.1 mya but a large
SE (3.43 my) and 95% confidence intervals on the input
date (-2.76–10.68 mya), possibly reflecting weak signal in
this area of the tree (see sensitivity analyses). Arctocephaline species are known in the fossil record only from
poorly documented records of A. pusillus and A. townsendi
from the Pleistocene (< 0.8 mya) [29]. The origin of Arctocephalus + Phocarctos hookeri was estimated here using MTCYB data at 4.3 mya, which is younger than other recent
estimates based on different topologies [14,23]. Although
our results lend support to previous suggestions [2,32]
that both sea lions and Arctocephalus underwent recent
periods of rapid radiation, all the evidence to date tend to
be based on a small dataset for most species.
Phocidae
Phylogeny
Compared to otariids, phocid relationships are generally
much more agreed upon. The traditional and wellaccepted phocid subfamilies Monachinae and Phocinae
were both recovered as monophyletic in the supertree and
supermatrix analyses (also see [4,11-15,23,26]). Erignathus barbatus was sister to the remaining northern phocids, followed by Cystophora cristata. The next branch of the
tree separated Pagophilus groenlandicus and Histriophoca
fasciata (= Histriophocina) as the sister group to the
remaining taxa (but note the differences in the alternative
supertree and the BI supermatrix). Most recent studies
[11-15,23,26] have found support for this arrangement
among the early branches (i.e., involving the lineages Erignathus, Cystophora, and Histriophocina). Of the six Pusa,
Phoca, and Halichoerus species (= Phocina), in the preferred tree Pusa hispida was found to be sister to the
remaining species in which Phoca vitulina + Phoca largha
formed the sister clade to (Pusa sibirica + (Halichoerus +
Pusa caspica)) (again note the alternative arrangements in
Figures 2 and 3, indicating poor signal in this part of the
pinniped phylogeny). The sister-group relationship
between Phoca vitulina and P. largha recovered here in all
analyses is consistent among and well supported in
numerous studies based on diverse data types [4,1115,23,26], and reflects early suggestions that the latter species represents a subspecies of the former [68,75].

Arguably the biggest outstanding problem in phocid phylogeny concerns the placement of Halichoerus within
Phocina, and there have been long-standing suggestions
(e.g., [76]) for taxonomic revision of these taxa. Both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/216

Davis et al. [11] and Delisle and Strobeck [12] found the
strongest support for Halichoerus as sister to Pusa, with
both being sister to Phoca. However, both studies included
only Pusa hispida as an exemplar for Pusa. Fulton and
Strobeck [15] also recovered a similar result, but did not
include Pusa sibirica. Four recent studies have included all
three Pusa species [4,14,23,26]. Bininda-Emonds and Russell [4] recovered Halichoerus as sister to Erignathus + Histriophocina + the remaining Phocina using
morphological data. Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] resolved
an unresolved Pusa as sister to the two Phoca species in
their supertree, with Halichoerus being sister to this clade.
The molecular results of Arnason et al. [14] and Palo and
Väinölä [26] were similar to ours, indicating weak support
for a P. caspica + H. grypus clade, and for a basal position
for P. hispida within Phocina. Although the precise interrelationships of the species differ slightly, our results support the suggestions of these other recent studies that both
Halichoerus and Pusa be included within a redefined
Phoca, possibly as subgenera. In fact, Arnason et al. [6]
suggested recently that the scientific name for the grey seal
be Phoca grypa. This solution also works in light of the
continuing uncertainty concerning interrelationships
within Phocina (compare Figures 1, 2, and 3 and these
with the references above), especially the increasing
number of suggestions that Pusa might be paraphyletic
(except if it were to be retained as a subgenus).
It is also noteworthy that all the relevant divergences
within Phocina apparently occurred in a very short time
frame (also see [14,26]), which might make resolution
within this group difficult to obtain even with additional
markers. By contrast, there were no negative branch
lengths in this part of the supertree (although nodes 23
and 24 in Figure 1 were held to be simultaneous initially),
indicating relatively good agreement among the sequence
data. Also, except for node 25, all the rQS values in this
part of the (preferred) tree are > 0, again indicating more
agreement than conflict among the set of gene trees (note
the rQs values in Fig. 2, the only negative value in the
alternative supertree concerns the sister-group relations of
the two Histriophocina species).
Within Monachinae, all analyses recovered a monophyletic Monachus as sister to Miroungini + Lobodontini.
Relationships within Monachus and Mirounga recovered
here are consistent among and well supported in numerous studies [4,11-15,23,26] (but see [22] regarding Monachus).
Relationships
within
Lobodontini
have
traditionally been contentious, although recent studies
[11-15] all support the sister relationship between Leptonychotes and Hydrurga recovered here (contra [4,23]). However, the positions of Ommatophoca and Lobodon relative to
each other and to the Leptonychotes + Hydrurga clade
remain problematic. Many recent studies [11,12,14,15]

Page 10 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:216

found the strongest support for an (Ommatophoca, (Lobodon, (Leptonychotes + Hydrurga))) relationship. Our results
differed and, similar to Fyler et al. [24], supported Lobodon
as being sister to the remaining species. The supermatrix
analyses indicated the identical sets of relationships for
Monachinae.
Divergence dates
The fossil record suggests that the divergence of the two
phocid subfamilies occurred sometime prior to the middle Miocene (> 14.6 mya) [77] and we used 16 mya as a
minimum age constraint for the corresponding node (also
see [23]). Similarly, Fyler et al. [24] used 15 and 17 mya
as calibration points from which to estimate divergence
dates in Monachinae. The corresponding molecular estimate of Arnason et al. [14] at 22 mya is older still and in
better agreement with our multidivtime dates. The initial
divergence in phocines (i.e., the lineage leading to Erignathus) was dated at 13.0 ± 0.90 mya, which is slightly
younger than other estimates [14,23,24,26] (the multidivtime dates are again older, ca. 19 mya). Our relDate dates
for the origins of Cystophora (8.0 ± 0.42 mya) and Histriophoca + Pagophilus (6.4 ± 0.40 mya) are considerably
younger than the corresponding estimates from BinindaEmonds et al. [23] (which are in closer agreement with the
multidivtime dates), but considerably older than the
available fossil evidence. Deméré et al. [2] suggested that
these basal phocines originated in the Arctic during the
Pleistocene and represent the products of a glacioeustaticforced allopatric speciation event. Arnason et al. [14] estimated a considerably older date (12 mya) for the divergence of Cystophora, again in agreement with both
Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] and our multidivtime results,
but a comparable 7 mya estimate for the origin of Histriophocina.

The genus Phoca arose 2.2 ± 0.62 mya (using relDate;
multidivtime dates ca. 5–6 mya), with both extant species
diverging from one another 1.1 ± 0.18 mya. These two
nodes were well sampled, with 18 and 12 molecular estimates, respectively. The suggested recent separation and
evolution of the two Phoca species (using both dating
methods) is in general agreement with other studies
[14,23,68,75,78]. Pusa sibirica arose 2.1 ± 0.21 mya, and
Halichoerus grypus and Pusa caspica diverged immediately
thereafter at 2.0 ± 0.14 mya; the divergence estimates for
these last two nodes were each dated by only three genes
apiece, and both are considerably older in the multidivtime analyses. Bininda-Emonds et al. [23], by contrast,
estimated the origin of Halichoerus to be 7.1 mya,
although this was based on a different topology, with Halichoerus in a more basal position. They also dated a Pusa
polytomy to 2.8 mya, whereas we estimate here (using relDate) that the three genera Phoca, Halichoerus, and Pusa all
arose over a short time span ranging from 2.2 to 1.1 mya

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/216

(2–6 mya using multidivtime). Palo and Väinölä [26]
similarly estimated that the radiation of the five main
Phocini mtDNA lineages occurred ca. 2.5–3.1 mya,
whereas Arnason et al. [14] estimated that the basal
Phocina radiations occurred at 4.5 mya. Sasaki et al. [79]
derived considerably younger estimates for divergences
within Pusa, although their calibration was based on an
incorrect estimate of the general mammalian substitution
rate [26]. In addition, the sister-group relationships on
which their dates are based conflict with our results and
those of other recent studies [14,26]. Regardless of the
precise relationships upon which the dates are based, the
general consensus is that the diversification within
Phocina was both rapid and relatively recent, which
agrees with biogeographic evidence suggesting that the
evolution of the Halichoerus-Pusa-Phoca complex likely
occurred in the Greenland Sea/Barents Sea portion of the
Arctic [2], and was possibly related to the closing of the
Panama Canal 3.2-2.8 mya, which resulted in the freezing
over of the Arctic Ocean [80-82].
Among the southern phocids, most nodes (with the obvious exception of the Monachus schauinslandi and M. tropicalis split) were well sampled, with 12–21 date estimates
each. The lineage leading to Monachus split from the
remaining species 11.3 ± 0.60 mya, which is slightly
younger than other recent estimates [23,24] (and these
other estimates are themselves slightly younger than the
multidivtime dates). Our relDate estimate of the origin of
the lineage leading to M. monachus (9.9 ± 0.28 mya) is
considerably older than the 4.8 mya estimate of BinindaEmonds et al. [23], but in good accord with those of Fyler
et al. [24] and Arnason et al. [14]. The multidivtime dates
for this node are again older, ca. 15–16 mya. The split
between M. schauinslandi and M. tropicalis was interpolated to be 4.9 mya, compared to 2.8 mya estimate from
Bininda-Emonds et al. [23] (also based on interpolation
from a pure-birth model).
Our results indicate that the Mirounga lineage split from
the lobodontine seals 10.0 ± 0.65 mya (ca. 15–16 mya
using multidivtime), which accords well with recent
genetic studies [14,23,24] and with fossil evidence indicating that the oldest fossils of southern lobodontines are
from the late Miocene (6.7-5.2 mya) [71] and suggesting
that the divergence occurred sometime before 11 mya
[2,83]. Our relDate date for the split between the two Mirounga species (2.3 ± 0.85 mya) was slightly younger than
that in other recent studies [14,23,24] (which were all in
general agreement with the multidivtime results), but
considerably older than the 0.8 mya estimate of Slade et
al. [84].
Among the four lobodontine seals, Lobodon diverged first
at 7.1 ± 0.34 mya, followed shortly thereafter by Ommato-

Page 11 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:216

phoca at 6.8 ± 0.26 mya, and finally by Hydrurga + Leptonychotes at 4.3 ± 0.55 mya. The time of origin of the lineage
leading to Lobodon is younger than the date estimated by
Fyler et al. [24], but older than that of Arnason et al. [14]
(who also resolved a different topology). However, both
it and time of origin of the lineage leading to Ommatophoca correspond well to the dates of Bininda-Emonds et
al. [23]. The divergence dates determined using multidivtime were again considerably older (Table 3).

Conclusion
Our results add to the growing list of studies that highlight
the need for a re-evaluation of pinniped taxonomy, with
revisions being required for both otariids (with respect to
subfamilial classification and the genus Arctocephalus) and
phocids (within Phocina, especially as regards Halichoerus
and Pusa), ideally based on additional and especially
nuclear genetic markers. The divergence-date estimates
herein indicate rapid radiations in both families, particularly the southern hemisphere fur seals (Arctocephalus)
and the northern phocids (Phocina), a fact which might
account for the historical difficulties in assessing the phylogenetic relationships within each group. The historically
unusual, but increasingly suggested nesting of Halichoerus
within Pusa (see also [6,14,15,26]) highlights both the
utility of large molecular datasets with numerous genes
and the value of including all relevant species in phylogenetic analysis (see also [4]). We suggest increased genetic
sampling throughout the group as the best approaches to
further improving our understanding of pinniped phylogenetics. For example, at the time we gathered data, only
MT-CYB had been sequenced for most otariid species and
only a small number of genes were available for several
Pusa species, although additional sequences have since
been provided [14,15]. That being said, the problem areas
within Phocina and Arctocephalus that were identified by
both supertree and supermatrix analyses might prove
resistant to resolution even with increased sampling
should the apparent rapid branching in these parts of the
tree be real.
Phylogenetic comparative methods have become the
standard way for comparing aspects of the biology of a
group of species while avoiding statistical problems associated with species not being independent due to their
shared evolutionary history [85]. Phylogenetic analyses
are improved with appropriate reconstruction of ancestral
nodes using divergence-date information [86,87], and
estimates of divergence dates provide conservation biology with a powerful tool in assessing vulnerability to conservation problems and comparative analysis of
extinction risk [88,89]. Our results will allow the use of
phylogenetic comparative methods with a robust estimate
of pinniped phylogeny and divergence times that includes
all species.

Methods
DNA sequence data
The use of large, multigene data sets provides the numerous informative changes required for correct inferences,
and may also help to raise weak phylogenetic signals
above the noise level [90]. In addition, the best topologies
are often resolved when estimates are based on a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. With these
points in mind, we mined GenBank for all available pinniped DNA sequence data to infer a phylogeny based on
the largest data set possible. All sequence data were downloaded on January 30, 2006 and mined using the Perl
script GenBankStrip v2.0 [91] to retain only those genes
that had been sequenced for at least three pinniped species and were longer than 200 bp (except for tRNA genes,
which had to be longer than 50 bp). For the 52 genes
meeting these criteria (see Table 4), matching sequences
for exemplars from Canidae (either Canis lupus or, on one
occasion, C. latrans) and/or Ursidae (usually Ursus arctos,
but also U. americanus or U. maritimus as needed) were
downloaded for outgroup analysis.

Sequences in each data set were aligned using ClustalW
[92] or with transAlign [93] in combination with ClustalW for the protein-coding sequences, and improved
manually where needed. Thereafter, each aligned data set
was passed through the Perl script seqCleaner v1.0.2 [91]
to standardize the species names, to eliminate inferior
sequences (i.e., those with > 5% Ns), and to ensure that all
sequences overlapped pairwise by at least 100 bps (or 25
bps for the tRNA genes). Note that although species
names were standardized according to Wilson and Reeder
[94] for the analyses, those used in the text for Phocini follow the currently accepted International Commission of
Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) taxonomy, which recognizes the five genera Halichoerus, Histriophoca,
Pagophilus, Phoca, and Pusa.
The final data set of 52 genes (Table 4) comprises 26818
bps in total, or an average of 515.7 bp per gene (range =
68–1980 bps). On average, each gene was sampled for
11.2 species (range = 3–35); however, only an average of
5.5 species per nuclear gene were available for study. Two
genes, LYZ and exon 29 of APOB, contained fewer than
three pinniped species and, as such, were uninformative
for resolving pinniped interrelationships. However, they
were still retained to determine times of divergence. Accession numbers for all sequences used in the final data set
are provided as supplementary material (Additional file
1).
The final data set is dominated by mitochondrial genes,
which forms a single locus due to its common inheritance
and general lack of recombination. As such, it must be
kept in mind that all the resulting topologies (be they

derived in a supertree or supermatrix framework) and
divergence times could be biased by any peculiarities
related to mitochondrial sequence data (e.g., introgression or linkage) or simply the disproportionately large
amount of mitochondrial data. However, the data set represents the "current systematic database" for pinnipeds
and so the best possible current data source for which to
infer their phylogenetic relationships. However, to assess
the impact of this potential source of bias, we performed
a second supertree analysis where all mtDNA genes were
combined to form a single source tree (yielding 12 source
trees in total). Nevertheless, the collection of additional
nuclear markers is desperately needed for this group.
The final data set used for the phylogenetic analyses,
together with the supertree and supermatrix trees is freely
available from TreeBASE [95] (study accession number
S1911, matrix accession numbers M3516-M3518).
Phylogeny reconstruction and supertree analysis
Our general approach to infer the phylogeny of the pinnipeds involved a divide-and-conquer strategy in which
individual genes trees were determined using the best possible methodology for each and then combined as a
supertree. Compared to a simultaneous analysis of the
multigene "supermatrix", this procedure has been argued
to potentially account better for the differential models of
evolution that might be present [96] and, for extremely
large matrices, looks to be a faster analytical method without any appreciable loss of accuracy [97]. Although the
use of mixed models is possible in both maximum likelihood (ML, [98]) and Bayesian frameworks, the accuracy
of the resulting tree, at least in a Bayesian framework, has
recently been called into question [99], especially when
reasonable levels of conflict exist between the different
data partitions [100]. Furthermore, Jeffroy et al. [101]
have also recently argued that trees derived from multigene, phylogenomic data sets should be treated more cautiously than those from single-gene analyses given that the
systematic biases inherent to phylogeny reconstruction
become more apparent with larger data sets. Nevertheless,
in light of the fierce criticism that the supertree approach
has attracted (e.g., [102,103], but see [104,105]), we also
conduct ML and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses of the
concatenated supermatrix to help identify especially problematic regions of the pinniped tree as part of a global
congruence framework [50] and to add to the growing
body of studies comparing phylogenetic inference under
these two frameworks (e.g., [15,106]).

For the supertree analyses, we used PHYML [106] to determine the ML tree for each of the 50 phylogenetically
informative genes after determining their optimal model
of evolution according to either AIC or AICc (as appropriate, the latter being a version of the AIC corrected for small

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/216

sample sizes) using MrAIC [107] and PHYML [106]
(Table 4). The 50 gene trees were then used to build a
weighted supertree of the group using matrix representation with parsimony (MRP, [48,49]). In so doing, we have
assumed that each gene tree forms an independent unit in
our preferred supertree, something that is admittedly
debatable for the mitochondrial genes and especially the
very small tRNA genes. However, in the absence of any
robust linkage information, this assumption seemed
more justifiable and objective than the defining of gene
partitions based on assumed linkage or for purely practical considerations (e.g., concatenating all the tRNA genes
because of their small size). Nonetheless, the sensitivity of
these assumptions was assessed using the second supertree in which all mtDNA genes formed a single source tree.
All gene trees were encoded for the MRP analysis using
semi-rooted coding [108], whereby only those trees with
either a canid and/or ursid outgroup taxon and where the
pinnipeds were reconstructed as being monophyletic were
held to be rooted. Furthermore, the individual MRP characters, which correspond to a particular node on a gene
tree, were weighted according to the bootstrap frequency
[109] of that node, as determined using PHYML and
based on 1000 replicates. This procedure has been demonstrated to increase the accuracy of MRP supertree construction in simulation [110]. The weighted parsimony
analysis of the resulting MRP matrix was accomplished
using a branch-and-bound search in PAUP* v4.0b10
[111], with Canidae and Ursidae being specified as a paraphyletic outgroup. Monachus tropicalis, for which no
molecular data exist, was added to the supertree manually
as the sister species of M. schauinslandii (following [4,23]).
Support for both supertrees and the relationships in them
were quantified with the supertree-specific rQS index
[51,52], which compares the topology of the supertree to
that of each of the source trees contributing to it. As such,
it is preferable to such conventional, character-based support measures such as Bremer support [112] and the bootstrap, which are invalid in this context given that MRP
characters for a given source tree are non-independent.
Values for rQS range from + 1 to -1, with the two values
indicating that a given node is directly supported or
directly contradicted by all source trees, respectively. The
rQS value for the entire tree is simply the average of all the
nodal rQS values. Previous applications of the rQS index
show that it often tends to negative values [51,52,113],
indicating that more conflict than agreement generally
exists among a set of source trees for a given node. As such,
positive values of rQS can be taken to indicate good support in the sense that more source trees support the relationship than contradict it.

The individual gene data sets were also concatenated to
form a single supermatrix that was analyzed using both
partitioned ML and BI methods. ML analyses used RAxML
VI-HPC v2.2.3 [114]. A GTR + G model was assumed for
the data using the CAT approximation of the gamma distribution, with the model parameters being allowed to
vary independently for each gene. CAT is both a fast
approximation of the gamma model (due to its lower
computational and memory costs) and one that appears
to yield better log likelihood scores even when calculated
under a real gamma model [115], and therefore is ideally
suited to large, computationally intensive data matrices
such as ours. The ML tree was taken to be the optimal tree
over 100 replicates, for which nodal support was estimated using the bootstrap with 1000 replicates and search
parameters matching those for the optimality search.
BI used MrBayes v3.1.2 [116], with the individual models
specified for each individual gene matching the optimal
model determined in the gene-tree analyses as closely as
possible. Otherwise, flat priors were used in all cases.
Searches employed a MCMC algorithm of two separate
runs, each with four chains that were run for 10000000
generations and with the first 5000000 generations being
discarded as burn-in. Trees were sampled every 5000 generations to derive the final BI tree and estimates of the posterior probabilities.
Divergence date estimations
Following Bininda-Emonds et al. [117], divergence times
on the supertree only were determined using a combination of fossil calibration points and molecular dates under
the assumption of a local molecular clock (see [118]). As
a first step, the optimal model of evolution for all 52 genes
was (re)determined using an AIC in ModelTEST v3.6
[119] in combination with PAUP*, with the appropriately
pruned supertree topology being used as the reference tree
in place of the default NJ tree. This combination was used
here in place of the previous MrAIC/PHYML combination
largely because it can be used to test for the applicability
of a molecular clock (through PAUP*) using a likelihoodratio test. The small taxonomic distribution meant that all
but six genes (CYP1A1, MT-ND4, MT-ND5, MT-RNR2,
OB, and MT-TQ) evolved according to a molecular clock.

Thereafter, we used PAUP* to fit the sequence data for
each gene to the (pruned) supertree topology under the
optimal model in a ML framework. In line with Purvis'
[118] local-clock model, the relative branch lengths for
each gene tree relative to the topology of the supertree
were determined using the Perl script relDate v2.2.1 [91].
Only the gene trees for the clock-like genes were considered to be rooted and relative branch lengths were calculated with respect to ancestral nodes only (and not also
with respect to daughter nodes).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/216

Divergence times were then determined by calibrating the
relative branch lengths for each gene tree using a set of fossil dates (Table 5). For a given node, the initial divergence
date was taken to be the maximum of 1) the median of all
fossil plus molecular estimates and 2) the fossil estimate.
In this way, the fossil estimate acts as a minimum age constraint that can overrule the molecular estimates. Upper
and lower bounds on any given date estimates took the
form of the 95% confidence interval derived from all individual gene and/or fossil estimates for that node.
Although error in the branch-length estimation for the
individual gene trees can also contribute to uncertainty in
the final date estimates [120], it is likely to be less important than the variation present between the different genes
themselves. However, together with uncertainties in the
fossil dates, it cannot be excluded that our confidence
intervals are underestimates of the true values.
Finally, the Perl script chronoGrapher v1.3.3 [91] was
used to correct for any negative branch lengths and simultaneously to derive a divergence-time estimate for the single node lacking an initial estimate (that linking Monachus
schauinslandi and M. tropicalis). The date for this latter
node was interpolated from the dates of up to five of its
ancestral nodes based on the relative number of species
descended from each node, assuming a constant birth
model (see [117]).
More details regarding this dating procedure, including its
strengths and weaknesses with respect to other relaxed
molecular clock methods (recently reviewed in [121]) can
be found in Bininda-Emonds et al. [117].
The Bayesian relaxed molecular clock method implemented by multidivtime [122,123] was also used to calculate divergence dates from the supermatrix data fitted to
the preferred supertree topology. General methodology
followed Rutschman [124], with maximum likelihood

estimates.

parameters estimated using PAML version 3.15 [125].
Incomplete overlap of sequences between taxa (in particular the outgroup sequence(s) not being represented in
every partition) meant that model partitioning by gene
was impossible; instead, a single F84 + gamma model was
applied to the entire supermatrix. The root prior rttm (the
mean of the prior distribution for the time from the
ingroup root to the tips; in other words, the age of the
ursid-pinniped split) was specified as 19.5 mya, with the
remaining constraints the same as in the supertree dating
analysis (Table 5). Other multidivtime parameters were
calculated following the recommendations of Rutschmann [124]: rtrate (mean of prior distribution for the
rate at the root node) = X/rttm, where X is the median
amount of evolution from the root to tips; rtratesd (standard deviation of rtrtate) = 0.5 × rtrate; brownmean (mean
of the prior distribution for the autocorrelation parameter, v) = 1/rttm; brownsd (standard deviation of brownmean) = brownmean. Three independent multidivtime
analyses were run for 1 × 106 cycles, with samples taken
every 100 cycles after a burn-in period of 1 × 105 cycles.
The dates presented here are mean values for the three
runs. The multidivtime analyses were then repeated using
only the mitochondrial genes to investigate whether the
inclusion of nuclear genes greatly altered the estimated
divergence dates.
