Abstract
Background: Important developmental processes in both plants and animals are partly regulated by genes
whose expression is modulated at the post-transcriptional level by processes such as RNA interference
(RNAi). Dicers, Argonautes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) form the core components
that facilitate gene silencing and have been implicated in the initiation and maintenance of the trigger RNA
molecules, central to process of RNAi. Investigations in eukaryotes have revealed that these proteins are
encoded by variable number of genes with plants showing relatively higher number in each gene family. To
date, no systematic expression profiling of these genes in any of the organisms has been reported.
Results: In this study, we provide a complete analysis of rice Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR gene families
including gene structure, genomic localization and phylogenetic relatedness among gene family members.
We also present microarray-based expression profiling of these genes during 14 stages of reproductive
and 5 stages of vegetative development and in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress. We have
identified 8 Dicer-like (OsDCLs), 19 Argonaute (OsAGOs) and 5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(OsRDRs) genes in rice. Based on phylogeny, each of these genes families have been categorized into four
subgroups. Although most of the genes express both in vegetative and reproductive organs, 2 OsDCLs, 14
OsAGOs and 3 OsRDRs were found to express specifically/preferentially during stages of reproductive
development. Of these, 2 OsAGOs exhibited preferential up-regulation in seeds. One of the Argonautes
(OsAGO2) also showed specific up-regulation in response to cold, salt and dehydration stress.
Conclusion: This investigation has identified 23 rice genes belonging to DCL, Argonaute and RDR gene
families that could potentially be involved in reproductive development-specific gene regulatory
mechanisms. These data provide an insight into probable domains of activity of these genes and a basis for
further, more detailed investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of individual components of
RNA silencing machinery during reproductive phase of plant development.

Background
In plants, small RNAs have been widely implicated in varied developmental events and as guide RNAs in many
gene silencing pathways [1-6]. These RNAs are usually
generated by the activities of Dicers, Argonautes and RNAdependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), which are also
sometimes referred to as the core proteins mediating RNA
interference. These proteins are involved in the initiation
and maintenance of the trigger RNA that is central to this
mode of gene regulation. Briefly, initiation of gene silencing involves generation of double stranded RNA (dsRNA)
by several mechanisms, for example, bidirectional transcription of DNA, self-complementary RNA foldbacks or
RNA-dependent transcription of aberrantly synthesized
mRNAs [7]. The complementary dsRNAs are then processed by the RNaseIII-type activities of Dicers into small
RNAs, ~19–31 nucleotides in length (siRNA or miRNA).
Generally, one strand of these RNAs then associates with
the silencing effector complexes through the Argonaute
proteins. This confers sequence-specific guide functions to
these complexes that find target RNAs with sequences
complementary to the small RNAs. Silencing/repression
of the target genes then occurs by either blocking translation or cleavage of the target mRNA. These small RNAs
could also mediate transcriptional gene silencing by
recruitment of histone and/or DNA methyltransferases to
regulatory sequences of the target genes [8,9].
Dicers and Argonautes are multidomain ribonucleases.
Dicers are characterized by the presence of six types of
domains, viz., DExD-helicase, helicase-C, Duf283, PAZ,
RNaseIII and double stranded RNA-binding (dsRB)
domain [10]. All Argonaute proteins share the domain
structure that comprises of an N terminal, PAZ, Mid and a
C-terminal PIWI domain. The PAZ domain (~100 a.a)
facilitates binding of 3' end of siRNA, while, the PIWI
domain binds the 5' end of siRNA and to the target RNA.
This domain has marked similarity with RNaseH family of
ribonucleases and it possesses the catalytic amino acid residues required for endonucleolytic cleavage of the target
RNA [11]. At least three subfamilies of Argonaute proteins
have been identified in eukaryotes [12]. These include the
AGO subfamily that is present in plants, animals and
yeasts; the Piwi subfamily that has been found only in animals and the worm-specific Argonaute (WAGO) subfamily that are present in C. elegans [13,14,6]. Members of
both AGO and Piwi subfamilies possess the characteristic
DDH metal binding signature residues in their Piwi
domains, while most of the WAGO proteins lack them.
The Piwi proteins are expressed specifically in the germline cells and are known to interact with a subset of small
RNA called Piwi-interacting RNA that are longer (26–31
nt) than siRNA and miRNA (21–24 nt) [13]. This clade of
Argonaute proteins have not been identified in any plant
species. Recently, however, a novel kind of Argonaute,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/451

OsMEL1 has been described in rice that is involved specifically in male meiosis [15]. RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase was first isolated from tomato [16]. These
proteins are required for initiation and amplification of
silencing signal and they possess a conserved sequence
motif that resembles the catalytic β' subunit of DNAdependent RNA polymerases [17].
Multiple copies of Dicers, Argonautes and RDR genes are
known to exist in both plants and animals. With the
exception of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) that
codes for only one copy each of the Dicer, the Argonaute
and the RDR, these proteins are encoded by multigene
families in insects, nematodes, mammals and plants [18].
In Arabidopsis, 4 Dicer-like (DCL), 10 Argonautes and 6
RDR genes have been identified. Functions of few of these
genes have also been elucidated. Arabidopsis Dicer-like 1
(DCL1), but not DCL2, 3 and 4, has been implicated in
biogenesis of miRNA [19]. ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) regulates floral meristem and organ identity by affecting
expression of LEAFY, APETALA1 and AGAMOUS genes. It
also affects expression of the polycomb group protein,
CURLYLEAF (CLF) that maintains repression of both
KNOX and AGAMOUS in vegetative organs [20]. In Drosophila, DICER-1 (Dcr-1) has been found to be essential
for miRNA formation and it functions redundantly with
Dcr-2 downstream of siRNA production. Dcr-2, on the
other hand, has also been implicated in siRNA formation
[21,22]. In Neurospora crassa, distinct RDR and Argonaute
proteins are required for meiotic silencing of unpaired
DNA (in nucleus) and RNAi (in cytoplasm; [23]). In
Caenorhabditis elegans, the 22 nucleotide endogenous
miRNA encoded by lin-4 and let-7 genes are processed by
Dcr-1 and these small RNAs regulate lin-14 and lin-41
linked timing of developmental stages in the nematode
life cycle [24].
In rice, components of the RNAi machinery are known to
be involved in maintenance of undifferentiated cells in
shoot apical meristem (SAM), initiation of lateral organ
primodia from SAM and floral meristems and formation
of male and female germ cells [15,25,26]. The present
investigation has been carried out with the aim to obtain
comprehensive expression overview of all the members of
rice Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR gene families to gain
insight into the domains of activity of these genes and to
provide a firm foundation for further, more detailed
investigations aimed at understanding the contribution of
individual components of RNA silencing machinery in
regulating gene expression during reproductive development of plants. For this, an in-house generated (previously described; [27]) rice microarray data set comprising
of 17 stages of vegetative and reproductive development,
along with 5 newly added tissues/developmental stages
corresponding to Y-leaf, SAM and three very early stages of

panicle initiation, was utilized. Where possible, the
expression profiles of rice genes have been compared with
those in Arabidopsis at similar stages of flower and seed
development to identify genes with similar expression
profiles in dicots.

Results
Identification and structural organization of rice Dicerlike, Argonaute and RDR genes
Name search using the keywords, Dicer, PAZ, PIWI, Argonaute and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and HMM
analysis resulted in the identification of 8 genes encoding
Dicer-like (OsDCL) proteins, 19 for Argonautes (OsAGO)
and 5 genes for RDR (OsRDR) in the rice genome (TIGR
rice pseudomolecule release 5). Besides confirming the
previously identified gene members, this exercise revealed
two additional OsDCL and one Argonaute encoding loci
[10]. The newly identified Dicer-like loci are
LOC_Os05g18850 (OsDCL1c) and LOC_Os06g25250
(OsDCL1b) with coding potential of 318 and 300 amino
acid polypeptides, respectively (Table 1). Protein evidence
for only LOC_Os06g25250 was found in the Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL database (accession number: Q69KJ0). Search for
the conserved domains by Simple Modular Architecture
Research Tool (SMART) analysis and in NCBI databases
revealed the presence of only RNaseIII and dsRB domains
in these proteins, while in most other OsDCLs, DExD,
Helicase-C, Duf283, PAZ, RNaseIII and dsRB domains,
characteristic of plant DCL proteins, were present.
OsDCL2b, however, lacked the Duf283 domain and both
OsDCL2a and 2b lacked one of the dsRB domains, as
reported previously [10]. Maximum number of introns,
26 in number, was found in OsDCL3a that codes for a
1598 amino acid polypeptide.

Of the 19 Argonautes identified in rice in the present
study, 17 and 18 genes respectively, were reported recently
[15,28]. The additional OsAGO (named OsAGO4b) identified in this study, corresponds to the locus
LOC_Os04g06770 and is characterized by the presence
PAZ and PIWI domains in the putative polypeptide
sequence. All OsAGOs code for ~100 kDa basic proteins
with pI ranging from 8.07–10. The OsAGOs are characterized by the presence of PAZ domain (~100 amino acids)
towards the amino terminus and PIWI domain (~400
amino acids) at the carboxyl end. As an exception,
OsAGO16 was found to code for only the PIWI domain
(Table 1). OsAGO15 (LOC_Os01g16850) is characterized
by the longest open reading frame of 6711 bp with a coding potential for a 2237 amino acid polypeptide. This protein has been annotated as a retrotransposon protein in
TIGR release 5. However, it possesses the Argonaute-specific PAZ and PIWI domains besides the DUF, intergrase
core domain (rve) and the reverse transcriptase (RVT_2)
domain, characteristic of mobile elements. This gene has

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/451

also been included as member of the rice Argonaute gene
family in previous studies [15,28]. Structural studies in
other organisms have shown that the PIWI domain of Argonaute proteins folds similar to RNaseH proteins. Consistent with this observation, some Argonaute proteins in
both plants and animals are known to cleave the target
RNAs that have sequence complementary to the small
RNAs [11,18]. These catalytic proteins are known to possess three conserved metal chelating residues in the PIWI
domain i.e. aspartate, aspartate and histidine (DDH), that
function as the catalytic triad. In Arabidopsis AGO1, a conserved histidine at position 798 (H798) was also observed
to be critical for the endonuclease activity of AGO1 in vitro
[18]. To interrogate which of the OsAGO possessed the
conserved catalytic residues and could potentially act as
the slicer component of silencing effector complexes, we
aligned the PIWI domains of all the OsAGOs using CLUSTALX (Figure 1). Eight proteins, namely OsAGO1a,
OsAGO1b, OsAGO10a, OsAGO10b, OsMEL1, OsAGO7,
OsPNH1 and OsAGO12, were found to have the conserved DDH/H798 residues. In three OsAGOs, the first
aspartate was either missing or was replaced by a glycine
or histidine. The other six possessed the conserved DDH
triad but the histidine at 798th position in AGO1 was
either replaced by serine or a proline (Table 2). At gene
structure level, the number of introns in OsAGO varied
from 2 in OsAGO2 and SHL4 to 22 in OsAGO1a,
OsAGO1b, OsAGO1c and OsAGO1d (Table 1).
All the 5 RDR genes present in the rice genome were found
to encode proteins that share a common sequence motif
corresponding to the catalytic β' subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases [17]. The length of the open reading
frames of OsRDRs varied from 1311 bp for OsRDR3 to
3657 bp for SHL2, with the coding potential of 437 and
1219 amino acids, respectively. Interestingly, the genomic
sequence of SHL2 that encodes the longest open reading
frame is interrupted by a single intron, while OsRDR4 that
encodes the second longest open reading frame of 3621
bp has 18 intervening sequences as annotated in TIGR
(release 5; Table 1).
Phylogeny and chromosomal localization
To determine evolutionary relatedness of rice Argonautes,
RDRs and DCLs with those from mammals, Drosophila,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis, total protein sequences from these organisms
were used to construct an unrooted neighbour-joining
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). Rice and Arabidopsis AGO
genes clustered into four subgroups, MEL1, AGO1, AGO4
and ZIPPY (Figure 2A), similar to those described by Nonomura et al. (2007; [15]). In AGO1 subgroup, four rice
genes grouped with single Arabidopsis gene AGO1 that is
closely related to AGO10/PNH. These genes have been
designated as OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b, OsAGO1c and

OsAGO1d on the basis of high sequence similarity to
AGO1 and similar gene expression profiles to the Arabidopsis gene (described elsewhere). The MEL1 group contains five rice genes including OsMEL1 and the only
Arabidopsis gene AGO5. Comparison of full-length
OsAGO proteins of this clade revealed that these proteins
shared 25 – 60% overall identity but their PIWI domains
had 75 – 94% similar residues. Since only AGO5 and
OsMEL1 exhibit similar expression profiles, other genes in
this clade have been named OsAGO11-14. In the AGO4
subgroup, two highly similar rice members,
LOC_Os04g06770 and LOC_Os01g16870 have been
named OsAGO4a and OsAGO4b as they share greater similarity with AGO4 (more than 65% at amino acid level) in
comparison to AGO9, AGO8 and AGO6. The animal Argonautes, on the other hand, are grouped into two distinct
clades A1 and A2. The phylogenetic relationship of these
groups suggests that the plant AGO1 and MEL1 clades had
a common lineage with A1, while ZIPPY and AGO4 clades
may have diverged from an ancestral lineage that gave rise
to A2 clade in animals.
Phylogenetic analysis of rice, Arabidopsis, Zea mays, Populus
trichocarpa, C. elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe RDR
genes revealed that dicot and monocot RDR genes cluster
into four clades, I, II, III and IV (Figure 2B). Members in
each clade show monophyletic pattern of origin. The rice
RDR genes have been named as OsRDR1 to 4 on the basis
of sequence similarity with the corresponding proteins in
Arabidopsis. LOC_Os01g10130 was named OsRDR3 and
LOC_Os01g10140 has been named OsRDR4 on the basis
of phylogeny and the results of homology scores of the
rice genes with the corresponding Arabidopsis RDR3 and

RDR4 genes in BLAST searches (data not shown). The
RDR genes of C. elegans also originated from a common
ancestral gene that diverged from the clades that gave rise
to plant and the single yeast gene.
Plant DCL genes form a monophyletic group with OsDCL
genes showing high sequence conservation with their
counterparts in Arabidopsis (Figure 2C). Dicers from Drosophila (Dcr-1), nematode and humans form one group
that is distinct from Drosophila Dicer2 and the only Dicer
from S. pombe due to absence of the conserved PAZ
domain in these proteins (Figure 2C). The newly identified OsDCL loci closely grouped with the highly similar
AtDCL1 and OsDCL1. Similar associations were observed
when only dsRBa domains of rice and Arabidopsis proteins
were used to construct a phylogenetic tree (data not
shown). Therefore, we have renamed OsDCL1 as
OsDCL1a, and named the two new loci as OsDCL1b and
OsDCL1c (Table 1, Figure 2C).
To gain insight into the evolution of multiple AGOs,
RDRs and DCLs in rice, we analyzed their genomic distribution by localizing the genes on rice chromosomes (Figure 3; Table 1). Two pairs of rice Argonautes, OsAGO14OsMEL1 and OsAGO1a-OsAGO1b, appear to have originated due to segmental duplications in chromosomes 3
and 7 and chromosomes 2 and 4, respectively. OsAGO13
was located close to OsMEL1 on chromosome 3, which
has the maximum number of 5 genes, while the rest of the
OsAGO were distributed on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and
7 (Figure 3). Localization of OsRDR on rice chromosomes
showed 3 genes, OsRDR3, OsRDR4 and SHL2 on chromosome 1 while chromosomes 2 and 4 had OsRDR1 and
OsRDR2, respectively (Figure 3). None of these genes were
found to be located in duplicated segments of the
genome.
The OsDCL genes were distributed on 7 chromosomes
(Figure 3). Except chromosome 3 that contains OsDCL1
and OsDCL2a, all the other chromosomes (1, 5, 6, 4, 9
and 10) have single representative of OsDCL. When these
data were superimposed with those for segmental duplications (TIGR), OsDCL2a and OsDCL2b were found to lie
in duplicated regions of chromosomes 3 and 9. It has
been previously shown that at amino acid levels too, these
two paralogs share 99% similarity while at the genomic
level these genes differ by a 200 bp deletion within an
intron and deletion of a part of Duf domain in OsDCL2b
[10]. OsDCL1a, OsDCL1b and OsDCL1c that share significant homology were localized on regions of chromosomes 3, 5 and 6, which are not included in segmental
duplication database, suggesting that events other than
large segmental duplications might be responsible for
their evolution. The expressed sequence tags (EST) showing similarity to these rice Dicer-like genes are present in

Zea mays and Saccharum officinarum (AZM5_100042,
CA252311) but not in Arabidopsis, thereby suggesting that
duplication of OsDCL1 may have occurred after the divergence of monocots and dicots (~60 my).
A gene pair was considered tandemly duplicated if the
members were separated by less than five intervening
genes and shared ≥ 40% sequence similarity at amino acid
level. Three OsAGO gene pairs, (OsAGO4a-15; OsAGO2-3
and OsAGO11-12) localized close to each other on chromosomes 1, 4 and 3, respectively, thus are considered to
have arisen due to tandem duplications (Figure 3). They
share 55%, 54% and 51% identity at amino acid level
between the pair partners. None of the OsDCLs or OsRDRs
seems to have undergone tandem duplications.
Transcript profiling of genes during vegetative and
reproductive development and abiotic stress
To analyze transcript abundance of Dicer-like, Argonaute
and RDR genes at different stages of reproductive development in rice, microarray datasets generated in-house were
utilized. The stages of vegetative and reproductive development analyzed in the present study are summarized
[see Additional file 1]. Microarray hybridization was performed using the 57K Affymetrix GeneChip® Rice Genome
Arrays as described previously [27]. Normalization of data
was done using GCRMA algorithm and was log2 transformed before differential expression analyses were
undertaken. In the microarray dataset, > 99.9% of negative controls and non-rice probe-sets were found to have
average signal intensity values less than 15. Therefore, the
value '15' was considered as the cut off value to distinguish between expressed and non-expressed genes in a
particular tissue/developmental stage.

The rice DCL genes OsDCL1a, OsDCL2, OsDCL3a and
SHO1 were found to express ubiquitously (minimum
normalized signal intensity values 67.7, 290.5, 32.0 and
82.2, respectively) in the tissues/stages of plant development analyzed [see Additional file 2]. These genes
expressed at moderate to high levels in vegetative tissues
but their expression was markedly reduced during specific
stages of reproductive development (Figure 4A). Specifically, SHO1, OsDCL1a and OsDCL2 showed an approximately 10-, 37- and 10-fold down-regulation in late seed
development stages (S4 and S5) in comparison to their
peak expression in young seedlings, Y-leaf and SAM,
respectively [see Additional file 3]. In contrast, two of the
low expressing genes, OsDCL1b and OsDCL3b, exhibited
panicle- and early seed-specific expression. The peak
expression of OsDCL1b was found to be in P6 stage (corresponding to mature pollen stage of anther development) and was ~3-fold higher than its average signal
intensity values in vegetative tissues. OsDCL3b expressed
at ~6.5-fold higher levels in P1-II stage in comparison to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/451

its expression in vegetative stages. In vegetative tissues
(except SAM), the average signal intensity values for both
these genes were less than 15. Like OsDCL1a, OsDCL2,
OsDCL3a and SHO, three Arabidopsis genes, AtDCL1,
AtDCL2 and AtDCL4, were found to express in all the tissues/stages of development. On the other hand, AtDCL3
(like OsDCL3b) exhibited specific up-regulation of expression in reproductive stages, while in vegetative stages its
expression was barely detectable. None of the OsDCL
genes showed alteration in expression in response to the
three abiotic stress conditions, viz. cold, salt or dehydration (Figure 4A).
Among OsAGOs, 11 out of 19 genes (OsAGO1a, 1b, 1c,
1d, 2, 4a, 4b, 13, 17, 18 and OsPNH1) were found to
express in both vegetative and reproductive tissues (Average signal intensities > 62.6; Figure 4B) [see Additional file
2]. Out of 19 genes, 14 genes belonging to AGO1, AGO4
and MEL1 clades (OsAGO4b, 1b, 4a, 2, 1a, 1d, 16, 1c,
OsPNH1, OsMEL1, 13 and SHL4), were significantly upregulated (7-, 10-, 7-, 2.3-, 18-, 2-, 8-, 8-, 36-, 12-,11- and
36-fold, respectively) at the onset of floral development.
Average signal intensity values of MEL1 clade genes,
OsAGO13 and OsMEL1, were < 15 in vegetative tissues as
compared to the other genes of AGO1 and AGO4 clades.
Arabidopsis AGO5 has been shown to express only in
reproductive tissues, i.e. during all stages of flower and
seed formation [29]. This expression pattern is similar to
that of OsMEL1 in rice. However, the expression of closely
related OsAGO13 and OsAGO14 overlapped with that of
OsMEL1. Individually, OsAGO13 expressed significantly
in SAM and early stages of floral initiation (P1-I, P1-II and
P1-III) and OsAGO14 expressed in late panicle and early
seed development stages (Figure 4B). OsMEL1 and
OsAGO14 share 60% identity at amino acid level and lie
in duplicated segments of chromosomes 3 and 7 (Figure
3). However, their contrasting expression patterns during
reproductive development suggest that these two genes
have significantly diverged functionally after the duplication event (Figure 5). For the tandemly duplicated pair,
OsAGO11 and OsAGO12, in this clade, only OsAGO12
transcripts could be detected during late panicle (P6) and
early seed stages (S1–S4) while transcripts for OsAGO11
were barely detectable at any of the stages (Figure 5). In
AGO1 subgroup, there are 5 rice genes clustered with two
Arabidopsis genes, AGO1 and AGO10. Unlike their rice
counterparts, Arabidopsis AGO1 and AGO10 expressed in
vegetative as well as reproductive tissues without any significant increase in transcript accumulation in reproductive tissues. Whereas, all the rice genes in this subgroup
exhibited 3- to 36-fold enhancement in transcript levels
coinciding with the initiation of reproductive development. Expression pattern of the segmentally duplicated
genes, OsAGO1a and OsAGO1b, in this clade overlapped
at all stages and in all tissues, with OsAGO1b being

expressed at relatively higher levels than OsAGO1a (Figures 4B and 5). In the ZIPPY clade, expression of tandemly
duplicated genes, OsAGO2 and OsAGO3, overlapped
only during P3–P5 stage of panicle development while at
all the other stages, only OsAGO2 was observed to be
highly expressed while, OsAGO3 transcripts could not be
detected (Figure 4 and 5). This shows that both segmental
and tandem duplication of Argonaute genes have resulted
in formation of gene partners that have probably diverged
functionally during the course of evolution and have thus
contributed to the diversity of this protein family in rice.
Members of ZIPPY subgroup, SHL4/SHO2 and AGO7 differed from other members of this clade in being expressed
predominantly during early stage of floral development.
There are four genes each from rice and Arabidopsis that
constitute the AGO4 clade. Out of these, the coding
region of OsAGO15 is interrupted by a retrotransposon.
Amongst the Arabidopsis genes, expression profiles of
only AGO4 and AGO9 could be obtained. On the basis of
transcript accumulation patterns and sequence similarities, the Arabidopsis AGO4 seems to have two counter-

parts in rice, OsAGO4a and OsAGO4b. These three genes
showed enhanced expression during early stages of floral
development. The OsAGO4a and OsAGO4b were up-regulated by 6.9 and 6.7 folds, while the enhancement was
only 2.6 folds in case of AtAGO4 (Figure 4B) [see Additional files 3 and 4]. Conservation in expression profiles
was also observed for Arabidopsis AGO2 and OsAGO2
genes, whereas, the expression of AGO3 gene differed in
both rice and Arabidopsis. AtAGO3 expressed specifically
during stages of seed development, while expression of
OsAGO3 was confined to later stages of panicle formation
(P3–P5). OsAGO18, that did not cluster into any of the
four subgroups exhibited high level expression during late
panicle (P3–P6) and seed development stages, S1–S5,
along with low level expression in vegetative tissues. For
OsAGO11, a unique Affymetrix probe set ID existed, but
no transcripts could be detected in any of the tissues or
developmental stages analyzed. Most OsAGOs did not
show any variation in expression in response to the three
abiotic stresses, except OsAGO2, whose transcript levels

Microarray based expression analysis of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR genes of rice and Arabidopsis
Microarray based expression analysis of Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR genes of rice and Arabidopsis. For rice
genes the expression profiles have been analyzed in vegetative tissues (Y leaf, mature leaf, roots), Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM)
and six stages of panicle development (P1 to P6) along with 3 substages of P1 i.e. P1-I, P1-II and P1-III, five stages of seed development (S1 to S5) and under three abiotic stress conditions (cold, salt and dehydration). For Arabidopsis, expression profiles of
two vegetative stages (leaf and root), five stages of flower development (F1–F5), five stages of silique development and three
stress treatments (cold, salt and dehydration) have been compiled. The color bar in each panel represents log2 expression values. Developmental stages used for expression profiling are mentioned on top of each column. Panicle and seed stages have
been listed in the temporal order of development. On the left side of expression map, cluster dendrogram is shown. The bar
graph in panel B shows the expression profiles of OsAGO15 based on MPSS data [41] from 60-days mature leaf, 60-days mature
root, 60-days crown meristematic tissue (NME), 90-days immature panicle (NIP), mature reproductive organs (MRO) and 3days germinating seed (NGS). Expression of OsAGO2 that shows two-fold up-regulation in response to all three stresses is
boxed in blue in panel B.

increased by > 2-folds (p-value ≤ 0.05) in response to all
three stresses.
Of the five OsRDR genes, four expressed both in vegetative
and floral tissues with average intensity values of > 15 in
any or all stages of vegetative, floral- and seed-development (Figure 4C). However, a significant increase in the
transcript abundance for OsRDR1, OsRDR2 and OsRDR3
(56-, 4.2- and 26.6-fold, respectively, at p-value ≤ 0.05)
was observed during stages of early panicle development
(P1-I to P1-III) in comparison to their expression in
mature leaves (Figure 4C) [see Additional files 3 and 4].
The expression of OsRDR1 was detectable up to S2 stage
of seed formation and declined thereafter. The expression
profile of the closely related Arabidopsis genes, RDR1 and
RDR2, did not show significant increase in transcript levels as compared to rice genes during early flower development; nevertheless, their transcripts were detectable until
early stages of seed development. Unlike any other corresponding gene in Arabidopsis, the expression of OsRDR4
(that did not show any detectable expression in vegetative
tissues except SAM) was found to be up-regulated by 36
folds in early stages of panicle development in comparison to mature vegetative tissues.
Four genes, OsAGO14, OsRDR3, OsRDR4 and OsDCL3a,
showing discrete expression patterns were selected for validation of microarray expression profiles by QPCR analysis. Figure 6 shows a comparison of the QPCR and
microarray analysis. The expression patterns obtained for
all four genes using QPCR were similar to that derived
from the microarrays with Pearson's correlation values
ranging from 0.86 to 0.94 (Figure 6).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/451

in the type of small RNAs they process [10]. For example,
DCL1 and DCL4 are required for biogenesis of 21 nt small
RNAs that correspond mainly to miRNA and tasiRNA,
DCL2 affects accumulation of 21 nt RNA that protects
against viral infection and DCL3 acts to produce the 24 nt
RNAs that mediate de novo DNA methylation, gene silencing and chromatin modification [19,30]. We have identified all four classes of DCL genes in rice, that total eight in
number. While duplication of DCL2 genes (OsDCL2a and
OsDCL2b), which share more than 90% similarity at the
amino acid level, has also been reported in Arabidopsis and
Populus trichocarpa. However, duplication of DCL3 that
gave rise to OsDCL3a and OsDCL3b is considered specific
to monocots and predates the divergence of rice and
maize [10]. In the present study, microarray based expression pattern analysis of rice and Arabidopsis DCL genes at
different stages of reproductive development shows conservation in expression pattern of genes in dicot and
monocot plants, however, duplication events in rice may
also have given rise to genes with novel expression (and
probably functional) profiles.
Null mutants of AtDCL1 exhibit pleiotropic developmental defects and are lethal due to loss of accumulation of
miRNAs. Henderson et al. (2006) also demonstrated that
miRNAs dominate the pool of small RNAs (67.5%) accumulated in dcl2/dcl3/dcl4 triple mutants [19]. In rice too,
it has been shown that loss-of-function of OsDCL1 but
not OsDCL4 affects processing of miRNA [25]. Consistent
with the roles of miRNAs in regulation of various plant
developmental processes, AtDCL1 was found to express
ubiquitously in all tissues. The presence of three DCL1
like genes in rice with divergent expression profiles is suggestive of diversification of DCL1 function in rice.

Discussion
RNA interference plays an important role in regulating
gene expression at post transcriptional level during vegetative and reproductive development in plants [6]. This
process is mediated by concerted activities of proteins like,
Dicers, Argonautes and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. In the present investigation, we have identified the
genes encoding these proteins families in rice and studied
their distribution on rice chromosome pseudomolecules.
Phylogenetic analysis has shed light on the evolution of
members in each gene family in rice and has provided
insight into multiplicity of Argonaute genes in rice. Microarray based expression analysis at different stages of reproductive development in rice plants was attempted with
the view to understand the contribution and developmental timings of activity of these proteins.
Rice Dicer-like genes
While there is only one Dicer in mammals and nematodes
that is involved in processing all sizes of small RNAs, four
DCL genes found in Arabidopsis seem to have specialized

AtDCL3 together with RDR2 in Arabidopsis is known to
affect accumulation of small RNAs that mediate de novo
DNA methylation and transgene silencing. In rice, of the
two OsDCL3s, OsDCL3a was previously considered as the
functional counterpart of AtDCL3 on the basis of overall
homology and conservation of dsRBb domain. On the
other hand, the dsRBb domain in OsDCL3b was so divergent from that of AtDCL3 that it was suggested to categorize it as an altogether different, fifth class of dicer-like
protein [10]. AtDCL3 and OsDCL3b show low level
expression in vegetative tissues with enhanced transcript
accumulation in floral tissues and early stages of seed
development. However, OsDCL3b expression was confined only to early (pre-meiotic) stages of panicle development. Hence, on the basis of expression profiles
AtDCL3 and OsDCL3b share similar expression domains,
although the encoded proteins possess highly divergent
dsRBb domains and could therefore be interacting with
different RNA substrates.

Comparison of expression profiles of tandemly and segmentally duplicated Argonaute genes in rice
Comparison of expression profiles of tandemly and segmentally duplicated Argonaute genes in rice. Y-axis represents the average normalized expression values obtained from microarray analysis, while the X-axis depicts tissues/developmental stages [see Additional file 1]. Chromosomal location of each gene is mentioned on the right. Percentages in brackets
indicate percentage of identical residues in the encoded proteins.

Arabidopsis DCL4 has been shown to function redundantly
with DCL2 and DCL3 to process SHL2(OsRDR6) generated double stranded RNA into tasiRNA The RNA template for SHL2 is in turn produced by the activity of
miR173 and miR390 generated by DCL1, HYL1, HEN1
and AGO1 [30]. The expression patterns of rice genes,
OsDCL4, SHL2 and OsAGO1 members (OsAGO1a,
OsAGO1b, OsAGO1c and OsAGO1d) matched that of the
corresponding genes in Arabidopsis especially in exhibiting
enhanced expression during early stages of floral/panicle
development. This further suggests that the diversification
in function, as speculated from their expression pattern,
of most plant DCL genes may have occurred after the split
of plants and animal lineages but before the divergence of
monocots and dicots.

Multiple AGOs and their roles in rice plant development
Argonautes form an evolutionarily conserved gene family
whose members are present in both single celled and multicellular eukaryotes. Multiple genes have been reported
in various organisms. Rice has the largest number of Argonautes among plants, almost double the number
reported in Arabidopsis and second only to C. elegans that
possesses 27 AGOs [14]. Rice genes with similar/overlapping expression domains with Arabidopsis AGO1,
(OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b, OsAGO1c and OsAGO1d) AGO5,
(OsAGO13, OsAGO14 and OsMEL), and AGO4,
(OsAGO4a and OsAGO4b), have been identified in the
present study. Most of these genes appear to have evolved
by duplication events (tandem or segmental) followed by
differentiation of expression patterns. These duplication
events may also have given rise to redundancy among
OsAGO genes as is evident from the overlapping expres-

sion profiles of OsAGO1a, OsAGO1b, OsAGO1c and
OsAGO1d and OsAGO4a and OsAGO4b genes. On the
other hand, OsMEL1 and OsAGO14, that appear to have
arisen by duplication of segments in chromosomes 3 and
7, exhibit contrasting expression profiles during panicle
and seed development.
Argonautes are highly basic RNA binding proteins characterized by presence of PAZ and PIWI domains. The PIWI
domain adopts an RNAse-like fold and has predicted
endonuclease activity (slicer). It binds to 5' end and also
interacts with the target RNA [31,32]. The PAZ domain
interacts with 3' of small RNAs and is the candidate region
that determines the specificity of Argonautes. Consistent
with this, homology among various rice AGOs was
observed to be minimum in the PAZ regions (~21%)
while their PIWI domains exhibited more than 90% conservation of amino acids. The endonuclease property of
AGO proteins involved in RNAi resides in the PIWI
domain that possesses three conserved metal-chelating
amino acids (DDH). Subfamilies of AGO proteins, primary and secondary Argonautes, have been described in
C. elegans on the basis of presence or absence of these catalytic amino acid residues [14]. Five of the Arabidopsis
AGO proteins, AGO2, AGO3, AGO4, AGO6 and AGO9
lack either the critical DDH or the H798 residue. In rice
too, eleven genes do not code for the conserved catalytic
residues in their PIWI domains. Of these, OsAGO3,
OsAGO5a, OsAGO5b and OsAGO15, are expressed specifically or preferentially in reproductive tissues. Absence of
catalytic amino acids could inhibit the processing of target
RNA by endonucleolytic cleavage in these proteins. These
proteins could, therefore, require accessory factors for
mediating mRNA turnover. However, it has been reported
that an aspartate at the third position of the catalytic triad
in related RNase proteins, Integrase and Tn5, can chelate
the divalent metal ions as efficiently as histidine residue
and restore the catalytic activity [32,33]. Accordingly,
AGO2 and AGO3 of rice and Arabidopsis that possess DDD
could still function as slicer components of silencing
effector complexes. In rice, while OsAGO2 is ubiquitously
expressed, OsAGO3 along with OsAGO14, OsAGO13 and
OsMEL1 are expressed specifically in reproductive tissues.
These genes can, therefore, be considered as candidate
genes regulating expression of endogenous genes via RNA
interference that may or may not involve cleavage of target
RNA as their mode of activity.
In rice, knockout studies by three groups have provided
insights into the functions of three OsAGO genes,
OsMEL1, SHL4/SHO2 and OsPNH1 [15,26,34]. OsMEL1
is a unique AGO protein that regulates meiosis in germ
cells and proper development of male and female gametes
by chromatin modification probably mediated by H3K9

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/451

methylation. Whether OsMEL1 directly interacts with regulatory small RNAs to bring about desired changes at the
chromatin is not yet known. OsMEL1 also has a duplicated partner, OsAGO14, located on chromosome 7 that
does not show any expression in vegetative tissues and is
specifically expressed at stages beginning from P3 in panicles and until S2 stage in seeds. Furthermore, diversity in
their PAZ domains suggests that these two proteins could
interact with different classes of small RNAs, while retaining the mode of processing the target RNA by virtue of the
catalytic DDH motif in their PIWI domains.
The rice SHL4, SHL2 and SHO1 genes have been shown to
be involved in initiation and formation of SAM during
rice embryogenesis. This is mediated by miRNA and
tasiRNA regulation of homeodomain-leucine zipper (HDZIPIII) and ETT/ARF gene families [26]. OsPNH1, is the
third gene whose functional analysis revealed that it
affects the development of SAM and leaf development
[34]. This gene is closely related to OsAGO1.
Rice RDR genes in panicle development
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are the regulatory components of RNAi machinery, which enhance the potency
of RNAi by amplifying the aberrant RNA population [35].
These proteins are required for both cytoplasmic gene
silencing that is triggered by transgenes or viral infection,
as well as, nuclear gene silencing for transposons and
inverted repeats in the genome. In Arabidopsis, 6 genes
encode RDRs out of which only 3 genes have been shown
to be involved in viral defense, chromatin silencing and
PTGS. RDR6, also known as SGS2 and SDE1 amplifies
improper terminated and unpolyadenylated RNAs generated from transgenes or inverted repeats to trigger degradation of complementary RNA species [36]. Genetic
studies in Arabidopsis have also revealed that RDR6 functions in the same pathway as AGO7 and Asymmetric leaves
1 and 2 (AS1 and AS2) to control adaxial/abaxial patterning in leaves [37]. This role of RDR6 appears to be evolutionarily conserved in dicot and monocot lineages as in
rice it was recently reported that SHL2 along with SHL4,
and SHO1 affect siRNA and tasiRNA mediated regulation
of endogenous genes involved in SAM and leaf development [26]. Arabidopsis RDR2 is required for combating
viral infection through PTGS and is involved in siRNA
mediated de novo methylation of direct repeats. Recently,
it has been shown that the homolog of Arabidopsis RDR2
in maize, MOP1, is involved in paramutation of b1 locus
[38]. The MOP1 gene maintains a threshold level of RNA
encoded by repeat sequences that modify chromatin at b1
locus. This gene is also closely related to OsRDR2. The role
of OsRDR2 is not known yet, however its expression was
observed to overlap with Arabidopsis RDR2 at earlier stages
of flower development and it phylogenetically relates to

both maize and Arabidopsis genes. It will therefore be
interesting to study the role of this gene in rice to validate
the speculation of conservation of their roles, based on
their similar expression patterns, in dicots and monocots.

Conclusion
Regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional level
plays a critical role in plant development. RNA interference mediated by activities of Dicers, Argonautes and
RNA-dependent RNA polymerases is an important regulatory process that checks transcript accumulation in cells.
These components are also shared by other gene-silencing
pathways. Dicer-like, Argonautes and RDRs are encoded
by small multigene families and rice encodes the largest
number of these genes among the plant species analyzed
so far. Phylogenetic analysis and localization on rice pseudomolecules have revealed that duplication of genes,
both segmental and tandem, have contributed to increase
in number of these genes in rice. However, function of
only a few of these genes has been established in both rice
and Arabidopsis. A key objective of this study was to generate and compile an expression profile data set to facilitate
selection of candidate genes for validation of their roles
during reproductive phase of plant development and abiotic stress responses. More than 20 genes belonging to
these three gene families were observed to express preferentially/specifically during panicle and seed development. This work has provided insights into the probable
domains of activity of these genes.

Methods
Identification of genes, chromosomal localization and
phylogenetic analysis
Name search and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis
was employed to search for Dicer-like, Argonautes and
RDRs genes encoded in the rice genome. The sequences
were downloaded from TIGR, release 5 http://
www.tigr.org. An HMM profile was generated using
HMMER 2.1.1 software package http://hmmer.jane
lia.org/ which was then used to search the proteome database of rice available at TIGR using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, BLAST with filter off. Amino acid
sequences of all the rice genes were downloaded and conserved domains were searched using the Simple Modular
Architecture Research Tool (SMART) version 3.4 or
National Center for Biotechnology Information Conserved Domain Database, NCBI-CD [39]. The newly identified genes in this study were named on lines of
nomenclature used for the previously identified genes and
on the basis of their phylogenetic relatedness to other
members of the same family. ORF length, and details of
encoded proteins (length, PI, molecular weight) were
downloaded from TIGR. For proteins whose molecular
weight and PI was not available in TIGR, Gene Runner
program version 3.04 was used to calculate the same.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/451

Genes were localized on the chromosomes based on their
chromosomal positions on psedudomolecules as mentioned in TIGR. For phylogenetic analysis, total protein
sequences were downloaded from TIGR and aligned using
ClustalX 1.83 program. An unrooted neighbor-joining
tree was constructed in ClustalX using default parameters
[40]. Bootstrap analysis was performed using 1000 replicates.
Plant material
Plant tissue for all the panicle and seed stages as well as
mature leaf and Y-leaf was collected from field grown rice
plants (Oryza sativa ssp. indica var. IR64). Rice seedlings
were subjected to abiotic stress treatments, viz. salt,
drought and cold as described previously [27].
Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis
Affymetrix GeneChip® Rice Genome Arrays representing
49,824 rice transcripts were used to prepare a compendium of transcriptome profiles for 22 stages of vegetative
and reproductive development and stress response in rice.
Of these, microarray analysis of 17 stages was described
previously [27]; deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information under the series accession numbers GSE6893
and GSE6901). Here, five more stages viz, Y-leaf, SAM
(shoot apical meristem), P1-I (< 2 mm panicle), P1-II (0.2
to 0.5 mm panicle) and P1-III (5 to 10 mm panicle) have
been added to emphasize changes in gene expression patterns during initial stages of panicle differentiation and
floral primodia emergence in addition to stages of floral
organ- and seed development. Total RNA from these five
stages was isolated by using TRIzol method (Invitrogen
Inc., USA; [18]). After checking the quality on agarose formaldehyde gels, the RNA samples were quantified using
spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Nanodrop). Five micrograms of RNA with 260:280 ratios of 1.9–2.0 and 260:230
ratios more than 2.0 was used for cDNA synthesis. Labeling and hybridizations were carried out according to
Affymetrix manual for one-cycle target labeling (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization was performed in
GeneChip® Hybridization Oven 640 for 16 hours at 45°C
and 60 rpm. GeneChips were washed and stained with
streptavidin-phycoerythrin using the fluidics protocol
EukGE_WS2V5_450 in Affymetrix fluidic station model
450. Finally, chips were scanned using the Gene-Chip®
Scanner 3000-6G.

Sixty six cell intensity (CEL) files generated by GeneChip
Operating Software (GCOS) were further analyzed using
Arrayassist™ version 5.0 (Stratagene, La Jolla). Data were
normalized using GC-RMA algorithm and log2 transformed. To get the expression values, averages of three
biological replicates were used. The expression data for
Dicer-like, Argonaute and RDR genes was extracted by

Page 15 of 17

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:451

using unique probe-set IDs mentioned for each gene in
TIGR. Wherever more than one probe set was available for
one gene, the probe set designed from 3' end was given
preference. Cluster analysis on rows of expression values
was performed by using Euclidean distance metric, and
Ward's Linkage rule of hierarchical clustering. Differential
expression analysis was performed by taking mature leaf
as reference to identify genes expressing at more than twofold level in different stages of reproductive development
(panicle and seed), with p-values ≤ 0.05. Similarly, for
identifying stress-induced genes, differential expression
analysis was performed by taking seedling as reference
with no correction applied and p-values less ≤ 0.05 [see
Additional file 3]. Since the Affymetrix microarrays used
in this study did not contain probes representing
OsAGO15, data for this gene was extracted from rice MPSS
database http://mpss.udel.edu/rice.

Arabidopsis expression analysis
To analyze the expression of Arabidopsis genes, Affymetrix
GeneChip® ATH1 Genome Array data for 21 stages (55 .cel
files) comparable to that used for rice were downloaded
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at the
NCBI under the series accession numbers GSE5620,
GSE5621, GSE5623, GSE5624, GSE5629, GSE5630,
GSE5631, GSE5632 and GSE5634. The data were
imported in ArrayAssist™ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) microarray analysis software wherein GCRMA algorithm was
used for normalization and Log2transformation. [see
Additional file 4]. The downstream processing and generation of heat maps for selected genes was as described for
rice.
QPCR analysis
Real time PCR reactions were carried out by using the
same RNA samples, which were used for microarrays as
described earlier [27]. In brief, primers were designed
preferentially from 3' end of the genes by using PRIMER
EXPRESS version 2.0 (PE Applied Biosystems, USA) with
default parameters. Each primer was checked by using
BLAST tool for homology with other regions of the
genome. 4 μg of total RNA was used for first strand cDNA
synthesis in 100 μl reaction volume by using high-capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). Diluted
cDNA samples were used for Real time PCR analysis with
200 nM of each primer mixed with SYBR Green PCR master by using ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System
and software (PE Applied Biosystems, USA). Actin was
used as endogenous control to normalize the variance
among samples. Relative expression values were calculated after normalizing against the maximum expression
value. These data were further normalized with the normalized expression values obtained from microarrays and
bar charts plotted by using Microsoft Excel.
