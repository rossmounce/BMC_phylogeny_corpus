genome of Escherichia coli K12 showed that nearly 30% of the
coding sequences could be grouped into gene families that
were similar enough to be assigned similar functions [3,4].

implicit assumption that their similarity reflected similar evolutionary descent, but actual or potential functional divergence. Since then, the presence of gene families typically

One of the unexpected revelations of prokaryotic genomes
has been the existence of significant gene redundancy. The
existence of multiple gene copies in eukaryotes has been
known for a long time and is considered an important element in their molecular evolution [1,2]. In pre-genomic
times, however, bacteria were considered to be streamlined
cells that carried very little, if any, redundant information in

interactions

Conclusions: The remarkable preservation of copy numbers in widely different ecotypes indicates
a functional role for the different copies rather than simply a back-up role. When different genera
are compared, the increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization disrupts this
preservation, albeit in a gradual manner and maintaining an overall similarity, which also supports
this view. HGT can have an important role, however, in nonhomologous gene families, as
exemplified by a comparison between saprophytic and enterohemorrhagic strains of Escherichia coli.

refereed research

Results: The relative content of paralogous genes in bacterial genomes increases with genome
size, largely due to the expansion of gene family size in large genomes. Bacteria undergoing genome
reduction display a parallel process of redundancy elimination, by which gene families are reduced
to one or a few members. Gene family size is also influenced by sequence divergence and
physiological function. Large gene families show wider sequence divergence, suggesting they are
probably older, and certain functions (such as metabolite transport mechanisms) are
overrepresented in large families. The size of a given gene family is remarkably similar in strains of
the same species and in closely related species, suggesting that homologous gene families are
vertically transmitted and depend little on horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

containing between two and 30 copies has been described for
nearly every prokaryotic genome sequenced. The number of
paralogous genes and families appears to correlate well with
an increase in genome size [5,6]. The relative contribution of
these genes in each genome seems to be independent of phylogenetic affiliation and, for a limited dataset, appears to
depend on genome size [7].

work on a more limited dataset [7]. We have also tried to identify other factors affecting the number of members in a family,
besides genome size, particularly sequence divergence, gene
function and species lifestyle.

Results and discussion
Gene family size in bacterial genomes

These gene families of diverse size and degree of similarity
remain an important and little explored feature of prokaryotes. In eukaryotic genomes they are generally taken as the
result of gene duplication. This would either supply the
required gene dosage or the raw material for adaptation by
mutation and selection acting on one of the copies that
diverges in properties or function [1,8]. In E. coli, a model
organism in which traditional genetics and physiology have
already allowed the unequivocal identification of more than
half of the coding genes, the role of paralog families (whatever
their origin) seems much more operational than in eukaryotes [4]. For example, the different members of a gene family
contribute the proper gene dosage or, most often, provide different specificities for similar chemical reactions or for other
processes such as transport of different molecules. Regarding
origin, duplication is not necessarily the only source for new
members of a gene family in prokaryotes. The gene pools are
known to vary enormously from one strain to another [9,10],
and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) acts as a powerful source
of innovation [11]. Therefore, HGT could provide gene families with members already divergent in sequence and function
[12]. In prokaryotes, gene families could be the result of
incomplete xenologous gene replacement by which a gene
from another genome gets incorporated into a gene family
with which it shares some sequence similarity. This process
would provide additional physiological plasticity, and studies
on the DNA composition of paralogous genes suggest that its
contribution might be substantial [13]. The divergence of
some of the members of the gene families or their DNA composition could be taken as evidence for a HGT origin [4]. It is
unclear at the moment the extent to which each of these
genomic forces (gene duplication and HGT) contributes to
genome expansion and variability [5,14-16].
To address these issues we have compared the size of gene
families across bacterial taxa. To try to shed light on the evolutionary origin of these initially redundant genes we have
studied the distribution of gene family size among completed
genomes of strains within the same bacterial species and over
larger taxonomic distances. If the different family members
were acquired by HGT their numbers will vary widely among
different strains, as already detected for single genes in adaptive islands [17] or for whole families predicted to have been
transferred as a whole [18]. On the other hand, if the family
numbers are similar in different strains, vertical descent or a
very old HGT will be a more likely origin. We have also determined the contribution of paralogous families to genome size
for all 127 available eubacterial genomes, updating earlier

Previous work on a more reduced set of sequenced genomes
had determined that large genomes contain more paralogs
and more gene families than smaller genomes [7]. Jordan and
collaborators also found a correlation between the fraction of
the genome occupied by gene families and the genome size;
that is, larger genomes had a larger proportion of redundant
genes. However, at the time of that analysis, the sequences of
genomes larger than 5 million base pairs (5 Mbp) were not
available. Now, the inclusion of genomes nearly twice as large
confirms both trends (Figure 1): for example, nearly 50% of
the genome is occupied by paralogous genes in Streptomyces
coelicolor. A closer look at these data shows that larger
genomes have larger gene families, as the average family size
also increases with genome size (Figure 1, inset). Thus, the
higher percentage of paralogs in large genomes is partly due
to the expansion of existing gene families, together with a
larger number of new families. The large-genomed species at
one end of the distribution, such as Streptomyces, have gene
families of up to 85 members, whereas the largest gene families in middle-sized genomes such as those of E. coli or Salmonella have more moderate numbers (40-45). This is
reminiscent of the situation in eukaryotes, where the number
of gene families increases with the number of genes in the
genome at a lower rate than in prokaryotes [6], indicating
that gene families have many more members in the larger
eukaryotic genomes. Also consistent with this trend, some
reconstructions of prokaryotic genome evolution based on
gene content conclude that gene duplication has a critical role
in the expansion of genome size [15].
Exceptions to the linear correlation in this graph are interesting to consider. On one hand, Pirellula (marked as Pir in Figure 1) has an enormous genome with a surprisingly low
relative number of paralogs. This is due to an overrepresentation of small gene families and the absence of large ones (the
largest gene family contains 57 members; see Additional data
file 1). Pirellula is a marine bacterium and the reason for the
reduced gene family size might be the homogeneity of the
marine environment, in contrast to other large-genomed bacteria included in the graph which have the ability to survive in
many different niches or in much more heterogeneous habitats, such as soil. In agreement with this, Pirellula has a
greatly reduced number of transcriptional regulators, which
again might reflect a relatively constant environment [19]. At
the other end of the distribution, exceptions occur for three
species that have small genomes with a larger-than-expected
percentage of paralogs. All these species are mycoplasmas,
and the high percentage of paralogs is due to a few gene

In Shigella there is a clear reduction in gene family copy
number (Figure 2), which seems to be higher than would be
expected from the random location of IS elements, suggesting
that they might insert preferentially in gene family members.
Something similar is found in the case of M. leprae (Figure 3),
although in this case the main mechanism for gene inactivation is the generation of pseudogenes by mutation [27]. M.
leprae is closely related to M. tuberculosis, with which it

interactions

The data in Figure 1 cannot be viewed as a continuum,
because small genomes are not ancestral to bigger ones.
Instead, small genomes have been shown to be the result of
reductive evolution, a process by which a larger-sized ancestor changes niche and undergoes a dramatic loss of DNA
[22,23]. Both small and large genome fragments can be eliminated but the outcome of this process for gene families has

not been documented. We have compared the number of
members per gene family in two genomes that are undergoing
rapid reductive evolution - Shigella flexneri 2a and Mycobacterium leprae TN - with larger-genomed close relatives (Figure 2). Shigella is a close relative of E. coli that has specialized
in living as a human pathogen [24,25]. As a result of the
expansion of the human population from Neolithic times a
number of more generalistic or opportunistic pathogens
found a new niche; Salmonella typhi might be a similar
example [26]. In both cases there is a clear tendency to
genome reduction accompanied by expansion of IS families
(314 and 46 IS elements, respectively).

families that are greatly expanded, including more than 25
members. In Mycoplasma penetrans, for example, these
families include surface-exposed lipoproteins involved in
antigenic variation [20], which are critical to the success of
microbes exposed to the immune system of their hosts. On
the other hand, the small genomes of other pathogenic bacteria correspond to intracellular parasites that do not need to
evade the immune system [21], and these species show the
smallest portion of paralogs. Finally, the largest gene families
that we detected were those involving mobile genetic elements such as the IS elements of Shigella flexneri, where families surpassed 100 members (not included in the inset of
Figure 1).

information

Another feature we could detect in the evolution of gene families was that large families were more divergent (Figure 3).
This could partly be due to a side-effect of the higher variability of a larger sample size or to misidentification of family
members at low sequence identity levels. However, given the
observed similarity of functions in these large families ([4,28]
and R.P., A.M. and F.R-V., unpublished results), a substantial
proportion must be true paralogous genes. Thus, this relationship can be interpreted as older (more divergent) families

shares many homologous sequences. However, most gene
families have been simplified in the short time period in
which the leprosy bacillus has adopted its mainly intracellular
lifestyle. This also illustrates the fact that, as described above,
an early step in genome reduction allowed by intracellular
parasitism or a narrower range of hosts is the shrinkage of
gene families. It shows that the smaller percentage of paralogs in reduced genomes is probably due to simplification of
existing gene families. A similar pattern was found in the
small-genomed intracellular species Rickettsia and Buchnera
when compared with free-living species of the same taxonomic group (see Additional data file 2). Thus, both genome

containing more members. Smaller families range from those
with very similar members to those in which the members are
very different. The latter probably represent either old families in which new members have not evolved because new
duplications do not confer a selective advantage, or more
recent incomplete xenologous replacements.

Gene family size in intraspecific and interspecific
comparisons
The sequencing of several strains of a single species is now
common in bacterial genomics. One of the most remarkable
findings has been the different gene pools carried by strains
that are highly similar if their housekeeping genes only are
compared. For example, different virotypes of E. coli were
shown to contain very different gene complements, with large
pools of genes characteristic of each virotype [10]. Obvious
candidates to vary would be multigene families. Thus, the
comparison of the numbers of members within a single species might shed light in their origin. If the members of a gene
family are frequently acquired by HGT from outside, the
numbers should be expected to vary broadly in different lineages of the species (as a result of different acquisitions). On
the other hand, if the numbers are similar, that would indicate that the families were already present in the common
ancestor and represent a relatively stable feature of the
genome.
We selected distinct prokaryotic taxa in which three or more
strains have been fully sequenced (Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) and for each taxon established a list of
homologous genes common to all strains. The gene family to
which each homolog belonged was determined for each
strain, and the number of family members compared for
equivalent families (Figure 4). In all four species considered,
the different strains showed a remarkably similar pattern of
gene family size distributions: large gene families in one
strain were also expanded in the others; small families were
small, regardless of strain or virotype. Caution has to be exercised when examining these plots, as a gene can be a member
of more than one gene family. However, although some of the
gene families in Figure 4 are redundant, the parallel size pattern of gene families across strains is remarkably clear and
seems to reflect a stable feature of the genome. Thus, the
majority of gene families were most likely to have been
formed by ancestral gene duplications or ancient gene transfers common to all strains. In addition, the preservation of
gene family size in different strains strongly suggests that
most family members have a high value for survival; redundant copies would otherwise be quickly eliminated.
We have obviously not excluded the possibility that nonhomologous gene families add to the differences among the
compared genomes. For example, in a pairwise comparison
between E. coli K12 and E. coli O157:H7, 186 genes belonging
to paralog families were unique to K12 and 788 to O157:H7,

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/4/R27

versus 403 singletons (single-copy genes not belonging to
families) unique to K12 and 883 to O157:H7. Thus, K12 keeps
the same standard proportion of 30% paralogs for the differential gene pool. In O157:H7, on the other hand, paralogs
account for 47% of the set of unique genes. The interpretation
might be that the large islands that characterize the genome
of the enterohemorrhagic virotype tend to carry a bigger proportion of families than the rest of the genome. Thus, it is possible that in some strains, HGT may contribute to expand and
generate gene families that do not appear as homologs in
closely related genomes. For example, 146 genes belonging to
families of 10 or more members were detected in the O157:H7
differential pool, including three whole families of 14, 17 and
20 members with a G+C content of 57, 54 and 53%,
respectively (the average G+C content in E. coli O157:H7 is
50.6%). The largest differential family in K12 had 11 members, which were not present in the enterohemorrhagic strain,
and had a G+C content of 54.1% (the average G+C content of
E. coli K12 is 50.5%).
To investigate whether the conservation in the size of homologous families was maintained across more divergent
genomes, gene family plots were performed between species.
A representative case for a Gram-negative (Pseudomonas)
and a Gram-positive (Bacillus) comparison is illustrated in
Figure 5. The preservation of family size was still remarkable,
although, in the case of Pseudomonas, the number of orthologous genes is considerable smaller. The overall pattern of
family sizes is preserved across these species. The two Bacillus species considered have the same genome size and one
species contains larger numbers in some families but fewer in
others (Figure 5b). The same trend was found in comparisons
between species of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Salmonella and Mycoplasma (data not shown). It is also interesting
to analyze the variation detected. Part of it can be attributed
to differences in genome size. Pseudomonas syringae is
approximately 200 kb larger than its other sequenced partners, which have mostly smaller gene families. However, part
of the variability is also due to intrinsic differences between
the species. For example, P. syringae contains some large
gene families involved in invasion of the plant host and in
pathogenesis [29]. One way to examine whether this variation
can underlie the phenotypic/ecological characteristics of a
given species is to visualize the size difference of each paralog
group for some representative cases.
Figure 5c shows the difference in gene family size in the interspecific comparison of E. coli K12 and S. typhimurium LT2.
Both strains have similarly sized genomes (S. typhimurium is
218 kb larger) and a relatively high level of homology (3,026
orthologous genes). Of these, there are 572 homologs belonging to families that differ in size between the two genomes,
and 435 belonging to families having the same number of
members in both species. The rest are single-copy genes in
both genomes. Forty-eight families were significantly larger
(two or more extra copies) in E. coli, while 53 were larger in

Of course, with the number of genomes available presently
there is a certain representation bias, with a large input from
human pathogens. Among these, small genomes often correspond to intracellular forms that are protected from the
immune system of the host. Variability of antigen specificity
is one paradigmatic case that justifies gene familes in extracellular pathogens of vertebrates, for example the PPE genes
of Mycobacterium [28] and the Pap adhesins in E. coli [36].
The exceptional case of the mycoplasmas points in this direction as they possess small genomes but are extracellular
mucosa-associated pathogens, and hence subjected to the
host immune system [37]. At the other end of the genome size

refereed research

In eukaryotic genomes, a cornerstone of gene creation is
extension of paralogous families by gene duplication [2]. This
is reflected in the slow increase of new gene families with
genome size, which does correlate with an increase in the size
of the families [6]. The importance of DNA duplication in
eukaryotes is probably also favored by the limitations of HGT
in this group [35]. Despite the pervasiveness of HGT in
prokaryotes, the increase in gene families with genome size is
also robust (Figure 1). One obvious fact contributing to this
situation might be that the pool of essential genes that have to
be present for basic cell biology represents a larger percentage
of a smaller genome, restricting the contribution of
redundant genes with related functions and thus more
expendable. However, this does not explain the high level of
correlation maintained at the larger end of the range.

individual genomes. Figure 6 shows such a distribution for
two species, one Gram-negative (E. coli K12) and the other
Gram-positive (B. subtilis). For E. coli, in which a large proportion of genes has been allocated a function, families with
more than five members contain fewer unknown or hypothetical genes than do smaller families, and the distribution of
functions among categories is unequal, with certain categories being overrepresented. Among these, genes involved in
transport of different metabolites predominate (39% of the
total), followed by those with transcription and replication/
repair functions. In genes that do not belong to a family, however, most functional categories are equally represented and
a large proportion of these singletons have an unknown function. The overrepresentation of unknown or hypothetical
open reading frames (ORFs) could, in part, be due to many of
these singletons not being real genes, as supported by their
shorter length when compared to genes belonging to families.
In the gamma-proteobacteria, for example, average singleton
length is 127 nucleotides less than in genes belonging to families. It is also interesting to note that the phylogenetic distribution of these unknown singletons is not different from that
of unknown paralogs (see Additional data file 4). In conclusion, some functions do appear to be more prone to develop
families, although the functions overrepresented in a particular species may depend on its lifestyle.

Do certain functions predispose genes to form families? Do
single genes that do not form families belong to a different
category? To address these questions, extended gene families
were identified, where a gene was not allowed to belong to
more than one family. Thus, if gene A matched gene B, and
gene B matched C, but A did not match C, all three were considered part of the same family, as it is likely that they are all
evolutionarily derived from each other [34]. This method of
transitive assembly of paralogs has been confirmed to
include, in most cases, genes with related functions [4]. We
found that, for all 127 sequenced species, singletons (genes in
a single copy in a given genome) were massively overrepresented by genes with an unknown or hypothetical function.
When only genes with a known or predicted function were
included, these single genes without paralogs appeared
equally distributed among the different functional categories.
However, when genes belonging to families, especially large
ones, were considered, a significant fraction had particular
functions, such as transport of metabolites (data not shown).
These data are, however, probably unrealistic because they
represent the distribution of genes in sequenced genomes
only, and certain species are overrepresented. In addition,
larger genomes will also weigh more in this comparison than
small genomes, as will species with several sequenced strains.
We did, however, find relatively uniform results for

Salmonella. These differences can be taken as an example of
the evolution of gene families in two diverging groups.
Although the natural history of these model bacteria is not as
well known as might be expected, it is generally believed that
both Salmonella and Escherichia are mostly saprophytic facultative anaerobes that inhabit the intestine of vertebrates.
The divergence between these two microbes arose after the
origin of mammals around 120 million years ago. E. coli specialized as a commensal and an opportunistic pathogen of
mammals, as witnessed, for example, by its ability to degrade
lactose. On the other hand, Salmonella remains as a commensal in reptiles, with some serotypes colonizing mammals,
but as a pathogen rather than a commensal and after developing strategies for intracellular invasion of the host [30,31].
Accepting this scenario, the fact that many gene families (and
the number of members of each family) are preserved reflects
a significant involvement in the saprophytic intestinal
lifestyle, preserved over many millions of years. On the other
hand, significant differences are starting to arise between the
two species, perhaps reflecting their specialization in different hosts and lifestyles [32]. A dramatic example is the potG
gene family, which has 13 more members in S. typhimurium
than in E. coli (Figure 5). This is an ATP-binding component
of spermidine/putrescine transport and for some reason its
amplification has been selected in this species. Proteins
involved in the transport of spermidine and putrescine have
been shown to be involved in attachment to host cells and
virulence [33]. Therefore, the size of this gene family might
reflect the more pathogenic lifestyle of Salmonella.

Proportions of assigned functions among genes belonging to families and singletons in B. subtilis and E. coli K12

Proportions of assigned functions among genes belonging to families and singletons in B. subtilis and E. coli K12. Gene functions were assigned according to

range there are many more free-living, saprophytic or opportunistic pathogens, a lifestyle that requires a highly versatile
gene complement in order to survive, for example, both inside
and outside a host. Again, the one exception is a single large-

genome species from a relatively stable environment (Pirellula, which lives in the open ocean). Here, the possibility to
carry out many different physiological activities is probably
more advantageous than the ability to adapt the same activity

sequence in all the other genomes. We then recorded the best
reciprocal hit for each protein sequence with an E-value lower
than 10-5 and sequence identity higher than 50% over more
than 60% of the length. To validate the results, we performed
some representative comparisons by studying the distribution of the ratio of bit score to the maximal bit score [41]. This
method would separate probable homology from random
similarity. We obtained almost identical results, with only a
reduced set of the respective homologous genes being different in the two lists. For example, out of 3,026 homolog pairs
between E. coli K12 and S. typhimurium detected by the
reciprocal hit method, only one pair was found to differ with
the bit score method. In addition, only three genes were
detected with the reciprocal best-hit method that were not
selected as homologs using the bit score method (using a cutoff value of 0.4). Finally, the bit-score ratio method identified
165 additional homologs that were not selected using reciprocal best-hits because they did not satisfy the length and/or
sequence-identity requirements. Therefore, the list of homologous genes obtained by reciprocal best-hits was used for all
the analyses.

information

The protein sequences of the 127 completely sequenced
eubacterial genomes at the time this paper was submitted for
publication were retrieved from the Genome division, Entrez
retrieval system of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI; [39]). Table 1 shows a list with all the
genomes used, with their genome size and accession numbers. To detect potentially homologous genes we started by
carrying out an all-against-all BLASTP [40] search of every
protein sequence in one genome against every protein

When comparing paralogs between two species, a gene family
was created for each homologous gene detected in both
genomes. This gave rise to some redundant families but
ensured that the comparison between species was done
between equivalent gene families. To describe the functional
assignment of paralogous genes, extended gene families were
created [3] that contained all genes that were interrelated by
hits among any of their members. This is based on the transitive nature of sequence homology [34] and is supported by
the findings on well-studied genomes of species with a relatively well-known metabolism. In these cases, extended gene
families seem to be formed by genes involved in similar functions [4]. To minimize the incorporation of multidomain proteins in a family together with unrelated members [2], length
cut-offs were kept at 60%. The assignment of a function to a
gene was based on the Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(COGs) classification [42].

refereed research

Materials and methods

To detect potential paralogous genes, we carried out an allagainst-all BLASTP [40] search of every protein sequence in
a genome against every protein sequence in the same genome.
We define paralogs as protein sequences satisfying an E-value
threshold of 10-5 in BLASTP [40] search and having at least
30% sequence identity over more than 60% of their lengths
[3].

deposited research

Genomic evolution simulations concluded that the amount of
gene duplication is independent of HGT levels [15]. On the
basis of these simulations, an upper limit of 20% was estimated for paralogs of xenologous origin. Assuming that the
extra members of a gene family from our paralog plots represent an upper limit of HGT for established families, we calculate that gene transfer accounts for a maximum of 11% of a
given family in E. coli (Figure 4c). However, this does not take
into account families that are unique to a given strain and that
may have a xenologous origin. The fact that these families are
not included in the paralog plots (which display only homolog
pairs between strains) suggests that they can represent transfers to a given strain. Thus, the paralog plots present a picture
of stability and limited xenologous genes for already established families, but this is not inconsistent with the transfer of
families that appear to be unique to a given strain or species.
It could, theoretically, be more probable that gene families
expand by horizontal transfers than by gene duplication [12].
This way, xenologous genes would already confer a functionally distinct role and would avoid the neutrality period in
which redundant gene copies coexist and can be eliminated
[38]. The results shown here suggest that the overrepresentation of duplications among transferred genes found by
Hooper and Berg [13] might be a feature of these specific families but not of more ancient, homologous ones.

to a wider range of conditions. Thus, as with other aspects of
biology, the genomic properties of bacteria appear to be
greatly conditioned by their specialist or generalist lifestyle.
The comparison of gene family size among strains from a single species shows a remarkable level of conservation, even
when genome sizes are very different. This conservation indicates that gene family size is probably an ancestral feature
rather than reflecting the acquisition of paralogs by HGT.
This is consistent with evolutionary models based on bacterial gene content, which concluded that most protein gene
families are transmitted by vertical inheritance [16]. The conservation that is detected even among more distantly related
taxa strengthens this view, as in mostly free-living and very
niche-diversified species such as Pseudomonas, there is a
remarkable degree of conservation. This might reflect
involvement of the gene families in more fundamental (less
environment-dependent) processes of cell biology.
