Abstract
Background: RNA editing and alternative splicing play an important role in expanding protein
diversity and this is well illustrated in studies of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs).
Results: Here, we compare the RNA editing and alternative splicing of the nAChR alpha6 subunit
genes from different insects spanning ~300 million years of evolution– Drosophila melanogaster,
Anopheles gambiae, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum and Apis mellifera. The conserved and speciesspecific A-to-I RNA editing occurred across all species except A. gambiae, which displayed
extraordinarily short flanking intronic sequences. Interestingly, some A-to-I editing sites were a
genomically encoded G in other species. A combination of the experimental data and
computational analysis of orthologous alpha6 genes from different species indicated that RNA
editing and alternative splicing predated at least the radiation of insect orders spanning ~300 million
years of evolution; however, they might have been lost in some species during subsequent
evolution. The occurrence of alternative splicing was found to be regulated in distinct modes and,
in some cases, even correlated with RNA editing.
Conclusion: On the basis of comparative analysis of orthologous nAChR alpha6 genes from
different insects spanning ~300 million years of evolution, we have documented the existence,
evolutionary conservation and divergence, and also regulation of RNA editing and alternative
splicing. Phylogenetic analysis of RNA editing and alternative splicing, which can create a multitude
of functionally distinct protein isoforms, might have a crucial role in the evolution of complex
organisms beyond nucleotide and protein sequences.

Background
RNA editing is a process that results in the synthesis of
proteins that are not directly encoded in the genome. One
type of RNA editing involves the modification of individ-

ual adenosine bases to inosine in RNA by ADAR enzymes
(adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) [1,2]. Because
inosine acts as guanosine during translation, A-to-I conversion in coding sequences leads to amino acid changes

and often entails changes in protein function [2-4]. A-to-I
RNA editing is common in animals and is associated with
various neurological functions [3,4]. Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus mutants
lacking ADAR enzymes display predominantly distinct
neurological phenotypes [5-8]. In addition to amino acid
changes, the editing and subsequent destabilization of the
RNA duplex present in the 5' or 3'-untranslated regions
(UTRs) could alter the stability, transport or translation of
the mRNA [2,9]. Moreover, RNA editing may influence
alternative splicing decisions [10].
Alternative splicing is a major contributor to transcriptomic and proteomic complexity, disease, and development. Alternative splicing may affect the protein sequence
in two ways: (i) by deleting or inserting a sequence and
creating long and short isoforms, or (ii) by substituting
one segment of the amino acid sequence for another [11].
An indication for the first pathway is that truncated isoforms often act as dominant-negative regulators of the
full-length isoform's activities [12,13]. In contrast, the second mode is capable of creating, from mutually exclusive
alternative sequences, a multitude of functionally distinct
protein isoforms and thus might have a crucial role in the
evolution of complex organisms [11]. As both RNA editing and alternative splicing can lead to the inclusion of
alternative amino acid sequences into proteins, functionally distinct isoforms are likely to be generated [14].
Therefore, editing and alternative splicing provide a powerful posttranscriptional means for fine-tuning of gene
expression at the cellular and organismal levels.
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate the
fast actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh)
in both vertebrates and invertebrates [15]. An extraordinary feature of the insect nAChR genes is that they can
potentially create many different mRNAs by RNA editing
and alternative splicing. More than 30,000 alpha6 nAChR
isoforms are theoretically possible through RNA editing
and alternative splicing, without considering any linkage
between these events [16]. The alternatively spliced exons
are organized into two clusters. The exon 3 and 8 clusters
contain 2 and 3 alternative versions, respectively [16].
Seven adenosines could be modified in D. melanogaster
alpha6, four of which are also edited in the alpha6
ortholog in the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens.
However, although these RNA A-to-I editing sites are conserved between D. melanogaster and H. virescens, they are
not shared with the equivalent nAChR subunit of Anopheles, which is considered to be an example of convergent
evolution [17]. It is possible that different alpha6 isoforms may interact with distinct sets of receptor guidance
cues. RNA editing and alternative splicing of the nAChR
alpha6 pre-mRNA may therefore be central to the mecha-

nisms specifying transmitter affinity, channel conductance and ion selectivity.
The recently sequenced genomes of 12 Drosophila species
[18], the mosquito A. gambiae [19], the silkworm B. mori
[20], the honeybee A. mellifera [21], and T. castaneum [18]
have renewed interest in molecular and functional diversity in the insect nAChR alpha6 gene. Recent analysis
reveals bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) are at the base of
the radiation of Holometabolous insects [22,23]. Here,
we compare the RNA editing and alternative splicing of
the nAChR alpha6 gene from these insects spanning ~300
million years of evolution. These sequence comparisons
provide insight into the evolution of the nAChR alpha6
gene and indicate that many isoforms have arisen by RNA
editing and alternative splicing events. These findings also
suggest that expressing a diverse nAChR alpha6 repertoire
is more important than the actual sequence of each isoform. In this article, we describe the A-to-I RNA editing
and alternative splicing found in insect nAChR alpha6
genes, as well as their evolutionary conservation and
divergence, and regulation. In addition, we provide an
example of a strong correlation between RNA editing and
alternative splicing.

Results
Comparison of the nAChR subunit alpha6 genes from
different insect species
To obtain insight into the functional diversity, the regulation of expression, and the evolution of nAChR alpha6,
we have compared the sequence of the nAChR alpha6
genes in Drosophila to other species. The organisms analyzed consisted of 13 Dipteran species, including 12 Drosophila species (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia,
D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis and D. grimshawi) and one mosquito (A. gambiae), the Lepidopteran
B. mori (silkworm), the Coleopteran T. castaneum (red
flour beetle) and the Hymenopteran A. mellifera (honeybee). The sequences from these species allowed us to analyze the evolution of the nAChR alpha6 gene over at least
300 million years and across phylogenetic orders. The
overall organization of the nAChR alpha6 genes of these
insect species is quite similar, but there are a few subtle
differences. The nAChR alpha6 genes possess two versions
for exon 3 in most species, while no such tandem duplication of coding exon 3 can be found in the A. mellifera
genome. Although nAChR alpha6 genes have three versions for exon 8 in most species, only two alternatives for
the equivalent exon are observed in the A. gambiae and B.
mori genomes.

We next analyzed the evolutionary relationship of the
alternative exons from D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, B.
mori, T. castaneum and A. mellifera nAChR alpha6 genes.

For these analyses we used D. melanogaster as the representative Drosophila species. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that A. mellifera did not contain an ortholog to the
second alternative exon 3 while B. mori and A. gambiae
lacked an ortholog to the first alternative exon 8[17,24]
(Figure 1). The orthologs to the second alternative exon 8
were very highly conserved, with all amino acid sequences
identical (Figure 1), although they are not highly conserved at the nucleotide level. The hierarchy of amino acid
conservation of the alternative exons 8 of nAChR subunit
alpha6 genes was exon 8b > exon 8a > exon 8c. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein products of equivalent duplicated exons showed that members of a duplicated pair
were more similar to each other than to the exons from
other genes (Figure 1). This evidence suggests that exon

duplication predated at least the radiation of insect orders
spanning ~300 million years of evolution.
We next analyzed the evolutionary relationship of the
alternative exons within the Drosophila species. All three
exon 8 variants had orthologs in each species. All three
exon 8 orthologs were very highly conserved in these species, and were identical at the amino acid level. Surprisingly, the orthologs to the alternative exon 8b were
identical even at the nucleotide level. We determined a
similar hierarchy of nucleotide conservation of the alternative exons 8 of nAChR subunit alpha6 genes within the
Drosophila species, namely exon 8b > exon 8a > exon 8c.
Conservation and divergence of alternative splicing
We were interested in understanding the alternative splicing of the nAChR alpha6 transcripts and in particular
whether this is regulated. We first analyzed how the alternative exons 3 were regulated. The vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons (99.4%) are likely to be involved
in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events [14]. The
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) showed a very clear band in D. melanogaster and T.
castaneum adult cDNA, as in A. mellifera with constitutive
exon 3 (Figure 2A). Direct sequencing of these amplification products confirmed that these duplicated exons were
alternatively spliced (Figure 2B). Sequence analysis of 30
cDNAs also showed that no duplicated exons were spliced
together. These results indicated that the vast majority of
exons were likely to be involved in mutually exclusive
alternative splicing, which was consistent with EST and
cDNA data analysis, although a duplicate of exon 3 was
even found in cDNA [16].

The RT-PCR showed a distinct pattern in B. mori (Figure
2A), not seen in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum. Total
silkworm RNA harvested from silkworms at various stages
of development was used as a template for RT-PCR with
primers surrounding the exon 3 (Figure 3A). At the
embryo stage, only one band could be amplified, and
direct sequencing indicated a mixed sequence signal of
two nucleotides, confirming the existence of alternative
splicing of exon 3. The existence of alternative splicing in
the embryonic transcripts was further confirmed by independent sequencing of cloned cDNAs of RT-PCR products. This band, which resulted from type I and type II
alternative splicing, decreased slightly during development, exhibiting a very low level in the pupal and adult
stages (Figure 3B). However, another slightly larger band
appeared during development, displaying a very low level
in the larvae but increasing rapidly during the stages from
pupa to adult (Figure 3B). Sequencing of cloned cDNAs of
this product indicated the existence of splice type III alternative splicing, which included both alternative exons,
and retained the opening frame of the spliced RNA.

and BmDa-3-1 for B. mori, TcDa-5-1 and TcDa-3-1 for T. castaneum, respectively (Table 1). The migration positions of
PCR products corresponding to transcripts with one or two
alternative duplicated exon variants are indicated. Because
the sequence between the specific primers in T. castaneum is
smaller than in other species, its band is smaller. (B) Comparison of the boundary sequences of sites in exon 2 and alternative exons 3 among nAChR alpha6 orthologs of D.
melanogaster (Dme), B. mori (Bmo), T. castaneum (Tca) and A.
mellifera (Ame). Direct sequencing of these RT-PCR products (A) confirmed that these duplicated exons are alternatively spliced. Different nucleotides in the alternative exons
3a and 3b (in box) showed a mixed signal.

To elucidate how the alternative splicing patterns of exon
3 were developmentally regulated, we designed the specific primers based on three alternative variant cDNAs
(Figure 3A). Consequently, the expression of splice type I
and II appeared to be tightly regulated in a similar manner, exhibiting an abundant level in the embryo, and
decreasing slightly during the pupal stage to the adult
level. In contrast, the expression of splice type III showed
a distinct mode during development, exhibiting a very
low level in the embryo, and increasing rapidly during the
pupal stage to the adult level (Figure 3B). The expression
analysis using RT-PCR was consistent with the results
derived from RT-PCR clones (Figure 3C). Thus, the alternative splicing patterns of exon 3 in silkworm were different from the other insect species.
Next, to determine how the alternative exons 8 were regulated developmentally, we first performed RT-PCR on
RNA isolated from silkworm embryos, larvae, pupae and
adults by use of primers flanking exon 8. The identity of

the PCR product was confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Sequence analysis of transcripts, derived from different staged RNA independent amplification experiments,
indicated that only cDNAs containing exon 8b were
included, but no cDNA containing exon 8c was included.
This suggested that only exon 8b was spliced while exon
8c expression was very low in these developmental stages.
We next tested whether the selection pattern of exon 8
alternative splicing observed in silkworm was conserved
in D. melanogaster, T. castaneum and A. mellifera, where
nAChR subunit alpha6 has three versions for exon 8.
Interestingly, RT-PCR analysis revealed an identical hierarchy of selection efficiency among D. melanogaster,T. castaneum and A. mellifera: exon 8b > exon 8a > exon 8c
(Figure 4). Considering the identical trend between selection efficiency and conservation of alternative exons 8, it
is proposed that expression of alternative exons 8 might
be closely related with its conservation (Figure 4). This
phenomenon might reflect evolutionary trajectories and/
or differential functional constraints.
Evolutionary conservation and divergence of nAChR
alpha6 RNA editing
Similar to substitution alternative splicing, RNA editing
causes amino acid changes by substituting individual
nucleotides. Although RNA A-to-I editing occurred in Drosophila transcripts, it was not present in the equivalent
nAChR subunit of Anopheles [16,17]. To determine
whether orthologous nAChR subunits were also RNAedited in other insect species, we have subsequently analyzed the nAChR alpha6 genes from B. mori, T. castaneum
and A. mellifera. Several sites were either determined as
pure G signals, or as mixed sequence signals of G and A,
while the nucleotide in the reference genomic DNA was A
at these positions. We also checked for genetic variation in
these alpha6 regions, using PCR amplification on silkworm genomic DNA, applying primers surrounding the
equivalent regions and direct sequencing. As a result, it
was revealed that the nucleotide in genomic DNA was
adenosine at these positions, confirming that post-transcriptional modifications occur in this case. We have identified a total of ten A-to-I RNA editing sites within
silkworm alpha6 transcripts, seven of which are located in
exon 5 (Figure 5A). Sequence analysis of transcripts
showed that six amino acids could be changed by seven
possible A-to-G transitions in exon 5 (Figure 5B).

We have subsequently analyzed the nAChR alpha6 genes
from T. castaneum and A. mellifera. We demonstrated that
editing also occurred in both the alpha6 homolog of T.
castaneum and A. mellifera, with a quite different pattern of
editing (Figure 5, 6). These sites were originally discovered
through sequence analysis of cDNAs that were subsequently compared with genomic DNA. In each case, A was
observed in the genomic sequence with G at the corre-

sponding position in numerous cDNAs. A-to-I RNA editing occurred across the species except A. gambiae with its
extraordinarily short flanking intronic sequences (Figure
5, 6). There are up to 11 A-to-I RNA editing sites in A. mellifera. During the preparation of this paper, six A-to-I RNA
editing sites were found in A. mellifera [24], which were
identical with 6 of the 11 RNA editing sites in our experiment. The editing sites 5 and 10 in nAChR alpha6 were
conserved among the four orders of insect, represented by
D. melanogaster, B. mori, T. castaneum and A. mellifera (Figure 5). The RT-PCR clone data revealed that editing was
detectable at site 1 in B. mori and A. mellifera, as in Drosophila, albeit at a very low level. Site 4 was edited at low
levels in D. melanogaster, but almost completely edited in
B. mori, and undetectable in T. castaneum and A. mellifera.
Interestingly, site 3 was specifically edited in A. mellifera
but it constituted a genomically encoded G in other species. Sites 7 and 8 were markedly edited in A. mellifera,
while editing was undetectable in other species. In contrast, site 6 was edited in D. melanogaster, B. mori and T.
castaneum, but undetectable in A. mellifera (Figure 5).
Overall, editing sites and levels of the alpha6 homolog
differed among species, possessing conserved and speciesspecific editing sites in each species. However, this was the
most highly conserved RNA editing event yet reported in
invertebrates.

are shaded in red. Those sites constitutively G (A) and amino acids (B) are shaded in green at the editing sites. RNA editing
sites, which were not evidently detected as a mixed sequence signal G and A, but revealed by sequencing of cDNA clones, are
underlined.

Some A-to-I editing sites were a genomically encoded G in
other species
The nAChR subunit alpha6 genes were subject to RNA
editing in D. melanogaster, B. mori, T. castaneum and A.
mellifera. Interestingly, there were several examples in
which some A-to-I editing sites were a genomically
encoded G in some species. For example, the alpha6 site
13 was edited in B. mori and A. mellifera, while the site 13
in the alpha6 ortholog α7–2 in the tobacco budworm H.
virescens (Lepidoptera) was a genomically encoded G (Figure 5A). The site 3 was edited in A. mellifera, while the
homologous sites in A. gambiae, H. virescens, B. mori and
T. castaneum were a genomically encoded G (Figure 5A).
Similarly, the alpha6 site 2 was edited in Drosophila [16];
however, the alpha6 homologous sites in other species

were a genomically encoded G (Figure 5A). Although we
did not know how general this phenomenon was, this led
us to consider the possibility that RNA editing might act
as an evolutionary intermediate form between single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites, maintaining partial conservation at the protein and functional level
despite sequence divergence at the DNA level.
Correlation between RNA editing and alternative splicing
The vast majority of tandemly duplicated exons (99.4%)
are likely to be involved in mutually exclusive alternative
splicing events [14]. The alternative splicing patterns of
the duplicated exon 3 were conserved in the chosen insect
species, except the silkworm. It remained to be determined whether the alternative splicing pattern of mutu-

To discern whether alternative splicing also correlates
with RNA editing in other distant exons in the silkworm,
we analyzed the A-to-I RNA editing sites in exon 5 of the
nAChR subunit alpha6 gene. However, no evidence indicated any relation between alternative splicing patterns of
exon 3 and editing in distant exon 5, suggesting that the
alternative splicing patterns of exon 3 was not regulated
by RNA editing in distant exon 5.

Discussion

D. melanogaster (Dme), B. mori (Bmo), T. castaneum (Tca) and
A. mellifera (Ame) are shown. RNA editing of the nAChR subunit alpha6 genes from D. melanogaster have been previously
described [16]. Some RNA editing sites were not evidently

sequencing of cDNA clones.

ally exclusive exons was changed because the signal
ensuring the splicing of pairs of alternative exons was disturbed in the silkworm. RT-PCR and direct sequencing of
the cDNAs derived from adult transcripts showed that two
A-to-G substitutions occurred in exon 4 of the silkworm
nAChR subunit alpha6 gene (Figure 3D). However, these
two A-to-G substitutions were undetectable in embryonic
transcripts. Interestingly, sequence analysis of 80 cDNA
clones derived from embryonic, larvae, pupae and adult
transcripts, respectively, revealed two A-to-G substitutions
in exon 4 of the silkworm in splice type III, but not in
splice types I and II. PCR amplification of silkworm
genomic DNA and direct sequencing revealed that adenosine was the nucleotide in the genomic DNA at both positions, confirming that A-to-I editing occurred in this case.
These results suggest that specific editing in exon 4 and
splice type III of exon 3 might be closely related.
To determine whether coordinated RNA editing and alternative splicing were conserved in other insects, we subsequently analyzed the nAChR alpha6 genes from D.
melanogaster, T. castaneum and A. mellifera. In contrast to
the silkworm, sequence analysis indicated that no A-to-G
substitutions took place in exon 4 in these species. These
results suggest that RNA-editing sites in exon 4 are speciesspecific in B. mori, which correlates with the species-specific alternative splicing pattern of the duplicated exon 3.

Evolutionary implications
Our results indicate a high level of editing events in insect
species spanning ~300 million years of evolution. Interestingly, RT-PCR analysis showed that RNA editing was
absent in A. gambiae, indicating a divergence in molecules
targeted by RNA editing within the Diptera order [17].
Interestingly, enzyme assays measuring conversion of adenosine to inosine in salivary gland homogenates of several mosquito species detected adenosine deaminase

activity in Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti, but not
in A. gambiae [17]. However, Syt I is also edited in mosquitoes, sharing two editing sites with Drosophila species, and
one mosquito-specific site [25]. This suggests that adenosine deaminase functions in the Anopheles lineage, as in
Drosophila. A comparative sequence analysis of these species showed that the exon 5 was highly conserved at both
the nucleotide and amino acid level among these species
(Figure 5), but the flanking intronic sequences were
highly divergent. The downstream intron 5 was extraordinarily short in length, 97 bp, in A. gambiae, while it was >
1 kb in Drosophila, > 4 kb in B. mori, > 2 kb T. castaneum,
and > 30 kb in A. mellifera, respectively (Figure 7A). Likewise, the upstream intron 4 was also extraordinarily short,
94 bp, in A. gambiae, while it was much more than 1 kb in
the other insect species (Figure 7A). The absence of editing
in Anopheles correlated with the lack of downstream
intronic sequences, which were necessary to direct editing
by forming duplex RNA substrates for ADARs within
larger, energetically stable RNA secondary structures. Similarly, sequential decrease and loss of editing in A. gambiae, through weakening of the ECS-editing site
interaction to form poorer duplex RNA substrates for
ADARs, could titrate in the edited form of the protein to
the least advantageous level, or even an undetectable
level.
RNA editing conserved between the orders Diptera and
Lepidoptera for one nAChR gene was previously considered an example of convergent evolution [17]. However,
our phylogenetic analysis of RNA editing in orthologous
nAChR alpha6 genes from different species revealed a
divergent evolution from a common ancestor. Moreover,
this implies that divergent evolution from a common
ancestor would have been accompanied by editing loss or
gain in paralogous genes. We suggest that the data presented here comprise a credible phylogeny of RNA editing
for a gene, graphically illustrating descent with modification (Figure 7A). RNA editing in insect nAChR subunit
alpha6 genes predates at least the radiation of the Coleopteranand Hymenopteran orders, beginning with sites 5
and 10. New editing sites were probably generated and
ancestral editing sites were lost in subsequent evolution
through global intronic variation (Figure 7A). Our evidence suggests that Anopheles lost editing in the nAChR
alpha6 gene during the evolution of the Diptera; such a
loss might be consistent with the phylogenic evolution of
the introns. The nAChR alpha6 genes possess tandem
duplication of coding exons in their genomic sequences in
insect species, which represents alternative spliced exons.
Dating exon duplications through a combination of the
available experimental data on alternative splicing in
orthologous genes from different species and computational analysis indicated that the exon 3 and 8 duplications predated at least the radiation of insect orders

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/98

spanning ~300 million years of evolution. Our results disproved the previous hypothesis that a duplication event
gave rise to exon 8b and 8c before the divergence of an
ancestor of Drosophila and Anopheles, whereas after the
divergence a further duplication gave rise to an extra exon
(exon 8a) in the Drosophila lineage [17]. However, our evidence suggests the possibility that divergent evolution
from a common ancestor was accompanied by exon loss
and generation of paralogous genes (Figure 7B). In the
nAChR alpha6 gene, our evidence suggests that recent loss
of copies of duplicated exons has occurred (e.g. exon 8a in
A. gambiae). Moreover, divergent evolution from a common ancestor would have been accompanied by change
in the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive
exons in paralogous genes (e.g. exon 3 in B. mori)
RNA editing and SNP sites
The nAChR subunits alpha6 are subject to RNA editing in
insect species. Interestingly, there were several examples
where some A-to-I editing sites were a genomically
encoded G in closely- related species. Although we do not
know how general this interesting phenomenon is, this
led us to consider the possibility that mRNA editing might
act to maintain similarity at the protein and functional
level despite sequence divergence at the DNA level. In
plant mitochondria, mRNA editing might act to maintain
similarity at the protein level [26]. Some genetic restoration events in plants and animals are proposed to be the
result of a template-directed process that makes use of an
ancestral RNA-sequence cache [27,28]. Therefore, the
edited RNA-sequence might be taken as a template to synthesize DNA, thus causing changes at the DNA level. In
addition, the most prevalent changes of substitutional
RNA editing in the nucleus of higher eukaryotes are
hydrolytic deaminations where a genomically encoded C
or A is converted to U and I, respectively [29] Interesting,
A/G and C/T(U) substitution were much more prevalent
than other forms of SNP. Given these relations between
RNA editing and SNP, it is pertinent to ask whether RNA
editing might be an evolutionary predecessor to genomically fixed SNPs.
Regulation of mutually exclusive alternative splicing
RNA editing and alternative splicing play an important
role in expanding protein diversity and are commonly
employed to enlarge the proteome. Since both processes
may require conserved exonic and intronic elements, RNA
editing may influence alternative splicing decisions or vice
versa. There are a few examples of an association between
alternative splicing and editing [30-34]. As RNA editing
usually occurs close to exon/intron boundaries, this is
likely to be a general phenomenon and suggests an important and novel role for RNA editing [30]. Moreover, the
ADAR2 protein regulates its own synthesis by creating an
alternative splice site that leads to an out-of-frame product

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:98

[30,34]. The auto-editing of ADAR2 intron 4 by the
ADAR2 adenosine deaminase is tightly coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide AA to AI creates a new 3' splice site [34]. The editing site and the
affected splice site are usually in close proximity to one
another, and so RNA editing affected alternative splicing
by creating or deleting splice sites [30-34]. Only one
example indicates that the editing efficiency of a Drosophila gene correlates with a distant splice site selection
where alternative splicing occurs downstream of editing.
In contrast, no correlation is seen when editing occurs
downstream of alternative splicing [35]. However, the
result remains to be determined without considering the
fact that RNA editing and alternative splicing are not regulated by similar developmental patterns.
In this study, RNA editing could affect the alternative
splicing pattern by another mechanism because no new
splice sites were generated or deleted. The vast majority of
tandemly duplicated exons (99.4%) are likely to be
involved in mutually exclusive alternative splicing events
[14], therefore, mechanisms must exist to ensure that the
splicing of pairs of alternative exons is strictly mutually
exclusive, involved in competing base-pairing interactions
[36], the steric hindrance of snRNP binding [37] and the
dual spliceosome mechanisms [14]. If the signal involved
in these mechanisms was disturbed, the alternative splicing pattern of mutually exclusive exons might be changed.
Taken together, a model can be proposed to explain how
editing and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is coordinated. RNA editing in exon 4 might disrupt a splicing
enhancer signal within exon 4, which can prevent the
exon 3 cluster from splicing together. The disrupted splice
site is now more efficient at splicing out the shorter
intron, leading to the longer product. It is not exactly clear
how an enhancer within this exon would alter the choice
of a distant acceptor site, but there are previous studies
showing that longer introns tend to be flanked by stronger
splice sites [38]. To test whether A-to-I editing disrupts
exon splicing enhancer (ESE) elements, we analyzed
edited and unedited exon sequences with an ESE-finder
program [39]. A-to-I editing in two sites was predicted by
the ESE-finder to destroy the SF2/ASF (GGAACGA) and
SRp40 (CGTCAAG) ESE motifs, respectively. Taken
together, our results suggest that ESE disruption is the
underlying mechanism of A-to-I editing that results in the
change of the alternative splicing pattern. Conversely, if
RNA editing does not occur, for example, in the silkworm
embryo and in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum, mutually
exclusive alternative splicing of the duplicated exons has
arisen in the majority of transcripts. Alternatively, A-to-I
editing might disrupt the other splice signals within exon
4 in the silkworm nAChR subunit alpha6, which controls
mutually exclusive splicing of the duplicated exons. One
protein has recently been identified that prevents all of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/98

duplicated exon variants from being spliced together,
which demonstrates that the duplicated exon variants are
in fact capable of being spliced together but protein factors exist that repress this reaction [34]. A-to-I editing possibly relieves the repression on the upstream alternative
duplicated exons, and as a result, the duplicated exon variants might be spliced together.

Conclusion
We have documented the existence, evolutionary conservation, and regulation of RNA editing and alternative
splicing in nAChR alpha6 from five insects spanning ~300
million years of evolution– D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, B.
mori, T. castaneum and A. mellifera. A combination of the
experimental data and computational analysis of orthologous alpha6 genes from different species indicated that
RNA editing and alternative splicing predated at least the
radiation of insect orders spanning ~300 million years of
evolution; however, they might be lost in some species
during subsequent evolution. The occurrence of alternative splicing was found to be developmentally regulated,
and even correlated with RNA editing in some cases. Interestingly, some A-to-I editing sites represented a genomically encoded G in other species. Phylogenetic analysis of
RNA editing and alternative splicing, which are capable of
creating the multitude of functionally distinct protein isoforms, might have a crucial role in the evolution of complex organisms beyond nucleotide and protein sequences.

Methods
Materials
Total RNA was isolated from different developmental
stages of D. melanogaster, B. mori (Qingsong X Haoyue), A.
mellifera (ligustica Spinola) and T. castaneum (the red
flour beetle) using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Genomic DNA was isolated using the Universal Genomic
DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa). RNA was stored at -80°C
and genomic DNA was stored at 4°C. Plasmid DNA was
purified using Qiagen plasmid isolation kit.
Gene assemblies and analysis
The sequences of the nAChR subunit alpha6 genes from
D. melanogaster and A. gambiae have been previously
described [16,17]. The sequences of the nAChR subunit
alpha6 genes for the other Drosophila species(D. simulans,
D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. persimilis, D. willistoni, D. mojavensis, D. virilis
and D. grimshawi), the silkworm B. mori, the honeybee A.
mellifera and the red flour beetle T. castaneum were assembled from individual raw sequence reads available from
the NCBI trace archives. Vertebrate alpha6 orthologs in
Homo sapiens (human),Danio rerio (zebrafish), Mus musculus (mouse),Gallus gallus (chicken) and Takifugu rubripes
(pufferfish) were identified by BLAST searches using the

sequence of the most closely related organisms. The
intron 7 sequence of the silkworm nAChR subunit alpha6
gene was determined using PCR and sequencing.
Generation of full-length cDNA
Full-length cDNA clones were obtained using the 5'/3'
RACE cDNA synthesis kit. First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (0.5 μg) isolated from silkworm
using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase primed with the
oligo(dT)12–18 anchor primer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The 5' and 3' RACE specific primers were designed according to the DNA
sequence (Table 1). The DNA products were purified by
using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and cloned into the
pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of recombinant clones was
carried out using standard procedures.

Analysis of gene expression by RT-PCR
Silkworm total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II RT and the resulting single-stranded cDNA product was treated with DNase at 37°C for 30 min. PCR
amplification was carried out using cDNA from 10 ng of
total RNA template in each reaction. The gene-specific
primers for PCR were designed according to the nAChR
alpha6 genomic sequence. Each splice product was amplified separately from bulk cDNA using a single spliceformspecific primer and a shared primer. Primer1, 2, 3, 4, 5
refer to BmDa-5-4, BmDa-5-8, BmDa-5-9, BmDa-5-10,
and BmDa-3-1, respectively (Table 1). Amplification conditions were 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55-65°C for 30 s
and 72°C for 30 s, followed by one cycle of 72°C for 10
min. Silkworm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) transcripts were amplified as an
external control.

primer pairs mentioned above for nAChR alpha6 genes in
different species. RT-PCR amplicons were either directly
sequenced after gel purification or subcloned and individual cDNA-bearing plasmid clones subjected to sequencing. Primers for the nAChR subunit alpha6 exon 5 were
used to amplify genomic DNA from the same tissues used
for RNA isolation. The genomic PCR amplification product was subjected to direct sequencing to demonstrate that
genomic products give a pure A signal at editing sites, ruling out a polymorphism. For subcloning, RT-PCR splice
products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. Relative A-to-G abundance was determined by sequencing
individual clones with plasmids containing appropriately
sized inserts.
