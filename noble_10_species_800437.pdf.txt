assignment tests: a case study using Chinese
toad-headed agamas (genus Phrynocephalus)

Abstract
Background: Species are fundamental units in biology, yet much debate exists surrounding how we should delineate
species in nature. Species discovery now requires the use of separate, corroborating datasets to quantify
independently evolving lineages and test species criteria. However, the complexity of the speciation process has
ushered in a need to infuse studies with new tools capable of aiding in species delineation. We suggest that modelbased assignment tests are one such tool. This method circumvents constraints with traditional population genetic
analyses and provides a novel means of describing cryptic and complex diversity in natural systems. Using toadheaded agamas of the Phrynocephalus vlangalii complex as a case study, we apply model-based assignment tests to
microsatellite DNA data to test whether P. putjatia, a controversial species that closely resembles P. vlangalii
morphologically, represents a valid species. Mitochondrial DNA and geographic data are also included to corroborate
the assignment test results.
Results: Assignment tests revealed two distinct nuclear DNA clusters with 95% (230/243) of the individuals being
assigned to one of the clusters with > 90% probability. The nuclear genomes of the two clusters remained distinct in
sympatry, particularly at three syntopic sites, suggesting the existence of reproductive isolation between the identified
clusters. In addition, a mitochondrial ND2 gene tree revealed two deeply diverged clades, which were largely
congruent with the two nuclear DNA clusters, with a few exceptions. Historical mitochondrial introgression events
between the two groups might explain the disagreement between the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. The
nuclear DNA clusters and mitochondrial clades corresponded nicely to the hypothesized distributions of P. vlangalii
and P. putjatia.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that assignment tests based on microsatellite DNA data can be powerful tools
for distinguishing closely related species and support the validity of P. putjatia. Assignment tests have the potential to
play a significant role in elucidating biodiversity in the era of DNA data. Nonetheless, important limitations do exist and
multiple independent datasets should be used to corroborate results from assignment programs.
Background
Species are fundamental units in biology, yet conceptually
defining them has been a difficult task owing to the complexity and continuity of the speciation process itself and
the diversity of reproductive modes among organisms.
Attempts to resolve this debate have lead to the proliferation of different species concepts, most of which embody
important aspects of the speciation process but lack a

general applicability necessary for characterizing all species diversity. Over the last few decades the debate surrounding what exactly species are seems to be moving
towards a consensus. Synthesizing similarities among different species concepts, both Mayden [1] and de Queiroz
[2] recognized that most species concepts are not primary definitions describing the necessary traits of a species, but rather, are secondary definitions or species
criteria. In general, species are separately evolving population level lineages, which may acquire unique traits as
they evolve [1-3]. Under this framework, the operational
criteria of most species concepts are used to quantita-

tively assess the degree to which lineages have diverged
and are used as evidence to describe species. With an
emerging consensus on the definitive properties of a species, there has been a shift to focusing on ways to delimit
species in nature [3-8].
Methods of delineating species are numerous and can
be grouped into what have been deemed 'non tree-based'
and 'tree-based' methods [5]. Tree-based methods vary,
but all make use of either morphological or molecular
data to estimate phylogenetic relationships of individuals
that share a common evolutionary history [5]. These
methods rely heavily on the monophyly criterion to make
species designations, which assumes that all populations
of the same species share a most recent common ancestor
with each other (but see [9]). In contrast, non-tree based
methods have traditionally relied on the concept of
reproductive isolation between species. Although such
isolation can be directly tested occasionally, most methods infer reproductive isolation by indirectly estimating
gene flow within and between hypothesized species.
The reproductive isolation criterion recognizes that
reduced gene exchange plays a pivotal role characterizing
species boundaries [10,11] and is widely accepted among
evolutionary biologists as being an important process
leading to the divergence of sexually reproducing species
[12]. Gene flow has traditionally been characterized using
protein based allozyme markers to assess the level of
genetic divergence between pre-defined populations [1316]. Fixed allelic differences at multiple loci were considered strong evidence for reproductive isolation. Although
effective, this requires the sacrifice of organisms, which
for many groups is no longer feasible. Moreover, allozyme
markers are often too conservative to delineate closely
related species. Molecular markers such as short tandem
repeats (e.g. microsatellite DNA) have gained major popularity among both ecologists and evolutionary biologists
because genomic DNA can be readily extracted from a
small amount of tissue [17,18]. In addition, these markers
are readily available, relatively inexpensive and amplify
across closely related species [17,18]. Important innovations in population genetic analysis and greater computational power have allowed researchers to make use of
model-based assignment tests [17,19], which may provide
powerful tools for inferring reproductive isolation and
species boundaries.
Assignment tests have become popular tools for assessing a multitude of questions of both applied and theoretical importance [19]. These tests make use of Bayesian or
likelihood statistics to cluster individuals based on linkage disequilibrium in a sample of individuals from distinct populations [19]. Linkage disequilibrium occurs
when a population has a non-random association
between genotypes at multiple loci, and admixture
between two distinct populations is one common cause

Page 2 of 15

of linkage disequilibrium [10,20,21]. Assignment tests
attempt to decompose such mixture by creating clusters
of individuals within which linkage disequilibrium is
minimized [19]. These tests can simultaneously define
naturally occurring clusters of individuals based on their
multi-locus genotypes and assign individuals to clusters.
Traditionally, these tests have been used in fisheries science to identify the origin of a particular fish, however,
they have since diversified to include the identification of
illegal harvests [22], establishing the origins of bioinfestations [23], identifying hybrids [24,25], assessing population structure [26], and determining the number of
migrants from other populations [27]. Assignment tests
provide important advantages over traditional population
genetic analyses because: 1) they do not require large
sample sizes; 2) there is no need to establish populations
a priori [19,28]; 3) they treat individuals as the units of
analysis, therefore increasing power to detect subtle biological processes [28]; 4) they allow for the detection of
admixed or hybrid individuals [19,28] and 5) they allow
for the incorporation of geographic information [29].
Manel et al. provides an excellent review of assignment
tests [19]. To date few studies have directly used assignment tests for species delineation and none have formally
discussed their general potential as a tool for species
delineation, despite their successes [30,31]. Assignment
methods in conjunction with neutral, co-dominant markers, such as microsatellite DNA repeats, may provide
researchers with a powerful means of establishing species
boundaries because they can be easily applied and
address numerous species criteria, such as the genotypic
clustering criterion proposed by Mallet [32] and the
reproductive isolation criterion [33]. However, case studies are necessary to determine their general applicability.
Toad-headed lizards of the P. vlangalii complex provide
an excellent model system to test species boundaries
using such approaches because they are widespread,
numerous primers exist that cross amplify microsatellite
DNA from closely related species, and they have a well
established mtDNA phylogeny and have received substantial taxonomic attention. The high morphological
variability within P. vlangalii has generated intense debate
over species designations providing an interesting and
difficult case to test species level boundaries. One specific case occurs between P. vlangalii and P. putjatia. Bedriaga assigned populations of 'P. vlangalii' southeast of
Lake Qinghai (= Lake Kukunor) to P. putjatia based on
morphological differences [34]. However, the status of P.
putjatia has been contentious; while Wang et al. considered it a valid species based on morphological and chromosomal differences [35], most authors regard it as a
synonym of P. vlangalii [36-38]. Recently, Jin et al.
revealed two deeply diverged mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) clades situated in the eastern and western areas

Noble et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/197

of 'P. vlangalii's' distribution [39], which appears to correspond to P. putjatia and P. vlangalii, respectively. Molecular clock estimates suggest that the initial divergence
between these two clades took place approximately 6.434.75 million years ago [39]. Surrounding Lake Qinghai
these two proposed species overlap, which provides an
excellent opportunity to test the species hypotheses (Figure 1).
We apply Bayesian assignment methods to resolve the
relationships between P. vlangalii and P. putjatia. A large
number of individuals from the presumptive distribution
of both species, including the sympatric zones, are examined using eight microsatellite DNA markers and a mitochondrial gene (ND2). If P. putjatia is a synonym of P.
vlangalii (i.e. one species hypothesis), we would predict a
single nuclear DNA cluster containing many individuals
from both mtDNA clades. In contrast, if P. putjatia is a
valid species (i.e. two species hypothesis), we would pre-

dict that two genotypic clusters will exist, and they will
correspond to the previously identified mtDNA clades
[39]. In addition, nuclear genotypes of both clusters
should persist in the sympatric zone.

Results
Microsatellite DNA

We examined 243 individuals with eight microsatellite
DNA loci. Allelic diversity ranged from 36 (PVMS38) to
71 (Phry75) alleles per locus with an average of 47.5
alleles/locus. MICRO-CHECKER version 1.0 [40] did not
detect evidence for large allele drop out or scoring errors,
however, it did detect the potential for null alleles at
Phry79, Phry75 and PVMS35.
We used the program STRUCTURE version 2.2 [41] to
detect the number of naturally occurring clusters (K)
within the examined individuals. Average LnP(D) values
from STRUCTURE increased by 3.3% from K = 1 to K =

collected in 2008.

2, 0.19% from K = 2 to K = 3 and 0.87% from K = 3 to K =
4 (Figure 2). The large jump in LnP(D) values between K
= 1 and K = 2 followed by small changes between K = 2
and K = 3 suggest that K = 2 is adequate to explain the
data and is also the most parsimonious. In addition, individual assignment probabilities declined as K increased to
3 and 4 (Figure 3). When K = 2, the two clusters were distinct (Figure 3a) with 95% (230/243) of the individuals
assigned with > 90% probability to one of the clusters.
The two clusters had an average F ST = 0.0524 and 5% of
individuals showed evidence of an 'admixed' nuclear
genome. When K = 3 or 4, the clusters became indistinct
with the majority of individuals having an assignment
probability of less than 80% (K = 3, 52% and K = 4, 62%;
Figure 3b,c). Due to the large fragment size and high
allelic diversity at locus Phry75, we removed it from the
analysis to determine whether it influenced assignment
probabilities. Re-running the analysis without this locus
caused little change in assignment probabilities.
We used the program TESS version 2.1 [29] to incorporate geographic information into the analysis. Assignment probabilities from TESS were nearly identical to the
STRUCTURE results. TESS identified a red cluster (P.
vlangalii) that was situated south of Lake Qinghai and a
green cluster (P. putjatia) that was situated east of Lake
Qinghai (Figure 4), which correspond to the geographic
locations of the two deeply diverged mtDNA lineages
described by Jin et al. [39] and the hypothesized species
ranges [35,39]. The two clusters displayed a large overlap
zone (sympatry) and members of the two clusters also co-

existed at sites 18, 19 and 21 (syntopy). Furthermore,
individuals southwest of Lake Qinghai had a large proportion of their genome assigned to the red cluster as
indicated from the high level of admixture among individuals in this region with the red cluster (P. vlangalii),
while individuals in the east showed little admixture with

Figure 4 Spatial clustering based on individual assignment probabilities from TESS (version 2.1). Population coordinates were permuated using a standard deviation of 0.015 to more accurately depict individuals. Each dot represents a single individual. Red corrosponds to the Phyrnocephalus
vlangalii cluster and green corresponds to the Phrynocephalus putjatia cluster. Grey polygon represents a lack of information

the red cluster (Figure 5). An opposite pattern was found
for the green cluster (diagram not shown). It would have
been desirable to obtain more samples further east of
Lake Qinghai to compare more thoroughly the extent to
which the nuclear DNA showed geographic congruence
with the hypothesized species distributions. However,
this was not possible because the areas bordering the Yellow River are characterized by agriculture, providing unsuitable habitat for these lizards.
There were few individuals with admixed nuclear
genomes. Thirteen individuals (5%) had less than 90%
probability and seven had less than 80% probability of
being assigned to a cluster. Within the three syntopic sites
(18, 19 and 21), only one individual out of 54 individuals
examined had an admixed genome. From site 18, all 19
individuals received >90% probability of being assigned to
one cluster; 18 were assigned to the P. vlangalii cluster
and one was assigned to the P. putjatia cluster. Site 19 has
a similar situation: one was assigned to the P. vlangalii
cluster and 14 were assigned to the P. putjatia cluster,
and all received >90% probability. The only individual
with an admixed genome was from site 21 and it had a
probability of 0.729 of belonging to the P. putjatia cluster.
Two of the remaining individuals were assigned to the P.
vlangalii cluster and 18 to the P. putjatia cluster.

Mitochondrial DNA

A total of 146 individuals were successfully sequenced for
an 850 base pair DNA fragment of the mitochondrial
ND2 gene. Additionally, 19 sequences were obtained
from Jin et al. [39], which had an approximately 350 base
pair overlap with our data. Sequences for Phrynocephalus
theobaldi, P. zetangensis, P. axillaris and P. versicolor,
were obtained from GenBank and used as outgroup taxa.
The alignment was straightforward and produced no
gaps. Overall, 74 unique haplotypes were identified
including 70 ingroup members and four outgroup members.
A Bayesian analysis with MrBayes version 3.2 [42] was
conducted to reconstruct the historical relationships
among the haplotypes. A GTR + G model was selected to
be the best-fit model based on Akaike's Information Criteria. The Bayesian tree along with posterior probabilities
is shown in Figure 6. Our tree topology and population
designation were nearly identical to those of Jin et al. [39].
Two clades were clearly identified. A P. vlangalii clade
was primarily situated in the western part of the Gonghe
Basin south of Lake Qinghai, except for site 20. Members
of this clade occurred in sites 1-12, 14-21 and 23 (Figure 1
&6). A P. putjatia clade was primarily found in the
Gonghe Basin east of Lake Qinghai, including sites 4, 13,
14, 18, 19 and 21-23. (Figure 1 &6).

Congruence between Microsatellite and Mitochondrial
DNA Data

Individual membership to each of the two nuclear DNA
clusters was largely congruent with the mitochondrial
DNA clades, with a few exceptions. The complete genotypes of 146 individuals with both mitochondrial and
nuclear gene data are provided in Table 1. All individuals
from site 13 had a mtDNA haplotype from P. putjatia but
a nuclear genome entirely composed of P. vlangalii (vv p).
In contrast, one individual from site 19 and one individual from site 23 had a P. vlangalii mtDNA haplotype but a
P. putjatia nuclear genome (pp v). Individuals with mixed
mitochondrial and nuclear genomes also occurred at sites
4, 14 and 18 (Table 1). Overall, 82% of all individuals contained pure genomes (pp p or vv v), 15% of all individuals
had pure nuclear genomes and the opposite mitochondrial genomes and 3% of all individuals contained an
admixed nuclear genome with a P. putjatia or P. vlangalii
mtDNA haplotype.

Discussion
Validity of Phrynocephalus putjatia

We reject the one species hypothesis (i.e. all populations
are P. vlangalii). Three lines of evidence support this conclusion: 1) assignment tests distinguish two naturally
occurring distinct nuclear DNA clusters, 2) the existence

of few intermediates in the sympatric zone indicates that
members of the two genetic clusters rarely hybridize, and
3) the clusters largely correspond to the two deeply
diverged mtDNA clades and the geographic locations of
the two proposed species. This evidence suggests established reproductive isolation between the clusters, and
therefore, they should be recognized as distinct species,
i.e. P. vlangalii and P. putjatia, according to the biological
species concept (criterion).
The largest change in LnP(D) values occurred between
K = 1 and K = 2 suggesting that two very distinct gene
pools exist in the dataset. In addition, individuals could
be assigned to one of the two identified clusters with
greater than 90% probability further supporting discrete
differences at the nuclear genetic level. Furthermore, the
clusters exhibited geographic cohesiveness (Figure 4 &5).
Jin et al. suggested that P. putjatia diverged from all other
populations of P. vlangalii during the Late Miocene when
global temperatures decreased and the climate became
more cool and arid [39]. Ancestral populations isolated
during this time would have diverged substantially from
other populations.
Although two distinct clusters were identified, the F ST
value between these clusters was low (average F ST =
0.0524). Genetic divergence among species is known to
be extremely variable, with F ST estimates ranging from

0.05 to over 0.77 based on allozyme markers [43]. One
reason for the low genetic differentiation in our case is
likely due to the high mutation rates among the loci used
in this study. Loci with high mutation rates likely experience high levels of homoplasy decreasing the differentiation between groups and leading to low F ST values [44].
This is plausible given the high allelic diversity (47.5
alleles/locus) we observed. O'Reilly et al. showed that
microsatellite DNA markers with high polymorphism
caused a decline in F ST estimates between Walleye Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) populations [44]. Simulation studies also suggest that increased mutation rates
significantly decrease estimates of FST [45,46] and
Hedrick also analytically demonstrated that when the
number of alleles is high, FST is necessarily low [47].
Other explanations such as historical introgression
through hybridization and the small sample sizes of P.
putjatia are also possible. Greater sampling effort south

of the Yellow river will be necessary to differentiate
between these explanations.
The observed allelic diversity in this study (47.5 alleles/
locus) was greater than that found by Wang et al., who
found an average of 32.5 alleles per locus [48]. The
greater average number of alleles per locus in this study is
likely due to the different loci used and differences in
microsatellite scoring between studies. Wang et al. found
that populations from sites 1 and 18 had the greatest
number of alleles on average than any other populations
(23.8 and 16.5, respectively) [48]. Since this study had
much more extensive sampling in this area it is not surprising that a greater diversity of alleles was found. Wang
et al. speculated that the high genetic diversity in this
group is likely due to the age of the lineage, the high population density of these lizards, isolation with migration
and the lack of bottleneck events [48].
The maintenance of P. vlangalii and P. putjatia nuclear
genomes in sympatry suggests that intrinsic barriers to

Noble et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/197

gene flow exist, such as pre- or post-mating isolation
mechanisms, preventing inter-breeding between these
two species. The majority of our sampling sites are from
the overlap zone between the hypothesized ranges of the
two species (Figure 1). Within this broad sympatric zone,
individuals with admixed nuclear genomes are few, only
approximately 5%. Some sites (i.e. 19 and 20) are in close
geographic proximity (< 5 km) without any obvious physical barriers, and yet, the genetic makeup of the two populations is different (Figure 1, Table 1). Furthermore, the
two species are syntopic at sites 18, 19 and 21, and only
one hybrid (out of 54 individuals) with an admixed
nuclear genome was detected. If these were not two species one would expect most of the individuals examined
to have admixed or hybrid genomes as a consequence of
random mating between the two genotypes. Nevertheless, the presence of individuals with admixed nuclear
genomes suggests recent hybridization events between P.
vlangalii and P. putjatia and a lack of complete reproductive isolation. Furthermore, 15% of the individuals had
disparate mtDNA and nuclear DNA suggesting the
occurrence of historical introgressive hybridization
events between P. vlangalii and P. putjatia in the Gonghe
basin and east of Lake Qinghai (Table 1). The genus
Phrynocephalus is known for its complex social structure
and mating behaviours, which may play an important role
in mate choice and intrasexual communication. To date,
the ecology and behaviour of these species remain poorly
understood, and future work addressing the mating
behaviour of these lizards will help elucidate potential
isolation mechanisms between these species.
Sites 4, 13, 14, 18 and 19 contained individuals with
mtDNA haplotypes from one species but the nuclear
genome entirely from the other species. Jin et al. provided
evidence that P. vlangalii from the Qiadam Basin exhibited a rapid eastward range expansion as the Yellow River
drained the paleao-Lake Gonghe, approximately 0.15 million years ago [39]. Under this scenario, P. vlangalii would
have come into secondary contact with P. putjatia populations isolated during this time. Hybridization would
have resulted in introgression of mtDNA haplotypes from
both of these species. Continual backcrossing with one
parental species would have "diluted" any evidence of
hybridization in their nuclear genomes, while the introgressed mitochondrial genome remained in place.
Indeed, historical hybridization and introgression of
mtDNA haplotypes has been reported in a number of
studies ranging from amphibians to mammals [49-51].
For example, Melo-Ferreira et al. reported extensive
introgression in the Iberian Hares from Spain with 32% of
Lepus granatensis containing an mtDNA lineage from L.
timidus [49].
Our genetic clustering did not match the morphological diagnosis provided by Wang et al. [35], although the

Page 9 of 15

distribution of the genetic clusters was largely congruent
with their proposed species ranges. Wang et al. suggested
that P. putjatia has a tail length larger than its snout-vent
length and has more than 100 rows of back scales, while P.
vlangalii has a relatively short tail and fewer than 100
rows of back scales [35]. Approximately half of P. putjatia
identified in this study did not possess these "diagnostic"
characters. This is not particularly surprising given that
the genus Phyrnocephalus is notorious for exhibiting
large intraspecific morphological variation but lack of
consistent interspecific differences [38,52]. Such phenotypic diversity has made it particularly difficult to delineate species and morphology-based taxonomy is very
confusing in this genus. For example, more than ten
names have been applied to P. vlangalii historically [38].
Rather than searching for a few diagnostic characters, a
multivariate analysis, such as principle component analysis, may be more appropriate to dissect the morphological differences between P. putjatia and P. vlangalii. It is
important to note that a lack of congruence between
morphology and other tools (e.g. genetic) for diagnosing
species should not necessarily be regarded as evidence
against the validity of two species [8]. Traditional morphology-based taxonomy, is only one way to describe
"life's diversity" and species hypotheses developed based
on morphology alone should be tested using different
approaches with a variety of data sets [8]. Wang et al. also
described chromosomal differences between the two species; while P. vlangalii has ZW sex chromosomes, P. putjatia lacks identifiable sex chromosomes [35].
Unfortunately, we do not have chromosome data for
specimens examined in this study. Nevertheless, the
chromosome difference could potentially provide a
reproductive isolation mechanism.
Assignment Tests as a Tool for Species Delineation

The idea to treat species as cohesive genotypic clusters,
with few intermediates, was first formulized by Mallet
[32] and has since been adopted by two studies to clarify
taxonomic issues between proposed species [30,31].
Drummond & Hamilton applied assignment tests in a
sympatric zone between two varieties (i.e. sub-species) of
Lupinus microcarpus [31]. They found strong evidence to
suggest two distinct clusters corresponding to L. microcarpus horizontalis and L. microcarpus densiflorus, with
the largest difference in likelihood values between K = 1
and K = 2. They concluded that the two varieties should
be recognized as separate species because they maintain
their distinctiveness in sympatry and show low levels of
admixture (only 2.1% of individuals showed evidence of
an admixed genome). Maingon et al. also used assignment tests to discern between sandfly (Lutzomyia longipalpis) populations exhibiting differences in pheromone
composition [30]. They too found strong evidence that

Noble et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/197

sandflies with different pheromone compounds (9 MGB
and cembrene) are distinct species, with < 10% of all individuals being incorrectly assigned. These and the present
study reveal the power of assignment tests in resolving
difficult taxonomic issues.
Assignment tests will be most powerful where two species are sympatric, particularly in syntopic populations,
because reproductive isolation can be more rigorously
addressed in these situations. In sympatry, distinct genotypic clusters are most likely the product of intrinsic
reproductive isolation between the clusters, and these
clusters should merit species status according to the biological species criterion. In allopatry, however, isolation
by distance and geography are known to cause differentiation between populations within species and can confound interpretations of species diversity because genetic
clusters arising from these processes may be mistaken as
separate species. Under these circumstances, multiple
molecular and non-molecular tools should be used concurrently to assess evidence of species level designations.
A number of different molecular markers can be used
in assignment programs, providing researchers with a
diversity of tools for addressing species boundaries. Microsatellite DNA markers are probably the most commonly used markers for such analyses. Because of their
high allelic diversity, they are capable of detecting subtle
population genetic structure [17] and will be particularly
useful where species have diverged little genetically. The
use of microsatellite DNA will likely only apply to closely
related species for which markers have been successfully
characterized and cross amplify [17]. Other co-dominant
markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), can also be used in assignment tests providing
that the loci are independent and not in linkage disequilibrium within populations [41]. With the advent of new
molecular techniques [53,54], it is now feasible to use
hundreds of independent loci throughout the genome
making the use of these methods more robust.
An important assumption of assignment test models is
that populations are in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage
equilibrium or nearly so [29,55,56]. These conditions are
not satisfied by most empirical studies and greater effort
should be put towards understanding how violations of
such assumptions affect conclusions drawn from assignment test analyses.

Conclusions
The results from the assignment tests and phylogenetic
analyses support the validity of P. putjatia as being a distinct species. There are two distinct genetic clusters in
sympatry and the clusters largely correspond to the
hypothesized distributions of P. vlangalii and P. putjatia
and two deeply diverged mtDNA lineages. However,
there is evidence for both contemporary and historical

Page 10 of 15

hybridization between P. vlangalii and P. putjatia. The
use of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers will
help researchers elucidate these processes in nature and
more accurately depict the historical events that have
taken place between taxa. Future studies should strive to
include both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA information, and the use of assignment tests will facilitate this
revolution.
Species delineation has always been an important scientific endeavor. The characterization of independently
evolving lineages is necessary for addressing fundamental
theories in ecology and evolution, while also guiding our
efforts in conserving biodiversity. An evidence-based
approach to species discovery requires the recruitment of
a wide array of tools to effectively discriminate between
competing species hypotheses. Assignment methods
using microsatellite DNA markers provide a novel tool to
test species hypotheses and will be especially beneficial
when examining recently diverged species and in groups
where collecting a large number of individuals from a single location is difficult.

Methods
Sample Collection and Location

A total of 243 individuals were examined in this study.
Among them, 189 samples were collected in 2008; three
to fifteen individuals were collected at 20 different sites
along two transects (east to west and north to south)
where the two previously identified mtDNA clades are
known to persist in sympatry [39]. These two clades provide a unique opportunity to make use of assignment
tests in assessing the reproductive isolation between
these groups because: 1) they are geographically close
together, reducing the possibility that genetic divergence
is due to isolation by distance and 2) they are found in a
small flat area, reducing the possibility that genetic divergence is a result of a topologically complex landscape.
Specimens were euthanized by an intracardial injection
of sodium pentobarbital. Liver and heart muscle were
excised and stored in 95% ethanol and all voucher specimens were preserved in the Chengdu Institute of Biology.
An additional 54 samples from three sites of the same
area, which were collected in 2007 and used in a previous
study [48] were also included in this study. Toe clippings
were taken from all samples and no vouchers were collected in 2007. We assumed that the temporal genetic
variation between the two years was minimal. A full list of
samples and their collecting locations is provided in Table
2 and depicted in Figure 1.

coly Sulfate), 600 ul of STE buffer and 17.5 ul of proteinase K (20 mg/mL). Samples were extracted twice with
phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once
with chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:1). Genomic DNA
was precipitated with 3 M NaAc (pH 5.2) and -20Â°C 95%
ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol twice and re-suspended in PCR grade water (Sigma) overnight.
We used eight microsatellite DNA loci (Phr27, Phr63,
Phr75, Phr79, PVMS12, PVMS18, PVMS35, and
PVMS38) for which primers were developed [57,58].
These loci have previously been used in population
genetic studies of P. vlangalii [48] and P. przewalskii [59],
and were shown to be in linkage equilibrium. These loci
also had a close match between their expected and
observed heterozygosity, which is indicative of a low
occurrence of null alleles. PCR amplification was performed in 10 ul reaction volumes containing 0.5 ul of
extracted DNA, 0.1 ul Taq polymerase (Takara; rtaq), 0.6
ul of Mg 2 + (25 mM), 1.0 ul of 10Ã universal PCR Buffer
(Takara), 0.2 ul dNTP (10 mM of each dNTP; Roche
Diagnostics), and 0.25 ul of each primer (10 pmol ul - 1).

All forward primers were labeled with tetrachloro-6-carboxy-fluorescein (TET). Reactions took place in a thermocycler (PTC-200, MJ Research) with an initial
denaturation of 95Â°C for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles
of 95Â°C for 45 seconds, primer specific annealing temperature [57,58] for 30 seconds and 72Â°C for 45 seconds.
Products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and
visualized with an FMBIO laser scanner (Hitachi). The
base pair length of each allele was determined by running
all samples with three marker individuals and a Genescanâ¢-350 TAMRA size standard (Applied Biosystems).
Analyses were conducted using FMBIO analysis software
(Hitachi).
Microsatellite DNA genotyping is known to have a high
occurrence of genotyping errors [60-62], and as such the
following precautions were taken to minimize error during the scoring process. Firstly, scoring within and across
gels was standardized. Since marker individuals were run
multiple times, the most commonly computed value was
taken as the true value for the base pair length of these
individuals' alleles. Based on sequenced alleles, the com-

Noble et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/197

puted alleles were shown to be quite accurate; within two
base pairs of the true repeat length. Marker individuals,
the TAMRA ladder and the slippage from incomplete
PCR amplification were utilized to compute the base pair
length of all other alleles. Microsatellite DNA 'slippage' or
'stutter bands' are common mistakes made during PCR
amplification, where the Taq polymerase causes a mutation in the number of repeat motifs during the replication
process [61]. Although these can be problematic for the
scoring process, slippage can be used as a ladder, providing alleles are scored consistently. Secondly, six sets of
four individuals (N = 24 of known genotype) were re-run
to ensure that their alleles were scored correctly. The four
individuals chosen were those that contained an allele
scored as being the same base pair length and these were
run beside each other on the same polyacrylamide gel.
We tested whether allele j from individual X was the same
as allele j from individual Y, Z and W at locus n. Alleles
placed beside each other can easily be detected as being
the same or different. When possible, secondary alleles
were also re-scored to ensure that their predicted value,
based on their relationships with other alleles on the
same gel, was consistent with previous scoring efforts.
Any incorrectly scored alleles were changed accordingly.
Finally, MICRO-CHECKER version 1.0 [40] was used to
test for the presence of scoring errors, large allele dropouts and/or null alleles. MICRO-CHECKER requires
larger sample sizes to assess the latter and so two populations (sites 18 & 21) with the largest sample sizes (19 &
20) were used for these tests.
Microsatellite DNA Data Analysis

The Bayesian model-based clustering programs STRUCTURE version 2.2 [41] and TESS version 2.1 [29] were
employed to detect species level structure and assign
individuals to groups. These methods use multi-locus
genotypes and a predefined number of clusters (K) to
generate groupings that minimize the deviation from
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage equilibrium [29,55,56]. Individuals are then assigned probabilistically to one or more clusters based on their multi-locus
genotype.
STRUCTURE implements a non-spatial, Bayesian clustering method that uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach to explore the parameter space for
the most likely estimates of the parameters Z (i) (individual i's population of origin), P (allele frequency in all populations) and Î± (admixture proportions for each
individual; admixture model only) [55]. In contrast, TESS
implements a spatial Bayesian clustering method using a
Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) approach to
model spatial dependency at the cluster membership
level [56]. The HMRF concept accounts for the idea that
individuals close together are more likely to be genetically

Page 12 of 15

similar with each other than individuals further apart and
introduces a spatial dependency parameter Ï [29,56].
When Ï is set to zero the models used in TESS are virtually the same as STRUCTURE [29]. Therefore, TESS was
used to determine whether the spatial location of the two
clusters corresponded to the geographic areas of the two
mtDNA clades identified by Jin et al. [39] and to assess
the level of admixture between clusters.
STRUCTURE was used to identify the most likely number of clusters within the dataset (K MAX). Because Wang
et al. identified strong population genetic structure in P.
vlangalii of this area [48], we restricted the range of K
from 1-4 as we were only interested in detecting 'species'
level divergences. A total of 100 independent runs with
10,000-50,000 burn-in iterations and 100,000 post burnin iterations were conducted at each value of K using
default settings. This was a sufficient number of iterations to guarantee convergence. One hundred independent runs were completed to ensure that the multidimensional parameter space was sufficiently explored,
removing the possibility of an MCMC chain getting stuck
on one local optimum. Both an 'admixture' and 'no
admixture' model were run because the 'admixture
model' has a tendency to under-estimate the true value of
K [63]. Thirteen independent runs with the highest
LnP(D) were averaged and plotted using the statistical
software package R [63,64]. This method for estimating K
MAX is similar to that described for TESS [63]. Individual
assignment probabilities, LnP(D) and convergence
between runs were all used to assess the most likely value
of K. In general, higher LnP(D) and large changes in the
LnP(D) values between successive changes in the K
parameter indicate a better fit to the data. Furthermore, a
suitable K value should yield an individual assignment
plot with a high probability of individual assignment. If
greater than 80% of the individuals had a probability
above 90% of being assigned to the identified clusters
then the K parameter was considered to have sufficient
power in explaining the data. Admixed individuals were
those with less than 90% individual assignment probability and are expected to be rare.
Using the identified number of clusters from STRUCTURE, 100 independent iterations were run in TESS with
individual spatial information. An admixture model was
run with 50,000 burn-in iterations and 100,000 post
burn-in iterations with Ï = 0.6 and Î± = 1.0. This was sufficient to ensure convergence within a single iteration. We
ran 10 pilot runs and found that varying values of Ï = 0.62.0 and Î± = 1.0-6.0 did not change the overall assignment
probabilities.
TESS requires unique individual coordinates to accurately depict spatial clustering. Since there were only site
specific coordinates, each latitude and longitude were
permutated slightly by a standard deviation of 0.015 using

Noble et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:197
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/197

the "Generate Spatial Coordinates" function in TESS.
This was necessary to more accurately depict individual
clustering and its geographical association. CLUMPP version 1.1 [65] was used to average the 15 lowest DIC runs
and to produce the admixture (Q) matrix. The level of
admixture in each cluster was displayed graphically using
the statistical package R [63].
Mitochondrial DNA

DNA extractions from 146 individuals, that had a microsatellite DNA genotype, were selected for sequencing.
Individuals that had a high assignment probability to one
cluster or which showed evidence for an admixed
genome were chosen. An 850 bp ND2 fragment was
amplified in order to determine whether the clusters corresponded to the two mtDNA lineages outlined by Jin et
al. [39]. Reactions took place in 25 ul volumes with 1 ul of
DNA, 1 ul of ND2 forward and reverse primers (10 pmol
ul - 1) (L4447 5'-aag cag ttg ggc cca tgc ccc aaa aac gg- 3'
and H5622- 5'- tat ttt aat taa aat atc tga gtt gca-3'; [66]), 2
ul dNTP (10 mM of each dNTP; Roche Diagnostics), 1.5
ul Mg 2 + (25 mM), 2.5 ul 10Ã buffer (Takara), and 0.25 ul
Taq polymerase (Takara). Thermal cycling was performed with an initial denaturation at 95Â°C for 5 minutes
followed by 30 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 seconds, 50Â°C annealing for 30 seconds, 72Â°C for 45 seconds and a final extension of 72Â°C for 5 minutes. All PCR products were run on
1% agarose gels and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen). The cleaned products were directly
cycle sequenced in the forward direction using the L4447
primer. All DNA sequencing reactions were performed
using BigDye terminator sequencing chemistry with an
ABI 3730 sequencing machine (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences were visualized and corrected using
Sequencher version 4.5 (Genecode Corp) and aligned
using MacClade version 4.08 [67].
A phylogenetic tree was generated to determine
whether the data recovered the same clades as found by
Jin et al. [39], and to assess whether the mtDNA lineages
correspond to genotypic clusters found using the nuclear
DNA. A Bayesian inference approach using MrBayes version 3.2 [42] was used. Akaike's Information Criterion
(AIC) in MrModeltest version 2.1 [68] was used to determine the best-fit model. We used a "flat" prior and four
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains with
10,000,000 generations to ensure convergence. Tracer
version 1.4 [69] was used to plot likelihood values and
determine whether the Markov chains had reached convergence. Trees were sampled every 500 generations and
the last 5,000 trees were used to estimate the consensus
tree and Bayesian posterior probabilities. All prior trees
were designated as "burn-in".
