Abstract
Background: Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases belonging to the glycosyl hydrolase 20 (GH20) family
are involved in the removal of terminal β-glycosidacally linked N-acetylhexosamine residues. These
enzymes, widely distributed in microorganisms, animals and plants, are involved in many important
physiological and pathological processes, such as cell structural integrity, energy storage, pathogen
defence, viral penetration, cellular signalling, fertilization, development of carcinomas, inflammatory
events and lysosomal storage diseases. Nevertheless, only limited analyses of phylogenetic
relationships between GH20 genes have been performed until now.
Results: Careful phylogenetic analyses of 233 inferred protein sequences from eukaryotes and
prokaryotes reveal a complex history for the GH20 family. In bacteria, multiple gene duplications
and lineage specific gene loss (and/or horizontal gene transfer) are required to explain the observed
taxonomic distribution. The last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes is likely to have possessed
at least one GH20 family member. At least one gene duplication before the divergence of animals,
plants and fungi as well as other lineage specific duplication events have given rise to multiple
paralogous subfamilies in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest that a second, divergent
subfamily of GH20 family genes present in animals derive from an independent prokaryotic source.
Our data suggest multiple convergent changes of functional roles of GH20 family members in
eukaryotes.
Conclusion: This study represents the first detailed evolutionary analysis of the glycosyl hydrolase
GH20 family. Mapping of data concerning physiological function of GH20 family members onto the
phylogenetic tree reveals that apparently convergent and highly lineage specific changes in substrate
specificity have occurred in multiple GH20 subfamilies.

Background
Carbohydrates are involved in many biological functions
including maintenance of cell structural integrity, energy
storage, pathogen defence, viral penetration, cellular signalling and fertilization. Enzymes specifically responsible
for carbohydrate hydrolysis have been classified in 111
families of glycosyl hydrolases (GH) on the basis of

amino acid sequence similarity [1,2]. Hexosaminidases
belong to families GH3, GH20 and GH84 [2]. Among
these, family 20 is of particular interest, and includes β-Nacetylhexosaminidases
(β-hexosaminidase)
(EC
3.2.1.52), enzymes that hydrolyze non-reducing terminal
β-1,4 linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or β-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues of oligosaccharides and

their conjugates, bacterial chitobiases (EC 3.2.1.30) and
lacto-N-biasidase (EC 3.2.1.140). Crystal structures are
known for numerous β-N-acetylhexosaminidases including the bacterial enzymes from Serratia marcescens [3] and
Streptomyces plicatus [4], and the α- and β-chains of human
lysosomal enzymes. The catalytic domain is an α/βTIMbarrel with the active site at the centre of the barrel complex [5-7].
In mammals, there are two major β-N-acetylhexosaminidase isoforms, named HEXA and HEXB, which reside in
lysosomes and participate in the degradation of glycoproteins, glycolipids and glycosaminoglycans. HEXA is a heterodimer of subunits α (encoded by the gene HEXA) and
β (encoded by the gene HEXB), whereas HEXB is a
homodimer of β subunits. The subunits arose via a gene
duplication event and the primary sequences are approximately 60% identical [8,9]. In particular, mutations in
human HEXA and HEXB genes cause Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff, fatal neurodegenerative diseases, respectively
[10,11]. Recent data suggest that lysosomal exoglycosidases along with many other factors may participate in the
progression of development of tumor cells [12]. The
potential involvement of a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase in
fertilization in hamster [13] and human [14] has been
also hypothesized.
Beta-hexosaminidases are also widely distributed in
Insects. Several studies have led to the identification,
molecular cloning and purification of β-N-acetylhexosaminidases in Lepidoptera like Manduca sexta [15], Spodoptera frugiperda [16], Bombyx mori [17], Trichoplusia ni
[18], Diptera like Drosophila melanogaster [19,20] and
Aedes aegypti [21] and more recently in the coleopteran
Tribolium Castaneum [22]. The β-hexosaminidase activity
of insects is of particular interest because of the role this
glycosidase plays in the alteration of the structures of Nglycans generated in the cells [16,22-24] and in the chitin
degradation processes [16,22,24,25]. Chitin, found in the
cuticle of the integument and peritrophic membrane of
the midgut, is a linear polymer of β-1,4 linked Nacetylglucosamine. Chitin degradation is catalyzed by
chitinolytic enzymes in two successive steps: chitinase (EC
3.2.1.14) hydrolizes chitin into oligosaccharides of GlcNAc, then β-N-acetylhexosaminidase further degrades the
oligomers into monomers. Because of the important role
of chitin, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase is considered to be a
potential target for insect control agents such as biopesticides [26,27]. Recently, the presence in the plasma membrane of spermatozoa of Drosophila melanogaster of two βN-acetylhexosaminidases potentially involved in spermegg interactions has been demonstrated [20,28].
In crustaceans, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase has been
shown to be important in the degradation of chitin form-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/214

ing the exoskeleton. Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases have
been purified and characterized in different species, such
as Euphausia superba [29] and Scylla serrata [30].
In the ascidian Phallusia mammillata a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase present in the plasma membrane of spermatozoa might have a role in the primary binding between
gametes [31].
In addition, an important function of a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase has been postulated in the anaerobic parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent
of infectious amoebiosis. Two β-N-acetylhexosaminidases
have been identified, cloned and characterized. These
enzymes are most probably involved in the destruction of
glycoconjugates of the extracellular matrix components to
pass basement membranes [32].
Hexosaminidase genes are also distributed among fungi
and bacteria and the enzyme family plays an important
physiological role in the natural recycling of chitin, a
structural component of cell wall [33,34]. The molecular
cloning of β-N-acetylhexosaminidases has been reported
for several bacteria, such as Alteromonas sp. Strain O-7
[35], Alteromonas sp. Strain 10S-24 [36], Serratia marcescens [3], Vibrio harveyi [37], Vibrio vulnificus [38]Enterobacter sp. Strain G1 [39], Cellulomonoas fimi [40] and
several fungi, such as Trichoderma harzianum [41], Trichoderma atroviride [42], Aspergillus oryzae [43], Aspergillus
nidulans [44] and Candida albicans [45]. Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase is an emerging target for the design of fungicides. In fact, several chitinolytic bacteria and fungi have
been shown to be powerful biological control agents protecting for example plants against pathogens [41,46-48].
Plant β-hexosaminidases have been detected in a variety
of tissues including seeds and leaves [49,50]. In particular,
high levels of β-N acetylhexosaminidase activity have
been detected in germinating seeds [50] suggesting a role
in the storage of glycoproteins [51]. A function in defence
processes has also been proposed, since several of the
purified β-N-acetylhexosaminidases could be chitindegrading enzymes [27,50]. More recently β-hexosaminidases of Arabidopsis thaliana have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level [52].
Despite the increasing number of hexosaminidase
homologs that have been identified in different species,
only restricted analyses of phylogenetic relationships
between glycosyl hydrolases of the GH20 family have
been conducted [3,16,22,24,31,40,53]. Because of their
important roles in several biological processes, we have
undertaken a more comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary history of the GH20 family. In this study we have
identified, analyzed and characterized β-N-acetylhex-

osaminidases from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We show
that while the GH20 family is widely distributed among
eubacteria, the observed taxonomic distribution is best
explained by a combination of gene duplications and horizontal gene transfer events. Likewise, the limited occurrence of the family in archaebacteria is probably the result
of lateral transfer from eubacteria. We trace gene duplication events both at basal and lineage-specific levels within
eukaryotes and demonstrate that while the most widely
studied GH20 family members derive from a single ancestral eukaryotic gene, a second subfamily of more divergent
sequences present in at least the majority of metazoans
was likely acquired from an independent prokaryotic
source. Finally, we describe the patterns of conservation of
protein features in numerous β-N-acetylhexosaminidase
subfamilies and relate these features to the current understanding of GH20 family function, an important exercise
given apparent convergence of physiological function of
non-orthologous GH20 enzymes in eukaryotes.

Results and discussion
Beta-hexosaminidase sequences
The β-hexosaminidase sequences in our study were recovered from numerous organisms, including prokaryotic
and eukaryotic species. Extensive similarity searches of the
CAZy, Pfam and Swiss-Prot databases resulted in the identification of around 300 complete prokaryotic or eukaryotic
β-hexosaminidase/β-hexosaminidase-like
gene
sequences encoding products belonging to the GH20 family (Table 1 and see additional file 1, 2, 3). Partial prokaryotic β-hexosaminidase sequences or those derived from
whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences that could not
be reliably reassembled have not been used in this work.
Vertebrate and non-vertebrate sequences show pairwise
amino acid identity ranging from 20 to 40%, whereas
identity is between 45% and 90% within mammals and
from 20% to 75% between the members of the two insect
orders examined here (Lepidoptera and Diptera).
Protein features and conserved
We observed hydrophobic sequences predicted to be a signal peptide with potential cleavage sites in the N-terminal
regions of all metazoan β-hexosaminidases (not shown),
except Hex3_Dm, Hex3_Dp, Hex2_Ag, that have a putative signal-anchor domain [20,24]. Moreover, SOSUI and
HMMTOP analyses identified one or two putative transmembrane helices in all sequences, but these predictions
have a low degree of confidence. Although β-hexosaminidases are typically soluble lysosomal proteins, they have
been also found in body fluids in mammals [54-58], in
insects [20,59-61] and in plants [52]. The presence of βhexosaminidases in an extracellular compartment is not
surprising. It is in fact known that lysosomal hydrolases
can be released through constitutive secretion or through
lysosomal exocytosis [57,62,63]. Furthermore, β-N-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/214

acetylhexosaminidases are present as intrinsic proteins of
the plasma membrane in insects [20,24], in ascidians
[31], in plants [52], in vertebrates, including man
[13,14,64] as well as in a variety of human somatic cells
[65,66]. Thus, it could be hypothesized that the membrane-associated β-N-acetylhexosaminidase might be
generated by a deficient cleavage of the signal peptide
sequence, as demonstrated for other transmembrane proteins that are also present as soluble enzymes [20,67-70].
If the signal peptide were not cleaved, the enzyme would
be a type II plasma membrane protein with an anchor
sequence, as demonstrated in a few human sperm and
fruit fly proteins [14,20,28,70].
A multiple alignment of representative β-hexosaminidase
protein sequences is shown in Figure 1. Amino acids
belonging to six of the eight motifs known to be a signature for GH20 family are highly conserved (SPRINTS database; [71]), while amino acids in the first and fifth motifs
are much less conserved. In particular we observe greater
difference in β-hexosaminidase protein sequences of the
dipteran species, while β-hexosaminidase of the lepidopteran Spodoptera frugiperda is very similar to mammalian
β-hexosaminidases – as previously indicated [16]. Residues involved in substrate binding (Asp196, Asp208, Arg211,
Asp354, Tyr450, Glu491 – human HEXB numbering) and the
triad aspartate (Asp240), histidine (His294), glutamate
(Glu355) – known to be the amino acids involved in catalysis in human HEXB- are completely conserved [5,6]. Six
cysteine residues (Cys91-Cys137, Cys309-Cys360 and Cys534Cys551 – human HEXB numbering) form three disulfide
bonds in human HEXB [72] and the third disulfide bond
has been demonstrated to be important for enzymatic
activity [73]. Only the cysteine residues involved in the
second disulfide bond are fully conserved – suggesting
that the disulfide bonds cannot be considered a conserved
feature of all β-hexosaminidases. The tyrosine-456 and
alanine-543 of β-chain in human HEXB play an important role in dimerization since they form hydrophobic
interactions with the isoleucine-454, tyrosine-492 and
threonine-496 of the second β-subunit [5]. As shown in
Figure 1, tyrosine-456 is conserved in ascidians, nematodes and fish, while in fungi, insects and in the slime
mould Dictyostelium it is replaced by different amino acid
residues. Conversely, only in Caenorhabditis and Dictyostelium is the alanine residue not conserved. Although dimerization is considered a prerequisite for the formation of
catalytically active enzymes in metazoans, our observations do not preclude that the enzymes dimerize and are
active, as recently demonstrated in insects [16,20].
Figure 2 shows the multiple alignments of several eukaryotic β-hexosaminidases that have been defined as members of glycoside hydrolase family 20 in the CAZy and
NCBI databases, but which do not show extensive global

sequence similarity to other GH20 family members. DIALIGN found only a conserved region (seven amino acids)
containing the glutamate residue that is involved in the
catalytic mechanism of hexosaminidase [53]. We have
recovered additional eukaryotic and prokaryotic β-hexosaminidase sequences (See additional file 2, 3) that
appear to be homologs of these sequences. MEME, a tool
to discover conserved motifs in a set of unaligned protein
sequences (See Methods), detected the presence of conserved regions different from those known to be distinctive of β-hexosaminidases of GH20 (Figure 2). However,
further research will be necessary to clarify the biochemical and functional role of these highly conserved regions.
Four gene products from C. elegans [GenBank:
AAA96105.3, CAI06053.1, CAO72177.1, CAA22078.2]
belong to this subfamily of GH20 and it has been recently
demonstrated that they show β-hexosaminidase activity
[53]. However, no data were presented on other amino
acids involved in substrate binding and catalysis except
the glutamate residue [5,6]. Further experiments are necessary to determine the enzyme activity of the probable
orthologs to these C. elegans genes – which show most
similarity to divergent GH20 proteins from low G+C gram
positive bacteria, planctomycetes and a single crenarcheote (Thermofilum pendens) (See additional file 2, 3).
Conservation and evolution of gene structure
Figure 3 and Additional file 4 show the lengths of introns
and exons of a representative sample of the β-hexosaminidase genes examined in this study, obtained with Exalign
[74]. Within the vertebrate Hex1 and Hex2 subfamilies,
the numbers and lengths of exons are remarkably conserved, together with intron phase. Vertebrate Hex1 and
Hex2 isoforms are universally encoded by 14 exons.
Among sampled species, only Gallus gallus shows a small

degree of exon slippage of exons 4, 5 and 6 (which might
be due to misannotations), while different lengths of initial and terminal exons (which include UTR sequences)
are not unexpected. It is interesting that one of the β-hexosaminidase genes identified (Hex2_Ci) on the genome
of the ascidian C. intestinalis has also conserved the size of
several exons corresponding to vertebrate exons 2, 6, 7,
8,11, 12 and 13, consistent with this structure representing an ancestral chordate layout. Genes from more basal
organisms (arthropods and nematodes) show a more variable structure in terms of intron number and position; no
significant similarities with vertebrate genes were noted at
the level of gene structure. Unsurprisingly, we observe
similar gene structures also between pairs of Drosophila
species, such as D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, both
in number or size of exons and in intron phase. On the
other hand, in the nematode C. elegans only two β-hexosaminidases [GenBank: AAA91263.1, AAA96105.3] are
encoded by 10 exons, while the other three β-hexosaminCAO72177.1,
idases
[GenBank:
CAI06053.1,
CAA22078.2] show a more variable structure in terms of
exon number and position and intron phase (data not
shown).
Phylogenetic Analyses of β-hexosaminidase Sequences
Given the high degree of sequence divergence and indications of extensive saturation of substitutions at the nucleotide level (not shown), all phylogenetic analyses were
performed on inferred full length amino acid sequences
exhibiting overall co-linearity. Two separate datasets were
prepared in order to maximize the number of unambiguously aligned amino acid residues used in phylogenetic
analyses. The first set contained only eukaryote sequences
showing overall co-linearity of alignment (76 sequences,
274 amino acid positions), the second included a the
majority of eukaryote and prokaryote sequences – with

Figure sequence alignments of representative β-hexosaminidase proteins
Multiple sequence alignments of representative β-hexosaminidase proteins. The sequences were aligned with Muscle [87]. The eight motifs known to be a signature for GH20 family are shaded in grey. Residues involved in substrate binding
are blue and shaded in grey. The solid arrowheads indicated the amino acid residues that form the catalytic triad in human
HEXB [5,6]. Tyrosine and alanine residues that play an important role in dimerization of two subunits in human HEXB [5] are
white in black background. Cysteines involved in the formation of disulfide bonds in human HEXB [72] are red.

Exon and intron patterns of representative genes of metazoan β-hexosaminidases of GH20 family. Exon and
intron patterns of representative genes of metazoan β-hexosaminidase of GH20 family, used in this study and drawn to scale
relative to the number of nucleotides presenting each region (see additional file). Exons are represented with a rectangle, and
homologous exons are depicted by a similar fill pattern. Gray filled rectangles represent non homologous exons in the ascidian
C. intestinalis. Introns are depicted by a line between exons.
only representatives of groups of highly similar sequences
from closely related organisms removed to reduce the
computational complexity of analysis of the large resulting dataset (233 sequences, 223 amino acid positions) –
see materials and methods. A Bayesian phylogeny of the
prokaryote and eukaryote dataset is shown in Figure 4,
where the tree is rooted arbitrarily.
The GH20 family does not appear to be distributed evenly
among bacterial phyla. Indeed, the majority of available
sequences are derived from the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firimcutes, the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi (CFB) group
and Acidobacteria. Our phylogenetic analyses recover sev-

eral well-supported clades containing members of welldefined taxonomic groups. For example, beta-proteobacterial and the majority of the gamma proteobacterial
sequences are recovered as a well-supported monophyletic group which has a moderately supported association with some alpha-proteobacterial sequences.
However, other gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria fall in
disparate positions in the tree while Actinobacteria also
fall in at least two clusters. Analogously, the Bayesian
analysis recovers disparate clades of sequences derived
from members of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. These data
suggest either ancient gene duplications or multiple horizontal gene transfer events within bacteria. We note that

both Bayesian posterior probability and, in particular,
bootstrap support for deep level relationships between
groups is consistently low, prohibiting strong inferences
regarding the evolution of the gene family in prokaryotes.
Indeed analysis of constrained tree topologies using the
Shimodaira/Hasegawa test suggested that a variety of relationships between the well defined groups indicated in
Figure 3 were not significantly worse explanations of the
data than the Bayesian consensus tree (not shown). It is
thus impossible to judge whether an ancient origin of the
GH20 family in bacteria was followed by multiple gene
duplications and lineage specific losses of paralogs or
whether the GH20 family arose within a discrete bacterial
phylum and that the observed current distribution is a
result of extensive lateral transfer coupled with occasional
gene duplication. Interestingly, a well supported clade
consisting mainly of sequences derived from Firmicutes
(herein the "Firmicute" clade) also includes several
sequences from CFB group bacteria, members of the
Chlamydia/Verrucomicrobia group, a single Actinobacterial sequence, several members of the Thermatogae, several Chloroflexi and the few Archaebacterial sequences
identified in this study. Taken together with the discontinuous presence GH20 family genes in Archaebacteria, Thermatogae, Chlamydiae and other bacterial taxa (and their
apparent absence from other major bacterial groups (eg.
Cyanobacteria), we suggest that extensive horizontal gene
transfer has played a significant role in generating the
observed taxonomic distribution of GH20 family members in prokaryotes.
The eukaryotic sequences are recovered as two principal
monophyletic groups, each with high bootstrap support
and Bayesian posterior probability. The moderately-supported sister taxa to the first eukaryote clade (Eukaryote
clade A (Figure 5) – which includes most of the sequences
which have been subjected to functional analyses (see
below)) is a paraphyletic assemblage of Acidobacterial
and Proteobacterial species. While a second assemblage of
divergent metazoan sequences (Eukaryote clade B – Figure
6) is recovered as a moderately supported sister to several
CFB group proteins within the aforementioned "Firmicute" clade. Despite extensive constrained tree searches,
we were unable to identify topologies portraying these
two eukaryotic clades as a monophyletic group that were
not excluded by the Shimodaira/Hasegawa test (not
shown). While, the current data argue strongly for two
acquisitions of GH20 family genes by eukaryotes (one in
a common ancestor of plants, animals, fungi and mycetozoa, and another potentially in an early metazoan) the
aforementioned considerations render speculation as to
the nature of the prokaryote donors premature.
It is notable that sequences from the parasitic protist Trichomonas vaginalis are recovered within a well-supported

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/214

clade of sequences from CFB group bacteria. Indeed, this
case of probable prokaryote to eukaryote horizontal gene
transfer was explicitly noted during the characterization of
the genome of this parabasalid flagellate [75].
To better understand the evolution of the GH20 family
within eukaryotes, we performed Bayesian – and maximum likelihood bootstrap – phylogenetic analyses of
unambiguously aligned regions of inferred eukaryote
clade A protein sequences (Figure 5). Vertebrate alpha and
beta chains constitute monophyletic groups and are each
others well supported sisters. The emergence of tunicate
sequences as the monophyletic sister group of the vertebrate forms is consistent with a gene duplication in a common ancestor of vertebrates after the divergence of
tunicates. Well-supported clusters of arthropod, nematode and schistosome sequences emerge basal to the tunicate clade.
A second, well-supported, cluster of arthropod sequences
emerges in a distinct part of Eukaryote clade A (Figure 5).
Indeed, the Bayesian analysis also recovers two clusters of
plant, fungal and mycetozoan sequences – suggesting that
a gene duplication event occurred in a common ancestor
of plants, animals and fungi. However, it is not possible
to position the root of the tree in such a way as to explain
these multiple clusters with a single duplication event. We
therefore investigated alternative hypotheses to explain
the observed distribution of GH20 paralogs using constrained phylogenetic trees. We were unable to generate
constrained topologies in which plant or arthropod
sequences are monophyletic that were not statistically
worse explanations of the data than the Bayesian topology
according to the Shimodaira/Hasegawa (SH) test implemented in TREE-PUZZLE although all fungal sequences
can be constrained as monophyletic as can mycetozoan
(Entamoeba and Dictyostelium) sequences (which emerge
close together in the bootstrap consensus tree). Several
topologies describing plausible organismal relationships
and invoking a single ancestral gene duplication in
eukaryotes are not rejected by the SH test (See additional
file 5) and the GH20 sequence data is thus compatible
with current hypotheses of deep level organismal relationships within eukaryotes [76] and does not require invocation of eukaryote to eukaryote gene transfer as an
explanation. While the monophyly, or otherwise, of fungal sequences cannot be established with confidence, the
current data suggest that the observed diversity of arthropod and plant GH20 family genes result in part from
ancient duplications that occurred before the divergence
of plants and animals. However, subsequent "local" gene
duplications have also occurred in both lineages. This
phenomenon is particularly notable in plant clade I and
in animal clade II – where successive gene duplications

Sequence similarity searches of the DOE Joint Genome
Institute eukaryotic genome databases and other eukaryotic genome projects recover a large number of sequences
that clearly derive from the GH20 family. Given the low
quality of annotation and the widespread occurrence of
potentially prokaryotic contaminants in such databases
we have omitted such sequences from our phylogentic

analyses. However, it is clear that the GH20 family is represented in all but a few major eukaryotic lineages. Taxa
where complete or nearly complete genome sequences are
available but where we were unable to recover traces of
GH20 genes in at least one genome were restricted to
divergent protists and unicellular organisms with secondarily reduced genomes: Diplomonads, Euglenozoa, Apicomplexa,

Two acquisitions of GH20 family genes by eukaryotes?
The Eukaryote clade B sequences (Figure 6) while conserved between each other, are characterized by generally
high levels of divergence from the "Firmicute" clade in
which they are embedded. Sequence similarity searches of
the JGI eukaryotic genome databases revealed convincing
traces of clade B sequences on the genomes of the cnidarian Nematostella [JGI:82909, JGI:245803], the placozoan
Trichoplax [JGI:23741, JGI:2986, JGI:2419, JGI:51551],
the mollusk Lottia [JGI:140764, JGI:235755] and the
annelid Capitella [JGI:235755]. Unfortunately all associated gene predictions were of rather low quality and either
incomplete or including apparently un-detected introns
(or highly divergent insertions) and lacking in supporting
EST evidence. Accordingly they were not used in phylogenetic analyses. However, the presence of highly conserved
potentially coding sequences in these genomes (and the
absence of such traces in the genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga and other protist, fungal and plant
genomes) is of some considerable interest. Our data are
consistent with the proposition of Gutternigg et al. [53]
that eukayotes have obtained GH20 family members
from at least two phylogenetically distinct sources. The
apparent absence of clade B sequences from non-metazoan genomes suggests a lateral transfer event into a basal
metazoan, although an earlier acquisition – and subsequent loss from plant, protist and fungal genomes – can
not be excluded. The strong statistical support for the
monophyly of the "Firmicute" clade in which these and
other more divergent sequences are embedded (Figure 4),
our failure to identify acceptable topologies in which
Eukaryote clade A and B sequences represent sister groups
and the apparent absence of excessively long branches in
this clade (not shown) lead us to prefer the hypothesis

that these sequences represent a truly monophyletic
assemblage rather than a phylogenetic artifact resulting
from independent accelerations in evolutionary rates and
resulting "long-branch attraction" between unrelated
sequences.
Evolution of substrate specificity in Eukaryote GH20
family members
The phylogenetic hypotheses presented here may be used
to understand the evolution of GH20 family functionality
in eukaryotes. While our phylogenetic reconstructions do
not allow reliable rooting of the eukaryote tree or permit
us to understand the evolutionary position of the more
divergent GH20 isoforms, many clades and relationships
are robustly supported. In this light it is informative to
map functional data onto the trees. One of the most
important differences between vertebrate and insects/
worms/plants N-linked glycosylation is the presence of
the paucimannosidic N-glycans structures in the second
group. For example, the insect fdl genes are closely related
to the Hexo1 and Hexo2 genes of insects. The fdl gene
products are involved in the formation of paucimannosidic N-glycans [24,53], while Hexo1 and Hexo2 gene
products (as well as fungal GH20 proteins [34]) are
believed to function as degradative enzymes (exochitinases) [24]. Plant clade II sequences also have an exochitinase-like function, as recently demonstrated in
Arabidopsis thaliana [52]. In this light it can be seen as
likely that the ancestral activity for the plant, fungal and
insect clade II sequences was likely to be as an exochitinase and that the fdl gene products have undergone a
change in substrate specificity towards N-glycans. The animal Clade I sequences have been shown to be involved in
the degradation of oligosaccharide chains of glycopro-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:214

teins and glycolipids [7,77], although the proteins
encoded by the lepidoptera Spodoptera frugiperda genes
have been shown to be also responsible for the generation
of paucimannosidic N-glycans [16,78], and might potentially represent a second example of functional shift
within insects. Plant clade I sequences have been demonstrated to participate in the biosynthesis of truncated Nlinked oligosaccharides and degradation of chitooligosaccharides [52,53]. Furthermore, the C. elegans hexosaminidase emerging in animal clade I likely has a role as a
exochitinase [53] and may represent another example of a
functional shift. We note that Drosophila species are not
represented in clade I and speculate that their need for Nglycan-metabolizing β-hexosaminidases is fulfilled by the
fdl gene product. Moreover, nematode and insect N-glycan hexosaminidases are membrane-bound proteins and
are not localized in the lysosomes, while in plants the
processing of N-glycans to paucimannosidic saccharides is
in the vacuole [24]. An understanding of the functional
roles of the Mycetozoan proteins which provide one with
best candidates for the most ancient divergence in the
eukaryote tree might be the key to understanding the
nature of the ancestral enzyme activity. However, functional characterization of the slime mould Dictyostelium
GH20 protein has not been published and biochemical
data of the β-N-acetylglucosaminidases of Entamoeba histolytica do not allow strong inference as to the substrate
specificity of these amoebozoan enzymes [79]. Furthermore, although we have observed high conservation of
amino acids involved in substrate binding (see above), a
crystal structure of a β-hexosaminidase involved in paucimannosidic N-glycans formation might provide precise
information about the characteristics of active sites of βhexosaminidases that display exochitinase activity.
Despite the incompleteness of functional information,
the phylogenetic tree presented in Figure 5 suggests that
synthesis of paucimanosidic glycans is a derived characteristic that has evolved independently on at least 3 occasions. Finally, Gutternigg et al. [53] showed that two clade
B C. elegans gene products [GenBank: AAA96105.3,
CAI06053.1] are involved in the metabolism of paucimannosidic N-glycans, while other two nematode β-hexosaminidases
have

activity
[GenBank: CAO72177.1; CAA22078.2]. The functional
roles of the vertebrate sequences that appear to be most
closely related to these divergent nematode genes (see
above and additional file 3) remain obscure.

Conclusion
Our phylogenetic analyses of GH20 family proteins provides new insights into evolutionary relationships and the
history of the protein family and represent the first such
detailed study of the GH20 protein family. We show that
eukaryote sequences derive from two independent gene
acquisitions. The most widely studied group of genes was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/214

present in a common ancestor of plants animals and fungi
and the ancestral sequence underwent at least one gene
duplication event early in eukaryote evolution gaving rise
to at least two paralogs that evolved differential functions
as degradative enzymes or a processing activity involved
in the synthesis of paucimannosidic N-linked oligosaccharides. Despite these ancient roles, members of both
subfamilies of eukaryote clade A have undergone apparent functional shifts, typified by the FDL proteins of
insects which appear to be derived from exochitinase-like
ancestors but which now play a role in the metabolism of
paucimannisodic N-glycans. Conversely, the C. elegans
sequence represented in Figure 5 is derived from paucimannisodic glycan proccessing enzymes, but functions as
an exochitinase [53]. Indeed, the mammalian isoforms
also derived from paucimannosidic N-glycans proccessing
enzymes, but exhibit specificity towards the more complex oligosaccharides present in mammal cells. It remains
unclear whether these differences reflect differential substrate specificities, or are more related to physiological
patterns of expression.
Our data lend strong support to the contention of Gutternigg et al. [53] that more divergent GH20 family members from C. elegans and other metazoa are likely to be
derived from a separate acquisition from prokaryotes.
While the physiological roles of these proteins have not
yet been studied experimentally outside of nematodes, it
is unlikely that they should be involved in the production
of paucimannosidic N-glycans in mammals, and it is thus
probable that additional important roles for GH20 members remain to be discovered in animals.

Methods
Sequence retrieval
All characterized and complete β-N-acetylhexosaminidases protein sequences belonging to the GH20 family
were retrieved from CAZy [2], Pfam [80] and Swiss-Prot
[81] databases. In order to retrieve all the other β-Nacetylhexosaminidase sequences available we performed
PSI-BLAST searches of the protein database throughout all
organisms at NCBI [82] and through translated BLAST
searches (tBLASTn) against the full genomic sequences
available at the UCSC genome browser [83], using Homo
sapiens protein sequences HEXA [GenBank: AAB00965.1]
and HEXB [GenBank: AAA52645.1], Arabidopsis thaliana
β-N-acetylhexosaminidase-like
protein
[GenBank:
AAM61367.1], Danio rerio Zgc:112084 protein [GenBank:
AAH93192.1], Drosophila melanogaster protein sequences
HEXO1 [GenBank: AAF47881.1], HEXO2 [GenBank:
AAM48390.1] and FDL [GenBank: AAM29423.1], and
Streptomyces plicatus β-N-acetylhexosaminidase protein
[GenBank: AAC38798.3] as queries, respectively. Only
complete and representative protein sequences were
employed for subsequent evolutionary study and protein

analysis. For proteins with possible splice variants the
longest predicted isoforms were used. A total of 223 protein sequences distributed across Eubacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes, were selected for the analysis of
protein features and phylogenetic study (Table 1 and See
additional file 1, 2, 3). In this study, we denote β-N-acetylhexosaminidase proteins as Hex followed by Arabic
number when two or more β-N-acetylhexosaminidase
proteins have been identified in the same organism and
the abbreviation of genus and species name (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 β-N-acetylhexosaminidase will
be denoted as Hex1_Bfr).
Protein sequence analysis of β-N-acetylhexosaminidases
Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase sequences were analyzed
using SignalP 3.0 [84], with default options to predict signal peptide sequences; SOSUI [85] and HMMTOP [86]
with default parameters for the prediction of transmembrane helices; SMART [87] to predict the domain architecture. Conserved motif analysis was performed by MEME
program [88] using default settings.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
In order to maximize the number of unambiguously
aligned sites used for phylogenetic analysis of eukaryote
sequences, two separate datasets were prepared. The first
set contained only eukaryote sequences which passed tests
of compositional homogeneity implemented in TREEPUZZLE [89] while the second included available
prokaryote sequences (several clusters of extremely closely
related sequences from taxonomically similar bacteria
were excluded to reduce the computational burden of
phylogenetic analyses).

In both cases, inferred protein sequences were aligned
with the software Muscle [90] and alignments refined
manually. Unambiguously aligned regions were identified using the program GBlocks [91]. The resulting datasets contained 233 sequences with 223 amino acid
positions (prokaryote and eukaryote dataset) and 76
sequences with 274 amino acid positions (eukaryote-only
dataset). The WAG amino acid substitution model [92]
with gamma distributed site rates and an invariable site
category was used in all phylogenetic analyses as the Prottest software [93] indicated that this model provided the
best fit to the data. Phylogenetic trees were estimated
within the Bayesian statistical framework using a parallelized version of the program MrBayes v3.1 [94] on a
cluster of processors running the linux operating system
(2000000 generations with trees sampled every 50 generations). The first 5000 trees generated were excluded as
"burnin" for the MCMC chains (likelihood stabilization
was determined graphically). The program SEQBOOT
from the PHYLIP [95] package was used to generate 100
pseudoreplicate datasets, maximum-likelihood trees were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/214

estimated for each replicate using the program PHYML
[96] and consensus trees were inferred using the program
CONSENSE. Constrained trees were generated manually
and evaluated according to the Shimodaira/Hasegawa test
of alternative tree topologies [97] as implemented in
TREE-PUZZLE.
