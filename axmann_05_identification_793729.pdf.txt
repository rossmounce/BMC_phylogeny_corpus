Abstract

information

Conclusion: This is the first genome-wide and systematic screen for ncRNAs in cyanobacteria.
Several ncRNAs were both computationally predicted and their presence was biochemically
verified. These RNAs may have regulatory functions and each shows a distinct phylogenetic
distribution. Our approach can be applied to any group of microorganisms for which more than
one total genome sequence is available for comparative analysis.

interactions

Results: Based on a computational prediction we show the presence of several ncRNAs
(cyanobacterial functional RNA or Yfr) in several different cyanobacteria of the ProchlorococcusSynechococcus lineage. Some ncRNA genes are present only in two or three of the four strains
investigated, whereas the RNAs Yfr2 through Yfr5 are structurally highly related and are encoded
by a rapidly evolving gene family as their genes exist in different copy numbers and at different sites
in the four investigated genomes. One ncRNA, Yfr7, is present in at least seven other
cyanobacteria. In addition, control elements for several ribosomal operons were predicted as well
as riboswitches for thiamine pyrophosphate and cobalamin.

Background: Whole genome sequencing of marine cyanobacteria has revealed an unprecedented
degree of genomic variation and streamlining. With a size of 1.66 megabase-pairs, Prochlorococcus
sp. MED4 has the most compact of these genomes and it is enigmatic how the few identified
regulatory proteins efficiently sustain the lifestyle of an ecologically successful marine
microorganism. Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) control a plethora of processes in eukaryotes
as well as in bacteria; however, systematic searches for ncRNAs are still lacking for most
eubacterial phyla outside the enterobacteria.

Background

Cyanobacteria constitute a huge and diverse group of photoautotrophic bacteria that perform oxygenic photosynthesis
and populate widely diverse environments such as freshwater, the oceans, the surface of rocks, desert soil or the Antarctic. Their existence can be traced back by fossil records
possibly up to 3.5 billion years [1].
Because of its small cell size of less than one micron and its
requirement for special isolation and cultivation procedures,
the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus had
escaped discovery until just a decade ago [2,3]. In contrast to
the majority of cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus shares with
Prochlorothrix hollandica and Prochloron sp. the presence of
a protein-chlorophyll b complex for photosynthetic light harvesting [4,5]. The presence of chlorophyll b had previously
been taken as evidence for a separate phylum, the prochlorophyta, to join these three taxa. Molecular evidence has shown,
however, that Prochlorococcus, Prochlorothrix and Prochloron are not closely related to each other [6].
Cyanobacteria of the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus constitute the most important primary producers
within the oceans [7]. Of these, the four marine cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus marinus MED4, MIT 9313, SS120 and
Synechococcus sp. WH 8102 share a 16S ribosomal RNA
identity of more than 97%. In the natural environment,
Prochlorococcus exists in two distinct 'ecotypes' that thrive at
different light optima and constitute distinct phylogenetic
clades [8,9]. Thus, the genomes of the low-light-adapted isolates Prochlorococcus MIT 9313 and SS120, and of the highlight-adapted MED4 differ by hundreds of genes, facilitating
their specialization to different niches within the marine ecosystem [10-12].
An extreme genome minimization occurred in MED4 and
SS120 [13], which is thought to be an adaptation to the very
oligotrophic and stable environment from which these two
strains originated [10,12]. The MED4 strain was isolated from
a depth of 5 m in the Mediterranean Sea; its genome of 1.66
megabase pairs (Mbp) encodes 1,716 open reading frames,
among them only four histidine kinases, six response regulators and five sigma factors [12]. Prochlorococcus SS120 originated from 120 m in the Sargasso Sea [3], and 1,884
predicted protein-coding genes, including five histidine
kinases, six response regulators and five sigma factors, have
been annotated for its 1.7 Mbp genome [10]. These data indicate a drastically reduced number of systems for signal transduction and environmental stress response (e.g. twocomponent systems) compared to the larger and more complex genomes of cyanobacteria such as Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, which each harbour 42
and 126 histidine kinases, respectively [14,15]. The small
number of regulatory genes in marine Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus may reflect a more stable environment, in
which reactive regulatory responses are less relevant.

It is now becoming increasingly clear that aside from regulatory proteins, bacteria also possess a significant number of
regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These are a heterogeneous group of functional RNA molecules normally without a
protein-coding function. They are frequently smaller than
200 nucleotides (nt) in size, and act to regulate mRNA translation/decay but can also bind to proteins and thereby modify
protein function (for a recent review see [16]). It is well established that such RNAs control plasmid and viral replication
[17], transposition of transposable elements [18], bacterial
virulence [19], quorum sensing [20] and are important factors in bacterial regulatory networks that respond to environmental changes [21,22]. As a result of recent systematic
searches, more than 60 ncRNAs are now known in
Escherichia coli, most of which had been overlooked by traditional genome analysis [23-28]. Many of these versatile bacterial riboregulators use base pairing interactions to regulate
the translation of target mRNAs. Because most of these antisense-acting ncRNAs have only incomplete target complementarity, duplex formation frequently depends on the
activity of Hfq, an RNA chaperone, which is structurally and
functionally somewhat similar to eukaryotic Sm proteins
[29]. Only very recently, an hfq homologue was predicted in
cyanobacterial genomes, including two of the strains used in
this study (Synechococcus WH 8102 and Prochlorococcus
MIT 9313) [29]. This lends support to the idea that riboregulatory processes similar to those of enterobacteria should
exist in cyanobacteria.

Computational screening and experimental testing
identifies novel RNA species
An overview of the computational screening is displayed in
Figure 2 and a summary of the highest scoring clusters is
given in Table 1. The analysis was basically focused on
sequence and structure similarities. Detailed information on
all clusters predicted by our method, including the positions
of all sequences, is available online [34].
Although the sequence similarities between the predicted
RNA elements in cyanobacteria and other organisms were
weak, for many of the clusters, clues for their possible function could be obtained from the literature. These included elements that, according to location or structure, might be
functionally related to enterobacterial mRNA leader regions
mediating the autogenous control of r-protein and rRNA
expression (clusters 5, 92, 227, 228) [35,36], the rpoBC
leader (cluster 245) [37] and the likely terminator (cluster
226). We decided against direct experimental analysis of
these elements, which are less likely to be novel types of
ncRNAs. Additionally, two possible riboswitches for thiamine
pyrophosphate (cluster 2) [38] and cobalamin (cluster 101)
[39] were excluded from further experimental investigations.

information

In the remaining clusters, all candidate sequences from
MED4 were tested by Northern hybridization. This restriction was introduced in order to focus the experimental analysis on one particular strain. Each of these seven candidate
regions was probed for transcripts from both strands. Three
distinct ncRNAs and a group of four related ones yielded
strong signals with RNA preparations from MED4. Because

Total RNA samples from the four marine cyanobacteria
Prochlorococcus MED4, MIT 9313, SS120 and Synechococcus WH 8102 were separated on high-resolution polyacrylamide gels to get an overview of the presence of small RNAs.
This analysis showed abundant RNA molecules with sizes in
the range 50 to 250 nt (Figure 1). A particularly abundant
class of RNAs in the 70 to 90 nt size range indicates the location of tRNAs in this gel, which was confirmed by hybridization to the tRNASer [GCU]. The hybridization signal for this
tRNA was located at the upper end of this abundant cluster of
bands, consistent with the fact that it is the largest annotated
tRNA in these genomes. Several small RNAs migrated above
the tRNA cluster and very few below it (indicated by the
weakly visible bands below the tRNAs). These bands collec-

Several additional bands in the investigated size range indicate the presence of additional abundant small mRNAs or
ncRNAs. The lack of specific oligonucleotide probes for
hybridisation, however, makes it difficult to get information
about these. We thus used a computational prediction to
identify candidates for further testing.

refereed research

Small RNAs in marine cyanobacteria

Eubacterial RNA species, however, very rarely reach a concentration that allows direct identification in a gel. For known
RNA species and their possible precursors or degradation
products, information on their expression can be gained from
hybridization. Here we used oligonucleotide probes for the
scRNA and tmRNA and, as controls, the 5S rRNA and
tRNASer [GCU], which was predicted to be the tRNA with the
highest molecular mass. The lengths of the scRNAs in the four
strains vary between 90 and 100 nt, in keeping with the varying lengths of the respective annotated ffs genes. The 5S
rRNA was detected as a very abundant RNA species together
with two precursors. Furthermore, the results of these Northern hybridizations confirmed that Prochlorococcus tmRNA is
indeed composed of two separate molecules [30].

reports

There is currently no information about the presence of regulatory RNAs and their genes in marine cyanobacteria. Apart
from rRNA and tRNA genes, only three other well-characterized RNA genes have been annotated by sequence similarity
in each of the four genomes used in this study. These encode
the RNA components of RNAse P (M1 RNA), the signal recognition particle (scRNA) and tmRNA (rnpB, ffs and ssrA,
respectively). Although the Prochlorococcus tmRNA has not
been analyzed experimentally so far, it was subject to several
in silico analyses, predicting it would consist of two separate
molecules derived from a common precursor [30,31]. Such a
permuted gene structure producing a two-piece mature
tmRNA results in a dramatically reduced number of secondary structure elements: only two pairings were predicted in
the tRNA-like domain, and a single transient pseudoknot and
three other stem-loops were computed for the molecule containing the tag reading frame, whereas the pseudoknot
number alone is five in one-piece cyanobacterial tmRNA [30].
It remains unclear, however, what, if any, selective advantage
such a simplification in the structural elements of this RNA
species would bring. This prompts the question of whether
number and complexity of ncRNAs in these organisms is generally reduced as seen with tmRNA and regulatory proteins.
And if so, what kind of ncRNAs might have escaped such an
elimination and simplification process?
Systematic searches for ncRNAs are still lacking for most
eubacterial phyla outside the enterobacteria. Recently, an
effective approach to score multiple alignments in terms of
secondary structure conservation was suggested [32,33].
Using a comparative genomics approach based on the
recently published genome sequences, we have predicted
candidates for ncRNAs in four marine cyanobacteria. The
expression of these candidate sequences was tested under
various growth and stress conditions that are encountered in
the natural environment. This resulted in the identification of
seven new ncRNAs in MED4, and several homologues in the
other three strains.

Pipeline 2 comparative prediction of non-coding RNAs
Pipeline for comparative prediction of non-coding RNAs. (a) Intergenic sequences (IGRs) longer than 49 base-pairs were gathered from four
Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus genomes and locally aligned using BLASTN. An overview of the intergenic sequences is given in Additional data file 2
(Table S4). Because of the initial asymmetric local alignment using BLASTN (see Figure 2b for a summary of significant BLASTN hits between the strains
Prochlorococcus MED4 (MED), MIT 9313 (MIT), SS120 (SS) and Synechococcus WH 8102 (WH)), all candidate sequences were reverse-complemented.
Redundancy in this data set was reduced by unifying those hits from each genome that showed a reciprocal overlap of 85% or greater. This candidate set
was used as both query and subject in another local alignment step (BLASTN considering only the query strand as possible subject strand). Sequences that
directly produced a significant blast hit (E-value ≤ 10-10), or were connected by a chain of such hits, were gathered into clusters ('single-linkage clustering').
Both genome strands were screened; thus, the pipeline produced 310 pairs of clusters in both forward and reverse complementary orientation. After an
additional unification step of overlapping sequences within each cluster, the resulting clusters and their complement clusters were scored using ALIFOLDZ
[33]. (b) The number of BLASTN high-scoring segment pairs for each query and subject combination of intergenic regions is given for a BLASTN E-value

some of these ncRNAs have a phylogenetic distribution
beyond Prochlorococcus (see below), we introduced a more
general gene designation, yfr (for cyanobacterial functional

RNA-coding gene), and Yfr for the respective RNAs. Each of
these genes is discussed in detail in the following sections.

RNA elements were predicted according to the scheme shown in Figure 2. The total number of sequences in each cluster and the distribution within
the four compared genomes plus the total alignment length are given. The elements are ordered according to the lowest score in either forward (Z)
or reverse (Z rev) orientation (in bold letters). The lower the Z-score the higher the support for structural conservation. Exp (experimental testing):
+, tested positively by Northern hybridisation; NT, not tested. The cluster identities (CLID) were also used in Table 2. For further details and exact
positions of sequences see Table 2 and [34].

The yfr1 gene was detected in three of the four cyanobacteria
in the intergenic region separating guaB and trxA (Figure 3).
In the computational screening only the Yfr1 RNAs from MIT
9313 and WH 8102 were detected with a reasonable Z-score

of -3.97 and the MED4 sequence was identified with relaxed
BLASTN parameters manually. Although the two adjacent
genes guaB and trxA are located in a similar genomic
arrangement in SS120, a yfr1 gene was not found at this or
any other genomic position nor indicated by a Northern

sequence divergence of the guaB-trxA intergenic spacer in
SS120 compared to MED4, MIT 9313 and WH 8102.

trxA TIS and TATA box are shifted upstream by about 20 nt
compared to the other three strains (Figure 3a), lends additional support for the absence of a yfr1 gene.

The direction of yfr1 is conserved between MED4, MIT 9313
and WH 8102. It is transcribed in the same direction as the
mRNAs from two close-by neighbouring genes, indicating the
possibility of cotranscription. Therefore, we searched for the
presence of specific transcriptional initiation sites (TIS) for
yfr1 and for trxA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE). A conserved TIS was mapped for yfr1, indicating
that this transcript originates from a specific promoter (Figure 3a) and reducing the likelihood that it is cotranscribed
with guaB. Transcription of the adjacent trxA gene, encoding
the redox regulator thioredoxin, was found to initiate approximately 100 bp downstream of the 3' end of the yfr1 gene (Figure 3a); cotranscription of yfr1 with trxA is thus unlikely. In
SS120, the lack of the yfr1 TATA box, and the fact that the

Compared to other eubacterial ncRNAs [25,40], Yfr1 is one of
the shortest bacterial ncRNAs, with a length of only 54, 56 or
57 nt (in strains MED4, MIT 9313 and WH 8102, respectively;
Figure 3b). Although direct information on cyanobacterial
RNAs is scarce [41,42] and not a single study exists for marine
cyanobacteria, the half-lifes of eubacterial mRNAs are frequently in the range of a few minutes. In contrast, Yfr1 is
extremely stable as a half-life of more than 60 minutes was
measured after transcriptional arrest was induced by
rifampicin (see Additional data file 1). No peptide reading
frame within yfr1 is conserved between any of the three
strains, although, as expected for a stable RNA, the three
strains that express yfr1 share extensive structural conservation. They contain two terminal tetranucleotide loops sepa-

A long RNA in MED4 and SS120
The yfr6 gene was predicted in cluster 53 (Table 1). This cluster included nine different sequences (see Additional data file
1, Figure S10), among which only yfr6 in MED4 and SS120
may code for a functional RNA. The seven other sequences
each have only about 40 nucleotide positions from their
respective 5' untranslated region in common with Yfr6. That
was sufficient to cluster all nine sequences together, but these
other seven sequences included mRNAs for two previously

In top scoring cluster 194, a family of structurally highly similar RNAs (Yfr2, Yfr3 and Yfr4) was predicted (Table 1). Subsequent local alignments identified yet another similar
sequence in MED4, and at least one homologue each in
SS120, MIT 9313 and WH 8102.

refereed research

The expression of many bacterial regulatory RNAs is stimulated by varying environmental cues, and often so by the
stress response in which these RNAs then play a role. Therefore, a variety of stress conditions and their possible impact
on the accumulation of ncRNAs were tested. Figure 4 shows a
series of Northern hybridizations with RNA samples from
cells that had been depleted of nitrogen, phosphate or iron,
exposed to higher intensities of white or of blue light, or
treated with 2 µM 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1-N-N'-dimethylurea (DCMU) to induce oxidative stress or grown at elevated
or lowered temperatures (30°C and 15°C). Normalization of
loaded RNA used 5S rRNA as an internal standard to compensate for small RNA sample loading differences; however,
Yfr1 levels were unaffected by any of these conditions.

Northern hybridizations with oligonucleotide probes specific
for each of these candidate genes in MED4 yielded distinct
bands of 89 to 95 nt. RACE mapping of 5' ends further confirmed that all four loci are transcribed in this organism (Figure 5). The RNAs Yfr2 through Yfr5 in MED4 and their
homologues in the other genomes are each encoded by distant genomic loci and the position of their genes is not fixed
within the four investigated genomes with respect to adjacent
genes (Table 2). The sequence comparison shows that for
MED4, Yfr2 and Yfr5 on one hand and Yfr3 and Yfr4 on the
other are more similar to each other (Figure 5a). The
predicted secondary structures of the Yfr2-5 ncRNA family in
MED4 are highly conserved with a GGAAACA repeat within
the loop of the predicted 5' hairpin (Figure 5c). Among the
different tested environmental conditions, the amount of
Yfr2-5 was affected by temperature (up at 15°C and down at
30°C) as well as by nitrogen limitation and incubation in blue
light (Figure 4).

rated by a 16 to 19 nt unpaired region that contains a CA
dinucleotide repeat. Consistently, the 3' located stem-loop
element is formed by at least five GC pairs, and is followed by
a short stretch of U residues, indicative of a Rho-independent
transcription terminator (Figure 3c).

Test of transcript accumulation of Yfr1-7 from MED4 (MED) under different conditions. The left side shows the Northern hybridizations for which the
following conditions were used: nutrient depletion (phosphate (P-), nitrogen (N-), iron (Fe-)); blue light for three hours (3 h); controls under blue (Blue),
white (White) and no light (Dark); oxidative stress mediated by the application of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-N-N'-dimethylurea (DCMU); low (15°C) and
high (30°C) temperatures; and high light intensity (50 µE). For comparison, 5S rRNA was hybridized as an internal standard and the mRNA of gene
PMM3822n which, with a length of approximately 250 nucleotides, was taken as an example for a small mRNA. Additional controls by quantitative RT-PCR
for the genes isiB (Fe), glnA (N), pstS (P) and hli8 (high light) [data not shown] were carried out to confirm the effects of nutrient depletion or high light.
The amounts of these mRNAs were enhanced by a factor of 79.7 (isiB), 5.8 (glnA), 2.8 (hli8) and 4.0 (pstS) under the respective treatment compared to
standard conditions (data not shown). Yfr6 shows an inconstant signal; for example, at cold, blue/white light, N-, Yfr2 to Yfr5 were hybridized with the
consensus oligonucleotide y_gen (Figure 5). The band intensities were quantified and normalized to the amount of 5S rRNA as an internal standard (right).

unannotated open reading frames in MED4 and MIT 9313
(PMM3822n and PMT3904n [13]), the three annotated genes
Pro0415 (in SS120), SYNW1950 and SYNW2450 (in WH
8102) as well as two more possible open reading frames in
WH 8102, (27_W1i1019 and 6_W1i283), which possibly code
for peptides with similarity to the first five gene products (see
also Figure S10B in Additional data file 1). In contrast, Yfr6
from the two strains each have an extended sequence and
structural similarity to each other.
In MED4, yfr6 is located between the hypothetical PMM0660
gene and PMM0659, the latter encoding 322 amino terminal
residues of a DNA ligase. The region is framed by trnS and
nrdJ (encoding a B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase).
In SS120, the nrdJ-trnS region lacks the yfr6 gene, which
instead is located 448 nt downstream of another ncRNA gene,
yfr7. Despite the different genomic locations, Yfr6 sequences
from the two strains show a nucleotide identity of approximately 70% to each other (Figure 6a; Additional data file 1,
Figure S10). A Northern blot signal for Yfr6 is restricted to
MED4 and SS120 and no signal was found in WH 8102 and
MIT 9313 (Figure 6b). This 244 nt RNA had a half-life of
approximately 2 minutes in MED4. In MED4, blue light and
incubation in the cold elevated the expression of Yfr6 compared to white light or darkness. In addition, expression was
reduced upon nitrogen depletion and under high light conditions (Figure 4). The yfr6 locus could also code for a 33 amino
acid peptide as there is a possible reading frame that is conserved between MED4 and SS120 that begins at nucleotide 97
of the Yfr6 transcript in MED4. This situation, a relatively
long transcript with strong structural potential (Figure 6c)
and a very short centrally located reading frame, resembles
the RNAIII from Staphylococcus aureus, a riboregulator
from which the 26 amino acid δ-hemolysin peptide is also
translated [43]. In the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, recently as many as 13 sense strand RNA
sequences have been found that were encoded either within,
or overlapping, annotated open reading frames [44].

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/9/R73

are annotated on the forward strand. We did not detect their
expression, but found strong signals for Yfr7, which is transcribed from the complementary strand. The sequence of Yfr7
is highly conserved between the four strains (Figure 7a).
Rifampicin tests showed this RNA to be stable (half-life >1 h).
In MED4, expression of Yfr7 was not affected by conditions
employed in Figure 4.
Its high sequence conservation enabled us also to define oligonucleotides that hybridized to this RNA in four additional,
unsequenced strains of Prochlorococcus and in three
additional Synechococcus strains (Figure 7b). The signal pattern is very distinct as all three Prochlorococcus strains
adapted to high light (MED4, MIT 9312, MIT 9215) have two
signals in hybridization, one at approximately 200 nt and one
at approximately 300 nt, whereas RNA from the four lowlight-adapted Prochlorococcus (SS120, MIT 9313, NATL2A
and MIT 9211) and four Synechococcus (WH 8102, WH 7803,
WH 8020, RS9906) strains gave a single signal at
approximately 175 to 185 nt (Figure 7b). These strains
represent a large genetic diversity within the marine
cyanobacterial radiation [45], thus the presence of orthologues of yfr7 in additional and even more distant cyanobacteria appeared likely. Indeed, in the freshwater cyanobacteria
Synechococcus PCC 6301 and Synechocystis PCC 6803, a 6Sa
(or SsaA) RNA has also been described, which is located
directly downstream of purK [46]. There is some structural
similarity between Yfr7 and the 6Sa RNA, which leads us to
assume that these RNAs are homologues of each other. In
addition, a recent publication provided comparative structural information suggesting that the ncRNA Yfr7 we describe
here and SsaA or 6Sa RNA from the latter cyanobacteria have
structural elements in common with the 6S RNA of γ-proteobacteria, in particular a large internal loop (the central bubble
in Figure 7c), a typical closing stem and terminal loop [47].
This possibly indicates that the here described Yfr7s are the
orthologues of γ-proteobacterial 6S RNA and may have a similar role throughout the whole eubacterial radiation.

Yfr7 exists in 11 different marine cyanobacteria
The yfr7 gene is located downstream of purK (encoding phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase) in all four strains
analyzed here (Table 2). At first, our search strategy identified
this gene only in MED4 and SS120 (Table 1), due to the fact
that in MIT 9313 and WH 8102 this corresponding region is
located within annotated mRNA genes. These hypothetical
genes, PMT0670 in MIT 9313 and SYNW1307 in WH 8102,

Discussion

The genomes of Prochlorococcus marinus SS120, MIT 9313,
MED4 and Synechococcus WH 8102 provide a unique dataset
for cyanobacterial genome analysis. These genomes differ by
several hundred genes from each other, yet most of the operons and gene clusters present in more than a single genome
are co-linear [10-12]. Furthermore, the Synechococcus/

Prochlorococcus group is very well investigated with regard
to their global significance in the marine ecosystem, and there
is clear evidence for speciation processes in terms of specific
ecological niches, the position in phylogenetic trees, and the
presence of more or less derived features (for a review, see
[7]). Although there is no well established genetic system for
Prochlorococcus to test gene functions directly, these features
collectively make these cyanobacteria emerging model organisms for marine photoautotroph bacteria.
In certain other eubacteria such as E. coli and Vibrio cholerae, several ncRNAs were demonstrated to be essential
regulatory factors mediating rapid responses to environmental changes. The underlying regulatory mechanisms range
from antisense binding to mRNAs to direct sensing of metabolites, as it is the case with riboswitches. For free-living
marine phototrophs such as the cyanobacteria investigated
here, regulatory circuits involving ncRNAs can be expected
too. However, except for RNase P RNA, scRNA and tmRNA,
the three ncRNAs that are easiest to identify, little had been
known about ncRNAs genes in these marine cyanobacteria.
In a broader context, information has remained scarce on
riboregulators and RNA-coding genes even for the group of
cyanobacteria as a whole.

Using an elaborate biochemical protocol, a single ncRNA was
previously identified in the freshwater cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC 6301 and Synechocystis PCC 6803 [46]. In
addition, mapping of transcriptional units within the gas
vesicle operon of Calothrix identified a single antisense transcript [48]. Here, we report the presence of new non-coding
RNAs in the group of marine unicellular cyanobacteria with a
focus on Prochlorococcus marinus MED4. Several more
ncRNA candidate genes were predicted in the two relatively
larger genomes of WH 8102 and MIT 9313 but still await
experimental testing. An overview of the candidate regions
identified by our screen is presented in Table 1 and a summary of the experimentally confirmed new ncRNAs is presented in Table 2. In addition to the identification of ncRNAs,
the computational results indicated the presence of conserved secondary structure elements relating to the upstream
untranslated regions of several r-protein operons. Thus,
autogenous control mechanisms over the expression of these
operons, similar to those in enterobacteria [35,36] may exist
in these cyanobacteria.
The percentage of true RNA elements and ncRNAs found in
our screen is very high, whereas the number of predicted
ncRNA genes above the Z-score cut-off was low in MED4. It
is likely that additional candidate ncRNAs have escaped
detection. The performance of the computational algorithm is

information

The functions of these ncRNAs are currently unclear. The
mode of action of ncRNAs supposed to act through an antisense mechanism can be studied by transferring the ncRNA
as well as the putative target(s) to an appropriate host or
model organism. For unicellular marine cyanobacteria, Synechococcus WH 7803 might become such a model as its
genome analysis has almost completely been finished [49]

interactions

Our analysis did reveal an interesting set of structural elements. Especially for MED4 and SS120, which underwent a
strong genome reduction, the ncRNAs found may be of considerable importance. Both WH 8102 and MIT 9313 contain a
hfq gene, whose product has been shown to be intimately

linked to the activity of small regulatory RNAs in enterobacteria [29]. Intriguingly, there is no hfq gene in SS120 or
MED4, although the genomic region flanking hfq is otherwise
conserved among the four species (Figure 8). It is likely that,
together with hfq, several ncRNA genes have been deleted
during the evolution of the Prochlorococcus group towards
the minimal genome. Thus, those ncRNAs still remaining in
an organism such as MED4 must have been subject to strong
positive selection and may act independently of Hfq. (It is
worthwhile noting that in E. coli, only 30% of investigated
ncRNAs have been shown to be bound by Hfq [28].)

sensitive to the number of sequences. One important
limitation in this context relates to the focus on RNA structures that are additionally conserved by primary sequence.
Furthermore, because of the restriction to intergenic regions,
ncRNAs that reside within annotated regions will be missed.
This affects the whole class of antisense RNAs that are
encoded complementary to their target. Also, misannotations
may reduce the number of sequences in a cluster, like in the
case of yfr7, which is in a region in which a reading frame was
annotated on the complementary strand in two of the
genomes investigated here. Indeed, in a test using an alignment of Yfr7 from all four species, an improved Z-score of -7.8
was detected.

and because there is a genetic system. Those ncRNAs with
orthologues over a wider phylogenetic distance could be functionally analyzed also directly in cyanobacteria for which
well-established genetic tools exist, such as Synechococcus
PCC 7942 or Synechocystis PCC 6803. A very good candidate
is Yfr7, which is likely to be present in all cyanobacteria and
could be the orthologue of γ-proteobacterial 6S RNA [47]. 6S
RNA is required for the repression of σ70-dependent promoters under nutrient limitation and concomitant activation of
certain σS-dependent promoters [50]. Cyanobacteria do not
harbor an obvious orthologue of the enterobacterial stationary phase sigma factor σS. Therefore, it remains to be shown
if Yfr7/SsaA/6Sa RNA is also functionally related to γ-proteobacterial 6S RNA. But the widespread occurrence of this
ncRNA opens exciting opportunities to test the function of
Yfr7 directly in cyanobacteria.

Evidence of function may further come from the comparison
of expression patterns, structures as well as genomic location,
and from the presence or absence of a given ncRNA gene in
the different strains. For instance, yfr1 might be dispensable
for growth at greater depths; this gene is clearly absent from
the ultra low-light-adapted SS120 but is present in the other
three cyanobacteria, whereas Yfr2 through Yfr5 are in length
and the degree of mutual identity similar to four ncRNAs
implicated in quorum sensing in Vibrio species [20]. Consequently, the ncRNAs identified here may constitute important regulatory or structural components of a free-living
marine cyanobacterium.

Conclusion

The first genome-wide and systematical screen for ncRNAs in
cyanobacteria is provided. Genes encoding functional RNAs
are notoriously difficult to predict during standard

points: first, the employed method is very efficient in finding
microbial ncRNAs and other RNA elements. Although we
already used a soft cut-off value, however, an even lower limit
might be used for microbial genomes such as those analyzed
here. Second, the 17 ncRNAs detected here in MED4, SS120,
MIT 9313 and WH8102 are only a part of the total ncRNA
population present in these species. Thus, our data indicate
that it is very likely that ncRNAs play an important regulatory
and structural role in cyanobacteria. Consequently, they
deserve more attention in view of the important function
these microbes play in the global ecosystem.

annotation of microbial genomes. Here, we took a comparative computational approach that was based on sequence and
structure conservation as was recently introduced for the
identification of eukaryotic ncRNAs [33]. In view of the rapidly growing number of microbial genome sequences, such
screens that are based on comparative analysis will become
increasingly possible. We have analyzed the highest scoring
candidates of the prediction further and detected several previously unknown ncRNAs as well as other elements that function at the RNA level. The list of high scoring candidates
contained a very low rate of true negatives. This indicates two

Materials and methods
Cultivation of cyanobacteria
Cultures of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were grown
in artificial sea water medium (Prochlorococcus MED4,
NATL2A-MIT and Synechococcus WH 7803, RS9906, WH
8102) [51], or based on Atlantic seawater in PRO99 media
(SS120, MIT 9313, MIT 9312, MIT 9211, MIT 9215) [52]
under 18 (MED4, MIT 9312, MIT 9215, WH 7803, RS9906
and WH 8102) or 10 (all other strains) µmol quanta m-2s-1
white light at 23°C in a 12 h day-12 h night cycle.
Prochlorococcus MED4 was subjected to various environmental perturbations by depletion of nitrate, phosphate, iron
in artificial seawater; a shift from approximately 10 µmol
quanta m-2s-1 white light into darkness or into 10 µmol quanta
m-2s-1 blue light or into 50 µmol quanta m-2s-1 daylight as high
light condition, or the addition of DCMU to a final concentration of 2 µM for the inhibition of photosynthetic electron
transport and the induction of severe oxidative stress; as well
as temperature shifts to 15°C or 30°C. MED4 cultures were
concentrated ten-fold by centrifugation for 10 minutes at
9,000 rpm at 15°C to 20°C and cell pellets were washed once
with the corresponding depleted media if necessary. The concentrated cultures were incubated for 3 h at the respective
condition.

RNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated as previously described [53] but with
modified lysis conditions for MIT 9313 and WH 8102 as these
strains gave poor RNA yields using the standard procedure.
The resuspended cells from these strains were homogenized
in Z6 buffer [54] by several freeze-thaw cycles using liquid
nitrogen over a time of 30 minutes, followed by the addition
of one volume of acidic phenol and incubation at 60°C for
another 30 minutes. Total RNA was separated in 10% polyacrylamide-urea gels. Polyacrylamide gels were stained with
ethidium bromide (0.3 µg/l) in 1 × TBE buffer [55], rinsed
with water and analyzed with a Lumi-Imager F1 system
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Transcript sizes were determined by correlation to MspI-digested DNA of plasmid
puc19. Mapping of RNA 5' ends was performed by rapid
amplification of cDNA ends as described [24]. We verified in
three different ways that the same amounts of RNA samples
were loaded in Northern blots: first, by measurement of RNA
concentrations; second, by direct comparison of rRNA band
intensities after staining by ethidium bromide; and third, by
control hybridizations using the 5S rRNA as an internal
standard.
To determine RNA stability, cells were treated with
rifampicin (200 µg/ml; SIGMA, Munich, Germany) and filtered rapidly (within 60 s) through Supor 0.45 µm membrane
filters (PALL, Dreieich, Germany) at different time points
after treatment, transferred in resuspension buffer (10 mM
NaOAc, pH 4.5, 200 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA) and frozen in
liquid nitrogen. RNA was isolated by dissolving the filter in

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/9/R73

acidic phenol at 60°C followed by standard phenol-chloroform extraction as described above. Gel-separated RNAs were
electroblotted to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham,
Freiburg, Germany). Following prehybridization for at least
10 minutes in 50% deionized formamide, 7% SDS, 250 mM
NaCl and 120 mM Na(PO4) pH 7.2 at 45°C, oligonucleotide
probes labelled by polynucleotide kinase with 30 µCi γ32PATP were added and hybridized at 52°C for at least 4 h (except
for the probes designed for Yfr2 through Yfr5, which were
hybridized at 45°C and washed at 40°C). All DNA oligonucleotides are listed in the Additional data Table S3. The membranes were washed in 2 × SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium
citrate, pH 7.0) [55], 1% SDS at 45°C for 10 minutes; 1 × SSC,
0.5% SDS at 45°C for 5 min; and briefly in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1%
SDS at ambient temperature. Signals were detected and analyzed on a Personal Molecular Imager FX system with Quantity One software (BIO-RAD, Munich, Germany).

Computational methods
To identify candidates for our experimental investigations,
we took a comparative computational approach that was
based on sequence and structure conservation and used the
program ALIFOLDZ [33]. The genome sequences of Prochlorococcus SS120, MED4, MIT 9313 and Synechococcus WH
8102 were used in the versions given in Additional data file 2
(Table S4). A summary of the computational screening is
given in Figure 2 and a complete list of parameters is available
in Additional data file 2 (Table S5).
We assumed that homologous RNA structures would show a
reasonable degree of conservation on the sequence level for
the given set of genomes. BLASTN (Version 2.2.8 [56]) was
used to screen for local sequence conservations within intergenic spacer regions (IGRs) longer than 49 bp. These were
defined as those regions not overlapping any annotated CDS,
rRNA, tRNA or misc_RNA feature (primary tags according to
EMBL feature table definition [57]) on either strand. An overview of some characteristics of the intergenic sequences is
given in Additional data file 2 (Table S4). Because sequence
conservation concerns both DNA strands and because the
local alignment was done asymmetrically (e.g. MED4 IGRs
were aligned versus MIT 9313 IGRs, but not vice versa; Figure
2B), all hit sequences were reverse complemented.
ALIFOLDZ shows increased sensitivity with the number of
aligned sequences [33]. Thus, to take advantage of a multigenome comparison, we transformed the pairwise sequence
alignments into multi-sequence clusters via single-linkage
clustering. Before proceeding to single-linkage clustering,
redundancy was reduced by unifying those hits from each
genome that showed a maximum reciprocal overlap of 85% or
greater. The reduced sequence set was used as both query and
subject set in another local alignment step (BLASTN considering only the query strand as possible subject strand).
Sequences that produced a significant blast hit (E-value ≤ 1010) for a given query were collected into initial clusters. These

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R73

Genome Biology 2005,

were unified if they contained at least one common sequence.
The procedure produced a total of 310 clusters plus 310 clusters with the reverse complement of these sequences. Candidate sequences that overlap less than the previous coverage
cut-off of 85% but are long enough to produce significant
BLASTN hits can result in duplicate sequences within clusters. These may negatively affect the alignment and scoring.
Therefore, these sequences were merged within each individual cluster using a less restrictive reciprocal coverage cut-off
(≥10%).

Despite any structural conservation, any RNA in principle
may encode for a peptide. The necessary reading frame as
defined in this analysis consisted of at least ten consecutive
codons starting with either of the possible start codons ATG,
GTG, TTG or ATT and finishing with TAA, TAG or TGA. If a
reading frame was present, the possible conservation of the
encoded peptide sequence amongst other cyanobacteria was
evaluated by alignments. Only in the case of a conserved open
reading frame did we consider the RNA to be coding.

reviews

Finally, each cluster was aligned using CLUSTALW (Version
1.81, default parameters) [58] and the resulting alignments
were scored by ALIFOLDZ. Also, single sequence clusters
were scored by ALIFOLDZ (by normalized minimum fold
energy). As the scoring method is, besides any biological limitations, sensitive to the number of sequences in the alignment, we considered the Z-score cut-off of -4 used by
Washietl and Hofacker [33] as a soft cut-off for both alignments and single sequences. For all structure computations,
folding temperatures were set to 24°C, which is the approximate habitat temperature of the marine cyanobacteria studied here [7].
