Abstract
Background: Bifidobacteria are found at varying prevalence in human microbiota and seem to play
an important role in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Bifidobacteria are highly adapted to the
human GIT which is reflected in the genome sequence of a Bifidobacterim longum isolate. The
competitiveness against other bacteria is not fully understood yet but may be related to the
production of antimicrobial compounds such as bacteriocins. In a previous study, 34 Bifidobacterium
isolates have been isolated from baby faeces among which six showed proteinaceous antilisterial
activity against Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, one of these isolates, RBL67, was further
identified and characterized.
Results: Bifidobacterium isolate RBL67 was classified and characterized using a polyphasic approach.
RBL67 was classified as Bifidobacterium thermophilum based on phenotypic and DNA-DNA
hybridization characteristics, although 16S rDNA analyses and partial groEL sequences showed
higher homology with B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum and B. thermacidophilum subsp.
thermacidophilum, respectively. RBL67 was moderately oxygen-tolerant and was able to grow at pH
4 and at a temperature of 47°C.
Conclusion: In order to assign RBL67 to a species, a polyphasic approach was used. This resulted
in the classification of RBL67 as a Bifidobacterium thermophilum strain. To our knowledge, this is the
first report about B. thermophilum isolated from baby faeces since the B. thermophilum strains were
related to ruminants and swine faeces before. B. thermophilum was previously only isolated from
animal sources and was therefore suggested to be used as differential species between animal and
human contamination. Our findings may disapprove this suggestion and further studies are now
conducted to determine whether B. thermophilum is distributed broader in human faeces.
Furthermore, the postulated differentiation between human and animal strains by growth above
45°C is no longer valid since B. thermophilum is able to grow at 47°C. In our study, 16S rDNA and
partial groEL sequence analysis were not able to clearly assign RBL67 to a species and were
contradictory. Our study suggests that partial groEL sequences may not be reliable as a single tool
for species differentiation.

Background
Since Tissier discovered the Bifidobacterium spp. in 1899
[1], over 30 species have been isolated and identified [2]
and the first genome sequence of a Bifidobacterium is now
available [3]. Analyses of amplified partial 16S rDNA
sequences assigned to uncultivated bifidobacteria suggest
the existence of more new Bifidobacterium species[4,5].
Bifidobacteria are known to be heterofermentative anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria which belong to the class of
Actinobacteria [6] containing genomes with a high G+C
content. They mainly colonize the intestines of humans,
other mammals and insects [7]. Some bifidobacteria have
also been isolated from environmental sources such as
sewage [8]. Bifidobacteria have been described as strictly
anaerobic bacteria in the sense that they are not able to
grow on agar-plates in the presence of air [7]. However,
some Bifidobacterium strains were described which were at
least partially aerotolerant in the presence of reducing
agents in liquid media [9,10]. Genome analyses of Bifidobacterium longum suggests that both growth and survival
under oxygen pressure are linked with the presence of a set
of oxygen-scavenging NADH oxidases [3]. Strains of a
novel species, Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, were
recently reported to be able to grow under air on the surface of solid agar-medium [11]. Based on heat-shock protein HSP60 encoding sequence homologies, this species
clusters distinctly from aerotolerant species of the genera
Scardovia, Aeriscardovia, Parascardovia and Gardnerella
which were related or belonged to the genus Bifidobacterium before the recent reclassification [11,12]. For probiotic use of a particular Bifidobacterium strain, oxygen
tolerance is an important characteristic for maintaining
cell viability in end products.
The classification of Bifidobacterium species has most often
been done in the past mainly by 16S rDNA sequence
homology analysis [13] and confirmed by an enzymatic
assay of D-fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase [14]
whose encoding gene xfp is widespread among microorganisms and not unique to Bifidobacterium species [15].
These results were then substantiated by determinations
of DNA-DNA relatedness [16] as well as physiological
properties such as carbohydrate fermentation profiles in
order to discriminate between single species of the genus
Bifidobacterium. Recently, phylogenetic trees for bifidobacteria were constructed based on groEL genes encoding
heat-shock protein HSP60 [17,18], groES genes encoding
chaperon [18] and xfp encoding phosphoketolase [19,20]
as alternatives to 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic trees.
These trends support the polyphasic approach for species
identification as suggested several years ago [21]. The phylogenetic positions of bifidobacteria groEL (synonymly
used with HSP60 encoding sequences) seem to generally
agree with 16S rDNA-based phylogeny, and in several
studies, have been more discriminative than 16S rDNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/79

sequences for species delineation [18]. In a previous
study, 34 isolates of Bifidobacterium species from infant
faeces have been described, six of which showed bacteriocin-like activity against Listeria monocytogenes which represents a rare property among bifidobacteria [22]. In this
work, the taxonomic position of one of these isolates,
strain RBL67, whose properties did not match with any of
the so far described Bifidobacterium species, was determined using 16S rDNA sequence homology, comparative
groEL gene sequence analysis, DNA-DNA genome hybridizations and carbohydrate fermentation patterns. This
study aimed to classify RBL67 due to its features which
may be used industrially in the future and was not
intended to for a complete phylogenetic analysis of Bifidobacterium sp.

Results and discussion
Phylogenetic position of Bifidobacterium sp. RBL67
Because 16S rDNA sequences are the most widely used
molecules in phylogenetic classification of bacteria, the
16S rDNA fragment of strain RBL67 was amplified by PCR
using the lm3/lm26 primer pair (Table 1). The sequence
of the resulting fragment (approx. 1.5 kb [Genbank:DQ340557]) showed the highest homologies to 16S
rDNA sequences of other bifidobacteria from the GenBank (Table 2) with the highest similarity, 99%, to the
sequence of Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T [GenBank: AY148470], isolated by Zhu
et al. [17], and 94% to that of the Bifidobacterium thermophilum type strain [GenBank: U10151] (Table 2). A
phylogenetic tree was constructed from the 16S rDNA
sequences using a consensus length of 1392 kb. The tree
shows clustering of RBL67 with the Bifidobacterium thermophilum/thermacidophilum/boum branch (Fig. 1), described
as the "thermophilic group" by Zhu et al. [17].

There is insufficient discriminating power to clearly assign
a 16S rDNA to a species within the genus Bifidobacterium
since similarity values for this gene can range from 93% to
99% between species, as reported in other studies [23-25].
Therefore a polyphasic approach, as suggested by VanTable 1: Oligonucleotides used in this study

philum/boum branch, which substantiates the 16S rDNA
comparisons presented in Fig. 1. According to the 16S
rDNA tree, strain RBL67 splits off earlier on the branch
and is closer related to B. thermophilum (Fig. 1 [GenBank:U10151 ]) whereas using partial groEL sequences,
strain RBL67 is on the same branch as B. thermacidophilum
(Fig. 2 [GenBank: AY004276]). The comparison of 16S
rDNA sequences and partial groEL sequences showed a
discrepancy between the classification of strain RBL67
based on those methods. By comparing the partial groEL
gene sequences, Bifidobacterium RBL67 is more closely
related to B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum
LMG21395T (98.25% similarity) than to B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T (97.06%, Table 3)
whereas based on 16S rDNA sequences strain RBL67 is
closer related to B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum
LMG21689T (99%, Table 2) than to B. thermacidophilum
subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T (96%). According to
the definition of Zhu et al. [17] a similarity of 96.5–100%
and 95.5–97% is required for intraspecies and inter-subspecies differentiation by partial groEL sequences, respectively. By applying this definition to partial groEL gene
sequencing data (Table 3), Bifidobacterium RBL67 could
belong to the species thermacidophilum or it could be a
subspecies of B. thermophilum DSM20210T (95.65% similarity), which is contradictory. Clearly sequencing analysis
of partial groEL could not provide enough evidence to
confirm the phylogenetic classification of Bifidobacterium
isolate RBL67.
DNA-DNA hybridization and G+C-content
For the final classification of Bifidobacterium RBL67, DNADNA hybridization was performed. The results (Table 4)
confirmed that the partial groEL gene sequence was not
sufficient to differentiate between species. According to
the limit of 70% similarity required for species identification [26], only Bifidobacterium boum DSM20432T could be
defined as a different species by DNA-DNA hybridization.
B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T
was on the limit of this definition; its classification as a
new species was justified by data from both DNA-DNA
hybridization and phylogenetic data reported by Dong et
al. [8]. However, our DNA-DNA hybridizations provide
evidence that B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum
LMG21689T belongs to B. thermophilum, showing 82.25%
homology to B. thermophilum DSM20210T (Table 4). Bifi-

dobacterium RBL67 showed 86.25% homology with B.
thermophilum DSM20210T and could also not be discriminated as a new species. Bifidobacterium RBL67 showed
even less similarity to B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T and B. thermacidophilum subsp.
porcinum LMG21689T than to B. thermophilum
DSM20210T (Table 4). Furthermore the homologies
between Bifidobacterium RBL67 and both B. thermacidophilum strains were similar (77.9% for LMG21395T and
77.2% for LMG21689T) while the homology between B.
thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T
and B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T was
only 71.9%. The result reported by Dong et al. [8] from
DNA-DNA hybridization, 58.9% similarity between B.
thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T
and B. thermophilum DSM20210T, was not confirmed in
this study. This might be due to different methods of DNA
isolation, DNA-DNA hybridization or interpretation of
the data.
Based on the data by DNA-DNA hybridization, which is
still the strongest method for bacterial species differentiation, we classified strain RBL67 as Bifidobacterium thermophilum.
The G+C content of DNA from Bifidobacterium RBL67 was
59.7 mol-% as determined by DSMZ Germany. This compared well with the G+C determination of B. thermophilum
DSM20210T, 60 mol-%, but differed from that of B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T and B.
thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T, which
were 57.7 and 61.5 mol-% G+C, respectively.
Physiological properties of Bifidobacterium sp. RBL67
Cells of Bifidobacterium RBL67 grew well on MRS-C agar
incubated anaerobically at 37°C overnight and on RBagar at 40°C in 48 h. They were non-motile, irregularly
shaped rods and formed pairs when growing on plates
(Fig. 3a). On RB-agar, they formed yellow colonies with a
diameter of 1 mm. When growing in liquid culture,
agglomeration of cells occurred (Fig. 3b). This agglomeration was pH dependent: the lower the pH, the greater the
agglomeration of cells. The formation of agglomerates
was inhibited by pH control at pH 7 (data not shown). In
contrast to B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum
LMG21395T, aggregated cell clumps of Bifidobacterium

RBL67 were not easily dispersed again, even after
extended mixing.
Bifidobacterium RBL67 was moderately oxygen tolerant;
therefore it was not necessary to perform dilutions and
inoculations anaerobically. However, the strain did not
grow on agar plates under aerobic conditions after 7 days.
No selected gas atmosphere was necessary to grow the
strain in liquid culture. While sparkling the liquid media
with oxygen-free nitrogen or carbon dioxide, Bifidobacterium RBL67 ceased to grow. To determine the level of oxygen tolerance, anaerobic media were purged with oxygen
as described by Meile et al. [10]. Fig. 4 shows the growth
curves for Bifidobacterium sp. RBL67 at different levels of
oxygen in reduced medium. At 2.5% oxygen in the bottle
growth of this strain was maintained, showing its elevated
tolerance to oxygen. Even at 12.5% oxygen, the OD still
increased fivefold during incubation for 12 h. B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T and B.
thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T showed
similar growth curves to strain RBL67 under oxidative

stress, but seemed to grow slightly better at 12.5% oxygen
after 10 h of fermentation (data not shown). Nonetheless,
all the strains tested were less oxygen tolerant than B. animalis subsp. lactis, which was shown to tolerate 50 ml of
oxygen in comparable reduced medium [10].
Table 5 shows a summary of the fermentation profiles and
growth extremes of Bifidobacterium RBL67, RBL68, RBL70,
B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T,
B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T, B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140T and B. thermophilum
DSM20210T. For the determination of the growth limits
for pH and temperature a limit of OD600 ≥ 0.4 after 7 days
incubation was set. Bifidobacterium RBL67 was found to
grow in a very large pH and temperature range (Table 5).
Its maximum growth temperature (47°C) was very close
to that of B. thermophilum DSM20210T, although the later
grew to a higher OD (data not shown). B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T was the only
strain in this study that grew at 49°C which confirmed the
growth characteristics described by Dong et al. [8].

Figure 4 Bifidobacterium RBL67 under different oxygen concentrations in MRS-C at 37°C
Growth of
Growth of Bifidobacterium RBL67 under different oxygen concentrations in MRS-C at 37°C. Points are mean of three replicates. ● Growth under anaerobic conditions; ■ Growth with 2.5% oxygen; ▲ Growth with 12.5% oxygen.

As for a lower pH limit, RBL67 and RBL70 were the only
strains still growing at pH 4 under the growth conditions
of the study. B. thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum
LMG21395T did not grow at this pH, which was reported
by Dong et al. [8]. The upper pH limit for growth was not
determined, but all tested cultures still grew very well at
pH 8. The molar ratio of acetate to lactate from glucose for
Bifidobacterium RBL67 was determined as 5.91 to 1 in
MRS-C medium at 37°C under anaerobic conditions.

Conclusion
In order to classify the Bifidobacterium isolate RBL67 at
species level, we used a polyphasic approach since phylogenetic trees based on partial groEL gene (as used by Ventura et al. [18] and Dong et al. [8]) and 16S rDNA
sequences generated similar but not identical results for

species classification. Berthoud et al. [20] reported similar
difficulties when studying the "thermophilic group",
which could not be differentiated at the species level by
xfp gene sequencing. They proposed the use of 16S rDNA
sequencing, as an additional method for species differentiation. However, our DNA-DNA hybridization data
(Table 4) revealed a very close relationship between B.
thermophilum species and B. thermacidophilum species and
questioned the current classification of B. thermacidophilum as a discrete species. Our hybridization data were
substantiated by phylogenetic data, molecular characterization and physiological properties and allowed the classification of strain RBL67 into the species Bifidobacterium
thermophilum. In contrast with a previous report [8],
among our tested strains (Table 4) only B. boum could be
clearly classified as a species different from B. ther-

mophilum based on DNA-DNA hybridization. This finding
suggests that partial groEL gene sequences may not be reliable as a single tool for Bifidobacterium species differentiation. However, more studies have to be done to confirm
this suggestion.
As stated before, we did not intend to perform a complete
phylogenetic analysis. However, as more data (16S rDNA
sequences, groEL sequences) become available on strains
closely related to B. thermophilum RBL67, a complete phylogenetic analysis could be performed which may lead to
a new definition of the boum/thermophilum/thermacidophilum branch.
A very important finding of this study is that B. thermophilum could be isolated from human origin (baby faeces). In previous studies, B. thermophilum has been
classified as an animal-related species mainly present in
ruminant faeces [27,28]. Since it was previously possible
to differentiate between animal and human bifidobacteria
by species identification, it has been suggested that bifidobacteria should be used to discriminate between animal
and human bacterial contamination in foods [27,29].
Because B. thermophilum RBL67 was isolated from baby
faeces, it is likely that this species can not be used as animal contamination indicator. On the other hand, Gavini
et al. [30] detected B. adolescentis, a species predominantly
found in human, in cow dung, swine and rabbit faeces

which restricts the number of bifidobacterial species that
can be used for human faecal contamination detection.
Another discrimination tool between human and animal
bifidobacteria strains was the temperature growth limit of
45°C for strains from human origin [7,31]. B. thermophilum strains are able to grow at 47°C and since they
can also be found in human faeces [this study], the use of
the temperature is not reliable anymore for the discrimination of the origin of bifidobacteria. However, since only
a few species are able to grow above 45°C, the assignment
to a Bifidobacterium sp. can be narrowed. Further studies
are now undergoing to determine whether B. thermophilum is more widespread within humans.

Methods
Bacterial strains and routine growth conditions
A list of strains used in this study is presented in Table 6.
Strains were kept in their respective growth media (see
below) supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol at -80°C.
Prior to use, all bifidobacteria were grown on RaffinoseBifidobacterium (RB)-agar plates [32], without sodium
caseinate, supplemented with 1.5% (v/v) agar (Oxoid).
After 5 sub cultivations they were transferred to MRS-C
broth consisting of MRS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80
(Biolife) and 0.05% (w/v) L-cysteine-hydrochloride
(Sigma) or on MRS-C agar (MRS-C broth with 1.5% (w/v)
agar). Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM20456T was cultivated

only on MRS-C agar as it didn't grow on RB-agar. All
strains were incubated anaerobically at 37°C overnight in
MRS-C broth and agar, or at 40°C for 48 h on RB-agar.
Growth under oxidative-, heat- and pH-stress conditions
Growth under conditions of oxidative stress was measured after a modified method described by Meile et al.
[10]. Volumes of 0, 10 and 50 ml of pure oxygen were
added to sterile serum flasks containing 400 ml of MRS-C.
The flasks were inoculated with 1% of an overnight culture of either B. longum subtype longum DSM 20219T, Bifidobacterium RBL67, B. thermacidophilum subsp.
thermacidophilum LMG 21395T or B. thermacidophilum
subsp. porcinum LMG 21689T. The flasks were then incubated in a shaker at 160 rpm and 37°C for 12 h. Samples
were taken every 2 h and treated for 3 min in a stomacher
to remove clumps prior to measurements of the optical
density at 600 nm. Each growth curve was carried out
twice.

8.0 as initial pH for growth. Samples were incubated at
37°C for 7 days. Aliquots were taken daily, treated in a
stomacher for 3 min and the OD was measured at 600
nm. Each growth condition was measured twice. If a strain
failed to reach OD600 of 0.4 after 7 days, it was declared as
not growing under the tested conditions.

The temperature and pH extremes of Bifidobacterium
RBL67, RBL68 and RBL70, B. thermacidophilum subsp.
thermacidophilum LMG 21395T, B. thermacidophilum subsp.
porcinum LMG 21689T, B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM
10140T and B. thermophilum DSM 20210T were determined as follows:

Amplification and sequencing of 16S rDNA
Specific amplification of the 16S rDNA of Bifidobacterium
RBL67 and other bifidobacteria was done using a slightly
modified PCR protocol established by Schürch [33] using
the primer pair lm3/lm26 (Table 1). The annealing temperature used was 62°C instead of 60°C. After agarose gel
electrophoresis the corresponding band for 16S rDNA at
the 1.5 kb position was cut out and purified using the GFX
PCR purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Sequencing
of the PCR product was done by Microsynth GmbH using
the primers 520F, 520R, 1100F and 1100R (Table 1).
Sequence analysis and comparison was done using the
GCG software package version 10 as described before
[34]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses
were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 [35]. The
sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.6) and
the tree was calculated using the neighbour-joining
method with Jukes-Cantor parameter and a bootstrap
value of 1000.

25 ml of MRS-C containing 2 mg l-1 resazurin as redox
indicator were anaerobically inoculated with 1% of the
tested bifidobacteria cultured overnight. The temperature
range was evaluated by incubating the strains for 7 days at
12, 25, 46, 47, 48 and 49°C with an initial pH of 7.0. The
pH range was determined using pH 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5 and

Cloning and analysis of groEL sequences
DNA cloning and sequencing of a partial heat shock groEL
gene sequence from Bifidobacterium RBL67 were done
using a modified method of Jian et al. [34]. The DNA template was extracted using the method of Leenhouts et al.
[36]. To amplify part of a gene fragment with PCR, the fol-

lowing reaction mixture (25 μl) was used: 3–30 ng DNA
template measured at 260 nm with a Eppendorf-Biophotometer, 2.5 U Taq polymerase (Euroclone), 0.1 mM
dNTP's (Amersham Biosciences), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 μM
each of primer H60R and H60F (Table 1) and 2.5 μl 10 ×
PCR buffer (Euroclone). The PCR reactions were carried
out in a Biometra Tgradient Thermal Cycler using the following protocol: denaturation step 95°C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s and
72°C for 1 min at a heating rate of 1.5°C min-1. At the
end, the temperature was maintained at 72°C for 10 min.
A 25-μl aliquot of the reaction mixtures was mixed with
10 μl Orange G loading dye (0.25% Orange G from Fluka
in 30% glycerol) and subjected to electrophoresis on agarose (0.8%) gels in 1 × TAE buffer. DNA bands were visualized by 2.5 μg ml-1 ethidium bromide under UV light.
Corresponding bands (0.59 kb in size) were then cut out
and purified as described above.
Purified PCR fragments were ligated into the pGEM-T easy
vector using the Promega PCR cloning kit. Ligation and
cloning was performed according to the kit manual.
Transformation of E. coli XL-1 blue cells was done using
the electroporation method described by Sambrook and
Russel [37]. Recombinant plasmids were extracted from
transformed cells with the Promega Wizard Plus Midiprep
DNA Purification System. Plasmid DNA (100 ng μl-1) carrying partial HSP60 encoding gene sequences from Bifidobacterium RBL67 or B. thermacidophilum subsp.
thermacidophilum LMG 21395T was then sequenced by
Microsynth GmbH and finally aligned to the corresponding sequences from bifidobacteria and Bacillus subtilis
W168 (obtained from Genbank entries) using the CLUSTAL W software (version 1.6). Similarities were calculated
and converted into a distance matrix with the Jukes-Cantor parameter and rooted with Bacillus subtilis W168
applying a bootstrap value of 1000 using the software
MEGA version 3.1 [35].
DNA-DNA hybridization
Whole genome DNA-DNA hybridizations were carried
out externally at DSMZ Germany. Hybridizations were
performed with the genomes of Bifidobacterium RBL67, B.
thermacidophilum subsp. thermacidophilum LMG21395T, B.
thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG21689T, B. thermophilum DSM 20210T and B. boum 20432T. Total DNA
was isolated using a French pressure cell according to the
method described by Cashion et al. [38], DNA-DNA
hybridizations were carried out according to De Ley et al.
[39] with modifications of Huss et al. [40] in 2 × SSC and
10% formamide (v/v) at a temperature of 67°C. The analyses were performed with a model Cary 100 Bio UV/VISspectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostated
6 × 6 multicell changer and a temperature controller with
in situ temperature probe.

Carbohydrate fermentation and acid analysis
Carbohydrate fermentation of strain RBL67 was analyzed
using API 50 CHL strips (Biomérieux). The tests were carried out in triplicates according to the manufacturer's
instructions with a modification in culture preparation.
Briefly, 2 ml of an overnight culture in MRS-C broth were
centrifuged (14000 g, 5 min, 4°C). The pellet was then
washed and resuspended in 1 ml of autoclaved water. This
suspension was then mixed with 5 ml CHL50 medium
(Biomérieux) and 0.1 ml of this mixture was applied to
each tube of the API test. The test strips were then incubated anaerobically for 72 h at 37°C and evaluated after
24, 48 and 72 h.

Molar ratio of acetic and lactic acid was determined using
HPLC. 2 ml of an overnight culture (16 h) of either Bifidobacterium RBL67, RBL68 or RBL70, B. thermacidophilum
subsp. thermacidophilum LMG 21395T or B. thermacidophilum subsp. porcinum LMG 21689T were centrifuged
(14000 g, 5 min, 4°C). The supernatant was 10 × diluted
in HPLC-grade water and filtered (0.45 μm) prior to
HPLC analysis. This was carried out using an Aminex
HPX-87H (300 × 7.8 mm) column (Bio-Rad) in a Merck
LaChrom HPLC system. Sulfuric acid (10 mM, Fluka) was
used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml min-1. Sugars
and acids were detected by a RI detector. Analyses were
done in duplicate.
