Abstract
Background: Pmp22, a member of the junction protein family Claudin/EMP/PMP22, plays an important
role in myelin formation. Increase of pmp22 transcription causes peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-MarieTooth disease type1A (CMT1A). The pathophysiological phenotype of CMT1A is aberrant axonal
myelination which induces a reduction in nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Several CMT1A model
rodents have been established by overexpressing pmp22. Thus, it is thought that pmp22 expression must
be tightly regulated for correct myelin formation in mammals. Interestingly, the myelin sheath is also
present in other jawed vertebrates. The purpose of this study is to analyze the evolutionary conservation
of the association between pmp22 transcription level and vertebrate myelin formation, and to find the
conserved non-coding sequences for pmp22 regulation by comparative genomics analyses between jawed
fishes and mammals.
Results: A transgenic pmp22 over-expression medaka fish line was established. The transgenic fish had
approximately one fifth the peripheral NCV values of controls, and aberrant myelination of transgenic fish
in the peripheral nerve system (PNS) was observed. We successfully confirmed that medaka fish pmp22
has the same exon-intron structure as mammals, and identified some known conserved regulatory motifs.
Furthermore, we found novel conserved sequences in the first intron and 3'UTR.
Conclusion: Medaka fish undergo abnormalities in the PNS when pmp22 transcription increases. This
result indicates that an adequate pmp22 transcription level is necessary for correct myelination of jawed
vertebrates. Comparison of pmp22 orthologs between distantly related species identifies evolutionary
conserved sequences that contribute to precise regulation of pmp22 expression.

Background
Peripheral myelination is important for rapid body movement and sensing several environmental stimuli [1]. The
pmp22 gene encodes a hydrophobic tetraspan membrane
protein which is a member of the junction protein family
Claudin/EMP/PMP22 [2]. In the peripheral nerve system
(PNS), PMP22 contributes to the formation and maintenance of the myelin sheath [3,4]. It is known that in mammals an increase of the pmp22 transcription level induces
a reduction in nerve conduction velocity (NCV), coupled
with abnormal axonal myelination. In Charcot-MarieTooth disease type1A (CMT1A) patients, the majority
have a heterozygous tandem duplication of chromosome
17p11.2-p12, a 1.5 Mbp region that includes pmp22, and
the patients undergo slow NCV and distal muscle weakness [3,5]. Thus, pmp22 transcription is likely to be tightly
regulated to prevent over-expression. Understanding the
regulatory mechanisms of this gene might improve treatment of CMT1A patients.
Promoter regions and some regulatory motifs of mammalian pmp22 have been reported. Transgenic rodent studies
have shown the promoter regions and sequence conservation of the gene [6,7]. Some in vitro studies have identified
regulatory motifs for Schwann cell specific expression of
pmp22 [8,9]. However, unidentified functional sequences
for modulation of pmp22 expression might be found by
comparative genomics analyses.
The comparative genomics approach between jawed
fishes and mammals facilitates the identification of novel
conserved motifs [10,11]. Pufferfish, a teleost fish, have a
compact genome, which has few redundant non-coding
regions and is useful for finding functional sequences
[12,13]. The elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish, has a
genome with more conserved sequences with the human
genome than the teleost fish genomes, and is expected to
assist in the identification of novel essential motifs [14].
Pufferfish and the elephant shark are, however, unsuitable
for experimental procedures. Two well known experimental teleost fish, zebrafish and medaka are available for
both bioinformatics analyses and laboratory research.
In the present vertebrate phylogeny, the myelin sheath is
seen only among jawed vertebrates [1,15]. It is unclear
whether an adequate pmp22 transcription level is necessary for correct myelination in all jawed vertebrates. To
address this issue, we established a transgenic medaka fish
line overexpressing pmp22 and analyzed aberrations in
their PNS. Although zebrafish is more universally used for
experiments, we focused on medaka fish [16], because the
medaka fish genome has shorter non-coding regions than
the zebrafish [17], and thus is advantageous for bioinformatics analyses. Comparative genomics analyses were
performed to identify conserved non-coding sequences.

Our study reveals that pmp22 has an important role in
myelin formation not only in mammals but also in fishes,
and shows that the gene structure and some regulatory
motifs are conserved among jawed vertebrates.

Results
In silico identification of the pmp22 ortholog in medaka
fish
To identify the pmp22 ortholog in medaka fish, a phylogenic tree of the EMP/PMP22 family was drawn based on
the amino acid sequence alignment (Figure 1A). The teleost fish genomes, which have undergone another genome
duplication compared to other vertebrates [12,18], have
pmp22 paralogs. In medaka fish, two candidate EST
sequences for pmp22, including the full length coding
regions, are on LG8 and LG19, both of which correspond
to human chromosome 17 [19]. The pmp22 cluster that
includes mammalian orthologs is clearly separated from
the other sequences (bootstrap value, 981). The medaka
fish EST sequence AM313848, which maps to the syntenic
region of LG19, clustered with mammalian PMP22
sequences. The transmembrane regions, N41 glycosylation site (NXS/T) and C terminus ER-retention/retrieval
signal (LRKRE) [20] are conserved in the PMP22 cluster
(Figure 1B). This suggests that the gene on LG19 has been
conserved as pmp22 in medaka fish (ol_pmp22) and the
other gene has been destined for degradation or neo-functionalization. Thus, we focused on the ol_pmp22 candidate encoded on LG19. Ol_pmp22 endogenous
transcription was detected in multiple tissues of adult fish
(additional file 1).
Reduction in peripheral nerve conduction velocity and
aberrant myelination in the ol_pmp22 over-expression
fish
We constructed a plasmid containing the promoterless
FRT flanked EGFP coding sequence with a polyadenylation site. The FLP/FRT recombination system is more
active than the Cre/loxP system at approximately 26°C
[21], which is a suitable temperature for medaka fish
breeding. An 11 kbp fragment containing the region
upstream of the ol_pmp22 translation start codon and the
FLAG tagged ol_pmp22 coding region with a polyadenylation site were inserted into the promoter and downstream
of the FRT flanked region, respectively (additional file 2).
This construct was injected into the one-cell stage medaka
fish STII (wild type) [22]. We obtained a transgenic fish
line with EGFP expression, regulated by the region
upstream of the ol_pmp22 translation start codon, (GFP
fish). We observed distinct GFP fluorescence from 3 day
postfertilization (dpf) (additional file 3). Strong EGFP fluorescence was observed in the boundary region of the
midbrain/hindbrain, longitudinal fissure of cerebrum,
eye epithelium, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, gill,
liver, kidney, pharynx, intestine, bulbous arteriosus and

Sequence conservation of PMP22 in jawed vertebrates. (A) Phylogenic tree of amino acid sequences of the EMP/PMP22
family in jawed vertebrates was drawn by using clustelX and NJ plot. The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values based on
10,000 replications. Sequences from each subfamily clustered together. The red arrowhead shows the corresponding sequence
of ol_pmp22. (B) The amino acid alignment consisting of the mammalian, avian, amphibian, fish pmp22 genes and medaka fish
paralogs was drawn by using clustelX and GeneDoc. The white letter on the black background indicates 100 percent conserved blocks. The white letter on the dark gray background indicates 80 percent or greater conserved blocks. The black letter on the bright gray background indicates 60 percent or greater conserved blocks.

Though there was a time lag from GFP transcription to fluorescence, the GFP fish fluorescence pattern was consistent with a zebrafish pmp22 study, which was the first
report of fish pmp22 [23]. An immunofluorescence study
using anti-GFP antibody showed transgene expression in
adult Schwann cells, indicating that the 11 kbp region
upstream of the ol_pmp22 translation start codon contains
sequences for Schwann cell expression (Figure 2). Then,

line (pmp22 fish). The transgene, FLAG tagged ol_pmp22,
was transcribed in the pmp22 fish, and transcribed at a
low level in the GFP fish (Figure 3A). However quantitative RT-PCR showed no significant difference in total
ol_pmp22 mRNA levels between the wild type and GFP
fish. Compared to the control lines, wild type and GFP
fish, the ol_pmp22 transcription level was approximately
two-fold higher in the pmp22 fish (Figure 3B).

To observe the electrical excitability of the fish PNS, population spikes of nerve fibers activated by electrical stimulation were detected in sagittal sections of the adult fish
trunk. Activated spikes were not observed with the
sodium channel blocker, TTX (1 μM) with 100 μA stimulation, suggesting that the spikes were generated by electrical excitability of neurons (Figure 3C). We observed the
peaks of population spikes immediately after 60 μA stimulation and estimated the NCV by the distance between
two channels divided by the time lag of the peaks (Figure
3D, E, F). The wild type and GFP fish had similar NCVs
(9.566 ± 1.542 m/s, n = 5 and 9.700 ± 1.457 m/s, n = 5,
respectively), while the pmp22 fish had approximately
one fifth the control line NCV value (1.924 ± 0.738 m/s,
n = 5) (Figure 3G).
To test kinematic abnormalities, we observed medaka fish
swimming in running water. Medaka fish usually swim
against the current to keep their position. However, in a
rapid current, the fish were swept downstream while
swimming against the current. We measured flow distances of the wild type, GFP fish and pmp22 fish per time
in rapid water current (0.25 m/s). The pmp22 fish had a
tendency to be swept away faster than the control lines
(Figure 3H), indicating that pmp22 over-expression causes
weak swimming ability in medaka fish.
From external observations, there were not obvious morphological and developmental abnormalities between the
controls and pmp22 fish. However, aberrations were
observed in cross sections of pmp22 fish motor nerve fibers by electron microscopy (Figure 4). The pmp22 fish
might have undergone hypo- and hypermyelination in
the PNS, similar to the mammalian CMT1A phenotype. In
the pmp22 fish PNS, almost all observed myelin sheaths
were likely to be thin and uncompacted (Figure 4D). We
observed abnormal features, which looked like attenuated
fibers, in- and outfolding myelin (Figure 4E, F, G),
enlarged Schwann cell nuclei (Figure 4B, H, I), bare axons
(Figure 4H), wide periaxonal spaces (Figure 4B, K), loose
basal laminas (Figure 4B, L), and granules between the
nerve fiber and myelin sheath (Figure 4B, K). Furthermore, we observed macrophages near the fibers with myelin debris (Figure 4M, N). These abnormalities were not
observed in the wild type PNS. Although the typical onion
bulb formation, which is the remarkable feature of demyelinating-remyelinating neuropathies, was not observed
in the pmp22 fish, our observations indicate that prevention of pmp22 over-expression is important for keeping
fast peripheral NCV and maintaining the myelin sheath in
jawed vertebrates.
Alternative first exons have been conserved in ol_pmp22
Human and rodent pmp22 genes have alternative untranslated first exons, 1A and 1B [24]. Exon1A, located

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/10/60

upstream of exon1B, is transcribed in Schwann cells,
while the 1B transcript is ubiquitously expressed. In the
database, ol_pmp22 EST sequences always have the same
first exon. To confirm whether ol_pmp22 has a single first
exon or alternative first exons, we constructed the EGFP
expression constructs regulated by several regions
upstream of the ol_pmp22 translation start codon, and
analyzed the EGFP fluorescence patterns by a transient
expression assay. The constructs, p11-0, p6.5-0, p3-0,
p6.5-3, and p11-5, contain 11 kbp, 6.5 kbp, 3 kbp, 6.5
kbp to 3 kbp followed by 0.5 kbp, and 11 kbp to 5 kbp
upstream of the translation start codon, respectively (Figure 5F). The fish injected with p11-0 and p6.5-0 had EGFP
fluorescence in morphologically identified Schwann cells
[25] and other tissues (Figure 5A, B). Although our transient expression assay was not quantitative, the p11-0 fish
had more EGFP expression than the p6.5-0 fish, except in
the Schwann cells. The p3-0 fish had no visible EGFP
expression in the Schwann cells; however, it had fluorescence in other tissues (Figure 5C). Compared to the p3-0
fish, EGFP expression in the p6.5-3 fish was distinct in
Schwann cells, but not in other tissues (Figure 5D). We
identified the first exon of the EGFP transcript of the p6.53, as the region corresponding to ol_pmp22 exon1A
(DDBJ: AB465505). The transcription start site (TSS) of
the ol_pmp22 1A transcript is located 5,193 bp upstream
of the translation start codon. Then we observed EGFP fluorescence only in Schwann cells of the p11-5 fish (Figure
5E). This finding suggests that the exon-intron structure of
pmp22 has been conserved in jawed vertebrates.
Primer sets for the detection of 1A, 1B and total ol_pmp22
transcripts were designed. We measured mRNA levels in
the whole bodies of 4, 6, 8, 14 and 30 dpf wild type fish
(additional file 4). Beta-actin transcripts were detected for
an internal control. Each average of 4 dpf ol_pmp22 levels
was defined as 1.0 to quantify the relative transcription
levels of total, 1A and 1B (Figure 6). The 1A transcript was
significantly upregulated in 8 dpf, then decreased in 14
dpf and increased again in 30 dpf. On the other hand, in
transient expression assays, the fish with p11-5, lacking
the region downstream of exon1A, had no fluorescence
until the hatching stage (8–10 dpf), whereas the others,
p11, p6.5 and p6.5-3 fish, were visible in the Schwann cell
lineage from the embryonic stage (data not shown). These
results suggest that the regulatory mechanism of 1A transcription before the hatching stage is different from after
hatching, and intron1A contains the region for embryonic
stage specific regulation.
Conserved sequences in the pmp22 region
Some regulatory motifs have already been identified in
the promoter regions of human and rodent pmp22
exon1A [8,24]. NF1 is a conserved non-coding sequence
of myelin genes and is located between the TATA-box and

the TSS of the pmp22 1A promoter. SREB is the binding
site for the sterol regulatory element binding proteins
which are transcription factors for cholesterol homeostasis. The FP330 motif B is a conserved regulatory motif in
myelin gene promoters. CREB, which is the binding site
for the cyclic AMP response element binding protein, has
been conserved in several gene promoters in vertebrates
[26,27]. Thus, we analyzed the pmp22 conserved non-coding sequences in jawed vertebrates.

First, in the ol_pmp22 region, we examined the region
upstream of exon1A and downstream of the stop codon
(DDBJ: AB465503 and DDBJ: AB465504, respectively).
We scanned for four known conserved mammalian motifs
in the promoter region of ol_pmp22 exon1A by a motif
finding program [28]. Although NF1 and SREB were not
found, we identified two known regulatory motifs, FP330
motif B and CREB (Figure 7). The FP330 motif B is located
immediately upstream of the TSS of human and rodent
pmp22 exon1A [24]. The rat Schwannoma cell study
revealed that the region around the FP330 motif B is

involved with positive regulation of pmp22 1A transcription, and identified the important residues of this motif
for DNA-protein interaction (CCAT), located at 3 bp to 6
bp downstream of the motif [9]. The FP330 motif B is also
found in the promoter region of ol_pmp22 exon1A (-57 to
-46, relative to the TSS of the ol_pmp22 1A transcript),
however the important residues are not fully conserved
(CAAA), which is the sequence at the corresponding position in mammals. In the promoter region of human
pmp22 (hs_pmp22), CREB is identified as the silencer at 1.7
kbp upstream of the 1A TSS [8]. We identified CREB sites
at -843 to -836 and -266 to -259 in mouse pmp22
(mm_pmp22) exon1A and ol_pmp22 exon1A, respectively.

To identify novel conserved non-coding sequences of
pmp22 in jawed vertebrates, we performed comparative
genomics analyses. Among hs_, mm_ and ol_pmp22, the
multiple alignment of genomic sequences revealed some
conserved sequences in the non-coding regions (Figure 8).
Then, we analyzed these conserved regions in pmp22 of
jawed vertebrates. Although, some conserved non-coding
regions, located in intron2–4 among hs_, mm_ and
ol_pmp22, were not found in other species, the 3'UTR
sequence was highly conserved among jawed vertebrates,
which includes an mRNA destabilization signal (ATTTA)
(Figure 9, 10A). This conserved sequence starts approximately 100 bp to 200 bp downstream of the pmp22 stop
codon. Next, we searched for short conserved sequences

by a motif finding program [29]. We tried several combinations of the species in each region. One significant
sequence pattern was found in intron1A among human,
mouse, rat and medaka fish. Because exon1A has only
been identified in human, mouse, rat and medaka fish, we
searched for this pattern in the upstream region of exon1B
in other species. This pattern was significantly conserved
in jawed vertebrates, suggesting that the pattern is likely to
be functional (Figure 9, 10B).

Discussion
Pmp22 over-expression causes reduction in peripheral
NCV and aberrant myelination in jawed vertebrates
Increase of pmp22 expression causes CMT1A in humans
and rodents. CMT1A patients, which have a heterozygous
tandem duplication of a 1.5 Mbp region that includes
hs_pmp22, have reduced peripheral NCV, aberrant myelination and distal muscle atrophy [3,5]. CMT1A rodent
models with pmp22 over-expression, have been established to understand and treat this neuropathy [30-32]. In
mouse models with a human YAC containing hs_pmp22,
the degree of the CMT1A phenotype depends on the
hs_pmp22 transcription level associated with YAC copy
number [33,34]. The C22 mouse, a CMT1A model with 7
YAC copies, shows significant demyelinating neuropathy.
A mouse study with tetracycline inducible pmp22 overexpression reveals that demyelination occurs only when

pmp22 is highly expressed in adult, and that the neuropathic phenotype is reversible [35]. Rat in vivo and in vitro
studies show that progesterone promotes pmp22 1A transcription in Schwann cells [36,37]. A CMT1A rat model,
having 1.6 fold higher pmp22 transcription than wild type
rats, is used for the progesterone antagonist test. The progesterone antagonist reduces pmp22 expression level. The
treated CMT1A rats show higher motor performance than
controls with the relief of muscle atrophy and sciatic nerve
demyelination [38]. Ascorbic acid improves the CMT1A
phenotype through the inhibition of cyclic AMP stimulation of pmp22 transcription. The ascorbic acid treated C22
mice have more activity, correct myelination and a longer
life span than control neuropathy mice [39]. The principles of these treatments are based on the reduction of
pmp22 transcription. Recently, another approach for the
treatment of this neuropathy has been reported. In the
C22 Schwann cells, there are large aggresomes, including
PMP22 and ubiquitin, at perinuclear regions [40]. Also,
the HSP90 inhibitor promotes heat shock protein expression, and corrects Schwann cell myelination with clearance of aggregated PMP22 [41].
The myelin sheath enables saltatory conduction in animals [1]. The jawed vertebrates have myelinated axons
and conserved pmp22. To analyze the relationship
between pmp22 transcription level and peripheral myeli-

nation in medaka fish, pmp22 fish were established.
Compared with control lines, ol_pmp22 overexpressing
fish, having approximately two-fold higher transcription
of ol_pmp22, have one fifth peripheral NCV and aberrant
PNS myelination, in spite of the transgene lacking intron
2–4 and the region downstream of the coding regions
(Figure 3, 4). CMT1A patients and rodent models have
hypo- and hypermyelination, attenuated fibers and onion
bulb formations in the PNS [3,32]. In PNS, PMP22 interacts with α6β4 integrin to stabilize the attachment
between the basal lamina and myelin sheath [42]. The β4
integrin and distroglycan double knockout mice lose myelin sheath stability with loose basal laminas and macrophage infiltration [43]. The macrophage-mediated myelin
disruption occurs in human CMT1A with the pmp22
duplication [44], the C61 mouse with 4 YAC copies [45],
the myelin glycoprotein P0 heterozygous deficient mouse
[46], and the gap junction protein CX32 null mouse [47].
P0 and CX32 contribute to myelin formation in PNS [4].

Similar to these phenotypes observed in the PNS in mammals, we found loose basal laminas and macrophages
including myelin debris in the PNS of pmp22 fish (Figure
4). Therefore our observations of the pmp22 fish suggest
that the association of pmp22 expression levels with myelin maintenance is common among jawed vertebrates.
Although, the pmp22 fish have normal growth, feeding
and mating throughout life in the laboratory, it seems that
prevention of pmp22 over-expression provides some
advantages for selective pressure because of reduced NCV,
weak swimming ability against the current and aberrant
myelination caused by pmp22 over-expression in medaka
fish.
The exon-intron structure and non-coding motifs of
pmp22 are conserved
The PMP22 sequence is highly conserved in jawed vertebrates, but less so in the chordate [48]. Alignments show
that there are many conserved non-coding regions among

mammals, and some regions in jawed vertebrates. Human
and rodent pmp22 consist of alternative untranslated first
exons, 1A and 1B [24], and four coding exons. Mammalian exon1A, located upstream of exon1B, is specifically
expressed in Schwann cells. The alternative first exons also
exist in ol_pmp22, suggesting that the common ancestor of
teleost fishes and mammals had these exons, and the gene
structure has been conserved in present jawed vertebrates.
The ol_pmp22 1A transcript was upregulated in near hatching stage fish (Figure 6), which have immature Schwann
cells with radial sorting in correspondence with zebrafish
and rodent development [25,49-51]. Radial sorting is a
step for differentiation from immature Schwann cells into
myelinating Schwann cells. In this step, immature
Schwann cells establish a 1:1 relationship with axons. On
the other hand, as well as the rodent pmp22 1A transcript,
which is elevated during myelination after birth [24,52],
ol_pmp22 1A transcription increased after hatching (Figure
6). These results suggest that there is similar temporal
expression of pmp22 1A transcription among jawed vertebrates.

Our bioinformatics analyses found that ol_pmp22 has two
known conserved regulatory motifs (Figure 7). The FP330
motif B (CTCTCAGGC) is conserved immediately
upstream of the TSS of pmp22 exon1A [9,24]. This motif is
found in promoters of essential myelin genes in mammals. While in the promoter region of hs_pmp22 exon1A,
a CREB half-site (TGAC) has been identified as the
silencer responding to low cyclic AMP levels [8]. A CREB
half-site and CREB TG variant (TGATGTCA) [27] were
found in the mm_ and ol_pmp22 exon1A promoter region,
respectively. However, it is unclear whether both of these
CREB sites are functional.
In mammalian Schwann cells, pmp22 1A transcription is
activated by the zinc finger transcription factor EGR2,
which is the major positive regulator for essential myelin
genes [53]. The direct target genes of EGR2 are p0, mbp,
mag, prx and dhh, but not pmp22 [54,55]. In the ol_pmp22
region, the EGR2 binding motif was not found in our
analyses. In a transgenic mouse study, over-expression of
POU-domain protein POU3f1 downregulates pmp22 tran-

scription [56]. There are many candidate sequences for
POU3f1 binding in the promoter region of ol_pmp22
(data not shown); however it is unknown which sites are
functional. MicroRNAs miR-9 and miR-29a inhibit pmp22
translation [57,58]. The binding sequences for miR-9 and
miR-29a are conserved among human, rodent and
chicken pmp22, but not among amphibian and jawed fish
pmp22.
Furthermore, in this study, two additional conserved
sequences were found. The pmp22 gene has highly conserved sequence in the 3'UTR, the length of which is about
70 bp, and includes an mRNA destabilization signal (Figure 10A). This 3'UTR sequence is unique in the genome.
It is possible that the 3'UTR conservation contributes to
modulating the PMP22 level by transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation. By using a motif finding program, the novel conserved short sequence was found in

intron1A of human, rodent and medaka fish pmp22 and
in the upstream region of exon1B of the other species
pmp22 (Figure 10B). In our transient expression assay, fish
having the GFP expression construct, lacking the region
downstream of exon1A, had no fluorescence until the
hatching stage. These results suggest that the regulatory
mechanism of 1A transcription in the embryonic stage is
different from that after the hatching stage, and that this
novel motif must be responsible for the embryonic stage
expression of pmp22.
The DNA-binding domains of several transcription factors
and short DNA sequences for transcription factor binding
are usually conserved in animal genomes [59,60]. Comparison of the corresponding genome regions between
fishes and mammals is useful for identification of functionally conserved sequences. We have successfully found
novel conserved non-coding motifs (Figure 10), however

further studies are necessary to fully understand pmp22
expression.

Conclusion
We investigated the relation of pmp22 transcription level
with PNS pathophysiology in medaka fish. Similar to the
mammalian CMT1A phenotype caused by pmp22 overexpression, reduction in peripheral NCV and aberrant
myelin formation were observed in the pmp22 overexpression fish, having two fold higher transcription of
ol_pmp22. These results suggest that the contribution of
adequate pmp22 expression in PNS is common among
jawed vertebrates. Moreover, we elucidated the structural
conservation of the gene among human, rodent and
medaka fish, and found novel conserved non-coding
motifs. These results indicate that the common ancestor
for jawed vertebrates had acquired myelin formation with
the associated gene functions including pmp22 and it has
been conserved in present species.

Methods
Medaka fish breeding and selection
All fish lines were maintained at around 26°C under a 14
h light and 10 h dark cycle. Collected eggs were grown
with 0.3% sea salt water. GFP transgenic fish were
screened by fluorescent microscopy observation at embryonic and juvenile stages. Genotyping to select pmp22 overexpression fish was performed by PCR amplification of
tail fin genomic DNA using primers ip166 (5'-CATGGATTACAAAGACGACGA-3') and ip167 (5'-ATGAGTCCGCTGATGAGCAC-3'). Manipulation of fish was performed
following both national and institutional guidelines.
DNA, RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis
Fish genomic DNA was prepared by phenol-chloroform
and ethanol precipitation. Plasmids were prepared with
the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was extracted by ISOGEN (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan). First strand cDNA was synthesized by
using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (GE Healthcare,
Tokyo, Japan).
DNA construction
To construct the EGFP basic vector, an NcoI/XbaI digested
EGFP coding fragment was obtained from a pEGFP vector
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and inserted into the
NcoI/XbaI digested pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

The 11 kbp region upstream of the translation start codon
of ol_pmp22 was amplified by PCR with HdrR genomic
DNA as the template and primers ip097 (5'-ATACGCGTATCATTTTCAAGGTCACTGGG-3') and ip098 (5'AAGGATCCTTCACGGCCAGTCTAAGAAGAGAGGAGACA-3'). To construct the p11-0 EGFP expression vector,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/10/60

the amplified 11 kbp DNA fragment was digested with
MluI/BamHI, and inserted into the MluI/BglII digested
EGFP basic vector. The amplified 11 kbp DNA was
digested with BamHI and partially digested with BglII, to
obtain 6.5-0, 3-0 and 6.5-3 fragments. To construct the
p6.5-0 and p3-0 vector, the fragments were inserted into
the BglII digested and BAP treated EGFP basic vector. The
0.5 kbp fragment including the splice accepter sequence
was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA
using primers ip119 (5'-TAAGATCTCTTTGCTCTGGGTTAAAGTT-3') and ip098, digested with BglII/BamHI and
inserted into the BglII digested and BAP treated EGFP
basic vector. To construct the p6.5-3 EGFP expression vector, the 6.5-3 fragment was inserted into the BglII digested
and BAP treated EGFP vector containing the 0.5 kbp
region upstream of the translation start codon. To construct p11-5, the 6 kbp fragment including ol_pmp22
exon1A and its upstream region was obtained by PCR
amplification of genomic DNA using primer ip097 and
ip134
(5'-TTTGGATCCAGTGAGGCTCTACCTGCTCG3'), digested with MluI/BamHI and inserted into MluI/
BglII digested EGFP basic vector.
The FRT flanked EGFP-BGHp(A) – FLAG-ol_pmp22 vector was constructed for establishing the pmp22 overexpression line. The FLAG-ol_pmp22 fragment was
obtained by RT-PCR of medaka 8 dpf whole embryos
using primers ip017 (5'-CCATGGATTACAAAGACGACGACGACAAAATGCTGATCTTA-3') and ip018 (5'-TCTAGATCATTCTCGCTTCCT-3'). The PCR product was
digested with NcoI/XbaI and inserted into the NcoI/XbaI
digested pGL3-basic vector. The fragment of BGHp(A)
was amplified by PCR with phrGFPII-1 (Stratagene, La
Jolla, CA, USA) as template and primers ip041 (5'GGTCTAGATTCCCTTTAGTGAG-3') and ip042 (5'-GCGGATCCGGCGCCCCAGCATG-3'), digested with XbaI/
BamHI and inserted into the XbaI/BamHI digested EGFP
basic vector. To construct the FRT-flanked EGFP-BGHp(A)
vector, the fragment was obtained by PCR amplification
with the EGFP-BGHp(A) vector as template and primers
ip044
(5'-CGAGATCTGAAGTTCCTATTCCGAAGTTCCTATTCTCTA GAAAGTATAGGAACTTCAAGCTTGGCATTCCGGTACTG-3') and ip045 (5'-AGAGCGCTCGAGGGC
CCGTCTCCCATGAAGTTCCTATACTTTCTAGAGAA
TAGGAACTTCGGAATAGGAACTTCGAATTCCGACGATAGTCATGCCC-3'), digested with BglII/Eco47III and
inserted into the BglII/Eco47III digested pGL3-basic vector. An NcoI/Eco47III digested FLAG-ol_pmp22 fragment
was obtained, and it was inserted into the BsmBI/Eco47III
digested FRT-flanked EGFP-BGHp(A) vector. This vector
was digested with MluI/BglII and ligated with the MluI/
BamHI digested 11 kbp PCR product of the region
upstream of the translation start codon (see additional file
2, the plasmid construct was drawn with PlasMapper
[61]).

Microinjection
Medaka fish fertilized eggs were collected immediately
after spawning and placed into cold Yamamoto's solution
(133 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2.1 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM
NaHCO3, pH 7.3). The solution (0.1 M K3PO4, 0.05%
phenol red) with either plasmid DNA (30 ng/μl) or
mRNA (400 ng/μl) was injected into the cytoplasm of one
– cell stage eggs through the chorion. For in vitro capped
mRNA synthesis, template DNA including the T7 promoter and FLP recombinase coding sequence were amplified by PCR with pOG44 as template and primers ip131
(5'-ATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCTCCACAGGTGTCCACTC-3') and ip132 (5'-ACCCGCACATACAGCTCACT-3'). Flp mRNA was synthesized by using the
mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX,
USA) and polyadenylated by the Poly (A) Tailing kit
(Ambion). A pressure injector, FemtoJet (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany), was used with borosilicate glass

Immunofluorescence
Adult trunks were removed along with the bones and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 4°C for several hours. Fixed samples were decalcificated by 6% sucrose at 4°C overnight.
Infiltration and embedding in glycol methacrylate were
performed with Technovit 8100 (Heraeus Kulzer, Werheim, Germany). Embedded samples were sliced horizontally (10 μm) by a rotary microtome, Leica RM2165
(Leica, Nussloch, Germany) equipped with a disposable
microtome blade N35 (Feather, Osaka, Japan), stretched
with distilled water on slide glasses, and dried at room
temperature (RT) overnight. After soaking with PBS, samples were incubated with 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K at 37°C
for 15 min, rinsed with PBS, incubated with blocking
solution (1% horse serum in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20) at
RT for 1 h, incubated with 1/500 anti-GFP monoclonal
antibody (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in blocking solution at 4°C overnight, rinsed with PBS with 0.5% Tween
20, incubated with 1/500 Alexa fluor 488 conjugated antimouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) in
blocking solution at RT for 1 h, and rinsed with PBS.
Bright-field and fluorescence images were observed using
a confocal microscope FV1000 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)
and data were obtained by Fluoview ver 1.6b software
(Olympus).
5'-RACE
Total RNA was prepared from whole bodies of p6.5-3
injected fish at 14 dpf. The SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech) and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) were used for first strand cDNA
synthesis. RACE PCR was performed by using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech) with primer ip128 (5'-TAGGTCAGGGTGGTCACGAGGGT-3').

Quantitative RT-PCR
The target mRNA quantification was performed by using
the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The following primers were
used: ip150 (5'-GCTCTCTGATGATTCTTGCTTTTG-3')
and ip151 (5'-AGGAGCAGAATGTCCAGAATGC-3') for
the 1A transcript, ip152 (5'-CTACTGCAGGTCCACTCTTTTGG-3') and ip153 (5'-GGCCAGTTTCAAGCAAATCG-3') for the 1B transcript, ip160 (5'TCCTCTTCTTCTGTCAGCTCTTCA-3') and ip161 (5'GCTCCGCTCATCACAAACAA-3') for total ol_pmp22 transcript, ip154 (5'-GCCCCACCAGAGCGTAAATAC-3') and
ip155 (5'-CATCGTACTCCTGCTTGCTGAT-3') for betaactin[62]. Relative quantification was calculated according
to the manufacturer's instructions.
Electrophysiology
The electrical excitability of fish nerve was measured
according to Imamura Y., 2008 [63]. Sagittal fish slices
(500 μm) were cut by a vibrating microtome, DTK-1000
(DSK, Kyoto, Japan) in an oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2)
physiological solution, artificial cerebrospinal fluid
(ACSF) at 4°C, containing: 126 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1
mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1,25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM
CaCl2 and 10 mM D-glucose. The sample was attached to
a 64 channel-electrode dish perfused with ACSF (3 ml/
min). Peripheral nerve fibers were stimulated with 0.1 Hz,
60 or 100 μA, and population spikes of fish nerve fibers at
300 μm, 600 μm, and 900 μm distance between two channels were recorded in the perfusion of ACSF. The recording was stored in Windows XP hardware and data analysis
was performed with Mobius software of the MED64 system (Alpha MED Sciences, Osaka, Japan). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t-test.
Swimming ability test
The medaka fish swimming ability test was performed in
running water (0.25 m/s) in a straight horizontal watercourse (depth 30 mm, width 70 mm, length 1 m) at room
temperature. Adult male fish were used. The volume of
water flow from a 15 mm diameter hose was 188 ml per
second. Medaka fish were put into a decelerated water current in a net for 30 seconds and gently released into the
rapid water current. The movie of a top view of fish swimming was acquired by a digital video camera, NV-GS250S (Matsushita, Osaka, Japan). A picture of each time point
was obtained by MotionDV STUDIO 5.3J LE for DV software (Matsushita), and analyzed by the scion image software (Scion, Frederick, MD, USA). Statistical analysis was
performed by Student's t-test.
Electron microscopy
Adult trunks were removed along with the bones and cut
into 1–2 mm pieces. Samples were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h, washed

in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min 5 times
and postfixed in 1% OsO4 in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
for 2 h. Then samples were dehydrated: 50% ethanol for
10 min, 60% ethanol for 10 min, 70% ethanol for 10 min,
80% ethanol for 10 min, 90% ethanol for 10 min, 99%
ethanol for 10 min and 100% ethanol for 20 min twice.
Dehydrated samples were transferred to propylene-oxide
for 20 min twice, 1:1 propylene-oxide:epoxyresin for 1 h,
1:3 propylene-oxide:epoxyresin for 1 h and epoxyresin
overnight. For embedding, samples were left at 60°C with
fresh epoxyresin three overnight. Ultra thin sections (80
nm) were obtained on an Ultra microtome EM UC6
(Leica, Vienna, Austria), counterstained by Reynolds
method and examined on an H-7650 (Hitachi, Tokyo,
Japan). Medaka fish motor nerve fibers were determined
on the locations according to the studies for zebrafish
motor nerve fibers [64,65].
Bioinformatics analysis
Sequences of the EMP/PMP22 family were obtained by
BLAST and BLAT, using human amino acid sequences of
the family as the queries. For phylogenic analysis, mRNA
sequences were translated into amino acid sequences. The
analyses for conserved motifs were performed by the scan
for matches [28], Weeder [29] and jasper [66]. Multiple
alignment of pmp22 was performed by LAGAN [67] and
presented by VISTA [68].
