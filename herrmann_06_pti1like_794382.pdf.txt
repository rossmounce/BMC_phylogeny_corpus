Abstract
Background: The tomato kinase Pto confers resistance to bacterial speck disease caused by Pseudomonas
syringae pv. tomato in a gene for gene manner. Upon recognition of specific avirulence factors the Pto kinase
activates multiple signal transduction pathways culminating in induction of pathogen defense. The soluble
cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase Pti1 is one target of Pto phosphorylation and is involved in the
hypersensitive response (HR) reaction. However, a clear role of Pti1 in plant pathogen resistance is
uncertain. So far, no Pti1 homologues from monocotyledonous species have been studied.
Results: Here we report the identification and molecular analysis of four Pti1-like kinases from maize
(ZmPti1a, -b, -c, -d). These kinase genes showed tissue-specific expression and their corresponding
proteins were targeted to different cellular compartments. Sequence similarity, expression pattern and
cellular localization of ZmPti1b suggested that this gene is a putative orthologue of Pti1 from tomato. In
contrast, ZmPti1a was specifically expressed in pollen and sequestered to the plasma membrane, evidently
owing to N-terminal modification by myristoylation and/or S-acylation. The ZmPti1a:GFP fusion protein
was not evenly distributed at the pollen plasma membrane but accumulated as an annulus-like structure
which co-localized with callose (1,3-β-glucan) deposition. In addition, co-localization of ZmPti1a and
callose was observed during stages of pollen mitosis I and pollen tube germination. Maize plants in which
ZmPti1a expression was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) produced pollen with decreased
competitive ability. Hence, our data provide evidence that ZmPti1a plays an important part in a signalling
pathway that accelerates pollen performance and male fitness.
Conclusion: ZmPti1a from maize is involved in pollen-specific processes during the progamic phase of
reproduction, probably in crucial signalling processes associated with regions of callose deposition. Pollensporophyte interactions and pathogen induced HR show certain similarities. For example, HR has been
shown to be associated with cell wall reinforcement through callose deposition. Hence, it is hypothesized
that Pti1 kinases from maize act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes
associated with callose, however during different developmental programs and in different tissue types.

Background
Protein kinases in plants have been found to be involved
in basic features of plant defense and plant fertilization.
Increasing knowledge about the underlying molecular
mechanisms suggests several parallels between both processes [1-3]. Plant-pathogen recognition has been studied
extensively in tomato in which gene for gene resistance
against certain Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strains is
conferred by the serine/threonine kinase Pto. Upon recognition of bacterial avirulence factors, Pto acts in concert
with the Prf protein resulting in the activation of multiple
signal transduction pathways culminating in the induction of defense responses including HR [4]. Several Ptointeracting (Pti) proteins were identified to act in Ptomediated signal transduction including the protein kinase
Pti1 and three transcription factors (Pti4/5/6), respectively [5,6]. Pti1 (here referred to as SlPti1 for clarity reasons) is a cytoplasmic protein kinase capable of
autophosphorylation in vitro [5] and moreover also be
phosphorylated by Pto. Tobacco plants over-expressing
S1Pti show enhanced HR in leaves in response to avirulence factor treatment indicating a functional role of
SlPti1 in Pto-mediated disease response [5]. However, a
precise role of SlPti1 in plant pathogen resistance has
remained unclear, owing to functional redundancy of different/additional Pti1 kinases. Three SlPti1 homologous
kinases have been cloned from soybean [7,8], sPti1a,
sPti1b and GmPti1. The former two do not display in vitro
autophosphorylation activity [7], whereas the latter,
GmPti1, possesses autophosphorylation activity. GmPti1
gene expression was found to accelerate in response to
wounding and salicylic acid treatment in seedling leaves
[8]. These findings suggest different Pti1-like kinases to
possess different properties and biological functions in
plants.
Cell-cell recognition and signal response reactions during
plant-pathogen interaction are thought to be molecularly
related to certain steps of plant reproduction, e.g. pollenpistil recognition, compatibility reactions, and pollen
tube growth. In studies of the genetic and molecular basis
of pollen development and function more than 150 pollen-expressed genes from more than 28 species have been
identified [9-11]. Classification of pollen expressed genes
identified a high number of genes which are involved in
signal transduction. Many of these genes encode putative
protein kinases [10,12,13]. Accordingly, leucine-rich
repeat (LRR) Ser/Thr-type plant receptor kinases (PRK)
LePRK1 to 3 from tomato and several interacting proteins
like KPP, LAT52 and LeSHY have already been attributed
to signaling processes during pollen tube growth [14-17].
Mutations of a number of such gametophytically important genes often result in altered Mendelian segregation
ratios due to an abolished or reduced transmission of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

linked marker through pollen. Such genes include SEC8,
ROP2, LIMPET POLLEN and TTD genes [17-21]. Most of
these mutations cause obvious defects in the pollen grain
and affect early stages of pollen development. In contrast,
only few mutations are known that are transmitted
through the male at low frequencies but cause no obvious
defects in pollen morphology. These genes appear to
affect more pollen competitiveness rather than development, e.g. TTD41 and ROP2 [18,21].
In this study we report the identification and molecular
analyses of four Pti1 kinases from maize (ZmPti1a, -b, -c,
-d). The genes were expressed in different tissues and
showed different subcellular localizations. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed the existence of three conserved Pti1
kinase subgroups in higher plants. Based on its sequence
similarity, expression profile and subcellular localization
ZmPti1b was suggested to be a putative SlPti1 ortholog. In
contrast, the functional kinase ZmPti1a was specific to
pollen and targeted to the plasma membrane, evidently
owing to N-terminal acylation. ZmPti1a co-localizes with
regions of callose deposition at stages of pollen maturation and germination. Silencing of the ZmPti1a gene
resulted in a significant decrease in the competitive ability
of pollen. These findings provide evidences of ZmPti1a to
play an important role in influencing pollen fitness.
Our data further suggest that Pti1 kinases from maize act
in various tissues and in different but mechanistically conserved plant response pathways which likely involve similar signals and/or signal transduction molecules.

Results
Pti1-like kinases of maize
A 217 bp partial cDNA of ZmPti1a was cloned in a molecular approach with the aim to identify genes that are specifically expressed in maize pollen. Using this clone as a
hybridization probe, two nearly identical 1.6 kb fullGenlength
cDNAs
[GenBank:AY554281,
Bank:AY554282] were isolated from a λ-cDNA library of
in vitro germinated pollen from white pollen (whp) plants
[22] expressing the c2 gene. Both cDNAs probably represent different alleles of the same gene. The cDNA clone
AY554281 was further analyzed in this study. AY554281
contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1122 bp, a 207
bp 5' untranslated region and a 304 bp 3' untranslated
region including a poly(A)+ tail. The putative protein of
AY554281 is 374 amino acids (aa) in length with a molecular mass of 40.8 kDa (Fig. 1A). Database search revealed
69% identity and 75% similarity to the Pto-interactor 1
(Pti1) protein kinase of Solanum lycopersicum [5]. Therefore the cloned gene was named Zea mays Pti1a (ZmPti1a).
The putative catalytic kinase domain of ZmPti1a starts
approximately 75 aa after the first methionine and contains 11 canonical subdomains that are typical of serine/

threonine kinases (Fig. 1A; [23]). Out of the 15 invariant
amino acid residues common to the majority of protein
kinases, 13 were found to be conserved in ZmPti1a (Fig.
1A). A glutamine in subdomain III is substituted with a
glutamate at position 115 and a conserved glycine in subdomain VII is substituted with an aspartate at position
222. Identical substitutions are present in the kinase
SlPti1 [5] suggesting that ZmPti1a is also a functional
kinase. A corresponding full-length genomic clone [Genbank:AY554283] spanning the entire transcribed region
as well as 2.2 kb of the promoter of ZmPti1a was isolated
from a λ-phage library of the maize inbred LC by plaque
screening and inverse PCR. The gene consists of 8 exons
and 7 introns (Fig. 1B). The nucleotide sequence of the
deduced transcribed region was found to be nearly identical to the previously cloned cDNAs with the exception of
line specific single nucleotide polymorphisms that
changed three aa in less conserved regions of the deduced
protein. An insertion of 9 bp resulted in the addition of
three alanine residues in the c-terminus (Fig. 1A). The proposed translation start is located in exon 2. Hybridizing
bands in genomic Southern analyses with probes specific
for the promoter, 5'-UTR, ORF, and 3'-UTR of ZmPti1a
correlated well with the predicted restriction patterns of
the cloned gene and suggested that ZmPti1a is a single
copy gene (data not shown).
Database search led to the identification of additional
ESTs coding for ZmPti1a homologues from maize. These
sequences were found to be well conserved at the nucleotide level (41 to 52%), and even more conserved at the
the protein level (71 to 78%). Corresponding ORF and 3'
UTRs were amplified by RT-PCR from lines A188 and LC,
respectively. All cloned sequences were identical to their
corresponding EST with the exception of few line specific
SNPs. Accordingly, these sequences were named ZmPti1b
[Genbank:DQ647388], ZmPti1c [Genbank: DQ647389],
and ZmPti1d [Genbank: DQ647390], respectively. An EST
clone [Genbank:AY708048] which resembles ZmPti1c
was annotated previously as a salt-inducible putative serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase (Zou et al., unpublished
data). Data mining of genomic BAC and MAGI sequences
containing ZmPti1b and -d indicated that the corresponding genes possess nearly identical exon/intron structures
as compared to ZmPti1a (data not shown). This indicates
that the maize Pti1 gene family most likely originates from
a single ancestor gene. Out of the four putative ZmPti1
kinases, ZmPti1b showed highest protein similarity to
Pti1 from tomato (77% identity, 85% similarity). All
ZmPti1 proteins possess conserved kinase catalytic
domains. However, their N – and C-terminal regions are
highly variable and only some Pti1 kinases, including
ZmPti1a, were predicted to contain a putative myristoylation signal at their N-termini. Such protein modifications
in which the saturated fatty acid myristate is covalently

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

but reversibly attached to an N-terminal Gly after cotranslational cleavage of the first Met residue can fulfill
several functions, e.g. mediating membrane association.
Phylogenetic relationship of ZmPti kinases
Phylogenetic comparison of ZmPti1 proteins from maize
and putative Pti1 kinases from other plants indicated
three major Pti1 subgroups in angiosperms (I, II & III)
with the known maize proteins belonging to subgroups II
and III, respectively (Fig 2). Each subfamily possesses a
conserved N-terminal domain with a specific consensus
sequence and consists of proteins from mono – as well as
dicotyledonous species. The N-terminal domains are rich
in polar or aromatic residues and contain at least two conserved cysteines. Some of the kinases, e.g. ZmPti1a, sPti1a,
sPti1b and At3g17410 are predicted to contain a putative
N-terminal myristoylation signal. Gene organization of
most of the Pti1 kinases from Arabidopsis thaliana were
found to be similar to that of ZmPti1a, i.e. 8 exons and a
predicted translation start in exon 2 (data not shown).

Based on these findings, Pti1 genes appear to represent an
ancient kinase family in higher plants. Amino acid
sequences of the different N-terminal regions are conserved in a broad spectrum of monocotyledonous and
dicotyledonous species (Fig. 2). Thus, it is feasible to speculate that the conserved N-terminal motifs of the different
Pti1 subfamilies were retained during evolution because
of specific relevant biological functions.
ZmPti1 proteins localize to different subcellular
compartments
To investigate the subcellular localization of ZmPti1 proteins in situ, we transiently expressed in-frame coding
sequences of ZmPti1 kinases fused to green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in onion epidermal cells and in in vitro germinating pollen, respectively. When expressed under control of the ubiquitin promoter, ZmPti1a:GFP was targeted
to the cell periphery suggesting ZmPti1a to localize to the
plasma membrane (Fig 3A). This pattern was clearly different from that observed when GFP was expressed alone
(Fig 3E). Association of ZmPti1a:GFP with the plasma
membrane was also proven by confocal laser scanning
microscopy (data not shown). Twenty-four amino acids
of the ZmPti1a N-terminus were found to be sufficient to
target GFP entirely to the cell periphery (Myr:GFP, Fig.
3B). Truncation of twenty amino acids at the N-terminus
of ZmPti1a abolished cell periphery targeting coinciding
with cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the fusion
protein (ΔZmPti1a, Fig 3C). Identical results were
observed for these three ZmPti1a fusion constructs when
expressed ectopically in stably transformed maize plants
(Fig. 6 and data not shown). These findings are in agreement with the assumption that ZmPti1a is targeted to the

Phylogenetic analysis of ZmPti1 kinases. Similarity and phylogenetic relationship of Pti1 proteins from maize, rice,

plasma membrane by N-terminal acylation, likely myristoylation.
To study the structural basis of ZmPti1a being targeted to
the plasma membrane in detail, potential myristoylation
and/or palmitoylation sites, i.e. Gly2/Cys3 and Cys6/
Cys7 were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (Table
Fig. 3). Conjugation of myristate to proteins is absolutely
dependent on a glycine residue at position 2.
Exchange of Gly2 or Cys3 with Ala prevented targeting of
the ZmPt1a:GFP fusion to the cell periphery. Instead, GFP
fluorescence appeared in the nucleus and as small cytoplasmic granules (Fig. 3F and data not shown). The same
GFP pattern was seen when both, Cys3 and Cys6, were
replaced by Ala (data not shown).
Combined replacement of the adjacent amino acids Gly2
and Cys3 with Ala residues also caused nuclear localization. However, GFP fluorescence was evenly distributed in

the cytoplasm and no granules were observed (Fig. 3G). A
similar distribution of GFP fluorescence was observed
when Cys6 and Cys7 in the second motif were replaced
with alanine residues (data not shown).
These results indicate that combined mutation of single
residues in each of the two motifs (Gly2/Cys3 or Cys6/
Cys7) resulted in GFP fluorescence associated with cytoplasmic granules. This localization pattern might reflect
an imperfect targeting or mistargeting of mutated
ZmPti1a to membranes. Combined replacement of both
adjacent residues in either one of the two motifs seems to
strengthen mistargeting and completely prevents ZmPti1a
membrane association.
ZmPti1b, c and d from maize and SlPti1 from tomato naturally lack a Gly2 residue that would serve as a potential
target site of myristoylation (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, Zhou
et al. [5] predicted the tomato SlPti1 to be a cytoplasmic
kinase. Expression of a SlPti1:GFP fusion protein con-

firmed the theoretical prediction however, additionally
revealed a nuclear localization (Fig. 3D). A similar localization pattern was observed for the GFP fusion of
ZmPti1b, which is the closest SlPti1-homologue from
maize (Fig. 3H). By contrast, GFP fusions of ZmPti1c and
ZmPti1d appeared only in the cytoplasm but not in the
nucleus (Fig. 3I, data not shown). Both of these sub-group
III proteins contain a conserved N-terminal pair of
arginine residues instead of a myristoylation signal. Taken
together, ZmPti1 family members show a differential
competence for plasma membrane association, evidently
owing to their varying susceptibility to N-terminal myristoylation and/or S-acylation.
ZmPti1 genes are expressed in different maize tissues
Gene regulation of the four identified members of the
ZmPti1 family was studied during sporophytic and gametophytic development of maize. We used both, a wildtype and the whp maize line of which the latter produces
sterile pollen due to the lack of flavonol synthesis. Northern blot analysis revealed a tissue specific expression pattern for ZmPti1a with extremely high mRNA levels in
staminate spikelets ('male flower') of male inflorescences
and in pollen. ZmPti1a transcript increased strongly during flower development between 6 days before anthesis
(dba) and anthesis (Fig. 4A). Even higher transcript
amounts were detected in isolated mature pollen harvested at anthesis. Since mature pollen and staminate
spikelets at anthesis are at the same developmental stage,
it is likely that ZmPti1a expression in spikelets is mainly
due to its specific expression in the enclosed pollen rather
than in the surrounding sporophytic tissue.

In contrast to ZmPti1a, ZmPti1b, c and d were expressed at
low levels but in all sporophytic tissue types analyzed.
Only transcripts of ZmPti1c could also be detected in
mature and germinated pollen (Fig. 4A).
Because expression of ZmPti1b and ZmPti1d was absent in
mature and germinated pollen, appearance of the corresponding transcripts in all stages of the male flower development may indicate that these genes are preferentially
expressed in the sporophytic tissue of the male inflorescence.
In pollen, transcript amounts of ZmPti1a and ZmPti1c did
not differ between the pollen-sterile mutant whp and its
corresponding wild-type line (WT) indicating that pollen
sterility, due to a lack in flavonoid biosynthesis, did not
alter expressions of both ZmPti1 genes.
Taken together, these results showed that three members
of the ZmPti1 family were similarly expressed in the sporophytic maize tissues with ZmPti1c also being expressed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

in pollen. ZmPti1a expression differed significantly
because of its strong pollen specific expression.
ZmPti1b transcript increase in maize kernels after
pathogen infection
SlPti1 from tomato was shown to be involved in HR [5].
To investigate if some of the ZmPti1 genes play a role in
pathogen defense, we studied the expression of ZmPti1
genes in developing maize kernels that were infected with
the crop pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Maize cobs
were infected two days after fertilization and harvested at
different time points after infection. Because fungal infections usually proceed in diverse gradients on infected
cobs, kernels were harvested from three regions i.e. top,
middle and bottom of individual cobs.

The severeness of fungal infection in these samples was
monitored based on the visual rating using the silk channel scale [24] and by RT-PCR detection of a fungal specific
β-tubulin mRNA (Fig 4B.). The amounts of amplified βtubulin cDNAs correlated perfectly with the phenotypically visible severity of fungal infection on the cobs.
Northern blot analysis revealed a four-fold enhanced
ZmPti1b transcript level in infected kernels isolated from a
cob possessing a disease severity 6 indicating 51%–75%
of infection (Fig. 4B; 4 weeks after infection). No RNA
could be extracted from kernels located at the top of this
cob because of the advanced mode of fungal infection.
Previous Northern experiments showed that ZmPti1b was
constitutively expressed during kernel development (data
not shown). Therefore, the accelerated ZmPti1b expression could be attributed to pathogen infection. No
changes of ZmPti1b transcript levels were detected in kernels from an uninfected cob or from cobs with less severe
disease patterns (Fig 4; 2 and 3 weeks after infection).
Owing to the discrepancy of the highly variable mode of
fungal infection no conclusions could be drawn from the
experiment with respect to the putative time dependence
of ZmPti1b induction during Fusarium infection. However, accelerated ZmPti1b expression upon Fusarium infection was proven in a second independent experiment
(data not shown).
Because the experiments were conducted under non-sterile green house conditions it can not be excluded that
weakening of the cob tissues after Fusarium infection was
a result of additional pathogens, e.g. bacteria, which in
turn may have triggered ZmPti1b expression. In contrast to
ZmPti1b, expression of ZmPti1c and d was not significantly altered in this experiment.
Northern data provided evidence that at least one of the

Expression of ZmPti1 genes in various tissues at different developmental stages of maize

Expression of ZmPti1 genes in various tissues at different developmental stages of maize. (A) Expression of ZmPti1
genes was analyzed in the sterile flavonol-deficient whp maize line and its corresponding wild type (WT) in developing staminate spikelets 9 dba (-9), 6 dba (-6), 3 dba (-3) and at anthesis (0) in mature pollen isolated from spikelets at anthesis (pollen
mature), in pollen germinated in vitro for 10 min (pollen germ.), in silks, developing kernels 20 days after pollination (kernel dev.
20 dap), in kernels 7 days after germination (kernel germ.), in roots and leaves of 7-d-old seedlings and in mature leaves. Methylene blue stained ribosomal RNA is shown as loading control. (B) Expression of ZmPti1 genes in Fusarium graminearum
infected maize cobs. Pathogen infected maize cobs of line A188 were harvested over a period of four weeks after infection and
of a mock infected cob (3 weeks uninfected). RNA was isolated from kernels of cobs and divided into top (T) middle (M) and
bottom (B). Corresponding cobs are shown at the top of the figure. 20 μg of total RNA of each probe were utilized for Northern blotting and subsequently hybridized to probes specific to ZmPti1b and ZmPti1c, respectively. Methylene blue stained ribosomal RNA served as loading control of the gel. Transcripts of a constitutively expressed Fusarium β-tubulin gene [60] were
amplified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR from the same RNA probes, blotted and hybridized to a β-tubulin specific probe. The
amount of amplified cDNAs served as an indicator of the severity of pathogen infection (β-tubulin RT-PCR).

for tomato SlPti1 [5]. Accordingly, ZmPti1b was identified to be the closest homologue of SlPti1 among the four
identified ZmPti1 kinases (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2). Together
with the phylogenic data, this finding supports the
hypothesis that related Pti1 kinases could possess similar
biological functions in different plant species.
ZmPti1a encodes a functional protein kinase
Because of its unusually specific expression in pollen, further investigations were focused on the biological function of ZmPti1a. Western analysis of various maize tissues
using a polyclonal antibody raised against bacterially
expressed ZmPti1a detected a protein with the expected
molecular size of 41 kDa in mature pollen (Fig 5A). Faint
bands appeared in extracts from staminate spikelets at
anthesis and pollinated silks after longer exposure times
(data not shown). No such bands could be detected in
other tissues indicating that ZmPti1a protein is specifically expressed in pollen. Hence, protein expression was
shown to correlate well with the abundance of its corresponding mRNA.

To ascertain whether ZmPti1a encodes a functional protein kinase, purified bacterially expressed ZmPti1a protein
fused to a His-Tag was incubated in buffer containing
Mn2+ and radiolabelled ATP. The in vitro kinase assay
revealed ZmPti1a to be capable of autophosphorylation
(Fig 5B ZmPti1a-His). A highly conserved lysine residue
in subdomain II was shown to be necessary for kinase
activity of most protein kinases (Fig. 1A). Replacement of
this lysine with an asparagine (K96N) completely abolished the autophosphorylation of tomato SlPti1 [5].
When the corresponding lysine residue (K100, Fig.1A) of
ZmPti1a was mutated in a similar manner (ZmPti1a-His
K100N), autophosphorylation was also abolished, indicating that ZmPti1a indeed encodes a functional protein
kinase (Fig. 5B) similar to SlPti1.
Tomato SlPti1 can physically interact with and be phosphorylated by SlPto on serine and threonine residues
[5,25]. We hence used bacterially expressed autophosphorylation deficient GST-SlPti1(K96N) and MBP-SlPto as
positive controls in our experiments (Fig. 5B). In addition, we tested the ability of tomato SlPto to phosphorylate maize ZmPti1a in vitro. To distinguish between
autophosphorylation of ZmPti1a and cross-phosphorylation by SlPto, the phosphorylation deficient ZmPti1aHis(K100N) was used as substrate (Fig 5B). MBP-SlPto
could be shown to phosphorylate maize ZmPti1aHis(K100N). We further tested if ZmPti1a-His can crossphosphorylate tomato SlPti1. No significant phosphorylation of GST-SlPti1(K96N) could be detected in this
reaction. These results indicate that maize ZmPti1a can
serve as an in vitro substrate of tomato SlPto but is not able
to cross-phosphorylate SlPti1.

ZmPti1 serves as a substrate for kinase activities from
pollen and silks
To identify upstream kinase activities which use ZmPti1a
as a substrate, magnetocapture protein interaction assays
were performed. Immobilized autophosphorylation deficient mutant ZmPti1a-His(K100N) was incubated with
native protein extracts from pollen, silks and seedlings,
respectively. After removal of unbound proteins by extensive washing, in vitro kinase assays were performed to
detect bound kinase activities capable of phosphorylating
ZmPti1a-His(K100N). ZmPti1a-His(K100N) was phosphorylated by proteins enriched from pollen and silk
extracts but not from seedlings (Fig. 5C). As controls, the
same pull-down experiments were performed using either
autophosphorylation active ZmPTI1a-His protein or an
immobilization matrix that did not contain recombinant
proteins. No radioactively labeled proteins were detected
in the size range of ZmPti1a-His, though silk and seedling
extracts showed increased unspecific protein binding to
the unloaded matrix. Cross-phosphorylation of ZmPti1aHis(K100N) by pollen and silk but not seedling protein
could be verified in direct kinase activity assays without
upstream pull-down purification of interacting proteins.

Auto – and/or cross-phosphorylation of the wild type
ZmPti1a-His was still detectable after pull-down experiments. However, ZmPti1a-His phosphorylation was significantly weaker after incubation with proteins from
pollen and silk extracts but unaltered with seedling proteins. One explanation for the reduced phosphorylation
of ZmPti1a could be the presence of phosphatases or
inhibitors of ZmPti1a autophosphorylation in pollen and
silks extracts.
Our experiments provide evidence that pollen and silks
contain kinases which bind and phosphorylate ZmPti1a
in vitro. No such activities were detected in seedling tissue.
ZmPti1a:GFP co-localizes with callose deposition in pollen
To study the subcellular localization of ZmPti1a in pollen
in vivo, we generated transgenic maize lines ectopically
expressing ZmPti1a:GFP, ΔZmPti1a:GFP and Myr:GFP,
respectively. In each case, pollen was harvested between 8
days before anthesis (dba) and anthesis from at least four
independent transgenic lines. All plants transformed with
a particular construct revealed identical results.

ZmPti1a:GFP and Myr:GFP localize to the pollen plasma
membrane (Fig. 6A, B). whereas ΔZmPti1a:GFP was
present in the cytoplasm and the vegetative nucleus (Fig.
6C) but absent in the generative nucleus of binucleate
developing pollen as well as in sperm cells of trinucleate
mature pollen (Fig. 6I and data not shown). Similar localization patterns were also observed in other tissues of the
respective transgenic lines (data not shown). These results

stain of the blot is given as a control for loading of the gel. A strong band of the expected molecular size of the ZmPti1a protein of approximately 41 kDa is visible in extracts from mature pollen. Faint bands could be detected in protein of staminate
spikelets at anthesis (0 dba) and pollinated silks after extended exposure times. (B) Autophosphorylation and cross-phosphorylation of ZmPti1a. Wild type ZmPti1a-His fusion protein, wild type MBP-SlPto, and the kinase-deficient mutants ZmPti1aHis(K100N) and GST-SlPti1(K96N) were over-expressed and purified in equal amounts from E. coli, using Ni-NTA magnetic
beads, GST-Bind-Resin or amylose resin, respectively. Immobilized proteins were incubated alone or in pairs with [γ-32P]ATP in
kinase buffer, separated by PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. Cross-phosphorylation of GST-SlPti1(K96N) by MBP-SlPto
served as positive control. ZmPti1a is capable of autophosphorylation. The K100N mutation completely abolished autophosphorylation of ZmPti1a. ZmPti1a-His(K100N) is moderately phosphorylated by MBP-SlPto whereas ZmPti1a-His cannot phosphorylate GST-SlPti1. (C) Magnetocapture interaction kinase assay. Wild type ZmPti1a-His or mutant ZmPti1a-His(K100N)
was immobilized on Ni-NTA magnetic beads and incubated with native protein extracts from pollen, silks or seedlings. ZmPti1
and bound proteins were collected by magnetic force, washed and subjected to kinase assays. Unloaded Ni-NTA magnetic
beads were used as control. Proteins were separated by PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. Pollen and silk but not seedling
extracts contained kinase activities capable of interaction with and cross-phosphorylating ZmPti1a-His(K100N).

are consistent with the transient localization studies in
onion epidermal cells. However, ZmPTI1a-GFP was not
evenly distributed over the plasma membrane but accumulated in a specific region of the pollen. This pattern was
confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (data
not shown) and was found to be present in pollen analyzed from all plants of the four independent transgenic
lines. The pollen from plants over-expressing the Myr-GFP
construct showed the same pattern as seen with the
ZmPTI1a-GFP construct, however to a much weaker
extent with a more even distribution of the protein. This
indicated that the myristoylation signal along with the
additional amino acids at the N-terminus can somewhat
trigger this phenomenon. However, the entire ZmPTI1a
protein seems to be essential for strong protein accumulation in a specific region of the pollen. A more detailed
study of the morphology of this uneven localization of
ZmPTI1a-GFP revealed that ZmPTI1a-GFP accumulation
is closely associated with the pollen aperture (pore). GFP
fluorescence was observed below the intine surface as an
annulus-ring structure which has a stronger fluorescence
in the inner ring of the annulus (Fig. 6D, E). It appeared
to be localized either adjacent to or surrounding the pollen pore, the former case being more predominantly
observed. The position of the adjacent annulus was found
to be highly conserved at a 45° angle with respect to the
pollen pore.
In search for an explanation of this pattern, we investigated the possibility of ZmPti1a:GFP being associated
with (1,3)-β-glucan (callose) by conducting co-localization studies with aniline blue stained transgenic pollen.
ZmPti1a:GFP pollen stained for callose showed a clear colocalization of callose and GFP with the same intensity
pattern, i.e. having stronger fluorescence in the inner ring
of the annulus (Fig. 6G). There was no co-localization of
GFP with the callose plug present in the center of the pollen aperture (Fig. 6G). Identical (1,3)-β-glucan annulusring structures were observed in pollen from several wild
type lines proving that the ring structure is not an artifact
because of ectopic ZmPti1a:GFP expression (Fig. 6J and
data not shown). Some pollen showed distinct GFP localization in granules, plates and rings which also co-localized with (1,3)-β-glucan (Fig. 6H).
Transgenic ZmPti1a:GFP pollen germinated on silks as
well as on PGM. In germinating transgenic pollen the
fusion protein was still sequestered at the plasma membrane adjacent to the pore with only a marginal fluorescence observed in the elongating tube. However, in rare
cases, stronger fluorescence signals appeared in the pollen
tube bordering callose plugs (Fig. 6K). Plugs are regularly
produced behind the tip as tubes elongate to isolate the
cytoplasmic contents of the tube from the now empty pollen grain (Fig. 6L).

ZmPti1a:GFP co-localizes with callose during pollen
mitosis I
Various stages of pollen development were studied to further investigate the co-localization of callose and
ZmPti1a:GFP.

The first indication of cell plate deposition in the equatorial region of the phragmoplast appeared soon after telophase during pollen mitosis I (PMI), taking the normal
formation of a flattened aggregate of unit-membrane
bounded vesicles. From the earliest presence of these vesicles, the equatorial zone reveals callose fluorescence. This
is called the "Pre-callose stage". Thereafter, the equatorial
zone continued to spread at the margins, following the
out-spreading phragmoplast, until it forms a complete
hemisphere. After the cell-plate formation, callose forms
an arch-shaped layer which gradually reached the pollen
wall, thus completely separating the generative nucleus
from the vegetative nucleus (Fig. 7 stage I; A, B). During
the time interval when the generative cell abuts against the
wall, callose occurs at the boundary of the cell, however,
only on the side adjacent to the vegetative cell. This is
called the "Callose stage" (Fig. 7B; [26,27]). Following
this stage, a rather compact callose stage is observed which
is further defining this cell-cell boundary (Fig. 7 stage II;
D, E). Soon after, the generative cell gradually changes
from a lens-like to a spherical shape and moves towards
the centre of the pollen grain (Fig. 7 stage III; G, H). This
is the "Circular shaped prophase generative nucleus with
nucleolus stage". In the "Spindle shaped prophase generative nucleus with nucleolus stage" it becomes spindle
shaped (Fig. 7 stage IV; J, K) following the disappearance
of callose [26,27]. In the case of maize, the generative cell
immediately undergoes a second mitotic division which
produces two sperm cells resulting in trinucleate mature
pollen.
ZmPTI1a-GFP fusion protein was found to co-localize
with (1,3)-β-glucan in association with the generative cell
until the end of stage IV. When callose disappeared after
the end of stage IV, neither the generative cell nor the two
sperm cells during further pollen maturation were
encased by ZmPti1a:GFP fluorescence. However, the
fusion protein was present as the previously described
annulus-ring structure adjacent to the pore. It appears that
the annulus-ring structure may be associated with a similar structure from previous observations of (1,3)-β-glucan
staining during pollen germination [28,29]. However, in
our study this structure appeared at all studied stages of
pollen development, with increasing intensity during
maturation of the pollen grain.

Knock down of ZmPti1a reduces male specific
transmission of the transgene
To decipher the biological function of ZmPti1a during
pollen development and/or germination, a targeted RNA
interference (RNAi) gene silencing approach was utilized.
Transgenic plants were obtained by biolistic transformation of embryogenic calli and subsequent plant regeneration using the co-transformed phosphinothrycin (PPT)
resistance gene pat as a selection marker. Fifteen out of 20
regenerated primary T0 plants carried the RNAi construct.
Southern analyses showed that these plants corresponded
to 9 independent clonal lines. Each line contained multicopy integrations of the RNAi construct. Southern studies
comprising of T0 plants and segregating individuals of
three subsequent generations indicated that the line specific integration patterns of the transgene were inherited
as a single genomic locus (data not shown). Northern
analyses with leaf and pollen RNA using a transgene-specific probe confirmed expression of the RNAi construct in
all lines (data not shown).

The T0 plants were reciprocally crossed with the wild type
line A188. It was observed in initial experiments that the
RNAi transgene was not transmitted in the expected Mendelian ratio. In order to score for competitive ability of
RNAi transgenic pollen, 234 offspring plants were assayed
for PPT-resistance. Co-segregation of RNAi and PPT transgenes was confirmed by Southern analyses of 77 PPTresistant T1 individuals.
When transgenic plants were pollinated with wild type
pollen, 48% of the T1 progeny showed PPT-resistence and
carried the RNAi transgene, respectively (Fig. 8A; T0 × WT).
Such an apparent 1:1 segregation is expected for a single
locus inheritance. When wild type plants were pollinated
with pollen of transgenic T0 lines, only 20% of the T1 progeny was transgenic (Fig. 8A T0 × WT). Since abnormal segregation was only observed with transgenic pollen, the
result implied that the transgene was transmitted normally through the female but at a lower frequency
through the male.
To confirm the RNAi effect on ZmPti1a expression, T1
plants were subjected to Northern and Western analysis.
ZmPti1a transcript and protein levels were reduced to
approximately 50% in all analyzed transgenic plants (Fig
9A, B). This finding is in agreement with the heterozygous
RNAi genotype of the transgenic T1 siblings. Accordingly,
non-transgenic individuals of the segregating T1 lines
showed normal ZmPti1a expression (Fig. 9A, B; #10 × WT,
WT × #6).
In order to further score transgene transmission, T1 plants
were selfed and their progeny (T2) was analyzed for PPTresistence. T2 plants showed apparent 1:1 segregation (Fig.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

8B) which differed clearly from the expected 3:1 Mendelian segregation and further supported an impaired competitive ability of transgenic RNAi pollen. Hence,
reciprocal crosses between transgenic and wild type plants
were repeated with 8 different heterozygous transgenic T2
plants. Segregation analysis of 254 T3 siblings showed
only 33% transgene transmission for the cross WT × T2 but
52% for the cross T2 × WT. This result confirmed a male
specific reduction of transgene transmission (Fig. 8C).
To check for the existence of homozygous RNAi lines, T2
plants were screened by Northern analysis using pollen
RNA. Several individuals could be identified in which
ZmPti1a expression was reduced to undetectable levels
(Fig. 8C; #2 and #5; and data not shown). After selfing
these plants, the corresponding T3 progeny did not segregate and ZmPTI1a protein was decreased to undetectable
levels in pollen (Fig. 9D), indicating the successful establishment of homozygous RNAi lines with a silenced
ZmPti1a gene. Homozygous RNAi plants did not show
any visible mutant phenotype. Since homozygous RNAi
lines could be generated and propagated, knock down of
ZmPti1a did not result in male sterility. Accordingly, RNAi
pollen was able to germinate and did not show reduced
pollen tube growth rates in vitro (data not shown).
Because ZmPti1a was found to be associated with callose
deposition, pollen from heterozygous and homozygous
T2 RNAi plants was stained for (1,3)-β-glucan. Microscopic examination did not reveal significantly altered callose patterns. Relative (1,3)-β-glucan amounts were
assayed in pollen of ca. 100 T0 to T3 plants and of wild type
lines A188 and H99 modified according to Köhle et al.
[30]. However, the analysis did not result in statistically
significant differences between wild type and homo- or
heterozygotic RNAi pollen, mainly due to a generally high
variation in callose content. Taken together, knock down
of ZmPti1a expression did not result in a visible pollen
defect. However, crossing studies indicated that ZmPti1a
expression provides a significant competitive advantage to
the male gametophyte and demonstrated ZmPti1a to be
an important component for maize reproduction.

Discussion
ZmPti1a, -b, -c and -d are the first ZmPti1-like kinases in
a monocotyledonous species to be characterized at the
molecular level. Although ZmPti1 kinases from maize do
not display high similarity at the nucleotide sequence
level, the translated protein sequences are well conserved
and the kinase domains maintain all functionally important residues. Accordingly, ZmPti1a was proven to encode
a functional kinase capable of autophosphorylation and
to be an in vitro target of kinase activities present in pollen
and silk tissue. The presence of several Pti1-like kinases in
maize is consistent with the observations of Pti1-genes
belonging to a gene family in tomato [4] and three Pti1-

Genetic segregation analyses of transgenic ZmPti1a-RNAi plants. (A) T0 plants expressing a ZmPti1a directed RNAi
construct were crossed reciprocally to wild type A188. Transmission of the RNAi transgene was scored in T1 siblings of each
line as a percentage of 'transgenic PPT-resistant plants' to 'PPT-sensitive plants'. The progeny of wild type plants pollinated with

transgenic plants were reciprocally crossed to wild type A188. Marker transmission was scored as described. Only the T3 progeny of wild type plants pollinated with pollen of transgenic plants showed a difference from a 1:1 segregation ratio. Marker
transmission was significantly lowered to 33%.

related genes identified in Glycine max [8]. Phylogenetic
analysis revealed a wide diversity of Pti1 homologues in
the plant kingdom, appearing to segregate into three subfamilies mainly based on different N-terminal sequences
of the kinases. These sequence regions were not only specific to the maize Pti1-kinases but were also highly conserved
in
putative
Pti1
kinases
of
other
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. This
gives rise to the conclusion that conserved N-termini in
different Pti1 sub-families are evolutionary conserved
indicating the functional relevance of this protein domain

for proper biological function. Accordingly, studies with
GFP fusions suggest that the variable N-termini are critical
for different targeting properties of the four maize Pti1
kinases.
ZmPti1a contains an N-terminal putative myristoylation
motif essential for plasma membrane targeting. N-myristoylation is known to confer reversible membrane association by enhancement of hydrophobic membraneprotein interactions. Such membrane associations are
known to be further stabilized by reversible S-palmitoyla-

tion of Cys residues on positions 3 to 5 [31]. N-terminal
Gly2 and S-palmitoylation at Cys4 and Cys5 of OsCPK2
has been shown to occur in vivo in maize leaf protoplasts
with both acylations contributing to full membrane association [32]. ZmPti1a contains Cys residues in position 3,
6 and 7. Hence, it is likely that these motifs are subjects of
fatty acylation and are necessary for proper plasma membrane targeting. Indeed, site-directed mutagenesis of the
corresponding residues partially abolished plasma membrane targeting of ZmPti1a:GFP.
Interestingly, dual S-acylation was shown to influence
protein compartmentalization to specialized plasmalemmal microdomains [33-35]. It is tempting to speculate
that microdomain association is also responsible for the
unequal distribution of ZmPti1a in the pollen plasma
membrane.

N-terminal myristoylation is not only required for membrane targeting but could also participate in intra- or intermolecular interactions with proteins [31,33]. For
instance, intermolecular myristate-protein interactions
were shown to facilitate interaction between calmodulin
and several proteins [36-38]. Therefore, ZmPti1a plasma
membrane targeting could also be achieved indirectly by
interacting proteins. Evidence for ZmPti1a interacting
proteins is provided by the magnetocapture interaction
assays which suggested the existence of ZmPti1a phosphorylating kinases that bind and phosphorylate ZmPti1a
in vitro.
Mutation of single amino acids which are putatively relevant for myristoylation or acylation results in partial
nuclear location of ZmPti1a. Partial nuclear targeting was
also observed for ZmPti1b and SlPti1. In both proteins

Gly2 is naturally substituted by Ser2. Chehab et al. [39]
demonstrated that the N-terminally myristoylated calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) McCPK1 from
Mesembrynathemum chrystallinum undergoes a reversible
change in subcellular localization from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and actin
microfilaments in response to reduction in humidity. Proteins of the CDPK family also contain variable N-termini
and exhibit diverse subcellular localization patterns
which reflect their participation in a variety of signaling
pathways including HR [40,41]. Reversible translocation
and activity-dependent localization was also shown for
other myristoylated proteins e.g. for the calcium-myristoyl switch proteins VILIP1 and VILIP3 in neurons and the
flagellar calcium-binding protein FCaBP in Trypanosoma
cruzi [42,43]. Thus, it will be of profound interest to investigate if ZmPti1a can respond to specific signals by changing its subcellular localization and if putative downstream
targets of ZmPti1a signaling reside inside the vegetative
nucleus of pollen.
ZmPti1c and ZmPti1d did not contain myristoylation signals but conserved N-terminal pairs of arginine residues.
GFP fusions of these sub-group III Pti1 proteins showed
neither membrane nor nuclear targeting. This is in agreement with studies showing that arginine residues favor
cytoplasmic displacement and reduce protein-lipid or
protein-protein interactions [44].
ZmPti1a co-localizes with plasma membrane regions
responsible for callose deposition during pollen development and tube growth. Callose is a (1,3)-β-glucan with
some 1,6 branches which not only is the major component of the pollen grain and pollen-tube wall but also
plays a key role in pollen viability. Callose is deposited in
the inner wall layer behind the growing pollen tube tip as
well as in regularly formed plugs inside the pollen-tube.
Callose is not specific to the male gametophyte but widely
distributed among various cells and tissues. In sporophytic tissue, synthesis of callose is evidently achieved via
a plasma membrane bound multi-subunit enzyme that is
usually activated temporally by specific signals such as
wounding, infection or other stress. Twelve callose synthase (CalS) isoenzymes have been identified in Arabidopis and each may be tissue-specific and/or regulated
under different physiological conditions [45]. Putative
regulatory subunits of the CalS complex are ROP1
GTPase, UGT1, annexin-like proteins (ANN) and sucrose
synthase [45]. However, subunit composition and regulation of CalS complexes is far from being understood.
Remarkably, Arthur et al. [18] showed that ROP2, one of
9 known ROP GTPases from maize, also provides a competitive advantage to the male gametophyte. Heterozygous rop2::Mu mutants show a reduced transgene
transmission by pollen similarly to what was observed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

with ZmPti1a RNAi plants. Although there is no experimental evidence yet, a biological link between ROP
GTPases, CalS complexes and ZmPti1a may be speculated
for pollen.
In accordance with the presence of multiple CalS complexes in plants, callose deposition is not only known to
be involved in pollen development, pollen-tube growth
and self-incompatibility but also in cytokinesis and pathogen defence. For instance, hypersensitive cell death
induced in plants thwarts further advance of the pathogen
is seen to correlate with callose deposition at and around
the site of HR. This strengthens the cell wall to attenuate
pathogen invasion [46]. In tomato, SlPto and SlPti1 were
shown to be involved in gene-for-gene resistance against
Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strains. Based on protein
similarity and subcellular localization ZmPti1b was identified as a likely functional ortholog of SlPti1 in maize. A
putative function of ZmPti1b in pathogene defense was
supported by the observed induction of ZmPti1b transcript in Fusarium spec. infected kernels.
The diversity of callose function exemplified increasing
evidence that plant responses such as male fertility, selfincompatibility, pathogenesis, symbiosis and wounding
are based on highly related molecules and have evolutionary conserved signalling mechanisms [1-3]. Our analyses
of Pti1 kinases from maize support this model and suggested Pti kinases as conserved components of these different but related signal cascades in plants. Current
studies are aimed at further elucidating the function of
ZmPti1 genes in maize and in the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana.

Conclusion
In this study we cloned and characterized four novel Pti1
kinases from maize. Expression patterns and subcellular
targeting of the proteins were investigated. ZmPti1a
encodes a functional serine/threonine kinase specific to
pollen and is associated with plasma membrane regions
responsible for callose deposition. ZmPti1a expression
provides a competitive advantage to pollen. Thus its activity seems to be important for the proper biological function of pollen. In contrast, ZmPti1b is likely to be
involved in maize pathogen responses. Considering the
fact that pollen-sporophyte interaction and pathogen
induced HR show certain similarities e.g. callose deposition and Ca2+ influx, members of the Pti1 kinase family
are hypothesized to act as general components in evolutionary conserved signalling processes during different
developmental programs and in different tissue types.

Methods
Plant material and cultivation conditions
The maize lines used in this study were inbred lines LC (a
color converted W22 line), A188, H99, and a flavonoldeficient conditionally male-sterile line "white pollen"
(genotype: whp/whp, c2/c2; [22]) and its corresponding
fertile wild type line (whp/whp, C2/C2 or whp/whp, C2/c2).
Plants were grown in a green house with 16 h of light at
24°C and a relative humidity of 55% to 95%. Controlled
pollination was achieved by the use of standard breeding
procedures.

For expression analyses different maize tissue types were
harvested as described previously [47].
Maize pollen used for microscopic studies was collected at
different stages of development. Early samples representing a mixture of unicellular microspores and bicellular
immature pollen were harvested from anthers 6 to 8 dba
before their emergence from the flag leaf. A mixture of
immature and mature pollen was harvested between 2
dba and anthesis. Mature pollen was harvested at the pollen shading stage.
In vitro germination of pollen
Fresh pollen was harvested between 11 and 12 a.m. and
was germinated according to [48]. 30–50 mg pollen was
germinated in 1 to 2 ml of liquid pollen germination
medium (1 × PGM) in 35 mm petri dishes. Germination
was monitored by light microscopy. For RNA or protein
extraction germinating pollen was harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C until
use.
Aniline blue staining of maize pollen
Maize pollen was stained with 1% Aniline blue (Merck,
Darmstadt) which was prepared in 0.07 M Na2HPO4 pH
8.5 (modified according to [49]). The samples were
excited with UV light produced by an HBO 50 W/Ac lamp
using a filter set (excitation BP 365/12, FT395 chromatic
beam splitter and emission LP 397 nm). For documentation of the results an Olympus C4040 zoom digital camera was used. An AxioCam MRc5 camera (Zeiss, Germany)
and software packages AxioVS40AC V 4.1.1.0 and ImageJ
1.34n [50] were used for digital imaging.
ZmPti1 cDNA isolation
To obtain a full-length ZmPti1 cDNA clone, a lambda
cDNA library was generated from mRNA of 10 min in vitro
germinated fertile whp pollen (whp/whp, C2/C2 or whp/
whp, C2/c2) using the SMART™cDNA Library construction
kit (BD Biosciences). Library construction was performed
as described in the manufacturer's manual. Amplified
cDNAs were ligated into SfiI restricted λ TriplEx2™ vector
and packed with Gigapack® III Gold Packaging Extract

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

(Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Plaque screening was
achieved using standard procedures using a Digoxigeninlabeled partial ZmPti1a-cDNA fragment of 217 bp as a
probe. cDNA inserts of positive clones were converted
into plasmids by Cre/lox mediated recombination into
BM25.8 E. coli cells according to the SMART™cDNA
Library construction manual (BD Biosciences).
3'-UTRs of ZmPti1b, -c and -d were amplified by PCR using
gene specific primer pairs; SP2 (5'-atgcgcgggcgactaaccctggagaacatg-3') and SP3 (5'-ccgagcctggaggcattctgttcaga-3')
for ZmPti1b; SP7(5'-cgcaaccaccggcagccactactgacgcta-3')
and SP8 (5'-taataaggtggtcacgaccgctg-3') for ZmPti1c; SP12
(5'-ctgcaccaaccaccgaagagccagctcca-3') and SP13 (5'-aacttcgaaccaacttcatataccatt-3') for ZmPti1d; and λ-ZAP® II
cDNA-libraries prepared from kernels and seedlings of
line LC, respectively [51]. Corresponding ORF sequences
were amplified by RT-PCR from mRNA of developing kernels from the line A188. The primers used were: SP4 (5'acagatctatgtcgtgctttgcgtgc-3') and SP5 (5'-gcagatctgacccagcatgttctcc-3') for ZmPti1b; SP9 (5'-gtagatctatgcgccggtggttttgc-3') and SP10 (5'-agagatctgcatctgacggtgctgt-3') for
ZmPti1c and SP14 (5'-atagatctatgaggcggtggttatgt-3') and
SP15 (5'-agagatctctcccaggttgtgg-3') for ZmPti1d.
ZmPti1a gene isolation
A λ Fix® II genomic library of the inbred line LC [51] was
plated and screened following standard protocols by
using a ZmPti1a-3'UTR probe generated by PCR with
primers PRMMH53 (5'-tgtgatttctcatcgctgcg-3') and
PRMMH52 (5'-cggaagccaacgctgcattttcgc-3'). λ-DNA was
isolated from phages of interest according to [52]. Southern analysis with different ZmPti1 cDNA probes indicated
that one of the phage clones contained the complete
ZmPti1a gene. For sequencing, a 1.4 kb PstI fragment of
the ZmPti1a ORF was cloned into pBluescript KS-. Three
additional fragments spanning the entire transcribed
region of the gene were amplified with primer pairs
PRMMH52 and PRMM55 (5'-ggagtcgcatatgggatgcttttcatgctg-3'), PRMMH53 and T3 (5'-attaaccctcactaaag-3') and
PRMMH85 (5'-ccgcgaggcattctgaaatcg-3') and PRMMH70
(5'-gtggtactagcaagcatgataa-3'), respectively. All three fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and sequenced. 3.0 kb of the ZmPti1a
promoter were amplified from a 4.1 kb PstI fragment of
the isolated λ-phage by inverse PCR according to [53]
with the primers PRMMH62 (5'-atggccgactccctaacct-3')
and PRMMH75 (5'-acaaaaagggcttcctgtgc-3').
Sequence analysis
Sequencing and bioinformatics were performed as
described previously [47]. The myristoylation pattern was
identified with the Plant Specific Myristoylation Predictor
software [54].

Northern blot analysis
Total RNA from maize tissue was isolated and blotted as
described previously [47]. As a control for equal RNA
loading, blots were stained with 0.05% methylene blue;
0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0) for ten minutes and
destained in deionized water. 32P-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol)labeled probes were generated with the Prime It® II DNA
labeling kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and
hybridized under stringent conditions [47].
Cloning of a ZmPti1a-RNAi construct
Expression of the ZmPti1a-RNAi transcript was performed
under the control of the ubiquitin-1 promoter (Ubi-1)
from rice and the terminator of the nopalin synthase gene
(nos) in the pUbi.cas plasmid [55]. An EcoRI PCR product
(c2i) of the c2 gene [56] which contained 16 bp of the 3'
border of exon 1, the entire intron 1, and 39 bp of the 5'
border of exon 2 was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescriptKS- (pBS; Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Two
fragments (RNAi-5' and RNAi-3') of the 5'-region of the
ZmPti1a ORF were amplified in reverse complement orientation to each other with the primer pairs PRMMH65
(5'-tagggaggtcgacatgggatgcttttcatgctgc-3') and PRMMH66
(5'-ggagtcaggatccttcactgcagatttcgtccc-3') or PRMMH67 (5'tagggagggtaccatgggatgcttttcatgctgc-3') and PRMMH68 (5'ggagtcaagcttcttcactgcagatttcgtccc-3'), respectively. Both
primer pairs amplified appropriate restriction sites at the
ends of the fragments. Products were cloned into pCR2.1TOPO plasmids. RNAi-3' was digested with KpnI and HindIII and was inserted 3' behind c2i into the KpnI/HindIII
site of pBS. A KpnI/Asp718 restriction fragment of this
clone containing both c2i and PTGS-3' was integrated in
the KpnI/Asp718 site of Ubi.cas between Ubi-1 and nos.
Subsequently, the RNAi-5' fragment was excised from the
pCR2.1-TOPO with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI
site of the ZmPti1a-RNAi construct.
Cloning of GFP fusion constructs
A modified GFP expression construct (pUbi:GFP) was
cloned based on the pMon30049 vector [57]. The coding
sequence of GFP was amplified with primers GFP-for (5'tacggatccaggagcaaccatgggc-3') and GFP-rev (5'-tgcgaattctcagccatgcgtgatcccagc-3') with pMon30049 as template.
Primer GFP-rev shortened the C-terminus of GFP by six
amino acids [MDELYK], introducing a new stop codon
and an EcoRI site. The coding sequence of GFP was excised
from pMon30049 with BamHI/EcoRI and was replaced
with the BamHI/EcoRI restricted GFP fragment. The 1.5 kb
CaMV35S promoter of pMon30049 was excised with HindIII/BamHI and replaced by the 1.5 kb Ubi-1 promoter
that was cut with HindIII and BamHI from pUbi.cas.

The coding sequence of ZmPti1a was amplified with primers JK3 (5'-tactggatccatgggatgcttttcatgctg-3') and JK4 (5'tcctggatccagtccggatcgctcggcag-3') using ZmPti1 cDNA as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

template. Both primers amplified BamHI sites at the N –
and C-termini of the protein. The PCR product was ligated
in-frame into the BamHI linearized pUbi:GFP leading to
the ZmPti1a:GFP construct. In order to remove N-terminal 20 amino acids of ZmPti1a, Δ ZmPti1a:GFP was
cloned similarly, with the exception that the primers JK9
(5'-tactggatccatggacgatccctatgttcctatc-3') and JK4 were
used for amplification. GFP fusion constructs of ZmPti1b,
-c and -d were cloned similarly by using specific primer
pairs which generated BamHI compatible BglII restriction
sites.
Myr:GFP was cloned by in vitro annealing of oligonucleotides Myr-A (5'-P-gatccatgggatgcttttcatgctgctgtgtggcagatgacgacaacgttggcaggaggaagaagcat-3') and Myr-B (5'-Pgatcatgcttcttcctcctgccaacgttgtcgtcatctgccacacagcagcatgaaaagcatcccatg-3') and ligation of the resulting double
stranded DNA into BamHI linearized pUbi:GFP.
ZmPti1a:GFP mutant constructs were generated by sitedirected mutagenesis using primer JK3 in combination
with one of the following primers: D1 (5'-gagggatccatggcatgcttttcatgctgc-3'), D2 (5'-gagggatccatgggagccttttcatgctgc-3'), D3 (5'-gagggatccatgggagccttttcagcctgctg-3'), D4
(5'-gagggatccatgggatgcttttcagccgcctgtgtgg-3') and D5 (5'gagggatccatggcagccttttcatgctgc-3'). PCR fragments were
cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, subcloned into BamHI linearized pUbi:GFP and sequenced. The SlPti1(K96N):GFP
fusion was cloned accordingly with primers JK10 (5'-tactggatccatggcacacaattcagcaggcaac-3') and JK11(5'-tcctggatcccttggtacaggtcgaggcaacag-3') and with GST-SlPti(K96N)
[5] as template. GFP fusions of ZmPti1b and c were
cloned in the same way.
Expression and purification of fusion proteins
For protein expression in bacteria, the ZmPti1a kinase and
its mutagenized autophosphorylation-deficient form
ZmPti1a(K100N) were fused in frame with 6× histidine
tags (His) at their C-terminal ends: The ORF of ZmPti1a
was amplified with PRMMH55 (5'-ggagtcgcatatgggatgcttttcatgctg-3') and PRMMH64 (5'-gcgatggcggccgccagtccggatcgctcggcagc-3'), digested with NdeI and NotI and
inserted in the corresponding sites of linearized pET30a
plasmid (Novagen/Merck Biosciences, Germany). To
obtain the ZmPti1a-His(K100N) construct, the K100N
mutation was introduced by amplification of the 5' end of
ZmPti1a with primers PRMMH55 and PRMMH84 (5'ctggagtcaagcttgttcactgcagatttcgtccc-3'). A NdeI/HindIII
fragment was cut from the ZmPti1a-His construct and was
replaced by the NdeI/HindIII digested ZmPti1a(K100N)
PCR product.

Plasmids ZmPti1a-His, ZmPti1a-His(K100N), MBP-SlPto
[25], and GST-SlPti1(K96N) [5] were transformed into E.
coli Rosetta(DE3) (Novagen/Merck Biosciences, Schwalbach, Germany) and expression of the fusion proteins was

induced by adding isopropyl β-thiogalactoside to a final
concentration of 1 mM and incubation for 3 h at 28°C.
Batch purification of the recombinant proteins under
denaturing conditions was achieved by binding to NiNTA agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 0.5 g bacteria were harvested in 2.5 ml lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100
mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The solution was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and the supernatant
was incubated with 150 μl of Ni-NTA agarose resin for 1.5
h at 4°C. The resin was collected by centrifugation and
was washed four times with washing buffer (8 M urea, 100
mM NaH2PO4, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.3). The fusion
protein was eluted with washing buffer plus 100 mM
EDTA. 350 mg recombinant protein was used by Biogenes
(Berlin, Germany) for rabbit immunization to generate a
ZmPti1a specific polyclonal antibody. Specificity and
working concentrations of the polyclonal Anti-ZmPti1a
antibody serum was determined empirically with recombinant ZmPti1a-His.
For kinase assays, recombinant proteins were purified
under native conditions: Bacteria expressing ZmPti1a-His
and ZmPti1a-His(K100N) were harvested in His-lysis
buffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM Phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride
(PMSF), 0.05% (v/v) Tween® 20, 200 μg lysozyme, 50 mM
NaH2PO4, pH 8.0), incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated. Solubilized protein was cleared by centrifugation
and incubated with Ni-NTA magnetic beads (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were separated by
magnetic force and were washed thrice with washing
buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 0.05% (v/v) Tween® 20, 50
mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0).
Induction of MBP-SlPto expression and purification of
recombinant protein by binding to amylose resin (New
England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) was performed
according to [58] with modifications. Cells were lysed for
30 min at 4°C in MBP-buffer (200 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 200 μg
lysozyme, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and sonicated. The
cleared lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with amylose
resin and the resin was washed thrice with MBP-buffer.
Purification of recombinant GST-SlPti1(K96N) was done
as described for MBP-SlPto with the exception that GSTbuffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
PMSF 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.3, 1.47 mM KH2PO4) and
GST-Bind-Resin (Novagen/Merck Biosciences, Schwalbach, Germany) were used.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/22

Plant protein extraction and immunoblot analysis
Frozen tissues were ground in a MM301 ball mill (Retsch,
Haan, Germany) and proteins were solubilized for 1 h at
4°C in 1 volume extraction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM
EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM PMSF, 1% (v/v)
Triton® 100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Protein extract was
cleared by centrifugation (10 min, 4°C, 10,000 × g) and
the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using Bradford reagent. For protein extraction from
pollen the volume of extraction buffer was increased and
2.5 U/ml Benzonase® Nuclease (Novagen/Merck Biosciences) were added to the buffer. Protein extracts of germinating pollen were concentrated on Centricon 10
(Amicon, Bevely, USA) spin columns.

Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE with NuPAGE®
Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according
to the supplier's manual and transferred onto ECL-Nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg)
by electroblotting. Immunodetection was performed
using standard ECL system procedures (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg).
Kinase assay
Kinase assays were performed with recombinant proteins
bound to resins or magnetic beads according to [58] with
modifications. Proteins were incubated in kinase assay
buffer (10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MnCl2, 20 μM
ATP, 10 μCi γ-[32P]-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.0) for 20 min at 25°C and washed twice in 300
mM NaCl, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Tween® 20,
50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). Proteins were eluted with SDScontaining loading buffer at 85°C for 5 min and separated
by SDS-PAGE. Gels were washed twice in running buffer,
dried (Gel Drying System 583, Bio-Rad Laboratories,
München, Germany) and subjected to autoradiography.

For magnetocapture protein interaction assays, purified
recombinant protein bound to magnetic beads was
washed and equilibrated in interaction buffer (300 mM
NaCl, 20 mM imidazol, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
PMSF, 0.05% (v/v) Tween® 20, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0)
and incubated with 40 μg native plant protein at 4°C for
1 h under agitation. After extensive washing of bound protein with interaction buffer, remaining protein was used
in the kinase activitiy assays as aforementioned.
Transient transformation of plant tissue
Pollen was harvested at anthesis and was germinated on 1
× PGM supplemented with 0.3% (w/v) agar (Duchefa,
Haarlem, The Netherlands). Bulbs of Allium fistulosum L.
or Allium cepa L. were sliced into quarters, innermost peels
were removed and the inner sides of the quarters were
used for biolistic transformation.

3 μg of plasmid DNA were precipitated on 1.25 mg/25 μl
gold particles (0.3 – 3.0 μm Chempur, Karlsruhe, Germany), by adding 10 μL 0.1 M spermidine and 25 μL 2.5
M CaCl2. The precipitated DNA was washed once with
ethanol and resuspended in 65 μL ethanol. 10 μl of this
solution was spread on the macrocarrier for each bombardment. Biolistic transformation was performed with a
particle gun, PDS-1000/He (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany)
as described previously [59]. A partial vacuum of 98 kPa
and a gas pressure of either 10.7 MPa (1550 psi) for pollen
or 7.6 MPa (1100 psi) for onion epidermis was used for
bombardment. Fluorescence microscopy of GFP expressing pollen or onion cells was carried out after over night
incubation at 20°C using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop, Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a HBO 50 UV
lamp using a filter set (excitation BP450-490 nm, FT 510
chromatic beam splitter, and emission LP 520 nm). Digital image capturing was performed as described for aniline blue staining.

transformed embryogenic calli of a cross between A188 ×
H99 as described previously [59]. For selection of transgenic lines a 35S:pat construct expressing the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase was co-transformed. pat gene
expression in segregating seedlings was monitored by
spraying with aqueous solution of 250 mg/l phosphinothricin and 0.1% (v/v) Tween® 20.
