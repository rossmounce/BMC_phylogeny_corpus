Codon usage bias and the evolution of influenza
A viruses. Codon Usage Biases of Influenza Virus
Emily HM Wong1, David K Smith2*, Raul Rabadan3, Malik Peiris1, Leo LM Poon1*

Abstract
Background: The influenza A virus is an important infectious cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and was
responsible for 3 pandemics in the 20th century. As the replication of the influenza virus is based on its host’s
machinery, codon usage of its viral genes might be subject to host selection pressures, especially after interspecies
transmission. A better understanding of viral evolution and host adaptive responses might help control this
disease.
Results: Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) values of the genes from segment 1 to segment 6 of avian
and human influenza viruses, including pandemic H1N1, were studied via Correspondence Analysis (CA). The
codon usage patterns of seasonal human influenza viruses were distinct among their subtypes and different from
those of avian viruses. Newly isolated viruses could be added to the CA results, creating a tool to investigate the
host origin and evolution of viral genes. It was found that the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus contained genes with
mammalian-like viral codon usage patterns, indicating that the introduction of this virus to humans was not
through in toto transfer of an avian influenza virus.
Many human viral genes had directional changes in codon usage over time of viral isolation, indicating the effect
of host selection pressures. These changes reduced the overall GC content and the usage of G at the third codon
position in the viral genome. Limited evidence of translational selection pressure was found in a few viral genes.
Conclusions: Codon usage patterns from CA allowed identification of host origin and evolutionary trends in
influenza viruses, providing an alternative method and a tool to understand the evolution of influenza viruses.
Human influenza viruses are subject to selection pressure on codon usage which might assist in understanding the
characteristics of newly emerging viruses.

Background
Influenza has been one of the most important infectious
diseases of humans. It poses a threat to health and
causes significant negative economic impacts on society
every year. The last century saw 3 influenza A pandemics: H1N1 in 1918, H2N2 in 1957 and H3N2 in
1968 [1,2]. Since 1997 avian H5N1 influenza has been
infecting humans zoonotically resulting in a high mortality rate [3] and there were fears it might cause the
first pandemic of this century. However, the influenza
pandemic of 2009 was caused by an H1N1 multiple
reassortant with genes derived from viruses that

originally circulated in the swine, avian and human
populations [4,5].
In order to evade the host immune response, human
seasonal influenza virus changes its antigenicity by
introducing novel mutations in its surface proteins
(called antigenic drift) [6]. The influenza pandemics in
the last century were caused through antigenic shift,
which occurs when there is a reassortment of the surface protein segments between viruses, resulting in a
virus that was immunologically novel to humans [7]. It
has been observed that the influenza virus is subject to
host immune selection pressure and undergoes rapid
evolution in the antigenic regions, especially when the
virus crosses the host species barrier [8]. To better prepare for future pandemics, a detailed understanding of
the basic biology of this virus, especially its evolution
and methods for host adaptation, is needed.

The genetic code is degenerate and synonymous
codons, those that code for the same amino acid, have
been observed to be used unequally in most species
[9-14]. This uneven codon usage was not neutral as
some had suggested, but related to gene expression
[9,14-16], nucleotide usage [17], protein structure formation [18-20], and even viral RNA packaging [21,22].
Two major models have been proposed to explain
codon usage, the translation related (or selective) model
and the mutational (or neutral) model.
In the translation related model, one postulate is that
there is a co-adaptation of synonymous codon usage
and tRNA abundance to optimize translational efficiency. A correlation between codon usage and gene
expression is expected [23]. This is seen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [24] and might be due to intrinsic
codon preferences reflecting the stability of codon-anticodon interactions [9]. In Epstein-Barr virus latent stage
genes appear to deoptimize codon usage perhaps to
reduce competition with host cell translation [25] and
papillomavirus codon usage appears optimized for
expression in certain cell types [26]. Attenuation of
polio virus activity was achieved by reduced translation
for viral genes constructed with disfavored synonymous
codon pairs [27]. An alternative translation related postulate is the possibility of fine-tuning the kinetics of protein translation by a combination of rare and common
codons [28]. This has been demonstrated for the hepatitis A virus capsid protein [29,30].
The mutational model postulates that genetic compositional constraints influence the probability of mutational fixation [23] and this has been found in many
species [12,13,15,31,32]. In particular, the influence on
codon usage of reduced CpG dinucleotide content
might be related to anti-viral responses by the cell
[33,34]. It should be noted, however, that the models
are not mutually exclusive [23].
The replication cycle of the influenza virus depends
on host machinery and the virus utilises host cellular
components for its protein synthesis. Therefore codon
usage in this virus and its hosts could be expected to
affect viral replication. Although some studies have been
performed on the general codon usage of influenza
[35-37], little has been done to investigate the effect of
selection pressure imposed by the human host on the
codon usage of human influenza viruses and trends in
viral codon usage over time.
Codon usage of mammalian and avian influenza
viruses was examined in this study using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values [38] and Correspondence Analysis (CA) [39]. These techniques are well
established in studies of codon usage [37,40,41]. If influenza viruses and their subtypes that circulate in different
hosts have different codon usage biases, it should be

Page 2 of 14

possible to identify the subtype and host source of a
virus using this property. Host selection pressures, if
any, that affect codon usage in influenza viruses might
be identified by this approach.
Codon usage bias, which is largely determined by the
nucleotide in the third codon position, allows a different
perspective on viral evolution to be examined. In phylogentic studies, especially involving distantly related
sequences, this codon position may be discarded due to
possible saturation of mutations at the position. Phylogenetic analyses of large numbers of sequences require
distance-based methods which reduce the comparison
of sequences to a single distance value. Codon usage
studies retain some of the underlying structure of the
coding sequences in the comparison and may give
another perspective on evolutionary changes.
Correspondence analysis was primarily used to analyse
codon usage in influenza and host sequences and the
resulting patterns were visualized by projection onto 3dimensional graphs. It was possible to separate viruses
by their host, and also by subtype for human viruses,
using this technique. The consistency of the findings
from this technique with host specificity and viral subtype allowed a general tool to be created to analyze
newly emerged influenza viruses. This approach also
provided an opportunity to assess the origin of viral
strains, such as 1918 H1N1. Changes in codon usage
with the time of virus isolation were observed for
human influenza viruses so that the translational related
and mutational models of codon usage bias could be
examined.

Results
RSCU values of the 59 relevant codons were determined
for all the sequences studied in this work. To provide a
way to analyse and visualize these data, CA was used on
the RSCU values of different sets of viral and host
sequences. For large multi-dimensional datasets, CA
allows a reduction in the dimensionality of the data so
that efficient visualization that captures most of the variation can occur [39]. Here, the first 3 axes from the CA
analyses were used to provide 3-dimensional visualization of the relationships among the sequences. A further
dimension of color was used to identify sequences with
different features (e.g. viral host, subtype and year of
isolation) in an analysis.
Avian and human influenza virus codon usage

Projection of avian and human influenza virus codon
usage, by gene segment, onto the first 3 axes after CA
revealed that the viruses for the different hosts have differing codon usage biases (Figure 1A). Human host
virus subtypes are indicated by color and, apart from
the human H5N1 genes and some genes from human

H2N2, the host groups are well separated from each
other. For some of the human viral genes (PB2, PA and
NP) a single human viral subtype cluster is formed but
for the others (PB1, HA and NA) the subtype clusters
are separated (Figure 1A). The topology of these clusters
is consistent with the natural history of these human
viruses (see below and Discussion).
Human H5N1 genes, which are of avian origin, are
found in the avian virus codon usage cluster as would
be expected. Three genes from human H2N2 influenza
viruses (PB1, HA, NA), also of avian origin, are located
in the avian virus cluster. However, the avian origin
genes of human H3N2 (HA and PB1) extend from the
avian cluster. Some human H1 viral genes (e.g. PA) are
found in the human H3 cluster. When genes from avian
virus subtypes were examined they tended to form a
single large cluster (Additional file 1). Genes from the
more recently emerged avian H5N1 subtype showed a
more distinct subtype cluster and the HA gene showed
distinct subtype groupings.
Year of isolation of human H1 and H3 viruses

Codon usage in both human H1 and H3 viral genes
could be examined according to the year of virus isolation with this CA result. By coloring the H1 and H3
virus subtypes by year of origin (Figure 1B, H1; Figure
1C, H3), a trend of change in codon usage with time
could be seen for both viral subtypes. This increased the
separation of the human viruses from the avian viruses,
and the trends in codon usage of the two human subtypes were not convergent. No trend in codon usage
with year was observed for avian influenza viral subtypes
(data not shown).
Codon Usage Outliers

A small number of sequences from each host or subtype
in the codon usage plots (Figure 1 and Additional file 1)
were observed to be closer to, or within, the cluster of
the other host or a different subtype group of their host.
These were denoted as codon usage ‘outliers’. Some
representative examples and their descriptions are presented in Additional Files 2 and 3). On further examination, most of these outlier sequences were found to be
generated from zoonotic transmissions or reassortments
between viruses of different origin. For example, the
PB2 gene of human A/Victoria/1968 (H3N2) was found
to be of human H1 origin (sequence ID 1623, Additional files 2, PB2).
Use and validation of CA derived axes as a tool for virus
identification

Viral sequences that were not used as part of the CA
analysis can be placed in the graph of the CA results by
taking the cross product of the relative RSCU vectors of

Page 4 of 14

those sequences and each of the first 3 eigenvectors (i.e.
those that formed the X, Y and Z axes in the CA visualization) (Additional file 4). Using this formula, the positions of new viral sequences in these graphs were
estimated. Thus the CA created a tool to determine the
relationship between a novel sequence and those used
in the CA without the need for extensive sequence gathering and mathematical re-calculations.
Cross-validation by randomly assigning sequences to
5 equal groups was used to verify this strategy. CA was
performed on 80% of the sequences and the remaining
20% were predicted by applying the above formula for
the 5 groups. The clear similarity of the total and a
representative cross-validation analysis are shown
(Additional File 5). A second test analyzed sequences
of human influenza viruses that emerged from 2007 to
2009 by this approach and inserted their scores into
the existing CA graphs. As a control, CA was performed on the extended dataset containing the new
sequences. The topologies of the sequences from the
original and extended datasets were similar (Additional
file 6).
Relationship of pandemic H1N1/2009, H1N1/1918 and
canine H3N8 to other influenza viruses

CA was performed on the codon usage of seasonal
human, avian and swine influenza viral sequences,
together with the recent pandemic human H1N1/09
viral sequences. As shown in Figure 2, the pandemic
H1N1/09 virus was found to have avian codon usage
patterns for PB2, PA and NA, human/human-like swine
H3 patterns for PB1 and a classical swine H1N1 pattern
for HA and NP (Figure 2, yellow circles). Many swine
H1N2 and H3N2 triple reassortant viruses are located
close to the pandemic H1N1 virus.
This clustering method was also applied to investigate
the possible gene sources of 1918 pandemic H1N1 using
the A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 strain as the reference
sequence. The PB1, HA and NA genes of 1918 H1N1
were found to be located close to mammalian H1 influenza viruses in the CA (Figure 2). Codon usage patterns
similar to those of avian influenza viruses were observed
for the PB2 and NP genes of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918,
while its PA gene was located in the interface between
the avian and mammalian clusters (Figure 2). The ten
sequences that had the shortest distance from each of
the genes of A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 are summarized
in Additional file 7.
The emergence of canine H3N8 virus has been welldocumented as an in toto transfer of equine influenza
virus [42]. CA of the codon usage of human, avian,
swine, canine and equine influenza viral sequences
located the canine H3N8 viruses in the equine viral
cluster (Additional file 8).

Codon usage of influenza viruses and their hosts

As influenza viruses that infect different hosts have different codon usage biases (Figure 1), codon usage in
influenza viruses and their hosts was examined. Average
RSCU values of influenza virus subtypes and their hosts
were calculated (Additional file 9). Eight codons, all of
which contain the dinucleotide CpG, were under-represented in both human and avian influenza viruses
(TCG, ACG, GCG, CCG, CGC, CGA, CGG and CGT;
RSCU value <0.6). Nine codons (TCG, ACG, GCG,
CCG, GTA, TTA, CTA, ATA and CAA) were underrepresented in all the viral hosts (RSCU ≤ 0.62). Except
for CAA, all these codons contained either CpG or TpA
at their 3’ ends. The under-representation of CpG or
TpA dinucleotides has been reported in many living
organisms [43-45], however, only CpG was under-represented in the influenza viral genomes.
Five codons, which were purine rich, (ACA, GCA,
AGA, AGG and GGA) were over-represented in all the
viral genomes (RSCU > 1.6). A similar over-representation of codons was only found for CTG and GTG in the
hosts. The most commonly used synonymous codons
were the same within the viral or host groups (except
for 1 amino acid in the viruses and 4 amino acids in the
hosts) but were different between the influenza genomes
and their hosts for 14 of the 18 amino acids (Additional
file 9, highlighted in bold).
Codon usage trends in human influenza viruses

To better understand the change in codon usage over time
that was seen in human influenza viruses (Figure 1), a CA
analysis of all 6 viral genes in the context of human RefSeq
coding sequences was performed. The human genes
formed a cluster separate from those of the viruses which
were again separated based on host type (Figure 3A). Individual human viral genes were also well separated from
their avian counterparts (Figure 3B) as expected from the
initial analysis. Human H1 and H3 viral subtype genes
were extracted from the graph and examined separately,
while still within the context of the analysis with human
genes. Generally the genes had different trends in codon
usage change and in different overall directions (Figure
3C). Many of these human viral genes had a unidirectional
trend on the X-axis of the combined host and viral CA
(Figure 3C, highlighted by arrows) which was more prominent for some genes (e.g. H1 PB2 and H3 HA). Outlier
groups, as in the earlier analysis of the viral sequences,
were also found (blue dotted circles in Figure 3C).
To examine whether a general trend in the codon
usage of seasonal influenza viruses exists, a correlation
analysis of the RSCU values for codons of each viral
gene versus the year the virus was isolated was performed. Codons that have a strong positive (r > 0.5) or
negative (r < -0.5) correlation coefficient with year of

Page 6 of 14

virus isolation are summarized in Additional file 10. As
expected, far fewer avian than human virus codons
show positive and negative trends.
Codon usage changes in human influenza viruses and
nucleotide composition

Codon usage is known to be highly influenced by
nucleotide composition [31]. Codons from the human
viral populations that showed negative correlation trends
in RSCU with year of isolation (Additional file 10) had a
significantly lower A (p = 0.01) and higher G (p = 0.02)
content in the third codon position than did those of
positive correlation trend codons. Overall GC content in
the negatively correlated group was significantly higher
than that in the positive correlation trend population
(p < 0.001). It was also found that the frequency of the
ApA and CpG dinucleotides were significantly lower
(p = 0.049) and higher (p = 0.042), respectively, in the
negative correlation trend codon populations.
Using the overall nucleotide and third codon position
nucleotide composition of human influenza viral PB2,
PB1, PA, HA, NP and NA genes as references, it was
demonstrated that the codons with negative correlation
trends with year of isolation had significantly higher GC
content (p = 7 E-09) and higher G usage at the third
codon position (p = 0.00016) when compared with the
set of full-length gene sequences. However, significantly
altered nucleotide usage in the positive correlation trend
population was not observed.
The GC content and third-codon position nucleotide
content of the six human viral genes had individual
trends with the year of virus isolation. Many of these
human viral genes had a clear tendency to reduce the
overall GC nucleotide usage (Additional file 11, highlighted in red). An increase in A and decrease in G
nucleotide usage at the third codon position with year
of isolation was also observed in many of these viral
genes (Additional File 12). This was not observed in the
avian viral populations (Additional Files 11-12). Human
viral segments, which were shown to have a unidirectional codon usage trend (Figure 3, PB2, PB1, PA, NP
and NA of H1; PB2, HA, NP of H3), were all found to
have a reduction in GC nucleotide usage with year of
viral isolation (Additional file 11).
Influence of viral gene translation on codon usage

Viral codon usage (avian and human H1N1 and H3N2)
by year of isolation was correlated with human codon
usage (taken from the RefSeq coding sequences). With
the exception of the HA (H1N1) (r = 0.27, p < 4e-08)
and NA (H3N2) genes (r = 0.48, p < 2e-16), the correlation coefficients between human and viral codon usage
showed a negative trend with the year of virus isolation
(Figure 4A).

Year of isolaƟon

Discussion
Codon usage bias is a distinctive characteristic of many
organisms [23] and has been noted in viruses such as
influenza [35-37]. As the influenza virus relies on the
host cell’s machinery for its replication, codon usage
bias could play a role in host adaptation and the virulence of the virus. To investigate this, the 59 codons,
which can display bias in their usage, were examined for
influenza virus sequences of human, avian, swine, canine
and equine host specificity along with human coding
sequences. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)
was the measure of codon bias used. Dimension reduction techniques are needed to reasonably present and
analyze the 59 dimensional space of codon bias, and
correspondence analysis (CA) was selected to do this.
For effective visualization of results, the first 3 eigenvectors were retained as axes for plots of codon usage. It
should be noted that all CA studies performed here
were based only on codon usage data.

Human genes known to be highly expressed in human
fetal lung, adult lung, adult trachea and bronchial
epithelial cells [46] were used to generate 4 human tissue-specific codon usage datasets. Correlations between
human tissue-specific gene codon usage and viral gene
codon usage mainly showed negative or no trend with
year of virus isolation (Figures 4B and 4C; Additional
file 13 and data not shown). In bronchial epithelial cells
(Figure 4B and 4C), codon usage in the human H1 HA
or H3 NA viral genes had a positive trend with year of
viral isolation.
Human tRNA abundance could affect translation and
codon usage in influenza viruses. The tRNA Adaptation
Index (tAI) gives a measure of how well a gene is
adapted to a tRNA pool [47]. Taking the human tRNA
gene copy numbers as a reference, none of the tAI of
these human viral genes showed a significant increase in
tAI with year of virus isolation, except for H1 NA (r =
0.47, p < 2.2e-16) and H3 PA (r = 0.32, p < 2.2e-16)
(Figure 5). Most of the human viral genes had a negative
or no trend in tAI with year of viral isolation. Respiratory tissue-specific tRNA expression profiles do not

Human and avian host influenza viruses isolated from
1918 to 2006 had different codon usage patterns and
the human influenza subtypes (H1, H2, H3 and H5)
could be distinguished based on their codon usage.
Exceptions to the pattern of host separation were the
human H5N1 sequences, which are of very recent avian
origin, and the human H2N2 influenza PB1, HA and
NA genes, consistent with their introduction from avian
viral strains around 1957 [49] and the brief circulation
of this virus in humans. The longer circulating H3N2
subtype genes of avian origin, PB1 and HA [49], showed
a trend, over time, away from the avian codon usage
cluster.
Human H1 and H3 viral subtypes have been suggested
to differ in their evolutionary and epidemiological
dynamics [50]. Non-convergent trends in codon usage
away from the avian subtypes were observed and suggest
that selection on codon usage is operating in the H1
and H3 subtypes, but not to form a common human
viral codon usage pattern. The evolutionary rates of
these human viral genes are not constant and can be
varied across time [51]. This might also explain the nonlinear trends in human viral codon usages observed in
this study.
All 6 genes of avian H5N1 viruses formed a more distinct cluster which may be due to their recent emergence and extensive surveillance over the last decade.
Frequent segment reassortment events identified in
other avian virus subtypes [52] resulted in their genes
forming a single codon usage cluster except for the HA,
and to a lesser extent the NA, genes involved in antigenic responses and so used for viral subtyping [53].
Sequences that were not located with the majority of
their host group or subtype ("outliers”) were, on examination, frequently found to originate from zoonotic
transmission or reassortment.
CA based on RSCU values appears to be an effective
tool to reveal evolutionary trends and to classify influenza sequences by host and subtype. RSCU values from
a novel sequence can be mapped to the existing axes of
a CA to reveal the relationship of that sequence to existing groups as shown by the validation tests performed in
this work. This method also allows prompt visual identification of viral reassortants or zoonotic transfer in
influenza genes without the need to perform extensive
computations.
The utility of CA of codon usage to reveal evolutionary trends and relationships in influenza sequences was
demonstrated by the analysis of the recent pandemic
H1N1/2009 viruses and the 1918 pandemic virus.
Codon usage patterns of the H1N1/2009 viruses in the
CA revealed their known triple reassortant characteristics [4,5] and the locations of these genes close to many
swine H1N2 and H3N2 triple reassortant viruses suggest

Page 10 of 14

that one of those viruses might be the precursor of
H1N1. Similarly, the canine H3N8 virus was located
in the equine viral cluster, reflecting its in toto equine
origin [42].
Previously, the 1918 H1N1 pandemic was suggested to
be caused by a direct zoonotic transmission of an avian
virus from birds to humans [54]. However, other phylogenetic analyses of 1918 influenza viral sequences
resulted in alternative hypotheses [55,56]. The CA
described here indicates that the PB1, HA and NA
genes of 1918 H1N1 have mammalian like codon usage,
being closer to the swine viral sequences. These genes
might have been introduced into the mammalian virus
population well before the introduction of the PB2, and
NP genes which have avian characteristics and the PA
gene which has an intermediate codon usage pattern.
Overall, this work supports the hypothesis that the 1918
H1N1 virus was generated by reassortment events
between mammalian and avian influenza viruses [55,56].
When examined together (Fig. 3, Additional file 9),
human viral genes did not have the general codon usage
pattern of their host’s genes. In this combined CA,
trends in codon usage with the year of viral isolation
were still apparent with many genes showing a unidirectional trend, to different extents, along the X axis of the
combined CA. This could indicate that a common selection pressure is acting on the human viral genes alongside gene specific pressures. Many human viral codons
were increasing or decreasing in their usage with time
(Additional file 10), suggesting selection on codon usage
at both gene and subtype levels. Avian viruses had few
codons showing substantial trends in codon usage probably due to frequent segment reassortment events [52]
as noted before.
Nucleotide composition is known to affect codon
usage [31]. Statistically significant nucleotide differences
in codons where RSCU was changing with time were
found (Additional file 10) when the less used codons
were compared with more used codons or with the
overall sequence composition. These findings were consistent with an hypothesis that there is a host-dependent
C to U mutation bias in human H1N1 viral genomes
[57] and a finding that there is a selection pressure to
eliminate CG dinucleotides in the viral genome [58]. No
significant differences relative to overall sequence composition were found in codons increasing in usage.
This work gives further evidence for host selection
pressures on human influenza acting against the use of
G or C nucleotides and the use of a G nucleotide at the
third codon position. The trend in codon usage patterns
with year of viral isolation in the CA of Figure 3 suggests reducing GC content might be part of the selection pressure changing viral codon usage. As these
mutational patterns were not observed in the avian viral

Wong et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/253

genes, this indicates a human host driven process which
could represent mutational pressure, fine-tuning of
translational kinetics or an evasion of host cellular
defences.
Selection pressure on overall GC usage and nucleotide
usage at the third codon position might not necessarily
both act on the same viral segments (e.g. H1N1 PA and
H1N1 HA). The HA gene of the human H1N1 subtype
is negatively correlated over time with the use of G at
the third codon position but is uncorrelated with overall
GC usage. Other selective pressure could modulate viral
codon usage in a more segment-specific manner (e.g.
conservation of RNA motif/structure for other virological processes, fine-tuning of translation kinetics) [21,28].
Frequent amino acid mutations of the surface proteins
due to antigenic drift might also cause this effect [59].
Human genes and most viral genes had a negative
correlation in codon usage over time of viral isolation.
This tends to suggest that changes in viral codon usage
might not affect, or might even have a negative effect
on viral gene translation. Exceptions were the HA
(H1N1) and NA (H3N2) genes which had highly statistically significant positive correlations. Human tissue specific codon usage might be a more relevant comparison
set, however human bronchial epithelial cells, which
support efficient virus replication showed the same patterns. Translational selection pressure might act on only
some human influenza viral genes. Using the tAI [47]
instead of human gene codon usage (tissue specific data
were not available) provided similar results suggesting
generally that translational pressure may not be acting.
Exceptions were the H1N1 NA and H3N2 PA genes.
There is some evidence of translational pressure on
the codon usage of human influenza viruses. Why this
effect could only be observed in a few human viral segments is not clear. It is possible that other selective
pressures on the human influenza virus are much stronger than that of translational selection thereby masking
this effect. Alternatively, reduced GC content in human
influenza viruses may prevent the activation of human
innate immune system [60] or might cause viral mRNA
to form less stable structures at lower temperatures,
thereby allowing more efficient viral RNA translation in
human cells [61,62] or affecting translation kinetics [28].
Further investigation will be needed to address whether
translational selection has a larger role in influenza
evolution.

trends revealed. The effectiveness of this type of analysis
was demonstrated by its ability to replicate the known
evolutionary groups of influenza viruses as well as to
reveal new trends. It was shown that CA of the style
used here can form a valuable tool to quickly classify
and identify any unusual patterns in newly isolated
viruses. Application of this technique to the 1918 pandemic H1N1 provided further evidence that it is more
likely to be a reassortant between avian and mammalian
viruses. Continuous trends in codon usage with time of
viral isolation were detected in human influenza viruses.
Further analyses of codon usage suggested that viral
evolution might primarily be modulated by host selection pressure on viral nucleotide content, particularly
GC content. Although some evidence was found for
translational related selection pressure acting on a few
human influenza virus genes, the observed nucleotide
compositional biases generally appeared likely to reduce
the rate of viral mRNA translation. Mutational pressure,
fine-tuning of translation kinetics or evasion of host
anti-viral responses could be the forces shaping human
influenza viral codon usage.

Methods
Sequence data

Coding sequences of influenza A viruses were downloaded from, the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU[63] and human
reference coding sequences (N = 20,091) were downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/. Influenza sequences were arranged in five datasets. Human
and avian sequences isolated from 1918 to 2006 formed
the major dataset and the other sets were: swine influenza virus sequences isolated before 2007, seasonal
human influenza A viruses isolated between 2007 to
2009, novel swine-origin pandemic human H1N1 viruses
isolated before 18th May 2009, and canine and equine
H3N8 virues.
For influenza sequences, short (<80% of the corresponding gene) and abnormal sequences were removed
from the datasets, and only 6 viral genes were studied in
the analysis as the short length and insufficient codon
usage diversity of the other genes might bias the results.
The 6 genes analysed coded for PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP
and NA, and all these genes were classified according to
their viral subtypes.
Other databases used

Conclusion
This study has shown that codon usage bias provides an
additional strategy to study the evolution of human
influenza viruses. By CA on RSCU values, patterns and
trends in codon usage were observed that allowed different viral groups to be distinguished and evolutionary

Codon usage data of influenza viral hosts, human (Homo
sapiens), domestic pig (Sus scrofa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), goose (Anser anser) and chicken (Gallus gallus), were obtained from the codon usage database
http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/[64]. Human tissue specific gene expression data, from a previously described

human transcriptome microarray study [46], were
obtained from the GEO http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/[65] at accession number GDS596.
Codon bias estimates using Relative Synonymous Codon
Usage

The RSCU value of a codon [38] is its observed frequency divided by its expected frequency in the absence
of usage bias (which is the average frequency of all
codons for that amino acid). RSCU values are not
affected by sequence length and amino acid frequency
since these factors are eliminated during the computation. Codons used less than average, at average level (no
bias) and more than average have RSCU values, respectively of <1, 1 and >1 [37,40,41]. Codons with RSCU
value >1.6 were regarded as over-represented, while
codons with RSCU values <0.6) were said to be underrepresented. Stop codons and codons that uniquely code
for an amino acid (ATG - methionine and TGG - tryptophan), are not relevant to an RSCU analysis. For each
sequence in the datasets, RSCU values were calculated
for the 59 relevant codons by a PERL script (available
upon request).
Other sequence characteristics

The tAI [66], which measures how well a gene has
adapted to a tRNA gene population in terms of tRNA
gene copy numbers, was estimated using CodonR [47].
Single and dinucleotide sequence composition were calculated by a PERL script (available upon request) and
GC3 (GC content in the 3rd base position of a codon)
was computed by CodonR [47].
Correspondence Analysis and other statistical tests

CA is a type of multivariate analysis that allows a geometrical representation of the sets of rows and columns
in a dataset [39]. CA was performed on the RSCU
values of the sequences studied here using the R statistical software, version 2.6.2 http://www.r-project.org and
the function “corresp” from the MASS library [67]. The
first three eigenvectors from each analysis were used to
incorporate most information from the datasets [68] and
were used as axes for visualization of the results.
Sequence vectors of RSCU proportion values (codon
RSCU/sum of RSCU values for that sequence) were
mapped to each of these axes by the cross product of
the sequence vector and the corresponding eigenvector.
Graphs were plotted using SigmaPlot 10.0 (Systat Software Inc). Different colouring schemes were used to
label sequences on the plots according to the different
features being investigated, (e.g. host, viral subtype and
year of viral isolation). Other statistical tests were performed using R http://www.r-project.org
