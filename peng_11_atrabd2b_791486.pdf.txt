AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have overlapping
functions in pollen development and pollen
tube growth

Abstract
Background: Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis,
endocytosis and membrane recycling. Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only a subset have been
functionally characterized.
Results: Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination
and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared
with wild-type plants across a variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable
from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants.
Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched
pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the
pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both
highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies.
Conclusions: These findings support a partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking
during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members.

Background
Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) regulate
diverse processes in eukaryotic cells including signal
transduction, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization
and intracellular membrane trafficking. GTPases are
activated by GTP binding and inactivated by subsequent
hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thus acting as molecular switches in these processes [1,2]. The Rab GTPase
family is the largest and most complex within the Ras
protein superfamily. Rab GTPases are important regulators of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis,
endocytosis and membrane recycling processes in eukaryotic cells [3-6]. Rab GTPase functions have been extensively studied in yeast and mammalian systems. Both in
vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that
different Rab proteins function in distinct intracellular
membrane trafficking steps and they are hypothesized to
work together with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive

factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to
promote specificity of vesicle transport to target compartments and facilitate vesicle and target membrane
fusion [7-13]. They are therefore essential for the transport of proteins and membrane through the endomembrane system to their destination.
The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 93 putative
Ras superfamily proteins. Fifty-seven of these are Rab
GTPases, more than in yeast but similar to the number
in humans [13,14]. According to their sequence similarity and phylogenetic clustering with yeast and mammalian orthologs, these Rab proteins were assigned to eight
subfamilies, AtRabA to AtRabH, which can be further
divided into 18 subclasses [13]. Relatively few of the
plant Rab orthologs have been investigated functionally.
Most of these studies have used constitutively active
(CA) and/or dominant negative (DN) mutations, generated by direct mutation of the conserved domain to
restrict mutant GTPase proteins to the active GTPbound form (constitutively active) or inactive GDPbound form (dominant negative). Expression of CA or

DN Rab GTPases can perturb the activity of the endogenous Rab, revealing their functional significance. For a
number of plant Rab GTPases, expression of their CA
and DN mutants in transformed plants, together with
protein localization information, has shown that these
Rabs perform functions similar to those of their yeast
and mammalian orthologs [15-19].
Several reports indicate that Rab proteins are important for elongation of tip-growing cells in plants. For
example, AtRabA4b is reported to localize to the tips of
root hair cells and was proposed to regulate membrane
trafficking through a compartment involved in the
polarized secretion of cell wall components [18]. NtRab2
GTPase is important for trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in tobacco pollen
tubes and may be specialized to optimally support the
high secretory demands in these tip growing cells [16].
NtRabA (Rab11) in tobacco is predominantly localized
to an inverted cone-shaped region at the pollen tube tip,
and both constitutively active and dominant negative
mutants resulted in reduced tube growth rate, meandering pollen tubes, and reduced male fertility [20].
There are four genes in the Arabidopsis RabD subfamily, AtRabD1 (At3g11730), AtRabD2a (At1g02130,
AtRab1b), AtRabD2b (At5g47200, AtRab1a) and
AtRabD2c (At4g17530, AtRab1c) [13]. In mammals, the
orthologs of AtRabD, Rab1 isoforms, physically associate
with the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and
Golgi and regulate membrane trafficking between the
ER and Golgi complex [21]. Fluorescent protein fusions
with AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b localize to the
Golgi and trans-Golgi network [22,23], and transient
expression in plant cells of dominant negative mutants
of rabD2a or rabD1 resulted in the inhibition of ER-toGolgi trafficking [15,22,24], suggesting a related function
for the plant Rab1 homologs. Pinheiro et al. [22] isolated
T-DNA insertion mutants in each of the AtRabD family
genes and reported that each of the single and double
mutants lacked a detectable phenotype. By contrast, a
rabD2a rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant was lethal and a
rabD1 rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant had stunted growth
and low fertility, indicating that these gene family members perform important and overlapping functions.
We previously hypothesized that closely related
genes with a high Pearson correlation in their RNA
accumulation level are functionally redundant, and
showed that expression patterns of both the AtRabD2b
and AtRabD2c genes are negatively correlated with the
process of starch synthesis [25], whereas the expression
patterns of the remaining RabD genes are not. We
therefore predicted that these two Rab proteins may
have redundant functions that are not shared by the
other two AtRabD family members. Here we show that
AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated in their

Page 2 of 16

RNA accumulation level across a variety of experimental conditions. Phenotypic analysis of knockout
mutants indicates that they are at least partially functionally redundant, and are important in pollen development and pollen tube growth. The proteins both
localize to the trans-Golgi, consistent with their proposed role in trafficking from the ER to the Golgi
apparatus.

Results
The expression patterns of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are
closely correlated

The four RabD family members in Arabidopsis share
about 88% identity at the amino acid level. The accumulation pattern of the associated transcripts is quite
distinct across a wide variety of experimental conditions and developmental stages (MetaOmGraph, http://
www.metnetdb.org/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm; [26])
(Table 1; Additional file 1, Table S1). AtRabD2b and
AtRabD2c expression patterns are correlated (at a
Pearson correlation value of 0.72), whereas AtRabD1
and AtRabD2a show very low correlation with the
others (Pearson correlation value of < 0.20). Based on
their high sequence similarity (99% amino acid identity) and the correlation between their mRNA accumulation patterns, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and
AtRabD2c might have some functional overlap that is
not shared by AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a.
Identification of Null Mutations in the Genes AtRabD2b
and AtRabD2c

It was reported previously that an AtrabD2b AtrabD2c
double mutant has no phenotype [22]. Based on our
correlation analysis above, we hypothesized that this
mutant may have some more subtle defects that cannot
be compensated for by the remaining family members.
To investigate this further, we identified T-DNA insertion mutants (Figure 1A) in AtrabD2b (3 alleles) and
AtrabD2c (1 allele). Homozygous lines for the T-DNA
insertions were identified by PCR, using primers
selected by iSct primers (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.2.html), and the insertion sites were determined by
sequencing the PCR products (Figure 1B). Analysis of
mRNA levels by RT-PCR indicated that AtrabD2b-1,
AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 are null mutants. However,

Genomic DNA was isolated from the indicated single and double

lane 1, AtrabD2c-LP1 and AtrabD2c-RP1; lane 2, AtrabD2c-RP1 and
LBb1; lane 3, AtrabD2b-LP1 and AtrabD2b-RP1; lane 4, AtrabD2b-RP1

the AtrabD2b-3 mutation had no effect on AtRabD2b
RNA accumulation (Figure 1C and data not shown).
Progeny from AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1 heterozygotes showed a T-DNA segregation ratio of approximately 3:1 based on kanamycin resistance, consistent
with a single insertion. AtrabD2b-2 was supplied as a
homozygous line. To generate AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutants, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1 homozygous

single mutants were crossed, F1 plants were allowed to
self fertilize and the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double
mutant was identified from the F2 population by PCR
using the primers for both AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2c-1.
Hereafter, the AtrabD2b-2/AtrabD2c-1 double mutant
will be referred to as AtrabD2b/2c, and AtrabD2b-2 and
AtrabD2c-1 single mutants will be referred to as
AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c respectively.
Siliques Are Shorter in the AtrabD2b/2c Double Mutant
than in Either Single Mutant or in Wild-Type Lines

To evaluate phenotypes associated with the AtrabD2b
and AtrabD2c mutants, homozygous AtrabD2b (three
alleles, AtrabD2b-1, AtrabD2b-2 and AtrabD2b-3),
AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/2c mutants, along with wildtype siblings, were grown on agar plates with or without
various hormone, nutrient and light treatments. We
tested over 50 of the conditions described in the Gantlet
website (http://www.gantlet.org); however, no significant
phenotypic differences were observed in the seedlings for
any of the mutant alleles (data not shown). In addition,
we tested the seedling phenotype on media with or without sucrose or vitamin B5 and, consistent with previous
reports [22], no obvious phenotypes were observed.
By contrast, AtrabD2b/2c double mutant lines
showed a phenotype associated with reproduction. In
these lines, siliques were shorter when grown either
under continuous light or long day (16h light/8h dark)
conditions. Neither the AtrabD2b nor the AtrabD2c
single mutant alleles displayed a short silique phenotype. The length of AtrabD2b/2c siliques was 70% of
that of wild-type, AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutant
lines (Figure 2; P < 0.01 by Studentâs t-test). To evaluate whether this reduced silique size is associated with
a seed defect, siliques from AtrabD2b/2c, wild-type,
AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant lines were opened at
10 DAF (days after flowering). Consistently, no defects
in the seeds of either AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single
mutants were observed. However, approximately half
of the ovules in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were
not fertilized (Figure 3). Consistent with this observation, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants produced a smaller quantity of seeds than wild-type plants or single
mutants (Figure 3; Additional file 2, Figure S1). These
results are consistent with a functional overlap
between AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c that cannot be fulfilled by AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a.
Complementation of AtrabD2b/2c Mutant Phenotype

To demonstrate that the AtrabD2b/2c mutant phenotype
is due to the mutations in the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c
genes, constructs containing either AtRabD2b or
AtRabD2c, each expressed from their native promoter,
were introduced into the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant.

mutant plants were dissected and examined under the microscope. Arrows heads indicate unfertilized ovaries. Inset, seeds produced by a single
plant. Scale bars = 200 Î¼m.

Both constructs were able to rescue the silique length
phenotype of the mutant (Figure 4A, C) and restored the
seed fertilization defect (Figure 4B) and seed number
(Additional file 2, Figure S1), confirming that the loss of
AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c is responsible for these
phenotypes.
AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c Pollen Have Defects
in Morphology and Pollen Tube Elongation

Two possibilities could explain the unfertilized embryos
seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. One possibility is that the pollen bears a defect that leads to pollen
sterility and inability to fertilize the embryos. Alternatively, ovules may bear an abnormality such that their
fertilization is reduced. To distinguish between these
two possibilities, we observed the pollen by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). All of the pollen from wildtype plants looked normal, whereas more than 20% of
the AtrabD2b/2c pollen exhibited an irregular, collapsed
morphology (Figure 5A). We also observed that some
abnormal pollen grains from the AtrabD2b/2c double
mutant were devoid of nuclei, as indicated by DAPI
staining, whereas all pollen from wild-type (Figure 5B)
and single mutant plants (data not shown) have nuclei.
This defective pollen may be the severely collapsed

pollen visualized under the SEM. Surprisingly, even the
AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutant lines produce
aberrant pollen at a level of about 10%. This is unexpected, as the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants
have normal-appearing siliques and seed quantities similar to the wild-type plants. A likely explanation is that
there are sufficient normal pollen grains in the single
mutants to efficiently fertilize the ovaries in the
AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants.
We originally identified AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c
because the transcript accumulation patterns of these
two genes correlate with those of many genes associated
with starch metabolism. Indeed, the AtrabD2b/2c double
mutant pollen stained less intensely with IKI than wildtype pollen (Figure 5C), suggesting a decreased starch
content in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen. This is consistent with the expression correlation, although the reason for this phenotype is unclear.
A single flower of Arabidopsis produces thousands of
pollen grains, but usually there are less than 100
embryos in one silique. If only 20% of the pollen grains
are abnormal, we would not expect the strikingly
reduced fertility seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double
mutant. We therefore looked for additional explanations
for the reduced fertility. To evaluate germination and

and 6B). Moreover, the pollen tubes of the AtrabD2b/2c
double mutant were much shorter than those of wildtype plants or either single mutant (P < 0.01), and the
single mutants had shorter pollen tubes than wild-type
plants (Figure 6E; P < 0.01 for both mutants). Even
though the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants had
collapsed pollen, shorter pollen tubes and swollen tips,
their siliques were normal compared with wild-type
plants. We hypothesize that the single mutants may still
have sufficient normal pollen to enable all embryos to
be fertilized. The in vitro pollen germination phenotypes
were confirmed by analyzing pollen tube growth after in
vivo pollination (Figure 6C). Open flowers from wildtype or AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants were incubated
overnight on agar medium. The AtrabD2b/2c mutant
flowers had reduced pollen germination and decreased
pollen tube length compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that pollen germination and pollen tube growth
may also be defective in vivo.
Pollen and Pollen Tube Defects Cause the Shorter Siliques
in the AtrabD2b/2c Mutant

A, Siliques are shown from wild-type plants, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c

tube growth of the pollen grains, pollen was germinated
in vitro. After overnight incubation, almost all of the
pollen from wild-type plants germinated and showed a
typical tip growth. However, about 10% of the pollen
from the AtrabD2b/2c mutant did not germinate at all
and 50% of the pollen germinated but did not grow apically as did pollen of wild-type plants (Figure 6A and
6B). Instead, these pollen tubes were shorter and had
swollen tips, some burst (â5%), and others branched
(â2%; Figure 6A,B and 6D). The germination rate of the
pollen from the single mutants was similar to the wildtype pollen. However, approximately 20% of the germinating pollen also had swollen tips (Figure 6A and 6B),
although the phenotype was not as severe as the
AtrabD2b/2c double mutant; burst or branched tubes
were never observed in either single mutant (Figure 6A

To investigate whether the unfertilized seeds are due to
the observed pollen abnormality, or whether the ovary
also has defects that might contribute to the reduced
rate of fertilization, we crossed wild-type and AtrabD2b/
2c mutant plants. If the shorter silique phenotype is
borne only by the abnormal pollen, wild-type plant pollen should rescue the AtrabD2b/2c mutant silique phenotype to a normal length (AtrabD2b/2c mutant female
flower crossed with wild-type plant pollen). In contrast,
the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plant pollen crossed with a
wild-type female would mimic the mutant phenotype of
decreased fertilization (wild-type female flower crossed
with AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen). Alternatively, if the
ovary also has some abnormality, wild-type pollen
would not completely rescue the mutant phenotype, and
AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen would not mimic the
mutant phenotype. The results of these crosses indicated
that pollen from wild-type plants can rescue the
AtrabD2b/2c short silique phenotype, and the pollen
from AtrabD2b/2c can bestow the shorter silique phenotype on wild-type plants (Figures 7A and 7C). Specifically, about half of the seeds were not fertilized in the
siliques that developed from wild-type pistils fertilized
by AtrabD2b/2c pollen (Figure 7B). In contrast, the siliques from AtrabD2b/2c usually had about 50% unfertilized ovules, but when these pistils were fertilized by
wild-type pollen, all seeds looked normal, and the siliques were longer than those siliques in the same inflorescence which were self-fertilized (Figures 7). These
results confirm that the unfertilized ovaries are mostly,
if not exclusively, caused by pollen defects in the
AtrabD2b/2c mutant.

In silico and GUS Analysis of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c
Expression

If AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are involved in pollen
development and pollen tube growth, they are expected
to be co-expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. Public
microarray data indicates that both AtRabD2b and
AtRabD2c are expressed throughout development,

including high expression in floral organs and particularly in the stamen (Figure 8; [25,26]).
To directly examine the spatial expression pattern of
the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, transgenic lines
containing promoter:GFP/GUS constructs for each gene
were analyzed for GUS activity at various stages of
development from germination to senescence. As

indicated by the in silico analyses, both AtRabD2b and
AtRabD2c were expressed widely during development.
GUS staining further indicated that in cotyledons,
rosette leaves and cauline leaves, AtRabD2b expression
was localized predominantly in vascular tissues (Figure
9B), whereas AtRabD2c was expressed ubiquitously in
cotyledons and in mature leaves throughout the entire
leaf. Interestingly, in emerging leaves, AtRabD2c was

only expressed in the trichomes, while AtRabD2b was
not expressed in these cells (Figure 9A). In flowers,
AtRabD2b was expressed in sepals, stamen and stigma,
while AtRabD2c was expressed in sepal, stamen, stigma
and style (Figure 9E, F). This dichotomy of expression
suggests that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c may function
independently of each other in certain cells. Both genes
were expressed in pollen grains and germinating pollen

gene driven by a 954bp or 558bp fragment upstream of the AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c start codon, respectively. GUS activity (blue color) was
analyzed in cotyledons, young leaves, (A, B), old leaves, roots (C, D), flowers, pistils and germinated pollen (E, F).

(Figure 9E, F), which is consistent with their role in pollen development and pollen tube growth. They both
also showed expression in roots, but AtRabD2b was ubiquitously expressed throughout the root, while
AtRabD2c expression was excluded from root hairs and
root tips (Figure 9A-D).

Subcellular localization of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c

In mammals, different AtRabD orthologs (Rab1 isoforms)
are localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment or Golgi compartments. In plants, AtRabD2a and
AtRabD2b are associated with the Golgi apparatus and
trans-Golgi network [15,22,23,27], and we predicted that

Peng et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/25

AtRabD2c will share this localization. To determine the
subcellular localization of AtRabD2c, GFP-AtRabD2b
and GFP-AtRabD2c constructs were introduced into
Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and the GFP signal was
observed by confocal microscopy. For both constructs,
GFP localized to punctuate structures, reminiscent of the
Golgi apparatus. To verify the identity of these structures,
GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c were co-transfected
into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the trans-Golgi
marker ST-YFP [15], and YFP and GFP signals were
observed. Confocal results indicated that both AtRabD2b
and AtRabD2c primarily colocalized with ST-YFP (Figure
10) and are therefore associated with the Golgi, consistent with a role in Golgi trafficking. Occasionally,
AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c-labeled structures were seen
that did not contain ST-YFP; these could be the postGolgi compartments described previously [22,23,27].
Cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion demonstrated the absence of cross talk between GFP and YFP
signals (Additional file 3, Figure S2).

Discussion
Rab GTPases are critical players in the transport of materials through the endomembrane system, controlling exocytosis of proteins and cell wall materials, endocytosis of
receptors and transporters, and membrane recycling processes. Together with SNARE proteins, they promote specificity of vesicle transport to target compartments,
ensuring that vesicles fuse only with their appropriate target and thus maintaining the distinct identity of individual
organelles. Two Rab subfamilies, Rab1 (AtRabD orthologs)

Page 12 of 16

and Rab2 (AtRabB orthologs), have been reported to function in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi in
mammalian cells [21,28-34]. The plant Rab1 and Rab2
homologs AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and NtRab2 have also
been reported to function in ER to Golgi vesicle transport
[15,16]. Here, we demonstrate a distinct physiological role
for the Rab1 homologs AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen
development and pollen tube growth.
Using the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph (http://
www.metnetdb.org) [25,26] to determine the pairwise
Pearsons correlation value between the expression patterns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file 1,
Table S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, only
the expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly
correlated. From this data, we hypothesized that
AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant functions that are not shared by the remaining AtRabD
family members. To test our hypothesis, we used TDNA insertion single and double mutants to confirm
that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have functional overlap
and show that they are both required for normal pollen
development and tip growth of pollen tubes. We also
showed that they both co-localize with the trans-Golgi
marker ST-YFP, consistent with their proposed role in
Golgi trafficking.
The conclusion that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are
partially functionally redundant is based on several lines
of evidence. First, although single mutant plants containing AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c mutant alleles are indistinguishable morphologically from their wild-type
counterparts, even when grown under a variety of

Figure 10 AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are both Golgi resident proteins. Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co-transformed with GFP-AtRabD2b
or GFP-AtRabD2c and the Golgi marker ST-YFP. GFP, YFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected by confocal microcopy. At least 10
transformed protoplasts were observed for each construct. Upper panel, GFP-AtRabD2b; lower panel, GFP-AtRabD2c. Scale bar = 10 Î¼m.

growth conditions, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant has
a short-silique phenotype. Second, both AtrabD2b and
AtrabD2c mutant plants produce a small percentage of
deformed and collapsed pollen grains, while AtrabD2b/
2c lines produce a higher percentage of deformed pollen
grains, many of which are severely deformed, some lacking nuclei. It is probable that such aberrant pollen
would give rise to defects in pollen germination, and
indeed, though the germination rate is similar between
AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants and wild-type
plants, about 10% of the pollen grains from AtrabD2b/
2c double mutant plants are unable to geminate.
Furthermore, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant pollen
tubes do not grow apically as well as do wild-type pollen
tubes and tend to have swollen tips and a shorter
length; this phenotype is substantially more severe in
AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. In addition, some pollen
tubes from AtrabD2b/2c double mutants branch or
burst, which is not seen in pollen tubes of wild-type
plants or either single mutant. These data also indicate
that the loss of function of the AtRabD2b/2c genes cannot be compensated for by the AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a
genes, suggesting that either some function(s) of the
AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins are distinct from
those of AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a, or that they are not
expressed in the same cell types.
Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c co-localize with the
Golgi marker ST-YFP upon transient expression in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, as was reported also for
AtRabD2a (formerly called AtRab1b) [15]. It is therefore
possible that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c function in vesicle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, as
does AtRabD2a [15,22]. Complete disruption of Rab
function in ER-to-Golgi trafficking is expected to be
lethal, due to loss of plasma membrane, vacuole and cell
wall assembly and integrity. However, the AtrabD2b/2c
double mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type plants,
except for shorter siliques due to the pollen and pollen
tube defects. There are several possible explanations for
this. First, other AtRabs must perform the same function
in vegetative tissue. The most likely candidates are
AtRabD2a and AtRabD1, which could compensate for
the loss of function in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant in most
cell types [22]. Moreover, other Rab families, such as
tobacco RabBs (NtRab2s) have also been shown to be
regulators of membrane trafficking between the ER and
Golgi apparatus [16]. AtRabBs (AtRab2s) may have the
same function, such that they also participate in ER to
Golgi vesicle trafficking. The pattern of AtRabB1b RNA
accumulation is most highly correlated with that of
AtRabD2b (67%) and AtRabD2c (68%) (Additional file 1,
Table S1). These genes might compensate in part for the
loss of function of AtrabD2b/2c.

Second, pollen tubes grow very rapidly compared with
many other cell types. Pollen tubes elongate by tip
growth, whereby the pollen cytoplasm is confined to the
most proximal region of the tube, and growth is
restricted to the tube apex [35]. In vitro, lily pollen
tubes grow at about 150 nm/sec [35] and Arabidopsis
pollen tubes at 37 nm/sec [36]; in vivo, tobacco pollen
can grow at 42 nm/sec [37]. This fast growth is contingent on rapid vesicle trafficking to deliver large amounts
of membrane and cell wall components to the apical
region of the tubes. This extensive trafficking requirement may preclude the remaining Rabs from completely
compensating for loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c.
Third, computational analysis of public microarray
data, together with studies of the expression pattern
directed by the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c promoters,
indicated that both are widely expressed in most organs
and several cell types, with high expression in pollen.
Root hairs also showed expression of AtRabD2b, and,
like pollen tubes, root hairs elongate by tip growth.
However, root hair growth in the AtrabD2b/2c double
mutant is indistinguishable from that of wild-type
plants. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b
and AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking in
multiple cell types, and that the highest demand for this
process may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order to
optimally support the large secretory requirement of
these very rapidly elongating cells. In combination, these
data indicate that the high expression of AtRabD2b and
AtRabD2c in pollen may be important to facilitate
membrane trafficking needed for pollen tube growth.

Conclusions
In summary, we used a T-DNA insertion mutant
approach to demonstrate the function of AtRabD2b and
AtRabD2c. Our data indicated that both are Golgi residents; they have similar but not identical expression
patterns, but are both highly expressed in pollen; they
are both involved in tip growth of pollen tubes; and
they are at least partially functionally redundant. Future
work will focus on elucidating the molecular basis for
the pollen phenotype in the AtrabD2b/2c double
mutant.

Screening for T-DNA insertion mutants

In vitro pollen germination and growth measurement

T-DNA insertion mutants of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c
(Salk_045030 (AtrabD2b-1), Salk_117532 (AtrabD2b-2)
and Salk_120116 (AtrabD2b-3) for AtrabD2b;
Salk_054626 (AtrabD2c-3) for AtrabD2c) were obtained
from ABRC [38]. Homozygous lines for T-DNA insertions were identified by PCR genotyping. For each
T-DNA insertion mutant, two sets of PCRs were performed using genomic DNA as a template: one with a
gene-specific primer and a T-DNA left border primer
LBb1, the second with two gene-specific primers. The
PCR products were sequenced to confirm the locations
of the T-DNA insertion sites for all of the mutants. The
gene specific primers used are listed in Table 2.

Pollen was obtained from flowers collected from Arabidopsis plants (ten plant lines per genotype) 1 to 2 weeks
after bolting. Pollen from AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and
AtrabD2c mutants, along with pollen from wild-type
plants, was germinated on agar medium containing 18%
(w/v) sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) boric acid, 1mM MgSO 4 ,
1mM CaCl2 , 1mM Ca(NO3 ) 2, and 0.5% (w/v) agar, pH
7.0 [39] overnight at room temperature and examined
and photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan II compound
microscope equipped with an AxioCam color digital
camera. Measurements were performed using SIS Pro
software (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) using the bars in the original image. For pollen tube length measurements, 200
pollen tubes were chosen randomly for each genotype,
and significance was assessed using Studentâs t-test.
For fluorescence microscopy, the germinated pollen
was transferred onto a slide and two drops of aniline
blue solution (0.005% aniline blue solution in 0.1 M
sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were added for ten minutes.
To confirm the pollen tube growth defects, 20 open
flowers per genotype were cut below the pistil and inserted
vertically into germination medium in a 9-cm Petri dish.
Plates were sealed and incubated overnight at 22Â°C at
100% humidity under continuous illumination. The paths
of pollen tubes inside the pistils were visualized by fixing
whole pistils in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under
low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for 2 h at room temperature.
Samples were washed three times in the same buffer and
stained with Aniline Blue and DAPI. The tissue was then
cleared for 24 hours at room temperature with a drop of
clearing solution (240 g of chloral hydrate and 30 g of glycerol in 90 ml water). Pollen was examined with a Zeiss
Axioplan 2 light microscope (LM) and images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCamHRc digital camera (Carl
Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) using AxioVision 4.3 software. The microscope was equipped with a DAPI filter set
comprising an excitation filter (BP 365/12 nm), a beam
splitter (395 nm), and an emission filter (LP 397 nm). The
objectives used for imaging were a Neofluar 40Ã oil, an
Apochromat 63Ã oil, and a Neofluar 100Ã oil.

Crossing and screening for double mutant

Single mutant alleles (AtrabD2b-1 and AtrabD2c-1;
Figure 1A) were crossed, the F1 generation of these
crosses was allowed to self fertilization and the
AtrabD2b/2c double mutant was identified from the F2
generation by PCR genotyping.
Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR

Total RNA was extracted from leaves of 20 DAI (days
after imbibition) plants using the TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using SuperScriptâ¢ III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen,) as
per the manufacturerâs manual. The b-tubulin gene,
which is highly conserved and constitutively expressed
in all eukaryotes, was used as a standard. The primers
used are listed in Table 2. The RT-PCR products were
sequenced to confirm the correct amplification
product.

D vector (Invitrogen), and then were transferred into the
pMDC123 binary vector for plant transformation.
Plant transformation and selection

Arabidopsis plants were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens by the floral dip method [40] and
selected for Basta resistance conferred by the T-DNA.
Transcriptomic analysis

MetaOmGraph (MOG; http://www.metnetdb.org) [25]
was used to analyze expression patterns of AtRabD1,
AtRabD2a, AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c and derive the
correlation between them.
GUS assay

Transgenic T2 seedlings were germinated in soil and harvested at various stages of development. Plants or organs
were stained at room temperature overnight as described
[41], then destained in 70% (v/v) ethanol. For each construct, at least 7 independently transformed lines, 7 plants
for each stage, were harvested for GUS screening.
Transient expression in protoplasts

Transient gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll
protoplasts was carried out as described previously [42].
In brief, Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated from the
leaves of 3-4 week old plants. Leaf strips were digested
in a buffer containing cellulose R-10 and macerozyme
R-10. After adding 30 Î¼g of plasmid DNA, an equal
volume of protoplasts was mixed with PEG buffer (40%
(w/v) PEG4000, 25% (v/v) 0.8M mannitol, 10% 1M
CaCl2) then incubated at room temperature for 25 min.
After gentle washing, the protoplasts were kept in the
dark at room temperature overnight and then viewed by
confocal laser scanning microscopy as described below.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy

Colocalization of GFP-RabD2b and GFP-RabD2c with
ST-YFP was performed using a Leica TCS SP10 confocal microscope, which allows flexible selection of emission bandwidths to minimize bleed-through.
Transformed cells were excited with a 488 nm laser
(power 20%) and 514 nm laser (50% power), and GFP
and YFP signals were collected using 495-510 nm and
560-640 nm bandwidths, respectively. Non-transformed
cells and cells expressing a single GFP or YFP fusion
were used as controls to confirm the absence of cross
talk between GFP, YFP and autofluorescence signals.
Scanning electron microscopy

Pollen that had been germinated in vitro was placed in
2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, under low vacuum

(18 psi Hg) for 5 h at room temperature. Samples were
washed three times in the same buffer, postfixed in 1%
osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h and washed
two times in the same buffer, followed by deionized
water. Samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100%; 30 min per step),
followed by two changes of ultrapure 100% ethanol, all
30 min per step. Fresh pollen was also examined without fixing. Fixed samples were critical point-dried in a
DCP-1 Denton critical-point-drying apparatus (http://
www.dentonvacuum.com) using liquid carbon dioxide,
and mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sided
sticky pads and silver cement.
Samples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm gold
(20%) and palladium (80%) in a Denton Vacuum LLC
Desk II Cold Sputter Unit (http://www.dentonvacuum.
com), and viewed with a JEOL 5800LV SEM (http://www.
jeol.com) at 10 kV. Alternatively, released fresh pollen
grains were directly mounted on stubs and sputter-coated
with gold particles before SEM analysis. All digitally collected images including the LM and SEM images were
processed in Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and made into plates
using Adobe Illustrator 10. Over 20 samples from each
plant line were used for SEM or LM analysis.
