Abstract
Background: Geminiviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that cause serious crop losses
worldwide. Successful infection by these pathogens depends extensively on virus-host
intermolecular interactions that allow them to express their gene products, to replicate their
genomes and to move to adjacent cells and throughout the plant.
Results: To identify host genes that show an altered regulation in response to Cabbage leaf curl
virus (CaLCuV) infection, a screening of transposant Arabidopsis thaliana lines was carried out.
Several genes were identified to be virus responsive and one, Crumpled leaf (CRL) gene, was selected
for further characterization. CRL was previously reported by Asano et al., (2004) to affect the
morphogenesis of all plant organs and the division of plastids. We report here that CRL expression,
during CaLCuV infection, shows a short but strong induction at an early stage (3-5 days post
inoculation, dpi). To study the role of CRL in CaLCuV infection, CRL over-expressing and silenced
transgenic plants were generated. We compared the replication, movement and infectivity of
CaLCuV in transgenic and wild type plants.
Conclusion: Our results showed that CRL over-expressing plants showed an increased
susceptibility to CaLCuV infection (as compared to wt plants) whereas CRL-silenced plants, on the
contrary, presented a reduced susceptibility to viral infection. The possible role of CRL in the
CaLCuV infection cycle is discussed.

Background
Geminiviruses are a large and diverse family of plant
viruses that are packed as single-stranded, circular DNA
genomes and characterized by virions (or capsides) with
twin icosahedral morphology and a replication process
based on rolling circle and recombination-dependent
mechanisms [1-3]. The family Geminiviridae is taxonomi-

cally divided in four genera according to their range, insect
vector, phylogenetic relatedness and genome organization (mono- or bipartite) [4]. The genus Begomovirus is the
largest one and comprises all whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses that infect dicotyledonous plants [5]. DNA A of a
typical bipartite begomovirus encodes four/five proteins:
Rep and REn involved in replication; AC4, encoding a

suppressor of silencing; TrAP involved in transcriptional
activation and silencing suppression and CP, the coat protein. DNA B encodes the movement protein (MP) and the
nuclear shuttle protein (NSP), both required for systemic
infection [4,5]. Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) is a bipartite begomovirus that infects a broad range of members of
the Brassicaceae including cabbage, cauliflower and Arabidopsis thaliana [6].
Successful infection by a geminivirus, as any other virus,
depends on its ability to express its gene products, to replicate its genome and to move to adjacent cells. Accordingly, the geminivirus infection cycle has been shown to
depend extensively on virus-host intermolecular interactions, which are required either for basic compatibility or
for modulation of virus infection by subverting defense
responses [7]. In two cases, virus replication has been
reported in differentiated cells, which do not contain
detectable levels of replicative polymerases, and, therefore, should not be competent for DNA replication [8,9].
Consequently, it has been suggested that an early step in a
geminivirus infection process is a reprogramming of plant
cell-cycle controls to induce the synthesis of the host DNA
replication machinery [10,11]. Viral movement requires
the action of virus-encoded movement proteins to coordinate the replication of the viral genome with its cell-to-cell
transport [12,13]. The nuclear localization of geminivirus
during replication implies that two movement steps must
be achieved for systemic infection, one to move the viral
genome from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then,
another one to allow a cell-to-cell movement across the
cell walls [12,14].
According to current models, viral infection affects the
expression of many plant genes both temporally and spatially [15]. Some genes may show altered patterns of gene
expression in response to virus infection due to the activation of the defense mechanisms against the invading pathogen [16,17]. In addition, changes in host gene expression
may also occur when cellular functions are redirected to
support the synthesis of viral nucleic acids and proteins,
resulting in changes in plant metabolism and often, the
development of symptoms [18,19]. Research on plant
virus-host interactions is currently providing considerable
insights into the mechanism by which viruses interact
with host proteins. Several proteins are known to be interacting with viral proteins in the infected cell. For example,
it has been shown that Rep from Tomato golden mosaic virus
(TGMV) interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma
(pRB) in order to reprogram the host cell cycle to create a
replication-competent environment [20]. In the case of
Wheat dwarf virus (WDV), it has been suggested that Rep
interacts with the replication factor C (RFC). This interaction may represent an early step in the assembly of an

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/169

elongation complex during geminivirus DNA-primed
DNA replication [21].
Most of the proteins known to interact with viral proteins
have been identified using two hybrid systems or pulldown assays [21-24]. These interactions do not identify
those genes that are up or down-regulated as a consequence of a viral infection, but whose products do not
necessarily directly interact with viral proteins. That is the
reason why a better understanding of the transcriptional
changes occurring during the initial events of a virus infection could provide relevant insights into how plants recognize and respond to viruses, and how these pathogens
cause disease.
Microarray analyses have been shown to be a powerful
methodology to identify host genes whose expression is
altered during an infection by a geminivirus [25]. Nevertheless, there are cases in which affected genes would not
be detected because a dilution effect due to a highly localized expression, a low number of infected cells, or even
due to an inappropriate timing for RNA sample collection.
In an attempt to identify host genes whose expression is
modified in the early events of a geminiviral infection, we
screened an Arabidopsis thaliana collection transformed
with transposon-based, enhancer- or gene-trap vectors
(MET or MGT). The enhancer-/gene-trap elements carry a
reporter gene construct that can respond to cis-acting transcriptional signal at the insertion site [26-28]. These elements permit the identification of genes by their pattern
of expression and their subsequent cloning using the
inserted element as a tag [26]. This system can be adapted
easily to a large scale for identification of pathogen
responsive genes.
Using this methodology we have identified a sequence
corresponding to the Crumpled Leaf gene (CRL). A crl
mutant exhibits a symptom-like phenotype similar to the
one observed in geminivirus-infected A. thaliana: dwarfing, chlorotic mottle, yellow mosaic and crumpled leaves
[29].
We analyzed CRL expression in wild-type infected plants
and used RNA-interference methodology (RNAi) and
ectopic expression in Arabidopsis as efficient forward
genetic approaches to analyze the function of the CRL
gene. Results suggest that CRL is involved in the infective
process since altering CRL levels altered susceptibility to
CaLCuV infection.

Results
Screening and identification of virus-infection inducible
genes
A total of 506 transposant lines were analyzed: 273 MGT
and 233 MET lines. For each line, a total of 40 seeds were
germinated at 22°C in a controlled environment chamber. Plants at 6-8 leaves stage were inoculated with CaLCuV DNA in a single leaf using a hand-held biolistic
device. As wound control for the biolistic inoculation,
plants from each line were mock-inoculated with emptyplasmid DNA or with gold particles with no DNA. The
effect of the inoculation was studied by excising bombarded leaves at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-inoculation (dpi)
to be assayed for GUS activity by histochemical staining
(6 plants per assay).

After the assays, 11 lines that showed an up-regulation of
GUS expression after virus inoculation (but not after a
mock inoculation control) were selected for further analysis. Ten of these lines were from the gene-trap collection
whereas only 1 line was from the enhancer-trap collection. The remaining 495 lines included those that did not
show GUS expression at all (306 lines), lines that did not
change their GUS expression patterns after infection (168
lines), or lines that showed an altered GUS expression due
to a wound-response (i.e., responsive to both, virus- and
mock-inoculation, 22 lines).
To identify the insertion site of the transposon and, therefore, the tagged genes, thermal asymmetric interlaced
(TAIL)-PCR was performed as described [30]. After the
identification of tagged genes, the CRUMPLED LEAF
(CRL)-tagging line (MGT 208) was selected for further
analysis since a crl mutant exhibits an interesting phenotype that resembles, in a mild form, the symptoms
observed in virus-infected plants. In addition, no correlation with a biotic stress has been reported for this gene
[29,31]. An extended analysis of the gene/enhancer trap
strategy to identify pathogen-related genes, the protocol
for the screening and the type of identified tagged genes
responsive to geminivirus infection is being presented
elsewhere (Trejo-Saavedra et al., in preparation).
CRL expression is modified by viral DNA
The expression of CRL in CaLCuV-infected plants was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Arabidopsis thaliana plants at
the 6-8 leaves stage were inoculated with CaLCuV DNA by
a biolistic procedure (Figure 1e). Inoculated and systemic
leaves (leaves that appeared after the inoculation) were
collected at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post inoculation (dpi). Total
RNA was extracted from leaves and compared with similar
leaves from two types of control plants: mock-inoculated
and untreated (not bombarded) plants. To eliminate possible contamination by genomic DNA, PCR primers were
designed to be located in different exons; therefore, the

As seen in figure 2a, the concentration of CRL RNA
increases after infection with a peak around 5 dpi and a
decrease to basal levels at 7-9 dpi. In an attempt to corroborate this expression, 11 independent, transgenic lines
containing a 883 bp version of CRL promoter (883 nt)
fused to GUS marker gene (pCRL::UidA lines) were
obtained. Unfortunately, with this promoter version, the
GUS expression in all plants (inoculated and non inoculated controls) was relatively high, thus, it was rather dif-

ficult to appreciate differences between treatments using
this histochemical procedure (data not shown). To corroborate the expression of CRL and the presence of the
virus, a parallel viral RNA assay was also performed. Figure 2b, shows the RT-PCR quantification of viral RNA
using primers located inside the rep ORF. Interestingly,
both RNA types, viral and CRL, showed a similar pattern.
However, the peak of viral RNA concentration seems to
precede the peak of CRL RNA, suggesting a cause-effect
relationship.
Generation of CRL-expressing (35S-CRL) and silenced
(CRL-RNAi) lines
To study the involvement of CRL in CaLCuV infection, we
carried out experiments based on loss- and gain-of-function strategies. For the loss-of-function assays, we silenced
the CRL gene in Arabidopsis plants making a CRL-RNAi
construct. The complete CRL ORF was cloned in both orientations into a pFGC5941 RNAi vector that contains the
strong 35S promoter of the Cauliflower mosaic virus
(CaMV35S) (Figure 1b). The vector was then used to
transform wild-type Col-0 plants. A total of 45 primary

transformant plants were generated, showing different
classes of phenotypes. Previous studies targeting endogenous genes with similar RNAi strategies have been shown
to produce a series of mutant phenotypes that vary from
weak phenotypes to phenotypes resembling known null
mutants of the targeted gene [32-35]. The 45 lines were
grouped into three classes: 20 lines (44.4%) showed no
altered phenotype. Eight lines (17.7%) showed a weak
phenotype that consisted of a slightly crumpled leaf phenotype. The final group of 17 plants (37.7%) showed
crumpled leaves, dwarf plant and pale green phenotype
(Figure 3), consistent with the previously reported null
mutant [29]. It is important to mention that the phenotypes observed in the silenced lines were clearly distinguishable from the symptoms induced by CaLCuV as
discussed below. Interestingly, under certain conditions
(8 h light/16 h dark photoperiod, 24 C), the last group of
plants also showed an additional phenotype. Small
rosette-like structures were observed instead of flowering
stems. New stems developed from those rosettes (Figure

3d, e) confirming the equivalence of the structure. This
phenotype, not observed under normal greenhouse conditions, was maintained in the T2 generation. This additional phenotype was not reported with the null mutant
probably due to the requirement of a short photoperiod
condition [29]. More recently, it has been shown that crl
mutant Arabidopsis plants contain cells lacking detectable
plastids [31]. The alteration in the generation of cells lacking plastids might be responsible for the phenotype
observed.
For the gain-of-function approach, we over-expressed CRL
gene using a modified version of the pFGC5941 vector
that contained the CaMV35S promoter directing the sense
expression of CRL ORF sequence (Figure 1c). A total of 61
over-expressing primary transformed plants were generated. All lines showed an intense green colour when compared with the wild type (Figure 3b, g), however, no
additional morphological differences were observed
between wild type and CaMV35S-CRL lines.
To corroborate the relationship between the observed
phenotypes and the level of CRL transcript, total RNA was
extracted from rosette leaves from two independent lines
from each strategy: CaMV35S-CRL and CRL-RNAi. In the
case of the silenced lines, we selected plants (T2) showing
a strong phenotype. Figure 4 shows the results of an RTPCR analysis of CRL transcripts in both cases. Compared
to wild type (wt) plants, the analyzed CaMV35S-CRL lines
(T2-1 and T2-7) indeed showed a substantial increase in
CRL transcript levels. On the other hand, the CRL-RNAi
lines (T2-4 and T2-5), which exhibited a strong phenotype, showed reduced transcript levels (Figure 4a). A
northern blot analysis was also performed to corroborate
the altered expression (Figure 4b). The presence of small
interfering RNAs (siRNA, 21-23 nt long) has been suggested as a hallmark of a silencing process affecting a given
gene. Therefore, the presence of siRNAs related to CRL was
analyzed in RNA extracts from silenced and wt lines. The
results are also shown in figure 4. -tubulin was used as a
constitutive control to show that equal amounts of RNA
were used. CRL-related siRNAs were detected in RNA
extracts from line CRL-RNAi T2-5 line but not in those
from wt plant (Figure 4c), suggesting the degradation of
the CRL transcript by RNA silencing mechanism [36].

infect wt, CRL over-expressing and silenced plants. Thirty
plants at the 6-8 leaves stage of each type were inoculated
on the apical tissue by a biolistic method. After inoculation, plants were evaluated daily for typical symptom
expression. As shown in figure 5, the final percentage of
plants expressing symptoms upon CaLCuV challenge,
evaluated at 12 days after inoculation (dpi), was 30% for
CRL-RNAi plants (T2-5 line), 100% for CaMV35S-CRL
plants (T2-1 line) and 85% in the case of wt plants. In
addition to present the highest inoculation efficiency,
CRL over-expressing plants also developed symptoms two
days earlier than wt and CRL silenced plants. Since the
inoculation efficiency is practically 100% under the conditions used in these experiments, the lack of symptoms is
probably due to inefficient replication and/or movement
processes in the inoculated plants. Indeed, as mentioned
below, viral DNA was detected, although at low concentrations in those symptomless, CRL-RNAi plants.

Interestingly, although the 3 types of plants showed differences in the efficiency to develop symptoms as well as in
the time needed for symptom appearance, the severity of
the symptoms induced by CaLCuV was similar at all cases.

However it has to be mentioned that CRL silenced plants
showed a characteristic phenotype.
A Southern blot analysis was carried out to compare the
concentration of viral DNA as well as the replicative forms
found in the 3 types of plants. CaMV35S-CRL T2-1, CRLRNAi T2-5 and wild-type plants were inoculated with CaLCuV DNA (both components) by biolistic method and
inoculated and systemic leaves (leaves that appeared after
the inoculation) were collected at 5, 8 and 12 dpi. Total
DNA was extracted and hybridized against a full-length
DNA A probe. Southern blot results showed similar geminiviral DNA forms in extracts from all three types of
plants indicating that viral replication was carried out in a
similar manner (Figure 6). In terms of viral DNA concentration, however, some differences were observed. The
hybridization revealed that the viral concentration at 5
dpi, although relatively low, was also very similar in both
types of transgenic (over-expressing and silenced) lines
and wt plants. As shown in figure 5, at this time point,
50% of the inoculated, CRL over-expressing plants had
developed symptoms whereas wt and silenced plants have
not developed yet any symptoms. At 8 dpi, all CRL overexpressing plants were already showing symptoms

whereas only 20% of the silenced plants developed symptoms. In the case of the wt, almost 80% of the plants were
symptomatic. As shown in figure 6, viral concentration in
wt and CRL over-expressing plants at 8 dpi were similar
whereas silenced plants showed a somewhat reduction of
viral DNA concentration.
At 12 dpi, most of the silenced plants remained symptomless and their concentration of viral DNA was greatly
reduced compared to the levels found in either, wt or
over-expressing plants. Additionally, one of the few
silenced plants that developed virus-induced symptoms
was also analyzed. The viral DNA levels in this case were
similar to the also symptomatic plants from the other two
types, wt and over-expressing (Figure 6, lane SS).
Although the plants of the silenced line evaluated belong
to the T2 generation, it is clear that there is some type of
"segregation" or variation of the silencing level, therefore,
in those plants in which the silencing is not complete, the
virus is able to replicate and move as in a wt plant.
At this moment is not possible to determine if the differences in viral DNA concentration are due to a reduced,
virus replication rate, to a less efficient virus movement or
a combination of both processes. However, two observations suggest a defect in viral movement. First, the concentrations of viral DNA in the early stage of infection are
similar in all 3 types of plants. Second, the concentrations
of viral DNA in wt and CaMV35S-CRL T2-1 plants were
similar at all time points analyzed. This suggests that the

differences observed in the CRL over-expressing plants in
relation to wt line (early appearance of symptoms and
increased percentage of symptomatic plants) were not due
to an improved viral replication.
CaLCuV movement is affected in CRL-RNAi T2-5 and
supported in CaMV35S-CRL T2-1 lines
To confirm that CRL is involved in viral movement, we
inserted the ORF for the green fluorescent protein (GFP)
into CaLCuV A component generating a CaLCuV:GFP
fusion. In this construct, the GFP ORF partially replaced
the coat protein (CP) ORF; therefore, its expression will be
driven by CP promoter (Figure 1d). It has been reported
that CP is not required for CaLCuV replication and movement in Arabidopsis [37]. Wt and both types of transgenic
plants were inoculated with a mixture of CaLCuV A-GFP
and CaLCuV-B (Figure 1e). Inoculated and systemic leaves
(leaves that appeared after the inoculation) were observed
with a fluorescence microscope at 5, 8 and 12 dpi using
short-wave blue light (460 to 490 nm). Under these conditions, chlorophyll and GFP show a distinguishable fluorescence (red and yellow-green, respectively). Mock and
not inoculated plants were used as controls.

GFP fluorescence was clearly detected in all inoculated
leaves of the three type of plants analyzed: wt, CaMV35SCRL and CRL-RNAi. This confirmed that the modified
virus was able to replicate and express GFP. None of the
mock-inoculated plants showed GFP fluorescence, confirming that the green fluorescence was indeed due to the
presence of the virus fusion.
To verify the long distance movement of the virus in the
infected plants, systemic, non-inoculated leaves were also
analyzed under the fluorescence microscope. At 5 dpi,
inoculated wt plants had not develop symptoms, however, it was possible to detect GFP fluorescence on the systemic leaves analyzed. GFP fluorescence was also detected
in the systemic leaves from the inoculated CaMV35S-CRL
over-expressing plants (Figure 7). It is important to note
that in this case, on the contrary to wt plants, the plants
had already started to display the symptoms of CaLCuV
infection. On the other hand, GFP fluorescence was
almost undetectable on the systemic leaves from the CRLRNAi silenced plants; only a few isolated cells displayed a
low level of fluorescence. As already mention, at this time
period most of the CRL-RNAi plants remain symptomless.
Similar results were obtained at 8 and 12 dpi. A general
observation, however is that intensity of the fluorescence
was lower when compared with that observed at 5 dpi
(Figure 7). These results confirmed that the CaLCuV
movement was affected in the CRL-RNAi T2-5 line, suggesting that CRL protein is involved for viral movement
mentioned.

Discussion
Enhancer and gene trap lines have been shown to be useful tools for evaluating gene expression modifications in
several stresses and pathogen infections [28]. Trap lines
have been also used to identify senescence-associated
genes [38], oxygen deprivation-regulated genes [39],
genes associated to seed germination [40] and female
gametogenesis [41,42]. We report here the use of gene
trap lines for the identification of genes whose expression
is modified during CaLCuV infection. Although our
genetic screen is far from reaching saturation, these results
indicate the large potential for the identification of genes
that respond to CaLCuV infection following our experimental strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first report
that documents the identification of geminivirus-responsive genes using A. thaliana gene trap lines.
Using a screen of MGT lines, we have identified genes
whose expression is modified upon CaLCuV inoculation.
A further characterization of a selected candidate has
resulted in the demonstration that the gene CRUMPLED
LEAF (CRL) is involved in the infective cycle of the virus.
CRL has been previously reported as involved in the morphogenesis of all plant organs and the division of plastids
[29]. It was also reported that in a crl mutant, the planes
of cell division are distorted in shoot apical meristems,
root tips and embryos. In addition, the mutant is dwarf
and present pale green and crumpled leaves. CRL protein
was observed associated with plastid membranes and,
more recently, it has been shown that a crl A. thaliana
mutant present cells without detectable plastids [29,31].
Although CRL protein is conserved in various species of
dicots, monocots and cyanobacterias, no similarity to proteins with predicted or known function has been reported.
The usefulness of gene trap technology to identify genes
responsive to viral infections is additionally supported by
the fact that the CRL gene was not identified in screenings
designed to detect genes regulated during different virus
infections (including CaLCuV) using A. thaliana microarrays and sDNA-AFLP analysis (AffyID 24849_at; gene At5
g51020) [25,43-45]. The variety of results observed in the
screening also suggests that viral induction of some genes
can be a highly localized process (in time or space), thus,
those genes could be easily missed in analysis with some
methodologies (microarrays, differential libraries) due to
a dilution of the mRNAs or an inappropriate timing for
sample collection.
Viruses can alter the transcriptional networks of their host
[18,46]. In the case of Arabidopsis, changes in host gene
expression have been documented in different stages of
the infection by several types of viruses including caulimoviruses (CaMV), cucumoviruses (CMV), tobamoviruses (TVCV), potexviruses (PVX), potyviruses (PVY), and

Fluorescence analysis
Fluorescence analysis. Fluorescence analysis of CaMV35S-CRL T2-1, CRL-RNAi T2-5 and wild-type plants inoculated with
CaLCuV:GFP (both components are present). Representative results from each line and time are shown. Samples taken from
symptomatic leaves are marked with asterisk. 35S::GFP was used as a control. GFP expression was observed by using a fluorescent microscope (× 10). Bars = 100 m.

more recently by geminiviruses [44,47,48] with a wide
array of cellular processes that likely reflect the biochemical and physiological changes involved in the development of the disease syndrome. As mentioned before, none
of those reports included CRL as a virus-induced gene.
The expression of CRL in CaLCuV-infected plants shows
an interesting pattern. In terms of the type of response, a
short but strong induction, it resembles the one observed

with early response genes associated to WRKY-type transcription factors [49]. However, early response is usually
observed in a matter of minutes, not days as observed
with CRL. Consistently, an analysis of the CRL promoter
did not revealed any WRKY (TTGAC) boxes. In terms of
timing (3-5 days after inoculation), the response associated with the one reported for PR-1, a common molecular
marker for systemic acquired resistance (SAR) [16,17].
However, PR-1 expression, unlike CRL remains high for a

longer period with a plateau-type of response whereas
CRL expression sharply goes down to basal levels around
7 dpi.
Silencing and over-expressing a gene are common strategies to study its function. In the case of CRL, its constitutive expression did not produce an informative phenotype
(Figure 3b and 3g) even though the levels of CRL transcript were higher than the levels observed in wt plants. In
general, the plants were basically similar to wt although
some plants showed larger size than the wt. The lack of a
phenotype after over-expressing a single gene is not
uncommon and it has been suggested that the plasticity of
the plant metabolism can balance most cases of ectopic
expression. Nevertheless, the over-expressing lines did
show some differences in the inoculation experiments
since they developed symptoms 2-3 days earlier than wt
plants. This enhanced susceptibility was also reflected in
the percentage of inoculated plants that became infected.
This suggested that CRL might somehow facilitate the
establishment of the infection or the spread of the CaLCuV. At this point, it is not possible to differentiate which
of the basic processes in an infective cycle, replication or
movement, is affected in the over-expressing lines.
In contrast to the results obtained with the over-expressing lines, a gradient of phenotypes were observed in the
silenced, CRL-RNAi lines. The strongest phenotype was
similar to the one observed by Asano et al. [29,31]. This
phenotype resembles the symptoms observed in a viral
infection (crumpling and deformation of leaves). However, it has to be mentioned that in the case of CaLCuVinfected Arabidopsis, there were noticeable differences
between the phenotype of the silenced plant and the one
observed in a CaLCuV-infected one. In this second case,
the severity of the symptoms was stronger and plant development was affected resulting in a small size. The range of
phenotypes observed in the silenced lines has been
observed in many systems targeting endogenous genes
and it has been attributed to the differences in the silencing efficiency [32-35,41,42].
In addition to the phenotype observed in the silenced
lines, these plants also presented some differences with wt
plants when challenged with CaLCuV. The time for symptom appearance was basically similar in both cases, however, the number of CRL-silenced plants that became
infected was considerably lower than the number
observed for wt and over-expressing lines. By 12 dpi, only
30% of the inoculated plants showed symptoms whereas
in the case of wt or over-expressing lines the percentage
obtained was dramatically higher (80-100%). In many
cases, a brief delay in symptom appearance or lower infection efficiency has been reported as a degree of resistance,
or tolerance to viral infection. Therefore, the lack of CRL

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/169

protein confers an interesting characteristic for biotechnological developments, although it applicability is currently limited due to the phenotype showed by the
silenced lines.
Southern blot analysis demonstrated that neither the lack
of CRL completely prevents CaLCuV replication nor does
its over-expression result in an increased viral replication.
In the first case, viral replicative forms were still detected,
although at a lower concentration, in the symptomless
plants (70% of the inoculated plants) at 12-15 dpi. Systemic tissue analyzed by PCR at 30 dpi shown no viral
DNA. This suggested that CaLCuV is still able to replicate
and move, although the overall infective process seems
highly hindered. It has to be mentioned that the plants
that did develop symptoms (30%) did show viral DNA
concentration equivalent to that observed in wt plants. In
the case of the over-expressing plants, viral DNA concentration was also similar to the one found in infected wt
plants suggesting that in this case the ectopic expression of
CRL protein does not affect virus cycle.
These results and the fact that CRL has been reported as a
membrane protein suggested its possible involvement in
facilitating the movement of the virus. To evaluate this
hypothesis, viral movement analyzes were carried out
using a CaLCuV A-GFP construct. In the case of the CRLsilenced plants fluorescence spots were observed solely at
inoculation sites indicating a deficient movement of the
modified virus in those plants. On the other hand, GFP
fluorescence was observed in systemic tissues in both
CaMV35S-CRL and wt plants, although it was common to
detect GFP fluorescence a day earlier in the case of the
over-expressing plants.

Conclusion
In order to carry out a successful infection, a virus must
spread between cells moving from their replication sites at
cell periphery and then traverse intercellular channels to
enter the neighbouring cell until the vascular system is
reached for its long-distance transport. Cell-to-cell transport of most plant viruses is mediated by specific virally
encoded factors termed movement proteins (MPs). However, most of the cell-to-cell transport machinery is provided by the host cell [7,50]. Many host plant proteins
that bind viral MPs have been identified [51] and several
of them have been shown to influence viral movement
[52-57]. Geminiviruses, and other DNA viruses, might
have some particular differences in the mechanisms to
spread throughout an infected plant when compared to
RNA viruses. A major difference is the nuclear replication,
although the nature of the genome itself (RNA vs. DNA)
might have influence also [4]. Several studies using the
two-hybrid system have provided evidence of interactions
between geminivirus movement proteins (MP and NSP)

Virology Journal 2009, 6:169

and host proteins [58,59]. It is not clear at the moment, if
CRL protein interacts with either one or both of the geminiviral proteins MP and NSP. Alignment analysis of CRL
sequence with its homologues in others plants indicates
the presence of one putative trans-membrane domain
localized between amino acids 16-21. CRL protein fused
to GFP was localized mainly in chloroplast [29]. However,
its association with other membranes cannot be discarded.
Based on the characteristics of CRL protein and the data
with CRL-silenced and CRL-expressing transgenic plants,
several possibilities for the involvement of CRL in the
geminivirus infective cycle can be envisioned. First,
although CRL has been reported as an outer envelope
membrane protein, it does not present an obvious transmembrane-chloroplast domain [29,31]. It is possible that
CRL could also be localized on the plasmatic membrane,
specifically in the plasmodesmata vicinity where,
throughout an interaction with viral proteins (e.g., MP)
could participate in viral transport [4].
Second, geminivirus might have evolved to adapt themselves to transport and/or communication pathways
important for plant metabolism, therefore, it is feasible
that viral movement can be affected by changes in cellular
metabolism, such as the ones occasioned by the modification of CRL expression. For example, it has been suggested
that the envelope membrane of plastids is the site of transport and exchange of ions and metabolites [60,61]. The
lack of CRL protein, then, could affect the efficiency of
processes such as the import of nuclear proteins involved
in generation of metabolites necessary for plant morphogenesis or even plastid division [29,31]. Those altered
processes, in turn, could affect virus cycle directly or indirectly by affecting other important cellular process in
which the virus relies to for its own transport. Therefore,
the effect on virus replication/movememnt observed in
CRL-silenced plants (important reduction but not total
block of replication) is likely to be a secondary effect after
plastid metabolism disruption.
It is clear, in any case, that further investigations are
required to elucidate: a) the precise molecular function of
CRL protein on geminiviral infection, b) the disease-like
phenotype observed in CRL-silenced plants, and c) if a
possible interaction between CRL and geminiviruses
exists because of the ancestral prokaryotic characteristic of
both, plastids [62,63] and geminiviruses [64-67].

Methods
Plant material and growth conditions
A collection of Enhancer- (MET) and Gene-Trap (MGT)
lines were generated in the Laboratory of Reproductive
Development and Apomixis, Cinvestav-Irapuato [42]. The

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/169

lines were selected in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium
containing 50 g/ml kanamycin. Primary transformant
seedlings CaMV35S-CRL and CRL-RNAi lines were
selected using 0.05% of BASTA herbicide. Subsequent
transformant generations were selected in MS medium
containing 50 or 10 g/ml glufosinate ammonium (Crescent chemical, Islandia, NY). After germination, seedlings
were grown on 3:1:1 Mix3-Sunshine (SunGro, Bellevue,
WA), vermiculite, and perlite (vol/vol/vol ratio) containing 1.84 Kg/m3 of 14-14-14 slow-release fertilizer (Osmocote, Sierra, Marysville, OH) in a controlled environment
chamber at 22°C with a photoperiod of 8 h of day and 16
h of dark.
DNA Isolation and TAIL-PCR
Total DNA was isolated by grinding inoculated tissue (68 leaves by plant) in liquid nitrogen in presence of buffer
CTAB [68]. For TAIL-PCR 5 ng of total DNA was used to
amplify the tagged sequences using the program and
primers described elsewhere [30].
Generation of CaLCuV A-GFP, RNAi, over-expressing,
pCRL::UidA constructs and transgenic plants
To generate the CaLCuV A-GFP, GFP gene was digested
from pCAT GFP [69] and cloned into pCPCbLCVA.007
[37] between XhoI and BglII restriction sites (Figure 1d). In
this construct the GFP gene is under the direction of the
CP promoter.

To generate the CaMV35S-CRL and CRL-RNAi lines, we
amplified a cDNA corresponding to CRUMPLE LEAF gene
(Accession no. At5 g51020) by RT-PCR, using the following primers, CRL-sense 5'-CGTCTAGAGGCGCGCCATGGGTACCGAGTCGGGT-3' (restriction sites XbaI and
AscI in boldface) and CRL-antisense 5'-CGGGATCCATTTAAATCTAGTCTTGCAAGATGAG-3' (restriction sites
BamHI and SwaI are shown in boldface). CRL cDNA was
cloned into TOPO-PCRII (Invitrogen) and correct insert
orientation was selected by restriction analysis (resulting
in pCRL-TOPO). For CRL-RNAi construct, we digested
pCRL-TOPO with BamHI to excise the CRL fragment to be
cloned into pFGC5941 vector (Figure 1a); the sense orientation construct (pre CRL-RNAi) was selected by restriction analysis [35]. To add the antisense CRL, pCRL-TOPO
was digested with AscI and XhoI and the CRL fragment was
subcloned into corresponding sites of pre CRL-RNAi plasmid (Figure 1b). To generate the CaMV35S-CRL (Figure
1c), the CHSA intron of pFGC5941 (Figure 1a) was
replaced by the CRL fragment obtained from pCRL-TOPO
digested with AscI and XbaI. To generate the pCRL::UidA,
we amplified 983 bp of CRL promoter sequence with the
followings primers, pCRL-sense 5'-GGGAAGCTTTCAGCAGAAGATG-3' (restriction site HindIII in boldface) and
pCRL-antisense TCTCTAGAGTGAGAGAACGAG (restriction site XbaI in boldface). The promoter fragment was

Virology Journal 2009, 6:169

cloned into TOPO-PCRII (Invitrogen) and subcloned into
pBI 101.2 vector. The CRL-RNAi, CaMV35S-CRL and
pCRL::UidA constructs were introduced into A. tumefaciens PGV2260, which was then used to transform A. thaliana (Col-0) by floral dip [70].
Analysis of GUS activity
GUS activity was assayed by histochemical staining as
described in [71]. Chlorophyll was cleared incubating the
leaves in Methanol-acetone (1:1 vol/vol) and imaged on a
Leica stereoscope.
Viral Inoculation
Plants at the six- to eight-leaves stage were inoculated by
biolistic delivery with a modified handheld, low-pressure
apparatus that allowed the targeting of a specific tissue
(leaf, rosette or apex). Individual leaves of transposant
plants were directly shot at 50 psi helium pressure with
golden particles (0.5 Micron, BioRad) covered with 200
ng of each viral DNA (pCPCbLCVA.007 and pCPCbLCVB.002, [37]); kindly provided by D. Robertson,
North Carolina State University) or with pBluescript for
mock-inoculations. For virus movement and symptom
development experiments, 20 plants (Figure 1e) of each
line were inoculated at the same conditions.

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/169

Total DNA was extracted as described by earlier [73]. Ten
micrograms of total DNA per well was loaded in a 1% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, DNA was transferred to
Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) by capillary action with a 10× solution of 0.15 M
NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate (SSC), and UVcrosslinked. The fragment (1090 bp) obtained after digestion with XhoI and NcoI of pCPCbLCVA.007 [37] was
used as probe. Probe was radioactively labelled using Redi
prime II Kit and (-32P) dCTP (Amersham). Hybridization was performed overnight at 65°C as described in
Rapid-hyb Kit protocol (Amersham). Membrane was then
washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate
(SDS), and twice in 0.2× SSC, 1% SDS, all at 65°C.
Hybridization signals were detected on a phosphorimager
system.
Northern blot and small RNAs detection
For northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted from
rosette (8-12 leaves stage) using Trizol (Invitrogen) and
following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of RNA were separated in a 1.3% agarose gel containing 17% formaldehyde and blotted onto hybond N+
membranes. Membrane was cross-linked using UV irradiation and hybridized at 65°C as described.

RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated grinding five rosettes (8-12 leaves)
from each time point (1, 3, 5, and 7 dpi) in liquid nitrogen in the presence of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life
Technologies). One g of total RNA was treated with
amplification-grade DNAse I (Life technologies) for 20
min; after heat inactivation, 500 ng was used to generate
cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life technologies) using oligo (dT)18.

For small RNA analysis, total RNA from rosette leaves
were enriched for low molecular weight RNAs using Hamilton's homogenization solution [74]. Low molecular
weight RNA was normalized by spectrophotometry to 100
g/lane, separated by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea, and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT
membranes (Bio-Rad). Membrane was cross-linked using
UV irradiation and hybridized at 50°C as described by
[75].

Real-time PCR for relative quantification was performed
in 20-l reactions using 0.5 l of cDNA (12.5 ng) along
with 1 l of each 10 M primer and 10 l of 2× Platinum
SYBR Green qPCR Super Mix UDG (Life technologies) in
a BioRad iCycler thermocycler. The following primers
were used for specific CRL cDNA amplification: QRTCRLsense (5'-GATCCTGATAATTACTTCAAC'), QRTCRL-antisense (5'-AACGGTTTCTGAGGAGTCCT-3'), AL2-sense
(5'-ACTACCAAAAATGCAAAATT-3'), AL1-antisense (5'CAGCTCTCCTTTTAGCAATC-3'). To normalize data, parallel amplifications of 16S rRNA were done as internal reference
with
primers
Actin-sense
(5'TCCCTCAGCACATTCCAGCAG-3') and Actin-antisense
(5'-AACGATTCCTGGACCTGCCTC-3'). Data analysis was
performed as described before [72].

GFP fluorescence analysis
GFP expression was monitored by using a fluorescence
stereoscope (Leica MZ8) with the set of filters GFP-Plus
(excitation filter: 480/40 nm; emission: 510 nm) and a
fluorescence microscope (Leica DMRE) with an excitation
filter (I3) BP 450-490 nm, a dichroic mirror at 510 nm
and an observation filter at 515 nm. Images were generated by using a digital camera (Spot Diagnostic Instruments) and edited by using Adobe Photoshop CS
software.

Southern blot analysis
Inoculated (6-8 leaves by plant) and systemic (4-6 leaves
by plant) tissue from six infected plants was sampling.
