Abstract
Background: The prevalence and the origin of HIV-1 subtype B, the most prevalent circulating
clade among the long-term residents in Europe, have been studied extensively. However the spatial
diffusion of the epidemic from the perspective of the virus has not previously been traced.
Results: In the current study we inferred the migration history of HIV-1 subtype B by way of a
phylogeography of viral sequences sampled from 16 European countries and Israel. Migration
events were inferred from viral phylogenies by character reconstruction using parsimony. With
regard to the spatial dispersal of the HIV subtype B sequences across viral phylogenies, in most of
the countries in Europe the epidemic was introduced by multiple sources and subsequently spread
within local networks. Poland provides an exception where most of the infections were the result
of a single point introduction. According to the significant migratory pathways, we show that there
are considerable differences across Europe. Specifically, Greece, Portugal, Serbia and Spain, provide
sources shedding HIV-1; Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, on the other hand, are migratory
targets, while for Denmark, Germany, Italy, Israel, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland
and the UK we inferred significant bidirectional migration. For Poland no significant migratory
pathways were inferred.
Conclusion: Subtype B phylogeographies provide a new insight about the geographical
distribution of viral lineages, as well as the significant pathways of virus dispersal across Europe,
suggesting that intervention strategies should also address tourists, travellers and migrants.

Background
Pandemic HIV-1 group M infection originated in Africa
from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz) infecting chimpanzees [1-6]. The subtype B epidemic in the
United States and elsewhere, was the result of a single
point introduction -migration – of the virus from Haiti
around the late sixties [7,8]. The introduction of HIV-1
into Europe occurred mainly through homosexual contacts or needle sharing in or from the USA [9-13], or

through heterosexual contacts with individuals from Central Africa [14,15]. At the beginning of the HIV-1 epidemic
(the early 1980's) the prevalence of HIV-1 infection was
higher among men having sex with other men (MSM)
than among heterosexuals. For this reason and also
because subtype B was identified at a high prevalence
among MSM in the USA, it was the predominant clade in
Europe. The prevalence of non-B subtypes in Europe has
been increasing over the last years [16-31]. However, the

AIDS epidemic among the long-term residents is still
dominated by viruses assigned to subtype B [32,33].
RNA viruses, such as the HIV-1, provide measurably
evolving populations characterized by very high nucleotide substitution rate [34,35]. Phylogenies can be used
for molecular epidemiology studies and notably they contain information about temporal and spatial dynamics of
the virus [36]. The latter is the geographic pattern of viral
lineages sampled from different localities, also termed as
phylogeography, tracking the migration of the virus. For
several viral infections, the dispersal of the parasite and its
host cannot be easily tracked, therefore suggesting that
phylogenies may be a better way to monitor migratory
pathways of the virus [37,38]. This methodology has been
recently applied to phylogeographic studies of influenza A
(H5N1) [37] and HCV [39] epidemics showing the pathways of viral dispersal.
Thus, phylogenies are the 'state of the art' in characterizing
viral genealogy and evolution and also serve as tools to
track migration for organisms for which there is no other
way to monitor their dispersal [38]. Although several phylogenetic studies have analyzed HIV-1 clades by geographic region in Europe, none has inferred the history of
virus's migration through its phylogeny. In the present
study, we inferred the migration history of HIV-1 virus
among 17 countries in Europe, by way of a phylogeography of subtype B sequences.

Results
Migration events were inferred through virus phylogenies
by using the Slatkin and Maddison's method [40] (illustrated in Figure 1). Trees were built by maximum likelihood (ML) methodology and countries from which
sequences were sampled were assigned to the tips of the
103 ML bootstrap trees. Inclusion of a large number of
phylogenies takes into account phylogenetic uncertainty,
because migration events are estimated over a set of trees
rather than a single one.
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenies of subtype B sequences from 16 countries in
Europe and Israel (Table 1) showed no considerable
grouping of sequences by country, however in the case of
Poland most of the sequences (65, 72%) formed a single
monophyletic clade (Figure 2). Similarly a fraction of
sequences from Austria (16, 18%), Luxembourg (13,
14%) and Portugal (20, 22%) fell within single clusters,
however the number of viral lineages spreading within
local transmission networks was much lower in these
areas than in Poland. Notably, in Poland individuals

This tree
This tree contains 8 sequences sampled from 2 countries (A and B). Tips (HIV-1 sequences) were labelled
according to its sampling country. A. If there are no epidemiological links between the two populations A and B, viral
sequences will consist of two monophyletic groups, therefore representing distinct epidemics. B. In case that an individual sampled within population B acquired the infection in
geographic area A, one branch sampled from population B
would cluster within the monophyletic clade of the population A. The migration pattern for each country was estimated by counting "state" (county label) changes at each
internal node of the tree by the criterion of parsimony. For
each country we counted "exporting" (From) and "importing" (To) migration events. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 1b, a
state change (A-B) is counted as an exporting migration
event for country A and as importing for B. In our study
migration events correspond to mobility of HIV-1 strains or
infections and, therefore, inferred exporting or importing
migration events are proportional to country-wise mobility
of HIV-1 subtype B strains.

infected locally were mainly IDUs (39/65, 60%). Bayesian
phylogenetic methods were used to further confirm the
monophyletic nature of the B sequences from Poland,
Austria, Luxembourg and Portugal. The final analysis was
performed including a few sequences of the different
monophyletic clusters identified in the ML trees and 1–2
from the other countries as references. Sequences again
appeared as monophyletic in this analysis, with high posterior probability support (>0.8; data not shown), further
supporting our previous results.
ML phylogenies suggest that sequences from the rest of
Europe show distinct grouping patterns. Specifically a
number of sequences for each locality cluster within short
monophyletic clades (approximately consisting of 2–6
sequences), or others show no grouping according to their
geographic origin (Figure 2E). These findings suggest that
except in the case of Poland and also to a lesser extend for
Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg, where a considerable percentage of infections were the result of single migration
and subsequent spread among the local population, for
the rest of countries there is a high level of mixing across
Europe.
For patients recruited in the prospective study, information on the most likely origin of the HIV infection was collected through a questionnaire. Among them, 572
sequences were used in the current analysis. Interestingly,
among those for whom this information was available

(456 patients), 90.4% claimed that they acquired the subtype B.
Statistical Phylogeography
To test the significance of specific pathways of location
changes (migration events) between countries, we estimated the expected number of changes, under the null
hypothesis of complete geographic mixing, for each pair
of countries (Tables S1 and S2 in Additional file 1), as
described previously [37,39]. The total number of location changes between countries (migration events) for all
trees was significantly lower than expected by chance
under the null hypothesis of panmixis confirming that,
although there is a high level of HIV dispersal between
countries, there is still geographic subdivision among the
subtype B lineages analyzed. Moreover, the results of this
test showed major differences across Europe (Additional
files 2 and 3). In particular, for Austria, Luxembourg and
Poland no significant exporting migration was observed,
while for the latter importing migration was also not significant; therefore classifying Poland as the country with
the lowest HIV migration – or, in other words, with the
most isolated HIV epidemic among the countries analysed (Figure 3). For Austria, and Luxembourg, on the
other hand, there was evidence that some of the subtype
B infections were the result of migration from Italy and
Portugal, Switzerland, respectively; while similarly to
Poland no significant outgoing migration was observed.
According to the ML trees, only a few sequences from

Israel and Greece fell within the Polish monophyletic
cluster, suggesting limited migration to the latter countries (Figure 2D).
Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland, and the UK appeared as
source of subtype B mobility (high levels of exporting
migration; "From") to other countries (Additional files 2
and 3). In case that significant migration was detected
from a country to more than 2 others, the former was designated as "exporter". Notably, Greece's migratory targets
were dispersed to 7 countries, while for both Spain and
the Netherlands; they were to 5 and 6 countries, respectively (Figure 3). High levels of HIV migration – with
regard to the highest difference between the observed and
the expected migration events under panmixis – were
detected from Italy to Austria and Switzerland, from Portugal to Luxembourg and also from the Netherlands to

Germany (Table S2 in Additional file 1). On the other
hand, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Israel showed only
limited export of HIV-1 subtype B (Additional files 2 and
3).
Major migratory targets of HIV-1 subtype B (importing
migration; "To") were Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain,
Switzerland, and the UK (a similar criterion as for the
"From" migration was used to assign countries) (Additional files 4 and 5), while limited migration was
observed into Serbia and Israel (Supplementary information Figure 1c, d in Additional files 4 and 5) (in case that
significant migration was detected from a country to more
than 2 others, the former was designated as "exporter").
Notably, except from Poland, significant importing
migration was detected for all countries across Europe
(Figure 3).

sampled from all countries except Poland, Austria, Luxembourg and Portugal, showed low levels of grouping
according to the geographic origin. For most countries, we
identified small networks of local transmission, but to a
different extent in each country, along with sequences
showing no particular geographic clustering. Such a pattern suggests that the subtype B epidemic in most countries was introduced by several founders, some of them
causing subsequent local dispersal, while others lead to
dead end infections. We should note that under the conditions of our study, we cannot estimate the percentage of
infections occurring within local transmission networks,
since we don't have sufficient covering per country.
Figure 3

Arrowheads indicate the targets of migration shown in different colours and styles by country of origin.
Based on these findings, evidence for directional HIV dispersion was detected where Spain, Greece, Portugal and
Serbia acted as sources of migration events ("exporters")
(Figure 3); Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg (Luxembourg and Austria were classified within the "importers"
due to the high migration (>7) inferred from Portugal
towards Luxembourg), provided migratory targets
("importers") (Figure 3), while significant bidirectional
HIV migration was found for Denmark, Germany, Italy,
Israel, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and
the UK (Figure 3). Israel and Sweden were classified
among localities with bidirectional migration because in
both countries significant bidirectional mobility was
detected. In contrast, for Poland, no significantly importing or exporting migration was found that is in accordance
with the high percentage of sequences grouping according
to the sampling location.
To further confirm our findings all steps of the analyses
(phylogenetic analysis with ML bootstrapping, inference
of migration events and statistical phylogeography) were
repeated in a 2nd run. Notably, migration events inferred
on 103 newly inferred ML bootstrap trees were almost
identical to the previous (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.001; data not
shown). Moreover, statistical phylogeography revealed
that out of 46 and 50 significantly high migration events
inferred in the two rounds of analyses, 43 were identical,
thus suggesting that the major migratory pathways were
reproducible.

Discussion
Our results based on a phylogeographic study of a large
number of sequences sampled from 16 countries in
Europe and Israel provided important clues about HIV-1
subtype B spatial diffusion across Europe. Notably according to the findings of phylogenetic analyses, viral lineages

Poland's epidemic dispersal is quite different. Based on
the high number of viral lineages coalescing to a common
origin within the country, we suggest that the epidemic is
the result of a few migrations of the virus successfully
spreading within the local population. This pattern is consistent with a main viral dispersal through IDU networks
associated with extensive local epidemics. Monophyletic
HIV epidemics have been described among IDUs for other
European countries, as well, including also non-B subtypes strains [12,13,26,27,42-45].
For Austria, Poland and Luxembourg we identified more
extensive local transmission networks than for the other
European countries. Similarly HIV local networks have
been described for Canada, Greece and the UK [46-50].
According to the epidemiological data, most of the subtype B infections newly diagnosed during 2002–2004,
occurred locally. The geographic distribution by means of
the viral evolutionary history, the phylogeography, on the
other hand, revealed high levels of viral dispersal. Both
observations are not necessarily in contradiction. Rather,
they suggest that most of the migration identified through
phylogeography may date from earlier in the transmission
chain, and that the pre-existing complexity of the epidemic (multiple sources of introduction from diverse
localities) is the main reason for the continuous extensive
geographical dispersal across the viral phylogeny. Particularly if there are multiple founders, subsequent infections
will be dispersed, across the viral phylogeny, according to
the geographic origin of the founders' source. This is in
accordance with previous findings about multiple introductions of the subtype B infection through sexual intercourses or IDU across Europe [13,47,49,51,52].
In addition to epidemic dispersal patterns, our study provided important findings about HIV-1 subtype B major
sources and targets for migratory events, as well as localities with bidirectional viral dispersion.
In particular, Greece, Portugal, and Spain attract many
travellers and tourists, especially from Central Europe,

Retrovirology 2009, 6:49

thus suggesting that HIV dispersal from Southern to Central Europe may, at least in part, occur by travellers
infected during their stay in Southern Europe http://
epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/
product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-DS-08001.
For countries classified among the HIV migratory targets
(Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg) the epidemic was
mainly imported due to the high HIV mobility to these
countries. According to the epidemiological information,
the highest rate of imported infections from other European countries occurs in Luxembourg. Moreover, the fact
that 13% of the population of Luxembourg is of Portuguese origin provides a plausible explanation for the
migratory pathway from Portugal http://www.migration
information.org/datahub. Another significant pathway
was tracked from Italy to Austria, in accordance with the
high influx from Italy during recent years http://
www.migrationinformation.org/datahub. Denmark provided migratory target from another Scandinavian country (Sweden) but also from Spain. This is in accordance
with epidemiological findings that a percentage of HIV
subtype B infections in Denmark originated from Sweden
and Spain.
Additionally we identified several countries showing bidirectional migration. Notably, for the Netherlands 6 significant pathways were detected from and to the same
localities. The Netherlands is among the countries in
Europe with the most diverse geographical origin among
newly diagnosed patients, confirmed by the high percentage of non-Dutch individuals among the newly HIVinfected patients during 2003–2004 [32,53]. Moreover,
because of its policies, the Netherlands attracts foreign
drug users and male homosexuals, two populations
known to be at higher risk for HIV infection [51].
Migratory pathways inferred through viral phylogenies
cannot be directly validated by other sources of information (epidemiological figures, mobility and immigration
information, tourism, etc), because these data are not
stratified by subtype. Moreover, due to the high mobility
of population within Europe and the complexity of the
epidemic spread, information about the locus of infection
for an individual doesn't necessarily match with the geographic origin of the source. On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences provides a realistic
approach for the reconstruction of HIV transmission
chains or networks [36,46,47,49,54-56], therefore suggesting that statistical phylogeography is appropriate for
inferring the spatial dispersal of a viral epidemic.
Given the high complexity of the epidemic, dense sampling is needed in order to accurately reconstruct the spatial characteristics of the subtype B infections in Europe.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/49

This provides one of the limitations of this study; on the
other hand however the analysis of our dataset, which is
the largest available at the time of analysis, provides for a
first time a description of the geographic distribution of
viral lineages as well as the significant migrations of HIV
subtype B across Europe, by means of viral phylogenies.
Dense sampling for each locality would be ideal for such
purposes; however limited availability of sequences for
several countries, as well as computation time provide as
the major limitations for such a study.
We paid special attention to representativeness of our
data. The prospective SPREAD collection strategy (data
from 2002–2004) was specifically designed to avoid such
a bias [53], while the retrospectively collected CATCH
data (1996–2002) were sampled as part of national surveillance studies designed to investigate the transmission
of drug resistance or as part of the standard clinical practice of baseline sequencing for all newly diagnosed cases
in each participating center [57]. For most countries
where national data were available, the data were a rather
good representation of the national epidemic.
In conclusion, HIV-1 subtype B phylogeographies provide
a new insight for the first time into the pathways of spatial
diffusion and virus migration across Europe. HIV-1 subtype B was each time introduced from multiple sources
and subsequently spread locally, but the pattern is not
uniform across Europe. The countries grouped into
sources (Greece, Portugal, Serbia and Spain) and sinks
(Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg) of virus migration, as
well as countries with significant bidirectional migration
(Denmark, Germany, Italy, Israel, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK). The only exception was Poland where a significant number of sequences
fell within a monophyletic cluster. These results suggest
that mobility of the virus matches mobility of the host,
such that in order to reduce further spread of the epidemic, prevention measures should not only be directed
towards national populations, but also towards migrants,
travellers and tourists who are the major sources and targets of HIV dispersal.

Methods
HIV-1 sequences
Protease (PR) and partial reverse transcriptase (RT)
sequences were sampled from HIV-1 seropositive individuals who had never received antiretroviral drugs (ARV) as
described previously [53,57]. Specifically, partial PR/RT
sequences were sampled from 17 countries in Europe
including Israel. Sequences were collected from two studies, the Combined Analysis of Resistance Transmission
over Time of Chronically and Acute Infected HIV Patients;
(CATCH), in a retrospective setting [57] and a prospective
study named after Strategy to Control SPREAD of HIV
Drug Resistance (SPREAD) [53]. In the CATCH analysis

all sequences were collected during 1996–2002 from geographically distinct centres across the participating countries, except for Belgium and the Netherlands, where HIV1 sequences were sampled from a single geographic area.
In the prospective setting (SPREAD), samples were collected during 2002–2004 according to two different
approaches in order to ensure representative sampling
[53]. Notably although data from the period 1996–2002
were retrospectively analyzed, they were collected as part
of national surveillance studies designed to investigate the
transmission of drug resistance or of the standard clinical
practice of baseline sequencing for all newly diagnosed
cases in each participating center [57]. In the prospective
setting a standardized sampling strategy was designed in
order to ensure representative sampling in all countries
[53]. For the purpose of this study we included only those
classified as subtype B. All individuals were sampled at a
single time point. The subtyping process was performed
by phylogenetic analysis [53,57]. The prevalence of the
transmission risk groups among the study population is
shown in Table 1.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/49

available, however only for the last three countries the
number of sequences included was << 90. As a result of
choosing approximately equal number of strains per
country, irrespective of the prevalence or the total number
of infected individuals across Europe, we calculated the
relative mobility per infected individual. Therefore, the
numbers in the migration matrices are directly comparable reflecting actual differences in mobility between countries. For example, we estimated higher migration from
the UK to Spain (5.34), than from Germany to Italy (3.23)
(Table S2 in Additional file 1).
Phylogenetic analyses for the estimation of the migration
process were performed in a single dataset consisting of
1337 sequences analyzed in two independent runs (Table
1).
Alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction
The alignment of the subtype B partial RT sequences sampled from 1337 individuals was performed using CLUSTAL W version 1.74 [58] and manually edited according
to the encoded reading frame. In order to avoid any bias
due to convergent evolution at antiretroviral drug resistance mutations on the phylogenetic analysis, we excluded
all sites associated with major resistance in PR (30, 32, 33,
46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 76, 82, 84, 88, and 90) and RT (41, 62,
65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 75, 77, 100, 103, 106,108, 115, 116,
151, 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215, 219, 225, and 236)
leaving 687 nt.

Phylogenetic analyses
Sampling strategy
For the estimation of country-wise clustering (migration),
first we need to infer the phylogenies of the sequences
under study. One of the issues to be addressed was how
many sequences needed to be included for each country.
The dataset size needs to be large enough as: 1) to include
most of the available information from each country and
2) to estimate rare migration events. On the other hand,
we had to restrict the number of sequences to keep the
computation time needed for phylogenetic inference reasonable, while maintaining an informative number of
sequences required for the calculation of migration
events. For this reason, we performed a preliminary analysis of migration for 4 countries including 10, 20 25 or 90
sequences per country. For each dataset, we tested
whether the distribution of the total number of migration
events across the set of all credible trees differed significantly from a distribution of randomly generated trees
(phylogenetic inference was performed by ML method).
The results of this preliminary analysis showed that with
25 sequences per country, the largest number of countries
reached significantly different migration levels than compared to the distribution for a random set of trees (P <
0.01). However the larger the number of sequences
included per country the higher the signal for clustering
with regard the total number of changes across inferred
versus random set of trees.

Inference of migration events
All bootstrap generated trees (103) were used for the estimation of the HIV-1 migration events by using the cladistic approach first described by Slatkin and Maddison [40],
as implemented in MacClade [60]. Specifically, all the
nodes of the inferred trees were assigned with a character
according to the geographic origin (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3 for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, etc). The algorithm
reconstructs "ancestral" states that in our case correspond
to countries, at each internal node by the criterion of parsimony [40]. Parsimony selects the reconstruction that
minimizes the total number of steps on the tree [41].

Consequently, we included in the analyses the largest
number of sequences (90) available per country, expect
from Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Israel, Norway
and Serbia for which a smaller number of sequences was

When two branches from 2 different locations (e.g. 0 and
1) join with each other, and thus more than one character
can be reconstructed at the node, then the ancestor state at
the internal node is assigned to be the union of the two

Phylogenetic trees were inferred by maximum likelihood
method under the general time-reversible GTR model of
nucleotide substitution including a Γ distributed rates
heterogeneity among sites as implemented in RAxML
[59]. Bootstrapping was performed on the maximum likelihood trees (1000 replicates) to assess the reliability of
the obtained topologies.

characters [0, 1] that is assigned a migration event. If this
number between two groups of sequences remains low,
the possibility for migration events between these particular groups also remains low.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/49

migration events and statistical phylogeography was
repeated twice.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Specifically, the migration events between HIV-1
sequences sampled in different locations were estimated
for each dataset according to the following method: 1) for
nodes with more than one equally parsimonious reconstructions (e.g. 0, 1 or 0), implicit examination of all most
parsimonious reconstructions (MPRs) was used in case of
a big number of MPRs [61,62], while explicit examination
was used in case of a small number of MPR, as implemented in MacClade. As a result, for a particular type of
character change, e.g. [0,1] MacClade reports a minimum,
a maximum and a average number of [0,1] changes estimated over all possible MPRs. We estimated the average
number of migration events for each tree used in the analyses. 2) Polytomies that correspond to nodes with more
than two descendant nodes were interpreted as regions of
uncertain evolution (soft polytomies) as implemented in
MacClade.
Inference of migration matrices
For each dataset a 17 × 17 migration matrix was estimated
between HIV-1 sequences sampled in different European
countries. Each migration event was calculated as the
median of the distribution estimated from all trees (103)
used in the analysis. In the matrix, all 'from' events and 'to'
events are pooled per country.
Statistical phylogeography
To further estimate which migration events were significantly different from the expected number of changes
under the null hypothesis of full geographic mixing of
HIV-1 sequences, we estimated if the distribution for each
of the migration events estimated over 103 bootstrap trees
was statistically different from the distribution estimated
from the same set of trees (103) after reshuffling taxa at the
tips. This analysis was performed using Mesquite [63].
Equality of medians between observed and expected
migration events was assessed by means of the KruskalWallis one-way analysis of variance and the level of significance was adjusted according to Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons.

The differences between the observed and the expected
values indicate the levels of HIV-1 country-dependent
structure in the dataset, and thus also of the relative
mobility of the virus between countries. This strategy
allowed estimating significant differences also when an
unequal number of strains were included per country.
Notably in order to assess the validity of our results, the
