Brain gene expression and evolution

Abstract
Background: The evolutionary rate of a protein is a basic measure of evolution at the molecular
level. Previous studies have shown that genes expressed in the brain have significantly lower
evolutionary rates than those expressed in somatic tissues.
Results: We study the evolutionary rates of genes expressed in 21 different human brain regions.
We find that genes highly expressed in the more recent cortical regions of the brain have lower
evolutionary rates than genes highly expressed in subcortical regions. This may partially result from
the observation that genes that are highly expressed in cortical regions tend to be highly expressed
in subcortical regions, and thus their evolution faces a richer set of functional constraints. The
frequency of mammal-specific and primate-specific genes is higher in the highly expressed gene sets
of subcortical brain regions than in those of cortical brain regions. The basic inverse correlation
between evolutionary rate and gene expression is significantly stronger in brain versus nonbrain
tissues, and in cortical versus subcortical regions. Extending upon this cortical/subcortical trend,
this inverse correlation is generally more marked for tissues that are located higher along the
cranial vertical axis during development, giving rise to the possibility that these tissues are also
more evolutionarily recent.
Conclusions: We find that cortically expressed genes are more conserved than subcortical ones,
and that gene expression levels exert stronger constraints on sequence evolution in cortical versus
subcortical regions. Taken together, these findings suggest that cortically expressed genes are
under stronger selective pressure than subcortically expressed genes.

Background

The evolutionary rate (ER) of a protein, the ratio between the
rate of its nonsynonymous to the rate of its synonymous
mutations, dN/dS, is a basic measure of evolution at the
molecular level (for example, see [1,2]). (Throughout the
report, when we talk about the ER of a gene we actually refer

to the ER of its corresponding protein.) It is affected by many
systemic factors, including gene dispensability, expression
level, the number of protein interactions, and the recombination rate [3-7]. Notably, functionally related genes tend to
have similar ERs [8,9]. The expression level of yeast genes has
been observed to be markedly and negatively correlated with

their ER [5,10], even when controlling for the dispensability
of the genes [4]. This inverse relation extends to other eukaryotes (including humans and other vertebrates) [11]. Obviously, when considering the relationship between ER and
gene expression in multicellular organisms, the expression
levels of genes in different tissues and cell types should be
considered separately. Indeed, previous studies [12-15] have
shown that genes vary in their rates of evolution according to
the tissues in which they are highly expressed, with genes
expressed in the brain evolving at significantly slower rates
than those expressed in other tissues. A general principle
arising from such studies has been that tissue-specific genes
have higher ERs than 'housekeeping' genes, which are
broadly expressed in most tissues [16-18].

the extent to which the basic correlation between expression
level and sequence conservation varies across brain regions,
and learn from its variation about the selection forces that
drive sequence evolution of highly expressed genes.

To explain this observation, the tissue-driven hypothesis of
genomic evolution was recently proposed, starting from the
probable assumption that genes influence phenotypic characters by their expression in specific tissues [19]. Accordingly, if
a protein is expressed in several different tissues, then the
evolution of its sequence may be under multi-tissue-specific
constraints, resulting in a slower rate of evolution. Among
genes with similar expression broadness (genes that are
expressed in about the same number of tissues), those genes
expressed in tissues that are presumably under more stringent evolutionary selection pressure (for example, neural tissues) generally tend to evolve more slowly than those that are
expressed in tissues that presumably are under lesser selection pressure [19]. This hypothesis is concordant with the
notion that each tissue is associated with a certain level of
evolutionary constraints acting on the genes expressed in it,
with the brain imposing more constraints than other tissues
[15].
This study aims to go beyond previous investigations and to
study the tissue-driven hypothesis at higher resolution, in an
organ of central importance to human evolution: the brain.
To this end, we examine the evolution of genes that are highly
expressed in different brain tissues. Our work stems from the
basic observation that the transcriptomes of different brain
regions differ substantially from each other [20]. These differences are likely to be functionally significant, because they
mainly involve genes that are associated with central functions such as signal transduction and neurogenesis [20].
First, we are interested in examining whether the basic
inverse relationship between a gene's tissue specificity and its
ER also holds in different brain regions. Second, we examine
the ER of highly expressed genes in the more phylogenetically
recent cortical brain regions, compared with the ERs of genes
that are highly expressed in older brain regions. It was previously found that older genes (that arose earlier in evolution)
tend to evolve more slowly than newer ones [21,22]. Does this
finding translate to the brain tissue/region level? (Specifically, do genes expressed in older brain regions evolve more
slowly than those expressed in new ones?) Third, we examine

Results
Brain region-specific indices of gene expression and
conservation
We analyze a dataset encompassing the expressions of 10,594
human genes, across 78 tissues (Additional data file 1) [23].
Twenty-one of these tissues are from different brain regions
(Table 1). First, these brain regions can be broadly divided
into two major phylogenetic classes: cortical regions, which
are primarily characteristic of the mammalian lineage; and
subcortical brain regions, which have a broad phyletic distribution [24]. (No other vertebrates have a structure that
clearly resembles the isocortical regions studied here [25].)
Second, the brain regions are divided into four major developmental classes, including those that develop from the
embryonic forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord
[26]. For each brain region we define a gene set, composed of
the genes that are over-expressed in that particular region. A
gene is defined as over-expressed in a given brain region if its
expression is at least 2 standard deviations higher than the
mean of its expression across all of the regions.
Our dataset encompasses 4,919 genes that are over-expressed
in at least one brain region. When this list of genes is analyzed
using the Gene Ontology (GO) process category, enrichment
for neural functions is found, attesting to their biologic relevance (Additional data files 2 and 3). We focus on overexpressed genes, following previous studies of expression signatures of different brain regions [27]. Notably, the enriched
GO categories of under-expressed genes do not include neurally related categories (Additional data file 4). We additionally define for each brain region a more stringent specific
characteristic set (SCS), which includes genes that are solely
highly expressed in this region and in no other region.
We denote the brain expression specificity Tmax to be the ratio
between the highest expression level of a gene in a brain
region and the sum of its expression levels across all 21 brain
regions. The coefficient of variance (CV) of a gene is the variance of its expression levels across brain regions divided by its
mean expression. The CV thus estimates the expression variability of each gene across regions. The ERs of all of the genes
along the human lineage and along a longer, mammalian
range (human-mouse) were computed (see Materials and
methods, below) and were used to extract the median ERs of
over-expressed genes in each brain region (columns 4 and 5
in Table 1). Because the development of cortical and subcortical regions is not a human-specific morphologic trait but
already a mammalian one, we primarily report the results in
the main text using the human-mouse lineage for estimating
ERs, and provide the corresponding (qualitatively similar)

results using the mammalian ERs in the supplementary
materials (Additional data file 5 [Supplementary note 1]).
A four-level estimation of gene age was computed following a
procedure similar to that in [21,22], by searching for
homologs of each human gene in four sets of organisms
(mammals, fish, insects and worms, and yeast and plants). A
gene with a homolog only in mammals is considered a mammalian gene, and a gene with a homolog only in the primates
is considered a primate gene (see Materials and methods,
below). Table 1 depicts the age group, developmental origin,
median ER (human lineage), median ER (human-mouse),
frequency of mammalian genes, frequency of mammalian
SCS genes, frequency of primate genes, and mean Tmax for
each brain region, computed for the genes over-expressed in
each region. The last column in the table includes the correlation between the genes' ER (human-mouse), and their
expression levels in each region and a corresponding P value.
It can be seen that there is excellent agreement between the
maximally expressed gene set and the more stringent SCS
gene set, both in their ER (with both the mammalian and
human estimators) and in gene age.

Evolutionary rate, gene age and gene expression in
cortical vs sub-cortical regions
We computed the correlation between the ER and gene
expression levels in each region, and the median ER of its
over-expressed genes (see Figures 1 and 2 for the ER of each
tissue separately, and gene expression in the prefrontal cortex
versus their ERs).
The ER of genes that are highly expressed in cortical brain
regions is significantly lower than that of genes highly
expressed in noncortical brain regions (mean ER of 0.1016
versus 0.1378; P < 10-16). The medians of the SCS genes of the
regions in the two sets exhibit a similar trend (P = 6 × 10-5).
This finding remains robust also after controlling for the total
gene expression of genes and their expression breadth (Additional data file 5 [Supplementary note 2]). Similarly, gene
compactness and gene essentiality, which are additional
important determinants of mammalian protein ER (essential
genes have lower ERs, and compact genes have higher ER values [28]), cannot explain the difference in ERs between cortical and subcortical genes. The frequency of essential genes
among cortical genes is lower (15%) than among subcortical

genes (16%), ruling out the possibility that the lower ER of
cortical genes is due to the fact that they include greater numbers of lethal genes; and the fact that the ER of cortical genes
is significantly lower than that of noncortical genes remains
robust even after controlling for gene compactness (Additional data file 5 [Supplementary note 3]).
Finally, genes that are over-expressed in both parts of the
brain have significantly lower median ERs than genes that are
over-expressed in nonbrain regions (Figure 2).
The correlation between the ER and expression levels is
higher in cortical than in subcortical brain regions (P = 0.038;
Figures 1 and 3), and higher in brain tissues than in other tissues. The raw mean expression levels in cortical regions is
slightly lower than the subcortical regions (514 versus 518),
thus ruling out the possibility that this finding is actually an
indirect consequence of lower expression levels in subcortical
versus cortical regions (because, hypothetically, lower
expression levels could transcribe to a decreased signal-tonoise ratio, and hence to decreased ER/expression
correlations).
We repeated our analysis (ER and ER/expression correlations in cortical and subcortical regions) in two other organisms: Mus musculus (mouse) and Pan troglodytes (chimp).
Although the gene expression measurements of these two
organisms is less abundant than in human, in both cases the
ER of the cortical genes was lower than that of the subcortical
genes (Additional data file 5 [Supplementary notes 4 and 5]
and Additional data files 6 and 7).
Interestingly, the prefrontal cortex exhibits the greatest correlation between gene expression and ER among all of the 78
tissues (see Additional data files 8 and 9 for the ERs in all of

the tissues, and the correlation between ER and expression
level in each tissue). This cortical region is known to be associated in primates and humans with complex associative cognitive tasks such as those involving delayed response and
working memory. Other interesting phenomena are the very
low ER of the cerebellum, and the very low correlation
between expression level and ER in the various ganglia. We
verified that even after removing these tissues the ER of cortical regions is still lower than that of subcortical regions (P =
1.3 × 10-13 when considering all of the corresponding genes).
The very low correlation between expression level and ER
observed in the various ganglia may perhaps arise from the
very small tissue volume of the latter, which may attenuate
their effect in determining the ERs of their highly expressed
genes. The high conservation of genes that are highly
expressed in the cerebellum is a quandary; it is not a result of
potential lower tissue specificity of these genes, which is not
statistically different from the tissue specificity of the subcortical or all brain genes. However, the cerebellar genes have
higher mean expression levels than the subcortical genes
(1.09 versus 0.72; P < 10-16), which can partially explain their
higher conservation.
The frequency of mammal-specific genes is higher in the
highly expressed gene sets of subcortical brain regions than in
those of cortical regions (with mean frequencies of 0.121 versus 0.086; P = 0.03). This difference remains similar also
when considering primate-specific genes. The mean frequency is 0.0073 in subcortical versus 0.0018 in cortical
regions (P = 0.05). This difference is surprising, but it is consistent with the negative correlation found between the genes'
age and ER (-0.23; P < 10-16). A similar inverse correlation
across all tissues was previously observed [21,22]. Genes that
are expressed in cortical regions have higher mean expression
levels across brain tissues than genes expressed in subcortical
regions (1.6 versus 1; P = 2.4 × 10-10) and across all somatic
tissues (0.9 versus 0.7; P < 10-16). This fact can partially
explain the lower ER values of cortical genes, because these
genes are likely to be subjected to diverse simultaneous selective pressures.

Relation between ER, expression level, and region
specificity
Previous work has demonstrated that housekeeping genes
tend to evolve more slowly than tissue-specific genes [17].
Gene expression across brain tissues manifests a similar
region-specificity relation between gene expression and ER;
genes highly expressed in fewer brain regions have higher ER
values (the Spearman correlation between Tmax and ER along
the mammalian lineage is 0.131 [P < 10-16] and along the
human lineage it is 0.0504 [P < 2 × 10-7). A similar trend is
observed by noting that genes with higher CV levels have
higher ER values (Spearman correlation along the mammalian lineage is 0.1269 [P < 10-16] and along the human lineage
it is 0.0447 [P = 4.1 × 10-6]).

Genes that are expressed in cortical regions are also less
region-specific than those expressed in subcortical regions;
the Tmax values of genes expressed in each cortical region are
significantly higher than those expressed in each subcortical
regions (mean Tmax of 0.10 versus 0.12; P = 0.02). Aggregating all genes expressed in cortical or subcortical regions
together yields a mean Tmax of 0.106 for cortical regions and
mean Tmax of 0.116 for subcortical ones (P = 3.4 × 10-12),
showing a similar trend. Thus, genes that are highly
expressed in cortical regions have a higher expression
breadth that may partly (Additional data file 5 [Supplementary note 6]) account for their overall lower ER values. This
reduced region specificity of cortical genes may arise due to a
'preferential attachment'-like process [29], in which the genes
that are highly expressed in the more recent cortical regions
in the mammalian lineage tend to be those that already have
a broad expression breadth in subcortical regions. In accordance with that, we find a marked correlation of 0.28 (P < 1016) between the number of cortical and subcortical regions in
which a gene is expressed (Figure 4).

ER and gene expression: a developmental perspective
We divided the brain into five main developmental areas
[26]: three forebrain areas, including the pallium, subpallium, and the diencephalon; the hind brain; and the spinal
cord (our data do not include midbrain structures, and additionally includes three cranial nuclei of different developmental origins).
These five developmental areas have an ordered placement
along the cranial vertical axis, with the spinal cord being the
lowest [26,30], then the hindbrain, followed by the diencephalon, the subpallium, and the pallium (the highest). The
correlation between ER and gene expression levels exhibits
an interesting pattern; their magnitude manifests a significant correlation with the region location on the cranial vertical axis (Spearman ranked correlation of 0.9 [P = 0.037]when
averaging the regions of each developmental area, and Spearman ranked correlation of 0.5 [P = 0.034] when considering
each region separately; Figure 5, and Additional data files 10
and 11). This finding reinforces the observations made in the

Discussion

Previous studies have shown that the rate of evolution among
brain-expressed genes is probably lower (or at most equal) in
humans compared with chimpanzee and old world monkeys
(for instance, most recently in [31]). Slower sequence evolution of tissue/region-specific genes is a probable indicator of
stronger selective constraints operating on the region in
hand. Hence, the overall sequence conservation of highly
expressed brain genes makes them an interesting subject for
the further study of the basic relation between gene expression and ER. To this end, we find that cortically expressed
genes are more conserved than subcortical ones, and that
gene expression levels exert stronger constraints on sequence
evolution in cortical versus subcortical regions. Taken
together, these findings support the view that cortically
expressed genes are under stronger selective pressure than
subcortically expressed genes.
One possible mechanism that can partially explain these findings is the overall broader tissue distribution of cortically

origins with ER. Shown is the mean correlation of expression levels with
ER (human-mouse), for regions belonging to five different embryonic
developmental origins. The latter are ordered on the x-axis in accordance
with their height on the cranial vertical axis during early embryonic stages
(spinal cord is the lowest, and Forebrain [pallium] is the highest). As
evident, these ER/expression correlations are ordered by their cranial
vertical location (Spearman rank correlation of 0.9; P = 0.037). A similar
result was observed when computing the ER using the human lineage
(human-chimpanzee; Additional data file 10). ER, evolutionary rate.

expressed genes, but other nonexclusive mechanisms may
take part. For instance, it is possible that there are more frequent genetic and protein interactions among highly
expressed genes in the cortical regions, which are known to be
correlated with reduced ER levels [7]. The cellular complexity
(types of cells and their distribution) of the regions studied is
different, which may further determine different and complex
evolutionary constraints in each region. Another factor
potentially influencing these regional differences is the sex
bias of genes, because it has been suggested that the expression of genes that are more pleiotropic (or, in terms of our
work, that have a greater tissue expression breadth) is less sex
biased [32], and that sex-dependent allelic effects cannot
maintain polygenic variation [33]. Thus, the exact mechanisms underlying our findings are probably subject to quite
complex interplay that remains to be further explored.
The magnitudes of some of the ER/expression correlations
reported here are lower than in yeast (see Figure 1 for gene
expression in the prefrontal cortex versus their ERs), even
though these correlations are highly significant. In the case of
the yeast (for example [5]), the respective correlation found is
around 1.5 times higher. There are three main reasons that
may explain this difference. First and foremost, in contrast to
the yeast, humans are multicellular organisms with hundreds
of distinct cell types and diverse tissues; thus, gene ER in
humans is likely to be under a large variety of (sometimes per-

haps counteracting) selection forces, resulting in a lower correlation with gene expression in any single specific cell/tissue
type [28]. Second, because this study focuses on human brain
regions, we have estimated ER values along shorter evolutionary time periods (the past 6.5 to 10 million years of the
human lineage, after the human-chimp split [34,35], and the
50 to 100 million years corresponding to the human-mouse
split), which is in contrast to the much longer time spans
employed for estimating ER in the yeast studies. Indeed,
when using ER estimates using the human-mouse lineage, we
obtain ER/expression correlations that are two times higher
than those obtained when using ER estimates from the
shorter period, human-chimp lineage. Third, the sets of genes
studied differ markedly, with the number of genes included in
this study being two to three times higher than the number of
genes examined in previous yeast studies (larger datasets
usually increase the correlations but may decrease their
significance).
Cortical regions, at least in their extensive mammalian form,
are more recent than subcortical regions, which have a
broader phyletic distribution. The ER of cortically expressed
genes is yet slower than that of subcortically expressed genes.
This is in contrast to the findings at the gene level, at which
the ER of younger genes is higher than that of older ones [21].
This appears paradoxical at first, because one would perhaps
expect that genes that are highly expressed in the more
recently evolving cortical brain regions would be younger
than the genes that are highly expressed in subcortical
regions. However, this is not the case; highly expressed cortical genes tend also to be highly expressed in many subcortical
regions, and thus both types of regions are composed of both
younger and older highly expressed genes (with cortical areas
being actually composed of older genes than subcortical
regions, on average). Furthermore, although we find that cortically expressed genes are more conserved than subcortical
ones, this does not necessarily imply that cortical regions
offer more stringent 'environments' for gene evolution than
subcortical regions, because this excess conservation may
arise from their broader, somatic tissue distribution. However, the tighter correlation between ER and expression levels
that characterizes cortically expressed genes does point to the
fact that the cortex may form a more stringent environment
for gene evolution than other brain and somatic tissues, as
one may intuitively expect [19]. (Obviously, in turn, it is also
possible that the rates of gene evolution may play an important role in shaping their expression profiles in the cortex.)
There are many definitions for the tissue/region specificity of
genes (for example, based on expressed sequence tags data,
serial analysis of gene expression data, literature [36,37], or
gene expression [as was adopted here]). Each of the definition
may give rather different sets of genes. Currently, there are no
available datasets based on expressed sequence tags, serial
analysis of gene expression, or literature that provide information about brain regional specificity. Hence, we have

specificity. A comparison of our results with those based on

available.

dataset, in order to filter out paralogs and to avoid potential
errors in ER estimation caused by duplication events (today,
there are no reported cases of horizontal gene transfer)
between Primates; see, for instance, [38]). This procedure
resulted in a total of 15,176 orthologous gene sets.

Finally, the results reported in Figure 5 are intriguing, generalizing in a way the results reported in Figures 1 to 3. Whereas
Figures 1 to 3 report that cortical regions exhibit a correlation
between ERs and tissue gene expression levels in cortical versus subcortical regions, Figure 5 shows that this correlation
tends to be stronger for vertically higher regions in the developmental axis. each point in Figure 5 corresponds to the correlation between ER and expression levels of 10,594 genes in
all of the regions in a developmental area, the reported correlation values are highly robust. Thus, drawing an analogy
from the observation that cortical regions are evolutionary
more recent than subcortical ones [24], one may (perhaps
boldly) speculate that regions located higher on the vertical
axis at brain development are also more evolutionarily recent.
However, because even the basic claim that cortical regions
are more recent is not accepted by everyone, care should obviously be taken with formulating such hypotheses. Their
examination should await the accumulation of additional
gene expression samples from more brain tissues and from
more mammalian species.

In the next step, stop codons were removed from each gene
and the genes were translated to sequences of amino acids.
The corresponding amino acid sequences of each orthologous
gene set were aligned by CLUSTALW 1.83 [39], with default
parameters. By using amino acids as templates for the nucleotide sequences and by ignoring gaps, we generated gap-free
multiple alignments of the three orthologous proteins in each
orthologous set and their corresponding coding sequences.

Conclusion

Our findings support the view that cortically expressed genes
are under stronger selective pressure than subcortically
expressed genes. They may also suggest that regions that are
located higher on the vertical axis at brain development are
also more evolutionarily recent. These findings should be reexamined when additional biological data (for example, gene
expression samples from more brain tissues and from more
mammalian species) will become available.

Given the alignments of each set of orthologs and given the
phylogenetic tree of the three primates (Figure 6a), we used
the codeml program in PAML for the joint reconstruction of
ancestral codons in the internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree
[40] (the ancestor of the human and chimp; Figure 6a). This
reconstruction induced the sequence of the ancestral proteins
and their corresponding ancestral DNA coding sequences.
We hence obtained sets of four sequences: three from the previous step (corresponding to the three leaves of the phylogenetic tree) plus one reconstructed sequences of the internal
node of the phylogenetic tree. We denote such a set of four
sequences a 'complete ortholgous set'. For each complete
ortholgous set, we computed the dN (the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions) and dS (the rate of synonymous substitutions) along the linage to the human (the branch between the
internal node and the human node; see Figure 6a) by the y00
program in PAML [41,42]. The ER of a gene is the dN divided
by the dS of its corresponding complete ortholgous set along
the human lineage (the dN/dS along the human lineage).

Computation of ERs
We used two estimations of human ERs: long-term ERs along
the mammalian lineage (human-mouse dN/dS) that were
downloaded from European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)
BioMart (BioMart July 2008), and short-term ERs along the
human lineage (human-chimpanzee dN/dS), whose computations are described in the following subsection.

Computing gene ERs along the human and chimp
lineages
We downloaded the orthologous groups of Homo sapiens
(humans), Pan troglodytes (chimp), and Macaca mulatta
(macaque) from EBI BioMart Homology (BioMart November
2007). We considered only sets that include orthologs in all
three species. Sets of homologs that did not include exactly
one representative in each organism were removed from our

organisms (the list of organisms appear in Additional data file
14, and phyletic patterns of all the human genes appear in
Additional data file 15). Next, the organism set was divided
into four groups: group 1, mammals (youngest group); group
2, fish; group 3, insects, worm, ciona; and group 4, plants and
yeast (oldest group). The age of each of the human genes was
determined according to the oldest organism group with a
homolog of the gene (Figure 6b). Accordingly, a gene that has
homolog(s) only in group 1 is named a mammalian gene,
whereas a gene with homolog(s) in group 4 is very old. We
also performed an additional study of primate specific genes,
defined as human genes that have homolog(s) only in the primates (P. troglodytes or M. mulatta).

Computing ERs of tissues
The ER of a tissue/region is the median ER of all the genes
that are over-expressed in that tissue (genes that are 2 standard deviations higher than their mean expression across all of
the tissues). We used median instead of average because the
analyzed set of genes included genes with dS = 0 (ER equals
infinity).
It is important to note that all of the results reported here are
remarkably robust to changing the cutoff of 2 standard deviations. For example if we choose a cutoff of 3 standard deviations, then the average median ER of cortical brain regions is
0.1532 versus 0.2387 in subcortical brain regions, and 0.2914
in nonbrain tissues (P = 0.014 and P = 0.002 respectively).

GO enrichments
Hypergeometric functional GO enrichment of an overexpressed set of genes, including a correction for multiple
testing, was computed by the FuncAssociate [49].

Gene expression data
The gene expression of 78 tissues (including 21 brain regions)
was downloaded from the work of [23]. All of the analyzed
gene expression measurements were from the same
technology (Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133
Array Set HG-U133A; Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA)
and included two technical repeats (that we averaged). A list
of all of the tissue names and other properties appears in
Additional data file 12. The human tissue samples were
obtained from several sources: Clinomics Biosciences (Pittsfield, MA, USA), Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA), AllCells (Berkeley, CA, USA), Clonetics/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD,
USA), AMS Biotechnology (Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK), and
the University of California at San Diego. When samples from
four or more subjects were available, equal numbers of male
and female subjects were used to make two independent
pools; when fewer than four samples were available, RNA
samples were pooled, and duplicate amplifications were performed for each pool. (More details appear in supporting
Table 1 in [23].) We averaged the signals of all of the probes of
each gene to obtain a final set of 10,594 genes with both ER
measurements and gene expression measurements across all
tissues.
Gene expression of M. musculus (mouse) was downloaded
from [43]. It includes gene expression from 61 tissues. Fourteen of these tissues are brain tissues (2 cortical and 12 subcortical). The mouse gene expression appears in Additional
data file 13. The gene expression of P. troglodytes (chimp)
was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database [48] (GDS2678 record). It included 12 brain tissues; one
of them was subcortical and the others were all cortical.

Estimating gene age
An estimation of gene age was obtained following the procedure described in [21,22] (Figure 6b). First, we used the
homology search engine of BioMart (November 2007) to find
all of the orthologs of each of the human genes in a set of 34

Gene length and gene essentiality
Information about gene and protein lengths was downloaded
from EBI BioMart (BioMart August 2008). The information
about gene essentiality was based on the mouse phenotypic
data, and was downloaded from Mouse Genome Informatics
database [50]. Human genes whose mouse orthologs have
knockout phenotype of lethality or sterility were defined as
essential. That is, those entries possessing embryonic
lethality (MP: 0002080), prenatal lethality (MP: 0002081),
survival postnatal lethality (MP: 0002082), premature death
or induced morbidity (MP: 0002083), reproductive system
