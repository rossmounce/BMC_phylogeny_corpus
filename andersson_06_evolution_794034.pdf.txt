Abstract
Background: Lateral gene transfer (LGT) in eukaryotes from non-organellar sources is a
controversial subject in need of further study. Here we present gene distribution and phylogenetic
analyses of the genes encoding the hybrid-cluster protein, A-type flavoprotein, glucosamine-6phosphate isomerase, and alcohol dehydrogenase E. These four genes have a limited distribution
among sequenced prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and were previously implicated in gene
transfer events affecting eukaryotes. If our previous contention that these genes were introduced
by LGT independently into the diplomonad and Entamoeba lineages were true, we expect that the
number of putative transfers and the phylogenetic signal supporting LGT should be stable or
increase, rather than decrease, when novel eukaryotic and prokaryotic homologs are added to the
analyses.
Results: The addition of homologs from phagotrophic protists, including several Entamoeba
species, the pelobiont Mastigamoeba balamuthi, and the parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis, and a large
quantity of sequences from genome projects resulted in an apparent increase in the number of
putative transfer events affecting all three domains of life. Some of the eukaryotic transfers affect a
wide range of protists, such as three divergent lineages of Amoebozoa, represented by Entamoeba,
Mastigamoeba, and Dictyostelium, while other transfers only affect a limited diversity, for example
only the Entamoeba lineage. These observations are consistent with a model where these genes
have been introduced into protist genomes independently from various sources over a long
evolutionary time.
Conclusion: Phylogenetic analyses of the updated datasets using more sophisticated phylogenetic
methods, in combination with the gene distribution analyses, strengthened, rather than weakened,
the support for LGT as an important mechanism affecting the evolution of these gene families. Thus,
gene transfer seems to be an on-going evolutionary mechanism by which genes are spread between
unrelated lineages of all three domains of life, further indicating the importance of LGT from nonorganellar sources into eukaryotic genomes.

Background
During the past five years a number of reports have
appeared indicating that protists acquire genes via LGT [14]. Recently, phylogenomic analyses of the complete
genome sequences of Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium parvum indicated that several genes of these
human parasites, including some key metabolic enzymes,
most likely had been acquired from prokaryotes. 96 cases
of relatively recent LGT from prokaryotic sources were
reported for the former and 24 for the latter [5,6]. There
are reasons to believe that LGT actually does influence
protist genome evolution, since foreign genetic material is
constantly entering the cell via food organisms. In addition, many protists harbour prokaryotes or eukaryotes
(such as those that gave rise to secondary and tertiary plastids [7]) as endosymbionts. As a result, the occasional
incorporation of genes from engulfed cells into the
nucleus may facilitate a process of directional transfer of
genes from the food organisms to phagotrophic eukaryotes over evolutionary time [4,8]. There is a growing
amount of data that are consistent with this hypothesis.
For instance, LGT has mostly been detected in phagotrophic lineages [4,9]. Moreover, the introduced genes in
these lineages seem to have originated from organisms
sharing the same environment with the recipient organisms – the anaerobic diplomonad lineage was found to
have acquired genes from anaerobic prokaryotes in most
cases [10], 22% of candidate donors lineages in LGT cases
for Entamoeba histolytica involve relatives of the Bacteroides group which are abundant in human digestive tract
[5], while the alga Bigelowiella natans has acquired genes
mostly from other algae [9]. These observations are consistent with the idea that physical proximity in the environment of the donor and recipient lineages may greatly
enhance the probability of a successful gene transfer event
[11], a notion recently supported by phylogenetic analyses of 144 prokaryotic proteomes identifying gene pools
shared between organisms (including distantly related
one) occupying the same ecological niche [12].
Most of the claims of LGT in protists are based on unexpected phylogenetic relationships between protist and
prokaryotic sequences [2,4]. However, phylogenetic
methods are susceptible to systematic error that could
lead to false interpretations of transfer events [2]. For
example, a recent phylogenetic analysis indicated that the
hydrogenosomal NuoF protein from Trichomonas vaginalis
(a subunit of respiratory chain complex I) branched outside of a clade of mitochondrial homologs [8], leading the
authors to propose a separate (non-mitochondrial) origin
for this protein. However, these analyses failed to take
into account the heterogeneity of amino acid (aa) composition displayed by sequences in this dataset [13]. In contrast, when the dataset is analysed with methods designed
to avoid this potential artefact, the T. vaginalis sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

branched within the mitochondrial cluster [14], in agreement with the well-supported hypothesis that Trichomonas
hydrogenosomes share an evolutionary origin with mitochondria [15,16]. Similarly, Cpn60 phylogenies with different taxonomic samplings led to important differences
in the phylogenetic relationships amongst anaerobic protists including E. histolytica and two diplomonads (Giardia
and Spironucleus) eliminating the possibility of an LGT
event between Entamoeba and Giardia lineages[2,17]. In
both these cases, extreme divergence coupled with compositional biases in these sequences suggested, correctly,
their unexpected branching patterns were due to phylogenetic artefacts. In contrast, the phylogenetic analyses of
the alanyl and prolyl tRNA synthetases show the expected
phylogenetic relationships amongst prokaryotes and
eukaryotes with the exception that several protist
sequences were found nested within Archaea as sisters to
the Nanoarchaeota sequences. In this case, the observations could not be attributed to any known phylogenetic
artefacts and were most easily explained in [18] as gene
transfer events from the archaeal lineage to the protists.
Interpretations of phylogenetic analyses of proteins with a
more patchy distribution in the tree of life are more challenging than the cases described above. For example, gene
duplications followed by differential gene loss may also
yield the unexpected phylogenetic relationships that are
hallmarks of LGT. In addition, genes with a patchy distribution may only be present in one or a few lineages in
each organismal group making it potentially more difficult to identify donor and recipient lineages of gene transfer events since such assignments require that recipient
lineages are nested within the donor group. Fortunately,
the number of complete genome sequences is steadily
growing, and should clarify the patterns of gene distribution within the tree of life. In combination with thorough
phylogenetic studies, analyses of the presence and
absence of genes in completely sequenced genomes
should be very able to differentiate putative cases of gene
transfers in gene families with a patchy phylogenetic distribution from other scenarios [19].
To investigate whether phylogenetic artefacts, and/or
unappreciated gene duplication and loss events, have
influenced previous interpretations of LGT, we have
broadened the taxon sampling of four gene families with
patchy phylogenetic distributions, previously implicated
in gene transfer events in diplomonads and E. histolytica
[10]. The updated datasets – priS (encoding a hybrid-cluster protein), fprA (A-type flavoprotein), nagB (glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase), and adhE (alcohol
dehydrogenase E) – were also analysed using more
sophisticated phylogenetic methods. We have previously
argued that these four genes were introduced into the
genomes of diplomonads and Entamoeba from different

sources based on phylogenetic analyses [10]. If these previous observations were really indicative of LGT, increased
sampling of eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa should result
in an equal or increased number of distinct eukaryotic
groups in the phylogenetic analyses (i.e. eukaryotes would
be polyphyletic) and stronger support for tree topologies
consistent with LGT. Alternatively, a different pattern is
expected if the interpretation of gene transfers were based
on phylogenetic artefacts and/or differential losses. In the
former case, increased taxonomic sampling should, if anything, provide evidence for a common ancestry for the
diplomonad and Entamoeba sequences – as improved
within-clade taxonomic sampling tends to improve phylogenetic accuracy [20] – reducing the number of independent eukaryote groups observed. Alternatively, if the
'polyphyletic eukaryotes' pattern was due to ancient
duplications and poor paralog sampling, we would expect
newly sampled sequences to cluster in the different
eukaryotic clades and recover mirror eukaryotic phylogenies.
To test these alternative hypotheses, we focused our active
sampling of taxa to relatives of Entamoeba; the amphizoic
E. moshkovskii, the turtle parasite E. terrapinae, the snake
parasite E. invadens[21,22], and the more distantly related
free-living amoeboflagellate Mastigamoeba balamuthi
[23,24], and a putative relative of diplomonads; the parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis [18,25-27] (the cause of trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease in humans
[28]). In addition, we updated our datasets with all currently available homologous sequences in the public databases as well as from a number of ongoing genome
sequencing projects of eukaryotes. Our updated phylogenies using more sophisticated models of aa substitutions
in combination with analyses of the distribution pattern
of the genes indicate that gene transfer hypotheses currently best explain the data.

Results and discussion
Patchy distribution in eukaryotes
In a previous study we identified diplomonad genes
potentially derived from LGT [10]. Here we have tested if
alternative hypotheses and/or phylogenetic artefacts
could account for these observations. We have broadened
the eukaryotic taxon sampling of four genes with a limited
distribution among eukaryotes, both by cloning and
sequencing new genes and mining of the available
sequence databases. By using this approach we are also
able to refine the timing of putative LGT events with
respect to organismal divergences and to gain insights
into the evolution of gene families with a patchy distribution in general. All four genes were obtained from Entamoeba invadens, Entamoeba moshkovskii and Entamoeba
terrapinae, and priS, fprA and nagB (partial) sequences
were obtained from Mastigamoeba balamuthi with PCR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

using genomic DNA as template. Two T. vaginalis cDNA
clones (nagB and fprA) were also completely sequenced. A
T. vaginalis priS sequence and a M. balamuthi adhE
sequence had appeared in the databases since the previous analysis. Furthermore, a N. gruberi priS cDNA clone
was completely sequenced (see Additional File 1 for complete listing of the datasets). To further investigate the distribution of these genes in complete or nearly complete
genome sequences, we performed similarity searches
against available data from ongoing eukaryotic genome
projects and retrieved the significant BlastP hits. We also
combined these results with the information from published genomes and mapped the occurrences of the genes
onto the current hypothesis of organismal relationships
among eukaryotes (Figure 1) [29-31]. The four genes
show a very patchy distribution often with both presences
and absences within the same eukaryotic "super group".
Two extreme alternative explanations may be invoked to
explain these distribution pattern within eukaryotes; (i)
presence of all four genes in the last common eukaryotic
ancestor followed by many differential losses within the
"super groups", or (ii) absence of the genes in the ancestor
followed by independent gene acquisitions in all divergent lineages that possess the genes. The duplication and
gene loss scenario becomes less likely the more independent convergent gene loss events need to be postulated.
Therefore, phylogenetic analyses of the individual genes
should help to distinguish between these hypotheses.
Phylogenetic analyses
In our previous study we excluded sequences that showed
indications of a biased aa composition to reduce the
impact of phylogenetic artefacts due to compositional
heterogeneity where possible – the available methods at
the time assumed aa compositional homogeneity [10].
Here we approach this potential problem by including
analyses with methods and models that are designed to
mitigate the potential misleading effects of compositional
heterogeneity. Each aa in the alignments was recoded to
the six groups of chemically related aa that commonly
replace one another [32,33], an approach identical to the
recent analyses of the NuoF protein [14]. Previously, we
were also limited by the size of the datasets [10], since the
maximum likelihood (ML) methods were very computationally demanding at the time. The release of the PHYML
software solves this problem since it is able to perform
bootstrap analyses of a large number of sequences (>100)
in a reasonable computational time [34]. The recently
released ModelGenerator software also ensures the usage
of the optimal available model for aa substitutions in the
ML analyses [35]. These advances in the field of phylogenetics enabled us to perform more detailed analyses that
include all available members of each gene family. Information about the datasets and parameters for the phylogenetic analyses are listed in Additional File 2, and the

the four genes in the study. Please notice that the gene absences in the genomes that are close to completion are unconfirmed,
they may turn into presences upon publication. A and B refer to strongly separated groups in the phylogenetic analyses, as indicated in Figures 2-4 & 6. The priS genes encode the hybrid-cluster proteins, fprA genes encode the A-type flavoproteins, nagB
genes encode glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase proteins and the adhE genes encode the alcohol dehydrogenase E proteins.
phylogenetic trees with support values from the two
methods are shown in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
All datasets in the phylogenetic analyses with grouped aa
using the Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) strategy showed convergence, indicated by good
agreements between the split support values of the duplicate runs (Additional File 3). Two of the alignments (the
long version of glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase and
the prismane protein) also showed a good model composition fit indicated by both posterior predictive simulations and tests for homogeneity using X2 statistics and
simulations to get the null distribution (pt > 0.05 and
Psim > 0.05, respectively) [36], while the original datasets
did not (Psim < 0.05) (Additional File 2). This indicates
that the recoding procedure has reduced the potential
misleading effects of compositional heterogeneity in these
two analyses. The other three datasets (A-type flavoprotein, the short version of glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase, and alcohol dehydrogenase E) showed low pt and
Psim values (<0.05), suggesting that compositional heter-

ogeneity might still represent a source of artefactual
results in these datasets (Additional File 2). Nevertheless,
none of these grouped aa datasets failed the tests of the
model composition when the χ2 curve was used to get the
null distribution, while two of the these three original
datasets did, suggesting that the recoding procedure had
improved the model fit (Additional File 2), reducing the
potential for estimation biases. At the very least, these
analyses complement the more "standard" ML analyses by
showing what aspects of the phylogenies are robust to aa
recoding and reducing any potential effects of saturation.
The updated phylogenetic analyses show sequences
highly scrambled with respect to expected organismal
relationships (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), as previously observed
for these genes [10]. Thus, the earlier finding that these
proteins produce phylogenetic trees that are incompatible
with organismal phylogenies is robust with respect to
improved taxon sampling and more detailed phylogenetic
analyses – the number of eukaryotic groups (polyphyly)
in the trees have increased, rather than decreased. In all

analyses the eukaryotic sequences are found in at least two
distinct regions of the trees nested with prokaryotic
sequences (A and B boxes in Figures 2, 3, 4 & 6), which are
separated with strong support values. These strong separations could, in principle, be due to ancient duplication
events followed by a large number of differential losses.
Indeed, the presence of the same prokaryotic group in
both regions in several of the phylogenetic analyses – low
G+C Gram positives are for example found in both box A
and B in Figures 2 and 6 – superficially supports ancient
duplications. Such scenarios are expected to result in phylogenetic relationships for each paralog that mirror the
organismal relationships. This is not observed in our analyses (Figures 2, 3, 4 &6). Furthermore, duplication and
loss scenarios require that the gene was present in multiple copies in the last common universal ancestor and
retained for a long evolutionary time. Thus, to explain the
patterns we observe in the phylogenies (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5,
6) a eukaryotic ancestral genome that encoded a larger
number of distantly related paralogs of the four genes
than present in any of the extant eukaryote genomes
would have to be inferred (Figure 1). To our knowledge,
no data exist supporting a universal trend for drastic
genome shrinkage in a relative recent evolutionary time.
Therefore, gene duplication and differential losses alone
do not seem sufficient to explain the unexpected phylogenetic relationships observed in our analyses (Figures 2, 3,
4, 5, 6).

However, the number of independent gene losses has to
be weighed against the possibility of a later introduction
of the genes into eukaryotes by LGT events. Yet, as none of
the eukaryotic groups are found nested within a natural
prokaryotic group with strong bootstrap support (Figures
2, 3, 4, 5, 6), it is difficult to identify donor and recipient
lineages involved in the putative LGT events. Thus, the
presence of these genes in a subset of the sampled eukaryotes are neither easily explained by vertical inheritance of
the genes from the common ancestor of all eukaryotes,
nor by a distinct number of easily identified gene transfer
events. These phylogenies need to be carefully interpreted
in combination with analysis of gene distribution patterns, as well as in the context of the biology of the available organisms.
Hybrid-cluster protein
Genes for the hybrid-cluster protein (priS) have been
identified from a large number of prokaryotes, as well as
several eukaryotes (Figures 1 & 2). However, the cellular
function of the protein is not well established; potential
roles in the biological nitrogen cycle [37,38] and the
adaptive response to oxidative stress [39] have been suggested. Although the gene is found in all three domains of
life, its distribution within the domains are patchy; for
example, it is relatively widespread among proteobacterial
genomes, while it has only been found in a single high
G+C Gram positive species and a single cyanobacterium
(Figure 2). The occurrence of the gene in a large number
of unrelated lineages in combination with the absence

from more closely related species is most simply
explained by cross-species transmission via gene transfer.
Indeed, the phylogeny of the hybrid-cluster protein
strongly suggests a number of intra- and inter-domain
prokaryotic LGT events, with sequences from organismal
groups such as proteobacteria, low G+C Gram positives,
and euryarchaeota branching in several distinct regions of
the tree, often branching with unrelated lineages with
strong support values (Figure 2). The eukaryotes are found
within two large groups of sequences including both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

archaeal and bacterial homologs, separated by a long and
strongly supported branch (box A and B in Figure 2). One
clade contains two Trichomonas sequences that are the sole
eukaryotes in one of these groups (box B in Figure 2). A
prokaryote-to-eukaryote LGT event affecting the parabasalid lineage after the divergence from other eukaryotes,
including diplomonads, is a more parsimonious explanation for the position of the T. vaginalis sequences than loss
of this version of the gene in all other eukaryotic species,
provided T. vaginalis is not basal to all the other eukaryotes included in this analysis [18,25-27]. However, the
prokaryotic donor lineage for the T. vaginalis sequences is
difficult to determine from the current data and analyses.
The eukaryotic sequences found in the second group
within the hybrid-cluster protein phylogeny are found in
four polyphyletic groups (box A in Figure 2). However,
only one of these groups is separated from the other with
a significant statistical support; the Entamoeba sequences
form a weakly supported group with a cyanobacterial
sequence which are found as a sister group of three δ-proteobacterial sequences with a posterior probability of 1.00
in the grouped aa analysis. This is suggestive of a eubacteria-to-Entamoeba LGT event, perhaps with cyanobacteria
or δ-proteobacteria as the donor lineage (Figure 2). Thus,
at the very least the phylogeny of the hybrid-cluster protein suggests two transfer events from prokaryotic donors
into protists. Taken at face value, the tree also supports
additional transfers into various protist lineages. Indeed,
the diplomonad lineages are nested within proteobacterial sequences in both the ML and grouped aa Bayesian
analyses, although with weak statistical support in both
cases. At any rate, this observation is suggestive of a LGT
event from a proteobacterium to the diplomonad lineage.
Two α-proteobacterial sequences are nested within the
other eukaryotic priS sequences in box A with weak bootstrap support (Figure 2), which could indicate an origin
via endosymbiotic gene transfer. However, the absence of
the gene in mitochondrial genomes in combination with
its absence from the nuclear genome of most eukaryotes
related to pelobionts, diatoms, heterolobosea, and green
algae (Figure 1), makes such an origin doubtful. Still, the
weakly supported separation of diplomonad and these
eukaryotic sequences may be artefactual – in reality they
could represent a monophyletic group that inherited this
gene from their common ancestor. If so, at least eight
independent losses of priS in the apicomplexan/ciliate,
oomycete, land plant, parabasalid, kinetoplastid,
opisthokont, mycetozoan, and Entamoeba lineages would
have to be invoked (Figure 1). Since such widespread and
relatively recent independent losses appear unlikely, we
favour a scenario where also the N. gruberi, M. balamuthi,
T. pseudonana, and C. reinhardtii sequences have been distributed by an unknown number of gene transfer events
from unsampled prokaryotic lineages or between micro-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:27

bial eukaryotic lineages. So far the priS gene has only been
found in microbial eukaryotes. This circumstantially supports the hypothesis that the absence of a germ/soma separation in unicellular organisms increases their chance of
acquiring genes by LGT [4]. We predict that additional
taxon sampling will confirm the current trend of preferential presence in unicellular eukaryotes and will further
clarify the origins of the eukaryotic priS genes.
A-type flavoprotein
The fprA gene encodes A-type flavoprotein, a protein
recently inferred to play a role in the detoxification of
nitric oxide and/or oxygen in E. histolytica and was suggested to derive from a relatively recent LGT event from a
prokaryotic donor [5]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that T. vaginalis is able to degrade nitric oxide
under microaerophilic conditions, an activity proposed to
be associated with the presence of A-type flavoproteins in
these parasites [40]. Again, the gene is only found in a
subset of the sequenced prokaryotes – mostly species able
to grow in oxygen-poor environments (Figure 3). One
exception is the widespread presence of the A-type flavoprotein within cyanobacteria, possibly indicating that the
protein has evolved a different function within this group.
Consistent with this hypothesis the cyanobacterial
sequences are well separated from the other sequences in
the tree and have a unique alignment feature; they all
share a ~160 aa highly conserved C-terminal extension
that is absent from all other sequences. The phylogenetic
analyses of the A-type flavoprotein strongly indicate that
the fprA gene has been distributed between the prokaryotic groups via LGT, rather than by vertical inheritance,
since many groupings of unrelated prokaryotic taxa are
observed and supported by strong support values from
both analyses (Figure 3).

The eukaryotes are found in two clearly separated clusters.
The two diplomonad sequences are found together with a
Trichomonas sequence among a mixture of eubacterial and
archaeal species, indicating a prokaryote-to-eukaryote
gene transfer event to a hypothetical uniquely shared
ancestor of diplomonads and parabasalids (box B in Figure 3) – unless several independent gene losses are
inferred among a broad range of eukaryotic lineages (Figure 1). In the ML analysis, three additional Trichomonas
homologs are found weakly associated with the strongly
supported grouping of the Mastigamoeba and Entamoeba
sequences (box A in Figure 3), while the Entamoeba/Mastigamoeba clade is found a sister clade to the Clostridium perfringens sequences in the grouped aa analysis with a
posterior probability of 0.97 (data not shown). Thus, the
relationships between amoebozoan, parabasalid and
clostridial sequences are uncertain. However, Trichomonas
does not share a recent common ancestor with amoebozoa (Figure 1) suggesting that the fprA gene has been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

acquired by separate gene transfer events in these two
eukaryotic lineages. Alternatively, following a prokaryotic
LGT to one of the two eukaryotic lineages, a second LGT
took place between an ancestor of Entamoeba and a parabasalid. Interestingly, the three T. vaginalis sequences
share a ~450 aa C-terminal extension of about 39% identity with the Clostridium perfringens 3 fprA homolog (Figure 3 and Additional File 4). This sequence, and a 433 aa
long Clostridium tetani sequence (an FAD-dependent pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase:Rubredoxintype 38% identical to the T. vaginalis sequences) are the
most similar prokaryotic sequences in the public databases, while the most similar eukaryotic sequence, an
NADH dehydrogenase from E. histolytica previously identified to be of prokaryotic origin [41], is only 25% identical (Additional File 4). Such a taxonomic distribution of
this protein domain links the Trichomonas C-terminal
extensions with the Clostridium sequences rather than to
the eukaryotic sequences, suggesting that they originated
via a gene transfer event from a prokaryote donor. Thus,
both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the T.
vaginalis A-type flavoproteins likely have prokaryotic origins (see Additional File 4 for discussion of plausible scenarios).
The eukaryotic lineages that encode fprA are micro-aerophilic organisms that most likely have evolved from aerobic eukaryotes [15], and the prokaryotes found closest to
the eukaryotic sequences in the tree are found in oxygenpoor environments. These observations indicate that the
transfer of the gene occurred in such an environment. The
putative functional role of fprA in nitric oxide detoxification [40] indicate that these gene transfers might represent
metabolic adaptations that allowed these different
eukaryotes to better survive in anoxic environments. fprA
could be part of the gene pool shared between distantlyrelated organisms (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) that occupy
the same ecological niche.
Glucosamine-6-phosphate Isomerase
The nagB gene encodes glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase, an enzyme which is usually about 260 aa residues in
length and is required for the biosynthesis of the cyst wall
in Giardia [42]. Apart from low G+C Gram positives and
γ-proteobacteria, the nagB gene is only sparsely represented in eubacteria and not yet detected in archaea (Figure 4). It is also absent from several eukaryotic lineages
(Figure 1). In the phylogenetic tree of nagB, a strongly supported group including the Entamoeba, ciliate, mycetozoa,
pelobiont, parabasalid and several eubacterial sequences
was detected (box B in Figure 4). All these sequences, with
the exception of one of the Rhodopirellula baltica paralogs,
have a roughly 500 aa residue long homologous C-terminal extension of the protein with pair-wise identities
above 48%, which confirms the common ancestry of

Page 10 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:27

these sequences (Figure 4). To increase the resolution of
this group, a separate analysis was performed which only
included the sequences of the long version of the protein
and therefore was based on a larger number of positions
in the alignment – 560 unambiguously aligned aa residues compared to 229 (Figure 5). Interestingly, in both
analyses, pelobiont and Entamoeba sequences form a
group with the ciliate sequences. In the ML analyses the
mycetozoan Dictyostelium discoideum is found as a sister to
these sequences with a bootstrap support of 56% (Figure
5), while the Rhodopirelulla baltica 4 sequence is found as
the immediate outgroup to the ciliate/Mastigamoeba/Entamoeba sequences with a posterior probability of 0.45 in
the grouped aa analysis (data not shown). These weakly
supported and partly incongruent phylogenies could be
rationalized in the following ways: (i) a phylogenetic artefact splitting the amoebozoa sequences, in combination
with differential gene loss in all sampled eukaryotic
genomes with only the currently sampled ciliates and
amoebozoa retaining nagB (Figure 1), (ii) inter-domain
gene transfers events from closely related, but yet unsampled, prokaryotes to the amoebozoa and ciliate lineages,
or (iii) the presence of the long version of nagB in the
common amoebozoan ancestor followed by a transfer
event to the ciliate lineage. Although none of the alternatives can be excluded, we favour the third explanation,
since the expected topology within the amoebozoa is
recovered, albeit with only weak bootstrap support from
the ML analysis (Figure 5), if a single intra-domain LGT
event is inferred. Furthermore, ciliates are known to eat
other protists [43,44], indicating that a gene transfer event
from an amoebozoan to a ciliate is feasible at least in principle [8]. Further taxonomic sampling of eukaryotic and
prokaryotic genomes is obviously needed, especially
within the two particular eukaryotic groups concerned, to
distinguish between the different plausible scenarios. In
any case, the Mastigamoeba and Entamoeba sequences form
a strongly supported group that indicates the presence of
the gene in their common ancestor.
In contrast, the Trichomonas homolog, that encodes the
long version of the enzyme, and diplomonads, that
encode the short version, have distinct origins. While the
parabasalid gene likely originated via a gene transfer
event, possibly from a eubacteria within the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group (Figure 5), the source of the
diplomonad genes remains uncertain. The separation
from other eukaryotes in box A appear robust with strong
bootstrap support from both of the analyses with all taxa
(Figure 4), as well as an additional analysis where the box
B sequences and prokaryotic long branches were excluded
(Additional File 5). Thus, the separation of the diplomonad sequences from the eukaryotic sequences in box A
is unlikely a result of long-branch attraction; an LGT event

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

from an unsampled eubacterial lineage seems like a more
likely explanation (Figure 4).
The topology of the tree relating the opisthokont
sequences to other eukaryotic lineages and prokaryotes is
not easy to explain simply by vertical inheritance (box A
in Figure 4); the metazoan sequences are grouped together
as expected, but the fungi are split into one main group
and a smaller group with three budding yeast sequences.
The separation between the two fungal groups is supported by both analyses (Figure 4). In fact, the budding
yeasts are found with the other fungi only in 1% of the
bootstrap replicates in the ML analyses (including the
analysis without long branches) and never among the
2000 sampled trees in the grouped aa analysis. Furthermore, the eukaryotes within box A are never found as a
monophyletic group among the 500 bootstrap replicates
in any of the ML analyses, and with a posterior probability
of only 0.02 in the grouped aa analysis (data not shown).
Collectively, these results indicate that the fungal nagB
genes likely have separate origins; a recent introduction of
a nagB gene into a common ancestor of the three budding
yeast lineages Debaryomyces, Candida, and Yarrowia seems
like a reasonable scenario.
The Dictyostelium sequence is found as a sister to a Fusobacterium sequence in the two ML analyses (Figure 4 and
Additional File 5), while the sequence is nested between
the three budding yeast sequences and the other
sequences in box A in Figure 4 in the grouped aa analysis
with posterior probabilities for the separations of 0.95
and 0.90, respectively (data not shown). The separation to
the metazoan/fungi/euglenozoan group is strong also in
the ML analysis; the Dictyostelium sequence indeed never
branches with this group in any of the bootstrap replicates
in the full analysis or the analysis where long branches
were excluded (data not shown). Accordingly, the phylogenetic analyses indicate that a gene acquisition from a
prokaryotic lineage is a plausible explanation for the origin of the Dictyostelium sequence, rather than a shared
ancestry with the other eukaryotic sequences within box
A.
Alcohol dehydrogenase E
Alcohol dehydrogenase E is a key enzyme in the energy
metabolism of type I "amitochondriate" protists (i.e.
those that lack energy-producing mitochondria or
hydrogenosomes) [45], since it catalyzes the conversion
of acetyl-CoA to ethanol in a two-step reaction which oxidizes two molecules of NADH to NAD+ [46]. We
expanded the dataset with adhE genes from three additional Entamoebaspecies. The failure to detect an adhE
homolog in T. vaginalis in the ongoing genome project
[47] was expected, since this organism contains hydrogenosomes (type II "amitochondrial" protist), and there-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:27

fore utilizes a different set of enzymes in their energy
metabolism [45]. Interestingly, alcohol dehydrogenase E
genes have been detected in the anaerobic chytrid fungus
Piromyces sp. E2, which indeed does contain hydrogenosomes [48]. However, energy metabolism of chytrids is
clearly different from that of type II amitochondriate protists such as Trichomonas – chytrids exhibit a bacterial-type
mixed-acid fermentation [48]. The finding of alcohol
dehydrogenase E in two green algal species, where the protein functions in aerobic mitochondria, indicates that the
diversity of its functional role in eukaryotes is not fully
understood [49].
The phylogenetic tree supports our earlier interpretations
that LGT has played an important role in the evolution of
this gene [10,49], with a number of strongly supported
prokaryotic relationships that most easily are explained by
gene transfer events (Figure 6) – the gene is only rarely
found outside low G+C Gram positives and γ-proteobacteria. The additional Entamoeba sequences form a group
with the E. histolytica sequence, indicating the presence of
the gene in the common ancestor of these Entamoeba species, while the Mastigamoeba sequence clearly has a distinct origin from that of its amoebozoan sisters, as
observed previously [49]. The position of the Entamoeba
sequences within a eubacterial group strongly suggests a
prokaryote-to-eukaryote LGT event. Sequences from two
diplomonads, two green algae, a single apicomplexan,
and a chytrid fungus are found in the same region of the
tree as the Mastigamoeba sequence (box B in Figure 6).
However, relatives of these organisms are known to lack
the gene (Figure 1), arguing in favour of recent independent introductions of the gene, rather than an ancestral
presence followed by differential gene loss. The green
algal sequences are found as sisters to the single cyanobacterial sequence (Figure 6) with moderate to strong statistical support from both analyses, indicating a transfer event
between the lineages. This seems ecologically reasonable
since ancestors of these lineages could have been found in
the same environment. Although the observed topology
could be explained by endosymbiotic gene transfer from
the plastid, the fact that land plants are lacking the gene,
the absence of the gene from extant plastid genomes, and
the localization of the protein in green algal mitochondria
[49] makes a gene transfer independent of the plastid
endosymbiosis somewhat more likely. Also the Mastigamoeba sequence is separated from the other eukaryotic
sequences in this region with strong and moderate support from the grouped aa and ML analyses, respectively
(box B in Figure 6), clearly suggesting an origin via LGT,
maybe from an unsampled prokaryotic lineage.
The diplomonad, fungal, and apicomplexan alcohol
dehydrogenases are found in a weakly supported cluster
in both analyses. This suggests eukaryote-to-eukaryote

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

gene transfer events, although the donor and recipient lineages are difficult to infer. Indeed, it has earlier been suggested that the green algal adhE could have been acquired
by the algae from parasitizing chytrid fungi or from
foraminiferan hosts to endosymbiotic algae [49], and
similar interactions between these lineages could be
invoked to explain the exchange of adhE genes. Interestingly, Cryptosporidium, Piromyces and many diplomonads
are all anaerobes or microaerophiles, and many share
similar, if not identical, environments; the digestive tract
of various mammals. This could have facilitated gene
sharing via LGT between these distantly related eukaryotic
lineages, although independent acquisitions from unsampled prokaryotes cannot be excluded. Interestingly, these
three distantly related eukaryotic lineages most likely have
adapted to an anaerobic lifestyle independently [15], and
the putative acquisition of adhElikely represented independent metabolic adaptations to this environment. As
for the priS gene (Figure 2), our prediction is that future
genome sampling will only uncover adhE genes among
microbial taxa since the distribution of adhE is restricted
to microbial eukaryotes.
LGT events as phylogenetic markers
LGT is usually expected to confound efforts to reconstruct
organismal relationships, since it decouples the historical
signals in the gene sequences from organismal lineages
[50]. However, gene transfer events can also be informative in a specific case; the shared possession of a transferred gene may indicate a phylogenetic relationship
between the lineages that possess the transferred gene to
the exclusion of the lineages that lack it. There certainly
are limitations for such interpretations; the gene could
have been lost in some of the descendants of the recipient
lineage and additional transfers can complicate the correct
identification of donor and recipient lineages. In any case,
gene transfer events are a potentially very important
source of information about organismal relationships
[18,51], especially for protists where the molecular data
are scarce and phylogenetic reconstructions are difficult
[52].

For example, the phylogenetic positions of pelobionts
and Entamoeba have been difficult to resolve with molecular markers. Analyses of ribosomal RNA only weakly
grouped these together [21], while more recently, based
on a number of protein markers, it was conclusively
shown that these two groups share a common ancestor to
the exclusion of other eukaryotes [23,24]. Interestingly,
the Entamoeba sequences strongly group together with the
Mastigamoeba sequence in two of the four analyses discussed here, fprA and nagB (Figures 3 & 5). This suggests
that these genes were present in the ancestor of Mastigamoeba and Entamoeba, providing further support for a specific relationship between these two eukaryotic lineages.

Summary putative lateral gene transfers affecting amoeboSummary of putative lateral gene transfers affecting
amoebozoa, ciliates, and diplomonads, and parabasalids. Lateral gene transfers inferred from Figures 2-6, as well
as previously published phylogenetic analyses [10, 18] discussed in the text, are indicated on the topology; gene transfers from prokaryotes are indicated by black arrows, intraeukaryote transfers between the groups are indicated by
orange arrows, and gene introduced from uncertain origins
are indicated by grey arrow. Please notice that the figure
does not delineate the order of individual transfer events on
each branch, and that plausible alternative hypotheses do
exist to explain some of the unexpected phylogenetic positions of eukaryotes, here indicated as gene transfer events,
our currently preferred hypothesis (see text for details).

Furthermore, the higher eukaryotic taxon Amoebozoa
[23,24] is reflected in the phylogeny of one of these genes,
nagB (Figure 5), provided one accepts the recovered gene
phylogeny that indicates a possible gene transfer from
within this group to a ciliate lineage. If robust, this
branching pattern could allow one to make inferences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

about the relative timing of divergences within Amoebozoa and the Ciliophora. However, improved taxonomic
sampling of the nagB gene within both groups of protists
will be needed to solidify such inferences. Finally, the
absence of fprA in the Dictyostelium discoideum genome
suggests that the presence of this eubacterial gene within
various Amoebozoa lineages might be used as a synapomorphy for discerning phylogenetic relationships within
the group.
Similarly, diplomonads and parabasalids have been suggested to share a common ancestor, initially mainly based
on weak evidence from molecular data [53,54]. The case
for this relationship was recently strengthened by the
identification of two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes
that appear to have been transferred to a common ancestor of the two lineages [18] and recent phylogenetic analyses of concatenated protein alignments [25-27]. The
observation of a transfer of a gene encoding A-type flavoprotein to a uniquely shared ancestor of the two lineages
(Figure 3) further supports their specific relationship. The
identification of these three genes of prokaryotic origin
shared between diplomonads and parabasalids in other
lineages within Excavata should be useful to pinpoint
relationships within this poorly resolved and diverse
group of eukaryotes.
The timing of transfers relative to eukaryote diversification
The relative timing of the transfers can be addressed in
more detail with our increased taxon sampling (Figure 7).
For reasons outlined above, probably none of the four
genes was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor
indicating that all putative transfers almost certainly happened in a more recent evolutionary time (Figure 7).
However, all four genes were transferred to the diplomonad lineage before the split between Giardia and Spironucleus – they branch together in the phylogenetic
reconstructions (Figures 2, 3, 4 & 6). With the sampling of
Trichomonas homologs for three of the genes and the
absence of the fourth, we now can date the transfers of
priS, nagB, and adhE to after the split between diplomonads and parabasalids [18,25-27], but before the divergence of the two major groups of diplomonads [55]
(Figure 7). The fourth gene (fprA) was most likely introduced into the diplomonads lineage before the split of
parabasalids, but after their divergence to the other
eukaryotic lineages.

Similarly, the putative transfers previously found to be
affecting the Entamoeba lineage [10] can be dated in more
detail with our updated datasets. The Entamoeba
sequences branch together in the phylogenetic reconstructions for all genes, indicating that the genes were present
in the common ancestor of the four species included in
the analysis (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). For the other two genes,

Page 13 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:27

priS and adhE, the separation of the Entamoeba and Mastigamoeba sequences is strongly supported (Figures 2 & 6),
indicating that the transfer event to the Entamoeba lineage
probably happened after the split between Entamoeba and
pelobionts, but before the divergence of the Entamoeba
species [21]. A similar pattern was observed for the gene
encoding alanyl-tRNA synthetase, where the ancestral
eukaryotic version was replaced by a homolog from the
parabasalid lineage in Entamoeba after the split from the
Mastigamoeba [18]. The timing of the transfer of the priS
gene is more difficult to pinpoint since the separation of
the Entamoeba and Mastigamoeba sequences is only weakly
supported by the bootstrap analyses (Figure 2). As mentioned above, nagB and fprA most likely were present in
the common ancestor of Mastigamoeba and Entamoeba,
and the recipient of the nagB gene most likely was a common ancestor also of Dictyostelium, indicating that the
transfer of these genes probably were more ancient events
than the transfers of priS and adhE (Figure 7). The multiple copies found in one or more of the Entamoeba species
for priS, and fprA are most likely due to recent gene duplication events within the Entamoeba lineages (Figures 2 &
3), a pattern also observed from the analysis of the partial
genome sequence of E. invadens[56]. Interestingly, one of
the two E. invadens priS sequences has a frameshift due to
an eight nucleotide long deletion in the middle of the
gene (this is unlikely to be due to a methodological artefact as several different PCR products gave identical
sequences). This frameshift probably reflects the dynamics of the evolution of gene families in the Entamoeba lineage with frequent gene duplication followed by
inactivation of some of the paralogs by accumulation of
deleterious mutations.
Among the four sampled genes, the absence of gene transfer occurring within the Entamoeba and diplomonad
groups is probably an indication that the evolutionary
times since the split of these respective groups are short in
comparison to the time since the last common eukaryotic
ancestor, rather than an indication that the rate of interdomain transfers have decreased in more recent evolutionary time. Indeed, one of the fifteen genes in the previous analysis, pyrG which encodes CTP synthetase, was
probably introduced independently into the Giardia and
Spironucleus lineages [10]. However, the data are still
scarce, and additional sampling of genes from diverse protist lineages could change the inferences of the timing of
the transfers of individual genes presented here (Figure 7).
Nevertheless, the data from our four genes, in combination with previously published data [10,18], support a
scenario where prokaryotic genes from various lineages
have been transferred into eukaryotic lineages continuously over time (Figure 7).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

A link between gene transfers and feeding habits in
phagotrophic protists and their shared ecological niche?
An interesting pattern where the studied protists mostly
acquire genes from prokaryotes was observed (Figure 7).
This may be explained by a preference for growing in
prokaryote rich environments and consuming prokaryotes by the four groups of phagotrophic protists investigated in this study – diplomonads, parabasalids,
pelobionts and Entamoeba, since uptake of DNA from
ingested cells is possibly an important mechanism enabling LGT in eukaryotes [4,8]. Indeed, diplomonads generally feed on prokaryotes [57] and several prokaryote-toeukaryote gene transfer events have been described for
this eukaryotic group (Figure 7) [10,41,58,59], while, to
our knowledge, no strong case of gene transfer event from
a eukaryote lineage to diplomonads has been described
yet. Entamoeba, on the other hand, is able to ingest both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes; it can be maintained in monoxenic cultures with bacteria as well as trypanosomatid
flagellates [60,61]. The Entamoeba lineage was recently
suggested as the recipient lineage in a eukaryote-toeukaryote gene transfer event of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase gene from the parabasalid lineage [18] (Figure 7),
although most gene transfer events affecting Entamoeba
seem to involve prokaryotic donor lineages (Figures 2, 3,
4, 5, 6) [5,10].

In this study, the donor and recipient lineages could be
inferred in one putative eukaryote-to-eukaryote gene
transfer event with reasonable support; ciliates were
hypothesized to have acquired a gene from an Amoebozoa lineage (Figures 5 and 7). Interestingly, ciliates were
also previously shown to represent the recipient lineage in
an intra-domain transfer of the alanyl-tRNA synthetase
gene [18] (Figure 7). It is possible that the recipient lineage of these two transfers – an ancestor of Paramecium and
Tetrahymena – tended to preferentially graze on eukaryotic
protists rather than bacteria and was therefore exposed to
eukaryotic DNA leading to LGT events; ciliates are indeed
known to eat both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [43,44].
Similarly, dinoflagellates are known to graze on eukaryotes [62] and have been identified as the recipient lineage
in eukaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfer events [63,64]. If
this pattern holds up in light of more data, it suggests that
there is a link between the genome evolution and the food
content in phagotrophic protists – indicating that an
understanding of eating habits is important to our understanding of gene transfer in the evolution of phagotrophic
protists, as postulated by Doolittle [8]. Global proteome
phylogenies from 144 prokaryotes indicate that LGT has
created pools of shared genes between distantly related
prokaryotes occupying the same niche [12], such as mammalian mucosa. Our present analyses extend these observations to microbial eukaryotes with shared genes
between microorganisms thriving on mammalian

mucosa such as the trichomonads, diplomonads, apicomplexans, Piromyces and Entamoeba.

Methods
Sources of DNA
Entamoeba invadens (strain IP-1, ATCC 30994), E. moshkovskii (strain FIC, ATCC 30041), E. terrapinae (strain M,
ATCC 30043) were cultured in LYI-S-2 medium at room
temperature [61], Mastigamoeba balamuthi (ATCC 30984)
were cultured in PYGC medium [65], and Naegleria gruberi
(strain NEG-M, ATCC 30224) were cultured in modified
PYNFH medium (ATCC medium 1034, cat. no. 327-X) at
room temperature. The cells were harvested, followed by
lysis in 0.25% SDS/0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0, and genomic
DNAs were purified using a cetyl trimethylammonium
bromide extraction (CTAB) method [66]. Trichomonas vaginalis (strain G3) nagB and fprA cDNA clones were identified in the ongoing EST project (Hirt, R.P., Embley, T.M.,
and Harriman, N.), and two priS Naegleria gruberi (strain
NEG-M, ATCC 30224) cDNA clones were identified in an
ongoing EST project (Sjögren, Å.M., Andersson, J.O., Gill,
E., Roger, A.J., unpublished).
PCR and sequencing
Exact match PCR primers to obtain Entamoeba genes for
independent sequencing were designed based on
sequences available from the website of the ongoing
genome projects [67] that showed similarity to the studied genes. If no such sequences were available, degenerate
primers were designed against conserved regions of the
alignments. Using different combinations of these primers the four genes were successfully amplified using
genomic DNA in PCR reactions. The Mastigamoeba priS
sequence was amplified using degenerate primers and
genomic DNA, while the Mastigamoeba nagB and fprA
were PCR amplified from genomic DNA using exactmatch primers designed from cDNA sequences available
from an in-house EST project and published [23] cDNA
projects, respectively. The N. gruberi priS sequence was
amplified from genomic DNA using exact match PCR
primers based on cDNA sequences. The PCR products
were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit
(Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and directly sequenced using
the ABI PRISM BigDye Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the primers
used in the amplification as well as internal primers.
Introns were identified and removed before the subsequent phylogenetic analyses from the obtained M. balamuthi nagB, priS, and fprA sequences.
Assembly of the datasets
All available homologs for the four genes were retrieved
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
[68]. In addition, similarity searches against sequences
released from ongoing eukaryotic genome projects were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/27

performed to identify and retrieve additional eukaryotic
homologs of the genes from ongoing genome projects at
various genome sequences centres. Additional priS, and
fprA T. vaginalis sequences, and nagB sequences from Tetrahymena thermophila, Trypanosoma. bruci, and Trypanosoma cruzi were retrieved from the Institute for Genomic
Research [69]. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii priS and adhE
sequences, and a Thalassiosira pseudonana priS sequence
were retrieved from the DOE Joint Genome Institute [70].
Finally, a nagB sequences from Leishmania major and Paramecium tetraurelia were retrieved from the Wellcome
Trust Sanger Institute [71], and Genoscope [72], respectively. None of the four genes could be detected among
the available Phytophthora sojae sequences [70].
The aa sequence datasets were aligned using CLUSTALW
[73], manually adjusted, and visually inspected to identify
unambiguously aligned regions suitable for phylogenetic
reconstructions. Only one sequence among pairs with
>95% aa sequence identity within the unambiguously
aligned regions were retained for further analyses. Finally,
all sequences that covered less than one third of the
unambiguously aligned regions were excluded. The accessions numbers and other details of the sequences within
the datasets are listed in Additional File 1, and the alignments used in the study are available as Additional Files 6,
7, 8, 9. In the previously analyses data from unpublished
prokaryotic genome projects were included [10], while
only published prokaryotic sequences were included in
the present analyses. Therefore, the Carboxydothermus
sequence and the single Clostridium sequence, and the
Carboxydothermus and Fibrobacter sequences are present in
the previous priS and fprA analyses, respectively, but missing from the current datasets.
Phylogenetic analyses
The optimal aa substitution model for each dataset was
selected using the program ModelGenerator, recently
developed by T. M. Keane, T. J. Naughton, and J. O. McInerney, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Ireland
[35]. Protein maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies
were inferred using PHYML, version 2.4.4 [34] with the
optimal substitution model, and bootstrap support values
were calculated based on 500 resampled datasets. Most
currently available phylogenetic methods cannot deal
with strong aa compositional heterogeneity in the data
[74], which may lead to false interpretations of evolutionary events[2,14]. Therefore, we also performed phylogenetic analyses using an approach that ameliorates (or
mitigates) the compositional heterogeneity, as recently
described in the analyses of the NuoF protein [14]. The aa
alignments were recoded into six categories corresponding to the PAM matrix (and most other matrices) as follows: (1) ASTGP, (2) DNEQ, (3) RKH, (4) MVIL, (5) FYW
and (6) C [32]. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were per-

Page 15 of 18

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:27

formed on these grouped aa alignments using the program p4 [36]. This allowed the use of a 6 × 6 general timereversible rate matrix with free parameters rather than a
fixed empirical matrix. The among-site rate variation
(ASRV) was chosen by the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) based on ML on the neighbor-joining tree. All
parameters, including the composition and substitution
rate matrix, were free, and the analysis used the Metropolis-coupled MCMC strategy from MrBayes [75]. Runs were
done in duplicate for 106 generations. The first halves
were discarded as burn-in, while the second halves of both
runs were combined for calculating the consensus trees.
Convergence was assessed by plotting the split support
values >0.10 in the two independent runs against each
other (Additional File 3). One dataset (the short version
of glucosamine-6-phosophate) did not converge well
(data not shown) and was rerun in duplicate for 2 × 106
generations, and the analyses converged under these conditions (Additional File 3). The model fit of the composition was assessed using different approaches. Posterior
predictive simulations were performed on the grouped aa
datasets [36]. If the tail area probabilities (pt) is low
(<0.05), the model composition does not fit the composition of the dataset. Also, tests for compositional homogeneity using X2 statistics were performed for both the
original non-grouped and the grouped aa datasets using
simulations to get the expected null distribution from the
obtained trees and preferred substitution models used in
the analyses [36]. The more widely used X2-tests for compositional homogeneity using the χ2 curve as the null distributions are only included for comparison since they fail
to take the tree-based correlation of compositions among
taxa into account [36] (Additional File 2).
