Abstract
Background: Rhodoferax ferrireducens is a metabolically versatile, Fe(III)-reducing, subsurface microorganism that
is likely to play an important role in the carbon and metal cycles in the subsurface. It also has the unique ability to
convert sugars to electricity, oxidizing the sugars to carbon dioxide with quantitative electron transfer to graphite
electrodes in microbial fuel cells. In order to expand our limited knowledge about R. ferrireducens, the complete
genome sequence of this organism was further annotated and then the physiology of R. ferrireducens was
investigated with a constraint-based, genome-scale in silico metabolic model and laboratory studies.
Results: The iterative modeling and experimental approach unveiled exciting, previously unknown physiological
features, including an expanded range of substrates that support growth, such as cellobiose and citrate, and
provided additional insights into important features such as the stoichiometry of the electron transport chain and
the ability to grow via fumarate dismutation. Further analysis explained why R. ferrireducens is unable to grow via
photosynthesis or fermentation of sugars like other members of this genus and uncovered novel genes for
benzoate metabolism. The genome also revealed that R. ferrireducens is well-adapted for growth in the subsurface
because it appears to be capable of dealing with a number of environmental insults, including heavy metals,
aromatic compounds, nutrient limitation and oxidative stress.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that combining genome-scale modeling with the annotation of a new
genome sequence can guide experimental studies and accelerate the understanding of the physiology of understudied yet environmentally relevant microorganisms.

Background
Rhodoferax ferrireducens is of interest because of its potentially important role in carbon and metal cycling in soils
and sediments and its novel ability to convert sugars into
electricity [1]. R. ferrireducens, which was isolated from
subsurface sediments in Oyster Bay, VA, is a facultative
anaerobic microorganism in the Comamonadaceae family
of the Betaproteobacteria [2]. It is one of the few known facultative microorganisms that can grow anaerobically by
oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide with
Fe(III) serving as the electron acceptor. This property, as
well as its ability to grow at the low temperatures found in
many subsurface environments, suggests that it could contribute to the oxidation of organic matter coupled to the
reduction of Fe(III) in many soils and sediments. Microorganisms closely related to R. ferrireducens have been
detected in a number of subsurface environments [3-7].
The novel ability of R. ferrireducens to oxidize sugars to
carbon dioxide with quantitative electron transfer to electrodes in microbial fuel cells is of interest because of the
possibility of using sugars as a renewable energy source for
power production [1,8,9].
R. ferrireducens has a number of important physiological
characteristics that distinguishes it from other members of
the genus Rhodoferax. For example, it appears to be unable
to grow phototrophically [2], a previous hallmark feature
of the genus [10,11]. Furthermore, unlike other Rhodoferax species, R. ferrireducens cannot grow anaerobically via
fructose fermentation. No other Rhodoferax species have
been shown to grow via anaerobic respiration, whereas R.
ferrireducens can grow by oxidizing a wide variety of
organic electron donors, such as acetate, lactate, propionate, pyruvate, succinate, malate and benzoate, with Fe(III)
serving as the electron acceptor [2]. In addition to Fe(III),
R. ferrireducens can utilize Mn(IV) oxide, fumarate, and
nitrate as electron acceptors to support anaerobic growth
[2].
The production of linear polyesters in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) [2] is an interesting characteristic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/447

of R. ferrireducens with important biotechnological implications. PHAs are typically synthesized in bacteria from
sugars or lipids and have industrial interest due to their
properties as thermoplastics and elastomers [12].
In order to further elucidate the physiology of R. ferrireducens, the publicly available genome sequence http://
www.jcvi.org/cms/research/projects/cmr was annotated
in more detail and a genome-scale metabolic model was
reconstructed using the constraint-based modeling
approach [13-15]. Constraint-based modeling couples
stoichiometric reconstructions of all known metabolic
reactions in the organism with a set of constraints on the
fluxes of each of these reactions in the system. This
approach unveiled a variety of previously unknown physiological features of R. ferrireducens that contributed to a
better understanding of its potential role in subsurface
environments and converting organic compounds to electricity.

Results and Discussion
General features of the genome
The Rhodoferax ferrireducens genome as sequenced and
assembled by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) [16] consists of a circular chromosome of 4,712,337 base pairs
(bp) and a plasmid with 257,447 bp. Manual curation of
this sequence predicted a total of 4451 coding sequences
(CDSs) from the chromosome and 319 CDSs from the
plasmid (Figure 1, Table 1). Of the chromosomally
located CDSs, BLAST searches matched 3,830 to a database of Proteobacterial proteins, by selecting for alignments with a 70% length requirement, 35% identity and
an e-value less than 1 e-5. Analysis of the best BLAST match
for each CDS against the database of Proteobacterial proteins established the taxonomic breakdown as follows:
Betaproteobacteria (3,253 genes), Gammaproteobacteria
(258), Alphaproteobacteria (185), Delta/Epsilonproteobacteria (121), and unclassified Proteobacteria (13). Beyond
examining best BLAST matches, the "BLAST Curves" analysis was also employed. BLAST Curves (Figure 2) visually
display the number of genes in each percent identity bin,

and each color-coded curve corresponds to matches to a
particular genome in the BLAST database. By comparing
the profiles of all the curves in the graph, relative rankings
of completely sequenced Proteobacterial genomes in the
BLAST database can be elucidated for R. ferrireducens. For
example, a curve having a profile with a peak on the right
side of the graph, which indicates high percent identity
matches to R. ferrireducens, is ranked higher than a curve
displaying a peak on the left side of the graph. An important note concerning BLAST Curves is that a database
genome with a lower absolute number of matches can

have a more significant ranking if it has a high percent
identity profile compared to another genome with a
higher absolute number of low percent identity matches.
As shown in Figure 2, the genomes in the BLAST database,
which are most closely related to R. ferrireducens, are
Polaromonas sp. JS666 and Polaromonas napthtalenivorans

In silico constraint-based modeling as a tool to gain new
insights into the physiology of R. ferrireducens
Development of the constraint-based in silico model
Of the 4770 genes in the R. ferrireducens genome used for
developing the in silico model, 744 genes were included in
the reconstructed genome-scale network. The R. ferrireducens metabolic model contains 762 reactions and 790
metabolites, including 69 extracellular metabolites (Table
2). A detailed list of genes, reactions, metabolites, and

Of the 319 predicted CDSs in the plasmid, BLAST searches
matched only 69 to a database of Proteobacterial proteins,
using the same criteria used for the chromosome (see
above). These include possible conjugation proteins, 3
integrases separated by large spans of hypothetical proteins, a helicase, a DNA methylase, a gene for DNA repair
protein RadA, a copy of polymerase DnaN (different from
the chromosome copy), at least 6 CRISPR cas genes, a
DNA ligase, a thymidine kinase, 3 secretion proteins, 2
sensor histidine kinases, and possible type 4 pilin proteins. An unusual finding was a copy of a tRNA-Ile, which
is different in sequence from the identical copies in the
chromosome but shares the same anticodon.

gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations in the metabolic model are available in Additional file 1. The functional characterization of the 762 reactions in the model
is summarized in Figure 3. Among different functional
groups, reactions for biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids
and cell wall components, cofactors, and nucleic acids are
the most abundant, accounting for 65% of all the reactions. Currently, there are 77 reactions associated with
transporting metabolites, including redundant transporters for the extracellular metabolites.
Stoichiometry of the electron transport chain
The model incorporates two types of maintenance energy
parameters: the growth-associated maintenance (GAM),
which reflects the energy cost during division (e.g. protein
polymerization); and the non-growth associated maintenance (NGAM), which reflects the basal energy requirement of the cell regardless of growth. Based on the
similarity in biomass composition between R. ferrireducens and E. coli, the GAM was set at 59.81 mmol ATP/gdw
h, the same as the E. coli model [21]. Three independent
sets of physiological and growth data were used to determine the NGAM and the stoichiometry of the electron
transport chain of the genome-scale model of R. ferrireducens: 1) acetate and fumarate, 2) acetate and Fe(III) [2]
and 3) citrate and Fe(III) (see Methods for growth conditions). In order to determine the most consistent values
with experimentally determined growth yields, an optimization algorithm (Figure 4A) iterated the H+/2e- ratio of
NADH dehydrogenase from 1 to 4, the H+/2e- ratio of
cytochrome reductase from 1 to 4, and the NGAM from 0
to 2.5 mmol ATP/gdw h. This process identified optimal
energy parameters of an H+/2e- ratio of 2 for both NADH
dehydrogenase and cytochrome reductase, and an NGAM
of 0.45 mmol ATP/gdw h (Figure 4B). This set of energy
parameters was applied to the metabolic model in simulations to compare between in silico predictions and experimentally determined yields. A fourth set of experimental
data, obtained from a batch culture grown on fumarate as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/447

the electron donor and acceptor, was used to validate the
model. The biomass yield of fumarate was calculated by
constraining fumarate, succinate, and acetate fluxes to
simulate the experimental conditions, and the yields
obtained through the simulation closely matched the
actual experimental results (Figure 4C). The use of fumarate as electron donor and acceptor by R. ferrireducens is
further described in the fumarate dismutation section.
It is interesting to point out that the obtained NGAM for
the R. ferrireducens genome-scale model is similar to that
of G. sulfurreducens, another acetate-oxidizing Fe(III)
reducer [22] often found in the same microbial niche [37]. Both R. ferrireducens and G. sulfurreducens in silico models have an H+/2e- ratio of 2 for the NADH dehydrogenase
of the electron transfer chains. However, the H+/2e-ratio
for cytochrome reductase is 2 in R. ferrireducens as
opposed to 1 in G. sulfurreducens [22]. Such a difference
between the two models implies that the electron transfer
chain of R. ferrireducens is more efficient than that of G.
sulfurreducens. The evolution of electron transport chains
with different efficiencies suggests that microorganisms
could adapt to different lifestyles within the same community. Additional modeling studies on microbial community competition have shown that G. sulfurreducens is
better adapted to acetate-rich environments, whereas R.
ferrireducens thrives in nutrient-depleted environments (K.
Zhuang, personal communication). Understanding these
survival strategies is crucial for modeling complex microbial communities.
Central metabolism
R. ferrireducens possesses a full tricarboxylic acids (TCA)
cycle and pentose phosphate pathway. Oxaloacetate is
likely replenished by the combined action of PEP carboxylase (Rfer_1714) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase
(Rfer_0088). Genes coding for the enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle and a glyoxylate oxidase (Rfer_0480-81) are

present, which allow this organism to utilize glycolate as
the sole electron and carbon source (data not shown).
The versatility in donor utilization is reflected by the existence of several pathways and their associated enzymes by
which the key intermediate pyruvate can be produced.
These include the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway, Llactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome) [Rfer_2351, EC
1.1.2.3], and the pyruvate-oxidoreductase (POR) complex. Likewise, the genome provides multiple alternatives
for generating acetyl-CoA: pyruvate dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase/acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetate-CoA
ligase
and
acetate
kinase/phosphate
acetyltransferase. Notably, of these enzymes only the
pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetate kinase/phosphate
acetyltransferase are shared by G. sulfurreducens.
No fermentative growth with sugars was observed in R.
ferrireducens, which contrasts with other Rhodoferax species [2,10,11]. Fermentative growth on glucose was simulated with the in silico model and the result confirmed the
experimental observation. Detailed analysis of the metabolic network suggested that the lack of fermentative
growth of R. ferrireducens with glucose is likely due to its
inability to recycle reduced NADH generated from glycolysis for redox balance without an electron acceptor. Compared to the E. coli metabolic model, the R. ferrireducens
model lacks several reactions, including the reversible lactate dehydrogenase (LdhA), the pyruvate formate lyase
(PflA), and the acetaldehyde CoA dehydrogenase/alcohol
dehydrogenase (AdhE). These reactions are important to
the E. coli fermentative growth that produces acetate, ethanol, lactate, and formate to allow the balance of the
reducing equivalents generated during glycolysis [23].
Simulations with the R. ferrireducens model predicted that
introducing any one of these enzymes into R. ferrireducens
should support the fermentation of glucose (data not
shown).
R. ferrireducens differs from most other acetate-oxidizing
Fe(III) reducers in its ability to completely oxidize sugars
to carbon dioxide with electron transfer to Fe(III) and
electrodes [1]. The genome contains genes coding for the
Entner-Doudoroff glycolytic pathway, typical of Pseudomonads and Comamonas. Sugars are likely to be
imported into the bacterial cells by a homolog of a general
hexose phosphotransferase system (Rfer_0601-03). In
addition, several ABC transporters might be related to
sugar transport. For instance, Rfer_0952-55 have weak
similarity to ABC-type sugar transporters and are surrounded by genes related to carbohydrate metabolism
(see Additional file 2). A larger cluster comprising CDSs
Rfer_1094 to Rfer_1113 contains at least two putative
sugar ABC transporters as well as other genes involved in
sugar metabolism. R. ferrireducens is able to oxidize other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/447

sugars such as fructose, sucrose and mannose, but not lactose (not shown). The presence of two putative betaglucosidases in the genome (Rfer_1102 and Rfer_1111)
suggested that R. ferrireducens might also be able to metabolize cellobiose, a fact confirmed in subsequent growth
studies (see Additional file 3). Cellobiose degradation is
of biotechnological interest because of the potential of
turning common cellulosic waste products into energy.
The in silico R. ferrireducens model includes the pathway
for cellobiose degradation and predicts growth on this
substrate.
Fumarate dismutation
New experimental evidence indicates that R. ferrireducens
is able to grow with fumarate as the sole electron donor,
electron acceptor and carbon source (Figure 5). This type
of metabolism is known as fumarate dismutation and has
been previously described in Desulfovibrio sp. [24], and the
main products in R. ferrireducens are acetate and succinate.
The R. ferrireducens genome contains genes whose products account for this metabolism, including a fumarate
transporter DcuB (Rfer_3576) with 79% identity to the
characterized homolog from Wolinella succinogenes [25]
and a putative malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+) (malic enzyme) with 89% identity
to its homolog from P. aeruginosa (Rfer_0093). In fumarate dismutation simulations, fumarate is reduced to succinate accepting electrons from reducing equivalents that
are generated in: 1) from fumarate through malic enzyme
to acetyl-CoA, or 2) from fumarate to acetyl-CoA and the
complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA through the TCA cycle.
The first route is more efficient in generating ATP, but the
in silico model predicted that the second route is also
active in simulations constrained with experimental data,
probably due to the high activities of the TCA cycle
enzymes.
Citrate utilization
Citrate tested negative as an electron donor in the initial
description of Rhodoferax ferrireducens [2]. However, other
members of the Rhodoferax genus are able to utilize citrate
[10], and examination of the genome suggests that it
might be the case for R. ferrireducens as well. Rfer_2412
(CitT) is 44% identical to a putative citrate transporter
from E. coli CFT073 [26] and is located in a cluster of
genes also associated with citrate metabolism. Further
experimental evaluation confirmed that R. ferrireducens
could utilize citrate as electron donor and carbon source
with Fe(III) or nitrate as the electron acceptor (see Additional file 4). Even though other Betaproteobacteria can
also use citrate [27], BLAST-based analyses revealed that
these R. ferrireducens citrate-related proteins are more
closely related to Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria homologs (see Additional file 5). An exception is isocitrate dehydrogenase (Rfer_2411), for which there is a

lineage-specific gene duplication in the R. ferrireducens
genome (Rfer_2380, 97% identity) that resembles
homologs of the Betaproteobacteria. Rfer_3489, annotated
as a CitB, a citrate-utilization protein, might also be
involved in this metabolism.
The in silico model predicted that R. ferrireducens could
completely oxidize citrate with Fe(III) as electron acceptor
(Figure 6A, Pathway P5). However, this requires a very
high Fe(III) flux, 18-fold higher than that of citrate. When
culturing R. ferrireducens it was difficult to provide enough
Fe(III) for complete oxidation of the citrate added. Therefore, the experimental growth of R. ferrireducens was under
electron acceptor limiting conditions, which resulted in
incomplete oxidation of citrate and production of acetate
and succinate. The in silico model suggested four other
pathways of citrate oxidation that could also produce acetate and/or succinate under acceptor limiting conditions.
These pathways have different Fe(III):citrate stoichiometry and generate different amounts of ATP (Figure 6A,
Pathways P1-P4). Citrate lyase (CITL), a key enzyme in citrate utilization, is active in pathways P1 and P2. The
reversible malate dehydrogenase (MDH) can proceed in
both directions: reductive in pathways P1 and P2, and oxidative in pathway P5. Succinate dehydrogenase can act in
both directions, too: it is reductive in pathway P1 but oxidative in pathways P4 and P5. In order to figure out which

of these pathways are the most likely to be active in vivo,
citrate consumption was simulated in silico with data from
two independent growth experiments applied as constraints (Figure 6B). The model predicted that three pathways were active. When the Fe(III):citrate ratio was low, R.
ferrireducens utilized pathways P1, P2, and P3; which have
low requirement of Fe(III) availability. When more Fe(III)
was available, R. ferrireducens shifted towards pathway P4,
which uses electron acceptors with a higher efficiency and
more ATP is generated per citrate consumed (Figure 6B).
The integration of experimental data and computational
modeling in this case greatly improved our understanding
of citrate metabolism, and can be readily applied to
understanding other aspects of cellular physiology.
Degradation of aromatic compounds
The genome of R. ferrireducens harbors genes for benzoate
degradation that are likely to be active under both aerobic
and anaerobic conditions. Interestingly, unusual genes
and enzymes are involved in both cases. Recently, a novel
pathway for aerobic benzoate catabolism was characterized in Azoarcus evansii [28,29]. The unorthodox pathway
combines features from the classical aerobic and anaerobic pathways of aromatic catabolism. In addition to an
oxygen-dependent hydroxylation step similar to the aerobic route, it has the following features which are characteristic of the anaerobic pathways [30]; (1) the substrate is

activated by co-enzyme A (CoA) formation, (2) the intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, (3) ring cleavage is non-oxygenolytic, and (4) a -oxidation-like
reaction sequence is involved in the last steps of the pathway. In R. ferrireducens the genes of the new catabolic
route are clustered and their products are most similar to
orthologs from Polaromonas naphtalenivorans, one of the
closest relatives of R. ferrireducens (Figure 7). Interestingly,
R. ferrireducens also possesses genes coding for protocatechuate-4,5-dioxygenase (Rfer_0330, Rfer_0331), which
catalyzes the oxygen-dependent ring cleavage of protocatechuate, an intermediate in aerobic benzoate degradation pathway.

In the absence of oxygen, the first step in benzoate catabolism is the production of benzoyl-CoA. The fact that
there is only one gene for benzoate-CoA ligase in the R.
ferrireducens genome (Rfer_0216) suggests that benzoylCoA formation is catalyzed by the same enzyme under
both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as observed in the
denitrifying organism Thauera aromatica [31]. In facultative anaerobes, benzoyl-CoA is reductively dearomatized
by an ATP-dependent benzoyl-CoA reductase, but the
genes coding for this enzyme could not be found in the R.
ferrireducens genome. It has been recently postulated that
benzoyl-CoA reduction in obligate anaerobes like Geobacter metallireducens is mediated by a novel ATP-independent enzyme complex encoded by the genes bamB-I
[32,33]. The genome of R. ferrireducens contains several

genes whose products are moderately similar (based on
percent similarity at protein-level) to some bam genes of
G. metallireducens (see Additional file 6), but they do not
appear to form a cluster. The possibility of R. ferrireducens
having a novel system for benzoyl-CoA reduction cannot
be excluded. The full elucidation of these pathways warrants further study. The R. ferrireducens model contains a
pathway for benzoate degradation, and predicts the
growth of R. ferrireducens on benzoate with Fe(III) as an
electron acceptor.
The genome of R. ferrireducens also contains a putative
pathway for the anaerobic catabolism of phenylalanine
that includes a transaminase (Rfer_2174), a phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Rfer_0518) and phenylacetaldehyde
dehydrogenase (Rfer_0598). The end product of this
pathway, phenylacetate, could be converted into benzoylCoA by the successive action of putative phenylacetateCoA ligase (Rfer_3536) [34], phenylacetyl-CoA: acceptor
oxidoreductase (Rfer_3093, Rfer_3094) and phenylglyoxylate:acceptor oxidoreductase (Rfer_2184-87) [35].
The complete oxidation of benzoate requires an elevated
Fe(III):substrate ratio. This suggests that benzoate or other
aromatic compounds could be a good feedstock for R. ferrireducens based microbial fuel cells to generate electricity.
Thus, using aromatic waste stream for R. ferrireducens
based microbial fuel cells could be an attractive idea that
can achieve both bioremediation of aromatic compound
contaminants and generation of electricity.

Analysis of substrate efficiency
The ability to predict growth yields on various substrates
can be helpful for understanding the growth of microorganisms in various environments as well as for practical
applications. R. ferrireducens, growth on eight representative electron donors (acetate, glycolate, lactate, fumarate,
benzoate, citrate, glucose, and cellobiose) was simulated
under electron donor-limiting conditions with Fe(III) as
electron acceptor (Figure 8). Among the C6 compounds,
glucose was predicted to yield more biomass than equivalent molar concentrations of citrate or benzoate. The simulations with different complex electron donors will allow
a fast and easy analysis of substrate efficiency for bioremediation and electricity generation applications.
Photosynthesis and autotrophic growth
Although other members of the Rhodoferax genus are
capable of autotrophic growth [10,11], this is not the case
for R. ferrireducens [2]. No evidence of photosystems I or
II was found in the genome. However, incomplete pathways associated with CO2 fixation are present. For
instance, there is a gene coding for the large subunit of
Ribulose-1,5-Bisphosphate
Carboxylase/Oxygenase
(RuBisCO) (Rfer_1391), but not the small subunit. Some
genes encoding enzymes for the Calvin-Benson-Bassham
cycle are present as well, but genes for phosphoketolase
and seduheptulose-bisphosphatase are missing. The
reductive carboxylate cycle, present in many photosynthetic bacteria, is also incomplete as a gene for the key
enzyme ATP citrate synthase, is missing.

Analysis 8 substrate efficiency
Analysis of substrate efficiency. Eight representative electron donors (acetate, glycolate, lactate, fumarate, benzoate, citrate, glucose, and cellobiose) were used in simulations of R. ferrireducens growth under donor-limiting conditions with Fe(III) as
electron acceptor. The biomass yield to electron donor (gdw/mol substrate) and the Fe(III):substrate ratio from simulation
results of R. ferrireducens growth on acetate were set at 1. The biomass yields to other donors and the ratios of Fe(III) to other
electron donors are expressed in comparison to that of acetate.

Cytochrome content
Well-studied Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms such as
Shewanella and Geobacter species have abundant c-type
cytochromes that are essential for extracellular electron
transfer [36,37]. R. ferrireducens also has an abundance of
c-type cytochrome genes (see Additional file 7). Based on
matches to Prosite and hidden Markov Model (HMM)
profiles, the R. ferrireducens genome possess 69 putative ctype cytochromes, of which 45 have matched above the
high confidence scores to the Prosite profiles for the Cytochrome c family (PS51007) and multiheme cytochrome c
family profiles (PS51008). Of the R. ferrireducens putative
c-type cytochrome complement, approximately 45% (31/
69) possess a homolog to a c-type cytochrome indentified
in a previously sequenced [36]Geobacter spp. genome and
the majority appears to reside in the periplasm or outer
membrane based on the presence of predicted signal peptides. One c-type cytochrome gene in R. ferrireducens,
Rfer_0244, is a homolog of OmcE, an outer-membrane ctype cytochrome that is essential for Fe(III) oxide reduction in G. sulfurreducens [38]. However, there are no
homologs to several other cytochromes shown to be
important in G. sulfurreducens Fe(III) oxide reduction (and
electricity generation) including OmcB, OmcC, OmcF,
OmcS, OmcT and OmcZ [38-40]. These results suggest
that c-type cytochrome complements can vary in Fe(III)
oxide reducing (and electricity producing) prokaryotes.
However, whether or not a subset of c-type cytochromes
essential to Fe(III) oxide reduction (or electricity genera-

tion) exists within the set shared between Rhodoferax and
other Fe(III) oxide reducing prokaryotes remains to be
determined. This may not be surprising as there is poor
conservation of cytochromes even among Geobacter species (J. Butler, personal communication).
Nitrogen metabolism
The genome of R. ferrireducens contains a respiratory
nitrate reductase complex (Rfer_2792-95), and nitrate was
previously reported to serve as an electron acceptor supporting growth [2]. Further investigation revealed that
nitrate is reduced to nitrite (Figure 9A). Although genes
coding for nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases are
present (Rfer_1886 and Rfer_3199, respectively), R. ferrireducens is not a denitrifier, probably due to the absence
of a NO-forming nitrite reductase. Approximately 80% of
the nitrate was converted to nitrite (Figure 9B), thus failing the criteria that at least 80% of the nitrogen ought to
be recovered as gas for an organism to be considered a
denitrifier [41].

R. ferrireducens also contains assimilatory forms of nitrate
reductase (Rfer_2559) and nitrite reductase NAD(P)H
(Rfer_2557-2558) that allow growth on nitrate without
the addition of ammonia, although the growth rate was
higher in the ammonia-amended cultures (Figure 9A).
The R. ferrireducens model contains reactions that account
for nitrate utilization as electron acceptor and nitrogen

source. It predicts a 20% faster growth rate if ammonium
is added to the medium, in agreement with actual experimental results (Figure 9A and 9C). The model also accurately predicted the proportion of nitrate converted to
nitrite, ca. 80% (Figure 9B and 9D). The rest is likely converted to ammonium, of which 60% is predicted to be
assimilated into biomass, probably via glutamine synthetase.
Metalloid and metal resistance
The R. ferrireducens genome contains a cluster of genes
related to arsenic metabolism (see Additional file 8). The
gene cluster Rfer_3663-3665 encode respectively: a putative arsenite efflux pump; an arsenite-activated ATPase
and a arsenate reductase which are likely to be involved in
removing arsenic from the cell. However, tolerance to
arsenic has yet to be evaluated.

The genome contains two genes, Rfer_2447 and
Rfer_2824, which have 30% and 27% identity respectively
to the characterized chromate transporter homolog, ChrA,
in P. aeruginosa [42]. ChrB (Rfer_2446), on the other
hand, is 58% identical to the Cr(VI)-sensing regulator
ChrB in Ochrobactrum triciti, an Alphaproteobacteria isolated from chromium-contaminated sludge and able to
grow in the presence of high concentrations of chromium
[43-45]. A chromate reductase (ChrR) homolog was not
evident. The R. ferrireducens genome also encodes a heavy
metal efflux pump CzcA (Rfer_0411), which might confer
resistance to Cd, Zn and Co [46]. Other genes encoding
proteins involved in metal resistance are four putative
copper-translocating
P-type
ATPases
(Rfer_0024,
Rfer_0418, Rfer_1144 and Rfer_1927) and a periplasmic
copper-binding protein (Rfer_3200).

Storage capabilities: Polyhydroxyalkanoates
Many organisms have the ability to trigger the production
of carbon storage compounds under unfavorable conditions such as limited or inaccessible electron acceptors
and/or lack of key nutrients (e.g., nitrogen or sulfate) [47].
Some of these polymers have attractive physical properties
that make them relevant for industrial use, particularly in
biodegradable materials [12]. Genome analysis indentified three genes well characterized for their involvement
in PHA synthesis present in a putative operon in the R. ferrireducens
genome:
Acetoacetyl-CoA
reductase
(Rfer_2560), Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (Rfer_2561)
and PHA synthase (Rfer_2562). Even though production
of PHAs has been previously observed in R. ferrireducens
[2], the in silico model does not account for this pathway.
It is expected to be included once experimental data are
available.
Response to environmental challenges
R. ferrireducens is a psychrotolerant organism that can
withstand temperatures as low as 4°C, which might confer a competitive advantage in certain environments [2].
Notably, no genes coding for major cold shock proteins
(Csp) (as identified by matches above trusted cutoffs to
PF00313: cold-shock DNA-binding domain or
TIGR02381: cold shock domain protein CspD) could be
identified in the R. ferrireducens genome or other members of the Comamonadaceae whose genomes have been
sequenced (Polaromonas spp. and Acidovorax sp. JS42).
Other members of the Betaproteobacteria for which whole
genome sequence is available (from the genera Burkholderias, Azoarcus, Nitrobacter and Ralstonia) possess these Csp
homologs. This suggests that other cold shock proteins or
other mechanisms for surviving cold shock events have
yet to be identified in R. ferrireducens.

R. ferrireducens is a facultative organism and can utilize
atmospheric oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. The
genome contains a cytochrome c-oxidase and also several
genes coding for enzymes related to the oxidative stress
response, such as superoxide dismutase (Rfer_3151) and
several alkylhydroxyperoxidases (see Additional file 9).
Examination of the R. ferrireducens genome revealed that
this organism has potential to respond to a wide variety of
stimuli, with over 30 genes coding for putative sensor histidine kinases, 23 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins
(MCPs) and 32 DNA-binding response regulator elements. The genes coding for sensor proteins and response
regulators (possibly two-component systems) are often
found in pairs, and at least 47 such pairs were found in the
R. ferrireducens genome (see Additional file 10).
Homologs of CheA, CheW, CheV and CheY are also
present, though the chemotactic behavior of R. ferrireducens is largely unknown.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/447

R. ferrireducens is motile by means of one polar flagellum
[2]. Genes coding for flagellin-like proteins have been
identified (Rfer_0630 and Rfer_0631) that cluster with
genes coding for a flagellar hook-associated protein
(Rfer_0632) and for flagellin-specific chaperons FliS and
FliT [48]. At least 35 genes are directly (components of the
flagellar apparatus) or indirectly (specific chaperones, regulators) related to flagellar motility and are grouped in
two clusters in the genome.
CRISPR sequences and immunity to phage attack
A 5.7 kb array of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) was identified in the chromosome of R. ferrireducens, using the CRISPR Recognition
Tool [49]. It has been previously shown in a different bacterial system that new CRISPR spacer sequences derived
from phage genomic DNA are added after viral challenge
[50]. The presence of these sequences in the host genome
was shown to confer phage-resistance, in association with
the cas genes. Thus, the CRISPR locus in the chromosome
of R. ferrireducens may protect against phage attack. In
addition, there is a 1.5 kb CRISPR array in the plasmid,
encoding 24 spacer sequences of 32 bp. The CRISPRs in
the chromosome and plasmid are 37 bp and 32 bp respectively, and these two loci are associated with separate sets
of cas genes. Thus, the plasmid-encoded CRISPR appears
independent of the chromosome-encoded CRISPR.
Spacer sequences in both loci have no significant matches
to entries in the NCBI databases (except to themselves).
The results suggest that a significant cache of horizontally
transferrable genetic elements which the R. ferrireducens
chromosome and plasmid have encountered previously
have yet to be sequenced and identified. Alternatively, if
the horizontal acquisition of these elements occurred a
long time ago in terms of R. ferrireducens evolution and
selective pressure to maintain the original sequence is
low, these spacer regions may have been ameliorated to
such a degree that homology to the original sequence is
no longer detectable.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates how genome-scale metabolic
modeling, coupled with enhanced genome annotation
and laboratory studies, can accelerate the study of the
physiology of environmentally relevant, but understudied
microorganisms. In relatively short order the understanding of metabolism of R. ferrireducens has advanced from a
description of growth characteristics [1,2] to a detailed
understanding of metabolism (Figure 10) and the ability
to predict the growth and metabolism of R. ferrireducens
under a diversity of environmental conditions. The
genome-scale metabolic model of R. ferrireducens is
expected to be a useful tool for studying the role of this
microorganism in soils and sediments and its interactions
with other microorganisms, such as Geobacter species, that

share some physiological characteristics. Furthermore, the
genome-scale metabolic model of R. ferrireducens is likely
to be a powerful tool for optimizing potential applications of R. ferrireducens such as the bioremediation of contaminants, the production of polymers, and the
conversion of organic compounds to electricity.

Methods
Bacterial strains and culturing conditions
Rhodoferax ferrireducens strain DMS 15236 (ATCC BAA621) [2] was obtained from our laboratory collection. A
defined freshwater medium was used to culture and propagate this bacterium [51]. Electron donors were added as
follows: acetate 10 mM, lactate 0.1%, glycolate 10 mM,
citrate 10 mM, glucose 0.1%, mannose 0.1%, sucrose
0.1%, cellobiose 0.1%. Electron acceptors were added as

follows: fumarate 30 mM, ferric citrate 56 mM, Fe(III)NTA
5 mM, nitrate 20 mM.
Determination of growth yields
Rhodoferax ferrireducens cells were collected at stationary
phase, centrifuged at 4000 RPM for 15 minutes at 4°C
and washed with isotonic buffer [52]. Any remaining liquid was carefully removed with a pipette and the pellets
were flash-frozen for storage at -80°C. Cell pellets were
subsequently resuspended in 5% SDS and boiled for 10
minutes. Protein concentrations were determined with
the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method using bovine serum
albumin as standard [53]. Dry weight was calculated
assuming that protein accounts for 55% of the cell mass
according to the biomass equation derived from E. coli
model [21]. Biomass yield from published acetate and

Fe(III) data [2] was calculated using the value from E. coli
(10-12 g/cell).
Analytical techniques
Growth of fumarate cultures was assessed by measuring
optical density at 600 nm with a Genesys 2 spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY). The
organic acid content of the culture medium was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)
using an LC-10AT high-pressure liquid chromatograph
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Aminex
HPX-87H column (300 by 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Organic acids were eluted in 8 mM H2SO4 and quantitated with an SPD-10VP UV detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) set at 215 nm. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations
were determined with a Dionex DX-100 ion chromatograph. Fe(II) concentrations were determined with the ferrozine assay as previously described [54].
Annotation and comparative genomic analyses
The R. ferrireducens genome was originally sequenced and
annotated at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) http:/
/www.jgi.doe.gov/ and assigned GenBank accession
number CP000267 and CP000268 for the chromosome
and plasmid, respectively. In order to enhance our ability
to perform comparative genomic analyses and to generate
a more accurate in silico constraints based model, further
manual curation of the original genome assembly (chromosome and plasmid) was completed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) as indicated in the following
description. Results of the manual curation (as well as the
original annotation from the JGI) are available at the
Comprehensive Microbial Resource http://www.jcvi.org/
cms/research/projects/cmr maintained by the JCVI. An
initial set of CDSs that likely encode proteins was identified using GLIMMER 3 and those shorter than 90 base
pairs (bp) as well as some of those with overlaps eliminated. There are 4451 CDSs that have been predicted on
the main chromosome and 319 on the plasmid for a total
of 4770 CDSs in the genome. 4333 CDSs from the JCVI
annotation mapped to JGI annotation in GenBank. For
clarity and ease of access to data, locus tags as assigned by
GenBank are used to indicate CDSs referred to specifically
in the work presented here unless otherwise indicated. For
clarity and ease of access to data, locus tags as assigned by
GenBank are used to indicate CDSs referred to specifically
in the work presented here unless otherwise indicated.

CDSs were searched against a non-redundant protein
database as previously described [55]. Frameshifts and
point mutations were detected and corrected where
appropriate. Remaining frameshifts and point mutations
are considered authentic and corresponding regions were
annotated as 'authentic frameshift' or 'authentic point
mutation', respectively. The CDS prediction and gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/447

family identifications were completed as follows. Two sets
of HMMs were used to determine CDS membership in
families and superfamilies. These included 721 HMMs
from Pfam v22.0 and 631 HMMs from the TIGR ortholog
resource. TMHMM [109] was used to identify membranespanning domains (MSD) in proteins. Manual annotation, included adjustment of start sites, gene names and
assignment to putative functional role categories.
Criteria for the identification of cytochrome genes used
the Perl script "ps_scan.pl" and 3 Prosite profiles:
PS51007 cytochrome c family profile, PS51008 multiheme cytochrome c family profile, and PS51009 cytochrome c class II profile. A gene scoring a low confidence
cutoff (level = -1) was qualified as "putative" compared to
a gene scoring above the reliable cutoff (level = 0). Additional HMM evidence and matches to a database of experimentally characterized genes maintained in house
sometimes provided greater specificity to the corresponding gene name.
All predicted proteins from the R. ferrireducens genome
were compared using bidirectional BLASTP to those from
all other completed Proteobacterial genomes. Significant
BLAST matches were scored for each CDS using cutoffs of
10-5 for the P value, and 70% for the length of the alignment compared to both query and database proteins.
CDSs with a top match to another R. ferrireducens protein
rather than to a protein in another species were considered candidates for which recent lineage-specific duplication events have occurred.
Metabolic network reconstruction
The R. ferrireducens metabolic network was reconstructed
in SimPheny (Genomatica, Inc., CA) by modifying previously published procedures [56]. The annotated genes of
the R. ferrireducens genome as well as genes from several
high-quality genome-scale metabolic models, including
previously published Escherichia coli [56], Geobacter sulfurreducens [22], and Bacillus subtilis [57] models, were utilized for BLASTP sequence similarity search to generate a
draft network as a starting point for model reconstruction.
Among the base models used, E. coli was the phylogenetically closest to R. ferrireducens and provided about half of
all reactions in the draft model, which captured significant portions of central metabolism, biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids. The
reactions and their gene associations in the draft model of
R. ferrireducens were evaluated manually based on gene
annotations, published biochemical and physiological
information, and external references as previously
described [58] The remaining genes were also reviewed for
inclusion in the reconstructed network. During this process, reactions and pathways not in the base models were
identified, validated, and added into the R. ferrireducens

Page 15 of 19

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:447

model. A biomass demand reaction based on biomass
compositions of the published E. coli model [56] was used
in the R. ferrireducens model (See Additional file 1 for
details). Exchange reactions for all extracellular compounds were added. The resulting reconstructed network
was then subjected to the gap filling process where gaps
were identified and filled manually through simulations
to allow biomass formation under physiological growth
conditions that include growth with Fe(III)-NTA, nitrate
and oxygen as electron acceptors and acetate, propionate,
lactate, pyruvate, malate, succinate, benzoate and glucose
as electron donors [1,2].
Estimation of energy parameters of the metabolic model
Energy parameters of the metabolic model including
GAM, NGAM and proton translocation stoichiometry
were estimated as follows. The GAM requirement for the
R. ferrireducens model was assumed to be the same as the
E. coli model at 59.81 mmol ATP/gdw h [21] based on
their similar biomass compositions. The NGAM requirement and the proton translocation stoichiometry (H+/2e, number of protons per pair of electrons) for NADH
dehydrogenase and cytochrome reductase were estimated
by iterating for optimization between in silico-predicted
and experimentally determined growth yields. Observed
experimental growth rates were all less than 0.04 h-1, so all
in silico simulations were constrained with a growth rate
less than 0.04 h-1. The experimental data used to determine the energetic parameters were obtained from three
independent experiments where R. ferrireducens was cultivated in batch under the following conditions: a) acetate
and fumarate, b) citrate and Fe(III), and c) acetate and
Fe(III) [2].
In silico analysis of metabolism
The metabolic capabilities of the R. ferrireducens network
were calculated using flux balance analysis and linear
optimization [56] in SimPheny. Biomass synthesis was
selected as the objective function to be maximized in
growth simulations, and ATP consumption was selected
as the objective function to be maximized in energy
requirement simulations. The simulations resulted in flux
values in units of mmol/gdw h. The following external
metabolites were allowed to freely enter and leave the network for simulations of anaerobic growth on minimal
media: CO2, H+, H2O, K+, Mg2+, NH4+, phosphate, and
sulfate. A minimal amount of oxygen was allowed for biomass component requirements. The electron donors or
acceptors tested were allowed a maximum uptake rate
into the network of 5 mmol/gdw h or as specified in the
results. All other external metabolites were only allowed
to leave the system.
