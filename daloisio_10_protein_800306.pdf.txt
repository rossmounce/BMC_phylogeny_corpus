Abstract
Background: The Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) gene family encodes several PDI and PDI-like proteins containing
thioredoxin domains and controlling diversified metabolic functions, including disulfide bond formation and
isomerisation during protein folding. Genomic, cDNA and promoter sequences of the three homoeologous wheat
genes encoding the "typical" PDI had been cloned and characterized in a previous work. The purpose of present
research was the cloning and characterization of the complete set of genes encoding PDI and PDI like proteins in bread
wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring) and the comparison of their sequence, structure and expression with
homologous genes from other plant species.
Results: Eight new non-homoeologous wheat genes were cloned and characterized. The nine PDI and PDI-like
sequences of wheat were located in chromosome regions syntenic to those in rice and assigned to eight plant
phylogenetic groups. The nine wheat genes differed in their sequences, genomic organization as well as in the domain
composition and architecture of their deduced proteins; conversely each of them showed high structural conservation
with genes from other plant species in the same phylogenetic group. The extensive quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the
nine genes in a set of 23 wheat samples, including tissues and developmental stages, showed their constitutive, even
though highly variable expression.
Conclusions: The nine wheat genes showed high diversity, while the members of each phylogenetic group were
highly conserved even between taxonomically distant plant species like the moss Physcomitrella patens. Although
constitutively expressed the nine wheat genes were characterized by different expression profiles reflecting their
different genomic organization, protein domain architecture and probably promoter sequences; the high conservation
among species indicated the ancient origin and diversification of the still evolving gene family. The comprehensive
structural and expression characterization of the complete set of PDI and PDI-like wheat genes represents a basis for
the functional characterization of this gene family in the hexaploid context of bread wheat.
Background
Thousands of secretory proteins are distributed into the
different compartments of the endomembrane system
after their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
where resident proteins assist their folding and assembly
and monitor their correct three-dimensional conformation, sorting for disposal those that fail to fold or to
assemble properly [1,2]. Disulfide bonds cross-linking
specific cysteines are formed during the maturation of
secretory proteins to stabilize them and to join covalently
multiple subunits; mispairing of cysteine residues can

lead to misfolding [3]. Lines of evidence support the catalytic role of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and PDIrelated proteins of the thioredoxin (TRX) superfamily in
the correct formation of disulfide bonds in nascent polypeptides. The TRX proteins are characterized by the
presence of one or more "TRX-like" domains showing
sequence or structural similarity to the thioredoxin active
site [4].
The classical or typical PDI (EC 5.3.4.1) is one of the
most abundant proteins in the ER; it is a homodimer
formed by two subunits of about 57 kDa, whose structure
and function have been extensively studied in mammalian species, particularly in humans [reviewed in [5]]. It
catalyzes thiol-disulfide oxidation, reduction and isomerisation, this latter occurring directly by intramolecular

disulfide rearrangement or through cycles of reduction
and oxidation [6]. The ability of PDI to bind to unfolded
or partially folded proteins preventing their aggregation
has also suggested its role as a chaperone [7], involved in
the quality control system checking the correct folding of
the proteins synthesized in the ER [8,9]. Two additional
features as subunit of complex enzymatic systems have
been demonstrated in mammal PDI is the β-subunit of
prolyl 4-hydroxylase [10] and it is a component of the
triglyceride transfer complex [11]. Human PDI has a
modular structure including four TRX-like domains (a, b,
b' and a'), a linker (x) and a C-terminal extension domain
(c) [for reviews see [12,13]]. The a and a' domains are
homologous to thioredoxin and contain a catalytic site for
isomerase and redox activities consisting of the Cys-GlyHis-Cys amino acid sequence [14], whereas the middle b
and b' retain only similarities to the TRX domain within
their secondary structure [15]. The c domain at the C terminal region, is rich of acidic residues typical of calcium
binding proteins [16] and ends with a KDEL sequence for
ER retention [17].
The typical PDI is the most prominent member of a
family of related PDI-like proteins characterised by the
presence of one to three thioredoxin-like active domains
[5]. Several genes encoding PDI-like proteins with
unusual primary structure, different expression pattern
and exhibiting a wide range of activities have been identified in every extensively sequenced mammalian genome
[5,8,18,19]. Even though all proteins of the PDI family
have been located within the ER, where they perform
their function, Turano et al. [8] have located some of
them in different subcellular locations, but their export
mechanism is still unknown.
In higher plants, 13 genes have been identified in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and 12 in rice (Oryza
sativa) and in maize (Zea mays) [20]. Phylogenetic analyses of their protein sequences have shown that the plant
PDI family would include at least eight different subfamilies. The proteins of the first five groups or subfamilies (IV) have two thioredoxin-like active domains and show
structural similarity to other PDI-like proteins of higher
eukaryotes, whereas the proteins of the remaining three
subfamilies (VI-VIII) contain a single thioredoxin-like
active domain. The first group (I) includes the typical
PDI, which has been cloned and sequenced in several
plant species.
In cereals most studies on molecular characterization,
transcriptional regulation and intracellular localization of
genes and proteins of the PDI family have concerned the
typical PDI [21,22], which may accomplish an important
role in the folding of plant secretory proteins, particularly
during the formation of endosperm protein bodies. The
importance of PDI in the storage protein deposition in
cereals is also supported by the analysis of some maize

and rice mutants, which form seeds with altered
endosperm protein bodies [23,24]; the lack of PDI expression caused failure in the correct formation of protein
bodies, suggesting its essential and direct role in their formation.
Genes coding for novel PDI family proteins of groups I,
II, III, IV and V have been cloned in soybean [25-28]; they
are ubiquitously expressed and their encoded proteins
located in the ER. The proteins encoded by genes of the
groups I, II, IV and V contain two standard -CGHC- catalytic sites and have thiol oxidoreductase activity in vitro.
They seem to be involved in the folding of storage proteins in cotyledons, such as the proglycinin, a precursor
of the seed storage protein glycinin, and the β-conglycinin; both acting as thiol-oxidoreductase and as a molecular chaperone. The proteins encoded by the genes of the
III group contain non standard -CXXS/C redox active
sites and do not exhibit oxidoreductases or molecular
chaperone activities in vitro, consequently they may be
involved in the maturation of seed cotyledons through
molecular mechanisms differing from the other PDI family members.
PDI-like proteins would also be involved in signal
transduction pathways through their association with
transcriptional complexes regulating genes responding to
various stimuli. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the PDIlike protein RB60 is involved in the maintenance of photosynthetic capacity as part of a redox regulatory protein
complex controlling translation in the chloroplast [29];
RB60 resides also in the ER, wherein its function is
unknown [30].
The involvement of the typical PDI and probably of
additional PDI-like proteins in the folding of endosperm
storage proteins is especially important in wheat, wherein
the processes occurring during protein synthesis and
deposition may affect the functional properties of gluten.
Wheat storage proteins consist primarily of prolamins
synthesised in the developing endosperm and targeted to
the ER lumen, where they are folded and connected by
intermolecular disulfide bonds to form large aggregates
[31]. The storage proteins play an integral role in determining the visco-elastic properties of wheat dough, with
larger polymers being related to increased elasticity, a
feature of high quality wheat [32]. Therefore, the genes
encoding storage proteins, as well as factors that may
affect their deposition, such as molecular chaperones and
foldase enzymes, are of particular interest to wheat
industry. Even though wheat storage proteins have been
the object of a wide range of studies both at chemical and
genetic levels [reviewed in [31,32]], the knowledge of factors affecting their folding and deposition is still
extremely limited.
Considering potential applications to the improvement
of flour quality, we have undertaken a research pro-

gramme on the molecular characterization of the PDI
gene family in wheat. The three homoeologous genes
coding for the typical PDI and their promoter sequences
had previously been isolated and characterized in common wheat [33]. Their exon/intron structure, whose
sequences have been located in chromosome arms 4AL,
4BS and 4DS of hexaploid wheat [34], is highly conserved
and includes 10 exons. Expression analysis has shown
that transcripts of the typical PDI, though constitutively
present at a low level in all the analyzed tissues, are particularly abundant in the developing caryopses [33,35].
The detection, within the upstream putative promoter
region, of several cis-acting elements involved in
endosperm specific expression is consistent with the
higher PDI transcript expression detected in kernels. In
this paper we report the isolation and characterization of
the complete set of PDI related gene sequences of wheat,
which, in addition to the typical PDI, include eight new
non-homoeologous genes coding for PDI-like proteins.
Moreover, the paper reports their assignment to the eight
phylogenetic groups of the plant PDI family, their chromosome location, the organization of their genomic
sequences and their expression profiles in a set of 23 samples, including different tissues and developmental
stages.

Methods
Plant material

The following tissue samples were collected (JanuaryJune 2008) from 20 bread wheat plants (Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring) grown in open field at Viterbo
(Italy), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 80°C until use for RNA isolation: 1) roots from plants
with single shoot and three leaves unfolded (Feekes scale
1.3); 2) the above-ground portion from the same plants;
3) shoots at the beginning of tillering (Feekes scale 2.0); 4)
shoots from plants with formed tillers (Feekes scale 3); 5)
shoots at the beginning of erect growth (Feekes scale 4);
6) stems at booting stage (Feekes scale 10); 7) flag leaves
at booting stage (Feekes scale 10); 8) spikes collected at
intervals of 10 to12 days (three developmental stages: 1520 mm, flag leaf unfolding and heading stage); 9) single
floral organs (glumes, palea, lemma, lodicules, stamens
and pistil) from fully emerged spikes (Feekes scale 10.5);
10) developing caryopses from 5 to 38 days after anthesis
(DAA) at 5 to 6 days intervals (7 samplings).
DNA and RNA isolation

DNA was isolated from 5 g of leaves collected from single
plants of Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring (CS) and
its nulli-tetrasomic (NT) lines as reported in [34]. Total
RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer's instructions, whereas from
caryopses it was isolated by a LiCl based method [35].

RNA concentration and quality integrity were checked as
described in [36].
Identification and amplification of full length wheat PDIlike cDNAs

The available sequences of PDI-like genes of rice (12
sequences) and Arabidopsis (13 sequences) [20] were
exploited to BLAST search three public databases of
wheat ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags): DFCI wheat gene
index database (TaGI, version 11), HarvEST wheat (version 1.13) and NCBI. BLAST searches identified eight
novel non-redundant PDI-like consensus sequences,
which were used as templates for 5' and 3' RACE (Rapid
Amplification of cDNA Ends) extensions using the 5'/3'
RACE kit from ROCHE following manufacturer's
instructions. RACE products were amplified (sequences
of RACE primers are available upon request) using 2 μg
of a pool of total RNA from different CS tissues (see Plant
material). The 5' and 3' RACE products were cloned and
validated by sequence analysis; the corresponding fulllength cDNAs of eight novel wheat PDI-like genes were
cloned by RT-PCR using total RNA from different tissues
of CS and specific primers designed on the basis of the 5'
and 3' untranslated regions (see Additional file 1). Firststrand cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of RNA by the
Expand™ Reverse Transcriptase (ROCHE) and the PCR
reactions were performed using 2 μl of the RT reaction
with the GC-Rich PCR System from ROCHE following
manufacturer's instructions.
Isolation of genomic sequences

The genomic sequences of the eight novel PDI-like genes
of wheat were amplified using two different methods.
Amplicons up to 5 kb were amplified using the GC-Rich
PCR System from ROCHE, with the following modification to the method used for cDNA synthesis: 400 ng of
genomic DNA as template; for the first 10 cycles elongation of 5 to 8 minutes (depending on template size) at
66°C temperature, then increase of 5 s for each successive
cycle; final elongation at 66°C for 7 minutes. PCR of the
amplicons exceeding 5 kb was performed by the Expand
Long Template PCR System (ROCHE) as directed in the
package insert, using the supplied buffer 3 and 400 ng of
genomic DNA. DNA was denatured at 94°C for 2 min,
then amplified by 10 cycles each at 94°C for 30 s, 58 to
65°C (depending on the primer) for 30 s and 68°C for up
to 15 min, followed by additional 25 cycles, identical to
the previous 10 except the elongation time was further
extended by additional 20 s for each successive cycle, then
a final elongation step at 68°C for 15 min was performed.
Genomic sequences were amplified using the same combination of primer pairs employed for the cloning of the
full-length cDNAs (Additional file 1).

Cloning and sequencing of RACE, cDNA and genomic DNA
amplification products

Amplification products of RACE, full-length cDNAs and
genomic sequences were visualized on 1.2% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products of
expected size were excised from the gel, purified using
the High Pure Purification kit (ROCHE) according to
manufacturer's instructions, and cloned into the pGEMT easy plasmid vector (PROMEGA). Two independent
PCR amplifications were performed for each cDNA,
genomic and RACE amplicon, their products were cloned
and for each reaction multiple clones were sequenced (6
cDNA, 2 genomic and 10 RACE clones). Plasmid DNA
for sequencing reaction was prepared from 3 ml overnight cultures using a plasmid mini-prep kit (QIAGEN).
Sequencing was performed on both strands by the ABI
PRISM 377 capillary sequencer (PE Applied Biosystem)
using an ABI Prism Dye Terminator sequencing kit (PE
Applied Biosystem) and either vector or sequence specific primers. The complete sequences of the genomic
clones were obtained by sequencing them with internal
primers complementary to the cDNA sequences and
designed near the predicted exon/intron junctions so to
amplify each exon and nearby intron on both strands
(primers are available upon request). All sequences were
analyzed by DNAMAN Sequence Analysis Software
(Version 3, Lynnon Biosoft) and their homologies were
scored using the BLASTX program [37] through the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
GeneBank database [38]. The software developed by Hesbsgaard et al. [39] was used for the prediction of intron
splice sites within the genomic sequences. Full-length
cDNA and genomic sequences were deposited in the
DDBJ/EMBL/GeneBank nucleotide sequence databases,
accession numbers are indicated in Additional file 2. A
code of two letters (Ta = Triticum aestivum) followed by
the suffix PDIL and by an Arabic number indicating the
corresponding phylogenetic group was assigned to each
sequence. Multiple sequences clustering into the same
subfamily were designed by an additional number (1-2).
The predicted protein sequences were analysed by
searching for conserved motifs in CDD [40], Pfam
HMMs [41], InterPro [42] and SMART [43] databases;
their subcellular locations were predicted by Target P1.1
[44] and ChloroP 1.1 [45], the presence of the signal peptide was confirmed by Signal P3.0 [46] and the transmembrane regions were determined by TMHMM ver 2.0
[47]. Protein identity was determined using the "two
sequence alignment" option of DNAMAN software (Lynnon BioSoft, Canada) with the following settings: gap
open penalty 8 and gap extension penalty 2 and BLOSUM
protein weight matrix.

Phylogenetic analysis

In addition to the eight novel wheat PDI-like sequences
cloned in this study and the typical PDI isolated previously [33], 100 PDI and PDI-like sequences from Arabidopsis, rice, maize, soybean (Glycine max), grapevine
(Vitis vinifera), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), Physcomitrella patens and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were
retrieved from published [20,25-28] and deposited
[38,48-51] sequences. The nomenclature of PDI-like
sequences of different plant species and of the moss P.
patens was identical to that adopted for wheat (see Additional file 3). The full nomenclature included two letters
for genus and species, followed by PDIL and by an Arabic
number indicating the corresponding phylogenetic
group; multiple sequences clustering into the same subfamily were designed by an additional number (1-3). The
original nomenclature of the deposited sequences was
adopted only for C. reinhardtii. Deduced amino acid
sequences of the whole coding regions were aligned by
ClustalX version 1.83 [52] using the Gonnet series as protein weight matrix and parameters set to 3 gap open penalty, 1.6 gap extension penalty, negative matrix on and
divergent sequences delay at 36%. The phylogenetic tree
was constructed using the neighbour-joining (NJ)
method [53], as provided by the program NEIGHBOR of
the PHYLIP package version 3.6. For tree reconstructions, distance matrices were estimated by the PHYLIP
program PRODIST using the PAM model of amino acid
transition. To evaluate statistical significance of the phylogenetic trees 1,000 bootstrap replicates were generated
from each data set using the PHYLIP program SEQBOOT.
Chromosome location

For Southern analysis genomic DNA (10 μg) from CS and
its NT lines was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII,
SphI, SacI and DraI, electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels,
transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane
(ROCHE) and hybridised with digoxigenin-labelled
probes using the PCR-DIG Probe Synthesis Kit
(ROCHE). The eight primer pairs used for probe labelling
by PCR are reported in Additional file 4. Pre-hybridisation, hybridisation, washing and immunological detection were performed as reported in [34].
The hybridisation pattern of TaPDIL2-1 was complex,
thus the chromosome locations of its homoeologous
sequences were determined by PCR analysis with a
primer pair (5'-CGTCAAAGTTGTTGTTGGCAA-3'
and 5'-CCTACAACTCGTCCTTGGG-3') flanking a
region spanning the last 3 introns of TaPDIL2-1. PCR
reactions were performed with GoTaq DNA Polymerase
(PROMEGA) following manufacturer's instructions and
using 50 ng of genomic DNA from CS and its NT lines.
Amplification products were analysed on a 2% agarose gel

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101

run at 40 V overnight and verified through sequence
analysis.
Expression analysis

The expression patterns of nine non-homoeologous
genes coding for wheat PDI and PDI-like proteins were
analysed by quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in
a set of 23 samples which included different tissues and
developmental stages, as specified in Plant material.
Quantitative RT-PCR analyses and data normalization
were performed according to Paolacci et al. [36] and
described in detail in the Additional file 5. Two biological
replicates, resulting from two different RNA extractions,
RT and qRT-PCR reactions, were used in quantification
analysis; three technical replicates were analysed for each
biological replicate.
The relative and absolute expression levels of the nine
genes were computed considering four data sets,
obtained by the different groupings of the analysed samples: 1) twelve samples relative to different tissues and
developmental stages (roots, shoots, stems, leaves, spikes
and caryopses at different developmental stages); 2) ten
samples including the above data set except caryopses; 3)
six samples represented by single floral organs from fully
emerged spikes; 4) seven samples relative to developing
caryopses collected between 5 and 38 DPA.

Results and Discussion
Cloning and characterization of PDI-like genes in wheat

The identification of cDNA sequences of wheat PDI-like
genes was based on the BLAST search of the DFCI
Wheat Gene Index (TaGI, version 11) [54] using the available PDI-like gene sequences of rice (Oryza sativa, 12
sequences) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana, 13
sequences) [20]. The TaGI search by BLAST fetched nine
distinct contigs (tentative consensus sequences), one of
them (TC310491) encoded the typical PDI, whose three
homoeologous genes had previously been cloned and
characterised [33]. An additional search in HarvEST
wheat, version 1.13 [55] and in all NCBI cDNA libraries
of wheat detected several ESTs (Expressed Sequence
Tags) homologous to rice and Arabidopsis PDI-like
genes; ninety sequences were randomly selected among
those exceeding 350 bp and were cloned by RT-PCR
using an RNA mixture from different bread wheat cv CS
tissues as template. On the basis of their homology the 90
cDNAs formed nine groups, corresponding to the tentative consensus (TC) sequences assembled from the ESTs
detected in the TaGI database. The eight TC sequences
(Table 1) corresponding to new wheat PDI-like genes
were used as template to isolate by RACE the corresponding 5' and 3' extensions, subsequently validated by
sequence analysis. Full-length cDNAs of the eight PDIlike genes (Table 1) were cloned by RT-PCR of RNA from

Page 5 of 29

various wheat tissues using specific primer pairs designed
in the 5' and 3' UTRs (untranslated regions) (see Additional file 1). Two independent RT-PCR reactions were
performed for each sequence; both amplified products
had the same electrophoretic mobility and for each of
them 3 clones were sequenced. For each of three full
length PDI-like cDNAs (TaPDIL2-1, TaPDIL3-1 and
TaPDIL8-1) all the six clones (3 clones × 2 RT-PCR reactions) exhibited identical sequences, whereas two slightly
different sequences were recognized among the six
clones analysed for each of four cDNA sequences
(TaPDIL4-1, TaPDIL5-1, TaPDIL6-1, TaPDIL7-2) and
three among the six clones of the remaining cDNA
(TaPDIL7-1). The different clones obtained by RT-PCR
using the same primer pair were identified by an additional letter (a, b and c) (Table 1). The deduced amino
acid sequences of the 14 cloned cDNAs shared over 70%
identity with those of the corresponding orthologous
PDI-like genes of rice, whose nucleotide sequences had
been used for the identification of the wheat ESTs (Table
1). Multiple cDNAs cloned from independent amplifications with the same primer pair showed high identity
(over 96%) of both nucleotide and amino acid sequences
(Table 2), most probably because they derived from transcripts of multiple copies of PDI-like genes located in
homoeologous chromosomes of hexaploid wheat
(AABBDD genome). Mutations detected in the coding
region of the putative homoeologous cDNA sequences
consisted mainly of nucleotide substitutions, most of
them synonymous (Table 2). The most remarkable differences between putative homoeologous sequences consisted of three short in-frame insertion/deletion (indel),
one of six nucleotides in the N-terminal region of
TaPDIL6-1a and TaPDIL6-1b and two of three and nine
nucleotides in the N-terminal region of TaPDIL7-1a,
TaPDIL7-1b and TaPDIL7-1c (Table 2). The 5' and 3'
UTRs showed slightly higher rates of base substitutions
and of indels of variable length (data not shown). These
data indicate that the negligible differences observed
between the deduced amino acid sequences of the wheat
putative homoeologous PDI-like genes would not justify
their functional diversification.
Phylogenetic analysis

The evolutionary relationships between the PDI and PDIlike genes of wheat and of other plants were studied by
phylogeny reconstruction based on the alignment of 89
amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide
sequences of nine genes of wheat, 13 of Arabidopsis, 12 of
poplar, 10 of grapevine, 21 of soybean and 12 each of
maize and rice. Since the complete genome sequences of
Arabidopsis, poplar, grapevine, soybean and rice were
available, the dataset used to construct the phylogenetic
trees provided the highest confidence of having a repre-

sentative sample of genes belonging to all the groups of
the angiosperm PDI gene family. Moreover, the search in
their complete genome sequences retrieved 14 PDI and
PDI-like gene sequences in the moss P. patens and six
genes in the green alga C. reinhardtii [48,49]. Since C.
reinhardtii belongs to the clorophytes, which diverged
from the streptophytes (including bryophytes, pteridophytes and angiosperms) over a billion years ago [56], and
P. patens belongs to the bryophytes, which diverged from
the angiosperms about 450 million years ago [57], the
inclusion of the sequences from these two species in the
phylogenetic analyses allowed to reconstruct a more
ancient evolutionary changes in this gene family.

Four different phylogenetic trees were computed using
amino acid sequences of: 1) the whole set of 109 PDI and
PDI-like genes of nine species; 2) a set including all the
sequences except CrDNJ of C. reinhardtii; 3) 103 genes
from seven angiosperm species and from P. patens; 4) 89
genes from the seven angiosperms. The topology of the
four trees was very similar, although the bootstrap values
of those obtained with the data sets 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those based on the data sets 1 and 4
(data not shown). The phylogenetic tree shown in Figure
1 was obtained by the alignment including the sequences
of the seven angiosperm species and of P. patens (data set
3); the nine non-homoeologous PDI and PDI-like
sequences of wheat were included into the eight phyloge-

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree showing the relationships between the deduced amino acid sequences of PDI and PDI-like genes of different
plant species. The multiple alignment of nine sequences of wheat, 13 of A. thaliana (At), 12 of P. trichocarpa (Pt), 10 of V. vinifera (Vv), 21 of G. max (Gm),
12 each of Z. mais (Zm) and O. sativa (Os) and 14 of P. patens (Pp) was performed by ClustalX 1.83 software and the phylogenetic tree was constructed
by the neighbour-joining (NJ) method and evaluated by bootstrap analysis (PHYLIP version 3.6). The numbers on the main branches indicate bootstrap percentages for 1,000 replicates. The PDI-like sequences of groups VI and VIII were used as outgroups, due to their high diversification from the
other subfamilies. The two major clades (I and II) and the eight phylogenetic groups (I-VIII) indentified in the plant PDI family are highlighted with red
and green brackets, respectively.

netic groups (subfamilies) identified in plants, indicating
that at least one wheat gene was cloned for each phylogenetic group. Six of the eight subfamilies could be grouped
into two major clades, on the basis of the modular structure of the proteins, whereas the subfamilies VI and VIII
had highly diversified proteins and thus were considered
as outgroups. The first major clade (clade I in Figure 1)
included the I (typical PDIs), II and III phylogenetic
groups, whose genes encode proteins containing two thioredoxin active domains, located at the N- and C-terminal ends, as well as the VII group, whose members retain
only the single N-terminal active domain. For the groups
I, II and III the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin through duplications of a single ancestral gene can be
put forward on the basis of their shared structural features, these duplication events would have occurred in
the common progenitor of land plants (streptophytes).
The close phylogenetic affinity between the genes of subfamily VII, encoding proteins with a single thioredoxin
active domain, and those of the subfamilies I, II and III is
consistent with the hypothesis that the group VII proteins
would have emerged by loss of one of the two thioredoxin
active domains of a precursor gene. The second major
clade (clade II in Figure 1) comprised the genes of the IV
and V phylogenetic groups, whose proteins contain two
thioredoxin active domains located in tandem at the Nterminal end. In spite of the global sequence and structural similarities between groups IV and V, the differences at both C-terminal domains and thioredoxin active
domains [20] did not allow any inference on their origin
and evolutionary relationships. The VI and VIII phylogenetic groups (Figure 1) included genes coding for proteins
with a single thioredoxin active domain; on the basis of
phylogenetic analysis and domain structure they seem
the most divergent genes in the plant PDI family.
Genes from P. patens, monocots (wheat, rice and
maize) and dicots (Arabidopsis, poplar, grapevine and
soybean) formed three distinct sub-clusters within each
of the eight PDI phylogenetic groups (Figure 1), indicating that the eight subfamilies would have emerged before
the divergence of bryophites and angiosperms. Only
three of the six PDI-like genes identified in the genome of
C. reinhardtii were included in plant phylogenetic groups
(CrPDI-4 in group V, CrPDI-5 in group VIII and CrPDI-3
in group VI; Additional file 6), indicating that only three
PDI-like genes would be common to both chlorophytes
and streptophytes, which diverged over one billion years
ago. The phylogenetic trees obtained with the first (not
shown) and second data set (Additional file 6) included
the protein CrPDI-2 of C. reinhardtii in the second major
clade, together with proteins of the IV and V phylogenetic groups. On the basis of its domain structure, in particular for the presence of the D or Erp29c domain
consisting of a C-terminal α-helical region of about 100

Page 8 of 29

aa, CrPDI-2 was more closely related to the genes of subfamily IV than to those of subfamily V. However, moss
and plant genes of the subfamily IV code for proteins
containing two thioredoxin active domains that occur in
tandem at the N-terminal end, whereas CrPDI-2 lacks a
thioredoxin active domain exhibiting an a-D domain
structure. Moreover, the algal protein is about 100 aa
shorter than its moss and flowering plant counterparts, a
size corresponding to that of a thioredoxin domain.
CrRB60 is closely related to the proteins in the II and III
phylogenetic groups and is the only C. reinhardtii protein
included in the first major clade (clade I, Additional file
6). Therefore the four subfamilies of the first major clade
(I, II, III and VII) would have been established after the
divergence of the streptophytes from the chlorophytes,
but before the divergence of the angiosperms from the
bryophytes, and would have originated through three
duplication events from an ancestral gene similar to those
belonging to the II and III phylogenetic groups, followed
by the loss of the C-terminal active thioredoxin domain
in the protein encoded by one of the four duplicated
genes. Apparently genes corresponding to that encoding
the protein CrDNJ of C. reinhardtii are not present in
moss and higher plants. This protein is characterised by
the presence of a single active thioredoxin domain and of
a N-terminal J-domain, which is characteristic of the proteins belonging to the family Hsp40 of molecular chaperones, whose members regulate the activity of Hsp70s. A
blast search showed that proteins with a J-a domain
structure are present only in unicellular green algae, such
as Ostreococcus tauri and Micromonas, and in the protozoa Paramecium tetraurelia and Cryptosporidium hominis. Also the human protein Erdj5 contains an N-terminal
J domain, but it has four active thioredoxin domains [58].
As already mentioned, each of the eight phylogenetic
groups included three distinct sub-clusters, each of them
containing PDI and PDI-like genes from P. patens, monocots and dicots; this would imply that the common ancestor of the streptophytes carried at least eight genes.
Moreover, the presence of multiple genes of the same
species within single phylogenetic groups can be
explained by duplication events occurred either after the
separation of the angiosperms from the briophytes or
later, after the diversification of monocots and dicots. In
fact six of the eight groups (I, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII)
included a single sequence of P. patens, whereas groups II
and III comprised six and two sequences, respectively
(Figure 1). The six P. patens genes of group II might have
been produced by four duplication events, which took
place after the divergence from the angiosperms; the
most divergent and therefore ancient gene would be
PpPDIL2-4. Within the same group II the monocot cluster included two genes of maize and a single gene of
wheat and rice, indicating that the duplication occurred

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

in maize after its divergence. Soybean was the only dicot
species that owned two pairs of similar paralogous genes,
most probably derived by two duplications events,
whereas Arabidopsis and grapevine had a single pair of
paralogous genes and poplar had a single gene.
The monocot genes of group I were represented by
three sequences of rice, most probably produced by two
duplications, two of maize, deriving from a single duplication, and one of wheat (Figure 1). The sequences of two
maize paralogous genes (ZmPDIL1-1 and ZmPDIL1-2)
were very similar, whereas two similar rice sequences
(OsPDIL1-2 and OsPDIL1-3) were very different from the
third sequence (OsPDIL1-1), suggesting that the first rice
duplication would have occurred long before the second
one and/or the gene diversification was faster. As for the
dicots in group I, Arabidopsis, soybean and poplar had
two similar paralogous genes, whereas the two grapevine
genes were more diversified. Group IV included a pair of
paralogous genes of rice, maize and poplar, whereas in
group VIII a single gene duplication was found only in
Arabidopsis and poplar. Like in group II, soybean was the
only species showing two pairs of paralogous genes in
groups IV and VIII. In groups III and V a single gene
duplication was found only in soybean and Arabidopsis;
finally, soybean showed a pair of close paralogous genes
in group VI, whereas all the other sequenced species were
represented by a single gene.
It is noteworthy that only group VII hosted two paralogous genes of wheat not related to the allopolyploid origin of its genome; among the monocot of this group, a
cluster included TaPDIL7-1 of wheat, OsPDIL7-1 of rice
and two very similar sequences of maize (ZmPDIL7-1
and ZmPDIL7-2), the second cluster was formed by the
genes TaPDIL7-2 of wheat and OsPDIL7-2 of rice. The
presence of at least one gene from both rice and wheat in
each of the two minimal monocot clades suggests that a
duplication occurred in the common ancestor of these
two species, whereas the lack of a maize gene in the clade
including OsPDIL7-2 and TaPDIL7-2 can be explained by
a duplication event occurred after maize speciation or by
the deletion of the maize gene, although it is not possible
to exclude that the maize gene has yet to be cloned. On
the other hand, the presence of two maize genes in the
first minimal clade may reflect the duplication of the
maize genome after its divergence from the other grass
species.
The complex patterns of gene duplication and diversification observed within each phylogenetic group could in
part be explained by the variable status of whole genome
duplication observed in dicots and monocots. Evidence of
ancient polyploidization events has been found in virtually all angiosperm genomes investigated [59,60], indicating that all angiosperms may have experienced one or
more rounds of genome duplication. On the basis of the

Page 9 of 29

complete genome sequence of grapevine, Jaillon et al. [61]
have suggested that the common ancestor of grapevine,
poplar and Arabidopsis was an ancient hexaploid species
that arose after the split between monocots and eudicots.
Further genome duplications took place later in Brassicales and in poplar lineages. The recent completion of the
soybean genome [62] has brought new evidence to the
hexaploid nature of the common ancestor of most
eudicot species and has indicated that soybean underwent two additional rounds of whole genome duplication:
an allotetraploidisation specific of the soybean lineage,
would have occurred approximately 13 million years ago,
after a previous duplication which affected the legumes'
progenitor about 59 million years ago [63]. Molecular
analyses have also indicated a genomic duplication preceding the divergence of the wild relatives of modern
cereal grasses, occurred some 60-80 million years ago;
during the first part (one-third) of their subsequent evolution limited molecular divergence would have
occurred, whereas a marked genomic divergence would
have characterized the more recent period (40-55 million
years) giving rise to genome size differences ranging from
420 Mb of rice to about 17,000 Mb of wheat [64,65]. It is
well established that maize underwent a whole genome
duplication event after its divergence from other grasses
about 11 millions years ago. Interestingly, also the moss P.
patens underwent a genome duplication between 30 and
60 million years ago [57,66].
A better understanding of the significance and dynamics of duplication events in the evolution of the PDI gene
family in plants can be based on the comparison of the
chromosomal locations of PDI and PDI-like sequences in
Arabidopsis and poplar. Six of the 13 Arabidopsis
sequences, corresponding to the close pairs of paralogous
genes included in the I, III and V phylogenetic groups
(Figure 1), have been located in duplicated regions of the
genome deriving from the most recent polyploidization
within the Brassicales. The first event was associated with
regions duplicated in chromosome 1 (AtPDIL1-1 and
AtPDIL1-2), the second duplication involved chromosomes 1 and 2 (AtPDIL5-1 and AtPDIL5-2) and the third
one chromosomes 1 and 3 (AtPDIL3-1 and AtPDIL3-2).
The other two pairs of paralogous genes assigned to the II
and VIII phylogenetic groups were found on non-duplicated regions of chromosomes 3 and 5 (AtPDIL2-1 and
AtPDIL2-2) and 3 and 4 (AtPDIL8-1 and AtPDIL8-2);
they may have been produced by a more ancient duplication event, which most probably would have occurred
after the divergence of the Eurosids I and Eurosid II,
which include soybean and Arabidopsis, respectively
[67]. In poplar the three closely related pairs of paralogous genes assigned to the I, IV and VIII phylogenetic
groups are located in chromosome regions that might
represent paralogous segments resulting from the sali-

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

coid-specific genome duplication, which occurred about
65 million years ago [68]. PtPDIL1-1 and PtPDIL1-2 are
located in homologous regions of the linkage groups LGII
and LGV, PtPDIL4-1 and PtPDIL4-2 in duplicated
regions of LGII and LGXIV, and PtPDIL8-1 and PtPDIL82 in paralogous segments of LGXIII and LGXI. Unfortunately, one of the two closely related paralogous genes of
the VII phylogenetic group (PtPDIL7-2) was not assigned
to any of the 19 linkage groups of the poplar genome.
Most probably the three close pairs of paralogous genes
observed in maize in our phylogenetic analyses
(ZmPDIL1-1 and ZmPDIL1-2; ZmPDIL2-1 and
ZmPDIL2-2; ZmPDIL7-1 and ZmPDIL7-2; Figure 1) may
have been originated through the whole genome duplication about 11 million years ago, after its divergence from
other grasses. The propensity to retain multiple copies of
paralogous genes [62,69] may explain the high number of
PDI and PDI-like genes found in soybean. Among the
analysed species only soybean has two pairs of similar
paralogous genes within some of the phylogenetic groups
of the plant PDI family (II, IV and VIII), most probably
due to the retention of all the four gene copies produced
by the two most recent whole genome duplications which
affected soybean. According to several studies, the highly
duplicated structure of the soybean genome has resulted
from an incomplete diploidization due to a low rate of
gene evolution and of structural genomic rearrangement
[69,70].
Domain structure of the deduced amino acid sequences of
the wheat PDI gene family

The deduced amino acid sequences of the 14 PDI-like
cDNAs isolated in this study (Table 1) and of the three
homoeologous cDNAs coding for the typical PDI [34],
belonging to nine different homoeologous groups, were
searched for conserved motives by comparisons with
structurally and functionally characterized sequences in
different protein databases (as in Methods). The results
are described in Table 3, which reports the structural
characteristics of the proteins, whereas Figure 2 shows
the domain organization of the wheat proteins of the PDI
family encoded by nine genes belonging to different
homoeologous groups. The deduced protein sequences
of the analysed species encoded by genes clustered into
the same phylogenetic group exhibited a high level of
structural similarity. The presence of at least a thioredoxin-like domain, which is a feature common to all the
PDI and PDI-like proteins, is necessary to accomplish
their functional role. The a and a' domains are homologous to thioredoxin and contain the -CXXC- catalytic site
for isomerase and redox activities, whereas the b and b'
domains do not show any significant homology to thioredoxin and lack of the -CXXC- active tetrapeptide; nevertheless the secondary structure of all four domains is

Page 10 of 29

similar to that of the thioredoxin. The surface-exposed
N-terminal cysteine of the -CXXC- active site tetrapeptide is responsible for the direct interaction with the substrate and is needed for any thiol-disuphide reaction,
whereas the C-terminal cysteine of the tetrapeptide is
required for many thiol-disuphide exchange reactions to
proceed efficiently and makes mixed disulphide intermediates with substrate very transient [5]. Moreover, for thioredoxin modifications in the intervening amino acids
affect the redox potential and determine the oxidant or
reducing properties of the enzyme [71,72]. The most
common active-site motif -CXHC-, typically -CGHC-, is
found in efficient thiol-disulphide oxidants of the ER and
bacterial periplasm [5]. Besides the active site tetrapeptide, there are three additional prominent determinants
of the PDI-family members enzymatic activity: 1) the
presence/absence of additional residues modulating the
pKa of the active-site cysteines; 2) the presence/absence
of a glutamic acid-lysine charged pair that is involved in
proton transfer reaction; 3) a high-affinity substratebinding site in a non catalytic domain that is essential for
isomerization reactions [5]. For instance, a conserved
arginine that is present in many members of the PDI family has been reported to modulate the pKa of the activesite cysteine residues by moving into and out of the
active-site locale [73]. This motion is involved in the timing mechanism that allows a single catalyst to act as an
efficient isomerase and oxidase of protein substrates and
facilitate the release of non-productive folding substrates.
This arginine is important for the catalysis of oxidation by
PDI, ERp57, ERp72 and P5 and is also conserved in most
of the other human PDI-family member a-like domains
[5]. In addition to a -CXXC- active site and a modulation
of the pKa values of the active-site cysteines, efficient
completion of the catalytic cycle for oxidation or reduction requires numerous proton transfer reactions both
within the catalyst and to and from the substrate [5]. In
the thioredoxins, a buried, charged glutamic acid-lysine
pair that is located under the CXXC active site is important for the catalytic activity of thioredoxin [74] and for
the oxidative activity of PDI and ERp57 [5]. Finally,
detailed in vitro enzymology on linear combinations of
PDI domains has shown that the isolated a and a'
domains can catalyse thiol-disulphide exchange reactions
in peptide and protein substrates, whereas a combination
of a catalytic domain and of the b' domain is required for
simple isomerization reactions. In fact the b' domain contains a high affinity binding site by which PDI holds the
substrate during isomerisation reactions. On the contrary, since the b domain of human PDI has never been
implicated in substrate binding, its meaning seems
mostly structural, without a direct catalytic role [75];

between domains of proteins containing more than one a and b domain on the basis of their position and not on the basis of sequence
homology); c = acidic segment; D = Erp29c domain; t = transmembrane domain. b The position of conserved charge pair sequence and arginine
residues that are considered important for the catalytic activity of different members of the human PDI family are determined on the basis of
multiple alignments of the a type domains of wheat PDI-like proteins and human classical PDI [Accession number P07237] (Figure 3). ND = not
determined because TaPDIL8-1 lacks a putative N-terminal signal peptide. Proteins without signal peptides are unlikely to be exposed to Nglycosilation machinery and thus may not be glycosylated in vivo even though they contain potential motifs.

moreover, its addition does not influence the catalytic
ability of the PDI domain constructs [76].
The typical PDI proteins encoded by the three homoeologous genes (TaPDIL1-1a/c) had a multidomain structure comprising four sequential thioredoxin-like domains
(a-b-b'-a'); moreover they had both the N-terminal signal
peptide and the C-terminal KDEL signal, which are
responsible respectively for their translocation and retention into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Table 3 and
Figure 2). Both the a and a' domains contained the CGHC- motif of the active site and the conserved arginine residues (R136 and R475) (Table 3 and Figure 3),
which are involved in the regulation of the active site
redox potential in human PDI [5,73]. In addition, two
charged glutamic acid-lysine pairs (E62-K96 and E406K439) were also conserved; they were located close to
each -CGHC- active site and, as mentioned before, are
important for the catalytic activity of the thioredoxin [74]
and for the oxidative activity of the human PDI [5].
TaPDIL2-1 and TaPDIL3-1 had a multidomain organization similar to that of the typical PDI, with the addition
of a N-terminal domain named c, which is rich of acidic

residues (Figure 2); thus the domain distribution was:c-ab-b'-a'. Remarkably, the c domain was present in all the
members of the II and III phylogenetic groups and was
reminiscent of the c domain found close to the C-terminus of the typical PDIs of mammals and to the N-terminus of homologs of ERp72 [5,19]. In mammals the c
domain is a putative low affinity and high capacity calcium-binding site; consequently, the PDI-like proteins of
the II and III phylogenetic groups could participate to
calcium storage within the cell or, alternatively, interact
with other proteins or peptides at this specific domain.
RB60 of C. reinhardtii was a PDI-like protein with a c-ab-b'-a' domain structure similar to that of the plant members in the II and III phylogenetic groups and was located
in the chloroplasts and in the ER. Levitan et al. [30] have
demonstrated that a 50 aa long leader sequence of RB60
is responsible for its correct targeting to chloroplast and
ER and is cleaved upon its translocation into the ER,
whereas it is retained after its import to the chloroplasts,
where RB60 appears associated with the thylakoid membranes; this association likely depends from the acidic
domain in the N-terminus of the protein. TaPDIL2-1 and

Figure 2 Domain structure of the deduced amino acid sequences of the wheat PDI and PDI-like genes. When multiple putative homoeologous
cDNA sequences were identified, the domain structure reported in the figure is relative to the cDNA sequence identified by the letter a. The putative
signal peptides (SP), the a and b type domains, the N-terminal acidic domains (E + D), the D domains (Erp29c), the transmembrane domains (TM) and
the DUF domain of TaPDIL8-1 are reported. The thioredoxin-like catalytic site tetra-peptides and the C-terminal tetra peptides are also reported. Numbers above indicate domain boundaries (aa) numbers on the right ORF (aa).

TaPDIL3-1 were the largest (588 and 541 aa, respectively)
PDI-like proteins identified in wheat (Table 3) and are
predicted to be secretory proteins, being characterised by
the presence of a putative N-terminal signal peptide and
of the C-terminal KDEL signal for ER retention (Figure
2). Like their orthologous proteins of wheat, the soybean
PDI proteins of the I, II and III phylogenetic groups
(GmPDIL-1, GmPDIL-2, GmPDIL-3a and GmPDIL-3b)

contained an N-terminal signal sequence for their targeting to the ER and a C-terminal ER retention sequence
KDEL; in fact they have been located in the soybean ER
lumen [26,28]. Both the a and a' domain of TaPDIL2-1
contained the -CGHC- common active site motif, moreover the arginine residues (R193 and R535) and the glutamic acid-lysine pairs (E123-K157 and E464-K497) were
conserved (Table 3 and Figure 3). Instead, TaPDIL3-1

Figure 3 Multiple sequence alignment of the a-type domains of wheat PDI-like proteins and human typical PDI. The alignment was constructed using ClustalX version 1.83 (Thompson et al. 1997) with the following parameters: gap penalty 10, gap extension penalty 0.5, BLOSUM protein
weight matrix. The alignment was also manually adjusted, taking the secondary structure predictions of wheat PDI-like proteins and the known structure of the a domain of the human PDI into account. Residues highlighted in grey and light grey showed 100% and > 50% identity conservation, respectively. The elements of the secondary structure are specified by open bars (α helices) and arrowheads (β strands). Red arrows indicate the two
buried charged residues in the vicinity of the active site, a blue arrow indicates the conserved arginine (R) located in the loop between β5 and α4 of
the catalitic domains and a black arrow the cis prolines (P) near each active site. Active-site residues within the a type domains are boxed.

showed two non-characteristic tetra-peptide active sites
(CERS and CVDC), probably affecting its redox potential
and consequently its function. In addition, the glutamic
acid in the a domain, the presumed proton acceptor of
the charged pair near the -CERS- active site, was replaced
by a leucine residue, whereas in the a' domain the arginine, which is critical for the catalytic function of the
human PDI, was replaced by a proline residue (Table 3
and Figure 3).
The PDI-like proteins encoded by putative homoeologous members of the two paralogous genes (TaPDIL7-1
and TaPDIL7-2) belonging to the VII phylogenetic group
(TaPDIL7-1a, TaPDIL7-1b and TaPDIL7-1c; TaPDIL7-2a
and TaPDIL7-2b) showed the same multidomain organi-

zation of the typical PDI (TaPDIL1-1), but they lacked the
a' C-terminal domain, as well as the KDEL signal (Figure
2). Moreover, the wheat PDI-like proteins of group VII
were characterised by the presence of a C-terminal transmembrane segment, which could retain the protein in the
ER through its anchoring to the membrane, even in the
absence of the KDEL signal. The N-terminal thioredoxin
active domain of both group VII proteins showed the
three prominent determinants of the enzymatic activity
of the PDI family members: the most common active site
-CGHC-, the conserved arginine residue and the charged
pair near the active site; the only exception was represented by the replacement of the glutamic acid with an
aspartic acid residue, even though they have similar

chemical properties (both are negatively charged and
hydrophilic) (Table 3 and Figure 3). Transmembrane proteins with the ER-luminal region characterised by an a-bb' multidomain organization have also been identified in
man, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans [19,77].
The wheat PDI-like proteins encoded by the two putative homoeologous genes of the IV phylogenetic group
(TaPDIL4-1a and TaPDIL4-1b) possessed a putative Nterminal secretory signal sequence and two tandem thioredoxin domains, enclosing a -CGHC- active site (Figure 2 and Table 3); moreover they had conserved arginine
residues (R125 and R244) and charged glutamic acidlysine pairs (E54-K87 and E173-K211), which are important for their enzymatic activity (Table 3 and Figure 3).
TaPDIL4-1a and TaPDIL4-1b, like all plant PDI-like proteins in the IV phylogenetic group, had an additional αhelical domain of about 100 aa, termed D domain, whose
function is unknown. Proteins with a°-a-D modular
structure have been identified in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [78] and in the fungi Aspergillus niger
and Neurospora crassa [79], but not in mammals, where
proteins with a C-terminal D domain, like the human
ERp28 or rat ERp29, are redox inactive, being characterised by a b-D modular structure [19]. As mentioned
before, the PDI-like protein CrPDI-2 of C. reinhardtii
contained the D domain, but lacked a thioredoxin active
domain exhibiting an a-D domain structure. In spite of
the presence of a potential ER-translocation signal, the
plant PDI-like proteins of the IV phylogenetic group differed from those isolated in fungi for the absence of an
ER-retention signal, suggesting that they might be targeted to a different subcellular location or be retained, as
part of a heteromeric complex, with other subunits containing such a signal. However, in D. discoideum it has
been shown that the C-terminal part of the D domain is
responsible for the ER retention of the PDI-D protein
[80], suggesting that the plant PDI-like proteins of the IV
phylogenetic group, all containing a D domain, may be
retained in the ER. By confocal microscopy it has been
shown that the two soybean PDI proteins belonging to
the IV phylogenetic group (GmPDIS-1 and GmPDIS-2)
are located in the ER of cotyledon cells [25]; they have
also been detected in protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) of
mature seed cotyledons, although how these PDI proteins
are transported from the ER to the PSV and what role
they play in the PSV is yet unknown [25].
TaPDIL5-1a and TaPDIL5-1b possessed two tandem
thioredoxin active domains (a°-a), each containing the
typical tetra-peptide site -CGHC-, the conserved arginine
residues (R119 and R257) and the charged glutamic acidlysine pairs (E51-K89 and E188-K226) near the active site,
and an inactive thioredoxin b domain at their C-terminus
(Table 3 and Figure 3). Moreover, they contain the signal
peptide and a modified NDEL signal for retention in the

Page 14 of 29

ER [81] (Figure 2). The soybean PDI protein of the V phylogenetic group (GmPDIM) has been shown to be an ER
luminal protein, it possesses a putative signal peptide and
the classical C-terminal ER-retention signal sequence
KDEL [27]. All the deduced amino acid sequences of the
proteins of the V phylogenetic group were tightly related
to the mammalian P5 PDI-like proteins [19] in terms of
sequence homology (about 40% identity), multidomain
organization and length.
TaPDIL6-1a and TaPDIL6-1b were encoded by two
putative homoeologous genes of the VI phylogenetic
group and were the smallest PDI-like proteins identified
in wheat, their size corresponding to that of the other
plant PDI-like sequences of the VI group (146-150 aa).
Their modular structure was very simple, being characterised by the presence of a single thioredoxin domain
containing a non-common tetra-peptide active site
(CKHC) (Figure 2). Furthermore, the charged glutamic
acid-lysine pair near the active site was replaced by a pair
of uncharged polar amino acids, such as glutamine and
serine (Q56-S95) (Table 3 and Figure 3). The mutated tetrapeptide active site and the absence nearby of the
charged glutamic acid-lysine pair involved in proton
transfer reactions were peculiar to all the plant PDI-like
proteins of the VI group and probably affect their redox
potential and consequently their function. TaPDIL6-1a
and TaPDIL6-1b contained the signal peptide and a modified EDEL signal for retention in the ER [82]. Interestingly, some plant PDI-like proteins of the VI phylogenetic
group, such as OsPDIL6-1 and ZmPDIL6-1, lack a KDELlike signal, being characterised by the presence, respectively, of the C-terminal tetrapeptides LQDS and LEAD,
for which there is no evidence of their involvement in ER
retention. Consequently, these proteins may be either
located in a different cell compartment or retained within
the ER through an unknown mechanism. In maize
mutants such as floury-2 (fl2), mucronate (Mu) and defective endosperm B30 (de*-B30), which are affected by ER
stress due to the wrong processing of seed storage proteins (α- e γ-zeins), the PDI-like protein encoded by the
single maize gene ZmPDIL6-1 of the group VI showed
very high expression, similar to that of typical PDI
(ZmPDIL1-1), BiP and calnexin [20]. However, the
behaviour of the protein encoded by the gene ZmPDIL6-1
is different from that of other chaperons, because it is
located neither within the luminal portion of the ER, nor
in the protein bodies. Further studies will be needed to
elucidate whether the location within the ER of PDI-like
proteins of the VI group is related to the accomplishment
of any specific function, or it is just transient and then
they are moved to other cell compartments.
Also TaPDIL8-1 contained a single thioredoxin active
domain with a mutated tetrapeptide sequence (CYWS)
(Figure 2 and Table 3), moreover the glutamic acid, the

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

presumed proton acceptor of the charged pair near the
active site, was replaced by an asparagine residue (Table 3
and Figure 3). Like all the plant PDI-like proteins of the
VIII phylogenetic group, TaPDIL8-1 lacked both the Nterminal signal peptide and the C-terminal KDEL signal,
but it carried two transmembrane regions, one in the Nterminus and one in the C-terminus. Moreover, it had a
C-terminal DUF1692 domain, which is present in several
proteins of unknown function; three of them (Erv41p and
Erv46p of yeast and ERGIC-32 of mouse) have partially
been characterised and are involved in the protein transport between ER and Golgi complex. Yeast Erv41p and
Erv46p are selectively and efficiently packed into COOPII
vesicle and cycled between ER and Golgi [83]. Like
ERGIC-32 of mouse, the yeast proteins lack a signal peptide sequence and are predicted to be transmembrane
proteins, with large luminal and very short N- and C-terminal cytosolic domains. However, so far it is unknown
the precise molecular mechanism by which these proteins regulate the membrane trafficking between ER and
Golgi. ERGIC-32 has been located in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [84], a complex of tubulovescicular membrane system between the rough ER and
the Golgi, which in mammals is the first anterograde/retrograde sorting station in the secretory pathway [85].
Several lines of evidence suggest that protein sorting is
only one of the ERGIC functions, but other presumed
roles may be present, although less evident. The ERGIC
appears involved in the quality control of newly synthesized proteins, as indicated by the presence of the KDEL
receptor, which cycles chaperones and folding enzymes
escaped from the ER back to this compartment; moreover, it would be involved in the retrotranslocation to the
cytosol of permanently misfolded proteins. A role of the
ERGIC has also been postulated in the folding of the
newly ER synthesized proteins before their translocation
to the Golgi complex. Further studies will be necessary to
understand whether the plant PDI-like proteins belonging to the VIII phylogenetic group are localized in a compartment similar to the ERGIC of mammals and to
investigate their function.
The functional features of the proteins encoded by the
PDI gene family of wheat can be predicted on the basis of
their domain structure and on the presence/absence of
the four major determinants whose role has been identified, as previously described, in humans. The presence of
a -CXHC- active site in combination with the three other
determinants of enzymatic activity suggest that TaPDIL11, TaPDIL2-1 TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL7-2 would be
involved in disulphide bond formation. Since both
TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDIL5-1 lacked the b'-like domain, but
retained the other features and the -CXHC- active site,
they would be expected to be efficient oxidases. Due to
the presence of a D domain, TaPDIL4-1 should also pos-

Page 15 of 29

sess isomerase activity. In fact it has been shown that the
D domain of Wind of Drosophila, encoded by a gene
ortholog of ERp29 of rat, contains a binding site for its
substrate [86]. These predictions are in line with recent
studies on the oxidative refolding activity of the recombinant PDI proteins of soybean GmPDIL-1, GmPDIL-2,
GmPDIS-1/2 and GmPDIM, which are orthologous to
the wheat proteins TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL2-1, TaPDIL4-1
and TaPDIL5-1. The five soybean proteins are able to catalyze the oxidative refolding of reduced and denatured
Rnase A, although with different efficiency: the activity of
GmPDIM, GmPDIS-1 and GmPDIS-2 was approximately
10% of GmPDIL-1 and 20% of GmPDIL-2 [25-27]. These
data indicate that the domain architecture of the PDI proteins and most probably the presence of the b' domain
plays an important role in their oxidase and isomerase
activities, at least in vitro. The five soybean PDI proteins
have oxidative folding activities in vitro and are located in
the cotyledon ER, consequently they could be involved in
the folding of seed storage proteins such as glycinin and
β-conglycin. Moreover, four of them, except GmPDIM,
function as molecular chaperones, by preventing the
aggregation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) (1-40) monomers
(GmPDIS-1/2) or unfolded rhodanase (GmPDIL-1 and
GmPDIL-2) [25,26]. Data from coimmunoprecipitation
and crosslinking experiments have shown that the five
PDI soybean proteins may play different roles in the folding of storage proteins. Under normal conditions an association has been detected between GmPDIS-1 and
GmPDIM and either proglycinin or β-conglycin [25,27],
indicating their primary function in the folding of the
storage proteins. However, a strong association of GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIL-2 with the proglycinin and the βconglycin α-subunit was detected in the cotyledon cells
under conditions that disrupt the folding of the proteins
in the ER, such as the presence of dithiothreitol or tunicamycin [26]; this suggests the role of GmPDIL-1 and
GmPDIL-2 as molecular chaperones, involved in the
folding or quality control of the seed storage proteins.
TaPDIL6-1 possessed both the -CXHC- active site and
the conserved arginine residue; however the glutamicacid proton acceptor was absent, suggesting that its activity as potential catalyst of oxidation reactions would be
relatively inefficient. In fact, in vitro analysis of ERp18, a
human PDI-like protein whose structural features are
similar to TaPDIL6-1, showed that its oxidase activity was
only 15% of the a domain of the human PDI [82]. Both
the N-terminal a domains of TaPDIL3-1 and TaPDIL8-1
lacked the conserved glutamic acid proton acceptor and
the C-terminal cysteine in their active sites. Due to the
unusual structure and catalytic motif of TaPDIL8-1 it is
difficult to predict its functional role, whereas it is possible to hypothesize that TaPDIL3-1 could retain at least
partially its original function. Accordingly, the N-termi-

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

nal a' domain of TaPDIL3-1, apart the unusual intervening amino acid at the active site sequence, retained the
other determinants of enzymatic activity. However, the
soybean PDI proteins GmPDIL-3a and GmPDIL-3b,
orthologous to TaPDIL3-1, do not show any oxidase or
reductase activitiy in vitro [28]. Replacement of the second and third amino acid in standard redox active CGHC- motifs found in the a' domain of GmPDIL-3a and
GmPDIL-3b and in all the plant PDI proteins of the III
phylogenetic group may explain the lack of such enzymatic activities. Alternatively, the absence of other amino
acids such as arginine, which is important for the regulation of the redox potential of the active site in human
PDI, may cause the lack of enzymatic activity. In addition,
neither GmPDIL-3a nor GmPDIL-3b showed chaperone
activity in vitro and interaction between these PDI proteins and storage proteins (such as proglycinin and βconglycin) and other ER molecular chaperones (such as
calnexin, calreticulin, BIP and PDI family proteins) was
not detected in vivo [28], suggesting that GmPDIL-3a and
GmPDIL-3b may not act as chaperones in the ER. However, a fraction of GmPDIL-3a and GmPDIL-3b formed
complexes with unidentified proteins in the ER in both
thiol-dependent and thiol-independent ways. Identification of partner proteins in the mixed disulfide and non
covalent complexes of GmPDIL-3a and GmPDIL3-b
would be important to clarify the biochemical and physiological functions of plant PDI proteins belonging to the
III phylogenetic group.
Chromosome location of the wheat PDI-like genes and
syntenic relationships with their orthologous genes of rice

The wheat gene sequences encoding the typical PDI
(TaPDL1-1) had previously been located by aneuploid
analysis in chromosome arms 4AL, 4BS and 4DS of bread
wheat [34]. The chromosome location of genes corresponding to the eight novel full-length PDI-like cDNA
sequences isolated in this study were determined through
Southern analysis of DNA from CS and its nulli-tetrasomic (NT) lines. For each PDI-like sequence the optimal
combination of restriction enzyme and gene specific
probe was previously selected on the basis of Southern
analysis of CS DNA (data not shown) and then used for
aneuploid analysis with the NT lines of CS. Except for
TaPDIL2-1, the Southern patterns of seven PDI-like
sequences allowed the chromosome assignment of all
their hybridization fragments and showed that the corresponding genes were present in single copy for each of
the three genomes (Fig 4A-G). The following combinations of restriction enzymes and gene specific probes
were used in Southern analysis of CS and its aneuploid
lines: 1) NcoI, TaPDIL3-1; 2) SacI, TaPDIL4-1; 3) EcoRV,
TaPDIL5-1; 4) HindIII, TaPDIL6-1; 5) EcoRI, TaPDIL7-1;
6) DraI, TaPDIL7-2; all the hybridisation patterns con-

sisted of three fragments corresponding to the three
homoeologous genes of the allohexaploid wheat genome
(Figure 4A-F). On the basis of NT analysis the three
hybridisation fragments were located in the following
chromosome homoeologous groups: 1) TaPDIL3-1,
group 7; 2) TaPDIL4-1, group 1; 3) TaPDIL5-1, group 5;
4) TaPDIL6-1, group 4; 5) TaPDIL7-1, group 2; 6)
TaPDIL7-2, group 6 (Figure 4A-F). For TaPDIL8-1 the
simplest hybridisation pattern resulted from the digestion
of CS DNA with HindIII and consisted of five fragments,
one located in chromosome 2A, two in 2B and two in 2D
(Fig 4G). This complex hybridisation pattern was caused
by an internal HindIII restriction site in the homoeologous sequences of TaPDIL8-1 located in chromosomes
2B and 2D, as confirmed also by restriction analysis of the
cloned genomic sequence, corresponding to one of the
three homoeologous genes.
For TaPDIL2-1 no simple restriction pattern could be
identified with all enzyme/gene specific probe combinations tested, but it was evident that only the chromosomes of homoeologous group 6 were involved. To
confirm this assignment, the genomic DNA of CS was
amplified by primer pairs designed in different regions of
the sequence; several different amplification patterns displaying from one to four fragments were obtained by
electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel (data not shown). The
primer pair flanking a region spanning the last 3 introns
of TaPDIL2-1, which displayed the best pattern consisting of four fragments of about 1,5 kb, was subsequently
used to amplify the NT lines of CS. Aneuploid analysis
located the four amplification products in the chromosomes of the homoeologous group 6 (Figure 4H), with the
smallest amplicon located in chromosome 6D, the second
largest in 6B and the remaining two in 6A, showing that a
duplication event involving TaPDIL2-1 took place in the
genome A.
Considering the main syntenic relationships between
rice and wheat chromosomes, the locations of the eight
PDI-like genes of wheat are compatible with those of
their orthologous genes of rice, as shown in Additional
file 7. The seven wheat homoeologous groups (w1-w7)
were in fact syntenic to the 12 rice chromosomes (r1r12), in particular w1 = r5 + r10, w2 = r7 + r4, w3 = r1, w4
= r3 + r11, w5 = r12 + r9 + r3, w6 = r2 and w7 = r6 + r8
[87]. Since the order of single copy rice genes is remarkably conserved across the wheat bins [88], in spite of the
extensive duplications and rearrangements occurred in
both species [89], it was decided to exploit the outputs of
the sequence-based macrocolinearity between the MSU
Rice Pseudomolecules (Release 6.1) [90] and Wheat EST
markers, whose location on the wheat Bin map is
reported in GrainGenes [91], to asses the syntenic relationships between the regions of the wheat and rice chromosomes flanking the PDI-like genes. The search of the

flanking Wheat Bin Mapped Markers [92] reported onto
Rice Pseudomolecules [93], for each orthologous PDI-like
gene of rice [20], indicated for six of them (TaPDIL3-1,
TaPDIL4-1, TaPDIL5-1, TaPDIL7-1, TaPDIL7-2 and
TaPDIL8-1), the presence of several flanking markers in
the regions surrounding the orthologous genes of rice;
they were located in the same homoeologous group
wherein the wheat PDI-like genes had previously been
assigned through Southern analysis (Additional file 7). In
two cases, the identified marker of rice coincided with the
searched gene: TaPDIL5-1/CSU223BE399897 and
TaPDIL7-2/UCD078BF201426. The rice gene OsPDIL2-1
(OsPDIL1-4 in [20]), orthologous to TaPDIL2-1 of wheat,
was located at the extreme end of rice chromosome 2,
where no Wheat Bin Mapped Marker was found. The
closest available markers were reported on the rice
Pseudomolecule further downstream of OsPDIL2-1; nevertheless all of them mapped to the short arm of the

group 6 homoeologous chromosomes of wheat, the same
location of TaPDIL2-1 determined through Southern and
PCR analyses (Additional file 7). Only for the rice gene
OsPDIL6-1 (also named OsPDIL5-1), whose orthologous
wheat gene TaPDIL6-1 was located in group 4 homoeologous chromosomes, the closest identified marker
KSU035BE406977 mapped to the group 1 homoeologous
chromosomes; nevertheless, all the other identified flanking markers mapped into the group 4 chromosomes.
Besides confirming the chromosome locations previously
identified by NT lines, the analysis permitted the assignment of the PDI-like genes to specific arms of the wheat
homoeologous chromosomes. The chromosome arm
location and homoeologous groups were as follows:
TaPDIL2-1: 6S; TaPDIL3-1: 7S; TaPDIL4-1: 1S; TaPDIL51: 5L; TaPDIL7-1: 2L; TaPDIL7-2: 6L; TaPDIL8-1: 2S.
TaPDIL6-1 was located in the short arm of chromosome
4A and in the long arms of chromosomes 4B and 4D; this

apparent anomaly can be explained by a well known pericentric inversion occurred in wheat chromosome 4A
[94]. In conclusion present study confirmed the high level
of synteny between rice and wheat chromosomes, opening opportunities for saturation of specific chromosome
regions of wheat exploiting rice markers and subsequent
chromosome walking and gene positional cloning.
Genomic organization of the wheat PDI-like genes

The genomic sequences encoding the eight novel PDIlike genes were amplified by the same primer combinations which had previously been used to clone the corresponding cDNA sequences. Two independent PCR
reactions were performed for each primer combination,
the products of both amplifications had the same electrophoretic mobility. Four cloned amplicons for each PDIlike gene were partially sequenced at their ends using universal primers; a single clone for each gene was chosen
and both strands were completely sequenced using internal primers. Therefore, for each of the eight novel PDI
genes only one genomic clone, corresponding to one of
the homoeologous genes, was completely sequenced and
its structure was compared with that of other plant PDI
genes.
The lengths of the genomic sequences of the eight nonhomeologous PDI-like genes were: 1) TaPDIL2-1: 5213
bp; 2) TaPDIL3-1: 4294 bp; 3) TaPDIL4-1: 3820 bp, 4)
TaPDIL5-1: 5326 bp 5) TaPDIL6-1: 2162 bp; 6) TaPDIL71: 2887 bp; 7) TaPDIL7-2: 2475 bp; 8) TaPDIL8-1: 7034
bp; they were aligned with the corresponding cDNA
sequences to determine the exon-intron structure.
Sequence alignment showed an almost perfect nucleotide
match between the cDNA sequences and the corresponding exonic regions of the genomic sequences and evidenced the complex genomic organization of the eight
cloned PDI-like genes of wheat. Their genomic structure
included the following exon numbers: 12 in TaPDIL2-1
and TaPDIL3-1; 11 in TaPDIL4-1; 9 in TaPDIL5-1; 4 in
TaPDIL6-1; 5 in TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL7-2; 15 in
TaPDIL8-1 (Figure 5). The comparison between the
exon/intron structure and the domain architecture of the
wheat PDI and PDI-like genes revealed that the ends of
some domains corresponded to the exon/intron junctions
(a' in TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL2-1 and TaPDIL3-1; a° in
TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDIL5-1; a in TaPDIL4-1), whereas
some other domain boundaries fell within the same exon
(a, b and b' in TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL2-1, TaPDIL7-1,
TaPDIL7-2; a and b in TaPDIL3-1 and TaPDIL5-1) (Figure 5); the D domain in TaPDIL4-1 and the two transmembrane domain in TaPDIL8-1 were structurally
independent. When present the signal peptide and the
acidic domain were always located in the first exon and
structurally linked to the most N-terminal a domain.

The PDI and PDI-like genes of wheat, Arabidopsis, rice
and P. patens belonging to the same phylogenetic group
revealed a high level of conservation of their structural
features, in terms of intron pattern and exon number, size
and position of the active sites (Additional file 8); consistent with previous studies [95,96]; the corresponding
genes of the alga C. reinhardtii showed a very different
intron-exon structure (data not shown).
As reported in the phylogenetic analysis section, the
first phylogenetic group (typical PDI) included a single
gene of wheat (TaPDIL1-1), two of Arabidopsis
(AtPDIL1-1 and AtPDIL1-2) and three of rice (OsPDIL11, OsPDIL1-2 and OsPDIL1-3), four of them (TaPDIL1-1,
AtPDIL1-2, OsPDIL1-1 and OsPDIL1-2) consisting of ten
exons. Since this same gene structure is present in the
three species, it is plausible that the progenitor species of
Monocots and Dicots owned ten exons. The genes
AtPDIL1-1 of Arabidopsis and OsPDIL1-3 of rice contained nine exons, most probably they were produced by
the deletion of the 7th and 2nd introns, respectively (Additional file 8). The genomic organization observed in the
PDI genes of the angiosperms is very old and has been
conserved during evolution; in fact eight of the nine
exons of the moss P. patens gene PpPDIL1-1 were similar
to those in the angiosperms' genes, suggesting that this
genomic organization was already present before their
diversification. The close sequence homology and the
similar exon/intron structure, suggests that AtPDIL1-2 of
Arabidopsis, OsPDIL1-1 of rice and TaPDIL1-1 of wheat
represent the orthologous genes, whereas AtPDIL1-1,
OsPDIL1-2 and OsPDIL1-3 would be paralogous genes
produced by duplication and diversification events. All
the genes of the first phylogenetic group have in both
active sites the conserved tetrapeptide -CGHC-.
The genomic structure of the genes in the second phylogenetic group (TaPDIL2-1 of wheat; OsPDIL2-1 of rice;
AtPDIL2-1 and AtPDIL2-2 of Arabidopsis) and of the
third group (TaPDIL3-1 of wheat; OsPDIL3-1 of rice;
AtPDIL3-1 and AtPDIL3-2 of Arabidopsis) included 12
exons. The exons of the genes in the second group were
highly conserved, except for the first and last exons and
an insertion of three nucleotides in the third exon of
OsPDIL2-1, whereas the genes of the third group were
less conserved, in terms of intron positions and exon
lengths (Additional file 8 and Figure 5). Besides the terminal ones, the exons of genes in the third group showed the
most relevant divergence from the corresponding exons
of the genes of the second group (6, 7, 9, 10 and 11),
whereas exons 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 were highly conserved
between the two groups. The comparison of the genomic
organization supports the common origin of the genes
belonging to the phylogenetic groups 2 and 3 and is consistent with their close clustering obtained by phylogenetic analysis (Fig 1 and Additional file 6) and with their

each identified domain are labelled by braces.

conserved domain architecture (Fig 2). The genes of the
second and third group showed a tightly conserved location of the sequences encoding the tetrapeptide active
sites, which in wheat were 200 bp from the end of the first
exon and 120 bp from the end of the tenth exon; the
amino acid sequences of the tetrapeptides were less conserved, especially among proteins encoded by the genes
of the third group. The most conserved sequence CGHC- was present in the C-terminal active site of the
four proteins in the second group and in the N-terminal
site of the proteins TaPDIL2-1 and AtPDIL2-2, whereas
the N-terminal tetrapeptide of OsPDIL2-1 was -CAHCand that of AtPDIL2-1 was -CGAC-. The C-terminal
active site in the third group proteins was -CVNC- in
AtPDIL3-1, -CINC- in AtPDIL3-2 and -CVDC- in
TaPDIL3-1 and OsPDIL3-1; the N-terminal tetrapeptide
was -CARS- in both Arabidopsis proteins and -CERS- in
the proteins of wheat and rice. In P. patens there were six
PDI-like genes in the second phylogenetic group and two
in the third; their genomic structure was very diversified
in exon number: PpPDIL2-4 in the second group and
PpPDIL3-1 in the third group had the typical structure of
the genes belonging to these groups consisting of 12
exons, whereas the other P. patens genes showed a lower
number of exons, in particular PpPDIL2-1 and PpPDIL22 owned a single exon (Additional file 8).
The fourth phylogenetic group included a single gene of
wheat (TaPDIL4-1) and Arabidopsis (AtPDIL4-1) and two
of rice (OsPDIL4-1 and OsPDIL4-2); the three monocot
genes had 11 exons, whereas the of Arabidopsis one had
10 exons (Additional file 9). Except the terminal ones, the
exons were highly conserved in all the four genes. Since
the P. patens gene PpPDIL4-1 had 11 exons like the genes
of wheat and rice, most probably the ancestral gene of the
fourth group had 11 exons and one of them got lost during Arabidopsis evolution. All the active sites of the IV
group proteins had the conserved tetrapeptide -CGHC-.
The fifth group contained a single gene of wheat
(TaPDIL5-1) and rice (OsPDIL5-1), whereas Arabidopsis
was represented by two paralogous genes (AtPDIL5-1 and
AtPDIL5-2). All the genes in this phylogenetic group,
including the P. patens gene (PpPDIL5-1), enclosed nine
exons whose length, except for the first and last ones,
were perfectly conserved across the analysed species; also
the typical tetrapeptide -CGHC- was conserved in all the
protein active sites.
The genes in the sixth phylogenetic group, AtPDIL6-1,
OsPDIL6-1 and TaPDIL6-1, presented a conserved
genomic structure including four exons, whereas the
moss P. patens PpPDIL6-1 exibited a single exon (Additional file 8). Possible explanations are either intron colonization after the separation of angiosperms and
bryophytes or intron loss during P. patens evolution [97].
The single tetrapeptide active site of these proteins was

Page 20 of 29

the typical -CGHC- in the moss, and the slightly modified
-CKHC- in the three angiosperm.
The seventh group included two genes of wheat
(TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL7-2), two of rice (OsPDIL7-1 and
OsPDIL7-2) and a single gene of Arabidopsis (AtPDIL71): they had five exons and their protein products had the
single typical tetrapeptide -CGHC-; the moss gene
PpPDIL7-1 had four exons and a modified tetrapeptide CKHC-.
The eighth phylogenetic group contained two genes of
Arabidopsis (AtPDIL8-1 and AtPDIL8-2) and one of rice
(OsPDIL8-1), wheat (TaPDIL8-1) and moss (PpPDIL8-1);
all the genes included 15 very well conserved exons. The
proteins belonging to this phylogenetic group presented a
non characteristic tetrapeptide sequence at their single
active site: -CYWS- in AtPDIL8-1, OsPDIL8-1 and
TaPDIL8-1, -CYWC- in AtPDIL8-2 and -CPWS- in
PpPDIL8-1. The well conserved structure of these genes,
even in the moss, suggests that this complex genomic
organization was already present in the ancestral gene of
the common ancestor of angiosperms and bryophytes.
Expression patterns of PDI and PDI-like genes in wheat
tissues

The relative and absolute quantification of the transcripts
of nine PDI and PDI-like genes in different tissues and
developmental stages (data set n. 1), are reported in Additional file 9. In order to make the graphs more readable,
the nine genes were split into two groups on the basis of
their phylogenetic and structural relationships. The first
group included five genes belonging to the first major
clade of the plant PDI family (TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL2-1,
TaPDIL3-1, TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL7-2), the second
group comprised two genes of the second major clade
(TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDL5-1) and two additional genes
(TaPDIL6-1 and TaPDIL8-1) coding for proteins with a
single thioredoxin domain. The nine genes were constitutively expressed in all the analysed tissues, even though
their transcription levels were highly variable. TaPDIL1-1
and TaPDIL2-1 were highly expressed in immature caryopses (Seeds2 collected 10 DPA in Additional file 9A and
9B); the estimated absolute number of transcripts per μg
of total RNA exceeded 900,000 copies for TaPDIL1-1 and
300,000 copies for TaPDIL2-1 (Additional file 9B). The
expression level of TaPDIL1-1 remained relatively high
also during later stages of seed development, with absolute amount of transcripts of about 200,000 copies in 38
DPA caryopses (Seeds 7, Additional file 9B). The transcription level of the other seven PDI-like genes in all the
tested tissues and that of TaPDIL1-1 and TaPDIL2-1 in
the remaining ten tissues did not exceed 120,000 copies
per μg of total RNA (Additional file 11B and D). All the
wheat genes of the PDI family showed a broad range of
expression across the analysed tissues, as expected for

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

genes accomplishing key metabolic functions and as
demonstrated for the PDI family members in all studied
plant species [20,25-28,98]. The highly diversified expression rates and patterns exhibited by the analysed genes
are easily explained by the need of their spatial and temporal regulation requested to accomplish the metabolic
role of the PDI and PDI-like proteins in specific tissues
and developmental stages. The very high transcription of
TaPDIL1-1 and TaPDIL2-1 detected in the caryopses is
consistent with their proposed role during the seed development, in particular for the correct synthesis and accumulation of seed storage proteins and starch, as discussed
later.
Caryopses were excluded from the second data set (Figure 6A-D), since the very high transcription of TaPDIL11 and TaPDIL2-1 in this sample flattened and masked the
expression variation among the remaining tissues (see
graphs in Additional file 11). Three groups were recognized among the nine genes considering the average
expression level in the ten samples of the second data set:
three genes (TaPDIL2-1, TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDIL8-1)
with high (more than 60,000 copies); two genes
(TaPDIL1-1 and TaPDIL5-1) with medium (between
40,000 and 50,000 copies) and four genes (TaPDIL3-1,
TaPDIL6-1, TaPDIL7-2 and TaPDIL7-1) with low expression (below 25,000 copies).
The expression of the gene encoding the typical PDI
(TaPDIL1-1) was quite constant in all the ten tissues analysed, the highest transcription levels being detected in
the middle stage of spike development (Spikes2) and in
roots (Figure 6A and 6B). The transcription level of
TaPDIL2-1 was very high in spikes (in particular during
the early stages of development) and significantly higher
than that of TaPDIL1-1, whereas its expression was moderate in roots and very low in stems and leaves of plants at
booting stages (Figure 6A and 6B). The transcription rate
of TaPDIL2-1 increased during the vegetative growth and
reached a maximum at the tillering stage (Shoots3);
moreover, its expression during shoot development was
the highest among the nine genes. The protein encoded
by the Arabidopsis gene AtPDIL2-1 (AtPDIL1-3 in [20]),
homologous to TaPDIL2-1, was detected in the stromalstarch interface of leaf chloroplasts, suggesting its
involvement in the starch synthesis within leaf tissues and
possibly intervening in the posttranslational redox regulation of the activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase
(AGPase) [99]. Among the proteins encoded by the PDI
and PDI-like genes that have been characterized in soybean [25-28]; GmPDIL-2, the soybean orthologous to the
Arabidopsis AtPDIL2-1, in agreement with its potential
role in starch biosynthesis was found highly expressed
during all the leaf developmental stages and the only protein of the PDI family highly expressed in fully developed
leaves [26]. The high expression of TaPDIL2-1, detected

Page 21 of 29

not only during shoots development but also in developing spikes and caryopses of wheat, seems congruent with
its metabolic role, since active starch synthesis takes place
in all these tissues.
The expression patterns of TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDIL8-1
were very similar to that of TaPDIL2-1, but the transcription of TaPDIL8-1 was lower in the early stages of spike
development and increased during middle to late stages
until heading time (Figure 6C and 6D). The possible
involvement of TaPDIL4-1 in the development of the vegetative and reproductive meristems is suggested by its
strong expression during early stages of spike, shoot and
root development. The orthologous gene of Arabidopsis
AtPDIL4-1 (AtPDIL2-1 in [20]) of the same group IV
showed a similar expression pattern in the analysed tissues [100]. The functional analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed its involvement during seed set and
ovule development.
TaPDIL3-1 encoded a protein whose structure was similar to that of TaPDIL2-1; however its expression was
much lower in most analysed tissues, but much higher in
roots (Figure 6). Two ER resident proteins of soybean
(GmPDIL-3a and GmPDIL-3b), encoded by genes orthologous to TaPDIL3-1, were ubiquitously expressed in the
analysed tissues and their expression increased in the cotyledons during seed maturation; however, as discussed
previously, they did not exhibit any oxidoreductase or
molecular chaperone activity and their metabolic role is
not clear [28]. As observed for TaPDIL3-1, the expression
of TaPDIL7-2 and TaPDIL6-1 was higher in roots than in
other tissues, but comparable, or even slightly lower, to
that of the genes included in the high and intermediate
expression groups (TaPDIL2-1, TaPDIL4-1, TaPDIL8-1
and TaPDIL1-1). The expression levels of TaPDIL3-1 and
TaPDIL7-2 were relatively higher also in spikes, whereas
the lowest amount of transcripts was detected in vegetative tissues, such as leaves, stems and shoots. Instead, the
transcription level of TaPDIL5-1 was relatively higher in
shoots after tillering (Shoots3) and at the beginning of
erect growth (Shoots4) than in spikes (Figure 6C and 6D).
Finally, the expression of TaPDIL7-1 did not show any
remarkable variation among the ten tissues analysed, a
slightly higher level of transcription was observed in
shoots collected from plants at the stage of three
unfolded leaves (Shoots1), at the beginning of tillering
(Shoots2) and with formed tillers (Shoots3) and in stems
(Figure 6C and 6D).
Expression patterns of PDI and PDI-like genes in wheat
floral organs

The expression of the nine PDI and PDI-like genes was
also compared in six single floral organs from fully
emerged spikes (Figure 6E-H). Generally, the transcription of the nine genes was lower in the flower vegetative

Figure 6 Expression analysis of PDI and PDI-like genes in different tissues and floral organs. Relative (A, C, E and G) and absolute (B, D, F and
H) quantification of the expression level of nine PDI and PDI-like genes in 10 tissues or developmental stages of wheat (A, B, C and D) and in wheat
floral organs from fully emerged spikes (E, F, G and H). 20 cDNA pools (two biological replicates, 10 plant samples; A, B, C and D) and 12 cDNA pools
(two biological replicates, 6 floral organ samples; E, F, G and H) were tested in triplicate and normalized using the geometric average of the relative
expression of the two reference genes encoding Cell division control protein and ADP-ribosylation factor. The relative expression levels of the nine
genes were referred to that of a calibrator set to the value one, which was represented by the tissue (A and C) or floral organ (E and G) with the lowest
expression. The absolute expression levels of the nine genes were expressed as number of cDNA copies per μg of reverse transcribed total RNA (B, D,
F and H). Normalized values of relative and absolute expressions of the nine genes are given as average ± SD.

organs (glumes, lemma, palea and lodicules), than in the
male and female reproductive organs (stamens and pistil);
however the absolute copy number of transcripts varied
considerably. The highest average absolute expression
levels were detected for TaPDIL2-1, TaPDIL4-1 and
TaPDIL8-1 (more than 40,000 copies/μg RNA); intermediate for TaPDIL1-1 and TaPDIL5-1 (between 25,000 and
40,000 copies); lowest for TaPDIL3-1, TaPDIL6-1,
TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL7-2 (between 10,000 and 25,000
copies). The expression pattern of TaPDIL1-1 and
TaPDIL2-1 was very similar and their transcription level
in the pistil was about 3 times higher than in other floral
organs (Figure 6E and 6F); also the expression of
TaPDIL7-2 was higher in the pistil than in other floral
organs, but lower than TaPDIL1-1 and TaPDIL2-1.
TaPDIL3-1 expression in stamens and pistil was 5-7 times
higher than in glumes, lemma and palea, and 3-4 times
higher than in lodicules. Also TaPDIL4-1, TaPDIL5-1 and
TaPDIL6-1 were more expressed in both the reproductive
floral organs, but their transcription rate was only twice
higher than in vegetative floral organs (Figure 6G and
6H). Finally, the expression of TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL8-1
was only slightly higher in stamens and pistil than in the
flower vegetative organs.
The expression of all the analysed genes was higher in
the reproductive than in the vegetative floral organs,
most probably for accomplishing the more specialised
developmental program and more intense metabolic
activity [101]. To our knowledge the only reported
expression analysis for a PDI protein in different floral
organs has involved the typical PDI (PDI5) of Arabidopsis
which is encoded by AtPDIL1-1, homologous to the
wheat gene TaPDIL1-1 [102]. PDI5 was preferentially
expressed in all gynoecial tissues including the ovary, the
septum and the ovules, where it was located in the ER of
endothelial cells; expression of PDI5 was also detected,
although at lower level, in stamens and petals. Loss of
PDI5 leads to premature initiation of PCD (Programmed
Cell Death) in endothelial cells during embryo development and to formation of fewer and often non viable
seeds. Consequently, Ondzighi et al. [102] have proposed
that, beside its well known functions, the typical PDI of
Arabidopsis is also required for proper embryogenesis
and temporal progression of PCD by chaperoning and
inhibiting Cys proteases during their trafficking via Golgi
to vacuoles, before the initiation of PCD of endothelial
cells.
Expression patterns of PDI and PDI-like genes in
developing caryopses

The transcription levels of the nine genes of the wheat
PDI family were investigated in a series of seven developmental stages of caryopses collected at 5-6 days intervals
from 5 to 38 days post anthesis (DPA) (Figure 7A-F). The

Page 23 of 29

analysed caryopses covered the stages of endosperm
development from cellularisation to desiccation, or physiological maturity [103,104]. Analyses by qRT-PCR indicated a considerable variation of transcription rate
between the nine genes. The highest average absolute
amount of transcripts in the seven seed samples was
detected for TaPDIL1-1 (433,386 copies), TaPDIL2-1 and
TaPDIL8-1 (both about 100,000 copies); TaPDIL4-1 and
TaPDIL6-1 had an intermediate expression (about 40,000
copies); the lowest expression was exhibited by TaPDIL31, TaPDIL5-1, TaPDIL7-1 and TaPDIL7-2, whose average
absolute amount of transcripts was comprised in the
range of 20,000-25,000 copies per μg of total RNA.
The most expressed genes TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL2-1 and
TaPDIL8-1 displayed divergent expression patterns during grain development. TaPDIL1-1 expression was higher
in the very early stages of seed development (highest level
10 DPA), then decreased steeply between 15 and 21 DPA,
during the transition from the endosperm cell division
(cellularisation) to the start of grain filling (the deposition
of starch and gluten proteins), then increased again until
32 DPA, when the deposition of seed storage reserves
decreased and seeds started desiccating (Figure 7A and
7B); the lowest level of transcription was detected at the
physiological maturity (38 DPA). Also the expression of
TaPDIL2-1 was higher during the early stages of seed
development (10 DPA), then decreased gradually, reaching the lowest level at the physiological maturity (Figure
7A and 7B). The expression pattern of TaPDIL8-1 was
more complex: its transcription was very high five DPA,
decreased 10 and 15 DPA, increased again 21 DPA,
remaining at the same level 32 DPA, then reached the
lowest level at physiological maturity 38 DPA (Figure 7E
and 7F). The expression patterns of TaPDIL4-1 and
TaPDIL5-1 were fairly similar to that of the typical PDI
(TaPDIL1-1), although their overall transcription rate
was much lower. They were highly expressed during the
early stages of seed development (5-10 DPA), moderately
expressed at the end of the grain filling and at physiological maturity (32-38 DPA), and expressed at very low level
during grain filling (15-27 DPA). A similar behaviour was
also observed for TaPDIL6-1, with the only difference
that its transcription level was slightly higher during late
(32-38 DPA) than early stages (5-10 DPA) of grain development. The expression of TaPDIL3-1 was very high 5
DPA, then decreased rapidly 10 DPA and remained at the
same level until 21 DPA, then decreased gradually until
physiological maturity (38 DPA) (Figure 7C and 7D).
Finally, the transcription rate of TaPDIL7-1 increased
about twice from 5 to 10 DPA, then remained stable for
the remainder of the time-course studied, whereas no significant variation was detected in the expression of its
paralogous gene TaPDIL7-2 in the seven seed samples
analysed.

Figure 7 Expression analysis of PDI and PDI-like genes in developing caryopses. Relative (A, C and E) and absolute (B, D and F) quantification of
the expression level in developing caryopses collected between 5 and 38 DPA (days post anthesis) of nine PDI and PDI-like genes. The 14 cDNA pools
(two biological replicates, seven developing caryopsis samples) were tested in triplicate and normalized using the geometric average of the relative
expression of the two reference genes encoding Cell division control protein and ADP-ribosylation factor. The relative expression levels of the nine
genes (A, C and E) were referred to that of a calibrator set to the value one, which was represented by the developmental stage with the lowest expression. The absolute expression levels of the nine genes were expressed as number of cDNA copies per μg of reverse transcribed total RNA (B, D

Proteins of the PDI family are important components
of the machinery that assists in the folding, assembling
and sorting of secretory proteins via the ER; since wheat
seeds contain a variety of secretory proteins, their folding
could be assisted by PDI proteins. Apart from a low
amount of proteases, hydrolases and α-amylase inhibitors, the seed storage proteins (prolamins or gluten proteins) represent 80-90% of total seed proteins;
consequently the very high seed expression of TaPDIL11, TaPDIL2-1 and TaPDIL4-1, whose protein products
contain two thioredoxin active domains, may be related
to their role in the developing wheat endosperm. The
study of the synthesis and deposition of the major storage
components during wheat seed development has shown
that the accumulation of gluten proteins and starch takes
place essentially in parallel fashion [105]. Both processes
increase steadily between 12 and 35 DPA and keep on
constantly until 42 DPA, when protein accumulation vir-

tually ceases; a dramatic increase of large glutenin polymers takes place during grain desiccation [105]. Present
data on expression analysis showed that the mRNA level
of some PDI genes such as TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL2-1,
TaPDIL4-1, and TaPDIL5-1, whose encoded proteins
contain two active thioredoxin domains, increased dramatically during the early stages of seed development (510 DPA), then declined steadily during the major part of
the grain filling period (15-27 DPA), indicating that the
temporal expression of these PDI genes was not tightly
co-ordinated with the expression of storage proteins,
starting earlier in grain development and reaching a maximum before the period of highest synthesis of gluten
proteins. A key role of the wheat PDI and PDI-like proteins in the folding and deposition of wheat storage proteins cannot reliably be assumed merely on the basis of
the present expression data, which,. however, point to
their involvement at some early stage of protein process-

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

ing and protein body formation or to a more general
housekeeping role in the processing of secretory proteins.
For TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDIL5-1 it is noteworthy the presence of a second peak of transcripts detected
by qRT-PCR between 27 and 32 DPA, when the deposition of seed storage reserves decreased and seeds started
desiccating. Seemingly the PDI proteins encoded by these
genes may play an important role in later stages of seed
development, when there is a dramatic increase of large
gluten polymers stabilised by the formation and/or the
rearrangement of inter-chain disulphide bonds [105].
The abundance of TaPDIL2-1 transcripts found in the
developing caryopses could also be related to the starch
synthesis, as shown for other PDI-like genes of the second phylogenetic group in vegetative tissues of other
plant species [99]. Moreover, it is interesting the similarity between its expression pattern and that of the gene
encoding the small subunit of the cytosolic AGPase
(ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) of wheat, which was
expressed at high levels early in endosperm development
(6-10 DPA) and then declined steadily until physiological
maturity [105]. Since this enzyme catalyzes the synthesis
of ADPglucose, the precursor of the starch synthesis,
TaPDIL2-1 might participate to the redox regulation of
the cytosolic AGPase in the endosperm of developing
wheat seeds.
Like wheat endosperm, soybean cotyledons contain
large amounts of seed storage proteins such as glycinin
and β-conglycinin, which are synthesized and folded
within the ER during seed development. As previously
discussed, recent studies indicated that at least four
(GmPDIL-1, GmPDIL-2, GmPDIS-1 and GmPDIM) of
the seven characterized soybean proteins of the PDI family would be involved in the folding of storage proteins,
acting both as thiol-oxidoreductase and as a molecular
chaperone [25-28]. The transcripts of GmPDIL-2
remained almost stable during seed development [27],
whereas the mRNA levels of GmPDIL-1, GmPDIS-1 and
GmPDIM were much higher in the very early stage of
seed development, as their orthologous wheat genes
TaPDIL1-1, TaPDIL4-1 and TaPDIL5-1, then declined
steadily from the middle to the late stages of seed development [25-27]. Their transcription rate, however, did
not correlate with the expression level of the encoded
proteins. In fact the amount of the proteins GmPDIL-1,
GmPDIS-1 and GmPDIM were relatively high in the early
stages of seed development and persisted almost at the
same level (GmPDIL-1 and GmPDIM) or increased
(GmPDIS-1) until seed maturation [25-27]. As a matter
of fact, the amount of the three proteins during the late
stages of seed development would be regulated by a posttranscriptional mechanism which would control the differential expression of the PDI proteins. In fact the GmPDIL-1, GmPDIS-1 and GmPDIM proteins persisted at

Page 25 of 29

very high levels during the late stages of seed maturation,
seemingly for their importance in the folding of seed storage proteins, whereas at the same stages GmPDIL-2 and
GmPDIS-2 (paralogous to GmPDIS1) exhibited a low
level of expression. Future studies on the expression levels of wheat PDI and PDI-like proteins during seed development and their comparisons with the levels of the
corresponding transcripts will be important to investigate the mechanisms involved in the temporal regulation
of their encoding genes and to elucidate their role and
importance in the folding of seed storage proteins and
specifically in the formation of high molecular weight
aggregates.

Conclusions
PDI and PDI-like proteins are responsible for multiple
metabolic functions, including secretory protein folding,
chaperone activity and redox signalling. Specific knowledge of their diversified roles has resulted from an
increasing number of studies, most of them involving
mammals, whereas in plants the knowledge on the structural and functional features of this versatile group of
proteins and of their encoding genes is much less extensive. The purpose of our research was the characterization of the genes encoding PDI and PDI like proteins in
wheat and the comparison of their structure and expression with those of homologous genes isolated in other
plant species. Former studies in wheat had been
restricted to the characterization of the genes encoding
the typical PDI, which is of special interest for its involvement in determining the bread making quality and flour
technological properties. The interest of extending the
study to additional members of the PDI gene family is
related to their potentially relevant metabolic functions,
as well as to the knowledge of their molecular evolution
in a polyploid context. Despite the recent data on the
complexity and diversity of the PDI gene family in plants,
there are still a number of unanswered questions concerning cell location and physiological functions of their
protein products. For each of them it will be necessary to
determine whether they have overlapping and redundant
or separate and specific target substrates and whether
they act independently or by interacting with other proteins in a redox chain. In wheat, functional analysis will
be necessary to understand the physiological role of each
gene product of the PDI family, in particular their
involvement in the folding, transport and deposition of
the seed storage proteins. Besides ultrastructural and biochemical studies and the information on the metabolic
role in other plant species of phylogenetically related
genes, the functional analysis will require the selective
silencing of the PDI and PDI-like genes in wheat plants
and the characterization of the regulatory motifs through
the expression studies of the progressive deletions of their

d'Aloisio et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:101
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/101

promoters. The comprehensive structural and expression
characterisation of the complete set of PDI and PDI-like
genes of wheat presented in this study may represent a
basis for the functional characterisation of this gene family in the hexaploid context of bread wheat.
