Abstract
A new isolate of canine distemper virus (CDV), named ZJ7, was isolated from lung tissues of a dog suspected with
CDV infection using MDCK cells. The ZJ7 isolate induced cytopathogenic effects of syncytia in MDCK cell after six
passages. In order to evaluate pathogenesis of ZJ7 strain, three CDV sero-negative dogs were intranasally
inoculated with its virus suspension. All infected dogs developed clinical signs of severe bloody diarrhea,
conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, nasal discharge and coughing, fever and weight loss at 21 dpi, whereas the mock
group infected with DMEM were normal. The results demonstrated that CDV-ZJ7 strain isolated by MDCK cell was
virulent, and the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of strain ZJ7 had no change after isolation by MDCK cell
when compared with the original virus from the fresh tissues. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses for the
nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P) and receptor binding haemagglutinin (H) gene of the ZJ7 isolate clearly
showed it is joins to the Asia 1 group cluster of CDV strains, the predominant genotype in China.

Introduction
Canine distemper (CD) is an acute or subacute, highly
contagious disease with signs of generalized infection
including respiratory disease, foot pad hyperkeratosis,
central nervous system disturbance or a combination of
these symptoms [1]. Its causative agent is a canine distemper virus (CDV) that is an enveloped virus particle
with a diameter of 150 to 300 nm [2], belonging to the
Morbillivirus of Paramyxoviridae family. CDV is actually
a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus (~15.7-kb
RNA genome) and causes a highly infectious, systemic
and fatal disease in the wild and domestic Canidae
[3,4]. The virus replicates primarily in lymphatic tissues
of the respiratory tract. Temporary fever and the onset
of lymphopenia appear after 3 to 6 days infection [5,6].
Generally, an acute infection by CDV is associated with
respiratory or gastrointestinal tract disease or both, and

central nervous system [7]. The genome of CDV
encodes the following virion proteins: nucleocapsid (N),
phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (H), and polymerase (L). H protein is responsible
for viral attachment to host cell and may play a role in
inducting the protective immunity as well [8]. H protein
is also one of the most variable morbillivirus proteins
and thus has been commonly used to assess genetic
changes between CDV isolates [9]. Sequence analyses of
CDV strains have been identified in diverse geographic
areas and various animal species, indicating that H gene
of CDV strains underwent a genetic drift related to the
geographic locations of the circulating strains [10]. Dogs
infected with virulence CDV strains showed obviously
clinical signs of canine distemper including conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, nasal discharge, depression, coughing, diarrhea, lymphopenia, high body temperature and
body weight loss [1]. All infected dogs were diagnosed
with lymphopenia at 5 or 7 dpi, which is the most
important clinical sign to reflect the immunosuppression
[3] and may be affected by apoptosis [11]. Lymphoid
depletion started in the lymph nodes and thymus at 6

dpi without necrosis [5]. However, the lymph node follicles of dogs that naturally infected with CDV have
pathological findings from necrosis to lymphoid depletion [12].
An isolation of CDV strains from tissues by cell culture is difficult because the lipid-enveloped CDV is sensitive to the environment and easily inactive by heat and
light [13]. However, the field isolates of CDV have been
reported to be successfully replicated in macrophages of
dogs and ferrets [14,15]. This attributed to many receptors on macrophages cell surface, such as the signaling
lymphocyte activiation molecule (SLAM), which allows
CDV strains entering the cells. Therefore, the CDV can
be isolated by co-cultivation of lymphocytes from the
suspected dogs and lymphocytes from mitogen-stimulated dogs [16]. Kimoto focused on the Vero cell, modified and unmodified, to isolate the CDV strains [17].
Lednicky et al. demonstrated an effective isolation of the
wild-type CDV strains by MDCK, whose method is
much earlier detecting the virus than others [13]. It was
known that the virulence for natural host could be lost
when the CDV was adapted to the cell culture [18], and
so the isolation of virulence CDV from the suspected
dogs is more difficult [19]. In this study, however, the
virulence CDV had been isolated in MDCK cell from
the infected and clinically sick dogs as early as three
days after inoculation. This is may be because that
MDCK cell is sensitive to the CDV filed strains and so
the CDV strains can be replicated in vitro without selection and/or adaptation in the study. This method is an
effective tool for the research of CD disease and development of CD vaccine candidate. In addition, the geographical lineage(s) of the current China CDV field
strains have also been determined in this study.

Results
Morphology and characteristics of new CDV isolate

A wild-type CDV isolate, named ZJ7, was isolated from
lung tissues of the infected dogs and examined by EM
for testing the presence of virus particles. Canine distemper virus particles with typical morphology were
detected by EM in stools from infected dogs (Figure 1).
A virion of approximate 200-300 nm in diameter was
observed in negative-stain preparations of MDCK cell
inoculated with the ZJ7 isolate. After treated with
FUDR, the CDV-ZJ7 virus titer was one log10 lower
than the untreated virus (Table 1). After treated with
ethylether, acid and heat, the CDV ZJ7 virus titer was
three log10 lower than the untreated group.

then one virus isolate was obtained. This virus isolate
uniformly produced CPE characteristics of CDV strains
after 6 passage (Figure 2A), showing many scattered,
rounded, refractory cells and small syncytia. The presence of CDV isolates in MDCK cell has been confirmed by FITC-labeled CDV N protein-specific
antibody. The specific green signals of FITC were
detected in the infected group, whereas the mock group
had no fluorescence signals (Figure 2D).
Clinical features of the infected dogs

Several clinical symptoms of CD disease have been
shown in three infected dogs compared with three mock
dogs that were infected with DMEM. There was a

The infected dogs exhibited the elevated body temperature up to 40.5°C, and had two peaks of rectal temperature at more than 39.5°C. Ocular discharge and anorexia
occurred in the infected groups between 3 and 4 dpi
(Figure 4A), and they also developed tonsillitis and
coughing. In addition, the infected dogs gradually
became depressed and had rashes, hardened footpads
and bronchitis (Figure 4B and 4C). All infected dogs
developed bloody diarrhea at 4-8 dpi (Figure 4D), and
died at 16-18 dpi.

CDV detection by RT-PCR and virus recovery

CDV in the swabs from the infected dogs were
detected by RT-PCR. The virus was still detected in
conjunctival, nasal and swabs of one dog at 8 dpi and
other dogs at 14 dpi. The virus was also re-isolated
from the swabs of all infected dogs in MDCK cells,
and no CDV were detected in the mock dogs By RTPCR.
Sequencing and phylogenic analyses for N and P genes
of CDV

Figure 5A showed the sequence distances based on the
N gene of ZJ7 isolate among 28 CDV strains obtained
from the GenBank database. The homologies among
ZJ7 isolate and CDV strains of TN, SC01, MS01, NM,
ZD01, GN and HT-P were high with 97.3%-98.6%
identity. The N gene of ZJ7 isolate showed a 93.6%
identity with Japan strain 007Lm, and 91.2% identify
with the classical Onderstepoort vaccine strain. There
was a poor homology of the nucleotide sequence of N
gene among ZJ7, CDV3 and Shuskiy that was isolated
from mink in Republic of Kazakhstan. The lowest
homology of 90.8% was found between ZJ7 isolate and
Phoca/Caspian strains that isolated from seal. Phylogenetic analyses for P gene were also conducted in ZJ7
isolate and others CDV strains (Figure 5B). It was
shown that ZJ7 isolate grouped together in one branch
with Chinese strain HLJ1 and Japan strain (Hamamatsu, Jujo and Yanaka), but in a different branch with
the Japan wild-type strain 007Lm and vaccine strains
obviously.

Analyses for the amino acid sequences of H gene from
wild-type CDV strains

The H gene is a 1824 bp fragment, and encoding a single reading frame of 607 amino acids (Figure 6). The
identity of H gene between ZJ7 and Hamamatsu strains
was 98.6% in nucleotide, and 98.4% with CD TaiChung
in amino acids. Consistent with other compared strains,
12 cystein residues positions on H protein of ZJ7isolate
were predicted by the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server. One major
hydrophobic region (amino acid 35-56) and nine potential glycosylation sites for asparagines (N)-linked glycosylation were at amino acid positions 19-21, 149-151,
309-311, 391-393, 422-424, 456-458, 584-586, 587-589
and 603-605 (Figure 6). This ZJ 7 wild-type strain had
nine N-linked glycosylation sites, which was the same as
the strains in the Asia 1 group, whereas the Asia 2
group only had eight sites.

Discussion
In this study, a new ZJ7 isolate have been isolated from
CV diseased dogs in Jilin province, a recent representative of CDV in China northeast, and the identification
of the isolate have been confirmed by virulence investigation and molecular analysis. 100% identities of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of H and P genes have
been determined between the ZJ7 strain isolated in
MDCK cell and the original virus from infected fresh
tissues (data not show). The results indicated that the
CDV was genetically stable after isolation within a few
passages and the MDCK cell was a suitable cell line to
isolate CDV from fresh tissues. The ZJ7 strain isolated
from several clinical cases were genetically distinct from

the known vaccine strains, as previous studies of other
CDV positive cases with history of CDV vaccination
[19-22].
Many other studies have demonstrated the geographically distinct lineages of CDV strains by phylogenetic
analysis of their H genes [19-23]. To phylogenetic analysis of ZJ7 isolate, we used the Onderstepoort (GenBank
accession no. AF378705), the Snyder Hill (AF259552)
and the TN (AF390348) strains as references of current
China field isolates. A high degree of identity was
detected among all studied China wild-type strains,
which were separated from the vaccine strains from
GenBank. The connected aspartic amide N glycosylation
site potentially is a spotlight in H proteins between vaccine and wild strains of CDV. Usually, there are four
(Onderstepoort strain) or seven (Convac strain) potential sites in the vaccine strains. However, Eight or nine
sites have been detected in all wild CDV strains, of
which 309 ~ 311 N-connected amide asparagine glycosylation sites are specific to CDV field strains [24]. It
was consistent with pathogenic analyses of CDV ZJ7
strain in this study, where eight potential N-connected
amides asparagine glycosylation including 309 ~ 311
have been confirmed in ZJ7 isolate [20]. Some studies
believed that the variants from H protein glycosylation
played a crucial role in the antigenic differences [21]. In
addition, the predicted amino acids of ZJ7 isolate lacked
3 amino acids SKP compared with the Onderstepoort
vaccine strain (Figure 6), but it had difference in 9
amino acids from another China wild-tpye TN strain.
According to the phylogenetic analysis based on H
gene [10,19,25], nine clades of wild-type strains have

reported that three different CDV genotypes (Asia-1,

Arctic, and Asia-3) were currently circulating in China
[19]. The H gene phylogenetic relationships among ZJ7
isolate and other CDV wild-type strains from GenBank
have been clarified in this study. All China isolates form

from Jilin province in 2009, displayed the highest identity to HLJ-10-6strain and can be classified into Asia-1
genotype.

Conclusions
In this study, a CDV ZJ7 strain was successfully isolated
from lung tissues of the dogs suspected with CDV infection using non-modified MDCK cells. The ZJ7 strain
still induced pathogenic effects to the infected dogs after
six passages, whereas the mock group infected with
DMEM is normal. In addition, molecular and phylogenetic analyses of N, P, and H gene on ZJ7 isolate have
clearly indicated its joins to the Asia 1 group cluster of
CDV strains, the predominant genotype in China. In a
word, this new CDV ZJ7 strain isolated by MDCK cell
remains virulent, and its nucleotide and amino acid
sequences are still conservative.

Viruses and clinical specimens

The CDV3 and Onderstepoort vaccine strains used in
this study were maintained in the Division of Zoonoses,
Institute of Special Economic Animal and Plant
Sciences, China. The organs of the infected dogs were
obtained from an animal hospital in Jilin province of
China at 2009. The suspect of CDV infection was initially found by the doctors on the basis of the clinical
signs (fever, respiratory, enteric, and hyperkeratosis
signs).

Materials and methods

Virus isolation and titration

Cell lines and culture

The virus isolation and titration were conducted as
described previously [26]. Briefly, the tissue samples
from the infected dogs were collected from their
necropsies and then stored at -80°C. Homogenates containing 0.2 g of lung samples and 2 mL of Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium with antibiotics were sonicated
and centrifuged. A monolayer of MDCK cell was

Cell line of MDCK (canine epithelial kidney cells) was
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown routinely
in polystyrene tissue culture flasks with filtercaps (Nalge
Nunc International, Rochester, NY) at 37°C in a 5%
humidified CO2 atmosphere. The culture medium was

Tan et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:520
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/520

infected with the homogenates in a 24-well culture plate
for isolation. ZJ7 isolate was titrated in a 10-fold dilution using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)
assay [27] in a 96-well culture plate.
Virus identification by electron microscope (EM) and
immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

Before observing under EM, the MDCK cell infected
with the virus isolates were harvested by freezing and
thawing for three times, and a 1 mL harvested cell culture was centrifuged for 5 min at 800 ×g. The supernatant was then transferred into a new microtube and
centrifuged for 10 min at 13, 400 ×g. A negative stain
was prepared for transmission electron microscope
observation. The observed virions were photographed
and analyzed. As conventional methods [28], the isolated virus were tested by 5-fluoro deoxyuridine
(FUDR), ethylether, acid and high temperature (Table
1). A 96 well microtitre plate (Costar, NY, USA) was
seeded with MDCK cell in MEM with 10% NBCS, and
cultivated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 overnight until 70-80%
confluence. The cultures were then inoculated with 20fold diluted field CDV isolates at 3 passage. The uninfected cultures in left rows of the plate were taken as
the negative controls. After 72 hrs incubation in 37°C,
5% CO 2 atmosphere, the plate was fixed in 80% cold
acetone/PBS, and then washed and incubated with
mAbs at a 50-fold dilution. After washing with PBS,
FITC-conjugated polyclonal antibody (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) was added to the plate, and then followed by
1 h incubation in a 37°C humid box. After 3 times
washes with PBS, a 50% glycerol in PBS was added to
each well. Two infected wells were treated as a positive
control to confirm viral growth. Fluorescence signal was
observed using an fluorescence inverted microscope
(Zeiss Axioskop-40, Germany).
Experimental animals

Six 2-month-old female dogs, whose serology is negative
to CDV, were purchased from Shifang Experiment Animal Corporation (Jiangshu, China) and raised in the isolated cages. All animal work and experimental
procedures were conducted with an approval of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Jinlin University, China.
Virus infection and sample collection

A CDV ZJ7 isolate, which has been directly isolated
from lung tissues of a dog showing pathological changes
consistent with canine distemper at necropsy, was passaged at least five times in MDCK cell before it was
used to form a viral suspension at concentration of 1.2
× 106 TCID 50 /1 mL. Under anesthesia with protocol
(Institute of Special Economic Animal and Plant

Page 7 of 9

Sciences, Jilin, China), the viral suspension was dropped
into the right conjunctiva and nostril of three dogs
using a syringe without a needle. The infection was
monitored daily by clinical and neurological examination
until the dogs were euthanized with Nembutal (Solabio
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., China) at the end of the
experiment. The tissue samples were obtained all
infected dogs. Clinical signs and rectal temperatures of
the dogs were daily recorded. Nasal, tonsilar, conjunctival, rectal and vaginal swabs, which were used for
reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and virus reisolation,
were collected at 0 (before inoculation of virus), 5, 7, 9,
10, 12, 14, 19, 21, 23 and 28 dpi. All samples for isolation were stored at -80°C until being used.
Virus detection and recovery

A suspension containing 40 μl of nasal, tonsilar, conjunctival and vaginal swabs and antibiotics of 1000
units/mL penicillin and 1000 μg/mL streptomycin was
inoculated into MDCK cell seeding in a 24-well culture
plate. The cytopathogenic effect was observed by phase
contrast microscopy. The presence of CDV was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR with a specific CDV
N gene primers: Upper: 5’ GATAAAGCATGTCATTATAGTCCTAA 3’ and Lower: 5’CTTGAGCTTTCGACCCTTC 3’, and the expected fragment was 335 bp.
Briefly, all RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy kit
(QIAGEN). The extracted RNA was immediately used
for RT-PCR or preserved at - 80°C before use. cDNA
synthesis was performed with SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligodeoxy nucleotide primers by 10 mL of RNA sample and random primers as
reverse transcription primer. The PCR amplification of
cDNA was carried out in a 50 mL solution containing
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2,
0.5 mM dNTP and 200 pmol of each primer accordingly. The internal gene sequences of primers, 5mL
cDNA and 2.5U EXTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) were
given in the Table 1. The PCR amplification cycle was
optimized as follows: 94°C 45s, 52.2°C 45s and 72°C 45s,
for 35 cycles with a final extension step at 72°C for 5
min.
Titration of VNA against CDV

For the neutralization assay, the antibody titre was measured in a 96-well culture microplate in Vero cells [29].
Quadruplicate 0.05 mL serum was diluted 3-fold serially,
and a 0.05 ml CDV solution with 10 TCID 50 of the
onderstepoort strain was added to each well, and then
the plate was incubated for 90 min at 37°C. Subsequently, the Vero cells at concentration of 1.2 × 10 4
/0.05 mL were added to the serum-virus mixtures, and
incubated for 7 days at 37°C, CO2. The plate was examined microscopically, and the titre was expressed as the

dilution without serum was used as negative control.
The titre was calculated by the Reed and Munch
method [30].
Phylogenetic analyses for nucleotide and amino acid
sequences

N, P and H gene sequences of ZJ7 isolate were amplified
by PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene),
and the primers we used in Table 2. To confirm the
occurrence of the target gene sequence, the amplified
segments were cloned into the pMD18-T vector
(TaKaRa) and sequenced at Shanghai Yingjun Biotechnological Co. Ltd (Invitrogen, Beijing, China). The
nucleotide was sequenced by a commercial company
and was sent to GenBank, in which the accession numbers for N, P and H were JF343964, JF343963 and
JF343962 respectively. The N and P gene nucleotide
were sequenced from the ZJ7 isolate and then aligned
with the corresponding sequences of CDV strains using
the Clustal W program in MegAlign of Lasergene 7.2
software (DNASTAR Inc. Madison, WI, USA). Then,
the phylogenetic and molecular analyses were conducted
using MEGA version 5 [31]. The nucleotide sequence
and phylogenetic analysis were also carried out in N, P
and H genes of the original homogenated tissue and ZJ7
isolate.
