Abstract
Background: Nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) are trace elements required for a variety of biological
processes. Ni is directly coordinated by proteins, whereas Co is mainly used as a component of
vitamin B12. Although a number of Ni and Co-dependent enzymes have been characterized,
systematic evolutionary analyses of utilization of these metals are limited.
Results: We carried out comparative genomic analyses to examine occurrence and evolutionary
dynamics of the use of Ni and Co at the level of (i) transport systems, and (ii) metalloproteomes.
Our data show that both metals are widely used in bacteria and archaea. Cbi/NikMNQO is the
most common prokaryotic Ni/Co transporter, while Ni-dependent urease and Ni-Fe hydrogenase,
and B12-dependent methionine synthase (MetH), ribonucleotide reductase and methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase are the most widespread metalloproteins for Ni and Co, respectively. Occurrence of other
metalloenzymes showed a mosaic distribution and a new B12-dependent protein family was
predicted. Deltaproteobacteria and Methanosarcina generally have larger Ni- and Co-dependent
proteomes. On the other hand, utilization of these two metals is limited in eukaryotes, and very
few of these organisms utilize both of them. The Ni-utilizing eukaryotes are mostly fungi (except
saccharomycotina) and plants, whereas most B12-utilizing organisms are animals. The NiCoT
transporter family is the most widespread eukaryotic Ni transporter, and eukaryotic urease and
MetH are the most common Ni- and B12-dependent enzymes, respectively. Finally, investigation of
environmental and other conditions and identity of organisms that show dependence on Ni or Co
revealed that host-associated organisms (particularly obligate intracellular parasites and
endosymbionts) have a tendency for loss of Ni/Co utilization.
Conclusion: Our data provide information on the evolutionary dynamics of Ni and Co utilization
and highlight widespread use of these metals in the three domains of life, yet only a limited number
of user proteins.

Background
Life is dependent on a number of chemical elements.
Besides common elements, several trace elements are utilized, including certain metals and metalloids. Because
these elements play important roles in cellular metabolism,
efficient mechanisms of uptake, storage and utilization are
required for many of them. Among biometals, nickel (Ni)
and cobalt (Co) are utilized at particularly low levels but
play important roles in several biological systems.
Ni is an essential component of several metalloenzymes
involved in energy and nitrogen metabolism [1,2]. In
prokaryotes, the major Ni-binding enzymes include urease,
Ni-Fe hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (NiCODH), acetyl-coenzyme A decarbonylase/synthase ([4Fe4S]-Ni-Ni CODH/ACS), superoxide dismutase SodN,
methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), glyoxalase I (GlxI,
binds Ni in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Neisseria meningitidis, but zinc in P. putida, human and
yeast) [3-6], a putative cis-trans isomerase in E. coli [7] and
several other proteins [2]. In eukaryotes, urease is the only
characterized Ni-dependent enzyme [8]. Additional candidate Ni-containing proteins or compounds have also been
described in different organisms including humans [9].
Co is mainly found in the corrin ring of vitamin B12 (also
known as cobalamin), a group of closely related polypyrrole compounds such as cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin and deoxyadenosyl cobalamin [10-12]. The
biochemistry of B12 in enzymes is well characterized [1012]. Vitamin B12 is a complex organometallic cofactor and
is mainly present in three classes of enzymes in prokaryotes (classified based on different chemical features of the
cofactor): adenosylcobalamin-dependent isomerase,
methylcobalamin-dependent methyltransferase, and B12dependent reductive dehalogenase [12]. These classes can
be further divided into subclasses based on sequence similarity and reactions they catalyze, including methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), isobutyryl-CoA mutase (ICM),
B12-dependent mutase MeaA (with sequence similarity to
MCM and ICM), glutamate mutase (GM), methyleneglutarate mutase (MGM), D-lysine 5,6-aminomutase (5,6LAM), B12-dependent ribonucleotide reductase (RNR II),
diol dehydratase (DDH), ethanolamine ammonia lyase
(EAL), B12-dependent methionine synthase (MetH), a
variety of B12-dependent methyltransferases (such as Mta,
Mtm, Mtb, Mtt, Mts, Mtv and Mtr) and reductive dehalogenases CprA and PceA [12-18]. Whereas many prokaryotes synthesize B12 via aerobic or anaerobic biosynthetic
pathways [11], other organisms, which lack the ability to
synthesize B12, are dependent on vitamin uptake from the
environment. In eukaryotes, only three B12-dependent
enzymes, MetH, MCM and RNR II, have been identified
[19,20], and all are dependent on externally supplied vitamin B12. Besides, a few proteins containing non-corrin Co
were reported, such as methionine aminopeptidase from

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

Salmonella typhimurium, prolidase from Pyrococcus furiosus
and nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous [10].
However, most of these proteins are not strictly Co-specific and may also use other metals (such as iron, zinc and
manganese) in place of Co [10,21,22]. Among them, only
nitrile hydratase (NHase) was previously suggested to
have different active site motifs for cobalt- and iron-binding forms [23,24].
Biosynthesis of Ni and Co enzymes is dependent on highaffinity uptake of metal ions from natural environments. In
microorganisms, Ni and Co uptake is mediated by ATPbinding cassette (ABC) systems and several secondary
transporters [25,26]. The well-studied ABC-type Ni transporter system, NikABCDE, belongs to a large family of ABC
transporters (peptide/nickel transporter family). It is composed of a periplasmic binding protein (NikA), two integral
membrane proteins (NikB and NikC) and two ABC proteins (NikD and NikE, [27]). The expression of nikABCDE
is negatively regulated by the NikR repressor [28]. Distantly
related Ni ABC transporters were also identified in the Yersinia species (YntABCDE, [29]). An additional system, Cbi/
NikMNQO, is often encoded next to the B12 biosynthesis or
urease genes in bacterial genomes [30-33]. It was shown to
mediate Co and Ni uptake, respectively [30,31].
Secondary Ni/Co transporters include: (a) NiCoT (also designated HoxN, HupN, NicT, NixA or NhlF in different organisms), a family of prokaryotic and fungal membrane
proteins with an eight-transmembrane-segment structure
[34-36], (b) UreH [26] and (c) HupE/UreJ [26,37]. NiCoTs
are widespread among bacteria and found in several thermoacidophilic archaea and certain fungi including Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Neurospora crassa [26,36,38]. Subtypes
of various NiCoTs have different ion preferences ranging
from strict selectivity for Ni to unbiased transport of both
ions to strong preference for Co. In many cases, the preference for a particular metal correlated with the genomic location of NiCoT genes, which are adjacent to genes for Ni or Co
(or B12 biosynthesis) enzymes [31,34-36]. The other two
families (UreH and HupE/UreJ) are putative secondary
transporters, and certain members of these families have
recently been shown to mediate Ni transport [26,37,39].
Homologs of UreH also occur in plants [26]. Recently, several new types of candidate cobalt transporters were predicted, including CbtAB, CbtC, CbtD, CbtE, CbtF, CbtG and
CbtX [31,40]. The distribution of these candidates is limited.
In eukaryotes, a subfamily of cation-efflux family members
(TgMTP1) was found to account for the enhanced ability of
Ni hyperaccumulation in higher plants [41,42]. Although
no Co-specific transport system was reported in eukaryotes,
some suppressors of Co toxicity, such as COT1 and GRR1 in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were characterized, which have a
role in decreasing the cytoplasmic concentration of metal
ions (including cobalt and zinc). They were proposed to play
an important role in metal homeostasis [10].

Vitamin B12 uptake is essential for B12-utilizing organisms,
which lack the ability to synthesize the coenzyme de novo,
and the only known transport system for B12 in prokaryotes is BtuFCD [43]. Since this ABC transport system
belongs to the same family as the ABC systems involved in
the uptake of iron, siderophores and heme [44], it is difficult to distinguish the B12-specific transporters from other
homologous transporters, especially in distantly related
species. In mammals, B12 delivery from food to tissues
involves at least three successive transport proteins and
their cell-surface receptors: haptocorrin in saliva, intrinsic
factor in the proximal ileum and the transcobalamin II in
vascular endothelium [45]. Transcobalamin-B12 is then
released to the plasma and enters cells by endocytosis via
certain receptors [46]. However, the mechanism of B12
uptake in other eukaryotes, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and nematodes, is unclear.
While a variety of metal transport systems and metalloproteomes have been characterized, the full details of utilization of Ni and Co/B12 are not clear. Comprehensive
analyses of both transporters and proteins that bind these
metals are essential for better understanding of their
homeostasis and its changes during evolution. Recently, a
comparative and functional genomic analysis of prokaryotic Ni and Co transporters in 200 microbial genomes
showed a mosaic utilization of both metals [47]. A separate analysis of B12 metabolism and regulation provided
information on B12 utilization in prokaryotes [31].
In this report, we used comparative genomics approaches to
better understand Ni and Co uptake in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, and consequently utilization of these trace elements. Considering that members of most non-corrin Cobinding proteins may bind other metal cofactors instead of
Co, we only focused on the utilization of the corrin form of
Co (vitamin B12), whose utilization could be predicted on
the basis of B12 biosynthesis pathway and B12-dependent
protein families. Over 740 organisms in all three domains of
life were examined. Our results show a widespread utilization of both metals in prokaryotes and their limited use in
eukaryotes, and reveal that utilization of Ni and Co may be
influenced by environmental or other factors. These studies
also provide insights into understanding the evolution of
metal utilization traits and metalloenzymes.

Results
Occurrence of nickel and cobalt utilization in prokaryotes
and eukaryotes
Analysis of prokaryotic genomes revealed a wide distribution of genes encoding Ni and Co transporters as well as
Ni- and Co-dependent proteins [see Additional files 1 and
2]. Table 1 shows the general distribution of both utilization traits in the three domains of life. This analysis was
carried out by detecting known metalloproteins, metal
transporters and cofactor biosynthesis pathways, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

where possible, calls were based on multiple evidences. It
should be noted, however, that these approaches may
occasionally be insufficient to assign a function with complete confidence. For example, it cannot be excluded that
some genes said to be associated with Ni or Co utilization
may prove to have a different metal specificity or may not
be functional. Therefore, our analysis is consistent with
the current knowledge of Ni and Co pathways.
Among bacteria, 319 Ni-utilizing and 410 Co-utilizing
organisms (59.1% and 75.9% of sequenced bacterial species, respectively) were identified, including 287 organisms (53.1%) that utilized both metals. In contrast, 98
organisms (18.1%) had neither Ni/Co transporters nor
corresponding metalloenzymes and appeared to lack the
ability to use either of the two trace elements. Only half of
Co-utilizing organisms (209 out of 410) possessed the
B12 biosynthetic pathway. The other half likely acquires
external B12 via the vitamin uptake systems. Investigation
of the occurrence of homologs of the BtuFCD transport
system in these B12-uptaking organisms showed that
more than 90% of them had BtuFCD homologs, implying
that essentially all of these organisms may use a BtuFCD
system for B12 uptake [see Additional file 1]. The remaining 10% B12-uptaking organisms, such as Nitrosomonas
europaea and Xanthomonas axonopodis, appeared to
lack BtuFCD transporters, suggesting the presence of additional B12 transport systems in these organisms. A small
number of organisms which had either Ni-dependent proteins (but lacked both Ni transporters and transporters
with unassigned function) or Ni transporters (but lacked
known Ni-dependent proteins) were found among bacteria (62 and 10 organisms, respectively, Table 1). A similar
situation was also observed in 13 B12-synthesizing species that lacked both Co transporters and transporters
with unassigned function. Therefore, our data suggest that
dual-function Ni/Co transporters (i.e., some predicted Nispecific transporters may also be involved in Co uptake),
additional Ni- and Co-specific transporters, multifunctional metal transporters (e.g., magnesium/nickel/cobalt
transport system) and/or novel metalloproteins may be
present in a small number of analyzed organisms. Alternatively, metal acquisition might occur nonspecifically in
some of these organisms using cation influx systems.
Except for phyla represented by few sequenced organisms
(<3), Ni and Co utilization traits were detected in nearly
all bacterial phyla (Fig. 1). Neither Ni- nor Co-utilizing
organisms were found among the Chlamydiae and Alphaproteobacteria/Rickettsiales. Essentially all organisms in
the two phyla are obligate intracellular parasites and have
small genome size (<1.5 Mbp). In addition, most organisms in the Firmicutes/Mollicutes (88.2%) and Spirochaetes
(62.5%), which are extracellular parasites with small
genomes, also lost the ability to use both metals. Thus, it
appears that parasitic lifestyle may result in the loss of utiPage 3 of 26

lization of both metals. Co utilization appeared to be
more widely distributed than that of Ni. It is present in
90% Ni-utilizing organisms and in some phyla, such as
the Spirochaetes and Thermotogae, which lack Ni utilization. However, the fact that Ni utilization is found in all
sequenced Epsilonproteobacteria, which rarely use Co, suggests a mostly independent relationship between the two
metal utilization traits. Nevertheless, significant overlap
between the two traits observed in bacteria suggests that
they may be related in some way, for example, common
or similar transporter systems may be involved.
Similar but even wider Ni/Co utilization was observed in
sequenced archaea (Fig. 2 and [Additional file 2]). 45 and
39 archaeal species were found to utilize Co and Ni,
respectively. A total of 38 organisms use both metals,
including all 18 sequenced methanogenic archaea.
Approximately 75% of Co-utilizing archaea possessed the
B12 biosynthetic pathway (Table 1). Overall, it appears
that utilization of both Ni and Co represent ancient traits
which have been and remain common to most prokaryotes.
In contrast to prokaryotes, only 51 Ni-utilizing and 49
B12-utilizing organisms were identified in eukaryotes
(31.9% and 30.6% of sequenced eukaryotic genomes,
respectively). Among them, 9 organisms (belonging to the
Stramenopiles, Viridiplantae/Chlorophyta and Metazoa/Coelomata/Others) use both trace elements (Fig. 3 and [Additional file 3]). On the other hand, almost half of analyzed

eukaryotic organisms appeared to lack the ability to use
either Ni or B12, including insects (Metazoa/Coelomata/
Arthropoda), saccharomycotina and most unicellular parasites. The fact that no organism contained orphan Ni
transporter and that more than 96% of Ni-utilizing
eukaryotes possessed both known Ni transporters and
urease (the only known Ni-dependent enzyme in eukaryotes) strongly suggested excellent correspondence
between the occurrence of the Ni uptake system and Nidependent proteins in eukaryotes. Although the mechanism of B12 uptake is unclear in eukaryotes excluding
mammals, we could examine B12 utilization by analyzing
the occurrence of B12-dependent enzymes. It is interesting
that most Ni-utilizing eukaryotes were fungi (including
the Ascomycota/Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota/Schizosaccharomycetes and Basidiomycota subdivisions) and plants, and
that most B12-utilizing organisms were animals (except
insects) which lack the ability to use Ni (Fig. 3). The data
suggest that the majority of lower eukaryotes lost the Co
(or more precisely, B12) utilization trait whereas higher
eukaryotes lost the Ni utilization trait. Although less
likely, an alternative hypothesis is that the Co utilization
trait was independently acquired by some ancient eukaryotes, for example, the ancestor of all animals, and then
lost by certain groups such as arthropoda.
Distribution of Ni and Co transporters in prokaryotes
We analyzed all well-characterized Ni/Co transport systems in prokaryotes [26,31,40,47]. Members of these

fied by homology searches and the function of each protein was predicted based on genome context (see
Methods). Orthologs of these transporters showed a
mosaic distribution in bacteria. A summary of the distribution of these Ni/Co transporters in bacteria is shown in
Table 2. Considering that many transporters do not have
clear substrate preference (either Ni or Co or both), our
analyses focused on predicted Ni- or Co-specific transporters. Although some transporters with unassigned
function were clustered with multiple predicted Ni- or Cospecific transporters in phylogenetic trees, we considered
them as being of unclear function.
Cbi/NikMNQO transporter is the most widespread transport system for Ni and Co uptake in bacteria, which is
consistent with previous observations [47]. These modular transporters belong to a novel class of ATP-dependent
transporters (named energy-coupling factor or ECF transporters) that use membrane proteins to capture substrate
[48]. Comparison of subunits of Cbi/NikMNQO systems
in different organisms revealed that M, Q and O are universal components and are present in almost all predicted
transport systems. No significant similarity was detected
between NikN and CbiN, although they have similar
topology (two transmembrane domains, [47]). It is
known that two additional components, NikK and NikL,
are involved in Ni uptake in the absence of NikN, which

form the NikKMLQO system [see Additional file 4]. Phylogenetic analyses of all these components are shown [see
Additional files 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In general, except for
CbiO/NikO, all components showed separate Ni- and/or
Co-related branches although the function of some members of these components was unclear. Almost all CbiN
proteins contained the same domain (COG1930, CbiN)
and had similar sequences (e-value < 0.1 based on
BL2SEQ pairwise alignment). In contrast, more sequence
diversity was observed for NikN, NikK and NikL proteins.
Sometimes, multiple distant homologs were present in
the same organism (e.g., Desulfotalea psychrophila and Desulfovibrio vulgaris contained two distantly related
sequences of both NikK and NikL). Here, we divided
NikN, NikK and NikL into different groups based on
sequence similarity and phylogenetic analyses. Three
types of NikN (named N1–N3), two of NikL (L1, L2) and
three of NikK (K1–K3) were identified in bacteria. Distribution of different types of these components is shown
[see Additional file 12]. Approximately 90% NikL1 cooccurred with NikK1 (the other 10% co-occurred with
NikK2 or NikK3), whereas NikL2 only co-occurred with
NikK2 or NikK3. Interestingly, in five proteobacteria
(most are alpha- and gammaproteobacteria), such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Shewanella sediminis, operons for
NikK1ML1QO orthologs were found to be adjacent to B12
biosynthesis genes or were preceded by B12-dependent

Occurrence of nickel and cobalt utilization traits in eukaryotes
Occurrence of nickel and cobalt utilization traits in eukaryotes. Phyla in which none of the organisms use Ni or Co

shown in red (if containing at least 3 organisms, shown in bold).

riboswitch elements [49], implying that they are involved
in Co uptake in these organisms. Phylogenies of all components showed a relatively small branch for these evolutionarily distant organisms [see Additional file 5 and
Additional files 8, 9, 10, 11] although each component
belonged to a large Ni-related group. These observations
suggest that the Co uptake function recently evolved for
NikK1ML1QO system in these organisms. However, it is
not clear whether they are still involved in Ni uptake.
Orphan NikK and/or NikL orthologs were also observed
in several organisms which lack NikMQO but contain Nidependent proteins, or even lack Ni utilization (see Additional files 1, 10 and 11]. We checked their gene neighborhoods and could not find proteins directly implicating
their function. Thus, they may be involved in Ni-independent pathways. In several organisms where no NikQ

could be detected, a hypothetical transporter component
(5 transmembrane domains, similar topology as NikQ
but no sequence similarity) was always found encoded
next to nikO. Orthologs of this hypothetical transmembrane protein were only detected in six sequenced organisms and most of them were predicted to be involved in
Ni uptake [see Additional file 13], suggesting that novel
Ni-related transporter component evolved in organisms
lacking NikQ. In addition, different NikMs in NikMNQO
or NikKMLQO system clustered in separate branches [see
Additional file 5], indicating that the evolutionary process
of NikM correlates with the usage of N or K+L components. However, no correlation was observed for NikM
based on different subtypes of NikN, NikK and NikL components. Similarly, phylogeny of the core transporter
components Q and O did not show significant similarity

to that of M, N, K or L component. It should be noted that
no organism that contained both NikMNQO and NikKMLQO was detected, indicating a complementary or mutually exclusive relationship between these two systems.
Two other transporter families, HupE/UreJ and NiCoT,
were also found to be frequently used in bacteria (Table
2). The HupE/UreJ transporter family is widely utilized in
the Cyanobacteria and various proteobacterial subdivisions except for the Deltaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of all collected members of
this transporter family showed two separate branches of
predicted Ni- and Co-specific subgroups although there
were still several members with unassigned function in
each branch [see Additional file 14]. The NiCoT family
was detected in diverse taxonomic groups of bacteria.
Compared to HupE/UreJ, NiCoT showed much more
complex functional diversity and predicted Ni- and Cospecific transporters were scattered in various branches of
the phylogenetic tree [see Additional file 15].
ABC transporter systems are typically major and the most
active transporters of organic compounds and metals,
such as zinc, manganese, amino acids and peptides. In our
study, only a fraction of organisms were predicted to possess the NikABCDE system, including distant Ni ABC-type
transporters identified in Yersinia species, YntABCDE
[29]. Besides genomic context, we attempted to utilize residues which may be involved in Ni-binding (see Methods
for details) to distinguish NikABCDE from homologous
peptide import systems. Multiple alignment of NikA
sequences and other homologs showed that most of the
residues proposed to be involved in Ni-NikA interaction
are conserved in predicted NikA proteins but absent in
other homologs [see Additional file 16]. Except for members of the NikABCDE family in Clostridium tetani and
Desulfitobacterium hafniense, which were previously predicted to be preceded by a B12-dependent riboswitch element [47], all NikA orthologs appeared to be Ni-specific
[see Additional file 17]. Although YntA (the periplasmic
Ni-binding component in the YntABCDE system) is evolutionarily distant from NikA, and it is still unclear how
YntA binds Ni, gene neighborhoods could be used to
identify this distant Ni ABC-type transporter family.
In addition, only 20 organisms possessed orthologs of the
UreH transporter. This family was previously predicted to
be Ni-specific because these genes were always located
adjacent to the genes for Ni-dependent enzymes, such as
urease, Ni-Fe hydrogenase and SodN [26,47]. There have
been no reports that showed that UreH may also be
involved in Co uptake. Here, we found that a member of
the UreH family is adjacent to several B12 biosynthesis
genes (such as CbiD and CobB), in a gammaproteobacterium, Moritella sp. PE36, suggesting that UreH is involved
in Co uptake in this organism [see Additional file 18].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

Besides the above well-characterized Ni/Co transporter
families, several recently predicted Co transporters,
including CbtAB, CbtC-CbtG and CbtX [31,40], were
detected in 87 species, mostly in the Proteobacteria and
Actinobacteria (Table 2). Essentially all of these organisms
possessed the B12 biosynthetic pathway and many lacked
known Co transporters.
In E. coli, the nickel repressor gene nikR is positioned
immediately next to its target, the nikABCDE operon.
NikR-dependent regulation was also predicted for other
Ni transporters, such as NikMNQO and Ni-specific
NiCoT, and Ni-dependent enzymes such as Ni-Fe hydrogenase [47]. In this study, NikR was found in less than half
of the organisms containing NikABCDE, suggesting the
presence of NikR-independent regulation of the NikABCDE system [see Additional files 1 and 19]). Here, the
occurrence of NikR was used to supplement the searches
for Ni-related transporters.
Only three Ni/Co transporter families were detected in
archaea: Nik/CbiMNQO, NikABCDE, and NiCoT (Table
3). As in bacteria, Nik/CbiMNQO was the most widespread transporter system. Compared to variations in the
bacterial NikMNQO and NikKMLQO systems, only
NikMN1QO and NikMN2QO were detected in archaea.
In contrast, the distribution of the other two transporters
was not very pronounced and most NiCoT transporters
did not show clear function. In the case of other predicted
Co transporters, only CbtX was detected, in 7 archaeal
species.
Occurrence of Ni-dependent enzymes, B12 biosynthetic
pathway and B12-dependent enzymes in prokaryotes
Among bacterial Ni-dependent enzymes, urease (catalyzes
the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia)
and Ni-Fe hydrogenase (catalyzes hydrogen evolution and
uptake; it includes Ni-Fe hydrogenase I (COG0374, HyaB),
Ni-Fe hydrogenase III (COG3261, HycE) and F420-reducing hydrogenase (COG3259, FrhA)) were the two most
widespread families (Table 4). In the analyzed dataset, 185
organisms (58.0% of Ni-utilizing bacteria) possessed urease and 168 (52.7%) Ni-Fe hydrogenase. Occurrence of
other Ni-dependent proteins was limited and mosaic
(Table 4). For example, CODH/ACS, a key enzyme in the
Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of anaerobic CO(2) fixation
[50], was identified only in 11 organisms belonging to the
Firmicutes/Clostridia, Chloroflexi and Deltaproteobacteria,
whereas SodN was detected in 21 organisms in the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and some Gammaproteobacteria. As mentioned above (Table 1), 10 organisms
containing Ni-specific transporters (mostly NikABCDE)
lacked known Ni-dependent proteins. We examined the
genes adjacent to the predicted transporter genes in these
organisms, but did not find good candidates for Nidependent proteins. It is possible that these organisms posPage 9 of 26

sess additional Ni users which are not strictly Ni-dependent
such as GlxI. We found that all these organisms containing
orphan Ni transporters also contain GlxI proteins, although
it is unclear which of these proteins bind Ni. Although
incorrect functional assignment of some transporters (e.g.,
a predicted Ni-specific transporter may be involved in Co or
peptide import) cannot be excluded, misassignment of
function should be not significant.
In archaea, the occurrence of these enzymes was different
(Table 5). Ni-Fe hydrogenase was the most widespread
protein, whereas urease was the least utilized one. SodN
was not detected in archaea. In addition, the archaea-specific Ni-binding enzyme, MCR, a protein that contains a
noncovalently bound Ni tetrapyrrolic cofactor (coenzyme
F430) and catalyzes the final step in the biological synthesis of methane in methanogenic archaea [51], was found
in all sequenced methanogens. It has been reported that
MCR homologs (bind a modified F430) in some not yet
cultured methanotrophic archaea (ANME) are involved in
the anaerobic oxidation of methane in marine sediments
[52].
We also analyzed the B12 biosynthetic pathway in prokaryotes. By identifying key genes involved in B12 biosynthesis
(see Methods), half of B12-utilizing bacteria were predicted to synthesize B12 and all of them contained at least
one known B12-dependent enzyme [see Additional file

20]. The other half of B12-utilizing bacteria lacked the
complete B12 biosynthetic pathway and, therefore, must
be using external B12 via specific uptake systems, such as
BtuFCD whose homologs were detected in over 90% of
these organisms (see above). It was previously reported
that about one-fourth of B12-utilizing bacteria lack the
ability to synthesize B12 [31]. Our analysis shows that as
the number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes increases,
many additional organisms lacking B12 biosynthesis will
be identified.
In order to study further the Co/B12 utilization in prokaryotes, we examined the occurrence of all known B12dependent enzymes as means of assessing Co utilization
in organisms [see Additional file 20]. Except for MGM,
which was previously found in an unsequenced bacterium
Eubacterium barkeri [53], all known B12-dependent proteins were detected, the most common being MetH (372
organisms), B12-dependent RNR II (227 organisms) and
MCM (including ICM and MeaA, 212 organisms). Other
proteins, including GM, 5,6-LAM, DDH, MtrA and CprA,
were found only in 2 through 26 organisms.
Surprisingly, some B12-utilizing organisms had an
extremely large number of B12-dependent proteins, e.g., 7
MCM members in Nocardioides sp. JS614, 7 CprAs and 15
different B12-dependent methyltransferases in D. hafniense
DCB-2, 19 CprAs in Dehalococcoides ethenogenes and 32

CprAs in Dehalococcoides sp. CBDB1 [see Additional file 1].
Our results are consistent with previous findings which
implicated these homologous enzymes in various B12dependent metabolic processes [54].
We also identified 31 bacteria containing Co-binding
NHases [see Additional file 20] based on the presence of
Co-binding motif (CTLCSCY, [23]). All of them are B12utilizing organisms and most only have single copies of
NHase [see Additional file 1]. Besides, iron-containing
NHases (containing CSLCSCT sequence motif, [23]) were
predicted in four organisms that belong to the Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria/Burkholderiaceae and Gammaproteobacteria/Others. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these
iron-containing NHases form a separate subbranch, suggesting that they might be newly evolved from Co-binding NHases [see Additional file 21].
In archaea, three-fourths of the sequenced B12-utilizing
organisms (including all methanogens) synthesize B12
(Table 6). However, more than half of bacterial B12dependent protein families were absent in archaea,
including MetH, 5,6-LAM, DDH, EAL and CprA. B12dependent RNR II was the most widespread B12-binding

enzyme being present in 33 archaeal species. In addition,
a variety of B12-dependent methyltransferases were found
in archaea, most of which were present in methanogens.
The Methanosarcina species possessed an exceptionally
large number of B12-dependent methyltransferases,
including MtaABC, MtmABC, MtbABC, MttABC, MtsABC
and MtrAB (e.g., totally 15 methyltransferases in M. acetivorans and 12 in M. mazei). The presence of multiple B12dependent methyltransferases involved in different pathways is clearly important for these organisms. No Cobinding NHase could be detected in archaea.
Prediction of a novel B12-dependent protein family in
prokaryotes
Through our analysis, a novel B12-dependent protein family was predicted in prokaryotes. Orthologs of this protein
were detected in 11 sequenced bacteria belonging to four
evolutionarily distant phyla (Firmicutes/Clostridia, Firmicutes/Lactobacillales, Chloroflexi and Thermotogae). A distant
homolog of the B12-binding domain (COG5012, found
in MetH and other methyltransferases) was detected in its
N terminus (Fig. 4). Structure prediction using HHpred
[55] suggested that the N-terminus may contain a TIMbarrel-like structure involved in B12 binding (data not

shown). Analysis of genome context of this putative B12dependent protein showed that it is always adjacent to
NAD/NADP
octopine/nopaline
dehydrogenase
(pfam02317), which acts on the CH-NH substrate bond
using NAD(+) or NADP(+) as an acceptor. Additional
enzyme candidates included D-alanine:D-alanine ligase
and asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing), which
were located in the vicinity of the gene for the novel B12dependent protein in several organisms. Further experiments are needed to confirm their dependence on B12.
Occurrence of Ni transporters, urease and B12-dependent
proteins in eukaryotes
Distribution of Ni transporters, urease and B12-dependent
enzymes in eukaryotes is shown in Table 7. Except for two
marine animals, Aplysia californica (sea slug) and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (sea urchin), which contain an orphan
urease, all Ni-utilizing eukaryotes contained at least one
known Ni transporter and urease. However, analysis of the

distribution of Ni transporters in different eukaryotic phyla
showed high diversity of these proteins. NiCoT was only
present in fungi (except for yeasts), whereas UreH was
detected in plants (Viridiplantae/Chlorophyta and Viridiplantae/Streptophyta) and stramenopiles, and TgMTP1 was only
present in land plants (Viridiplantae/Streptophyta). All B12utilizing eukaryotes contained MetH. Except for the Alveolata/Perkinsea and Viridiplantae/Chlorophyta, all organisms
also possessed MCM. RNR II was only found in Dictyostelium discoideum (Dictyosteliida) and three phytophthora species (Stramenopiles) and lost in fungi and animals.
Evolutionary model of Ni and Co utilization
Based on the results shown above, it is possible to infer a
general model of Ni and Co utilization in the three
domains of life. Considering that the common property
of various Ni- or Co-dependent proteins is to catalyze
important reactions in the global carbon, hydrogen and
nitrogen cycles, it is not surprising that both trace elePage 13 of 26

ments are essential for the majority of organisms. However, some organisms and even complete phyla/clades
may have evolved alternative mechanisms for such reactions and are characterized by the loss of both transport
systems and metalloenzymes.
Out of the five known Ni/Co transport systems in prokaryotes, only NiCoT family spans all three domains of life. If a
protein family has many representatives in all domains of
life and they cluster within their domains, it is thought that
the family was present in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA [56,57]. We speculate that NiCoT evolved in the
common ancestor of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. In
addition, in spite of low occurrence, the presence of UreH
transporter in several phyla of both bacteria and eukaryotes
indicates that this family either could have been present in
the last universal common ancestor but then lost in archaea,
or evolved in early bacteria and was then acquired by the
ancestor of eukaryotes through evolution of mitochondria.
Phylogenetic analysis of UreH proteins suggested that the
LUCA origin is more likely because the eukaryotic branch
attaches near the bacterial root [see Additional file 18]. The
B12 biosynthetic pathway may have evolved only in prokaryotes or has been lost in eukaryotes. In most prokaryotic
phyla, organisms retained Ni and/or Co utilization traits. A
complete loss of both Ni and Co utilization was only
observed in two phyla, Chlamydiae and Alphaproteobacteria/
Rickettsiales. We noticed that their sister phyla (such as the
Rhizobiaceae and other Alphaproteobacteria for the Rickettsiales) commonly utilize both traits, suggesting that the loss
of Ni and Co utilization happened independently in the two
divisions. Considering that essentially all sequenced organisms in the two phyla were obligate intracellular parasites, it
is possible that both metals are not necessary for these organisms. However, the possibility that they exploit Ni/Co-binding proteins of the host cannot be excluded.
Further analyses of the Ni- or Co-dependent metalloproteomes (i.e., sets of Ni- and Co(B12)-dependent enzymes)
in different phyla provided us with an opportunity to
explore the evolution of these metalloproteomes (Fig. 5, 6,
7). Normalized occurrence of these metalloproteins is
shown [see Additional files 22 and 23]. There is no correlation between the number of Ni- or Co-dependent enzymes
and the genome/proteome size (data not shown). In most
bacteria, the size of the Ni-dependent metalloproteome
was 1–4 (Fig. 5). Most of these proteins were ureases or NiFe hydrogenases. However, half of sequenced Deltaproteobacteria appeared to have a larger Ni-dependent metalloproteome (≥ 5), including deltaproteobacterium MLMS-1,
which possessed the largest Ni-dependent metalloproteome (16 Ni-binding proteins, half of which were Ni-Fe
hydrogenases). Similarly, compared to most Co-utilizing
species which had 1–4 Co-dependent metalloenzymes, the
majority of organisms in some phyla, such as the Chloroflexi

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

(including two Dehalococcoides species which have the largest number of B12-binding proteins in prokaryotes), Spirochaetales, Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, had larger
Co-dependent metalloproteomes (≥ 5, Fig. 6). Therefore,
the Deltaproteobacteria appear to be the only bacterial phylum which favors the use of both metals. In archaea, large
Ni- or Co-dependent metalloproteomes were observed in
methanogens (Fig. 7). Three Methanosarcina species in the
Methanosarcinales phylum had the largest metalloproteomes for both Ni and Co.
A somewhat different trend was observed in eukaryotes.
Few organisms utilized both Ni and Co (in the form of
B12). Ni utilization was limited to plants and lower
eukaryotes, such as fungi and stramenopiles, but was
absent in vertebrates. Except for the bacterial-type NiCoT
and UreH Ni transporters, additional Ni uptake systems
have evolved from certain eukaryotic proteins (such as
TgMTP1 in land plants). It is possible that ancient eukaryotic phyla inherited the Ni utilization trait and urease
from the universal ancestor of all eukaryotes, whereas certain organisms (especially vertebrates) appeared to have
lost both of them. Interestingly, urease orthologs were
detected in two marine animals (A. californica and S. purpuratus) although we could not find Ni transporters in
these organisms. It is unclear whether these orphan ureases still use Ni as a cofactor. Another interesting case was
observed in fungi. All sequenced saccharomycotina lacked
both Ni transporter and Ni-dependent urease, suggesting
that this trait was lost in this fungal subgroup. Co utilization was mainly observed in animals (except for insects)
and we could not detect any known B12-dependent proteins in most unicellular eukaryotes.

Discussion
The importance of transition metals Ni and Co in the
physiology of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is well established [1,2,10]. Both metals are essential components of
several enzymes. While much effort has previously been
placed on characterizing individual Ni/Co-binding proteins and the corresponding biosynthetic pathways, composition of the Co and Ni metalloproteomes and the
evolutionary dynamics of utilization of these metals are
largely unknown. Recently, a comparative analysis of the
distribution of Ni and Co transport systems in approximately 200 microbial genomes was reported [47]. In the
present study, we extended this analysis for both Ni/Co
transporters and Ni/Co-dependent proteins to more than
700 bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Our data represent
the most comprehensive analysis of genes likely to be
involved in Ni and Co utilization in sequenced species.
The widespread occurrence of Ni and Co utilization traits
in prokaryotes supports the idea that both metals could be
used by essentially all prokaryotic phyla. Several organ-

isms were identified that encoded Ni-dependent proteins
or B12 biosynthetic enzymes, but did not possess known
Ni or Co transporters, suggesting the presence of novel,
dual-function or unspecific Ni/Co uptake systems. For
example, CorA proteins are generally associated with the
transport of magnesium ions but some members of the
CorA family can also transport other ions such as Co and
Ni [58]. Similarly, new Ni/Co-binding proteins might be
present in organisms containing known transporters but
not the corresponding metalloproteins.
In eukaryotes, only 9 species were identified that appeared
to use both metals and most of them were unicellular
organisms. Most Ni-utilizing organisms were fungi which
did not utilize B12, whereas most B12-utilizing organisms
were animals which lost the ability to use Ni. In addition,
green algae utilized both metals, whereas land plants only
possessed the Ni utilization trait. These data show that the
two utilization traits have different evolutionary histories
in eukaryotes, and that the acquisition or loss of each trait
occurred independently in various eukaryotic phyla.

Our comparative genomic analysis showed a mosaic distribution of known Ni/Co transporters in prokaryotes.
The ECF transporter Cbi/NikMNQO was the most frequently used Ni/Co uptake system in both archaea and
bacteria. In contrast, the ABC transporter NikABCDE is
not a common transporter in prokaryotes even though it
is well characterized in E. coli. A recent study showed that
NikA could also bind heme in E. coli, indicating an additional transport function independent of Ni uptake [59].
Among known Ni/Co transporters, NiCoT and UreH were
the only families detected in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although comparative genomic approaches allow
prediction of the physiological substrate for various members of these transporters, many have unassigned function. Previous prediction of a variety of new Co
transporter candidates in various microbes suggested a
complex evolutionary dynamics of Co transport in
prokaryotes. On the other hand, identification of different
subtypes of components of NikMNQO/NikKMLQO
made here also implied a complex evolutionary dynamics
of Ni uptake in prokaryotes.

Co-dependent metalloproteomes in bacteria
Co-dependent metalloproteomes in bacteria. Numbers following the name of each phylum represent the number of
organisms containing at least one B12-binding protein and that of total sequenced organisms, respectively. The largest Codependent metalloproteome was observed in Dehalococcoides sp. CBDB1 (35 B12-dependent proteins, 32 of which were CprAs)
and Dehalococcoides ethenogenes (22 B12-dependent proteins, 19 of which were CprAs).
Analysis of Ni-dependent enzymes, B12 biosynthetic pathways and B12-dependent enzymes in prokaryotes provided a straightforward approach to analyze the
distribution and evolution of Ni and Co utilization in various organisms. It should be noted that we only analyzed
a set of strictly Ni- or Co-dependent proteins (for which
no Ni- or Co-independent forms have been reported),
which may not fully account for utilization of the two
transition metals in some organisms. Indeed, a protein
may potentially have different activities when binding different metals. For instance, it has been reported that in
certain organisms, an aci-reductone dioxygenase has different activities when binding iron or Ni [60]. In this
study, urease, the most widespread Ni-dependent enzyme
in bacteria, was only detected in certain aerobic archaea.
This observation was not unexpected because urease was
mainly found in aerobic organisms, whereas most
sequenced archaea were anaerobic. Among other Nidependent enzymes, superoxide dismutase SodN was
essentially a bacteria-specific Ni-containing protein and
MCR was specific to methanogens. In the case of Co, we

detected all Co-utilizing organisms by searching for B12dependent enzymes and all B12-producing organisms by
analyzing genes involved in B12 biosynthesis. In bacteria,
MetH was not only the most frequently used B12-dependent protein but also the only B12-binding protein in
approximately 90% of organisms containing single B12dependent proteins. Moreover, more than 80% of the latter organisms lacked the ability to synthesize B12. On the
other hand, RNR II was the most abundant B12-dependent
protein in archaea in which no MetH was observed. The
observations that only half of bacterial B12-dependent
enzymes were found in archaea and that a variety of B12dependent methyltransferase families evolved in methanogens (especially in Methanosarcina species) implied
somewhat different evolutionary trends in bacteria and
archaea. It appears that B12-dependent methyltransferases
are particularly important for metabolism of methanogenic archaea.
Previously we found that habitat, environment and other
factors (e.g., oxygen requirement, optimal temperature,

optimal pH and GC content) may influence the acquisition/loss of utilization traits of certain trace elements, e.g.,
selenium (Se) and molybdenum (Mo), in prokaryotes
[61,62]. To examine the possibility that Ni and Co utilization may also be affected by some of these factors, we
adopted a strategy which was previously used to analyze
the evolution of Se and Mo [61,62]. First, similar to Mo
utilization [62], we found that the majority of bacteria
that utilized neither Ni nor Co were host-associated (i.e.,
parasites or symbionts, Fig. 8A), implying that host-associated life style may result in the loss of metal utilization,
perhaps due to limited space and resources. Considering
differences in host-associated conditions (intra- or extracellular) and the relationship between these organisms
and their hosts (symbiotic or parasitic), we further
divided them into four groups: obligate intracellular sym-

bionts (6 organisms, 2 phyla), extracellular symbionts (19
organisms, 10 phyla), obligate intracellular parasites (35
organisms, 6 phyla) and extracellular parasites (113
organisms, 20 phyla). Interestingly, we found that the
majority of intracellular parasites and intracellular symbionts lost the ability to utilize Ni or Co, whereas more than
80% of extracellular symbionts utilized both metals (Fig.
8B). Most obligate intracellular parasites or symbionts
had much smaller genomes than extracellular organisms
[see Additional file 24]. Thus, it is possible that both metal
utilization traits are dispensable for intracellular organisms and hence have been lost due to the pressure on
genome size, although these organisms may still depend
on host Ni- or Co-dependent proteins. In contrast, the two
utilization traits mostly remained intact in essentially all

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

extracellular symbionts, presumably because they are
essential to their survival.

Ni/Co utilization and GC content indirectly reflected the
loss of Ni/Co utilization in parasites.

We also observed that the genomes of Ni- and Co-utilizing organisms had a significantly higher GC content [see
Additional file 25]. Organisms with low GC content (i.e.,
GC < 40%) which lack Ni/Co utilization were found in
several phyla, most of which are intra-/extracellular parasites. Intracellular pathogens and symbionts tend to be AT
rich and the higher energy cost and limited availability of
G and C over A and T might be the basis for the understanding these differences [63,64]. We removed all hostassociated organisms and reanalyzed the correlation with
GC content, and found that the original trend disappeared (data not shown). Thus, the correlation between

Other factors, such as gram strain, optimal temperature
and pH, also appeared to have no significant effect on
evolution of either trait. In addition, no statistically significant correlation could be observed between different factors and the size of Ni- or Co-dependent
metalloproteomes. In archaea, insights into dynamics of
Ni and Co utilization were difficult because only a small
number of archaeal genomes were sequenced and nearly
all of these organisms use both metals. However, the
absence of both Ni and Co utilization traits in Nanoarchaeum equitans, an obligate symbiont [65] with a small
genome (0.49 Mbp) and low GC content (31.6%), provides further support for our observations in bacteria. In

brief, host-associated life style (especially obligate intracellular) and/or small genome with low GC content may
result in the loss of Ni and/or Co utilization. The requirement for both metals in prokaryotes and at the same time
scattered occurrence in different phyla illustrate a
dynamic nature of Ni/Co utilization.
A similar investigation of Ni and Co utilization in eukaryotes provided a first glimpse on evolutionary dynamics of
Ni- and Co-dependent metabolic pathways in these
organisms. The fact that most parasites used neither Ni
nor Co was consistent with what we found in prokaryotes,
suggesting that both metals may become unnecessary for
parasites because of either reduced availability of the two
trace elements or dependence on the corresponding pathways of the host. Ni utilization was mainly limited to
fungi (except yeasts), land plants, green algae and stramenopiles, but it was not observed in vertebrates, nematodes, insects and yeasts which lacked both Ni
transporters and urease. It is known that S. cerevisiae can
use urea as sole nitrogen source by degrading it in two
steps (catalyzed by urea carboxylase and allophanate
hydrolase) to ammonia and carbon dioxide, which are
independent of urease and Ni [66]. A recent study
reported the identification of Ni in crystal structure of 3hydroxyanthranilic acid 3,4-dioxygenase from S. cerevisiae, implying a possible presence of novel Ni-binding
proteins in eukaryotes [67]. However, a crystal structure of
this protein in the bacterium Ralstonia metallidurans
showed that it binds iron instead of Ni [68], implying that
this protein is not a strictly Ni-dependent protein. Considering that most prokaryotic Ni-dependent enzymes except
urease are used in anaerobic metabolism and most
eukaryotes require oxygen, it is possible that the use of
oxygen led to the loss of Ni-dependent pathways in many
eukaryotes, such that only urease was preserved and only
in certain lower eukaryotes and plants. Similarly, only
three bacteria-type B12-dependent proteins were found in
eukaryotes and 90% B12-utilizing organisms possess only
single copies of MetH and MCM. These B12-dependent
enzymes were lost in all land plants and almost all unicellular eukaryotes including fungi, but still remain in green
algae, stramenopiles and all animals with the exception of
insects. However, alternative pathways, such as methionine synthesis from homocysteine by B12-independent
MetE, have evolved in various organisms [69,70]. It
should be noted that although insects and fungi appeared
to have lost all known B12-dependent enzymes, additional
Co-binding proteins have been characterized in some of
these organisms. For example, certain insects (such as Spodoptera frugiperda) encode a Co-binding class II alphamannosidase [71] and S. cerevisiae has a Co-binding
methionine aminopeptidase [72] although both proteins
are activated by other metals in other organisms [73,74].
Therefore, a possibility that non-strictly specific or currently unknown Ni/Co-binding proteins or Ni/Co-con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

taining compounds are present in organisms analyzed in
this study cannot be excluded.

Conclusion
In this study, we report a comprehensive analysis of Ni
and Co utilization in prokaryotes and eukaryotes by analyzing occurrence of transporters and metal-dependent
enzymes. We found that occurrence of Ni/Co transporters
mostly corresponds to that of known Ni/Co-dependent
proteins. A new B12-dependent protein family was predicted in bacteria. Most prokaryotes, including extracellular symbionts, possess the Ni/Co utilization trait, with the
exception of other host-associated organisms (particularly
obligate intracellular parasites and symbionts). In eukaryotes, the use of the two elements is much more restricted,
with regard to the organisms that use Ni/Co, the number
of Ni transporters and the number of Ni/B12-dependent
protein families. Again, parasitic lifestyle appears to result
in the loss of both utilization traits in eukaryotes.

Methods
Genomic sequence data
We examined fully sequenced genomes from the Entrez
Genome website at NCBI. A list of fully sequenced
prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes can be found on the
NCBI website [75]. Only one strain was used for each species (e.g., E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 was used as a representative of E. coli). In total, 540 bacterial, 47 archaeal, and
160 eukaryotic genomes were analyzed (as of Jun. 2008).
Identification of Ni/Co transporters, NikR repressor,
vitamin B12 biosynthetic pathways and Ni-/B12-dependent
enzymes
To analyze the distribution of Ni/Co transporters, we used
several well-characterized Ni/Co transport proteins (e.g.,
NikABCDE from E. coli, YntABCDE and NiCoT from Y.
pseudotuberculosis, CbiMNQO from S. typhimurium and
HupE from Rhizobium leguminosarum) and previously predicted Co transporters [31,40] as initial seed sequences to
search for homologous sequences in different organisms
via TBLASTN [76] with an e-value < 0.1. Additional
homologs were further identified using iterative TBLASTN
searches. In parallel, three cycles of PSI-BLAST with
default parameters were used for the identification of distant homologs. Orthologous proteins were defined using
the conserved domain (COG/Pfam/CDD) database and
bidirectional best hits [77]. Considering that NikABCDE
transporters have significant similarity to the ABC-type
dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems [27], we also
utilized the residues that were proposed to bind Ni in E.
coli NikA as major discriminators. Residues involved in Ni
binding are not well characterized and conflicting results
have been reported in the literature. Cherrier et al. suggested that NikA binds Ni chelated by a small organic
molecule, such as butane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate (BTC), and
that some residues, including Tyr402, Arg137, Arg97 and
Page 21 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:78

His416, form a binding site that is involved in the BTCNi-NikA interaction [78]. On the other hand, Addy and
coworkers showed that Ni may bind E. coli NikA without
chelators and is bound to two histidine residues (His56
and His442, although not conserved in other NikA proteins) at a position distant from the previously characterized binding site [79]. Here, the presence of the majority
of these residues was used to help predict NikA proteins.
In each transporter family, subgroups specific for Ni or Co
were identified based on either previous reports or gene
neighborhoods (i.e., if a transporter gene in a certain
organism was located adjacent to genes encoding Nidependent enzymes, NikR or B12 biosynthesis proteins, it
was considered as a predicted Ni- or Co-specific transporter). Other members of detected transporter families
were considered as proteins with unassigned function. It
is difficult to selectively identify B12 transporter BtuFCD
among other highly similar transport systems (such as
iron/heme or siderophore transporters), although previous approaches, based on B12 element regulation, were
utilized for the identification of BtuFCD in some bacteria
[31]. Therefore, in this study, we only examined the presence of BtuFCD (or BtuBFCD in gram-negative bacteria)
homologs in sequenced organisms for the possibility that
the potential B12 uptake system is present when we could
not detect B12 biosynthesis pathway. Orthologs of NikR
were identified using a similar approach. Occurrence of
B12 biosynthesis was verified by the presence of most of
the key components involved in B12 biosynthetic pathway: CobE, CobF, CobG, CobM, CobN, CobS, CobT,
CobW, CbiD, CbiG, CbiK and CbiX [31,80-83].
Members of known Ni-dependent protein families were
also identified. In this study, Ni-dependent proteins refer
to strictly Ni-binding proteins that utilize Ni as a cofactor.
We excluded proteins, which may bind other metals in
different organisms, such as GlxI for which the contributor to shifts in metal activation is not clear [4]. Conservation of Ni-binding ligands was also analyzed for each Nidependent protein and those lacking most of the ligands
were discarded. Similarly, in this study, we only considered B12-dependent enzymes as Co-dependent proteins
because of the unspecificity of metal utilization, and limited distribution and information on non-corrin Co-binding enzymes. In addition, many B12-dependent proteins
contain multiple domains, some of which are B12-independent. Therefore, only B12-binding domain-containing
proteins (most contain a conserved DXHXXG motif
within the B12-binding region [12]) were viewed as B12dependent users. A complete list of query proteins is
shown [see Additional files 1, 2, 3]. The presence of Ni/Co
utilization trait was then verified by the requirement for
occurrence of at least one predicted Ni/Co-specific transporter, or B12 biosynthesis trait, or at least one Ni/Co-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/78

dependent enzyme. Protein sequences for transporters
and users collected in this study are provided [see Additional files 26 and 27].
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
A recently reconstructed phylogenetic tree was adopted to
analyze the distribution of organisms that utilize Ni/Co in
different taxonomies [84]. This tree of life was based on
concatenation of 31 orthologs (most are ribosomal proteins) occurring in 191 species with sequenced genomes.
The use of a common protein set across all three domains
of life enables an objective, quantitative analysis of the consistency of traditional taxonomic groupings. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALW
[85] with default parameters and ambiguous alignments in
highly variable regions were excluded. Phylogenetic trees
were reconstructed by PHYLIP programs [86]. Pairwise distance matrices were calculated by PROTDIST to estimate
the expected amino acid replacements per position. Neighbor-joining trees were obtained with NEIGHBOR and the
most parsimonious trees were determined with PROTPARS. To evaluate robustness of the trees, we performed
maximum likelihood (ML) with PHYML [87] using default
parameters and likelihood test. If inconsistent topologies
were obtained, a third program MrBayes [88], a Bayesian
estimation of phylogeny, was used. The final phylogenetic
tree was then manually refined for visualization purposes.
