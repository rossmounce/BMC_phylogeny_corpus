Abstract
Background: It has long been known that rates of synonymous substitutions are unusually low in
mitochondrial genes of flowering and other land plants. Although two dramatic exceptions to this
pattern have recently been reported, it is unclear how often major increases in substitution rates
occur during plant mitochondrial evolution and what the overall magnitude of substitution rate
variation is across plants.
Results: A broad survey was undertaken to evaluate synonymous substitution rates in
mitochondrial genes of angiosperms and gymnosperms. Although most taxa conform to the
generality that plant mitochondrial sequences evolve slowly, additional cases of highly accelerated
rates were found. We explore in detail one of these new cases, within the genus Silene. A roughly
100-fold increase in synonymous substitution rate is estimated to have taken place within the last
5 million years and involves only one of ten species of Silene sampled in this study. Examples of
unusually slow sequence evolution were also identified. Comparison of the fastest and slowest
lineages shows that synonymous substitution rates vary by four orders of magnitude across seed
plants. In other words, some plant mitochondrial lineages accumulate more synonymous change in
10,000 years than do others in 100 million years. Several perplexing cases of gene-to-gene variation
in sequence divergence within a plant were uncovered. Some of these probably reflect interesting
biological phenomena, such as horizontal gene transfer, mitochondrial-to-nucleus transfer, and
intragenomic variation in mitochondrial substitution rates, whereas others are likely the result of
various kinds of errors.
Conclusion: The extremes of synonymous substitution rates measured here constitute by far the
largest known range of rate variation for any group of organisms. These results highlight the utility
of examining absolute substitution rates in a phylogenetic context rather than by traditional
pairwise methods. Why substitution rates are generally so low in plant mitochondrial genomes yet
occasionally increase dramatically remains mysterious.

Background
A synonymous site substitution is defined as a change in
a protein-coding gene that does not alter the amino acid
sequence encoded by the gene. Thus, synonymous substitutions are often assumed to be free of selection at the protein level, and the rates at which they accumulate are
widely used as an approximation of the neutral mutation
rate. The first study on rates of synonymous substitutions
in flowering plants found that mitochondrial genes evolve
a few times more slowly than chloroplast genes, about ten
times more slowly than plant and mammal nuclear genes,
and 50–100 times more slowly than mammalian mitochondrial genes [1]. Later studies have confirmed the low
rate of synonymous changes in angiosperm mitochondrial genes [2-4] and extended the observation to the
entire mitochondrial genome [5]. However, recent studies
identified two genera of flowering plants, Plantago and
Pelargonium, that have experienced a dramatic increase in
the mitochondrial rate of synonymous substitution [6-8].
Some of these rate increases were temporary, with rates
approaching or returning to normally low levels in certain
descendent lineages [6,7].
Phylogenetic analyses have suggested additional cases of
rate acceleration for several plant lineages [9-14], but it is
unclear whether this is a widespread phenomenon in
plants. Here we test the generality of slow synonymous
sequence evolution in plant mitochondrial genes across a
large number (between 306 and 578 species, depending
on the gene) and wide diversity of seed plants (i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms). Although genes from most
species evolve slowly, as expected, additional cases of
highly accelerated rates were found, as were examples of
exceptionally slow sequence evolution. Surprisingly, a few
plants were also identified that contain a mixture of both
quickly and slowly evolving mitochondrial genes. Overall, these results demonstrate that the synonymous substitution rate in plant mitochondria is a more variable
character than previously appreciated.

Results
Levels of sequence divergence in mitochondrial genes of
seed plants
Previous studies identified two plant lineages, Plantago
and the Geraniaceae (especially Pelargonium), that have
independently experienced periods of accelerated substitution rates in their mitochondrial genes [6-8]. To determine whether additional cases of rate acceleration could
be found in mitochondrial genes of other seed plants
(gymnosperms and angiosperms), blast searches were
undertaken in order to collect all available atp1, cox1, and
matR homologues from GenBank. These three genes were
chosen because they have been used in a number of broad
phylogenetic studies and their sequences are available for
hundreds of different species of plants. After removing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/135

multiple sequences from the same species, pseudogenes,
cDNAs, and short gene fragments, a total of 546, 306, and
578 sequences were available for atp1, cox1, and matR,
respectively. For each gene, homologous sequences were
aligned and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed using the Muse-Gaut codon model [15] to obtain
estimates of synonymous site divergence (dS) per branch
(Figs. 1, 2, 3).
A surprising feature of these trees is the amount of branchlength variation seen (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Although the great
majority of plants show conventionally low levels of synonymous site divergence, a number of species have substantially shorter or longer branches for one or more
genes. The most striking examples of increased sequence
divergence are from Plantago and Pelargonium, whose
atp1 and cox1 branch lengths are exceptionally long (note
that the matR gene has not been isolated from Pelargonium or from the fastest members of Plantago), as previously reported [6,7]. Although less extreme, one or more
species from Silene, Apodanthes, Acorus, Ephedra, and
Podocarpus are also very divergent across multiple genes.
Patterns are not as clear for other taxa. For instance, Goodenia and Musa are highly divergent for atp1 but only moderately divergent for cox1. For a number of species, such
as Carex and Anthericum, a sequence from one gene is
very divergent but data are not available for the other two
genes.
In contrast to the examples of increased levels of mitochondrial sequence divergence, there are several groups
that consistently show an unusually low level of divergence, even in the context of the general conservation
expected for plants (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Within the angiosperms,
these groups include the Arecales (also see [16]), the
Chloranthales, the sister orders Laurales and Magnoliales,
and most orders within the basal eudicots. Several gymnosperm lineages also have short branches, including the
Cycadales, the Pinaceae, and Ginkgo.
Unexpectedly, these analyses have also identified several
lineages with high levels of divergence for some genes but
low levels for others (Figs. 1, 2, 3). For example, divergence levels for Alisma are high for atp1 and matR but
unexceptional for cox1. The cox1 and matR genes from
Ranunculus are remarkable in that they are unusually conserved, similar to the very slow rates found in most basal
eudicots, while its atp1 gene is moderately divergent. For
Polemonium and Pentamerista (in the Tetrameristaceae),
atp1 is divergent but matR is conserved. Conversely, matR
is divergent but atp1 is conserved for Pilostyles (in the Apodanthaceae).

across seed plants, synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous

(dN) divergence values were estimated for a subset of taxa
from a combined analysis of five mitochondrial protein
genes (Fig. 4). Patterns of divergence in the dS tree from
the combined analysis (Fig. 4) are similar to those
observed for the trees based on analyses of individual protein-coding genes and rDNA (Fig. 5). In all cases, branch
lengths are substantially longer for Silene noctiflora, Acorus,
Ephedra, and Podocarpus than for most seed plants, but not
as long as for Plantago rugelii or Pelargonium hortorum
(Figs. 4, 5). dN values are also high for these six species, but
they are less pronounced than the increases observed for
dS (Fig. 4; note the 10-fold difference in dS and dNscales).
Absolute substitution rates in mitochondrial genes of seed
plants
The length of a branch in a phylogenetic tree, which represents an estimate of the amount of sequence divergence
for that lineage, equals the product of the absolute substitution rate(s) and time. Because of this confluence, the
rate and time components must be separated in order to
make direct comparisons of substitution rates among

taxa. We previously described a method to calculate absolute rates of synonymous (RS) and nonsynonymous (RN)
substitution along each branch in a phylogenetic context
[6,7], and we employ essentially the same strategy here.
However, in this case dS and dN values were estimated
from a combined analysis of five mitochondrial protein
genes (Fig. 4).
There is a wide range of variation in RS across seed plants
(Table 1). At one extreme, the synonymous rate in Cycas is
only 0.015 substitutions per site per billion years (SSB).
Slow rates are also seen for several other gymnosperms,
including Pinus, Ginkgo, and Zamia. The Cycas value is
more than 5-fold lower than the lowest angiosperm rates,
from Platanus, Laurus, Liriodendron, Phoenix, and Sambucus. At the other extreme, RS is equal to 90 SSB for Silene
noctiflora. The high rate of synonymous substitution for S.
noctiflora was recently discovered by a second group as
well (DB Sloan, CM Barr, MS Olson, SR Keller, and DR
Taylor, personal communication). RS for S. noctiflora is
even faster than for those species of Plantago and Pelargo-

Multigene analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous sequence divergence
Multigene analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous sequence divergence. Shown are the dS (left) and dN (right)
trees resulting from a codon-based likelihood analysis of a combined data set of five mitochondrial genes (atp1, cob, cox1, cox2,
and cox3). Branch lengths are in units of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site for the dS tree and nonsynonymous
substitutions per nonsynonymous site for the dN tree; note the 10-fold difference in scaling between the two trees. Topological
constraints were enforced during the analysis (see methods). Sequences for two to five of the genes analyzed were available for
any one plant [see Supp. Table 5 in Additional file 2]. S. = Silene; P. = Plantago.

nium sampled here, but lower than the fastest previously
reported angiosperm rate of 166–244 SSB for Plantago
media [6]. Between Cycas and P. media, synonymous substitutions vary by a factor of 11,000 to 16,000 across seed
plants.
RN is also variable across seed plants, ranging by a factor
of 250 between Liriodendron and S. noctiflora (Table 1).
There is a general correlation between RN and RS (R2 =
0.80); however, RN values are muted relative to their RS
counterparts (Figs. 4 and 6). Consequently, RN/RS ratios
(Table 1) are generally lower for species with high RS (e.g.,
P. rugelii, S. noctiflora, and Pelargonium) and higher for
species with low RS (e.g., Cycas, Pinus, and Platanus). These
ratios suggest very different evolutionary environments at
the extremes. For P. rugelii and Pelargonium, substitutions
at synonymous sites occur 25 times more frequently than
at nonsynonymous sites, whereas for Pinus and Cycas,
nonsynonymous substitutions are actually estimated to

occur 2–4 times more often than synonymous substitutions.
It must be noted here that sites of RNA editing were not
excluded in the analyses of this study. In plants, RNA editing usually occurs at multiple positions for any mitochondrial transcript [17,18]. The retention of edited sites in
rate analyses can sometimes bias estimates of nonsynonymous substitution rates, although their presence seems to
have little to no effect on synonymous rate estimates
[19,20]. Indeed, the exclusion of edited sites in gymnosperm cox1 sequences resulted in a 30-fold reduction in
the nonsynonymous rate [19]. Thus, the high RN/RS ratios
observed for Pinus and Cycas are probably an artifact of the
large number of edited sites present in their genes.
To further explore the dynamics of the rate acceleration
within Silene, RN and RS for all internal and terminal
branches in the Caryophyllales were plotted phylogeneti-

cally (Fig. 7). Only the branch leading to S. noctiflora
shows a substantial increase in rate, indicating that the
rate acceleration occurred within the last five million
years, subsequent to the divergence of S. noctiflora from
the other two species of Silene included in this analysis. To
determine whether any other species of Silene show elevated substitution levels, seven additional species were
sampled for the genes cob and cox1. However, none of the
additional taxa appear to be any more closely related to S.
noctiflora than is S. latifolia [see Supp. Fig. 1 in Additional
file 1], and none of their sequences are unusually divergent (Fig. 5). Because these additional species did not provide further information on the timing of the rate
acceleration, they were not included in the absolute rates
analyses in Figure 7.
The frequency of mitochondrial RNA editing was shown
to be highly reduced in Pelargonium and other Gera-

niaceae, and this observation was postulated to be potentially related to the increase in their mitochondrial
synonymous substitution rate [7]. To discover whether
the frequency of editing is also reduced in S. noctiflora, edit
sites were predicted using the online resource PREP-Mt
[21] for the six taxa shown in Figure 7 (Table 2). Contrary
to the situation in the Geraniaceae, there appears to be little correlation between substitution rate and editing frequency in Silene. The number of predicted edit sites in S.
noctiflora is quite similar to the other two species of Silene
and to Stellaria, despite the roughly 100-fold increase in
the synonymous substitution rate specific to S. noctiflora
mitochondrial genes.

Discussion
Absolute substitution rates
Previous studies on synonymous substitution rates found
that plant mitochondrial sequences evolve very slowly [1Page 8 of 14

5]. For the most part, the results presented in Figures 1, 2,
3 confirm these earlier findings. Roughly 80–90% of the
sampled species have normally low levels of sequence
divergence at synonymous sites. However, a surprising
number of species depart from the "normal" mitochondrial pattern. At one end of the spectrum, there are several
angiosperm (e.g., Arecales, Chloranthales, and Laurales)
and gymnosperm (e.g., Cycadales and Pinaceae) groups
whose genes are unusually conserved at synonymous
sites. At the opposite end are taxa such as Plantago, Pelargonium, and S. noctiflora with long branches for multiple
genes. Many additional species have long branches for a
single gene, but independent sequences are needed to
confirm that these long branches are replicable and not
artifactual (also see next section). On the whole, these
results suggest that while most lineages of plant mitochondria do indeed possess generally low synonymous
substitution rates, it's increasingly naive and misleading
to categorize all plants in this way, and that synonymous
substitution rates are, for reasons still unclear, exceptionally fluid and variable in plant mitochondria.
Because the analyses in Figures 1, 2, 3 used almost all species available in GenBank (some species were lost during

data filtration; see methods), they provide a generally
unbiased representation of rate variation across seed
plants. However, for comparisons among species, branch
lengths alone are inadequate because they are a function
of absolute substitution rate(s) and time. In other words,
equally long branches do not necessarily equate to equally
fast absolute substitution rates. For example, dS for S. noctiflora, Acorus, and Ephedra are quite similar, but RS for S.
noctiflora is almost 40 times higher than for Acorus and
Ephedra (Table 1). Indeed, the synonymous rate for S. noctiflora is even faster than for the species of Plantago and Pelargonium examined here (Table 1), despite the much
shorter branch length for S. noctiflora (Fig. 4).
These findings highlight the importance of taxon sampling in these analyses. The increased sampling of Silene
species allowed us to pinpoint the rate acceleration in S.
noctiflora to a 5 million year period. Similarly, sampling of
multiple taxa within Plantago in a previous study on synonymous rates identified one species, P. media, with RS a
few times higher than for S. noctiflora over a similar time
span [6]. The finding of extensive variation in synonymous substitution rates within these two genera suggests
that there is likely to be much more rate variation in plant
mitochondrial genomes than is already apparent. Increasingly dense sampling of species is likely to uncover additional examples of rate variation. Calculation of absolute
substitution rates may identify further examples, because
some increases may be so recent that sequence divergence
is still rather low and not readily apparent in phylogenetic
trees.
Unfortunately, for Acorus and Ephedra there is little chance
that increased sampling will provide a better estimate of
the timing and magnitude of the rate acceleration, despite
the fact that their increased divergence levels are spread
over more than 100 million years. For Acorus, the genus
encompasses only three or four species and they all appear
to be very similar at the molecular level (see three species
in Figure 1 and two species in Figure 3). Furthermore,
there are no other genera in the Acorales to break up the
time period from the base of monocots to the diversification of Acorus [22]. With over 60 species in Ephedra, it may
be possible to more finely dissect the dynamics of rate
evolution in this genus. However, like the situation in
Acorus, the species included here show very little molecular divergence (see three species in Figure 2) and there are
no other genera to break up the long time interval
between the crown and stem group nodes of Ephedra [22].
Among-species comparisons reveal that synonymous substitution rates vary by four orders of magnitude across
seed plants, from a low of 0.015 SSB in Cycas (Table 1) to
a high of 166–244 SSB in Plantago media [6]. Excluding
RNA viruses [23], this is, to our knowledge, by far the larg-

Absolute substitution rates in Caryophyllales
Absolute substitution rates in Caryophyllales. Absolute rates of nonsynonymous (RN) and synonymous (RS) substitution
are plotted above and below, respectively, each branch of the chronogram. RN and RS values were calculated as in Table 1, using

est range of synonymous rates known for any phylogenetic group and genome, as well as both the lowest and
highest estimated rates. To put this range in perspective,
the amount of mitochondrial sequence divergence found
in Cycas after almost 180 million years of evolution would
have taken P. media on average only about 15 thousand
years to accumulate. These results highlight the advantage
of estimating rates in a phylogenetic context. Traditional
pairwise methods average rates between two lineages,
thereby masking any lineage-specific rate differences. A
pairwise comparison between S. noctiflora at 90 SSB and S.
latifolia at 0.54 SSB would result in an averaging of their
very different rates to ~45 SSB, which doesn't reflect either
of their actual rates very well. Similarly, the low rate found
in Cycas (0.015 SSB) wouldn't be quite as low in a pairwise comparison with Zamia (0.059 SSB) leading to a
pairwise rate of 0.037 SSB. The phylogenetic estimates of
substitution rates indicate a 6000-fold range of variation

between Cycas and S. noctiflora versus a 1000-fold range
based on the pairwise estimates.
Although substitution rates are high for mitochondrial
genes of S. noctiflora and Acorus, chloroplast and nuclear
genes from these species do not show any increase in
sequence divergence [see Supp. Fig. 1 in Additional file 1]
[24-27]. Thus, the rate acceleration in these species is confined to the mitochondrial genome, as seen also in Plantago and Pelargonium [6,7]. In those studies, defects in
mitochondrial DNA replication or repair were speculated
to be, among a wide range of processes potentially affecting the mitochondrial mutation rate, the most likely
causes of such severe, mitochondrial-specific increases in
substitution rates. Similar factors may also be at work in
S. noctiflora and Acorus. In contrast, in Ephedra, chloroplast
and nuclear sequences are also divergent [27,28]. This
points to a factor acting at the organismal level, such as
generation time, that would affect rates in all three
genomes, although mitochondrial-specific forces may be
at work as well. Some studies [16,29-31] have detected
moderate, correlated differences in synonymous substitution rates across all three plant genomes and have attributed these to generation time effects [16,29,30], paternal
transmission of organelles [31], or correlated substitution
and speciation rates [32,33].
Within-plant variation in sequence divergence
One surprising finding from the broad-scale analyses is
the number of plant lineages with levels of synonymous

Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:135

site divergence that appear to be relatively high for some
genes and low for others (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In most cases, the
basis for this apparent within-plant rate heterogeneity is
unknown, and as emphasized below, some of these cases
are likely to be or potentially are the result of error of various kinds. Others, however, have a possible biological
underpinning. One likely biological explanation is horizontal gene transfer, which occurs surprisingly frequently
between mitochondrial genomes of unrelated plants
[34,35]. Transfers between genomes with highly different
substitution rates and accumulated sequence divergence
could easily account for some of the within-plant, geneto-gene differences shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3 and indeed is
suspected to account for one particular case. Two members of the Apodanthaceae, Pilostyles and Apodanthes, have
high levels of divergence for matR. The Apodanthes atp1
gene is similarly divergent, but atp1 from Pilostyles is not.
Phylogenetic analysis of the atp1 gene from Pilostyles suggests the possibility that this gene may have been acquired
via horizontal transfer from a plant with normally low
mitochondrial rates [12].
Another potential biological explanation for differences
in synonymous rates between genes from the same plant
is that they are located in different genetic compartments
that possess different substitution rates. With the exception of Plantago and Pelargonium [6,7] and probably some
of the new cases of high-rate mitochondrial genomes
reported in this study, synonymous rates are much lower
in mitochondrial than nuclear genomes in plants [1-4].
Functional transfer of a mitochondrial gene to the nucleus
will thus usually lead to much higher rates of sequence
divergence. This possibility is exciting because there has
been no report of functional nuclear transfer for atp1,
matR, or cox1 in any plant. This includes no evidence for
loss of these three genes from the mitochondrial genomes
of 280 diverse angiosperms examined by Southern blot
hybridization, whereas 16 other genes were inferred to be
frequently lost from the mitochondrial genome and,
equally frequently, functionally transferred to the nucleus
[36].
A third intriguing possibility is that synonymous substitution rates vary across regions of the mitochondrial
genome. In the chloroplast genome of angiosperms, synonymous rates are known to be a few-fold higher in single-copy regions than in a large inverted-repeat region
[1,37], and of perhaps greater relevance, a small region
with higher accelerated synonymous rates has recently
been discovered in the chloroplast of one lineage of legumes (KH Wolfe, personal communication). Gene-togene variation in the mitochondrial mutation rate was
also recently observed in populations of Silene vulgaris
[38,39].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/135

There are also several non-biological reasons why divergence levels for a particular species vary between genes.
Sequencing errors will artificially inflate sequence divergence. The Pennisetum atp1 sequence is a likely example.
Including the atp1 sequence, eight mitochondrial genes
were generated for Pennisetum from the same unpublished
study (GenBank: AF511559–AF511569), and all show
similar characteristics including frameshifting indels and
a large number of nucleotide substitutions (data not
shown). Most likely, these unpublished sequences are full
of errors, and this is the cause of the apparently anomalous divergence of atp1 in Pennisetum.
Misidentification of the correct phylogenetic position of a
sequence/organism could also lead to artifactually long
branches (recall that topological constraints were
enforced for dS branch length estimation). For example,
two cases were found where the taxonomic sources of
sequences were swapped. In the first case, a cox1 sequence
whose source is listed as Austrobaileya (GenBank:
AF193954) is more similar to an independent Ceratophyllum sequence than to other Austrobaileyales sequences,
while a sequence annotated as Ceratophyllum (GenBank:
AF193945) is actually more Austrobaileya-like. These two
GenBank files have now been corrected. A similar mix-up
occurred between a Ginkgo-like sequence annotated as
Cabomba (GenBank: X94585) and a Cabomba-like
sequence identified as Ginkgo (GenBank: X94587). In
each example, the mislabeled sequences were generated
from the same study and probably reflect a mix-up that
occurred during the database submission process. They
were easily identifiable (and were excluded from the final
analyses) because they appeared as uncharacteristically
long branches relative to independent sequences of the
same gene from the same genus.
The use of topological constraints in the analyses may
similarly lead to spuriously long branches. To evaluate
this possibility, unconstrained analyses were performed
on the four data sets used for Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 [see Supp.
Figs. 2-3 in Additional file 1]. As can be seen, almost all
long branches in the constrained analyses remain long in
the unconstrained analyses. However, the use of topological constraints apparently led to an erroneously long
branch for Archytaea matR and for Pennisetum atp1. Archytaea was constrained as an asterid in the Ericales (based on
GenBank taxonomy), but it is actually a rosid in the Malpighiales [22]. In the unconstrained analysis for matR,
Archytaea groups properly within the Malpighiales and
exhibits a more normal branch length [see Supp. Fig. 2 in
Additional file 1]. The long branch for Pennisetum atp1
also greatly diminishes in the unconstrained analyses [see
Supp. Fig. 2 in Additional file 1]. As mentioned above, the
long Pennisetum branch may result from a poor-quality
sequence read. Alternatively, the sequence may have been

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:135

acquired via horizontal gene transfer, or the DNA sample
was derived from an organism mistakenly identified as
Pennisetum.
These examples underscore the need for independent
sequencing to verify that any and all cases of putative
intragenomic variation in synonymous substitution rates
are real and not the result of human error. For those cases
that are validated, it will be interesting to see whether any
turn out to reflect noteworthy events in mitochondrial
evolution, such as gene- or region-specific differences in
substitution rates within a mitochondrial genome, horizontal gene transfer, or the functional transfer to the
nucleus of a gene that has never known to have been sotransferred in plants (atp1 or matR) or even among all
eukaryotes (cox1).

Conclusion
In this study, we have measured synonymous substitution
rates in a phylogenetic context and uncovered numerous
independent examples of rate increase and decrease.
These results demonstrate that the synonymous substitution rate in plant mitochondria is a more variable character than previously appreciated. The extremes of
synonymous substitution rates measured here constitute
by far the largest known range of rate variation for any
group of organisms, yet there is no obvious explanation
for these divergent patterns. Future studies are required to
understand the evolutionary processes driving these patterns.

Methods
Molecular techniques
Total genomic DNA was extracted and purified from fresh
leaves using a CTAB protocol [40] or using the DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Genes were amplified by polymerase chain
reaction using a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research) and
gene-specific primers [see Supp. Table 1 in Additional file
2]. Each reaction was performed using 35 cycles of 30 sec
at 94°C, 30 sec at 50°C, and 2.0–2.5 min at 72°C, with
an initial step of 3 min at 94°C and a final step of 10 min
at 72°C. Polymerase chain reaction products were purified using ExoSAP-IT (United States Biochemical) and
then sequenced on both strands using an ABI 3730
(Applied Biosystems) at the Indiana Molecular Biology
Institute. Sequences newly determined in this study were
deposited in GenBank under accessions EF547202–
EF547251. Additional nucleotide sequences used in this
study were obtained from GenBank [see Supp. Tables 2-7
in Additional file 2].
Survey of mitochondrial sequence divergence
Similarity searches were performed with blastn against the
nonredundant GenBank database using the atp1, cox1,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/135

and matR genes from Arabidopsis thaliana as queries (GenBank: Y08501). Limitations were enforced during the
searches such that only hits from the Spermatophyta
(gymnosperms and angiosperms) with an e-value less
than 1e-10 were included. Hits less than 200 bp in length,
multiple hits to the same species, pseudogenes, and cDNA
sequences were removed from the blast results, while
sequences generated in this study were added. Sequences
were aligned using ClustalX and manually adjusted when
necessary. Poorly alignable regions were excluded from
the data sets, as were regions with gaps in the majority of
taxa. These data sets (and all others used in the paper) are
available [see Additional file 3].
For each surveyed gene, a ML topology was determined
with PAUP*. To ensure completion of the ML analysis,
several time-saving steps were taken. First, a partially-constrained topology was enforced. The topology was constrained such that all sequences within a family (as
defined by GenBank taxonomy) were forced to be monophyletic. Relationships among families were constrained
according to information from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website [22]. Relationships among the major seed
plant groups were constrained according to the 9-gene ML
analysis of Qiu et al [41]. Second, ML parameters were
fixed to values estimated from a neighbor-joining prior to
the ML analysis. Third, the ML analysis used the HKY+G+I
model with four rate categories rather than the more
parameter-rich GTR+G+I model. The ML topology was
identified by a heuristic search starting from the aforementioned neighbor-joining tree and using the TBR
branch-swapping algorithm and the MULTREES option.
To determine whether the PAUP* time-saving strategies
had an effect on the results of this study, a ML topology
was also determined for each gene using RAxML version
2.2.3 [42]. In contrast to the PAUP* analysis, no topological constraints were enforced, the GTR+G model was
used (GTR+G+I is not available in RAxML), the search
started from a maximum parsimony tree, and the ML
parameters were estimated during the ML analysis. For
each gene, 10 replicates were performed starting from 10
different randomized parsimony trees. The initial rearrangement setting was fixed to 10 for all analyses.
Using the ML tree topologies generated above for each
gene, dSbranch lengths were estimated in HyPhy version
0.99 for UNIX [43] using the MG94W9 codon model [15]
and allowing for independent dN and dS values for each
branch (the local parameters option). The dS trees using
the PAUP* topologies are shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, and the
dS trees based on RAxML topologies are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 [see Additional file 1].

Estimation of absolute substitution rates
Absolute substitution rates were calculated for a subset of
the taxa in the rate survey using methods that have been
described previously [6,7]. Briefly, divergence times
within Caryophyllaceae [see Supp. Fig. 1B in Additional
file 1] were estimated by penalized likelihood with the
program r8s [44], using an ML tree from an analysis of the
chloroplast gene matK [see Supp. Fig. 1A in Additional file
1] and 38 million years for the split between Caryophyllaceae and Amaranthaceae as a calibration point [45].
Standard errors for Caryophyllaceae divergence times
were estimated from 100 bootstrap replicates. Divergence
times and associated errors for Plantago, for the remaining
angiosperms, and for gymnosperms were taken from the
analyses of Cho et al [6], Wikstrom et al [45], and Magallon and Sanderson [27], respectively. The dS and dN trees
in Figures 4 and 5 were estimated from individual and
combined data sets of five mitochondrial protein-coding
genes (atp1, cob, cox1, cox2, cox3) using HyPhy as
described in the previous section on a topology constrained according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website
[22]. Standard errors for dS and dN were estimated from
100 bootstrap replicates. RS and RN values for each branch
were calculated by dividing the mitochondrial sequence
divergences from the combined data set by the elapsed
time along that branch (Table 1).
