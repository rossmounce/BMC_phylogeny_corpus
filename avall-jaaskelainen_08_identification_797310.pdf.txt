Abstract
Background: Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287 is covered by a regular surface (S-) layer consisting
of a 435 amino acid protein SlpA. This protein is completely unrelated in sequence to the previously
characterized S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus acidophilus group.
Results: In this work, the self-assembly and cell wall binding domains of SlpA were characterized.
The C-terminal self-assembly domain encompassed residues 179–435 of mature SlpA, as
demonstrated by the ability of N-terminally truncated recombinant SlpA to form a periodic
structure indistinguishable from that formed by full length SlpA. Furthermore, a trypsin degradation
analysis indicated the existence of a protease resistant C-terminal domain of 214 amino acids. By
producing a set of C-terminally truncated recombinant SlpA (rSlpA) proteins the cell wall binding
region was mapped to the N-terminal part of SlpA, where the first 145 amino acids of mature SlpA
alone were sufficient for binding to isolated cell wall fragments of L. brevis ATCC 8287. The binding
of full length rSlpA to the cell walls was not affected by the treatment of the walls with 5%
trichloroacetic acid (TCA), indicating that cell wall structures other than teichoic acids are
involved, a feature not shared by the Lactobacillus acidophilus group S-layer proteins characterized
so far. Conserved carbohydrate binding motifs were identified in the positively charged N-terminal
regions of six Lactobacillus brevis S-layer proteins.
Conclusion: This study identifies SlpA as a two-domain protein in which the order of the
functional domains is reversed compared to other characterized Lactobacillus S-layer proteins, and
emphasizes the diversity of potential cell wall receptors despite similar carbohydrate binding
sequence motifs in Lactobacillus S-layer proteins.

Background
Surface layers (S-layers) are cell envelope structures ubiquitously found in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac-

terial species as well as in Archaea. They are composed of
numerous identical (glyco)protein subunits, 40–200 kDa
in molecular weight, which completely cover the cell surPage 1 of 15

face forming a two-dimensional, regular array having
either oblique (p1, p2), square (p4) or hexagonal (p3, p6)
symmetry. The subunits are held together and attached to
the underlying cell surface by noncovalent interactions,
and they have an intrinsic ability to spontaneously form
regular layers either in solution or on a solid support
under suitable conditions [1]. Functions of S-layers are
poorly known thus far. They include the determination
and maintenance of cell shape, action as a protective coat,
molecular sieve or ion trap or as a mediator of adhesion
or surface recognition. The contribution of S-layers to virulence has been reported [1,2].
In general, S-layer proteins have two structural regions in
which two essential functions reside: a region involved in
the attachment of the S-layer subunit to the cell envelope
and a region involved in S-layer assembly. These regions
have been characterized in several Gram-positive and
some Gram-negative bacteria. In many Gram-positive
bacilli and in Thermus thermophilus so called SLH (S-layer
homology) motifs [3], 55–60 amino acids long and often
located in the N-terminal part of the protein, are responsible for the attachment of the subunit proteins to the cell
wall through a pyruvylated polysaccharide receptor in the
cell wall [4]. In S-layers of Gram-positive bacteria not having SLH-motifs the attachment to the cell wall has been
proposed to be mediated by an interaction between basic
amino acids in the cell wall binding region and negatively
charged secondary cell wall polymers. The cell wall receptors of such S-layers in Geobacillus species characterized so
far contain mannuronic acid and can be classified as
acidic oligosaccharides other than teichoic or teichuronic
acids, while teichoic and lipoteichoic acids have been
shown to be the cell wall receptors of the S-layer proteins
of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus crispatus. However, some cell wall polysaccharides of Gram-positive bacteria proposed to be involved in S-layer binding have a net
neutral charge [1,5-7].
Among Gram-positive bacteria, the self-assembly regions
of S-layer proteins have so far been studied in the S-layers
of lactobacilli (see below), and in the S-layers of Bacillus
anthracis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus. These studies rely on electron microscopy of
recombinant S-layer protein fragments, and the selfassembly region has been shown to be of either central or
C-terminal location [8-11].
In addition to L. brevis, S-layers have also been found in
Lactobacillus helveticus as well as in several Lactobacillus acidophilus group bacteria [12] including L. acidophilus, L.
crispatus and L. gallinarum. The overall sequence similarity
between characterized Lactobacillus S-layer protein genes is
low and similarity is usually found only between related
species. The presence of multiple S-layer protein genes in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/165

a single strain is common in lactobacilli. For example, L.
brevis ATCC 14869 has three S-layer protein genes, two of
which are expressed under different environmental conditions and one is silent under laboratory conditions [13].
Other typical features of Lactobacillus S-layer proteins
include their relatively small size and a high predicted
overall pI [7]. Self-assembly and cell wall binding regions
have been characterized in the S-layer protein SA of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 [14] and CbsA of L. crispatus JCM 5810 [15]. The sequences of SA and CbsA are
homologous especially in the C-terminal region, which
mediates the attachment to the cell wall, and the more
variable N-terminal part is responsible for the self-assembly of the S-layer subunits.
The S-layer protein of Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287, SlpA
[16], is a 435 amino acid, 46 kDa protein, which assembles on the bacterial cell forming an oblique lattice [17]
and for which a fibronectin-binding function has been
described [18]. L. brevis is phylogenetically distant from L.
acidophilus group [19], and this is reflected in the unique
amino acid sequence of SlpA compared to L. acidophilus
group S-layer proteins [7]. Foreign epitopes up to 11
amino acids long have been expressed in SlpA in order to
develop tools for mucosal immunization [17]. L. brevis
ATCC 8287 would be a suitable strain to be used as a live
oral vaccine, as it has a GRAS (Generally Recognized As
Safe) status and it has been shown to possess probiotic
properties [20]. For vaccine development, as well as for
nanobiotechnological applications, for which regularly
arranged S-layers are especially well-suited [21,22],
knowledge about the structure-function relationships of
SlpA, presented in this study, is essential.
In this work, we have characterized the two-domain structure of the S-layer protein SlpA of L. brevis ATCC 8287
with its C-terminal self-assembly and N-terminal cell wall
binding domains. Conserved carbohydrate binding
motifs were detected in the N-terminal, positively charged
regions of six L. brevis S-layer proteins; however, the cell
wall receptor of SlpA was found to be different from the
receptors of previously characterized Lactobacillus S-layer
proteins.

Oligonucleotides and DNA sequencing
Oligonucleotides (Oligomer, Helsinki, Finland) used in
this work are listed in Table 2. Nucleotide sequencing was
performed by the dideoxy chain termination method of
Sanger et al. [25] by using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic analyzer (Applied biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in combination with the DNA sequencing kit for BigDye
Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems).
Protein analysis
Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using bovine
serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described by Laemmli [26]
and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.
Construction of plasmid vectors
For the expression of the mature SlpA protein, SlpA1–435,
the gene was amplified by PCR from the chromosomal
DNA of L. brevis ATCC 8287 using primer pairs 1594/
1595 or 1596/1597 (Table 2). The PCR fragment obtained
with primer pair 1594/1595 was digested with NcoI and
XhoI and ligated with NcoI-XhoI digested pET-28b(+),
resulting in plasmid pKTH5198 encoding rSlpA with a Cterminal His-tag (Table 1). The PCR product amplified
with primers 1596 and 1597 was digested with XbaI and
cloned into the NheI site of plasmid pET-28a(+). The
resulting plasmid, encoding rSlpA with an N-terminal
His-tag, was named pKTH5199.

Three C-terminal truncations, seven N-terminal truncations and two N-and C-terminal truncations of SlpA were
constructed, each with a His-tag sequence at either N- or
C-terminus. For a summary of the plasmid constructs, see
Table 1. For cloning the C-terminal truncations, primer
pairs 1628/1630 (for SlpA1–145), 1628/1629 (for SlpA1–
290) and 1628/1638 (for SlpA1–189) (Table 2) were used to
amplify the slpA sequences with plasmid pKTH5199 as a
template. PCR fragments obtained were digested with
NheI and cloned into NheI-digested pET-28a(+). The
resulting plasmids were named pKTH5203, pKTH5204
and pKTH5260, respectively (Table 1).
Cloning of the N-terminal truncations of SlpA with the
His-tag sequence at the 3'-terminus was carried out with
primer pairs 1602/1604 (for SlpA146–435) and 1603/1604
(for SlpA291–435) (Table 2) and pKTH5198 as a template.
The resulting PCR fragments were cloned as NcoI-XhoI
fragments into pET-28b(+), giving plasmids pKTH5200
and pKTH5201, respectively (Table 1). For cloning the Nterminal truncations with the His-tag sequence at the 5'terminus, primer pairs 1777/1636 (for SlpA149–435),
1644/1636 (for SlpA167–435), 1776/1636 (for SlpA179–435),
1635/1636 (for SlpA190–435), or 1637/1636 (for SlpA210–

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/165

435) were used to amplify the slpA sequences with plasmid
pKTH5199 as a template. The PCR fragments obtained
were digested with NheI and cloned into NheI-digested
pET-28a(+) resulting in plasmids pKTH5333, pKTH5264,
pKTH5325, pKTH5261 and pKTH5262, respectively
(Table 1).

Sequences encoding N-and C-terminally truncated SlpA
were PCR amplified with primers 1635/1639 (for SlpA190–
423) and 1637/1639 (for SlpA210–423), using plasmid
pKTH5199 as a template. The resulting PCR fragments
were cloned as NheI-fragments into pET-28a(+), giving
plasmids pKTH5258 and pKTH5259, respectively (Table
1). All constructs were sequenced to verify the correct
open reading frames.
Heterologous expression of the sequences encoding
mature SlpA and its truncated forms
Gene expression was carried out as described in the pET
System Manual (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) by using
Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Briefly, expression of
recombinant SlpA proteins was induced by adding isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) at a concentration of 0.5 to 1.0
mM to the medium of exponentially growing E. coli
strains harboring one of the expression plasmids listed in
Table 1. After IPTG was added, the incubation was continued for one to five hours, depending on the protein to be
purified. Recombinant SlpA proteins were purified in the
presence of 4 M guanidine hydrochloride (GHCl) or 6 M
urea with a His Trap HP column according to the instructions given by Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).
After purification the fractions containing the recombinant SlpA protein were dialyzed overnight at +4°C
against distilled water. Purity of the recombinant proteins,
present as a precipitate and/or as soluble proteins after
dialysis, was checked by SDS-PAGE.
Isolation of SlpA protein from L. brevis ATCC 8287
The S-layer protein was extracted from L. brevis cells grown
to an OD600 nm of 1.0 in MRS broth. Cells from 1 l of culture were harvested and washed twice with distilled water.
The pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of 2 M GHCl and
incubated for 30 min at +4°C followed by centrifugation
(15,000 × g for 20 min). The supernatant was concentrated with Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal filter (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA) before dialysis against distilled water
supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2 overnight at +4°C, followed by dialysis against distilled water overnight at 4°C.
Before dialysis the SlpA protein concentration was
adjusted to 1 mg/ml. After dialysis a centrifugation step
(20,000 × g for 20 min) was performed. The pellet containing the S-layer self-assembly products was resuspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0).

Proteolytic degradation of SlpA with trypsin and peptide
mapping
Isolated SlpA at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was dialyzed
against distilled water supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2
overnight followed by a second overnight dialysis against
distilled water. The dialysis was followed by a centrifugation step (16,000 × g for 30 min). The S-layer monomers,
present in the supernatant, were digested with trypsin
under the following conditions: 300 ng SlpA protein and
3 μg trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 300
μl of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 10 to 30 min at 37°C.
The reaction was stopped by heating the samples for 10
min at 100°C and the samples were subjected to SDSPAGE. N-terminal sequencing was performed by a gaspulsed liquid sequencer as described previously [27] and
peptide mapping by a Biflex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (BrukerFranzen Analytic, Bremen, Germany) as described by [28].

Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and treated with DNAase I (25 μg/ml,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and RNAase I (25 μg/
ml, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgCl2 for 30 minutes
at 37°C. Cell wall fragments were collected, treated with
1% SDS for 30 minutes at 100°C, washed extensively with
distilled water at room temperature and lyophilized.

Investigation of the self-assembly properties of purified
truncated S-layer proteins
To assess the ability of the recombinant S-layer proteins to
self-assemble, affinity purified proteins were dissolved in
5 M GHCl at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and the solutions were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) in Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Units (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) for two hours at 4°C. Dialysis was followed
by a centrifugation step (16,000 × g for 30 min) and the
formation of a precipitate was checked by SDS-PAGE. For
transmission electron microscopy, 1 mg of the purified,
lyophilized proteins were dissolved in 1 ml 5 M GHCl in
50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) and the solution was dialyzed against 10 mM CaCl2 in distilled water for 18 h.
Samples were transferred onto carbon-coated electron
microscope grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge,
negative stained with 2,5% uranyl acetate as described
previously [29], and electron micrographs were taken
with Philips CM 12 transmission electron microscope
(Philips Eindhoven, the Netherlands) operated at 80 kV
in a low-dose mode. Freeze-etched preparations of L.
brevis ATCC 8287 cells were prepared as previously
described [30], and lattice constants of the S-layer formed
by SlpA were determined as described by [31].

Binding of the truncated S-layer proteins to bacterial cells
and isolated cell wall fragments
Binding assays of recombinant S-layer proteins to LiClextracted L. brevis ATCC 8287 and L. acidophilus ATCC
4356 cells were performed essentially as described previously [14]. The amount of recombinant S-layer protein
used in one binding reaction was 50 μg and the buffer was
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 150 mM NaCl. The presence of cell-bound S-layer protein in the samples was verified by SDS-PAGE. In binding assays with isolated cell
wall fragments, monomeric truncated S-layer proteins,
present in the supernatant after centrifugation (20 minutes at 16 000 g at +4°C), were used. 20 μg CWF and 10
μg full length recombinant SlpA or an equimolar amount
of truncated S-layer proteins were combined in 50 μl of 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl. After incubation (1
hour at room temperature) cell wall fragments were collected, washed once with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150
mM NaCl, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Isolation of native cell wall fragments (CWF) from L.
brevis ATCC 8287
L. brevis ATCC 8287 cells were cultivated overnight in 1 l
of MRS broth, collected and washed three times with distilled water. Cells were suspended in 30 ml of 2 M GHCl,
incubated shaking for 30 minutes at +4°C, collected and
washed once with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Cells were
disrupted by French Pressure Cell Press (SLM Instruments
Inc, IL, USA) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and the lysate
was centrifuged at 3000 g for 5 minutes at +4°C. Cell wall
fragments were collected, washed five times with 50 mM

Treatment of native cell wall fragments with TCA
0.5 mg or 0.25 mg of isolated CWF in water were incubated in the presence of 5% (V/V) TCA either at +4°C or
at +37°C for 24 h in a rotary shaker. The cell walls were
collected, washed three times with distilled water at +4°C
and suspended in distilled water. The treatment at +4°C
was performed twice. Organic phosphorous was measured from native and treated CWF and from the supernatant obtained in the extraction by the method described
by [32].

Analysis of primary amino acid sequences
The isoelectric point (pI) values of the L. brevis S-layer proteins as well as those of the constructed rSlpA proteins
were obtained by ProtParam [33], and the analyses of the
hydrophobicity patterns of S-layer proteins of L. brevis
were performed by the Kyte-Doolittle method [34] with
ProtScale [35] on the ExPASy server. Repeat structures
from S-layer proteins were localized by REPRO [36,37].
The comparison matrix used in the protein repeat analysis
was blosum62 (gap open penalty, 12; gap extension penalty, 1). Sequence alignment analyses of L. brevis S-layer
proteins were performed by ClustalW [38] using gonnet as
a comparison matrix (gap open penalty, 10; gap extension
penalty, 0.2). Pairwise comparison analyses were performed by SIM [39,40] using blosum62 as a comparison
matrix (gap open penalty, 12; gap extension penalty, 4).

From the complete genome sequence of ATCC 367,
deposited under GenBank accession number CP000416,
the hypothetical S-layer proteins of L. brevis ATCC 367
were identified by BLAST [39] using complete SlpA, SlpB,
SlpC and SlpD sequences. The identified hypothetical Slayer proteins of ATCC 367 have been deposited in SwissProt under accession numbers Q03P39 and Q03NT3.

Results
Primary amino acid sequence analysis of the S-layer
proteins of L. brevis
The only thus far characterized S-layer proteins in L. brevis
are the SlpA protein of L. brevis ATCC 8287 [16] and the
SlpB, SlpC and SlpD proteins of L. brevis ATCC 14869
[13]. By performing a homology search for the recently
sequenced genome of L. brevis ATCC 367 [41] with the
BLAST program, two new putative S-layer proteins,
Q03P39 and Q03NT3, were identified in the genome.

The amino acid sequences encoding the mature S-layer
proteins of L. brevis ATCC 8287 (SlpA) and ATCC 14869
(SlpB, C and D) and the putative mature S-layer proteins
of ATCC 367 (Q03NT3 and Q03P39) were subjected to a
number of analyses. A multiple alignment of SlpA, SlpB,
SlpC, SlpD, Q03NT3 and Q03P39 amino acid sequences
revealed significant conservation in the N-terminal
regions (see Fig. 1a and additional file 1: Multiple amino
acid sequence alignment of the L. brevis S-layer proteins).
Analysis of the distribution of the isoelectric point values
in L. brevis S-layer proteins revealed a distinction between
the N-terminal region with a high predicted pI and a Cterminal region with a low predicted pI in each of the proteins (Fig. 1c). In SlpA and SlpB the region of a high predicted pI comprises approximately two fifths of the
protein, while in SlpD and its homolog, Q03P39, as well
as in SlpC and its homolog, Q03NT3, the region of an
overall high pI extends further towards the C-terminus
and the most distinct boundary between the differently
charged regions is located around residue 260 in SlpC and
Q03NT3 and around residue 290 in SlpD and Q03P39.
Hydrophobicity analysis performed for the S-layer protein
sequences of L. brevis showed a similar distribution of
hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues along
the mature proteins with evenly alternating hydrophobic
and hydrophilic residues, as exemplified by the hydrophobicity plot of SlpA in Fig. 1b.
To predict the domain organization of SlpA, the analyses
performed were compared with similar analyses of the Slayer proteins of L. acidophilus group organisms [14]. In
each of the L. acidophilus S-layer proteins, one region is
found which is conserved, located at the C-terminus and
contains positively charged and hydrophilic sequences. In
SA of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 and CbsA of L. crispatus
JCM 5810 these domains mediate the binding to the cell

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/165

wall, while the variable N-terminal regions are responsible for the assembly of the S-layer [14,15]. In CbsA the
variable N-terminal domain is also responsible for collagen binding [42]. The only function characterized for SlpA
so far, binding to fibronectin and human epithelial cells
[18], resides in the conserved N-terminal region. However, the pattern of sequence conservation and the distribution of charge in the six L. brevis S-layer proteins
strongly suggested a domain organization similar to that
found in L. acidophilus-group S-layer proteins with the
functional domains in a reverse order.
Cloning and expression of gene sequences encoding the
mature or truncated forms of the S-layer protein SlpA and
purification of the recombinant proteins
PCR products encoding the mature SlpA and the various
N- or C-terminal SlpA truncations were cloned in E. coli
DH5αF' and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The proteins
produced are summarized in Fig 2. After induction of
expression by the addition of IPTG, samples of cultures
from E. coli BL21(DE3) were harvested and analyzed by
SDS-PAGE. On SDS-gels, each of the recombinant SlpA
proteins became visible as an additional protein band,
corresponding approximately to the calculated molecular
mass of the rSlpA proteins (data not shown). The proteins
were purified in a large scale, and total protein yields varied from 5 to 25 mg per a batch cultivation of 200 ml.
Proteolytic degradation of SlpA protein with trypsin and
peptide mapping
To gain insight to the domain structure of SlpA, wild type
SlpA was digested with trypsin. This revealed two protease
resistant fragments with apparent molecular masses of 25
kDa and 23 kDa (Fig. 3). The N-terminal sequences of
these peptides were determined to be GFSTTAG (larger
peptide) and SVTATND (smaller peptide). These correspond to amino acids starting from 190 and 209 of
mature SlpA, respectively. Peptide mass mapping of the
protease resistant fragments obtained after trypsin digestion revealed that the peptide encompassing the last 12
amino acids of full length SlpA is lacking from these fragments (data not shown). The protease resistance of the
regions 190 to 423 and 209 to 423 in mature SlpA
strongly suggested the existence of a compact domain
structure most likely representing a region exposed on the
outer surface of the S-layer.
Investigation of the self-assembly properties of the
truncated S-layer protein forms
As a preliminary test for the putative self-assembly properties of the truncated S-layer proteins, the formation of a
precipitate after dialysis from GHCl was inspected. As
shown in Fig. 2, C-terminally truncated proteins rSlpA1–
145, rSlpA1–189 and rSlpA1–290 had lost the ability to form
precipitates. N-terminally truncated forms rSlpA179–435

and rSlpA167–435 precipitated efficiently after dialysis,
while rSlpA146–435, rSlpA149–435 as well as rSlpA190–435 and
rSlpA190–423 showed a reduced precipitation. The last
twelve residues in the C-terminus of SlpA had no effect on
the precipitation, as rSlpA190–423 showed a precipitation
similar to rSlpA190–435. The removal of 209 residues or
more from the N-terminus of SlpA abolished the ability of
the truncated proteins to form precipitates.
Precipitate-forming N-terminally truncated SlpA proteins
were chosen for transmission electron microscopical analysis of lattice formation. In these studies, rSlpA formed an
oblique lattice that was identical with that formed by SlpA
isolated from wild type L. brevis ATCC 8287 cells (compare Figures 4a and 4c), as well as with the lattice seen on
L. brevis ATCC 8287 cells in the freeze-etched preparation
(Fig. 4d), proving the native conformation of recombinant SlpA. In accordance, lattice constants for the selfassembly products of rSlpA (a = 10.38, b = 6.36 and
72.7°) and for the self-assembly products of SlpA isolated
from L. brevis ATCC 8287 cells (a = 9.39, b = 6.10 and
79.8°) were practically identical. The recombinant pro-

tein SlpA179–435 (Fig. 4b) was found to form a regular,
oblique lattice indistinguishable from that formed by full
length rSlpA, but the removal of eleven residues more
from the N-terminus resulting in rSlpA190–435 prevented
lattice formation (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the two larger Nterminally truncated proteins, rSlpA167–435 and rSlpA149–
435, were unable to form regular lattice structures. Thus,
residues 179–435 in mature SlpA define the region
responsible for the crystallization of SlpA monomers.
Isolation of native cell wall fragments and binding of the
truncated S-layer proteins to cell wall fragments
Cell wall fragments were purified from a stationary phase
culture of L. brevis cells by differential centrifugation of
GHCl-treated, mechanically disrupted cells followed by
treatments with nucleases and boiling SDS as described in
Materials and methods. This method efficiently removes
membrane fragments and noncovalently bound cell wall
components like lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), but leaves covalently bound secondary cell wall polymers, like wall teichoic acids and other carbohydrates, essentially intact.
The purity of the cell wall preparation was checked by

light and transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 5). From
1.6 g of wet cells approximately 28 mg of cell wall fragments (dry weight) were recovered.
To test the hypothesis that the N-terminal, positively
charged region of SlpA is responsible for anchoring the Slayer to the cell wall, truncated recombinant SlpA-proteins encompassing the N- and C-terminal regions of SlpA
were tested for binding to isolated L. brevis cell wall fragments. As shown in Fig. 6a, full length rSlpA, rSlpA1–145
and rSlpA1–189 localized in the pellet fraction after incubation with the cell wall fragments, while rSlpA190–435 and
rSlpA167–435 were unable to bind to CWF and were found
in the supernatant. Truncated S-layer proteins incubated
alone mainly localized to the supernatant, although small
amounts were found in the pellets due to the inherent tendency of S-layer proteins to aggregate. These results are in
good accordance with our results from similar experiments with whole, LiCl-treated L. brevis ATCC 8287 and L.
acidophilus ATCC 4356 cells. In these experiments, full
length rSlpA, rSlpA1–145 and rSlpA1–189 as well as rSlpA1–
290 bound to L. brevis cells, while rSlpA190–435, rSlpA167–435
and rSlpA210–435 were unable to bind. Full-length rSlpA
and its cell wall binding fragment rSlpA1–145 also bound to
LiCl-treated L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 cells (data not
shown).

To get preliminary information about the cell wall component interacting with the N-terminal region of SlpA,
binding tests with full length rSlpA and CWF treated with
TCA at +4°C or at +37°C were performed. rSlpA bound to
CWF treated with TCA at +4°C as efficiently as to native
CWF, while the treatment of CWF with TCA at +37°C substantially reduced the binding of rSlpA (Fig. 6b). Repeated
TCA-extraction at +4°C and a change in the rSlpA: CWFratio from 1:2 to 1:1 did not change the result (data not
shown). TCA extracts carbohydrate polymers, and the
treatment at +4°C has been reported to selectively remove
teichoic acids, while the treatment at +37°C removes teichuronic acids and polysaccharides [43]. The efficiency of
the extraction was confirmed by the measurement of
organic phosphorous from native and TCA-treated CWF
as well as from the supernatant obtained in the extraction,
which indicated the loss of approximately 75% of the
organic phosphorous from the CWF by the treatment at
+4°C (data not shown). These results suggest that the
binding component in the L. brevis ATCC 8287 cell wall is
other than teichoic acid, and that cell wall components

which have previously been functionally characterized.
Two new putative S-layer proteins, Q03P39 and Q03NT3,
were identified in the recently sequenced genome of L.
brevis ATCC 367 [41] and compared with SlpA and other
L. brevis S-layer proteins characterized thus far. Q03P39 is
almost identical (99% identity) with SlpD of L. brevis
ATCC 14869 and relatively dissimilar (<40% identity)
from the SlpA, SlpB and SlpC sequences. Q03NT3 is
highly similar with SlpC of L. brevis ATCC 14869 (87%
identity) whereas not that similar with the other characterized L. brevis S-layer proteins (<44% identity). Similarity of the mature forms of the new putative S-layer
proteins or the mature forms of SlpA, SlpB, SlpC or SlpD
proteins with L. acidophilus group S-layer proteins is negligible.

extractable by TCA at +37°C, presumably polysaccharides, participate in the binding.
The amino acid sequence analysis of SlpA and other Lactobacillus brevis S-layer proteins revealed sequences in the Nterminal regions with apparent similarity to the repetitive
carbohydrate binding motifs of clostridial toxins and
streptococcal glucosyltransferases [44,45]. These regions
were found within amino acids 60–90 and 165–192 in
each of the mature proteins (Fig. 7). In the N-terminal
parts of SlpC and Q03NT3 as well as SlpD and Q03P39
additional regions with less obvious similarity were
detected as well. Similar motifs have also been detected in
the C-terminal cell wall binding regions of L. acidophilus
ATCC 4356 SA protein and L. crispatus JCM 5810 CbsA
protein as well as in the S-layer protein of L. helveticus
CNRZ 892 and in several other bacterial cell surface-associated proteins, in which they were located in two tandemly repeated sequences of 65–72 amino acids [14]. A
protein repeat analysis of the L. brevis S-layer proteins did
not indicate the presence of the carbohydrate binding
sequences in obvious repeat sequences, and despite the
similar carbohydrate binding motifs in SlpA and in L. acidophilus group S-layer proteins, the cell wall receptor of
SlpA apparently is dissimilar.

Discussion
In this study, we have identified the cell wall binding and
self-assembly domains in the S-layer protein SlpA of L.
brevis ATCC 8287, a strain phylogenetically distant from
L. acidophilus group organisms, the S-layer proteins of

Analysis of the six L. brevis S-layer protein sequences
deposited in databanks indicated the subdivision of each
sequence into two regions: a conserved N-terminal region
characterized by a high predicted pI and potential carbohydrate binding motifs, and a more variable C-terminal
region with an acidic predicted pI, with the N-terminal
region corresponding for 40–75% of the sequence
lengths. The observed high predicted overall pI values of
Lactobacillus S-layer proteins [7] thus seem to be due to the
concentration of basic amino acids to a defined region, as
is also the case in the S-layer proteins of L. acidophilus
group, which have cationic, cell wall binding C-terminal
regions.
The presence of a conserved N-terminal region with a high
predicted pI in L. brevis S-layer proteins strongly suggested
an N-terminal cell wall binding domain. This was confirmed for SlpA of L. brevis ATCC 8287 by interaction studies performed with truncated rSlpA proteins and LiCltreated L. brevis cells or isolated L. brevis cell wall fragments. In these studies, truncated proteins encompassing
the whole positively charged region of SlpA bound to the
cell wall; however, the first 145 residues in mature SlpA
contained sufficient information for cell wall binding. An
assay suitable for measuring the binding strength would
be needed to detect the putative difference between the
cell wall binding affinities of SlpA1–145 and SlpA1–189. In Slayer proteins of lactobacilli, no SLH motifs have been
detected. Instead, interactions between a positively
charged S-layer protein region and negatively charged secondary cell wall polymers have been shown to mediate
the cell wall binding in the case of SA of L. acidophilus
ATCC 4356 [46] and CbsA of L. crispatus JCM 5810 [41].
SA and CbsA were shown to bind teichoic acids, and CbsA
bound also to lipoteichoic acids purified from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, but not to the teichuronic acid/polysaccharide fraction of the cell wall of L.
crispatus JCM 5810. In contrast, the results of this study
suggest the involvement of another cell wall structure

between SlpA and the cell wall, as the purification process
of the CWF used efficiently removed LTAs, and the extraction of CWF with TCA at +4°C to remove teichoic acids
had no effect on the binding of SlpA.
The chemical nature of the cell wall component interacting with the S-layer protein has been determined in Geobacillus stearothermophilus strains [47-49], in Lysinibacillus
sphaericus [50] and in Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus [6].
In G. stearothermophilus and L. sphaericus S-layers, which
possess SLH-domains, the component is a pyruvylated

GlcNac and GalNac-containing polysaccharide not groupable as a teichoic or lipoteichoic acid. In other G. stearothermophilus strains the component is a negatively charged
mannuronic acid-containing cell wall polymer, and in A.
thermoaerophilus the cell wall receptor is a neutral biantennary oligosaccharide.
The secondary cell wall polymers of lactobacilli are poorly
characterized. The detailed structure of a wall polysaccharide of L. casei has been determined [51], but no precise
structures for polysaccharides of L. brevis strains are available at present. In early studies, the cell walls of L. buchneri

Figure 7 of the N-terminal regions of L. brevis S-layer proteins with carbohydrate binding motifs
Similarity
Similarity of the N-terminal regions of L. brevis S-layer proteins with carbohydrate binding motifs. The motifs
were determined by Wren [45] and von Eichel-Streiber et al [44]. In the consensus sequences upper case letters indicate highly
conserved residues [44] or residues with an identity of 50% or higher [45]. X, variable residue. A broken underline indicates
potential carbohydrate-binding motifs at different locations: YFRAYG of SlpA corresponds to YFDxNG of the consensus
sequence of Ref [44]; KAYRGW of SlpB corresponds to KAVTGW of the consensus sequences of References [44] and [45];
LSNKSYY of SlpD and Q03P39 corresponds to IDGkwYY of the consensus sequence of Ref [44].

[52] and L. brevis ATCC 8287 [53] were shown to contain
neutral polysaccharides, which were suggested to be
involved in the anchoring of the S-layer protein to the cell
wall through hydrogen bonding [54,55]. These results are
in agreement with the data presented in this study, which
suggest a non-teichoic acid polysaccharide, either neutral
or anionic, involved in the cell wall binding of SlpA, but
the detailed structure of this polysaccharide remains to be
elucidated.
Interestingly, despite the fact that polysaccharides rather
than (lipo)teichoic acids of L. brevis ATCC 8287 are
involved in the cell wall binding of SlpA, the C-terminal
cell wall binding region of the S-layer protein CbsA of L.
crispatus JCM 5810 bound to GHCl-treated L. brevis ATCC
8287 cells [15]. Using the same experimental design we
showed that rSlpA and its cell wall binding fragment
rSlpA1–145 bind to LiCl-treated L. acidophilus ATCC 4356
cells. The interaction between the S-layer protein and the
secondary cell wall component is supposed to be lectinlike and highly specific [56], and in artificial experimental

procedures the lack of a specific interaction between two
complementary surfaces may be masked by unspecific
charge interactions with lower affinity. To obtain information about specific interactions, competition experiments
with fragments of SA, CbsA and SlpA and the corresponding bacterial strains, or direct determinations of the KD
values of the interactions, e. g. by surface plasmon resonance studies, are needed.
Amino acid sequence analysis of the L. brevis S-layer proteins revealed motifs with similarity to repeated C-terminal carbohydrate binding sequences detected in clostridial
toxins, streptococcal glucosyltransferases and the S-layer
proteins of L. acidophilus group organisms [14,44,45].
These motifs are supposed to play a general role in protein-carbohydrate interactions by acting as initial attachment sites and thus enabling the specific interactions to
occur [44] and may thus be partly responsible for the
observed positive cross-binding results between SlpA and
L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 cells, and between the cell wall
binding domain of CbsA and L. brevis ATCC 8287 cells

(see above). The sequences of the potential L. brevis carbohydrate-binding motifs deviated to some extent from the
consensus sequences determined for clostridial toxins and
streptococcal transferases [44,45]. The divergence of the
sequences in distantly related organisms and different
macromolecular structures is apparently allowed as long
as the basic function of the motif, bringing the interacting
partners to initial contact, is preserved.
The self-assembly domain of SlpA was shown to comprise
residues 179–435 in mature SlpA, as truncated proteins
encompassing this region were able to form a periodic
structure indistinguishable from that formed by full
length SlpA, as detected by electron microscopy. The
length of the truncated protein was critical, since rSlpA167–
435 and rSlpA149–435 as well as N-terminal truncations
shorter than rSlpA179–435 were unable to form regular lattices. Apparently, the region, or part of the region, encompassing amino acids 149–178 disturbs the lattice
formation of the truncated proteins either by steric hindrance and/or by preventing the acquisition of a native
conformation. Trypsin degradation experiments revealed
two protease resistant peptides encompassing residues
190–423 and 209–423 in mature SlpA supporting the
hypothesis about a morphologically separate, compact Cterminal unit, which most probably corresponds to the
round, periodically arranged structures seen in electron
microscope pictures of self-assembly products of SlpA
(Fig. 4). Similar trypsin degradation experiments with
whole L. brevis cells resulted in identical fragments but at
a very low efficiency (data not shown), indicating poor
accessibility of the enzyme to the N-terminal domain
through the pores in the S-layer, and further supporting
the presumption about a protease sensitive, more flexible
N-terminal domain shielded from the environment
beneath the C-terminal self-assembly domain. A proteaseresistant, surface-located self-assembly domain has also
been observed in the N-terminal part of the S-layer protein SA of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 [14]. The results of the
present study are supported by the report of Hynönen et al
[18], in which an antiserum specific for the recombinant
peptide SlpA66–215, originating from the cell wall binding
region, was not able to recognize polymerized SlpA on
Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 8287 cells. In the same report,
whole S-layered L. brevis ATCC 8287 cells as well as the Nterminal part of SlpA, residues 66–146 of mature SlpA in
minimum, were shown to bind to immobilized fibronectin. Fibronectin is highly glycosylated, and the binding of
fibronectin to a region of SlpA shielded beneath the C-terminal domain may be explained by an interaction
between the protruding oligosaccharide moieties of
fibronectin and the identified N-terminal carbohydrate
binding sequences of SlpA. In this respect the identification of human blood group A-trisaccharide as the receptor
for the S-layer protein of a human L. brevis isolate [57] is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/165

of interest, especially considering that the nine N-terminal
amino acids of the S-layer protein of this strain were identical with the N-terminus of SlpA.

Conclusion
In this work SlpA of L. brevis ATCC 8287 was shown to be
a two-modular protein in which the domains responsible
for the self-assembly (C-terminal) and cell wall binding
(N-terminal) are located in a reverse order compared to
those in all other Lactobacillus S-layer proteins characterized thus far, reflecting the unrelatedness of SlpA with previously characterized Lactobacillus S-layer proteins. The
study confirms the role of conserved, repeated, general
carbohydrate binding sequences in the cell wall binding
domains of Lactobacillus S-layer proteins, but in contrast
to the Lactobacillus acidophilus-group organisms, the specific cell wall component interacting with the S-layer protein in L. brevis ATCC 8287 was shown to be other than
(lipo)teichoic acid. As SlpA is a potential tool for mucosal
immunization, the data presented in this study forms a
basis for further studies concerning vaccine development.
The mapping of surface exposed residues in the selfassembly domain of SlpA is currently in progress.
