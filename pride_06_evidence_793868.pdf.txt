Abstract
Background: Virus taxonomy is based on morphologic characteristics, as there are no widely
used non-phenotypic measures for comparison among virus families. We examined whether there
is phylogenetic signal in virus nucleotide usage patterns that can be used to determine ancestral
relationships. The well-studied model of tail morphology in bacteriophage classification was used
for comparison with nucleotide usage patterns. Tetranucleotide usage deviation (TUD) patterns
were chosen since they have previously been shown to contain phylogenetic signal similar to that
of 16S rRNA.
Results: We found that bacteriophages have unique TUD patterns, representing genomic
signatures that are relatively conserved among those with similar host range. Analysis of TUDbased phylogeny indicates that host influences are important in bacteriophage evolution, and
phylogenies containing both phages and their hosts support their co-evolution. TUD-based
phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses indicates that they cluster largely based on nucleic acid type and
genome size. Similarities between eukaryotic virus phylogenies based on TUD and gene content
substantiate the TUD methodology.
Conclusion: Differences between phenotypic and TUD analysis may provide clues to virus
ancestry not previously inferred. As such, TUD analysis provides a complementary approach to
morphology-based systems in analysis of virus evolution.

Background
Eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages exist in numerous
forms and are capable of infecting disparate hosts. The
taxonomy of viruses is based upon morphological features, including capsid and tail structures, specific type of
genetic material, and mechanism of replication and

assembly [1,2]. Genetic comparison across virus species
has been complicated by generally different rates of gene
evolution, thus, their overall classification rests on phenotypic and morphologic characteristics [3]. Horizontal
gene transfer has been substantial in virus evolution [4-7],
complicating reproduction of ontogeny based on the curPage 1 of 13

morphology forms the basis for bacteriophage classification into 3 separate families: Myoviridae (contractile
tails), Podoviridae (short tail stubs), and Siphoviridae
(long tails) [1]. Studies examining phage tail assemblies
[11] have not ascertained whether the source of tail characteristics has phylogenetic significance, indicating the
likely existence of polyphylogeny within these phage
groups
[12].

rent presence of particular loci. Analysis of phylogenies
based on phenotypic systems is limited by convergent
evolution, in which like characteristics are evolved by
unrelated organisms to suit particular niches or evolutionary requirements [8]. Taxonomy of bacteriophages also
has been based on morphologic characteristics [9,10]. Tail

Unlike viruses, prokaryotes most commonly have been
taxonomically classified according to a single locus, 16S
rRNA [13-15]. Because of its relatively conservative rate of
evolution, and presumed rarity of horizontal transfer due
to its functional constraints, the 16S rRNA locus is
believed to serve as an accurate marker of recent common
ancestry [15].
Evaluation of prokaryotic ancestry based on shared gene
content also has been proposed, guided by the principle
that prokaryotes have cores of essential genes, whose presence or absence is evolutionarily significant [16-18]. Alternatively, there has been analysis of phylogenetic signal in
whole-genome nucleotide usage patterns and is consistent
with the predicted phylogenetic structure of prokaryotes
based on 16S rRNA [19]. Whole-genome approaches are
less biased by any single locus [20], with horizontal transfer being an intrinsic part of the signal, reflecting the current. Using Zero-Order Markov algorithms, we have
previously demonstrated that patterns of tetranucleotide
usage patterns retain phylogenetic signal among many
related prokaryotes [19]. Differences between tetranucleotide usage and 16S rRNA in ancestral reconstruction
likely are due to horizontal influences, such as extensive
recombination, and/or presence of restriction/modification systems.
We sought to better understand the evolution of viruses
by comparing methods for reproducing ancestry including tetranucleotide usage deviation, and shared gene content to construct a framework independent of phenotypic
analysis. Our goals were to understand whether: 1) phylogenetic signal is retained in nucleotide usage patterns of
viruses; 2) phylogenetic structures based on nucleotide
usage patterns and tail morphology are similar; 3) nucleotide usage patterns in viruses are primarily determined
by gene content; and 4) whether their prokaryotic hosts
exert a substantial influence on bacteriophage nucleotide
usage patterns.

Results
Conservation of tetranucleotide usage patterns across
bacteriophage genomes
Nucleotide usage patterns are unique among different
prokaryotes, providing distinct signatures [19,21,22] that
are well-conserved across each genome, except for DNA

hypothesized to be acquired through lateral gene transfer
[23,24]. To determine whether bacteriophages have
unique genomic signatures, we employed a method based
on tetranucleotide usage deviations (TUD) from expected.
TUD patterns have substantially more phylogenetic signal
than codon usage biases when compared to 16S rRNA
[19]. We generated TUD based on Zero-Order Markov
algorithms, which determine how patterns of tetranucleotide usage in each genome deviate from those expected
based on overall nucleotide content, representing the
genomic signature [19,25]. Zero-order Markov algorithms
were chosen, as removal of constituent oligonucleotide
biases (e.g. dinucleotide and trinucleotide biases) through
Markov chain analysis results in a substantial loss of TUD
phylogenetic
signal
[19].

To determine whether TUD patterns are conserved, we
measured TUD profiles across representative bacteriophage genomes, comparing each portion tested against
the genome mean [24]. The patterns of tetranucleotide
usage are relatively well-conserved across all bacteriophages studied [see Additional file 1], with examples
provided for Haemophilus phage HP1 (Figure 1a), Burkholderia phage 781 (Figure 1b), and Enterobacteriaphage Mu
(Figure 1c). The relatively small variation in patterns of
nucleotide usage across phage genomes indicates that
mean genome nucleotide usage patterns can be considered representative as a first-order approximation. TUD
profiles of all phage genomes combined follows a normal
distribution (Figure 2a), which further supports that tetranucleotide usage patterns are well-conserved across each
bacteriophage studied.

Frequency distribution of DNA tetranucleotide usage profiles of selected bacteriophages. The observed/expected
TUD was determined for the 256 tetranucleotide combinations for each genome, as described in Materials and Methods. The resulting values were sorted within 0.25 intervals
and the ordinate represents the number of tetranucleotide
combinations within each interval. Panel A: Blue – All bacteriophages studied. Panel B: Red – Enterobacteria phage HK022
(Siphoviridae), Green – Enterobacteria phage P2 (Myoviridae), Blue – Shigella phage V (Podoviridae). Panel C: Red –
Enterobacteria phage HK022, Green – Mycobacterium phage
Bxz1 (Myoviridae), Blue – Mycobacterium phage Corndog
(Siphoviridae).

We next sought to determine whether the TUD distribution across each bacteriophage genome is unique, representing a genomic signature. Highly similar yet distinct
TUD profiles were shown for Enterobacteria phage P2
(Myoviridae), Enterobacteria phage HK022 (Siphoviridae), and Shigella phage V (Podoviridae) (Figure 2b).
However, within a bacteriophage family, TUD patterns are
not strictly conserved, as demonstrated by the lack of similarity between Mycobacterium phage Bxz1 and Enterobacteria phage HK022 (both Siphoviridae) (Figure 2c). These
data are an indication that each phage genome has unique
patterns of nucleotide usage that are not strictly determined by tail characteristics.
Comparison of tetranucleotide usage patterns between
bacteriophage genomes
Comparison of TUD profiles by linear regression analysis
reveals that phages with comparable host range have similar patterns. Enterobacteria phage HK022 is more closely
related in TUD to Enterobacteria phage P2 (R2 = 0.649;
Figure 3a) than to Mycobacterium phage Bxz1 (R2 = 0.067;
Figure 3b). A parallel relationship is shown by comparing

Burkholderia cepaciae phage 1 with Burkholderia cepaciae
phage 781 (R2 = 0.980), and with "closely related" Bordetella phage BIP-1 (R2 = 0.561). The two Enterobacteria
phages (Figure 3a) share high level TUD similarity despite
different tail morphology; results are parallel for Streptococcus phages (R2 = 0.559; Figure 3c) and for Mycobacterium phages (R2 = 0.741; Figure 3d). These representative
examples show that TUD patterns may not be predicted
by tail morphology, suggesting that family classification
in bacteriophages is not phylogenetically robust.
Bacteriophage tetranucleotide phylogeny
TUD patterns in prokaryotes have phylogenetic content
similar to that of 16S rRNA [19]. Since our initial analysis
indicated that TUD patterns are shared among bacteriophages with similar host range, we examined TUD-based
phage phylogenetic structure to determine host-range
influence on evolutionary relationships. Phylogenies
based on TUD patterns were generated assuming that phylogenetic structure would be predicted by host range, tail
morphology, a combination of both, or essentially be random. Compared with randomly generated phylogenies,
TUD phylogenies (Figure 4) show a distinct, non-random
pattern (Figure 5). With few exceptions, of the 83 test
phages, TUD phylogenies have the following structure: 1)
phages that parasitize gram-negative Enterobacteria
(including Escherichia, Shigella, Klebsiella, Yersinia, Salmonella, and Vibrio) cluster together; 2) phages related to
gram-positive cocci (including Staphyloccus, Streptococcus,
and Lactococcus phages) cluster together, 3) phages related
to gram-negative non-enterobacteria (including Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Bordetella phages) cluster together,
and 4) phages related to gram-positive bacilli (including
Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Mycobacterium, and Streptomyces) do
not cluster. The observed clustering does not associate
with tail morphology.
Host-bacteriophage tetranucleotide phylogeny
Since TUD-based phage phylogeny appears closely associated with host range, we determined the phylogenetic
structure of bacteriophages together with their host bacteria. Nucleotide usage patterns in both bacteriophages and
prokaryotes represent genomic signatures that can be
compared across organisms in genome size-independent
analysis [19,20]. With few exceptions, phages cluster near
their host organisms, as is demonstrated by the close relationships with the Enterobacteria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Bordetella,
Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Streptomyces, and Mycobacteria
(Figure 6). The phylogeny is consistent with a model of
host-phage co-evolution, but is inconsistent with phage
evolution based on tail morphology. Exceptions to the
model include Bacillus phages PZA and GA-1, Pseudomonas phage Phi KMV, and several Enterobacteria

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/8

phages that cluster independent of presumed host (Figure
6).
Eukaryotic virus TUD phylogeny
Eukaryotic virus taxonomy also has been based on morphologic characteristics [2]. Since phage TUD phylogeny
demonstrates substantial host influences (Figure 6), we
determined eukaryotic virus TUD-based phylogeny using
representative species to determine phylogenetic structure. Based on TUD patterns, eukaryotic viruses are associated based on family, size, and type of genetic material
(Figure 7). Important trends include: 1) the single
stranded RNA viruses cluster together, with the exception
of togaviruses and coronaviruses; 2) within the RNA
viruses, picornoviruses cluster with the exception of foot
and mouth virus, and paramyxoviruses cluster with the
exception of RSV; 3) segmented RNA viruses including
orthomyxoviruses and arenaviruses cluster; 4) small double stranded DNA viruses cluster, but are separate from
large double stranded DNA viruses; 5) polyomaviruses
cluster with retroviruses in the group of small double
stranded DNA viruses; 6) large double stranded DNA
viruses, including bacteriophages cluster; and 7) single
stranded DNA viruses including parvoviruses cluster variably. In summary, these data suggest that phylogenetic
signal exists in the virus TUD patterns, but to variable
extents in different virus groups.
Gene content phylogeny of eukaryotic viruses
For prokaryotes, phylogeny based on gene content also
approximates that of 16S rRNA [17]. We determined the
phylogeny of the representative eukaryotic viruses based
on gene content as an independent measure of virus evolution, hypothesizing that closely related viruses share
more gene content [16,26]. The eukaryotic viruses tested
cluster in a pattern similar to those based on TUD (Figure
7), but with important differences (Figure 8). DNA viruses
cluster on the top portion of the derived phylogeny, retroviruses share a more central position, and RNA viruses
cluster on the lower portion with the exception of the
coronaviruses. Phylogeny based on gene content appears
more robust than TUD phylogeny for the positive-sense
RNA viruses, both large and small DNA viruses, single
stranded DNA viruses, and retroviruses, which cluster separately from the small DNA viruses.

Discussion
As greater numbers of prokaryote and virus genomes are
solved, genomic signatures have become better defined.
Prokaryotes have genomic signatures that contain phylogenetic signal at both the dinucleotide [25] and tetranucleotide [19] levels. Our data indicate the existence of
genomic signature in viruses parasitizing prokaryotic and
eukaryotic hosts. Because genomic signature analysis is
based on whole-genomes and is independent of multiple

alignments, it provides a robust methodology for comparison across and between prokaryotes and viruses.
We show that bacteriophage genomic signatures are associated with their host organisms with few notable exceptions (Figure 6). This is most likely the effect of coevolution between host and parasite, in which the host
influences phage nucleotide usage patterns and possibly
vice versa [25]. Indeed, both phage and host avoid use of
certain tetranucleotides recognized by host restriction/
modification systems [19]. The close approximation, but
not complete identity of phage TUD patterns to those of
host organisms supports a co-evolution model (Figure 6).
We hypothesize that the differences reflect limitations in

the ability of phages to adapt to host TUD patterns, and/
or that phages need to retain particular TUD patterns to
maintain host range.
An alternative explanation for bacteriophage TUD patterns is that their approximation to their hosts results
from amelioration [27], and does not reflect recent common ancestry. Obligate parasitism likely necessitates that
phages ameliorate to host nucleotide usage patterns,
which is why host range may be critical. Bacteriophage
phylogenetics based on shared gene content is dissimilar
to that based on TUD, but not consistent with taxonomy
based on morphologic features [26]. The differences
between the methods likely reflect biases, with TUD phy-

logeny biased by amelioration, and gene content phylogeny biased by lateral gene transfer.
Horizontal gene transfer from host to phage produces
apparent similarity to host nucleotide usage patterns that
mechanistically does not represent recent common ancestry [28]. If horizontal transfer from host to phage served

as the predominant mechanism of phage evolution, Mycobacterium phage TUD patterns would closely reflect their
hosts. In the Mycobacterium phages, where horizontal
acquisition is common [7], phage TUD patterns more
closely approximate each other than their prokaryote
hosts (Figure 6), which supports host-phage evolution in
parallel, but not their evolution through horizontal gene

is T7-like, with many known similarities at the genetic
level [29], further suggesting their phylogenetic distinctness. The Bacillus phages are Phi29-like phages, which in
addition to lack of shared ancestry with other Bacillus
phages (Figure 4), have T7-like polymerases [30], supporting their recent ancestry with T7-like phages. Each of these
phage groups has substantial strand bias [31], indicating
their unique differences compared to other phage groups,
and likely evolutionary distance.

transfer. That nucleotide usage patterns are relatively
homogenous across each phage genome (Figure 1), suggests that the proportion of horizontally transferred genes
in phage genomes may be relatively small or subject to
rapid amelioration, and substantiates a parallel model of
host-phage evolution. In phages with known transposons
such as Enterobacteria phage Mu, these elements are not
identified as anomalous in the phage genome (Figure 1c),
suggesting that transposons are not responsible for the
observed similarity in nucleotide usage patterns between
host and phage.
Our data on bacteriophage phylogenies (Figure 5) directly
oppose conceiving of morphological characteristics for
understanding phage ancestry. Based on a TUD-based
model of evolution, tail characteristics would have been
horizontally transferred, subject to variable rates of evolution, or be continuously altered with little phylogenetic
significance. Conversely, for a model of ancestry based on
tail morphology to be correct, patterns of nucleotide
usage would have to had shifted continuously throughout
phage evolution independent of host. The substantial
relationships between phage and host TUD (Figure 6)
make independent evolution highly unlikely. Exceptions
to the model of host-phage co-evolution presented by
Podoviruses Bacillus phages PZA and GA-1, Pseudomonas
putida phage GH-1, and a few Enterobacteria phages could
be explained by broad host range, accelerated rates of
change with loss of TUD phylogenetic signal, or alternate
replication strategies. Each of these Enterobacteria phages

TUD phylogenetics support co-evolution of host and bacteriophage, however, eukaryotic viruses cluster similar as
expected based on recognized genetic and morphological
features [1,2]. Bovine viruses (e.g. bovine RSV, papillomavirus, coronavirus, parvovirus, and polyomavirus) cluster
independent of host, indicating that factors other than
host influences determine their phylogenetic position
(Figure 7). That coronaviruses do not belong to the major
RNA virus cluster (Figures 7 and 8), contrary to previous
studies [32], suggests that TUD may not be robust for certain RNA viruses. Most of the negative-sense RNA viruses
cluster with the exception of RSV and the segmented RNA
viruses. The clustering of RSV with rhinoviruses may represent convergent evolution or allelic exchange, as they
occupy a similar ecological niche. The phylogenetic position of the segmented RNA viruses including orthomyxoviruses, arenaviruses, and reoviruses supports the concept
of a common progenitor (Figure 7). The TUD analysis
shows separate grouping of the large and small double
stranded DNA viruses, which may be a limitation of the
technique or reflect the occurrence of double stranded
DNA more than once in the ancestral history of viruses.
Bacteriophages cluster with the eukaryotic double
stranded DNA viruses, further suggesting a single progenitor for the large double stranded DNA viruses. Whether
the polyphylogeny observed among the large and small
DNA viruses, the positive-sense RNA viruses, and the single stranded DNA viruses reflect methodologic limitations
or evolutionarily significant phenomena remains to be
determined. Phylogeny based on gene content, in which
polyphylogeny among each group of viruses is diminished, supports the former hypothesis (Figure 8).

Conclusion
Morphological features form one basis for virus taxonomy, however we provide data that suggests bacteriophage tail characteristics may not sufficiently reflect their
evolution. Based on TUD patterns, phages are co-evolving
with their hosts in a manner defined by their ability to
achieve broad host range. That there are only few exceptions to the co-evolution model concerning the many
phages analyzed, substantiates that phylogenetic signal
exists in phage TUD patterns. The TUD methodology is
easily reproducible, alignment-independent, affected by
lateral gene transfer in proportion to the extents of trans-

such, TUD phylogeny should be considered complementary to other systems for analysis of virus evolution.

Methods
Virus, phage, and microbial genomes
Complete genome sequences of the phages [see Additional file 1], viruses [see Additional file 2], and bacteria
studied were obtained from Genbank [33,34].
Analysis of tetranucleotides
Tetranucleotides were selected for study because analysis
of higher-order oligonucleotides was not possible given
the limitation in virus genome sizes. We based our minimum genome sequence length on the assumption that
95% of tetranucleotide combinations should occur at
least 10 times [31]. Our calculated minimum length was
5 kb based on analysis of concatenated genome strands
designed to eliminate strand bias. The minimum genome
length analyzed in this study was 4.7 kb (9.4 kb when analyzing both strands), while analysis of pentanucleotides
would have required a minimum genome length of 20 kb.
To determine the tetranucleotide usage deviations from
expected (TUD) among prokaryotic genomes, a ZeroOrder Markov algorithm [35] was used, which involves
determining the expected number of tetranucleotides by
removing biases in mononucleotide frequencies, as is
determined by the equation: E(W) = [(Aa * Cc * Gg * Tt) *
N], where A, C, G, and T represent the frequency of the
four nucleotides within the window being evaluated,
respectively, a, c, g, and t represent the number of nucleotides A, C, G, and T in each tetranucleotide, respectively,
and N represents the length of the genome being evaluated. The frequency of divergence for each tetranucleotide
is expressed as the ratio of observed to expected, and the
TUD profiles for all tetranucleotides determined for each
organism studied using Swaap 1.0.1 [36], and their relative abundance between genomes compared by linear
regression analysis.
Tetranucleotide difference index
Tetranucleotide differences in each genome were determined using Markov chain analysis [37], by determining
the expected oligonucleotide word frequency by removing
the biases existing in component oligonucleotides. W =
(w1w2...wm) denotes the word formed by the concatenation of m nucleotides, and N(W) is its observed count in
a sequence of length n, as described [24]. The expected
count E(W) of W is:

E(W) = N(w1w2...wm-1)N(w2w3...wm)/N(w2w3...wm-1).
The frequency of the word F(W) is expressed as the ratio
of the observed O(W) to the expected E(W). F(W) can be
determined for all windows Fw(W) of specified size within

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/8

dow are measured by the expression:

∑ j F(W) − Fw (W) ,
i

where i - j represent all tetranucleotide combinations. The
tetranucleotide difference index represents the difference
between each window and the mean difference for all
windows. Z-scores were determined for each window
using the equation Z = (x - µ)/σ, where x represents the
tetranucleotide difference for the window being evaluated, µ represents the mean tetranucleotide differences for
all windows, and σ represents the standard deviation of
all windows. Those windows differing from the mean by
± 3 Z-scores were defined as significant, and were determined using Swaap 1.0.1 [36].
Phylogenetic analysis
Distances based on TUD were determined: Dt = 1/44 * ∑
|F1(W) - F2(W)|, where F1(W)and F2(W) represent F(W)
for each of the 256 tetranucleotides for any organisms 1
and 2 [19,38], which represents the Euclidean distance
between 2 vectors in 256 space. Bootstraping was performed by sampling with replacement of each of the 256
tetranucleotide frequencies using Swaap PH 1.0.1 [39],
and phylograms created based on distance matrices using
Phylip 3.5 [40], reviewed via Treeview [41], and displayed
using midpoint rooting with Paup 4.0b10 [42].

Phylogeny based on gene content was determined using
methodology similar to that described [17]. Shared genes
between genomes were determined using an operational
definition of orthology. Briefly, all genes within each
genome examined were added to a BLAST database, and
each genome then was compared at the amino acid level
against the database using a BLAST threshold value, E =
0.01. The resulting number of orthologues were tabulated
for each pair of viruses compared, and distances were
expressed as one minus the percent of shared genes
between each genome. Data tabulation and distance
matrices were generated using Swaap PH 1.0.1 [39]. Phylogenies were constructed based on distance matrices
using Paup 4.0b10 [42].
Analysis of congruence among phylogenetic trees
Analysis of congruence among the gene phylograms was
performed on consensus trees, and 1000 trees created
with random topology. Differences in log likelihood (∆-ln
L) were computed between phylograms based on TUD
phylogenies and 1000 random trees. Differences in ∆-ln L
for random phylograms can be considered as the null distribution, obtained when there is no more similarity in
topology than expected by chance. If the ∆-ln L values for
comparisons among the phylograms are within the 99th
percentile of the null distribution, then the topologies are
significantly different, and thus incongruent [43].
