Abstract
Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharide/s (LPS) are frequently cited in the cyanobacteria literature as
toxins responsible for a variety of heath effects in humans, from skin rashes to gastrointestinal,
respiratory and allergic reactions. The attribution of toxic properties to cyanobacterial LPS dates
from the 1970s, when it was thought that lipid A, the toxic moiety of LPS, was structurally and
functionally conserved across all Gram-negative bacteria. However, more recent research has
shown that this is not the case, and lipid A structures are now known to be very different,
expressing properties ranging from LPS agonists, through weak endotoxicity to LPS antagonists.
Although cyanobacterial LPS is widely cited as a putative toxin, most of the small number of formal
research reports describe cyanobacterial LPS as weakly toxic compared to LPS from the
Enterobacteriaceae.
We systematically reviewed the literature on cyanobacterial LPS, and also examined the much lager
body of literature relating to heterotrophic bacterial LPS and the atypical lipid A structures of some
photosynthetic bacteria. While the literature on the biological activity of heterotrophic bacterial
LPS is overwhelmingly large and therefore difficult to review for the purposes of exclusion, we
were unable to find a convincing body of evidence to suggest that heterotrophic bacterial LPS, in
the absence of other virulence factors, is responsible for acute gastrointestinal, dermatological or
allergic reactions via natural exposure routes in humans.
There is a danger that initial speculation about cyanobacterial LPS may evolve into orthodoxy
without basis in research findings. No cyanobacterial lipid A structures have been described and
published to date, so a recommendation is made that cyanobacteriologists should not continue to
attribute such a diverse range of clinical symptoms to cyanobacterial LPS without research
confirmation.

Introduction
Cyanobacterial LPS is attributed with a range of pathological effects in humans, from gastro-intestinal illness, cutaneous signs and symptoms, allergy, respiratory disease,

headache and fever. This review will present the studies of
cyanobacterial LPS, and will attempt to place the knowledge of these products within the broader understanding
of LPS from Gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria. The

paper will present an overview of the mechanisms of toxicity of Gram-negative bacterial LPS, discussing the history
of its discovery and the present perception of its pathogenicity.
Cyanobacterial LPS and symptoms in humans
Table 1 lists some of the signs and symptoms reportedly
associated with exposure to cyanobacterial LPS, and references that imply particular symptoms or symptom groups
are explained by such exposures. Table 1 does not present
an exhaustive list of citations implicating cyanobacterial
LPS with human illness. Many such references are found
in review articles, and the table does not include citations
which discuss cyanobacterial LPS in the context of cyanobacterial toxins without linking them to specific illnesses
– e.g. "Cyanobacterial toxins are of three main types:
lipopolysaccharide endotoxins, hepatotoxins, and neurotoxins." [1]; "Potential irritant; affects any exposed tissue"
[2,3]; "(LPS) are responsible for the irritant nature of

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

cyanobacterial material" [4]; and "...toxicants such
as...lipopolysaccharide endotoxins...affect any exposed
tissue..." [5].
Several authors note that the health implications of
cyanobacterial LPS are poorly understood and the topic
requires more research [6-15]. Only one reference was
found in the cyanobacteria literature that raises doubts
about illness caused by cyanobacterial LPS: Carmichael
[16] suggests that the relationship between ingested LPS
and illness in an immunologically competent population
is debatable, there being little evidence that people with a
normal LPS-containing gut flora would be affected by LPS
from water supplies.
The relationship between cyanobacterial LPS and illness is
discussed in language ranging from cautious: "...may be
responsible..." [17], "possibly (due to) lipopolysaccharides" [15], to definitive: "dermatotoxins" [18] and "der-

matotoxic lipopolysaccharides" [19,20]. Cyanobacterial
LPS has also been implicated as the cause of an outbreak
of pyrogenic reactions in a haemodialysis clinic in 1974
[21].
The references in the literature to the association between
cyanobacterial LPS and this rather diverse range of symptoms are not based on any research evidence specific to
cyanobacterial LPS. As will be discussed later in this
review, the few toxicological investigations that have been
carried out to date are mostly limited to the end-points of
lethality and the local Shwartzman reaction, in which
sequential subcutaneous and intravenous injections of
LPS produce a dermonecrotic lesion in rabbit skin. Rather,
symptomatology attributed to contact with cyanobacterial
LPS appears to be something of a default diagnosis for illnesses that are not otherwise explained by the current
knowledge of cyanobacterial exotoxins, most of which are
somewhat specific to their target organ system.
The most likely explanation for the ready attribution of
these illnesses to cyanobacterial LPS lies in the realisation
that LPS from Gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria are
implicated in significant morbidity – and mortality – so
cyanobacteria, which are widely but somewhat inaccurately accepted as Gram-negative bacteria may equally be
responsible for illness because they contain LPS. Codd
makes such a proposition, suggesting that: "The LPS of
other bacteria are associated with gastroenteritis and
inflammation problems and it is thought that cyanobacterial LPS may contribute to waterborne health incidents
although this possibility has not been adequately investigated" [13].
There is a risk that speculative attribution of symptoms in
humans to environmental exposure to cyanobacterial LPS
will continue without an appropriate and specific research
foundation. This review will attempt to examine more
closely the mechanisms by which LPS from Gram-negative heterotrophic bacteria is associated with morbidity,
and compare and contrast cyanobacterial LPS and heterotrophic bacterial LPS.
Cyanobacteria: Gram-negative or Gram-positive?
Most references to cyanobacteria describe these organisms
as Gram-negative prokaryotes [17,22-26]. Weckesser et al
[27] state that the presence of LPS is evidence for the
Gram-negative cell wall architecture of cyanobacteria.
However, Weckesser et al [28] reported that a strain of
Anabaena variabilis they investigated was Gram-positive,
"like other blue-green algae...". Drews [29] also classifies
cyanobacteria as Gram-positive. Golecki [30] reviewed
electron microscopy studies of the cell wall architecture of
various bacteria, and suggested that cyanobacteria have
characteristics of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

organisms. They contain an outer membrane and LPS,
which are defining characteristics of Gram-negative bacteria [31,32], and a thick, highly cross-linked peptidoglycan
layer similar to Gram-positive organisms. Jürgens &
Weckesser [33] and Golecki [30] suggest that the chemical
and structural organisation of the cell wall may place
cyanobacteria in a separate phylogenetic category to both
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, with cyanobacteria developing independently of Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria from a common ancestor. However, according to Margulis & Schwartz [34], electron
microscopy shows that cyanobacteria have Gram-negative
cell walls.
Terminology: "endotoxin" in the cyanobacteria literature
While most references to endotoxin in the cyanobacteria
literature (e.g. those in Table 1) are clearly referring to
LPS, i.e. cell wall structural components, this is not always
the case. Several authors discuss "endotoxins" when they
were obviously describing the toxic properties of microcystins [35-41]. Kay [42] refers to aphantoxin (now
known as saxitoxins) from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae as an
"alkaloid endotoxin". Gentile & Maloney [43] also
labelled what were presumably saxitoxins as an endotoxin. In recent years cyanobacterial hepatotoxins and
neurotoxins are still being described as endotoxins
[44,45]. This misunderstanding of the nomenclature is
also seen in biotoxin research fields outside of cyanobacteria, with brevetoxins described as endotoxins [46].
Immunologists clearly understand endotoxins to refer
only to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria. The reader's attention is drawn to this distinction, as throughout this review
"endotoxin" and "LPS" are used more or less interchangeably, whereas other cyanobacterial toxins such as microcystins, cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxins and anatoxin-a,
when discussed in aggregate are referred to as "exotoxins".
The history of the term "endotoxin" and its current use are
discussed in the following section.
Gram-negative bacterial LPS: introduction and its
discovery
LPS from many bacterial species will initiate acute inflammatory responses in mammals that are typical of the host
reaction to tissue injury or infection [47]. LPS can induce
a large and diverse range of effects, ranging from pyrexia
to Gram-negative septic shock, which manifests as a complex and dramatic syndrome involving fever, leucopoenia,
hypotension, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-system failure
[48,49].

The history of the understanding of LPS starts in the late
nineteenth century, when Richard Pfeiffer used heat-inactivated lysates of Vibrio cholerae to provoke pathophysiological effects in guinea pigs [48]. Pfeiffer named the heat-

stable and cell-associated toxic substance "endotoxin", to
distinguish it from the heat-labile and proteinaceous exotoxins, which were known to be secreted by replicating
bacteria [48-51]. Initial analyses of endotoxin revealed
that it contained polysaccharide and lipid, and was thus
named lipopolysaccharide. The terms "endotoxin" and
"lipopolysaccharide" are widely used by workers in a variety of biomedical fields as synonyms to describe the same
molecule (many references, e.g. [48,51-57] including the
field of cyanobacteria research: "lipopolysaccharide endotoxins" [20,58-60]. However, some authors have suggested that LPS should refer to the purified molecule,
whereas endotoxin more appropriately describes macromolecular complexes of LPS, protein, phospholipid and
nucleic acids [49,50,61].
The study of LPS, which was largely concerned with investigating fever, progressed in the late 1940s with the discovery of endogenous pyrogens [49]. Since then, the field of
cytokine biology has made enormous strides. It is now
understood that the pathological effects of LPS are indirect, i.e. LPS acts by initiating a cascade of host-mediated
responses: initially monocytes and macrophages are stimulated, and then neutrophils and platelets congregate in
microcapillaries, causing vascular injury. Inflammatory
cells release a range of endogenous mediators, including
arachidonic acid metabolites, platelet-activating factor,
cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and tumour
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), nitric oxide, toxic O2
metabolites, vasoactive amines, proteases and products of
the complement and coagulation cascades. There are
many reviews in the literature on cytokines and LPS –
some recent examples are: [47-49,51,55,56,62-64].
Cytokine-mediated responses are extremely complex:
cytokines are pleiotropic, i.e. a single type of cytokine
affects several different types of cell. Cytokines have autocrine effects, i.e. they can stimulate the cells that secrete
them to produce more cytokines, and paracrine effects –
stimulating other cells to produce different cytokines [65].
Signs and symptoms in human volunteers after administration of endotoxin are: fever, rigors, and influenza-like
symptoms of fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, drowsiness, mild amnesia and diarrhoea
[47,61,66,67].
From the discovery that LPS-associated pathology results
from the stimulation of host cell responses came the realisation that LPS binds to specific receptors in order to
elicit the release of cytokines and other inflammatory
mediators [64]. Several membrane-bound and soluble
proteins have been shown to bind LPS; the most important appear to be CD14 and LPS-binding protein (LBP)
[48,51,52,55,63,64,68]. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family are a recently discovered group of transmembrane
receptors that are fundamental in signalling innate

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

immune responses to conserved microbial structures, and
they are also involved in the recognition of some endogenous ligands. TLR4 is instrumental in signalling LPS
from many Gram-negative bacteria, and TLR2 is involved
in the recognition of some unusual LPS. There is a considerable and rapidly expanding body of literature on the
TLR family; one of the most comprehensive reviews is by
Takeda et al [69]. A review by Janeway and Medzhitov
[70] is an excellent introduction to TLRs, and places the
activity of these receptors in the broader context of innate
immunity.
Knowledge of the role of specific receptors in mammalian
hosts has led to the demonstration that LPS itself is nontoxic. Schnaitman notes that "LPS itself is not toxic" [71]
and Henderson et al describe LPS as "relatively inactive"
and observe that several host proteins are necessary for
LPS to display full agonist potency [49]. CD14-deficient
cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary are unresponsive
to LPS at high doses, and cell lines that show poor LPS
activation can be converted to show high activation when
transfected with the CD14 gene [71]. LPS-unresponsive
mouse strains and cytokine knockout strains also serve to
reinforce the concept that LPS is not directly toxic, and the
pathophysiology associated with Gram-negative LPS
results from host-mediated factors [68,72-77].
LPS structure – similarities and differences across Gramnegative bacteria
LPS from different Gram-negative species apparently
share common features in their basic architecture. A structure consisting of four covalently linked segments – a surface carbohydrate polymer (O-specific chain), a core
oligosaccharide featuring an outer and inner region, and
an acylated glycolipid (termed lipid A) – is seen in such
ecologically diverse bacteria as Salmonella, Pseudomonas,
Vibrio and Rhizobium [78]. The O-specific chain shows the
most diversity, and is the basis for serological specificity
[48], while lipid A, which anchors the LPS molecule in the
Gram-negative outer membrane, is the most conserved
biochemical structure across different bacterial species
[72] (See Figure 1). There is unequivocal acceptance that
the lipid A moiety is the innate immune stimulating or
"endotoxic" component of LPS [63,79]. This was confirmed by the observations that LPS from polysaccharidedeficient mutant strains were equally as bioactive as parent LPS [63,72,80], and chemically synthesised Escherichia
coli lipid A exhibits identical activity to natural E. coli lipid
A [63,81].
Are all LPS equal in terms of their host-mediated
responses?
Although the basic structure of lipid A is seen in phylogenetically diverse Gram-negative bacteria, variations in the
nature and location of acyl groups or alterations in the

high endotoxicity of R. gelatinosus is apparently due to the
presence of six fatty acid groups in the lipid A structure
[84,86]. Lipid A complexes from the pathogenic bacteria
Chlamydia trachomatis and Legionella pneumophila and the
non-pathogenic hyperthermophile Aquifex pyrophilus
reportedly possess little or no LPS agonist or antagonist
properties [63].

diversity; lipid A is the most conserved structure.

hydrophilic backbone can result in partial or total loss of
biological activity [48,51,63,82,83]. An example is seen in
the case of some purple non-sulfur bacteria, which could
be considered to be somewhat more representative of
cyanobacteria when it comes to drawing comparisons on
the biological activity of LPS. Purple non-sulfur bacteria,
being photosynthetic, are Gram-negative bacteria that
occupy a similar ecological niche to that of cyanobacteria,
and therefore have growth and reproductive strategies that
much more closely resemble cyanobacteria than the heterotrophic, gut-dwelling E. coli and Salmonella. Lipid A
complexes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodobacter
capsulatus are not only inactive, but are antagonists of
Enterobacteriaceae

activation
[48,49,52,63,84]. R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus lipid A
differs from that of Escherichia coli in several respects, all
relating to the acylation pattern; the lack of endotoxic
activity in R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus appears to be
attributable to the presence of five rather than six fatty
acid groups, and the shorter chain lengths (C10 in R.
sphaeroides and R. capsulatus compared with C14 in E. coli)
in two ester-linked fatty acids [84]. Lipid A from R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus is of pharmacological interest
because of their LPS-antagonist properties; these lipid A
structures and some synthetic derivatives have been
shown to be potent LPS antagonists in vitro and to protect
against LPS-induced morbidity and mortality in animal
models [49,63,78,85]. Competitive inhibition of biologically active LPS by LPS antagonists further illuminates the
requirement for host cell receptor sites in mediating the
responses to LPS [52]. Other purple non-sulfur bacteria,
e.g. Rhodopseudomonas viridis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris are also reported to lack endotoxic activity [27,84], but
the lipid A from another purple non-sulfur bacterium,
Rubrivivax gelatinosus, is reportedly associated with high
lethality in mice – at similar doses that cause lethality in
Salmonella – and high pyrogenicity in rabbits [27,84]. The

Bacteroides spp., which are common gut and periodontal
commensals, have low endotoxic activity compared to
that of Salmonella, with a greater than 500-fold higher
mouse LD50 and 100 to 1,000-fold reduced ability to stimulate production of IL-1 in monocyte cultures [87,88].
Bacteroides fragilis LPS inhibits E. coli LPS-induced
endothelial adhesiveness for polymorphonuclear leucocytes, although B. fragilis LPS is reported to be directly
toxic to endothelial cell cultures at high concentrations
[52]. In a study of cytokine induction in whole blood, Frieling et al [89] showed that B. fragilis stimulated IL-1β, IL6 and IL-1ra at levels comparable to Gram-positive bacteria, where 100 to 1,000-fold more organisms are required
to produce similar concentrations of cytokines than with
common pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Wilson et al
[90] suggest that B. fragilis may be such a weak cytokine
inducer because, being a dominant organism in normal
gut flora, it has evolved mechanisms to downregulate the
synthesis of inflammatory cytokines in order to optimise
their niche in the host gut. B. fragilis has five fatty acyl
groups in the lipid A moiety, and other structural differences to Salmonella and E. coli LPS, such as a monophosphorylated disaccharide backbone and longer fatty acyl
chains [91].
Some pathogenic bacteria have LPS which reflects the
highly specific niches they inhabit: enteric Gram-negative
bacteria have long, hydrophilic and neutral O-specific
polysaccharide chains which protects the organism from
solubilisation by bile acids and intestinal enzymes,
whereas organisms that colonise the mucous membranes
of the respiratory and genital tracts have outer membrane
surfaces that are hydrophobic and can be solubilised by
bile [92,93]. Gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria,
Haemophilus and Bordetella have developed unique surface
glycolipids lacking O-antigens, which some workers call
lipooligosaccharides [63,92,93].
The presence of one or more secondary acyl chains
appears to be essential for lipid A to stimulate some endotoxic reactions [82,88]. One of the final stages of Enterobacteriaceae lipid A biosynthesis is the formation of
acyloxyacyl groups, so-called secondary fatty acids [94]. A
leucocyte enzyme, acyloxyacyl hydrolase, selectively
removes these secondary fatty acyl groups, without releasing the 3-hydroxy acyl chains that substitute the lipid A
disaccharide backbone [82,95]. Deacylated LPS from E.

coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Haemophilus influenzae and
Neisseria meningitidis were shown to have reduced activities in a series of tests relating to endotoxic potential, in
some cases by greater than two orders of magnitude, and
deacylated Neisseria LPS demonstrated some antagonistic
activity towards Neisseria and Salmonella LPS [82,95,96].
The lipid A analog, compound 406, which lacks the two
secondary fatty acids of E. coli lipid A, is unable to induce
cytokines in human cells [48,51,75]. Rietschel et al [51]
propose that endotoxic capacity resides in the spatial conformation of lipid A, in that biologically inactive lipid A
(e.g. R. capsulatus) conforms to lamellar structures,
whereas endotoxic lipid A adopts exclusively cubic or hexagonal structures.
Netea et al [97] suggest that the historical assumption that
LPS from different Gram-negative bacteria possess similar
biological effects is incorrect, and that differences between
LPS across species are the rule rather than the exception.
The authors discuss structure-function relationships
between LPS and the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are
integral in LPS-mediated signalling, suggesting that differences in the three-dimensional conformation of LPS molecules translate into differences in TLR signalling of
proinflammatory cytokines. In their reviews of the
supramolecular structure and phase transition states of
LPS and lipid A, Seydel and Brandenburg [98] and Seydel
et al [54] suggest that endotoxic activity is related to the
three-dimensional conformation of LPS and the multimeric aggregates they form. The conformation of LPS or
lipid A within such aggregates is not constant, but a reversible phase transition occurs, which is temperaturedependent and related to the length and degree of saturation of the acyl chains and other physiological conditions.
More recent work by Seydel and collaborators has led to
the realisation that the biological activity of specific lipid
A structures can be determined by an understanding of
their supramolecular structure, which is a function of the
monomeric conformation, which in turn is largely determined by the primary molecular structure [83,99,100].
The presence of sufficient negative charges on the disaccharide backbone – mainly, but not necessarily, two phosphate groups – has an important influence on lipid A
molecular conformation and the binding capacity to
serum proteins such as LBP [83,101]. A high negative
charge density is reported to be an essential requirement
for agonistic and antagonistic properties; complete or partial substitution of negative charges can result in the loss
of all biological activity [83,102]. Seydel's team now suggest that a general principle can be applied regarding the
molecular conformation of lipid A structures and their
biological activity: lipid A structures that adopt conical/
concave shapes have hexagonal or cubic supramolecular

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

aggregate structures and express high endotoxic potential,
whereas lipid A structures that adopt cylindrical conformations have lamellar aggregates and are either inactive
or LPS antagonists [99]. Thus lipid A of the photosynthetic bacterium R. gelatinosus, which has high endotoxic
activity [27,84], was seen to adopt hexagonal aggregate
structures, whereas the lipid A formations of other nonendotoxic photosynthetic bacteria adopt cylindrical
shapes and lamellar aggregate structures [99,100,103].
Lipid A from Chromobacterium violaceum forms a cylindrical geometry and is reportedly three orders of magnitude
less active than E. coli lipid A [104]. Ulmer et al [105] also
found that a synthetic lipid A structure based on C. violaceum lipid A had markedly lower cytokine-inducing
capacity than an E. coli-based synthetic lipid A. These findings are in contrast to some other reports, which describe
C. violaceum lipid A as having a high agonist activity
[51,75]. Of interest is the observation that the primary
lipid A structures of C. violaceum and R. gelatinosus are very
similar (bisphosphorylated diglucosamine backbone, six
symmetrically distributed acyl chains differing only in the
length of the two acyloxyacyl groups: C = 12 in C. violaceum and C = 10 for R. gelatinosus) [84]. Yet C. violaceum
lipid A is an LPS antagonist, whereas R. gelatinosus lipid A
expresses high agonist activity. Seydel et al[104] suggest
that the chemical structures of these two lipid A complexes may need to be re-examined. Lipid A of Campylobacter jejuni, which has low endotoxic potential, shows a
very slight tendency to adopt a conical/concave shape,
whereas the lipid A of E. coli clearly adopts a conical/concave form [99,106].
As a result of these studies, the ability of a lipid A monomer to adopt a conical shape (the so-called endotoxic conformation) has been described as a prerequisite for
endotoxicity [100]. Seydel et al [104] suggest that when
lipid A molecules are intercalated into target cell membranes, only lipid A which forms a conical shape – where
the cross-sectional area of the hydrophilic backbone is
smaller than the cross section of the hydrophobic acyl
groups – can exert a mechanical stress on signalling proteins. LPS with a lipid A moiety which assumes a cylindrical shape – cross-sectional areas of the hydrophobic and
hydrophilic components being roughly equal – will
occupy the binding site but be unable to activate signalling proteins, thus acting as an LPS antagonist [102,104].
The number and distribution of acyl chains has been
shown to affect the tilt angle of the disaccharide backbone
with respect to the target cell membrane; the orientation
of the backbone sugars appears to correlate with the endotoxic potential of the LPS. The lipid A molecular shape
and the tilt angle of the backbone sugars are reported to
be the complete determinants of endotoxic activity
[102,104].

The discussion above has contrasted the endotoxic potential of lipid A structures from the most widely studied
forms, those of the Enterobacteriaceae, with some unusual lipid A complexes from photosynthetic bacteria and
synthetic lipid A analogs. The reason that cyanobacterial
LPS has not been discussed here is simply that the
required research has not been done as yet. No cyanobacterial lipid A structures have been published, therefore no
inferences can be deduced as to their likely endotoxic
potential, or lack of it. But with the knowledge that endotoxic potential can vary in the most fundamental way
across Gram-negative bacteria, from agonistic to weakly
active to inactive to antagonistic, it should be incumbent
on the cyanobacteria research community to cease attributing biological activity and clinical symptoms to cyanobacterial LPS without specific research evidence.
Cyanobacteria may not be typical Gram-negative organisms because of their unusual cell wall architecture, and
cyanobacteria will have experienced very different selection pressures to gut-dwelling Gram-negative bacteria,
which may be reflected in different lipid A structures.
LPS and infection
Much research into LPS and lipid A has understandably
concentrated on the severe, life-threatening host
responses to circulating LPS that constitute Gram-negative
septicaemia and septic shock. Many experimental models
have utilised either in vitro studies of isolated cell lines or
animal and human studies where LPS is exposed to the
circulation by parenteral injection.

The matter of the degree to which cyanobacterial LPS/
lipid A can stimulate mammalian cytokine networks
under experimental conditions, which remains largely
unanswered, is only one aspect in the understanding of
cyanobacterial LPS and the gastro-intestinal, respiratory
and cutaneous illnesses which have been attributed to
contact with it. The other side of the story that needs to be
considered is the mechanism by which cyanobacterial LPS
might (and might not) stimulate endotoxic responses by
the various natural exposure routes: ingestion, inhalation
and contact. The following discussion will briefly review
the association between acute gastrointestinal illness and
Gram-negative bacterial LPS. Cutaneous responses to LPS
will be briefly discussed.
Terminology: infection, pathogen
Infectious diseases caused by bacteria are characterised by
several discrete steps: bacterial adhesion to the host, colonisation within or on the host, and evasion of host
defences [31,49]. The only references in the literature that
describe cyanobacteria as invasive, infectious organisms
were from two authors:

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

• Rank [107-109] put forward the hypothesis that a
chronic, low-virulence infestation by cyanobacteria growing heterotrophically may explain the aetiology of arteriosclerosis in humans and homeothermic animals. The
author bases his theory on ecological data, examining the
geographical, demographic and historical distribution of
the disease. Routes of infection are posited to be ingestion
of unfermented milk, public water supplies drawn from
surface waters as distinct from groundwater [108,109],
and earth-contaminated food and other objects [107].
The author also critiques the three theories of the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis that were current at the time
(response-to-injury, lipid hypothesis, and monoclonal
hypothesis) and suggests laboratory studies to replicate
and study the disease. Such studies do not subsequently
appear in the literature, and no further reference to the
cyanobacterial infection hypothesis can be found.
• Ahluwalia et al [110] and Ahluwalia [111,112] posited
the theory that Microcystis aeruginosa is the causative
organism of the mostly tropical, water-exposure-related
invasive disease rhinosporidiosis. However, this theory
has been disputed; convincing and probably conclusive
evidence appears to place the eukaryotic protist Rhinospiridium seeberi as the causative organism (see Author's
reply to Ahluwalia [112]).
Most public health workers would presumably place
cyanobacteria-related illnesses in the context of environmental exposures, as distinct from familiar diseases due to
communicable infectious bacteria, which in many cases
feature transmissible illnesses, secondary to the original
reservoir of infection. Cyanobacteria-related illness is
viewed as intoxication, rather than infection, usually on
the basis of a sudden onset of symptoms occurring soon
after exposure (i.e. without an incubation period), and
lack of secondary cases [113]. Giesecke [114] defines
infectious disease as "all diseases caused by micro-organisms", with sub-definitions of communicable and transmissible disease (communicable disease: capable of being
transmitted from an infected individual to another person, directly or indirectly; transmissible disease: able to be
transmitted from one individual to another by 'unnatural'
routes). Whether cyanobacteriologists would embrace
that definition of infectious disease is debatable, but most
would agree that cyanobacteria-related diseases are neither communicable nor transmissible. Exotoxin-producing cyanobacteria certainly fit the dictionary definition of
pathogenic (i.e. disease-causing) organisms; the reader's
attention is drawn to the distinction between infectious
(implying colonisation and evasion of host defences)
Gram-negative bacteria and non-infectious cyanobacteria

illnesses.

Mechanisms of vomiting and its relationship to LPS activity
Nausea and vomiting are normal physiological responses
to the ingestion of toxic substances; they are essential
defences because they are the end result of the actions of
sensorimotor systems that operate to identify and rapidly
expel hazardous substances from the upper G-I tract [115117]. The two main sensory systems that direct the emetic
response are local, associated with the gut mucosa (preabsorptive response), and central, specifically the chemoreceptive trigger zone of the area postrema, located in the
dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata (post-absorptive
response) [118-120]. Stimulation of chemoreceptors in
the stomach, jejunum and ileum by irritant chemicals
such as hypertonic saline, copper sulfate or mustard, or by
bacterial enterotoxins, leads to the activation of vagal sensory afferent nerves to the brain. Vagal efferent processing
through the enteric nervous system stimulates enteric
motor neurons to effect emesis [115,117,119,120].
Emetic chemoreceptors are also found in the vascular system; activation of these chemoreceptors will also initiate
nausea and vomiting [115]. Endogenous mediators of
emesis such as dopamine, acetylcholine and enkephalin
are reported [115]. Prostaglandins have well-known
emetic actions [121].

Circulating E. coli LPS is a potent emetic stimulant. In a
series of experiments using piglets, Girod et al [122]
showed that parenteral administration of LPS provoked
vomiting (as well as fever, rigors, purpura, diarrhoea and
drowsiness). The authors suggested that LPS stimulates
vomiting by means of cytokine-induced prostaglandins
and other endogenous mediators acting both centrally
and on vagal afferents. Other animal studies have demonstrated the emetic action of LPS [123].
The area postrema is reported to be the primary sensory
area involved in nausea as well as vomiting, although nausea is accompanied by autonomic excitation, whereas
vomiting is a somatic process independent of the autonomic nervous system [118,121]. Presumably LPS-stimulated endogenous mediators are associated with
symptoms of nausea, which is reported in several studies
and reviews of intravenous exposure to LPS in human volunteers [47,61,66,67].
To investigate vomiting associated with exposure to
cyanobacteria, the appropriate research efforts should
determine whether cyanobacterial LPS is capable of stimulating gut chemoreceptors, or if cyanobacterial LPS can
gain access to the circulation and stimulate nausea and
vomiting centrally. Another point of interest should be
directed towards the cyanobacterial exotoxins, as to their
capacity to stimulate either gut mucosal chemoreceptors,
vascular emetic chemoreceptors, or whether they induce
vomiting through the activity of endogenous mediators.

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

Bacterial exotoxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxins
(SEs) are known to stimulate emesis via gut chemoreceptors [116,117,124]. Worthy of note is that experimental
induction of LPS-related emesis is achieved by intravenous or intraperitoneal routes [122-127], whereas SEs
readily elicit vomiting when administered intragastrically
[124,128]. Also of interest with respect to cyanobacteriarelated G-I illness are some similarities of clinical symptoms in the case of staphylococcal food poisoning: enteritis due to ingestion of SEs is characterised by rapid onset
(1–4 hours) of vomiting ± nausea and diarrhoea, abdominal cramping and dizziness [124,129]. Staphylococcal
food poisoning is an intoxication, not an infectious process [129].
Diarrhoea and LPS
One inference that can be drawn from the references that
posit cyanobacterial LPS as the cause of G-I illnesses (see
Table 1) is that these symptoms are not necessarily related
to exposure to any of the known cyanobacterial exotoxins,
the assumption being that exposure to – and presumably
illness caused by – cyanobacterial LPS can occur with or
without concurrent exposure to exotoxins (i.e. from nontoxic strains or species, or non-production of exotoxins at
the time of exposure). However, several questions need to
be answered if LPS is the sole presumptive "G-I-toxin". A
hypothesis is needed for the mechanism of cyanobacterial
LPS, in the absence of other virulence factors, to initiate
diarrhoea by the oral exposure route. Another explanation
for cyanobacterial LPS-related diarrhoea is that the alteration in gut membrane permeability may be related to a
cytokine cascade generated by circulating cyanobacterial
LPS, but again, a hypothesis is needed to explain the exposure route for the LPS to overcome innate immune intestinal defences in order to gain access to the circulation.

Some observations on the behaviour of Gram-negative
bacterial LPS in the gut serve to cast doubt on the suspicions that cyanobacterial LPS alone is responsible for initiating acute gastro-intestinal illness in humans by the
oral route:
• Commensal gut flora: The human intestinal tract
houses an enormous population of bacteria, many of
which are Gram-negative. The Enterobacteriaceae are
found in normal faecal flora at some 108–109 per gram
[130]. The number of microbes in the gut lumen exceeds
the number of eukaryotic cells in the human body by an
order of magnitude [49,131], an observation that may
lead some to unkindly suggest that the principal reason
for human existence is to serve as bags for the housing and
transport of bacteria. Nanthakumar et al [132] note that
mature enterocytes are 100 to 1,000 times less sensitive to
LPS than neutrophils and hepatocytes, which is not surprising since they are exposed to Gram-negative bacteria

and their endotoxins since birth when the gut is colonised.
• Non-virulent strains: Most Gram-negative organisms
are non-pathogenic. Pathogenicity involves a complex
interaction between host-related and specific microbial
virulence factors – the latter including pili, fimbriae and
heat shock proteins [133,134]. Infectious, i.e. colonising,
microbes are the most common cause of diarrhoea worldwide; pathogenic strains commonly cause disease by the
action of enterotoxins [135]. That virulence factors other
than lipid A structures of LPS are responsible for gastrointestinal disease is seen in the protective effects of attenuated or mutant Gram-negative bacteria when used as live
oral vaccines against pathogenic strains [133,136-138].
Some E. coli strains are used as probiotics for the treatment
of gastrointestinal disease and infection prophylaxis in
neonates [139].
• Anecdotal reports of consumption of non-hazardous
cyanobacteria: Heaney [39] reports observations of cattle
seen drinking from two Irish lakes affected by thick scums
of Anabaena flos-aquae and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae without ill effect. Author IS can add a similar observation: during recruitment for an epidemiology study [140] at Lake
Coolmunda in southern Queensland, a frank Microcystis
aeruginosa bloom was in attendance. A group of six or
seven dogs were seen playing vigorously in the water, and
three dogs were observed drinking from it. The owners of
the animals were questioned the following day; all denied
observing any adverse effects. The consumption of Spirulina and other cyanobacteria provides further evidence
that cyanobacterial LPS cannot all be harmful. Cyanobacteria as food, medicine and livestock feed will be discussed later in this review.
Oketani et al [141] state that orally administered LPS is
not harmful to animals, which is in stark contrast to LPS
administered parenterally. Evidence for harmful effects of
orally administered LPS is difficult to gather from the literature because of the overwhelming number of publications describing experimental use of LPS as an in vitro and
in vivo immune stimulant. We found two reports of in vivo
LPS activity by the oral route: Yang et al [142] showed that
oral administration of E. coli LPS enhanced the progression of hepatoma in rats treated with thioacetamide.
Yoshino et al [143], using a mouse model of autoimmune
disease, demonstrated that orally-dosed LPS exacerbated
collagen-induced arthritis. These models of liver disease
and autoimmunity are not applicable to the concept of
acute G-I symptoms caused by cyanobacterial LPS in presumably healthy people in recreational settings and
through cyanobacterial contamination of drinking water
supplies. However, they highlight the importance of gut
mucosal immunity. LPS and other microbial products are

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

constantly sampled by gut-associated lymphoid tissues,
which contain the largest assemblage of immunocompetent cells in the body [131]. Translocation of small
amounts of LPS from the gut lumen across the epithelium
and into the portal circulation is an important immunestimulating process, with Kupffer cells in the liver playing
an important role in clearance of LPS from the circulation
[131]. LPS and other bacterial products from the normal
gut flora can be a source of infection and sepsis when the
integrity of the gut mucosa is disrupted. This occurs in a
variety of disease states, including hypovolaemic shock,
burn injury, trauma, acute liver failure, pancreatitis, cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease [131].
Roth et al [144] suggest that endogenous (i.e. gut-derived)
LPS is a potent synergist of the toxicity of a range of structurally and functionally unrelated hepatotoxic xenobiotic
agents. The authors put the proposition that hepatotoxicity associated with some chemicals is indirectly caused by
primary damage to the intestinal tract, which allows
increased translocation of bacterial LPS into the portal circulation. The liver is then exposed to harmful levels of
LPS, and the ensuing liver injury resembles that caused by
large doses of LPS: changes in sinusoidal and parenchymal cells, neutrophil and platelet accumulation in sinusoids, then multifocal hepatocellular degeneration and
necrosis. Yee et al[145] showed that co-administration of
individually non-toxic doses of LPS and the alkaloid phytotoxin monocrotaline produced significant liver injury,
characterised by midzonal and centrilobular apoptotic
and necrotic changes, coagulation and congestion, and
loss of sinusoidal architecture. Ganey & Roth [146] propose that the activation and increased expression of various soluble mediators, signalling molecules and cellular
processes are crucial events in the augmentation of xenobiotic toxicity by bacterial LPS, and that the mechanisms
of toxicity are complex and variable.
Purified microcystins as well as microcystin-producing
and cylindrospermopsin-producing cyanobacteria have
been shown in accidental poisonings and through in vivo
and in vitro experimental work to damage the gastrointestinal tract [37,147-153]. The possibility should be considered that cyanotoxins and LPS (from cyanobacteria and/
or from gut-dwelling heterotrophic bacteria) may cross a
disrupted gut mucosal barrier and enhance the pathological effects of cyanobacterial exotoxins.
LPS and cutaneous reactions
As with LPS and oral exposure, searching bibliographic
databases for evidence of LPS/endotoxin as the primary
cause of acute clinical dermatoses is a difficult task, again
because of the many citations of in vitro immunology
work using LPS to investigate various dermal cell processes. As a starting point, dermatology textbooks were

Page 10 of 23
(page number not for citation purposes)

Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source 2006, 5:7

perused, yet only one of a dozen or so standard texts made
any reference to either LPS or endotoxin: Rietschel &
Fowler [154] describe a single case report of a hospital
worker who suffered dyshidrosis (a vesicular or vesicopustular eruption on the palms of the hands), which was
linked to endotoxin in latex gloves. Various dermatoses
are clearly associated with either superficial or systemic
infection by many Gram-negative organisms, most notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa [155]. However, it is unreasonable to compare mechanisms of cutaneous disease from
colonising Gram-negative bacteria to those due to cyanobacteria solely on the basis that both organisms contain
LPS.
Cyanobacterial LPS
Literature searches using PubMed and Web of Science
with the search terms (cyanobacteria* OR blue green
alga*) AND (LPS OR endotoxin) revealed 17 publications
that describe the extraction ± purification of cyanobacterial LPS. The Westphal hot phenol/water method was
used in 15 of these studies (described in [156]). Jürgens et
al [157] used a sucrose density centrifugation and Triton
X-100 extraction, and Papageorgiou et al [158] compared
the phenol/water method with novel extraction methods.
Raziuddin et al [159] used chloroform and acetic acid
extraction to isolate lipid A from their LPS extract. Table 2
lists the studies in which cyanobacterial LPS were tested
for lethality in mice. All doses were reported in the original papers in terms of dose per mouse; these doses have
been converted to mg/kg body weight for comparison
purposes in Table 2. An assumed weight of 20 g was
applied to mice for the studies in which the authors did
not report the weight of their animals. Note that the study
of Scholtissek et al [160] used galactosamine-sensitised
mice, so their LPS doses are not directly comparable to
those given in the other studies; a similar situation applies
with the study of Katz et al [161], where adrenalectomised
mice were used. Adrenalectomy sensitises mice by three
orders of magnitude to the lethal effects of LPS [162,163].
By way of comparison, some examples of reported lethal
concentrations of Enterobacteriaceae LPS are: 5–20 mg/kg
[164], 6 mg/kg [165] and 24 mg/kg [163] (LD50 concentrations in various strains of LPS-sensitive mice; assumed
weight of mice = 20 g) to LD80 concentrations of 10–23
mg/kg [166].

In addition to lethality, various other toxicity endpoints
were examined in some of the studies listed in Table 2 and
others. Buttke & Ingram [167], Keleti et al [168] and Keleti
& Sykora [169] investigated the local Shwartzman reaction, which is a dermonecrotic lesion elicited in rabbits by
subcutaneous preparative and intravenous provocation
injections. Positive Shwartzman reactions were generated
by Agmenellum quadruplicatum LPS, Schizothrix calcicola
LPS and Anabaena flos-aquae LPS, but not by Oscillatoria

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

tenuis LPS [167-169]. These results should be regarded as
qualitative, as no reports were made of quantitative measurements of lesions, which can be done by various methods [170,171]. However, the local Shwartzman response
to A. quadruplicatum LPS led the study authors to describe
Agmenellum LPS as "a less effective endotoxin than Salmonella LPS" [167]. The Shwartzman reaction to A. flos-aquae
LPS was reportedly "weakly positive" [169]. Keleti &
Sykora [169] also used a rabbit isolated ileal loop assay,
which did not show any positive findings from the three
cyanobacterial LPS isolates injected. Weise et al [172]
tested A. nidulans LPS for pyrogenicity in rabbits, reporting
a tenfold lower response than that seen from E. coli LPS.
Schmidt et al [173] also tested the LPS from two Synechococcus strains for pyrogenicity, with maximum increases in
rabbit body temperature of 1.5°C after injection of up to
1 mg/kg. The authors reportthat these doses are some
three orders of magnitude higher than those required of
Salmonella LPS to achieve the same effect. LPS extracted
and purified by author IS [156] and also by Papageorgiou
et al [158] were investigated for their potential to affect
thermoregulation in a mouse model. LPS from several
cyanobacterial isolates induced sickness behaviour and
transient hypothermia at doses of 70 mg/kg i.p.; similar
responses in positive control animals were seen after i.p.
injection of 4 mg/kg E. coli LPS. Cyanobacterial LPS doses
of 7 mg/kg also initiated transient hypothermia and sickness behaviour, although at markedly lower intensity and
duration than was seen with E. coli LPS at 4 mg/kg [156].
Most workers concluded that the cyanobacterial LPS they
examined were weakly toxic when compared to the activity of positive control heterotrophic bacterial LPS. The
exception was the work of Best et al [174], who investigated the potential of isolated cyanobacterial LPS to
reduce the activity of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in
Zebra fish embryos. They reported that cyanobacterial LPS
reduced microsomal and soluble GSTs in vivo to a greater
extent than LPS from E. coli or Salmonella typhimurium. The
authors suggested that such reduction in GST availability
may deleteriously affect the ability of organisms to
detoxify microcystins, presumably through decreased utilisation of glutathione (GSH) for conjugation reactions.
This would seem to be a reasonable assumption, although
other interpretations of this finding are possible. While
the GSH system is an essential intracellular redox buffer,
preventing oxidative injury, it is also an important participant in many cellular functions, including DNA and protein synthesis, metabolism, cell growth and amino acid
transport [175,176]. Many enzymes are GSH-dependent,
including glutathione transferases [177]. GSH is also an
essential component of some immune functions such as
apoptosis, T-lymphocyte signalling and proliferation, and
activation of the nuclear transcription factor NFκB
[176,178-184]. It is these immunological functions of the

GSH system that present as somewhat paradoxical: glutathione depletion has a protective effect on various models of apoptotic and necrotic liver injury [181,185-187].
Glutathione depletion has also been shown to prevent
LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury by attenuating
neutrophil activation and sequestration [188,189]. Glutathione depletion has been proposed as a novel antiinflammatory pharmacotherapy [186,190]. Dröge et al
wrote in 1994 that:
"It is clear that GSH is one of the limiting factors that
determine the magnitude of immunological functions in
vitro and in vivo...we must be prepared to reevaluate one
of the central dogmas concerning the role of GSH. GSH
was viewed mostly as an important anti-oxidant that protects cells against oxidative stress" [178].
So the findings of Best et al [174], where cyanobacterial
LPS markedly reduced GSTs in fish embryos after 24 hour
exposures, may indicate an anti-inflammatory response
displaying a different time course to that seen with heterotrophic bacterial LPS, or a consequence of decreased
GSH availability, as intracellular GSH efflux increases
with the onset of apoptosis [179]. GSTs can be inhibited
by GSH conjugates, i.e. their reaction products [191], so
this possibility may also need to be considered. In any
event, and insofar as innate immune responses in fish
embryos can be equated to mammalian cellular activities,
these responses are likely to be very complex, with numerous endogenous mediators, feedback loops and timedependent variation. As an example, the chemoprotecant
oltipraz, which is thought to exert anticarcinogenic effects
through induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, is
now known to transiently (within 24 hours) inhibit some

important CYPs and GSTs in vitro and in vivo. Animals
treated for three days showed two-fold-plus increases in
the same enzymes [192,193]. We would be interested to
see time-course studies that replicate the work of Best et al
[174], perhaps continued over several days.
In addition to the studies cited above, nine reports
describe the isolation and purification of cyanobacterial
LPS for various biomedical, biochemical or structural
studies, but no toxicological endpoints were investigated
[28,157,194-200]. The topic of cyanobacterial LPS was
reviewed by Weckesser et al [27], and Mayer & Weckesser
[201]. These reviews are especially valuable in that they
contrast the work done on other photosynthetic prokaryotes, especially the purple non-sulfur bacteria, some of
which have been shown to have lipid A structures that are
LPS antagonists, as discussed above. No cyanobacterial
lipid A structures have been described to date.
In addition to work done on isolated and purified LPS,
some reports discuss the activity of cyanobacterial LPS by
use of the Limulus amoebocyte (LAL) assay. This is a
highly sensitive test, though there are trade-offs in terms
of specificity, with other bacterial products such as peptidoglycan and glucan capable of registering positive
responses [49,202,203]. The assay may not always be a
reliable predictor of cellular and in vivo responses [204].
Seydel et al [205] suggest that, while the LAL assay is useful for detecting and quantifying LPS in blood products, it
is not a measure of endotoxicity. The study of Rapala et al
[206] had some significant findings pertaining to the
topic of presumed toxicity of cyanobacterial LPS. The
authors used the LAL assay to test 26 axenic strains from
five cyanobacterial genera; all responses were at least five

Page 12 of 23

Environmental Health: A Global Access Science Source 2006, 5:7

orders of magnitude lower than reactions to E. coli LPS,
and several were below the assay's detection limits. This
suggests that the lipid A structures of these LPS have some
significant and fundamental structural differences to
endotoxic lipid A, as the LAL assay does not react to some
unusual or modified lipid A structures [88].
Spirulina platensis: the importance of exposure route
S. platensis has a long history of use as a foodstuff, dietary
supplement and livestock feed additive, with its probable
use dating back to the ninth century in Africa, and the 14th
century in Mexico [207]. Spirulina is classified taxonomically under the genus Arthrospira, order Oscillatoriales; A.
maxima and A. fusiformis are grown commercially in mass
culture, but usually designated as "S. platensis" [208]. The
use of this cyanobacterium was comprehensively
reviewed by Ciferri [209], who concluded that extensive
nutritional and toxicological testing has shown it to be a
safe and valuable protein source. The use of Spirulina was
briefly reviewed along with that of other edible microalgae by Kay [42], who cited Ciferri [209] in stating that
some "negative effects" of Spirulina feeding were seen in
multigenerational studies and mutagenicity tests. However, this appears to be a misinterpretation on the part of
Kay [42], as Ciferri [209] described "negative results" from
these studies. The original publications cited by Ciferri
[209] were unobtainable. More recent studies seem to
support the suggestion that consumption of Spirulina is
not harmful, and enhances various immune functions
[210-214].

A single case report is the exception to the rest of the literature. Iwasa et al [215] describe a 52-year-old male taking
antihypertensive, hypolipidaemic and hypoglycaemic
pharmacotherapy, who developed abnormal hepatic
enzyme levels two weeks after taking Spirulina, presumably on a regular basis. Liver function tests showed a significant deterioration over the following three weeks, after
which he was hospitalised. Although a physical examination was unremarkable, a liver biopsy revealed some
degenerative changes. Serological studies for a range of
viruses were negative. His medications and Spirulina were
withdrawn, after which his hepatic function rapidly
returned to normal. Hepatotoxicity in this case was attributed to consumption of Spirulina, on the basis of temporal
relationships between liver function abnormality and
recovery with consumption and withdrawal of Spirulina,
although possible interaction effects with the medications
would have been worth considering. This may have been
the case with simvastatin, the cholesterol-lowering agent
this individual was taking. Simvastatin causes increased
proinflammatory cytokine production, and it can potentiate inflammatory responses induced by bacterial products
[216]. A brief anecdotal report described two separate
occurrences of gastro-intestinal illness in adults following

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

consumption of Spirulina pills in Canada in the early
1980s, though there was an indication that one individual's tablets had some bacterial contamination [217].
Recent work has demonstrated that A. fusiformis in Kenyan
soda lakes is capable of producing the cyanobacterial exotoxins microcystin-YR and anatoxin-a [218,219]. The
implications of this finding are important because cyanobacterial poisoning is implicated in mass mortalities of
Lesser Flamingos in the Rift Valley, and A. fusiformis is the
principal food source for these animals [220,221]. Common toxigenic cyanobacteria such as Anabaena and Microcystis are also found in these lakes, and periodically
dominate the phytoplankton profile [222], so presumably
toxin-producing genes are being transferred between these
genera in the field.
The long-standing and widespread consumption of
Arthrospira spp. illuminates the importance of considering
the route of exposure in toxicology studies, and the dangers in this case of presumptive inference of disease from
the findings of parenterally administered LPS. Tornabene
et al [223] reported a lethal dose of Spirulina platensis LPS
in the range of 400 mg/kg (i.p. mouse), although those
findings are not supported by the work of Stewart, where
Spirulina LPS i.p. injections of 350 mg/kg failed to induce
either thermoregulatory change or sickness behaviour
signs [156]. However, Falconer [224] reported that cell
lysates of Spirulina were highly toxic to mice when administered by intraperitoneal injection.
Other cyanobacteria are consumed as foods, medicines
and dietary supplements. Wild-harvested Aphanizomenon
flos-aquae was over a decade ago reportedly "consumed by
thousands of people without incident" [42], although the
lake that produces the commercially available product
(Lake Klamath, Oregon) is sometimes subject to contaminating growth of Microcystis spp., and some A. flos-aquae
end-product batches contaminated with microcystins
have since been found [225-227]. A Canadian survey analysed for microcystins in cyanobacterial products (Aphanizomenon, Spirulina and unidentified cyanobacteria) but
did not present the results according to the component
genera, so it is not clear whether Spirulina products (presumably originating from commercial mass cultures) contained microcystins [228]. Nostoc commune, a terrestrial
cyanobacterium, has a long history of use in China and
Scandinavia as food and medicine [229]. The widespread
use of these products serves as a reminder that some
cyanobacteria, and therefore their LPS, are not harmful by
the oral route.
LPS by inhalation
In our opinion, the sole natural exposure route that might
explain aquatic cyanobacterial LPS-related illness is via

inhalation of aerosolised cells or fragments. Extrapolating
from the understanding of Gram-negative bacterial LPS
on the respiratory system (as have most if not all of the
authors cited in Table 1 for the presumed involvement of
cyanobacterial LPS on various disease states), there is a
significant and increasing body of literature on the association between endotoxin and pulmonary disease, including asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease and
emphysema. Intact bacteria and cell wall fragments are
readily aerosolised; bioaerosols of Gram-negative bacteria
are widespread contaminants of soils, water and living
organisms [230,231]. Exposure to airborne endotoxin has
been associated with a range of occupational respiratory
diseases, in industries where high concentrations of
organic dusts are liberated, e.g. various agricultural settings, cotton milling, brewing, waste processing
[230,232]. Endotoxin is also found in high concentrations in air pollution and household dust [233]. Endotoxin in some aquatic environments can be aerosolised to
disease-related concentrations: Rose et al [234] investigated outbreaks of granulomatous pneumonitis affecting
lifeguards at an indoor swimming pool, with some
affected chronically. Gram-negative bacteria, principally
Pseudomonas spp., colonised water spray systems in the
facility, and increased endotoxin in bio-aerosols was
linked to the illnesses.
Michel [232] reviewed experimental inhalation studies of
LPS: 4–12 hour periods of dyspnoea, chest tightness,
myalgia, shivering, fatigue and malaise with or without
fever were reported in a minority of normal subjects.
Impaired pulmonary function in the form of bronchoconstriction, changes in non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reduced alveolar-capillary diffusion were
demonstrated. Asthmatic subjects responded with significant bronchoconstriction lasting five or more hours at
doses of 20 µg, whereas normal subjects required doses of
80 µg or more to produce moderate bronchoconstriction
[232]. Of interest is the observation that LPS-induced lung
changes are associated with neutrophil activation,
whereas purified allergen extracts induce bronchial eosinophilia in asthmatic subjects [232,235]. Normal subjects
exhibit a broad range of responses to inhaled LPS: 9% of
subjects developed airway obstruction after low-dose
inhalation, and 15% showed a negligible airway response
to high doses of LPS [233,236]. Polymorphisms in genes
coding for Toll-like receptors, especially Toll-like receptor4, appear to be important determinants of variability in
human responses to inhaled endotoxins. Arbour et al
[237] showed that a TLR4 sequence mutation is associated
with an endotoxin hyporesponsive phenotype in humans.
Schwartz [233] describes asthma as a complex, heterogeneous disease with multiple clinical sub-types, polygenic
inheritance, and influenced by many different environ-

mental exposures. Endotoxin is one such exposure, which
causes a biologically unique form of asthma [233]. However, exposure to endotoxin early in life may confer beneficial effects: growing up on a farm and exposure to
livestock is reportedly associated with a significant reduction in atopy, and there is an inverse correlation between
house-dust endotoxin concentration and allergen sensitisation [238-240]. This so-called "hygiene hypothesis" for
allergic diseases describes the concept that allergy results
from an imbalance in the T-helper cell (Th) subset.
According to this theory, exposure to bacterial and viral
pathogens in the prenatal and early childhood periods
prevents the induction of allergen-associated Th2 cells by
establishing a Th1-biased immunity [238,241]. However,
the hygiene hypothesis is complex and controversial, with
contradictory observations and refinements to the theory
appearing in the literature. Interested readers are directed
to some recent reviews and updates: [241-244]
LPS and allergens initiate inflammatory processes in the
airways through different pathways and cytokine cascades: LPS is recognised by innate immune cells, principally alveolar macrophages, which generate proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α and IL-8; the
latter cytokine recruits and activates neutrophils. LPS also
generates IL-12, which inhibits IgE responses. Allergens
generate IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5, the latter cytokine being an
activator of eosinophils [241].
In the context of environmental exposures, endotoxins
and allergens often occur together; synergistic effects are
important considerations in that airway responses to
combinations of LPS and allergen are reportedly greater
than to either substance alone in atopic asthmatics
[241,245].
The impact of cyanobacteria on respiratory symptoms in
atopic individuals is worthy of investigation, and may
involve protein allergens and cyanobacterial endotoxin
from both toxic and non-toxic blooms. However, the relative burden of cyanobacterial endotoxin to respiratory
morbidity will depend on the capacity of the LPS of any
given cyanobacterial species to act as an LPS agonist, or as
an LPS antagonist, or be biologically inactive; such properties are as yet largely undetermined.
An equally important research effort should be directed
towards the capacity of inhaled cyanobacterial exotoxins
to generate immunologically non-specific responses (i.e.
in unsensitised individuals) in the bronchial tree. Microcystin-LR appears to be able to efficiently gain access to
the circulation by both intranasal and intratracheal routes
[246-248], but Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin delivered by inhalation does not cross into the pulmonary vasculature to enter the circulation, and at least one

endotoxin-stimulated cytokine – TNF-α – is compartmentalised in the airways [241,249,250]. What is open to
question is whether the serious cases of pneumonia
reported after recreational exposure to cyanobacteria (see
Stewart et al [251]) may be explained by the induction of
an inflammatory response by inhaled cyanobacterial exotoxin, which progresses to recruitment and activation of
neutrophils and is confined to the pulmonary alveolar
compartment. The possibility is also open as to whether
less dramatic reports of respiratory illness may also be
explained by a similar, albeit self-limiting process, in
healthy, non-atopic individuals. Of course, this speculation does not exclude the likelihood of different, overlapping mechanisms of disease that may explain these
phenomena – protein allergens in some cyanobacteria
may provoke symptoms in atopic individuals, such symptoms possibly being exacerbated by the presence of cyanobacterial and/or epiphytic bacterial endotoxins.
Cyanobacterial exotoxins may have the capacity to generate respiratory illness in non-atopic individuals, with
endotoxins from cyanobacteria or commensal bacteria
possibly augmenting the symptoms. The potential for
cyanobacterial and/or contaminant endotoxin alone to
produce symptoms by inhalation exposure remains open,
given the observation that LPS can produce measurable
airway function changes in animal models and in some
healthy individuals [236,252-254]. Yet it remains unclear
whether such experimentally-induced changes in the airway function of healthy volunteers correlate with symptoms of respiratory dysfunction.

Conclusion
Lipid A, the endotoxic moiety of LPS, was in previous decades thought to remain constant across different Gramnegative bacteria [100]. This is now understood to be
incorrect; many non-enteric bacteria are seen to vary in
their lipid A structures. Because the biological activity of
lipid A is determined by its structure, the toxic potential of
non-enteric bacteria can vary. Gram-negative organisms
occupying different ecological niches will not have the
same requirements for growth, and their outer membranes can be expected to vary in order to meet different
environmental conditions [31]. Endotoxic potential cannot be assumed to be lacking in the LPS of non-enteric
bacteria, however, as seen in the high LPS agonist activity
of lipid A from the non-pathogenic purple non-sulfur bacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus, as discussed above. A similar
example is given by another group of non-pathogenic bacteria, Rhizobium spp., the LPS from some of which are
comparable to that of enterobacterial LPS in lethal toxicity
and cytokine-inducing activity [255,256]. Determining
the lipid A structures of various nuisance cyanobacteria
would be an interesting exercise in itself, but regardless of
the findings, proponents of the "cyanobacterial LPS is

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/5/1/7

toxic" cause need to define plausible exposure routes to
allow LPS to signal host receptors and initiate a pathogenic cytokine cascade.
From the discussion in this review, we will put the
hypothesis that oral consumption of non-toxic cyanobacteria, i.e. absolutely or essentially free of any of the known
cyanobacterial exotoxins, will not result in either vomiting or diarrhoea. This hypothesis would be falsified by
experiments that show isolated cyanobacterial LPS or
non-toxic crude extracts can cause gastrointestinal signs
and/or pathology in a suitable model. Our impression is
that reports of G-I symptoms in humans exposed to
cyanobacterial products are indications of innate defences
being signalled by exotoxins that have breached the intestinal barrier. Once this occurs, and gut permeability is sufficiently disrupted, LPS may well synergise the pathology
of cyanotoxins, especially the hepatotoxins. From what
little is known to date about the toxic potential of cyanobacterial LPS, i.e. that they are weakly toxic compared to
those of the Enterobacteriaceae, gut-derived LPS would
seem to be the more likely candidate for augmenting the
pathology of cyanotoxins. In vivo studies of oral exposure
to cyanotoxins would be well served by use of a vomitingcapable model, i.e. non-rodent experiments.
There does not appear to be good evidence that cyanobacterial LPS are likely to initiate cutaneous reactions in
healthy people exposed in recreational or occupational
settings. Cutaneous reactions to cyanobacteria are discussed in detail elsewhere [257-259].
Exposure to bio-aerosols containing cyanobacterial endotoxins may be worthy of investigation, but we are not convinced that cyanobacteria-related acute respiratory illness
in non-atopic, non-allergic individuals is not equally or
more likely to be explained by inhalation of cyanobacterial exotoxins. If some of the exotoxins turn out to possess
ligands that stimulate innate immune responses (discussed further in [156]), then the large pool of resident
alveolar macrophages would be prime candidates for
involvement in respiratory defences. The outbreaks of
bath-water fever in Scandinavia and Africa (see accompanying review by Stewart et al [251]) were, in our opinion,
suspicious of involvement by cyanobacterial exotoxin
breakthrough into reticulated supplies. Similar outbreaks
in future should be vigorously investigated for cyanotoxins if there is a suggestion of significant cyanobacterial
contamination of source water.
In conclusion, LPS of the Enterobacteriaceae are potent
immunomodulatory and immunotoxic bacterial products
that stimulate a wide variety of responses in mammals,
not least of these being a desire to wax lyrical on the topic.
Thus:

"Endotoxins possess an intrinsic fascination that is nothing less than fabulous. They seem to have been endowed
by Nature with virtues and vices in the exact and glamorous proportions needed to render them irresistible to any
investigator who comes to know them" [260].

Facetiousness aside, these workers are pointing out that
there is much to learn about the LPS of the most widely
studied Gram-negative bacteria, these being the Enterobacteriaceae. The understanding of cyanobacterial LPS is
utterly miniscule by comparison, and we urge caution
before continuing to attribute such a disparate range of
symptoms in humans to contact with these materials
without the required research evidence. Weckesser, Drews
and Mayer wrote in 1979 that:

Authors' contributions
"...the picture obtained with the Enterobacteriaceae cannot be assigned to other Gram-negative bacteria without
detailed investigations. Considering the broad spectrum
in morphological and physiological diversity of the many
taxonomic groups of both photosynthetic bacteria and
cyanobacteria, there is a wide open field for studies on the
composition of their cell wall." [27].
Ressom et al [261] stated that:
"Given the enormous heterogeneity in LPS from Gramnegative bacteria there is every reason to suspect that the
same will apply to cyanobacterial LPS and, due to their
taxonomic distance apart, cyanobacterial LPS are likely to
be different from those found in Gram-negative bacteria."
We agree with these statements.
