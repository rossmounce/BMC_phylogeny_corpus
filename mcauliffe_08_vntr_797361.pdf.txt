Abstract
Background: Mycoplasma agalactiae is the main cause of contagious agalactia, a serious disease of
sheep and goats, which has major clinical and economic impacts. Previous studies of M. agalactiae
have shown it to be unusually homogeneous and there are currently no available epidemiological
techniques which enable a high degree of strain differentiation.
Results: We have developed variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis using the sequenced
genome of the M. agalactiae type strain PG2. The PG2 genome was found to be replete with tandem
repeat sequences and 4 were chosen for further analysis. VNTR 5 was located within the
hypothetical protein MAG6170 a predicted lipoprotein. VNTR 14 was intergenic between the
hypothetical protein MAG3350 and the hypothetical protein MAG3340. VNTR 17 was intergenic
between the hypothetical protein MAG4060 and the hypothetical protein MAG4070 and VNTR 19
spanned the 5' end of the pseudogene for a lipoprotein MAG4310 and the 3' end of the hypothetical
lipoprotein MAG4320.
We have investigated the genetic diversity of 88 M. agalactiae isolates of wide geographic origin
using VNTR analysis and compared it with pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Simpson's index of diversity was calculated to be
0.324 for PFGE and 0.574 for VNTR analysis. VNTR analysis revealed unexpected diversity within
M. agalactiae with 9 different VNTR types discovered. Some correlation was found between
geographical origin and the VNTR type of the isolates.
Conclusion: VNTR analysis represents a useful, rapid first-line test for use in molecular
epidemiological analysis of M. agalactiae for outbreak tracing and control.

Background
Mycoplasma agalactiae is the main causative agent of contagious agalactia (CA), a syndrome that causes mastitis,
arthritis, conjunctivitis and pneumonia in sheep and
goats. M. agalactiae is prevalent worldwide but causes particular problems around the Mediterranean basin where it
has a major clinical and economic impact on the small
ruminant milk industry [1]. In most cases, infected hosts
spontaneously recover from acute clinical signs within a
few weeks but develop a chronic infection accompanied
by shedding of M. agalactiae in milk and/or other body
secretions for years without presenting any clinical signs
[1]; these (asymptomatic) carriers can transmit the bacteria to other susceptible animals and cause acute disease
[2]. This has seriously hindered the eradication of CA
despite research into vaccines [3,4], identification of effective antibiotics [5,6] and improved diagnostic testing [7].
Strains of M. agalactiae exhibit very little genetic variation
[8,9] while being antigenically diverse [8-11]. One of the
reasons for this antigenic divergence is the presence of
gene families of variable proteins such as Avg and VmpA;
these are similar to the Vsp gene family in Mycoplasma
bovis (M. bovis) [12-14].
As M. agalactiae shows differing prevalence across the
world, and as it is currently absent from some countries,
notably the UK, there is a pressing need for molecular epidemiological techniques which enable a high degree of
strain differentiation allowing the tracing of the source of
disease outbreaks.
Recently the genome of M. agalactiae has been sequenced
making it highly amenable to analysis using newer typing
methods such as variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR) analysis and multi locus sequence typing (MLST).
VNTRs have been described for a variety of organisms
including Staphylococcus aureus [15], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [16], Borrelia spp [17], Leptospira spp [18], Brucella
spp [19], Francisella tularensis [20], Legionella pneumophila
[21] and has recently been successfully applied to M.
mycoides subspecies mycoides SC (Mmm SC) [22].
VNTRs are simple repeated DNA sequences that vary in
copy number and have been shown to give a high level of
discriminatory power providing information regarding
both evolutionary and functional bacterial diversity [23].
With the increasing number of sequenced genomes and
the development of VNTR databases, VNTR is an increasingly amenable technique for bacterial typing.
We describe the identification and characterisation of tandem repeats within the M. agalactiae PG2 genome, the
selection of 4 VNTRs which showed most intraspecific variation, and their use as a molecular epidemiological tool
for the analysis of 88 M. agalactiae strains. VNTR analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/193

was compared with PFGE and RAPD analysis. This study
has analysed the largest numbers of strains of differing
geographical locations of any previous studies and also
used molecular epidemiological methods not previously
used on M. agalactiae to determine the extent of their
genetic diversity.

Methods
Culture of mycoplasmas
M. agalactiae isolates (as listed in additional file 1) were
stored at -80°C and grown in 3 ml aliquots of Eaton's
broth media [24] for 24 hours. A loop full of the culture
was then plated on Eaton's solid media and incubated at
37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 or 72 hours. Single colonies were
selected and transferred to 3 ml Eaton's broths and incubated until signs of growth, aliquots were then frozen in
15% (v/v) glycerol at -80°C until required.
Confirmatory tests
DNA from each strain was extracted from 1.5 ml of culture
using a Genelute gDNA extraction kit (Sigma) following
the manufacturers instruction. To confirm the identity of
the isolates M. agalactiae PCR based on the uvrC gene [25]
and 16S rDNA PCR DGGE [7] were performed.
Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
RAPD was performed essentially as described previously
[26]. Briefly, PCR reaction mixes were made up in 50 μl
volumes containing: 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl,
2 mM MgCl2, 400 μM dNTPs, 0.8 μM of HUM-4 primer
5'-3' ACG GTA CAC T [27], 2.5 U of Taqgold (Applied Biosystems) and 1 μl of the test sample. The following thermocycling conditions used were; 5 minutes initial
denaturing at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds of
denaturing at 95°C, 1 minute of primer annealing at
37°C, and 1:30 minutes of primer extension; cycles were
followed by a final extension time at 72°C for 5 minutes.
Amplicons were separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels against a 50–2000 bp amplisize DNA marker
(Bio-Rad) followed by ethidium bromide staining. Gel
images were analysed using Bionumerics (Applied
Maths).
Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)
Cells were grown in 20 ml Eaton's broth until late log
phase and centrifuged at 4500 × g for 20 minutes at 4°C
and washed three times in 0.1 M PBS + 10% glucose
(PBSG). Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of PBSG and
60 μl of the cell suspension added to an equal volume of
2% agarose and allowed to set in a plug mould. Once set,
the plugs were added to lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1
mM EDTA + 1% N-lauryl sarcosine + 1 mg/ml proteinase
K) and incubated at 45°C for 48 hours. Lysis buffer was
then removed by five washes of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl + 1
mM EDTA) and plugs finally stored in TE at 4°C until

required. A three millimetre slice of each plug was
digested with 20 U of SmaI (Promega) overnight at room
temperature following manufacturers instruction.
Digested slices and a 0.1–200 Kb pulse marker (Sigma)
were loaded on to 1% pulsed field agarose gels and ran in
a BIO-RAD CHEF III system in 0.5 × TBE for 18 hours
using pulse times of 4 to 40 seconds and a constant buffer
temperature 14°C. After electrophoresis, gels were stained
in ethidium bromide for 20 minutes and then destained
for up to 16 hours in distilled water. Gel pictures were
taken using a transilluminator and pictures analysed
using BioNumerics (Applied Maths).
Tandem repeat identification and VNTR analysis
Tandem repeats in the published M. agalactiae genome
were identified using the Tandem repeat finder [28]
hosted at http://cagt.bu.edu/page/TRF_download. Primers were designed for the region flanking each VNTR using
Primer3 http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/ and primers were tested
using BLAST (NCBI) within the M. agalactiae genome to
confirm that they would only bind in the region flanking
the VNTR of interest.

VNTR sequences were amplified using the primer pairs
listed in table 1. For the PCR, 1 μl of DNA was added as a
template to 49 μl of a reaction mixture containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM each deoxynucleoside triphosphate,
and 0.5 U of Taqgold (Applied Biosystems). The cycling
conditions were: denaturation at 94°C for 5 min followed
by 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 56°C for 45 sec and 72°C
for 1 min, a final extension step of 72°C for 10 min and
samples were kept at 4°C until analysis. Aliquots were
checked for correct amplification by electrophoresis on
2.5% agarose gels followed by visualization with ethidium bromide under UV illumination.
VNTR profiles were recorded as character data using allelic
profiles and then dendrograms were constructed with
PHYLIP (the PHYLogeny Inference Package) hosted at
http://pubmlst.org/analysis/ using neighbor-joining. Tree
display and output was performed using Phylodendron.

Calculation of Simpson's index of diversity
Simpson's index of diversity, which is based on the probability that two unrelated strains will be placed into different typing groups, was calculated according to Hunter and
Gaston [29]. Simpson's index of diversity ranges from 0.0
to 1.0, where 0.0 means that all strains in a population are
of an identical type and conversely, 1.0 indicates that all
of the strains in a population are different can be distinguished from one other.

Results
Characterisation and position of tandem repeats within
the M. agalactiae genome
In total 30 tandem repeats were detected within the M.
agalactiae genome using the parameters of a maximum
period size of 1000 bp, a minimum alignment of 20 bp
and a minimum score of 50. However, many of these tandem repeats were present in only two copies and showed
low internal conservation (less than 80%). Initial screens
using 10 strains of wide geographical origin revealed that
7 tandem repeats showed differences between strains. 4
VNTRs were selected for further analysis and were tested
against 88 strains. The properties of the VNTRs selected
are described below and in table 1.

VNTR 14 did not generate size variation between the isolates but was absent in some isolates, giving 2 groups,
those with VNTR 14 (group 1) and those which lacked it
(group 0). Group 1 contained isolates from a wide geographical origin with isolates from Spain, Greece, Macedonia, Sicily, Sardinia and Portugal all in this group.
Group 0 isolates originated in Gran Canaria, Sicily, Sardinia and Greece.
VNTR 17 generated 4 different profiles, group 0 lacked
this VNTR and contained strain L9 from Gran Canaria,
281F03 from Spain and 227F06 from Greece. Group 1
contained 19 strains from a wide geographical origin with
strains from the Spain, Italy, Greece, Sardinia. Group 2
contained 63 isolates from Sicily, Sardinia, mainland
Italy, Macedonia, Portugal, Greece and Spain. Group 3
contained only 3 isolates, all of which were obtained from
Greece. A representative gel image of VNTR 17 profiles is
shown in figure 1.

VNTR 19 spans the 5' end of the pseudogene for a lipoprotein MAG4310 and the 3' end of the hypothetical lipoprotein MAG4320.

VNTR 19 gave two different sized products when the 88
M. agalactiae strains were tested. Group 1 contained 82
strains with wide geographical origin from Macedonia,
Portugal, Spain, Sardinia, Italy and Greece. Group 2 contained 7 isolates; 6 from Italy and a single strain from Sardinia.

VNTR 5 was found to show some size variation between
M. agalactiae isolates with strain L2 (designated group 2)
having a slightly larger PCR product than other isolates
(group 1).

In total there were 9 different profiles obtained using
VNTR analysis and these are summarised in additional file
1. The 9 different profiles could be divided into 8 different
groups as shown in figure 2. There was some correlation

between geographical origin and the 10 groups. Group 1
contained mainland Italian, Sicilian and a Sardinian
strain, group 2 comprised of 2 Sicilian strains, group 3
contained a single Spanish strain, group 4 contained a single Spanish strain, groups 5 contained Sardinian strains,
group 6 contained Greeks strains, group 7 contained predominantly Greek strains but 2 Italian strains were also
found in this group and the type strain which originated
in Spain. There were also a large group, group 8, which
contained isolates of very diverse geographical origin with
isolates present from Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Macedonia.

Congruence between typing techniques
There was a high degree of congruence between PFGE and
VNTR analysis, with the exception of some strains in
VNTR group 1121 which were split into either PFGE
group 3 or group 4. VNTR analysis was capable of detecting much greater variation than PFGE analysis as many
isolates found to be identical using PFGE were capable of
being differentiated using VNTR analysis.

Simpson's index of diversity was calculated to be 0.324 for
PFGE and 0.574 for VNTR analysis.

Discussion
PFGE analysis
The restriction profiles of most of the strains were shown
to be closely related with only some small differences in
banding pattern. These profiles showed such close similarity that isolates were divided into 4 separate groups,
group 1, 2, 3 and 4 based on a cut-off value of 80% (figure
3). The vast majority of isolates (69 of 86, 77.52%) fell
into group 2 and gave largely indistinguishable profiles.
There was some degree of congruence between the groups
given using PFGE and the geographical origins of the isolates, Group 1 contained the single strain L9 from Gran
Canaria which was unique as it produced four bands,
group 2 contained another single Spanish strain 281F03
which unusually produced 5 bands, group 3 contained
mainly Greek isolates and group 4 contained isolates of
wide geographical origin including Portugal, Macedonia,
Sardinia and Italy. Spanish isolates were particularly heterogeneous and were found in all 4 groups. Three strains
were not typable using PFGE analysis. 84 of the 86 (98%)
of strains tested produced six restriction fragments using
SmaI. The fragments sizes were estimated to be 466, 174,
132, 91, 11 Kbp and a fragment that varied in size
between strains of between 58–72 Kbp. A representative
pulsed field gel is shown in figure 4.
RAPD analysis
All strains tested produced 8–12 amplicons ranging in size
of 0.5 and 1.5 Kb. Strain 81F03 gave completely different
profiles from that of other M. agalactiae strains (71% and
69% similarity respectively giving a DICE stringency of
1.3% and a 1% level of optimisation) (results not shown).
All other strains (87 out of 88, 98%) were within an 80%
margin of similarity. Due to the variable and random
nature of the technique, to validate reproducibility each
strain was tested three times and because of the very small
differences in banding pattern between isolates they clustered slightly differently on each repeat. Only isolates
281F03 and L9 were clearly different from all other isolates on each repeat. Due to the high level of genetic
homogeneity and inconsistent grouping of strains by this
typing method it would be impossible to subdivide these
stains with any confidence.

This study represents the first to apply VNTR analysis to
M. agalactiae. Previous studies have shown that M. agalactiae is largely genetically homogeneous but may be subject
to some degree of antigenic variation [8,9]. Analysis of 81
Italian isolates found that they were all completely homogeneous with no variation seen using PFGE analysis [8].
Insertion sequence analysis of M. agalactiae isolates with
wide geographical origin found some degree of variation
with some isolates containing the IS element ISMag and
other isolates lacking the element however it was not possible to subtype isolates using this method [30].
In our study, RAPD analysis was found to be unreliable
for typing M. agalactiae but PFGE was capable of dividing
these largely homogeneous isolates into 4 groups. VNTR
analysis was however far more effective and enabled us to
detect variation between M. agalactiae strains with the 88
isolates being divided into 9 VNTR types showing some
correlation between geographical origin and the VNTR
profiles of the isolates. Sardinian and Sicilian isolates
were particularly interesting as they were the most diverse
with isolates in many different VNTR groups whereas Portuguese isolates were found only within one group of
wide geographical origin (and did not have their own distinct group). Isolates from mainland Italy were also found
in many groups and did not fall into a group of distinct
geographical origin. These groupings may reflect the
degree of international trade of these countries with countries that are largely self sufficient with little import showing less heterogeneity in M. agalactiae isolates. Although
we believe that the groupings generated using VNTR analysis are significant and reliable, some care must be taken
when drawing inferences from a typing scheme based on
a small number of VNTRs and that it would be have been
interesting to include further VNTRs in the study had variation been detected in any other VNTRs.
Although mycoplasmas possess a reduced genome with
only the genes necessary for replication and survival, they
also possess a relatively large proportion of repetitive
DNA, For example, it is known that for some other Mycoplasma species, such as Mmm SC, the genome contains as

same degree of stock movement. Therefore, there is
greater opportunity for genetic exchange between M. bovis
isolates leading to a more heterogeneous population
structure compared with M. agalactiae. The two Mycoplasma species may also differ in genetic diversity because
of fundamental genetic differences, for example, M. bovis
contains a greater number of insertion sequences than M.
agalactiae.
Recent evidence has shown that M. agalactiae may have
undergone horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [33,34]. As
mycoplasmas have a reduced genome HGT is likely to be
important as it enables mollicutes to rapidly adapt by a
'quantum leap' in evolution and enables genes for a certain advantageous phenotype to be transferred in a single
block rather than by random point mutation and subsequent selection of strains with advantageous traits [35].
Interestingly some of the VNTRs found in this study are
within regions of the genome which are prone to variation
and involved in HGT. The pseudogene, MAG4310, in
which VNTR 19 was found, has been identified as being a
predicted lipoprotein which has undergone horizontal
gene transfer with members of the M. mycoides cluster.
This pseudogene may constitute a reservoir of sequence
whose purpose is to generate surface variability [34] and
hence it is not surprising that this region shows variation
between M. agalactiae strains. Another VNTR, VNTR 17,
which was found in the majority of strains tested, is in the
region of the pseudogene MAG4060 which has been
shown to be a pseudogene of an integrative conjugative
element (ICE) which is involved in HGT.

much as 29% repetitive DNA [31]. Therefore, it seems feasible that typing schemes based on analysis of repetitive
DNA may be useful for Mycoplasma species.
M. agalactiae is closely related to the cattle pathogen M.
bovis which was at one time a subspecies of M. agalactiae
[32]. The M. agalactiae population structure, however
appears to be dramatically different as it is subject to little
intraspecific variation compared with M. bovis which was
found to be highly heterogeneous when analysed using
AFLP, RAPD and PFGE [26]. This difference in genetic
diversity may reflect the distribution and movements of
their respective hosts. Whereas M. bovis is found in cattle
which are generally traded frequently over wide areas, M.
agalactiae is found in sheep which are not subjected to the

The ICE in M. agalactiae is a novel mobile genetic element
[33], homologous to that seen in M. fermentans [36],
which spreads from donor to recipient cells by conjugation and exists in both chromosomal and free circular
forms [33]. In this study we have demonstrated that conjugative elements, such as those seen within VNTR17, are
widespread in representative strains of M. agalactiae but
that the ICEs that encode these conjugative systems show
significant sequence variation between strains.

Conclusion
VNTR analysis provides a rapid, simple, molecular typing
technique that can enable the differentiation of M. agalactiae strains and may provide a method of outbreak tracing.
VNTR is also useful as it does not require the culture of
isolates and could, in theory, be used on infections involving mixed M. agalactiae strains. Finally it has the advantage when compared with many traditional typing
techniques that it is highly amenable to interlaboratory
comparison and does not require expensive or complex
automated analysis.
