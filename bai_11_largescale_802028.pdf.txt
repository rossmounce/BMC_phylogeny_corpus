Large-scale RNAi screen of G protein-coupled
receptors involved in larval growth, molting and
metamorphosis in the red flour beetle
Hua Bai1,2, Fang Zhu1, Kapil Shah1 and Subba Reddy Palli1*

Abstract
Background: The G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) belong to the largest superfamily of integral cell membrane
proteins and play crucial roles in physiological processes including behavior, development and reproduction.
Because of their broad and diverse roles in cellular signaling, GPCRs are the therapeutic targets for many
prescription drugs. However, there is no commercial pesticide targeting insect GPCRs. In this study, we employed
functional genomics methods and used the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as a model system to study the
physiological roles of GPCRs during the larval growth, molting and metamorphosis.
Results: A total of 111 non-sensory GPCRs were identified in the T. castaneum genome. Thirty-nine of them were
not reported previously. Large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen was used to study the function of all these
GPCRs during immature stages. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated knockdown in the expression of genes
coding for eight GPCRs caused severe developmental arrest and ecdysis failure (with more than 90% mortality after
dsRNA injection). These GPCRs include dopamine-2 like receptor (TC007490/D2R) and latrophilin receptor
(TC001872/Cirl). The majority of larvae injected with TC007490/D2R dsRNA died during larval stage prior to entering
pupal stage, suggesting that this GPCR is essential for larval growth and development.
Conclusions: The results from our study revealed the physiological roles of some GPCRs in T. castaneum. These
findings could help in development of novel pesticides targeting these GPCRs.

Background
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-transmembrane receptor proteins that sense external signals
and activate a variety of intercellular pathways. Binding
of signal molecules causes the activation of the heterotrimeric G protein complex. GPCRs are members of the
largest membrane receptor family, and the members of
this family are present in almost all the eukaryotes [1].
Genome annotation efforts identified about 200 GPCRs
in Drosophila melanogaster [2], 276 GPCRs in Anopheles
gambiae [3], and 90 GPCRs in Bombyx mori [4]. Interestingly, a large number of GPCRs belong to olfactory
and gustatory receptor classes [5]. So far about 60 olfactory receptors and 60 gustatory receptors were identified
in D. melanogaster [6-8]. In the honey bee, Apis

mellifera, genes coding for 35 neuropeptide receptors
and 19 biogenic amine receptors were identified [9].
Right after the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum
genome sequences published in 2008 [10], 72 neurohormone GPCRs were identified from Tribolium genome,
which includes 20 biogenic amine receptors, 48 neuropeptide receptors and four protein hormone receptors
[11]. Since most of the identified Tribolium GPCRs in
the above study belong to Class A Rhodopsin-like
GPCR, a comprehensive annotation is required for a
genome-wide functional analysis.
The large number and structural diversity among the
members of GPCR gene family made it difficult to systematically study their biological functions. However,
their diverse functions, such as the regulation of sense
of vision, smell and taste, behavioral and mood regulation, immune system and autonomic nervous system,
draw most attention in the pharmaceutical industry
[12,13]. About 40% of therapeutic drugs target human

GPCRs [14]. Insect development, reproduction, and various behaviors such as host finding and ecdysis, are also
under the control of GPCRs [15]. For example, several
GPCRs are known to participate in the regulation of
insect ecdysis behavior. These include ecdysis triggering
hormone receptor (ETHR), crustacean cardioactive peptide receptor (CcapR) and bursicon receptor (rk)
[16-18]. Many of these GPCRs belong to biogenic amine
and neuropeptide receptor families. Relatively few efforts
have been made to apply the knowledge of insect
GPCRs to the development of novel pest control methods such as the disruption of neuropeptide signaling systems using neuropeptide mimics [19,20]. Based on mode
of action classification issued by Insecticide Resistance
Action Committee (IRAC), there are no commercial
synthetic pesticides available that use insect GPCR as
targets http://www.irac-online.org. To discover GPCR
pesticide targets, we identified 111 non-sensory GPCRs
using BLAST search in the genome of the red flour beetle, T. castaneum. Thirty-nine of them are newly identified in this study. We then performed a large-scale
RNAi screen to determine the function of all 111 identified T. castaneum GPCRs. RNAi for 25 GPCRs resulted
in more than 30% mortality, including eight GPCRs
with more than 90% mortality. Knockdown in the
expression of the genes coding for these GPCRs severely
affected larval growth, wing development and ecdysis.
Finally, RNAi for one of the GPCRs, dopamine-2 like
receptor (TC007490/D2R), resulted in high lethality of
early larval growth suggesting TC007490 may play an
essential role in larval growth and development.

Results
Identification of non-sensory GPCR genes in T. castaneum

Because olfactory and gustatory receptor families contain large number of receptors and are highly diverse
multigene families, we excluded both chemo-sensory
GPCRs as well as opsins in this study to reduce the
amount of screen work. To identify non-sensory GPCRs
in T. castaneum genome, amino acid sequences of
known non-sensory GPCRs belonging to four different
classes were retrieved from the GPCR database,
GPCRDB http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/[21,22] and used as
queries to perform BLASTP searches against T. castaneum protein database (Glean predictions) downloaded
from Beetlebase http://beetlebase.org/ (Hereafter, we
will refer ‘non-sensory GPCR’ as ‘GPCR’). About 200
putative T. castaneum GPCRs with relative high homology to GPCRs of other species (E-values lower than 1010) were selected for the next round of search. NCBI
conserved domain search program http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml was used to verify the
presence of seven transmembrane domains (7TM) in all
putative GPCRs. 111 GPCRs out of 200 hits were

confirmed and classified into four different families:
Class A, Rhodopsin-like receptor; Class B, Secretin
receptor-like; Class C, Metabotropic glutamate receptorlike and Class D, Atypical GPCRs (see Additional file 1).
Out of these 111 GPCRs, 72 of them were previously
identified as biogenic amine and neuropeptide GPCRs
[11]. We have classified them into above four classes
based on conserved domain prediction program. The
deduced amino acid sequences of the newly identified T.
castaneum GPCRs were compared with that of D. melanogaster GPCRs. The closest homologues were identified
based on the phylogenetic analysis and sequence homology search (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).
As shown in Table 1, there are 74 Rhodopsin-like
GPCRs, 19 Secretin receptor-like GPCRs, 11 Metabotropic glutamate receptor-like GPCRs, and 7 Atypical
GPCRs. In Rhodopsin-like GPCR Class, there are 20
biogenic amine receptors (16 in B. mori and 22 in D.
melanogaster), 42 peptide receptors (35 in B. mori and
38 in D. melanogaster), four glycoprotein hormone
receptors (two in B. mori and four in D. melanogaster),
one purine receptor (one in B. mori and one in D. melanogaster) were identified in T. castaneum. A comprehensive review on neurohormone GPCRs in T.
castaneum by Hauser et al [11] is recommended for
further reading. Recently, GRHR-like receptors
TC009772 and TC001245 had been identified as adipokinetic hormone receptor (AKHR) [23] and AKH/corazonin-related peptide (ACP) receptor [24], respectively.
Methuselah receptors belong to Class B GPCR and are
involved in modulation of life span and stress response
in D. melanogaster [25]. Only three methuselah receptors were identified in T. castaneum compared to 15 in
D. melanogaster (see Additional files 1 and 3). In Class
C, three Metabotropic GABAB receptors (same number
as in D. melanogaster) and three metabotropic glutamate receptors (only one in D. melanogaster and one in
B. mori) were identified in T. castaneum (see Additional
files 1 and 4). The frizzled-like receptor belongs to Class
D Atypical GPCRs. This group of receptors share less
sequence conservation with the other GPCR families. In
T. castaneum there are three frizzled-like receptor genes
(four in D. melanogaster and two in B. mori), no ortholog for D. melanogaster frizzled 3 was found in T. castaneum genome (see Additional files 1 and 5).
RNAi screen to identify GPCRs involved in larval and
pupal development in T. castaneum

To study the role of each GPCR in regulating larval
development in T. castaneum, dsRNA for 111 T. castaneum GPCRs were synthesized and injected into oneday-old final instar larvae. Mortality and development
defects of dsRNA injected insects were recorded every
2-3 days until all adults eclosed. Escherichia coli malE

gene that encodes maltose-binding protein has been
used as an RNAi control in our lab for many years. It
has been proved to be a reliable control since injection
of dsRNA for malE gene doesn’t affect Tribolium larval
development, molting, growth and female reproduction.
In the first RNAi screen, we found that out of 111
GPCR RNAi, knockdown in the expression of 18
GPCRs in Class A, five in Class B and two in Class D
caused more than 30% of total mortality (see Additional
file 6). No severe mortality was observed in insects
injected with dsRNA for Class C GPCRs. To confirm
this result, we repeated RNAi experiment by injecting
dsRNA targeting identified 25 GPCRs. As shown in
Table 2, we found that most of mortality results are
repeatable, although there is some variation in stagespecific mortality. This variation may be due to synchronization issue of final instar larvae that were used for
dsRNA injection, since it may be critical for some
GPCRs to knock down their expression at the early
stage of final instar larva. Among 25 GPCRs tested,
there are genes coding for biogenic amine receptor
(TC007490/D2R), peptide receptors (TC013945/CcapR,
TC012493/ETHR, TC004716 and TC006805/CCHa2r),
and protein hormone receptors (TC008163/bursicon
receptor and TC009127/glycoprotein hormone-like
receptor). Silencing of genes coding for four GPCRs
(TC012521/stan, TC009370/mthl and TC001872/Cirl) in
Class B and two GPCRs (TC014055/fz and TC005545/
smo) in Class D also caused severe mortality (Table 2).
We observed that there is a clear stage-specific mortality
pattern among different GPCR RNAi insects. RNAi for
five GPCRs results in most lethality occurred during the
larval stage (Figure 1A), while RNAi for 12 GPCRs
caused relatively more pupal mortality than the larval
mortality (Figure 1B). This result suggests that each of
the identified GPCR may play critical roles at different
developmental stages.
Four genes were selected to check RNAi knockdown
efficiency (see Additional file 7). They are associated

with a range of mortality phenotype, e.g. TC007490
(100% total mortality), TC012521 (95% total mortality),
TC006805 (75.6% total mortality), TC013650 (47.7%
total mortality). About 50% or more knockdown efficiency was observed in dsRNA injected insects when
compared to insects injected with control malE dsRNA
for all four GPCRs tested. We also notice that knockdown efficiency is not reflecting how strong the phenotype is. For example, about 4-fold reduction on
TC006805 transcripts caused by TC006805 RNAi results
in 75.6% total mortality, while 2-fold reduction on
TC012521 transcripts caused by RNAi results in 95%
total mortality. Due to large amount of screen work, we
didn’t check RNAi knockdown efficiency for all GPCRs.
Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
absence of mortality phenotype is due to insufficient
silencing of target GPCRs. In our studies where the
expression of more than 500 genes was knocked down
in T. castaneum, the lack of phenotype is rarely due to
insufficient silencing [26-28]. RNAi works efficiently in
T. castaneum and we observed more than 50% of silencing for more than 95% of the genes tested.
Eight GPCRs are required for larval and pupal
development

The phenotypes caused by silencing genes coding for six
GPCRs, TC007490/D2R, TC001872/Cirl, TC012521/
stan, TC009370/mthl, TC014055/fz and TC005545/smo
were further investigated, since RNAi for these GPCRs
results in more than 90% of total mortality. We recently
reported characterization of TC008163/bursicon receptor RNAi phenotypes [29] and the study on TC013945/
CcapR had been published previously [17]. Therefore,
the roles of TC008163 and TC013945 on development
are not included in the current study. The majority of
insects injected with TC007490/D2R dsRNA died during
the larval stage and was not able to molt to the pupal
stage (Figure 2E). Only a few larvae injected with
TC007490/D2R dsRNA were able to reach quiescent

stage (a non-feeding prepupal stage, about 96 hr after
ecdysis into final instar), suggesting that this gene may
play an important role during larval growth and development rather than molting and metamorphosis. In
contrast, most of the insects injected with TC001872/
Cirl dsRNA entered the quiescent stage and died during
this stage (Figure 2F). About 40% of the insects injected
TC001872/Cirl dsRNA were able to molt to the pupal
stage and eventually died during the early pupal stage.
As shown in Figure 2F, the eyes continued to develop
and accumulate the ommatidia during the quiescent
stage in TC001872/Cirl RNAi insects, suggesting a premature eye development is triggered by TC001872/Cirl
silencing.
The majority of insects injected with TC012521/stan
dsRNA was not able to complete adult eclosion and died
during pharate adult stage. The majority of TC012521/
stan RNAi insects died from early eclosion arrest as their
wings were not able to invert to the dorsal side as in control insects (Figure 2G). These data suggest that the
pupal-adult ecdysis behavior was initiated but not completed in TC012521/stan RNAi insects.

Interestingly, TC014055/fz RNAi caused an arrest in
both larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis, suggesting
that TC014055/fz may play important roles in the regulation of ecdysis behavior. As shown in Figure 2H, a
split in the dorsal thoracic region was seen in the pharate pupae from TC014055/fz RNAi insects, indicating
that larval-pupal ecdysis began, but the shedding of
the larval cuticle was not completed. During the
pupal-adult ecdysis, the phenotypes of TC014055/fz
RNAi insects are similar to that of TC012521/stan
RNAi with the wings still attached to the ventral side
of the abdomen. The majority of insects injected with
TC005545/smo dsRNA died during the early pupal
stages without showing any ecdysis defects. However,
unlike in the control insects injected with malE
dsRNA (Figure 2C), the pupal wings were not fully
extended in TC005545/smo RNAi insects (Figure 2I).
Insects injected with TC009370/mthl dsRNA were
arrested at the late phase of larval-pupal and pupaladult ecdysis. Most of the body parts of TC009370/
mthl RNAi insects were able to escape from the old
cuticle, however, the wings were not able to fold

Figure 1 Comparison of larva and pupa mortality caused by GPCR RNAi in T. castaneum. Stage-specific mortality pattern among different
GPCR RNAi insects was compared. RNAi for five GPCRs results in most lethality occurred during the larval stage (Figure. 1A), while RNAi for 12
GPCRs caused relatively more pupal mortality than the larval mortality (Figure. 1B). dsRNA for malE (control) and selected T. castaneum GPCR

properly and the exuviae was still attached to the
abdomen (Figure 2J).
Expression pattern of GPCRs during the larval and pupal
stages

Real-time qRT-PCR was used to study the stage-specific
expression pattern of six identified GPCRs that are
involved in larval development and metamorphosis. The
mRNA levels of TC012521/stan showed two peaks during larval and pupal stages, one small peak at three-day
after ecdysis to the final instar larvae stage and one
large peak around one-day after ecdysis to the pupal
stage (Figure 3A). The mRNA levels of TC001872/Cirl
were the highest among seven GPCRs tested and the
mRNA levels during the pupal stage were higher relative
to that in the larval stage (Figure 3B). The mRNA levels

of TC007490/D2R were extremely lower in the middle
of final instar larval stage when compared to early and
late final instar larval stages. The mRNA levels of
TC007490/D2R remained high during the pupal stage
(Figure 3C). The mRNA levels of TC014055/fz were the
lowest among the 7 GPCRs tested (Figure 3D). Interestingly, TC005545/smo showed higher mRNA levels during the larval-pupal transition with a peak at one-day
after ecdysis to the pupal stage (Figure 3E). The mRNA
levels of TC009370/mthl were also relatively low and
two small peaks were detected at one-day and three-day
after ecdysis to the pupal stage (Figure 3F). Thus, the
stage-specific expression pattern of these GPCRs may
suggest that they play specific roles in the regulation of
larval growth as well as larval-pupal and pupal-adult
transition.

Discussion
Because of their diverse biological functions activated
by a wide range of ligands, GPCRs have been the targets for a majority of therapeutic drugs. However, to
date, no commercial insecticides have been developed
that target insect GPCRs http://www.irac-online.org.
Our large-scale RNAi screen for 111 annotated GPCRs
in T. castaneum identified 18 genes in Class A, five
genes in Class B and two genes in Class D whose
RNAi resulted in more than 30% larvae and pupae
mortality, suggesting they may play important roles in
larval growth, development and metamorphosis.
Among these genes, silencing of six of them
(TC007490/D2R, TC001872/Cirl, TC012521/stan,
TC009370/mthl, TC014055/fz and TC005545/smo)
caused more than 90% mortality during the final instar
larval and pupal stages. A majority of the insects
injected with dsRNA for TC007490/D2R died as larvae.
These data suggest that TC007490/D2R is one of the
essential GPCRs for normal larval growth and development. Therefore, TC007490/D2R is one of the potential targets for the development of novel pesticides for
controlling the red flour beetle and related insect pests.

Unlike the dopamine 1-like receptor, D2R transduces
second-messenger signaling via inhibitory G proteins
(Gai/o), which leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase
and modulation of ion channels [30]. D2R RNAi flies
showed decreased locomotor activity [31]. In D. melanogaster, D2R is one of the highly expressed genes in the
head and brain http://www.flyatlas.org/ and D2R RNAi
in a primary neuron culture caused an excessive branching phenotype (36), suggesting its important role in early
neuronal development and central nerve system function. Since TC007490/D2R RNAi beetles died during
the larval stage, TC007490/D2R might be playing a critical role in the growth and development of larvae perhaps by modulating neuronal development and
locomotor activity as reported in D. melanogaster. However, further research is needed to determine the precise
mechanism of TC007490/D2R function in the regulation
of growth and development of T. castaneum larvae. The
biological function for Cirl, the other GPCR identified in
our RNAi screen as that required for larval growth and
development, is not known. However, in vertebrates this
receptor is activated by a neurotoxin found in the
venom of the black widow spider [32]. TC001872/Cirl

Bai et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:388
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/388

could be another interesting target for development of
novel pesticides.
In contrast to TC007490/D2R RNAi, three other
GPCR RNAi results significant pupal lethality, rather
than larval lethality. They are TC008163/bursicon receptor, TC006805/CCHa2r and TC003150/sNPF-R.
Recently, the role of bursicon receptor (rk) in larval
development was identified in D. melanogaster [18].
When D. melanogaster rk expression was down-regulated by transgenic RNAi, the majority of progeny died
at pupal stage. Similar to our previous study [30], rk
expression is required in developing epidermal tissue
and imaginal discs in D. melanogaster [18]. Early this
year, two Drosophila GPCRs code for novel receptors
for CCHamide-1 and -2 were deorphanized [31]. In B.
mori, one of the CCHamide receptor genes is expressed
in central nervous system and gut, however, the biological function for this neuropeptide receptor is unknown
[32]. In the present study, we found knockdown of one
of the putative CCHamide receptors (TC006805/
CCHa2r) in T. castaneum results in relative high mortality in pupal stage, indicating that this novel neuropeptide receptor may play a role during the metamorphosis.
Further studies are needed to investigate the specific
function of the CCHamide receptor during larval or
pupal development. In Drosophila, short neuropeptide F
(sNPF) and its receptor sNPFR1 regulate expression of
insulin-like peptide in brain IPC neurons [33]. Therefore
the biological function of sNPF has been linked to
growth, metabolism and aging. Although we didn’t find
a huge mortality by knocking down TC003150/sNPF-R,
RNAi for TC003150 caused higher pupal lethality than
larval lethality, suggesting its critical role in pupal development, probably imaginal disc growth.
Among eight GPCR RNAi that result severe mortality,
insects injected with TcCcapR2 dsRNA were not able to
complete adult eclosion and died during the pharate
adult stage. Our data showed that the pupal-adult ecdysis behavior was initiated but not completed in
TcCcapR2 RNAi insects. In D. melanogaster, Ccap-cell
ablation resulted in deficiencies in both pupal and adult
ecdysis [33,34]. Similarly, a recent study on Ccap and its
receptors in T. castaneum showed that Ccap and
CcapR2 RNAi caused the ecdysis deficiency associated
with weak reverse-bending, wing air-filling and anteriorposterior (A-P) contractions [17]. In addition,
TC012521/stan, a cadherin-related GPCR involved in
tissue polarity, was also found to play a role in pupaladult ecdysis. The D. melanogaster tissue polarity gene
stan (starry night) possesses a huge protocadherin
domain containing nine cadherin motifs, four EGF-like
motifs, and two laminin G motifs. Flies with stan
mutant in the wing show cell autonomous wing hair
polarity defects [35], while stan mutant in the eye show

Page 8 of 11

the tissue polarity defects in the ommatidia [36]. The
dependence of proper stan localization on Frizzled (Fz)
activity suggests that stan functions downstream of Fz
in controlling planar polarity [37]. Interestingly, RNAi
for Frizzled in T. castaneum caused the arrest in both
larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. A split in the dorsal thoracic region was seen in the pharate pupae, indicating larval-pupal ecdysis began but pupae were not
able to come out of the larval cuticle. Frizzled is a wingless receptor and a tissue polarity gene. In D. melanogaster, frizzled mutants show strong wing-hair
disorientation, negligible segment-polarity of homozygous embryos, altered polarity of bristles and hairs on
the adult abdomen and thorax [38,39]. Silencing of
another tissue polarity gene, TC005545/smo, did not
result in any arrest of ecdysis, but caused defects in
wing expansion. Smoothened (smo) is thought to be a
component of the Hedgehog receptor. Smo mutation
caused embryonic lethality. In smo mutants, all denticles
in abdominal segments point posterior. Smo is also
required for decapentaplegic (dpp) expression in wing
discs during the metamorphosis [40]. Taken together,
these data suggest that smo regulates wing development
during the postembryonic stages in a conserved manner
across insect species. These results also indicate that the
tissue polarity-regulating GPCRs play critical roles during molting and metamorphosis in T. castaneum.
Interestingly, one of the aging-related GPCRs,
TC009370/mthl, was found to be involved in both larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. The Methuselah-like
receptors (mthl) play an important role in aging and
reproduction. Mutation of mthl resulted from a P-element insertion in D. melanogaster extended the life
span and enhanced the resistance to free radicals and
starvation [25]. Flies homozygous for the mthl mutation
showed pre-adult lethality. However, there is no phenotypic data for the Methuselah-like 5 receptor (mthl5)
mutant fly. In this study, we found that out of three
Methuselah-like receptors, only TC009370/mthl regulates larval-pupal and pupal-adult ecdysis. This is similar
to the pre-adult lethality observed in D. melanogaster
mthl mutants.
Here we hope to identify GPCRs that could be served
as potential pesticide targets, which can be used in small
molecule screen, or the development of RNAi-based
pesticides. Among the identified GPCRs, many of them
belong to classic GPCRs, e.g. biogenic amine receptors
(TC007490/D2R and TC011960/5-HTR) and neuropeptide receptors (TC009127/glycoprotein hormone-like
receptor). These GPCRs can be used as potential targets
for novel pesticide development. On the other hand, it
may not be possible to apply small molecule ligands for
pest management through targeting identified atypical
GPCRs (e.g. TC014055/fz and TC005545/smo), however,

Bai et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:388
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/388

it is possible to develop a RNAi-based pest control strategy through ingestion of specific dsRNA targeting atypical GPCRs as well as classical GPCRs [29].

Conclusions
Large-scale RNAi screen has been successfully used in
dissecting signal transduction networks in vitro [41,42],
or biological processes in vivo [43]. In this study, we
performed a non-sensory GPCR screen and identified at
least six GPCRs that are required for either larval development or ecdysis behavior. Our study provides a systematic functional analysis on GPCRs in T. castaneum
and increases our understanding on the function of
insect GPCR in the regulation of post-embryonic development. In addition the identified GPCR genes could be
potential pesticide targets for development of novel
insecticides. Insecticide resistance has become a serious
problem in controlling many insect pests that damage
crops and transmit diseases. In Africa, the malaria vector, A. gambiae shows increasing levels of resistance to
pyrethroid insecticides resulting from knock-down resistance (kdr) mutation [44] and overexpressed cytochrome
P450 [45], which has significant impact on malaria prevention and control. Alternative control agents have to
be developed to manage populations of insecticide-resistant pest insects. Since the GPCR receptor family has
been successfully used as targets of many therapeutic
drugs, it may be possible to develop pesticides that target GPCRs. The identified GPCRs in our study could be
used as targets for development of novel pesticides.

Larvae were anaesthetized using ether vapors for 5 min,
and then placed on double-sided sticky tape over a glass
slide. 50-100 nl of dsRNA was injected into a larva on
the lateral side of the second or third abdominal segments using an aspirator tube assembly (Sigma) fitted
with a 3.5 inch glass capillary tube (Drummond) pulled
by a needle puller (Model P-2000, Sutter Instruments
Co., Novato, CA). Injected larvae were allowed to
recover for 1 hour at room temperature, and then transferred to 30°C incubator. Control larvae were injected
with dsRNA for E. coli malE gene. dsRNA for E. coli
malE gene was amplified using LITMUS 28iMal control
plasmid (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) as a template. Mortality and development defects of dsRNA
injected insects were recorded every 2-3 days until all
adults eclosed.

Methods

Total RNA was extracted from the whole bodies of
staged larvae and pupae using TRI reagent (Molecular
Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). cDNA synthesis
by reverse transcription was performed using 2 μg of
DNase I treated RNA and iScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in a 20 μl reaction
volume. qRT-PCR was performed using MyiQ single
color real-time PCR detection system (Biorad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in a 20 μl total reaction volume.
Both the PCR efficiency and correlation coefficient were
taken into account prior to estimating the relative gene
expression. To determinate the stable housekeeping
gene, the expression of five reference genes were examined across 72 cDNA samples collected from different
developmental stages. Using normalization software
package Bestkeeper [48], ribosomal protein rpL32/rp49
(GenBank accession no. XM_964471) has been found to
be the least-variable reference gene (see Additional file 8
for more detail). Therefore all gene expression levels
were normalized to rp49 by a standard curve based
method [49,50]. Mean and standard errors for each time
point were obtained from the averages of three

Beetle rearing and staging

Strain GA-1 of T. castaneum was reared on organic
wheat flour containing 10% yeast at 30°C under standard
conditions [46]. The final instar larvae were identified as
soon as they molted using untanned white cuticle [47].
The 4th instar larvae were identified based on the head
capsule width (about 300-400 μm).
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis

Primers containing GPCR gene sequences and T7 polymerase promoter (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) at
the 5’-end of both the forward primer and reverse primer
were used to amplify the 200-600 bp regions (Primer
sequences available upon request). The PCR product was
used as a template for dsRNA synthesis using the Ambion
MEGAscript transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).
dsRNA was purified using a Phenol/chloroform extraction
followed by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in nuclease-free water to a concentration of 3-5 μg/μl. The quality
of dsRNA was checked by running on an agarose gel and
the concentration was measured using NanoDrop1000

Imaging and documentation

RNAi phenotypes were photographed using the modular
zoom system (Leica Z16 APO, Germany) fitted with
JVC 3CCD Digital Camera KY-F75U. The images were
documented using Cartograph version 6.1.0 (GT Vision
Demonstration) and processed using Archimed version
5.2.2 (Micovision Instruments).

independent biological replicates. Primer sequences are
available upon request.

Additional file 8: Selection of stable reference gene using
BestKeeper. To determinate the stable housekeeping gene, the
expression of five reference genes were examined across 72 cDNA
samples collected from different developmental stages (Larva day 1 to
day 5, Quiescent larva day 1 and day 2, Pupa day 0 to day 6, Adult day 0
to day 2). (A). Based on the two most important criteria for evaluating
the stability of reference genes by Bestkeeper program [48], the stability
(SD value) and the relation to the BestKeeper index (r and P-value), five
reference genes, Actin, Elongation factor 1-a (Ef1a), Ribosomal protein
49 (Rp49), Ribosomal protein s3 (Rps3), and Tubulin alpha 6 (Tubulina6)
are all stable in different developmental stages of T. castaneum. From the
analysis, rp49 was chosen as the reference gene to calculate relative
expression levels because it showed the most stable expression among
samples. (B). Stable expression of five reference genes, Actin, Ef1a, Rp49,
Rps3, and Tubulina6 are shown across 12 RNA samples isolated from
different developmental stages (LD1: Larva day 1; Q1: Quiescent larva day
1; PD0: Pupa day 0; AD0: Adult day 0). Products obtained after 40 cycles
of PCR amplification under conditions described in the Materials and
Methods section were resolved on an agarose gel.

Phylogenetic tree building

Full length GPCR protein sequences of the T. castaneum and one closest homologue for each GPCR from
D. melanogaster were aligned in ClustalW. From these
alignments, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using
MEGA 4.0 program [51], according to the neighborjoining method with a bootstrap test calculated with
1000 replicates and a poisson correction model.
Statistical analysis

Student’s t-Test and analysis of variance was performed
using JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to test for
statistical differences among treatments (a = 0.05). Pairwise comparisons were made using Tukey-Kramer HSD
method.
