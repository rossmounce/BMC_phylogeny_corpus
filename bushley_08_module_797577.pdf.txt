Abstract
Background: Most filamentous ascomycete fungi produce high affinity iron chelators called
siderophores, biosynthesized nonribosomally by multimodular adenylating enzymes called
nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). While genes encoding the majority of NRPSs are
intermittently distributed across the fungal kingdom, those encoding ferrichrome synthetase
NRPSs, responsible for biosynthesis of ferrichrome siderophores, are conserved, which offers an
opportunity to trace their evolution and the genesis of their multimodular domain architecture.
Furthermore, since the chemistry of many ferrichromes is known, the biochemical and structural
'rules' guiding NRPS substrate choice can be addressed using protein structural modeling and
evolutionary approaches.
Results: A search of forty-nine complete fungal genome sequences revealed that, with the
exception of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, none of the yeast, chytrid, or zygomycete genomes
contained a candidate ferrichrome synthetase. In contrast, all filamentous ascomycetes queried
contained at least one, while presence and numbers in basidiomycetes varied. Genes encoding
ferrichrome synthetases were monophyletic when analyzed with other NRPSs. Phylogenetic
analyses provided support for an ancestral duplication event resulting in two main lineages. They
also supported the proposed hypothesis that ferrichrome synthetases derive from an ancestral
hexamodular gene, likely created by tandem duplication of complete NRPS modules. Recurrent
losses of individual domains or complete modules from this ancestral gene best explain the diversity
of extant domain architectures observed. Key residues and regions in the adenylation domain
pocket involved in substrate choice and for binding the amino and carboxy termini of the substrate
were identified.
Conclusion: Iron-chelating ferrichrome synthetases appear restricted to fission yeast, filamentous
ascomycetes, and basidiomycetes and fall into two main lineages. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that
loss of domains or modules led to evolution of iterative biosynthetic mechanisms that allow
flexibility in biosynthesis of the ferrichrome product. The 10 amino acid NRPS code, proposed
earlier, failed when we tried to infer substrate preference. Instead, our analyses point to several
regions of the binding pocket important in substrate choice and suggest that two positions of the
code are involved in substrate anchoring, not substrate choice.

Background
Most filamentous ascomycete fungi produce high affinity
iron chelator siderophores for scavenging environmental
iron and for cellular sequestration of reactive iron [1]. All
known fungal siderophores are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) [2], large, usually multimodular enzymes that catalyze peptide bond formation
independent of ribosomes. NRPS modules consist of
three core domains, ordered 5'A-T-C 3': 1) an adenylation
(A) domain responsible for recognizing and activating a
substrate molecule via adenylation with ATP, 2) a thiolation (T) domain which binds the substrate to the NRPS
protein and 3) a condensation (C) domain which joins
two substrates through a condensation reaction.
Although the number of NRPSs encoded by individual filamentous fungi varies from 0 to > 20, most of these and
their corresponding metabolites are not conserved across
the fungal kingdom, making it difficult to trace the evolutionary history of the corresponding genes. Various evolutionary processes may account for this. The observation
that A-T-C modules from a single NRPS often group
together as a monophyletic clade suggests tandem duplication of modules as a possible mechanism by which
multimodular NRPSs arise [3]. It is clear, however, that
other mechanisms such as recombination and gene conversion also operate [4]. Ferrichrome synthetases, which
biosynthesize
ferrichromes,
fungal
hydroxamate
siderophores that function primarily in intracellular iron
storage, are among the most conserved NRPSs, offering an
opportunity to trace the evolutionary history of the corresponding genes across fungi.
The chemical products of ferrichrome synthetases have
been characterized for at least one member of the majority
of Ascomycete and Basidiomycete orders [5,6]. This class
of siderophore includes compounds such as ferricrocin,
ferrichrome, ferrichrome A, ferrichrome C, and malonichrome. Most ferrichrome siderophores are cyclic hexapeptides
[Fig.
1],
with
the
exceptions
of
tetraglycylferrichrome, a cyclic heptapeptide, and desdiserylglycerylferrirhodin (DDF) a linear tripeptide of ornithine residues [7]. The chemical structure of ferrichromes
is also conserved, consisting of six substrate molecules: a
core heme-binding unit consisting of three N5-acyl-N5hydroxy-L-ornithines (AHO) and a ring of three amino
acids (Fig. 1). One amino acid is always a glycine, while
the remaining two amino acids can be alanine, serine, or
glycine [5,7]. Ferrichrome has three glycines, ferrichrome
A has two serines and one glycine, ferrichrome C and
malonichrome have two glycines and one alanine, and
ferricrocin has two glycines and one serine [7]. Acyl
groups attached to AHO substrates can also vary (Fig. 1).

Substrate specificity of NRPSs is believed to be mediated
by the A domain [8-10] although some studies have suggested a role for the C domain in selective acceptance of
substrates from the A domain [8,11]. A 10 amino acid
(AA) NRPS substrate specificity "code" consisting of single, nonadjacent amino acid residues in the A domain has
been proposed, based primarily on examination of bacterial NRPS A domains [9,12]. Few of these have been tested
experimentally and the extent to which this code is applicable to fungal NRPS A domains remains unknown [13].
Since the chemical structure and composition of
siderophores produced by fungal ferrichrome synthetases
is largely conserved, phylogenetic and structural analyses
of these proteins provide an opportunity to correlate protein structure and candidate specificity residues of the A
domains with known chemical products.
Ferrichrome siderophores perform key functions in fungal
cells. Early work on Neurospora crassa suggested that ferricrocin aids in asexual spore germination by storing iron
reserves within spores [14,15]. This role in asexual development has been confirmed for ferrichrome-type
siderophores of other fungal species such as Penicillium
chrysogenum [16] and Aspergillus nidulans [17]. In contrast,
Cochliobolus heterostrophus and Fusarium graminearum
intracellular siderophores have a major role in sexual
spore development, but no obvious role in asexual development [18]. A role in sexual development has also been

described for intracellular siderophores of A. nidulans
[19]. Intracellular siderophores are thought to buffer
against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the
Haber-Weiss-Fenton reaction in the presence of unbound
iron, by sequestering cellular free iron [16]. Indeed, A. nidulans mutants lacking ability to produce intracellular
siderophores show increased levels of intracellular free
iron [17] and a corresponding increase in sensitivity to
ROS [19]. C. heterostrophus mutants lacking ability to
make intracellular siderophores, however, are like wildtype (WT) strains in terms of sensitivity to ROS, although
mutants lacking extracellular siderophores do show
increased sensitivity to ROS [20].
These subtle functional differences observed between
intracellular ferrichrome synthetase mutantsof C. heterostrophus and A. nidulans, as well as the presence of two or
more copies of the genes encoding ferrichrome synthetases in some fungal species suggested the hypothesis
that more than one lineage of NPS genes may be responsible for intracellular siderophore biosynthesis in fungi. In
this study, we sought to: 1) identify homologs of C. heterostrophus and A. nidulans ferrichrome synthetases in a phylogenetically representative sample of fungal genomes, 2)
address the hypothesis of two distinct lineages of ferrichrome synthetases 3) analyze the structural evolution of
enzymatic domains encoded by these genes by phylogenetic analysis, and 4) investigate key positions in A
domains that may be involved in substrate specificity.

Methods
Genomes surveyed for ferrichrome-associated
nonribosomal peptide synthetases
Candidate homologs of C. heterostrophus NPS2 [3,18] and
A. nidulans SidC [19] were identified through blastp and
tblastn searches using individual A domains from both
NPS2 and SidC proteins as a query set. Fungal genome
datasets interrogated included those at the Broad Institute
http://www.broad.mit.edu/ (A. nidulans, Aspergillus terreus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatis, Botrytis cinerea, Candida
albicans, Candida guilliermondii, Candida lusitaniae, Chaetomium globosum, Coccidioides immitis, Coprinus cinereus,
Cryptococcus neoformans, F. graminearum, Histoplasma capsulatum, Magnaporthe grisea, N. crassa, Rhizopus oryzae,
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Stagonospora nodorum, Uncinocarpus reesii, and Ustilago maydis), the Sanger Institute
(Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus fumigatus), the
Joint Genome Institute http://www.jgi.doe.gov/ (Laccaria
bicolor, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma reesii, Phanerochaete
chrysosporium, and Phycomyces blakesleeanus), the DOGAN
database http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/ngac/e/rib40-e.html
(Aspergillus oryzae), and the raw genome sequence of Alternaria brassicicola, available at Washington University
http://genome.wustl.edu. The all fungal blast portal at the
Saccharomyces Genome Database http://seq.yeastge

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/328

nome.org/cgi-bin/blast-fungal.pl was used to survey the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome and those of a number of
other wild yeast species (Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces castellii, Saccharomyces kluyveri, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces paradoxicus,
Saccharomyces servizzii, Saccharomyces unisporus, Ashbyagossypii, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilopsis, Candida
tropicalis, Kluveromyces delphensis, Kluveromyces lactis, Kluveromyces marxianus, Kluveromyces thermotolerans, Kluveromyces waltii, Lodderomyces elongisporus, and Yarrowia
lypolitica).
All hits with an e value less than e-10 were extracted and an
initial phylogenetic analysis used to identify a putative set
of ferrichrome NRPSs. The individual A domains of all
candidate ferrichrome synthetase NRPSs were aligned
with Tcoffee and a phylogeny constructed using the WAG
model plus gamma with 100 bootstrap replicates in
PhyML [21]. A domains of 12 additional NRPSs found in
C. heterostrophus, representative of the diverse clades of
fungal NRPSs [3], as well as the top bacterial hit (NCBI
Accession YP_049592) to both NPS2 and SidC, were used
as outgroups in this initial analysis and in further analyses
of the complete dataset [3]. A monophyletic clade with
bootstrap support > 85% containing all known ferrichrome synthetase NRPSs was identified and all members
of this clade were considered in further analyses (see Additional file 1). Two additional known ferrichrome
siderophores, one from Aureobasidium pullulans
(AAD00581) [6] and one from Omphalotus olearius (fso1,
AAX49356) [22] were included. Several NRPSs identified
previously as putative siderophore metabolite producers
(designated the SidE clade) [23], which fell in a clade just
outside the major clade of known ferrichrome synthetases, were also included.
Annotation of candidate ferrichrome synthetases
Candidate ferrichrome synthetases were annotated by 1)
using the candidate NRPS proteins as queries against the
PFAM database and 2) utilizing NRPS specific HMM models built using HMMER [24] from a larger dataset of fungal
NRPS A and C domains (KE Bushley and BG Turgeon,
manuscript in preparation). Discrepancies between the
two methods and with published domain architectures
were resolved by manual inspection and adjustment. Individual A domains were extracted using a customized Perl
script (available upon request) and the limits of the A
domain were defined as in Lee et al [3], spanning from
~33 residues upstream of the A1 core motif to three residues downstream of the A10 core motif [12].

Several proteins identified appeared to be incomplete or
incorrectly annotated in the databases. The gene corresponding to B. cinerea BC1G15494 (see Additional file 1)
is on the end of supercontig 180; we assumed it is incom-

plete, as it encodes only a single A-T-C module. We reannotated the genes corresponding to HCAG07428 and
HCAG07429 as a single gene. The sequence corresponding to H. capsulatum HCAG07428 spanning the first C and
second A domains is of low quality; the second A domain
and the second and sixth C domains are missing from our
analyses. Similarly, U. reesii UREG00890 and
UREG00891 appear to correspond to a single gene. C. cinerea CC1G04210 is unusual in that it contains only a single A-T-C module followed by a T-C repeat. Inspection of
sequences flanking this gene did not reveal additional A,
T, or C domains.
Phylogenetic analyses
Complete set of A domains
A domain protein sequences were aligned to the crystal
structure of the A domain of Gramicidin synthetase
(GrsA) [25] using 3D-Coffee with the Blosum 62 substitution matrix and default gap opening and extension
parameters [26]. Because the alignment of these highly
divergent proteins contained regions of ambiguous alignment, we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the
effect of the alignment on the final phylogeny obtained.
Starting with the final manually adjusted alignment of A
domains, we created and analyzed three different alignments, using maximum likelihood (ML): 1) an alignment
retaining the majority of divergent regions, 2) a semi-conservative alignment omitting the most divergent regions
(i.e., those with more than 70% gaps per column in the
alignment), and 3) a highly conservative alignment with
all divergent regions with more than 50% gaps per column removed. The WAG substitution matrix with rate variation described by a gamma distribution with 4 rate
categories was identified as the best protein substitution
model for this dataset according to the AIC criterion using
Protest [27]. ML analyses using the WAG model plus
gamma in PhyML showed that the three alignments produced identical topologies for the major clades with only
slight differences in groupings of taxa within each clade
(available upon request). We used the semi conservative
alignment for all further analyses. Phylogenetic analyses
were conducted with PhyML using the WAG amino acid
substitution model and gamma distribution with 4 rate
categories and estimated alpha parameter and 500 bootstrap replicates [21] and with Mr. Bayes using 5 million
MCMC generations sampled every 100 generations with a
mixed AA prior [28].

The program Genetree [29] was used to reconcile the ML
tree to a species tree (see Additionals file 2 and 6) to infer
a history of A domain duplications using both duplication
and loss as the optimality criterion. The species tree was
based on three recent phylogenetic studies of the fungal
kingdom [30-32]. These studies agree on placement of all
taxa included in this study except the Dothideomycetes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/328

whose placement remains unstable. In different types of
analyses they have grouped with Eurotiomycetes [31], as
more closely related to Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes [31], or as basal to all three of these classes [30,31].
We chose to place the Dothideomycetes as sister to other
filamentous ascomycetes in the subphylum Pezizomycotina as they are placed in this position in phylogenies
with larger taxon sampling [30] and this placement agrees
with another recent phylogenomic study [33] (see Additional file 2 and 6). A. pullulans was shown to have
diverged earlier than our other sampled Dothideomycete
taxa in a recent class wide phylogeny of Dothideomycetes
and is thus placed at the base of the Dothideomycete clade
[34].
Individual lineage analyses
To analyze mechanisms of evolution of the genes encoding ferrichrome synthetase proteins in more detail, those
enzymes grouping with C. heterostrophus NPS2 and those
grouping with A. nidulans SidC in phylogenetic analyses
of the complete A domain dataset (see above) were examined separately. For each group, A and C domains were
extracted using the Perl script described above. T domains
were excluded, as they are significantly shorter (66 amino
acids versus 300 amino acids) and resulted in highly unresolved phylogenies. The limits of the A domain were
defined as described above while the C domain was
delimited
according
to
the
PFAM
model
(PFAM00668)http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/
and extends from four residues before the C1 motif to four
residues after the C5 motif. Each domain was aligned separately with TCOFFEE using default parameters and phylogenetic analyses were conducted with PhyML and Mr.
Bayes using the same parameters described above for the
larger dataset. We used A and C domains from the first
complete A-T-C module of the SidE group as an outgroup
as this module grouped directly outside the major clade of
ferrichrome synthetases in both the ML and Bayesian trees
while the second module grouped consistently with other
types of fungal NRPSs represented by the other C. heterostrophus NRPSs.

As the majority of NRPS genes are multimodular, tandem
duplication represents a plausible hypothesis for the generation of a multimodular gene from a single A-T-C unit.
To evaluate this hypothesis, we constructed phylogenies
in PhyML of a representative ferrichrome synthetase from
each lineage, i.e., C. heterostrophus NPS2 and A. nidulans
SidC for the NPS2 and NPS1/SidC lineages, respectively.
These trees were evaluated using the Possible Duplication
History (PDH) algorithm developed to determine if a
phylogeny is consistent with a history of tandem duplication [35].

Substrate specificity
Structural modeling
Three-dimensional models of A domains were generated
by using template-based modeling techniques. Blast
searches [36,37] of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database
[38]http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do, using a
subset of A domain sequences from C. heterostrophus NPS2
(AAX09984), F. graminearum NPS2 (FG05372), F.
graminearum NPS1 (FG11026), A. nidulans SidC
(AN0607), U. maydis sid2 (UM05165), U. maydis fer3
(UM01434), and S. pombe Sib1 (CAB72227) as queries,
indicated a high level of similarity with the phenylalanine
activating A domain of the NRPS for gramicidin (GrsA),
PDB code: 1AMU; [25]. Using the Combinatorial Extension method [39] and the 1AMU_A (ie., monomer A of
1AMU) structure as input, other structurally similar proteins with associated crystal structures were identified. The
structures of the monomers of 1AMU_A, 1PG3_A,
1ULT_A, 1LC_I, 1T5D_X and 1MD9_A were superimposed and a structural alignment of these was produced
manually with the help of graphic tools included in the
commercial programs ICM (MOLSOFT Inc) and DS-Modeling (Accelrys Inc.). The objective of having a structural
alignment of multiple proteins is to better define the
regions of the fold that are conserved and understand
where structural variability can occur.

The subset of our NRPS A domain sequences (described
above) were selected for structural modeling and added to
the structural alignment. The alignment was corrected
manually by adjusting the positions of insertions and
deletions that were incompatible with the secondarystructure elements observed in the 3-dimensional (3D)
structures of the templates. All residues forming the walls
of the binding pocket for the Phe substrate in 1AMU_A as
well as residues that bind the adenosine monophosphate
AMP moiety were identified. In addition, residues aligned
with the 10 amino acid positions (10AA code) predicted
to be involved in substrate specificity in the GrsA
sequence [9], as well as three additional residues identified by Schwecke et al. [6] to be important in binding the
AHO substrate (13AA code) were identified in the structural alignment. The Cartesian coordinates of the template structures were retrieved from the PDB [38], and the
final multiple alignment of the experimental and template structures were used as input data for MODELLER
[40-43]. During the process of model generation, MODELLER minimizes the violations of distance and dihedralangle restraints derived from the templates. For each
sequence a set of 3D models were generated and those
that best satisfied the set of restraints were kept. More than
one template structure was used during the model generation process in order to assess the variability of the different regions of the A domain structures.

Evolutionary approaches to identify specificity residues
We utilized several amino acid based methods to detect
residues with a potential role in specificity. These included
the specificity-determining positions (SDPpred) algorithm [44] and server http://math.genebee.msu.ru/~psn/
and Type I and Type II functional divergence, two likelihood based methods in the DIVERGE 2 package to detect
functional residues [45,46]. Type I functional divergence
detects changes in evolutionary rates between clusters
indicative of changes in constraint or selective pressure,
while both the SDP algorithm and Type II functional
divergence aim to identify residues that are conserved
within a cluster but show a change in amino acid properties between clusters. For these analyses, we used the
major groups identified in our ML analysis of all A
domains as individual clusters. The second A domain of S.
pombe sib1 and the third A domain of O. olearius fso1 were
omitted because both are highly divergent from other A
domains and likely degenerate as they lack several core
functional motifs [6,9]. The Dothideomycete module 3 A
domain was grouped with the cluster for the second A.
nidulans SidC A domain, as all methods used require clusters of greater than three taxa and our data suggested that
all of these domains code for the same amino acid.

Results
Distribution of ferrichrome synthetases in fungi
With the exception of S. pombe none of the yeast, chytrid,
or zygomycete genomes surveyed contained a candidate
ferrichrome synthetase NRPS. In contrast, all filamentous
ascomycete genomes queried contained at least one and
many had two (Table 1). B. cinerea appears to have three.
For the five basidiomycete genomes examined, two
known NRPSs (sid2 and fer3) were found in U. maydis,
one undescribed ferrichrome synthetase was identified in
C. cinerea while P. chrysosporium, L. bicolor, and C. neoformans lacked genes encoding these enzymes. As noted earlier, the ferrichrome synthetase fso1 is known from the
basidiomycete O. olearius [22].
Domain architecture of ferrichrome synthetases
Ferrichrome NRPSs show a diversity of domain architectures (Fig. 2). These have been designated 'types' [6] and
we use this terminology here. We found six types, including five previously identified. All are modular (except
Type VI), consisting of three to four complete A-T-C modules usually followed by a T-C repeat. C. heterostrophus
NPS2, as described previously [3,20], has four complete
A-T-C modules and a terminal T-C repeat (Type V). This
structure is conserved in NPS2 homologs from the other
Dothideomycetes examined (A. brassicicola and S. nodorum). In contrast, most other ferrichrome synthetases
examined (Types I â IV) have only three complete A-T-C
modules and a terminal T-C repeat. U. maydis sid2 (Type
I) is an exception, with a single terminal T-C unit. S. pombe

sib1 (Type III) is the only representative of its class; the
second complete modulehas a degenerate A domain in
which many of the signature motifs are missing [6] and an
internal T-C unit after the first complete A-T-C module.
Similarly, all Type IV NPS2 homologs (e.g., F. graminearum NPS2) have an internal T-C after the second complete A-T-C module. The only representative of Type VI, C.
cinerea CC1G04210), has a singleA-T-C module followed
by a T-C repeat.
SidE proteins, suggested by Cramer et al [23] to be putative ferrichrome synthetases have a different domain
organization from known ferrichrome synthetases. They
consist of only two complete modules and an additional
N-terminal C domain (5'C-A-T-C-A-T-C3'), except for A.
fumigatus Afu3g03350 and Afu3g15270 which lack the Nterminal C domain(5'A-T-C-A-T-C3').
Thus, although at least one representative of each Type
(except Type VI) has been shown to produce the conserved ferrichrome siderophore compound consisting of
six substrates (three amino acids and three AHO units)

(Fig. 1), the domain architectures of the ferrichrome synthetases responsible for their biosynthesis vary considerably.
Two distinct lineages of ferrichrome synthetases
Both methods of phylogenetic analysis of A domains from
the complete dataset showed a history of domain duplications that supports the hypothesis of at least two separate
lineages of fungal ferrichrome synthetases (Fig. 3, see
Additional files 3 and 6). For all A domains, we find two
clades whose members correspond to homologs of C. heterostrophus NPS2 or to A. nidulans SidC. For convenience,
we call the lineage represented by C. heterostrophus and F.
graminearum NPS2 (Types V and IV, respectively, Fig. 2),
the NPS2 lineage. The other lineage, represented by A. nidulans SidC, U. maydis fer3, F. graminearum NPS1, U. maydis
sid2 and C. cinerea CC1G04120 (Types I, II and VI, Fig. 2),
we call the NPS1/SidC lineage. Some species, e.g., F.
graminearum, B. cinerea, C. globosum, S. sclerotiorum have
representatives in both lineages. Others, such has U. maydis and B. cinerea, have more than one representative
within the NPS1/SidC lineage.

Six modular architectures for ferrichrome synthetase NRPSs
Six modular architectures for ferrichrome synthetase NRPSs. Types III, IV, and V are in the NPS2 lineage
while Types I, II, and VI are in the NPS1/SidC lineage. A: adenylation domain, T; thiolation domain, C; condensation
domain. dA; degenerate A domain. Bars above boxes indicate
complete modules. Circles indicate incomplete modules and/
or a T-C unit. Superscript 'a' indicates partial gene.

The reconciliation analysis clearly identified duplication
nodes giving rise to the first (N-terminal, node 1, red
boxes) and final (third or fourth) (C-terminal, node 2,
green boxes) A domains of both lineages (Fig. 3). This
analysis also provides support for a relationship at node 3
between the third A domain of NPS2 Type V of the
Dothideomycetes (D.3) and the second A domains of
NPS1/SidC Type II (Fig. 3, yellow boxes).
ML and Bayesian phylogenetic methods support the
duplication at node 1, giving rise to the N-terminal A
domains of both lineages (red boxes), with high Bayesian
posterior probability (pp = 1.00) but low ML bootstrap
support (bs < 50%) (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6).
The duplication at node 2, giving rise to the C-terminal A
domains of members of both lineages (Fig. 3, green
boxes), is weakly supported by both types of phylogenetic
analysis (bs < 50%), pp = .74) (Fig. 3, see Additional files
3 and 6). For the internal modules, both ML and Bayesian
analyses group the third
A domain (D.3) of NPS2 Type V and the second A domain
of the NPS1/SidC lineage together (yellow boxes), supporting a duplication at node 3 inferred by the reconcilia-

The phylogenetic relationships of A domains are mapped
by color to representative ferrichrome synthetases in Fig.
4 (color corresponds to clades identified in Fig. 3). These
data clearly show that the N-terminal and C-terminal A
domains of each lineage are related by duplication (Fig.
4). Similarly, the third A domain of the Dothideomycete
Type V (D.3) proteins appears related to the second A
domain of the NPS1/SidC lineage by duplication (yellow). The second module of Dothideomycete Type V,
which is the only type of ferrichrome synthetase consisting of four complete A-T-C modules (Fig. 2), does not
have an obvious counterpart in other ferrichrome synthetases (Fig. 4, pink).
Additional duplications within the NPS1/SidC lineage
There is evidence for further duplications within the
NPS1/SidC lineage. The reconciliation analysis identified
duplication nodes at 6, 7, and 8 (Fig. 3) due to the presence of two representatives from the NPS1/SidC lineage in
both U. maydis [UM01434/fer3 (Type II) and sid2 (Type
I)] and B. cinerea [BC1G10928 and BC1G15494 (Type II)]
(Fig. 2). Duplication nodes were also identified due to the
incongruence of F. graminearum FG11026 (NPS1) and C.
cinerea CHGG02251 with the species phylogeny at nodes
9, 10, and 11 where these two NRPSs group with or outside of basidiomycete U. maydis fer3 rather than with
other ascomycete NRPSs (Fig. 3). Thus, the data provide
support for one and possibly two additional bifurcations
within the NPS1/SidC lineage.

The placement of certain NPS1/SidC lineage genes is
ambiguous. Type VI C. cinerea CC1G04210 has a single A
domain which groups consistently with the third A
domain of U. maydis sid2 (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and
6). The other basidiomycete gene, O. olearius fso1, tends
to group with other Type II NPS1/SidC proteins. In both
analyses, the first and second modules of fso1 group at the
base of the clades containing the corresponding modules
of the NPS1/SidC Type II proteins, usually with U. maydis
fer3 (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6). The third fso1 A
domain is highly diverged and contains degenerate core

Maximum (see previous page) all AMP domains examined in this study demonstrating two separate lineages of ferrichrome synMaximum likelihood tree of all AMP domains examined in this study demonstrating two separate lineages of
ferrichrome synthase NRPSs. N-terminal A domains of both lineages group together and C-terminal domains of both lineages group together (thick vertical bars). NPS2, module 2 groups with the C-terminal modules, while NPS1/SidC module 2 and
Dothideomycete NPS2 module D.3 group with the N-terminal modules. Numbered nodes indicate duplications inferred from
the reconciliation analysis. White circles indicate a duplication inferred due to incongruence of the gene tree with the species
tree (see Additional files 2 and 6), while red circles indicate a duplication inferred due to the presence of two copies of a gene
in the same species. Bootstrap support values greater than 50% are reported above branches. Note that the A domains of SidE
module 1 group as directly sister to all ferrichrome synthetase A domains examined here, while A domains of SidE module 2
group with A domains of other types of C. heterostrophus NRPSs. For species and protein Accession numbers see Additional file
1. Nomenclature: e.g., Ch_ NPS2_AAX09984_AMP3_4 indicates C. heterostrophus, protein accession number AAX09984, AMP
module 3 of a total of 4 (see Fig. 2). For Bayesian analysis, see Additional files 3 and 6.

motifs and its placement varies (Fig 3, see Additional files
3 and 6). The single A-domain of incomplete B. cinerea
BC1G15494 tends to group at the base of the clade containing the first A domain of all Type II NPS1/SidC proteins (Fig. 3, see Additional file 3 and 6), however, in both
ML and Bayesian analyses (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3
and 6), it shows incongruence with the species phylogeny
by grouping outside of basidiomycete NRPSs in this clade.
S. pombe sib1
The relationship of Type III S. pombe sib1 to other ferrichrome synthetases is ambiguous. In both the ML and
Bayesian analyses, the first A domain of sib1 groups as sister to the first A domains of both the NPS2 and NPS1/
SidC lineages (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6) with
fairly high support (bs = 96% and .89 pp), suggesting an
ancestral relationship of this sib1 A domain and the first
A domains of both lineages. However, the sib1 module 3
A domain groups with the A domains of NPS2 terminal
modules 3 or 4, in both trees (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3
and 6), with strong support (bs = 100% and pp = 1.00).
The sib1 module 2 A domain groups with the module 3 A
domain of the NPS2 lineage (Type V) with high support
in the Bayesian analysis (pp = 1.00) (see Additional files 3
and 6). In the ML tree, however, it groups with the N-terminal A domain of the NPS1/SidC lineage (Fig. 3), but
without bootstrap support. As discussed above, this second A domain is highly diverged, lacks several core A
domain motifs [9], and as suggested by Schwecke [6], is
likely nonfunctional. As sib1 most consistently groups
with homologs of C. heterostrophus NPS2, we placed it in
the NPS2 lineage (Fig. 2).
Putative ferrichrome synthetases in the sidE clade
The SidE proteins, identified as putative ferrichrome synthetases [23], group as sister to all other known ferrichrome synthetases (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6).
The A domains of the first and second modules of these
proteins however, are not monophyletic. In the ML and
Bayesian analyses, SidE module one A domain groups as
sister to known ferrichrome synthetases while the SidE

module two A domain groups with other (non-ferrichrome synthetase) NRPSs from C. heterostrophus. Thus,
these results suggest that only the first module of the SidE
proteins is clearly related to other known ferrichrome
siderophore NRPSs.
Individual lineage analysis
The backbones of the A and C tree topologies for each lineage, rooted with the first module of the SidE clade, are
shown in Figs. 5A and 5B. Within each lineage, all A and
all C domains fall into well-supported monophyletic
clades (see Additional files 4AâD and 6). A domain relationships are consistent with those of the full A dataset
(compare Additional file 4A with Fig. 3). The first through
the sixth C domain of all proteins group together as separate clades for all members of the NPS2 (except S. pombe
sib1) and the NPS1/SidC lineages (Fig. 5, see Additional
files 4B, 4D and 6). C domain relationships among representative ferrichrome synthetases are shown in Fig. 4
(arrows).

For the NPS2 lineage (Fig. 5A), both A domain tree topologies (ML and Bayesian) support a close relationship
between module one A domains of all types (I, IV, V) and
the A domain of Dothideomycete Type V module 3 (D.3)
(bs = 56% and pp = .99) (Fig. 5A, see Additional files 4Aiâ
ii and 6). A close relationship is also supported between
module 2 A domains of Types IV and V and the terminal
module A domains of all types (bs = 62%, and pp = .96)
(Fig. 5A, see Additional files 4Aiâii and 6). The ML and
Bayesian analysis of the C domains (Fig. 5A, see Additional file 4Biâii and 6) support a close relationship
between modules 4 and 6 C domains and between module 3 and 5 C domains (bs = 89% and pp = 0.76, bs = 68%
and pp = 1.00, respectively).
The unrooted ML phylogenies of the A and C domains of
C. heterostrophus NPS2 are shown in Figs. 6 Ai and Aii.
When the C tree is rooted at position b (Fig. 6Aii) and
evaluated with the PDH algorithm [35], the resulting phylogeny is a duplication tree that implies an associated par-

among A representation of phylogenetic relationships
Schematicand among C domains within each lineage
Schematic representation of phylogenetic relationships among A and among C domains within each lineage. A domain relationships for each lineage and between
lineages are color coded as in Fig. 3 and Additional files 3 and
6. C domain relationships are indicated by arrows for each
lineage. The NPS2 lineage relationships are indicated in the
top half of figure and the NPS1/SidC lineage relationships in
the bottom half of figure. Scheme is based on phylogenetic
analyses of A (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3, 4 and 6and C
domains. Spsib1, ChNPS2, FgNPS2, FgNPS1, AnSidC,
Umfer3, and Umsid2 are representative of architectural
Types I-V (Fig. 2). Also mapped on the A domains are predicted substrates adenylated by each domain, based on structural modeling (Table 2, Fig. 7). SER = serine, GLY = glycine,
ALA = alanine, AHO = N5-acyl-N5-hydroxy-L-ornithine.
Within the NPS2 lineage, ChNPS2 and FgNPS2 C domain
analyses clearly indicate that C2 domains are related, as are
C3 domains. Thus the difference in protein architecture in
this region is presence/absence of an A domain between C2
and C3. A similar argument can be made for the difference in
protein structure between C1 and C2 C domains of Spsib1 vs
those of ChNPS2 and FgNPS2. For the NPS1/SidC lineage, A
and C domain analyses of FgNPS1, AnSidC, and Umfer3
clearly indicate that there is a one to one relationship for all
A and all C domains. Examination of Umsid2, however, indicates that Umsid2 module 1 A domain is related to the module 2 A domains of the other members of this group, while
Umsid2 modules 2 and 3 A domains are related to the C-terminal module of the other members of this group. Umsid2
appears to lack the N-terminal A domain of other NPS1/SidC
members, since the C domain from module 1 is related to
the C domains of module 2 of the rest of the lineage. Similarly the C domains from Umsid2 module 2, 3, 4 are related
to the C domains of modules 3, 4, 5 of the rest of the NPS1/
SidC lineage.

the NPS2 lineage. As demonstrated in the full A domain dataset analyses (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6), both NPS2
lineage A analyses support a relationship between C-terminal
modules 3 or 4 and module 2, and a relationship between Nterminal module 1 and Dothideomycete module D.3. For the
C trees, both analyses support a relationship between C4,
and C6 (bs = 89% and pp = .76) and between C3 and C5 (bs
= 68% and pp = 1.00). C2 groups with C4 and 6 in the ML
analysis and with C3-6 in the Bayesian analysis but without
support in either case. In both trees, C1 is ancestral, but
without support. B. Relationships among A and among C
domains in the NPS1/SidC lineage. As demonstrated in the
full A domain analyses (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6),
both NPS1/SidC lineage A domain analyses support a relationship between N-terminal module 1 and module 2, and
indicate C-terminal module 3 is ancestral. Similarly, the ML

tially ordered duplication history (Fig. 6Aii). All trees with
four taxa are true duplication trees, thus evaluation of the
A domains with the PDH algorithm is trivial. However,
the duplication tree resulting from rooting the A domain
phylogeny at b implies a partially ordered duplication history which also infers a duplication between modules 1
and 3 and between modules 2 and 4, consistent with
duplications predicted for C domains (Figs. 6Ai, ii).
For the NPS1/SidC lineage, the A domain phylogenies
show a strong relationship between A domains of modules 1 and 2 (bs = 76% and pp = 1.0) (Fig. 5B, see Additional files 4Ciâii and 6). Both the ML and Bayesian trees
for the C domains also support a strong relationship
between modules 1 and 2 (Fig. 5B, see Additional files
4Diâii and 6). The ML tree also groups C domains 1, 2
and 4 together and C domains 3 and 5 together, although
there is poor bootstrap support for these relationships.
The Bayesian tree was unresolved with respect to the
remaining C domains. The relationships of A domains in
the phylogeny of the complete dataset (Fig. 3, see Additional files 3 and 6) suggest that the second A domain of

Evaluation of C. heterostrophus NPS2 and A. nidulans SidC with the PDH algorithm (possible duplication history). A. i) Unrooted maximum likelihood phylogeny of C. heterostrophus NPS2 A domains, the duplication tree resulting from
rooting the phylogeny at position b (top) and inferred partially ordered duplication history (below). ii) Unrooted maximum
likelihood phylogeny of C. heterostrophus NPS2 C domains, the duplication tree resulting from rooting the phylogeny at position
c, and partially ordered duplication history (bottom). iii) and iv) Representation of the series of three tandem duplication
events suggested by the partially ordered duplication trees of C domains. Bold and thin lines indicate relationships among modules 1, 3, and 5 and among modules 2, 4 and 6 respectively. If one infers loss of AMP5 and AMP6, relationships among A
domains are consistent with the series of three tandem duplication events inferred from the C domain partially ordered duplication history: Step 1) duplication of A module 1, Step 2) duplication of A modules 1 and 2, and Step 3) duplication of A modules 3 and 4. v) Relationships among A and among C domains in partially ordered duplication histories mapped to the domain
architecture with predicted domain losses shown in red. B. i) Unrooted maximum likelihood phylogeny of A. nidulans SidC A

consistent with the series of tandem duplication events predicted by relationships among the C. heterostrophus NPS2 C domains
if losses of AMP2, AMP5, and AMP6 are invoked (iii). Relationships among SidC C domains are also consistent with a series of
three tandem duplication events if loss of CON2 is invoked (iv). v) Relationships from partially ordered duplication histories
mapped to the domain architecture with predicted domain losses shown in red.

the NPS1/SidC lineage corresponds to the third A domain
(D.3) of the NPS2 lineage (Figs. 2, 3 and 5). Thus, the
NPS1/SidC lineage analyses also support a relationship
between A domains corresponding to the first and third
modules of the NPS2 lineage.
The unrooted ML phylogenies of A and C domains from
A. nidulans SidC are shown in Fig. 6Bi, Bii. When the tree
of SidC C domains is rooted at position c (Fig. 6Bii), and
evaluated with the PDH algorithm [35], the resulting tree
is a duplication tree which implies the partially ordered
duplication history shown in Fig. 6Bii. Similarly, the SidC
A domains are duplication trees with an associated partially ordered duplication history (Fig. 6Bi) that is also
consistent with the duplication history predicted for SidC
domains.
Adenylation domain substrate choice
Structural modeling
The experimental structure of Gramicidin GrsA [25]
bound to its substrate, phenylalanine (1AMU_A), identified a number of residues that may be relevant for substrate specificity. In the GrsA structure, the binding pocket
is formed by residues at the interface between five Î²strands (strand 1; D224 to F229, strand 2; T275 to P280,
strand 3; Q296 to A301, strand 4; V317 to Y323 and
strand 5; A332 to V336) of a Î²-sheet, two Î±-helices (helix
1; D203 to S217 and helix 2; D235 to L245) and at some
of the loop regions connecting these secondary structure
elements (Figs. 7AâC). In addition, a loop (S514 to K517)
protruding from a small domain of the protein covers the
entrance to the active site region (Figs. 7BâC). A number
of sites with the potential to be in direct contact with the

substrate, as well as those lining the cavity in such a way
that the side chain could affect the size of the binding
pocket, were investigated in this work for a possible role
in substrate specificity (Table 2). These key residue positions are 229, 230, 240, 243, 280, 320, and 326, plus
those in the 10AA 'code' (235, 236, 239, 278, 299, 301,
322, 330, 331, and 517)(Fig. 7C, Table 2). Position 229
was reported previously as part of the 13AA code predicted for the substrate AHO [6], but the additional residues we examined that are not in the 10AA code have not
been implicated previously in substrate binding.
Two sites of key importance for binding amino acid substrates correspond to D235 and K517. In the GrsA structure, the carboxyl group of D235 interacts electrostatically
with the amino group of the substrate residue (phenylanalnine), providing one of the anchoring points for the
substrate in the binding cavity, while K517 protrudes
from a small domain (involving residues D430 to F530)
that sits close to both the substrate as well as to the AMP
binding pocket (Fig. 7B) [25,9]. Positively charged K517
appears to act as a gatekeeper, lying at the entrance of the
active site cavity and projecting its NH3 group toward the
carboxyl group of the phenylalanine substrate [9,25].
D235 and K517 are conserved across all A domains we
examined and thus, though clearly important for substrate binding, should not be considered as residues
involved in distinguishing among amino acid substrates
(Table 2).
AHO and amino acid substrate assignments for A
domains are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 4. A domains of all
terminal modules were predicted to code for AHO based

3D modeling of selected NRPS AMP binding domains. A. Ribbon representation of the structure of the activated
domain of Gramicidin synthetase (PDB code: 1AMU) bound to its Phe substrate (shown as a CPK model; red) and adenosine
monophosphate (AMP; shown as "ball & stick" representation of the heavy atoms; light-blue). The large domain (gray ribbon),
contains the substrate and AMP binding pockets. A second smaller domain (orange), involving residues D430 to F530, sits at
the entrance of these pockets. "Ball & stick" representations of residues D235 and K517 are shown in green and blue, respectively. B. View of the GrsA binding pockets for Phe and AMP showing the positions of the conserved residues F234 (yellow),
D235 (green), and K517 (blue). D235 and K517 are in contact with the amino and carboxyl end groups, respectively, of the Phe
substrate. C. Alternative view of GrsA highlighting all the fragments of the sequence that determine the binding pockets for
Phe and AMP. The amino acid composition of those fragments is listed to the right. The color convention for the residues is as
follows: red and orange indicate those residues lining the substrate cavity, with residues in red making contact with the substrate Phe in the experimental structure; blue and light blue indicate residues lining the AMP binding site, with residues in blue
making contact with AMP in the experimental structure. D. Slice through the substrate binding site of a 3D model of ChNPS2
module 3. The central cavity is packed with large residues that produce a shallow pocket. A ball & stick representation of a
bound GLY residue is also shown to help assess the size of the cavity (compare to Fig. 7E). E. Slice through the substrate binding site of a 3D model of ChNPS2 module 4. The central cavity is lined with small residues that leading to a deep pocket. A ball
& stick representation of a bound AHO is also shown to help assess the size of the cavity (compare to Fig. 7D).

on a larger binding pocket size which, in most cases,
includes one or two negatively charged residues or a few
polar residues (Table 2, Fig. 7E, compare with Fig. 7D).
Besides these features, there is no clear pattern based on
the residues lining this cavity, except for high similarity
among Spsib1, ChNPS2 and FgNPS2 terminal A domain
residues (Table 2).
Assignment of the remaining A domains was even more
difficult. We found that the consensus 10AA codes for
SER, ALA, and ORN identified by Stachelhaus et. al. [9]
were not represented in the A domains of ferrichrome synthetases we examined and thus we could not simply infer
specificity. Initially, to search for patterns representative of
A domains binding SER, ALA, GLY, and ORN, structural
alignments of A domains predicted [47,9] to bind these
substrates were created (see Additional file 5). The small
number of fungal and bacterial domains confirmed to be
associated with known substrates makes comparing key
fungal positions to the bacterial code positions problematic. We found, however, that bacterial A domain 10AA
'codes' for the same substrate appeared more conserved
than fungal ones. The fungal A domains were either too
variable or too few for us to deduce a consensus 'code' (see
Additional file 5). We did not find any consistent pattern
associated with A domains coding for ALA, GLY, or ORN.
For SER, however, we found that the majority of
sequences share a histidine (HIS) residue at position 278
that our 3D-models suggest is projecting from the top of
the binding pocket (Table 2). A domains from FgNPS1,
AnsidC, and Umfer3 module 2, have HIS at 278, and their
cavities are quite hydrophilic and lined by similar sets of
residues (Table 2). We initially considered these modules
as the domains most likely to bind SER. We also found
that A domains from Spsib1, ChNPS2, and FgNPS2 module 1 share highly similar binding pockets (Table 2), with

a HIS at position 331 whose side chain may occupy the
center of the cavity (i.e., similar to H278 in our structural
alignment) but projecting from the bottom of the pocket),
making them, by analogy, also probable candidates to
bind SER. The chemistry, however, indicates that Spsib1
produces ferrichrome which contains three glycines and
no serine (Fig. 4). Therefore, we infer that the A domain
of the Spsib1 module 1 must bind GLY, since it is the only
non degenerate A domain, other than the terminal A
domain which we predict binds AHO (Figs. 1, 4). Due to
the high similarity of the residues forming the AMP cavity
of ChNPS2 and FgNPS2 module 1 to those in Spsib1
module 1 (Table 2), we predict these two domains are also
likely to bind GLY. By default, module 2 of FgNPS2 is predicted to bind SER (Fig. 4). Based on similarities to the
FgNPS2 module 2 binding pocket, ChNPS2 module 2 is
predicted to bind SER also (Table 2). Finally, ChNPS2
module 3, which 3D models show has a very crowded and
small binding pocket is expected to bind to GLY (Table 2,
Fig. 4, Fig. 7D).
AnSidC has been shown to produce ferricrocin [17,48],
which contains two glycines and one serine, while
FgNPS1 produces malonichrome containing two glycines
anda single alanine (G. Adam, BG Turgeon, unpublished)
and Umfer3 makes ferrichrome composed of three glycines [7]. As noted in Table 2, key residues in the binding
pockets of the second A domains of FgNPS1, AnSidC, and
Umfer3 are highly similar to each other and should likely
code for a residue that is common between ferricrocin and
malonichrome (i.e., GLY). By default, we infer that module 1 of AnSidC and Umfer3 bind SER (Table 2) while
module 1 of FgNPS1 binds ALA. 3D modeling shows that
the center of these binding pockets are likely filled by
many hydrophobic residues. In the case of module 1 of
AnSidC and Umfer3, the characteristics of the binding

b Positions in bold correspond to the proposed 10 AA code. Position 229, in bold italics, corresponds to one of three additional positions (226,
229, 276) predicted by Schwecke et al. [6] to bind AHO. All other sites were identified in this study. Residues D and K at positions 235 and 517 in
bold indicate residue conservation. Letters in body of table refer to amino acid residues.

pockets (i.e., highly hydrophobic) do not seem very compatible with binding a hydrophilic residue such as SER.
However, an asparagine residue at position 331 in both
modules may be able to provide a hydrogen-bond partner
to "dock" the side chain of the SER substrate. Lastly, 3D
models of Umsid2 module 1, indicate that the binding
region must be filled with many hydrophobic residues
(Table 2) leading to a very shallow pocket, likely to be
selective for GLY.
Thus, we found that the 10AA code failed when we tried
to infer the specificity of the sequences we examined.
Instead, A domains predicted to code for the same substrate [e.g., ChNPS2 AMP1 (GLY) and AnSidC AMP2

(GLY)] had widely divergent 'codes' (Table 2, see Additional file 5) and appeared to diverge according to our A
domain phylogeny (e.g., 'codes' for GLY, SER, or ORN are
conserved among members of the NPS2 and SidC lineages
but differ between the two lineages) (Table 2, Fig. 3, see
Additional files 3 and 6). It is noteworthy that, even when
protein structural modeling is brought to bear on the issue
of key residues 'coding' for substrate specificity, no simple
rule was found to be applicable to all sequences considered in this study. While it was possible to infer the size
and some properties that characterize the binding pockets, highly divergent residue arrangements appear to bind
the same substrate (Table 2, see Additional file 5).

Evolutionary approaches to identification of specificity residues
The SDP, Type I and Type II functional divergence analyses identified, with high probability, a number of positions indicating either a shift in amino acid properties
between clusters (SDP and Type II) or a shift in evolutionary rate between clusters reflective of changes in evolutionary constraint or selective pressure (Type I) (Table 3).
For Type I analyses, all comparisons of paralagous clusters
showed Î¸I values significant at p â¤ .05 while for Type II
analyses, only comparisons between NPS2 AMP1 and
NPS2 AMP 4 (Î¸II = .224 Â± .113) and between NPS2 AMP2
and NPS2 AMP4 (Î¸II = .283 Â± .113) were significant at p â¤
.05. Several positions received high support from all three
methods including positions 252, 278, 301, 322, and
331. Several of the positions identified by structural modeling (230, 239, 243, 278, 299, 301, 320, 322, 326, 330,
and 331) also received support from at least one method
(Table 2, Table 3). Clusters of significant residues map to
the first and second Î±-helices and to Î²-strands 2â4, as well
as to fragments 1â4 identified by structural modeling as
lining the 1AMU_A binding pocket and connecting these
key structural features (Table 3; Fig. 7C). Two exceptions
to this pattern map to region 246â257 which is on Î²strand near the surface of the protein (therefore not
located close to the substrate binding site) and region
306â314, which is on a small helix on the surface of the
first monomer of 1AMU_A containing both the substrate
and AMP-binding pockets. Thus, residues predicted to be
involved in functional divergence point to many of the
same key regions of the binding pocket predicted by structural modeling to have a potential role in substrate specificity.

Discussion
Distinct lineages of ferrichrome synthetases
Our phylogenetic analyses support the hypothesis that
fungal ferrichrome synthetases fall into two distinct lineages corresponding to homologs of C. heterostrophus NPS2
and A. nidulans SidC. Some fungi contain representatives
of both lineages while others lack a ferrichrome synthetase altogether. Significantly, ferrichrome NRPSs were
not detected in any yeast species sampled (except the fission yeast, S. pombe), or in the zygomycetes R. oryzae and
P. blakesleeanus, the ectomycorrhizal fungus L. bicolor or
the chytrid B. dendrobatitis. While absence of a gene must
be interpreted with caution, as genome sequences may be
incomplete, the lack of the NPS1/SidC lineage in all
Dothideomycetes (C. heterostrophus, A. brassicicola, S.
nodorum, and A. pullulans) and Onygenales (C. immitis, H.
capsulatum, and U. reesii), lack of the NPS2 lineage in
Eurotiales (Aspergillus sp.), as well as a lack of any ferrichrome synthetase in all hemiascomycete yeasts, zygomycetes, or chytrids surveyed is likely significant.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/328

The NPS1/SidC lineage predates the divergence of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes as its members are present in
both of these groups. In contrast, the duplication into the
two main NPS2 and NPS1/SidC lineages may have
occurred in the ancestor of ascomycetes as the former lineage is only found within ascomycetes. The additional
duplications within the NPS1/SidC lineage may have
occurred also prior to the divergence of ascomycetes and
basidiomycetes, as there are two distinct ferrichrome synthetase encoding genes from the NPS1/SidC lineage in
both the basidiomycete U. maydis (Umfer3 and Umsid2)
and the ascomycete B. cinerea (BC1G10928 and
BC1G15494). This scenario would postulate an unlikely
loss of one or the other of these genes in the majority of
species examined. The other possibility is independent
duplication of the NPS1/SidC type gene in certain species
e.g., U. maydis and B. cinerea. However, in both ML and
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, the ascomycete proteins
B. cinerea BC1G15494 and F. graminearum FG11026
grouped with, or outside of, basidiomycete proteins, suggesting an ancestral duplication of this lineage (Fig. 3, see
Additional files 3 and 6).
It is possible that the duplications within the NPS1/SidC
lineage may be associated with production of different ferrichromes. F. graminearum NPS1 (FG11026), has recently
been shown to produce malonichrome (two GLY, one
ALA) (G Adam, BG Turgeon, unpublished) while certain
other ascomycete members (e.g., A. nidulans SidC) of the
NPS1/SidC lineage produce ferricrocin (two GLY, one
SER). The two ferrichrome synthetases in U. maydis also
produce distinct products; Umfer3 produces ferrichrome
A (two SER, one GLY) and Umsid2 produces ferrichrome
(3 GLY).
Evolution of domain architecture
In some respects, the C domain alone or in combination
with the T domain can be considered the minimal evolutionary unit for NRPSs, as T-C units clearly occur in the
absence of A domains. T-C units may also be considered
the minimal functional units for NRPS synthesis as they
can be charged by nonadjacent A domains [4,49,6,17,48].
T-C units lacking an associated A domain could be created
either through independent duplication of T-C units or
through loss of an associated A domain from a complete
A-T-C module. If complete A-T-C module repeats arise by
tandem duplication, the C domain phylogenies may provide a more complete picture of the evolutionary history
of duplications at the locus. The relationships observed
between C domains of modules 3 and 5 and among modules 2, 4, and 6 of the NPS2 lineage (Fig. 5A) and the partially ordered duplication history predicted by C.
heterostrophus NPS2 C domains (Fig. 6Aii) imply a series of
tandem duplication events involving single or double
complete A-T-C units as a possible hypothesis for the evo-

lution of a hexamodular ferrichrome synthetase NRPS
(Fig. 6Aiv, Fig. 8). These events would occur as follows:
Step 1) duplication of module 1 to form a bimodular
gene, Step 2) duplication of the bimodular gene (modules
1 and 2) to form a tetramodular gene (modules 1â4), and
Step 3) duplication of modules 3 and 4 to form a hexamodular gene (modules 1â6) (Fig. 8A, 6A).
These interpretations are based on algorithms for which it
is assumed that there is no loss and no recombination, criteria that are clearly violated here for ferrichrome synthetases. We propose, however, that the C domains of C.
heterostrophus NPS2 likely represent the full evolutionary
history of ferrichrome synthetase modules. The chemical
structure of ferrichromes (3 AA and 3 AHO) provides support for the notion of an ancestral gene with six complete
modular units. Furthermore, our analyses (unpublished)
and others [4] show little evidence for recombination
within C domains. The tandem duplication hypothesis is
based on these assumptions and is presented as one pos-

sible explanation for the diverse domain architectures.
The phylogenetic relationships observed among A and C
domains in both lineages are consistent with this proposed tandem duplication history if one postulates the
loss of module 5 and 6 A domains from both lineages and
the additional loss of the complete module 2 (A-T-C)
from the SidC lineage (Figs. 6Aiiiâv and 6Biiiâv with
losses shown in red, Figs. 4A, B). If these duplications
occurred before the divergence of the majority of species
examined, as supported by the reconciliation analysis,
this scenario predicts that domains of modules 1, 3, and 5
(Fig. 8A, top, dotted lines, Figs. 6Av and 6Bv) will show
greater similarity to each other than to other modules, as
will modules 2, 4, and 6 (Fig. 8A, top, solid lines, Figs. 6Av
and 6Bv).
In general, these predictions are supported when the relationships of A or C domains from each lineage are examined. In particular, the relationships between modules 3
and 5 and between 4 and 6, which would have resulted

Models for gene and forageneration of domain architectures
Models for evolution of a hexamodular ancestral ferrichrome synthetase gene and for generation of
domain architectures of the extant types examined
in this study. A. Possible origin of a hexamodular ancestral
ferrichrome synthetase gene. We propose that a hexamodular gene arose by a series of duplication events. Step one:
module 1 duplicates, forming module 1 and new module 2.
Step two: modules 1 and 2 duplicate together, forming modules 1 and 2, and new modules 3 and 4. Step three: modules
3 and 4 duplicate together, forming modules 3 and 4, and
new modules 5 and 6. This scenario predicts that modules 1,
3, and 5 (dotted lines) will show greater similarity to each
other than to other modules. Similarly, modules 2, 4, and 6
(solid lines) will show greater similarity to each other than to
modules 1, 3 and 5. B. Possible scenarios generating members of the NPS2 and NPS1/SidC lineages from a hexamodular ancestral gene. Trees to the right show relationships of
extant AMP domains, based on Fig. 3. Numbers in parentheses indicate corresponding domain of hypothetical ancestral
gene. Left side of figure indicates proposed losses of A (black
boxes) or C (white boxes) domains, resulting in the extant
gene.

from the final duplication are more strongly supported
(Figs. 4A, B, see Additional files 4AâD and 6). The results
are not consistent with recent independent duplication of
T-C units giving rise to the final T-C repeat in most ferrichrome synthetases (Fig. 2) as this latter mechanism
would predict a closer relationship among C domains of
modules 4, 5, and 6 which is not supported by C trees
from either lineage. Instead, our analyses support the
hypothesis of a hexamodular ancestor with six complete
A-T-C modules, proposed previously by Schwecke [6], fol-

lowed by loss of either complete A-T-C modules or individual A domains as the best hypothesis for the generation
of the diverse domain architectures of the six ferrichrome
synthetase domain structural types (Fig. 8). In the NPS2
lineage, for example, both C. heterostrophus (representative
of Type V) and F. graminearum (representative of Type IV)
have 6 C domains, although they have only 4 and 3 A
domains, respectively. Analyses of C domains of these
proteins clearly indicate that the second C domain of
Types V and IV are related (Fig. 4, see Additional files 4Aâ
D and 6). The same is true for the third C domains. The
difference in protein architecture in this region is presence/absence of an A domain between C2 and C3 (i.e., the
F. graminearum gene appears to be missing the third A
domain found in the C. heterostrophus protein). Similarly,
the second C domain in sib1 from S. pombe groups with
the second C domain in C. heterostrophus NPS2 but lacks
the corresponding A domain (Fig. 4), suggesting loss of
this domain in the S. pombe gene. Our data thus suggest
that differential loss of A domains in different members of
this lineage has resulted in the three distinct domain
architectures. A recent study of the microcystin synthase
gene cluster has shown recombination breakpoints within
NRPS A domains suggestive of recurrent A domain
replacement [4]. Our analyses suggest that homologous
recombination could also lead to complete loss of A
domains.
For the NPS1/SidC lineage, F. graminearum NPS1, A. nidulans SidC and U. maydis fer3 all have 5 C domains and 3
A domains. A and C domain analyses of this lineage
clearly indicate that there is a one to one relationship for
all A and all C domains (Fig. 4, see Additional files 4CâD
and 6). Examination of Umsid2, however, indicates that it
has 3 A domains, but only 4 C domains; the module 1 A
domain is related to module 2 A domains of the other
members of this group, while both module 2 and 3 A
domains are related to the C-terminal modules of other
proteins in this lineage. Similarly the C domains from
Umsid2 modules 2, 3, 4 are related to the C domains of
modules 3, 4, 5 of the rest of the NPS1/SidC lineage.
Umsid2 lacks the complete N-terminal A-T-C module of
other NPS1/SidC members and retains the A domain corresponding to the module 4 C domain that our scenario
postulates has been lost in other members of this lineage.
These data thus support the hypothesis [6] that the extant
genes may have evolved from a hexamodular (A-T-C)
ancestor and that repeated and independent losses of A
domains or complete A-T-C modules may have given rise
to the diverse domain architecture types observed in
extant species.

Domain architecture and mechanism of biosynthesis
How do ferrichrome synthetases differing in domain
architecture, biosynthesize nearly identical chemical
products? Several authors have suggested that T-C repeats
can be used iteratively [17,48,49]. For example, Schwecke
et al [6] have proposed a mechanism by which the functions of the missing S. pombe sib1 A domain (which
should accompany the second T-C) and the degenerate
second A domain (Fig. 2) are assumed by the first A
domain, which charges both the second and third C
domains in cis, thus attaching the three glycines required
for the ferrichrome product. Similarly, some of the NPS2
lineage Type IV synthetases are predicted to make ferricrocin which contains two glycines and one serine. We speculate that the first A domain of this protein is used
iteratively to attach two glycines by charging the T-C
repeat after the second complete module. U. maydis sid2
has only a single A domain predicted to code for glycine
yet ferrichrome contains three glycines. Therefore, the first
A domain must also be used iteratively. Similarly, the last
A domain of Types II-V may also charge the final two T-C
units at the C terminal ends of these proteins to assemble
the three AHO groups that form the core iron binding
group, common to all ferrichrome synthetases [6]. Interestingly, the U. maydis sid2 protein, which has only a single terminal T-C, contains two complete A-T-C modules
predicted to charge AHO. This protein thus must utilize
an alternate mechanism to produce the three required
AHO units and perhaps represents an intermediate step
between a hexamodular ancestral gene with three complete A-T-C modules coding for AHO and a completely
iterative system with a single A-T-C module coding for
AHO followed by a T-C repeat that is used iteratively.
Thus, loss of A domains in these NRPSs is compensated,
likely, by iterative charging of T-C units.

Type VI C. cinerea CC1G04120 is unusual in that it has
only a single A domain and a T-C repeat. It is possible that
this gene is incomplete due to assembly errors, or may
function together with another NRPS to form the complete ferrichrome product. Alternatively, it may produce a
product such as desdiserylglycerylferrirhodin (DDF)
which consists of three AHO residues only.
The mechanisms controlling iterative use of NRPS
domains are, to our knowledge, unknown. Here we
observe that proteins with distinct domain architectures
produce nearly identical chemical products. Iterative synthesis provides yet another flexible mechanism for NRPS
biosynthesis.
Substrate specificity
Structural modeling results suggest that general features of
the binding pocket such as size, hydrophobicity, and
charge may be more important in determining substrate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/328

recognition than residues at fixed positions within the
cavity. In homology based modeling of substrate specificity, small errors in the alignment between the experimental and the model sequence can lead to significant errors
in the modeled structure. For this reason, we used an
alignment of several experimental structures to optimize
our alignments. We found that the A domains included in
this study were remarkably conserved structurally and we
were able to identify several conserved residue-patterns
and structural features which aligned well in all the structures and served as markers to anchor our alignment of
the experimental sequences, particularly near the residues
that are supposed to form the wall of the binding site (the
code). With careful attention to the alignment, we found
that residues associated with the 10 or 13 AA 'codes' predicted to be important in substrate choice vary considerably and do not show a consistent pattern for A domains
predicted to code the same substrate (Table 2, see Additional file 5). Thus, we found that the string of amino
acids at the proposed 'code' positions was unable to predict substrates for any fungal A domain examined in this
study. The 10AA code was originally deduced by extracting residues at positions predicted to interact with the Phe
substrate in the 1_AMU_A domain from a multiple
sequence alignment and is based on the assumption that,
because A domains of NRPSs and other adenylating
enzymes show high structural similarity, the positions in
the 1_AMU_A structure should be important for other
substrates [9]. Recent studies, however, have shown that
additional residues may be important for interacting with
other substrates such as AHO [5,6].
Our results from structural modeling and evolutionary
analyses of functional residues point to key fragments
within the binding pocket which surround and connect
the Î±-helix and Î²-strand structural elements of the pocket,
as general regions important for specificity. Our analyses
also identified residue positions in addition to the 10 AA
code positions within these fragments (229, 230, 240,
243, 280, 320, 322, and 326) which line the substrate
pocket and are either positioned such that their side
chains may interact with a substrate or are involved in
shaping the size of the binding pocket (Table 2). Our
study confirms [9] that D and K residues at positions 235
and 517 respectively (Table 2), adjacent to the N-terminal
amino and C-terminal carboxyl groups, are conserved
across all the sequences examined, and that they serve the
general function of holding the amino and carboxyl
groups of an amino acid substrate in the binding pocket
and are not involved in recognition of a specific amino
acid substrate.
We speculate that the residue positions showing a significant signal for functional divergence which fall outside of
the binding pocket region on the surface of the protein

Page 21 of 24

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:328

(246â257 and 305â314) could have a role in either protein-protein interactions or interactions between the two
subunits of the NRPS protein. One subunit contains both
the substrate and AMP binding pockets while the other
subunit covers the opening to the binding sites (Fig. 7A).
In the crystal structure of the related adenylating enzyme,
acetyl CoA synthetase (1PG3_A), this second subunit may
adopt two configurations in order to accomplish the two
half-reactions of this enzyme: 1) adenylation of the substrate and 2) subsequent transfer to coenzyme A. Each
configuration exposes a different set of residues to the
active site [50,51]. A similar mechanism may operate in
NRPSs. Residues 305â314 on the surface of the first subunit are not in a position to interact directly with the binding pocket, but could be involved in mediating
interactions between the two subunits.
Thus, our results suggest that a rigid 'code' of specific
amino acids at particular residue positions may not be the
most reliable approach to predicting specificity of fungal
NRPS A domains. Instead, the general chemical, physical,
and structural features of the binding pocket may be more
important. We conclude that methods of substrate prediction which evaluate chemical features of amino acids
within these key regions may be better able to predict substrate specificity. Our findings await manipulation of key
residues predicted to affect the chemical properties of the
binding pocket, followed by examination of how this
affects substrate choice.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate two distinct lineages of ferrichrome synthetases in fungi and suggest that these genes
are restricted to fission yeast, filamentous ascomycetes,
and basidiomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses of domain
architectures supports the hypothesis that the distinct
domain architectures observed derive from a hexamodular ancestral gene through loss of individual A domains or
complete A-T-C modules and support a series of tandem
duplication events of single or double A-T-C modules as
the mechanism generating this hexamodular ancestor.
Analyses of substrate specificity show that the proposed
10AA code was unable to infer substrate specificity for
these fungal A domains. Structural modeling and evolutionary analyses of functional residues suggest that additional positions may play a role in substrate specificity.
Our results confirm that two positions of the code which
are conserved across all sequences examined, D235 and
K517, likely do not play a role in amino acid substrate
choice but instead serve the important function of anchoring the substrate in the binding pocket through interaction with the amino and carboxyl groups respectively.
