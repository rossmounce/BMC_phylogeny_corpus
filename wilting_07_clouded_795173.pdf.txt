Abstract
Background: The clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is one of the least known cat species and
depletion of their forested habitats puts it under heavy pressure. Recently reclassification of
Bornean clouded leopards (N. nebulosa diardi) to species level (N.diardi) was suggested based on
molecular and morphological evidence. Since the genetic results were based solely on three
Bornean samples we re-evaluated this partition using additional samples of Bornean clouded
leopards (N = 7) and we were also able to include specimens from Sumatra (N = 3), which were
lacking in previous analysis.
Results: We found strong support for the distinction between N. nebulosa and N. diardi based on
three fragments of mtDNA (900 bp) and 18 microsatellites. Forty-one fixed mitochondrial
nucleotide differences and non-overlapping allele sizes in 8 of 18 microsatellite loci distinguished N.
nebulosa and N. diardi. This is equivalent to the genetic divergence among recognized species in the
genus Panthera. Sumatran clouded leopards clustered with specimens from Borneo, suggesting that
Sumatran individuals also belong to N. diardi. Additionally, a significant population subdivision was
apparent among N. diardi from Sumatra and Borneo based on mtDNA and microsatellite data.
Conclusion: Referring to their origin on two Sunda Islands we propose to give N. diardi the
common name "Sundaland clouded leopard". The reduced gene flow between Borneo and Sumatra
might suggest the recognition of two subspecies of N. diardi. Based on this reclassification of
clouded leopards not only species, but also the populations on Borneo and Sumatra should be
managed separately and a higher priority should be placed to protect the different populations from
extinction.

Background
Clouded leopards have drawn less attention in the past
compared to other species of the Panthera lineage. This

medium-sized cat (11–25 kg) primarily inhabits densely
vegetated habitats and remote areas in South-East Asian
subtropical and tropical forests [1,2]. As a consequence of

their secretive behaviour [3,4] very little is known about
their behaviour and status in the wild and very few studies
have focused on this species [5-7]. Likewise, their taxonomy and phylogenetic status remained obscure for a long
time [8-11]. Phylogenetic studies consistently reveal that
clouded leopards separated from the Panthera lineage
approximately 6 million years ago (MYA) [12-14]. Only
recently the phylogenetic relationships among clouded
leopards were assessed [15]. Based on mtDNA, nuclear
DNA sequences, microsatellites, fixed chromosomal differences and morphological variation, the reclassification
of Bornean clouded leopards (N. nebulosa diardi) to species level N. diardi was suggested [15,16]. The small sample size of only three Bornean samples in the phylogenetic
study reduces confidence in this reclassification of N.
diardi. Therefore, we present here the phylogenetic analysis with additional individuals from Borneo. Furthermore,
we examine the phylogenetic relationships among
clouded leopards more closely by including Sumatran
samples. Sumatran individuals are necessary for the recognition of a new species on the Sunda Islands, but until
now have not been investigated genetically. The goal of
this study is to provide a better understanding of the systematic classification of one of the most threatened cat
species in Asia. This classification is of utmost importance
for conservation and management purposes [17].

Results
Mitochondrial DNA analysis
Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship among clouded
leopards based on a concatenated fragment of 900 bp of
mitochondrial DNA comprising sequences from three
mitochondrial gene segments (185 bp ATPase-8, 286 bp
Cyt b and 426 bp control region) revealed 54 variable sites
among clouded leopards. Of those 39 were fixed nucleotide differences between specimens from the islands of
Borneo/Sumatra (N. diardi) and specimens from the
mainland (N. nebulosa nebulosa). There were 12 nucleotide
differences in the Cyt-b gene (4.2 %), 10 in the ATPase-8
gene (5.4 %) and 17 in the control region (3.9 %). In
comparison, three Panthera species (P. pardus, P.tigris and
P. onca) were separated by 38–52 nucleotide differences in
the same fragment. Four fixed nucleotide differences distinguished the individuals from Sumatra and Borneo.
Altogether we found 13 haplotypes among all the clouded
leopards examined. N. nebulosa nebulosa (N = 59 GenBank
accession no. in Table 2. see Figure 1) had six haplotypes
(NEB 1–6), N. diardi (Borneo, N = 7) had 5 haplotypes
(DIB 1–5) and in N. diardi (Sumatra, N = 3) we found 2
haplotypes (DIS 1 & 2).

Phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA haplotypes using minimum evolution (ME), maximum parsimony (MP) and
maximum likelihood (ML) approaches produced congruent topologies that strongly support the reciprocally

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/15

monophyletic status of N.nebulosa and N. diardi with high
bootstrap values (100 % ME/MP, 98 % ML) (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, Sumatran individuals were separated from
Bornean clouded leopards supported by high bootstrap
values; except for the ME approach (46% ME, 85 % MP,
and 81 % ML).
A nuclear pseudogene insertion of cytoplasmic mtDNA
often referred as numt have been reported in numerous
organisms [reviewed in [18]] including the Panthera genus
and the domestic cat [19-21]. This can complicate the
analysis of mtDNA, because numt can coamplify with the
mitochondrial genes. We cannot exclude the presence of
numts in clouded leopards. However, it is very unlikely
that we sequenced numt instead of mtDNA, because all
our protein coding sequences had open reading frames
[22]. Furthermore other nuclear genes did not amplify
with our ancient DNA, even if we tried to sequence very
short fragments. Therefore, we conclude that most likely
we did not encounter any evidence of numt.
Microsatellite analysis
Composite genotypes from 18 felid-specific microsatellite
loci [23,24] were obtained from 11 clouded leopard samples (four mainland specimens NNE 1 – 4, four Bornean
specimens NDB 1 – 4 and three Sumatran specimens NDS
1 – 3), two domestic cats (Felis catus; FCA 1 – 2) and one
leopard (PPA 1). Of the 10 loci, which were used before
in clouded leopards, Buckley-Beason et al. [15] showed
that six microsatellite loci (FCA 82, FCA 105, FCA 132,
FCA 144, FCA 261, FCA 310) had non-overlapping allele
sizes between N. nebulosa (mainland) and N. diardi (Borneo). For only one of these six loci, FCA 261, non-overlapping allele-sizes could not be confirmed by wider
sampling of Bornean and Sumatran specimens. Out of
eight microsatellite loci, which were not tested in clouded
leopards before, three (FCA 23, FCA 43 and HDZ 859) did
not overlap in allele sizes. Overall expected heterozygosity
HE in clouded leopards ranged from 0.488 in the Bornean
population to 0.652 in N. nebulosa and exceeds the
observed heterozygosity H0 in all three populations, with
Bornean specimens having the lowest observed heterozygosity H0 with 0.361 (Table 3).

Neighbor-joining analysis of individual clouded leopard
genotypes based on two microsatellite genetic distance
estimators (Dps & Dkf) produced concordant topologies;
both trees support the species distinction among clouded
leopards (Figure 3). Individuals from Borneo and
Sumatra form a monophyletic clade with 100 % (Dps &
Dkf) bootstrap support (BS) distinguishing them from
mainland specimens and the outgroups. The microsatellite analysis lends further support to the phylogeographic
subdivision observed in mtDNA analysis between Borneo
and Sumatra individuals, however with lower bootstrap

Population substructures
To evaluate population distinctiveness we tested the microsatellite data using a Bayesian algorithm as implemented in BAPS version 4.14 [25]. To estimate hidden
substructures, within clouded leopards BAPS suggested to
partition clouded leopard into five populations (p > 0.99)
three different mainland populations, Sumatra and Borneo. However mtDNA results and previous analysis based
on a broader sampling, including more microsatellite loci
found no substructure among mainland populations
[15]. Therefore we assume that the population partition
within our four mainland individuals is a result of the
small sampling size and thus set a maximum of three populations. BAPS then grouped all mainland, Sumatra, and
Borneo individuals together, respectively (p = 1). We confirmed the individual assignments to each population
with admixture analysis in BAPS [26,27]. In this scenario
all individuals were assigned to three unique clusters N.
nebulosa,N. diardi (Borneo) and N. diardi (Sumatra) with

very high admixture coefficients (all q > 0.98, except for
one Sumatran individual (NDS1) q > 0.95) (Figure 2B).
No individual had a Bayesian p-value less than 0.05 (all p
> 0.91) revealing no evidence of admixed background and
none or very low degrees of past and present gene flow
between all three populations.
MtDNA sequence differences were used to estimate the
divergence time of N.nebulosa and N. diardi and the time
of origin of Sumatran clouded leopards. Using a calibration of 6.37 MYA for the divergence of clouded leopards
from the Panthera lineage [14], N. diardi diverged from N.
nebulosa about 2.86 MYA (95 % CI of 1.71–4.02 MYA)
and Sumatran and Bornean clouded leopards diverged
about 437,000 years ago (95 % CI of 30,000 – 845,000
years ago).

Discussion
Our results strongly support the reclassification of extant
clouded leopards into two distinct species N. nebulosa and
N. diardi. Based on mtDNA data clouded leopards on the
islands of Sumatra and Borneo have been reproductively

isolated from the mainland species since middle to late
Pliocene (~2.86 MYA). We are aware that recent studies
showed that mtDNA is least robust in node resolution
[14], which might lead to an overestimate of our calculated length of time. However previously estimated divergence time of 1.41 MYA between N. nebulosa and N. diardi
[15] is still within the same range (1 – 3 MYA) as species

level distinctions across Panthera [14]. The wider sampling of Bornean individuals dispels the doubt that the
high distinction between N. nebulosa and N. diardi
described before was a consequence of an inadequate
sample size [15]. Referring to their origin on two Sunda
Islands, we would propose to give N. diardi the common
name "Sundaland clouded leopard".

ID codes are shown in Table 1.
Furthermore, the consistent results of mtDNA and microsatellite data provide an evidence for a reduced gene flow
between Sumatra and Borneo. The trend in the reduction
of observed heterozygosity might indicate a Wahlund
effect, within Neofelis, as well as within N. diardi. Due to
the low number of samples from each population within
the sampling this result should be considered as preliminary, although it supports a hypothesised disconnection
of gene flow between clouded leopard populations on the
islands of Borneo and Sumatra. On the basis of our
genetic results we recommend the recognition of two distinct subspecies of N. diardi (Figure 4), considering previous criteria for the designation of subspecies [28,29]. We
estimate that since the middle to late Pleistocene Bornean
and Sumatran clouded leopards were most likely isolated
from each other and unable to move freely between
islands. However, it has to be considered that our sample
size of Sumatran specimens is small and further molecular
genetic and morphological studies will be needed to confirm our findings. If these studies will support our data,
we suggest giving clouded leopards on Borneo and
Sumatra the scientific names N. diardi borneensis and
N.diardi sumatrensis, referring to their origin.
Our results have several implications for the conservation
and management strategies for modern clouded leopards.
N. nebulosa and N. diardi should be managed separately,

and treated as different species as suggested before
[15,16]. Furthermore, on the basis of the population division between Bornean and Sumatran clouded leopards we
suggest that these populations should also be managed
separately. Considering previous criteria for the designation of evolutionarily significant units (ESU) [30-35], Bornean and Sumatran clouded leopards should be treated as
different conservation units with separate management
plans. Both populations are on the one hand reproductively isolated from each other and monophyletic for
mtDNA and microsatellites and on the other hand Bornean and Sumatran individuals represent an important
component of the evolutionary legacy of the species. To
our knowledge there have been no translocations between
clouded leopards from Borneo and Sumatra so far.
The continued depletion of tropical rainforests and fragmentation of natural habitats in Borneo and Sumatra put
the reclassified species N diardi under severe pressure of
extinction [7,36]. Therefore a higher priority should be
placed on effective conservation of Sundaland clouded
leopards and their shrinking habitats. Further research is
urgently needed to reveal the distribution and status of
different species in situ, because smaller distribution
ranges associated with reduced gene pools of the reclassified species puts clouded leopards under a greater risk of
extinction. The current IUCN Red Data category "vulnera-

ble" [37] might underestimate the threat these cats are facing. To date only for Sabah (north-eastern part of Borneo)
preliminary rough population estimates exist, demonstrating the severe threat of Bornean clouded leopards [7].
The inclusion of Sumatran samples reveals a very interesting aspect of clouded leopards' evolutionary history. At
present, shallow seas separate Sumatra, Borneo, Java and
Malay Peninsula. These areas were connected several
times via land bridges during periods of low sea levels in
the late Pliocene and Pleistocene [e. g. [38-40]]. Therefore
many authors have characterized Sundaland as a geographical unit across which species should have been able
to move freely during glacial periods until 10,000 years
ago when higher sea-levels started to separate the islands
[41-44]. Based on the presented data we cannot support
the hypothesis of one geographical unit for the clouded
leopard, because Bornean and Sumatran animals were
reproductively isolated from the mainland individuals
even during glaciation periods with accompanying low
sea levels and postulated land bridges. In contrast,
clouded leopards were only able to move throughout the
exposed shelf between Borneo and Sumatra at least once
during the early or middle Pleistocene. Therefore, despite
the late Pleistocene existence of land connections [39,40],
present-day distribution patterns, exemplarily shown here
for the clouded leopard, indicate that dispersal was
restricted and there appear to have been considerable barriers for animal migrations [40,45,46]. The wider sampling of this study in addition to previous studies [15,16]
have provided a better insight into phylogeographic history of one of the least known cat species in South-East
Asia.

Conclusion
The results we present in this paper are of importance for
the understanding of clouded leopard phylogeny and for
their in situ and ex situ conservation and management. The
different species N. nebulosa and N. diardi, as well as the
two distinct populations on Borneo and Sumatra, should
be managed separately, to protect the genetic diversity
upon which future evolutionary potential depends. Our
paper gives a good example of the importance of taxonomic splitting for conservation, because the two species
and the distinct populations on Borneo and Sumatra face
a much greater risk of extinction, due to smaller distribution ranges, than previously assessed based on the former
classification.
The wider genetic sampling contributed to the understanding of the evolutionary history of clouded leopards.
The long isolation of N. diardi and N. nebulosa revealed
that the clouded leopard, comparable to other forestdwelling species [47-51], had a deep history of vicariant
evolution. Our results show that geographical or ecologi-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/4/1/15

cal barriers must have existed during Pleistocene glaciation periods hindering migrations of clouded leopards.
This raises the question about the phylogeographic history of other taxa in the Sunda shelf and further research
will be needed for a better understanding of evolutionary
processes in this region

Methods
Samples and DNA extraction
We sampled four wild-born specimens from the islands of
Borneo, three ancient samples from Sumatra and four
recent animals from known geographic origin on the
mainland (Table 1) in addition to 58 clouded leopard
individuals described previously [15]. Panthera species
and domestic cat individuals as outgroups for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis were specified before [15]
and for outgroup comparison of the microsatellite analysis one leopard (Panthera pardus) and two domestic cats
(Felis catus) were sampled (Table 1).

DNA was extracted from fecal samples using QiAmp Stool
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and from serum and
whole blood using QiAmp DNeasy (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For the extraction of DNA from historical museum
samples hide and dry tissue samples were cut into small
pieces using a sterile scalpel followed by a standard proteinase K digestion with an extended incubation interval at
56°C for up to 72 hours [40] until only little solid tissue
remained. A standard phenol/chloroform extraction procedure was then used for DNA extraction [52]. DNA was
suspended in 50 μl of double distilled H2O.
Mitochondrial DNA analysis
We used a 426 bp portion of a central conserved region
within the D-loop of the control region [53] in addition
to two mtDNA (ATPase-8 and Cyt-b) genes [15]. The control region primers were modified by Janecka JE (pers.
comm.) [(F) CTC AAC TAT CCG AAA GAG CTT] and [(R)
CCT GTG GAA CAT TAG GAA TT]. In total we amplified
900 bp of mtDNA.

PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl
containing 2.5 μl MolTaq 10x PCR Buffer, 2 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer, 2 units of MolTaq
polymerase (Molzym GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and 2 μl
of genomic DNA. PCR reactions were performed in an

ing. Sequences were edited, assembled and aligned using
ClustalW [54] implemented in BioEdit (Version 7.0.5.2)
[55], before being exported to PAUP (Version 4.0b10)
[56] for phylogenetic analysis. Sequences from each of the
mtDNA fragments were concatenated into a 900 bp
sequences, because results from separate analysis of each
gene fragment showed identical topologies [57] and mitochondrial genes usually do not recombine [58]. Phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes were estimated
using minimum evolution (ME), maximum likelihood
(ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) [56,59]. We used
Kimura 2-parameter distance with neighbor-joining (NJ)
algorithm followed by tree-bisection reconnection
branch-swapping procedure (TBR) for the ME analysis.
MP trees were conducted using a heuristic search, with 10
random taxon addition replicates and TBR branch swapping. The ML approach was performed using the HKY85
model [60]. Each phylogenetic tree was rooted with the
domestic cat sequence. Reliability of all trees was tested
with bootstrap values by 1000 replicates of heuristic
search and TBR branch swapping.
The approximate age of separation between N. nebulosa
and N. diardi was estimated using LINTREE [61]. A neighbor-joining tree [59] was generated with Kimura 2-parameter γ-corrected distances [62] using the combined 900 bp
mtDNA sequence. The molecular clock test implemented
in LINTREE [61] showed that the sequences did not deviate significantly from the rate constancy test (p > 0.05).
The coalescence point between clouded leopards and the
Panthera genus, being 6.37 MYA based upon a comprehensive analysis of nuclear gene sequences and multiple
fossil dates [14], was chosen to be the calibration point for
this study. We used a range of two standard errors to calculate a 95 % confidence interval.
Microsatellite markers
We used 10 felid dinucleotide microsatellite primers (FCA
8, FCA 45, FCA 77, FCA82, FCA 105, FCA 126, FCA 132,
FCA 144, FCA 261, FCA 310) [23], which were already
used in a previous study on clouded leopards [15]. Those
microsatellites are located on 8 felid autosomes and all of
them are at least 5 centimorgans apart from each other
[23]. In addition to those ten microsatellite loci of known
allele size ranges for clouded leopards, we applied 8 microsatellites of unknown allele sizes for clouded leopards,
FCA 23 and FCA 43 [23], and HDZ 3, HDZ 57, HDZ 64,
HDZ 89, HDZ817, HDZ 859 [24]. PCR amplifications
were performed in a final reaction volume of 10 μl utilizing described methods [23,24]. The IR-dye-labeled PCR
products were diluted and analyzed on a LI-COR 4300
DNA-Analyser (LI-COR Bioscience GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). Data were collected and analyzed using
Saga Generation 2 (Version 3.2.1).

To test their performance as population genetic markers,
all microsatellites were tested for deviations from linkage
disequilibrium (LD) using GENEPOP on the web version
3.4 [63]. Measures of microsatellite genetic variation in
terms of observed and expected heterozygosities were estimated with Arlequin 3.1 [64].
Pairwise genetic distance among clouded leopards and the
two outgroup species was estimated with two microsatellite genetic distance estimators: the proportion of shared
alleles (Dps) and the kinship coefficient (Dkf) with the [1
– ps/kf] option in MICROSAT [65]. Phylogenetic NJ-trees
were constructed from the Dps and Dkf distance matrixes
using NEIGHBOR (included in PHYLIP version 3.66)
[66]. Bootstrap values for 1000 bootstrap replicates in
MICROSAT were calculated using CONSENSE TREE
(included in PHYLIP version 3.66) [66]. Trees were drawn
using the program TREEVIEW (version 1.6.6) [67].
Population structure analysis
A Bayesian clustering method as implemented in BAPS
[25-27] was used to infer population structure based on
multilocus microsatellite genotype data. This program
estimates the hidden population substructure by testing
whether the allele frequencies between populations are
significantly different. A major advantage compared to
most other methods is that the number of populations is
treated here as an unknown parameter that can be estimated from the dataset. We performed 10 independent
runs of clustering of individuals with the microsatellite genotypes to ensure homogenous results. In all ten runs we
obtained similar results (data not shown). After the clustering of individuals by their allele frequencies the results
were used to perform an admixture analysis. We used 500
iterations and a number of 1000 reference individuals per
population each with 20 iterations. The estimated admixture coefficient for an individual in each cluster q (maximum = 1) was used as a measure of correct assignments.
The Bayesian p-value tells the proportion of reference
individuals simulated from the population in which the
individual was originally clustered having the admixture
coefficient to the cluster smaller than or equal to the individual [27]. Individuals having p-values larger than 0.05
are by default considered as having "non-significant" evidence for admixture [27].
