Abstract
Background: The nephropathogenic avian infectious bronchitis (IB) caused unprecedented economic losses to the
commercial chicken industry of China in 2008-2009. To investigate the prevalence of nephropathogenic IB in China,
eighty IBV isolates from different provinces during 2008-2009 were identified by dwarf embryo test and RT-PCR.
Results: The strains were mostly isolated in winter and spring with a wide age range of IB outbreaks, from 4 to 69
days. By the virus recovery trials, 70/80 of the strains resulted in the deaths or distresses of birds from nephritis. To
learn more about the molecular evolutionary characteristics of the circulating field strains, the coding region of
major spike 1 (S1) protein gene of these strains was RT-PCR amplified and sequenced. Compared to the published
representative strains, nucleotides and amino acids sequence analysis indicated that the S1 genes of these strains
and the reference strains displayed homologies ranging from 75.1% to 99.8% and from 73.1% to 99.8%
respectively. S1 protein of the major pandemic strains contained 540 or 542 amino acids with the cleavage site of
HRRRR or RRFRR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that recent field isolates of IBV in China were mostly belonged to
A2-branch (QXIBV-branch) and HN08-branch, only one isolate was belonged to Gray-branch and M41-branch
respectively. Most of the 80 strains showed evolutionarily distant from vaccine strains.
Conclusions: The results of this study suggested that nephropathogenic IBVs were mainly A2-like strains in China
during 2008-2009.

Background
Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a serious and highly contagious disease of chickens, accompanied by decreased egg
production and poor egg quality in laying flocks. Avian
infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was first reported in
the USA, replicating in the respiratory tract and some
epithelial cells of gut, kidney, and oviduct [1-3]. IBV
commonly predisposed the birds to secondary infection
with some bacterium, such as Escherichia coli and
Mycoplasma gallisepticum, resulting in complicated disease process and increased mortality [4,5]. The clinical
disease and production problems frequently cause catastrophic economic losses to the poultry industry all over

the world. IBV belongs to the genus Coronaviridae,
family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and possesses a
single stranded positive-sense RNA genome encoding
four structure proteins, phosphorylated nucleocapsid
(N) protein, small envelope protein (E), integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and spike glycoprotein (S) [6,7].
The S glycoprotein on the outside of the virus contains
epitopes associated with serotype differences, and is
cleaved post-translationally by cellular proteases into the
S1 and S2 subunits [8,9]. The globular S1 subunit forms
the tip of a spike, extending outward, plays a role in
attachment and entry into the host cell, which has relation to induce virus neutralizing antibody and hemagglutination inhibition antibody, whereas the S2 subunit
anchors the S1 moiety to the viral membrane [8-11].
Coding for the heavily glycosylated spike glycoprotein,
the error-prone nature of RNA polymerase made the S1
gene could easily generate nucleotide insertions,

deletions, point mutations, and RNA recombination
under vaccine pressure, to bring about new variation
strain and change of tissue tropism [12-16]. It is documented that only a few amino acid differences amongst
S proteins are sufficient to have a detrimental impact on
cross-protection [15,17-20]. Antigenically different serotypes and newly emerged variants of field chicken flocks
lead to vaccine breaks [21,22].
Recently, more than 20 serotypes within IBV have
been identified worldwide. The complex epidemiology
characterize of IB raised the control difficulty. In China,
since IBV strains were first isolated and identified in
1982, various live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines
derived from Massachusetts (Mass) serotype strains
have been widely and extensively used in chicken farms
to reduce the adverse effect of the IBV [23,24]. However, the disease continues to emerge and cause serious
production problems, even occurred in routinely vaccinated layer and breeder flocks in China, and the situation gets worse as time progressed [25].
It was documented that nephropathogenic type IB has
become more and more prevalent in China. The unprecedented economic losses caused by the nephropathogenic
IB suggested that selecting the appropriate vaccine strain
against the IB outbreaks is of great importance [25,26].
However, the integrated natures of novel circulating IBV
strains in mainland China were not well-learned.
The previous study by other researchers has been
revealed that the variation in S1 sequences was closely
confirmed relative to the emergence of novel strains,
and S1 gene sequence was a good predictor of challenge
of immunity in chickens [17,18,27]. This study was conducted to identify the IBV strains that have escaped
immune defenses conferred by vaccination in China.
The genetic characterization of recent IBV field isolates
in China was performed by sequencing the whole S1
genes, sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
compared with other reference strains.

Results
Eighty IBV strains isolated during 2008-2009 in China

From unhealthy birds suspected of IBV infection in the
vaccinated chicken flocks from Guangdong, Guangxi,
Fujian, Hainan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Chongqing, Hubei,
Sichuan and Jiangxi province of China, 80 filed IBV
strains were isolated during 2008-2009. The isolation
rates in the two years were season-dependent to some
extent, 30 strains were isolated in October, while only
seven strains were isolated in summer (from June to
August). The ages of flocks at the time of the outbreak
varied between 4 and 69 days. Most of the strains were
isolated from the chickens between 10 to 30 days of age.
The detailed clinical record of each strain was showed
in Table 1.

After three passage propagation, IBVs of all isolates
induced peripheric lesions and growth retardation of
embryo at 72 h post-inoculation. Since the fourth day
post-inoculation, most of the chicks were listless and
huddled together, showed ruffled feathers. The results of
virus recovery in chicks indicated 87.5% (70/80) isolates
caused serious kidney lesions, which were presented
with swollen specked kidney and distended ureters filled
with uric acid were nephropathogenic type, and the
other ten isolates in the study caused respiratory system
signs, which were consistent with the clinical record of
each strain (Table 1).
Homologies among S1 nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequences

The obtained strains were characterized phylogenetically
by nucleotide sequence analysis of the hyper-variable S1
gene of IBV. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence
similarities between the eighty IB strains were ranging
from 75.4% (strain CQ8 and HY) to 100% (strain PT1
and PT3) and 73.9% to 100%, respectively. Compared to
the 28 reference strains published in the GenBank, the
identity of the nucleotide and amino acid sequence
among the 108 isolates (including the 80 isolates in this
study plus the 28 reference strains) were 75.1 to 99.8%
and 73.1 to 99.8%, respectively, indicating low homology
and high variation among the isolated and reference
strains.
Mutation analysis

As shown in the Table 2 and Table 3, S1 genes of the
newly strains contain mutations, insertions and deletions, resulting in different lengths of nucleotides. S1
genes of these strains were generated and confirmed
from three time sequencing results, contained 1641,
1647, 1650, 1653, 1656, 1659 and 1662 nucleotides,
amino acids sequences ranging from 547 (LC strain) to
554 (LC strain). The length differences indicated amino
acid insertions and deletions exist among the different
strains.
Through the alignment analysis, the deletions, insertions and mutations of each obtained S1 gene was summarized in Table 2. Most variations in the deduced
amino acid sequences of Chinese IBVs were observed
among residues 63-69, 211-212 and 354-358 (numbering
was with reference to S1 sequence of the Mass41 strain).
The precursor protein of S glycoprotein is cleaved into
amino-terminal S1 and S2 protein by the protease during viral maturation [9]. In this study, the most common
cleavage recognition sites of S1 gene were RRF(S/L) RR
(49/80) or HRRRR (28/80) in the China field strains
(Table 3). The exceptional ones included CQ8
(RRTGR), HY52 (RRSKR), and HY2 (RRSKR). The cleavage sites of these two strains containing amino acids K,

T, and G, were novel motifs compared to the reference
strains, and quite different with the other isolates of the
cleavage site.
Phylogenetic analysis of the isolated strains

A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotides sequences of the S1 glycoprotein genes. As shown
in the Figure 1, the 80 isolates IBV strains were clustered into five distinct genetic groups or genotypes
which were considerably heterogeneous, including A2type (49 newly isolated strains), 4/91-type (9 newly isolated strains), HN08-type (20 newly isolated strains),
Gray-type and M41-type. The newly isolated strains
mainly belonged to A2-type, 4/91-type and HN08-type
branch. The phylogenetic relationship of strains at different times and geographical regions displayed complexity and diversity.
Strains isolated from Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian province mainly belonged to
the A2 branch, also including other seven published IBV
strains from China (QXIBV, CK/CH/LJL/07II, CK/CH/
LJS/07IV, CK/CH/LSD/08-12, IBVSX4, LZ05 and LZ07).

The isolated strains of Hainan province and a few isolated strains from Guangdong and Fujian province
belonged to the HN08 branch, included PSH050513 and
CK/CH/LCQ/08II. Group Gray-type was correlative
with the American strain (Gray), included other two
classical American strains (ARK99 and Holte), one Japanese strain (JP9758), and the exceptional field strain
(CQ08). Most of the current vaccine strains (H120, H52,
Ma5, M41, W93, 4/91 and 28/86) were belonged to the
M41 branch, which including one field strains (NJ).
However, the current pandemic strains were mostly 4/
91-type, A2-type (QXIBV-type) and HN08-type, indicating that the field IBVs co-circulating in chicken flocks
in China were evolutionarily distant from the known
vaccine strains.

Discussion
Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the most common
and difficult-control poultry diseases in China, caused
persistent but infrequent outbreaks in commercial
chicken farms [24,25,28]. Commercial vaccines based on
H120, H52, 28/86, Ma5, W93 and M41 strains, have

been widely used to control the disease [2,29]. Natural
outbreaks of IBV often are the result of infections with
strains that differ serologically from the vaccine strains.
Come to the rapid and complicated evolutionary of IBV,
it is imperative to learn profoundly the circulating IBVs,
facilitate selecting the candidate vaccine strain against
the infections [2,24].
In this study, 80 IBV strains were isolated from the
vaccinated chicken flocks, with a wide age range of IB
outbreak. The chickens infected before the age of 5 days

IBVs or the maternal antibody could not provide pertinent protection against the prevalent strains [30].
Furthermore, there was accumulating evidence indicated
that the nephropathogenic IBVs have become prevalent
in China in last several years [23,26,31]. Through clinical
records and the virus recovery trials, 70 identified isolates mainly caused typical swollen kidney, different
from the respiratory type strains isolated in earlier years,
including the major vaccine strains. These findings indicated that all 80 isolated IBV strains from China during
2008-2009 were evolutionarily distant from the vaccine
strains used for current, resulting in vaccination failure
cases.
The S1 protein determined the serotypic evolution,
the phenotype change and the genetic diversity of IBVs
[32]. In the present study, nucleotide and derived amino
acid sequences of S1 protein genes of the 80 field strains
were aligned and compared to the representative strains,
to determine the relationship of circulating field isolates,
vaccine strains and previously described variant strains.
Newly isolated strains shared between 75.4% to 100%
nucleotide sequence similarity with each other, higher
similarity than the vaccine strains and other representative IBVs. Although the IBVs all over the world shared
some common antigenic types, virus strains within a
geographic region were unique and distinct, even in different provinces of China. The variants were mostly
located in the first 300 amino acids in the N-terminal of
the S1 protein of IBV, even though the mutants consisted of insertions, deletions and point mutations were
complicated and detailedly different, the hypervariable
regions in S1 protein in this study were similar to previous studies [19,23,26].
The phylogenetic analysis showed that there were five
subgroups of IBVs co-circulating in China, and multiple
strains might cause the constant IB outbreaks. The newly
isolated strains were mostly derived from A2, 4/91 and

HN08. Only CK/CH/Chongqing/0908 belonged to the
branch of Gray. The phylogenetic distributions were closely relative to geographical factors. Most of the recently
isolated IBVs in this study formed the distinct cluster
related to the A2 type. However, the routine vaccine
strains mainly belong to M41-type branch. A2 strain is
closely related to 4/91 serotype, spreading over Europe
since its first isolation in UK in 1991 [9,24,33-37]. In this
study, 61.3% (49/80) field isolates belonged to the A2type branch, which included 85.7% (42/49) nephropathogenic field isolates of this study. The QXIBV, first isolated in China and reported associated predominantly
with various forms of renal pathology in China, was also
representative A2-type strain [25,31]. The analysis results
were according to the prevalence of nephropathogenicity
IB. To date, the QX-like IBV strains have been widely
isolated in many European countries, and become a
dominant genotype [5,38]. Through IB surveys, the European QX-like IBV strains have been reported that
caused 86% respiratory signs, 22% litter or enteric problems, only 2% had swollen kidneys [39]. Absorbingly,
the QX-like IBV strains have undergone divergent evolution paths, brought out different variants in Europe and
China. Similarly, seven exceptional strains located in the
A2-type branch caused evident respiratory problems,
including three isolates from Zhejiang province (QZ1,
QZ2 and QZ3) and three isolates from Guangdong province (XD2, XD3 and LZ2), and GL from Guangxi province. The results of our study indicated the strain
grouping, such as phenotype and genotype, were not only
depended on the geographical factors. The evolutionary
pace and the epidemiology characteristics of the IBV
were complicated.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the data obtained from our study suggest
most of present IBV isolates in China are A2-like
nephropathogenic strains. To control the prevalence and
well prepare for the potential outbreaks of IB, the candidate virus strain for vaccination might be selected timely
and specifically in a geographical region, which manifests the importance of continuing surveillance of new
IBV strains. This paper is a periodic report on our
ongoing surveillance program. We hope the study could
contribute to guiding the development of effective vaccines and establishment of control policy for IB.
Materials and methods
Viruses

During the period from June 2008 to November 2009,
circulating field IBV isolates were selected from suspected broilers and broiler breeders in vaccinated flocks
from eastern, southern, southwestern and central China.
Documented clinical signs of the birds included typical

respiratory and nephropathogenic IB symptoms and
pathological changes. The homogenized tissue pool of
kidney and trachea of the field isolates collected from
the chickens infected naturally were frozen and thawed
three times, treated with 200 μg/ml gentamicin and 200
U/ml penicillin and centrifuged at 7,000 × g. After incubating for three hours at 4°C, the supernatant samples
were propagated by inoculating via the allantoic cavity
with 0.2 ml of each isolate into three 10 day old SPF
embryonated eggs for more than three passages. All the
isolated strains were verified by the observation of
curled and dwarfed embryos. The embryos dying within
24 hours of inoculation were discounted and screened
to be nonspecific deaths.
The viruses were further confirmed by RT-PCR assay.
Total RNA extraction of the allantoic fluid was completed
using RNAiso reagent (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian,
China) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was carried out by PrimeScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit
with the IBV primers (National standard, GBT231972008), one primer pair targeting the M gene (Ms: 5’CCTAAGAACGGTTGGAAT-3’, Mx: 5’-TACTCTCTACAC ACACAC-3’) and another pair for the 3’ UTR of
genome (3’s: 5’-GGAAGATAGGCATGTAGCTT-3’, 3’x:
5’-CTAACTCTATAC TAGCCTAT-3’).
The allantoic fluids containing IBV isolates after 72 h
post inoculation were harvested for subsequent experiments, and the remains were preserved in liquid
nitrogen.
Virus recovery

Five 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were intranasally inoculated with filtration sterilized allantoic fluid
of each isolated virus strains, respectively. All of the
chicks were examined and recorded daily for clinical
signs of infection and mortality for 20 days post-inoculation, the dead birds were necrospied for lesions of
respiratory tract or nephritis. Finally, all the survivors
were sacrificed and necrospied.
RT-PCR and S1 gene sequencing

Figure 1 The phylogenetic tree of IBVs isolated in mainland
China during 2008-2009 based on the viral S1 sequences. The
reference strains in this study were marked with “▲”.

A pair of specific primers was designed to amplify the
entire S1 protein gene, including the forward primer
(S1F): 5’-AAGACTGAACAAAAGACCGACT-3’, and
the reverse primer (S1R): 5’-CAAAACCTGCCATAACTAACATA-3’. Reverse transcription and amplification
were performed using the PrimeScriptTM One-Step
RT-PCR Kit in 25 μl reaction volume containing 20 μl
of RT-PCR PreMix (reaction buffer, dNTPs, 2 μl of
enzyme mix), 2 μl of extracted viral RNA and the specific primer pair. Reverse transcription and amplification
were performed as one cycle of 50°C for 30 min, 94°C
for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C

for 40 s, annealing at 51°C for 40 s and extension at 72°
C for 2 min, respectively) with a final 10 min extension
step at 72°C. The PCR products were cloned into
pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China)
for later sequencing (AuGCT Biotechnology, Beijing,
China).
