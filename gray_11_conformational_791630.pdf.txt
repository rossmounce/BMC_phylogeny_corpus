Abstract
Background: CD4-binding site (CD4bs) alterations in gp120 contribute to HIV-1 envelope (Env) mediated
fusogenicity and the ability of gp120 to utilize low levels of cell-surface CD4. In a recent study, we constructed
three-dimensional models of gp120 to illustrate CD4bs conformations associated with enhanced fusogenicity and
enhanced CD4-usage of a modestly-sized panel of blood-derived HIV-1 Envs (n = 16). These conformations were
characterized by a wider aperture of the CD4bs cavity, as constrained by the inner-most atoms at the gp120 V1V2
stem and the V5 loop. Here, we sought to provide further validation of the utility of these models for
understanding mechanisms that influence Env function, by characterizing the structure-function relationships of a
larger panel of Envs derived from brain and other tissues (n = 81).
Findings: Three-dimensional models of gp120 were generated by our recently validated homology modelling
protocol. Analysis of predicted CD4bs structures showed correlations between the aperture width of the CD4bs
cavity and ability of the Envs to mediate cell-cell fusion, scavenge low-levels of cell-surface CD4, bind directly to
soluble CD4, and bind to the Env mAb IgG1b12 whose epitope overlaps the gp120 CD4bs. These structural
alterations in the CD4bs cavity were associated with repositioning of the V5 loop.
Conclusions: Using a large, independent panel of Envs, we can confirm the utility of three-dimensional gp120
structural models for illustrating CD4bs alterations that can affect Env function. Furthermore, we now provide new
evidence that these CD4bs alterations augment the ability of gp120 to interact with CD4 by increasing the
exposure of the CD4bs.

Findings
The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
envelope glycoproteins (Env) mediate virus entry into
cells and exist as trimers, comprising the surface gp120
glycoproteins noncovalently linked to transmembrane
gp41 glycoproteins that embed the complex into the
viral membrane [1-3]. HIV-1 entry is initiated by gp120
binding to cellular CD4, which facilitates the initial
attachment of virus to the target cell [4]. The binding of
gp120 to CD4 results in dramatic conformational
changes in gp120 that expose the binding site for a

secondary coreceptor, which is either of the chemokine
receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 (reviewed in [5-7]).
Crystallographic and biochemical studies of gp120
have provided valuable insights into mechanisms
involved in CD4 binding and CD4-induced conformational changes [3,8-12]. The unliganded gp120 core of
simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) consists of a highly
conserved inner domain which faces the trimer axis and
a heavily glycosylated, globular outer domain which is
mostly exposed on the surface of the trimer [8]. However, thermodynamic and structural analysis of the
gp120-CD4 interaction demonstrated little evidence of a
structured CD4 binding pocket on the unliganded
gp120, and that CD4bs elements which influence gp120CD4 affinity are formed from conformational alterations

that occur after gp120 has encountered CD4 [2,10]. CD4
interacts with gp120 via surface-exposed residues within
three separate regions distributed over six segments of
gp120. These regions include the a-helices of the inner
domain, the CD4 binding loop of outer domain, and the
b20-b21 ribbon which becomes part of the gp120 bridging sheet, which is a structural element of gp120
formed after CD4 binding that is involved in coreceptor
binding [3,11].
Changes in CD4 binding to gp120 contribute to different pathophysiological phenotypes of HIV-1, including
the fusogenic properties of the Env [13,14]. Env mediates most of the acute cytopathic effects of HIV-1 infection in cultured cells [15], and membrane fusion appears
to be an important factor contributing to HIV-1 cytopathicity in vitro [16,17]. In addition, enhancement of
pathogenicity of chimeric simian-HIV (SHIV) strains in
macaques frequently results from increased Envmediated fusogenicity [18-22]. Moreover, the cytopathic
effects of Env-mediated HIV-1 fusogenicity are evident
in humans. For example, the presence of multinucleated
giant cells in brain, formed by Env-mediated fusion
between infected and uninfected macrophage lineage
cells, is characteristic of HIV-1 encephalitis and a neuropathological hallmark of HIV-associated dementia [23].
To better understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to alterations in CD4 binding by primary
gp120 proteins and the subsequent influence on Env
function, we recently developed and validated a protocol
to produce and utilize three-dimensional structural
models of gp120 to deduce CD4bs alterations that influence CD4 binding and Env-mediated fusogenicity [13].
Using a modestly-sized panel of blood derived Envs (n =
16), we showed that a wider aperture of the predicted
CD4bs cavity, as constrained by the inner-most atoms at
the gp120 V1V2 stem and the V5 loop, contributed to
increased fusogenicity and ability of gp120 to bind CD4.
In the present study, we sought to provide further validation of the utility of these molecular models for
understanding mechanisms that influence Env function,
by characterizing, for the first time, the structure-function relationships of a larger panel of Envs derived from
brain and other tissues (n = 81).
Production and characterization of a panel of primary
Env clones

Primary HIV-1 viruses isolated from autopsy brain and/
or cerebrospinal fluid, spinal cord, lymph node, spleen
or PBMC from subjects CB1, CB3, MACS1, MACS2,
MACS3, UK1 and UK7 have been described in detail
previously [14,24-27]. The clinical characteristics of the
subjects and coreceptor usage profiles of the primary
viruses are summarized in Table 1. A 2.1 kb fragment

env (corresponding to nucleotides 6348 to 8478 in
HXB2) was amplified from viral cDNA by PCR and
cloned into the pSVIII-HXB2 Env expression vector
[28], as described previously [29-33]. Between 4 and 6
functional Envs from each virus were identified by entry
assays in JC53 cells with Env-pseudotyped GFP reporter
viruses, as described previously [30,33-35] (Table 1).
The coreceptor specificity of the cloned Envs was determined by entry assays in Cf2th-CD4/CCR5 and Cf2thCD4/CXCR4 cells [35,36] with Env-pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses, as described previously [29,35],
which recapitulated the coreceptor usage of the primary
viruses (Table 1). The Envs were sequenced in their
entirety and subjected to multiple sequence alignments
(data not shown) and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1),
which together showed that the Envs were independent
and compartmentalized according to their tissue of origin. Thus, we established and characterized a new panel
of Envs (n = 81) derived from autopsy brain and other
tissues of 7 subjects who died from AIDS.
Production of three-dimensional gp120 models and
characterization of the CD4bs cavity

We next produced three-dimensional structural models
of each of the 81 Envs using a protocol that we
described recently [13,32]. Briefly, homology models of
CD4-bound gp120 sequences were prepared using the
Build Model protocol of the Discovery Studio suite, version 1.6 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA). This approach
used the Modeller algorithm to generate an atomic
model of the target protein from a template molecule
and a sequence alignment. The template-based models
were optimized by iterative cycles of conjugate-gradient
minimisation against a probability density function that
included spatial restraints derived from the template
and residue specific properties [37]. The crystal structure of JRFL gp120 containing the V3 variable loop and
bound to CD4 and the X5 Fab antibody fragment was
used as the template for CD4-bound models [9] (Protein
Data Bank ID: 2B4C). The X5 antibody fragment was
deleted from the CD4-bound template prior to modeling. The coordinates for gp120 and CD4 were extracted
from the 2B4C crystal structure. Sequence alignments
were generated between JRFL gp120 and the primary
gp120 Env clones. The sequence for CD4 was included
as a second polypeptide chain such that the models of
gp120 were constructed as complexes with CD4. The
V1V2 variable loops were replaced with a GAG linker
sequence and the N- and C- termini overhangs were cut
using the modeling software.
Similarities in three-dimensional structure were measured by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the
distances between main-chain atoms (N, Ca, C and O
atoms) from crystal and model structures after rigid

The clinical and neuropathological details of the study subjects, and the derivation and characterization of the primary tissue derived HIV-1 isolates have been
published previously [14,24,27], and are summarized again here to assist in the interpretation of the data derived from the cloned Envs. Envs were amplified
from primary virus isolates by PCR and cloned into the pSVIII-Env expression vector as described previously [29,30,33,35]. Functional Envs were identified by
pseudotyping onto Env-deficient GFP reporter virus and entry assays in JC53 cells, as described previously [14,29,30,34,35]. Coreceptor usage of cloned Envs was
determined by pseudotyping onto Env-deficient luciferase reporter virus that were generated in 293T cells, and entry assays in Cf2th-CD4 cells expressing CCR5
or CXCR4, as described previously [30,35]. The coreceptor usage of Envs derived from brain and spleen of subject MACS1 has been reported recently [30]. The
additional Envs described here have been assigned Genbank accession numbers JN001990 to JN002061. Six functional Envs were cloned from Macs2-BR and
UK1-BR viruses, but sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that only 5 and 4 clones, respectively, were independent with unique nucleotide sequences.
Thus, only independent Envs are listed here and included for the subsequent structural and functional analyses. MH, male homosexual; IVDU, intravenous drug

body superposition, where an RMSD of < 1Ã signifies a
high level of three-dimensional structural similarity
between overlayed proteins. The overall quality of the
geometry of gp120 models generated was verified using
PROCHECK [38].
The three-dimensional structural similarity between
the 2B4C JRFL crystal structure and the 81 predicted
structures of the primary gp120 proteins was < 1.0 Ã
for all the primary gp120 models (data not shown), indicating a high overall degree of structural similarity.
Identical RMSD values for each gp120 model were
obtained upon repeated, independent modeling operations (data not shown). The aperture width of the
CD4bs cavity was deduced from each of the threedimensional gp120 structural models by measuring the
distance between the inner most atoms present at the
stem of the V1V2 loops and the V5 loop, which constrain the CD4 binding pocket of gp120 [9]. Figure 2
shows the derivation of the CD4bs aperture width for
the Macs2ln5 gp120 model as an example. Analysis of
structural models generated for all the 81 Envs showed

that the aperture width of the predicted CD4bs cavity
ranges from 30 to 36 Ã in this panel of Envs.
An increased aperture width of the gp120 CD4bs cavity is
associated with increased fusogenicity, increased CD4usage, and increased IgG1b12 Env mAb binding

To determine whether alterations in the width of the
gp120 CD4bs aperture may influence Env function, we
first performed quantitative cell-cell fusion assays with
293T effector cells expressing equivalent levels of Env
on the cell surface, and target cells expressing coreceptor and either relatively high or relatively low levels of
CD4 as described previously [13]. In these assays, we
observed positive correlations between the width of the
gp120 CD4bs cavity and the overall level of cell-cell
fusion (Figure 3A), and also with the ability of Env to
utilize low levels of CD4 to mediate cell-cell fusion (Figure 3B). Next, to better understand the influence of
changes in the gp120 CD4bs aperture on CD4 binding
and CD4bs exposure, we measured the ability of Env to
bind sCD4 and the Env mAb IgG1b12, whose epitope

sequence alignment using a maximum likelihood algorithm, as described previously [39]. The nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 AD8, 89.6, JRCSF,

overlaps the gp120 CD4bs, using a subset of Envs (n =
12, Macs1br2-8 and Macs1sp3-15; see Figure 1), as
described previously [13,35]. In these assays, we
observed a near significant association between the
width of the CD4bs cavity and ability of Env expressed
on 293T cells to bind sCD4 (Figure 3C), and a

significant correlation between this parameter and the
ability of Env to bind IgG1b12 (Figure 3D). Together,
these studies, using a large and newly-described panel of
primary Envs, demonstrate the utility of three-dimensional modeling of the gp120 CD4bs cavity for better
understanding the structural basis of Env-CD4

in molecular surface representation, and the CD4 molecule is shown in blue Ca wire, with Phe43 of CD4 highlighted in yellow stick

shown in ball and stick representation and their molecular surface is highlighted in blue. The width of the CD4bs aperture, as constrained by

interactions, confirming the results of our recent study
of a different and much smaller panel of Envs [13].
Furthermore, our results provide new evidence suggesting that these predicted CD4bs conformational alterations augment the ability of gp120 to interact with CD4
by increasing the exposure of the CD4bs.
Repositioning of the V5 loop is associated with
conformational alterations in the gp120 CD4bs

To elucidate the gp120 determinants which may contribute to structural alterations in the CD4bs and which
subsequently influence CD4 interactions and fusogenicity, we next compared the structural similarity between
CB3sc2 and Macs1br3 gp120 models which are

predicted to have the narrowest and widest of the
CD4bs apertures (30 and 36 Ã, respectively). Overlays of
these molecular models revealed a high degree of structural similarity within the V1V2 stem region, but notable structural variation within the V5 loop region
(Figure 4A). Furthermore, sequence analysis of all the
primary Env clones showed a relatively high degree of
sequence homology within the V1V2 stem region (Figure 4B), but a relatively high degree of sequence variation within the V5 loop (Figure 4C). Together, these
results suggest that, in this new panel of Envs, alteration
in the width of the CD4bs cavity is likely to be due to
sequence variability within the V5 region of gp120
which repositions the V5 loop.

Figure 3 The effect of gp120 CD4bs cavity alterations on fusogenicity, CD4-dependence, sCD4 binding and CD4bs exposure. The
CD4bs aperture widths for each gp120 model were plotted against the ability of Env to mediate cell-cell fusion (A), the ability of Env to utilize
low levels of CD4 for cell-cell fusion (B), and the ability of Env to bind sCD4 (C) or the Env mAb IgG1b12 (D), using Prism version 5.0c (GraphPad
Software). The methods for these functional and biochemical assays have been described in detail previously, including the extensive use of
controls to ensure equivalent expression of Env on the cell surface, protocols for generating (and measuring CD4 expression on) CD4low and
CD4high cells, and the empirical determination of sCD4 and IgG1b12 concentrations used that we showed were within the linear range of Env
binding [13,32,35]. The Spearman correlation coefficient (r) and P values are shown. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The
data shown are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Conclusions
Using a large, independent panel of Envs, we confirmed
that structural alterations in the gp120 CD4bs can be
deduced using optimized three-dimensional gp120

molecular models, and that these alterations may influence fusogenicity and the ability of gp120 to interact
with CD4. We further show, for the first time, that
these alterations appear to increase the exposure of the

conservation at each amino acid position was calculated. The GAG linker sequence, which replaced the V1V2 loops in the crystal and model
structures, is shown and highlighted as a grey box in panel (B).

CD4bs. Thus, our study provides new insights into
structural mechanisms that contribute to altered interactions between gp120 and CD4. These insights contribute
to a better understanding of HIV-1 entry and in addition, may inform the design of Env vaccine immunogens
where enhanced exposure of the CD4bs may be desirable to elicit effective neutralizing antibody responses.
Furthermore, our modeling approach may be informative for better understanding structural mechanisms
contributing to HIV-1 disease progression. Here, we
finally describe and characterize a new and relatively
large panel of functional Envs from brain and other

tissues, which will enhance the capacity of investigators
to undertake NeuroAIDS research.
