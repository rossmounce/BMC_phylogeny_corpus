Abstract
Background: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness
in children. We examined the diversity and molecular evolution of HMPV using 85 full-length F
(fusion) gene sequences collected over a 20-year period.
Results: The F gene sequences fell into two major groups, each with two subgroups, which
exhibited a mean of 96% identity by predicted amino acid sequences. Amino acid identity within
and between subgroups was higher than nucleotide identity, suggesting structural or functional
constraints on F protein diversity. There was minimal progressive drift over time, and the genetic
lineages were stable over the 20-year period. Several canonical amino acid differences
discriminated between major subgroups, and polymorphic variations tended to cluster in discrete
regions. The estimated rate of mutation was 7.12 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year and the estimated
time to most recent common HMPV ancestor was 97 years (95% likelihood range 66-194 years).
Analysis suggested that HMPV diverged from avian metapneumovirus type C (AMPV-C) 269 years
ago (95% likelihood range 106-382 years).
Conclusion: HMPV F protein remains conserved over decades. HMPV appears to have diverged
from AMPV-C fairly recently.

Background
Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a recently
described respiratory virus in the order Mononegavirales,
family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus
Metapneumovirus [1]. HMPV is a leading cause of lower

respiratory infection (LRI) in infants and children worldwide [2-13]. HMPV is also associated with severe disease
in immunocompromised hosts or persons with underlying conditions [14-20]. Most reports of HMPV molecular
epidemiology have included only a few seasons, and the

genetic variability of HMPV over decades has not been
determined. Candidate vaccines for HMPV are under
development [21-25], and the fusion (F) protein is the
major antigenic determinant of protection [22,24,26-28]
Therefore, it is critical to understand the potential for
immune escape through virus evolution over time, and
the likelihood that immunity against a particular F protein included in a vaccine candidate will be broadly protective.
The virus most closely related genetically to HMPV is
avian metapneumovirus type C (AMPV-C) [1]. AMPV is
an emerging pathogen of poultry that was identified in
1979. Subtypes AMPV-A and AMPV-B circulate in Europe
and Africa, while AMPV-C was discovered in Minnesota
and has been detected in the US and Korea [29,30]. Productive experimental infection of poultry with HMPV has
not been successful, and serological studies have failed to
detect evidence of human infection by AMPV [1]. Recent
data suggest that F protein is responsible for this species
restriction [31]. Thus, HMPV infection of humans may
arise from a relatively recent trans-species transmission
from AMPV-C.
We analyzed full-length F gene sequences from 68 isolates
of HMPV collected over a 20-year period from otherwise
healthy children with respiratory disease and 17 published full-length F gene sequences from other regions of
the world. Our data show that HMPV F is highly conserved geographically over several decades. Distinct
amino acid changes were present between different
genetic lineages, but these amino acids were conserved
within lineages. Variations that were present clustered in
discrete regions, suggesting antigenic sites possibly driven
by selective immune pressure. However, HMPV F gene
sequences did not display progressive drift over time,
unlike influenza viruses. The mutation rate of HMPV was
similar to that of other RNA viruses, and the time to most

recent common ancestor suggested recent divergence
from AMPV-C.

Results
Comparison of sequence identity between subgroups
Full-length F gene sequences were obtained for 68 Tennessee strains of HMPV and assigned to one of the four proposed lineages (A1, A2, B1, or B2) based on phylogenetic
analysis, discussed further below [32]. Of the 68 strains
sequenced, 34 (50%) were of the B2 lineage, 18 (26%)
A2, 7 (10%) B1 and 9 (13%) A1 lineage. Sequences
obtained in this study were compared to 17 published
full-length HMPV F gene sequences. The overall mean
nucleotide identity between all 85 isolates was 89%, with
a minimum identity of 83.7% (Table 1). The identity
within major groups was higher, mean 96% (minimum
93.9%) between A1 and A2, and mean 97% (minimum
93.5%) between B1 and B2. The B2 lineage diverged more
from the A lineages than the B1 lineage. B2 mean identity
with A1 and A2 was 86.7% and 89.7%, respectively, while
B1 identity with A1 and A2 was 91.3% and 94.7%, respectively. Mean nucleotide identity was >97% within all
minor lineages, although the minimum identity for the
B2 isolates was the lowest at 93.5%, showing more diversity within this lineage.

Amino acid identity was more conserved than nucleotide
identity between and within all groups, with overall minimum identity of 93.7% and mean identity 96.3%. Amino
acid identity within major groups was 98.7% for A1 and
A2, and 99.3% for B1 and B2. The minimum amino acid
identity between all lineages was approximately 94%; the
greater divergence of the B2 lineage at the nucleotide level
was not represented in the amino acid sequence.

Distinct and conserved amino acid changes between
lineages
There were a number of amino acid residues distinct to
each group or subgroup (Table 2). The greatest number of
divergent and subgroup-specific residues was identified in
the F1 domain, between the two heptad repeat (HR)
regions. At several positions all subgroups had either
arginine or lysine but maintained a basic residue: 82, 348,
450, 479 and 518; only position 82 has been shown to be
cleaved during infection [33,34]. Many subgroup-specific
residues were similar biochemically between groups.
Some variations, however, were unexpected, such as the
presence of a proline at position 404 only in B subgroup
viruses. Fourteen cysteine residues were conserved among
all isolates except one Japanese sequence (JPS03.178)
with a reported C292W variation [35]. Three potential Nglycosylation sites were conserved in all sequences: N58,
N172 and N350 (Figure 1).

There were a number of single amino acid variations
present in only one or a few sequences; these amino acids
are listed in Table 3 and shown graphically in Figure 1.
Many of these variant amino acids were biochemically
quite dissimilar, though the biological significance of this
finding is not clear. Interestingly, the highest variability
was in the region between amino acids 260 to 300, analogous to the major antibody antigenic site A of the related
RSV F protein [36] (Figure 1). Some of the variations in
this region, such as E294G, were present in viruses of both
the A1 and A2 subgroups. Viruses of the A2 lineage had
the greatest number of such variations in the region
between amino acids 230 to 300, but not elsewhere in the
protein.
Phylogenetic diversity and evolution over time
We performed phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of
the aligned full-length F sequences with six different models using the BEAST program suite [37]. The phylogenetic

tree representing the sequence relationships by nucleotide
substitutions identified four genetic subgroups (Figure 2),
consistent with previous analyses [32]. The four distinct
subgroups remained stable over time, and viruses within
these lineages were closely related genetically, despite
being isolated at time points separated by as many as
twenty years. Thus, the clustering did not correlate closely
with chronological origin of the sequences. For example,
one subcluster within the B2 lineage contained nearly
identical sequences from Tennessee in 1989, 1990, 1991,
1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2001, as
well as Netherlands in 1994 and Canada in 1998 and
2000 (Figure 2). Similar clustering of chronologically and
geographically disparate sequences was present within
each subgroup. In the A1 subgroup, Tennessee sequences
from 1994, 1996, and 2003 were closely related to Canadian sequences from 1999 and 2000 and a Japanese
sequence from 2003. To examine further the evolution of
HMPV F gene sequences over time, we aligned sequences
within each subgroup in chronological order (see Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4). A few nucleotide changes persisted in later chronological viruses and thus represented
progressive evolution at those sites. However, the majority
of the nucleotide changes from year to year were not preserved and often reverted in subsequent isolates, showing
a lack of major drift over time.
Analysis of multiple sequences collected over time
allowed a molecular clock calculation of viral nucleotide
changes. The mutation rate of HMPV F was 7.12 × 10-4
substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 4.23 × 10-4, 1.01 × 103). The estimated time to most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) of all HMPV strains was 97 years (95% HPD 66194) (Figure 2). The estimated time of divergence of the A
subgroup into A1 and A2 was 51 years (95% HPD 38-92)
and between B1 and B2 subgroups 40 years (95% HPD
38-97). Similar analysis using the limited number of
available AMPV full-length F sequences (n = 24, including
16 AMPV-C F sequences collected between 1998-2007)
suggested a tMRCA between AMPV-C and HMPV of 269
years (95% HPD 106-382) (Figure 2). However, very few
full-length AMPV type C F sequences were available, and
most were obtained within the last few years. The effect of
these limitations is reflected in the wide 95% HPD intervals and thus the estimates for divergence of HMPV from
AMPV-C must be considered with some caution.
Discussion
We analyzed 85 full-length HMPV F gene sequences
obtained over a twenty-year period from Tennessee, Canada, Japan, and the Netherlands. Our data confirm that
there are four distinct genetic lineages of HMPV, provisionally designated as A1, A2, B1 and B2 [32]. These data
further show that these genetic subgroups are stable over
time in circulating viruses in a population of children with

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/138

respiratory illnesses. Thus, HMPV does not appear to
exhibit progressive genetic evolution, unlike influenza
virus that exhibits rapid genetic drift associated with antigenic variation resulting in immune escape. In this
respect, HMPV appears to be similar to other paramyxoviruses. RNA viruses mutate frequently due to the infidelity
and lack of proofreading ability of RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases [38]. Our data confirm that the HMPV
polymerase also allows frequent errors resulting in the circulation of field strains with nucleotide variations at a
similarly high rate. The rate of mutations we identified in
HMPV F (7.12 × 10-4 substitutions/site/year) was intermediate between the lower rate of measles virus H gene
mutation (9 × 10-5 substitutions/site/year) and the higher
rate of influenza A virus HA (1.8 × 10-3 substitutions/site/
year)[39]. Nonetheless, while paramyxoviruses including
RSV and measles exhibit mutations and genotype variation over time [40,41], these nucleotide mutations do not
result in progressive antigenic "drift" over time with loss
of neutralizing epitopes [36,42,43]. This finding is in contrast to the data from studies of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein, which progressively evolves both
genetically and antigenically, necessitating annual vaccine
updates [44-47]. The reason for the lack of directional
antigenic drift in paramyxoviruses is not clear. There
could be functional constraints on paramyxovirus fusion
proteins to prevent such drastic amino acid changes. The
fact that nucleotide diversity is greater than amino acid
diversity among HMPV F sequences supports this hypothesis. In contrast to paramyxoviruses, the analogous influenza virus hemagglutinin and human immunodeficiency
virus gp120 fusion proteins are capable of substantial
mutation to escape neutralizing antibodies without loss
of function. Alternatively, the nature of immune pressure
on fusion protein sequences by human antibodies could
differ between paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses.
Experimental live wild-type virus challenge of previously
infected adults with a single lot of virus can achieve productive infection in a repetitive fashion within months of
previous infection with the same virus [48]. The mechanism of the functional constraints on paramyxovirus
fusion protein diversity warrants further investigation.
The finding that HMPV F gene sequences do not evolve
rapidly in a progressive fashion is important for the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines.
The HMPV F protein is the major determinant of protection in animal models [21,22,24,26,28]. Studies with a
limited number of virus strains in these models suggest a
degree of cross-protective efficacy mediated by prior infection with viruses of differing subgroups [26,49]. The high
degree of conservation of F protein over time suggests that
interventions such as mAbs or vaccines likely will not
need to be continuously updated.

We identified a number of group and subgroup-specific
amino acid residues, some in putative functional
domains. The biological importance of these variations is
not clear, since definitive evidence of pathogenic differences between HMPV strains has not been described. A
previous analysis of 84 partial HMPV F sequences did not
identify subgroup-specific amino acid differences
between A1 and A2 viruses; however, a 441-nt gene segment was analyzed and most of the viruses were of recent
derivation [32]. The subgroup-specific amino acid
changes in F genes also were conserved over time, raising
the question of whether these residues possess critical biological features for virus infection or transmission. Some
of these variant amino acids were found in regions presumed to be essential, such as the heptad repeat (HR)
regions. Synthetic HR peptides mediate potent in vitro
inhibition of HMPV infection [50,51] and the HR are predicted to form a six-membered helical bundle [50], suggesting that HMPV F is a Class I viral fusion protein. We
have cultivated multiple strains of all four subgroups that
exhibit similar growth kinetics and syncytial formation in
vitro, and similar levels of replication in vivo in rodents
(data not shown), suggesting that the fusion function of
all these strains is intact despite amino acid variations.
The HMPV F protein, like other Class I viral fusion proteins, requires cleavage for activation and most strains
require exogenous trypsin for in vitro growth. Schickli et
al described a cleavage site mutation S101P that arose in
two strains of HMPV during cell passage and was associated with trypsin-independent viral growth in vitro [34].
The variant viruses did not differ from wild type in replication in Syrian hamsters [34]. We identified an S101P
variation in three distinct viruses in this study from 1989,
1994, and 1999. The F gene sequences in the current study
were amplified directly from specimens collected from
children with URI, and thus these viruses are natural variants. One of these had an associated E93V variation that
also was observed by Schickli et al. None of these three
viruses in our study was associated with more severe clinical disease (data not shown).
Human and rodent F-specific mAbs have been described
with neutralizing activity in vitro and protective effects in
vivo, and several overlapping antigenic sites have been
identified using these mAbs [52,53]. However, the precise
location of these epitopes on the protein has not been
defined. We find it intriguing that the greatest concentration of amino acid variations among these 85 field isolates lies in a region found between residues 260 to 300,
which is roughly analogous to the major antibody antigenic site A in the human RSV F protein [36,42]. The precise definition of neutralizing epitopes, especially
conserved epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies, is
critical for the development of prophylactic mAbs.

Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of multiple fulllength HMPV and AMPV F sequences obtained over
twenty years showed that HMPV may have diverged from
AMPV-C nearly 300 years ago, and the divergence of the
four HMPV genotypes likely occurred within the last hundred years. de Graaf et al recently reported estimated
tMRCA values of ~120 years for the four HMPV genotypes
and 200 years for HMPV divergence from AMPV-C [54].
These estimates were based on analysis of 76 HMPV G
sequences, 107 partial HMPV F sequences, 12 partial
AMPV-C F sequences, 21 HMPV N sequences, and 15
AMPV-C N sequences from isolates collected over approximately 12 years. Thus, the number of genes included was
greater, but the spread in years was less and most
sequences were from recent isolates. Despite these differences, we estimated remarkably similar rates of divergence
for both major and minor subgroups. Padhi et al analyzed
published HMPV G sequences and estimated a tMRCA of
only 25-50 years; however, the majority of viruses in that
study were isolated between 2001 and 2003 [55]. Analysis
of complete genome sequences from HMPV strains
obtained over many years would provide the most robust
estimates of genetic diversity and evolution.
Our phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis suggest that
HMPV may have diverged fairly recently from AMPV,
although the power of this analysis was limited by the
small number of available AMPV F gene sequences. Successful productive infection of chickens and turkeys with
HMPV has not been reported [1], although inflammation,
HMPV RNA and antigen could be detected in turkey
poults inoculated with a large inoculum of HMPV [56].
HMPV and AMPV contain analogous open reading frames
in the same order that are distinct from those of the Pneumovirus genus, and metapneumoviruses lack the NS1 and
NS2 genes of pneumoviruses [57]. This finding suggests
that HMPV diverged from AMPV-C. Other viruses including influenza and HIV are thought to have originated in
animal reservoirs but are now established primary human
pathogens; HMPV may have arisen as a human pathogen
by similar zoonotic transfer.

Methods
HMPV isolates
Virus sequences were derived from specimens collected
over a twenty-year period from 1982-2002 in the Vanderbilt Vaccine Clinic, as previously described [2,3]. Nasal
wash specimens were collected from children <5 years of
age with acute respiratory tract illness. We extracted RNA
from these samples and used quantitative real-time RTPCR to test for HMPV by detection of nucleoprotein gene
sequences [2]. Specimens that tested positive for HMPV
were subjected to nested RT-PCR for the F gene as
described below. Viral nomenclature used in this study
uses a letter code representing the geographic site of isola-

tion (e.g., "TN" represents Tennessee) followed by the year
of isolation, month in which the virus was isolated and
isolate number.
RNA extraction, RT-PCR and sequencing of F genes
RNA was extracted from 220 μl of nasal wash sample on a
Qiagen BioRobot 9604 Workstation using the QIAamp
Viral RNA kit (Qiagen), as described [2]. Amplification of
the entire F open reading frame (ORF) was carried out by
RT-PCR followed by nested PCR. The primers used to
amplify the F regions were FF1 (5'-ATGTCTGTACTTCCCAAA-3') and FR (5'-CCCGYACTTCATATTTGCA-3') for
RT-PCR, and FF2 (5'-AATATGCAAGACTTGGAGCC-3'
and 5'-AGGATCTGCAAGAGCTGGAG-3') and FR (5'CCCGYACTTCATATTTGCA-3') for nested PCR. The Thermoscript/Platinum Taq Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen) was
used in a 50 μL RT-PCR reaction with 10 μL of diluted
RNA as template. The RT-PCR was carried out at 50°C for
50 min and 95°C for 3 min, followed by 5 cycles of 94°C
for 30 sec, 50°C for 1 min, and 68°C for 3 min, and additional 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 1 min, and
68°C for 3 min. For nested PCR, 2 μL of RT-PCR product
was added to a 50 μL reaction using Platinum PCR Supermix (Invitrogen). The reaction was incubated at 95°C for
3 min followed by 5 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for
30 sec, and 68°C for 2 min, and additional 30 cycles of
94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 68°C for 2 min. For
all reactions a final extension at 68°C for 7 min was
included. The resulting products were about 1.9 kb for the
F ORF and flanking sequences. The majority of PCR products generated after RT-PCR and nested PCR were specific
and migrated as a single band of the expected size (data
not shown). Agarose gel purification of the desired PCR
products was performed when multiple products were
generated.

Sequencing reactions were carried out using ABI PRISM
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit
(Applied Biosystems). Eight sequencing primers were
used for each fragment to ensure a two-fold coverage of
the open reading frame. Sequencing primers are available
upon request. The products were processed by capillary
electrophoresis using ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems), and analyzed using DNA Sequencing Analysis (Applied Biosystems) and Sequencher (Gene Codes
Corp.).

study have been submitted to GenBank under accession
numbers EU857542-EU857610. Pairwise sequence alignment, multiple sequence alignment, and percent nucleotide identity calculations were performed using
MacVector version 9.0. Inference of phylogeny and overall
rates of evolutionary change (nucleotide substitutions per
site per year) and the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were estimated using the Bayesian Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach available in the
BEAST package http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/[37]. Because
the sequences analyzed were very closely related and
exhibited few multiple substitutions at single nucleotide
sites, we used the simple HKY85 model of nucleotide substitution in each case, as more complex models sometimes failed to converge (data not shown). Data sets were
analyzed under demographic models of constant population size, exponential population growth, and expansion
population growth, using strict or relaxed (uncorrelated
logarithmic) molecular clocks. Comparison of the output
of each model showed that the relaxed clock, exponential
population growth model gave the best estimation based
on 95% highest posterior density (HPD)(not shown). All
runs were visually examined to ensure convergence and
Estimated Sample Size of >200. MCMC chains were run
for 30 million steps with a burn-in rate of 10%, and two
separate runs were combined using the Log Combiner
program http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/[37], with uncertainty
in parameter estimates reported as the 95% HPD. Output
sets of trees were combined using LogCombiner and analyzed with the TreeAnnotator program to produce a Maximum Clade Credibility tree with a posterior probability
limit of >50%. Final tree was produced with FigTree [37].
