DNA barcoding of the Lemnaceae, a family of
aquatic monocots
Wenqin Wang, Yongrui Wu, Yiheng Yan, Marina Ermakova, Randall Kerstetter, Joachim Messing*

Abstract
Background: Members of the aquatic monocot family Lemnaceae (commonly called duckweeds) represent the
smallest and fastest growing flowering plants. Their highly reduced morphology and infrequent flowering result in
a dearth of characters for distinguishing between the nearly 38 species that exhibit these tiny, closely-related and
often morphologically similar features within the same family of plants.
Results: We developed a simple and rapid DNA-based molecular identification system for the Lemnaceae based on
sequence polymorphisms. We compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers proposed by the
CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) plant-working group to discriminate species within the land plants in 97
accessions representing 31 species from the family of Lemnaceae. A Lemnaceae-specific set of PCR and sequencing
primers were designed for four plastid coding genes (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL and matK) and three noncoding spacers
(atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA) based on the Lemna minor chloroplast genome sequence. We assessed the
ease of amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of the barcoding gap between intraand inter-specific variation by pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct sequence
comparison of the “best close match” and the construction of a phylogenetic tree.
Conclusions: Based on its reliable amplification, straightforward sequence alignment, and rates of DNA variation
between species and within species, we propose that the atpF-atpH noncoding spacer could serve as a universal
DNA barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds.

Background
The cost of DNA purification and sequencing has
dropped considerably in recent years so that identification of individual species by DNA barcoding has become
an independent, subtler method than solely morphological-based classification to distinguish closely related species, which also defines the systematic relationships by
analysis of genetic distance. The key element for a robust
barcode is a suitable threshold between inter- and intraspecific genetic distances. Sequence variation between
species has to be high enough to tell them apart while
the distances within species must be low enough for
them to cluster together [1]. The mitochondrial coxidase
subunit I (COI) gene has proven to be a reliable, costeffective, and easily recovered barcode marker to successfully identify animal species [2-4], but its application in
the plant kingdom is impeded by a slow nucleotide

substitution rate, which is insufficient for the diagnosis of
individual species [5,6]. However, the Consortium for the
Barcode of Life (CBOL) plant-working group recently
proposed seven leading candidate sequences for use as
barcoding markers [7]. Four plastid coding genes (rpoB,
rpoC1, rbcL and matK) and three noncoding spacers
(atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA) have been
selected based on previous investigations among different
plant families [8-10]. However, the utility of each of these
sequences for individual families of species within the
plant kingdom is hardly predictable [11,12].
Although there have been attempts to use the singlelocus of matK [8], a combination of two loci, rbcL and
trnH-psbA [9], and even multi-loci combinations [13] as
barcoding sequences, the use of a unified barcode for
the identification of all the land plants would be difficult
due to conflicting needs of different researchers. For
example, an optimal barcode marker that has been
determined empirically to distinguish plants at the
family level may prove less useful for making accurate

species level identifications. Most of the proposed plant
barcode markers were designed primarily for identifying
distantly related organisms in biodiversity hotspots such
as Panama [14] and Kruger National Park in South
Africa [8]. So far, little attention and only a few studies
have been devoted to developing unified barcodes suitable for making identifications within a family, within a
genus, or between closely related sister species. A test of
seven other candidate barcoding sequences in the family
of Myristicaceae was applied to eight species within a
genus and yielded two suitable barcodes [15]. Recently,
it has been shown that all three markers (rbcL, trnHpsbA and matK) can discriminate 4 sister species of
Acacia across three continents [16]. The marker matK
has been reported to distinguish 5 Dendrobium species
[17]. More complex approaches have been developed at
the subfamily level identification of larger groups of
related plants [18]. Although an extensive barcode study
for 31
Carex species suggested that a single locus or even multiple loci cannot provide a resolution of greater than 60%,
it did not include some of the new markers (atpF-atpH
and psbK-psbI) [19]. When atpF-atpH and psbK-psbI were
included for distinguishing Carex and Kobresia, it could
be shown that matK identifies 95% as single-locus or
100% of the species when combined with another marker.
However, this study used material from a well defined
regional perspective, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago,
where the number of co-existing closely related species is
limited [20]. Our objective was to determine whether one
or more of the markers proposed by the CBOL plantworking group would serve as an optimal marker for
species-level identification within the family Lemnaceae.
The members of the family Lemnaceae, commonly
called duckweeds, comprise 38 species in five genera
[21]. They are all aquatic plants that grow on or below
the surface of the water all over the world and they
include the smallest flowering plants [22]. They are ideal
material for physiological, biochemical, and genomic
studies because of their direct contact with medium,
rapid growth and relatively small genome sizes [22].
They are valuable means for biomanufacturing through
genetic engineering technology and due to the recent
progress towards duckweed-based commercial products
[23]. They can be easily maintained by vegetative reproduction in aseptic cultivation for decades [23]. The
small size of the plant is ideal for maintaining diverse
accessions and therefore for evolutionary studies at
the DNA level. Some species, such as Lemna minor,
are used by the Environmental Protection Agency for
measuring water quality because their growth rates are
sensitive to a wide range of environmental contaminants
such as metals, nitrates, and phosphates [24]. Indeed,
wastewater treatment with duckweed has been proposed

Page 2 of 11

as a “green” way to remediate municipal water supplies
[25]. Rapid growth also offers practical applications of
duckweeds as a biofuel crop. Some duckweeds form
starch-rich over-wintering fronds called turions, which
can be easily induced from vegetative fronds by treatment of cold shock, starvation, or with abscisic acid
[26,27]. Resulting from their size and density, both vegetative fronds and turions are much more easily
harvested than microalgae [28], which make duckweeds
an attractive feedstock for bioethanol production that
does not compete for agriculturally productive land.
Given these potential uses, the 160-Mb Spirodela polyrhiza genome has been selected for whole genome
sequencing by the DOE-JGI community-sequencing program (CSP). A reference genome within this family will
be invaluable for gene discovery and evolutionary analysis of aquatic monocot species. Furthermore, from a systematic point of view, classification solely based on
morphological characteristics has been a significant
challenge. The most readily observed anatomical feature
of the minute and highly reduced duckweeds are their
fronds with or without roots. These few and somewhat
variable morphological characters and rarely emerging
flowers or fruits make identification of duckweeds extremely difficult even for professional taxonomists [29].
Complementing traditional classification methods with a
DNA-based method would be highly applicable for such
a family of species. It would permit these species to be
classified in a highly reproducible and cost effective
manner because DNA-based methods are independent
of morphology, integrity, and developmental stage of the
organism and can distinguish among species that superficially look alike [30].
Here, we present a simple and accessible protocol to
barcode duckweeds and establish a sequence database
against which unknown species may be compared and
tentative species identifications can be validated. This
database also provides a high-resolution phylogenetic
resource for this important plant monocot family.

Results
Sampling criteria

The duckweed family consists of 38 species classified
into 5 genera [21]. A worldwide collection has been
characterized by genome sizes (Wang et al., ms. in
prep.). From this collection, 97 ecotypes were sampled
for the current work representing all five genera and 31
species (81.6% of the known species; Additional file 1).
The ecotypes selected encompass the worldwide geographical distribution of duckweeds originating from different climates and geographical regions, ranging from
N60° to S42° latitude and 9 m to 1287 m in altitude
(Additional file 1, Figure 1). 85 ecotypes from 19 species
were used for statistical calculations and candidate

barcode evaluations. An additional 12 single-ecotype
species were examined to determine the broader applicability of the barcode markers for identification.
Validation of DNA barcoding markers

To simplify identification of different species by DNA
barcodes, a target DNA sequence marker has to meet
two basic requirements: the first is a high success rate
during PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, the second is sufficient DNA sequence polymorphism to permit different species to be distinguished and
evolutionary distances between them to be calculated
[1]. The CBOL plant-working group proposed 7 leading
candidates [7], i.e., 4 coding genes (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL
and matK) and 3 noncoding spacers (atpF-atpH, psbKpsbI and trnH-psbA). To evaluate the seven markers,
genomic DNA extracted from the 97 ecotypes was subjected to PCR amplification with the primer pairs based
on the chloroplast sequence of Lemna minor. The PCR
primers were also used for sequencing (See Materials
and methods). PCR and sequencing were generally successful (≥95%) for all the barcode candidates except
matK (71%) (Table 1). The maximal and minimal alignment length of PCR product for rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL and

matK were identical, while that of atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI
and trnH-psbA were quite variable, with a range of 579622 bp, 185-576 bp and 286-504 bp, respectively. It was
not unexpected that the coding markers (rpoB, rpoC1,
rbcL and matK) were conserved in PCR product length,
while the noncoding spacers (atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and
trnH-psbA) displayed more variability due to extensive
insertions/deletions (Table 1). These results indicate
that the selection of markers by the COBL plant-working group should provide a reasonable level of success
for new untested plant families.
Intra- and inter-specific DNA sequence polymorphism

To assess the degree of DNA polymorphism between
DNA samples, sequence divergences between and within
species were calculated by Kimura 2-parameter (K2P)
and uncorrected p-distance, respectively. Both models
exhibited the same tendency: higher average interspecific
diversity and lower intraspecific distance. For example,
the K2P distance within and between species is as follows: psbK-psbI (0.1648 and 0.0072), trnH-psbA (0.1133
and 0.0058), matK (0.0715 and 0.0019), atpF-atpH
(0.0633 and 0.0008) rpoB (0.0388 and 0.0069), rpoC1
(0.0303 and 0.0006), rbcL (0.0216 and 0.0004). The

noncoding spacer psbK-psbI showed the highest interspecific diversity (66 average substitution sites among
675 bp), while the coding marker rbcL is the most conserved one (11 average substitution sites among 522 bp)
(Table 2). Wilcoxon signed rank tests further showed
that the most variable barcode between species was
psbK-psbI, followed by trnH-psbA, matK and atpF-atpH
(Additional file 2). The lowest intraspecific distance was
provided by atpF-atpH and rbcL, whereas the highest is
trnH-psbA, psbK-psbI and matK (Additional file 3).
Although none of the seven proposed markers possessed
both the highest variation between species and the lowest distance within a species, atpF-atpH seemed to show
sufficient interspecific but relatively low intraspecific
divergence, compared to the other six markers (Table 2,
Additional file 2 and 3).
The accuracy of barcoding for species identification
depended to a large extent on the barcoding gap
between intraspecific and interspecific sequence variations. Effective barcoding became weaker when interspecific and intraspecific distances overlapped. To evaluate
whether there was a significant barcoding gap, we calculated the distribution of divergences for the seven markers (Figure 2). Median and Mann-Whitney U tests
inferred that the mean of intraspecific divergence was
significantly lower than that of interspecific distance in
each case (p < 0.0001). Even though psbK-psbI and
trnH-psbA exhibited the highest rates of divergence
between species, they were also most diverged within
species, which could easily result in misidentification
(Table 2, Additional file 3 and 4, Figure 2). On the
other hand, the adequate variation and the narrow overlapping distance of the atpF-atpH marker would ensure
accurate ecotype and species identification (Table 2,
Additional file 2 and 3, Figure 2).
DNA sequence similarity-based identification

In order to test whether accurate species identification
can be made in our samples, we adopted the “best

match” function in the program TAXONDNA [31]. The
rank order for the correct identification is atpF-atpH
(92.85%) psbK-psbI (84.7%), trnH-psbA (82.5%), matK
(77.77%), rpoB (77.5%), rpoC1 (70.58%), rbcL (70.58%)
(Table 3). Generally, the three noncoding spacers produced higher rates of successful identifications than
those of the four coding markers. Consistent with Figure
3, atpF-atpH yielded the best result with 92.85% successful identifications. Among 84 ecotypes (not including species with single sampled ecotypes), 78 samples
were successfully discriminated, three were ambiguous
and three were incorrectly identified using atpF-atpH.
When we combined atpF-atpH with one of the other
five barcoding markers, the percentage of correct identification dropped, except for psbK-psbI, which gave an
increase of 1.19% (Table 3). The markers matK + atpFatpH were not counted because of the small number of
sequence comparisons done with matK.
Tree-based sequence classification

As an alternative to sequence similarity-based identification, we estimated the proportion of recovered monophyly from multiple conspecific ecotypes per species in
the phylogenetic tree for each barcoding marker. Here,
we need to stress that the primary purpose of the tree is
not so much the evolutionary relationship, but the species identification. The atpF-atpH attained the highest
score of monophyletic species (73.7%, i.e., 14 correctly
identified out of 19 species; Table 4 and Figure 3). The
number of successfully identified species with the other
six markers was rpoB (11), rpoC1 (11), rbcL (11), trnHpsbA (10), psbK-psbI (8). The atpF-atpH marker did not
distinguish closely-related pairs of sister species such as
W. gladiata and W. oblonga and L. minuta and
L. valdiviana.
Although the location of most grouped ecotypes in the
taxonomic trees did not change in regard to each marker, a close examination consistently revealed two interesting connections. First, despite the fact that very little

is known about how cross pollination in these tiny flowering plants occurs, L. japonica has been suspected to
originate from a hybridization event between L. minor
and L. turionifera based on morphological characters
[22]. Our data indicates that sequence from each of the
seven tested markers of L. japonica 7182 was always
identical to and clustered with L. minor (Figure 3). Since
the chloroplast is maternally inherited in many (but not
all) plants, our data is consistent with L. japonica arising
from a cross between L. minor and L. turionifera.
The second connection was S. polyrhiza 9203, which
consistently clusters with S. intermedia rather than
other S. polyrhiza in all seven tested markers (Figure 3).
We examined 34 ecotypes of S. polyrhiza from the collection using the atpF-atpH marker and found four
additional ecotypes that grouped closely with S. intermedia (Additional file 4). This suggested that these accessions might have been misidentified as S. polyrhiza due
to the overlap in morphological characteristics between
these species.

among those proposed by the CBOL plant-working
group. Such a fundamental, whole family-wide analysis
lays the groundwork for phylogenetic and genomic studies. Our samples represent a worldwide collection from
the same family with many sister species (Figure 1 and 3,
Additional file 1). Specimens in previous taxonomic classifications using barcoding markers were mainly from
distantly related groups from broadly different families
that originated from the local or more defined regions,
such as the National Park [8], the Amazon [32], and the
Panama region [14]. Because of the diversity of the collection that has accumulated over the years, duckweeds
provide a unique system to test the proposed barcoding
markers for closely related species. Furthermore, it is difficult to classify members of this family by morphology
alone. Therefore, we can not only validate the universal
application of barcoding markers, but also apply it to species that may be solely dependent on such an approach
for conservation. The advantage of universal barcoding
markers is the design of universal primers for barcoding
markers from reference sequences, which in this case was
L. minor [33]. The primers worked very well for all the
samples (31 species and 97 ecotypes) with PCR amplification and the sequencing success rates better than 95%,
except in the case of matK, which yielded a rate as low as
71% (Table 1). In addition, a lower PCR annealing temperature than optimal for Lemna minor permits primers
to anneal to the target sequences despite sequence polymorphism in related species. It is interesting that most
PCR failure existed in the Wolffioideae subfamily (Additional file 1). The locus matK has been shown to be very
variable in numerous phylogenetic studies [34,35]} and
other studies have also noted the difficulties of its utilization due to PCR failure and lack of truly universal primer
sites [9,10]. Further improvement of primer designs for
matK for other targets could increase amplification success, but might fail because of less conserved sites near
the most variable sequences of the locus. Although matK

DNA sequences exhibited the highest interspecific variation among the four coding markers (Table 2), the low
percentage of successful PCR amplification and sequencing in duckweeds would restrict its extensive use.
It was not surprising that the noncoding spacers
showed dramatically higher sequence variability than the
coding markers (Table 2). Given the slow evolutionary
rate of rpoB, rpoC1 and rbcL (especially for rbcL, which
is strongly recommended for barcoding across all land
plants), they work well to distinguish distantly related
species either alone or when combined with other more
variable regions [6,9]. However, their sequence polymorphisms might not be sufficient to distinguish closely
related species. The non-coding spacers of psbK-psbI
and trnH-psbA were the most polymorphic plastid
sequences with variable sequence length in duckweeds
(Table 1). The size of trnH-psbA in Spirodela (~504 bp)
was 218 bp longer than in the other four genera (~286
bp). The length of the psbK-psbI sequence was the most
variable, ranging from ~185 bp in S. polyrhiza to ~479
bp in S. intermedia even though they were sister-species
(Table 1 and Figure 3). These significant length variations caused by deletion/insertion, simple sequence
repeats and rearrangements were problematic for accurate alignment, but could potentially be adapted for simple diagnostic tests that would not require DNA
sequencing. Furthermore, the high sequence polymorphisms of the aligned sequences of psbK-psbI and trnHpsbA could offer greater distinction between species in a
diverse set of genera in certain families [5,8]. Still, one
has to use caution for intraspecies comparison where
the relatively higher intraspecific distance compromised
their power in barcoding duckweed species. One nearly
has to cluster samples into two groups, one for ecotypes
of the same species and one for species to species comparison (Table 2, 3, and 4, Figure 3). Failure to do so
would prevent the detection of true differences between
congeneric species and conspecific ecotypes and therefore impede the use of a universal duckweed barcode
(Figure 2).
Although previous studies showed that atpF-atpH as a
barcoding marker was inferior to psbK-psbI, trnH-psbA
and matK based on distantly related species [5,8,9], our
data suggested that it was the most promising barcoding
marker for duckweeds with respect to high PCR amplification, ease of alignment, and sufficient sequence divergence
(Table 1, 2, 3, 4 and Figure 2). Therefore, our data differed
from the conclusions of evaluating barcoding markers
made from unrelated species. Although it was shown that
barcoding plants by more than one region tended to be
more effective [11-13], combination of atpF-atpH with
any of the other markers resulted in only slight increases
or drops of the rate of successful identification of species
compared to itself alone (Table 3), indicating that the

Wang et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:205
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/205

discriminatory power of atpF-atpH has already reached an
optimum. When the atpF-atpH marker was combined
with other markers, the reduced resolution lowered the
differential value without complementary benefits. A similar finding that a combination of matK and trnH-psbA did
not improve species identification has been reported as
well [8].
One of the most significant applications of DNA barcoding is to overcome taxonomic obstacles, where it is
difficult to identify unknown or wrongly named species
in a family with similar morphology (Figure 3). Furthermore, DNA barcoding could offer us a primary screen
for further characterization of cryptic species. Although
scientists within the duckweed community were trying
to resolve the question of whether L. japonica (Lj) originated from hybridization of L. minor (Lm) and L. turionifera (Lt), preliminary attempts to cross Lm and Lt (50
crosses) to reproduce the hybridization event were not
successful [22]. The key problem is that flowering is
very rare and the flower is small in size, which makes
outcrossing extremely tedious [23]. Here, the sequences
from the seven tested chloroplast markers of L. japonica
7182 were always identical and clustered with L. minor
(Figure 3). Therefore, we used the limited nuclear markers (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, histone 3 gene, beta-1,2-xylosyltransferase isoform 1,
expression control elements from the Lemnaceae family)
to uncover the relationship among them by polymorphisms. Unexpectedly, the sequences showed great conservation and there was not sufficient variation to answer
this question. However, the identical alleles in L. japonica 7182 and L. minor support the assumption that L.
japonica might have come from the cross of L. minor
and L. turionifera.
Generally speaking of members of the duckweed
family, the more derived they are, the simpler their
morphologies. The reduction in size and simplification
in structure make the fronds more mobile and better
successfully adapt to variable conditions [22]. S. intermedia was characterized by a slight degree of primitivism
of more nerves, roots, and ovules compared to S. polyrhiza, which suggested that S. intermedia was differentiated into S. polyrhiza potentially through gradual
morphological reduction and isolation. However, gradual
differences were sometimes difficult to distinguish from
each other due to overlapping characteristics [22]. Our
studies for 34 ecotypes of S. polyrhiza using atpF-atpH
markers showed five ecotypes that have been clustered
with S. intermedia (Additional file 4), which is mainly
restricted to South America [22]. Good trace evidence
comes from S. polyrhiza 9203 (Figure 3). Among five
ecotypes, three are derived from South America, while
another two are from India. Therefore, a refined

Page 8 of 11

classification is necessary to determine whether another
four ecotypes except S. polyrhiza 9203 should be classified as S. intermedia rather than S. polyrhiza.
Both phylogenetic data [21] and our barcoding data
showed that closely related species W. gladiata and W.
oblonga, L. minuta and L. valdiviana could not be separated from each other (Figure 3). These sister-species
share identical sequences for barcoding markers, which
would require a search for additional barcoding markers
with greater sequence polymorphism. In fact, a universal
DNA barcoding marker has not been reported to distinguish more than 90% of species tested until now [8,32].
Elucidation of recently evolved species sharing identical
barcoding sequences still needs further taxonomic or
case-by-case morphological, flavonoid, and allozyme
analyses. On the other hand, use of next-generation
sequencing technologies and corresponding software
applications are emerging where low pass coverage of
different specimen could provide the necessary
resolution.

Conclusions
In this study we have demonstrated that atpF-atpH
noncoding spacer could serve as a universal DNA barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds. This marker will allow to identify unknown
species or to exploit new species of duckweeds by reason of its reliable amplification, straightforward
sequence alignment, and rates of DNA variation
between species and within species. DNA barcoding
developed in this study are a significant contribution to
the taxonomical structure in duckweeds compared with
insensitive morphological classification.
Methods
Plant materials

The Lemnaceae collection originated from the Institut
für Integrative Biologie (Zürich, Switzerland), the BIOLEX company (North Carolina, USA), and the University
of Toronto Culture Collection of Algae and Cyanobacteria (UTCC, Toronto, Canada) where it was maintained
for many years. Detailed information about many of
these accessions is included in Dr. Landolt’s monographic study [29]. In total, 97 ecotypes representing 31
species (81.6% of the known species) were sampled in
this study. Since the intraspecific distance is very important for evaluating a suitable barcoding marker, 2 to 8
representatives per species are included for 19 species,
whereas another 12 species are represented by a single
ecotype. Moreover, the selected ecotypes represent a
worldwide geographical distribution (Figure 1). A summary of all specimens included in this study was listed in
Additional file 1.

DNA amplification, sequencing and alignment

All duckweed fronds were grown aseptically in halfstrength Schenk and Hildebrandt medium (Sigma, S6765).
Total DNA was extracted using CTAB [36]. The chloroplast markers rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL, matK, atpF-atpH, trnHpsbA, and psbK-psbI, which were proposed by the CBOL
plant-working group, were amplified with a set of modified
primers (Table 5) based on reference sequences from
Lemna minor [33]. The amplicon sizes were also estimated
according to Lemna minor (Table 5). PCR reaction conditions also followed guidelines from the CBOL plant-working group. Briefly, 50-100 ng genomic DNA and 5 pmol of
each primer are added with the JumpStart™Redtop® ReadyMix™Reaction Mix (P1107, Sigma) Redix in 25 ml of final
volume. To improve the universal application of these primers, they were designed to have an annealing temperature (Ta) of 50°C, which is 1 to 6°C lower than the optimal
Ta of Lemna minor as determined by Beacon Designer
software (PREMIER Biosoft International) under reaction
conditions of 50 mM monovalent ion and 200 nM nucleic
acid concentration (Table 5). The program uses the following formula: optimal Ta = 0.3 × Tm (primer) + 0.7 Tm
(product) -14.9 [37]. The PCR products were purified with
ExoSap-IT™(USB Corp.) and then sequenced on an
ABI3730 automated sequencer using the same primers as
in the PCR reactions. Both strands of each PCR product
were sequenced and double-checked. The success ratios of
PCR amplification and sequencing were counted (Table
1). After the ambiguous nucleotides (~30bp) at the ends of
reads were removed, the length of products was measured
and multiple DNA sequence alignments were generated
using ClustalW in MEGA 4.1 [38].
Genetic distance analysis

Genetic distance was calculated using pairwise alignments
of sequences between and within species (Table 2). The

Page 9 of 11

average intraspecific distance was calculated with the
mean pairwise distance in each species with more than
one representative, which eliminated biases due to unbalanced sampling among taxa. We evaluated conspecific
and congeneric variability for each pair of marker
sequences by Wilcoxon signed rank tests (Additional file 2
and 3) [9]. Median and Mann-Whitney U tests were executed to examine the extent of DNA barcoding gap/overlap between intra- and inter-specific divergences [8].
Evaluation of DNA barcoding markers based on sequence
similarity

For assessing success in species assignment or identification among our data set, we adopted the “best match”
function in the program TAXONDNA (Table 3) [31].
We calculated pairwise distances as uncorrected pairwise distances and compared two sequences over at
least 300 bp except for psbK-psbI (230 bp). We suppressed indels when computing distances. The threshold
was set at a value below which 95% of all intraspecific
pairwise distances were found. Since the best match was
based on direct sequence comparison with other conspecific ecotypes, the analysis only counted species with
multiple ecotypes per species.
Evaluation of DNA barcoding markers using
phylogenetic analysis

The other criterion used to measure success of species
identification was based on generating a phylogenetic
tree. We built trees with MEGA 4.1 by using the best
algorithms methods of UPGMA and MP compared with
other tree building techniques for DNA barcoding [8].
UPGMA trees were made from K2P distances. The MP
trees were constructed using the close neighbor interchange (CNI) method with search level 1. The initial
tree for the CNI search was created by random addition
